# Pompidou Tours SLAC Under Tight Safety Measures
## 
### ED KOHN 
With overwhelming security
precautions in offcct, French
President Georges Pompidou
toured part of Stanford's Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and
met with student and
administration leaders Friday
during a 90-minute visit.
Between 350 and 400
protesters showed up to greet the
French President and his Foreign
Minister, Maurice Shumann. Most
supported the Israeli position in
the Middle East, but about 25
chanted slogans that included
"Long Live Al Fatah" (an Arab
terrorist organization). There were
no incidents.
One hundred fifty heavily
armed and equipped police
officers and deputy sheriffs, from
San Francisco, Marin, Alameda
and San Mateo, kept a close guard
over the French President. The
officers' armaments included
grenade launchers, M-17's, rifles
with telescopic sights, tear gas
guns and masks, riot helmets,
nightsticks and dogs.
Many of the policemen carried
one or more two-way radios, '"he

plainclothesmen also carried
radios and appeared to be wearing
guns underneath their sportcoats.
Officers were stationed around
Pompidou's landing site, on many
roofs, near the main body of
demonstrators, and they followed
him en masse wherever he went.
Numerous police photographers,
some with telephoto lenses and
movie cameras, were on the
roofs with the sharpshooters.
Accelerator Off
The French President spent
about 40 minutes touring the
SLAC complex. He was
accompanied on the tour by
SLAC Director Wolfgang K.H.
Panofsky, Atomic Energy
Commissioner Theos J.
Thompson, and MIT Prof. Victor
Weisskopf, former head ofCERN,
the European center for nuclear
research located in Switzerland.
The $144*million accelerator,
the longest in the world, was shut
down early Friday morning in
preparation for Pompidou's visit,
according to a SLAC spokesman.
The accelerator usually runs for
three weeks and is shut down for
a fourth. A liquid hydrogen target

was in place at the endstation,
where the President visited
briefly.
In the endstation, a seven-story
building, reporters heard
Pompidou ask if men were
allowed in the building while
experiments were being
conducted. Dr. Panofsky replied
that radiation levels were too high
in the building to allow human
occupancy during experiments.
After visiting the accelerator
complex, Pompidou conferred in
private with Panofsky, Thompson,
Weisskopf, Provost Richard
Lyman, Chairman of the Board of
Trustees W. Palmer Fuller 111.
Prof. Gordon Wright, a French
historian, and ASSIJ Council of
Presidents member Pat Shea.
Lyman, who spoke in French,
said that his statement was "a
primer" *and was intended to give
the French President a general
idea of how the campus operates,
the role of the Trustees, and some
fiscal considerations. The other
presentations concerned the
SLAC installation

POMPIDOU PROTKST — As French President Georges Pompidou toured the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center some
200 yards away, between 350 and 100 pro-Israeli demonstrators protested France's Arab support. Protest takes many
forms - among them picketing and folk dancing.
Questions that Pompidou
posed included the ratio of
graduate students to
undergraduates, the number of
lectures as compared to the
number of seminars, and
admissions requirements.
Shea Presents Statement
Lyman said that the French
President was "easygoing, relaxed,
and he seemed to enjoy himself."
Shea presented Pompidou with
a statement, signed by 500
members of the community,
asking the French President to
"reverse the unfair Middle East
policy of your government," to
lift the Israeli arms embargo, and
jaking for peace in the Middle
East.
Shea said that Pompidou
accepted the petition and his
covering letter, but made no
comment.
The ASSU Council of
Presidents member said later that
Pompidou joked with him about
their relative margins of voting
support, and questioned him
about how Stanford students have
implimented curriculum reforms
and innovations working with a
"flexible" university system.
No Demonstrator Contact
The only other student in the
meeting was Jean-Pierre Boudin, a
French student in the Graduate
School of Business.
Pompidou left the meeting
about 11:30 and walked to his
waiting Marine Corps helicopter.
He waved to some employees
gathered near some steps about 20
yards from his aircraft. He
departed SLAC about 11:35 a.m.
to address a luncheon of the
Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco.
The French President never
came into direct contact with the
demonstrators. Most of the
picketing took place about 200
yards from the landing site of the
helicopters, and the noise
generated by the aircrafts' jet

engines overcame much of the
shouting. Pompidou seemed to
ignore the picketers' signs, which
were clearly visible as he looked
down the long lawn that
comprised the landing zone.
Slogans, Signs
A sign reading "Off the Pigs"
was visible through an office
window 30 yards from his aircraft
when the French President
arrived, but was removed before
he returned to his helicopter for
departure.
The earliest demonstrators
arrived about 8 a.m., almost two
hours before Pompidou. Rabbi
Charles Familant, director of the
Hillel Foundation at Stanford, led
a group of 130 sign-waving
persons in a march up Sandhill
Road to SLAC from the Sharon
Heights shopping center. The
demonstration was in full force by
the time the French President
arrived at 9:50 a.m., ten minutes
ahead of schedule.
The demonstrators carried
signs including "Peace is not a
Mirage," "French Honor for
Sale," "Send Pompidou to
Lybia," and "Dreyfus II." Many
of the pro-Israeli demonstrators
appeared to be middle aged or
older.
Israeli and Arab flags were
clearly visible in the crowd.
SDS Splinler Groups
About 20 persons identified as
members of the SDS
Worker-Student Alliance were also
present to show support for "the
Arab masses in their struggle
against Israel and the reactionary
Arab regimes" and to protest
French and Israeli imperialism.
Their shouts of "Long Live A 1
Fatah" were all but drowned out
by the pro-Israeli demonstrators.
Four French students and
about five members of another
SDS group, Progressive Labor,
also showed up to protest the
presence of the French President
and to show support for the Arab
states.

Road to SLAC from the Sharon
Heights shopping center. The
demonstration was in full force by
the time the French President
arrived at 9:50 a.m., ten minutes
ahead of schedule.
The demonstrators carried
signs including "Peace is not a
Mirage," "French Honor for
Sale," "Send Pompidou to
Lybia," and "Dreyfus II." Many
of the pro-Israeli demonstrators
appeared to be middle aged or
older.
Israeli and Arab flags were
clearly visible in the crowd.
SDS Splinler Groups
About 20 persons identified as
members of the SDS
Worker-Student Alliance were also
present to show support for "the
Arab masses in their struggle
against Israel and the reactionary
Arab regimes" and to protest
French and Israeli imperialism.
Their shouts of "Long Live A 1
Fatah" were all but drowned out
by the pro-Israeli demonstrators.
Four French students and
about five members of another
SDS group, Progressive Labor,
also showed up to protest the
presence of the French President
and to show support for the Arab
states.
With overwhelming security
precautions in offcct, French
President Georges Pompidou
toured part of Stanford's Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and
met with student and
administration leaders Friday
during a 90-minute visit.
Between 350 and 400
protesters showed up to greet the
French President and his Foreign
Minister, Maurice Shumann. Most
supported the Israeli position in
the Middle East, but about 25
chanted slogans that included
"Long Live Al Fatah" (an Arab
terrorist organization). There were
no incidents.
One hundred fifty heavily
armed and equipped police
officers and deputy sheriffs, from
San Francisco, Marin, Alameda
and San Mateo, kept a close guard
over the French President. The
officers' armaments included
grenade launchers, M-17's, rifles
with telescopic sights, tear gas
guns and masks, riot helmets,
nightsticks and dogs.
Many of the policemen carried
one or more two-way radios, '"he

plainclothesmen also carried
radios and appeared to be wearing
guns underneath their sportcoats.
Officers were stationed around
Pompidou's landing site, on many
roofs, near the main body of
demonstrators, and they followed
him en masse wherever he went.
Numerous police photographers,
some with telephoto lenses and
movie cameras, were on the
roofs with the sharpshooters.
Accelerator Off
The French President spent
about 40 minutes touring the
SLAC complex. He was
accompanied on the tour by
SLAC Director Wolfgang K.H.
Panofsky, Atomic Energy
Commissioner Theos J.
Thompson, and MIT Prof. Victor
Weisskopf, former head ofCERN,
the European center for nuclear
research located in Switzerland.
The $144*million accelerator,
the longest in the world, was shut
down early Friday morning in
preparation for Pompidou's visit,
according to a SLAC spokesman.
The accelerator usually runs for
three weeks and is shut down for
a fourth. A liquid hydrogen target

was in place at the endstation,
where the President visited
briefly.
In the endstation, a seven-story
building, reporters heard
Pompidou ask if men were
allowed in the building while
experiments were being
conducted. Dr. Panofsky replied
that radiation levels were too high
in the building to allow human
occupancy during experiments.
After visiting the accelerator
complex, Pompidou conferred in
private with Panofsky, Thompson,
Weisskopf, Provost Richard
Lyman, Chairman of the Board of
Trustees W. Palmer Fuller 111.
Prof. Gordon Wright, a French
historian, and ASSIJ Council of
Presidents member Pat Shea.
Lyman, who spoke in French,
said that his statement was "a
primer" *and was intended to give
the French President a general
idea of how the campus operates,
the role of the Trustees, and some
fiscal considerations. The other
presentations concerned the
SLAC installation

POMPIDOU PROTKST — As French President Georges Pompidou toured the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center some
200 yards away, between 350 and 100 pro-Israeli demonstrators protested France's Arab support. Protest takes many
forms - among them picketing and folk dancing.
Questions that Pompidou
posed included the ratio of
graduate students to
undergraduates, the number of
lectures as compared to the
number of seminars, and
admissions requirements.
Shea Presents Statement
Lyman said that the French
President was "easygoing, relaxed,
and he seemed to enjoy himself."
Shea presented Pompidou with
a statement, signed by 500
members of the community,
asking the French President to
"reverse the unfair Middle East
policy of your government," to
lift the Israeli arms embargo, and
jaking for peace in the Middle
East.
Shea said that Pompidou
accepted the petition and his
covering letter, but made no
comment.
The ASSU Council of
Presidents member said later that
Pompidou joked with him about
their relative margins of voting
support, and questioned him
about how Stanford students have
implimented curriculum reforms
and innovations working with a
"flexible" university system.
No Demonstrator Contact
The only other student in the
meeting was Jean-Pierre Boudin, a
French student in the Graduate
School of Business.
Pompidou left the meeting
about 11:30 and walked to his
waiting Marine Corps helicopter.
He waved to some employees
gathered near some steps about 20
yards from his aircraft. He
departed SLAC about 11:35 a.m.
to address a luncheon of the
Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco.
The French President never
came into direct contact with the
demonstrators. Most of the
picketing took place about 200
yards from the landing site of the
helicopters, and the noise
generated by the aircrafts' jet

engines overcame much of the
shouting. Pompidou seemed to
ignore the picketers' signs, which
were clearly visible as he looked
down the long lawn that
comprised the landing zone.
Slogans, Signs
A sign reading "Off the Pigs"
was visible through an office
window 30 yards from his aircraft
when the French President
arrived, but was removed before
he returned to his helicopter for
departure.
The earliest demonstrators
arrived about 8 a.m., almost two
hours before Pompidou. Rabbi
Charles Familant, director of the
Hillel Foundation at Stanford, led
a group of 130 sign-waving
persons in a march up Sandhill
Road to SLAC from the Sharon
Heights shopping center. The
demonstration was in full force by
the time the French President

gathered near some steps about 20
yards from his aircraft. He
departed SLAC about 11:35 a.m.
to address a luncheon of the
Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco.
The French President never
came into direct contact with the
demonstrators. Most of the
picketing took place about 200
yards from the landing site of the
helicopters, and the noise
generated by the aircrafts' jet

engines overcame much of the
shouting. Pompidou seemed to
ignore the picketers' signs, which
were clearly visible as he looked
down the long lawn that
comprised the landing zone.
Slogans, Signs
A sign reading "Off the Pigs"
was visible through an office
window 30 yards from his aircraft
when the French President
arrived, but was removed before
he returned to his helicopter for
departure.
The earliest demonstrators
arrived about 8 a.m., almost two
hours before Pompidou. Rabbi
Charles Familant, director of the
Hillel Foundation at Stanford, led
a group of 130 sign-waving
persons in a march up Sandhill
Road to SLAC from the Sharon
Heights shopping center. The
demonstration was in full force by
the time the French President
arrived at 9:50 a.m., ten minutes
ahead of schedule.
The demonstrators carried
signs including "Peace is not a
Mirage," "French Honor for
Sale," "Send Pompidou to
Lybia," and "Dreyfus II." Many
of the pro-Israeli demonstrators
appeared to be middle aged or
older.
Israeli and Arab flags were
clearly visible in the crowd.
SDS Splinler Groups
About 20 persons identified as
members of the SDS
Worker-Student Alliance were also
present to show support for "the
Arab masses in their struggle
against Israel and the reactionary
Arab regimes" and to protest
French and Israeli imperialism.
Their shouts of "Long Live A 1
Fatah" were all but drowned out
by the pro-Israeli demonstrators.
Four French students and
about five members of another
SDS group, Progressive Labor,
also showed up to protest the
presence of the French President
and to show support for the Arab
states.
With overwhelming security
precautions in offcct, French
President Georges Pompidou
toured part of Stanford's Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and
met with student and
administration leaders Friday
during a 90-minute visit.
Between 350 and 400
protesters showed up to greet the
French President and his Foreign
Minister, Maurice Shumann. Most
supported the Israeli position in
the Middle East, but about 25
chanted slogans that included
"Long Live Al Fatah" (an Arab
terrorist organization). There were
no incidents.
One hundred fifty heavily
armed and equipped police
officers and deputy sheriffs, from
San Francisco, Marin, Alameda
and San Mateo, kept a close guard
over the French President. The
officers' armaments included
grenade launchers, M-17's, rifles
with telescopic sights, tear gas
guns and masks, riot helmets,
nightsticks and dogs.
Many of the policemen carried
one or more two-way radios, '"he

plainclothesmen also carried
radios and appeared to be wearing
guns underneath their sportcoats.
Officers were stationed around
Pompidou's landing site, on many
roofs, near the main body of
demonstrators, and they followed
him en masse wherever he went.
Numerous police photographers,
some with telephoto lenses and
movie cameras, were on the
roofs with the sharpshooters.
Accelerator Off
The French President spent
about 40 minutes touring the
SLAC complex. He was
accompanied on the tour by
SLAC Director Wolfgang K.H.
Panofsky, Atomic Energy
Commissioner Theos J.
Thompson, and MIT Prof. Victor
Weisskopf, former head ofCERN,
the European center for nuclear
research located in Switzerland.
The $144*million accelerator,
the longest in the world, was shut
down early Friday morning in
preparation for Pompidou's visit,
according to a SLAC spokesman.
The accelerator usually runs for
three weeks and is shut down for
a fourth. A liquid hydrogen target

was in place at the endstation,
where the President visited
briefly.
In the endstation, a seven-story
building, reporters heard
Pompidou ask if men were
allowed in the building while
experiments were being
conducted. Dr. Panofsky replied
that radiation levels were too high
in the building to allow human
occupancy during experiments.
After visiting the accelerator
complex, Pompidou conferred in
private with Panofsky, Thompson,
Weisskopf, Provost Richard
Lyman, Chairman of the Board of
Trustees W. Palmer Fuller 111.
Prof. Gordon Wright, a French
historian, and ASSIJ Council of
Presidents member Pat Shea.
Lyman, who spoke in French,
said that his statement was "a
primer" *and was intended to give
the French President a general
idea of how the campus operates,
the role of the Trustees, and some
fiscal considerations. The other
presentations concerned the
SLAC installation

POMPIDOU PROTKST — As French President Georges Pompidou toured the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center some
200 yards away, between 350 and 100 pro-Israeli demonstrators protested France's Arab support. Protest takes many
forms - among them picketing and folk dancing.
Questions that Pompidou
posed included the ratio of
graduate students to
undergraduates, the number of
lectures as compared to the
number of seminars, and
admissions requirements.
Shea Presents Statement
Lyman said that the French
President was "easygoing, relaxed,
and he seemed to enjoy himself."
Shea presented Pompidou with
a statement, signed by 500
members of the community,
asking the French President to
"reverse the unfair Middle East
policy of your government," to
lift the Israeli arms embargo, and
jaking for peace in the Middle
East.
Shea said that Pompidou
accepted the petition and his
covering letter, but made no
comment.
The ASSU Council of
Presidents member said later that
Pompidou joked with him about
their relative margins of voting
support, and questioned him
about how Stanford students have
implimented curriculum reforms
and innovations working with a
"flexible" university system.
No Demonstrator Contact
The only other student in the
meeting was Jean-Pierre Boudin, a
French student in the Graduate
School of Business.
Pompidou left the meeting
