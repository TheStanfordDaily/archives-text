## 
### ED KOHN 
With overwhelming security
precautions in offcct, French
President Georges Pompidou
toured part of Stanford's Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and
met with student and
administration leaders Friday
during a 90-minute visit.
Between 350 and 400
protesters showed up to greet the
French President and his Foreign
Minister, Maurice Shumann. Most
supported the Israeli position in
the Middle East, but about 25
chanted slogans that included
"Long Live Al Fatah" (an Arab
terrorist organization). There were
no incidents.
One hundred fifty heavily
armed and equipped police
officers and deputy sheriffs, from
San Francisco, Marin, Alameda
and San Mateo, kept a close guard
over the French President. The
officers' armaments included
grenade launchers, M-17's, rifles
with telescopic sights, tear gas
guns and masks, riot helmets,
nightsticks and dogs.
Many of the policemen carried
one or more two-way radios, '"he

plainclothesmen also carried
radios and appeared to be wearing
guns underneath their sportcoats.
Officers were stationed around
Pompidou's landing site, on many
roofs, near the main body of
demonstrators, and they followed
him en masse wherever he went.
Numerous police photographers,
some with telephoto lenses and
movie cameras, were on the
roofs with the sharpshooters.
Accelerator Off
The French President spent
about 40 minutes touring the
SLAC complex. He was
accompanied on the tour by
SLAC Director Wolfgang K.H.
Panofsky, Atomic Energy
Commissioner Theos J.
Thompson, and MIT Prof. Victor
Weisskopf, former head ofCERN,
the European center for nuclear
research located in Switzerland.
The $144*million accelerator,
the longest in the world, was shut
down early Friday morning in
preparation for Pompidou's visit,
according to a SLAC spokesman.
The accelerator usually runs for
three weeks and is shut down for
a fourth. A liquid hydrogen target

was in place at the endstation,
where the President visited
briefly.
In the endstation, a seven-story
building, reporters heard
Pompidou ask if men were
allowed in the building while
experiments were being
conducted. Dr. Panofsky replied
that radiation levels were too high
in the building to allow human
occupancy during experiments.
After visiting the accelerator
complex, Pompidou conferred in
private with Panofsky, Thompson,
Weisskopf, Provost Richard
Lyman, Chairman of the Board of
Trustees W. Palmer Fuller 111.
Prof. Gordon Wright, a French
historian, and ASSIJ Council of
Presidents member Pat Shea.
Lyman, who spoke in French,
said that his statement was "a
primer" *and was intended to give
the French President a general
idea of how the campus operates,
the role of the Trustees, and some
fiscal considerations. The other
presentations concerned the
SLAC installation
