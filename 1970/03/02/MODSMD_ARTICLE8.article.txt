# One Man's Fantasy
## Messiahs And Revolution 
### Nick Selby 
"So Satan went forth from the
presence of the Lord, and
afflicted Job with loathesome
sores from the sole of his foot to
the crown of his head. And he
took a potsherd with which to
scrape himself, and sat among the
ashes."
-Job, 2:6-7.
Thinking I might escape the
crush of humanity, foul air, putrid
waters, and incessant noise that so
afflict the Bay area, I sought
refuse this last weekend in the
hills and mountains in the
northern part of California.
In what I admit is quite akin to
the "liberal's" despair, I seem to
find that the only way for me to
survive the insanities of life at and
around Stanford is to get away,
books in hand, as fast as possible
each weekend.
So Much to Run From
There is so much to run away
from: the president of the
University announces the
supremely ill-logic that he can
help "save" the university's
finances by permitting ROTC to
survive here, the pious radicals
scream "Off the Pig!" and dance
over dead cops, feeling that a
Daily lament over death or the
tragedy of being forced, society
offering no better alternatives, to
become a policeman is a sell-out
to the establishment.
Both forces, in effect, proclaim
to me that I can save the
university by destroying it, which
is of course the same brilliantly
insidious reasoning of the fool

generals in Vietnam, or what is
left of it after our B-52 visitations.
So much to run from: deep in
the forest I need not worry about
the fact that at least half of the
world's children are deformed and
retarded by protein malnutrition;
I don't have to breathe the
pollution, that we supply, to the
rest of the world.
There, with no television or
radio to remind me, I readily
forget the Nixon bullshit about
"his plans" to end the draft and
pull-out from the war. There is no
Melvin Laird, or David Packard
gloating over profits, to announce
more missile sites after HEW
vetoes. No Strom Thurmonds, no
Howard Brooks, no Dillinghams,
no Vietnams. Escape.
I doubt very strongly that the
Lord or Satan even bothered to
dicker over my soul, it being
already quite lost. Nature
answered by herself, with a stern,
near automatic response:
"You and your fellows are my
sonsâ€”l have spawned you and
protected you, given you sight to
soar into the blue above, given
you the knowledge to appreciate
and love all the earth and my
creatures around you. You have
betrayed me and must suffer."
For truly, we are nature's
brain-child run amuck, God's
wonder gone to hell, infants
obsessed, running headlong
towards disaster.
Oh, For No Competition
How I wish, as does the
anonymous writer of the reply to

the Daily's editorial last week,
that there were finally no
competition or capitalism, no
Appalachias or "moldy nursing
homes," no botched abortions or
extortions by "imperialist
oppressors" of the Third World.
How I wish this would all
disappear.
But we all know that it is
nowhere near enough to merely
wish to talk or write replies to
Daily editorials or even to
radicalize the "upper middle class
myopians" of Stanford.
Stanford is maybe only a little
more important in the giant
framework of the global
Establishment than Harvard or
Penn or MIT or thousands of
other places where defense work
is going on here and in other
countries. And the much heralded
"domino theory" advanced by
radicals that a defeat of Defense
Department strategies at Stanford
or MIT would set off a giant chain
of similar DOD setbacks around
the world has simply not come to
pass.
A Long Time Coming
Radicals have promised that
"the era of revolution has begun."
They have limitless faith in the
masses, many of whom in the
United States abhor all that they
stand for, as last summer proved
when SDS tried to organize
factories etc. Yet they promise.
Yes, the revolution has been a
"long time coming," and it may
indeed come, but then again, the
revolution may never come at all.
Very few brilliant leaders or
tactics, if any have appeared.
Who will the people follow?
And, injustly, those leaders
who have promised brilliance have
been gunned down or locked up.
It may well be the greatest
delusion to think that Nixon and
Mitchell, with their untold legions
of helmeted enforcers, could not
do here exactly what Franco in
Spain and Papadoupolos in Greece
have already done to radicals and
dissidents the bombings of police
stations notwithstanding.
'Where Shall Wisdom Be Found? 1
The most amazing thing about
Job, in all his suffering, is that he
somehow is able to rise above the
misery he feels. "Surely there is a
mine for silver, and a place for
gold which they refine," he tells
us. "But where shall wisdom be
found? And where is the place of
understanding?"
Centuries after he first spoke,
Job's questions still haunt us.
Where is the revolutionary
messiah who will bring us peace
and freedom? Is there true
wisdom in fighting against what
appears to be certain doom?
You see, the radicals fervently
hope that what has never been
may someday be. But as ecologists
warn us, the time for achieving
their utopia is fast running out.
What has never been may never
get a chance. And there shall be
no escape from that last sunet.
