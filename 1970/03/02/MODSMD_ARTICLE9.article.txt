## Not Today 
### 
For 17 months now, the Stanford ROTC program has
been tossed from committee to faculty to administration to
Washington and back again. Today the Academic Council
will once more tackle the tricky philosophical and practical
issues involved, and arrange to resolve them immediately or
by mail ballot. It is preparing to set an important
relationship with the military for the foreseeable future, and
a precedent for universities around the country.
Despite the tedious months of preparation for this policy
choice, Stanford is by no means prepared to reach a
decision on the ROTC proposals today. The discovery of a
substantially different ROTC plan at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (see page one) convinces us that the
Academic Council does not have all options before it.
As confirmed by two members of the MIT ROTC
committee, the three military services are prepared to
accept a ROTC program with no courses taught by military
personnel and no credit given unless a course is approved by
a university department.
When compared to the plan before the Stanford
Academic Council, the MIT arrangement is much closer to
the faculty Senate and Academic Council decisions of last
spring. It more nearly fulfills the desire to eliminate credit
and to maximize University control over courses.
In other words, Stanford has been short-changed.
The Academic Council should not vote on ROTC today.
Rather it should take two steps toward re-negotiation of the
Stanford ROTC proposal.
First, it should recommend establishment of a second
Presidential Advisory Committee to work out the details of
the ROTC program. Unlike its predecessor, this committee
should include representatives of strong anti-ROTC views
among students. And, it should respect the original "no
credit" wish of the faculty.
Second, the Council should request tough bargaining by
Stanford representatives with the Defense Department.
Stanford should hammer out a proposal which is as close to
last spring's policy as the military will come. Then, with all
possibilities before it, the Council should make its final
decision.
To decide the status of ROTC today, without all the
cards on the table, is foolish for Stanford. Scholars, of all
people, should recognize the necessity of digging out all the
faCtS " —M.E.W.
