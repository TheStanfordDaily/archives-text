# Guidelines Set For Undergrad Specials
## 
### 
Future undergraduate special
courses will be given credit on the
basis of a 10-point set of
guidelines issued by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
According to the Committee,
undergraduate specials are
"intended to enable students,
faculty and qualified staff to
explore areas of interest that,
while properly academic, have not
yet found their place in the
standard academic curriculum."
Mark Mancall, CUS chairman,
estimates that his committee
receives more than 150 course
proposals annually. The new
guidelines have been established
to strengthen faculty guidance for
courses they sponsor, develop
more student evaluation of the
experimental offerings, and "raise
the intellectual level of the
'specials' to insure their value to
the student and their contribution
as an innovative teaching
experience."
Possible ROTC Consideration
ROTC course accreditation,
approved by the Academic
Council and now under discussion
by the Academic Senate, will be
evaluated by the new guidelines if
the Academic Council approval is
not reversed.
Committee guidelines state
that applications for
undergraduate special course
credit will be judged "in terms of
their demonstration of the
intellectual and academic merit of

the proposed course, which will
include the definition of the
course topic, the quality and
thoroughness of its reading list,
validity of its research
methodology (where research is
involved), and the qualifications
of the principal instructor(s)."
Concerning an ROTC course
evaluation Chairman Mancall said,
"The committee has no thoughts
on its own. We all, of course, have
our personal feelings on the
matter." Sponsors for
undergraduate specials are
required to be members of
Academic Council standing, and
since ROTC professors by the
recent decision will be removed
from Academic Council standing
they will have to find other
faculty members to sponsor their
courses.
