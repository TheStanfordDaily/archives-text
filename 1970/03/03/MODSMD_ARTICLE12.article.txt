Your Finest
Editor, THE DAILY:
Congratulations to the Daily
on your finest editorial of the
year (Off the Rhetoric, Fri. Feb.
20), in which you deplore the
depersonalization latent in the
mindless chanting of insulting
slogans and the labeling of all
those with whom one disagrees
with an all-embracing catch
phrase.
It is rather surprising, on a
University campus, to see students
fall so easily into the mistake of
dividing everyone into two
groups; us and them. That is,
everyone is given a label
("fascist", "filthy hippy",
"racist", etc) on the basis of a few
superficial characteristics (length
of hair, color of skin, and so on)
and is expected to then behave as
the stereotype of his group. Our
group, by definition, is always
right â€” therefore they must be
always wrong.
There are two results of this
process. One is the
depersonalization that the
editorial refers to. People are
judged, not on their personal
qualities and individual merit, but

on the basis of the group
stereotype that has been assigned
to them. This unthinking
intolerance is quite out of place in
an academic community. The
second result is arrogance. "We"
have a monopoly on the truth so
what is the use of talking to
"you". 1 am sure that it is not
necessary for me to list examples
of these tendencies, but two of
the columns on tne same page as
Friday's editorial are good
instances.

No one would deny that the
issues being raised at present on
campus are matters of great
importance but it is saddening to
see discussion of these issues
reduced to name calling and guilt
by association. Surely,
commitment to a cause can still
be reconciled with tolerance,
humility and love, together with a
willingness to treat one's
opponents as individuals, each
with his own mixture of values.
