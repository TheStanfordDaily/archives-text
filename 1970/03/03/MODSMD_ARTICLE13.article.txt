# Non-random Selection?
## A 						Frat Fan 
### Bob Sader 
Last Feb. 26, the Daily printed a feature article written by a
fraternity brother of mine, Ralph Petersen. Ralph's article attacked
the non-random selection process of most Stanford fraternities as
"housing discrimination" and urged the University to make long range
plans to bring "...these houses under the University draw, or some
other ramdom selection system..."
Ralph raises some good questions. But his solution disturbs me. To
completely abolish the selection policies of fraternities would, I fear,
within a few years destroy those organizations at Stanford.
Don't Die!
I know this is an attractive thought to many people in our
community, but suffice it to say that there are many of us on this
campus that like living in our fraternities very much. We don't want to
see them die!
Many fraternities at Stanford are full, or over capacity every year.
Many function as strong and viable organizations that fulfill the needs
of their members for close personal associations and interesting group
activities, needs that they found unfulfilled in dormitories. The other
houses, the ones that are debt-ridden and unable to fill their quotas of
members, will quickly die unless they are able to solve their problems.
They cannot meet financial obligations long enough or retain sufficent
group spirit to last more than a couple of years.
No Commitment
How, then, do you create a close living group, dedicated to
common ideals and positively committed to close bonds of friendship,
if students are thrown together in a random draw? A random draw
requires no commitment to the group. The advantages of fraternities
to those that accept their ideals far outweigh the disadvantages of
non-random selection.
Moreover, it disturbs me to be called discriminatory because I want
to select my own friends. Who doesn't actively choose his own
companions? We are not talking about discrimination as to race or
religion; we are talking about selecting the people you like and feel
will make active contributions to your organization. It has something
to do with the right of personal preference.
Equal Opportunity
If, because of the random draw fraternities die at Stanford because
they are unable to sustain a consistency in ideals and a commitment
to brotherhood, then hasn't the University's denied that alternative to
its students? Is that equal opportunity?
Finally, this whole issue of non-random selection has been pushed
grossly out of proportion. In the actual decision-making process
during rush, there are very few rushes ever flatly rejected because they
are unacceptable to the house.
Why should the University deny the fraternities that remain solvent
and viable the right to pursue their ideals? If someone can produce a
workable plan to replace the selection process that will insure placing
a student in a fraternity that he wants and that wants him, it would,
I'm sure, be readily accepted.

members, will quickly die unless they are able to solve their problems.
They cannot meet financial obligations long enough or retain sufficent
group spirit to last more than a couple of years.
No Commitment
How, then, do you create a close living group, dedicated to
common ideals and positively committed to close bonds of friendship,
if students are thrown together in a random draw? A random draw
requires no commitment to the group. The advantages of fraternities
to those that accept their ideals far outweigh the disadvantages of
non-random selection.
Moreover, it disturbs me to be called discriminatory because I want
to select my own friends. Who doesn't actively choose his own
companions? We are not talking about discrimination as to race or
religion; we are talking about selecting the people you like and feel
will make active contributions to your organization. It has something
to do with the right of personal preference.
Equal Opportunity
If, because of the random draw fraternities die at Stanford because
they are unable to sustain a consistency in ideals and a commitment
to brotherhood, then hasn't the University's denied that alternative to
its students? Is that equal opportunity?
Finally, this whole issue of non-random selection has been pushed
grossly out of proportion. In the actual decision-making process
during rush, there are very few rushes ever flatly rejected because they
are unacceptable to the house.
Why should the University deny the fraternities that remain solvent
and viable the right to pursue their ideals? If someone can produce a
workable plan to replace the selection process that will insure placing
a student in a fraternity that he wants and that wants him, it would,
I'm sure, be readily accepted.
Last Feb. 26, the Daily printed a feature article written by a
fraternity brother of mine, Ralph Petersen. Ralph's article attacked
the non-random selection process of most Stanford fraternities as
"housing discrimination" and urged the University to make long range
plans to bring "...these houses under the University draw, or some
other ramdom selection system..."
Ralph raises some good questions. But his solution disturbs me. To
completely abolish the selection policies of fraternities would, I fear,
within a few years destroy those organizations at Stanford.
Don't Die!
I know this is an attractive thought to many people in our
community, but suffice it to say that there are many of us on this
campus that like living in our fraternities very much. We don't want to
see them die!
Many fraternities at Stanford are full, or over capacity every year.
Many function as strong and viable organizations that fulfill the needs
of their members for close personal associations and interesting group
activities, needs that they found unfulfilled in dormitories. The other
houses, the ones that are debt-ridden and unable to fill their quotas of
members, will quickly die unless they are able to solve their problems.
They cannot meet financial obligations long enough or retain sufficent
group spirit to last more than a couple of years.
