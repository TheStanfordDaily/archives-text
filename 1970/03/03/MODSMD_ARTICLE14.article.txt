# Associate Dean Cites Need For Area Health Centers
## 
### MARILYN MORRIS 
"University medical schools
have succeeded brilliantly in the
hospitals but failed in the
community. They have been a
model of withdrawal."
The critic is Dr. Count D.
Gibson, Jr., Stanford's Associate
Dean for Community Health
Programs and Chairman of the
Department for Community and
Preventative Medicine.
Despite having the sanguine
aspect of a young W.C. Fields,
Gibson's indictment of University
hospitals is strong. Stanford's
virtuosic heart transplants,
however dramatic, have not
remedied the problems of drug
abuse, pollution, family relations,
alcoholism, and high infant death
rate, he points out.
Formerly of Tufts, Gibson
helped establish pioneer
neighborhood health centers at
both ends of the North-South
migration chain: in Bolivar
County, Mississippi, and in
Boston. Upon a proposal to the
Office of Economic Opportunity,
his work became the model for a
national program now comprising
51 such centers.
"Whereas the hospital is a crisis
center," he explains, "these
centers try to provide
comprehensive primary
care —health maintenance—uniting
the related disciplines of
medicine, law and sociology."

The focus of Gibson's work at
Stanford will be the low-income
black and chicano communities of
East Palo Alto, Alviso and King
City working with such center's.
Finances Crucial
Finances arc crucial. A subtler
problem than medical care for the
destitute is the lower middle class
caught in a limbo of inability to

qualify for federal aid yet unable
to assume the full burden of
medical bills. Accordingly, the
financial program of the health
centers is progressive, moving
gradually from 0.E.0. funding
toward a pre-paid program
whereby community residents pay
a monthly premium
Thus as low-income areas
approach middle-class status, they
can still partake of low cost health
care. "Affluence should not
determine a patient's right to
receive medical attention," says
Gibson.
To change the university's
ethos to that of discreet advisor is
Gibson's aim "My first task is to
develop confidence and credibility
in my program. University
colonialism must yield to
autonomous control," he said.
But, though the three centers hire
their own doctors, there is a
lingering suspicion of "academic
investigators," who invade the
community's privacy for research.
Between the two extremes of
neglect and paternalism Gibson
sees Stanford's ideal role as "a
partnership"an exchange of the
University's technical skill for the
community's intimate knowledge
of existing problems and past
inadequacies of professionalism.
The medium of exchange is the
Stanford Medical School
Community Health Council which
brings together faculty, students,
and lay citizens.
Gibson speaks of the Stanford
community health program as
though outlining a
prospectus—with tentative reserve.
"Our emphasis," he says, "is on
the 'try. ".

GlBSON:—Stanford's role should be to
form a "partnership" with tin- black
and chicano communities in setting up
health centers, he believes.
