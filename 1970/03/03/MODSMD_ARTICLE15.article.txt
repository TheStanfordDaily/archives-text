# Beirut Exchange Making Selection
## 
### 
The Stanford-American
University of Beirut exchange
program is presently in the
process of making selection for
the 1970-71 school year. Since
1964 Stanford has been sending
one student to study for an
academic year at the American
University of Beirut while a
student from the Lebanese
campus has studied here.
Though the Lebanese
university is both American in
administrative form and general
curriculum, "one of its major
assets," according to Bob Phillips,
one of the exchange's first
participants, "is the diversity of
racial, religious and cultural
backgrounds. Of a total student
body of about 3600, less than 200
are Americans and the rest come
from more than 65 countries and
20 religious backgrounds."
Another participant wrote
while on the exchange, "Lebanon
is a most interesting setting for
the Stanford exchange." In
practically every generalization
about the Middle East, Lebanon is
the exception. But it is by no

means unimportant." The
beginnings of Arab nationalism
can be traced to Lebanon, and
Lebanon stands as a traditional
mediating force in inter-Arab
disputes. Lebanon provides a vital
link between the Arab and
Western worlds.
Regarding the exchange itself,
the fluency of most Lebanese in
English and French as well as
Arabic allows for contact between
the Stanford student and the
people, as well a greater
opportunity for personal
exploration of the country.
The American University of
Beirut is situated on a hill along
the coast of the Mediterranean
Sea. It is in the heart of Lebanon's
capital and thus the Stanford
student is by no means isolated
from the non-university
community. All instruction at
AUB is in English and credits are
easily transferable to Stanford.
The main qualification for
participation in the Beirut
program is a student's interest in
and willingness to take advantage
of an opportunity for cultural
exchange. Graduate and
undergraduate, male and female
students are eligible. Applications
for the program are available in
the upstairs office of the
International Center and must be
completed by April 3. A general
information meeting to further
acquaint interested students with
the program and answer any
questions will be held on Tuesday,
March 10, at 8:00 p.m. in the
Small Lounge of TMU.
