Tonight at 7:30 at the First
Presbyterian Church in Palo Alto
a woman from the Black Panther
Party will speak on women's
liberation. Some views were
formerly expressed by Panther
women on the subject.
"I think it's important that
within the context of the struggle
that black men understand that
their manhood is not dependent
on keeping their black women
subordinate to them because this
is what bourgeois ideology has
been trying to put into the black
man and that's part of the special
oppression of black women. Black
women, as generally a part of the
poor people of the U.S.—the
working class—are more
oppressed; as being black, they're
super-oppressed; and as being
women, they are sexually
oppressed by men in general and
by black men also," a Panther
pamphlet said.
"The contradiction between
men and women is a contradiction
that has to be worked out within
the revolutionary forces. It is not
at all comparable to the class
contradictions. It's the class
struggle that takes priority," it
said.
