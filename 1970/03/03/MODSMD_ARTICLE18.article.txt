# Ram's Head Opens Its Spring Season
## 
### 
Ram's Head comes out with its
winter collection of one-act plays
in its Evening of One Acts,
showing March 4-7 at the Nitery.
Produced by Sally Zeimer, this
trio of works runs a wide gamut
of subject and style.
The "Apollo fo Bellac," by
Jean Giradoux, shows how a
woman can succeed in business
without really trying. By
comparing men to Apollo, a shy
girl starts with a clerk and ends
with the chairman of the board.
Director of this work is Jay
Morse.

In a different Vein is Tennessee
Williams' 27 Wagons Full of
Cotton," directed by Teri Brown.
This tells the tale of a man who
attempted to destroy a big ginning
company which threatened to
displace him. Tradegy strikes him
doubly when he loses his wife to
the foreman of the company.
The third play, A.A. Milne's,
"The Ugly Duckling," is the story
of a not-so-handsome prince
meeting and marrying a
not-so-beautiful princess. In this
piece, directed by Catherine
Ribinick, all live happily ever
after, but not until the king,
queen, chamberlain, and several
servants get involved.
