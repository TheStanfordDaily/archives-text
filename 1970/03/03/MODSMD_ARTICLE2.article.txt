# Santa Barbara Riot: Students Or Police?
## 
### WILLIAM CHATFIELD 
An uneasy peace hangs over
the streets of the Santa Barbara
campus.
Classes will continue for the
13,000 students in attendance
there, but along the main streets
of the community of Isla Vista,
the windows of realty companies
stay boarded, and the Bank of
America branch office lies in
ruins. Thirty-four of the 119
protestors arrested during last
week's demonstrations and curfew
remain in jail.
What happened in Santa
Barbara last week surprised not
only the police, who were not
prepared for riot control, mutual
aid, and other tactics commonly
used by Bay Area law
enforcement, but also the
demonstrators who have few
resources and little experience in
providing bail and legal aid for
themselves. As a result, a full third
of those arrested are unable to put
up the average $1250 bond
required to release each
individual.
Jail Conditions
Some of those demonstrators
released on bail have reported that
they were beaten and mistreated
by police, most commonly while
being held awaiting booking. In
addition, there is little food for
the prisoners, no visitors are
allowed, and a few of the
demonstrators have been placed in
solitary confinement.
According to El Gaucho, the
student newspaper at the
University of California at Santa
Barbara (UCSB), wire service
stories of what happened last
week have been misleading.

"The newspapers have been
very bad," complained one
reporter. "They've made it seem
very bad," complained another
reporter. "They've made it seem
like Kunstler's (the Chicago Seven
attorney who spoke at UCSB last
week) speech set the whole thing
off, and that's not how it
happened."
In two telephone conversations
this weekend, El Gaucho reporters
explained what actually occurred
in the student community of Isla
Vista.
On Tuesday afternoon of last
week, a police car stopped a
youth named Lefty Bryant on the
street. Mistaking him for someone
else, they attempted to pick him
up on charges that had been filed
earlier. He resisted arrest, and his
friends tried to prevent the police
from taking him away.
In the ensuing struggle, the
tires of the police car were

slashed, some gasoline was poured
under the car and lit, and two of
Bryant's friends also were
arrested.
That evening a group of
students from the Isla Vista
community gathered to protest
the arrest and subsequent
treatment of Bryant and his
friends. Reports circulated that
the youths were beaten and
mistreated on the way to jail. The
people gathered in the street
moved to the Bank of America
and stoned its windows.
El Gaucho spokesmen felt that the
bank was chosen as a target for
both local and political reasons:
rude service and the bank's
support of the War and grape
growers. The attack on the
bank occurred before Kunstler
arrived on the UCSB campus. On
Wednesday afternoon the
attorney spoke before a crowd of
5000 students and after his speech
the crowd dispersed into small
groups.
Police Watch
The Santa Barbara police were
keeping watch on the crowd from
squad cars circling the area. At
one point, they entered a group
and arrested a youth for carrying
a jug of wine.
This arrest enraged the group
and bystanders and students and
young people began throwing
stones and bricks at the police
cars which continued to circle the
area.
As the number of people in the
street began to diminish, however,
the police started to return. Once
again bricks and rocks were
thrown at their cars, and again as
the crowd grew, the police were
forced to leave Isla Vista.
Bank Razed
Later that evening, several
demonstrators broke through the
boarded windows of the Bank of
America, dragged its furniture
outside, and set it on fire. The
flames spread to the building
itself, and within 50 minutes, it
was razed.
The crowd also travelled up
and down the streets of Isla Vista
smashing the front windows of
the local realty companies. TheiJ
Gaucho explained that over the
past two months UCSB students
have attempted to negotiate lower
rents and damage deposits with
the companies, but have been
refused.
On Thursday Governor Reagan
ordered the National Guard in to
the community, and announced a
6 p.m. curfew, and several
"sweep" arrests were made
Thursday afternoon, picking up
students shopping in the area.
