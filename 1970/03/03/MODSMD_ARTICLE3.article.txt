# Cadets On Committee
## More ROTC Questions 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
Ten persons - President
Kenneth Pitzer, Vice-Provost
Howard Brooks, and the eight
members of the President's
Advisory Committee - controlled
the implementation of last
February's Faculty Senate
decision to remove credit for
"participation in programs of
military training and education."

Of the ten, four opposed the
Senate's action and three thought
it went too far.
Pitzer's and Brook's doubts
about last year's decision are
probably the most interesting and
were undoubtedly the most
influential in altering it - this will
be covered in future articles.
Here, attention will be focused
on the attitudes of the members
of the advisory committee,
especially the student members, as
they worked to implement the
Senate's action.
Two of the three students on
the Advisory Committee are
ROTC cadets. Chairman Alan
Manneand Professor Lyman Van
Slyke, the two dissenters from the
com mitt's recommendations,
criticized this makeup.
Representation Unfair
Van Slyke said, "Have you
investigated the student
representation on committee yet?
You know there were two ROTC
cadets and the third student is
engaged to a cadet. I just think
that kind of representation is
completely unfair."
Just what those appointment
procedures were still remains in
doubt, however. Council of
Presidents member John Grube
recollects that he made the
appointments in his role as
chairman of the Committee on
Nominations of the Legislature of
the ASSU.
Appointments Unclear
But knowledgeable members of
that committee, Faye Armstrong
and John Wooten, claim they
were never involved in the
deliberations, Grube never
attended any of their meetings,
and he was never on the
committee.
Grube acknowledges that he
knew that William Blanchard and
Dan Caldwell were in ROTC, but
said, "They knew the organization
well. The appointments given the
applicant pool were the best
possible.
Wanted Charge
"You can make all sorts of
innuendos," he continued, "but
they all had some very good ideas.
They all wanted change and had
some ideas on what could be
done."
Both Blanchard and Caldwell
confirmed Grube's claim that they
wanted changes, but their
statements indicate that they both
opposed the Senate's decision on

the crucial academic credit issue.
Caldwell, who occupies the
normal Senior position in ROTC
of a battalion officer and squad
leader, thinks any criticism of his
place on the committee is judging
guilt as association." He denies
any conflict of interest in his role.
Some Changes
Caldwell began his committee
work with the conception that
"there needed to be some
changes," but he disagreed with
the Senate decision on credit. "I
basically thought some form of
ROTC had a place as a credit
activity," he said.
Graduate student Blanchard, a
commissioned first Lieutenant,
emphasizes the same points. "My
particular viewpoint is that some
of the courses were valid enough
to have credit," he said.

the Senate decision on credit. "I
basically thought some form of
ROTC had a place as a credit
activity," he said.
Graduate student Blanchard, a
commissioned first Lieutenant,
emphasizes the same points. "My
particular viewpoint is that some
of the courses were valid enough
to have credit," he said.

ROTC DEBATED—Aiiti-ROTC protester John Shoch hands President Kenneth
PUiter a copy of the recent issue of Chaparral, which strongly opposed ROTC.
President Pitzer had no comment at the pre-meeting "revolutionary greeting."
Ten persons - President
Kenneth Pitzer, Vice-Provost
Howard Brooks, and the eight
members of the President's
Advisory Committee - controlled
the implementation of last
February's Faculty Senate
decision to remove credit for
"participation in programs of
military training and education."

Of the ten, four opposed the
Senate's action and three thought
it went too far.
Pitzer's and Brook's doubts
about last year's decision are
probably the most interesting and
were undoubtedly the most
influential in altering it - this will
be covered in future articles.
Here, attention will be focused
on the attitudes of the members
of the advisory committee,
especially the student members, as
they worked to implement the
Senate's action.
Two of the three students on
the Advisory Committee are
ROTC cadets. Chairman Alan
Manneand Professor Lyman Van
Slyke, the two dissenters from the
com mitt's recommendations,
criticized this makeup.
Representation Unfair
Van Slyke said, "Have you
investigated the student
representation on committee yet?
You know there were two ROTC
cadets and the third student is
engaged to a cadet. I just think
that kind of representation is
completely unfair."
Just what those appointment
procedures were still remains in
doubt, however. Council of
Presidents member John Grube
recollects that he made the
appointments in his role as
chairman of the Committee on
Nominations of the Legislature of
the ASSU.
Appointments Unclear
But knowledgeable members of
that committee, Faye Armstrong
and John Wooten, claim they
were never involved in the
deliberations, Grube never
attended any of their meetings,
and he was never on the
committee.
Grube acknowledges that he
knew that William Blanchard and
Dan Caldwell were in ROTC, but
said, "They knew the organization
well. The appointments given the
applicant pool were the best
possible.
Wanted Charge
"You can make all sorts of
innuendos," he continued, "but
they all had some very good ideas.
They all wanted change and had
some ideas on what could be
done."
Both Blanchard and Caldwell
confirmed Grube's claim that they
wanted changes, but their
statements indicate that they both
opposed the Senate's decision on

the crucial academic credit issue.
Caldwell, who occupies the
normal Senior position in ROTC
of a battalion officer and squad
leader, thinks any criticism of his
place on the committee is judging
guilt as association." He denies
any conflict of interest in his role.
Some Changes
Caldwell began his committee
work with the conception that
"there needed to be some
changes," but he disagreed with
the Senate decision on credit. "I
basically thought some form of
ROTC had a place as a credit
activity," he said.
Graduate student Blanchard, a
commissioned first Lieutenant,
emphasizes the same points. "My
