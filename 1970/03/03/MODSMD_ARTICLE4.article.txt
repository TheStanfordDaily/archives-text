admitted to "some surprise that
two ROTC members were on the
committee. But Blanchard denied
that the committee was stacked,
while Caldwell reluctantly
acknowledged: "It obviously was
not indicative of the entire
student body."
Third Student
The third student member of
the committee is junior Carol
Roesch. Though engaged to a
ROTC member, Roesch
vehemently denies this
involvement had any effect on her
actions.
While she maintains that she
was in general agreement with last
February's decision she
emphasized that she thought it
went too far on the credit issue.
"Why screw all of those
students?" she asked. "Frankly a
lot of students would be screwed
up the wall, and in the process the
only liberalizing force in the army
would be lost."
Throughout the deliberations
of the Advisory Committee, the
academic credit issue was
consistently described as the
"crunch issue." Nevertheless, all
three students disagreed to some
extent with this part of the
decision they were
implementing.â€”and two of the
members had what could be
generally described as conflicts of
interest.
