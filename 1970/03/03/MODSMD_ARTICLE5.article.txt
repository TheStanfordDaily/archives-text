# No Law Suit Action Claims Conservative

Free Campus Movement (FCM)
leader Harvey H. Hukari, Jr., said
yesterday afternoon that
Monday's Daily article about a
proposed $2 million court suit,
listing him as one of eight
plaintiffs, was "somebody's
speculation compounded with
rumors."
The Daily obtained
information about the proposed
suit from conversations held with
Hocker and other informed
sources who prefer not to be
named. Hukari and other
officials attended a weekend
conference in Los Angeles and
were unavailable for comment on
the matter before press time on
Sunday.
Hukari stated that "we are not
having a press conference
tomorrow (Tuesday)." He added
that "announcement of legal plans
will be made during the first or
second week of Spring Quarter."
He said that a final decision to
sue the University had not been
reached, that the amount of such
a suit had not been set, and that
no plans for distribution of I he

possible award had been made.
Hukari said that he has never
heard of the "newly-created
Robert A. Taft memorial
scholarship fund."
The FCM leader said that the
"Stanford Eight," who are now all
members of the "libertarian"
organization, has retained three
lawyers and has two law students
working as research aides. He said
that one of the lawyers met with
University officials the week
before last, but that no decisions
were reached.
Hukari said that the attorneys
were investigating the possibility
of obtaining a "court order
against the University that would
compel the University to protect
the civil rights of all students."
"None of this report has any
basis in fact," he said. Hukari
added that Chris Hocker, a
freshman and member of the
Stanford Eight who was quoted in
the story, had not attended the
last meeting of the group and that
he had not met at all with the
lawyers. "He's not really sure of
what's point: on," Hukari said.
