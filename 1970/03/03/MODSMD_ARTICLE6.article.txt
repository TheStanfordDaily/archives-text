# Faculty Decides On Mail Vote For ROTC
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The Academic Council
overwhelmingly decided yesterday
to submit the review of the
faculty Senate decision on Army
ROTC to a mail ballot of the
entire faculty.
After a "revolutionary
greeting" by anti-ROTC forces
outside Dinkelspiel Auditorium
and two hours of debate at the
meeting, the 300 faculty members
affirmed by voice vote that those
members not present should have
an opportunity to vote on an issue
as important as ROTC.
Academic Secretary H. Donald
Winbigler said that he would mail
out the ballots "promptly." Based
on prior mail ballots, Winbigler
had indicated before the meeting
that the balloting would take
approximately three weeks to
complete in order to allow faculty
overseas to vote.
The faculty will vote on
approving or disapproving the
Senate's decision of January 22,
1970 on ROTC. That decision
would allow limited credit for
Army ROTC courses provided
they are approved by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
If the faculty disapproves the
action, it would restore the prior
decisions of the Academic Council
and Senate made in 1969
regarding ROTC. These denied all
credit strictly an extra-curricular
activity, and recommended that
the punitive clauses involving
enlisted service be removed from
individual student's contracts.
KZSU Tape
In an unprecedented move,
radio station KZSU was allowed
to tape the entire proceedings of
the Council meeting for future
broadcast. KZSU will broadcast
the entire meeting at 7 p.m.
tonight.
Pierre Noyes, professor at
SLAC, began the debate with a
claim that the faculty Senate
voted the way it did because the
no credit decision of last year had
not proved acceptable to forces
outside the Council.
Noyes said that our military
institutions "are responsible,
directly or indirectly, for close to
a million deaths of an alien
population of distinct ethnic
character, which comes perilously
close to genocide." He said that
by "refusing to allow ROTC an
official place in our institution"
Stanford would severe its
associations with this genocide.
Two professors spoke in favor
of the Senate action during the
debate. Professor Philip
Rhinelander of philosophy and
humanities defended the
humanistic element ROTC injects
in the military and said that a vote
for the proposal did not mean
that one supports the Vietnam
war.

Thomas Ehrlich, professor of
law, stated that although he didn't
know if the scheme would work,
he felt it was worth a try for a
one-year trial period with an
evaluation at the end.
Professor William Clebsch,
chairman of the faculty Senate,
said after the meeting that "the
main issue is that there has been
no one to spell out the
discrepancy or agreement between
the Senate's 1969 action and the
1970 one." He said that it was
largely a matter of individual
interpretation.
Yesterday's report in the Daily
regarding the MIT plan for credit
for ROTC courses brought varied
reaction from the council. Clebsh
said that some members of the
Council feel that the main
difference between the MIT plan
and the Stanford plan is that there
has never been a means for getting
credit at MIT other than through
the departments.
MIT Like Stanford
Professor Stephen Kline,
mechanical engineering, said after
talking with a colleague at MIT,
that MlT's plan sounds very
similar to what we're
(Stanford) doing. . .So far they
seem to have a little more faculty
involvement."
According to Kline, both
programs require some faculty

participation. Stanford courses
approved by the CUS must be
sponsored by a regular faculty
member, and at MIT there is close
faculty cooperation with the
military in teaching approved
courses for credit.
During the first one or two
class meetings of a course the
regular faculty member works
with the military teacher. After
this the military teacher takes
over for the rest of the quarter.
Kline Coil tradition
Kline's report contradicts what
the Daily was told two days ago in
a phone conversation with a
Professor Frisch of MIT who is on
the committee dealing with the
ROTC question. He said, "No
credit will be given for ROTC
courses except those taught by
regular professors within a
department."
He also said that the
department would normally
require a Ph.D. for an ROTC
instructor to qualify as a teacher
for credit. Very few ROTC
instructors have that qualification.
Professor of History Lyman
Van Slyke, said at the meeting
that if what the Daily printed was
correct, he would conclude that
"the military will negotiate with
the universities separately and the
military will get as much as the
traffic will bear."

seem to have a little more faculty
involvement."
According to Kline, both
programs require some faculty

participation. Stanford courses
approved by the CUS must be
sponsored by a regular faculty
member, and at MIT there is close
faculty cooperation with the
military in teaching approved
courses for credit.
During the first one or two
class meetings of a course the
regular faculty member works
with the military teacher. After
this the military teacher takes
over for the rest of the quarter.
Kline Coil tradition
Kline's report contradicts what
the Daily was told two days ago in
a phone conversation with a
Professor Frisch of MIT who is on
the committee dealing with the
ROTC question. He said, "No
credit will be given for ROTC
courses except those taught by
regular professors within a
department."
He also said that the
department would normally
require a Ph.D. for an ROTC
instructor to qualify as a teacher
for credit. Very few ROTC
instructors have that qualification.
Professor of History Lyman
Van Slyke, said at the meeting
that if what the Daily printed was
correct, he would conclude that
"the military will negotiate with
the universities separately and the
military will get as much as the
traffic will bear."
The Academic Council
overwhelmingly decided yesterday
to submit the review of the
faculty Senate decision on Army
ROTC to a mail ballot of the
entire faculty.
After a "revolutionary
greeting" by anti-ROTC forces
outside Dinkelspiel Auditorium
and two hours of debate at the
meeting, the 300 faculty members
affirmed by voice vote that those
members not present should have
an opportunity to vote on an issue
as important as ROTC.
Academic Secretary H. Donald
Winbigler said that he would mail
out the ballots "promptly." Based
on prior mail ballots, Winbigler
had indicated before the meeting
that the balloting would take
approximately three weeks to
complete in order to allow faculty
overseas to vote.
The faculty will vote on
approving or disapproving the
Senate's decision of January 22,
1970 on ROTC. That decision
would allow limited credit for
Army ROTC courses provided
they are approved by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
If the faculty disapproves the
action, it would restore the prior
decisions of the Academic Council
and Senate made in 1969
regarding ROTC. These denied all
credit strictly an extra-curricular
activity, and recommended that
the punitive clauses involving
enlisted service be removed from
individual student's contracts.
KZSU Tape
In an unprecedented move,
radio station KZSU was allowed
to tape the entire proceedings of
the Council meeting for future
broadcast. KZSU will broadcast
the entire meeting at 7 p.m.
tonight.
Pierre Noyes, professor at
SLAC, began the debate with a
claim that the faculty Senate
voted the way it did because the
no credit decision of last year had
not proved acceptable to forces
outside the Council.
Noyes said that our military
institutions "are responsible,
directly or indirectly, for close to
a million deaths of an alien
population of distinct ethnic
character, which comes perilously
close to genocide." He said that
by "refusing to allow ROTC an
official place in our institution"
Stanford would severe its
associations with this genocide.
Two professors spoke in favor
of the Senate action during the
debate. Professor Philip
Rhinelander of philosophy and
humanities defended the
humanistic element ROTC injects
in the military and said that a vote
for the proposal did not mean
that one supports the Vietnam
war.

Thomas Ehrlich, professor of
law, stated that although he didn't
know if the scheme would work,
he felt it was worth a try for a
one-year trial period with an
evaluation at the end.
Professor William Clebsch,
chairman of the faculty Senate,
said after the meeting that "the
main issue is that there has been
no one to spell out the
discrepancy or agreement between
the Senate's 1969 action and the
1970 one." He said that it was
largely a matter of individual
interpretation.
Yesterday's report in the Daily
regarding the MIT plan for credit
for ROTC courses brought varied
reaction from the council. Clebsh
said that some members of the
Council feel that the main
difference between the MIT plan
and the Stanford plan is that there
has never been a means for getting
credit at MIT other than through
the departments.
MIT Like Stanford
Professor Stephen Kline,
mechanical engineering, said after
talking with a colleague at MIT,

in the military and said that a vote
for the proposal did not mean
that one supports the Vietnam
war.

Thomas Ehrlich, professor of
law, stated that although he didn't
know if the scheme would work,
he felt it was worth a try for a
one-year trial period with an
evaluation at the end.
Professor William Clebsch,
chairman of the faculty Senate,
said after the meeting that "the
main issue is that there has been
no one to spell out the
discrepancy or agreement between
the Senate's 1969 action and the
1970 one." He said that it was
largely a matter of individual
interpretation.
Yesterday's report in the Daily
regarding the MIT plan for credit
for ROTC courses brought varied
reaction from the council. Clebsh
said that some members of the
Council feel that the main
difference between the MIT plan
and the Stanford plan is that there
has never been a means for getting
credit at MIT other than through
the departments.
MIT Like Stanford
Professor Stephen Kline,
mechanical engineering, said after
talking with a colleague at MIT,
that MlT's plan sounds very
similar to what we're
(Stanford) doing. . .So far they
seem to have a little more faculty
involvement."
According to Kline, both
programs require some faculty

participation. Stanford courses
approved by the CUS must be
sponsored by a regular faculty
member, and at MIT there is close
faculty cooperation with the
military in teaching approved
courses for credit.
During the first one or two
class meetings of a course the
regular faculty member works
with the military teacher. After
this the military teacher takes
over for the rest of the quarter.
Kline Coil tradition
Kline's report contradicts what
the Daily was told two days ago in
a phone conversation with a
Professor Frisch of MIT who is on
the committee dealing with the
ROTC question. He said, "No
credit will be given for ROTC
courses except those taught by
regular professors within a
department."
He also said that the
department would normally
require a Ph.D. for an ROTC
instructor to qualify as a teacher
for credit. Very few ROTC
instructors have that qualification.
Professor of History Lyman
Van Slyke, said at the meeting
that if what the Daily printed was
correct, he would conclude that
"the military will negotiate with
the universities separately and the
military will get as much as the
traffic will bear."
