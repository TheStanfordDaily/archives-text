# 'Bank of Amerika'
## 
### RALPH KONSTAT 
A "revolutionary greeting"
welcomed faculty members to
yesterday's Academic Council
meeting.
Supplemented by drums and
Viet Cong flags, a crowd of about
one hundred fifty people gathered
outside the "Bank of Amerika,"
better known as Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Michael Sweeney, one of the
speakers at the anti-ROTC rally,
termed the new name "a fitting
symbol of the choice the faculty
has to make today."
As he and Diarmuid McGuire
spoke to the crowd, other
students distributed copies of an
anti-ROTC issue of the
CHAPARRALto Council
members entering the building.
John Shoch asked faculty
members, "Have you read this
yet . . . this is what it's all about."
About a third of the professors
took the literature, while others
just walked inside.
Timing Attacked
Sweeney attacked the timing
of the meeting, noting that the
final decision of a mail ballot
would be announced during spring
break. He was rebuffed by Tom
Dawson, chairman of the ASSU

Publications Board, saying, "You
also ought to tell them, Michael,
that Hal Kahn held those petitions
(calling for the meeting) till the
deadline, and that this meeting
could have taken place two weeks
ago."
McGuire, noting that an
NROTC class was scheduled for
3:30, asked, "How many people
think we ought to go visit that
class?"
Under a dozen people raised
their hands, and some sixty
demonstrators joined the march
to the History Corner class. Led
by the drummers and three Viet
Cong flags, they chanted their
way to the empty classroom,
unaware that the midshipment
were filing past them out the same
door.
The dwindling crowd returned
to Dinkelspiel about four o'clock,
to hear Sweeney read newspaper
articles, a Feiffer cartoon, and a
summary of the objectives of the
day's happenings.
Speaking of future plans, he
concluded, "We can split now, but
after the Academic Council makes
its decision we'll have a meeting
of the people, and a discussion by
the people on the best approach
to take in response to that
decision."
