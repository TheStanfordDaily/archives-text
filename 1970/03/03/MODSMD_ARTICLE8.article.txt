## Draft Prosecution Limited 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court ruled 5 to 3
yesterday that men who violate
the law that requires them to
register for the draft at 18 may be
prosecuted only until they are 23
years old.
After that age, Justice Hugo L.
Black said for the court, the
federal five-year statute of
limitations protects the man from
punishment.
Precise implications of the
decision were not immediately
discernible but Justice
Department lawyers said the
ruling does not shield evaders who
have fled the country to avoid
prosecution.
In another decision yesterday the
Supreme Court rejected the
contention that draft boards have
no legal grounds for requiring
conscientious objectors to do
alternative civilian service.
By a 7-1 vote the court
rejected the appeal of Vincent
Joseph O'Connor, who was
convicted in U.S. District court
for northern California of willful
failure to report for civilian
service as an alternative to
military service.
The court affirmed O'Connor's
conviction and three-year prison
sentence. Associate Justice
William O. Douglas, dissenting,
said O'Connor should have been
granted a hearing.
Leary SenttTiced
HOUSTON, Tex. (AP) - A
federal judge called Dr. Timothy
Leary ''a danger to the
community" and sentenced the
former Harvard instructor to 10
years in prison yesterday for
smuggling marijuana into the
United States from Mexico
U.S. Dist. Judge Ben C.
Connally also denied an appeal

bond for Leary, whose advocacy
of drugs has caused him to be
called "the high priest of pot."
"I have no doubt he would
appear," Connally said in denying
bond. "But his conduct has been
such that he has openly advocated
violation of the law. He has
preached this in length and
breadth of the land. He would
pose a danger to others in the
community."
Leary's attorneys said they
would appeal to the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court in New Orleans in
an attempt to get bond.
Nixon Apologizes
NEW YORK (AP) - President
Nixon flew to New York
yesterday and person ally
conveyed to French President
Georges Pompidou his regrets over
the hostile demonstrations he
encountered during parts of his
visit in the United States.
Nixon flew up from
Washington and paid a courtesy
call on Pompidou in the
presidential suite of the
Waldorf-Astoria shortly before
6:30 p.m., in advance of a formal
dinner for the French leader.
Earlier in the day, Nixon had
sent his apologies to Pompidou in
advance of his arrival, and the
French president declared himself
gratified by Nixon's concern.
Pompidou told employees at
the French Consulate, "I'm
deeply grateful because his
presence, like mine, will testify to
the strengthening of
French-American friendship."
SF State
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - All six
fulltime faculty members in the
Black Studies Department at San

Francisco State College have been
notified of non-reappointment for
the next school year, but any or
all of them may be rehired, the
college reported yesterday.
Dr. Donald Garrity, academic
vice president, said the formal
notices mailed Feb. 28 were
required because the department
failed to turn in any
recommendations and its faculty
members refused to meet with the
administration on this and other
personal matters.
Neglect
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon has a recommendation
from one of his key advisers that
the racial issue could benefit from
a period of benign neglect and low
key approach to racial progress.
The suggestion came from
Daniel P. Moynihan, the chief
White House expert on urban
affairs, in a memo to the President
which got into print over the
weekend.
Moynihan followed up the
"benign neglect" phrase regarding
the racial issue with word that:
"The subject has been too
much talked about. The forum
has been too much taken over to
hysterics, paranoids and boodlers
on all sides. We may need a period
in which Negro progress continues
and racial rhetoric fades.
"The administration can help
bring this about by paying close
attention to such progress as we
are doing while seeking to avoid
situations in which extremists of
either race are given opportunities
for martyrdom, heroics,
histrionics or whatever.
"Greater attention to Indians,
Mexican-Americans and Puerto
Ricans would be useful. A
tendency to ignore provocations
from groups such as the Black
Panthers might also be useful."

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court ruled 5 to 3
yesterday that men who violate
the law that requires them to
register for the draft at 18 may be
prosecuted only until they are 23
years old.
After that age, Justice Hugo L.
Black said for the court, the
federal five-year statute of
limitations protects the man from
punishment.
Precise implications of the
decision were not immediately
discernible but Justice
Department lawyers said the
ruling does not shield evaders who
have fled the country to avoid
prosecution.
In another decision yesterday the
Supreme Court rejected the
contention that draft boards have
no legal grounds for requiring
conscientious objectors to do
alternative civilian service.
By a 7-1 vote the court
rejected the appeal of Vincent
Joseph O'Connor, who was
convicted in U.S. District court
for northern California of willful
failure to report for civilian
service as an alternative to
military service.
The court affirmed O'Connor's
conviction and three-year prison
sentence. Associate Justice
William O. Douglas, dissenting,
said O'Connor should have been
granted a hearing.
Leary SenttTiced
HOUSTON, Tex. (AP) - A
federal judge called Dr. Timothy
Leary ''a danger to the
community" and sentenced the
former Harvard instructor to 10
years in prison yesterday for
smuggling marijuana into the
United States from Mexico
U.S. Dist. Judge Ben C.
Connally also denied an appeal

bond for Leary, whose advocacy
of drugs has caused him to be
called "the high priest of pot."
"I have no doubt he would
appear," Connally said in denying
bond. "But his conduct has been
such that he has openly advocated
violation of the law. He has
preached this in length and
breadth of the land. He would
pose a danger to others in the
community."
Leary's attorneys said they
would appeal to the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court in New Orleans in
an attempt to get bond.
Nixon Apologizes
NEW YORK (AP) - President
Nixon flew to New York
yesterday and person ally
conveyed to French President
Georges Pompidou his regrets over
the hostile demonstrations he
encountered during parts of his
visit in the United States.
Nixon flew up from
Washington and paid a courtesy
call on Pompidou in the
presidential suite of the
Waldorf-Astoria shortly before
6:30 p.m., in advance of a formal
dinner for the French leader.
Earlier in the day, Nixon had
sent his apologies to Pompidou in
advance of his arrival, and the
French president declared himself
gratified by Nixon's concern.
Pompidou told employees at
the French Consulate, "I'm
deeply grateful because his
presence, like mine, will testify to
the strengthening of
French-American friendship."
SF State
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - All six
fulltime faculty members in the
Black Studies Department at San

Francisco State College have been
notified of non-reappointment for
the next school year, but any or
all of them may be rehired, the
college reported yesterday.
Dr. Donald Garrity, academic
vice president, said the formal
notices mailed Feb. 28 were
required because the department
failed to turn in any
recommendations and its faculty
members refused to meet with the
administration on this and other
personal matters.
Neglect
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon has a recommendation
from one of his key advisers that
the racial issue could benefit from
a period of benign neglect and low
key approach to racial progress.
The suggestion came from
Daniel P. Moynihan, the chief
White House expert on urban
affairs, in a memo to the President
which got into print over the
weekend.
Moynihan followed up the
"benign neglect" phrase regarding
the racial issue with word that:
"The subject has been too
much talked about. The forum
has been too much taken over to
hysterics, paranoids and boodlers
on all sides. We may need a period
in which Negro progress continues
and racial rhetoric fades.
"The administration can help
bring this about by paying close
attention to such progress as we
are doing while seeking to avoid
situations in which extremists of
either race are given opportunities
for martyrdom, heroics,
histrionics or whatever.
"Greater attention to Indians,
Mexican-Americans and Puerto
Ricans would be useful. A
tendency to ignore provocations
from groups such as the Black
Panthers might also be useful."
