# The 						Seventies
## War Prevention Decade? 
### Michael Hodge 
Frustration runs high these days for those of us
who have any hopes of changing our world
systems so that we can have a complete peace,
clean resources, or just assurance that we will
continue to exist. Great moves have been made in
the cleaning up of our natural resources. No one
can successfully challenge the need to prevent
environmental destruction. But, movements
concerning a world without war have apparently
gone nowhere. All manner of marches or petitions
has been ignored by anyone in power; the
Moratorium is all but completely defunct. So,
frustration with our society grows and manifests
itself in riots like those at Santa Barbara last week.
Many of us still hope that a peaceful and
constructive means toward lasting peace will be
heard, and that hope is justified when one learns
of a group such as the War Control Planners, Inc.
Global Safety
This group is coordinated by Howard and
Harriet Kurtz, a husband-wife team who since
1966 has worked full time out of a home in the
suburbs north of New York City. Their work has
been mainly known on the East Coast, but it is
now spreading throughout the country. A group
known as the Citizen's Committee for Global
Safety — made up of students, professional men,
businessmen, and military leaders, including a
former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — has
supported their work, which is basically to
formulate a feasible means of establishing world
control of war.
Their plan, as it was first published in the
Military Review in May, 1969, includes four basic
steps, during what would be known as a War
Prevention Decade:
1) Surveillance systems would be developed in
the form of orbiting laboratories.
2) The U.N. would experimentally command
and control this system, using information not
held secret by individual nations.
3) Conferences on war prevention would be
held.
4) All nations would engage in war prevention
games along the same lines that they now hold war
games.
"Unique"
Esquire Magazine has called their plan "unique
among arms control proposals" for reasons which
can best be expressed in the Kurtz's own words:
"No risk too the national security will be incurred.
The people in government are listening, and we
as students can become an important part of the
voice. The university is an integral part of the

Kurtz's overall plan, both as a manpower training
center and, more importantly, as an initiator of
new ideas.
The first is primarily one of personal choice,
just as it is with those biology majors who become
interested in and specialize in ecology. There is
room in the new world system which would
develop from the War Prevention System for
engineers, lawyers, economists, political scientists,
theologians, all of whom could take an integral
part in the formation of a new world order.
War Control Planners
The second part is one in which the university
as a whole can contribute. The members of the
War Control Planners do not pretend to have all of
the answers. There are many problems yet to be
worked out. The Kurtzes have succeeded merely in
pointing a direction for our efforts. Stanford, its
students and its faculty, can confront these
problems and perhaps reach some conclusions.
Seminars can be held in many areas to try and
reason a constructive means toward obtaining
world peace. Any ideas that arise from such groups
can be channeled through the War Control
Planners to sources of influence within the
government.
This short article cannot describe completely
the work of the War Control Planners, and it was
not intended to do just that. Instead it was meant
to raise questions and point towards the possibility
of a successful system for ending war. Those
students and faculty who are curious about the
War Control Planners and those who are interested
in formulating ideas for peace are urged to contact
me, Michael Hodge, at Toyon Hall, room 138, or
at 327-2920 x 1338. I will gladly answer all
questions that I can.
Proposals
The way towards peace can be in the hands of
the American people. In the words of the members
of the War Control Planners:
"It is proposed that:
The American people commit their creative
power for the 1970's to the task of bringing an
end to war and establishing new structures of
world order to resolve international conflict,
and that
Through an All-Nation Declaration of
Independence the people of all nations be
encouraged to proclaim freedom from domination
by any foreign power, in a new world order of
independent nations. . .as the American people
once proclaimed their freedom and independence
through the Declaration of Independence."
