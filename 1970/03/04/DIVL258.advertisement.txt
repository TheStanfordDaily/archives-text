ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST FILMS
Jean Renoir s Masterpiece
Grand Illusion
(La Grande Illusion)
ImIH d
"In 1937, just one year before Hitler began to fan his
new armies across Europe and start the ominous over
ture to WWII, there was released in France a motion
picture which one can condently say is the most telling
examination of the mystery of why men submit to war
ever put on the screen. It is Jean Renoir's Grand Illusion,
a film, which for everything—theme, philosophy, con
struction, staging, performance and mood—merits the
highest commendations and the monumental fame
it has achieved."—Bosley Crowther, THE GREAT FILMS
"On the top of any list of the world's greatest films—
the total senselesness of war has never been stated as
convincingly as in Grand Illusion. . N.Y. Times
