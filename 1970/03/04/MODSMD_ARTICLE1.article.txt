## Negotiations: Veiled Bias? 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
(Third in a Series)
Stanford's sole negotiator with the Defense Department on ROTC
was the author of the Minority ROTC Report which the Faculty
Senate rejected in February, 1969.
The negotiator, Vice Provost Howard Brooks, voted against the
Majority Report's recommendations during Faculty Senate
deliberations; nevertheless President Kenneth Pitzer chose him to
implement those recommendations.
Pitzer explains the Brook nomination as "essentially a matter
where I needed someone to do the job who was fully knowledgeable
about the University administrative structure and who was high
enough in the University to command personal attention."
Asked whether Brooks' opposition to the recommendations he was
implementing tainted the nomination, Pitzer responded: "I respect
that comment, but I can't regard it as adequate to disqualify him.
"He was a member of the Senate unlike the other members of the
administration," he continued, "and he fully realized that his
objective was to obtain approval for the Senate plan or to come as
close to it as possible."
Early Summer Negotiations
Brooks began his negotiations early in the summer. In a June letter
to members of the President's Advisory Committee he expressed
optimism that "most if not all of the revisions desired by the Senate"
would be included in an Army proposal.
Later, amplifying this statement Brooks explained, "We were close
to the Senate recommendations then, and we got even closer." This
indicates that as early as June Brooks considered limited credit and no
change in the punitive clauses as allowable departures from the Senate
guidelines.
The result of Brooks' work was the Army's October 22, 1969
recommendation for "revision of Army ROTC institutional and
student contracts. "This is the proposal that Pitzer later recommended
to the Senate and which it adopted after a few changes.
The President's Advisory Committee began its examination of the
Army proposal on November 20. In that and later meetings the
academic credit issue became the leading point in dispute—or, as the
committee minutes describe it, the "crunch issue."
For this reason, the committee members' attitudes toward the
credit question were critical; and, since five of the members entered
the deliberations in favor of some accreditation, the "crunch issue"
was virtually settled before it was discussed.
Students Not Objective?
The report in yesterday's Daily focused on the three students on
the committee, and showed that all three entered the deliberations in
favor of giving ROTC some credit. Therefore, they disagreed with the
crucial recommendation of the proposal they were implementing.
The appointment procedures that put these students on the
committee remain in doubt. In fact, Council of Presidents member
John Grube who is the only person who admits having a role in the
selection of the students, stated yesterday that he was not sure any of
the roughly 15 students who applied were interviewed.
Some elements of the appointment procedures for faculty also
seem to be in doubt, though the doubts are philosophical rather than
procedural.
Of the five faculty members appointed, two, Lyman Van Slyke,
and Alan Manne expressed some opposition to parts of the Army
proposal; two other members, Jean Mayers and Eugene Webb entered
the deliberations in favor of some ROTC credit; and another
professor, J. Keith Mann, started his committee work completely
uncommitted.

Like all other faculty appointments, these men were chosen by the
Faculty Senate's Committee on Committees chaired by G.L. Bach.
And, like members of all other committees, professors were chosen
without regard to their interest, or views on the ROTC issue.
Bach explains, "We tried to avoid putting either extreme on the
committee. We tried very hard to get people who were judicious, and
as we do on all committees we tried to get different people involved in
the committee system, and attempted to get a reasonable distribution
of seniority and opinion on it.
"But, with most of the people we didn't know whether they were
for or against it, and frankly we did not care," he said.
On the issue of academic credit the committee's faculty members
consistently voted 3-2 in favor of limited accreditation. Perhaps the
majority of the members of future committees charged with
implementation of a decision should also be judged by whether they
agree with the decision.
Attention to Credit
As the committee meetings continued, attention continued to
center on the credit problem. The views of the members of the
committee are summarized in this exerpt from the November 6
minutes: "Professors Manne and Van Slyke held the view that
it (the proposal for limited credit), is contrary to Senate
Recommendation No. 1 (calling for the termination of credit for
participation in programs of military training and education.)"
The minutes continued: "The opposing argument was that
Recommendation No. 1 dealt primarily with courses taught by
military in a military department with credit determined by the
military."
Proponent of limited academic credit also argued that a campaign
advertisement in the April 4, 1969 Daily, substantiates their argument
because it mentions the possibility of credit being granted by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
Opponents of limited credit discount this add as campaign
propaganda and charge that some of those who signed it had never
read it. They also refer to paragraphs of the Majority Report from
which the ROTC recommendations were made last year.
It reads: "A great number of changes have been suggested to bring
the ROTC programs into closer conformity with accepted practice . . .
"But even if all these alterations are in fact made, there will still
remain a residuum of anomaly. In the Majority's view, the crucial
questiobefore the Stanford community is whether or not this
residuum is compatible with Stanford University—or at least
compatible enough to be acceptable.
Majority Conclusion
The conclusion of the Majority after weighing the evidence is that
as a formal on-campus program, sponsored, sanctioned, and partially
supported by Stanford University, the ROTC program is not
compatible with the University. Moreover, this incompatibility is
inherent in the very nature of the ROTC programs, and therefore
cannot be removed by various changes which are from time to time
proposed."
But the credit issue returned to the Senate on top of Pitzer's
recommendation for limited accreditation. The importance of this
recommendation in causing the Senate to alter its previous stand
remains in doubt—and, to that we will turn on Friday.
