# 'Contorted Logic'
## Challenge To Pompidou 
### Joshua Lederberg 
(This is the text of the address given by Joshua
Lederberg,professor in genetics at Stanford Univer
sity and a Nobel Prize laureate, on February 26,
1970 at San Francisco on the occasion of Pres.
Pompidou's visit.)
Some of the press stories about M. Pompidou's
visit have predicted that he would get a "hot
reception," and that he has anticipated this with
trepidation. I welcome Georges Pompidou's visit; I
am glad he is here. For I might hope that in this
way he might learn something that is vital to the
future of the world and the culture that we share.
I want him to know that we arc here, and what we
care about; but we should give him no excuse to
take the luxury of not listening.
1 do not stand here to defend, or even (as might
be an even more typically Jewish habit) to criticize
the policies of the government of Israel, a nation
facing impossible dilemmas in its struggle for
survival and for the right to live in peace in the
community of nations. On all sides, there are
victims—Jews, Arabs, bystanders—who suffer in
innocent helplessness.
The roots of the problem go very deep, above
all in ourselves, and in our own failure to solve the
larger conflicts of the great powers. We have
stubborn and malevolent adversaries, but we fall
far short of perfect love and wisdom ourselves.
Judge Yourself
I cannot judge you, M. Pompidou—but I call on
your conscience, and your ambitions for the honor
of your own name and that of your country, to
judge yourself. It is to you I must speak.
For some time, the official policy of your
government was to minimize the flow of arms to
either side of the middle-East conflict. This
seemed a peculiar blindness to what the Soviets
were already stirring up, but the principle was not
hypocritical and suffered more from a lack of
realism than of logic. Now, we hear that Libya is
to receive 50, 100, or more advanced jet fighters

for which she has no conceivable use; but, of
course, you have been reassured that they will not
be diverted to Egypt to refuel Arab aggression
against Israel.
Protestations of Friendship
I cannot believe that you are basically hostile to
the people of Israel or to the Jews of the world.
The outcome of the 1967 war may justify a
certain faith in miracles; your belief in some
miracle might reconcile your recent policy with
your protestations of friendship.
More likely you have worked out some
contorted logic by which to rationalize that
policy, and to find in the vortices of power an
attractive vacuum that draws you to reassert the
vanities of French glory. But we cannot evade the
consequences of error, and recent history shows all
too many examples of grave error in the
manipulations of Weltpolitik.
Pompidou and Hitler
The Arab b'oc is avowedly dedicated to a holy
war that would drive Israel into the sea. If they
succeed with your help, you, and France will pay a
price too—you will have to live with the
knowledge that Georges Pompidou had finished
the work that Adolf Hitler had started.
Do you think that French culture, or any
civilized culture, will long survive in a world in
which that can have happened!
Of course you do not contemplate such an
event. But how much you risk with your
adventures! Are the consequences of your
calculations so trustworthy when so much is at
stake?
Politics is, of course, a world of mutual
reactions; and it is inescapable that your gambits
must be followed by responses from this country
and elsewhere to maintain some balance of force.
The lovers of violence may delight at such
inflammations. But what a terrible waste of energy
and resources. Glory is a hollow-sounding word in
an era of famine and global anarchy.
