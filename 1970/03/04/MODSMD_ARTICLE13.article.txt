# Women's Liberation
## Inherent Passiveness 
### Ellen Lewin 
As another member of
Women's Liberation, I should like
to comment on Sister Judith
Strasser's discussion of the
divergent views of women's
oppression found within the
women's movement (Daily, Feb.
13).
Particularly, I find that I must
differ with her use of the
inflammatory expressions
"deliberate female chauvinism"
and "fierce man-hating" in
describing an analysis which sees
women's oppression as
perpetrated by men.
The oppression of women is
the oldest form of exploitation
known to human societies and its
origin precedes by many centuries
(to say the least) the development
of oppressive economic
institutions like capitalism, which
our sometime brothers on the
Left hope to overthrow. It is well
known that our sisters in socialist
countries are hardly to be
considered liberated from the
bondage of male supremacy.
Institutions and Organisms
Sister Strasser declares that if
women are to be free, we must
"threaten our oppressors . . . the
technocracy, the economy, the
cultural and political status
qu0..." She thus
anthropomorphically identifies
the oppressors as a group of
institutions. This argument misses

the point that while these
institutions are probably harmful
to people in general, they cannot
be thought to operate
independently of human design.
Institutions are nothing more than
tools which groups of people use
to further certain objectives. They
are not organisms; they do not
think or make decisions.
The many institutions which
keep women in "their place" owe
their existence to the fact that all
men benefit from the oppression
of women, socially, economically,
and politically. Clearly not all
men are in a position to direct
their fates; they are oppressed by
other, more powerful men. But
every man, rich or poor, derives
some benefit from living in a male
supremacist world, be it in no
other way than by knowing that
at least one person is even lower
than he is.
Nor can it be argued that
"women oppress themselves";
women are responding to
pressures from the real world in
behaving submissively. Any
woman who challenges the
traditional patterns in male-female
relations will find out quickly that
most men will have nothing to do
with her. And in a world where
women depend on men for
economic survival and social
recognition, such sanctions
effectively keep us in line.

What women learn by talking
to other women in the small
groups Sister Strasser mentions is
not only that personal
relationships are non-unique, that
they fall into a number of
repetitive patterns characterized
by a pervasive structural
â– consistency, but that personal
relationships are political.
Male supremacy depends on
the degradation of all women, on
their self-hate, on their slavish
admiration of men, and most of
all, on their isolation from each
other. Man-hating (fierce or
otherwise) and blame-placing are
part of the initial burst of
consciousness that accompanies a
woman's first discovery of her
condition. Ultimately, these
emotions are found to be
constructive only when combined
with rigorous self-examination
and self-criticism and unrelenting
opposition to make supremacy
everywhere it is found. But they
are an unavoidable component of
a more critical awareness and are
stimuli to further action. Most
importantly, once women
understand who profits from their
degradation, they no longer need
to blame themselves, and they are
on the road to full and equal
membership in the human
community.
