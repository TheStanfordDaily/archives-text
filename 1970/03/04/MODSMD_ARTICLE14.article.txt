# Opinions Expressed On Last Week's Violence
## UCSB Students Outline 'Police State' 
### KATHY STEPHENSON 
"Our community is now a
police state." With this statement,
three students from UCSB
explained their view of the
underlying causes of last week's
violence in Isla Vista to a sparse
crowd of 50 Monday night in
Tresidder Large Lounge.
"The fears and feelings inside
of you are hard to describe and
define—you want to get out and
feel freedom for awhile," said
Walt Chesnavitch, a grad student
at UCSB, speaking along with
students Bridget Murphy and
David Myerhoff.
Chesnavitch outlined three
basic reasons for the uprisings: the
lack of effective student input in
the administration and governance
of the University; exploitation of
students living in Isla Vista; and
problems with the environment in
Santa Barbara.
UCSB students, the 3 related,
feel that they have no power over
their school, as manifested by the
firing of an anthropology
professor last year. The students
were never given an explanation
although a petition with 7,776
signatures (out of a student body
of 13,000) was presented to the
Administration. Demonstrations
ensued in which 19 students were
arrested. Also, representation in
academic and administration
committees, according to the
three speakers, is token, most
students not having a vote.
Another problem suggested is
the student community in Isla
Vista—a "ghetto" exploited by
real estate owners and the county.
Myerhoff, son of a Stanford
professor, called it another East
Palo Alto with inadequate
services, exploitation by the
merchant class, and constant
harassment by police.
No Representative Control
13,000 residents live in an area
of one square mile, and yet have
no control over their own
community affairs. Few could
vote in the last municipal
elections because to register

students must renounce parent
support and list Isla Vista as their
permanent address. There are few
sidewalks because there is little
maintenance; the beaches by the
campus are not cleaned, unless by
the students. Exorbitant rents are
charged, and students are forced
to sign 10-month leases although
the school year is only 9 months.
Another form of exploitation,
claimed by the three, "was" the
Bank of America (burned down
during Wednesday night's
activities). Since the nearest
commercial area is 5 miles away,
most students used the Bank of
America. This particular branch
had several policies very different
from most branches, the students
related. For instance, students
who had less than $100 in the
bank could not receive interest.
The third major cause cited is
the growing outrage over the
exploitation of the ecological
environment due to oil companies
and industrialization which is
aided by the University. Many
geologists and chemists at UCSB
have grants from "ocal oil
companies. Vernon Cheadle, who
is Chancellor of UCSB, also is on
the Board of Directors of Goleta
Savings and Loan and a member
of the Chamber of Commerce.
Chronology of Violence
From causes, the speakers
turned to a chronological account
of what happened and first-hand
reports of police brutality:
Tuesday afternoon —Police
attempted to arrest a black
student, claiming they had a
warrant for his arrest (later, it was
discovered that he was the wrong
black student). A scuffle began
and three students were arrested.
Tuesday evening —Students
went around throwing rocks
through the windows of real
estate offices and the Bank of
America.
Wednesday —A crowd of 5,000
heard lawyer William Kunstler
speak. A rally was held
afterwards. Police entered,
randomly arresting students on

the street. That evening a bus with
100 police entered Isla Vista, but
the students pushed them back
and built blockades to prevent the
police from entering. Meanwhile,
the police had cordoned off the
area. The Bank of America was set
on fire. 36 were arrested.
Thursday evening - Police
launched tear gas cannisters from
helicopters and from a M-79
grenade launcher situated on an
overpass. The people threw rocks
and molotov cocktails back. 15
arrested.
Friday afternoon — The
National Guard entered. A curfew
from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. was
imposed. Anyone on the streets
were arrested on a "bust now, ask

later" policy. 68 arrested,
including some reporters.
$1250 bail Set for Misdemeanors
Not only were most arrests
indiscriminate and unfair, they
said, but the handling of the
people arrested is reminiscent of
the newly-formed military state in
Greece among other examples.
Facilities were inadequate.
Students were not advised of their
constitutional rights and were not
allowed to make phone calls until
approximately 9 hours after their
arrest. Some were beaten before
being booked, and all were
handcuffed with plastic handcuffs
which keep tightening. One grad
student's clothes were torn off,

his boots cut off, and then he was
clubbed. Apartments were busted,
stereos and cars smashed. Bail for
misdemeanors is set at $1250 and
between $5,000 and $7,000 for
felonies. Students are frantically
trying to raise the money for bail
for the 40 students still in jail.
Last week, no longer was
UCSB the "normal, apathetic rich
kids' University," Clesnavitch
concluded. Something
happened—people got mad and
attacked the "colonial
administration" and their other
exploiters. The stoning and
burning of real estate offices and
the Bank of America were not
coincidental.

100 police entered Isla Vista, but
the students pushed them back
and built blockades to prevent the
police from entering. Meanwhile,
the police had cordoned off the
area. The Bank of America was set
on fire. 36 were arrested.
Thursday evening - Police
launched tear gas cannisters from
helicopters and from a M-79
grenade launcher situated on an
overpass. The people threw rocks
and molotov cocktails back. 15
arrested.
Friday afternoon — The
National Guard entered. A curfew
from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. was
imposed. Anyone on the streets
were arrested on a "bust now, ask

later" policy. 68 arrested,
including some reporters.
$1250 bail Set for Misdemeanors
Not only were most arrests
indiscriminate and unfair, they
said, but the handling of the
people arrested is reminiscent of
the newly-formed military state in
Greece among other examples.
Facilities were inadequate.
Students were not advised of their
constitutional rights and were not
allowed to make phone calls until
approximately 9 hours after their
arrest. Some were beaten before
being booked, and all were
handcuffed with plastic handcuffs
which keep tightening. One grad
student's clothes were torn off,

his boots cut off, and then he was
clubbed. Apartments were busted,
stereos and cars smashed. Bail for
misdemeanors is set at $1250 and
between $5,000 and $7,000 for
felonies. Students are frantically
trying to raise the money for bail
for the 40 students still in jail.
Last week, no longer was
UCSB the "normal, apathetic rich
kids' University," Clesnavitch
concluded. Something
happened—people got mad and
attacked the "colonial
administration" and their other
exploiters. The stoning and
burning of real estate offices and
the Bank of America were not
coincidental.
"Our community is now a
police state." With this statement,
three students from UCSB
explained their view of the
underlying causes of last week's
violence in Isla Vista to a sparse
crowd of 50 Monday night in
Tresidder Large Lounge.
"The fears and feelings inside
of you are hard to describe and
define—you want to get out and
feel freedom for awhile," said
Walt Chesnavitch, a grad student
at UCSB, speaking along with
students Bridget Murphy and
David Myerhoff.
Chesnavitch outlined three
basic reasons for the uprisings: the
lack of effective student input in
the administration and governance
of the University; exploitation of
students living in Isla Vista; and
problems with the environment in
Santa Barbara.
UCSB students, the 3 related,
feel that they have no power over
their school, as manifested by the
firing of an anthropology
professor last year. The students
were never given an explanation
although a petition with 7,776
signatures (out of a student body
of 13,000) was presented to the
Administration. Demonstrations
ensued in which 19 students were
arrested. Also, representation in
academic and administration
committees, according to the
three speakers, is token, most
students not having a vote.
Another problem suggested is
the student community in Isla
Vista—a "ghetto" exploited by
real estate owners and the county.
Myerhoff, son of a Stanford
professor, called it another East
Palo Alto with inadequate
services, exploitation by the
merchant class, and constant
harassment by police.
No Representative Control
13,000 residents live in an area
of one square mile, and yet have
no control over their own
community affairs. Few could
vote in the last municipal
elections because to register

students must renounce parent
support and list Isla Vista as their
permanent address. There are few
sidewalks because there is little
maintenance; the beaches by the
campus are not cleaned, unless by
the students. Exorbitant rents are
charged, and students are forced
to sign 10-month leases although
the school year is only 9 months.
Another form of exploitation,
claimed by the three, "was" the
Bank of America (burned down
during Wednesday night's
activities). Since the nearest
commercial area is 5 miles away,
most students used the Bank of
America. This particular branch
had several policies very different
from most branches, the students
related. For instance, students
who had less than $100 in the
bank could not receive interest.
The third major cause cited is
the growing outrage over the
exploitation of the ecological
environment due to oil companies
and industrialization which is
aided by the University. Many
geologists and chemists at UCSB
have grants from "ocal oil
companies. Vernon Cheadle, who
is Chancellor of UCSB, also is on
the Board of Directors of Goleta
Savings and Loan and a member
of the Chamber of Commerce.
Chronology of Violence
From causes, the speakers
turned to a chronological account
of what happened and first-hand
reports of police brutality:
Tuesday afternoon —Police
attempted to arrest a black
student, claiming they had a
warrant for his arrest (later, it was
discovered that he was the wrong
black student). A scuffle began
and three students were arrested.
Tuesday evening —Students
went around throwing rocks
through the windows of real
estate offices and the Bank of
America.
Wednesday —A crowd of 5,000
heard lawyer William Kunstler
speak. A rally was held

vote in the last municipal
elections because to register

students must renounce parent
support and list Isla Vista as their
permanent address. There are few
sidewalks because there is little
maintenance; the beaches by the
campus are not cleaned, unless by
the students. Exorbitant rents are
charged, and students are forced
to sign 10-month leases although
the school year is only 9 months.
Another form of exploitation,
claimed by the three, "was" the
Bank of America (burned down
during Wednesday night's
activities). Since the nearest
commercial area is 5 miles away,
most students used the Bank of
America. This particular branch
had several policies very different
from most branches, the students
related. For instance, students
who had less than $100 in the
bank could not receive interest.
The third major cause cited is
the growing outrage over the
exploitation of the ecological
environment due to oil companies
and industrialization which is
aided by the University. Many
geologists and chemists at UCSB
have grants from "ocal oil
companies. Vernon Cheadle, who
is Chancellor of UCSB, also is on
the Board of Directors of Goleta
Savings and Loan and a member
of the Chamber of Commerce.
Chronology of Violence
From causes, the speakers
turned to a chronological account
of what happened and first-hand
reports of police brutality:
Tuesday afternoon —Police
attempted to arrest a black
student, claiming they had a
warrant for his arrest (later, it was
discovered that he was the wrong
black student). A scuffle began
and three students were arrested.
Tuesday evening —Students
went around throwing rocks
through the windows of real
estate offices and the Bank of
America.
Wednesday —A crowd of 5,000
heard lawyer William Kunstler
speak. A rally was held
afterwards. Police entered,
randomly arresting students on

the street. That evening a bus with
100 police entered Isla Vista, but
the students pushed them back
and built blockades to prevent the
police from entering. Meanwhile,
the police had cordoned off the
area. The Bank of America was set
on fire. 36 were arrested.
Thursday evening - Police
launched tear gas cannisters from
helicopters and from a M-79
grenade launcher situated on an
overpass. The people threw rocks
and molotov cocktails back. 15
arrested.
Friday afternoon — The
National Guard entered. A curfew
from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. was
imposed. Anyone on the streets
were arrested on a "bust now, ask

later" policy. 68 arrested,
including some reporters.
$1250 bail Set for Misdemeanors
Not only were most arrests
indiscriminate and unfair, they
said, but the handling of the
people arrested is reminiscent of
the newly-formed military state in
Greece among other examples.
Facilities were inadequate.
Students were not advised of their
constitutional rights and were not
allowed to make phone calls until
approximately 9 hours after their
arrest. Some were beaten before
being booked, and all were
handcuffed with plastic handcuffs
which keep tightening. One grad
student's clothes were torn off,

his boots cut off, and then he was
clubbed. Apartments were busted,
stereos and cars smashed. Bail for
misdemeanors is set at $1250 and
between $5,000 and $7,000 for
felonies. Students are frantically
trying to raise the money for bail
for the 40 students still in jail.
Last week, no longer was
UCSB the "normal, apathetic rich
kids' University," Clesnavitch
concluded. Something
happened—people got mad and
attacked the "colonial
administration" and their other
exploiters. The stoning and
burning of real estate offices and
the Bank of America were not
coincidental.
"Our community is now a
police state." With this statement,
three students from UCSB
explained their view of the
underlying causes of last week's
violence in Isla Vista to a sparse
crowd of 50 Monday night in
Tresidder Large Lounge.
"The fears and feelings inside
of you are hard to describe and
define—you want to get out and
feel freedom for awhile," said
Walt Chesnavitch, a grad student
at UCSB, speaking along with
students Bridget Murphy and
David Myerhoff.
Chesnavitch outlined three
basic reasons for the uprisings: the
lack of effective student input in
the administration and governance
of the University; exploitation of
students living in Isla Vista; and
problems with the environment in
Santa Barbara.
UCSB students, the 3 related,
feel that they have no power over
their school, as manifested by the
firing of an anthropology
professor last year. The students
were never given an explanation
although a petition with 7,776
signatures (out of a student body
of 13,000) was presented to the
Administration. Demonstrations
ensued in which 19 students were
arrested. Also, representation in
academic and administration
committees, according to the
three speakers, is token, most
students not having a vote.
Another problem suggested is
the student community in Isla
Vista—a "ghetto" exploited by
real estate owners and the county.
Myerhoff, son of a Stanford
professor, called it another East
Palo Alto with inadequate
services, exploitation by the
merchant class, and constant
harassment by police.
No Representative Control
13,000 residents live in an area
of one square mile, and yet have
no control over their own
community affairs. Few could
vote in the last municipal
elections because to register

students must renounce parent
support and list Isla Vista as their
permanent address. There are few
sidewalks because there is little
maintenance; the beaches by the
