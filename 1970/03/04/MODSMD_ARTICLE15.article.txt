# Cryonics Symposium
## The 						Deep Freeze 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Cryonics? No, it's not Frankie Vallee's new
group. Rather, cryonics is the study of how to
freeze people and put their bodies in a state of
suspended animation until a time when science has
found a cure for their disease and can restore the
person to life.
The Bay Area Cryonics Society held its first
symposium in San Francisco last Sunday.
Attended by about 50 people, the main focus of
the symposium was an address by Dr. Coleman
Harris, president of the Bay Area Cryonics
Society, who attempted to explain why most
physicians have given what might be termed the
cold shoulder to cryonics. Citing lack of
imagination and the many problems of freezing
human tissue as main problems, Harris claims that
the acceptance of death as final also plays a role in
most doctors' opinions.
Already a great number of people have been
frozen. An article in the Cryonics Society
magazine "Cryonics Reports" (I think a better
name would have been SOUL ON ICE) explains
the way Mrs. Ann Deßlasio was put into liquid
nitrogen storage by Cryo-Span, Inc. Mrs. Deßlasio
was the first person to make use of the new
improved Cryonic suspension unit, or the "Forever
Flask," as it is affectionately known. This
"Forever Flask," claims "Cryonics Reports," is "in
effect, a giant thermos bottle."
The giant coffee, Mrs. Deßlasio was first rapped
in aluminum foil, with an easily removable piece
of foil for her. face, so her face can be easily
looked at and then she can easily be foiled again.

Having been thoroughly Reynold's wrapped, she
was then removed from a temporary dry ice box
and placed in the Forever Flask. The liquid
nitrogen was then poured in.
"Striking the bottom of the inner vessel,"
continues Cryonics Reports, "the liquid nitrogen
boil off began with a deep roar that resonated in
the giant tank. White clouds of condensed water
vapor were formed upon contact with the rising
tide of ultra cold nitrogen and their sudden
eruption from the tank enveloped us all in a
chilled embrace."
However, problems often do arise. A man I ran
into in the elevator at the symposium told me of
the first builder of cryonic suspension units, who
was apparently something of an opportunist. When
one family couldn't meet the payments on their
frozen relative, the builder became somewhat
irritated and removed the relative from storage,
threw him in his station wagon, and began driving
him from Phoenix back to L.A. As might have
been expected, his station wagon, not having a
Good Humor truck, the body began defrosting in
the back.
Unfortunately there was an accident in which
the human popsicle fell out of the car and began
loosing his cool all over Route 66. By the time he
got to L.A., he was pretty well rotten to the
corpse.
In response to the many questions I've been
receiving concerning the symposium, I could not
tell if the coffee served was freeze dried, but
certainly no cold cuts were served.
