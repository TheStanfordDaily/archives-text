Author of over forty books,

Philosophy, Lord Bertrand Russell
will be the focus of a Stanford
sponsored symposium this
Thursday evening, March 5.
Linus Pauling, a fellow Nobel
Laureate, will join George Kreisel

and Julius Moravscik in discussing
the many faceted personality of
the colorful mathematician
philosopher.
Pauling will touch upon
Russell's public life and
participation in the struggle for
world peace, while Kreisel will
highlight Russell's work in logic,
and Moravscik will discuss

Russell's contributions to
philosophy.
Born in Victorian England,
Russell was witness to the events
of nearly a century of Western
Civilization from the
Spanish-American War to the war
in Vietnam. A proponent of
disarmament, Russell was an
outspoken critic of America's
involvement in Southeast Asia.
Influenced Thought
Lord Russell first became
involved in a broad range of social
and political issues during the
First World War and became a
dominant influence on many areas
of Anglo-American philosophical
thought through his critical
commentary on the events and
the ideas of his times.
Russell first gained acclaim for
his co-authorship of Principia
Ma the matiea, a work whose main
thesis is the interrelationship of
math and logic, one that has had a
dramatic effect on the direction
of mathematical thought and
education.
The symposium will begin
Thursday at 8 p.m. in the Art
Auditorium, and admission will be
free.
