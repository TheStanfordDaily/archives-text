# Sonar Device To Help Check Heart
## 
### 
Scientists from the Stanford University University School of
Medicine and NASA's Ames Research Center have teamed up and
successfully tested a new application of sonar (often called
ultrasound) that can pry out secrets about the functioning of the
human heart. The new use of sonar can provide fundamentals of the
heart beat and blood circulation heretofore unobtainable without
passing a catheter (a long thin tube) into one of the heart chambers.
That procedure, known as cardiac catheterization, requires many
hours and the patient is usually hospitalized.
By contrast, ultrasound studies of the heart can be done by a
well-trained person in the physician's office or at the patient's bedside
in a matter of minutes. The technique can be applied as a screening
procedure for patients with known or suspected heart disease. And it
can be used to monitor precisely the heart's healing process in patients
recovering from open heart surgery or from a heart attack.
Unlike standard monitoring devices, sonar measures precisely the
amount of blood which is pumped out of the heart at each
contraction of the heart muscle. It also measures heart size and the
backward flow of blood which indicates that the patient has a
defective heart valve.
The work began as a result of interest by NASA in ultrasonics as
one of several techniques for using external instrumentation for
medical research during manned space flights, and coincided with
interest in ultrasonics here.
The Stanford work is supported by grants from NASA-Ames, the
National Institutes of Health, and the American Heart Association.
NASA is seeking devices to collect and record information on human
heart action during space flights, according to Dr. Donald C. Harrison,
the principal investigator.
Now that the use of sonar in heart monitoring has proved its value,
work will begin to build ultrasound devices that are small enough to
be carried in orbiting space laboratories. In addition, scientists will
study the use of computers for storage, retrieval, and instant
interpretation of ultrasound recordings received on earth.
The instrumentation work will be done by researchers at Ames.
Testing of the new devices in human patients available machine which
emits and receives high-frequency sound waves. As sonic impulses
were bounced against front and rear walls of the heart, they were
recorded and converted into electrical signals which were displayed on
a television screen. From the patterns of ultrasonic echoes, taken
when the heart is relaxed and when it contracts, the researchers
developed a formula enabling them to calculate precisely the volume
of blood ejected by the heart, and also determine the presence of
abnormalities.
Dr. Harrison said that from a medical standpoint the technique is
promising and warrants further investigation to refine it "because it is
painless, simpler, safer, and less costly to the patient than present
methods."

ultrasound) that can pry out secrets about the functioning of the
human heart. The new use of sonar can provide fundamentals of the
heart beat and blood circulation heretofore unobtainable without
passing a catheter (a long thin tube) into one of the heart chambers.
That procedure, known as cardiac catheterization, requires many
hours and the patient is usually hospitalized.
By contrast, ultrasound studies of the heart can be done by a
well-trained person in the physician's office or at the patient's bedside
in a matter of minutes. The technique can be applied as a screening
procedure for patients with known or suspected heart disease. And it
can be used to monitor precisely the heart's healing process in patients
recovering from open heart surgery or from a heart attack.
Unlike standard monitoring devices, sonar measures precisely the
amount of blood which is pumped out of the heart at each
contraction of the heart muscle. It also measures heart size and the
backward flow of blood which indicates that the patient has a
defective heart valve.
The work began as a result of interest by NASA in ultrasonics as
one of several techniques for using external instrumentation for
medical research during manned space flights, and coincided with
interest in ultrasonics here.
The Stanford work is supported by grants from NASA-Ames, the
National Institutes of Health, and the American Heart Association.
NASA is seeking devices to collect and record information on human
heart action during space flights, according to Dr. Donald C. Harrison,
the principal investigator.
Now that the use of sonar in heart monitoring has proved its value,
work will begin to build ultrasound devices that are small enough to
be carried in orbiting space laboratories. In addition, scientists will
study the use of computers for storage, retrieval, and instant
interpretation of ultrasound recordings received on earth.
The instrumentation work will be done by researchers at Ames.
Testing of the new devices in human patients available machine which
emits and receives high-frequency sound waves. As sonic impulses
were bounced against front and rear walls of the heart, they were
recorded and converted into electrical signals which were displayed on
a television screen. From the patterns of ultrasonic echoes, taken
when the heart is relaxed and when it contracts, the researchers
developed a formula enabling them to calculate precisely the volume
of blood ejected by the heart, and also determine the presence of
abnormalities.
Dr. Harrison said that from a medical standpoint the technique is
promising and warrants further investigation to refine it "because it is
painless, simpler, safer, and less costly to the patient than present
methods."
