## Introducing The Rock Guitar 
### 
By PROGRESSHORNSBY
The other day, as I listened to
my favorite Ruby and the
Romantics rendition of 'Surfs up ,
I reflected that others, less
musically inclined or poorly
exposed to American rock music,
might not catch the subtle and
moving emotions evoked by the
Rock Idiom. To my discomfiture,
some view the entire Rock
Culture as "noisy, dirty,
long-haired fags" and ignore the
significant cultural contribution
made. The purpose of this column
is thus to explain long-haired,
noisy fags, rock instruments, rock
music, rock culture, rock trucks,
rock gardens, etc., in language the
normal cretin can
understand.FlßST LESSON- the
Rock Guitar (gih-tar)
When you attend a rock
concert (lesson no. 18) you will
notice the rock musician (lesson
no. 6) holding a roughly
rectangular object (with small
horns and a long stick protruding)
in front of his body (this is not
for modesty - most rock musicians
in fact have arms pivoting in this
manner).
This is the Rock Guitar, the
six-stringed, electric counterpart
to the 16th century nine-stringed
instrument conceived by
Archangelo Spumoni Guitarocini
(who in turn copied from the
ancient shepherds "yoni", a
three-stringed slingshot used to
harvest olives). As is obvious to
the careful observer, the Rock
Guitar is the culmination of
hundreds of years of selective
breeding, improvement and
experimentation.
Powers
Such experimentation has led

to electricity as the standard form
of sound reproduction, although
notable exceptions exist, such as
the crude "acoustic" guitar
(powered by tuned aerosol
deodorant cans) and the beautiful
but ill-fated "steam" guitar of
Federenki Norelco, noted Russian
composer whose body was lost at
the disastrous Krakatoa concert.
Some far-sighted individuals have
even prophesied atomic power for
the music of the future (although
claims of "glowing in the dark"
have been generally discounted.)
Tradition has prevailed
however with respect to the shape
of the guitar - you will notice
almost every premium guitar has
the distinctive "double-horn"
shape, derived from Guitarocini's

original model, the 16th centur.

of note was Bo Diddly, whose
offensive "boilin' Memphis bat
Back" square and triangular
guitars gained him ostracism and
an untimely end at the hands of
an enraged clamato growers
convention.
Tradition
Since this incident, no guitar
manufacturer has seen fit to alter
the classic shape; in fact, one
guitar, the Gipson Lesball, has
been included in the permanent
collection of the Bigelow Museum
of Contemporary Design
(Renfrew, 111.).

"chord" (cord), a melodious
permutation of the diatonic scale,
while the "lead" guitarist
(pronounced 'lead', not 'led' as a
recently popular German
balloonist group has mistakenly
pronounced it) plays single notes
in such a combination to titillate
the eardrum, and the bass plays
throbbing deep tones simulating
the womb. The entire effect has
been compared to birth inside an

number of fingers the guitarist
has. The Bass Guitar (base) has

four strings, not due as generally
believed to the limited intelligence
and imagination of bass players,
but rather to the number of
fingers he can utilize (trained
from birth for this exacting
profession, the bass player has his
thumb and index finger broken
repeatedly to form an elegant and
functional music-stand).

The strings on the guitar are
the E,A,D,G,B and E, according
to the 13 note western diatonic
scale (they can be easily
remembered by the simple
nemonic devide "Entropy Being
Good Denies Autistic Existence,"
or for the bass G,D,A, and E
strings, "Good Dates Are Easy").
