## Stone Flute: Mann's New Bag 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
The riffs and turns from Herbie
Mann's flute are filling the
recording halls of Atlantic
Records these days. Chauvinism
aside, Atlantic has been doing fine
things for jazz aficionados lately,
and these new releases are an
example.
"Stone Flute" is the latest
Mann offering, produced on the
new Embryo label. Released by
Atlantic at the same time is "The
Best of Herbie Mann" in their
Jazz Anthology series, which also
includes "Best of" albums by Ray
Charles, John Coltrane and others.
Within the last year, two other
Mann discs were released, also on
Atlantic: "Live at the Whisky A
Go Go" released last Fall; and
"Memphis Underground" which
came out in early summer, sold
consistently high on the charts,
and whose title tune has already
become a minor Mann classic.
Parenthetically, that album
also includes what I consider to be
Herbie Mann's most creative
production, "The Battle Hymn of
the Republic," which brings the
whole emotion of what that song
once meant into today's idiom. I
find it a moving experience,
comparable to Beethoven's Ninth
in depth of meaning.
"Stone Flute" represents a new
experiment by Herbie Mann
within the jazz framework. He
has, at one time or another, been
enamored of styles as different as

Beßop and Bossa Nova.
Constantly on tour, he uses his
travel to become exposed to new
sounds.
After a tour of Africa, his style
shifted from Latin-Afro to Afro,
he added another conga, and

skipped the brass. At another time
he dropped the African beat and
added two trombones giving more
of a big-band jazz sound.
And now, in "Stone Flute,"
Herbie imitates sounds of India
with violins, viola and cello, and

includes guitar, completely
eliminating brass personnel. The
result is unexpected: the meeting
of raga and jazz, just as Yehudi
Menuhin and Ravi Shankar
brought classical and raga together
a few years back.
Mann Tunes
Included on the album are
seven tracks with an unusually
long playing time for a jazz LP:
over forty minutes. Songs by
Mann include "Paradise Beach",
"Dont't You Know the Way","Miss
Free Spirit", and "Waltz for My
Son". Lennon and McCartney's
"Flying" beautifully fills five
minutes of the first side.
Mann is unlikely to stay in the
"Stone Flute" bag very long. I
expect to see a new release at least
every six months on Embryo for
some time to come, and we can
look forward to any number of
stylistic changes.
Mann is like Miles Davis in this
respect, except that Miles
occassionally abandons music
altogether in his search for
"sound". And, as can be heard on
the "Live" album, Mann does not
stick rigidly to one format in
concert, even though one album
may be devoted to an exploration
of a particular idea.
So, as an introduction to
Herbie Mann, or even as an
introduction to jazz, pick up on
"Stone Flute" and "Memphis
Underground." You will be
treated to one of his most
creative moods.


STONED—Herbie Mann gets it on in his new album, "Stone Flute" on Embryo
Records, released by Atlantic.
