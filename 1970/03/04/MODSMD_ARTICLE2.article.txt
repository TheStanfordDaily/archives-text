# Panofsky Highlights Science Convocation
## 
### 
Talks by Dr. Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of SLAC, Dr.
Charles Schwartz, UC Berkeley
and a recently released "secret"
film of the effects of the nuclear
bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki will highlight the
Stanford Convocation to Discuss
Beneficial Uses of Technology
tonight.
The Stanford convocation,
together with a daytime meeting
in Berkeley is being held in
conjunction with a nationwide
program by engineers and
scientists. Other convocations are
being held at MIT, Chicago and
UCLA.
Panofsky, who has gained
prominence as an opponent of the
ABM system and as chief arms
negotiator at various arms
limitation talks, will discuss
general issues as well as the
significance of the upcoming
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
and the Nixon Administration's
recent push for expansion of the
ABM system.
His talk, scheduled for 8 p.m.
in Memorial Church, will be
supplemented by a 16-minute film
on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki
bombings. The film, classified as
"secret" for 25 years, was taken
immediately after the nuclear

explosions by Japanese
cameramen and depicts the scenes
of utter destruction by blast and
fire as well as footage of victims in
emergency hospitals who
had suffered radiation burns and
mutilation.
This will be the first time that
the film, released by the Columbia
University Press, will have been
shown outside of New York.
After the film and Panofsky's
talk, several local groups, such as
SWOPSI, will offer brief reports
of the work that they have been
doing in this area.
Dr. Schwartz, who has gained
prominence for his presentation
of "a Hippocratic Oath for
Scientists" to the American
Physical Society's annual meeting
in Chicago, will present his
proposition that all scientists
should refuse to participate in war
research or weapons production as
an ethical standard.
The Berkeley daytime program
will present various panel
discussions, headed by a
discussion of career decisions for
young scientists distressed by
scientific participation in war
research and a ceremonial signing
of Schwartz's pledge against war
research by all interested
scientists.

Talks by Dr. Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of SLAC, Dr.
Charles Schwartz, UC Berkeley
and a recently released "secret"
film of the effects of the nuclear
bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki will highlight the
Stanford Convocation to Discuss
Beneficial Uses of Technology
tonight.
The Stanford convocation,
together with a daytime meeting
in Berkeley is being held in
conjunction with a nationwide
program by engineers and
scientists. Other convocations are
being held at MIT, Chicago and
UCLA.
Panofsky, who has gained
prominence as an opponent of the
ABM system and as chief arms
negotiator at various arms
limitation talks, will discuss
general issues as well as the
significance of the upcoming
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
and the Nixon Administration's
recent push for expansion of the
ABM system.
His talk, scheduled for 8 p.m.
in Memorial Church, will be
supplemented by a 16-minute film
on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki
bombings. The film, classified as
"secret" for 25 years, was taken
immediately after the nuclear

explosions by Japanese
cameramen and depicts the scenes
of utter destruction by blast and
fire as well as footage of victims in
emergency hospitals who
had suffered radiation burns and
mutilation.
This will be the first time that
the film, released by the Columbia
University Press, will have been
shown outside of New York.
After the film and Panofsky's
talk, several local groups, such as
SWOPSI, will offer brief reports
of the work that they have been
doing in this area.
Dr. Schwartz, who has gained
prominence for his presentation
of "a Hippocratic Oath for
Scientists" to the American
Physical Society's annual meeting
in Chicago, will present his
proposition that all scientists
should refuse to participate in war
research or weapons production as
an ethical standard.
The Berkeley daytime program
will present various panel
discussions, headed by a
discussion of career decisions for
young scientists distressed by
scientific participation in war
research and a ceremonial signing
of Schwartz's pledge against war
research by all interested
scientists.
