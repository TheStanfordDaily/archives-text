## Library Listings Aid Overseas Students 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
An awesome amount of
accurate and widely varied
information for students, faculty
and staff interested in work, travel
and study abroad is now available
at Bechtel International Center.
The information has been
collected into an Overseas
Opportunities Library under the
leadership of Lee Zeigler,
Associate Director of the I-Center.
Zeigler feels that the library
will be particularly useful to
students who are not planning on
attending an Overseas Campus
"We want to provide a very broad
non-structured service for people
who want to go abroad and need
information. This is a need that
can be met on a campus like
Stanford's, with so many
individuals who want to see for
themselves and develop their own
programs."
However, he stressed, "we are
not a travel bureau or an
employment agency. We don't try
to stock every good travel book or

specific job listings."
11 o I ps Students Survive
"There are a lot of students
who want to get overseas and just
earn enough to survive. In order
to help them learn about the
possibilities and the limitations,
we've tried to assemble a variety
of books."
The library offers listings of all
American corporations with
offices abroad, as well as files
containing more specific
information concerning particular
countries. There are also
references for teaching
opportunities, in both native and
American schools.
There is a smaller section on
service abroad, privately run
service projects and social work
opportunities. Work camps in
various countries are also listed.
These can provide room and
board and usually involve shorter
time periods than paying jobs.
Difficulty in Getting Jobs
Zeigler emphasized that there
are some difficulties for the
American student who wants to
work abroad. "Many people think
that it's easy, and think in terms
of the summer jobs usually
available in the United States. But
often there are problems with
visas, language requirements, low
salary, and competition with local
students."
The bulk of material is
concerned with study and travel.
Complete guides to universities
abroad and the programs offered
for Americans are available, as
well as the UNICEF listing of all
international scholarships.
The library is now in the
process of organizing a "people
file," a list of individuals who can
be of particular help to students
who want first hand information
on Foreign areas and programs
operating outside the U.S.
Personal Advice
In addition, the staff at the
ICenter is already offering

personal advising for students-who
have individual questions or
problems with overseas travel.
The library is located on the
second floor of the I-Center and is
open on weekdays from 8 to 12
and 1 to 5. All University
students, faculty and staff are
welcome to make use of
the Facilities.

students who are not planning on
attending an Overseas Campus
"We want to provide a very broad
non-structured service for people
who want to go abroad and need
information. This is a need that
can be met on a campus like
Stanford's, with so many
individuals who want to see for
themselves and develop their own
programs."
However, he stressed, "we are
not a travel bureau or an
employment agency. We don't try
to stock every good travel book or

specific job listings."
11 o I ps Students Survive
"There are a lot of students
who want to get overseas and just
earn enough to survive. In order
to help them learn about the
possibilities and the limitations,
we've tried to assemble a variety
of books."
The library offers listings of all
American corporations with
offices abroad, as well as files
containing more specific
information concerning particular
countries. There are also
references for teaching
opportunities, in both native and
American schools.
There is a smaller section on
service abroad, privately run
service projects and social work
opportunities. Work camps in
various countries are also listed.
These can provide room and
board and usually involve shorter
time periods than paying jobs.
Difficulty in Getting Jobs
Zeigler emphasized that there
are some difficulties for the
American student who wants to
work abroad. "Many people think
that it's easy, and think in terms
of the summer jobs usually
available in the United States. But
often there are problems with
visas, language requirements, low
salary, and competition with local
students."
The bulk of material is
concerned with study and travel.
Complete guides to universities
abroad and the programs offered
for Americans are available, as
well as the UNICEF listing of all
international scholarships.
The library is now in the
process of organizing a "people
file," a list of individuals who can
be of particular help to students
who want first hand information
on Foreign areas and programs
operating outside the U.S.
Personal Advice
In addition, the staff at the
ICenter is already offering

personal advising for students-who
have individual questions or
problems with overseas travel.
The library is located on the
second floor of the I-Center and is
open on weekdays from 8 to 12
and 1 to 5. All University
students, faculty and staff are
welcome to make use of
the Facilities.


OPPORTUNITIES - The l-Onter Overseas Opportunities Library has information
about survival overseas.
An awesome amount of
accurate and widely varied
information for students, faculty
and staff interested in work, travel
and study abroad is now available
at Bechtel International Center.
The information has been
collected into an Overseas
Opportunities Library under the
leadership of Lee Zeigler,
Associate Director of the I-Center.
Zeigler feels that the library
will be particularly useful to
students who are not planning on
attending an Overseas Campus
