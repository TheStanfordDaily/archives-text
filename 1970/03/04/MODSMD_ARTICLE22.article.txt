(Editor's note: Pool scribe
Doug Wilson, afflicted with
bruised fingers and a battered
typewriter, herewith launches into
part three of his epic work on
Stanford swimmers.)
By DOUG WILSON
Bob Jamison's room is
fantastic. On the right wall there
is a Persian rug, and on the left
wall a huge blow-up of Cowboy
Bob, age three, complete with
neck-kerchief, cowboy hat, and
birthday cake. Since Cowboy Bob
is no longer three years old, his
interests have understandably
shifted; the upper-left-hand corner
is devoted to the pictoral
glorification of the naked female
form.
In the corner, by the window,
is a group of plants which is all
that is left of a veritable jungle
which once included six-foot ivy.
The windowshade is bright red,
and pulls down with a raccoon
tail. There is bright red, and pulls
down with a raccoon tail. There is
a telephone receiver which hangs
on the wooden shelf, and a cord
that connects with nothing; there
is a flashing light from a
construction job and a blue plastic
ball that glows in the dark.
Down To Karlh
After being in such heaven, I
swore to Jamison that I would say
nothing of his major (biology), his
home town (San Jose), his
previous swimming background
(at Santa Clara) or his season's
best 100 time (:47.8), let alone
the fact that he is one of
Stanford's top freestyle sprinters.
Silent I remain - Bob will have
wanted it that way.
The sports editors here said to
make the swimmers look human,
which was perfectly fine with
Rick Eagleston, who is a human in
real life. "Most people know me

as a swimmer," Eagleston said,
"and that disturbs me. It's hard to
shed an identity and have people
accept you as a person instead of
a machine."
I almost hate to say that
Eagleston is one of the nation's
finest sprinters. Or that he has
been in freestyle competition for
11 years at Stnta Clara, and this
week ranks seventh in the
Swimming World time-ratings,
with a :21.7 clocking for 50
yards. Or that he is also a
member, along with Jamison, of
the 400 freestyle relay which is
ranked third in the country with a
time of 3:09.6.
Eagleston, a native of Saratoga,
is a junior in political science; "I
like to think of myself as a
radical," he said. After that, I
could hardly ask him what his
goal was for this week's Pacific-8
championships in Washington. But
an anticipated good showing this
weekend should convince the
Swimming World editors to stop
spelling his name "Eggleston."
Let's Face It
It is interesting to watch Brent
Berk's expression after he has
finished swimming a 1000-yard
race, because you get a pretty
good idea of the strain involved in
swimming 40 laps in times like
9:56.0, Berk's season best. That
clocking is good enough to rank
the '68 Olympian eighth
nationally.
Berk has met six of the seven
swimmers ranked ahead of him in
meets against Washington, Yale,
USC and UCLA, but the listings
do not reveal Berk's steady
progress from a less-than-success
ful early lull to a spectacular
showing against USC that was
certainly one of the keys to a very
enjoyable Stanford victory.
Berk, an honors economics

major, is a hard worker and a
dedicated swimming enthusiast.
Teammate Mike Masarie
commented, "Brent's push in
practice is a cohesive force—it
adds spirit and pulls the team
together." Of the'6B Olympics,
Berk said "The big thing for me
was to make the team. I'd been
swimming ever since I was eight,
but my parents and I decided that
Hawaii (his home) didn't have
what I wanted, and I went to train
with George Haines."
One of Berk's teammates at
Santa Clara and Stanford has gone
on to fame and glory as a fireman.
Bob Bebb lives in Firehouse No.
6, across the street from the Shell
gas station. When he is not
fighting fires, which is almost
never, or working on a mechanical
engineering major, which is almost
always, Bebb is this season
enjoying a role as one of
Stanford's fastest-rising swimmers.
The San Jose sophomore is
currently ranked nationally in
both the 50 free (:21.7) and the
100 free (:47.5).
Bebb is one of the most candid
and articulate swimmers. He
admits his annoyance when
others' times begin to come too
close to his, and reveals a metal
aversion to work. "Sprinters hate
to work out," he says, "it's a
mental effort to get into the
water." He enjoys his swimming
recognition: "Perhaps that's why I
swim—l like to be recognized as a
swimmer. I guess that's why I
keep going."
Bebb also has a high regard for
his coach, Jim Gaughran, as do all
of the Stanford varsity. "As far as
sprinters go, Jim really knows
what he's doing. He's a great guy,
an excellent coach," Bebb says.
