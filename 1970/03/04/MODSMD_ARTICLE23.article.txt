## Olivo Nabs Hoop Title 
### FRED LEESON 
Blazing from behind with a
gargantuan display of feminine
basketball virtuosity, the
scrambling quintet from Olivo
smashed its way to the womens
intramural hoop title with a
stunning 15-13 overtime win over
Manzanita last week.
The Olivo sharpshooters, frigid
for the first three quarters, drilled
in all of their three field goals in
the fourth to wipe out an 11-6
deficit and deadlock the title tilt
13-13 at the end of regulation
play.
A pair of free throws in
overtime clinched the victory.
The green-shirted trailerites
dominated their bluc-clad rivals
(the handful of male-chauvinist
IM traditionalists in attendance
were appalled by the absence o'
the hallowed mural custom of
shirts versus skins) for three
quarters, then collapsed.
A scheduling fluke made
Manzanita play two consecutive
games the same night, and fatigue
conquered determination by the
end of the championship game.
Officiating was so
phenomenally abominable
throughout that it came as a
surprise to learn afterward that
the arbiters have not yet been
signed by the Pac-8.
Kathy Lamon paced the
winners with six points and Fran
Liu added four.

But the peaceful fountain and
quiet walkways of the women's
gyrr were no indication of the
fervor inside. Indeed, the
eminently tame breed of typical
weekend female had clearly
become a more vicious animal.
An errant elbow early in the
contest broke Shannon Mow's
glasses, and when Manzanita's
Jean Klick lay decked on the
court with an injured knee while
Olivo's Lamon walked away from
the same rebounding fracas with a
bleeding floor burn in the third
period, it appeared that the
boiling point had arrived.
But the will to gossip overcame
the power of anger, and by the
time Klick had been helped from
the floor members of both teams
had intermingled cooly and were
sharing pertinent details.
Though Olivo had a definite
weight advantage under the
backboards (excuse me, ladies)
Manzanita dominated rebounding
in the opening stages, and its
pressing woman-for-woman
defense forced 1 2 turnovers in the
first three quarters.
Meanwhile, the trailer team
had no trouble penetrating the
Olivo zone, and Pat DeCoster's
driving baseline lay in put
Manzanita up 10-2 at the half.
Olivo trimmed the deficit to
11-6 before its last quarter splurge
caught the panting Manzanitans,
and charity tosses by Liu and Liz
Stone and a key rebound by

Martha Downing settled the
contest in overtime.
Over root beer floats at the
victory celebration in Olivo
lounge (no champagne, alas)
muffled chants of "We're number
one!" broke out, and already
there was talk of recruiting and
prospects for next year's team.
The girls had learned their
lessons well, and as in the game
just concluded, it seemed that
whatever the ladies lacked in
fundamentals they could easily
make up for with an abundance of
cliches.


SCOOPâ€”In the best news tradition, this picture is totally unrelated to the
women's intramural basketball championship since the team shown above is
neither Manzanita nor Olivo, but Donner. Donner, which did compete in the
tourney and was eliminated before the finals, denies any connection with that
event, and the DAILY has ceremoniously destroyed these incriminating
negatives.
