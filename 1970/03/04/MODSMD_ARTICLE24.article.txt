# Bears Dump SU Matmen
## 
### 
Lacking the optimism that
started the season, Stanford
wrestlers finished out their 1970
dual meet schedule with a rough
32-7 loss to UC Berkeley last
weekend. Their season record
settled at 8-4-1.
Stanford picked up five points
when Cal failed to enter an
opponent against Len Smith
(158), and Ray Williams (177)
added the other two with a 7-7
draw against Steve Welch.
The Indians go to the Pac-8
finals March 6-7 where it appears
that Dave Kopolow, Dave
Thomas, Terry Crenshaw and Lee
Fair could still pace the Tribe to
its best league finish in years.
In Saturday's meet Berkeley
scored ten points on two forfeits,
added five more with a pin, and
registered five decisions to make
its 32 point total.
