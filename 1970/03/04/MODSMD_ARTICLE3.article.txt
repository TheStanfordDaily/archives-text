## Whites Attack Black Students 
### 
LAMAR, S.C. (AP) - White
demonstrators were dispersed
with tear gas Tuesday after
overturning two empty school
buses and clashing with police and
Negro pupils on the grounds of
recently integrated Lamar schools.
More than 30 black pupils
suffered cuts and bruises and at
least two police officers were
injured slightly in the melee with
the adult demonstrators, some of
them armed with ax handles,
chains and bricks.
Lamar, a small community in
the agricultural district of
northeastern South Carolina, was
ordered by the federal courts to
integrate under a zoning plan that
transferred several hundred blacks
to a previously all-white school,
and about 120 whites to a
previously all-Negro school.
Principal Gordan Cole said the
pupils injured were hit by thrown
objects and shattering glass from
the school bus windows and that a
doctor was called to the school to
treat the injured children.
"I really don't know how
many were hurt," he said. "There
were several. Some were bruised
and some were cut and some had
glass in their eyes."
The crowd was finally
dispersed when patrolmen used
tear gas. Authorities said there
were no arrests because the whites
quickly scattered and fled.
U. Of m. Riots
CHAMPAIGN, 111. (AP) -
National Guard troops were
deployed on the campus of the

University of Illinois Tuesday
night to break up a crowd of some
5,000 milling students and
enforce a 10:30 p.m. curfew.
Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie had
ordered 750 Illinois National
Guardsmen on standby duty
yesterday after trustees of the
University of Illinois banned a
speech by William M. Kunstler,
lawyer for the Chicago Seven.
Steven Danz, spokesman for
the Concerned Lawyers and Law
Students, sponsors of the speech,
said the group decided to call off
the controversial lawyer's

appearance because of the tension
caused by the trustees' action in
ruling Kunstler could not speak
on campus.
Four hundred police from
Champaign, Urbana and the
university's security force were
called Monday night after 500
students smashed windows in the
campus area. There were 21
arrests.
Yesterday several hundred
university students held a rally on
campus to protest the trustees'
ban. But, no disorders were
reported.
