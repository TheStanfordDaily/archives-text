# Siegel, Wolf Join In Debate Over Military's Presence Here
## 
### JOHN COONROD 
Is it morally intolerant to
remove ROTC from campus was
the topic of a rescheduled debate
held late yesterday afternoon.
The 90 minute, unmoderated
session was waged between ROTC
cadet Mike Wolf and Leonard
Siegel member of the New
Moratorium and SDS, before an
audience of 35.
The debate had been scheduled
for last month, but was postponed
for the State of the University
address.
Wolf, winning the coin toss,
opened by stating tolerance of the
ROTC program was necessary to
the academic freedom "to allow
anyone to study what he wants."
The program's conflict was that of
individual and collective morals.
Further, ROTC was desirable as a
source of enlightened officers if
one agreed the army was
necessary, he said.
Siegel's opening stated the
Stanford ROTC program "is an

attempt to roll back anti-ROTC
sentiment," and that the example
here would effect the nation wide
perspective of stopping ROTC.
"The U.S. Army is the enemy of
the people around the world."
He refuted the argument of
ROTC's liberalizing effect, saying
that at the higher levels there
already exists an elite officer
corps but that he doesn't fear a
coup in the future." There has
already been a coup d'etat of
capital." He added that the nature
of defense department sponsored
research on campuses is harming
people around the world.
In the second round, Wolf
retorted it was "outrageously
unfair to blame the Army" for
U.S. foreign policy, and that the
Left should direct their attack to
the cause, which he specified as
federal government officials. He
said the University should respect
the majority which feels the
military is desirable, "This moral
consensus enjoins tolerance," but

it doens't imply endorsement, he
said.
The term majority sparked
argument from the audience and
the debators. Siegel stated that if
a majority was needed, "I could
get the proxies of 800 million
Chinese and beat you every time."
The world community was
concerned because the U.S.
military presence was world wide,
he said. Wolf replied that the
world society was different
because it wasn't the constituted
authority.
Siegel said that the University
was "not the market place for
ideas." There was not academic
freedom now, he said, as
witnessed that universities cannot
train Black Panther fighters,
guerillas, or Mafia assassins.
Charges were made from the
floor and by Wolf that radicals
were morally arrogant. Another
listener responded that the left
had a just complaint because their
arguments were not aired by the
media.
