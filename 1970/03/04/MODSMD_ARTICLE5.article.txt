# Hypnotic Happening
## Psych I Guru's Grand Circus 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Monday night, when the grand guru of Psych I, Philip G.
Zimbardo, put on his annual hypnotic circus, it felt good to be in
the ring again. We were ready to be put through the paces by our
ringmaster, that Mephostophelian maestro of the mental.
Sitting on the stage in Memorial Auditorium looking out over
the audience, I listened carefully as Zimbardo explained the
demonstration. "We don't do hypnosis as some sort of ego trip, but
merely as a means of learning more about emotions."
"I'll remember that one," I thought to myself, knowing full well
that later than evening I would be asked while under hypnosis to
argue with Zimbardo and to get very mad at him At least I'd have
one good insult for him, I thought.
Waiting on the stage, ready to be induced into hypnosis, I had
only one anxiety—that for the first time, something would not
work. The one thing I really felt good about was the presence of
other people on the stage. The unique experience of hypnosis had
an incredible way of binding us all together.
There was a very strong feeling of closeness and a group
consciousness which seemed almost inconceivable considering the
relatively short lime we had spent together. I think we all had the
feeling that the one thing we wanted to happen was for the
demonstrations to work. It was as if our group identity was on the
line. We all had experienced and therefore believed in hypnosis
together so that any failure would seem a negation of that group
identity.
Blue Blooded Girl
This sense of anxiety quickly disappeared with the first
demonstration in which a girl, by means of a pressure cuff, had no
blood enter her left arm for 10 minutes. Feeling no pain, she
calmly watched her left arm turn blue. An unhypnotized subject
had yielded to the pain created by the cuff about five minutes
before. I think all of us on stage felt a sense of triumph. Her
success was our success.
1 had been put into hypnosis while she was sitting there, yet I
could follow all that happened. It is possible in hypnosis to have
your mind working at two different levels-to have one part of
your mind following what is happening, and at the same time have
another part of your mind totally unconscious, a total blank. This
dual level of the mind is similar to self hypnosis in which one part
of your mind remains totally conscious and gives another part of
your mind the instructions.
The thing I was asked to experience occurrrd whnn Dr.
Zimbardo told me that I would forget my name and that 1 would
become very angry at him when he questioned me about my state
of consciousness. I had known earlier that I would have to do this,
and I was ready to enjoy it. For telling off Zimbardo is one thing
that is never hard to relish.
Can't Cheat the Umpire
In the situation in which 1 was being put, hypnosis becomes
somewhat of a game in which Dr. Zimbardo's instructions are the
rules. These rules are not like the rules of a baseball game, which
you can break when the umpire is not looking. Rather they
become part of you and the following of them is automatic.

The rules in this case were that I was not going to think that I
was hypnotized, while, in fact, I was. As Dr. Zimbardo would ask
questions, I would become more and more irritated at him until he
would ask me my name, which is when I would immediately drop
back into a state of total relaxation, not remembering it.
When he woke me and asked me how I felt, even though there
remained a small part of my conscious that knew what was going
on and what would eventually happen, I was so furious at him I
couldn't speak. Being angry at him felt totally natural.
Every time I insulted him ("You don't use hypnosis as an ego
trip Bullshit. How did an idiot like yourself ever become a
professor?") I felt like I had gained a point. But when he asked me
my name, the anger totally disappeared and I went to sleep as I
knew I should.
I had known all along that he would win in the end. Yet that
was the whole enjoyment of the game, futilely trying to beat him
and put him in his place.
I could have remembered my name if I had had to. It was as if
my name were in a house. Dr. Zimbardo had taken the key to the
house and hidden it under a bush. If I had to know my name I
could have run over and gotten the key. But since, in a way, I
really did not wish to know, I stood there pounding on the door,
trying to get in.
Breast Fed Is Best Fed?
The one frightful experience I had was when Zimbardo
demonstrated age regression. As people went back to six months, I
felt my arms and legs and the nerves in my mouth start to twitch as
though I were being breast fed. Even though the prospect of breast
feeding was fairly enjoyable, I was conscious that some of my
friends in the audience would perhaps never let me live it down,
and I was able to overcome the hypnotic instruction.
For all of us who were on the stage, trying not to experience
something is very rare. For in all of us there is complete faith in Dr.
Zimbardo and the other hypnotic operators whom we have worked
with. There was the greatest desire on the part of all of us not to
let Dr. Zimbardo down, in spite of the fact that, as one subject put
it, "Being hypnotized by Zimbardo is like lending your mind to the
devil."
I suppose I should comment on the drug experience part of the
demonstration in which we all smoked imaginary pipes, and which
I might add, was a very enjoyable part of the evening. Two girls on
either side of me kept talking about the light show on the ceiling
and then when I saw it as well, I knew it was time to put my pipe
away.
In the final part of the demonstration, the whole audience
participated. Holding hands, everyone was put into a deep sense of
relaxation and it was suggested that they could feel at one with the
rest of the audience, and the power of the rest of the audience.
Although different people said they experienced this to varying
degrees, I think it was possible to realize the way in which hypnosis
can enable man to control parts of himself he never thought he
could control.
Through hypnosis, man can control emotions and even reality as
we perceive it normally, and change for the better, making himself
a better person in the process.

identity.
Blue Blooded Girl
This sense of anxiety quickly disappeared with the first
demonstration in which a girl, by means of a pressure cuff, had no
blood enter her left arm for 10 minutes. Feeling no pain, she
calmly watched her left arm turn blue. An unhypnotized subject
had yielded to the pain created by the cuff about five minutes
before. I think all of us on stage felt a sense of triumph. Her
success was our success.
1 had been put into hypnosis while she was sitting there, yet I
could follow all that happened. It is possible in hypnosis to have
your mind working at two different levels-to have one part of
your mind following what is happening, and at the same time have
another part of your mind totally unconscious, a total blank. This
dual level of the mind is similar to self hypnosis in which one part
of your mind remains totally conscious and gives another part of
your mind the instructions.
The thing I was asked to experience occurrrd whnn Dr.
Zimbardo told me that I would forget my name and that 1 would
become very angry at him when he questioned me about my state
of consciousness. I had known earlier that I would have to do this,
and I was ready to enjoy it. For telling off Zimbardo is one thing
that is never hard to relish.
Can't Cheat the Umpire
In the situation in which 1 was being put, hypnosis becomes
somewhat of a game in which Dr. Zimbardo's instructions are the
rules. These rules are not like the rules of a baseball game, which
you can break when the umpire is not looking. Rather they
become part of you and the following of them is automatic.

The rules in this case were that I was not going to think that I
was hypnotized, while, in fact, I was. As Dr. Zimbardo would ask
questions, I would become more and more irritated at him until he
would ask me my name, which is when I would immediately drop
back into a state of total relaxation, not remembering it.
When he woke me and asked me how I felt, even though there
remained a small part of my conscious that knew what was going
on and what would eventually happen, I was so furious at him I
couldn't speak. Being angry at him felt totally natural.
Every time I insulted him ("You don't use hypnosis as an ego
trip Bullshit. How did an idiot like yourself ever become a
professor?") I felt like I had gained a point. But when he asked me
my name, the anger totally disappeared and I went to sleep as I
knew I should.
I had known all along that he would win in the end. Yet that
was the whole enjoyment of the game, futilely trying to beat him
and put him in his place.
I could have remembered my name if I had had to. It was as if
my name were in a house. Dr. Zimbardo had taken the key to the
house and hidden it under a bush. If I had to know my name I
could have run over and gotten the key. But since, in a way, I
really did not wish to know, I stood there pounding on the door,
trying to get in.
Breast Fed Is Best Fed?
The one frightful experience I had was when Zimbardo
demonstrated age regression. As people went back to six months, I
felt my arms and legs and the nerves in my mouth start to twitch as
though I were being breast fed. Even though the prospect of breast
feeding was fairly enjoyable, I was conscious that some of my
friends in the audience would perhaps never let me live it down,
and I was able to overcome the hypnotic instruction.
For all of us who were on the stage, trying not to experience
something is very rare. For in all of us there is complete faith in Dr.
Zimbardo and the other hypnotic operators whom we have worked
with. There was the greatest desire on the part of all of us not to
let Dr. Zimbardo down, in spite of the fact that, as one subject put
it, "Being hypnotized by Zimbardo is like lending your mind to the
devil."
I suppose I should comment on the drug experience part of the
demonstration in which we all smoked imaginary pipes, and which
I might add, was a very enjoyable part of the evening. Two girls on
either side of me kept talking about the light show on the ceiling
and then when I saw it as well, I knew it was time to put my pipe
away.
In the final part of the demonstration, the whole audience
participated. Holding hands, everyone was put into a deep sense of
relaxation and it was suggested that they could feel at one with the
rest of the audience, and the power of the rest of the audience.
Although different people said they experienced this to varying
degrees, I think it was possible to realize the way in which hypnosis
can enable man to control parts of himself he never thought he
could control.
Through hypnosis, man can control emotions and even reality as
we perceive it normally, and change for the better, making himself
a better person in the process.
Monday night, when the grand guru of Psych I, Philip G.
Zimbardo, put on his annual hypnotic circus, it felt good to be in
the ring again. We were ready to be put through the paces by our
ringmaster, that Mephostophelian maestro of the mental.
Sitting on the stage in Memorial Auditorium looking out over
the audience, I listened carefully as Zimbardo explained the
demonstration. "We don't do hypnosis as some sort of ego trip, but
merely as a means of learning more about emotions."
"I'll remember that one," I thought to myself, knowing full well
that later than evening I would be asked while under hypnosis to
argue with Zimbardo and to get very mad at him At least I'd have
one good insult for him, I thought.
Waiting on the stage, ready to be induced into hypnosis, I had
only one anxiety—that for the first time, something would not
work. The one thing I really felt good about was the presence of
other people on the stage. The unique experience of hypnosis had
an incredible way of binding us all together.
There was a very strong feeling of closeness and a group
consciousness which seemed almost inconceivable considering the
relatively short lime we had spent together. I think we all had the
feeling that the one thing we wanted to happen was for the
demonstrations to work. It was as if our group identity was on the
line. We all had experienced and therefore believed in hypnosis
together so that any failure would seem a negation of that group
identity.

somewhat of a game in which Dr. Zimbardo's instructions are the
rules. These rules are not like the rules of a baseball game, which
you can break when the umpire is not looking. Rather they
become part of you and the following of them is automatic.

The rules in this case were that I was not going to think that I
was hypnotized, while, in fact, I was. As Dr. Zimbardo would ask
questions, I would become more and more irritated at him until he
would ask me my name, which is when I would immediately drop
back into a state of total relaxation, not remembering it.
When he woke me and asked me how I felt, even though there
remained a small part of my conscious that knew what was going
on and what would eventually happen, I was so furious at him I
couldn't speak. Being angry at him felt totally natural.
Every time I insulted him ("You don't use hypnosis as an ego
trip Bullshit. How did an idiot like yourself ever become a
professor?") I felt like I had gained a point. But when he asked me
my name, the anger totally disappeared and I went to sleep as I
knew I should.
I had known all along that he would win in the end. Yet that
was the whole enjoyment of the game, futilely trying to beat him
and put him in his place.
I could have remembered my name if I had had to. It was as if
my name were in a house. Dr. Zimbardo had taken the key to the
house and hidden it under a bush. If I had to know my name I
could have run over and gotten the key. But since, in a way, I
really did not wish to know, I stood there pounding on the door,
trying to get in.
Breast Fed Is Best Fed?
The one frightful experience I had was when Zimbardo
demonstrated age regression. As people went back to six months, I
felt my arms and legs and the nerves in my mouth start to twitch as
though I were being breast fed. Even though the prospect of breast
feeding was fairly enjoyable, I was conscious that some of my
friends in the audience would perhaps never let me live it down,
and I was able to overcome the hypnotic instruction.
For all of us who were on the stage, trying not to experience
something is very rare. For in all of us there is complete faith in Dr.
Zimbardo and the other hypnotic operators whom we have worked
with. There was the greatest desire on the part of all of us not to
let Dr. Zimbardo down, in spite of the fact that, as one subject put
it, "Being hypnotized by Zimbardo is like lending your mind to the
devil."
I suppose I should comment on the drug experience part of the
demonstration in which we all smoked imaginary pipes, and which
I might add, was a very enjoyable part of the evening. Two girls on
either side of me kept talking about the light show on the ceiling
and then when I saw it as well, I knew it was time to put my pipe
away.
In the final part of the demonstration, the whole audience
participated. Holding hands, everyone was put into a deep sense of
relaxation and it was suggested that they could feel at one with the
rest of the audience, and the power of the rest of the audience.
Although different people said they experienced this to varying
degrees, I think it was possible to realize the way in which hypnosis
can enable man to control parts of himself he never thought he
could control.
Through hypnosis, man can control emotions and even reality as
we perceive it normally, and change for the better, making himself
a better person in the process.
Monday night, when the grand guru of Psych I, Philip G.
Zimbardo, put on his annual hypnotic circus, it felt good to be in
the ring again. We were ready to be put through the paces by our
ringmaster, that Mephostophelian maestro of the mental.
Sitting on the stage in Memorial Auditorium looking out over
the audience, I listened carefully as Zimbardo explained the
demonstration. "We don't do hypnosis as some sort of ego trip, but
merely as a means of learning more about emotions."
"I'll remember that one," I thought to myself, knowing full well
that later than evening I would be asked while under hypnosis to
argue with Zimbardo and to get very mad at him At least I'd have
one good insult for him, I thought.
Waiting on the stage, ready to be induced into hypnosis, I had
only one anxiety—that for the first time, something would not
work. The one thing I really felt good about was the presence of
other people on the stage. The unique experience of hypnosis had
an incredible way of binding us all together.
There was a very strong feeling of closeness and a group
consciousness which seemed almost inconceivable considering the
relatively short lime we had spent together. I think we all had the
feeling that the one thing we wanted to happen was for the
demonstrations to work. It was as if our group identity was on the
line. We all had experienced and therefore believed in hypnosis
together so that any failure would seem a negation of that group
identity.
Blue Blooded Girl
This sense of anxiety quickly disappeared with the first
demonstration in which a girl, by means of a pressure cuff, had no
blood enter her left arm for 10 minutes. Feeling no pain, she
calmly watched her left arm turn blue. An unhypnotized subject
had yielded to the pain created by the cuff about five minutes
before. I think all of us on stage felt a sense of triumph. Her
success was our success.
1 had been put into hypnosis while she was sitting there, yet I
could follow all that happened. It is possible in hypnosis to have
your mind working at two different levels-to have one part of
your mind following what is happening, and at the same time have
another part of your mind totally unconscious, a total blank. This
dual level of the mind is similar to self hypnosis in which one part
of your mind remains totally conscious and gives another part of
your mind the instructions.
The thing I was asked to experience occurrrd whnn Dr.
Zimbardo told me that I would forget my name and that 1 would
become very angry at him when he questioned me about my state
of consciousness. I had known earlier that I would have to do this,
and I was ready to enjoy it. For telling off Zimbardo is one thing
that is never hard to relish.
