# Peripheral Canals
## Water For California 
### Andy Smith 
The California Water Plan is a
proposed system of dams,
reservoirs, and canals, interlaced
throughout the northern part of
the state, with one principal
objective in mindâ€”bringing
northern water to the populated
urban areas of the south. For
while about 75% of California's
naturally flowing water is found
in the norther third of the state,
most of the people reside in areas
to the south.
Work on this massive system,
some of which has been
completed, was begun after 1960,
when the voters approved a $1.75
billion bond issue. In fact, the
cost of the entire project is now
estimated to be about $3 billion.
One of the crucial parts of the
water plan is the Peripheral Canal,
presently under construction,
which upon completion will divert
water from the Sacramento River,
near the town of Hood, 40 miles
south to Tracy, from where it can
be pumped to prime targets in the
south, such as Los Angeles, via the
California Aqueduct. In so doing,
the canal will interrupt much of
the natural inflow to the rich
Delta area, which is formed by the
junction of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin rivers.
A number of ecological studies
in this area have left no doubt
that this inflow is critical, for
several reasons: 1) it flushes
pollutants out from the Delta to
the coast; 2) it keeps back the
advance of seawater, and with it

an intolerable increase in salinity
levels, upon the Delta region,
much of which is below sea level;
and 3) it maintains appropriate
spawning conditions, which
include factors such as the rate
and direction of water flow,
temperature, oxygen
concentration, and particulate
concentration of the water, for
the fish which breed in the Delta,
primarily striped bass and king
salmon.
While some or all of these
conditions could be partially or
completely satisfied if the
Peripheral Canal were to be
constructed according to
rigidly-specified regulations, there
is no reason forassuming that such
regulations would be followed. A
perhaps more important reason
for doubt lies in the fact that
virtually every major
technological imposition on
nature brings unpredicted
ecological consequences. As put
by one ecologist who studied the
Delta region, Fred Tarp, "Some
answers to these problems can be
given only after the canal has
started to operate."
This is not good enough.
California's environment is
already in serious enough trouble.
A stop to population and
economic expansion is urgently
needed now, and it is naive to
expect that this will happen if
water projects continue to be
carried out while reflecting future
needs. The environment of Los
Angeles and vicinity, as well as

that of the Bay Area, has already
deteriorated to the point where
future popular or economic
expansion is suicide.
If further sources of water
were not made available to these
areas, their inhabitants would be
forced to supply their own water,
by desalinating portions of the
nearby ocean, or more hopefully,
to eliminate growth by a
combination of mass birth control
and economic reform. A third
alternative, migration to less
populated areas of the state,
would probably add as many
environmental problems as it
solved. In any case, however,
people would begin to learn that
they cannot continue to thrive by
expanding at the expense of the
northern wilderness regions.
Anyone who can vote has at
least a small chance of halting this
insanity. Proposition 7, a
constitutional amendment to raise
the maximum interest rate on
state water bonds from 5 to 7%,
will come before the voters in
June. Without this increase, the
state will not be able to sell
enough bonds to finance the
completion of the Peripheral
Canal. The halting of this
construction, in turn, may force
the "complete re-examination of
the California Water Plan"
requested by the Board of
Directors of the Sierra Club in a
statement issued Feb. 14. Vote
no.
