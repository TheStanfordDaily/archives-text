Editor, THE DAILY:
I think it is absurd to see the
University Food Service claim
that it loses "$400,000 a year; in
whioh $100,000 is due to
unlimited servings, when on
Monday, March Ist, I could not
even get a second HAMBURGER
in Lagunita because they ran out.
I would like to ask the ASSU
University Committee on Food
Service to recommend next year
that it not be mandatory for those
who live in Stanford dorms to
have to purchase meals from the
food service.

STRANGE COUSIN
Editor, THE DAILY:
Once upon a time a man and
woman decided to have a child.
To help pay for the initial costs,
the man donated some money and

the woman loaned some which
was later repaid (with interest).
The child was born and the man
and woman provided some initial
nurture. The woman provided a
plot of ground at cost. At a very
early age the child was turned
loose to support and educate
itself. The mother and child lived
close together and occasionally
shared experiences and resources.
The mother designated a group fo

"relatives" to periodically review
and direct the infant's activities.
As the infant grew into and
through its teen years, the father
occasionally gave small amounts
of money and/or advice. The
mother encouraged "donations"
to herself from the offspring and
generally prohibited the growing
child from seeking scholarships or
other supplementary funds to aid
in his growth and education,
meanwhile eagerly seeking large
donations from the same sources
denied to the offspring.

As the youth approached age
24, some of the mother's nearer
and dearer children objected to
this strange, grown-up "cousin",
saying that they didn't approve of
some of the ways it earned its
money, and urging that they help
instruct and direct it in what was
morally right. Some threw rocks
and paint and shouted obscenities
at it.
The mother then decided that
this grown child should either be
sold to the highest bidder (to
provide maximum gain for herself
and her other offspring, regardless
of the effect on it), or that it
should be made to buy its
freedom by giving her substantial
payments during the next 20 to
25 year period, to recompsnse her
for the tender-loving-care she had
provided through the years.

"A New Low"
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to the belief of Rabbi
Familant, I fear it is not Miss
Mihaly but Rabbi Familant
himself who has sunk to "a new
low." He appears to think it
sufficient to call Miss Mihaly
"misinformed and unbalanced" in
order to have her representation
of the Middle East discounted. At
least she is willing to back her
arguments up with facts which is
more than I can say for Rabbi
Familant. If he wishes to put
forward another interpretation of
the Middle East, I would be
interested in reading what he has
to say. If he merely wishes to
dodge the issue and indulge in
character assassination, Rabbi
Familant would do well to heed
his own advice and not share his
own "problems" with the readers
of the Daily.

INFO CENTER
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the February 4th Daily
Stanford's Black community
appealed to the University at large
and the white community in
particular to keep a vital service to
East Palo Alto the Info Center
alive. Since the assasination of Dr.
Martin Luther King white people
have been asking 'What can I do'.
Here is a concrete issue where
there is a definite opportunity for
everyone concerned to do
something specific.
Perhaps here is also an
opportunity for the white
community to discover its role in
finding solutions to the racial
problems of the United States.
The liberal days of fantasy, where
good whites lead and help their
black brothers, are over. These are
positions most appropriately and
successfully carried out by the
black movement itself - this is
black power.
We are a small part of a
University that regardless of the
races or backgrounds of it
participants, or its political stands,
is a source of many of the forces
of white America that control our
nation now and will continue to
do so in the future. As such it is
of vital importance that we begin
now to confront those problems
which institutions such as ours
have helped to create. W<> claim to
care but w«> must take the step
from dreams to reality and utilize

I think it is absurd to see the
University Food Service claim
that it loses "$400,000 a year; in
whioh $100,000 is due to
unlimited servings, when on
Monday, March Ist, I could not
even get a second HAMBURGER

STRANGE COUSIN
Editor, THE DAILY:
Once upon a time a man and
woman decided to have a child.
To help pay for the initial costs,
the man donated some money and

the woman loaned some which
was later repaid (with interest).
The child was born and the man
and woman provided some initial
nurture. The woman provided a
plot of ground at cost. At a very
early age the child was turned
loose to support and educate
itself. The mother and child lived
close together and occasionally
shared experiences and resources.
The mother designated a group fo

"relatives" to periodically review
and direct the infant's activities.
As the infant grew into and
through its teen years, the father
occasionally gave small amounts
of money and/or advice. The
mother encouraged "donations"
to herself from the offspring and
generally prohibited the growing
child from seeking scholarships or
other supplementary funds to aid
in his growth and education,
meanwhile eagerly seeking large
donations from the same sources
denied to the offspring.

As the youth approached age
24, some of the mother's nearer
and dearer children objected to
this strange, grown-up "cousin",
saying that they didn't approve of
some of the ways it earned its
money, and urging that they help
instruct and direct it in what was
morally right. Some threw rocks
and paint and shouted obscenities
at it.
The mother then decided that
this grown child should either be
sold to the highest bidder (to
provide maximum gain for herself
and her other offspring, regardless
of the effect on it), or that it
should be made to buy its
freedom by giving her substantial
payments during the next 20 to
25 year period, to recompsnse her
for the tender-loving-care she had
provided through the years.

"A New Low"
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to the belief of Rabbi
Familant, I fear it is not Miss
Mihaly but Rabbi Familant
himself who has sunk to "a new
low." He appears to think it
sufficient to call Miss Mihaly
"misinformed and unbalanced" in
order to have her representation
of the Middle East discounted. At
least she is willing to back her
arguments up with facts which is
more than I can say for Rabbi
Familant. If he wishes to put
forward another interpretation of
the Middle East, I would be
interested in reading what he has
to say. If he merely wishes to
dodge the issue and indulge in
character assassination, Rabbi
Familant would do well to heed
his own advice and not share his
own "problems" with the readers
of the Daily.

Stanford's Black community
appealed to the University at large

particular to keep a vital service to
East Palo Alto the Info Center
alive. Since the assasination of Dr.
Martin Luther King white people
have been asking 'What can I do'.
Here is a concrete issue where
there is a definite opportunity for

Perhaps here is also an

RAW MEAT
Editor, THE DAILY:
I think it is absurd to see the
University Food Service claim
that it loses "$400,000 a year; in
whioh $100,000 is due to
unlimited servings, when on
Monday, March Ist, I could not
even get a second HAMBURGER
in Lagunita because they ran out.
I would like to ask the ASSU
University Committee on Food
Service to recommend next year
that it not be mandatory for those
who live in Stanford dorms to
have to purchase meals from the
food service.

STRANGE COUSIN
Editor, THE DAILY:
Once upon a time a man and
woman decided to have a child.
To help pay for the initial costs,
the man donated some money and

the woman loaned some which
was later repaid (with interest).
The child was born and the man
and woman provided some initial
nurture. The woman provided a
plot of ground at cost. At a very
early age the child was turned
loose to support and educate
itself. The mother and child lived
close together and occasionally
shared experiences and resources.
The mother designated a group fo

"relatives" to periodically review
and direct the infant's activities.
As the infant grew into and
through its teen years, the father
occasionally gave small amounts
of money and/or advice. The
mother encouraged "donations"
to herself from the offspring and
generally prohibited the growing
child from seeking scholarships or
other supplementary funds to aid
in his growth and education,
meanwhile eagerly seeking large
donations from the same sources
denied to the offspring.

As the youth approached age
24, some of the mother's nearer
and dearer children objected to
this strange, grown-up "cousin",
saying that they didn't approve of
some of the ways it earned its
money, and urging that they help
instruct and direct it in what was
morally right. Some threw rocks
and paint and shouted obscenities
at it.
The mother then decided that
this grown child should either be
sold to the highest bidder (to
provide maximum gain for herself
and her other offspring, regardless
of the effect on it), or that it
should be made to buy its
freedom by giving her substantial
payments during the next 20 to
25 year period, to recompsnse her
for the tender-loving-care she had
provided through the years.

"A New Low"
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to the belief of Rabbi
Familant, I fear it is not Miss
Mihaly but Rabbi Familant
himself who has sunk to "a new
low." He appears to think it
sufficient to call Miss Mihaly
"misinformed and unbalanced" in
order to have her representation
of the Middle East discounted. At
least she is willing to back her
arguments up with facts which is
more than I can say for Rabbi
Familant. If he wishes to put
forward another interpretation of
the Middle East, I would be
interested in reading what he has
to say. If he merely wishes to
dodge the issue and indulge in
character assassination, Rabbi
Familant would do well to heed
his own advice and not share his
own "problems" with the readers
of the Daily.
