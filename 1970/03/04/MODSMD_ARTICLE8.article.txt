# Overseas Requirements
## Pass-Fail Grading? 
### Forrest Frank 
As the party most responsible for communication with the home
campus on the matter of Pass/Fail grading for Foreign Language
Courses offered at the overseas campuses, I feel somewhat obliged to
offer a student's view of the problem and petition referred to by Dr.
Walker in his reply to the Daily's expose on the Overseas Campuses.
The petition to which Dr. Walker referred took two forms. The real
petition was addressed not to Dr. Walker or even the Overseas
Campuses Office but to President Pitzer and asked for an advisory
opinion on "an Unnamed Committee meeting at an unspecified time
and place prohibiting instructors from conducting their classes in a
manner they thought appropriate." This petition was sent after we
patiently waited six weeks for answers to the Director of Studies,
Professor Peter Foulkes, inquiries into the mysterious committee
responsible for the "no Pass/Fail in Overseas Language Courses" edict.
Petition Unanswered
The petition did bring about an answer. The Sub-Committee on
Overseas Campuses, a subcommittee of the Committee on General
Studies was indeed responsible for that decision. Professor Clebsch,
responding independently of President Pitzer explained that the
Sub-Committee was indeed empowered to make such a ruling as
participation in the language programs at the Overseas Campuses was
required of all students and could be treated as a requirement and
thereby exempted from the Pass/Fail option.
The fault for the acrimony around the petition of Germany XXIII
lies largely with the students, in-so-far as we failed to consult directly
with Dr. Walker about the issue at hand. However, in all fairness to
the students, had Dr. Walker answered Professor Foulkes' direct
inquiries as to which committee meeting where and when, students
might have been more eager to correspond directly with him.
Reconsider Policy
As the Foreign Language Requirement has now been eliminated
from General Studies Requirements, I hope that the Subcommittees
on the individual Overseas Campuses will raise the issue of Pass/Fail
grading and reconsider the existing policy.
It should be noted that should the policy be changed by any of the
Subcommittees of the Committee on Foreign Study Programs, the
ultimate decision about Pass/Fail grading in Language Courses would
rest with the individual instructors. It would be they who would
determine whether students would be allowed to take a foreign
language course at an Overseas Campus on a Pass/Fail basis.
