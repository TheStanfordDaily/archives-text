# MIT Plan Allows No ROTC Credit
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The chairman of the
Massachusett's Institute of
Technology (MIT) faculty
committee on ROTC yesterday
confirmed that no credit will be
given to ROTC courses under a
new plan now in its final stages.
Prof. Fred McGarry denied
report from Stanford Vice-Provost
Howard Brooks that a provost's
committee at MIT would be able
to grant any credit to ROTC
courses. This provost's committee,
composed of faculty and
administrative personnel, has the
"general responsibility for
monitoring an overseeing" ROTC,
according to McGarry.
The provost's committee will
have eight or nine specific
assignments including: supervising
ROTC courses that would not
have credit; negotiating with the
ROTC on behalf of students who
disenroll from the program;
approving the appointment of
ROTC instructors; and applying
continuous pressure on national
levels to develop an adequate
ROTC policy.
McGarry also denied a report
by Stanford Prof. Stephen Line,
mechanical engineering, given at
the Academic Council meeting
that under the MIT program a
military instructor might be able
to teach a course in conjunction
with a regular professor with the
regular professor only giving the
first one or two lectures. McGarry
said that this "circumvention
would be most unlikely."
Theoretically it would be
possible for an ROTC* officer to
teach a course in a regular MIT
department, but this would also
be very unlikely, according to
McGarry.
Courses To Be Denied Credit
McGarry indicated, although
he did not know the exact figures,
that about three or four Army,
two Navy, and four Air Force
ROTC courses would be denied
credit under the new program. All
other courses that are currently
required for ROTC students are
taught in normal departments by
MIT professors.
This is in contrast to Stanford
ROTC where about 27 units are
now required for Army, 36 units
for Navy and 24 for Air Force.
Under the Army for Stanford
proposal that is being submitted
to a mail vote of the entire
faculty, the Army has agreed that
it would ask for an absolute
maximum of 12 units of credit
from the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
McGarry emphasized that MIT
departments have a rather long
history of working out courses
which satisfy military
requirements. The departments
retain full control over credit and
the courses are open to all
students and taken by those
outside ROTC.

He said that the ROTC
committee ga\e the different
services the MIT catalogue with
hundreds of courses in it and told
them that "you should be able to
find" something that will fulfill
requirements.
Regarding the penalty clauses
in individual ROTC contracts,
McGarry said that the armed
services only invoke the penalty
for "willful evasion" and that the
services have indicated that these
cases are not worth the bother.
Brooks' Statement
Vice Provost Howard Brooks
told the Stanford Academic
Council Monday that a staff paper
circulating high in the Army
command proposes that the
punitive clauses not be enforced
until 45 days after a student
graduates (provided he graduates
in the normal time.)
According to McGarry, "One
thing that has been helpful to us
in dealing with the armed forces is
a very large faculty vote last year
(six or seven to one) that said in
effect, 'We feel that if some of the
students want to earn a
commission through ROTC they
should be able to. We are also
concerned about credit, however.'
When explained the Army
ROTC nlan under consideration at
Stanford that would allow limited
credit, McGarry indicated that
that would probably satisfy MIT
if they had sucb a mechanism
because it guaranteed a check on
credit.

The New Moratorium (an
anti-ROTC organization) is
encouraging students to sign-up
for Army ROTC courses next
quarter, according to spokesman
Michael Sweeney.
"Students should learn first
hand what these courses are
about," said Sweeney. "Students
ca.n help us in our struggle to
eliminate ROTC."
A member of the New
Moratorium coordinating
committee, said, "With ten or
twenty radicals in each ROTC
class, there will be a substantially
different program." He would not
elaborate.
