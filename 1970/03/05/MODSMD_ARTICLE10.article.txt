# The 						Tong Mystique
## 'Chinks' And The CACA

(The following are excerpts from Frank Chin's
article "Chinamen, Chinks & The Caca" in
East/West - Ed.)
Chinatown being congenial to Chinese culture is
a myth whose purpose is to isolate Chinatown in
time and place from the rest of the world. We're so
congenial to Chinese culture that our suicide rate
is ten times the national norm and three times the
norm of the city. The myth, almost totally the
product of the tong (tong refers to the Six
Companies that own and run San Francisco's
Chinatown) handling of the media, served to
assure the white world that Chinese posed no
threat to their lives, much less their culture.
All we wanted to do, so the myth goes, is
preserve Confucian ethic. Wanting no involvement
with the rest of America, we were by our
admission innocuous, but innocous with a grin on
our faces and our hands out. The tong fathers
insured that America would look on us as their pet
minority, a race of monkeys dancing to America's
hurdy gurdy. They gave us coin. We gave them a
show of happy humiliation and self-contempt
that's lasted over a century. . .we're white, but not
too white. Not dangerously white.
Academic achievement, occupance of the
professions, the achievement of mediocrity in the
system and the excellent performance of notably
mediocre posts in the professions and judicial legal
system are part of our stereotype. In stating it
baldly as they do, the CACA (speaking for the Six
Companies, the tongs) is saying that
Chinese-Americans do not rock the boat, they are
not ambitious, they have not ever nor do they now
desire to occupy positions of greatness in any
field.
What's To Show for 160 Years?
If we're really all that smart why is it that in
160 years here, we haven't produced anything at
all of cultural value. Not one notable book, or
writer, or work of art . . .any kind of art. Nothing.
I'm talking about the impulse to enter the
culture which is nothing more than self-expression.
The Chinese have never come out and told the
world who they were in their own terms. From the
tongs' point of view, the lack of voice in the
culture is a virtue, an accomplishment, not a flaw
or cause for shame.
America looks upon our pursuit of academic

achievement as a sign of our desire to assimilate, as
an indication of love for America and as an old
Chinese tradition. The CACA suggests as much.
But look again. That "humble origin and
unremitting hard work" paragraph describes not so
much an achievement as a fight.
The Good Scholar
For years, for generations now, we seemed to
have attacked the stereotype of the good scholarly
Chinaman with suicidal hysterical affirmation.
Academic achievement was a kind of sabotage,
keeping our kids out of America and in a room
studying and learning how to achieve mediocrity,
how to become and remain inconspicuous in
America. Hanging around eradicating their own
presence was taken to be a charming, pleasant, and
a mysterious innate Oriental character trait. It was
a paranoid's survival tactic.
But we have to remember the tongs taught
Chinatown to run scared and that running scared
and displaying self-contempt not only became a
way of life, but a lucrative way of life for certain
Chinamen.
Here's the TONG'S statement thai the function
of the Chinese in tli is country, their sole
contribution to america their one achievement, is
that they are not black. . .because of course, we
have no status. We're the only race who thinks
that mediocrity is tops, that being inconspicuous is
an achievement, that self-expression is immoral.
The paragraph reads, "We are not Black, but we're
almost white. We're proud of not being Black.
We're telling you, white America, that there's
nothing to fear from us."
And there never was.
In light of our history and cultural
achievement, the tongs are saying here that we're
not aggressive, that on the contrary, we're passive,
that we have never had the urge to express
ourselves in any fashion of our own. . .not our
grief, our shame or pride, our suffering, our
anything. A race, a people without aggression,
even enough aggression to stand up and name
itself, is a people without self-respect or men.

admission innocuous, but innocous with a grin on
our faces and our hands out. The tong fathers
insured that America would look on us as their pet
minority, a race of monkeys dancing to America's
hurdy gurdy. They gave us coin. We gave them a
show of happy humiliation and self-contempt
that's lasted over a century. . .we're white, but not
too white. Not dangerously white.
Academic achievement, occupance of the
professions, the achievement of mediocrity in the
system and the excellent performance of notably
mediocre posts in the professions and judicial legal
system are part of our stereotype. In stating it
baldly as they do, the CACA (speaking for the Six
Companies, the tongs) is saying that
Chinese-Americans do not rock the boat, they are
not ambitious, they have not ever nor do they now
desire to occupy positions of greatness in any
field.
What's To Show for 160 Years?
If we're really all that smart why is it that in
160 years here, we haven't produced anything at
all of cultural value. Not one notable book, or
writer, or work of art . . .any kind of art. Nothing.
I'm talking about the impulse to enter the
culture which is nothing more than self-expression.
The Chinese have never come out and told the
world who they were in their own terms. From the
tongs' point of view, the lack of voice in the
culture is a virtue, an accomplishment, not a flaw
or cause for shame.
America looks upon our pursuit of academic

achievement as a sign of our desire to assimilate, as
an indication of love for America and as an old
Chinese tradition. The CACA suggests as much.
But look again. That "humble origin and
unremitting hard work" paragraph describes not so
much an achievement as a fight.
The Good Scholar
For years, for generations now, we seemed to
have attacked the stereotype of the good scholarly
Chinaman with suicidal hysterical affirmation.
Academic achievement was a kind of sabotage,
keeping our kids out of America and in a room
studying and learning how to achieve mediocrity,
how to become and remain inconspicuous in
America. Hanging around eradicating their own
presence was taken to be a charming, pleasant, and
a mysterious innate Oriental character trait. It was
a paranoid's survival tactic.
But we have to remember the tongs taught
Chinatown to run scared and that running scared
and displaying self-contempt not only became a
way of life, but a lucrative way of life for certain
Chinamen.
Here's the TONG'S statement thai the function
of the Chinese in tli is country, their sole
contribution to america their one achievement, is
that they are not black. . .because of course, we
have no status. We're the only race who thinks
that mediocrity is tops, that being inconspicuous is
an achievement, that self-expression is immoral.
The paragraph reads, "We are not Black, but we're
almost white. We're proud of not being Black.
We're telling you, white America, that there's
nothing to fear from us."
And there never was.
In light of our history and cultural
achievement, the tongs are saying here that we're
not aggressive, that on the contrary, we're passive,
that we have never had the urge to express
ourselves in any fashion of our own. . .not our
grief, our shame or pride, our suffering, our
anything. A race, a people without aggression,
even enough aggression to stand up and name
itself, is a people without self-respect or men.

Chinatown being congenial to Chinese culture is
a myth whose purpose is to isolate Chinatown in
time and place from the rest of the world. We're so
congenial to Chinese culture that our suicide rate
is ten times the national norm and three times the
norm of the city. The myth, almost totally the
product of the tong (tong refers to the Six
Companies that own and run San Francisco's
Chinatown) handling of the media, served to
assure the white world that Chinese posed no
threat to their lives, much less their culture.

preserve Confucian ethic. Wanting no involvement
