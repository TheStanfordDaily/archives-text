## The
						Salt Of The Earth: Where And Why? 
### Doug Graham 
This week's topic is Salt and
History. Salt is one of man's
oldest economic commodities.
Primitive tribes in all parts of the
world have long regarded it as one
of the most important trading
items - unless they lived near the
ocean of a natural salt lick.
The familiar "table" salt that is
essential to mammal: as life is
Sodium Chloride, the largest
source of which is the sea. Other
common salts found in the sea (in
free ionic form) are Calcium
Chloride (used by Easterners to
melt ice and snow on streets and
sidewalks), sodium and
Magnesium Sulfates and
Carbonates (responsible for
"hard" water deposits), and a host
of more exotic combinations.
These common minerials have
all been washed into the seas from
erosion of the continents over the
ages in a process continuing
today; the oceans serve as a
concentration basin for these
minerals being leached from the

rocks and soils of the 997 c of the
earth's surface that drains into
them.
"So?", you say. . ./'that
doesn't sound like a subject that
concerns me." Well, maybe it
doesn't. Maybe you don't like
eating oranges, grapes, peaches,
apricots, tomatoes, or beef
(fattened on alfalfa hay.) Maybe
you are not concerned about an
impending agricultural crisis of
rapidly widening proportions in
the U.S. Southwest. But if you
are, you should learn about salt,
because salt is ruining some of the
finest and most productive
food-producing land in the world.
Before Ecology
Back in the past century,
before ecology was formally
invented, at a time when the best
ecologists were the native Indians
along with a few far-seeing
farmers and individuals like John
Muir, the U.S. desert Southwest
lay largely fallow. Most of the
great agricultural valleys of today,

the Sacramento, the San Joaquin,
the Coachella and Imperial, the
Gila and Salt River, were not
farmed, because the low rainfall
conditions did not permit it.
Shortly before the turn of the
century, when rapidly developing
technology began to make
large-scale civil engineering
projects feasible, interest grew in
the idea of "making the desert
bloom" on a truly grand scale.
The first really large
dam-and-aquaduct project was the
Los Angeles Owens River
Aquaduct, completed just before
World War I. The project brought
water from the then largely
unpopulated Owens Valley to the
thirsty Los Angeles Basin, where
it contributed to the growth of
many millions of California's
finest naval orange trees, in the
days before it began contributing
to the growth of endless
subdivisions.
The great agricultural valleys of
the recent past, the San Gabriel,
the San Bernardino, the San
Fernando, and the L.A. Basin
itself, were irrigated partly by
water brought 450 miles from the
eastern slope of the Sierras.
Success - and More Development
This project was so successful
that it was aped on an even
grander scale in the 30's by the
Colorado River Project, in the
40's by the Salt River Project
(Phoenix, Arizona) and in the 50's
by the Feather River Project.
All these projects, in their early
years, were predominantly
agriculturally-oriented. They all
served to pour a never-ending
stream of naturally slightly salty
water (rather more than slightly,
in the case of the Colorado) onto
soils in a very dry climate. These
arid region soils are often very
salty to begin with, particularly in

the valleys, where winter runoff
from the mountains, low in salt
content, sinks into the ground and
then evaporates, leaving the
dissolved solids behind. This often
results in a layer of salts from six
inches to several feet beneath the
surface. This layer is "kept down"
by the leaching action of
occasional rains.
Enter the irrigator. . .and the
plot sickens. He pours water onto
this ground year upon year. And
so do his brothers and cousins in
all the other plots around him.
Collectively, they raise the water
table, until finally it's only a few
feet below the surface (as today,
in large parts of the Coachella and
Imperial Valleys.) Until it's in the
salt layer.
The salts dissolve and begin to
be carried with the water by
capillary action, to the surface,
where the water evaporates and
leaves a white mineral crust
behind. As you might be able to
guess, that's not very good for
tomatoes, or patatoes, or anything
else but saltweed.
Flushing a Solution
Solutions? Yes, there is one - a
technique known as "flushing"
which is just what it sounds like;
flooding the land with so much
water that the deposits are
redissolved and carried away in
the rivers or back down into the
salt layer. This is expensive and
time-consuming. But it is only
feasible when you have a virtually
inexhaustable source of fresh
water. Which is no longer true.
There are more subtle aspects
to the problem, also. Like Boron
Salts. Boron Salts, in very small
doses, are apparently not too
damaging to most plants.
However, they are devastating to
orange trees. And they are
relatively insoluble and therefore
difficult to flush away once they

are deposited in soils. And they
are found in a rather high natural
concentration in Colorado
Some years ago, in the
pre-Disneyland era of Southern
California, Orange County was
noted for its (of all things!)
orange groves. Perhaps, in a way,
it was fortunate for the orange
producers that they were hip-deep
in real estate promoters by the
late 1950's - because they were
already hip deep in Boron Salts
that were slowly strangling the
industry wherever Colorado River
Water was used for irrigation.
All this is a reminder of how
fragile our civilization really is,
how we all live on an ecological
knife-edge between prosperity
and poverty - or famine. What will
we do when the U.S., as a result
of growing population, becomes
truly dependent on these
irreplaceable lands to feed our
people? When will the time come
that industry and residences will
require the total water supply, so
there is no excess water available
to flush away salt build-ups?
Perhaps that day will never
come, but it doesn't take much
foresight to see that irrigated
fruits and vegetables will continue
to become more expensive as the
problem spreads and more
measures have to be taken to
counter it.
Our ecological "free ride" is
almost over, in so far a:
arid-climate irrigation is
concerned. It is but another lesson
in the growing list of ecological
lessons that we have learned the
hard way. We never really defeat
nature; when we attack it head
on, it has a way of falling back
into guerrilla warfare and hitting
us from behind. . .or beneath.
When will we ever learn?
