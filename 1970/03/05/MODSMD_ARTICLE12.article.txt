President Spiro Agnew and Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell may be on a
collision course without even
knowing it. As everyone who has
a television set knovtfs, the thrust
of Agnew's fund-raising speeches
for the Republican Party is that
you can't trust the press or the
television commentators because
they're biased and unreliable.
At the very moment that
Agnew is challenging the
credibility of the communications
media, Atty. Gen. Mitchell is
going ahead with his plans to
subpoena the notebooks and films
of the very reporters Agnew says
lack credibility.
The question that the Eastern
liberal establishment press is
asking is: "Does the attorney
general of the United States plan
to use reporters' notebooks and
film as evidence, when the Vice

President of the United States
says they are all a pack of lies?"
It's going to be tough for a jury
to decide a case when two leaders
of the country are on opposite
sides of the case.
"Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, the government submits in
evidence the notebooks of Hiram
Spindletroff who interviewed Raff
Lubin, In one of these notebooks
Lubin told Spindletroff, and I
quote, 'If I had a birthday candle,
I'd set fire to the Washington
Monument."
"The defense objects, your
honor. Vice President Agnew has
said repeatedly you can't believe a
word Hiram Spindletroff says. So.
how can the jury believe anything'
written in his notebooks?"
"Your honor, the government
has been assured that everything
Spindletroff has written in his
notebook is true."
"Your honor, the attorney
general is calling the Vice
President of the United States a
liar and the defense will not stand
for it."
"The attorney general is not
calling the Vice President a liar.
The attorney general has great
respect for the Vice President."
"Then how can the attorney
general say that Spindletroff has
written the truth about Lubin
when the Vice President says that
Spindletroff can't write the truth
about anything?"
"Objection sustained. The
prosecution will contunue."
"Your honor, we will now
show a film made by Mike Solace,
the CBS television commentator,
at the tihie he interviewed Raff
Lubin about Lubin's plans to
organize a demonstration in

Florida to stop the spring training
of baseball."
"Objection, your honor. The
defense would like to say that the
Vice President has pointed out
that of all the commentators on
the airwaves, Mike Solace has
raised his eyebrows the most. He
cannot be trusted to give a fair
accounting of the news."
"Your honor, the government
strongly objects to the objection.
Mike Solace is considered one of
the most important news
commentators in television. This
film we have subpoenaed will
show that Lubin. . "
"Objection. The attorney
general is doubting the word of
the Vice President of the United
States again. The defense is
shocked and horrified."
"Mr. Attorney General, are
you or are you not casting
aspersions on the Vice President
of the United States?"
"I am not, your honor. But I
can't proceed with my case unless
I am permitted to use the
notebooks and film I had to
subpoena, to prove that Raff
Lubin intended to burn down the
Washington Monument and stop
spring training of baseball at the
s- *ne time."
"Mr. Attorney General, as
judge I cannot accept the evidence
unless I am assured by the Vice
President of the United States
that Hiram Spindletroff and Mike
Solace tell the truth."
"But how can I get the Vice
President to say that?"
"That's your problem, Mr.
Attorney General. But if you call
the Vice President a liar once
more, I'm going to have to hold
you in contempt."

President Spiro Agnew and Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell may be on a
collision course without even
knowing it. As everyone who has
a television set knovtfs, the thrust
of Agnew's fund-raising speeches
for the Republican Party is that
you can't trust the press or the
television commentators because
they're biased and unreliable.
At the very moment that
Agnew is challenging the
credibility of the communications
media, Atty. Gen. Mitchell is
going ahead with his plans to
subpoena the notebooks and films
of the very reporters Agnew says
lack credibility.
The question that the Eastern
liberal establishment press is
asking is: "Does the attorney
general of the United States plan
to use reporters' notebooks and
film as evidence, when the Vice

President of the United States
says they are all a pack of lies?"
It's going to be tough for a jury
to decide a case when two leaders
of the country are on opposite
sides of the case.
"Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, the government submits in
evidence the notebooks of Hiram
Spindletroff who interviewed Raff
Lubin, In one of these notebooks
Lubin told Spindletroff, and I
quote, 'If I had a birthday candle,
I'd set fire to the Washington
Monument."
"The defense objects, your
honor. Vice President Agnew has
said repeatedly you can't believe a
word Hiram Spindletroff says. So.
how can the jury believe anything'
written in his notebooks?"
"Your honor, the government
has been assured that everything
Spindletroff has written in his
notebook is true."
"Your honor, the attorney
general is calling the Vice
President of the United States a
liar and the defense will not stand
for it."
"The attorney general is not
calling the Vice President a liar.
The attorney general has great
respect for the Vice President."
"Then how can the attorney
general say that Spindletroff has
written the truth about Lubin
when the Vice President says that
Spindletroff can't write the truth
about anything?"
"Objection sustained. The
prosecution will contunue."
"Your honor, we will now
show a film made by Mike Solace,
the CBS television commentator,
at the tihie he interviewed Raff
Lubin about Lubin's plans to
organize a demonstration in

Florida to stop the spring training
of baseball."
"Objection, your honor. The
defense would like to say that the
Vice President has pointed out
that of all the commentators on
the airwaves, Mike Solace has
raised his eyebrows the most. He
cannot be trusted to give a fair
accounting of the news."
"Your honor, the government
strongly objects to the objection.
Mike Solace is considered one of
the most important news
commentators in television. This
film we have subpoenaed will
show that Lubin. . "
"Objection. The attorney
general is doubting the word of
the Vice President of the United
States again. The defense is
shocked and horrified."
"Mr. Attorney General, are
you or are you not casting
aspersions on the Vice President
of the United States?"
"I am not, your honor. But I
can't proceed with my case unless
I am permitted to use the
notebooks and film I had to
subpoena, to prove that Raff
Lubin intended to burn down the
Washington Monument and stop
spring training of baseball at the
s- *ne time."
"Mr. Attorney General, as
judge I cannot accept the evidence
unless I am assured by the Vice
President of the United States
that Hiram Spindletroff and Mike
Solace tell the truth."
"But how can I get the Vice
President to say that?"
"That's your problem, Mr.
