# Hornsby's Highlights
## Up Against The Wall, Please 
### BISON HORNSBY 
Look out. Here they come
again, the MCs—those mean, far
out, super-radicalized
politico-musicians who thrilled us
exactly one album ago by kicking
out all the jams they could lay
their hands on. Guerrillas as well
as rock stars, they were reported
to be members of the White
Panther Party, and they often
would stroll on stage with a guitar
over one shoulder and a machine
gun over the other. And their
stage act—well, it was all done to
help the brothers and sisters get it
together, even, presumably, the
infamous Seattle on-stage
defecation.
Just look at the cover of their

new album. There are the MCS
exactly as we remember
them—sweaty and dirty and
maybe a little bit wasted. But flip
the album over the look at their
pictures on the back. My God, the
5 are clean, their faces are shaven,
their hair is combed and
bouffanted, and even more
shocking, they all look like angelic
little boys. The title of the album
is also a surprise: Back in the USA.
New Cook?
Can it be? Have the boys come
back; is the end of their alienation
signaled by the album title and
the new look? The answer lies on
the record itself, and hot damn,
it's good old Rock 'n' Roll. The
title song by Chuck Berry and

Little Rioard's "Tutti-Frutti" are
dead giveaways.
The MO seem to have decided
that it's a vhole lot better to be
rock stars aid sell records than it
is to be poitical and get busted
like John Snclair. They've even
changed re»ord labels, from
Elektra to Atmtic, perhaps in an
attempt to nuke a fresh start and
wipe out the pjst.
Ticks
They try tc trick you into
thinking that th'ir heads are still
in the same place they were
before, with Uke "Teenage
Lust," "Call Me Animal," and

"Shakin' Street." But it's pretty
clear that you're listening to a
rock band and not a political
party.
The only really political song
on the album is "The American
Ruse," which deals with
disillusioned kids, the draft, and
the police. Despite its theme, the
lyrics remind me more of
"Summertime Blues" than of the
Stones' "Street Fightin' Man":
"I'm gettin' sick and tired of
payin' these dues,/ And I'm
finally gettin' hip to the American
ruse." Hardly revolutionary, and
not even very esoteric.

The album is basically straight
forward rock: big chords, loud
bass, and clean drumming. And
it's not bad, certainly a lot tighter
and more coherent than their first
album. There is no outstanding
musicianship, but the sound is
solid and, except for one tiresome
slow cut, the entire album drives.
The vocals are in the mainstream
of rock chanting, and guitarist
Fred "Sonic" Smith gets off a
pretty good Mick Jagger imitation
in "Shakin' Street." The lyrics for
the most part are admirably
mindless.
A couple of songs stand out in
particular. "Tonight" is a nice
mixture of a simple rock verse, a
full instrumental sound, and a
bridge with an unexpected and
effective chord pattern. The guitar
solo is introduced by a
double-tracked voice saying, "OK,
kids, it's rockin' time,"
reminiscent of Gene Vincent's
immortal "Let's rock" in the
middle of "Be-Bob-A-Lula." "The
Human Being Lawnmower" opens
like a Who song, goes into a guitar
solo with touches of Spirit and
Led Zeppelin, and then comes to
a quick, hard ending.
Close lo Competent
The MCS are not going to
amaze you with their
inventiveness, or surprise you with
any subtle dynamics, but they do
play reasonably competent rock.
Best of all, they don't try to do
anything they can't do. And it
seems that they may be capable of
even better things in the near
future, if they can continue to
improve their original material.
Their early admirers may not
appreciate their seeming political
sellout, but the MCS appear to be
paying more attention to their
music.
