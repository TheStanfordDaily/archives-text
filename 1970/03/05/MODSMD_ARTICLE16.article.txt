# Black Comedy
## 'Oh Dad' Delights And Chills 
### KIT CAMERON 
The "Theater at Rudolfo's" is as close to
perfect as an intimate theater can get, with
comfortable chairs, a smiling cocktail waittress,
and ashtrays provided. Even if one is forced to sit
through a mediocre play he can do so at least in
somnabulistic luxury.
But "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in
the Closet and I'm Feeling so Sad" is far from
mediocre. With one or two exceptions, it is
brilliant.
This weird black comedy concerns a man-eating
widow, Mme. Rosepettle (Edna Macafee), who
keeps her husband's corpse in her closet, and her
stammering son, Jonathan feeds mama's venus fly
traps, while Mme. Rosepettle wanders the beach
kicking sand on lovers and takes time to pursue
Commodore Roseabove (Leonard Simon), owner
of the longest yacht in the Carribbean.
Mama Frigid
Edna Macafee plays a chilling mama, at first
charmingly eccentric until she reveals herself as a
blood-sucking blackwidow. Gary Lindsey handles
the part of Jonathan with finesse, making him as
ethereally attractive as he is pathetic.
Into Jonathan's life comes a babysitter named
Rosalie (Libby Charlton), who offers him love and
escape. That she will not succeed is obvious to the
audience, but no one expects the brutal ending of
the play.
Mme. Rosepettle is meanwhile being ardently

courted by Commodore Roseabove. In a ten
minute monologue on her marriage addressed to
the commodore, she reveals what an evil creature
she is. The two carry off magaificently what is
visually the most static scene in an otherwise very
bouncy play. To the question, "What happened to
your husband?" Mme. Rosepettle replies sweetly,
"I killed him, of course. Champagne?"
Director Judith Burgess has extracted every
funny moment from the script. The play spits
comic horror. Only a couple of weak spots prevent
it from being a completely polished show. The bell
boys (Alan Olds and Charles Bennett) do not make
the most of their very funny bit at the beginning.
The technical aspects are at times a bit shaky, but
this is difficult to prevent on a supper club stage
with no wings.
There is a chilling element beneath the brittle
surface. The use of "rose" in names becomes a
symbol of life. Mme. Rosepettle at one point
speaks of her husband as "my life." Jonathan
follows his mother's lead by squashing (literally)
his one chance to live outside the funeral parlor
she has created. The treatment of death in such a
flippant manner usually borders on bad taste.
Arthur makes a strong statement for life and
creates a repugnant image of death even as he
mocks it.
"Oh Dad" continues on weekends through
March 28, at Rudolfo's 4020 El Camino, 8:30
Friday and Saturday evenings. For the price of a
movie, you can see an excellent live show.

mediocre. With one or two exceptions, it is
brilliant.
This weird black comedy concerns a man-eating
widow, Mme. Rosepettle (Edna Macafee), who
keeps her husband's corpse in her closet, and her
stammering son, Jonathan feeds mama's venus fly
traps, while Mme. Rosepettle wanders the beach
kicking sand on lovers and takes time to pursue
Commodore Roseabove (Leonard Simon), owner
of the longest yacht in the Carribbean.
Mama Frigid
Edna Macafee plays a chilling mama, at first
charmingly eccentric until she reveals herself as a
blood-sucking blackwidow. Gary Lindsey handles
the part of Jonathan with finesse, making him as
ethereally attractive as he is pathetic.
Into Jonathan's life comes a babysitter named
Rosalie (Libby Charlton), who offers him love and
escape. That she will not succeed is obvious to the
audience, but no one expects the brutal ending of
the play.
Mme. Rosepettle is meanwhile being ardently

courted by Commodore Roseabove. In a ten
minute monologue on her marriage addressed to
the commodore, she reveals what an evil creature
she is. The two carry off magaificently what is
visually the most static scene in an otherwise very
bouncy play. To the question, "What happened to
your husband?" Mme. Rosepettle replies sweetly,
"I killed him, of course. Champagne?"
Director Judith Burgess has extracted every
funny moment from the script. The play spits
comic horror. Only a couple of weak spots prevent
it from being a completely polished show. The bell
boys (Alan Olds and Charles Bennett) do not make
the most of their very funny bit at the beginning.
The technical aspects are at times a bit shaky, but
this is difficult to prevent on a supper club stage
with no wings.
There is a chilling element beneath the brittle
surface. The use of "rose" in names becomes a
symbol of life. Mme. Rosepettle at one point
speaks of her husband as "my life." Jonathan
follows his mother's lead by squashing (literally)
his one chance to live outside the funeral parlor
she has created. The treatment of death in such a
flippant manner usually borders on bad taste.
Arthur makes a strong statement for life and
creates a repugnant image of death even as he
mocks it.
"Oh Dad" continues on weekends through
March 28, at Rudolfo's 4020 El Camino, 8:30
Friday and Saturday evenings. For the price of a
movie, you can see an excellent live show.
The "Theater at Rudolfo's" is as close to
perfect as an intimate theater can get, with
comfortable chairs, a smiling cocktail waittress,
and ashtrays provided. Even if one is forced to sit
through a mediocre play he can do so at least in
somnabulistic luxury.
But "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in
the Closet and I'm Feeling so Sad" is far from
mediocre. With one or two exceptions, it is
brilliant.
