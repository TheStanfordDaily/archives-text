# 'Soldier' Blitzes War
## 
### PAT THOMAS 
Many an audience has snored
blissfully through a play about a
cause which during their waking
hours they regard as perfectly
valid. No one will sleep through
SRT's productioi of The
Unknown Soldier and His Wife,
which opened last night at the
Little Theater. In fact, even
leisurely blinking is discouraged
by Peter Ustinov's machine-gun
blast of wit.
Ustinov tells us what we

already know: war is bad but very
human, and all wars are alike.
They are perpetuated by men who
accept their roles without protest
and act without understanding. In
the midst of this madness is the
man who wants to understand
before he acts. This ready-made
victim is the Unknown Soldier
(Dennis Kerwin.)
Flash Backs
Time is turned topsy-turvy
during preparations for a
television show dedicating the

Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In
the series of flashbacks which
follows the leaders plot with
impunity while the Unknown
Soldier dies.
He dies on the Roman field of
battle, in the Crusades, during an
18th Century populist revolution,
and during World War I. Each
time he leaves behind his pregnant
wife (Gail Hoffman), only to be
reunited with her at the outbreak
of the next war.
Hernandez Weak
The cast is consistently good,
with the possible exception of
Marcel Hernandez as the Rebel.
For most of the play he trades on
a snide expression and little else.
Only as the Napoleon figure does
he command attention, and in
that scene he is convincingly
despicable.
Most of the major players
make the switch from period to
period with apparent ease. Robin
Lake is the worldly cleric in each
scene, and is best as the lecherous
18th Century churchman who
could be straight out of Moliere.
He has a worthy antagonist in
Bridget Ross, the superficially
empty-headed wife of the prince
(Jim Kason.) Miss Ross proves
that she is one of the best
comediennes around, playing
everything from an arabian
temptress to a puritan sister.
The Unknown Soldier and His
Wife is a satire which should be
performed with an excess of
imagination. Director Joseph
Brockett took advantage of this
opportunity and used gimmicks
which usually work. The gauze
boxes where the arabs kill the
crusaders in slow motion are
tremendously effective.
Overboard
Slow motion sword fighting is
all right, but slow motion
strangulation by poison gas comes
on like armored Elvira Madigan.
Instead of golden lovers in a
golden field we have green soldiers
dying laboriously in great clouds
of bilious green smoke. Brockett
went overboard on a basically
good device.
K. Clarke Crandell's sets look
too much like plexiglass Mondrian
at first glance, but you learn to
like them because they function
so well. Shawn Murphy's sound
effects, which are absolutely
essential to the play, are excellent.
The decision to use Donovan's
rendition of "The Universal
Soldier" to open and close and
play deserves mention.
Overplayed as that song once was,
it has not lost any of its original
potency.
The play will be presented at 8
p.m. tonight through Saturday
and March 10-14 at theLittle
Theater. Tickets are scarce, but do
try to go. This might well be the
best production of the year.
