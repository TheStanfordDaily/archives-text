# Rejection Control The Key
## Transplants Live On 
### 
Long-term evaluation has
shown that the transplanted
human heart functions well and
that rejection of the graft can be
detected and controlled in most
cases, a Stanford University
cardiologist said Saturday.
Dr. David Clark, a member of
the heart transplant team at
Stanford University Medical
Center, explained the thorough
follow-up of patients after
discharge from the hospital. He
spoke Saturday at the American
College of Cardiology meeting in
New Orleans.
"Twenty patients have received
transplanted hearts at Stanford
with eight presently surviving,"
according to Dr. Clark. "Of the
eight surviving patients, seven
have been discharged from the
hospital and lead near-normal
lives."
"Three of the survivors were
transplanted over a year ago and
our longest survivor is now a year
and a half post-transplant," he
said. "In addition, seven have
survived six months and 11
patients lived at least three
months with their new hearts."
"Our experience has shown
that chronic rejection is the
important factor in late
postoperative survival and in
determining the functional
capacity of the heart," Clark said.
Chronic rejection, he explained,
appears to take place slowly over
a long period ot time. It results in
an accumulation of tissue deposits
on the walls of arteries in the
heart. If severe, this accumulation
can eventually cut off the blood
supply to areas of the heart
including the conduction system
and natural pacemaker of the
heart.
Follow-Up
"Our follow-up of these

patients has been directed toward
detection of signs of chronic
rejection and toward the diagnosis
and treatment of late acute
rejection which directly damages
the heart muscle," he said.
"After discharge from the
hospital, we examine the patients
twice weekly for at least six
months and at weekly intervals
thereafter," Clark explained.
"Clinical examinations consist of
appropriate history and physical
examinations. Electrocardiograms
(EKO) are taken also during
periods of both rest and exercise
on a stationary bicycle."
"Using this close and
continuous monitoring, we have
been able to diagnose and treat
seven episodes of acute rejection
in the late post-operative period,"
the cardiologist said. 'The
treatment provecj successful in six
of the episodes although one was
unresponsive to therapy and was
responsible for the death of the
patient."
To aid in the detection of
chronic rejection, the Stanford
physicians are using a small
portable tape recorder which
supplies them with a continuous,
10-hour electrocardiogram
recorded during periods of rest
and activity. Each patient wears
the recorder two days a month.
"With the date provided by the
EKG recording over a substantial
period of our ability to
study the overall function of the
transplanted heart and to detect
heart arrhythmia, or an irregular
heart beat, is greatly increased,"
Clark said. "The presence of
arrhythmias may be an indicator
of chronic rejection."
One patient whose EKG did
indicate an irregular beat had a
battery-operated pacemaker
implanted to stabilize his heart

rate and has continued to lead a
normal, vigorous life.
Exercise
"A regular schedule of physical
exercise may play an important
role in determining the functional
response of the transplanted heart
to stress," Clark said.
He cited the case of one
patient who regularly exercised
for 10 months after his heart
transplant. Then a job change
caused him to lead a more
sedentary life and to neglect his
exercise program.
"Our testing of the physical
stamina of this patient during the
time when he was not exercising
regularly found him to have
difficulty breathing and excessive
perspiration. The same test, given
when the patient was exercising
regularly, found that the physical
exertion was easily tolerated."
Clark pointed out.

Long-term evaluation has
shown that the transplanted
human heart functions well and
that rejection of the graft can be
detected and controlled in most
cases, a Stanford University
cardiologist said Saturday.
Dr. David Clark, a member of
the heart transplant team at
Stanford University Medical
Center, explained the thorough
follow-up of patients after
discharge from the hospital. He
spoke Saturday at the American
College of Cardiology meeting in
New Orleans.
"Twenty patients have received
transplanted hearts at Stanford
with eight presently surviving,"
according to Dr. Clark. "Of the
eight surviving patients, seven
have been discharged from the
hospital and lead near-normal
lives."
"Three of the survivors were
transplanted over a year ago and
our longest survivor is now a year
and a half post-transplant," he
said. "In addition, seven have
survived six months and 11
patients lived at least three
months with their new hearts."
"Our experience has shown
that chronic rejection is the
important factor in late
postoperative survival and in
determining the functional
capacity of the heart," Clark said.
Chronic rejection, he explained,
appears to take place slowly over
a long period ot time. It results in
an accumulation of tissue deposits
on the walls of arteries in the
heart. If severe, this accumulation
can eventually cut off the blood
supply to areas of the heart
including the conduction system
and natural pacemaker of the
heart.
Follow-Up
"Our follow-up of these

patients has been directed toward
detection of signs of chronic
rejection and toward the diagnosis
and treatment of late acute
rejection which directly damages
the heart muscle," he said.
"After discharge from the
hospital, we examine the patients
twice weekly for at least six
months and at weekly intervals
thereafter," Clark explained.
"Clinical examinations consist of
appropriate history and physical
examinations. Electrocardiograms
(EKO) are taken also during
periods of both rest and exercise
on a stationary bicycle."
"Using this close and
continuous monitoring, we have
been able to diagnose and treat
seven episodes of acute rejection
in the late post-operative period,"
the cardiologist said. 'The
treatment provecj successful in six
of the episodes although one was
unresponsive to therapy and was
responsible for the death of the
patient."
To aid in the detection of
chronic rejection, the Stanford
physicians are using a small
portable tape recorder which
supplies them with a continuous,
10-hour electrocardiogram
recorded during periods of rest
and activity. Each patient wears
the recorder two days a month.
"With the date provided by the
EKG recording over a substantial
period of our ability to
study the overall function of the
transplanted heart and to detect
heart arrhythmia, or an irregular
heart beat, is greatly increased,"
Clark said. "The presence of
arrhythmias may be an indicator
of chronic rejection."
One patient whose EKG did
indicate an irregular beat had a
battery-operated pacemaker
implanted to stabilize his heart

rate and has continued to lead a
normal, vigorous life.
Exercise
"A regular schedule of physical
exercise may play an important
role in determining the functional
response of the transplanted heart
to stress," Clark said.
He cited the case of one
patient who regularly exercised
for 10 months after his heart
transplant. Then a job change
caused him to lead a more
sedentary life and to neglect his
exercise program.
"Our testing of the physical
stamina of this patient during the
time when he was not exercising
regularly found him to have
difficulty breathing and excessive
perspiration. The same test, given
when the patient was exercising
regularly, found that the physical
exertion was easily tolerated."
Clark pointed out.
