# Grass Roots Book Examines Midpeninsula Land Policies
## 
### JOHN SLOAN 
In its continuing criticism of
the Stanford land policies Grass
Roots has published a booklet,
The Promised Land, dealing with
a wide range of topics from the
housing crisis to Bay Area
ecology.
In this comprehensive booklet,
the Grass Roots organization
covers Mid-Peninsula land
development, past, present and
future with special emphasis on
Stanford's role.
In line with the radical policies
of its members, the booklet does
not see our present problems of
ecological disaster, lack of low
cost housing or air and water
pollution as isolated incidents.
Rather, they feel that these
dilemmas have arisen because of
the policy of making the fast buck
in big business and not bothering
about the consequences.
The Promised Land opens with
a detailed history of the
Mid-Peninsula from the times of
the Costanoan Indians and work
through the various periods of
Spanish, Mexican and American
domination. Much detail is spent
on Leland Stanford, the building
of the railway and the growth of
Stanford University and the
surrounding communities.
Farming To \Var Industry
World War II and the post-war
period is depicted as an important
break with the past when the
economy of the mid-Peninsula
region changed from a farming to
industrial base especially war
related research and development.
This change has influenced land
policies to the present. Stanford's
role in this development is
emphasiised, noting its help to
organizations such as
Hewlett-Packard and the
Industrial g to industrial base
formation of the Stanford
Industrial Park and the Stanford

Research Institute.
From history Grass Roots
moves into' jobs and population.'
With the increase of industry in
the area there came the influx of
workers to staff the businesses.
However, according to the
booklet, the growth in reasonable
cost housing has not kept pace
with the number of jobs created
and the majority of workers,
whose salaries are below $10,000,
are now forced to seek housing
farther and farther from their
place of work. It also deals with
job discrimination against
minorities who are often unskilled
and the first to lost their jobs
because of economy fluctuations.
Wealthy Discrimination
Next comes 'housing and
services' where Grass Roots
contends that the housing crisis in
the Palo Alto-Stanford area is no
accident. They feel that the
wealthy have always discriminated
against the poor since the
beginning of the development
here and that they arc still doing
it today. Stanford supposedly

plays a key role in allowing only
high cost housing to be
constructed.
A chapter on 'ecology' is
included a.id it covers a wide
range of areas, finding a link
between the ecological rape in
Vietnam and the problems here
that we are only beginning to
recognize. They feel that it is
these same people who are
responsible for the pollution of
the air and the Bay and Vietnam.
The cost of cleaning up should
not be passed on to either
government or consumer - but
should come out of the profits of
the capitalistic system.
Stanford Land Use' and Palo
Alto Development' comprise the
next sections and concern
themselves mainly with present
and future plans. Here Grass
Roots raises its objections to
projects in the news today such as
Coyote Hill, Dillingham and
future development in downtown
Palo Alto.
'Don't Mourn, Organize!' sums
up the Grass Roots argument.

future with special emphasis on
Stanford's role.
In line with the radical policies
of its members, the booklet does
not see our present problems of
ecological disaster, lack of low
cost housing or air and water
pollution as isolated incidents.
Rather, they feel that these
dilemmas have arisen because of
the policy of making the fast buck
in big business and not bothering
about the consequences.
The Promised Land opens with
a detailed history of the
Mid-Peninsula from the times of
the Costanoan Indians and work
through the various periods of
Spanish, Mexican and American
domination. Much detail is spent
on Leland Stanford, the building
of the railway and the growth of
Stanford University and the
surrounding communities.
Farming To \Var Industry
World War II and the post-war
period is depicted as an important
break with the past when the
economy of the mid-Peninsula
region changed from a farming to
industrial base especially war
related research and development.
This change has influenced land
policies to the present. Stanford's
role in this development is
emphasiised, noting its help to
organizations such as
Hewlett-Packard and the
Industrial g to industrial base
formation of the Stanford
Industrial Park and the Stanford

Research Institute.
From history Grass Roots
moves into' jobs and population.'
With the increase of industry in
the area there came the influx of
workers to staff the businesses.
However, according to the
booklet, the growth in reasonable
cost housing has not kept pace
with the number of jobs created
and the majority of workers,
whose salaries are below $10,000,
are now forced to seek housing
farther and farther from their
place of work. It also deals with
job discrimination against
minorities who are often unskilled
and the first to lost their jobs
because of economy fluctuations.
Wealthy Discrimination
Next comes 'housing and
services' where Grass Roots
contends that the housing crisis in
the Palo Alto-Stanford area is no
accident. They feel that the
wealthy have always discriminated
against the poor since the
beginning of the development
here and that they arc still doing
it today. Stanford supposedly

plays a key role in allowing only
high cost housing to be
constructed.
A chapter on 'ecology' is
included a.id it covers a wide
range of areas, finding a link
between the ecological rape in
Vietnam and the problems here
that we are only beginning to
recognize. They feel that it is
these same people who are
responsible for the pollution of
the air and the Bay and Vietnam.
The cost of cleaning up should
not be passed on to either
government or consumer - but
should come out of the profits of
the capitalistic system.
Stanford Land Use' and Palo
Alto Development' comprise the
next sections and concern
themselves mainly with present
and future plans. Here Grass
Roots raises its objections to
projects in the news today such as
Coyote Hill, Dillingham and
future development in downtown
Palo Alto.
'Don't Mourn, Organize!' sums
up the Grass Roots argument.


CIVILIZATION STRIKES AGAIN—This piece ol' pipeline is
part of the continuing development of the Midpcninsula, a
.subject probed in Grass Roots Booklet, released this week.
In its continuing criticism of
the Stanford land policies Grass
Roots has published a booklet,
The Promised Land, dealing with
a wide range of topics from the
housing crisis to Bay Area
ecology.
