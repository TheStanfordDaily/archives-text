# Two Students Killed In Palo Alto Crash
## 
### 
One Stanford student and a
former student became Palo
Alto's first traffic fatalities of the
year yesterday when their
speeding Porsche went out of
control and collided with a tree.
The victims, both 21 years of
age, were identified as Grahm
Douglas Chambers, of York,
Maine, and Mark Emerson
Bartlett, from Greenwich, Conn.
Bartlett was currently
registered as a student at
Stanford, and Chambers appeared
in University records as a former
student.
The accident occurred just east
of the intersection of Chaucer St.
and University Avenue in Palo
Alto.
Both Chambers and Bartlett
were killed instantly when their
eastbound car apparently went
out of control at the intersection.
It skidded about 150 feet, jumped

the curb and slid another 50 feet
before hitting a gree on the left
side of the street. Skid marks at
the scene indicate that the car was
travelling at about 60 mph when
it went out of control. The speed
limit in the area is 25.
