# Blood Drive 'Successful'
## 
### 
Cardinals Board's February 24
blood drive proved to be the most
successful project of its type ever
held at Stanford.
It was also one of the largest
held on the Peninsula, both in
numbers of people who showed
up and in those who actually
donated.
Between 9 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.,
when the Peninsula Blood Bank's
Mobile Unit was on campus, 127
donors gave blood, and 53 were
rejected due to illness and other
causes.
The blood which was collected
will be donated to the needy,
since blood for emergency
transfusions costs about $37 a
pint, of which $12 cover handling
costs.
With this fund, it will be
possible for students and needy
patients to obtain blood without
paying for the blood they use.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew has an
I.Q. of 135, claims a Republican
National Committee's Newsletter.
According to The World Book
Encyclopedia, a genius is a person
with I.Q. 140 or greater. Good
luck on your finals!
