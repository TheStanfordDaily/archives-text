# Swim Final: Dave & John & Fred
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
(Editor's Note: The Final
Installment, in which we examine
John & Dave & Fred & Alice
(consider the possibilities),
bandage our fingers, collect our
$10 check, and go home.)
Dave Shilling is happy with all
his clothes on. He was the only
person fully dressed from 12 to 2
at Encina Pool (where he works as

a lifeguard), although when I
mentioned the 70-degree heat, he
did unbutton his green overcoat.
Shilling does not talk a lot.
One must read the prospectus to
find out that he was runner-up in
last year's NCAA 200-yd.
breaststroke, or examine the
Swimming World weekly ratings
sheet to find out if he is No. 2 or
No. 3 in the breaststroke event.
Still, the 2000 spectators at the
Feb. 7 Yale meet got a pretty
good idea just what caliber
swimmer Shilling is. The
Campbell, Calif., sophomore was
Stanford's only double winner,
defeating teammate John Ferris in
the individual medley, and coming
back later to defeat Yale
Olympian Phil Long in a
breaststroke race that had the
crowd and the team on its feet.
Shilling, who had been tagged
at the outset as a key to the

meet's outcome, said, "That was
the longest meet of the year—it
really dragged out for the whole
team."
Shilling has the dubious luck of
being the nation's fastest
breaststroker, bar one—teammate
Brian Job. Of Job, Shilling says
"I'd rather have him here than
anywhere else; we're good for
each other. We make each other
work and we know how each
other swims the 200.
Psychologically it's an advantage
for both of us." Looking forward
to the NCAA's later this month,
he added "It's hard to think in
terms of a time-goal; I think I can
get down to a 2:06."
I asked Dave how he liked his
lifeguarding job. He looked out
the window of the pool office,
smiled, and re-buttoned his
overcoat.
John Ferris is alive and well
and hiding out in Portola Valley.
May I here publicly retract the
statement I made during the Yale
meet about John being a
basket-weaving major for all those
who are looking for an alternative
to poli sci. Ferris is, in fact, a
double major in English and
communications, which is about
the mass media, which has made
him a sort of legend.
Actually, Ferris makes a much
better person than a legend,
although his accomplishments in
12 years of swimming certainly
qualify him for myth status at the
least.
In the 1968 Olympics, he won
bronze medals in both the
individual medley and the 200
meter butterfly. In the 1969
NCAA Championships at Indiana,
he won the 200-yd butterfly in a
record-breaking time of 1:49.6.
At the Pac-8 Championships now
being held in Pullman,

Washington, Ferris will be
defending his championship titles
in the 200 fly, the 100 fly (:50.9)
and the 200 individual medley
(1:58.2). In the Washington State
meet, he got stung by a bee.
The bee, which landed on
Ferris' eye during the backstroke
leg of the individual medley, was
preceeded by a broken nose, and
followed by attacks of bronchitis

and the flu the week before the
Yale meet. Which put somewhat
of a damper on his performances
for much of the rest of the dual
season.
Still, Ferris will be favored to
repeat his NCAA title this month,
and possibly win the individual
medley as well—he currently ranks
second in the nation in the
200-yd. event with 1:57.4.
And what does Ferris think of
all the fanfare? "Swimming
dominates my life too much;
there's so many other things I
want to do. I want to write—all I
need is pen and paper; I'm
interested in broadcasting—all I
want is camera and film."
It seems fitting to end with
Fred Haywood, although I'm not
sure just why. Even though he is
the team captain, he seems to get
lost in the shuffle of swimming
copy, probably because he always
wins. It started last year at the
Pac-B's, when he won both the
100 and 200 backstroke races (in
times of :54.0 and 1:57.2
respectively), and continued
through the NCAA's, where he
upset Charlie Hickox in the 100
back with a :52.3 clocking.

He hasn't let up this year. He is
undefeated in dual meet
competition, and ranks sixth in
the nation in the 200 back. All
this winning really makes rather
dull copy, although Haywood
himself is one of the team's most
colorful personalities. He puts the
crowd and the team at ease with
his false starts, which is a rare
happening in backstroke. He puts
himself at ease when discussing
transcendental meditation, a
subject in which he is deeply
interested.
When Haywood is not
swimming, he is likely to be
spotted at the side of the pool
swinging his towel and
encouraging long-distance
teammates Brent Berk or Tim
Broderick. At the UCLA meet, he
drew laughter from the crowd
when, during the medley relay,
the Stanford butterflier had still
not shown up; Haywood sat on
the adjacent starting block, rolled

his eyes, and broke the nervous
silence with the plaintive shout,
"Fer-r-ris!"
As for his goal at this month's
NCAA's, the Kahalui, Hawaii,
junior says "I'd like to do as well
as I did last year, although there
are going to be a lot more people
closer to me—a lot of younger
people."
That's it. There is no Alice.
