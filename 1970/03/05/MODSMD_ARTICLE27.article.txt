# Baseballers Rained Out; Savor Tuesday's Win
## 
### 
Yesterday's scheduled baseball
game between Stanford and Santa
Clara was called off after an
inspection of Buck Shaw Stadium
in Santa Clara revealed a flooded
outfield complete with snakes,
fish and a large ark.
The game had first been rained
out on Feb. 13, and now it might
never be played. Awwww . . .
In any case, the day off gave
the Indians a chance to savor
Tuesday's 5-2 win over University
of the Pacific here. The game had
two highlights: Steve Dunning
raised his record to 5-0 and hit a
three run homer, and the contest
was called after eight innings by
plate umpire Bob Albrecht when
two UOP phenoms—the coach and
the third baseman—were thrown
out but refused to leave the
premises.
Dunning's ERA is now 1.68
and he has hit three homers. He

struck out seven yesterday.
Stanford scored twice in the sixth
on a slew of walks and a double
by Bob Marshall (who's now
hitting .354). Then Dunning hit
his shot in the sixth.
Stanford plays at San Jose
State Friday, then hosts Fresno in
a twin bill here Saturday.
Also on Tuesday, Stanford's
Braves lost their second straight—a
10-1 decision to Contra Costa.
This was strange, since earlier the
Indians had beaten CC 19-1.
Coach Jim Jones explained: "We
took our second string and they
played fifth string ball."
Well, that's baseball.
Mike Leathers continues to
lead the team with a .438 average,
Tim Wilson is at .393 and Andy
Frank is hitting .368. Frank also
leads thyteam with two homers,
five stolen bases and nine runs
batted in.
