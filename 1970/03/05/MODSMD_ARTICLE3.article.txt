## Agnew Blasts Southern Riot 
### 
(AP) — South Carolina political
leaders, President Nixon and Vice
President Sprio T. Agnew spoke
out strongly Wednesday against
violence which erupted in Lamar,
S.C., where white parents
attacked Negro pupils attempting
to attend newly integrated
schools.
The small farming town was
calm Wednesday under the

watchful eye of riot-equipped
highway patrolmen, sheriff's
deputies and South Carolina Law
Enforcement Divison agents.
The police enforced quiet was
in sharp contrast to Tuesday,
when a mob of whites smashed
the windows out of three buses
carrying black pupils, some of
whom were injured by flying
glass. Two of the buses were

overturned after the children were
led to safety under a barrage of
tear gas.
The attack prompted Angew to
declare that the administration "
will not tolerate violence or
unlawful interference" with
efforts to desegregate schools.
"Speaking for myself and the
Cabinet committee which 1 chair,
I want to make it clear that this
administration does not condone
and will not tolerate violence
resulting from the lawful
desegregation of schools
anywhere," the vice president told
a news conference.
Earlier the White House said
through presidential press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler: "Any
time a group of adults intimidates
children to keep them from going
to school, any right thinking
American would deplore and
oppose that tvoe of action."
Lamar High School has been
closed until tensions in the town
ease. Seven citizens of the
community accused of
participating in Tuesday's actions
were ordered to appear in federal
court on Monday to show why a
restraning order should not be
issued against them.
Laos
WASHINGTON (AF) - A secret
session by Secretary of State
William P. Rogers with the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
appeared Wednesday to have
taken some steam out of current
Senate criticism of administration
policy on Laos.
"I was very pleased with the
free-wheeling discussion," Senate
Majority Leader Mike Mansfield,
D-Mont., a committee member,
said of the two hour meeting with

President Nixon's foreign affairs
chief.
"The secretary was quite
responsive, made a very good
impression and I think the
meeting was very worthwhile,"
said Mansfield, a long-time critic
of official U.S. policy in
Southeast Asia.
Committee Chairman J.W.
Fulbright, D-Ark., had said
Tuesday that an assessment by
high administration officials that
Laos is even more important than
Vietnam "scares me to death."
State Department press officer
Robert J. McCloskey disclosed
that Rogers met behind closed
doors with the committee late
Tuesday afternoon, after
Fulbright's public remarks.

WASHINGTON (AP)
Grumbling union leaders
post-poned a nationwide rail
strike today under a 37-day delay
ordered by Congress that got the
lawmakers out of a politically
tough spot but satisfied no one
else, including President Nixon.
"The bill preserves the status
quo for 37 days but does not
resolve the underlying dispute,"
said White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler in behalf of
President Nixon, who had wanted
Congress to order a settlement
now.
Members of Congress, many of
them dependent on labor support,
refused to act that quickly on
Nixon's politically touchy
proposal to dictate a labor
settlement for only a second time
in U.S. peacetime history.

Laos
WASHINGTON (AF) - A secret
session by Secretary of State
William P. Rogers with the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
appeared Wednesday to have
taken some steam out of current
Senate criticism of administration
policy on Laos.
"I was very pleased with the
free-wheeling discussion," Senate
Majority Leader Mike Mansfield,
D-Mont., a committee member,
said of the two hour meeting with

President Nixon's foreign affairs
chief.
"The secretary was quite
responsive, made a very good
impression and I think the
meeting was very worthwhile,"
said Mansfield, a long-time critic
of official U.S. policy in
Southeast Asia.
Committee Chairman J.W.
Fulbright, D-Ark., had said
Tuesday that an assessment by
high administration officials that
Laos is even more important than
Vietnam "scares me to death."
State Department press officer
Robert J. McCloskey disclosed
that Rogers met behind closed
doors with the committee late
Tuesday afternoon, after
Fulbright's public remarks.
Strike Averted
WASHINGTON (AP)
Grumbling union leaders
post-poned a nationwide rail
strike today under a 37-day delay
ordered by Congress that got the
lawmakers out of a politically
tough spot but satisfied no one
else, including President Nixon.
"The bill preserves the status
quo for 37 days but does not
resolve the underlying dispute,"
said White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler in behalf of
President Nixon, who had wanted
Congress to order a settlement
now.
Members of Congress, many of
them dependent on labor support,
refused to act that quickly on
Nixon's politically touchy
proposal to dictate a labor
settlement for only a second time
in U.S. peacetime history.
(AP) — South Carolina political
leaders, President Nixon and Vice
President Sprio T. Agnew spoke
out strongly Wednesday against
violence which erupted in Lamar,
S.C., where white parents
attacked Negro pupils attempting
to attend newly integrated
schools.
The small farming town was
calm Wednesday under the

watchful eye of riot-equipped
highway patrolmen, sheriff's
deputies and South Carolina Law
Enforcement Divison agents.
The police enforced quiet was
in sharp contrast to Tuesday,
when a mob of whites smashed
the windows out of three buses
carrying black pupils, some of
whom were injured by flying
glass. Two of the buses were

overturned after the children were
led to safety under a barrage of
tear gas.
The attack prompted Angew to
declare that the administration "
will not tolerate violence or
unlawful interference" with
efforts to desegregate schools.
"Speaking for myself and the
Cabinet committee which 1 chair,
I want to make it clear that this
administration does not condone
and will not tolerate violence
resulting from the lawful
desegregation of schools
anywhere," the vice president told
a news conference.
Earlier the White House said
through presidential press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler: "Any
time a group of adults intimidates
children to keep them from going
to school, any right thinking
American would deplore and
oppose that tvoe of action."
