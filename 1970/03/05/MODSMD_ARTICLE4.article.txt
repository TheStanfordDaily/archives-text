# Symposium Tonight
## 
### 
An open panel-symposium on Dissent in the scientific
community will be held this Sunday in Bishop Auditorium at 4
P.M. President Pitzer will be on the panel along with Charles
Schwartz, Berkeley physics professor, Edward Ginzton, chairman
of the board of Varian Associates and Art Bushkin from Lockheed
and the Moratorium. The focu.s will be on the rights of dissent and
the problems faced in exercising those rights, particularly for those
who work in the fields of science and engineering.
An important part of the symposium will be the
dinner-discussion groups in private homes that follow the panel. It
is hoped that through these smaller groups dialogue be made more
personal than ordinary panel format might permit, and that
communication can take place across the usual barriers between
campus and industry.
Those wishing to attend one of these groups should sign up first
with Cheri in 150 (x 2331). This is the second in a series of
symposia sponsored by Tail Beta Pi and TASC. ,
