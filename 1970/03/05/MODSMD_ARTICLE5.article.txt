# March Rallies Scheduled
## Kunstler May Speak Here 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Stanford anti-war leaders will
announce today whether or not
William Kunstler, chief defense
attorney for the Chicago Seven,
will speak at Stanford this month.
Kunstler has been invited by a
number of leftist political
organizations, including the
Stanford Community Against War
and Fascism.
The groups have planned a
large rally for the weekend of
March 15 which Kuntsler and one
of the Chicago Seven are
scheduled to attend if Kuntsler's
schedule cannot permit him to
visit Stanford this month,
however, an invitation will be
extended for him to address the
campus in April.
The Vietnam Moratorium has
planned a major anti-draft rally

for Sunday afternoon, March 15
and representatives of the
Moratorium and the left coalition
have discussed a possible merging
of the two rallies. As yet no
decision has been reached.
The program for the anti-draft
rally has not yet been definitively
set, but Moratorium leaders
indicate that a local congressman,
a United States Senator, and a
representative from the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference
are scheduled to speak.
Draft Repeal
The anti-draft rally will
embody two themes; the urgency
of the demand for draft repeal,
and tribute to the 2,000 men who
have gone to jail to resist the
draft. The rally will emphasize
that Stanford's own former
Student Body President, David

Harris, is now in prison because he
refused to be inducted.
The anti-draft rally is a part of
a renewed campaign on the part
of the Vietnam Moratorium to
raise the level of protest against
the war and the issues directly
related to it.
Moratorium leaders are hoping
that this month's rally, and the
follow-up talks in local high
schools and community groups
planned by the Committee to
Repeal the Draft, will convince
people to write their congressmen
and demand an end to the draft
this year.
The Moratorium's activities in
April will center around the
demand for a reordering of
priorities, and an end to the use of
tax dollars to continue the war.
Leaders are considering tax
protests at Internal Revenue
Service centers on April 15, the
day tax returns are due. Some
withholding of the portion of
taxes that would go for the war
may also be urged.
The Moratorium will also
sponsor on April 15 a program of
speakers and activities that will
emphasize the effects of the war
on the environment and the
quality of life in America. Three
thousand black armbands with the
theme, "Put Life First," have
been ordered.
Distorted Priorities
The organization's goals for the
coming months were recently
stated by community organizer
Arthur Bushkin, "The
Moratorium recognizes that a
distorted set of national priorities
requires a turnabout in direction
by persons and structures.
"How to accomplish this
emphasis on priorities for solving
such national problems as
pollution, and racial and
economic injustice should leave
open the door for those who
demand a radical orientation by
political action, draft and tax
resistance, and massive
demonstrations."
The Moratorium Steering
Committee will consider next
week a proposal that the
Moratorium officially endorse and
work for peace candidates in the
area.
Some students, faculty and
community members have been
considering running a peace
candidate against Representative
Charles Gubser, a Republican
whose district encompases
Stanford. Some are urging the
Moratorium to take an active role
in the campaign to defeat Gubser
this November.

people to write their congressmen
and demand an end to the draft
this year.
The Moratorium's activities in
April will center around the
demand for a reordering of
priorities, and an end to the use of
tax dollars to continue the war.
Leaders are considering tax
protests at Internal Revenue
Service centers on April 15, the
day tax returns are due. Some
withholding of the portion of
taxes that would go for the war
may also be urged.
The Moratorium will also
sponsor on April 15 a program of
speakers and activities that will
emphasize the effects of the war
on the environment and the
quality of life in America. Three
thousand black armbands with the
theme, "Put Life First," have
been ordered.
Distorted Priorities
The organization's goals for the
coming months were recently
stated by community organizer
Arthur Bushkin, "The
Moratorium recognizes that a
distorted set of national priorities
requires a turnabout in direction
by persons and structures.
"How to accomplish this
emphasis on priorities for solving
such national problems as
pollution, and racial and
economic injustice should leave
open the door for those who
demand a radical orientation by
political action, draft and tax
resistance, and massive
demonstrations."
The Moratorium Steering
Committee will consider next
week a proposal that the
Moratorium officially endorse and
work for peace candidates in the
area.
Some students, faculty and
community members have been
considering running a peace
candidate against Representative
Charles Gubser, a Republican
whose district encompases
Stanford. Some are urging the
Moratorium to take an active role
in the campaign to defeat Gubser
this November.

Stanford anti-war leaders will
announce today whether or not
William Kunstler, chief defense
attorney for the Chicago Seven,
will speak at Stanford this month.
Kunstler has been invited by a
number of leftist political
organizations, including the
Stanford Community Against War
and Fascism.
The groups have planned a
large rally for the weekend of
March 15 which Kuntsler and one
of the Chicago Seven are
scheduled to attend if Kuntsler's
schedule cannot permit him to
visit Stanford this month,
however, an invitation will be
extended for him to address the
campus in April.
The Vietnam Moratorium has
planned a major anti-draft rally

for Sunday afternoon, March 15
and representatives of the
Moratorium and the left coalition
have discussed a possible merging
of the two rallies. As yet no
decision has been reached.
The program for the anti-draft
rally has not yet been definitively
set, but Moratorium leaders
indicate that a local congressman,
a United States Senator, and a
representative from the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference
are scheduled to speak.
Draft Repeal
The anti-draft rally will
embody two themes; the urgency
of the demand for draft repeal,
and tribute to the 2,000 men who
have gone to jail to resist the
draft. The rally will emphasize
that Stanford's own former
Student Body President, David

Harris, is now in prison because he
refused to be inducted.
The anti-draft rally is a part of
a renewed campaign on the part
of the Vietnam Moratorium to
raise the level of protest against
the war and the issues directly
related to it.
Moratorium leaders are hoping
that this month's rally, and the
follow-up talks in local high
schools and community groups
planned by the Committee to
Repeal the Draft, will convince
people to write their congressmen
