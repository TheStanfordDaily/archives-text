# Panofsky, A-Bomb Film Highlight Convocation
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Professor Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, bitterly
attacked the Nixon
Administration's missile defense
policies in a speech to over 1,000
persons in Memorial Church last
night.
Panofsky spoke at the second
annual March 4 Convocation, a
day-long program which also
included recently released film
showing incredibly scenes of
destruction and horror following
the U.S. atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Other
activities included the signing of a
pledge not to participate in war
research or weapons production.
Concentrating specifically on
the administrations attitude
toward ABM and arms limitation
talks, Panofsky said. "The chance

of bringing the arms race under
control through SALT (Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks with the
I T SSR would be much improved if
we did not start now on the road
to an ABM program."
An important part of the day's
activities took place earlier at a
ceremony in Berkeley when 100
scientists signed a pledge not to
participate in war research or
weapons production. Berkeley
Professor Charles Schwartz
explained the pledge saying, "We
are beginning to feel our
government is sponsoring the
wrong kinds of activities and
scientists can no longer hold a
laissez-faire attitude toward their
research."
Corrupt Attitude
Schwartz attacked what he
called the "thoroughly corrupt
attitude" of Charles A. Anderson,

director of SRI, who was quoted
recently in the San Francisco
Chronicle as calling for
"expanding man's knowledge in
the sevice of our clients."
He said scientists must find a
collective attitude toward their
research which would correspond
to the Hippocratic Oath of
physicians.
Criticism of the present
administration's program of
weapons research came from
Panofsky but he said would not
sign the pledge since he could
conceive of situations where war
research might be acceptable.
Panofsky said that complete
unilateral disarmament could be
as foolish as the present weapons
build up, and called for a freeze
on deployment of strategic
armaments saying that, "once the
present arms race is halted the
way might be paved for future
reductions."
Over 20,000 Weapons
"The world's inventory is
easily in excess of 20,000 nuclear
weapons," "Panofsky told his
audience, "each of which would
have an explosive power greatly
above that which caused the
devastation in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki which you have just
seen." The U.S. and the USSR
combined have enough nuclear
explosive power at their command
to correspond to more than 10
tons of TNT equivalent for each
man, woman, and child on the
surface of the earth!"
Dr. Panofsky explained how
the American ABM system was
officially described as a deterrent
to a Soviet "first strike" when
presented before Congress last
year. But now the administration
is hoping to enlarge the system to
include a limited protective screen
for the entire country he said.
This development could be viewed
as a "damage-limiting" role of
protecting our cities if we struck
first, and in that sense pose a
threat to the Soviets.
"ABM and MIRV's through
their interlocking role have .ueled
the arms race," said Panofsky.
"Deployment of ABM by the
Soviets has given the incentive for
U.S. development of MIRV;
deployment of multiple warheads
by the Soviets has given an excuse
for U.S. deployment of Safeguard
(ABM's); the possible role of
Safeguard in protecting cities will
give rise to Soviet fears of being
able to maintain their deterrent
against us; the possibility of
improving the accuracy of
American MIRV's appears to
threaten Soviet missile silos, and
so on.
"We cannot rationally pursue a
course where we are willing to
take no military risks at all in
pursuing arms control
negotiations. SALT offers a new
opportunity to redirect our
national priorities from an
unproductive and dangerous
technological contest to the
solution of urgent problems at
home."
