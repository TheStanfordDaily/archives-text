Brooks Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
The quotations published in
yesterday's Daily give a very
misleading and incomplete picture
of the superb performance of Vice
Provost Brooks in carrying out his
special assignment with respect to
ROTC. Throughout the
negotiations, he diligently sought
to obtain full concordance with
the Faculty Senate's action of
1969.
He was in close touch with me
during the negotiations, and I
know for a fact that he was able
to persuade the Defense
Department to meet Stanford's
position on important points. I
can say without reservation that
Dr. Brooks carried out this
assignment effectively and with
complete integrity, and that my
confidence that this would be the
case was my primary reason for
asking him to accept this difficult
assignment.

Rebuttal to Freivogel
Editor, THE DAILY:
After talking with Bill
Freivogel on the telephone for
over 45 minutes last Thursday
evening and twice again during the
weekend (I thought we had
discussed some very cogent and
attention-demanding issues), I was
bewildered to read in his March 3
article on ROTC that the only
thing he recalled from our long
conversation was an off-the-cuff
inane comment I made in between
the really pertinent issues. Since
Freivogel has shown himself
incapable of reporting the
interview, I feel I must clarify
what really was said during that
45-minute session:
1) I do not "vehemently deny"
being engaged. My argument with
Freivogel was that he had no
privilege to display my personal
affairs in the Daily. I didn't even
ask him not to print the
well-known fact of my
engagement; indeed, it is

irrelevant, since my fiance is not
in ROTC this year and therefore
accusations that I am "pressured"
into certain decisions are inviable.
2) The quote in the article of
what I remarked to Freivogel is
entirely meaningless without the
context in which it was said. I was
explaining to Freivogel that I
could not divorce myself from the
ugly fact that young men,
irregardless of considerations of
its propriety, are being drafted
and forced into obligatory service
in the Armed Forces.
I personally regard this
coercion as intolerable. ROTC
offers an alternative for the man
who wants to plan his life,
fulfilling his obligation without
being subject to the chance nature
of the draft which might disrupt
his education, job, or personal
life. Also, ROTC allows men to
enter the Armed Forces as
commissioned officers - a fact
which, in itself, is vital, since
civilian-trained officers tend to
liberalize the DOD.

As long as young men are being
required to serve in the Armed
Forces, I think it is ethically and
politically mandatory that there
be alternatives for them to choose
among. My committment is that
the priority belongs to the young
men whose lives are being affected
by such decisions, rather than to
the University.
3) I absolutely did not say that
I thought that the Senate's Feb.
13, 1969, resolution "went too
far on the credit issue." The truth
is that I thought the Senate's
statement did not clarify the
credit issue in any direction — I
thought it didn't go far enough,
since it was so vague that the
ROTC committee found it
uninterpretable in the first place
and that's why the entire matter
was referred back to the Senate
on Jan. 22, 1970.
This matter was especially
frustrating for me as a student
member of the committee, since I
requested in three successive
meetings (over a two-mo nth
period) that we should solicit an
intcrpretationbefore we made any
evaluations or decisions upon the
proposed Army contract. I was
most rudely ignored all three
times (the students generally
participated very little by the
mere fact that they were never
really incorporated into the
committee.)
During the fourth meeting, the
committee ironically decided that
the only step it could take was to
refer the issue to the Senate for an
interpretation. Essentially, what I
had suggested in October was
finally implemented in late
January — except that the
committee is using the Senate's
reinterpretation as an enactment,
rather than for evaluation, of the
Army proposal. I disagree with
this procedure.
4) As to the matter of student
representation on the committee,
I do consider the quotas as being
unbalanced. However, the student
members for the ROTC
committee were selected by a
committee composed of
representatives from the ASSU
Student Senate. All University
students were encouraged to
apply for positions on the ROTC
committee, as two weeks of
successive advertising in the Daily
last spring will attest.
Therefore, the composition of
the student representation on the
ROTC committee was
autonomously the action of
students. This means either that
1) the ASSU is inviable as a
legislator of student concerns and
opinions, or 2) we three were
indeed, the best-qualified
applicants among those paltry few
un-apathetic students who
bothered to apply.
Freivogel and I also discussed
other relevant aspects of the
controversy which I think should
be revealed to the Stanford
community — I challenge him to
do so, rather than report the most
trivial, off-hand comments of an
interview.
