FAMILIAR EQUATION?
It describes the dynamics of a linear system
We use such equations in solving problems in inertial guidance for ships, aircraft,
and submarines. The work involves analytical research relating to gimballed and
strapdown inertial systems & sensors including: mathematical modeling of
physical processes, inertial system error analysis, system synthesis, optimization
and evaluation in the area of Navigation, Guidance and Control.
We'll be an campus Tuesday, March 10th talking to MS A Doctoral graduates in
EE, Aero/Astro or Systems who are familiar with automatic control systems and
random process theory.
The positions are located 8 miles from Boston & Cambridge and offer excellent
salaries, benefits and paid re-location.
If you're interested in joining a small fast-moving research firm and enjoy pro
fessional recognition of your work, plan to see us on Tuesday, March I Oth.
