ROTC
The undersigned urge a vote of approval of the Senate's decision of January 22, 1970. We believe that the
adverse actions against ROTC at Stanford initiated by a vote of the Senate of 25 to 8 on February 13,1969,
were based on an inadequate appraisal of the situation. A more deliberate mail ballot by the Academic Coun
cil supported the Senate by a narrow margin of 403 to 356 in April of 1969. On January 22, 1970, the
Senate decided with a vote of 23 to 13 to accept on a one-year trial basis an Army proposal permitting
credit for academically suitable Army courses. We are in support of the position which restores the possi
bility of credit for courses in ROTC.
The votes providing for possible credit in ROTC courses increased in the three polls cited above from
24% to 47% to 64% in the latest Senate decision. We believe that this shift involves an increased awareness
of the value of ROTC. One contribution to this awareness was a report published in the April 4, 1969
Stanford Daily signed by thirteen Council members.
We reprint below cogent arguments from that report. The enduring validity of these arguments shows that
ROTC at Stanford has served for decades the interests of Stanford, its students, and the nation. Remarks by George Kaplan, assistant professor of Psychology, at Monday s Academic Council meeting.
