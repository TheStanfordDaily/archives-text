# In Isla Vista
## The 						Bank Rebuilds 
### 
The Bank of America has
placed full-page advertisements in
daily newspapers across the
country (including The Stanford
Daily) announcing the rebuilding
of their burned-out branch at
ISLA Vista near the University of
California at Santa Barbara
campus. A temporary branch will
open Monday.
The ad, which follows by a
week another ad that appeared in
66 papers throughout California,
sharply condemns "violence as a
means of political dissent."
The reopening of the branch
and running of the advertisement
was announced in San Francisco
yesterday at a press conference in
the World Headquarters of the
bank. Speaking at the conference,
bank president A.W. Clausen said,
"We realize that there is danger in
this course of action. But we
believe the greater danger to
ourselves and to all of the people
in this nation is to be intimidated
by mob violence. We refuse to be
so intimidated."
Clausen also stated that one of
the major reasons for reopening
the branch was "to serve the
financial needs of the majority of
students on the Santa Barbara
campus." He said that 95% of the
branch's customers are students
and that the majority of loans at
the branch are to students at rates
"significantly below prevailing
rates." 1,600 persons at the

13,000 student university
currently have Bank of America
educational loans totaling $1.5
million.
The bespectacled bank
president praised "the courageous
response of many dedicated
public officials. They deserve the
cooperation of all citizens. They
will have ours." He did not name
any specific officials.
The burning followed rising
tensions between students at the
Santa Barbara campus and some
realtors and merchants in Isla
Vista. Chicago 7 defense attorney

William Kunstler also gavea speech
on the campus on the evening of
the 25th.
Clausen said that the bank did
not intend the advertisement to
be "provocative," but that they
felt it was necessary to express
this "silent majority view."
Queried as to whether the
police should have moved more
quickly to stop the burning of the
branch Clausen replied that "life
is certainly more important than
physical damage." He noted that
the police were understaffed at
the scene.
