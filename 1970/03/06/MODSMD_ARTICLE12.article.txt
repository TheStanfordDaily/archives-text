# More On Mideast
## Peace & Understanding 
### JESSE CEDARBAUM 
* The ongoing conflict in the
Middle East is potentially one of
the most explosive situations in
tfie world today. The problem has
indeed outstepped the bounds of
4 regional territorial conflict, and
has become a major factor in the
intricate East-West power balance.
To the peoples involved,
however, the realities of
day-to-day combat seem to have
little to do with the rest of the
world. The Israelis are fighting to
maintain their tenuous grasp on a
sliver of land promised to their
forefathers in the Bible, and
which they themselves feel to be
the one hope for the safety of
world Jewry. The Arabs on the
other hand are fighting to regain a
land which they feel was wrongly
taken from them
The Arabs believe that the
Jews are intruders in their area of
the world; that in their desire to
create a national homeland the
Jews usurped a land which was
not theirs and drove out its
former occupants. In their selfish
state of mind they created an
expansionist monster-state whose
appetite for conquest has not yet
been satisfied.
A kind of brotherhood exists
between the Arab of surrounding
Yiations and the "Palestinian"
Arabs who lost their homes; all
have a common desire to right the
[wrongs which they feel have been
done to them.
Arab Views Vary
As for hopes for peace in the
[Middle East, Arab views as those
iof any large group on any issue -
'cover a spectrum from the
extreme position that the Israelis
should be driven back into the sea

from which they came, to the
more moderate position that
Israel should be "De-Zionized,"
that is the Palestinian Arabs who
left Israel should be allowed to
return as full citizens and a new
government should be set up
guaranteeing equal rights to both
Jews and Arabs.
But in any case, as one Arab
student put it, the Israelis should
be stopped from "practicing on us
what was practiced on them for so
long."
The Israelis, on the other hand,
firmly believe that the land
belongs to them It was promised
to them in the Bible, and was
settled by Jews until its
devastation by the Romans about
100 A.D. Moreover, much of the
land allotted to the Jewish State
by the UN partition of 1947 was
owned by Jews, and it was only in
defense of the country that more
land was gained in the ensuing
War of Independence.
Conquering lor Delense
Likewise, the Israelis consider
the land conquered in the 1967
war to be necessary to the defense
of the country as long as their
Arab neighbors remain hostile.
Many Israelis, however, consider
the vast stretches of desert and
their millions of Arab inhabitants
to be a royal pain in the ass, and
would be more than willing to
give much of it up in exchange for
some guarantee of the integrity of
their borders.
What the Israelis want most,
though, is to be able to sit down
at a conference table to negotiate
directly with the Arab leaders in
order to establish a lasting peace
in the area.

The Arabs refuse to do this,
however, for two reasons. First,
they are afraid of further Israeli
expansion, and cite as proof of its
inevitability the encouragement
offered by the Israeli government
to Jewish immigrants from all
over the world.
Secondly, the Arabs feel that it
is the responsibility of the Israelis
to resettle the many refugees who
left their homes in what is now
Israel during the wars of '48, '56,
and '67. The Israelis are reluctant
to assimilate a large potential fifth
column threat into their culture,
and though they would like to live
in peace and "domestic
tranquility" with their Arab
neighbors, would rather see the
surrounding Arab states take in as
many of the refugees as possible.
The stalemate thus drags on. A
settlement which would be "fair"
and "just" to one side would
obviously not appear so to the
other. A decisive military victory
by the Israelis would not improve
the situation, for they would then
have to contend with the teeming,
unfriendly Arab masses under
their control.
On the other hand, an Arab
defeat of Israel would raise
world-wide cries of "Genocide!"
and would solve nothing either.
Likewise, a solution imposed by
the major powers, who would be
acting in their own self-interest, is
also out of the question.
An end to the crisis in the
Middle East thus seems unlikely
until such a time that men learn
to live together in peace and
understanding. And maybe then,
when peace comes to the Holy
Land, it will come to the rest of
the world as well.

* The ongoing conflict in the
Middle East is potentially one of
the most explosive situations in
tfie world today. The problem has
indeed outstepped the bounds of
4 regional territorial conflict, and
has become a major factor in the
intricate East-West power balance.
To the peoples involved,
however, the realities of
day-to-day combat seem to have
little to do with the rest of the
world. The Israelis are fighting to
maintain their tenuous grasp on a
sliver of land promised to their
forefathers in the Bible, and
which they themselves feel to be
the one hope for the safety of
world Jewry. The Arabs on the
other hand are fighting to regain a
land which they feel was wrongly
taken from them
The Arabs believe that the
Jews are intruders in their area of
the world; that in their desire to
create a national homeland the
Jews usurped a land which was
not theirs and drove out its
former occupants. In their selfish
state of mind they created an
expansionist monster-state whose
appetite for conquest has not yet
been satisfied.

Arab Views Vary
As for hopes for peace in the
[Middle East, Arab views as those
iof any large group on any issue -
'cover a spectrum from the
extreme position that the Israelis
should be driven back into the sea

from which they came, to the
more moderate position that
Israel should be "De-Zionized,"
that is the Palestinian Arabs who
left Israel should be allowed to
return as full citizens and a new
government should be set up
guaranteeing equal rights to both
Jews and Arabs.
But in any case, as one Arab
student put it, the Israelis should
be stopped from "practicing on us
what was practiced on them for so
long."
The Israelis, on the other hand,
firmly believe that the land
belongs to them It was promised
to them in the Bible, and was
settled by Jews until its
devastation by the Romans about
100 A.D. Moreover, much of the
land allotted to the Jewish State
by the UN partition of 1947 was
owned by Jews, and it was only in
defense of the country that more
land was gained in the ensuing
War of Independence.
Conquering lor Delense
Likewise, the Israelis consider
the land conquered in the 1967
war to be necessary to the defense
of the country as long as their
Arab neighbors remain hostile.
Many Israelis, however, consider
the vast stretches of desert and
their millions of Arab inhabitants
to be a royal pain in the ass, and
would be more than willing to
give much of it up in exchange for
some guarantee of the integrity of
their borders.
What the Israelis want most,
though, is to be able to sit down
at a conference table to negotiate
directly with the Arab leaders in
order to establish a lasting peace
in the area.

The Arabs refuse to do this,
however, for two reasons. First,
they are afraid of further Israeli
expansion, and cite as proof of its
inevitability the encouragement
offered by the Israeli government
to Jewish immigrants from all
over the world.
Secondly, the Arabs feel that it
is the responsibility of the Israelis
to resettle the many refugees who
left their homes in what is now
Israel during the wars of '48, '56,
and '67. The Israelis are reluctant
to assimilate a large potential fifth
column threat into their culture,
and though they would like to live
in peace and "domestic
tranquility" with their Arab
neighbors, would rather see the
surrounding Arab states take in as
many of the refugees as possible.

however, for two reasons. First,
they are afraid of further Israeli
expansion, and cite as proof of its
inevitability the encouragement
offered by the Israeli government
to Jewish immigrants from all
over the world.
Secondly, the Arabs feel that it
is the responsibility of the Israelis
to resettle the many refugees who
left their homes in what is now
Israel during the wars of '48, '56,
and '67. The Israelis are reluctant
to assimilate a large potential fifth
column threat into their culture,
and though they would like to live
in peace and "domestic
tranquility" with their Arab
neighbors, would rather see the
surrounding Arab states take in as
many of the refugees as possible.
The stalemate thus drags on. A
settlement which would be "fair"
and "just" to one side would
obviously not appear so to the
other. A decisive military victory
by the Israelis would not improve
the situation, for they would then
have to contend with the teeming,
unfriendly Arab masses under
their control.
On the other hand, an Arab
defeat of Israel would raise
world-wide cries of "Genocide!"
and would solve nothing either.
Likewise, a solution imposed by
the major powers, who would be
acting in their own self-interest, is
also out of the question.
An end to the crisis in the
Middle East thus seems unlikely
until such a time that men learn
to live together in peace and
understanding. And maybe then,
when peace comes to the Holy
Land, it will come to the rest of
the world as well.
