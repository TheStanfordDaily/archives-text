"Itlindfold We Racc At The Night"
"Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to
thee."
—Ahab
One had the awe-full feeling, as
he listened to the tale, that he lay
near to discovering some fantastic
truth, to seeing a new entrance
into the reality beneath what we
so commonly accept as "truth."
What I report to you is no
dream, no, no fantasy, but a factual
account one who witnessed all that
follows below. My informant
began this history in a grave and
solemn tone:
"It must have been past
midnight, as I wandered through
the fog, when three students raced
in fearsome hilarity out of the
Wilbur Houses. I say raced, but
most accurately, they slammed
and crashed their way through the
fragile glass doors, tumbled down
the stairwells, and careened past
fallen bicycles as they sought the
driveway and the road.
"It came to me, as I studied
their curious zig-zag weave away
from their dormitory, that they
must be wearing blindfolds.
Blindfolds! For in no other way
could I account for their cries of
'which way?'and'overhere!'in the
gloom of that evening.
"They must have been freaked,
for one of them kept exclaiming,
'nine joints! nine joints!' Yes, a
thick mist, the kind that settles on
Stanford late in the night, had
indeed moved in beneath the
clouds from the bay, but there
was certainly enough light to
advance without mishap.
"Yet this strange trinity, these
carefree tapioca brains, stumbled
and bounced with reckless
abandon in that eerie glow
between the few islands of
hopeful light around the Victorian
map posts.
"By some strange power I
cannot describe, they seemed to
called to some distant goal,
because for all their falls and cries
of pain, they refused to stop or
withdraw the blindfolds that hid
their apparent flight towards
self-destruction. Why they ever
had left the warmth of their
home, I do not know.
"Fascinated, drawn along with
them, I could not stop myself
from following. Straight as 1 am,

it felt as though I too had inhaled
the vapors their room, for I was
suddenly light, lightness and
darkness at once, floating and
penetrating the oppressive
blackness of night and day.
Waste and Decay
"We four horsemen, a trinity
joined by Satan, lurched into the
ivy beds near Stern, then glided
towards the row of trash bins
outside the kitchens. The smell of
waste and decay forced us farther
to the right, where I, still without
a blindfold, spied the neon aura of
the library. Holding their hands, I
now led the way.
"Our pilgrimage in the night
continued, around the library,
once, twice, uncountable numbers
of times, circling those books,
hovering over them, attracted
beyond reason but unable to get
inside. Was there some forgotten
strand of information in those
woven texts, those fabrics of
knowledge? I shall never be sure.
"For we advanced once again,
from war to war and peace to
peace, alternating sides of the
same silver dollar, pestilence and
famine staring at us from every
kiosk on our route. But on this
night of smoky freedom, no
concern was too large, no
responsibilities impinged too
greatly, to halt our nether flight.
Lonely Voices
"Swiftly now, we talked of
plans for tomorrow and the day
after, assorting our pictures to
coalesce with all the lonely voices
of the post office boxes. And we
were all without eyes or mouths
or ears, indistinct forms reflecting
the monstrous blackness.
"The fountain had stopped,
and we knew from the silence,
the sudden absence of our sonar
echoes, that the plaza was before
us. I heard them risk a timorous
sob of joy, and they were no
longer beside me.
"They were running now,
screaming, spirits upon a vast
ocean of asphalt. Two were in
front, the third trailed behind,
and they seemed to have united
with time, for there was no
judging of their speed.
Disaster in the Dark
"The two in front finally

collapsed on the Tresidder steps,
but the third was still coming. He
poured himself toward them,
rolling and flowing like batter
from a wooden bowl, sticking and
sliding like the chrome syrup on
the freeways, until his inexorable
course was interrupted by one of
those same kiosks we had passed
before. "And the stars came out
as he slammed in woeful disbelief
into the horrid landmark,
crumpling in agonous sleep at its
concrete base.
"His friends carried him into
the coffeehouse, but following
them in, I could not find them.
Where I expected a bloodied pulp
and wondrous spectators, I found
only a few couples whispering
over coffee and apple cider. Where
those students are now, I do not
know."
My informant, clearly
exhausted, called an end to his
tale. I cannot take credit for his
vision, and he bade me not reveal
his name.
I have long struggled to
comprehend some part of this
history, this apparent metaphor or
our age. What had forced them
into such an alienated trance?
And what were they searching for
behind those rags across their
eyes? And you — what do you
know of this world and its
sorrow? What have you seen, and
what have you come to tell me?
Anything? But for rare love, I
would tell you we are souls adrift
in the misty dark, racing blindfold
at the night, waiting end-less for
the dawn.
