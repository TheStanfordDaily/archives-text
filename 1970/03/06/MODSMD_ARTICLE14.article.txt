# Dillingham Caught In Bind
## 
### Paul Rupert 
The land at the corner of El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road
is still vacant. The Dillingham
Corporation, which intended to
break ground for the Palo Alto
Square project early in the
quarter, still wants that land for
its profitable financial complex,
but apparently has run into
problems. Its recent cancellation
of a much larger project in Los
Angeles because of lack of funds
points to the source of the delay:
the tight money market resulting
from the War in Vietnam.
Dillingham, like many of the
giant international corporations, is
caught in a bind. It is involved in
Asia and plans heavy expansion
there, and recognizes the war as a
necessary effort to "stabilize" and
secure the area for American
interests. But at the same time, it
is being hurt by tight money and
cancelled projects here at home.
Critics of the Palo Alto Square
project, or of Dillingham's
planned eviction of 500 elderly
persons from a San Jose trailer
park to build a hotel, or of the
Tahoe Keys project which marred
a long section of Lake Tahoe's
shoreline, or of their Waikiki
Beach development in Hawaii
should not be at all surprised that
Dillingham is busy dredging
harbors, building pipelines,
constructing roads and erecting
resorts and luxury apartments in
Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines
Guatemala, Colombia and El
Salvador. Dillingham's
"development" formula is simple:
develop what you can, where you
can, for as much as you can â€”
whatever the impact of that
development on the real needs of
the people.
In The Beginning
This common American
business formula has proven
uncommonly successful for the
Hawaii-based giant. Dillingham
got its start, much like Stanford,
in railroads. It ran rail and water
transportation systems which
carried Hawaii's sugar and
pineapple to the ports. Eventually
it took to dredging and building
the ports and then organizing
water transportation. As
transportation systems changed
early in the century, it became the
dominant Hawaiian road
contractor.
Eventually Dillingham became
a major landholder in Hawaii. It's
building and paving activities and
its dredging activities led it into
mining and oil ventures. Its
present resort, office-building and
hotel capabilities were perfected
when it helped transform a
swampy beach area into Waikiki
and helped develop that
famed and blighted paradise.
The company that was slowly
building both infrastructures and
interests in mining and
manufacturing might have stayed
local for a long time. But as a
Dillingham publication says,
"World War II brought Hawaiian
Dredging (a Dillingham
subsidiary), with other companies,
into the largest single contract in
the history of the construction
industry, building various military
facilities around the Pacific during
the course of World War 11.
Dillingham International
The post-war years saw
Dillingham grow into an
international corporation. As the
French empire in Southeast Asia
began to fall apart, Dillingham
was among the American
corporations that began to move
in.
But these profitable
"development" activities were
threatened and continue to be
threatened by the war in Vietnam,
and the insurgencies in Laos and
Thailand. It is only natural that
Dillingham would be building
military installations throughout
the area, at the same time as it
steps up its port, railroad and
r oa d - b u i Iding activities.

Dillingham dredges and
construction crews have been hard
at work in Vietnam for several
years, and the company is just
completing work on a major
harbor/airfield complex in
Sattahip, Thailand. The giant
recognizes the need for a military
infrastructure to protect its
vulnerable economic
infrastructure as local residents
threaten to take matters into their
own hands.
No doubt this insurgency
comes as no surprise to
Dillingham executives who have
been dealing with insurgent
workers and angered landowners
and residents throughout its
history. Dillingham never
pretended in its early days that it
was developing Hawaii in anyone's
interests but its own and those of
its few white friends. The rhetoric
has changed now, but Dillingham
is still anti-union, pro-profit and
indifferent if not hostile to its
critics.
Will Development Proceed?
It still intends to develop its
little corner of Palo Alto as it sees
fit. Student and faculty critics and
the residents of Barron Park who
signed petitions have also been
told by President Pitzer, the Real
Estate office and the Business
Office (in words reminiscent of
Lyndon Johnson as we set out to
conquer Vietnam) that the
university has a solemn
"commitment" with Dillingham,
and it cannot and will not violate
that agreement. Such a
commitment between corporate
chiefs is the strongest
commitment in American society.
Commitments to the well-being of
the people and the area are
secondary.

Nonetheless, Dillinham seems
to be held up on this commitment
while the war in Vietnam and
Laos continues. While the struggle

in Asia for the control of land
rages, ours is just beginning.
There's no better place to start
than with Dillingham.
