# No Longer Surprised
## A 						Lack Of Response 
### Doug McHenry 
As a Black man, as a Black American, as a Black
student attending one of my country's best known
institutions of higher learning, I am at once incensed
and disturbed at its lack of social consciousness. The
weak, or perhaps to put it more accurately, lack of
response on the part of this university and other
institutions like it to recent statements by Vice
President Agnew concerning its academic
credibility, is no less than a form of social
irresponsibility.
At a recent hundred-dollar blue plate dinner,
held within the feudal realm of America's most
benevolent despot, Mayor Daley, the Vice President
made known his views concerning minority
admission programs. In no uncertain terms, he
warned the group of business leaders, that such
admission policies have a 'pernicious result' on the
quality of education received by students admitted
under these programs.
The practice has a 'pernicious result' Agnew
warned of creating a vested interest in seeing that
those admitted this way succeed. The same
pressures which operated to bring about the
favored admissions status of those admitted
because of race, socio-economic class, or ethnic
background continue to operate in favor of their
successful completion of studies undertaken.
Why hasn't Stanford which developed a minority
program responded to Agnew's accusations? Why
hasn't Stanford asked for the empirical data upon
which he has based his statements? Why hasn't
Stanford and others made it clear that they grant
one degree, and one degree only upon their
graduates, and cleared the air of doubt?
Disparate Kducation?
Or am I to believe that in fact there is a disparate
system of education at Stanford? That in fact,
Stanford has a segragated educational system, in its
own subtle way, just as racist as those in the South.
And on graduation day there really are two degrees
which this university confers upon its graduates; one
representing incompetence, mediocrity, the other
academic competence The first stamped minority
and the other stamped quality by the wider, whiter,
social community.
To the liberal who doesn't want the university to
become embroiled in such unpopular issues as the
'race problem' I am overacting. And therefore I am
reading a lot into Agnew's statements which simply

is not there; my analysis is warped by a lack of
objectivity.
In answer to this particular viewpoint, which I
consider more disturbing than one which disagrees
with my points solely on principle, I can think of no
more appropriate reply than the words of the vice
president; it is best that he speak for himself.
For those who think there should be racial or
socio-economic class quotas in college
admissions, the vice president said he would ask
these questions; "When next you are sick, do you
wish to be attended by a physician who entered
medical school to fill a quota or by his medical
appitude. When next you build a house, do you
want an architect selected for school by appitude
or by quota."
Academic Credibility
Because Stanford has a minority program, the
academic credibility of the Stanford degree has been
called into question. By logical extension, Harvard,
Yale, University of California, and all the other
schools across the nation which have such programs
are involved. This is an attack upon the quality of
their degree and nothing less: it is not a minority
problem, it is a university problem which must be
dealt with. If what Agnew says is true, we minority
students should be the first to know, because I for
one would demand some changes.
Universities have long been over due in
responding to rumors which Agnew and others like
him, use to spread the fears of middle America.
Failing to respond to theirmore ludicrous accusations
with facts, only serves to help them cause disparity
among us, to polarize, rather than to unite us.
In an age when policemen are wiring phones,
searching pedestrians, and making gestapo raids, all
with the consent of the majority of Americans, I
guess I should not expect a response on the part of
the university. In an age when one judge can make a
mockery out of the American judicial system, and
convict seven men for expressing their opinions, all
with the consent of the majority of Americans, I
should not expect a response. In an age when the
majority consents to let a few ruin the quality of
our environment, kill whom they please, and wage
an unconstitutional, immoral, war; in this age of
'benign neglect' I guess I should not be surprised
over the lack of a response.

representing incompetence, mediocrity, the other
academic competence The first stamped minority
and the other stamped quality by the wider, whiter,
social community.
To the liberal who doesn't want the university to
become embroiled in such unpopular issues as the
'race problem' I am overacting. And therefore I am
reading a lot into Agnew's statements which simply

is not there; my analysis is warped by a lack of
objectivity.
In answer to this particular viewpoint, which I
consider more disturbing than one which disagrees
with my points solely on principle, I can think of no
more appropriate reply than the words of the vice
president; it is best that he speak for himself.
For those who think there should be racial or
socio-economic class quotas in college
admissions, the vice president said he would ask
these questions; "When next you are sick, do you
wish to be attended by a physician who entered
medical school to fill a quota or by his medical
appitude. When next you build a house, do you
want an architect selected for school by appitude
or by quota."
Academic Credibility
Because Stanford has a minority program, the
academic credibility of the Stanford degree has been
called into question. By logical extension, Harvard,
Yale, University of California, and all the other
schools across the nation which have such programs
are involved. This is an attack upon the quality of
their degree and nothing less: it is not a minority
problem, it is a university problem which must be
dealt with. If what Agnew says is true, we minority
students should be the first to know, because I for
one would demand some changes.
Universities have long been over due in
responding to rumors which Agnew and others like
him, use to spread the fears of middle America.
Failing to respond to theirmore ludicrous accusations
with facts, only serves to help them cause disparity
among us, to polarize, rather than to unite us.
In an age when policemen are wiring phones,
searching pedestrians, and making gestapo raids, all
with the consent of the majority of Americans, I
guess I should not expect a response on the part of
the university. In an age when one judge can make a
mockery out of the American judicial system, and
convict seven men for expressing their opinions, all
with the consent of the majority of Americans, I
should not expect a response. In an age when the
majority consents to let a few ruin the quality of
our environment, kill whom they please, and wage
an unconstitutional, immoral, war; in this age of
'benign neglect' I guess I should not be surprised
over the lack of a response.

and an ASSU Senator.)
As a Black man, as a Black American, as a Black
student attending one of my country's best known
institutions of higher learning, I am at once incensed
and disturbed at its lack of social consciousness. The
weak, or perhaps to put it more accurately, lack of
response on the part of this university and other
institutions like it to recent statements by Vice
President Agnew concerning its academic
credibility, is no less than a form of social
irresponsibility.
At a recent hundred-dollar blue plate dinner,
held within the feudal realm of America's most
benevolent despot, Mayor Daley, the Vice President
made known his views concerning minority
admission programs. In no uncertain terms, he
warned the group of business leaders, that such
admission policies have a 'pernicious result' on the
quality of education received by students admitted
under these programs.
The practice has a 'pernicious result' Agnew
warned of creating a vested interest in seeing that
those admitted this way succeed. The same
pressures which operated to bring about the
favored admissions status of those admitted
because of race, socio-economic class, or ethnic
background continue to operate in favor of their
successful completion of studies undertaken.
Why hasn't Stanford which developed a minority
program responded to Agnew's accusations? Why
hasn't Stanford asked for the empirical data upon
which he has based his statements? Why hasn't
Stanford and others made it clear that they grant
one degree, and one degree only upon their
graduates, and cleared the air of doubt?
Disparate Kducation?
Or am I to believe that in fact there is a disparate
system of education at Stanford? That in fact,
Stanford has a segragated educational system, in its
own subtle way, just as racist as those in the South.
And on graduation day there really are two degrees
which this university confers upon its graduates; one
representing incompetence, mediocrity, the other
academic competence The first stamped minority
and the other stamped quality by the wider, whiter,
