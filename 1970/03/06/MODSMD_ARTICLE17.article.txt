# On American Violence
## 
### Bertrand Russell 
Violence is not. new to America. White men
of European stock seized the lands of
indigenous Indians with a ferocity which
endured until our own times. The institution
of slavery shaped the character of the nation
and leaves its mark everywhere today.
Countless "local" wars were mounted
throughout the Twentieth Century to protect
commercial interests abroad. Finally, the
United States emerged at Hiroshima as the
arbiter of world affairs and self-appointed
policeman of the globe.
What is new in 1969 is that for the first
time many affluent Americans are learning a
very little of this disconcerting picture. The
revelations of atrocities by U.S. servicemen in
Viet-Nam illustrate not isolated acts
inadvertently committed by disciplined
troops, but the general pattern of the war, for
its character is genocidal. It has been fought
from the air with napalm and fragmentation
bombs, helicopter gunships and pellet bombs,
the spraying of poisons on thousands of acres
of crops and the use of enormous high
explosive seapons. Civilian areas have been
declared "free fire zones" and the policy has
been one of mechanical slaughter. On the
grounds, "search and destroy" missions have
used gas in lethal quantities, the killing of
prisoners, and systematic interrogation under
electrical and other tortures.
Senator Kennedy has released figures given
to him as chairman of the Senate refugees
subcommittee. He says that there have been
one million civilian casualties in South
Viet-Nam alone since 1965, of which 300,000
have been killed. In the London Times of

December 3, Washington correspondent Louis
Heren compares such slaughter to the Nazi
record in Eastern Europe: "These are terrible
figures, proportionally perhaps comparable to
the losses suffered by the Soviet Union in the
Second World War." Two days earlier, the
same newspaper's correspondent in Saigon,
Fred Emery, reported: "What begins as a
'firefight' in a hamlet continues compulsively
long after opposing fire has been suppressed.
With such appalling fire discipline among all
units in Viet-Nam, it is only exhaustion of
ammunition that brings engagements to an
end."
This is precisely the picture which emerged
from the sessions of the International War
Crimes Tribunal in Scandinavia in 1967. The
Tribunal heard from former U.S. servicemen
of the dropping of Vietnamese prisoners from
helicopters, the killing of prisoners under
torture and the shooting on orders of those
trying to be accepted as prisoners. All this and
much more was known years ago to anyone
concerned to learn the truth. It was certainly
known to tens of thousands of troops in
Viet-Nam. The London Times' Saigon
correspondent, describing the reactions to the
recent revelations of Americans in Viet-Nam,
commented: ". . .There is a strong
undercurrent of knowledge and fear that
'there, but for the grace of God, go I.'
This is why the prosecution of isolated
junior officers is quite inadequate. They are to
be made scapegoats. The more wirked war
criminals are the highest ranking military and
civilian leaders, the architects of the whole

genocidal policy. Have we so soon forgotten
the regular White House breakfasts at which,
Johnson boasted openly, he and McNamara
and their closest colleagues selected the
targets for the coming week?
This in turn is why it is ludicrous to suggest
that an enquiry should be mounted by anyone
associated with the government or armed
forces. The whole establishment stands
condemned, including those more moderate
politicians whose every utterance is still
dictated by caution and petty ambition.
Goldberg's call for a commission of
"concerned patriotic Americans" would be a
sublime irrelevance were it not the very means
whereby the full horror would be hidden.
Only a Pentagon enquiry could do worse.
Because I doubt whether any enquiry in the
United States would be free from the most
severe harassment, I have invited some 15
heads of state around the world to press the
U.N. Secretary General to establish an enquiry
into war crimes in Viet-Nam.
Several Americans newspapers have
observed that reaction to the massacre
revelations has been much more rapid and
sharp in Western Europe than in the United
States. This is highly alarming. The entire
American people are now on trial. If there is
not a massive moral revulsion at what is being
done in their names to the people of
Viet-Nam. there may be little hope for the
future of America. Having lost the will to
continue the slaughter is not enough, the
people of America must now repudiate their
civil .-nd military leaders.

record in Eastern Europe: "These are terrible
figures, proportionally perhaps comparable to
the losses suffered by the Soviet Union in the
Second World War." Two days earlier, the
same newspaper's correspondent in Saigon,
Fred Emery, reported: "What begins as a
'firefight' in a hamlet continues compulsively
long after opposing fire has been suppressed.
With such appalling fire discipline among all
units in Viet-Nam, it is only exhaustion of
ammunition that brings engagements to an
end."
This is precisely the picture which emerged
from the sessions of the International War
Crimes Tribunal in Scandinavia in 1967. The
Tribunal heard from former U.S. servicemen
of the dropping of Vietnamese prisoners from
helicopters, the killing of prisoners under
torture and the shooting on orders of those
trying to be accepted as prisoners. All this and
much more was known years ago to anyone
concerned to learn the truth. It was certainly
known to tens of thousands of troops in
Viet-Nam. The London Times' Saigon
correspondent, describing the reactions to the
recent revelations of Americans in Viet-Nam,
commented: ". . .There is a strong
undercurrent of knowledge and fear that
'there, but for the grace of God, go I.'
This is why the prosecution of isolated
junior officers is quite inadequate. They are to
be made scapegoats. The more wirked war
criminals are the highest ranking military and
civilian leaders, the architects of the whole

genocidal policy. Have we so soon forgotten
the regular White House breakfasts at which,
Johnson boasted openly, he and McNamara
and their closest colleagues selected the
targets for the coming week?
This in turn is why it is ludicrous to suggest
that an enquiry should be mounted by anyone
associated with the government or armed
forces. The whole establishment stands
condemned, including those more moderate
politicians whose every utterance is still
dictated by caution and petty ambition.
Goldberg's call for a commission of
"concerned patriotic Americans" would be a
sublime irrelevance were it not the very means
whereby the full horror would be hidden.
Only a Pentagon enquiry could do worse.
Because I doubt whether any enquiry in the
United States would be free from the most
severe harassment, I have invited some 15
heads of state around the world to press the
U.N. Secretary General to establish an enquiry
into war crimes in Viet-Nam.
Several Americans newspapers have
observed that reaction to the massacre
revelations has been much more rapid and
sharp in Western Europe than in the United
States. This is highly alarming. The entire
American people are now on trial. If there is
not a massive moral revulsion at what is being
done in their names to the people of
Viet-Nam. there may be little hope for the
future of America. Having lost the will to
continue the slaughter is not enough, the
people of America must now repudiate their
civil .-nd military leaders.
Violence is not. new to America. White men
of European stock seized the lands of
indigenous Indians with a ferocity which
endured until our own times. The institution
of slavery shaped the character of the nation
and leaves its mark everywhere today.
Countless "local" wars were mounted
throughout the Twentieth Century to protect
commercial interests abroad. Finally, the
United States emerged at Hiroshima as the
arbiter of world affairs and self-appointed
policeman of the globe.
What is new in 1969 is that for the first
time many affluent Americans are learning a
very little of this disconcerting picture. The
revelations of atrocities by U.S. servicemen in
Viet-Nam illustrate not isolated acts
inadvertently committed by disciplined
troops, but the general pattern of the war, for
its character is genocidal. It has been fought
from the air with napalm and fragmentation
bombs, helicopter gunships and pellet bombs,
the spraying of poisons on thousands of acres
of crops and the use of enormous high
explosive seapons. Civilian areas have been
declared "free fire zones" and the policy has
been one of mechanical slaughter. On the
grounds, "search and destroy" missions have
used gas in lethal quantities, the killing of
prisoners, and systematic interrogation under
electrical and other tortures.
Senator Kennedy has released figures given
to him as chairman of the Senate refugees
subcommittee. He says that there have been
one million civilian casualties in South
Viet-Nam alone since 1965, of which 300,000
have been killed. In the London Times of
