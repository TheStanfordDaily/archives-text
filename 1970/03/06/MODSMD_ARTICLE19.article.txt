# Misunderstandings Clarified
## Working For Betterment Of All Mexicans 
### 
The undersigned, by no means
wish any kind of confrontation
with the Mexican-American
community, but we feel
compelled to write this article in
response to the charges made by
Mr. Ted Martinez which appeared
in "The Chicanismo" (Feb. 13,
1960) in order to clarify some of
his misunderstandings.
The issue centers about the
Mexican Party recently held at the

I-Center by the Mexican students
at Stanford for the entire
Stanford community's enjoyment,
and not especially for "Yellows,
Purples, Browns, Blacks, Whites or
whatever for the purpose of
showing the gay Mexicans at
play," as Mr. Martinez states. He
is critical of the lack of aroma of
beans, the absence of a donkey,
sombrero, Pancho Villa symbols,
etc. He also criticizes the presence

of Mexicans and other Latin
American people and labels them
"aristocratic Latin Americans and
Creoles who claim to have pure
Spanish blood,"
Sir, Mexico (spelled with an
"x") 1970, is a country which is
developing in all aspects; a
country where the people don't
think of themselves as "Pink,
Blue, Brown, Green" but as
people who are working long and

hard for the betterment of all
Mexicans. Stop classifying people
by color; at least don't expect us
to accept your worn-out
classification.
The Mexican students at
Stanford are financially supported
in many different ways. Most of
them, at great sacrifices, have
scholarships from Mexican,
American, and other International
institutions. Some of them are
T.A.'s or research assistants and a
very, very small minority of them
are self-supported. When they
terminate their education at
Stanford they will return to
Mexico to help the poor of their
own ''Southwestern
communities."
Tequila
In closing, we wish to correct
other erroneous details. First, the
people who approached MECHA
for help toward the costs of the
party was the treasurer of the
International Association and not
a Mexican. Second, the films and

slides were obtained from the
Department of Tourism of Mexico
in San Francisco, and it didn't
bother us that a few Americans
were seen standing by the
pyramids and lying in the sunny
beaches of Acapulco (only one
"c").
The band was hired because of
their ability to produce rock,
samba, rumba, cha cha cha and
other such counds. We agree that
it was non-Mexican but we
question your understanding that
Mexican music is comprised of
only rancheras, jarabes, etc.
Finally, the punch didn't have any
tequila, it had Red Mountain wine
($ 1,49/ gal.), but if it tasted like
tequila, then the party was a
success!
