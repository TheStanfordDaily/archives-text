# Academic Senate Postpones Action On Council Expansion
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The faculty Senate yesterday
postponed action on a proposal to
expand membership of the
Academic Council and referred a
proposal for formation of a
University Committee on
Minority Affairs back to its
Committee on Committees.
Members discussed both issues
and probably will consider them
at the next meeting, after the
faculty has a chance to discuss the
proposals.
At the meeting, the Committee

on Committees announced the
appointment of David D. Perkins,
professor and acting chairman of
biology, to the Committee on
Libraries.
The proposal for increasing the
membership of the Academic
Council was released in
Wednesday's issue of CAMPUS
REPORT. It calls for expansion of
the membership by an estimated
161.
The projected increase from
the current Council membership
of 1015 would include: 116
full-time teachers, 34 research
personnel, five officers of
academic and student
administration, and six librarians.
Membership is now limited to
the President of the University,
professors, associate professors,
assistant professors, and six
academic administrative officers.
The new proposal would extend
the membership to: "1. Full-time
teachers, except that those with
annual appointments should
become members in the second
and subsequent years of such
appointments, and excluding

visiting teachers;
"2. Those individuals whose
duties are substantially academic
in nature, or who are responsible
for formulating academic policy
in academic areas, and whose
appointments are the result of
processes substantially equivalent
to those leading to professorial
appointments."
The ad hoc Senate Committee
on Memberships and Privileges
that made the report was
appointed last June 11.
The primary charge of the
committee was: "To review
established criteria for
membership in the Academic
Council and to review pending
recommendations for extension of
Academic Council
membership . . ."
According to CAMPUS
REPORT, if the recommendations
are approved by the faculty
Senate, they will be put into the
Articles of Organization of the
faculty and will be submitted to
President Kenneth S. Pitzer for
ratification by the Board of
Trustees.
