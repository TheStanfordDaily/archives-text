# Would You Believe?
## Problem Of The Year 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON-" And now,
ladies and gentlemen, in a few
minutes we shall have the moment
you have all been waiting for.
While our judges are marking their
ballots, we'd like to tell you a
little about this wonderful
contest.
"Each year the American
people, with the help of the news
media, decide which Problem they
will be the most concerned with
for the next 12 months. Last year,
if you remember, it was 'Crime in
the Streets.' The year before that
it was the 'Wars.' Past winners
have included 'Hunger,' 'Poverty,'
'Desegregation'and 'Cuba.'
"The Problem selected for
1970 will not only get to travel all
over the United States, but she
will appear on television, in the
newspapers, on radio and wind up
her whirlwind tour by meeting
with the President of the United
States in the White House in
Washington, D.C.
"You can feel the electricity
and excitement here as the
200,000 people in the audience
await the verdict. I don't believe
we havy ever had a more
outstanding group of problems to
choose from than the 1970 crop.
Let me list the finalists for you
again. 'Miss Inflation,' which has
certainly impressed everyone here
with her size and scope; 'Miss
School Busing,' considered by
many a sleeper, but which came
on strong, thanks to the speeches
against her by Spiro Agnew and
Sen. Stennis.
All the Political Misses
"Then there's 'Miss Stock
Market,' 'Miss Unemployment,'
'Miss Drug Scene,' 'Miss Pollution'
and 'Miss Generation Gap.'
"All of them have excellent
chances of being crowned
'America's Problem of 1970.'
"The judges still can't seem to
make up their minds, so let's talk
to some of thy former winners to
see how they fared after reigning
as America's Problem of the Year.
Here's 'Miss Poverty.' You were
Queen in 1964, weren't you?"

"I think so. 1 know it was an
election year. It was really a
wonderful experience. No one
talked about anything else but
poverty. They made
documentaries about me, wrote a
long series of articles in thy
newspapers; they even set up a
government department just for
me. It's something I'll always
remember."
"Tell me, Miss Poverty, what
happened when a new queen was
crowned?"
"I retired. That's part of the
contract. Once you're no longer
the Problem of the Year, you're
obligated not to make any more
public appearances. You have to
give another Problem a chance.
Besides, the American people get
sick of you, if you stay around
too long."
"Thank you, Miss Poverty.
Over here is 'Miss Vietnamese
War.' We haven't heard from you
in some time."
Glamour Is Gone
"I'm still here, though I'm
afraid I'm not the glamour
problem I used to be.
Occasionally I'm mentioned in the
papers or on television, but I must
say it isn't the same as it used to
be."
"We have time to address
ourselves to one more problem,
'Miss Desegregation,' How do you
feel when you see all these young
eager Problems vying for the
crown you once wore?"
"I envy them and their
innocence. I guess I'm washed up
now, but I'll always remember
that brief moment when everyone
sang 'Miss Desegregation—have
you ever seen a dream walking?' It
seems like only yesterday when I
could do no wrong."
"Thank you, Miss
Desegregation. We're sorry we
don't have any more time to
discuss your problem, but you
know how the American people
are. Well, I'm going over now to
pick up the white envelope which
will tell us what Problem will
reign supreme in 1970 ... I tear

off the top and .. . Are you
ready? .. . The Problem of the
Year is Pollution! Miss Pollution is
the new Queen. Let's hear it for
Pollution. Now all together, 'Here
she comes, Miss Pollution . .

see how they fared after reigning
as America's Problem of the Year.
Here's 'Miss Poverty.' You were
Queen in 1964, weren't you?"

"I think so. 1 know it was an
election year. It was really a
wonderful experience. No one
talked about anything else but
poverty. They made
documentaries about me, wrote a
long series of articles in thy
newspapers; they even set up a
government department just for
me. It's something I'll always
remember."
"Tell me, Miss Poverty, what
happened when a new queen was
crowned?"
"I retired. That's part of the
contract. Once you're no longer
the Problem of the Year, you're
obligated not to make any more
public appearances. You have to
give another Problem a chance.
Besides, the American people get
sick of you, if you stay around
too long."
"Thank you, Miss Poverty.
Over here is 'Miss Vietnamese
War.' We haven't heard from you
in some time."
Glamour Is Gone
"I'm still here, though I'm
afraid I'm not the glamour
problem I used to be.
Occasionally I'm mentioned in the
papers or on television, but I must
say it isn't the same as it used to
be."
"We have time to address
ourselves to one more problem,
'Miss Desegregation,' How do you
feel when you see all these young
eager Problems vying for the
crown you once wore?"
"I envy them and their
innocence. I guess I'm washed up
now, but I'll always remember
that brief moment when everyone
sang 'Miss Desegregation—have
you ever seen a dream walking?' It
seems like only yesterday when I
could do no wrong."
"Thank you, Miss
Desegregation. We're sorry we
don't have any more time to
discuss your problem, but you
know how the American people
are. Well, I'm going over now to
pick up the white envelope which
will tell us what Problem will
reign supreme in 1970 ... I tear

off the top and .. . Are you
ready? .. . The Problem of the
Year is Pollution! Miss Pollution is
the new Queen. Let's hear it for
Pollution. Now all together, 'Here
she comes, Miss Pollution . .
WASHINGTON-" And now,
ladies and gentlemen, in a few
minutes we shall have the moment
you have all been waiting for.
While our judges are marking their
ballots, we'd like to tell you a
little about this wonderful
contest.
"Each year the American
people, with the help of the news
media, decide which Problem they
will be the most concerned with
for the next 12 months. Last year,
if you remember, it was 'Crime in
the Streets.' The year before that
it was the 'Wars.' Past winners
have included 'Hunger,' 'Poverty,'
'Desegregation'and 'Cuba.'
"The Problem selected for
1970 will not only get to travel all
over the United States, but she
will appear on television, in the
newspapers, on radio and wind up
her whirlwind tour by meeting
with the President of the United
States in the White House in
Washington, D.C.
"You can feel the electricity
and excitement here as the
200,000 people in the audience
await the verdict. I don't believe
we havy ever had a more
outstanding group of problems to
choose from than the 1970 crop.
Let me list the finalists for you
again. 'Miss Inflation,' which has
certainly impressed everyone here
with her size and scope; 'Miss
School Busing,' considered by
many a sleeper, but which came
on strong, thanks to the speeches
against her by Spiro Agnew and
Sen. Stennis.
All the Political Misses
"Then there's 'Miss Stock
Market,' 'Miss Unemployment,'
'Miss Drug Scene,' 'Miss Pollution'
and 'Miss Generation Gap.'
"All of them have excellent
chances of being crowned
'America's Problem of 1970.'
"The judges still can't seem to
make up their minds, so let's talk
to some of thy former winners to
see how they fared after reigning
as America's Problem of the Year.
