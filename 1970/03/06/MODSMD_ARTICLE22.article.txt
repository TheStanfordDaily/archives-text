A Humanistic Context
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your account of the recent
Academic Council Debate on
ROTC, you say that I "defended
the humanistic element ROTC
injects into the military." Such a
view was, I believe, attributed to
me by another speaker, but it is
not exactly what I said. My claim
was that if ROTC is excluded
systematically from college
campuses, the practical result
might well be the creation of new
service academies for training
military officers, and that such
service academies would be
wholly free from non-militaristic
influences. What is "humanistic"
in my view, is not ROTC, as
such, but the University context
in which ROTC occurs.
You report correctly that I
rejected the view that approval of
the latest ROTC proposal
constitutes endorsement of the
Vietnam war. I would note, first,
that it was the CIVILIAN policy
makers who got us into and are
continuing this war. Second, those
who claim that the only issue now
relevant to ROTC is the Vietnam
war seem to be saying that
whether ROTC should be on
campus depends at any given
moment on the state of popular
approval or disapproval of the
military at that particular time. I
do not think a shifting policy of
this sort would be either sound or
practicable.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Now that the ROTC issues are
before the entire Academic
Council, I feel free to state my
intention to vote for restoring the
Senate's policies of 1969
regarding credit for ROTC
courses.
The issues are not crystal clear.
I think the 1969 action forbids
REGULAR credit for military
instruction at Stanford and seems
to leave open the possibility of
special accreditation of certain
students' military studies without
prejudging the right of ROTC
instructors to sue for such credit.
I think the 1970 action would
specify one particular channel by
which ROTC instructors mav seek

credit for certain courses, while
also establishing a formal,
contractual relat'on between
Stanford and ROTC. The earlier
policy is subject to interpretation,
to be sure, but is unequivocal. The
later one, in my opinion, contains
an inner contradiction in that it
would make ROTC an integral
part of the university, entitle it to
a particular way of seeking credit,
and then instruct the appropriate
committee to ignore its special
relation to the university.
Most emphatically I believe
that this one is a close call.
Neither choice would tame the
military monster (in whose
existence I believe); neither would
establish the academic chastity of
Stanford. I find absolutely no
more moral virtue in the vote I
intend to cast than I find in voting
the other way.
And since it is such a close call,
the "devil theory" compounded
by Mr. Freivogel in your pages on
March 4 causes profound chagrin
on my part. Mr. Brooks indeed
wore several hats during the
ROTC negotiations; so did I. If
you are to pluck fragments from
Mr. Pitzer's statement to paint
him a chameleon on a tight
presidential leash, you surely
could find quotes that would
color me the yellow hypocrite for
posing an arch neutrality while
procedurally helping the Senate to
reach its recent decision and then
stating my inclination to rescind
that very decision. Mr. Brooks and
I disagree rather thoroughly on
the substantive matters. Yet I
know of no person who has
worked harder as a citizen to
persuade the Department of
Defense to remove itself from the
curricula of higher education than
Mr. Brooks. As a member of the
ad hoc (Connolly) Senate
committee on ROTC he exercised,
to my certain knowledge, his keen
judgment as an educator by
signing the minority report. When
the Senate took its 1969 action,
Mr. Brooks the able and loyal
administrator negotiated an Army
proposal as much as possible in
line with the Senate's preferences.
As a member of the Senate he
properly exercised his own
independent judgment, keeping in
mind the constituency he
represents. I trust that the
increased public exposure of Mr.

Brooks fci ought about by your
story will enable many persons in
this community to learn the art
that he practices consummately
well, namely the changing of hats
without changing feces.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Last year this body decided to
continue ROTC on a
non-academic basis. If that
decision had proved acceptable to
forces outside this body, we
would not be here today. No
change in the rules would have
been needed for individual ROTC
courses to receive academic credit
on their own merit. The issue has
been forced because ROTC claims
a recognized academic position
here.
We cannot lightly reject the
claim to preserve a civilian basis
for our military institutions. This
claim has deep historic roots in
the revolutionary principle which
gave birth to our nation—that our
government and our armed forces
must be the servant and not the
master of the people. I wish it
were possible for me to believe
that our military institutions still
honorably serve the interests of
our people and of mankind.
The bitter truth is that these
institutions are responsible,
directly or indirectly, for close to
a million deaths of an "alien
population of distinct ethnic
character," which comes
perilously close to genocide. Into
one small corner of the globe we
have poured more bombs than
were dropped by all combatants
during World War 11. There we
train our citizen-soldiers to
destroy anything which might
contain human life, contrary to
laws of warfare we had recognized
for centuries.
There is little reason to believe
that we have chosen this course
deliberately. Yet if we look at the
RESULTS of our actions, it
becomes easy to compare this
violent destruction of human life
to actions we have all condemned.
A few years ago, it would have
been easy to find a majority of
this body who believed that
patriotic Germans should have
stopped cooperating with the SS

by the time they knew a million
Jews had been exterminated, if
not before. I beseach you to
recognize the fact that, whatever
our intentions, continued
cooperation with our military
institutions is associating us with
similar results. We have a choice
to refuse that cooperation here by
refusing to allow ROTC an official
place in our institution.

Just 2 Points
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two important points seem to
have been overlooked in the
current ROTC debate.
The first is that a year ago very
great pains were taken by the
opponents of ROTC to assure
everyone that the program was
being evaluated entirely on its
academic merits, independent of
the Vietnam war (perish the
thought). This year, the
opponents have reversed
themselves; now that the
academic objections to ROTC
have been removed, they are
telling the faculty to forget those
considerations and look upon
ROTC solely as a direct extension
of the war.
Secondly, the opponents are
quick to urge everyone else to
heed "the wishes of the people,"
while they themselves feel free to

ignore those wishes if it best
serves their purposes. Last Spring,
for example, the radicals were
incensed because "the Trustees
ignored the vote of the students"
in the SRI issue (it turned out
that the Trustees had to consider
the preferences of 3000
employees at SRI, as well). But
there was also another vote at that
time, in which students clearly
asked that ROTC be retained with
credit. No mention of that has
been made this year by those who
insist that they represent the true
wishes of the community.

military officers, and that such
service academies would be
wholly free from non-militaristic
influences. What is "humanistic"
in my view, is not ROTC, as
such, but the University context
in which ROTC occurs.
You report correctly that I
rejected the view that approval of
the latest ROTC proposal
constitutes endorsement of the
Vietnam war. I would note, first,
that it was the CIVILIAN policy
makers who got us into and are
continuing this war. Second, those
who claim that the only issue now
relevant to ROTC is the Vietnam
war seem to be saying that
whether ROTC should be on
campus depends at any given
moment on the state of popular
approval or disapproval of the
military at that particular time. I
do not think a shifting policy of
this sort would be either sound or
practicable.

Now that the ROTC issues are
before the entire Academic
Council, I feel free to state my
intention to vote for restoring the
Senate's policies of 1969
regarding credit for ROTC
courses.
The issues are not crystal clear.
I think the 1969 action forbids
REGULAR credit for military
instruction at Stanford and seems
to leave open the possibility of
special accreditation of certain
students' military studies without
prejudging the right of ROTC
instructors to sue for such credit.
I think the 1970 action would
specify one particular channel by
which ROTC instructors mav seek

credit for certain courses, while
also establishing a formal,
contractual relat'on between
Stanford and ROTC. The earlier
policy is subject to interpretation,
to be sure, but is unequivocal. The
later one, in my opinion, contains
an inner contradiction in that it
would make ROTC an integral
part of the university, entitle it to
a particular way of seeking credit,
and then instruct the appropriate
committee to ignore its special
relation to the university.
Most emphatically I believe
that this one is a close call.
Neither choice would tame the
military monster (in whose
existence I believe); neither would
establish the academic chastity of
Stanford. I find absolutely no
more moral virtue in the vote I
intend to cast than I find in voting
the other way.
And since it is such a close call,
the "devil theory" compounded
by Mr. Freivogel in your pages on
March 4 causes profound chagrin
on my part. Mr. Brooks indeed
wore several hats during the
ROTC negotiations; so did I. If
you are to pluck fragments from
Mr. Pitzer's statement to paint
him a chameleon on a tight
presidential leash, you surely
could find quotes that would
color me the yellow hypocrite for
posing an arch neutrality while
procedurally helping the Senate to
reach its recent decision and then
stating my inclination to rescind
that very decision. Mr. Brooks and
I disagree rather thoroughly on
the substantive matters. Yet I
know of no person who has
worked harder as a citizen to
persuade the Department of
Defense to remove itself from the
curricula of higher education than
Mr. Brooks. As a member of the
ad hoc (Connolly) Senate
committee on ROTC he exercised,
to my certain knowledge, his keen
judgment as an educator by
signing the minority report. When
the Senate took its 1969 action,
Mr. Brooks the able and loyal
administrator negotiated an Army
proposal as much as possible in
line with the Senate's preferences.
As a member of the Senate he
properly exercised his own
independent judgment, keeping in
mind the constituency he
represents. I trust that the
increased public exposure of Mr.

Brooks fci ought about by your
story will enable many persons in
this community to learn the art
that he practices consummately
well, namely the changing of hats
without changing feces.

Last year this body decided to
continue ROTC on a
non-academic basis. If that
decision had proved acceptable to
forces outside this body, we
would not be here today. No
change in the rules would have
been needed for individual ROTC
courses to receive academic credit
on their own merit. The issue has
been forced because ROTC claims
a recognized academic position
here.
We cannot lightly reject the
claim to preserve a civilian basis
for our military institutions. This
claim has deep historic roots in
the revolutionary principle which
gave birth to our nation—that our
government and our armed forces
must be the servant and not the
master of the people. I wish it
were possible for me to believe
that our military institutions still
honorably serve the interests of
our people and of mankind.
The bitter truth is that these
institutions are responsible,
directly or indirectly, for close to
a million deaths of an "alien
population of distinct ethnic
character," which comes
perilously close to genocide. Into
one small corner of the globe we
have poured more bombs than
were dropped by all combatants
during World War 11. There we
train our citizen-soldiers to
destroy anything which might
contain human life, contrary to
laws of warfare we had recognized
for centuries.
There is little reason to believe
that we have chosen this course
deliberately. Yet if we look at the
RESULTS of our actions, it
becomes easy to compare this
violent destruction of human life
to actions we have all condemned.
A few years ago, it would have
been easy to find a majority of
this body who believed that
patriotic Germans should have
stopped cooperating with the SS

by the time they knew a million
Jews had been exterminated, if
not before. I beseach you to
recognize the fact that, whatever
our intentions, continued
cooperation with our military
institutions is associating us with
similar results. We have a choice
to refuse that cooperation here by
refusing to allow ROTC an official
place in our institution.

Just 2 Points
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two important points seem to
have been overlooked in the
current ROTC debate.
The first is that a year ago very
great pains were taken by the
opponents of ROTC to assure
everyone that the program was
being evaluated entirely on its
academic merits, independent of
the Vietnam war (perish the
thought). This year, the
opponents have reversed
themselves; now that the
academic objections to ROTC
have been removed, they are
telling the faculty to forget those
considerations and look upon
ROTC solely as a direct extension
of the war.
Secondly, the opponents are
quick to urge everyone else to
heed "the wishes of the people,"
while they themselves feel free to

ignore those wishes if it best
serves their purposes. Last Spring,
for example, the radicals were
incensed because "the Trustees
ignored the vote of the students"
in the SRI issue (it turned out
that the Trustees had to consider
the preferences of 3000
employees at SRI, as well). But
there was also another vote at that
time, in which students clearly
asked that ROTC be retained with
credit. No mention of that has
been made this year by those who

Editor, THE DAILY:
Now that the ROTC issues are
before the entire Academic
Council, I feel free to state my
intention to vote for restoring the
Senate's policies of 1969
regarding credit for ROTC
courses.
The issues are not crystal clear.
I think the 1969 action forbids
REGULAR credit for military
instruction at Stanford and seems
to leave open the possibility of
special accreditation of certain
students' military studies without
prejudging the right of ROTC
instructors to sue for such credit.
I think the 1970 action would
specify one particular channel by
which ROTC instructors mav seek

credit for certain courses, while
also establishing a formal,
contractual relat'on between
Stanford and ROTC. The earlier
policy is subject to interpretation,
to be sure, but is unequivocal. The
later one, in my opinion, contains
an inner contradiction in that it
would make ROTC an integral
part of the university, entitle it to
a particular way of seeking credit,
and then instruct the appropriate
committee to ignore its special
relation to the university.
Most emphatically I believe
that this one is a close call.
Neither choice would tame the
military monster (in whose
existence I believe); neither would
establish the academic chastity of
Stanford. I find absolutely no
more moral virtue in the vote I
intend to cast than I find in voting
the other way.
And since it is such a close call,
the "devil theory" compounded
by Mr. Freivogel in your pages on
March 4 causes profound chagrin
on my part. Mr. Brooks indeed
wore several hats during the
ROTC negotiations; so did I. If
you are to pluck fragments from
Mr. Pitzer's statement to paint
him a chameleon on a tight
presidential leash, you surely
could find quotes that would
color me the yellow hypocrite for
posing an arch neutrality while
procedurally helping the Senate to
reach its recent decision and then
stating my inclination to rescind
that very decision. Mr. Brooks and
I disagree rather thoroughly on
the substantive matters. Yet I
know of no person who has
worked harder as a citizen to
persuade the Department of
Defense to remove itself from the
curricula of higher education than
Mr. Brooks. As a member of the
ad hoc (Connolly) Senate
committee on ROTC he exercised,
to my certain knowledge, his keen
judgment as an educator by
signing the minority report. When
the Senate took its 1969 action,
Mr. Brooks the able and loyal
administrator negotiated an Army
proposal as much as possible in
line with the Senate's preferences.
As a member of the Senate he
properly exercised his own
independent judgment, keeping in
mind the constituency he
represents. I trust that the
increased public exposure of Mr.

Brooks fci ought about by your
story will enable many persons in
this community to learn the art
that he practices consummately
well, namely the changing of hats
without changing feces.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Last year this body decided to
continue ROTC on a
non-academic basis. If that
decision had proved acceptable to
forces outside this body, we
would not be here today. No
change in the rules would have
been needed for individual ROTC
courses to receive academic credit
on their own merit. The issue has
been forced because ROTC claims
a recognized academic position
here.
We cannot lightly reject the
claim to preserve a civilian basis
for our military institutions. This
claim has deep historic roots in
the revolutionary principle which
gave birth to our nation—that our
government and our armed forces
must be the servant and not the
master of the people. I wish it
were possible for me to believe
that our military institutions still
honorably serve the interests of
our people and of mankind.
The bitter truth is that these
institutions are responsible,
directly or indirectly, for close to
a million deaths of an "alien
population of distinct ethnic
character," which comes
perilously close to genocide. Into
one small corner of the globe we
have poured more bombs than
were dropped by all combatants
during World War 11. There we
train our citizen-soldiers to
destroy anything which might
contain human life, contrary to
laws of warfare we had recognized
for centuries.
There is little reason to believe
that we have chosen this course
deliberately. Yet if we look at the
RESULTS of our actions, it
becomes easy to compare this
violent destruction of human life
to actions we have all condemned.
A few years ago, it would have
been easy to find a majority of
this body who believed that
patriotic Germans should have
stopped cooperating with the SS

by the time they knew a million
Jews had been exterminated, if
not before. I beseach you to
recognize the fact that, whatever
our intentions, continued
cooperation with our military
institutions is associating us with
similar results. We have a choice
to refuse that cooperation here by
refusing to allow ROTC an official
place in our institution.

Just 2 Points
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two important points seem to
have been overlooked in the
current ROTC debate.
The first is that a year ago very
great pains were taken by the
opponents of ROTC to assure
everyone that the program was
being evaluated entirely on its
academic merits, independent of
the Vietnam war (perish the
thought). This year, the
opponents have reversed
themselves; now that the
academic objections to ROTC
have been removed, they are
telling the faculty to forget those
considerations and look upon
ROTC solely as a direct extension
of the war.
Secondly, the opponents are
quick to urge everyone else to
heed "the wishes of the people,"
while they themselves feel free to

ignore those wishes if it best
serves their purposes. Last Spring,
for example, the radicals were
incensed because "the Trustees
ignored the vote of the students"
in the SRI issue (it turned out
that the Trustees had to consider
the preferences of 3000
employees at SRI, as well). But
there was also another vote at that
time, in which students clearly
asked that ROTC be retained with
credit. No mention of that has
been made this year by those who
insist that they represent the true

A Humanistic Context
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your account of the recent
Academic Council Debate on
ROTC, you say that I "defended
the humanistic element ROTC
injects into the military." Such a
view was, I believe, attributed to
me by another speaker, but it is
not exactly what I said. My claim
was that if ROTC is excluded
systematically from college
campuses, the practical result
might well be the creation of new
service academies for training
military officers, and that such
service academies would be
wholly free from non-militaristic
influences. What is "humanistic"
in my view, is not ROTC, as
such, but the University context
in which ROTC occurs.
You report correctly that I
rejected the view that approval of
the latest ROTC proposal
constitutes endorsement of the
Vietnam war. I would note, first,
that it was the CIVILIAN policy
makers who got us into and are
continuing this war. Second, those
who claim that the only issue now

Now that the ROTC issues are
before the entire Academic
Council, I feel free to state my
intention to vote for restoring the
Senate's policies of 1969
regarding credit for ROTC
courses.
The issues are not crystal clear.
I think the 1969 action forbids
REGULAR credit for military
instruction at Stanford and seems
to leave open the possibility of
special accreditation of certain
students' military studies without
prejudging the right of ROTC
instructors to sue for such credit.
I think the 1970 action would
specify one particular channel by
which ROTC instructors mav seek

credit for certain courses, while
also establishing a formal,
contractual relat'on between
Stanford and ROTC. The earlier
policy is subject to interpretation,
to be sure, but is unequivocal. The
later one, in my opinion, contains
an inner contradiction in that it
would make ROTC an integral
part of the university, entitle it to
a particular way of seeking credit,
and then instruct the appropriate
committee to ignore its special
relation to the university.
Most emphatically I believe
that this one is a close call.
Neither choice would tame the
military monster (in whose
existence I believe); neither would
establish the academic chastity of
Stanford. I find absolutely no
more moral virtue in the vote I
intend to cast than I find in voting
the other way.
And since it is such a close call,
the "devil theory" compounded
by Mr. Freivogel in your pages on
March 4 causes profound chagrin
on my part. Mr. Brooks indeed
wore several hats during the
ROTC negotiations; so did I. If
you are to pluck fragments from
Mr. Pitzer's statement to paint
him a chameleon on a tight
presidential leash, you surely
could find quotes that would
color me the yellow hypocrite for
posing an arch neutrality while
procedurally helping the Senate to
reach its recent decision and then
stating my inclination to rescind
that very decision. Mr. Brooks and
I disagree rather thoroughly on
the substantive matters. Yet I
know of no person who has
worked harder as a citizen to
persuade the Department of
Defense to remove itself from the
curricula of higher education than
Mr. Brooks. As a member of the
ad hoc (Connolly) Senate
committee on ROTC he exercised,
to my certain knowledge, his keen
judgment as an educator by
signing the minority report. When
the Senate took its 1969 action,
Mr. Brooks the able and loyal
administrator negotiated an Army
proposal as much as possible in
line with the Senate's preferences.
As a member of the Senate he
properly exercised his own
independent judgment, keeping in
mind the constituency he
represents. I trust that the
increased public exposure of Mr.

Brooks fci ought about by your
story will enable many persons in
this community to learn the art
that he practices consummately
well, namely the changing of hats
without changing feces.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Last year this body decided to
continue ROTC on a
non-academic basis. If that
decision had proved acceptable to
forces outside this body, we
would not be here today. No
change in the rules would have
been needed for individual ROTC
courses to receive academic credit
on their own merit. The issue has
been forced because ROTC claims
a recognized academic position
here.
We cannot lightly reject the
claim to preserve a civilian basis
for our military institutions. This
claim has deep historic roots in
the revolutionary principle which
gave birth to our nation—that our
government and our armed forces
must be the servant and not the
master of the people. I wish it
were possible for me to believe
that our military institutions still
honorably serve the interests of
our people and of mankind.
The bitter truth is that these
institutions are responsible,
directly or indirectly, for close to
a million deaths of an "alien
population of distinct ethnic
character," which comes
perilously close to genocide. Into
one small corner of the globe we
have poured more bombs than
were dropped by all combatants
during World War 11. There we
train our citizen-soldiers to
destroy anything which might
contain human life, contrary to
laws of warfare we had recognized
for centuries.
There is little reason to believe
that we have chosen this course
deliberately. Yet if we look at the
RESULTS of our actions, it
becomes easy to compare this
violent destruction of human life
to actions we have all condemned.
A few years ago, it would have
been easy to find a majority of
this body who believed that
patriotic Germans should have
stopped cooperating with the SS

by the time they knew a million
Jews had been exterminated, if
not before. I beseach you to
recognize the fact that, whatever
our intentions, continued
cooperation with our military
institutions is associating us with
similar results. We have a choice
to refuse that cooperation here by
refusing to allow ROTC an official
place in our institution.

Just 2 Points
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two important points seem to
have been overlooked in the
current ROTC debate.
The first is that a year ago very
great pains were taken by the
opponents of ROTC to assure
everyone that the program was
being evaluated entirely on its
academic merits, independent of
the Vietnam war (perish the
thought). This year, the
opponents have reversed
themselves; now that the
academic objections to ROTC
have been removed, they are
telling the faculty to forget those
considerations and look upon
ROTC solely as a direct extension
of the war.
Secondly, the opponents are
quick to urge everyone else to
heed "the wishes of the people,"
while they themselves feel free to

ignore those wishes if it best
serves their purposes. Last Spring,
for example, the radicals were
incensed because "the Trustees
ignored the vote of the students"
in the SRI issue (it turned out
that the Trustees had to consider
the preferences of 3000
employees at SRI, as well). But
there was also another vote at that
time, in which students clearly
asked that ROTC be retained with
credit. No mention of that has
been made this year by those who
insist that they represent the true
wishes of the community.

A Humanistic Context
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your account of the recent
Academic Council Debate on
ROTC, you say that I "defended
the humanistic element ROTC
injects into the military." Such a
view was, I believe, attributed to
me by another speaker, but it is
not exactly what I said. My claim
was that if ROTC is excluded
systematically from college
campuses, the practical result
might well be the creation of new
service academies for training
military officers, and that such
service academies would be
wholly free from non-militaristic
influences. What is "humanistic"
in my view, is not ROTC, as
such, but the University context
in which ROTC occurs.
You report correctly that I
rejected the view that approval of
the latest ROTC proposal
constitutes endorsement of the
Vietnam war. I would note, first,
that it was the CIVILIAN policy
makers who got us into and are
continuing this war. Second, those
who claim that the only issue now
relevant to ROTC is the Vietnam
war seem to be saying that
whether ROTC should be on
campus depends at any given
moment on the state of popular
approval or disapproval of the
military at that particular time. I
do not think a shifting policy of
this sort would be either sound or
practicable.
