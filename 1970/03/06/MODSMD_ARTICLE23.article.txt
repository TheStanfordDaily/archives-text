# VIOLENCE IN AMERICA
## One Company's Position 
### 
I sla vista, California, population 1 1,250.
The business district consists of a couple of gas
stations, a few small shops, some real estate offices—
and a bank. A large campus of the University of
California is nearby. All in all, a normal American
suburban community—perhaps very much like the one you
live or work in. Normal, that is, until Wednesday, February 25,
when violence shattered the peaceful calm of Isla Vista.
At about 8:30 p.m. on the night of February 25,
rampaging demonstrators—students and non-students—
protesting the "capitalist establishment" converged on the
community's small business district.
Several protesters rolled a gasoline-soaked trash bin
through a smashed front door in a Bank of America branch
and set it ablaze. Other students extinguished the fire. But
just before midnight, with the angry crowd in a frenzy,
the branch was set ablaze again. While police and fire officials
were held at bay by a rock-throwing mob, the bank was
gutted by fire and totally destroyed. A police patrol car was
overturned and burned. Numerous other fires were started.
Windows were smashed and life and property threatened.
These events took place in a community called
Isla Vista. They could have happened in your community.
They can happen anywhere and with even more
disastrous results.
Why did the eruption in Isla Vista take place?
Participants in the violence say it was a protest
against the "capitalist establishment," "the war in Vietnam,"
"the Chicago trial," "student repression," "police brutality,"
and a list of other grievances against America in 1970.
Some of these grievances are real, some are fanciful and
others are false. But all deserve to be aired. To the degree
that they are not aired,-are not taken seriously, Americans
break faith with their young.
But all Americans, young and old, liberal and
conservative, lose by violence. Violence and destruction are
the seeds of anarchy and tyranny—whether it be the tyranny
of the extreme right or the extreme left.
We believe the time has come for Americans to unite
in one cause: a rejection, total and complete, of violence
as a means of political dissent.

All of us, young or old, liberal or conservative,
have for too long been silent on the issue of violence.
We have been afraid of labels or slogans that would brand
us as either arch conservatives or traitors to a liberal cause.
Such sloganeering does all of us a grave injustice.
Let us, as a nation, find once again our ability to
distinguish between protest and revolt; between dissent and
chaos; between demonstration and destruction; between
non-violence and violence.
Let us cease to condemn those who disagree with us,
but let us also be prompt and resolute in putting an end to
violence in our land.
To this end we applaud the courageous response
of many dedicated public officials. They deserve the
cooperation of all citizens. They will have ours.
Every American has a right to walk the streets in
safety. No polemic should be allowed to obscure this right.
Your wife or husband, son or daughter ought to be safe
in visiting a supermarket, a filling station or a bank —
regardless of whether another may choose to reject that
institution as an onerous symbol.
It is for these reasons that we plan to re-open our
Isla Vista branch on Monday, March 9. We realize that there
is danger in this course of action. But we believe the greater
danger to ourselves and to all of the people in this nation
is to be intimidated by mob violence. We refuse to be so
intimidated.
Is the branch worth this much? In monetary terms,
the answer is no. It is not, and never has been particularly
profitable. But it is there to serve the banking needs of the
community and we refuse to be driven out of any community
by a violent few.
Is this a bad business decision? Perhaps in a narrow
sense it is. But we believe that at some time and in some
place Americans must decide whether they intend to have
their decisions, indeed their lives, ruled by a violent minority.
We are but one bank, but we have decided to take
our stand in Isla Vista.
