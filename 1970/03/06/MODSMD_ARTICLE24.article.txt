# Reports Released
## Suggested Reductions 
### DAVE BRENNER 
Sharp slashes in phone and
maid service, coupled with
moderate room and board rate
increases were the main thrusts of
the official "Report of the
Committee on Room and Board
Rates."
The committee was formed to
recommend measures to cut the
estimated $449,000 deficit for
1969-70 budgets of the residences
and food service. The committee
found rate increases were too
small to completely eliminate the
program Previously announced
tuition hikes combined with a
drastic increase in the cost of
living would have placed unfair
monetary burdens on students
and the financial aids office.
The report stated, "The
committee, then, recommends
that the annual room and board
rate be increased from $1140 to
$1210 for 1970-71, and that it be
accompanied by the cuts in
services." It is recommended that
the room rate rise from $480 to
$500 and the board rate rise from
$660 to $710.
"The recommendation for a
larger increase in the board rate is
based on (1) the greater cost base
of the food service, (2) the much
greater impact on the residences
than on the food service of the
cutbacks recommended by the
committee, and (3) the greater
increase needed to offset the cost
of unlimited servings and optional
mean plans," the report
commented.
Rate Comparisons
The statement emphasized
that, unpopular as the price
increases will be, they cannot be
postponed indefinitely. For a
point of reference, room and
board fees from other prominent
universities were included.
"Stanford's current $1140 rate
compares with $1300 at Harvard,
$1 270 at MIT and Chicago, $1250
at Yale, $1200 at Cornell, $1160
at Princeton, $1140 at USC,
$1100 at Cal Tech, and $1080 at
Berkeley."
Even with the proposed six
percent raise, the committee
forsees the need for a 12 percent
hike in 1971-72. That need is
unlikely to be met because of the
financial limitations of the
University. The cost increases are
so large because the present rates

were established in 1966.
Losses, I in pro vein en t
Several factors have combined
to increase operating costs
drastically since that time. Salaries
and staff benefits have risen 14
percent in the one year period of
1968-69 to 1969-70. Foodservice
losses resulting from the new
unlimited entrees and the
no-breakfast option produces a
$166,000 loss. Unauthorized use
of meal tickets and various forms
of free-loading have resulted in
approximately $30,000 worth of
unpaid-for food.
Almost 2 million dollars will be
needed for major repairs and
improvements over the next five
years. Stanford must necessarily
pay more for these additions
because construction costs in the
Bay Area are substantially greater
than for most other areas of the
country.
What all this means to students
is that next year private phones
will be more common in dorms
because the present switchboard
system will be cut severely. The
actual increase in cost to
individual residents will be small
and could actually result in a net
saving if people choose to rely on
the skeleton switchboard and not
buy private phones.
Rate Redistribution
Students will also be
responsible for cleaning their own
rooms with supplies provided by

the University. This reduction in
maid service will result in a net
annual savings for 1970-71 of
$88,000.
Finally, the committee
recommended that the quarterly
room and board rates be based on
the number of days in each
quarter and that the present
uniform quarterly room and
board rate be dropped. The report
commented on this rate raise.
"This rate redistribution should
not be regarded as a maneuver to
exploit residents, but rather as an
overdue adjustment of quarterly
rates to actual quarterly
expenditures."
The committee was formed on
the initiation of the Dean of
Students and the Business
Manager to assist them in
developing room and board rates
for 1970-71. Student members
included Lorrie Apt and Mike
Boyle, residents of Twain, Jim
Gimian and John Grube—off-cam
pus residents, Roger Johnson-
Manzanita Park, and Jim
Kilgore—Roble.
Staff members were: Mel
Brown, Auxiliary Accounting
Manager, Peter Bulkeley, Dean of
Students; Alan Cummings, Mgr. of
Residences and Fraternities; Bill
Myers, Food Service Mgr.; Ed
Scoles, Asst. Business Mgr. for
University Housing; and Dan
Williams, Asst. Dean of
Students.
