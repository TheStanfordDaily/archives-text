# Harvard Searches For New President
## 
### 
The Harvard Corporation
Tuesday issued a semi-public
appeal for nominees to succeed
Dr. Nathan M. Pusey, the
university's president. The appeal
marks the first time since its
founding in 1636 that Harvard has
looked beyond private sources in
a search for a president.
Last fall, a similar appeal was
made to alumni and others for
nominees to fill two vacancies
among the Fellows of Harvard
College, a self-perpetuating body
that comprises the corporation.
Dr. Pusey, who was elected in
June, 1953, is retiring in June,
1971. He told the fellows, of

whose board he is an ex-officio
member, that while he expects to
suggest some names, he will not
take part in the deliberations.
In a formal statement, the
fellows said that they intended to
"structure the search so as to
provide for consideration of all
views that may be expressed by
individuals or groups.
Letters of invitation to join the
search will be sent to all members
of the faculty, past and present
members of the Board of
Overseers, the senior governing
body, alumni officers, students,
"and others."
