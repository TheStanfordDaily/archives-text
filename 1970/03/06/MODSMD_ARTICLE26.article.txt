### 
The following is the text of a
resolution passed by the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
earlier this week providing for the
establishment of subordinate
judicial councils in four graduate
schools:
A Resolution Authorizing
Establishment of Subordinate Judicial
Councils in the Schools of Business,
Education, Law, and Medicine
I.
a. The students of the Schools of
Business, Education, Law, and
Medicine may each establish a
subordinate judicial council as follows:
1) By submitting a plan through an
appropriate representative agency of
their student body to the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
providing for the jurisdiction,
composition, and manner of
selection of such subordinate
council, and
2) By obtaining the approval of the
SCLC for such a plan.
b. Each such subordinate council shall
consist of not less than three (3) nor
more than seven (7) members, all of
whom must be students enrolled in
that school or faculty thereof.
c. The jurisdiction of a subordinate
judicial council shall extend to all cases
of Honor Code violations by a student
of that school. Jurisdiction may also
extend to cases involving the violation
of professional ethics where a written
code or statement of such ethics (1)
has been independently adopted by
formal vote of both the studentbody
and faculty of the school, (2) has been
approved by the SCLC, and (3) is
annually published and distributed to
students in the school.
11.
The SCLC shal' publish to the students
and faculty of the school concerned
and to the Chairman of the Stanford
Judicial Council any plan submitted
under I. above and given preliminary
approval. The Chairman of the SJC or
any student or faculty member of the
school may file in writing, within ten
(10) days of such publication, with the
Chairman of the SCLC a notice of
intent to object to the plan. If no
notice of intent to object is filed, the
Chairman of the SCLC, and the
President of the University approval of
establishment of the subordinate
council. If any notice of intent to
object is filed, the objector shall be
given reasonable time to perfect his
objection. The SCLC shall then
consider the objection and either
approve the plan or a modified plan or
disapprove it as soon as feasible.
111.
a. Any comolaint shall initially be filed
with the SJC. The SJC shall transmit
the case to the subordinate council, it

any, which it believes to have
jurisdiction.
b. The SJC may assert jurisdiction over
a case before a subordinate council
when the subordinate council tails to
act on a complaint within a reasonable
period of time.
IV.
a. All decisions of a subordinate
council shall be in writing, shall
summarize the facts and the basis for
the decision, and shall be transmitted
solely to the Chairman of the Stanford
Judicial Council. If the defendant has
been found not guilty, the SJC shall so
notify the defendant in writing, and
also notify the President of the
University. If the defendant has been
found guilty, the SJC shall either (1)
notify the defendant in writing of the
decision and of his right to appeal and
also notofy the President of the
University of the decision, or (2) upon
determination from the decision that
the penalty appears inconsistent with
precedent in that it is too harsh, too
lenient, or otherwise inappropriate,
return the case to the subordinate
council for a reconsideration of the
penalty.
b. After reconsideration of a penalty as
requested by the SJC under IV. a.(2),
the subordinate council shall transmit
its decision, whether or not altered, to
the Chairman of the SJC who will then
in writing notify the defendant of the
decision and his right to appeal and
also notify the President of the
University of the decision.
V.
a. A student has the right to appeal a
decision of a subordinate council to
the subcommittee of the SJC chosen in
accordance with Section 11.1.2 of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, as amended. Any such appeal,
with specifications of grounds, must be
filed in writing with the Chairman of
the SJC within ten (10) days of written
notification of the decision of the
defendant.
b. The grounds of appeal to be argued
under paragraph V.a. shall be (1) lack
of jurisdiction, (2) denial of
defendant's procedural rights, (3)
findings of fact manifestly contrary to
the evidence, (4) errors in
interpretation of the rules governing
student conduct, or (5) a penalty
grossly inappropriate to the offense.
c. Upon appeal the appellate
subcommittee may affirm, reverse, or
modify the decision of the subordinate
council, or order the case to be retried
in whole or in part by the SJC or by
the subordinate council.
VI.
The procedures of any subordinate
judicial council shall conform to those
prescribed for the SJC in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968, as amended. Defendants and

witnesses before a subordinate council
shall have the same rights and
responsibilities as those appearing
before the SJC. A subordinate council
may request from the Chairman of the
SJC the assistance of a Judicial Aide.
VII.
The judicial sanctions available to a
subordinate council shall be those
available to the SJC.
VIII.
The composition, manner of
selection, and jurisdiction of
subordinate council may be altered or
a subordinate council may be abolished
by the SCLC after notice and the
opportunity to file objections
(a) Upon its own motion;
(b) Upon motion of a majority vote
of the faculty of the professional
school concerned;
(c) Upon motion of the appropriate
agency of the professional school
student body; or
(d) Upon motion of a majority of
the members of the SJC.
