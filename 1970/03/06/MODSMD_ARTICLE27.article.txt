# No Credit Needed In Navy Programs
## 
### JOHN ECKHOUSE 
Programs for Navy and Marine
Corps Officers training without
requiring on-campus academic or
drill instruction are currently in
operation on campus.
Overlooked in the debate on
whether to grant academic credit
to ROTC courses are the Navy's
Reserve Officer Candidate (ROC)
program and the Marine Corps'
Platoon Leaders Class (PLC).
The ROC program recruits
full-time students in college,
although only about 100 are
enrolled throughout the nation.
Its members must "serve in
enlisted status in Naval Reserve
while attending school; however,
actual drill participation is not
required." After commissioning,
officers serve three years active

duty and three years inactive
duty.
Freshmen, sophomores, and
juniors and rectuited lor the
Marines' PLC. Students have no
on-campus or reserve training and
simply attend two 6-week or one
10-week training sessions during
the summer. They are
commissioned the day they
graduate from college and then
join with all other officer-recruits,
whether from ROTC or OCS, in a
21 week training course in
Quantico, Virginia.
The advantages of the two
programs are readily apparent.
They involve no academic time
and the PLC offers a pay
advantage of approximately $100
per month over other programs.
Major Richard Varney, a
Marine officer assigned here,
indicated why he felt so few
students entered the program,
"This program (ROTC) gives a
longer and slower exposure to the
service, which is better for
attracting career officers."
Also he noted that "when you
identify with the Marines, you
identify with the Vietnam War.
People have to picture themselves
as being directly involved in a
shooting war."
Varney emphasized, however,
that the ROC and PLC
alternatives could never
supplement the present ROTC
training on campus. "Your career
retention for ROTC is high—this is
the reason for the Navy having the
program."
The Navy offers the other
choices "to complement the
ROTC programs here which
provide for career officers."
Varney considers the PLC to
simply provide a large number of
second-line reserve officers: to
provide for normal attrition as
non-career officers move through
and out of active service.
