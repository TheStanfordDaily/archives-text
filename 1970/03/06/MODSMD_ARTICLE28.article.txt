# Center Ready To Take Plans
## 
### 
Members of the eleven-man (6
students, 5 faculty members)
Policy Board of the Student
Center for Innovation in Research
and Education have been
appointed, and are now beginning
to consider proposals for
individual and group student
projects for spring and summer
quarters.
A half-time director will soon
be hired to serve as the main staff
member of the Student Center.
Proposals for spring quarter
will be considered during the first
two weeks after the quarter
begins, but students who plan to
submit proposals are advised to
contact Joyce Kobayashi.
The Student Center has been
established to respond to student
initiative in educational
programs—on an individual or
institutional level.
Possible projects are: courses
on urban or environmental topics
for an experimental college;
attitude surveys at home during
the summer, or research at an
overseas campus; or perhaps six
units of preparatory work for a
fifteen unit field research project
in Asia.
The Center will also compile a
list of "friends of the
Center"—faculty members who
are willing to sponsor projects in
different fields. In this way,
students who have particular
projects in mind might be helped
in finding an interested faculty
member to work with.
Student members of the Policy
Board are: Dave DeWolfe, Robert
Jaffe, Joyce Kobayashi, Hand
Lazer, and Doug Otto. Faculty
members are: Merrill David
Abernethy, Policical Science,
Carlsmith, Psychology; Sidney
Drell, SLAC; Bob Madix,
Chemical Engineering; Herbert
Packer, Law.
