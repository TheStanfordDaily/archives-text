## 'Patton,' Other Film Bits And Pieces 
### TODD McCARTHY 
I had thought that approaching
"Patton" would be quite difficult,
for I hate everything the man
stood for. The late general thrived
in armed combat and passionately
felt that in war rested the ultimate
test of a man. Yet after seeing the
new film which depicts his
activities during World War Two, I
am forced to admit that though I
can't at all admire, honor or like
Patton, I rather respect him, if
only because he managed to retain
and make felt his distinct
individuality even in the most
adverse conditions.
Patton reminded me of several
physical education instructors I
had in high school, but while I
was able to successfully pull off a
Yossarian act when faced with
push-ups, wrestling and the pole
vault, there would seem to be no
getting around the orders of the
Third Army's fanatical
disciplinarian. If only in this one
instance, I am thankful that the
very nature of the cinema medium
provides a safe distance for the
viewer to judge and deal with the
characters depicted on the screen.
No Emotion
In the light of the controversial
subject matter, the film is
uncommon in that neither the
screen writers nor the director
have taken any discernable
emotional or intellectual stance
toward their subject. Normally, I
object to artistic ambivalence, but
in this case, it seems not to be
ambivilance as much as carefully
controlled objectivity—the main
character is so forceful to begin
with that any further (and lesser)
personalities imposed upon the
project would have deterred and

distorted the exposition of
Patton's own personality.
Politically speaking, a
determinedly pro-Patton approach
would have proved naive in view
of the general's audacity and
unpopular beliefs and would have
created an easy target for anyone
standing to the left of Barry
Goldwater. On the other hand,
were the picture anti-Patton or
consciously anti-war, it would
have suffered from contradictions
of purpose for telling the story.
Certainly 20th Century-Fox is not
going to spend $12 million to win
the affection of pacifists.
Not a Documentary
However, the film is not a
documentary-like pageant of

history in the form of an action
film, like "The Longest Day."
"Patton" is an intense character
study of a man inseparable from
war whose closest cousin, in terms
of filmic proportions and
intellectual maturity, is
"Lawrence of Arabia."
Though director Franklin
Schaffner's visual virtuosity is not
as evident here as it was in "Planet
of the Apes," the credibility of his
staging is exemplary. The battle
scenes are particularly noteworthy
in that the logistics of the
conflicts are always clear.
Schaffner, an emissary from the
halycon days of live television,
seems an unimpeachably tasteful
director who, while perhaps

lacking in inspiration, emerges
distinguishably due to his innate
intelligence and attraction to
unusual subjects.
Scott Inseparable
From the very beginning, when
Patton strides before a gigantic
American flag to deliver his rabble
rousing speech to his soldiers,
George C. Scott and his role seem
inseparable—l can't imagine any
other way Patton could have been
portrayed than as he is by Scott.
Indeed, the actor relishes and
assumes his character so
completely that I wouldn't be
surprised if Scott himself changed
considerably as a result of his
emersion in the role.
* * *
After an intolerably long wait,
"War and Peace" is finally playing
in the immediate Stanford
vicinity. Though I have

recommended it twice before, I
feel compelled to do so again, for
the film's visual scope and the
sheer power of its presentation are
unlikely to be equalled again. The
film is definitely worth the two
trips to the Fine Arts required to
see it.

Film activity slows down
considerably during dead week

this Sunday at the Flicks is
''Faces," John Cassavettes'
overpraised but valid vision of
urban life and marriage. Clive
Miller's double bill of "To Be or
Not To Be" and "Casablanca" is a
must. The films will be shown on
both Tuesday and Wednesday
nights in Geology 320.

The International Association

"Loneliness of the Long Distance
Runner" with Tom Courteney.
Last minute additions to the
quarter's film schedule are Milos
Forman's acclaimed "Loves of a
Blonde" on Friday in Cubberley
and, at the same location next
Saturday, "The Time Machine,"
which features some excellent
special effects and the wonderful
Morlacks. In the distant future, on
Thursday of exam week, is the
International Association's final
film, the slight but charming "The
Shameless Old Lady."

THE WAR LOVER-George C. Scott stars as George Patton in the intelligent new film account ol the late general's life
I had thought that approaching
"Patton" would be quite difficult,
for I hate everything the man
stood for. The late general thrived
in armed combat and passionately
felt that in war rested the ultimate
test of a man. Yet after seeing the
new film which depicts his
activities during World War Two, I
am forced to admit that though I
can't at all admire, honor or like
Patton, I rather respect him, if
only because he managed to retain
and make felt his distinct
individuality even in the most
adverse conditions.
Patton reminded me of several
physical education instructors I
had in high school, but while I
was able to successfully pull off a
Yossarian act when faced with
push-ups, wrestling and the pole
vault, there would seem to be no
getting around the orders of the
Third Army's fanatical
disciplinarian. If only in this one
instance, I am thankful that the
very nature of the cinema medium
provides a safe distance for the
viewer to judge and deal with the
characters depicted on the screen.
No Emotion
In the light of the controversial
subject matter, the film is
uncommon in that neither the
screen writers nor the director
have taken any discernable
emotional or intellectual stance
toward their subject. Normally, I
object to artistic ambivalence, but
in this case, it seems not to be
ambivilance as much as carefully
controlled objectivity—the main
character is so forceful to begin
with that any further (and lesser)
personalities imposed upon the
project would have deterred and

distorted the exposition of
Patton's own personality.
Politically speaking, a
determinedly pro-Patton approach
would have proved naive in view
of the general's audacity and
unpopular beliefs and would have
created an easy target for anyone
standing to the left of Barry
Goldwater. On the other hand,
were the picture anti-Patton or
consciously anti-war, it would
have suffered from contradictions
of purpose for telling the story.
Certainly 20th Century-Fox is not
going to spend $12 million to win
the affection of pacifists.
Not a Documentary
However, the film is not a
documentary-like pageant of

history in the form of an action
film, like "The Longest Day."
"Patton" is an intense character
study of a man inseparable from
war whose closest cousin, in terms
of filmic proportions and
intellectual maturity, is
"Lawrence of Arabia."
Though director Franklin
Schaffner's visual virtuosity is not
as evident here as it was in "Planet
of the Apes," the credibility of his
staging is exemplary. The battle
scenes are particularly noteworthy
in that the logistics of the
conflicts are always clear.
Schaffner, an emissary from the
halycon days of live television,
seems an unimpeachably tasteful
director who, while perhaps

lacking in inspiration, emerges
distinguishably due to his innate
intelligence and attraction to
unusual subjects.
Scott Inseparable
From the very beginning, when
Patton strides before a gigantic
American flag to deliver his rabble
rousing speech to his soldiers,
George C. Scott and his role seem
inseparable—l can't imagine any
other way Patton could have been
portrayed than as he is by Scott.
Indeed, the actor relishes and
assumes his character so
completely that I wouldn't be
surprised if Scott himself changed
considerably as a result of his
emersion in the role.
* * *
After an intolerably long wait,
"War and Peace" is finally playing
in the immediate Stanford
vicinity. Though I have

recommended it twice before, I
feel compelled to do so again, for
the film's visual scope and the
sheer power of its presentation are
unlikely to be equalled again. The
film is definitely worth the two
trips to the Fine Arts required to
see it.

Film activity slows down
considerably during dead week

this Sunday at the Flicks is
''Faces," John Cassavettes'
overpraised but valid vision of
urban life and marriage. Clive
Miller's double bill of "To Be or
Not To Be" and "Casablanca" is a
must. The films will be shown on
both Tuesday and Wednesday
nights in Geology 320.

The International Association
film in Cubberley next Thursday
is Tony Richardson's harrowing
"Loneliness of the Long Distance
Runner" with Tom Courteney.
Last minute additions to the
quarter's film schedule are Milos
Forman's acclaimed "Loves of a
Blonde" on Friday in Cubberley
and, at the same location next
Saturday, "The Time Machine,"
which features some excellent
special effects and the wonderful
Morlacks. In the distant future, on
Thursday of exam week, is the
International Association's final

meantime, however, I plan to
report back on the Cannes Film
Festival in May and the London
Festival in the fall, as well as on
any other filmic finds I make on
the continent.


THE WAR LOVER-George C. Scott stars as George Patton in the intelligent new film account ol the late general's life
I had thought that approaching
"Patton" would be quite difficult,
for I hate everything the man
stood for. The late general thrived
in armed combat and passionately
felt that in war rested the ultimate
test of a man. Yet after seeing the
new film which depicts his
activities during World War Two, I
am forced to admit that though I
can't at all admire, honor or like
Patton, I rather respect him, if
only because he managed to retain
and make felt his distinct
individuality even in the most
adverse conditions.
Patton reminded me of several
physical education instructors I
had in high school, but while I
was able to successfully pull off a
Yossarian act when faced with
push-ups, wrestling and the pole
vault, there would seem to be no
getting around the orders of the
Third Army's fanatical
disciplinarian. If only in this one
instance, I am thankful that the
very nature of the cinema medium
provides a safe distance for the
viewer to judge and deal with the
characters depicted on the screen.
No Emotion
In the light of the controversial
subject matter, the film is
uncommon in that neither the
screen writers nor the director
have taken any discernable
emotional or intellectual stance
toward their subject. Normally, I
object to artistic ambivalence, but
in this case, it seems not to be
ambivilance as much as carefully
controlled objectivity—the main
character is so forceful to begin
with that any further (and lesser)
personalities imposed upon the
project would have deterred and

distorted the exposition of
Patton's own personality.
Politically speaking, a
determinedly pro-Patton approach
would have proved naive in view
of the general's audacity and
unpopular beliefs and would have
created an easy target for anyone
standing to the left of Barry
Goldwater. On the other hand,
were the picture anti-Patton or
consciously anti-war, it would
have suffered from contradictions
of purpose for telling the story.
Certainly 20th Century-Fox is not
going to spend $12 million to win
the affection of pacifists.
Not a Documentary
However, the film is not a
documentary-like pageant of

history in the form of an action
film, like "The Longest Day."
"Patton" is an intense character
study of a man inseparable from
war whose closest cousin, in terms
of filmic proportions and
intellectual maturity, is
"Lawrence of Arabia."
Though director Franklin
Schaffner's visual virtuosity is not
as evident here as it was in "Planet
of the Apes," the credibility of his
staging is exemplary. The battle
scenes are particularly noteworthy
in that the logistics of the
conflicts are always clear.
Schaffner, an emissary from the
halycon days of live television,
seems an unimpeachably tasteful
director who, while perhaps

lacking in inspiration, emerges
distinguishably due to his innate
intelligence and attraction to
unusual subjects.
Scott Inseparable
From the very beginning, when
Patton strides before a gigantic
American flag to deliver his rabble
rousing speech to his soldiers,
George C. Scott and his role seem
inseparable—l can't imagine any
other way Patton could have been
portrayed than as he is by Scott.
Indeed, the actor relishes and
assumes his character so
completely that I wouldn't be
surprised if Scott himself changed
considerably as a result of his
emersion in the role.
* * *
After an intolerably long wait,
"War and Peace" is finally playing
in the immediate Stanford
vicinity. Though I have

recommended it twice before, I
feel compelled to do so again, for
the film's visual scope and the
sheer power of its presentation are
unlikely to be equalled again. The
film is definitely worth the two
trips to the Fine Arts required to
see it.

Film activity slows down
considerably during dead week
but by no means stops. Showing
this Sunday at the Flicks is
''Faces," John Cassavettes'
overpraised but valid vision of
urban life and marriage. Clive
Miller's double bill of "To Be or
Not To Be" and "Casablanca" is a
must. The films will be shown on
both Tuesday and Wednesday
nights in Geology 320.
* * ♦
The International Association
film in Cubberley next Thursday
is Tony Richardson's harrowing
"Loneliness of the Long Distance
Runner" with Tom Courteney.
Last minute additions to the
quarter's film schedule are Milos
Forman's acclaimed "Loves of a
Blonde" on Friday in Cubberley
and, at the same location next
Saturday, "The Time Machine,"
which features some excellent
special effects and the wonderful
Morlacks. In the distant future, on
Thursday of exam week, is the
International Association's final
film, the slight but charming "The
Shameless Old Lady."
