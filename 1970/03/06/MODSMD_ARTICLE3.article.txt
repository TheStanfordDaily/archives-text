# Pitzer ROTC Position Unclear
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL (Last in a Series) 
QUESTION: "President Pitzer, did you support last year's
faculty Senate decision on ROTC?"
ANSWER: "I did not make any categorical
recommendations a year ago. I was new on campus then
so I listened to the Senate's debate and commented on a
few subjects."
Q: "After you became acquainted with the University did
you then support their decision?"
A: "I think what is being proposed now is an
improvement over what was proposed then."
Q: "Did you support the Majority Report (the report that
recommended the proposals the Senate adopted) last
year?"
A: "I think that this is enough detail. I had a press
conference with your editor and some of the people on
your staff a few weeks ago, and you could have asked that
then. I just haven't been thinking about this whole thing
this week. I am not familiar with the documents now, and
I am not prepared to comment on it now.''

Ten people controlled the implementation of the
February, 1969 Faculty ROTC decision. The most
influential was President Kenneth Pitzer.
Past articles in this series have considered the other
men and women involved. Eight were on the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC. Five of these either
disagreed wholly or in part with the faculty Senate's "no
credit" plan.
The ninth man was Vice Provost Howard Brooks who
conducted all of the negotiations with the military over
the proposed individual and institutional contract
changes. Brooks had been the author of the Minority
ROTC Report (which was rejected by the Senate), and he
voted against the Senate recommendations he was chosen
to implement.
The 10th man was Pitzer. And the compelling question
is where he stood during the months prior to his January
19 letter to the faculty Senate in which he strongly
recommended the adoption of the Army's ROTC
proposal.
In that letter Pitzer described the Army proposal as
"reasonable and acceptable, and very close indeed to the
recommendations adopted by the Senate on February 13,
1969." That evaluation seems a bit forced in light of some
of the President's later statements.
Pitzer has not been vocal on the ROTC issue so any
insights into his beliefs are based on fragmentary evidence.
His first substantive statement on the issue was in an

unexpected appearance November 6, 1969 at a meeting of
the President's Advisory Committee.
The minutes read: "President Pitzer then discussed the
importance of the ROTC question to many members of
the Stanford community, including Trustees and alumni.
He stated his understanding of the intent of the Senate's
action on ROTC, namely that ROTC could continue on a
basis satisfactory to the faculty on academic matters.
"On the other hand, he must take into account the
student vote and the Trustee's resolution on the subject.
He also reported conversations with various Defense
officials, including Mr. Packard, and commented on
difficult congressional attitudes, noting that the chances

are decidedly dim for legislative correction of such
problems as the 'punitive clauses' in individual contracts.
"Mr. Pitzer also discussed his view that ROTC
programs which placed the emphasis on the reserve
aspects are more compatible with educational institutions
than are those emphasizing career preparation."
The subject of outside pressures arose again at a press
conference in late January following the Senate's
reconsideration of the issue. At that time Pitzer
acknowledged that limited credit for ROTC represented a
compromise with disgruntled alumni, trustees, and other
outside friends.
"This is one area in which all sorts of friends of the
University are concerned," he said. "So, I thought that if
it was possible to compromise with these groups it was
best to do so.
"A University is not a self-supporting institution. It can
thrive only on support of the outside community's gifts
and tuition," he added.
Statements like these led to some speculation that
defense department and alumni pressures had influenced
Pitzer's decision.
In fact, one member of the President's Advisory
Committee said privately "When nearly everyone in the
University is some way involved in military-industrial
complex, the one fellow doesn't need to hit the other over
the head to make him change. It only takes one comment
by a guy like David Packard at a cocktail party, with a
martini in his hand, to make the point."
Following a similar line of argument, some ROTC
critics have noted that Congressional pressures to reduce
spending to universities where ROTC is under attack may
have affected the President's willingness to stand by the
decision.

This criticism has some basis in fact. At the November
20, 1969 Advisory committee meeting Brooks noted the
President's concern over just such funding cuts.
The minutes read: "Mr. Brooks indicated the reasons
for the President's concern about ROTC and the
University's external relations, pointing to the narrow
margin by which the so-called Rivers amendment to the
DOD appropriations bill was defeated in the Senate-House
Conference Committee after having been passed by the
House. He emphasized that there are very real problems,
and that the President needs the Committee's counsel in
these matters."
Many have analyzed the pressures on the President and
concluded that his strong action resulted from it. But such
a claim is debatable since it assumes that Pitzer needed to
be pressured to decide as he did.
In fact, the opposite could be argued on the basis of
Pitzer's limited statements.
As Chairman Manne said in an interview last week,
"For you to ask me what effect I think Defense
Department pressure had in affecting Pitzer's decision is
to assume that he at one time agreed with the original
Senate decision. I don't know that he did. I choose to
judge his attitudes by his actions," he said.
For whatever reasons, the President did strongly
recommend the Army plan to the Senate and that body
approved it. The effect of his recommendation on their
adoption remains a matter for speculation.
From February 1969 to January 1970 the faculty
Senate had decided that "there should be no academic
credit received for participation in programs of military
training and education," meant limited credit.
What caused this change?
There were undoubtedly many contributing factors;
but it can not be ignored that ten men controlled the
original policy's implementation and seven had some
reservations about it.
One of the seven was the President of the University
and that may have been a large part of the difference.

Ballots for the Army ROTC issue are being mailed
today to members of the Academic Council, according to
Academic Secretary H. Donald Winbigler.
The ballots must be returned to the Office of the
Academic Secretary by March 25.
Written arguments by Council members relative to the
issue may be submitted to the CAMPUS RKPORT. If they
are received by March 12, 1970, thev mav be printed in
CAMPUS RKPORT.
