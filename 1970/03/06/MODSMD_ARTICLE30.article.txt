# Trio Brightens Nitery
## 
### GARY SALT 
The Ram's Head One-Acts
which opened at the Nitery
Wednesday evening is a revealing
and highly entertaining
production showcasing some fine
new actresses. The trio of plays is
linked by a general concern with
the humor, pathos, and absurdity
arising from man's vanity and
blindness. They are, nevertheless,
three completely separate plays:
A.A. Milne's THE UGLY
DUCKLING, directed by
Catherine Ribnick: Tennessee
Williams' 27 WAGONS FULL OF
COTTON, directed by Teri
Brown; and Joean Giraudoux's
THE APOLLO OF BELLAC,
directed by John Morse.
THE APOLLO OF BELLAC
offers us a problem in practical
aesthetics. Agnes, lonely,
frustrated, and innocent, has
never been awakened to the
beauty around her until she meets
the Man from Bellac. He unveils
the secret of dealing with men
("Tell them they're handsome")
and tries to teach her the
complexities and joys of beauty.
She practices his techniques on a
fly, a chandelier, and quickly
works her way through the ranks
of the International Bureau of
Inventions until she is adroitly
manipulating the President and
Chairman of the Board.
Bizarre
Early impressions suggest that
there are simply a few curiosities
in Giraudoux's script but it soon
is apparent that parts of this
vignette are downright bizarre. As
Agnes, Maureen Phillips is
appropriately twittering and
bashful, gradually gaining
assurance and poise under the
guidance of Steven Ungar as the
Man from Bellac.
Ungar's performance is
excellent as the bearded and
bouncing enigmatic little troll
who hovers over the action he sets

in motion, alternately lounging
around the set or hawking the
benefits of a new invention (the
Universal Vegetable) to the
audience. He is quick, expressive,
self-confident, and helps pull the
show out of some molasses
pacing.
Interplay
As the company President,
Roger Thacker invests his role
with a polished stage presence and
a commendable sense of interplay
with other actors. In supporting
roles, Lance Lawson, Noel Ferris,
and Paul Moser give credible
performances. John Morse's
direction is uneven throughout
and although he elicits some good
performances/"his random staging,
particularly with groups, can be
annoying.
In 27 WAGONS FULL OF
COTTON, the directorial
problems facing Teri Brown are
less obvious and more
satisfactorily resolved, largely
because she is working with only
three actors. Becky Daniels'
evocative setting never seriously
grapples with the problem of
three-quarter staging.
The play explores some of the
worst possible results of a "good
neighbor policy" that begins with
arson. In order to bring business
to his own mill, Jake (William
Johnston) torches the cotton gin
of his largest competitor, Vicarro
(Tom McLaren). Yet Jake is too
stupid and too insensitive to care
that his wife, Flora, pays the price
of his new business when she must
"entertain" the other owner while
Jake is working.
Competition
Both Jake and Vicarro
compete for our contempt but
Johnston's spitting,
belly-scratching, and Neanderthal
grunting are just not slimy
enough. Both fall short of
difficult roles and McLaren must
sustain an extended seduction

scene given very little movement.
Fortunately, however, both
play opposite Betty James, a very
talented young lady and
unquestionably the outstanding
performer of the evening. Her
Flora is a sensitive, engaging, and
complete characterization of a
pathetic yet somehow wonderful
womanâ€”the kind of woman
whose slip is ALWAYS showing,
who buys florid taffeta dresses,
uneducated but not unfeeling and
therefore always exploited.
Switch
Even after intermission, the
switch from Williams to Milne is
strenuous. THE UGLY
DUCKLING is a fairy tale testing
the familiar notion that beauty is
in the eye of the beholder. It is
totally predictable and
consequently thoroughly
unpretentious and delightful.
Together, Catherine Ridnick and
costume designer Nancy Hendrick
have developed an imaginative
production, emotionally and
visually pleasant, sustained by
some marvelous young actresses.
William Dahl as the Prince and
Deborah Pauly as Princess Camilla
play extremely well in tandem
and their scene of mutual
discovery is intelligently
conceived and developed. Miss
Pauly shows good timing
especially in her voice variations
and quick understatements.
Deborah Healy played Dulcibella
with an enchanting blend of
beauty and crudity, an unpolished
gem of a serving-girl who must
substitute for the Princess, "a ruse
often recorded in history books."
Clincher
Finally, to clinch the fact that
virtually the whole evening
belonged to the actresses,
Catherine Allport created a
stunning Queen, dominating but
vacant, displaying a constant,
toothsome smile and gliding
around the stage as though her
light head were holding her feet
just off the floor.
As an unwilling straight-man,
Tom Flohr presented a useful if
unexciting version of King but it
was almost inevitable that he,
David Turner and Richard Maul
would get lost in the shuffle of
feminine talent. Directors and
designers have tried to squeeze
three literate and friendly plays
into the Nitery space and they
most certainly deserve to squeeze
some people in as well.
There are two complete
performances tonight and
Saturday, at 6:30 and again at
9:30.
