Enlisted Men and Idiots in the second act of "WE BOMBED IN NEW HAVEN."
Joseph Heller's surrealistic play of actors/military is being presented by The
Junipero Players tonight and tomorrow in the Junipero (Wilbur) lounge. Directed
by Alan Mokler, produced by James Cone, the play explores America's
keystone—irrationality, as did Heller's novel, "CATCH 22." Performances are at
8:30, admission is free.
