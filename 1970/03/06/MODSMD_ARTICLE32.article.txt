Another highlight will be
"Mbongimbel and Kegel"
dances, the presentation of
young girls for their initiation
into puberty. The girls have been
undergoing a secret preparation,
isolated from the village for two
or three months. When they are
considered ready for initiation,
they appear in their festive
costumes, their breasts bared.
They make a slow tour of the
village, in order that everyone
may admire them, then they
form a circle and perform two
dances when they will permit
their admirers to evaluate their
grace and gentleness.
Many of the dances which
will be presented in this
performance have only recently
been seen by the uninitiated.
A detailed description of the
historical context of each dance
will be provided in the program.

"Les Danseurs Africains," a
company of 45 dancers, singers,

Dances of nine of the tribes
of the Cameroons will make up

the "Funeral Rites of the Falis
Tribe." The Falis constitute one

bound through the personal
intercession of their forefathers.
The funeral rites—none of the
details have been changed or
modified down through the
centuries —are of considerable
historical importance.
