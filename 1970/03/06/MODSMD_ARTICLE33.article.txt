# Hornsby's Highlights
## Avoiding Venal Vinyl Vendors 
### CAPTAIN HORNSBY 
Our philosophy on reviewing
obscure albums developed from
many hours of soul-searching in
record stores desperately trying to
find a sleeper-that diamond needle
in the musical haystack. As your
exposure to music increases, your
appetite grows and your tastes
seem to become more catholic.
You can intellectualize about
music, find merit and amusement
in parts of it, and not just react to
it in some arcane corner of your
guts. Since great quantities of
trash are about, however, the
unwary purchaser generally ends
up with a lot of venal vinyl.
Buyer Beware
Should you spot the LORD

SUTCH AND HEAVY
FRIENDS, album, you'll want to
keep your money in your pocket.
Even a confirmed Led Zep freak
will be turned off by the gravel
vocals, abrupt arrangements, and
indifferent engineering. Jimmy
Page couldn't have put much time
into producing the album; if it
were put together any more
loosely they'd be selling it as a
jigsaw puzzle.
He co-authored and played on
6 cuts. Jeff Beck is used on one
awful cut (sample lyric," . . .got
to be played on Jeff's gutty
guitar"). Nicky Hopkins makes his
sole appearance on this cut, but
he is mixed so far behind Lord
Sutch's chalk-on-the-blackboard

vocal that it coule be my
grandmother at the player piano.
Lord Sutch tries to evoke Mick
Jagger and Robert Plant but
comes off more like Barry
McGuire imitating Rex Harrison.
At one point he turns "traffic"
into an eight syllable word.
Name-Dropper
The drumming by John
Bonham and some other guys is
cool, and Page gets off some good
white blues riffs, but Lord Sutch
won't keep quiet long enough to
let you enjoy it. His material is
rife with cliches, and his servile
name-dropping is obvious. "Keep
that music goin' strong, With
Jimmy Page you can't go wrong."
The album cover has four

cameos of the Lord with Hopkins,
Beck, Page and Noel Redding, a
disgusting frontpiece, and some
oh-so-clever liner notes. Go into
the store, ask for it, look at it,
laugh, but, as for buying it...
Plug It In
If you get it on for piano rock,
a better use for your money
mught be BLESS YOU, DR.
WOODWARD by the Edison
Electric Band. They feature Mark
Jordan at the keyboard, and hs is
strong. The guitar player has a
country style, so that their sound
is not heavy, but it is "easy
listening" and h# variety.
A couple If cuts give a
Youngblqfod feeing, "Please Send
Me" is a piano' workout in the

Don Shirley early gospel style,
and you get treated to some great
Floyd Cramer riffs. The vocals are
incidental but pleasant. Overall,
they remind me of Traffic; nice
stuff to clear the head.
Quill
The guys in QUILL are
talented, but I didn't feel that
they were making a sincere effort
to pour on the excitement. If you
like lots of freaky stopping,
starting (not necessarity together),
and other sorts of
"inventiveness", they might
interest you. A hidden benefit of
the album is the foul and
pretentious lyrics on the inside
jacket. ("I wish it could be me to
ram it through to you that this is
real. . .a place to be in ecstasy and
I know it's flowing in you. Feel it
it's growing in you.")
BLOODROCK is an interesting
album; apart from some dreary
instrumentals, they do driving
material, and their vocals are
reminiscent of early Jim Morrison
and Arthur Lee (Love). There is
some Three Dog Night harmony
that comes off well and they find
some novel chord changes.
Weekend Happenings
Not much new "name" rock
out lately; other ways to spend
your money:
Discount Records has tickets
for Saturday night at Santa Clara
with Santana & Elvin Bishop, and
as always they have Fillmore West
tickets: this weekend Butterfield
Blues Band, Savoy Brown, and
Keith Relf's Renaissance
(ex-Yardbirds). Next weekend
brings Ten Years After and Buddy
Rich. Lee Michaels and the
Rhythm Dukes are at the Family
Dog, which is a friendly place.
On Sunday, there is a soul
show at the Oakland Coliseum,
featuring the all-girl Sweet
Inspirations. Locally, the Exit has
T-Bone Walker (blues), while if
you feel highbrow try Basin Street
West for The Platters or the
Fairmont Hotel for Sonny and
Cher. Blood, Sweat & Tears
(hyped as America's Number 1
group with the 9 Grammy
nominations) will but on a post
exam show March 21, probably at
the Coliseum.

like lots of freaky stopping,
starting (not necessarity together),
and other sorts of
"inventiveness", they might
interest you. A hidden benefit of
the album is the foul and
pretentious lyrics on the inside
jacket. ("I wish it could be me to
ram it through to you that this is
real. . .a place to be in ecstasy and
I know it's flowing in you. Feel it
it's growing in you.")
BLOODROCK is an interesting
album; apart from some dreary
instrumentals, they do driving
material, and their vocals are
reminiscent of early Jim Morrison
and Arthur Lee (Love). There is
some Three Dog Night harmony
that comes off well and they find
some novel chord changes.
Weekend Happenings
Not much new "name" rock
out lately; other ways to spend
your money:
Discount Records has tickets
for Saturday night at Santa Clara
with Santana & Elvin Bishop, and
as always they have Fillmore West
tickets: this weekend Butterfield
Blues Band, Savoy Brown, and
Keith Relf's Renaissance
(ex-Yardbirds). Next weekend
brings Ten Years After and Buddy
Rich. Lee Michaels and the
Rhythm Dukes are at the Family
Dog, which is a friendly place.
On Sunday, there is a soul
show at the Oakland Coliseum,
featuring the all-girl Sweet
Inspirations. Locally, the Exit has
T-Bone Walker (blues), while if
you feel highbrow try Basin Street
West for The Platters or the
Fairmont Hotel for Sonny and
Cher. Blood, Sweat & Tears
(hyped as America's Number 1
group with the 9 Grammy
nominations) will but on a post
exam show March 21, probably at
the Coliseum.
Our philosophy on reviewing
obscure albums developed from
many hours of soul-searching in
record stores desperately trying to
find a sleeper-that diamond needle
in the musical haystack. As your
exposure to music increases, your
appetite grows and your tastes
seem to become more catholic.
You can intellectualize about
music, find merit and amusement
in parts of it, and not just react to
it in some arcane corner of your
guts. Since great quantities of
trash are about, however, the
unwary purchaser generally ends
up with a lot of venal vinyl.
Buyer Beware
Should you spot the LORD

SUTCH AND HEAVY
FRIENDS, album, you'll want to
keep your money in your pocket.
Even a confirmed Led Zep freak
will be turned off by the gravel
vocals, abrupt arrangements, and
indifferent engineering. Jimmy
Page couldn't have put much time
into producing the album; if it
were put together any more
loosely they'd be selling it as a
jigsaw puzzle.
He co-authored and played on
6 cuts. Jeff Beck is used on one
awful cut (sample lyric," . . .got
to be played on Jeff's gutty
guitar"). Nicky Hopkins makes his
sole appearance on this cut, but
he is mixed so far behind Lord
Sutch's chalk-on-the-blackboard

vocal that it coule be my
grandmother at the player piano.
Lord Sutch tries to evoke Mick
Jagger and Robert Plant but
comes off more like Barry
McGuire imitating Rex Harrison.
At one point he turns "traffic"
into an eight syllable word.
Name-Dropper
The drumming by John
Bonham and some other guys is
cool, and Page gets off some good
white blues riffs, but Lord Sutch
won't keep quiet long enough to
let you enjoy it. His material is
rife with cliches, and his servile
name-dropping is obvious. "Keep
that music goin' strong, With
Jimmy Page you can't go wrong."
The album cover has four

cameos of the Lord with Hopkins,
Beck, Page and Noel Redding, a
disgusting frontpiece, and some
oh-so-clever liner notes. Go into
the store, ask for it, look at it,
laugh, but, as for buying it...
Plug It In
If you get it on for piano rock,
a better use for your money
mught be BLESS YOU, DR.
WOODWARD by the Edison
Electric Band. They feature Mark
Jordan at the keyboard, and hs is
strong. The guitar player has a
country style, so that their sound
is not heavy, but it is "easy
listening" and h# variety.
A couple If cuts give a
Youngblqfod feeing, "Please Send
Me" is a piano' workout in the

Don Shirley early gospel style,
and you get treated to some great
Floyd Cramer riffs. The vocals are
incidental but pleasant. Overall,
they remind me of Traffic; nice
stuff to clear the head.

comes off more like Barry
McGuire imitating Rex Harrison.
At one point he turns "traffic"
into an eight syllable word.
Name-Dropper
The drumming by John
Bonham and some other guys is
cool, and Page gets off some good
white blues riffs, but Lord Sutch
won't keep quiet long enough to
let you enjoy it. His material is
rife with cliches, and his servile
name-dropping is obvious. "Keep
that music goin' strong, With
Jimmy Page you can't go wrong."
The album cover has four

cameos of the Lord with Hopkins,
Beck, Page and Noel Redding, a
disgusting frontpiece, and some
oh-so-clever liner notes. Go into
the store, ask for it, look at it,
laugh, but, as for buying it...
Plug It In
If you get it on for piano rock,
a better use for your money
mught be BLESS YOU, DR.
WOODWARD by the Edison
Electric Band. They feature Mark
Jordan at the keyboard, and hs is
strong. The guitar player has a
country style, so that their sound
is not heavy, but it is "easy
listening" and h# variety.
A couple If cuts give a
Youngblqfod feeing, "Please Send
Me" is a piano' workout in the

Don Shirley early gospel style,
and you get treated to some great
Floyd Cramer riffs. The vocals are
incidental but pleasant. Overall,
they remind me of Traffic; nice
stuff to clear the head.
Quill
The guys in QUILL are
talented, but I didn't feel that
they were making a sincere effort
to pour on the excitement. If you
like lots of freaky stopping,
starting (not necessarity together),
and other sorts of
"inventiveness", they might
interest you. A hidden benefit of
the album is the foul and
pretentious lyrics on the inside
jacket. ("I wish it could be me to
ram it through to you that this is
real. . .a place to be in ecstasy and
I know it's flowing in you. Feel it
it's growing in you.")
BLOODROCK is an interesting
album; apart from some dreary
instrumentals, they do driving
material, and their vocals are
reminiscent of early Jim Morrison
and Arthur Lee (Love). There is
some Three Dog Night harmony
that comes off well and they find
some novel chord changes.
Weekend Happenings
Not much new "name" rock
out lately; other ways to spend
your money:
Discount Records has tickets
for Saturday night at Santa Clara
with Santana & Elvin Bishop, and
as always they have Fillmore West
tickets: this weekend Butterfield
Blues Band, Savoy Brown, and
Keith Relf's Renaissance
(ex-Yardbirds). Next weekend
brings Ten Years After and Buddy
Rich. Lee Michaels and the
Rhythm Dukes are at the Family
Dog, which is a friendly place.
On Sunday, there is a soul
show at the Oakland Coliseum,
featuring the all-girl Sweet
Inspirations. Locally, the Exit has
T-Bone Walker (blues), while if
you feel highbrow try Basin Street
West for The Platters or the
Fairmont Hotel for Sonny and
Cher. Blood, Sweat & Tears
(hyped as America's Number 1
group with the 9 Grammy
nominations) will but on a post
exam show March 21, probably at
the Coliseum.
