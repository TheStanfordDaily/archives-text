# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Yo-Yo Ma In Major Debut 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
It seems as if San Francisco
Symphone audiences are getting a
bit too promiscuous with their
approval. Long applause greets
competent performances, and
standing ovations all too often
reward mediocre ones.
Such was the case Wednesday
evening, when at least half the
audience leapt to their feet
following a reasonable, but far
from outstanding performance of
Mahler's uneditied "Symphony
No. 1, 'The Titan'.
Mahler Maligned
I feel that I am in an excellent
position to evaluate the
Symphony's performance, since I
am not suffused by Mahler's
romanticism - in short, I don't like
it. I feel toward Mahler the way
my editor feels towards classical
music in general - it all sounds
pretty much the same.
It has been said of
Shostakovichthat he wrote one
symphony ten times. To that I
would like to add: Mahler wrote
one movement sixty times. It isn't
that Mahler is totally unoriginal;
in fact, he does have any number
of truly creative moments which
he carefully hides in his bouquets
of notes. He destroys the beauty
by overuse and long-windedness;
Mahler is the Hubert Humphrey
of the concert hall.

He speaks, and speaks, and
speaks, saying much the same
things in much the same words. In
his attempts to find the perfect
word, he recites the dictionary. I
wish someone would have bought
him an abridged version.
Contrary to prevaling opinion,
I do not seek to blackball Mahler
from the repetoire. Actually, I
find that one or two experiences
with him per season serves to
heighten my respect for

Beethoven, Mozart and
Stravinsky.
Horns Poor
As I say, I can tell where the
horns are out of tune, where the
strings were dragging, and where
M. Leßoux missed a note.
Basically, the piece was
well-played, and Maestro Ozawa
directed Mahler as well as George
Solti does, and that is all Solti
does.
But perhaps we should not
expect a unity in the orchestra,
since nearly every symphony
orchestra must hire extras to fill
the stage. In summation, let me
aver that eight horns do not stay
in tune any better than four,
although they can be heard better
in the upper balcony.
Young Cellist
The main feature Wednesday
evening was the debut with a
major orchestra of Yo-Yo Ma, a
slight, 14-year-old cellist from
Paris.
It always seems impressive
when a child (or adolescent)
strides onto the stage, not much
larger than his instrument, and
begins to play honest-to-goodness
music. We should keep in mind,
however, that as a general rule, if
a soloist has not made a concert
debut before puberty, and a major
performance before he can vote,
he is unlikely to ever become a
soloist of the first rank.

Basically, this is because when
the first ten years of study come
very early, learning is much
quicker, devotion to the task
stronger and life-style is easily set.
And any child showing significant
musical promise is likely to be so
channeled.
Therefore, we must look on
Yo-Yo Ma as a cellist, not as a
child cellist. His technique was
very good, and it is to his credit
that he chose the demanding
Saint-Saens Cello concerto rather
that a less difficult one. However,
his tone was generally thin and
lacking in the deep resonances
which make the cello the most
empathetic of instruments.
The concert opened with
Mozart's "Divertimento for
Strings, K. 135". As short concert
works, these Mozart pieces are
quite popular, more as a foil to
heroic and emotional works which
are scheduled to follow them in
concert.
In contrast to the mundane
second and third pieces performed
at this concert, the Mozart was
splendidly performed. Although
such small string orchestra works
are not easily heard throughout
the Opera House, the sections
exhibit an ensemble which is not
emulated by the orchestra as a
whole. The violins, violas, celli
and basses of the Symphony
deserve the highest praise.

Paris.
It always seems impressive
when a child (or adolescent)
strides onto the stage, not much
larger than his instrument, and
begins to play honest-to-goodness
music. We should keep in mind,
however, that as a general rule, if
a soloist has not made a concert
debut before puberty, and a major
performance before he can vote,
he is unlikely to ever become a
soloist of the first rank.

Basically, this is because when
the first ten years of study come
very early, learning is much
quicker, devotion to the task
stronger and life-style is easily set.
And any child showing significant
musical promise is likely to be so
channeled.
Therefore, we must look on
Yo-Yo Ma as a cellist, not as a
child cellist. His technique was
very good, and it is to his credit
that he chose the demanding
Saint-Saens Cello concerto rather
that a less difficult one. However,
his tone was generally thin and
lacking in the deep resonances
which make the cello the most
empathetic of instruments.
The concert opened with
Mozart's "Divertimento for
Strings, K. 135". As short concert
works, these Mozart pieces are
quite popular, more as a foil to
heroic and emotional works which
are scheduled to follow them in
concert.
In contrast to the mundane
second and third pieces performed
at this concert, the Mozart was
splendidly performed. Although
such small string orchestra works
are not easily heard throughout
the Opera House, the sections
exhibit an ensemble which is not
emulated by the orchestra as a
whole. The violins, violas, celli
and basses of the Symphony
deserve the highest praise.


YO-YO MA
It seems as if San Francisco
Symphone audiences are getting a
bit too promiscuous with their
approval. Long applause greets
competent performances, and
standing ovations all too often
reward mediocre ones.
Such was the case Wednesday
evening, when at least half the
audience leapt to their feet
following a reasonable, but far
from outstanding performance of
Mahler's uneditied "Symphony
No. 1, 'The Titan'.
Mahler Maligned
I feel that I am in an excellent
position to evaluate the
Symphony's performance, since I
am not suffused by Mahler's
romanticism - in short, I don't like
it. I feel toward Mahler the way
my editor feels towards classical
music in general - it all sounds
pretty much the same.
It has been said of
Shostakovichthat he wrote one
symphony ten times. To that I
would like to add: Mahler wrote
one movement sixty times. It isn't
that Mahler is totally unoriginal;
in fact, he does have any number
of truly creative moments which
he carefully hides in his bouquets
of notes. He destroys the beauty
by overuse and long-windedness;
Mahler is the Hubert Humphrey
of the concert hall.

He speaks, and speaks, and
speaks, saying much the same
things in much the same words. In
his attempts to find the perfect
word, he recites the dictionary. I
wish someone would have bought
him an abridged version.
Contrary to prevaling opinion,
I do not seek to blackball Mahler
from the repetoire. Actually, I
find that one or two experiences
with him per season serves to
heighten my respect for

Beethoven, Mozart and
Stravinsky.
Horns Poor
As I say, I can tell where the
horns are out of tune, where the
strings were dragging, and where
M. Leßoux missed a note.
Basically, the piece was
well-played, and Maestro Ozawa
directed Mahler as well as George
Solti does, and that is all Solti
does.
But perhaps we should not
expect a unity in the orchestra,
since nearly every symphony
orchestra must hire extras to fill
the stage. In summation, let me
aver that eight horns do not stay
in tune any better than four,
although they can be heard better
in the upper balcony.
Young Cellist
The main feature Wednesday
evening was the debut with a
major orchestra of Yo-Yo Ma, a
slight, 14-year-old cellist from
Paris.
