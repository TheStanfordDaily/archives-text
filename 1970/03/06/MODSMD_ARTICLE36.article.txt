# New Techniques For Diagnosis
## 
### 
A new laboratory for rapid and
accurate diagnosis of virus
infections has been established at
Stanford University Hospital.
The diagnostic virology
laboratory, designed to work with
state facilities in Berkeley, is able
to provide service for numerous
hospitals, clinics and physicians in
the Bay Area. The State public
health facilities will be used as a
back-up for the Stanford
laboratory, confirming certain test
results and assisting with
processing that cannot be done
here.
"It will no longer be necessary
for Stanford and other local
medical facilities to send all

specimens to Berkeley for the
diagnosis of a particular viral
infection," says Dr. Thomas C.
Merigan, associate professor of
medicine and director of the
laboratory. "We will now have
many test results in 24 hours and
thus be able to select and begin
proper treatment of the infection
sooner. This will be a direct
benefit to patients."
The initial focus of the
laboratory will be on those viruses
which cause severe infections and
diseases such as viral hepatitis,
rubella (German measles),
shingles, which attack nerves, and
encephalitis, an inflammation of
the brain.
