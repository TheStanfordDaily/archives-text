# New Moratorium Asks Class Audit
## 
### 
The New Moratorium has
urged students to enroll in any of
nine different Army ROTC classes
which are listed in the Spring
Quarter time schedule under
"Military Science."
The courses carry two or three
units academic credit each. The
New Moratorium says that
students can sign the class lists at
registration in the pavilion and
take the courses for full credit.
"The precedent of allowing
non-ROTC students to take the
courses for credit was established
back in 1967," says Michael
Sweeney, a New Moratorium
member. Several students enrolled
in ROTC courses at that time,
and, after a brief controversy,
were allowed to remain. "If
ROTC wants to be a regular
academic program, it has to let
anybody enroll as long as there is
space in the classroom," says
Sweeney.
Col. Stanley Ramey head of
the Army ROTC program refused
comment to the Daily yesterday,
saying only that any registered
Stanford student is eligible for the
courses.
The New Moratorium limited
its target to Army ROTC, and did

not include Navy and Air Force,
because the Army program is now
being debated by faculty and
administration. Navy and Air
Force are waiting to see what
happens to the Army before
deciding whether to continue
their programs here.
Among the Army courses next
quarter are "World Military
History," taught by Capt. Clinton
Anderson, "Command and Staff,"
taught by Maj. C. Darrell
Kirkland, "Principles of War,
Military Leadership and Tactics,"
taght by Capt. Thomas E. Casey,
and "Foundations of National
Power," taught by Lt. Edward K.
Eckert.
Sweeney points out that most
of the classes meet only once or
twice a week, and therefore won't
be a major burden on the students
who wants to find out first hand
what ROTC is like. He also says
that many colorful military
movies are shown.
If the Army tries to limit
enrollment in its classes, the New
Moratorium is asking students to
protest and petition for full
credit, and audit every class
session anyway. "The classrooms
are big," says Sweeney.
