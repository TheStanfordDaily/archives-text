# Students, Employees Protest Dismissal
## 
### ED KOHN 
A group of students at
Florence Moore Dormitory, as
well as an employee group, the
United Stanford Employees
(USE), are fighting for the
reinstatement of a custodian there
fired last month on grounds of
incompetence.
Rio Balcita, the Flo Mo
custodian who was fired Feb. 2,
filed a petition three weeks ago
asking for a hearing on his
dismissal. The grievance hearing
was completed Wednesday;
Balcita's petition was rejected by
Edward A. Scoles, assistant
business manager for University
housing.
The USE announced plans
yesterday for a 12:30 rally today
in White Plaza. Dr. Roland
Finston, who is head of the group,
said that the rally would be held
to present "a public expression of
concern." Student support for the
rally remained unclear last night.
One of the students supporting
Balcita, Louis Araneta, a Flo Mo
freshman, said that Balcita, who
was fired on grounds of
"inefficiency and inability to do
the job assigned," would appeal
Scoles' decision. He said that a
meeting was held last night in Flo
Mo and that the students there
had decided to support Balcita
through his appeal. They also
discussed the possibility of
rehiring Balcita themselves and
paying his salary as well as the
possibility of a rent strike.
Differing Opinions
In his letter to Balcita, Scoles
said:
"Your fellow employees
differed in their opinions of your
work. Some felt that you
performed as well as other
employees, (while) others
described you as slow and not
thorough, even though you
seemed to complete your assigned
work. Students reported no
dissatisfaction with your work
and liked you as a person ..."
. . it is my opinion, based on
all evidence presented, that the
facts support your dismissal.
Despite repeated warnings over

the period of your employment,
you failed to improve your
performance of work on a
sustained basis. I believe that you
were given more than ample
opportunity to improve, but you
chose not to do so. Therefore, it is
my decision to affirm your
dismissal."
Students Testify
About twenty students,
employees and supervisors
testified during the hearing, which
lasted intermittently over four
days. The students represented
Flo Mo and Wilbur, where Balcito
had worked until this fall.
"The reason why the students
are concerned about this matter is
that we had established a
relationship with Rio and that we
feel the reasons for his dismissal
are unjustified," Araneta said.
"We were the direct beneficiaries
of his work and we sincerely had
no complaints about it."
"We are acting because we
know how Rio worked and we
would like to help the other
employees; our action is based on
the fact that Rio was doing his
work completely. We feel that he
has been unjustly fired."
Work Not Stopped
"There was definite criticism of
Rio by supervisors because he
spoke with the students," Finston
said. "They thought that he was
wasting time. We believe that he
was doing his work."
Araneta, who prepared
Balcita's original grievance, said,
"We enjoyed talking with him,
but we never let this keep him
from completing his work. When
we talked to him in the
bathrooms, he would continue
wiping the mirrors and sinks as we
talked."
According to University
grievance procedure, Balcita has
the option of sending an appeal to
Alf E. Brandin, the University's
Vice President for Business, who
will appoint a three-employee
panel to hear the appeal.
However, its decision goes back to
him, and Brandin has the final say
in the matter.

no complaints about it."
"We are acting because we
know how Rio worked and we
would like to help the other
employees; our action is based on
the fact that Rio was doing his
work completely. We feel that he
has been unjustly fired."
Work Not Stopped
"There was definite criticism of
Rio by supervisors because he
spoke with the students," Finston
said. "They thought that he was
wasting time. We believe that he
was doing his work."
Araneta, who prepared
Balcita's original grievance, said,
"We enjoyed talking with him,
but we never let this keep him
from completing his work. When
we talked to him in the
bathrooms, he would continue
wiping the mirrors and sinks as we
talked."
According to University
grievance procedure, Balcita has
the option of sending an appeal to
Alf E. Brandin, the University's
Vice President for Business, who
will appoint a three-employee
panel to hear the appeal.
However, its decision goes back to
him, and Brandin has the final say
in the matter.
A group of students at
Florence Moore Dormitory, as
well as an employee group, the
United Stanford Employees
(USE), are fighting for the
reinstatement of a custodian there
fired last month on grounds of
incompetence.
Rio Balcita, the Flo Mo
custodian who was fired Feb. 2,
filed a petition three weeks ago
asking for a hearing on his
dismissal. The grievance hearing
was completed Wednesday;
Balcita's petition was rejected by
Edward A. Scoles, assistant
business manager for University
housing.
The USE announced plans
yesterday for a 12:30 rally today
in White Plaza. Dr. Roland
Finston, who is head of the group,
said that the rally would be held
to present "a public expression of
concern." Student support for the
rally remained unclear last night.
One of the students supporting
Balcita, Louis Araneta, a Flo Mo
freshman, said that Balcita, who
was fired on grounds of
"inefficiency and inability to do
the job assigned," would appeal
Scoles' decision. He said that a
meeting was held last night in Flo
Mo and that the students there
had decided to support Balcita
through his appeal. They also
discussed the possibility of
rehiring Balcita themselves and
paying his salary as well as the
possibility of a rent strike.
Differing Opinions
In his letter to Balcita, Scoles
said:
"Your fellow employees
differed in their opinions of your
work. Some felt that you
performed as well as other
employees, (while) others
described you as slow and not
thorough, even though you
seemed to complete your assigned
work. Students reported no
dissatisfaction with your work
and liked you as a person ..."
. . it is my opinion, based on
all evidence presented, that the
facts support your dismissal.
Despite repeated warnings over

the period of your employment,
you failed to improve your
performance of work on a
sustained basis. I believe that you
were given more than ample
opportunity to improve, but you
chose not to do so. Therefore, it is
my decision to affirm your
dismissal."
Students Testify
About twenty students,
employees and supervisors
testified during the hearing, which
lasted intermittently over four
days. The students represented
Flo Mo and Wilbur, where Balcito
had worked until this fall.
"The reason why the students
are concerned about this matter is
that we had established a
relationship with Rio and that we
feel the reasons for his dismissal
are unjustified," Araneta said.
"We were the direct beneficiaries
of his work and we sincerely had
no complaints about it."
