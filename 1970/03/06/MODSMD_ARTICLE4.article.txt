# Student Senate Schedules April Fee Proposals Ballot
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
The student Senate last night
sent to its finance committee a
charge to set proposals for next
year's student fees for approval at
the April 15 election.
The committee will meet
Tuesday noon in Tresidder to
discuss the form of the fee vote,
to formulate the bylaws
pertaining to fee elections, and to
recommend a fee.
Under the ASSU constitution
passed last year, students vote on
the size of the fee for the program
budget. For the time being, the
University is paying the ASSU's
operating expenses.
The program budget goes to
support organizations like the
Daily, International Association,
Political Union Board, Special
Events Board, BSU, Mecha, Axe
Command Cardinals Board.
Senate Chairman Dave
Edwards said that the meeting will
be open and that all persons
interested in the size of next
year's budget and the form of the
ballot should attend.
Two Reasons
The matter came to a head last
night because of the closeness of
the election date and Tuesday's
release of the report of the Ad
Hoc Committee on ASSU
finances.
The committee, set up by
President Pitzer last autumn,
clarified the financial sections of
the Constitution. President Pitzer
had accepted the constitution
only on the condition that the

financial conditions be cleared up
by this committee.
The ad hoc committee's
discussions came in the form of a
letter from President Pitzer to
Senate Chairman Edwards, and
the Council of Presidents. The
letter apparently has the force of
amendments to the Constitution.
The Constitution sets forth fee
elections but no method of
voting. Among proposed methods
are allowing the students to
approve or disapprove a set fee or
letting the students pick among
several alternative fees. The fee
must be approved by a majority
vote of the students voting in the
election.
Runoff Election
If no fee or slate of Presidential
candidates receives a majority
vote on April 15 a runoff election
will be held a week later. Also on
the April 15 ballot will be a

iniative sponsored by Harvey
Hukari and the Free Campus
Movement to make membership
in the ASSU voluntary.
The finance committee also has
the responsibility of writing a
report to the student body
explaining the fee election in
detail and the "program
implications/options of the
student vote," according to the ad
hoc committee's report.
President Pitzer also suggested
in the letter to the Senate that an
associate student financial
manager serve for four months.
He would be "a prime candidate"
to succeed the retiring financial
manager. This would necessitate
the substitution of the ASSU
President for the President elect
on the Financial Manager
selection committee.
Good Ncws
President Pitzer's letter

contained some good news:
whatever fee the students vote the
University this year will add
$34,000 of program funds. This
however is a one time transitional
measure.
By-laws committee chairman
John Delany announced that
March 15 is the deadline for
incorporated and by-laws
organizations to submit budgets.
If organizations do not have their
by-laws or incorporation request
in before then will be unable to
submit budgets.
Petitions for President and
Vice-President will be available
March 31 and due April 6.
The Senate presented its
chairman with a gavel on an
engraved plaque honoring him for
his service in the Senate's first
year.

The matter came to a head last
night because of the closeness of
the election date and Tuesday's
release of the report of the Ad
Hoc Committee on ASSU
finances.
The committee, set up by
President Pitzer last autumn,
clarified the financial sections of
the Constitution. President Pitzer
had accepted the constitution
only on the condition that the

financial conditions be cleared up
by this committee.
The ad hoc committee's
discussions came in the form of a
letter from President Pitzer to
Senate Chairman Edwards, and
the Council of Presidents. The
letter apparently has the force of
amendments to the Constitution.
The Constitution sets forth fee
elections but no method of
voting. Among proposed methods
are allowing the students to
approve or disapprove a set fee or
letting the students pick among
several alternative fees. The fee
must be approved by a majority
vote of the students voting in the
election.
Runoff Election
If no fee or slate of Presidential
candidates receives a majority
vote on April 15 a runoff election
will be held a week later. Also on
the April 15 ballot will be a

iniative sponsored by Harvey
Hukari and the Free Campus
Movement to make membership
in the ASSU voluntary.
The finance committee also has
the responsibility of writing a
report to the student body
explaining the fee election in
detail and the "program
implications/options of the
student vote," according to the ad
hoc committee's report.
President Pitzer also suggested
in the letter to the Senate that an
associate student financial
manager serve for four months.
He would be "a prime candidate"
to succeed the retiring financial
manager. This would necessitate
the substitution of the ASSU
President for the President elect
on the Financial Manager
selection committee.
Good Ncws
President Pitzer's letter

contained some good news:
whatever fee the students vote the
University this year will add
$34,000 of program funds. This
however is a one time transitional
measure.
By-laws committee chairman
John Delany announced that
March 15 is the deadline for
incorporated and by-laws
organizations to submit budgets.
If organizations do not have their
by-laws or incorporation request
in before then will be unable to
submit budgets.
Petitions for President and
Vice-President will be available
March 31 and due April 6.
The Senate presented its
chairman with a gavel on an
engraved plaque honoring him for
his service in the Senate's first
year.
The student Senate last night
sent to its finance committee a
charge to set proposals for next
year's student fees for approval at
the April 15 election.
The committee will meet
Tuesday noon in Tresidder to
discuss the form of the fee vote,
to formulate the bylaws
pertaining to fee elections, and to
recommend a fee.
Under the ASSU constitution
passed last year, students vote on
the size of the fee for the program
budget. For the time being, the
University is paying the ASSU's
operating expenses.
The program budget goes to
support organizations like the
Daily, International Association,
Political Union Board, Special
Events Board, BSU, Mecha, Axe
Command Cardinals Board.
Senate Chairman Dave
Edwards said that the meeting will
be open and that all persons
interested in the size of next
year's budget and the form of the
ballot should attend.
