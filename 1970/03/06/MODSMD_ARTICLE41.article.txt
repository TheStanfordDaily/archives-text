# Cal Awaits Band, Cagers
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
In their season finale this
Saturday afternoon, the
undefeated Leland Stanford
Junior University Red Vest Band
will travel to Berkeley to take on
the Cal Straw Hat Band in the
second round of this year's "Big
Toot."
Stanford won a contest earlier
this year at Maples Pavilion
despite underhanded tactics by
the Cal cheerleaders which
included the un-rolling of the now
famous "Stanford Eat Shit" sign.
This sign received national
coverage in The Sporting News in
an article entitled, "Now The
Protesters Are Even Booing
Cheerleaders." In addition the Cal
cheerleading squad suffered the
ultimate defeat when they were
forced into a public apology to
the entire Stanford community.
This earlier musical and
psychological victory will put the
Indian bandsmen in the favorite's
role tomorrow afternoon.
The band returned from their
last road trip to Los Angeles with
clear cut wins over both UCLA
and USC. But leader of the red
vesters, Ken Peterson, says he
does not want the band to feel

over-confident tomorrow.
Against Cal the Cards will
probably go with their usually
successful game plan including
"Back in the USSR", "Heard It
Through The Grapevine," and of
course "Turkey in the Straw Hat
Band." Rumor has it that the Cal
turkeys may again attempt their
infamous rendition of the "1812
Overture" which failed so
miserably at the 1967 Big Game.
The contest will be regionally
televised with Stanford announcer
Don Klein calling the "groovy
vibes." The main supporting act
on the bill will be the Stanford
basketball team. This aggregation
has presented a dramatic story of
pathos up and down the coast this
year on the way to a 5-19 record.
They beat the Cal boys 73-71
earlier this year, but the Bears will
be favored tomorrow.
Seniors Bill Palmer, Steve
Kuchenbecker, Bill Barber, Greg
Osborn and Ed Martin will be
making their final appearance in a
Stanford uniform unless they are
brought up to the front line and
join the band for next season.
According to a Stanford press
release these five are only 40 miles

short of earning their "ONE
HUNDRED THOUSAND MILE
CARDS" for air travel. Rumor has
it that they may be flown on a
charter flight for the 4 2.8 mile
trip to Berkeley so they can
qualify for the most coveted
awards of their career.
One of the few bright spots for
the Cards this year, Claude Terry,
will try to move up on the all-time
Stanford season scoring list. He
stands eighth now with 162 points
and 19.3 average. He is only 20
points short of Ron Tomsic's fifth
place position and with a good
effort he might pass Tomsic. His
running mate Dennis O'Neill
jointed Terry in the "400 Point
Club" with his thirty points last
weekend. O'Neill now has 402
points and a 16.8 average.
In a preliminary to the Band's
performance, the Stanford Frosh
will face the Cal Frosh at 12:00
noon. Stanford won an earlier
game 85-80 in Maples Pavilion.
But since that time Cal has won
11 straight and has a 15 5 season
record. A Stanford win would give
the Papooses a 13-3 record in Bub
Bowling's debut season as
freshman coach.
