# Netters Top Champs Face Utah Today
## 
### 
Coming off decisive wins over
Michigan and San Jose State,
Stanford's powerful tennis team
faces one of its roughest tests of
the year this afternoon as it takes
on fifth-ranked Utah at 2:30 on
the varsity courts.
Utah, defending champions of
the Western Athletic Conference,
will be "one of our three toughest
home matches of the season"
according to Coach Dick Gould,
who figures the Redskins to equal
the prowess of USC and UCLA
who come here next quarter.
Yesterday the Tribe netmen
easily dumped Michigan, two-time
titlists of the Big Ten, 7-2, after
clobbering San Jose State on
Tuesday BV2 to one half.
Utah's top singles player, F.D.
Robbins, who paced the Utes to a
7-2 win over the Tribe last year,
will hook up with Stanford's ace
freshman Roscoe Tanner in what
could be one of the most exciting
duels of the net schedule.
Robbins is ranked among the
nation's top 20 amateurs.
In yesterday's action, Stanford
wrapped up the win in singles
competition, winning 5-1, then
coasted in with a 2-1 decision in
doubles.
Michigan Coach Brian Eisner,
watching his club lose, declared
that Stanford is "much improved"
over last year's team which
finished eighth in the nation.
The Wolverines, who have just
met USC and UCLA (losing 7-2
and getting rained out while
trailing 4-0) indicate that any
weaknesses in the southland
line-ups are few and far between.
Against Michigan, Roscoe
Tanner whipped Jon Mainline 6-4,
6-2 and Rick Fisher put away
Dick Raverby 6-3, 6-2. Wolverine
Joel Ross scored the visitors'
single singles point with a
drawn-out 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 decision

over Rick Evans.
Red hot Rob Rippner burned
veteran Ramon Almonte 6-3, 7-5
and Stanley Pasarell put Stanford
up 4-1 with an easy 6-2, 6-2
decision over senior Bruce
Deßoer. Rookie Gerry
Groslimond rounded out the
Stanford singles superiority by
defeating Dan McLaughlin 8-6,
6-2.
Gould was pleased with his
squad's victory yesterday, but
doesn't care to predict an
outcome today against Utah.
Stanford, Utah, USC, UCLA,
Miami and Trinity of Texas at this
point seem to be the main
contenders for this year's NCAA
title, and Gould prefers to stick
with "cautious optimism" over
the Tribe's chances tomorrow and
beyond.
Utah figures to match Dan
Bleckmger, a quarter-finalist in
last year's NCAA tourney, against
Stanford freshman Rick Fisher.
Other Redskin singles competitors
will be Dale Fritz, Dave Harmon,
Steve Krulevitz (a former junior
Davis Cup member) and Bill
Bennion.
Stanford will alter its line-up
by replacing Pasarell with Chris
Chapin as Pasarell sustained a
minor injury yesterday. Chapin
played an exhibition and smashed
Tim Ott 6-4, 6-2.
Against San Jose State,
Stanford swept the singles and
was on its way to sweeping
everything when rain intervened,
leaving the score BV2 to one half.
Highlight of that match for
Stanford was a doubles revenge by
Fisher and Groslimond who
salvaged a 6-2, 5-5 tie with Chuck
White and Hank Lloyd who had
beaten them earlier at the
Northern California
Intercollegiate tennis
championships.

Stanford won that title last
Sunday with a team score of 31
points, highest in the event's 24
year history. California trailed
with 18 points and San Jose State
compiled 16.
Tanner captured the singles
title by defeating teammate Rob
Rippner, who had upset Cat's

top-seeded Bob Alloo. Rippner
and Tanner then teamed to claim
the doubles title long after the
team title had been decided.
Stanford swept all nine
opening day matches as Rippner,
who Gould called a "big surprise"
turned in a sterling performance
along with Fisher and Evans.

Intercollegiate tennis
championships.

Stanford won that title last
Sunday with a team score of 31
points, highest in the event's 24
year history. California trailed
with 18 points and San Jose State
compiled 16.
Tanner captured the singles
title by defeating teammate Rob
Rippner, who had upset Cat's

top-seeded Bob Alloo. Rippner
and Tanner then teamed to claim
the doubles title long after the
team title had been decided.
Stanford swept all nine
opening day matches as Rippner,
who Gould called a "big surprise"
turned in a sterling performance
along with Fisher and Evans.

Coming off decisive wins over
Michigan and San Jose State,
Stanford's powerful tennis team
faces one of its roughest tests of
the year this afternoon as it takes
on fifth-ranked Utah at 2:30 on
the varsity courts.
Utah, defending champions of
the Western Athletic Conference,
will be "one of our three toughest
home matches of the season"
according to Coach Dick Gould,
who figures the Redskins to equal
the prowess of USC and UCLA
who come here next quarter.
Yesterday the Tribe netmen
easily dumped Michigan, two-time
titlists of the Big Ten, 7-2, after
clobbering San Jose State on
Tuesday BV2 to one half.
Utah's top singles player, F.D.
Robbins, who paced the Utes to a
7-2 win over the Tribe last year,
will hook up with Stanford's ace
freshman Roscoe Tanner in what
could be one of the most exciting
duels of the net schedule.
Robbins is ranked among the
nation's top 20 amateurs.
In yesterday's action, Stanford
wrapped up the win in singles
competition, winning 5-1, then
coasted in with a 2-1 decision in
doubles.
Michigan Coach Brian Eisner,
watching his club lose, declared
that Stanford is "much improved"
over last year's team which
finished eighth in the nation.
The Wolverines, who have just
met USC and UCLA (losing 7-2
and getting rained out while
trailing 4-0) indicate that any
weaknesses in the southland
line-ups are few and far between.
Against Michigan, Roscoe
Tanner whipped Jon Mainline 6-4,
6-2 and Rick Fisher put away
Dick Raverby 6-3, 6-2. Wolverine
Joel Ross scored the visitors'
single singles point with a
drawn-out 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 decision

over Rick Evans.
Red hot Rob Rippner burned
veteran Ramon Almonte 6-3, 7-5
and Stanley Pasarell put Stanford
up 4-1 with an easy 6-2, 6-2
decision over senior Bruce
Deßoer. Rookie Gerry
Groslimond rounded out the
Stanford singles superiority by
defeating Dan McLaughlin 8-6,
6-2.
Gould was pleased with his
squad's victory yesterday, but
doesn't care to predict an
outcome today against Utah.
Stanford, Utah, USC, UCLA,
Miami and Trinity of Texas at this
point seem to be the main
contenders for this year's NCAA
title, and Gould prefers to stick
with "cautious optimism" over
the Tribe's chances tomorrow and
beyond.
Utah figures to match Dan
Bleckmger, a quarter-finalist in
last year's NCAA tourney, against
Stanford freshman Rick Fisher.
Other Redskin singles competitors
will be Dale Fritz, Dave Harmon,
Steve Krulevitz (a former junior
Davis Cup member) and Bill
Bennion.
Stanford will alter its line-up
by replacing Pasarell with Chris
Chapin as Pasarell sustained a
minor injury yesterday. Chapin
played an exhibition and smashed
Tim Ott 6-4, 6-2.
Against San Jose State,
Stanford swept the singles and
was on its way to sweeping
everything when rain intervened,
leaving the score BV2 to one half.
Highlight of that match for
Stanford was a doubles revenge by
Fisher and Groslimond who
salvaged a 6-2, 5-5 tie with Chuck
White and Hank Lloyd who had
beaten them earlier at the
Northern California
Intercollegiate tennis
championships.

contenders for this year's NCAA
title, and Gould prefers to stick
with "cautious optimism" over
the Tribe's chances tomorrow and
beyond.
Utah figures to match Dan
Bleckmger, a quarter-finalist in
last year's NCAA tourney, against
Stanford freshman Rick Fisher.
Other Redskin singles competitors
will be Dale Fritz, Dave Harmon,
Steve Krulevitz (a former junior
Davis Cup member) and Bill
Bennion.
Stanford will alter its line-up
by replacing Pasarell with Chris
Chapin as Pasarell sustained a
minor injury yesterday. Chapin
played an exhibition and smashed
Tim Ott 6-4, 6-2.
Against San Jose State,
Stanford swept the singles and
was on its way to sweeping
everything when rain intervened,
leaving the score BV2 to one half.
Highlight of that match for
Stanford was a doubles revenge by
Fisher and Groslimond who
salvaged a 6-2, 5-5 tie with Chuck
White and Hank Lloyd who had
beaten them earlier at the
Northern California
Intercollegiate tennis
championships.

Stanford won that title last
Sunday with a team score of 31
points, highest in the event's 24
year history. California trailed
with 18 points and San Jose State
compiled 16.
Tanner captured the singles
title by defeating teammate Rob
Rippner, who had upset Cat's

top-seeded Bob Alloo. Rippner
and Tanner then teamed to claim
the doubles title long after the
team title had been decided.
Stanford swept all nine
opening day matches as Rippner,
who Gould called a "big surprise"
turned in a sterling performance
along with Fisher and Evans.
