# Scrum Axe On Line In Berkeley Contest
## 
### 
Cal's rugby Bears get another
swing at the scrum axe in
Berkeley tomorrow amid rumors
that their second attempt will be
as futile as the first, which they
lost 14-12.
The team with the highest total
score gets control of the worthless
symbol which the Bears seem so
intent on winning.
Last week they casually
predicted victory before facing
the strong Indian squad, now 8-1
on the season, and this week
reports filtered down that they

still can't believe they lost.
"They are fast, but I can't
believe they scored that many
points on us," a Cal center told a
red-hot scribe afterward. "A
couple of their tries wore actually
disputable."
Actually, no doubt.
But if Cal found the Tribe fast,
it's unfortunate that the second
game can't be played on a
regulation field where Stanford
could use its speed to maximum
potential.
In Berkeley, you see, they play
rugby in the football stadium
where the turf is 15 yards
narrower than any red-cheeked
Englishman—or any other rugger
for that matter—should be willing
to play on.
Those encroaching sidelines
definitely hampered Stanford's
style last week as ace speedsters
like Jim Kauffman, Jack Schultz
and Jack Lasater just didn't have
maneuvering space to which they
are accustomed.
In a two game such as this one
where the object is to pile up the
biggest score possible, it would
not have hurt the Tribe to run up
another 40 to 50 point total as
they have already done earlier on
a couple of occasions.
"I am confident we will do
better in the second game," said
Bear Coach Doctor Miles Hudson.
"Several guys got bad games out
of their systems (a fine diagnosis,
doctor —ed.) and we know we can
beat them now."
Area fans who wonder if he's
right and who plan to drive up
and see, will be happy to find that
the game starts at 1:30 p.m. in
Memorial Stadium, which holds
70,000.
Tickets are reportedly still
available.
Regardless of the outcome of
scrum axe series, Stanford ruggers
will celebrate the end of the
quarter March 21-22 at the
Monterey Rugby tournament to
be held in Carmel.
The Indians have won it the
last three years in a row. Even if
finals don't create any mental
frustrations or pent-up emotions
which desperately need an outlet,
opposition should be wary
anyway.

for that matter—should be willing
to play on.
Those encroaching sidelines
definitely hampered Stanford's
style last week as ace speedsters
like Jim Kauffman, Jack Schultz
and Jack Lasater just didn't have
maneuvering space to which they
are accustomed.
In a two game such as this one
where the object is to pile up the
biggest score possible, it would
not have hurt the Tribe to run up
another 40 to 50 point total as
they have already done earlier on
a couple of occasions.
"I am confident we will do
better in the second game," said
Bear Coach Doctor Miles Hudson.
"Several guys got bad games out
of their systems (a fine diagnosis,
doctor —ed.) and we know we can
beat them now."
Area fans who wonder if he's
right and who plan to drive up
and see, will be happy to find that
the game starts at 1:30 p.m. in
Memorial Stadium, which holds
70,000.
Tickets are reportedly still
available.
Regardless of the outcome of
scrum axe series, Stanford ruggers
will celebrate the end of the
quarter March 21-22 at the
Monterey Rugby tournament to
be held in Carmel.
The Indians have won it the
last three years in a row. Even if
finals don't create any mental
frustrations or pent-up emotions
which desperately need an outlet,
opposition should be wary
anyway.
Cal's rugby Bears get another
swing at the scrum axe in
Berkeley tomorrow amid rumors
that their second attempt will be
as futile as the first, which they
lost 14-12.
The team with the highest total
score gets control of the worthless
symbol which the Bears seem so
intent on winning.
Last week they casually
predicted victory before facing
the strong Indian squad, now 8-1
on the season, and this week
reports filtered down that they

still can't believe they lost.
"They are fast, but I can't
believe they scored that many
points on us," a Cal center told a
red-hot scribe afterward. "A
couple of their tries wore actually
disputable."
Actually, no doubt.
But if Cal found the Tribe fast,
it's unfortunate that the second
game can't be played on a
regulation field where Stanford
could use its speed to maximum
potential.
In Berkeley, you see, they play
rugby in the football stadium
where the turf is 15 yards
narrower than any red-cheeked
Englishman—or any other rugger
for that matter—should be willing
to play on.
