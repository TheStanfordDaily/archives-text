Four goals by left-winger Paul
Tittmann led the Stanford hockey
team to a 10-5 victory over San
Francisco Tuesday night at
Belmont.
The Indians, now 3-2-2 since
the Christmas break, seemed to
put everything together in their
strongest showing of the season. A
tight forechecking game was the
formula for victory, as the San
Franciscans had severe difficulties
in clearing the puck from their
end of the ice.
Fuller Torrey picked up two
goals and Tim Moyer, Bob Kadlec,
Jan Westerlin and Tom Love one
each. Eddie Leonard notched fcvur

assists. The goaltender was Gary
Aitken.
Stanford plays Belmont at 8
p.m. Tuesday.
An unusual snag has developed
for what appeared to be another
Stanford game on the Oakland
Coliseum Ice. The Indians were
set to take on an Air Force
Academy team prior to the
Oakland - St. Louis game on
March 27, but Stanford has now
learned that the Falcons might
not be able to obtain air
transportation out here from the
Academy brass.
The status of the game was
thus doubtful yesterday.
