## July Draft Lottery Slated 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
lottery drawing to decide the
order ior men to be drafted in
1971 is expected to be held early
in July, Selective Service
headquarters notified the draft
boards yesterday.
At the same time, the boards
were told that it does not appear
that they will have to dip any
deeper into this year's prime draft
pool than number 215.
The notice to boards directs
them to arrange to send to the
examining and entrance stations
numbers 1 through 215, those
classed as 1-A and conscientious
objectors classed 1-A-O and 1-0.
In addition those with numbers
1 through 215 who are expected
to lose their deferments in the
next six months - such as college
students who graduate in June -
are to be given their examinations.
A selective official said these
probably will be arranged on
weekends for those in college so
as not to interfere with classes.
