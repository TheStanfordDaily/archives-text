## Spikers At Occidental 
### 

DISCUS MAN STEVE DAVIS
Stanford's track team—with only one defeat
blemishing its 1970 record —heads south this
weekend for a dual meet with Occidental
Saturday.
The Indians are coming off a strong showing
against powerful San Jose State last week—a meet
Stanford lost 86-67. Tribe coach Payton Jordan
will be returning to the school where he was head
coach from 1946 to 1956.
Last year the Indians defeated Occidental
86-58, but the southerners have a series edge of
9-5 going back to 1951. Among the meet records

vault, where Tribe freshman Casey Carrigan's
personal high would wipe out the 16-2'/4 set by
Oxy's Andy Steben in 1968, the shot put (T.C.
Jones' 57-5 is just a quarter inch shy of a 1960
toss), the 440 relay, the 120 yard high hurdles
(Stanford's Bill Griffith is two tenths of a second
slower than a 12 year-old record), the 440 yard
intermediate hurldes (where Randy White and
Greg Ford will threaten White's 1969 53.4) and
the two mile where Greg Brock and Don Kardong
ran an 8:45.2 last week and the meet record is
9:00.4).
