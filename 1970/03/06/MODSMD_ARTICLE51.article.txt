# Indian Nine Heads South During Break
## 
### 
The varsity baseball team,
which will play eight games in
Southern California over the
spring break, gets back into action
on the local front at San Jose this
afternoon.
The Indians will send senior
righthander Phil Keller against the
San Jose State Spartans in a 3
p.m. game. Stanford will be
seeking its 1 2th win against one
loss.
The Tribe returns home
tomorrow for a doubleheader
against Fresno State College,
starting at noon in Sunken
Diamond. Jim Coate (3-0) and
Steve Dunning (5-0) are the likely
starters, although there's a
possibility that Bruce Schoen
might get a start.
The postponement of
Wednesday's scheduled contest
against Santa Clara has thrown a
small monkey wrench into Coach
Ray Young's pitching plans,
although his difficulties are the
kind most coaches would enjoy.
"We're overloaded with good
pitchers, and they're all ready to
throw," he says.
Clyde King should have such
problems.
Leading hitters for the Tribe
these days are Hank Snider (with
a .422 average), Curt Fant (.400),
Bob Marshall (.353), and Dunning
(.344). Dunning, with three home
runs, is tied with first baseman
Mike Nelson for the team lead in
runs-batted-in, with nine.
Keller, with an impressive 0.69
ERA, leads the pitching staff with
23 strikeouts.
The doubleheader will be the
last games for the Indians until
March 21, when Stanford plays at
Claremont. The Riverside Baseball
Tournament, probably the best
event of its kind in the nation,
will be held the week of March
23-28. Eight teams, including
three which went to the NCAA
playoffs in Omaha last year, will
be present. Stanford will play
NCAA champion Arizona State,
Oregori State, St. John's
University, UC Riverside,
defending tournament champs
USC, Tulsa and Air Force, in that
order.
The first four games will be
played at Riverside's field, and the
last three at nearby Evans Park.
For times and dates, see the sports
calendar.
Stanford will travel with 21
players, including freshman
pitcher Dan Shaw. Shaw had a 2-0
record, with 20 strikeouts going
into yesterday's Brave game with
SJS.
The Braves, meanwhile, have
their own schedule. They play at
USC at 1 p.m. on March 23, at
Long Beach State at 12:30 p.m.
March 24, at Loyola University at
1 p.m. March 25 and a
doubleheader at Pomona against
Cal Poly at noon March 26.

Keller, with an impressive 0.69
ERA, leads the pitching staff with
23 strikeouts.
The doubleheader will be the
last games for the Indians until
March 21, when Stanford plays at
Claremont. The Riverside Baseball
Tournament, probably the best
event of its kind in the nation,
will be held the week of March
23-28. Eight teams, including
three which went to the NCAA
playoffs in Omaha last year, will
be present. Stanford will play
NCAA champion Arizona State,
Oregori State, St. John's
University, UC Riverside,
defending tournament champs
USC, Tulsa and Air Force, in that
order.
The first four games will be
played at Riverside's field, and the
last three at nearby Evans Park.
For times and dates, see the sports
calendar.
Stanford will travel with 21
players, including freshman
pitcher Dan Shaw. Shaw had a 2-0
record, with 20 strikeouts going
into yesterday's Brave game with
SJS.
The Braves, meanwhile, have
their own schedule. They play at
USC at 1 p.m. on March 23, at
Long Beach State at 12:30 p.m.
March 24, at Loyola University at
1 p.m. March 25 and a
doubleheader at Pomona against
Cal Poly at noon March 26.

The varsity baseball team,
which will play eight games in
Southern California over the
spring break, gets back into action
on the local front at San Jose this
afternoon.
The Indians will send senior
righthander Phil Keller against the
San Jose State Spartans in a 3
p.m. game. Stanford will be
seeking its 1 2th win against one
loss.
The Tribe returns home
tomorrow for a doubleheader
against Fresno State College,
starting at noon in Sunken
Diamond. Jim Coate (3-0) and
Steve Dunning (5-0) are the likely
starters, although there's a
possibility that Bruce Schoen
might get a start.
The postponement of
Wednesday's scheduled contest
against Santa Clara has thrown a
small monkey wrench into Coach
Ray Young's pitching plans,
although his difficulties are the
kind most coaches would enjoy.
"We're overloaded with good
pitchers, and they're all ready to
throw," he says.
Clyde King should have such
problems.
Leading hitters for the Tribe
these days are Hank Snider (with
a .422 average), Curt Fant (.400),
Bob Marshall (.353), and Dunning
(.344). Dunning, with three home
runs, is tied with first baseman
Mike Nelson for the team lead in
runs-batted-in, with nine.
Keller, with an impressive 0.69
ERA, leads the pitching staff with
23 strikeouts.
