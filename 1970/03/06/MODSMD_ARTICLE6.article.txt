WASHINGTON (AP) - The
government sued yesterday to set
aside the results of last
December's United Mine Workers
election, charging widespread
irregularities in President W.A.

"Tony" Boyle's re-election
vicotry over the late Joseph A.
"Jock" Yablonski.
Secretary of Labor George P.
Shultz said the Justice
Department filed suit in federal
district court here under the
Landrum-Griffin Act, asking the
court to void the results of the
December balloting and order a
new election.
The suit asked also court
orders to bar the union from
spending money without
reporting to the Labor
Department as required by law;
and to require the keeping of
proper records.
These records, the complaint
said, are to provide the details
from which documents filed with
the Labor Department may be
verified or clarified.
The secretary said the
complaint "grew out of the most
widespread and painstaking
investigation in the history of the
Landrum-Griffen Act," with more
than 200 investigators probing the
election for two months.
