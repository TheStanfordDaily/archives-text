Most people, when it comes to choosing
I a speaker, ask for one of the name brands
I they've heard about.
So when we introduced a new, exclusive
I brand of speakers, the Londonaire, we
j didn't expect them to make of an inroad on
KLH, AR, and our other fine speakers.
Boy, were we surprised!
A lot of people just plain out-and-out pre
fer the sound of the Londonaire. Given a
choice in our sound rooms, they've convinc
ed us that these speakers are even better
than we realized.
That's why wer'e inviting YOU in to hear
these acoustic suspension speaker systems,
I selling from $19.95 to $104.95—and each
a real "sleeper" in its field.
You should hear Londonaire before you
buy!
