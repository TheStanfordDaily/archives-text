# At Reg Ceremonies
## Bureaucracy Reigns 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
At Zenith the quality goes in before the name
goes on. Registration day at Stanford is when
the name goes on before the quality goes in.
It is like no other day. Registration is stability.
In lines, packets, and old ladies in the Pavilion.
It is a day for power to the unpaid parking
ticket. And smiles to friends who vanish until the
next registration.
For a brief moment four times a year, students
have a common purpose. Yesterday they shared it
with the sun and a fresh wind. It was a day for the
environment tables and fading memories of cold
vacations in the East or North.
The Young Republicans co-existed at a table
next to the Progressive Labor Party. The gleaming
smile of Ronald Reagan flashed from an "Effective
Leadership" pamphlet across the walk to a "Yorty
or Reagan? What kind of choice?" sign at the
Unruh desk.
'Relevant' Education
The Free U passed out catalogues offering a
relevant education that the SWOPSI bulletin finds
hard to beat.
Tom Hayden is coming to speak. So is George
Wald.
And the Sailing Club is looking for members.
Inside the Pavilion, bureaucracy is supreme.
Yesterday was no different from Autumn Quarter

registration in 1966, or probably since
Registration was created.
Follow the steps and fear the wrath of God if
your packet is not in order at the final stop. Even
when the money is collected, the cards are sorted
by the final clerk, and the registration stamp is
raised for the ultimate impact, woe to those who
have no advisor's signature.
Bureaucracy Reigns
The bureaucracy envelops the delinquent
student. He will rarely be closer to the real world.
Red tape never changes its color or its ability to
stick.
At Stanford it is practiced to perfection. The
Pavilion is fitted to meet any clannege, including
"Change under $30," and "Change over $30," or
"Exact Amount." Hidden in corners are special
windows: "Military Contracts," and "Bank of
America." The debates and battles of the outside
are suspended in the Pavilion.
The canvas on the old basketball floor never
seems to wear thin.
Why do meal ticket pictures always look like
your spastic cousin?
Finally, remember the Radical Libertarian.
Alliance table. One leaflet cautions against "An
Invasion of YOUR Privacy: The 1970 Census."
"Resist The Census!"
Do they complain about filling out Stanford
information cards?

Red tape never changes its color or its ability to
stick.
At Stanford it is practiced to perfection. The
Pavilion is fitted to meet any clannege, including
"Change under $30," and "Change over $30," or
"Exact Amount." Hidden in corners are special
windows: "Military Contracts," and "Bank of
America." The debates and battles of the outside
are suspended in the Pavilion.
The canvas on the old basketball floor never
seems to wear thin.
Why do meal ticket pictures always look like
your spastic cousin?
Finally, remember the Radical Libertarian.
Alliance table. One leaflet cautions against "An
Invasion of YOUR Privacy: The 1970 Census."
"Resist The Census!"
Do they complain about filling out Stanford
information cards?


ENVELOPING BUREAUCRACY—The bureaucracy
envelops the delinquent student. He will rarely be closer

to the real world. Red tape never manges color or its
ability to stick.
At Zenith the quality goes in before the name
goes on. Registration day at Stanford is when
the name goes on before the quality goes in.
It is like no other day. Registration is stability.
In lines, packets, and old ladies in the Pavilion.
It is a day for power to the unpaid parking
ticket. And smiles to friends who vanish until the
next registration.
For a brief moment four times a year, students
have a common purpose. Yesterday they shared it
with the sun and a fresh wind. It was a day for the
environment tables and fading memories of cold
vacations in the East or North.
The Young Republicans co-existed at a table
next to the Progressive Labor Party. The gleaming
smile of Ronald Reagan flashed from an "Effective
Leadership" pamphlet across the walk to a "Yorty
or Reagan? What kind of choice?" sign at the
Unruh desk.
'Relevant' Education
The Free U passed out catalogues offering a
relevant education that the SWOPSI bulletin finds
hard to beat.
Tom Hayden is coming to speak. So is George
Wald.
And the Sailing Club is looking for members.
Inside the Pavilion, bureaucracy is supreme.
Yesterday was no different from Autumn Quarter

registration in 1966, or probably since
Registration was created.
Follow the steps and fear the wrath of God if
your packet is not in order at the final stop. Even
when the money is collected, the cards are sorted
by the final clerk, and the registration stamp is
raised for the ultimate impact, woe to those who
have no advisor's signature.
