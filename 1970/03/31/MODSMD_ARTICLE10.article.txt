## The 						Mailstrike Blues 
### Art Buchwald 
NEW YORK—There have been
many repercussions over the mail
strike. The most serious is that in
a computer age it's hard to
explain to a computer what a mail
strike is all about.
All large companies bill by
computers, and when the bills are
paid the computers check them
off. For a week now it's been
impossible for computers in New
York to send out bills or to
receive money for outstanding
debts. Therefore, the computers
not concerned with the postal
workers' grievances have become
frustrated and have been venting
their anger on the list of people
stored in their memory banks.
I was in the office of one of
the major credit card companies
in New York last week, and the
manager was in the computer
room trying to talk to the
computers.
The teletype of one computer
kept printing:
"WHERE IS THE MONEY?
WHERE IS THE MONEY?"
Another computer was
printing:
"JAMES IS A DEADBEAT,
JINCKS IS A DEADBEAT, JIST
IS A DEADBEAT, JOHNSON IS
A DEADBEAT, JONES IS A
DEADBEAT, JUNIPER IS A
DEADBEAT"
The manager kept running
from computer to computer
teleprinting, "RESCIND THAT
ORDER." But the computers
were working much faster than
the manager,
I watched him feed into one
machine "THERE IS A POSTAL
STRIKE! DO NOT DO
ANYTHING DRASTIC UNTIL IT
IS OVER "
The machine immediately
responded: "I AM NOT
CONCERNED WITH POSTAL
STRIKE. IP PEOPLE DON'T
PAY THEIR DEBTS, THEY
MUST BE PUNISHED."
The manager rushed to the
next machine whcih was printing

"KING IS A DEADBEAT,
KLOTZ IS A DEADBEAT,
KLUTZ IS A DEADBEAT."
The manager typed out
"THEY ARE NOT DEADBEATS.
THEY'RE VICTIMS OF AN ACT
OF GOD."
The machine printed back "I
DO NOT BELIEVE IN GOD.
LACHMAN IS A DEADBEAT,
LENGEL IS A DEADBEAT,
LONG WORTH IS A
DEADBEAT."
"PLEASE," the manager
teletyped, "DON'T COME TO
ANY CONCLUSIONS WHILE
THE MAILS ARE NOT
WORKING."
"YOU'RE GOING SOFT," the
machine teletyped back. "IF
YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
YOU'LL BE A DEADBEAT
TOO."
The manager was in tears. "I
can't stop them," he said. "We've
trained them to be so efficient
that they won't accept any
excuses. At this rate they're going
to mark everyone who has a credit
card lousy. We'll be out of
business."
A computer was teletyping
"THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE
SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY
ARRESTED AND ALL
PROPERTY CONFISCATED—
PAINE, PEACE, POTTER,
PLUNKETT, PRUNEAU,
PUNTER, RASKIN, ROBERTS,
ROGERS . .
The manager typed back "NO,
NO, NQ NO. THEY'RE
INNOCENT."
The computer typed "GET
YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF
THE KEYS OF MY
TELEPRINTER."
The manager was white. "I
have no choice. To save the
company, I'll have to push the
self-destruct button.
"It's either them or us. He
broke the glass on the wall and
pushed the red button.

There was a thunderous
explosion followed by smoke.
When the smoke cleared, I looked
around. All the computers seemed
to be working. One started
teleprinting "AS I WAS SAYING
BEFORE I WAS INTERRUPTED,
MAYFIELD IS A DEADBEAT,
MINTON IS A DEADBEAT,
MORGAN IS A DEADBEAT,
MULLINS IS A DEADBEAT . . ."
