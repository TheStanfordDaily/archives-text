# The Movement
## ‘Childlike Behavior' 
### Gary Ward 
In October, 1967 there was a
meeting in Czechoslovakia
between forty Americans and two
delegations of Vietnamese
revolutionaries. The majority of
the Americans were younfj and
came from what is now
irrevocably christened the "New
Left."
Some were active in the
antiwar movement, organizing
teach-ins, writing, helping set up
portest groups and fomenting
draft resistance. Others were
working with poor whites and
blacks. They knew relatively little
about Vietnam when they arrived
in Bratislava.
But they all saw the war as an
inevitable by-product of some
sickness in the American system
which could be cured only by
radical political remedies. They
were contemptuous of liberals
who regard the war as a colossal
blunder and who think that when
the war is over America will get
on with rehabilitating a flawed
but redeemable society. For this
reason almost all the young
radicals at Bratislava were scornful
of the traditional "peace
movement" which they regarded
as ideologically naive and
politically ineffective.
It would appear that the
radical activity of the New Left at

Stanford has allowed itself to
fester in these embittered ideas
almost to the point of
ineffectually. An underriding
current of the conference at
Bratislava was the constant desire
for identification with the NLF.
Me too, Stanford.
Spontaneous Revolution
The Vietnamese revolutionaries
at Bratislava were dignified,
restrained, disciplined and
apparently selfless. Compare these
to the loose-tongued, anarchistic,
spontaneous group of
revolutionaries on the Stanford
campus. The two are about as
unlike as any two groups could
conceivably be.
The recent ROTC protest
serves as an example. By the
time the radicals reached history
corner, the military class had
already been dismissed. They ran
scared. Wishful thinking.
'Courage' vs. 'Foolhardiness'
At Bratislava it was easy to
respect the courage and patience
of the Vietnamese and to find
them personally charming, but it
would not be very easy for a
young American to establish an
intimate personal friendship with
or psychological understanding of
such strangers. Nor do I think
most of the Americans at
Bratislava or Stanford would find
life in post-revolutionary Vietnam
congenial.
There is a difference between
courage and foolhardiness and
patience has never been a
characteristic of lately-radical
America. Fire crackers and
marching to an empty classroom -
courageous? The common bond
between the NLF and Stanford
radicals is not a common dream or
a common experience but a
common enemy: The U.S.
government, the system, the
Establishment. The NLF is
succeeding. Stanford's radicals are
not.
It would appear that this

phantasm of union with the
oppressed people of Vietnam is
just that • rich children playing
make-believe with everything
from dirty clothes to flags to
drums. But the worst thing is that
it's even a bad imitation.
Lack ot Authority
The central weakness of the
Stanford radical movement is
their own attitude toward
authority. Most all of these
would-be proletarians are from
permissive upper and
upper-middle class homes. Most
all are unaccustomed to strict
parental control or control of any
kind. Still their whines are almost
monotonous with how little
choice and freedom they have.
Here at Stanford the young
radicals' distrust of all authority
becomes an insuperable problem
for the movement itself. They are
all allergic to leadership, hierarchy
and discipline.
Far from being organized on
these high sounding principles,
they are the results of ineffectual
organizing and pre-pubescent
rebellion against authority.
Perhaps the final effect of this
self-indulgent monopoly on the
truth is that they have succeeded
in alienating the majority of
students on campus. Many
students would like to have ROTC
thrown off campus - at least more
than sixty. But most students are
not willing to play make-believe
with such a real issue. The very
sight of a Vietcong flag did more
to alienate the community than
the movement would dare
conceive possible. The result of all
of this has been a loss of faith in
thability of Stanford's radicals to
carry out any type of effective
mass movement on campus.
The purposes of Stanford's
radicals are high-minded and well
intentioned. But the actual
movement is marred by the
inconsistent, irrational, oftentimes
childlike behavior of its adherents.
