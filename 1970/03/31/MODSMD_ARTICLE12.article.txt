## Spring Comes To Laos 
### Paul Rupert 
As thousands of Stanford students moved into
Dead Week, Finals and Spring Break, thousands of
U.S. troops moved into Laos, Cambodia and New
York City.
In New York the dispute centered around the
dispute between postal workers and the U.S.
Government over the distribution of a chunk of
the national wealth. The postal strike brought
immediate losses to corporations dependent on the
mails, and the President moved swiftly to see that
their mail—and secondarily your Easter check
from Aunt Maggie—moved through the hands and
on the backs of U.S. troops.
The troop call-up served s a reminder to
workers like the traffic controllers, Teamsters and
railroad men—all of whom are in conflicts right
now—that the state would take sides in any
political struggle on the side of the corporations.
The revelation probably came as no surprise to
the Laotians and Cambodians who are allied to the
NLF in Vietnam. The Laotians and Cambodians
have been aiding the Vietnamese struggle for the
control of their national wealth, of their land and
resources, for a long time.
The Crucial Fight
They understand that the i'ighl •against
American corporate and military jontrol of
Vietnam is crucial in determining the future* of
Southeast Asia. What has happen :d in recent
weeks is the expansion of the publicly reported
war to its real parameters: the war for Indochina
and the countries like Thailand and Indonesia
which surround it is now being fought throughout
Indochina, and may well spread rapidly.
While a great many people contend that they
do not know why this war is being fought, the
persistent U.S. and Saigon governments—and their
new ally in Cambodia—have a pretty clear idea.
Last week Saigon promulgated another in the
endless series of "Land Reform Programs" written
by American professors and signed by the reigning
dictator. The program is an attempt to answer the
demands of the peasants for land; it will not work.
Like the programs before it, it will leave control
of the land, the mines and the urban economy of
Vietnam in the hands of local oligarchs, Bank of

America, the military junta, and a host of
corporate johnny-come-latelys.
The demand of the people of Vietnam, and of
the growing popular movements in Laos and
Cambodia, is for control of the farms, the
factories, and their lives. They understand that
they are not free while a small ruling elite, local or
American, determines what will be farmed and
built and mined and how wealth will be
distributed. They have little faith in their
government to do what is best for them, so they
are seizing the land for themselves. We wish them
well.
Walter Cronkite's Enemy
Or at least some of us do. Many students,
faculty and staff I know still see the people Walter
Cronkite calls the "enemy" as the enemy. But
most agree, implicitly, if not explicitly, that we
should get out of Vietnam, and leave it to the
"enemy." The problem is that our feeling about
the war remains a personal opinion. Our
institutions hold, and act on, the basis of a
continued commitment to American war-making.
Stanford is a case in point.
Last Spring at this time, the University was
preparing to sell SRI, and formally remove an
odious part of itself from the possibility of
collective control. During Spring break this year
while we rested or just read about the war in Asia,
Stanford signed the lease for Dillingham's Palo
Alto Square Project and polled its faculty on the
question of keeping ROTC. For a price the
University would gladly lend its resources to a
corporation on the make in Asia and to the army
that exists to protect it from insurgents and
strikes.
The University, as we have found out, is no
more neutral than the State. It does not wish
collective control of its decisions, of its resources.
Fortunately, many students of the war and of
ecology and the mal distribution of the world's
resources recognize that such control must come.
With such awareness, can vacation continue for
long?
