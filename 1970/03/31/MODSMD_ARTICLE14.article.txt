It was before eight when I
walked over to the ticket counter
at Dulles Airport. Itwas early, but
since I was flying standby (now
60 percent fare), and many flight
controllers were on strike, I had
no choice.
"That flight will be boarding at
9:10," the smiling agent told me.
I grimaced and thanked the man;
one doesn't generally board a
flight ten minutes after it's
supposed to leave. "A change of
equipment," he said.
That it was. Instead of the
usual First Class/economy setting,
we were in an all-coach jetliner.
With about 180 seats. All 45 of
us.
I threw my Post into one seat,
my coat into a second, and
plopped into a third, on the
leading edge of one wing.
South to San Francisco'.' 1
We took off at about 9:30
(6:30 Pacific time) and headed
south through the fog, smog and
clouds. Normally, one doesn't fly
to San Francisco via Mississippi,
Texas and New Mexico ("And off
to the left is Albequerque"), but

that's what we had to do to avoid
"congestion," as the pilot neatly
termed the strike.
Albequerque, incidently, is
quite a sight from 35,000 feet.
But look fast; the view to the left
lasts for about fifteen seconds.
From that altitude, it looks as big
as, say, Billings, Montana.
The plane itself was
moderately interesting. Aside
from the extra lavatory (airlines
don't say 'bathroom'), the only
other change was in the reading
material: along with the usual
glossy travel magazine, extolling
the virtues of the St. Louis zoo, a
special booklet, prepared
especially for servicemen and their
families, was in the seatback
compartment (along with the
air-sickness bags). Judging from
the maps in this booklet, the
plane normally saw duty as a
troop carrier—to Vietnam.
Pollutism Jargon
Occasionally the pilot would
point out a tourist attraction as
we zoomed overhead. He was a
great travel guide, but we couldn't
see very much because of the
"industrial smog," as the pilot
called the pollution that was
present from sea to shining sea.
Unfortunately, he neglected to
mention that planes are terrific
polluters in their own right. Every
time a twin- or tri-jet takes off
from National Airport in
Washington (four engine planes
are barred), it deposits an average
of 88 pounds of solid waste,
mostly in the form of unburned
fuel, into the air directly over the
already-filthy Potomac River.
National Airport handles 60
jets per hour during peak hours,
and it's not the busiest. O'Hare,
which was both struck and
snowed in as I headed west,
handles about 90 planes an hour.
Plastic Stewardesses
Our flight continued. Six
hours. Passengers started reading
their magazines for the second
time. The stewardesses sat down,
the plastic faces oozing. Three
young brothers, sitting behind me,
started punching one another,
while their seemingly helpless
mother looked on silently from
across the aisle. The flight they
held tickets for out of San
Francisco had left as we were
(appropriately) over Las Vegas.
Finally, we turned over the
Bay and the mud flats. Almost
home. Grey air, brown water,
visible currents. Home. A
sickening descent over the
"water," a gentle thump, and we
landed.
Waiting for a bus in Redwood
City, two old men started talking.
"Lots of old folks in California,"
said one, who wore a golf hat and
looked about 80.
Smoke and Hack
"Yep, and more arriving all the
time. This place is full of old
people. Where you from?" asked
the other, a spry septagenerian
who alternated between hacking
his guts out and smoking Camels
with gusto.
"Billings, Montana. It's really
cold there."

their magazines for the second
time. The stewardesses sat down,
the plastic faces oozing. Three
young brothers, sitting behind me,
started punching one another,
while their seemingly helpless
mother looked on silently from
across the aisle. The flight they
held tickets for out of San
Francisco had left as we were
(appropriately) over Las Vegas.
Finally, we turned over the
Bay and the mud flats. Almost
home. Grey air, brown water,
visible currents. Home. A
sickening descent over the
"water," a gentle thump, and we
landed.
Waiting for a bus in Redwood
City, two old men started talking.
"Lots of old folks in California,"
said one, who wore a golf hat and
looked about 80.

"Yep, and more arriving all the
time. This place is full of old
people. Where you from?" asked
the other, a spry septagenerian
who alternated between hacking
his guts out and smoking Camels
with gusto.
"Billings, Montana. It's really
cold there."

It was before eight when I
walked over to the ticket counter
at Dulles Airport. Itwas early, but
since I was flying standby (now
60 percent fare), and many flight
controllers were on strike, I had
no choice.
"That flight will be boarding at
9:10," the smiling agent told me.
I grimaced and thanked the man;
one doesn't generally board a
flight ten minutes after it's
supposed to leave. "A change of
equipment," he said.
That it was. Instead of the
usual First Class/economy setting,
we were in an all-coach jetliner.
With about 180 seats. All 45 of
us.
I threw my Post into one seat,
my coat into a second, and
plopped into a third, on the
leading edge of one wing.
South to San Francisco'.' 1
We took off at about 9:30
(6:30 Pacific time) and headed
south through the fog, smog and
clouds. Normally, one doesn't fly
to San Francisco via Mississippi,
Texas and New Mexico ("And off
to the left is Albequerque"), but

that's what we had to do to avoid
"congestion," as the pilot neatly
termed the strike.
Albequerque, incidently, is
quite a sight from 35,000 feet.
But look fast; the view to the left
lasts for about fifteen seconds.
From that altitude, it looks as big
as, say, Billings, Montana.
The plane itself was
moderately interesting. Aside
from the extra lavatory (airlines
don't say 'bathroom'), the only
other change was in the reading
material: along with the usual
glossy travel magazine, extolling
the virtues of the St. Louis zoo, a
special booklet, prepared
especially for servicemen and their
families, was in the seatback
compartment (along with the
air-sickness bags). Judging from
the maps in this booklet, the
plane normally saw duty as a
troop carrier—to Vietnam.
Pollutism Jargon
Occasionally the pilot would
point out a tourist attraction as
we zoomed overhead. He was a
great travel guide, but we couldn't
see very much because of the
"industrial smog," as the pilot
called the pollution that was
present from sea to shining sea.
Unfortunately, he neglected to
mention that planes are terrific
polluters in their own right. Every
time a twin- or tri-jet takes off
from National Airport in
Washington (four engine planes
are barred), it deposits an average
of 88 pounds of solid waste,
mostly in the form of unburned
fuel, into the air directly over the
already-filthy Potomac River.
National Airport handles 60
jets per hour during peak hours,
and it's not the busiest. O'Hare,
which was both struck and
snowed in as I headed west,
handles about 90 planes an hour.

Our flight continued. Six
hours. Passengers started reading
