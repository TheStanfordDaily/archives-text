Wald, Higgins professor of
biology at Harvard University, is
giving the 35th course of Lane
Medical Lectures sponsored by
the Stanford University School of
yesterday, today, and Thursday.
Dr. Wald's lectures will be on
the general subject of "Aspects of
the Chemistry of Vision." Topics
of the remaining talks are:
Tuesday "Human Vision," and
Thursday - "Ontogeny and
Phylogeny at the Molecular
Level."
Noted for work on the
biochemistry of vision since the
early Thirties, Dr. Wald shared the
1967 Nobel Prize for Medicine
and Physiology (for research on
the visual pigments of the eye and
how light affects them).

In 1953 he received the Lasker
Award of the American Public
Health Association "in
recognition of his outstanding
discoveries in biochemistry with
special reference to the changes
associated with vision and the
function of Vitamin A." Dr. Wald
had been the first to identify
Vitamin A in the retina of the
eye, while studying in Germany
following his graduation from
Columbia University (Ph.D.,
1932).
Dr. Wald is a native of New
York City and received the B.S.
degree in zoology from the
Washington Square College of
New York University in 1927. His
professional affiliations include
the National Academy of Sciences
and the American Philosophical
Society. He is a fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences and the Optical Society
of America.
