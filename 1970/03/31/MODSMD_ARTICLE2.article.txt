# Students To Set ASSU Fee, Choose President In Mid-April
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
Students will be asked in
mid-April to elect a student body
president and to set fees to be
paid for the ASSU.
The ballot will include election
of senior class officers and the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC), and a
referendum making membership
in the ASSU (Associated Students
of Stanford University) voluntary.
A special assessment to help fund
the Daily will also be voted on.
Set for April 15 and 16, the
election is in accordance with the
ASSU constitution adopted last
spring. The new regulations allow
students to choose the fee they
wish to assess themselves for
support of ASSU.
According to Student Financial
Manager David Swift, there could
be a list of amounts (i.e. from $0
to $10) and a blank for any other
amount. Students would then
mark which figure they wish to
pay.
Nevertheless, the ballot may
contain fewer choices to facilitate
obtaining a majority for one
figure. The ballot is designed by
the student Senate, but
propositions may be added if
appropriate petitions are
submitted containing signatures of
five percent of the student body.
Special Referenda
The special referendum to
make ASSU membership
voluntary has been placed on the
ballot through petitions circulated
by the Free Campus Movement.
ASSU membership is presently
mandatory for all undergraduates
and graduates, and a three dollar
fee is automatically included in
tuition.
Elections Commissioner Jan
Westfall reported that the
necessary signatures have been
received only for this issue.
Several others, though, will
probably appear on the ballot.
Petitions have been circulated
by the Daily and Special Events
Board to put funding for those
organizations on the ballot as
issues separate from the regular
ASSU fee. The Daily has obtained
more than 900 signatures, but has
not yet submitted the petitions.
Added To Tuition
Special assessments and the
ASSU fee will be added to tuition
and paid on registration day of
each quarter, beginning with Fall

Quarter, 1970. Tuition next year
will be $800 per quarter.
At present, the University
supplies $123,000 from tuition
revenue for operation of the
ASSU office and ASSU programs.
Under the new system, a subsidy
for ASSU office costs will
continue at $90,000. As an
interim measure in 1970-71 the
University will also provide an
additional $34,000 for program
funds.
The student vote in April will
furnish program funds beyond the
$34,000. However, every dollar
voted will not go to the ASSU.
Divisional Associations
Under the new constitution,
half of all program fees are
automatically set aside for
divisional associations
departmental organizations which
students may form (for example,
in the business school or the
political science department.)
Swift reported that present
ASSU programs, excluding the
Daily cost $58,000. To get the
same funds from the student body
of approximately 11,000, a yearly
income of about five dollars
would be necessary. That means

about $1.67 per quarter.
Since half the funds to to
divisional organizations, that
figure would have to be doubled
to provide the funds. This means
students would have to vote a fee
of $3.25 to $3.50 per quarter to
keep present ASSU programs.
Dollar For Daily
The Daily referendum will ask
that one additional dollar per
student per quarter be assessed for
the newspaper. For the past
several years, according to an
ASSU by-law, students have paid
85 cents per quarter. The new
constitutional eliminated this
automatic charge.
The amount asked was
increased to one dollar to
accomodate inflation. It would
also help build financial reserves
for emergencies, like the overtime
costs incurred in covering last
spring's demonstrations.
Money from tuition presently
furnishes about one-fifth of the
Daily's revenue, according to
business manager Jeff Bonzon.
Other expenses are met with
income from advertising.
Annual?
Swift said that the ASSU fee
set in April will hold until another

election is called for. The vote will
not necessarily be an annual
affair, contrary to information
distributed in yesterday's
registration packets by the Dean
of Students office, Swift added.
After the fee is determined,
Swift will estimate what next
year's ASSU income will be. The
student Senate will then allocate
money to groups which have
submitted requests.
Ballot Form
The exact form of the April
ballot will not be decided until
later this week. The Senate will
meet Thursday to decide on a
ballot format and add
propositions.
Friday, Swift and Westfall will
work on a final form, which will
be revised after the April 6
deadline for filing referenda and
candidate petitions.
A majority vote is needed for
passage of referenda, and choosing
a fee assessment and an ASSU
president. A run-off election is
scheduled for April 22 and 23.
Petitions for ASSU and senior
class offices need 15 signatures.
SCLC petitions require 25. All are
available in the ASSU office.

wish to assess themselves for
support of ASSU.
According to Student Financial
Manager David Swift, there could
be a list of amounts (i.e. from $0
to $10) and a blank for any other
amount. Students would then
mark which figure they wish to
pay.
Nevertheless, the ballot may
contain fewer choices to facilitate
obtaining a majority for one
figure. The ballot is designed by
the student Senate, but
propositions may be added if
appropriate petitions are
submitted containing signatures of
five percent of the student body.
Special Referenda
The special referendum to
make ASSU membership
voluntary has been placed on the
ballot through petitions circulated
by the Free Campus Movement.
ASSU membership is presently
mandatory for all undergraduates
and graduates, and a three dollar
fee is automatically included in
tuition.
Elections Commissioner Jan
Westfall reported that the
necessary signatures have been
received only for this issue.
Several others, though, will
probably appear on the ballot.
Petitions have been circulated
by the Daily and Special Events
Board to put funding for those
organizations on the ballot as
issues separate from the regular
ASSU fee. The Daily has obtained
more than 900 signatures, but has
not yet submitted the petitions.
Added To Tuition
Special assessments and the
ASSU fee will be added to tuition
and paid on registration day of
each quarter, beginning with Fall

Quarter, 1970. Tuition next year
will be $800 per quarter.
At present, the University
supplies $123,000 from tuition
revenue for operation of the
ASSU office and ASSU programs.
Under the new system, a subsidy
for ASSU office costs will
continue at $90,000. As an
interim measure in 1970-71 the
University will also provide an
additional $34,000 for program
funds.
The student vote in April will
furnish program funds beyond the
$34,000. However, every dollar
voted will not go to the ASSU.
Divisional Associations
Under the new constitution,
half of all program fees are
automatically set aside for
divisional associations
departmental organizations which
students may form (for example,
in the business school or the
political science department.)
Swift reported that present
ASSU programs, excluding the
Daily cost $58,000. To get the
same funds from the student body
of approximately 11,000, a yearly
income of about five dollars
would be necessary. That means

about $1.67 per quarter.
Since half the funds to to
divisional organizations, that
figure would have to be doubled
to provide the funds. This means
students would have to vote a fee
of $3.25 to $3.50 per quarter to
keep present ASSU programs.
Dollar For Daily
The Daily referendum will ask
that one additional dollar per
student per quarter be assessed for
the newspaper. For the past
several years, according to an
ASSU by-law, students have paid
85 cents per quarter. The new
constitutional eliminated this
automatic charge.
The amount asked was
increased to one dollar to
accomodate inflation. It would
also help build financial reserves
for emergencies, like the overtime
costs incurred in covering last
spring's demonstrations.
Money from tuition presently
furnishes about one-fifth of the
Daily's revenue, according to
business manager Jeff Bonzon.
Other expenses are met with
income from advertising.
Annual?
Swift said that the ASSU fee
set in April will hold until another

election is called for. The vote will
not necessarily be an annual
affair, contrary to information
distributed in yesterday's
registration packets by the Dean
of Students office, Swift added.
After the fee is determined,
Swift will estimate what next
year's ASSU income will be. The
student Senate will then allocate
money to groups which have
submitted requests.
Ballot Form
The exact form of the April
ballot will not be decided until
later this week. The Senate will
meet Thursday to decide on a
ballot format and add
propositions.
Friday, Swift and Westfall will
work on a final form, which will
be revised after the April 6
deadline for filing referenda and
candidate petitions.
A majority vote is needed for
passage of referenda, and choosing
a fee assessment and an ASSU
president. A run-off election is
scheduled for April 22 and 23.
Petitions for ASSU and senior
class offices need 15 signatures.
SCLC petitions require 25. All are
available in the ASSU office.
Students will be asked in
mid-April to elect a student body
president and to set fees to be
paid for the ASSU.
The ballot will include election
of senior class officers and the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC), and a
referendum making membership
in the ASSU (Associated Students
of Stanford University) voluntary.
A special assessment to help fund
the Daily will also be voted on.
Set for April 15 and 16, the
election is in accordance with the
ASSU constitution adopted last
spring. The new regulations allow

ballot through petitions circulated
by the Free Campus Movement.
ASSU membership is presently
mandatory for all undergraduates
and graduates, and a three dollar
fee is automatically included in
tuition.
Elections Commissioner Jan
Westfall reported that the
necessary signatures have been
received only for this issue.
Several others, though, will
probably appear on the ballot.
Petitions have been circulated
by the Daily and Special Events
Board to put funding for those
organizations on the ballot as
issues separate from the regular
ASSU fee. The Daily has obtained
more than 900 signatures, but has
not yet submitted the petitions.
Added To Tuition
Special assessments and the
ASSU fee will be added to tuition
and paid on registration day of
each quarter, beginning with Fall

Quarter, 1970. Tuition next year
will be $800 per quarter.
At present, the University
supplies $123,000 from tuition
revenue for operation of the
ASSU office and ASSU programs.
Under the new system, a subsidy
for ASSU office costs will
continue at $90,000. As an
interim measure in 1970-71 the
University will also provide an
additional $34,000 for program
funds.
The student vote in April will
furnish program funds beyond the
$34,000. However, every dollar
voted will not go to the ASSU.
Divisional Associations
Under the new constitution,
half of all program fees are
automatically set aside for
divisional associations
departmental organizations which
students may form (for example,
in the business school or the
political science department.)
Swift reported that present
ASSU programs, excluding the
Daily cost $58,000. To get the
same funds from the student body
of approximately 11,000, a yearly
income of about five dollars
would be necessary. That means

about $1.67 per quarter.
Since half the funds to to
divisional organizations, that
figure would have to be doubled
to provide the funds. This means
students would have to vote a fee
of $3.25 to $3.50 per quarter to
keep present ASSU programs.
Dollar For Daily
The Daily referendum will ask
that one additional dollar per
student per quarter be assessed for
the newspaper. For the past
several years, according to an
ASSU by-law, students have paid
85 cents per quarter. The new
constitutional eliminated this
automatic charge.
The amount asked was
increased to one dollar to
accomodate inflation. It would
also help build financial reserves
for emergencies, like the overtime
costs incurred in covering last
spring's demonstrations.
Money from tuition presently
furnishes about one-fifth of the
Daily's revenue, according to
business manager Jeff Bonzon.
Other expenses are met with
income from advertising.
Annual?
Swift said that the ASSU fee
set in April will hold until another

election is called for. The vote will
not necessarily be an annual
affair, contrary to information
distributed in yesterday's
registration packets by the Dean
of Students office, Swift added.
After the fee is determined,
Swift will estimate what next
year's ASSU income will be. The
student Senate will then allocate
money to groups which have
submitted requests.
Ballot Form
The exact form of the April
ballot will not be decided until
later this week. The Senate will
meet Thursday to decide on a
ballot format and add
propositions.
Friday, Swift and Westfall will
work on a final form, which will
be revised after the April 6
deadline for filing referenda and
candidate petitions.
A majority vote is needed for
passage of referenda, and choosing
a fee assessment and an ASSU
president. A run-off election is
scheduled for April 22 and 23.
Petitions for ASSU and senior
class offices need 15 signatures.
SCLC petitions require 25. All are
available in the ASSU office.
Students will be asked in
mid-April to elect a student body
president and to set fees to be
paid for the ASSU.
The ballot will include election
of senior class officers and the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC), and a
referendum making membership
in the ASSU (Associated Students
of Stanford University) voluntary.
A special assessment to help fund
the Daily will also be voted on.
Set for April 15 and 16, the
election is in accordance with the
ASSU constitution adopted last
spring. The new regulations allow
students to choose the fee they
wish to assess themselves for
support of ASSU.
According to Student Financial
Manager David Swift, there could
be a list of amounts (i.e. from $0
to $10) and a blank for any other
amount. Students would then
mark which figure they wish to
pay.
Nevertheless, the ballot may
contain fewer choices to facilitate
obtaining a majority for one
figure. The ballot is designed by
the student Senate, but
propositions may be added if
appropriate petitions are
submitted containing signatures of
five percent of the student body.
