# Sweeney, Shoch Charged
## 
### 
Stanford student Jim Shoch
was arrested on suspicion of arson
in connection with the early
morning fire bombing of the Los
Altos home of an engineering
company president on March 21.
Two gasoline filled bottles
were smashed against the garage
door of the Karl W. Widl home at
around 2 a.m. A neighbor
witnessing the incident allegeadly
took the license number of the
bomb thrower's vehicle, which
was traced through registration to
Shoch.
Damage to the garage was
estimated at $200.
Shoch, a political science
student here, was freed from
North Santa Clara County jail on
$1000 bond, which has since been
exonerated. According to Shoch's
attorney, James Wolpman, this
makes Shoch "legally a free man."
No complaint has yet been filed
against Shoch, and the case, which
Wolpman thinks will go to the

grand jury, is still being
investigated. The Santa Clara
County district attorney said
yesterday concerning the case
"Everything is still in limbo at this
point."
Shoch, an SDS member, is one
of the 20 Stanford students fined
and suspended last fall following
the disruption of a trustee's
meeting, and is currently on
probation as a result of last
spring's disturbances at SRI.
Mike Sweeney, a former
Stanford student and editor of the
Chapparul, was arrested on March
9 following a demonstration at
Elma Engineering after University
officials filed a complaint that
Sweeney spray-painted the word
"Vietnam" on a sign in front of
the ROTC building at a February
18 demonstration.
A brief scuffle occurred
between police and demonstrating
radicals as Sweeney was taken
into custody, and he was charged
with resisting arrest in addition to

the University-filed malicious
mischief charges already against
him.
A University spokesman said it
first decided to press charges
against Sweeney rather than turn
the case over to the Stanford
Judicial Council because Sweeney
was not a registered student at the
time of the demonstration.
Although not registered,
however, Sweeney has not yet
graduated, and can still be
considered to be under SJC
jurisdiction for on-campus
activities.
Presidential legal advisor James
Sienna has asked the district
attorney to drop the University's
complaint against Sweeney on the
condition that Sweeney agree to
appear before the SJC. The
district attorney's office has not
indicated yet whether or not the
charge will be dropped.
If the charges against Sweeney
are dismissed, an SJC hearing will
be immediately scheduled.

$1000 bond, which has since been
exonerated. According to Shoch's
attorney, James Wolpman, this
makes Shoch "legally a free man."
No complaint has yet been filed
against Shoch, and the case, which
Wolpman thinks will go to the

grand jury, is still being
investigated. The Santa Clara
County district attorney said
yesterday concerning the case
"Everything is still in limbo at this
point."
Shoch, an SDS member, is one
of the 20 Stanford students fined
and suspended last fall following
the disruption of a trustee's
meeting, and is currently on
probation as a result of last
spring's disturbances at SRI.
Mike Sweeney, a former
Stanford student and editor of the
Chapparul, was arrested on March
9 following a demonstration at
Elma Engineering after University
officials filed a complaint that
Sweeney spray-painted the word
"Vietnam" on a sign in front of
the ROTC building at a February
18 demonstration.
A brief scuffle occurred
between police and demonstrating
radicals as Sweeney was taken
into custody, and he was charged
with resisting arrest in addition to

the University-filed malicious
mischief charges already against
him.
A University spokesman said it
first decided to press charges
against Sweeney rather than turn
the case over to the Stanford
Judicial Council because Sweeney
was not a registered student at the
time of the demonstration.
Although not registered,
however, Sweeney has not yet
graduated, and can still be
considered to be under SJC
jurisdiction for on-campus
activities.
Presidential legal advisor James
Sienna has asked the district
attorney to drop the University's
complaint against Sweeney on the
condition that Sweeney agree to
appear before the SJC. The
district attorney's office has not
indicated yet whether or not the
charge will be dropped.
If the charges against Sweeney
are dismissed, an SJC hearing will
be immediately scheduled.

Stanford student Jim Shoch
was arrested on suspicion of arson
in connection with the early
morning fire bombing of the Los
Altos home of an engineering
company president on March 21.
Two gasoline filled bottles
were smashed against the garage
door of the Karl W. Widl home at
around 2 a.m. A neighbor
witnessing the incident allegeadly
took the license number of the
bomb thrower's vehicle, which
was traced through registration to
Shoch.
Damage to the garage was
estimated at $200.
Shoch, a political science
student here, was freed from
North Santa Clara County jail on
$1000 bond, which has since been
exonerated. According to Shoch's
attorney, James Wolpman, this
makes Shoch "legally a free man."
