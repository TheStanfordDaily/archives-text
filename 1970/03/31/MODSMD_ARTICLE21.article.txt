# Survival Of Universities Threatened, Lyman Claims
## 
### 
Loss of public confidence in
universities is threatening the very
survival of high-quality higher
education, says Stanford

University Provost Richard W.
Lyman.
Failure on the part of its
leaders "to make some clear
distinctions as to the university's
role, and then to take action on
the basis of those distinctions,"
contributes to the crisis.
Asserting "the need to do more
than talk about diversity in
American higher education,"
Lyman said that "colleges and
universities are being subjected to
a deadly and unremitting pressure
from all sides towards conformity
to a single pattern." He labeled as
"very dangerous" the current
attacks on quality higher
education.
"The notion that you can have
a Stanford or Harvard at every
crossroad is quite simply
disastrous. For the attempt to
produce this can only result in
having no Harvards at all, and no
Stanfords. No country, not even
one so unprecedentedly wealthy
that it devours half the world's
output of raw materials annually,
is rich enough either in money or
in human talent to do this."
Lyman noted several signs of
the close of an era in higher
education. The age of general
education has been replaced by a
new age of free electives. Post-war
expansion of advanced research

and graduate education, largely
funded by the federal
government, has begun to wane
and, in fact, there is a "massive
attack on the very concept of
sponsored research."
Other major changes include
the end of in loco parentis,
demands that universities get out
of th ivory towers and become
moi vant," and the fact that
goin college is no longer the
privilege of the few, but "the
right, and very nearly the
obligation, of everyone."
In adapting to these changes
and outside demands, Lyman said,
university administrators must
cease "pretending we can be all
things to all men (for) that way
lies destruction for the quality
institutions."
Lyman, speaking to Stanford
alumni groups around the nation,
warned that higher education, and
in particular quality higher
education, has a very low priority
in Washington.
Alumni understanding and
support is mandatory, he said.
