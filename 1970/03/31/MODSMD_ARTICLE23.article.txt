Kinetic Series
Tresidder is sponsoring the
Kinetic Art Series Wednesday at 8
and 10 in Bishop Auditorium. The
Kinetic Art is a unique series of
film programs, a presentation of
the latest achievements in creative
cinema. The programs present a
diverse group of animated,
experimental, documentary, and
dramatic short films. The
collection of twenty-six short
films (running time 55 seconds to
55 minutes) were gathered from a
dozen recent festivals including
Mannheim, Oberhausen, Cannes
and Venice . . . from
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Yugoslavia, Japan, England and
the United States.
The films, by master film
makers and young unknowns,
were met with enthusiasm and
acclaim at the Kinetic Art World
Premiere in July 1968 at Lincoln
Center. I highly recommend this
series to anyone interested in

seeing the best in international
creative films.
Foreign Flicks
Thursday nights at 8 in
Cubberly, the International
Association continues its program
of outstanding foreign films. The
series will begin this Thursday

with one of the best postwar
Italian films, Luchino Visconti's
"La Terra Trema." This film was
to be the first part of a trilogy
Visconti planned but never
completed.
"La Terra Trema" was filmed
in the Sicilian fishing village of

Acitrezza and concerns the
misfortunes of a native tamily ot
poor fisherman. Visconti's style is
neorealism at its best, exploring
man's fight to live in the face of
the cruelty of nature and of his
fellow man.
Visconti's latest film, "The
Damned," relates the rise of the

Third Reich to the sexual
perversions of the Krupps. It's
quite a contract to his earlier
efforts.
Silent Fridays
Tresidder offers another new
film program—silent movies every
Friday night. April 3, two 1919
D.W. Griffith films will be shown.
"The Musketeers of Pig Alley," a
sixteen minute short starring
Lillian Gish, has been described as
the progenitor of all gangster
films.
"Broken Blossoms," (88
minutes), is one of Griffith's most
widely acclaimed films. It stars
Lilliam Gish, Donald Crisp, and
Richard Barthelmess as a young
Chinese hoping to spread the
peaceful philosophy of his Eastern
religion in London's squalid
Limehouse section.
Disillusionment follows and soon
his only satisfaction is in silent
adoration of a mistreated street
waif (Lilliam Gish) who
periodically is beaten by a sadistic
father (Donald Crisp). Street waif
takes refuge with Chinese
philosopher and . . .
The silent film program will be
shown at Tresidder at 7,8, and 9,
with live piano accompaniment at
the 7 and 9 showings. Admission
is fifty cents.
Sympathy Showing
This Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday Beta Chi is presenting
Jean-Luc Godard's great new film
with the Rolling Stones entitled
"Sympathy for the Devil," also
known as "One Plus One."
Goddard's first English-language
film continues his anarchic
observations of artists in the grip
of impending social revolution.
The basis of the film is a recording
session during which the Stones
reherse the song "Sympathy for
the Devil." Intercut are scenes of
Black Power activists and
intermitent sequences in which
the director's wife, actress Anne
Wiazemski, walks through a
forest, answering a barage of
complex questions with a yes or
no.
There are two versions of
"Sympathy for the
Devil"—Godard's version in which
the song is never heard in its
entirety and the producer's
versions in which "Sympathy for
the Devil" is heard completed in
the final scene. Godard reportedly
stood outside the Cannes Festival
where his unofficial version was
being shown and tried to prevent
people from going inside and
seeing it. Godard opposed any
suggestion that a revolution is ever
finished.
I don't know which versions is
being shown this weekend, but
regardless, don't miss the
opportunity to see what is
considered one of the major films
of the decade. "Sympathy for the
Devil" will be shown Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday at 6, 8, 10,
and 12 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Admission is $2 and worth it.
