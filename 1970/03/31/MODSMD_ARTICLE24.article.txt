# ACT Return A Mixed Success
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
ACT, San Francisco's very own
professional theater company, has
returned to the West after a very
successful run in New York. Right
now, four plays are running in
repertory: "The Importance of
Being Earnest," "Saint Joan,"
"Oedipus Rex," and "Six
Characters in Search for an
Author."
Over the Spring break I
managed to see the latter two, and
I hope that in the near future I, or
someone else on the DAILY staff,
will get a chance to see the others
and let you know if they're worth
your time and money. (Eventually
six plays, in addition to the above
four, will be presented this
season.)
Of the two plays I saw,
Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex" was by
far the more difficult, the more
challenging, the more ambitious,
and the more disappointing.
"Oedipus" was directed by
William Ball himself, and therein
lies most of the problems. Now I
am certainly not going to pretend
to know more about directing or
about the theater than does Mr.
Ball, but I must say that his rather
distinctive directing style leaves
me confused and feeling vaguely
unfulfilled, sort of un-catharsized,
to misquote Aristotle.
Greek theater is damnably hard
to stage, no question about it. For
the Greeks, theater was a religious
event, performed during the day
in an open ampitheater, suffused
with ritual, and much more
formalized than the naturalistic
theater of today.
Direction Difficult
Mr. Ball was faced with the
Herculean task of breathing life
into a 2400-year-old script so that
it would be dramatically
meaningful to an audience
accustomed to Edward Albee and
George Bernard Shaw. What has
emerged from Mr. Ball's
directorial blender is a play which
is not quite Greek, not quite
modern, and, to my way of
thinking, not quite right.
It is formal, almost stilted,
when it should be most exciting;
it is natural, almost offhanded,
when (I think) it should be most
serious and profound. Those
moments of discovery—the most
precious dramatic quality of
Greek theater—are either glossed
over in an apparent attempt at
"realism," or are so overdone as
to be melodramatic.
I don't think that Mr. Ball has
misread or misunderstood
Sophocles—l think he has just
failed to accomplish many of the
things he set out to do when he

decided to put "Oedipus" on the
stage.
Cast Disappointing
I am sorry to say that Mr. Ball
was not helped out much by his
cast. The acting was uneven, and
the night I saw it (the night before
it opened) the actors seemed to
have trouble recalling their lines.
Paul Shenar's Oedipus suffered
from the realistic-formalistic
problems of the entire
production, but he also had
problems all his own. He is never
quite believable as the man who
saved Thebes from the Sphinx, as
the wise and beloved ruler, the
man who in one day is plunged
from royalty to abject misery,
shame, and self-inflicted
blindness. As Oedipus the
Glorious he seems rather pompous
and arbitrary; as Oedipus the
Wretched he is monotonously
pathetic.
Ray Reinhardt has a better
time of it as Creon, but he seems
awfully mean near the end. Carol
Mayo Jenkins plays locaste, the
Queen, with a style that, as nasty
as it sounds, reminded me of a Bel
Air matron at her weekly bridge
club. Maybe it was the make-up.
The only consistently good
performance was by Ken Ruta as
the blind prophet Teiresias. If the
rest of the company were up to
his level this would be a
memorable production.
As a footnote, Ellis Rabb, the
visiting artistic director of the
APA Repertory Company, has the
small but juicy role of the palace
messenger who describes the
blinding of Oedipus. I am sorry to
say that he overacts, and in a style
which is distinctly his own, and
unlike anything else in the play.
Worthwhile
Mr. Ball used a full Greek
chorus—fifteen in all—and
although the attack is sloppy and
they often have trouble staying
together, they are remarkably
good and very exciting to hear
and to watch.
The set by Robert Fletcher is
perhaps the most impressive single
element of the whole production.
Along with Jules Fisher's lighting
it creates a provocative
environment for the telling of a
tragedy.
With all its problems and
shortcomings, I would still
recommend "Oedipus Rex.''
While to my mind Mr. Ball's
production is spotty, it is never
boring, and Greek tragedy is such
a beautiful and rarely performed
theatrical experience that even a
production as imperfect as this
one should be seen, simply
because it's the only one around.

Luigi Pirandello's "Six
Characters in Search of an
Author" is so different from
"Oedipus Rex" that I almost feel
uncomfortable discussing them in
the same review. If I devote less
space to it, it is probably because
it is so much more successful in its
realization.
In "Six Characters . . ACT
has almost reached the top of the
hill. Right now I feel like they are
ninety-five percent there; by the
end of the run they may have
made it.
Strange Play
For those of you who are
unfamiliar with this play, or with
Pirandello, let me say that this is
probably one of the stranger and
more exciting plays to be written
in the last forty years. In it
Pirandello explores the nature of
reality, the nature of the theater,
and the meaning of
existence—heavy topics to be sure,
but treated in a strange, Twilight
Zone atmosphere that makes
chunks of philosophy slide easily
down the auditory canal.
The play concerns an acting
company which is interrupted in
mid-rehearsal by the appearance
of six rather strange people who
insist that they are characters
from an unfinished play, and
would like the use of the stage in
order to act out their drama, and
presumably thereby pass on to
their eternal rest.
These characters exist only in
the context of their play, hence
only on stage, but their fantasy
would is as real to them as our
real world is real to us.
Skill
The whole thing is potentially
a lot of boring and pretentious
claptrap, but Pirandello was a
marvelous playwright and an
impressive thinker. The play in
which the characters exist is a
sordid affair, replete with incest,
prostitution and insanity.
As the horror of these
characters' reality becomes clear
to us, and to the "actors" who
resumably had first right to the
stage, we are sucked in to their
wretched little cosmos, and
almost begin to question the
nature of what is real, to us and to
them. It is an exciting and almost
scary theatrical experience.
The performances are generally
very good. The six characters tend
to overact perhaps even a bit more
than would people who exist only
in a theater-world. The "rvr!"
actors don't really give us the
impression of being actors, which
is rather puzzling. Mark Healey's
direction is clear and consistent.

(The program notes that it is
based on William Ball's original
production.)
Lacks Precision
At this point the show seems
to be a bit weak on acting, and a
bit lacking in the kind of precision
and timing that Mr. Healey's
direction demands and which is
the hallmark of truly first class
theater; but both of these could
come in time, and "Six
Characters . . ." might just make it
to the top of the hill.
Both "Oedipus Rex" at the
Geary Theater, and "Six
Characters in Search of an
Author" at the Marines Memorial
Theater, will be playing in
repertory for the next several
weeks. Write to ACT, 450 Geary
Street, San Francisco 94102 for a

at Tresidder. Student rush tickets
are available just prior to curtain.
