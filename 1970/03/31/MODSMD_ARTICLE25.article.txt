In Salt Lake City • • •
Stanford finished third, behind Indiana and USC, at the NCAA
swimming championships, but the Indians, led by freshman Brian Job,
were responsible for three of the six national records set at the meet.
Job lowered the national standards for both the 100 and 200 yd
breaststrokes and swam a leg on the 400-yd. medley relay team with
John Ferris, Fred Haywood and Steve Carey, a quartet which also set
a new national record. See Doug Wilson's story below.

mythical national championship in the sport. Leon Hartvickson and
Jim Kauffman combined for 1H points to lead Stanford to a 30 0 rout
over the Peninsula Ramblers in the finals. Details in tomorrow's Daily.

the Indians tied for second place, behind USC, at the Riverside
