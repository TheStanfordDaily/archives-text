# Job's Marks Pace Swimmers
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
SALT LAKE CITY The Brian Job
Show, filmed last week at the
NCAA Swimming Championships
in Utah, can be seen this Saturday
on ABC's "Wide World of
Sports."
Job, a Stanford freshman and
America's premier breaststroke
swimmer, was the individual
sensation of the 47th Collegiate
Swimming Championships,
breaking national records five out
of the six times he was in the
water. The Stanford star erased
the 100-yd. breaststroke mark in
morning preliminaries on Friday,
March 26, lowering the NCAA
record set in 1969 by Indiana's
Don McKenzie (:58.3) by
five-tenths of a second.
That evening, Job bettered his
morning time in a new NCAA and
American record :57.6 clocking
while defeating Jim Counsilman
of Indiana, son of the Hoosier
coach who saw his team stroke to
a third straight NCAA title.
Although Stanford had been
aiming for a second-place finish in
the meet, the Indians placed third,
with 206 points, 29 behind USC.
Indiana won the meet with 332.
The Hoosiers were 40 points off
their 1969 margin over USC in a
meet which saw outstanding
performances from some
swimmers and upsets of other
top-ranked tankers.
On The Job
On Saturday, Job repeated his
double record-breaking effort in
the 200-yd. breaststroke.
It was a proud moment for
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran,
who beamed from the side as Job
received his third gold medal of
the meet, standing on the awards
platform inches above third place
teammate Dave Shilling.
The only time Job did not
figure in a record-setting effort
was in the Thursday morning
preliminaries of the 400-yd.
medley relay. However, in the
evening finals of that event, the
Stanford medley relay team of
Job, Fred Haywood, John Ferris
and Steve Carey, which had been
called "the fastest in swimming
history" by USC Coach Peter
Daland a month earlier, lived up
to Daland's prophecy, churning to
a new American, NCAA, and
NCAA meet mark of 3:24.00.

Stanford was thus responsible
for three of the six NCAA marks
which fell at the three-day meet
held for the first time at the new
$2 million natatorium at the
University of Utah. Many
performers were well off their
normal times, notably in the
distance freestyle events.
Commenting on the 4300-ft.
altitude which several participants
pointed out as responsible for the
slowdown, Gaughran said: "I
know it must have had affected a
lot of kids because the times were
much lower than those in last
year's NCAA meet."
In addition to Job and the
Stanford relay, record-setting
performers included two Indiana
freshman: Gary Hall, whose
4:07.3 record in the 400-yd.
individual medley lowered Hans
Fassnacht's 1969 mark by
three-tenths of a second, and
Larry Barbiere, the Indiana
backstroker who erased Charlie
Hickox's '68 mark of :52.0 by a
second's tenth. Another
backstroke ace, Mitch Ivey of Cal.
State at Long Beach, set a new
200-yd. mark of 1:52.77.
Hoosier Upset
The meet's biggest upset came
in the 200-yd. individual medley
in which USE's Frank Heckl and
Stanford's John Ferris both beat
favored Gary Hall of Indiana.
Heckl came up in the last 10 yards
of the final freestyle lap to touch
F'erris by eight-hundredths of a
second for the victory.
Stanford's affable Olympian
was undoubtedly the hard-luck
contestant of the meet: a total of
1.05 seconds separated Ferris
from three gold medals. In
addition to the individual medley
loss, Ferris failed to repeat his
1969 victory in the 200 butterfly,
placing second to UCLA's Mike
Burton by twelve-hundredths of a
second and third to Indiana's
Mark Spitz and Doug Russell of
Texas-Arlington in the 100-yd.
butterfly in the most dramatic
race of the meet.
Spitz, who won three events at
the 1969 NCAA meet in Indiana,
not only failed to defend his title
in the 200 freestyle (won by
Michigan's Juan Bello, an
Olympian from Peru) but lost the
50 free to Tennessee's Dave
Edgar. One official who had

refused to acknowledge Edgar's
supremacy before the race,
conceded "He's for real!" after
the Tennessee flash turned in a
:20.9 victory, failing to break his
own pending NCAA record of
:20.5, set this year in dual meet
competition.
With the 100-yd. butterfly the
only event left for Sport's
Illustratcd's golden boy to go,
tension was high as Spitz, Russell
(who beat Spitz in '68 for the
Olympic gold medal), Ferris and
Bello took the blocks. The meet
announcer had difficulty calming
the excited crowed, heavily
pro-Russell, the Indiana
swimmers, heavily pro-Spitz, the
Mid-western contingent, heavily
pro-Bello, and the Stanford Daily,
heavily pro-Ferris.
Spitz Up
With Russell leading for all but
the last 15 yards, it appeared that
Sports Illustrated was going to be
at a loss for words in its NCAA
article. Spitz, however, put on the
familiar burst of speed at the end
to spoil Russell's final bid foe
victory, and win his first 1970
NCAA title. The Indiana
sophomore was the only
contestant to break the 50-second
barrier, swimming the 100 fly in
:49.82.
Mike Burton of UCLA was the

meet's only triple winner in
individual competition. Burton, a
popular favorite in the swimming
world, beat Colorado State's
distance ace Ralph Button in the
500-yd. freestyle and in the
1650-yd. in addition to
his fingertip win over Ferris in the
200 butterfly.
Double gold-medal winners
included Job, Edgar (who won the
100 free in :46.06), and diver Jim
Henry of Indiana. Besides Spitz,
Henry was the only performer to
successfully defend a 1969 title;
in fact, he defended two of them.
The Hoosier diver won both the
1 -meter title (with Stanford's Bill
Main in fifth), and the 3-meter
crown, an event in which not one
west coast diver managed to
qualify.
Broderick Blazes
Other individual finishers for
Stanford included freshman Tim
Broderick, who placed tenth in
the 500 free, fifth in the 200 free,
and swam on the 800-yd. freestyle
relay which finished sixth in the
finals. In the preliminaries of the
800 relay, Broderick amazed the
national press and spectators alike
with an outstanding
come-from-behind anchor-leg
performance to qualify the
Indians first for the evening finals.
Fred Haywood, who
participated in both freestyle
relays as well as the record-setting
medley relay, failed to defend his
'69 title in the 100 backstroke,
finishing sixth in the event.
Haywood's 11th place finish in
the 200 backstroke marked the
first time this season that the
Stanford captain had been beaten
in the event; Haywood won both
the 100- and 200-yd. backstroke
events at the Pac-8 Championships
in Washington, a meet in which
Ferris also won every event he lost
at Utah, becoming the first Pac-8

swimmer ever to successfully
defend three individual
championships.
Steve Carey and Dave Shilling
rounded out the individual
finishers. Carey, the freshman
anchorman for both the freestyle
and medley relays, was a pleasant
surprise in the 50 free, placing
fifth in a sprint race which saw
such standouts as SMU's Jerry
Heidenreich and Dick Crittenden
of Michigan State fail to make the
championship flights.
Shilling, who placed 12th in
the 200 IM, took third in the
star-studded 200 breaststroke
behind Washington's Rick Colella;
the Stanford sophomore defeated,
among others, defending
champion Mike Dirksen of
Oregon, who was the only
swimmer to beat Shilling in 1969.
Since there are no seniors on
the team, all Stanford varsity
swimmers will be returning next
year.
