# Trackmen Drop Pair

### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's basketball team won
only five of twenty five games,
but Stanford's track team may
achieve an even more porlific dual
meet record. In the last three
weeks following a season opening
87-67 loss to San Jose State,
Stanford has lost to Occidental
73-72, lost to Oregon 1 23'/i to 44
and finished fifth in the Easter
Relays behind Cal, Washington,
San Jose State and powerhouse
Idaho State. The loss to Oregon
was part of a triangular meet in
which Stanford nipped Fresno
State 44-34'/ 2 . And with UCLA,
Oregon State, USC, Washington
and Cal in the weeks ahead,
Fresno State may be Stanford's
only victim.
Although the Indians coach,
political neophyte Payton Jordan,

wants to make no excuses, a giant
injury list has greatly hurt the
Cards. Various injuries have kept
defending Pac-8 hurdle champion
Rich Tipton, Olympic pole vaulter
Casey Carrigan, and team Captain
T.C. Jones from performing up to
par. Sprinters A 1 Dyson and
Chuck Francis and distance man
Brook Thomas have also been
hampered by injuries.
Against Occidental, the meet
went down to the final event, the
mile relay, before the Tigers
pulled it out. Stanford swept the
mile and ran 1-2 in the two mile
but this was countered by an
Occidental sweep in the sprints
and relays. In the decisive mile
relay Oxy ran a 3:13.6 far ahead
of the Indian's 3:24.9.
In the triangular meet against
Oregon and Fresno State,
Stanford had little chance against

an awesome Duck duo. Jordan
called Oregon "one hell of a track
team. It just might be the best
Pac-8 and dual meet team I've
seen in 15 years." Stanford's only
firsts were picked up by triple
jumper Allen Meredith (49-10)
and discuss thrower Steve Davis
(1 76'9").
Last Saturday an undermanned
Indian aggregation could pick up
no firsts and only 19 points in the
Easter Relays. The Cards were far
behind two future dual meet
opponents Cal (62'/2) and
Washington (46Vs>).
This Saturday Stanford will
host UCLA in Stanford Stadium
at 1:15. Last weekend the Bruins
destroyed Midwest powerhouse
Kansas, 99-55. Even at full
strength the Indians will have
little chance against the mighty
Bruins.

called Oregon "one hell of a track
team. It just might be the best
Pac-8 and dual meet team I've
seen in 15 years." Stanford's only
firsts were picked up by triple
jumper Allen Meredith (49-10)
and discuss thrower Steve Davis
(1 76'9").
Last Saturday an undermanned
Indian aggregation could pick up
no firsts and only 19 points in the
Easter Relays. The Cards were far
behind two future dual meet
opponents Cal (62'/2) and
Washington (46Vs>).
This Saturday Stanford will
host UCLA in Stanford Stadium
at 1:15. Last weekend the Bruins
destroyed Midwest powerhouse
Kansas, 99-55. Even at full
strength the Indians will have
little chance against the mighty
Bruins.
Stanford's basketball team won
only five of twenty five games,
but Stanford's track team may
achieve an even more porlific dual
meet record. In the last three
weeks following a season opening
87-67 loss to San Jose State,
Stanford has lost to Occidental
73-72, lost to Oregon 1 23'/i to 44
and finished fifth in the Easter
Relays behind Cal, Washington,
San Jose State and powerhouse
Idaho State. The loss to Oregon
was part of a triangular meet in
which Stanford nipped Fresno
State 44-34'/ 2 . And with UCLA,
Oregon State, USC, Washington
and Cal in the weeks ahead,
Fresno State may be Stanford's
only victim.
Although the Indians coach,
political neophyte Payton Jordan,

wants to make no excuses, a giant
injury list has greatly hurt the
Cards. Various injuries have kept
defending Pac-8 hurdle champion
Rich Tipton, Olympic pole vaulter
Casey Carrigan, and team Captain
T.C. Jones from performing up to
par. Sprinters A 1 Dyson and
Chuck Francis and distance man
Brook Thomas have also been
hampered by injuries.
Against Occidental, the meet
went down to the final event, the
mile relay, before the Tigers
pulled it out. Stanford swept the
mile and ran 1-2 in the two mile
but this was countered by an
Occidental sweep in the sprints
and relays. In the decisive mile
relay Oxy ran a 3:13.6 far ahead
of the Indian's 3:24.9.
In the triangular meet against
Oregon and Fresno State,
Stanford had little chance against

an awesome Duck duo. Jordan
called Oregon "one hell of a track
team. It just might be the best
Pac-8 and dual meet team I've
seen in 15 years." Stanford's only
firsts were picked up by triple
jumper Allen Meredith (49-10)
and discuss thrower Steve Davis
(1 76'9").
