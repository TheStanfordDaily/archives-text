## Cambodia May Ask U.S. Aid 
### 
PHNOM PEHN, Cambodia (AP) -
The new government said Monday
it may ask the United States and
France for military aid-but not
troops-if Viet Cong attacks in
Cambodia become a grave threat
to the nation's neutrality.
But Premier Lon Nol told a
news conference he would leave it
to the United Nations to judge
whether a grave situation existed.
This was not explained further.
The United Nations has stayed
out of hostilities on the
Indochinese peninsula-made up of
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
But Nol's remarks suggested he
may be planning some move to
bring the Cambodian crisis before
the United Nations in New York.
At U.N. headquarters in New
York, Cambodia's charge
d'affaires, Or Kosalak, told a news
conference he will ask

Secretary-General Thant and the
Security Council to bring pressure
for the withdrawal of Viet Cong
and North Vietnamese troops
from Cambodia.
