# Close Faculty Vote Upholds Limited ROTC Credit Option
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The faculty yesterday narrowly
approved a proposal allowing
Army ROTC courses to qualify
for limited academic credit on a
one-year trial basis.
The vote of the mail ballot was
390 for the Army proposal and
373 against.
Under the plan approved, the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) "will consider each
Army course proposal for
academic credit on its academic
merits, with no presumption that
any such proposal will be
accepted." The Army has
indicated that it would request
nine to 1 2 units of credit.
The vote approved the faculty
Senate's Jan. 22 action. The
Senate had approved the Army
proposal but a "faculty petition
requested a review of that
decision by the entire Academic
Council by mail ballot.
The New Moratorium, an
anti-ROTC group announced that
there would be an open discussion

tonight after Tom Hayden's
speech about what should be done
about ROTC. Hayden, a member
of the 'Chicago 7,' is speaking in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 7:30.
All members of the Academic
Council, approximately 1000
professors, were sent ballots in the
referendum. The results originally
were supposed to be announced
late last week but the counting of
ballots was delayed because of the
postal strike.
No Council Membership
The proposal, which will take
effect this fall, eliminates the
Military Science Department in
the School of Humanities and
Sciences and shifts Army ROTC
to a Center for Military Studies,
subordinate to the provost. Army
ROTC instructors will no longer
be members of the Academic
Council but will enjoy privileges
similar to those of University
staff.
The senior commissioned
officer of the Army ROTC unit
will be titled "Director, Center for

Military Studies. He will have the
rights and privileges accorded
faculty members except
membership in the Academic
Council and tenure."
The workings of the entire plan
will be reviewed by the faculty
Senate in one year.
Navy and Air Force ROTC
have indicated that they will use
the Army plan to develop similar
proposals for continuation of
their ROTC programs. Lt. Col.
Leon Heinle, executive head of
Air Force ROTC, said that he is
waiting to see the final document
with its interpretations before
submitting a proposal.
Serious Negotiations
Col. Robert L. Thomas,
executive head of Navy ROTC,
said, "Negotiations will go
forward from this point with the
Navy. The approval of a
mechanism for credit provides a
basis for serious negotiations
which would not have been
possible if the faculty had
reversed the Academic Senate.

"The one point which will be
most difficult [in the
negotiations) will be the status of
ROTC officers, especial the senior
naval officer."
Vice provost Howard Brooks
said that the other ROTC
proposals will be submitted to the
President and the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC,
composed of students and faculty.
If the proposals are identical to
the Army's, according to the
President and the committee, the
President will put the plan into
effect.
Navy Asks 24 Units
If there is any question, the
President will send the proposal
back to the faculty Senate for
approval, according to Brooks.
Brooks said the "sense of the
Senate" calls for a small amount
of credit for Army ROTC courses,
although it is not explicitly called
for in the proposal approved.
Navy ROTC has said that it would
ask for 24 units of credit. Brooks
hinted that the Navy proposal, if
they ask for that much credit,
would be submitted to the faculty
Senate for approval.
Punitive Clause
Michael Sweeney, spokesman
for the New Moratorium,
commented of the faculty vote, "I
hope the faculty enjoyed voting."
President Pitzer, who
recommended very strongly that
the Army plan be approved, said
he was pleased that the Senate
position had been sustained. But
he added, "I am still very much
concerned about the punitive
clauses in individual contracts and
intend to do everything possible
to call attention to this problem
and urge corrective action."
Prof. Harold Kahn, who led
opposition to the Senate action,
said the vote was "very
unfortunate, though expected."
While he did not anticipate the
results would be quite so close, he
said it "suggests the faculty is
celebrating its own castration" in
retaining control over the
University's academic program.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of
Army ROTC, said he expected it
would be about three weeks
before the Army ROTC course
proposals would be in final form
for submission to the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies.

he added, "I am still very much
concerned about the punitive
clauses in individual contracts and
intend to do everything possible
to call attention to this problem
and urge corrective action."
Prof. Harold Kahn, who led
opposition to the Senate action,
said the vote was "very
unfortunate, though expected."
While he did not anticipate the
results would be quite so close, he
said it "suggests the faculty is
celebrating its own castration" in
retaining control over the
University's academic program.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of
Army ROTC, said he expected it
would be about three weeks
before the Army ROTC course
proposals would be in final form
for submission to the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies.
The faculty yesterday narrowly
approved a proposal allowing
Army ROTC courses to qualify
for limited academic credit on a
one-year trial basis.
The vote of the mail ballot was
390 for the Army proposal and
373 against.
Under the plan approved, the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) "will consider each
Army course proposal for
academic credit on its academic
merits, with no presumption that
any such proposal will be
accepted." The Army has
indicated that it would request
nine to 1 2 units of credit.
The vote approved the faculty
Senate's Jan. 22 action. The
Senate had approved the Army
proposal but a "faculty petition
requested a review of that
decision by the entire Academic
Council by mail ballot.
The New Moratorium, an
anti-ROTC group announced that
there would be an open discussion

tonight after Tom Hayden's
speech about what should be done
about ROTC. Hayden, a member
of the 'Chicago 7,' is speaking in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 7:30.
All members of the Academic
Council, approximately 1000
professors, were sent ballots in the
referendum. The results originally
were supposed to be announced
late last week but the counting of
ballots was delayed because of the
postal strike.
No Council Membership
The proposal, which will take
effect this fall, eliminates the
Military Science Department in
the School of Humanities and
Sciences and shifts Army ROTC
to a Center for Military Studies,
subordinate to the provost. Army
ROTC instructors will no longer
be members of the Academic
Council but will enjoy privileges
similar to those of University
staff.
The senior commissioned
officer of the Army ROTC unit
will be titled "Director, Center for

Military Studies. He will have the
rights and privileges accorded
faculty members except
membership in the Academic
Council and tenure."
The workings of the entire plan
will be reviewed by the faculty
Senate in one year.
Navy and Air Force ROTC
have indicated that they will use
the Army plan to develop similar
proposals for continuation of
their ROTC programs. Lt. Col.
Leon Heinle, executive head of
Air Force ROTC, said that he is
waiting to see the final document
with its interpretations before
submitting a proposal.
Serious Negotiations
Col. Robert L. Thomas,
executive head of Navy ROTC,
said, "Negotiations will go
forward from this point with the
Navy. The approval of a
mechanism for credit provides a
basis for serious negotiations
which would not have been
possible if the faculty had
reversed the Academic Senate.

"The one point which will be
most difficult [in the
negotiations) will be the status of
ROTC officers, especial the senior
naval officer."
Vice provost Howard Brooks
said that the other ROTC
proposals will be submitted to the
President and the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC,
composed of students and faculty.
If the proposals are identical to
the Army's, according to the
President and the committee, the
President will put the plan into
effect.
Navy Asks 24 Units
If there is any question, the
President will send the proposal
back to the faculty Senate for
approval, according to Brooks.
Brooks said the "sense of the
Senate" calls for a small amount
of credit for Army ROTC courses,
although it is not explicitly called
for in the proposal approved.
Navy ROTC has said that it would
ask for 24 units of credit. Brooks
hinted that the Navy proposal, if
they ask for that much credit,
would be submitted to the faculty
Senate for approval.
Punitive Clause
Michael Sweeney, spokesman
for the New Moratorium,
commented of the faculty vote, "I
hope the faculty enjoyed voting."
President Pitzer, who
recommended very strongly that
the Army plan be approved, said

Brooks said the "sense of the
Senate" calls for a small amount
of credit for Army ROTC courses,
although it is not explicitly called
for in the proposal approved.
Navy ROTC has said that it would
ask for 24 units of credit. Brooks
hinted that the Navy proposal, if
they ask for that much credit,
would be submitted to the faculty
Senate for approval.
Punitive Clause
Michael Sweeney, spokesman
for the New Moratorium,
commented of the faculty vote, "I
hope the faculty enjoyed voting."
President Pitzer, who
recommended very strongly that
the Army plan be approved, said
he was pleased that the Senate
position had been sustained. But
he added, "I am still very much
concerned about the punitive
clauses in individual contracts and
intend to do everything possible
to call attention to this problem
and urge corrective action."
Prof. Harold Kahn, who led
opposition to the Senate action,
said the vote was "very
unfortunate, though expected."
While he did not anticipate the
results would be quite so close, he
said it "suggests the faculty is
celebrating its own castration" in
retaining control over the
University's academic program.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of
Army ROTC, said he expected it
would be about three weeks
before the Army ROTC course
proposals would be in final form
for submission to the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies.
