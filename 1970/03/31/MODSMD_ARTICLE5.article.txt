# Fijis Drop National Affiliation, University Grants Coed Move
## 
### GREG WHITE 
The University has sanctioned
a move by the Fiji house to
dissolve its ties with the
Phi Gamma Delta national
fraternity and to go coed.
The house's near-unamimous
decision, sharply criticized by
fraternity alumni, is seen as a
partial solution to the local
(Lambda Sigma) chapter's
financial problems.
The Fiji's, who got in trouble
with the administration last
quarter by taking in unauthorized
female boarders, also took this
course, according to past

president Charles White, because
of a long time interest in the
advantages of coed life.
House President Joe Guinta
explained that it was necessary for
Fiji to break national ties because
the Phi Gamma Delta national
constitution expressly prohibits
any of its chapters from having
female residents. Also, "the
Alumni voted to put us in
receivership, but we went local
just prior to that." Receivership
would mean that the alumni have
complete control over all house
operations.
Alumni feeling ran strongly
against the Fiji move, partly
because they had contributed
$250,000 as a gift to the
University to help build the
house. Guinta thinks this feeling is
unfortunate as "we still consider
them members of this house."
The alumni are taking out a pool
table and piano they donated to
the house.
Some Left
Several fraternity members left
last quarter, disagreeing with the
direction that the majority of the
members seemed to be taking.
They and others will be meeting
tonight to form an official
off-campus chapter of Phi Gamma
Delta, under the national
organization.
Scott Reynolds, a spokesman
for this group, say that "there is
no friction between the two
groups. We think both groups are
doing good things".
Reynolds thinks that many
alumni, though not supporting the
move of the majority of members,
understand the reasons involved
and are accepting them.
No Pressure
The new -,'hapter and alumni
are putting .10 pressure on the
University to oust the old
members from their house.
However, the University has
issued a statement assuring the
Fiji national that when and if they
can get a group together to rent
the house they have preference
over any other group.
The decision to go coed is
based on a plan worked up after
Dean of Students Peter Bulkely
threatened last quarter to evict all

residents after it was found four
women were living in the house as
boarders.
The Fiji plan is basically the
same plan under which Stanford's
first coed fraternity, Lambda Nu
operates. According to Assistant
Dean of Students Dan Williams
and Guinta, this consists of going
local, setting up a residence
configuration for women, and
barring a selective rush for
p e males.
The newly local chapter, which
hasn't yet renamed itself, has also
worked out a schedule to repay its
$13,000 debt to the University.
Guinta feels that going coed and
local will make the house "more
relevant to the needs of the
community." He hopes to
persuade other financially
troubled fraternities into
following this lead.
