# 100 Rooms Vacant
## 
### 
Eighty to 100 vacancies now
exist in the University housing
pool, according to Dan Williams,
Assistant Dean of Students in
charge of housing.
This figure represents a
significant reduction in openings
from past spring quarters, when
the drain of overseas campuses,
early graduations and a migrant
trailer population raised the
number of vacancies to about
150.
Williams attributes part of the
reduction to stricter enforcement
of residence agreements which
with few exceptions commit
students to a room obligation for
the entire academic year. Such
agreements, he says, "ought to
mean something."
Spring quarter openings are
concentrated in single sex
residences, particularly on the
Row. Empty beds are almost
certain to exist in Burbank
(Stern), Jordan, Lathrop, Durand,
and Mayfield.
Trailer Openings
Manzanita Park will have fewer
than 10 vacancies, even though
100 students left during Winter

Quarter. Maximum capacity is
460. Most openings are among
men, who comprise three-fourths
of Manzanita's population.
Of the 100 departures, over
half went to overseas campuses. A
large proportion of the remainder
graduated.
A long women's waiting list
will probably completely fill
female trailers, according to Linda
Freis, Manzanita director.
Stanford is attempting to
counteract the planning
complications caused by many
early graduations, varied living
options, and the 55 percent
attendance rate at overseas
campuses. Relevant data on a
migrant Stanford student body is
being computer-stored to aid next
year's residence planning.
