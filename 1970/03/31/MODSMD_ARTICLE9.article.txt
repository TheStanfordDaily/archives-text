# Old Friends
## Come and Gone 
### Nick Selby 
He might have been known by the sobriquet.
"Phantom of the Union," but the epithet tells
only half the story. The other half I never knew,
and now it is too late.
Mark Emerson Bartlett, 21, sometimes known
to friends as "kurtz," died last quarter in a car
accident. Only the day before his death, we had
talked briefly in Tresidder at lunch. Neither of us
realized at the time it would be our last chance to
see each other: I think we had a lot more to say.
I first knew him as a late night television fan.
Deep in the gloom of the Wilbur Halls basement,
when we were freshmen, you could find him every
night glued to the tube, parroting the immortal
words and mannerisms of Gill Hile, the now
departed used car salesman who sponsored and
announced the all-night movies.
The Other Was There
Whenever I was bored or lonely, I went there to
sit with him, to study the movies. We never talked
much, there was no need for it. Each somehow
sensed why the other was there.
The Man at the Piano
During the day, you could almost always find
him in the Union, where he played the old upright
piano that rested in the side rooms before it was
moved. He had a small coterie of appreciative
students, none of them known to him, who would
read along to his dulcet ramblings on the
keyboard. The music spoke of joy and sorrow,
quickening into exuberant life, then falling off
into whispered of hopes and fears.
After they moved the piano, he was more easily
uncovered in the coffee house, where it seemed he
never stopped conversing with whomever
happened by. Many of his friends bore the faces of
Stanford's "radicals." From his frayed, discolored
Army jacket, and by the people he enjoyed talking
with, you could tell there was much in America
and Stanford he did not exactly agree with.

Who knows? Certainly there was much more to
him, as there is to everyone, than I know of now. I
would choose to remember him as thought-ful and
sensitive, a creative dissident who perhaps had not
figured everything in terms of personal profit and
gain. But he never had the chance to write his
epitaph, so how can we know how he wanted to
be remembered, if he did at all?
How Might You Change?
I wonder how our lives might be transformed,
how our relations to others might change, if all of
us realized this day, every today was our last, if we
only had one day left to make amends with our
friends and enemies, with creation.
Perhaps there might be more love, more
concern, more simple tenderness. Would President
Pitzer be so intent on keeping ROTC on campus?
ROTC trains folk to kill. Would provost Howard
Brooks work so hard to cooperate with the
Defense (Attack) Department? Would any of us be
able to laugh, to weep, any more easily? I wonder,
I really wonder at the possibilities.
Luxury of Dreams
But can we allow ourselves the luxury of
dreams, of visions of peace and human fulfillment?
Wondrous defeating life shines on and on, as John
and Yoko tell us, like the moon and the stars and
the sun, on and on. How crushingly reality strikes
us, every morning, every six o'clock news program.
Death speaks worlds about life.
Look ahead to the quarter and the years which
lie before you. What will you do? Will you tell me
about it? An old friend, one of many here I wish I
knew better, is come and gone, sort of like Easter
or the Fourth of July. We pause to think, then
move on, silent and alone, yes mostly unknown.

Perhaps there might be more love, more
concern, more simple tenderness. Would President
Pitzer be so intent on keeping ROTC on campus?
ROTC trains folk to kill. Would provost Howard
Brooks work so hard to cooperate with the
Defense (Attack) Department? Would any of us be
able to laugh, to weep, any more easily? I wonder,
I really wonder at the possibilities.
Luxury of Dreams
But can we allow ourselves the luxury of
dreams, of visions of peace and human fulfillment?
Wondrous defeating life shines on and on, as John
and Yoko tell us, like the moon and the stars and
the sun, on and on. How crushingly reality strikes
us, every morning, every six o'clock news program.
Death speaks worlds about life.
Look ahead to the quarter and the years which
lie before you. What will you do? Will you tell me
about it? An old friend, one of many here I wish I
knew better, is come and gone, sort of like Easter
or the Fourth of July. We pause to think, then
move on, silent and alone, yes mostly unknown.

He might have been known by the sobriquet.
"Phantom of the Union," but the epithet tells
only half the story. The other half I never knew,
and now it is too late.
Mark Emerson Bartlett, 21, sometimes known
to friends as "kurtz," died last quarter in a car
accident. Only the day before his death, we had
talked briefly in Tresidder at lunch. Neither of us
realized at the time it would be our last chance to
see each other: I think we had a lot more to say.
I first knew him as a late night television fan.
Deep in the gloom of the Wilbur Halls basement,
when we were freshmen, you could find him every
night glued to the tube, parroting the immortal
words and mannerisms of Gill Hile, the now
departed used car salesman who sponsored and
announced the all-night movies.
The Other Was There
Whenever I was bored or lonely, I went there to
sit with him, to study the movies. We never talked
much, there was no need for it. Each somehow
sensed why the other was there.
The Man at the Piano
During the day, you could almost always find
him in the Union, where he played the old upright
piano that rested in the side rooms before it was
moved. He had a small coterie of appreciative
students, none of them known to him, who would
read along to his dulcet ramblings on the
keyboard. The music spoke of joy and sorrow,
quickening into exuberant life, then falling off
into whispered of hopes and fears.
After they moved the piano, he was more easily
uncovered in the coffee house, where it seemed he
never stopped conversing with whomever
happened by. Many of his friends bore the faces of
Stanford's "radicals." From his frayed, discolored
Army jacket, and by the people he enjoyed talking
with, you could tell there was much in America
and Stanford he did not exactly agree with.

Who knows? Certainly there was much more to
him, as there is to everyone, than I know of now. I
would choose to remember him as thought-ful and
sensitive, a creative dissident who perhaps had not
figured everything in terms of personal profit and
gain. But he never had the chance to write his
epitaph, so how can we know how he wanted to
be remembered, if he did at all?
How Might You Change?
I wonder how our lives might be transformed,
how our relations to others might change, if all of
us realized this day, every today was our last, if we
only had one day left to make amends with our
friends and enemies, with creation.
Perhaps there might be more love, more
concern, more simple tenderness. Would President
Pitzer be so intent on keeping ROTC on campus?
