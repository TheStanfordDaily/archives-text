On this day in 17S9, the Constitutional Convention
opened in Philadelphia. The new nation nearly ran aground
on the shores of slavery, until North and South united in
the 3/5 compromise that made a slave 60% of a man.
Today, many are critical of the document, and have called
for a second try. We wonder whether Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell
will allow students the remaining 40%.
If you have the truth, the whole truth, so help you (*od.
to report, call the editorial desk at x4632.
If you have a fractional truth to announce, try the
business office at 327-4/50. Thev sell out easily.
