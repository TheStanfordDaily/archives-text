# Thoughts From Florence
## Across An Ocean Dimly 
### FRED MANN 
FLORENCE - Distances can
not always be judged in miles. For
88 Stanford students, fully
prepared for a long stay in
Europe, the lesson is painfully
being learned.
Receiving delayed reports of
spreading insanity in Washington,
murder on campuses, and massive
violence at Stanford itself, people
here are lost in a type of passive
confusion.
America has never been so far
away.
Stanford-in-Italy resides in a
large walled villa in the foothills
overlooking Florence, a city of
beauty and charm. It is spring,
and the flowers are blooming.
Tourists are starting to arrive, and

Commentary

great works of art fill the churches
and galleries. The town is alive but
tranquil. The only discomforts are
the constant strikes and closing
museums.
It is all Robert Walker makes it
out to be - a great place to go to
school.
Mystery
Or so it seemed.
With American overseas
newspapers being inconsistent,
and mail service tied up by strikes,
it was only slowly that those at
Stanford-in-Italy learned of the
ROTC decision and the first rocks
being thrown at home. The
situation was, and still is, a
mystery. The facts were there, but
the atmosphere wasn't. Two week

old Dailies can't tell it all.
People were frustrated. Not
like the frustration of those living
through the tear gas and arrests in
Palo Alto, but in a different, yet
similarly agonizing way. It was a
frustration of now knowing.
Empty Feeling
Why the rocks? Why the cops,
gas, and clubs? The only answers
came in brief wire service
paragraphs in the Daily American,
(a Rome-based rag), under the
heading of "Campus Violence." It
is an empty and helpless feeling to
see your school and your friends
on the front page, leading off the
riot story, and to not be a part of
the situation, on one side or
the other.
Yet in recent days, the
information has become more
clear and the frustration more
intense. Cambodia and Kent
State are actions that are
understood around the world.
"The man is crazy," says one
student. "It's two in the
afternoon now at Stanford. I
wonder what's happening?" asks
another. Some strain to
understand Italian newspaper
accounts. Others go on about
their six month vacation, never
taking notice. Many expect
colleges to explode all across the
distant nation.
No Alternatives
The problem of what to do
personally in response is
compounded, once again, by the
foreign setting. If at home, some
would throw rocks, others would
find strength in numbers at huge

demonstrations, and still more
would sit and watch Walter
Cronkite and simply brood. Such
alternatives are not available in
Italy.
Frustration grows.
For the majority of students,
the beauty of the Michelangelo's
and the Donatello's is paled by
thought of home. The news makes
one wonder if there is anything
worth coming back for.
Some resort to long distance
telephone calls home to better
understand the situation. But
most calls are too emotional and
high strung to be of much
informative value. Three minutes
goes quickly.
Response
The calculated response is to
picket the American consulate in
Florence, and present a petition
protesting the invasion of
Cambodia. The protest is of
questionable legality, and (most
likely) politically ineffective, but
still, it makes the Florentine
papers and eases some personal
tensions.
Stanford's protest is received
by the consulate, a nervous man
who tactfully explains that Italian
law prohibits such
demonstrations, and then peers
out from his window at the
orderly demonstrators outside.
The police, three jeep loads, sit
listening to music on radios,
watching curiously, and secretly
sympathizing with the students.
(The chief himself admits he
welcomes such protests
personally.)

The sun shines as spectators
stop their bicycles and sit on the
river bank to see the 50
"Americani" complete the signs in
two languages. Even an ambulance
slows to take a look.
It is a 1965 demonstration all
over again. No injuries, no fights,
no hard feelings, no visable
results.
The next step is considered -a
unified march at the heavily
guarded US Embassy in Rome
with American students from
other universities. Even if the
government is beyond recognizing
opposition, peaceful or otherwise,
it will be a useful step to relieve
the frustration of separation felt
by the American abroad.
Helplessness
Students return to their villa,
still bothered and feeling helpless.
A slip of paper has been delivered,
and a symbol has been planted,
but the agony remains. There is
no one to hit, or scream at, or
carry on "rational dialogue" with,
or even embarass. Just guarded
buildings with flags and nameless
men.
People try to imagine an
UGLY without windows. It is
both easy and impossible. Friends
at Stanford write saying they wish
they were here, "away from the
problems."
Life goes on at
Stanford-in-Italy, but the spring
flowers aren't quite as bright.
Confusion and sadness reign on
both sides of the ocean.
