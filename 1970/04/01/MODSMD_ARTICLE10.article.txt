## Doubts About Princeton Plan 
### Tina Swent 
Simply by its operation in
society, the university cannot
avoid taking stands on political
issues. For instance, its funding,
its educational curriculum, its
admissions standards, all reflect
certain social and political
considerations. Therefore, it is not
incompatible with its function
that the university take an active
stance in allowing students to
participate in the workings of the
political system.
In order to preserve both its
academic integrity and its actual
existence, however, the university
must take more than symbolic
action on this issue; it must
provide an effective means of
action which takes in the realities
of the electoral process, and
through which students would
gain a deeper understanding of the
system rather than just superficial
knowledge of party machinery.
I see several disadvantages to
the Princeton Plan. With all the
publicity that the Princeton Plan
has and will receive, the public
might regard the canvassing during
that period simply as an
interesting phenomenon, thus
reducing the effectiveness of such
action.
Students Face Two Problems
The students themselves face at
least two problems: that of
organization and post-election
reactions. Concerning the first —a
workable and extremely efficient
system would have to be available
prior to the beginning of the 2
week period in order to utilize
productively as many students as
possible. The feeling that 2 weeks
of intensive political activity will
guarantee success for particular
candidates whom students choose

to support will be a hard one to
avoid. A loss might result not only
in a sense of failure, but also one
of frustration and despair with the
political system, even more than is
evident now.
The university has a
responsibility to provide a plan
based on realities, not just on
ideals or euphoric concern.
Although the two weeks before
the election may well be the most
important of any 2 week period
during a campaign, no student
should be led to believe that in
those 2 weeks miracles can be
accomplished.
The electoral system is old,
unwieldy in many cases, and slow
to move in almost all cases. To
affect it, to study it, or to use it
requires an extended length of
time. I therefore suggest the
following additions to the
Princeton Plan:
SWOPSI Courses
1. That credit courses be set up
in several departments and/or
SWOPSI to study the election
process or related topics.

2. That there be at least one
professor or graduate student for
each 50 students in the class, to
serve particularly as an organizer
or coordinator for the entire plan.
3. That the class(es) break
down into smaller sections to
work on specific projects, which
could range from research into the
election of 1896, to canvassing for
a particular candidate, to the
effects of opinion polls on the
general public. At least one group
should work to develop an
organizational structure to serve
as a framework for other students
during the 2 week period before
the election.
4. That if a person with certain
specific knowledge wishes to
organize or consult with a group,
he be allowed to sponsor a
project, depending on student
support.
5. That each group present
some sort of evaluation at the end
of the quarter, perhaps with
suggestions for follow-up courses
during the winter quarter.

the election may well be the most
important of any 2 week period
during a campaign, no student
should be led to believe that in
those 2 weeks miracles can be
accomplished.
The electoral system is old,
unwieldy in many cases, and slow
to move in almost all cases. To
affect it, to study it, or to use it
requires an extended length of
time. I therefore suggest the
following additions to the
Princeton Plan:
SWOPSI Courses
1. That credit courses be set up
in several departments and/or
SWOPSI to study the election
process or related topics.

2. That there be at least one
professor or graduate student for
each 50 students in the class, to
serve particularly as an organizer
or coordinator for the entire plan.
3. That the class(es) break
down into smaller sections to
work on specific projects, which
could range from research into the
election of 1896, to canvassing for
a particular candidate, to the
effects of opinion polls on the
general public. At least one group
should work to develop an
organizational structure to serve
as a framework for other students
during the 2 week period before
the election.
4. That if a person with certain
specific knowledge wishes to
organize or consult with a group,
he be allowed to sponsor a
project, depending on student
support.
5. That each group present
some sort of evaluation at the end
of the quarter, perhaps with
suggestions for follow-up courses
during the winter quarter.

Simply by its operation in
society, the university cannot
avoid taking stands on political
issues. For instance, its funding,
its educational curriculum, its
admissions standards, all reflect
certain social and political
considerations. Therefore, it is not
incompatible with its function
that the university take an active
stance in allowing students to
participate in the workings of the
political system.
In order to preserve both its
academic integrity and its actual
existence, however, the university
must take more than symbolic
action on this issue; it must
provide an effective means of
action which takes in the realities
of the electoral process, and
through which students would
gain a deeper understanding of the
system rather than just superficial
knowledge of party machinery.
I see several disadvantages to
the Princeton Plan. With all the
publicity that the Princeton Plan
has and will receive, the public
might regard the canvassing during
that period simply as an
interesting phenomenon, thus
reducing the effectiveness of such
action.
Students Face Two Problems
The students themselves face at
least two problems: that of
organization and post-election
reactions. Concerning the first —a
workable and extremely efficient
system would have to be available
prior to the beginning of the 2
week period in order to utilize
productively as many students as
possible. The feeling that 2 weeks
of intensive political activity will
guarantee success for particular
candidates whom students choose

to support will be a hard one to
avoid. A loss might result not only
in a sense of failure, but also one
of frustration and despair with the
political system, even more than is
evident now.
The university has a
responsibility to provide a plan
based on realities, not just on
ideals or euphoric concern.
