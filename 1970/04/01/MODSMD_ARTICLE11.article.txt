KZSU Editorial
Editor, THE DAILY:
The events in Augusta, Georgia,
which have left six black men
dead are events which all of us
should pay as much attention to
as the recent killing of four white
students at Kent State University.
Of course, the specific
circumstances of the two
incidents were different. However,
both incidents are directly related
to some grave social evils that
exist within this nation.
While the war in Vietnam may
certainly be related to racism, the
killings in Augusta, once again,
bring into sharp focus the
problems of racism at home. We
must be careful not to dismiss
these killings as isolated events.
We must also avoid SOLELY
pointing our fingers at racist
officials in the state of Georgia.
Many forms of much more subtle,
but just as devastating violence are
perpetrated on racial minorities
every day by the normal operating
procedures of our institutions.
The institutions of the society
form a tight web of racism that
strangles the existence of black,
brown and other people of color
by denying education, housing,
food, political power, and the

right to a self-determined culture.
The effects can be manifested in
both physical and psychological
forms. Both the individual and the
group are oppressed by
institutional racism.
The killings in Augusta serve as
a brutal reminder that we cannot
assume that the problems of
racism have been solved. We must
all take action to deal this
deplorable phenomenon, and we
do not have to go to Georgia to
do it. Let's start right here at
home.

ROTC Statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since Monday, May 4, we have
been blocking entrance to the
ROTC-Athletic Bldg., during
normal working hours. Athletic
Dept. personnel have been
permitted to enter during this
time, but those having business
with ROTC have been denied
access. When our strength has
permitted it, this ban has been
extended to the rifle armory
across the street. We have
enthusiastically discussed our
position with anyone who has
been willing, including ROTC
personnel. Tuesday, May 12, we

were declared in violation of the
campus disruption policy. We
made no attempt to conceal our
identity at this time, but refused
to vacate the doorways.
It is not our intent to destroy
this university. It is our intent to
reverse the momentum of a
militarism which seems bound to
destroy us all, creating and
implementing policies which we
utterly condemn and have no
control over. ROTC does not
civilize the military, but is merely
a subservient tool to it. It is a vital
cog in that mindless machine, and
we are determined to end it.
Time is running out for the
world, and for reason. Silent
middle America—epitomized by
the back-to-business-as-usual
approach returned to this week by
so much of the campus—leaves
very little leeway. It tells us that
dissent is permissable so long as
you don't do anything: be
non-violent, pursue "rational
dialogue," and be impotent. The
message is all too clear.
We have taken action. We have
refused to permit ROTC
business-as-usual. We are militant,
and we have persevered for many
long hours now—frustrated,
bored, and sore-assed as we are.
We will continue in our efforts to
close ROTC facilities until some
elusive decision-making body on
this campus acts. ROTC has no
business here, any more than any
other military activity—its
continuance is our complicity in
the destruction of this earth. We
will not partake in it.
The other alternative to
inaction is violence. We still find
that tactic undesirable, though we
are finding it more and more
difficult to defend that position.
In opposing violence, it is
incumbent upon us to find
effective action alternatives. That
may well be an impossible
dilemma.
Off ROTC. Peace.

Staff Role Reply
Editor, THE DAILY:
Certain points raised in Connie
Hill's letter of May 12 about the
role of staff employees in the
University merit comment.
The staff of the University is
made up of individuals with a
great variety of skills, training,
education and experience who
provide administrative, support,
and related services to the
educational and research programs
of the University. The staff has
different kinds of assignments and
responsibilities vis-a-vis the
University than do faculty and
students. As a result, there is a

different body of policy and
procedures applicable to staff
employees.
In the current national crisis,
the University administration has
sought to find the means of
providing staff participation in the
many activities now under way.
The President issued a statement
on May 11 to all staff members on
this subject applicable to the
remainder of the spring quarter,
and it seems appropriate now to
take action within this policy.
Some employees may criticize it
for not being specific to their
particular interests, but as I noted
above, the variety of situations on
the campus make it necessary that
each department and function do
its best to apply the policy in
responding to specific situations.
There was also a point about
the extent of coverage of recent
policy issuances. University policy
applies to all situations in which a
staff member is paid through the
University payrolls. However, it
does not extend to the bookstore,
alumni association, and the
hospital, which are clearly
separate organizations with their
own personnel policies, nor does
it extend to contracts for services,
such as American Building
Maintenance, Canteen services,
and other contractors that are
wholly independent.

Staff Complaint
Editor, The Daily:
I am an employee at Encina.
Recent actions have crystallized
my grievances.
First, there are the students
who have blockaded the entrances
to Encina Hall. They have violated
my rights repeatedly. They
formed no picket line to give
workers the option of respecting
or defying it. They physically
blockaded doors, so that there
was no option—force was the only
lever.

Cambodia is only one in the
series of causes used by the radical
leaders, and the dupes who sat in
the doorways are morally, if not
physically, responsible for the
damage of all kinds done on the
campus. When Cambodia is no
longer the prime issue, there will
be others. This has been publically
promised by the leaders. I do not
know of any protester mature or
courageous enough to assume
responsibility for damages.
Idealism is one of the world's
few hopes, but personal
limitations invite my cynical
reservations. Employees have been
scorned because of their "selfish"
personal concerns when
"thousands are starving and
dying." Meanwhile, I assume few
checks from home or financial
aids are endangered.
This brings me to my second
grievance. A few employees in the
payroll section were allowed to
enter. Those who have been trying
to organize the employees have
seized this opportunity. I am not
employed in the Controller's
Office. I have had to force my
way in, and while working, was
astounded to find that some
students and some union or
ganizers had free access to the
building and were distributing
various leaflets ("labor
donated"—who donated the time,
materials and duplicating
machines?) The union, identifying
with the students, gives us no
support in our rights. I have some
compelling obligations in my job.
This gives the union organizers no
concern, but they were mightily
concerned about their paychecks,
hence assumed the establishment
of a priority and quota for the
employees allowed to enter
Encina.
I will react more favorable
when the students assume the
responsibility for the
consequences of their actions and
the union organizers honestly seek
a better understanding of
Stanford and its employees.
