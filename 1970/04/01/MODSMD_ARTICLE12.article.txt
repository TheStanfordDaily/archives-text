# ASSU Council Plans
## Unclog The Channels 
### Adam Levin Barry Askinas 
The United States is torn by a
crisis of a greater magnitude than
any since the Civil War. Allard
Lowenstein has declared, "We are
at the Valley Forge of the
American spirit." This breakdown
of the system is more serious than
that of the 1930's because then,
at" least, people looked to the
government for a solution. Today,
we have turned away from
Washington, crying for leadership,
and are all too receptive to
manipulative influences.
There has evolved a
fundamental loss of respect and
confidence in the decision-making
process. Those channels which we
have been socialized into
respecting appear clogged. There
is a domino theory operating in
the United States which is
dangerously polarizing our
society. The failure is one of
communication between the
Administration and the youth of
this nation.
The President's only contact
with the student viewpoint is his
interaction with Julie, Tricia, and
David. He, being the product of
two generations of military men,
and the two girls being prissy, and

quite adept at curtsying before
foreign dignitaries, but all three
representing the youth of another
era.
The President, while
campaigning, pledged to listen to
the voices of the dissenters
claiming that they presented one
valid viewpoint. Today, however,
he and the Vice-President have
characterized the voice of dissent
as that of "bums" and of the
Effete snobs who talk too loudly.
Unclog The System
And so, we must choose
must choose our route to unclog
and influence a system which has
remained unresponsive for too
long. But, while doing this we
must be conscious of the fact that
the Administration has
characterized us in such a bad
light that middle America still
stereotypes all students as
"radicals and communists." (To
quote some of our office mail.)
In the past week, the Council
of Presidents has been working in
Washington, New York, and
California to bring the views of
students before middle America.
We have had success in many
quarters.

We have spoken to many
government representatives who
shared views from all sides of the
political fence. Those who have
been siding with the students and
who have up to this time had an
intellectual appreciation of our
position, now have an emotional
appreciation of the depth and
breadth of student despair.
One Of The Few
When we arrived in
Washington, we were one of the
few concerned delegations to the
capital. When we left Washington,
one could hardly walk one block
without encountering another
group of campus representatives.
Offices of our legislators were
clogged with university
delegations. Congressmen,
Senators, and their assistants were
working in shifts to accomodate
the flow of campus visitors.
Senator Williams of New Jersey
reported that the responses he has
received on the Nixon Cambodia
move have run over 95% against
the President.
Fulfilled Promise
We flew to New York to fulfill
a promise that Bob Grant made

that we would fight to get equal
time for student leaders to address
the nation. ABC and NBC are
considering our proposal of one
hour for 5 student leaders from
around the country to address the
people of the U.S.
As a result of our efforts I was
given several minutes to comment
on the Nixon press conference
immediately upon its conclusion
on ABC along with 2 senators and
the President of Ohio University,
which was an un-precedented
occurance for a student, while
Barry was invited to appear on the
NBC special of Sunday night "Our
House Divided."
We have had an impact on the
press and television of the U.S.
The media are finally responding
to student proposals. There was
extensive coverage of the
Washington demonstrations last
weekend. Televised commentaries
such as the ABC presidential
comment, the NBC presentation
on Sunday night, and the
California special program with
the presidents of the UC
campuses, are examples of the
new trend, but we cannot stop
now.
Violence, however, is the one
means of destroying all the
credibility that students have built
up during the past 10 days.
Throughout this nation the
construction workers of New
York are looking like "crazies",
the Vice-President is treading a
more precarious path, and
a,nti-war congressmen are
gathering support.
Change Their Minds
But, as Congressmen Reigle
and ' McCloskey said in
Washington, it is far easier to win
the anti-war funding votes by
changing the minds of a
Congressman's constituency that
it is to change the minds of some
congressmen. This is 1970 and
every Congressman and several
key Senators' heads will be on the
line. A vote on the funding of the
war will provide us with the
names of all those Representatives
who must be ousted.
Stanford's own Congressman,
Gubser, must be defeated;
Murphy must be removed from
Congress. Men like Pete
McCloskey and George Brown
must remain in government.
Barry and I pledge ourselves to
work to see that:
1. There will be a debate
between Congressmen Tunney
and Brown on campus.
2. There will be organized a
group of students to work for the
reelection of Pete McCloskey.

3. There will be a "teach-out"
where students will go out into
the community to explain to
middle America why the war in
Asia is tearing our country apart.
4. There will be a nation-wide
television address by at least five
student leaders from different
sections of the country to convey
the student point of view and
counter the image that the
Vice-President has fostered.
5. Stanford will adopt the
"Princeton Plan" which calls for a
closing of Universities for one
week to ten days before the
November election to permit
students to go out into the
community and to work for those
Congressmen and Senators who
will work for an end to the war.
Congressional Visitors
6. Members of the Congress
will come to the University in the
fall to talk with and spend time
with the students.
The Washington trip gave us
time to do some thinking about
the direction and the priorities of
the nation. This nation must
reverse course before the divisions
become so permanent that its
destruction becomes imminent.
An economic boycott for one day
across the nation is a powerful
instrument for putting the
pressure upon the government and
big business.
It is time to take a stand and
we have.
No Business As Usual
Before 20 million people I
supported the no business as usual
closing of universities on a
voluntary basis to discuss the
issues and to move in constructive
ways to affect the system.
We are committed to working
for more national exposure of the
student viewpoint in an effective
way. Violent acts aimed at the
universities of this nation make
the headlines well before the
constructive efforts of serious
students, and destroys the good
press necessary to dispel the
stereotype of students and
necessary to change the system.
We have openly stated that the
United states must be out of
Cambodia immediately and out of
South east Asia by the end of July
1971. The "wait and see" attitude
of the Administration is being
undermined and legitimate protest
has put the government in such a
corner that the "illusion of
dialogue" is rapidly becoming
legitimate dialogue.

In the past week, the Council
of Presidents has been working in
Washington, New York, and
California to bring the views of
students before middle America.
We have had success in many
quarters.

We have spoken to many
government representatives who
shared views from all sides of the
political fence. Those who have
been siding with the students and
who have up to this time had an
intellectual appreciation of our
position, now have an emotional
appreciation of the depth and
breadth of student despair.
One Of The Few
When we arrived in
Washington, we were one of the
few concerned delegations to the
capital. When we left Washington,
one could hardly walk one block
without encountering another
group of campus representatives.
Offices of our legislators were
clogged with university
delegations. Congressmen,
Senators, and their assistants were
working in shifts to accomodate
the flow of campus visitors.
Senator Williams of New Jersey
reported that the responses he has
received on the Nixon Cambodia
move have run over 95% against
the President.
Fulfilled Promise
We flew to New York to fulfill
a promise that Bob Grant made

that we would fight to get equal
time for student leaders to address
the nation. ABC and NBC are
considering our proposal of one
hour for 5 student leaders from
around the country to address the
people of the U.S.
As a result of our efforts I was
given several minutes to comment
on the Nixon press conference
immediately upon its conclusion
on ABC along with 2 senators and
the President of Ohio University,
which was an un-precedented
occurance for a student, while
Barry was invited to appear on the
NBC special of Sunday night "Our
House Divided."
We have had an impact on the
press and television of the U.S.
The media are finally responding
to student proposals. There was
extensive coverage of the
Washington demonstrations last
weekend. Televised commentaries
such as the ABC presidential
comment, the NBC presentation
on Sunday night, and the
California special program with
the presidents of the UC
campuses, are examples of the
new trend, but we cannot stop
now.
Violence, however, is the one
means of destroying all the
credibility that students have built
up during the past 10 days.
Throughout this nation the
construction workers of New
York are looking like "crazies",
the Vice-President is treading a
more precarious path, and
a,nti-war congressmen are
gathering support.
Change Their Minds
But, as Congressmen Reigle
and ' McCloskey said in
Washington, it is far easier to win
the anti-war funding votes by
changing the minds of a
Congressman's constituency that
it is to change the minds of some
congressmen. This is 1970 and
every Congressman and several
key Senators' heads will be on the
line. A vote on the funding of the
war will provide us with the
names of all those Representatives
who must be ousted.
Stanford's own Congressman,
Gubser, must be defeated;
Murphy must be removed from
Congress. Men like Pete
McCloskey and George Brown
must remain in government.
Barry and I pledge ourselves to
work to see that:
1. There will be a debate
between Congressmen Tunney
and Brown on campus.
2. There will be organized a
group of students to work for the
reelection of Pete McCloskey.

3. There will be a "teach-out"
where students will go out into
the community to explain to
middle America why the war in
Asia is tearing our country apart.
4. There will be a nation-wide
television address by at least five
student leaders from different
sections of the country to convey
the student point of view and
counter the image that the
Vice-President has fostered.
5. Stanford will adopt the
"Princeton Plan" which calls for a
closing of Universities for one
week to ten days before the
November election to permit
students to go out into the
community and to work for those
Congressmen and Senators who
will work for an end to the war.
Congressional Visitors
6. Members of the Congress
will come to the University in the
fall to talk with and spend time
with the students.
The Washington trip gave us
time to do some thinking about
the direction and the priorities of
the nation. This nation must
reverse course before the divisions
become so permanent that its
destruction becomes imminent.
An economic boycott for one day
across the nation is a powerful
instrument for putting the
pressure upon the government and
big business.
It is time to take a stand and
we have.
No Business As Usual
Before 20 million people I
supported the no business as usual
closing of universities on a
voluntary basis to discuss the
issues and to move in constructive
ways to affect the system.
We are committed to working
for more national exposure of the
student viewpoint in an effective
way. Violent acts aimed at the
universities of this nation make
the headlines well before the
constructive efforts of serious
students, and destroys the good
press necessary to dispel the
stereotype of students and
necessary to change the system.
We have openly stated that the
United states must be out of
Cambodia immediately and out of
South east Asia by the end of July
1971. The "wait and see" attitude
of the Administration is being
undermined and legitimate protest
has put the government in such a
corner that the "illusion of
dialogue" is rapidly becoming
legitimate dialogue.
(Adam Levin is a member of
the Council of Presidents and
Barry Askinas is a member of last
year's Council.)
The United States is torn by a
crisis of a greater magnitude than
any since the Civil War. Allard
Lowenstein has declared, "We are
at the Valley Forge of the
American spirit." This breakdown
of the system is more serious than
that of the 1930's because then,
at" least, people looked to the
government for a solution. Today,
we have turned away from
Washington, crying for leadership,
and are all too receptive to
manipulative influences.
There has evolved a
fundamental loss of respect and
confidence in the decision-making
process. Those channels which we
have been socialized into
respecting appear clogged. There
is a domino theory operating in
the United States which is
dangerously polarizing our
society. The failure is one of
communication between the
Administration and the youth of
this nation.
The President's only contact
with the student viewpoint is his
interaction with Julie, Tricia, and
David. He, being the product of
two generations of military men,
and the two girls being prissy, and

quite adept at curtsying before
foreign dignitaries, but all three
representing the youth of another
era.
The President, while
campaigning, pledged to listen to
the voices of the dissenters
claiming that they presented one
valid viewpoint. Today, however,
he and the Vice-President have
characterized the voice of dissent
as that of "bums" and of the
Effete snobs who talk too loudly.
Unclog The System
And so, we must choose
must choose our route to unclog
and influence a system which has
remained unresponsive for too
long. But, while doing this we
must be conscious of the fact that
the Administration has
characterized us in such a bad
light that middle America still
stereotypes all students as
"radicals and communists." (To

such as the ABC presidential
comment, the NBC presentation
on Sunday night, and the
California special program with
the presidents of the UC
campuses, are examples of the
new trend, but we cannot stop
now.
Violence, however, is the one
means of destroying all the
credibility that students have built
up during the past 10 days.
Throughout this nation the
construction workers of New
York are looking like "crazies",
the Vice-President is treading a
more precarious path, and
a,nti-war congressmen are
gathering support.
Change Their Minds
But, as Congressmen Reigle
and ' McCloskey said in
Washington, it is far easier to win
the anti-war funding votes by
changing the minds of a
Congressman's constituency that
it is to change the minds of some
congressmen. This is 1970 and
every Congressman and several
key Senators' heads will be on the
line. A vote on the funding of the
war will provide us with the
names of all those Representatives
who must be ousted.
Stanford's own Congressman,
Gubser, must be defeated;
Murphy must be removed from
Congress. Men like Pete
McCloskey and George Brown
must remain in government.
Barry and I pledge ourselves to
work to see that:
1. There will be a debate
between Congressmen Tunney
and Brown on campus.
2. There will be organized a
group of students to work for the
reelection of Pete McCloskey.

3. There will be a "teach-out"
where students will go out into
the community to explain to
middle America why the war in
Asia is tearing our country apart.
4. There will be a nation-wide
television address by at least five
student leaders from different
sections of the country to convey
the student point of view and
counter the image that the
Vice-President has fostered.
5. Stanford will adopt the
"Princeton Plan" which calls for a
closing of Universities for one
week to ten days before the
November election to permit
students to go out into the
community and to work for those
Congressmen and Senators who
will work for an end to the war.
Congressional Visitors
6. Members of the Congress
will come to the University in the
fall to talk with and spend time
with the students.
The Washington trip gave us
time to do some thinking about
the direction and the priorities of
the nation. This nation must
reverse course before the divisions
become so permanent that its
destruction becomes imminent.
An economic boycott for one day
across the nation is a powerful
instrument for putting the
pressure upon the government and
big business.
It is time to take a stand and
we have.
No Business As Usual
Before 20 million people I
supported the no business as usual
closing of universities on a
voluntary basis to discuss the
issues and to move in constructive
ways to affect the system.
We are committed to working
for more national exposure of the
student viewpoint in an effective
way. Violent acts aimed at the
universities of this nation make
the headlines well before the
constructive efforts of serious
students, and destroys the good
press necessary to dispel the
stereotype of students and
necessary to change the system.
We have openly stated that the
United states must be out of
Cambodia immediately and out of
South east Asia by the end of July
1971. The "wait and see" attitude
of the Administration is being
undermined and legitimate protest
has put the government in such a
corner that the "illusion of
dialogue" is rapidly becoming
legitimate dialogue.
(Adam Levin is a member of
the Council of Presidents and
Barry Askinas is a member of last
year's Council.)
The United States is torn by a
crisis of a greater magnitude than
any since the Civil War. Allard
Lowenstein has declared, "We are
at the Valley Forge of the
American spirit." This breakdown
of the system is more serious than
that of the 1930's because then,
at" least, people looked to the
government for a solution. Today,
we have turned away from
Washington, crying for leadership,
and are all too receptive to
manipulative influences.
There has evolved a
fundamental loss of respect and
confidence in the decision-making
process. Those channels which we
have been socialized into
respecting appear clogged. There
is a domino theory operating in
the United States which is
dangerously polarizing our
society. The failure is one of
communication between the
Administration and the youth of
this nation.
The President's only contact
with the student viewpoint is his
interaction with Julie, Tricia, and
David. He, being the product of
two generations of military men,
and the two girls being prissy, and

quite adept at curtsying before
foreign dignitaries, but all three
representing the youth of another
era.
The President, while
campaigning, pledged to listen to
the voices of the dissenters
claiming that they presented one
valid viewpoint. Today, however,
he and the Vice-President have
characterized the voice of dissent
as that of "bums" and of the
Effete snobs who talk too loudly.
Unclog The System
And so, we must choose
must choose our route to unclog
and influence a system which has
remained unresponsive for too
long. But, while doing this we
must be conscious of the fact that
the Administration has
characterized us in such a bad
light that middle America still
stereotypes all students as
"radicals and communists." (To
quote some of our office mail.)
In the past week, the Council
of Presidents has been working in
Washington, New York, and
California to bring the views of
students before middle America.
We have had success in many
quarters.

We have spoken to many
government representatives who
shared views from all sides of the
political fence. Those who have
been siding with the students and
who have up to this time had an
intellectual appreciation of our
position, now have an emotional
appreciation of the depth and
breadth of student despair.
One Of The Few
When we arrived in
Washington, we were one of the
few concerned delegations to the
capital. When we left Washington,
one could hardly walk one block
without encountering another
group of campus representatives.
Offices of our legislators were
clogged with university
delegations. Congressmen,
Senators, and their assistants were
working in shifts to accomodate
the flow of campus visitors.
Senator Williams of New Jersey
reported that the responses he has
received on the Nixon Cambodia
move have run over 95% against
the President.
Fulfilled Promise
We flew to New York to fulfill
a promise that Bob Grant made

that we would fight to get equal
time for student leaders to address
the nation. ABC and NBC are
considering our proposal of one
hour for 5 student leaders from
around the country to address the
people of the U.S.
As a result of our efforts I was
given several minutes to comment
on the Nixon press conference
immediately upon its conclusion
on ABC along with 2 senators and
the President of Ohio University,
which was an un-precedented
occurance for a student, while
Barry was invited to appear on the
NBC special of Sunday night "Our
House Divided."
We have had an impact on the
press and television of the U.S.
The media are finally responding
to student proposals. There was
extensive coverage of the
Washington demonstrations last
weekend. Televised commentaries
such as the ABC presidential
comment, the NBC presentation

"Princeton Plan" which calls for a
closing of Universities for one
week to ten days before the
November election to permit
students to go out into the
community and to work for those
Congressmen and Senators who
will work for an end to the war.

6. Members of the Congress
will come to the University in the
fall to talk with and spend time
with the students.
The Washington trip gave us
time to do some thinking about
the direction and the priorities of
the nation. This nation must
reverse course before the divisions
become so permanent that its
destruction becomes imminent.
An economic boycott for one day
across the nation is a powerful
instrument for putting the
pressure upon the government and
big business.
It is time to take a stand and
we have.
No Business As Usual
Before 20 million people I
supported the no business as usual
closing of universities on a
voluntary basis to discuss the
issues and to move in constructive
ways to affect the system.
We are committed to working
for more national exposure of the
student viewpoint in an effective
way. Violent acts aimed at the
universities of this nation make
the headlines well before the
constructive efforts of serious
students, and destroys the good
press necessary to dispel the
stereotype of students and
necessary to change the system.
We have openly stated that the
United states must be out of
Cambodia immediately and out of
South east Asia by the end of July
1971. The "wait and see" attitude
of the Administration is being
undermined and legitimate protest
has put the government in such a
corner that the "illusion of
dialogue" is rapidly becoming
legitimate dialogue.

The United States is torn by a
crisis of a greater magnitude than
any since the Civil War. Allard
Lowenstein has declared, "We are
at the Valley Forge of the
American spirit." This breakdown
of the system is more serious than
that of the 1930's because then,
at" least, people looked to the
government for a solution. Today,
we have turned away from
Washington, crying for leadership,
and are all too receptive to
manipulative influences.
There has evolved a
fundamental loss of respect and
confidence in the decision-making
process. Those channels which we
have been socialized into
respecting appear clogged. There
is a domino theory operating in
the United States which is
dangerously polarizing our
society. The failure is one of
communication between the
Administration and the youth of
this nation.
The President's only contact
with the student viewpoint is his
interaction with Julie, Tricia, and
David. He, being the product of
two generations of military men,
and the two girls being prissy, and

quite adept at curtsying before
foreign dignitaries, but all three
representing the youth of another
era.
The President, while
campaigning, pledged to listen to
the voices of the dissenters
claiming that they presented one
valid viewpoint. Today, however,
he and the Vice-President have
characterized the voice of dissent
as that of "bums" and of the
Effete snobs who talk too loudly.
Unclog The System
And so, we must choose
must choose our route to unclog
and influence a system which has
remained unresponsive for too
long. But, while doing this we
must be conscious of the fact that
the Administration has
characterized us in such a bad
light that middle America still
stereotypes all students as
"radicals and communists." (To
quote some of our office mail.)
In the past week, the Council
of Presidents has been working in
Washington, New York, and
California to bring the views of
students before middle America.
We have had success in many
quarters.

We have spoken to many
government representatives who
shared views from all sides of the
political fence. Those who have
been siding with the students and
who have up to this time had an
intellectual appreciation of our
position, now have an emotional
appreciation of the depth and
breadth of student despair.
One Of The Few
When we arrived in
Washington, we were one of the
few concerned delegations to the
capital. When we left Washington,
one could hardly walk one block
without encountering another
group of campus representatives.
Offices of our legislators were
clogged with university
delegations. Congressmen,
Senators, and their assistants were
working in shifts to accomodate
the flow of campus visitors.
Senator Williams of New Jersey
reported that the responses he has
received on the Nixon Cambodia
move have run over 95% against
the President.
Fulfilled Promise
We flew to New York to fulfill
a promise that Bob Grant made

that we would fight to get equal
time for student leaders to address
the nation. ABC and NBC are
considering our proposal of one
hour for 5 student leaders from
around the country to address the
people of the U.S.
As a result of our efforts I was
given several minutes to comment
on the Nixon press conference
immediately upon its conclusion
on ABC along with 2 senators and
the President of Ohio University,
which was an un-precedented
occurance for a student, while
Barry was invited to appear on the
NBC special of Sunday night "Our
House Divided."
We have had an impact on the
press and television of the U.S.
The media are finally responding
to student proposals. There was
extensive coverage of the
Washington demonstrations last
weekend. Televised commentaries
such as the ABC presidential
comment, the NBC presentation
on Sunday night, and the
California special program with
the presidents of the UC
campuses, are examples of the
new trend, but we cannot stop
now.
Violence, however, is the one
means of destroying all the
credibility that students have built
up during the past 10 days.
Throughout this nation the
construction workers of New
York are looking like "crazies",
the Vice-President is treading a
more precarious path, and
a,nti-war congressmen are
gathering support.
Change Their Minds
But, as Congressmen Reigle
and ' McCloskey said in
Washington, it is far easier to win
the anti-war funding votes by
changing the minds of a
Congressman's constituency that
it is to change the minds of some
congressmen. This is 1970 and
every Congressman and several
key Senators' heads will be on the
line. A vote on the funding of the
war will provide us with the
names of all those Representatives
who must be ousted.
Stanford's own Congressman,
Gubser, must be defeated;
Murphy must be removed from
Congress. Men like Pete
McCloskey and George Brown
must remain in government.
Barry and I pledge ourselves to
work to see that:
1. There will be a debate
between Congressmen Tunney
and Brown on campus.
2. There will be organized a
group of students to work for the
reelection of Pete McCloskey.

3. There will be a "teach-out"
where students will go out into
the community to explain to
middle America why the war in
Asia is tearing our country apart.
4. There will be a nation-wide
television address by at least five
student leaders from different
sections of the country to convey
the student point of view and
counter the image that the
Vice-President has fostered.
5. Stanford will adopt the
"Princeton Plan" which calls for a
closing of Universities for one
week to ten days before the
November election to permit
students to go out into the
community and to work for those
Congressmen and Senators who
will work for an end to the war.
