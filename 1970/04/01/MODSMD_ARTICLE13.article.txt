# One Man's Fantasy
## Potato Salad Petitions 
### Nick Selby 
Some of you may be thinking that I have lost
my long battle against the Ã¼biquitous mind-rot
that threatens, most communicably, to infect us
all. Well, the answer is no, I have not freaked, not
yet: my brain is still sane, my head is not dead.
Like a giant slate blackboard miracuously
wiped clean by some frantic midnight custodian in
P.S. 37, I awoke one morning to a rare break-fast,
served in bed, of cold logic and heated compassion
for all the other loonies.
The pressures of the last few weeks seem
temporarily erased, as we rest in the eye of the
tempest brewing around us. We have a proposal on
the floor - as a point of information, Mister Chair,
let me lucidly begin.

Thinking it might be a real 'trip' to arouse the
sleepy communities beyond the peaceful
battlefield of Stanford, several friends and I
ventured out to collect signatures for petitions a
few days ago.
On this particular mission, we were assigned to
the Co-op Market in Sunnyvale, where the
response was not exactly as warm as the name
might indicate. This was due, probably, to the
nature of the trustees, whose corporations support
the people living there.
In a little over three hours, we watched a flood
of fourteen people risk the existential leap of
signing their names and addresses to a petition
supporting Senators Cranston, Goodell,
McGovern-ment, et al, in their efforts to cut off
funds for the jingo-ists in Cambodia.
One woman told us she hoped she wouldn't
lose her job for this rebellious act, and we assured
her we would write Congress to prevent such
retribution. On being questioned more extensively,
however, she denied our assertions that Amerika
was a repressive society.
Ulysses Resurrected
Another man, about 6'3" and rather imposing
in his fatigues, walked brusquely to our card table
and "ripped off" a ball-point pen from one of the
girls. "Sure, I'll sign your peition, where do I
sign?" he belched. He hastily scrawled his name
and steamed away in something of a huff.
It turned out his signature, when deciphered,
read "Ulysses S. Grant," with the catch-all address
of "Washington, D.C." This is the sort of name
that lifts eyebrows in Congressional offices, so we
were quite overjoyed Mr. Grant had signed, even if
he was still fighting the Civil (or Trojan) War. To
think that we didn't even get a chance to "rational
dialogue" him!!

After about two hours of this arduous waiting,
we decided to buy some lunch from a nearby
delicatessan, where a Coors Beer truck-driver, with
a Coors Beer green work shirt, was purchasing
Chocolate Milk drinks. We opted for potato salad
and coffee, which led to an unfortunate
happenstance.
Potato Salad Onslaught
The potato salad was, frankly, plain awful. "If I
see one more shopper go inside without signing
our petitions," I ranted impatiently, "I'll throw
potato salad all over her feet: no digestion as
usual!" After this bit of forceful sloganeering, I
had to be forcibly restrained by my companions.
In the ensuing scuffle, however, the coffee
spilled on our petition sheets, soaking them all.
The whole day seemed lost, and it would have
been if one of the girls hadn't darted into the
world of frozen lima beans to buy some paper
towels. We hung the signatures out to dry, each
with a plastic clothes-pin.
Shortly afterward, freezing half to death in the
wind and the cold response, we made a group
decision to split. We melted back into the Stanford
cosmos, overwhelmed with the typical liberal's
guilt that we had not ended the war.

Unfortunately, there are still many, many
students here who have not made the slightest
exertions towards leafletting, canvassing, or
gathering signatures. Lets face it: this work can be,
and almost invariably is, extremely boring and
tiresome.
Standard political movements require great
organization and even greater patience,
commodities not overly abundant on this campus.
Petitions promise no immediate results, if any at
all. But as I keep trying to tell you, in the age of
slogans and rocks, tear gas and national guard
units, this work is the only rational alternative. Of
course, if you want to be irrational, it is obvious
that I can't stop you: it's your sanity.
There are over ten thousand people in this
community - think of one thousand or two
thousand of us giving up one precious hour each
day to campaign for George Brown or get petitions
for Congress. In one week, that's anywhere
between five-thousand and ten-thousand
man-hours of work for peace. On this score, most
emphatically, despite all the frustration I've
described above, I urge you to (finally) "Do it."
