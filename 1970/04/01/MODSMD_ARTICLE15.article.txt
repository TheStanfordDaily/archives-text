# Kent Eyewitness Urges Action

### 
Fred Kirsch, eyewitness of the
Kent State massacres, is disgusted
at the mood he saw at Stanford
this weekend.
"This place is dead," he said
Sunday in Roble lounge after
addressing the Strike Coordinating
Committee. "I was at Columbia
and they're going to shut the
place down . . . at M.I.T. they've
got a whole building as a strike
center."
Told that the quiet tone and

small turnout at the Coordinating
Committee meeting was a
function of fine weather and
Stanford's weekend vacation
habit, Kirsch responded
sarcastically.
"Look, this campus is really
nice . . . Kent is nice too but not
as nice as this . . . anyway, I can
see how people can really get on a
nature kick .. . damn, before I
saw people killed last Monday I
didn't care."

Shaking a copy of THE
MILITANT, a socialist weekly
which printed his eyewitness
account of the Kent killings,
Kirsch pointed at a picture of
students running from gunfire.
"Look," he said. "Look at the
people in that crowd. They've all
got short hair. Those aren't
radicals. Those are ordinary
students .. . Even me, Monday
morning I went to class ... I was
aware of a student strike but I
didn't think it was real ... I

there was a

didn't get to class . . . there was a
bomb scare ..."
"I always knew myself that I
would never get into a political
group until I got knocked over the
head ... I didn't get knocked over
the head, I got shot at. That's why
I'm here ..."
Kirsch could not understand
why more Stanford students
weren't working this weekend.
"They gotta conceptualize
especially the brothersâ€”that when
you are in a rice paddy in
Vietnam, Saturday and Sunday
you're doing the same damn thing
all week."
"If people going to school
think they're going to school for
the freedom of democracy, damn,
they've got a lot to learn. They
fired on order . . . they kneeled
together ... I didn't hear any
sniper fire ... it's all grassy in
front of Taylor Hall . . there
aren't even any rocks big enough
to throw . . ."
Kirsch also could not believe
that there is a question about
whether the strike will continue
here at Stanford.
"If this campus goes back to
class Monday, like they say they
are, the whole country is going to
jump on that. Stanford was the
first school to go out on strike.
It's got to STAY out."
