# Pacifist Sandperl Heads Student Draft Card Turn-In
## 
### JOHN SCHWARTZ 
Last week, around 100 students
turned in their draft cards at
Stanford. Four hundred to five
hundred persons signed a call to
resist illegitimate authority, a
statement for women and men
over draft age that subjects them
to possible arrest for complicity in
resisting the draft.
The one person perhaps most
responsible for these actions is Ira
Sandperl, director of the Institute
for the Study of Non-Violence
and long-time friend of Joan Baez
Harris.
Discussions
Since last Monday, Sandperl
has been holding discussion
sessions with students from 9-12
and 2-5 in the Round Room of
Memorial Church. The
discussions, most attended by
about a dozen students, usually
center around non-violence, with
topics ranging from radical
education to Gandhi to draft
resistence.
Sandperl plans to remain at
Stanford as long as the strike lasts
and will be holding meetings in
the church again this week.
In addition to discussions, he
has been attending meetings of a
variety of campus groups. He and
Joan Harris conducted a call for a
mass draft turn-in at last Friday's
strike meeting.
Friendship With Baez
Sandperl's friendship with Joan
goes back 13 years, long before
she became a well-known folk
singer, and their relationship is
described in a chapter of her
autobiography, Daybreak.
In more recent years, the two
havetravelled together frequently

on singing and speaking tours in
this country and in Europe.
Sandperl describes the founding
of the Institute for the Study of
Non-Violence as an outgrowth of
his association with Mrs. Harris.
As he tells it, about five years ago
Joan had been away for a time
and thought of some questions on
non-violence she couldn't answer.
When she returned, she asked
Sandperl to tutor her, and that led
to the idea of a place where
everyone could learn of
non-violence. Since then, a
number of branches of the
Institute for the Study of
Non-Violence have been
established, including one in Palo
Alto.
Many Causes
In addition to his work with
Joan Harris, Sandperl has been
active in a broad spectrum of

causes ranging from Martin Luther
King's in the south to the Free
Speech Movement in Berkeley.
Concerning the current
situation at Stanford, Sandperl
says that a nation-wide strike is
the most important political and
educational activity. He hopes
that if it is sustained it will bring
about a cease-fire in Southeast
Asia.
The underlying theme of
Sandperl's work is non-violence,
perhaps best summed up by a
passage in Joan Harris' book: "I
have heard him say a thousand
times that the only way to peace
is through peaceful means; that a
peaceful end would not justify
wicked means; that in fact wicked
means have only brought about a
continuation of wickedness; that
the only way to peace is through
non-violent political action."

Speech Movement in Berkeley.
Concerning the current
situation at Stanford, Sandperl
says that a nation-wide strike is
the most important political and
educational activity. He hopes
that if it is sustained it will bring
about a cease-fire in Southeast
Asia.
The underlying theme of
Sandperl's work is non-violence,
perhaps best summed up by a
passage in Joan Harris' book: "I
have heard him say a thousand
times that the only way to peace
is through peaceful means; that a
peaceful end would not justify
wicked means; that in fact wicked
means have only brought about a
continuation of wickedness; that
the only way to peace is through
non-violent political action."
Last week, around 100 students
turned in their draft cards at
Stanford. Four hundred to five
hundred persons signed a call to
resist illegitimate authority, a
statement for women and men
over draft age that subjects them
to possible arrest for complicity in
resisting the draft.
The one person perhaps most
responsible for these actions is Ira
Sandperl, director of the Institute
for the Study of Non-Violence
and long-time friend of Joan Baez
Harris.
Discussions
Since last Monday, Sandperl
has been holding discussion
sessions with students from 9-12
and 2-5 in the Round Room of
Memorial Church. The
discussions, most attended by
about a dozen students, usually
center around non-violence, with
topics ranging from radical
education to Gandhi to draft
resistence.
Sandperl plans to remain at
Stanford as long as the strike lasts
and will be holding meetings in
the church again this week.
In addition to discussions, he
has been attending meetings of a
variety of campus groups. He and
Joan Harris conducted a call for a
mass draft turn-in at last Friday's
strike meeting.
Friendship With Baez
Sandperl's friendship with Joan
goes back 13 years, long before
she became a well-known folk
singer, and their relationship is
described in a chapter of her
autobiography, Daybreak.
In more recent years, the two
havetravelled together frequently

on singing and speaking tours in
this country and in Europe.
Sandperl describes the founding
of the Institute for the Study of
Non-Violence as an outgrowth of
his association with Mrs. Harris.
As he tells it, about five years ago
Joan had been away for a time
and thought of some questions on
non-violence she couldn't answer.
When she returned, she asked
Sandperl to tutor her, and that led
to the idea of a place where
everyone could learn of
non-violence. Since then, a
number of branches of the
Institute for the Study of
Non-Violence have been
established, including one in Palo
Alto.
Many Causes
In addition to his work with
Joan Harris, Sandperl has been
active in a broad spectrum of

causes ranging from Martin Luther
King's in the south to the Free
Speech Movement in Berkeley.
