# San Diego Paper Misquotes Shea
## 
### 
Council of Presidents member
Patrick C. Shea denies having said
any of twelve separate quotations
attributed to him in a front page
story in the SAN DIEGO
TRIBUNE last week.
According to Shea, "I am either
misquoted very, extremely out of
context, or I did not say them at
all.
The article, based on a
telephone interview, quotes Shea
as having asked for community
support in combating

"professional revolutionaries bent
on shutting this country's
universities down." Shea says this
quotation is typical. "What I did
say is that I hoped the Stanford
community would support the
University by staying on campus
and not allowing it to be shut
down."
"The student leader said that
issues such as the U.S.
involvement in S.E. Asia are 'not
the real issue at all. The whole
thing is really an attack on the
society. I've talked to several of
the militants and they are
interested solely in destroying our
entire social structure as we now
know it."
In a statement to the Daily
Shea said, "I do not wish to see
the polarization of society based
upon erroneous information or
misinterpretation. The SAN
DIEGO TRIBUNE is being
contacted regarding my rejection
of these statements I did not say,
and clarifying those statements
which have been misconstrued to
mean more than they were
intended to mean.
The article appeared in
different forms for four days in
the San Diego paper. It also
appeared in several other papers.
Shea says he has received at least
200 letters in response to the
article and that so far they are
running 200 to one in favor of
what he was quoted as having
said.
Shea said he wants to make it
clear that the article represents
the views of the newspaper not
him, and that "even if that's what
I thought, I certainly wouldn't say
it for publication."
