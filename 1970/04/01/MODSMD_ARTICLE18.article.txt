# Workers' Action Group
## 
### 
In order to facilitate staff
participation in political and
informational activities during the
remainder of spring quarter a
Stanford Worker's Action Group
(SWAG) has been formed by
concerned staff, faculty and
students.
The principle of limited pay
and time-off for participation in
the various campus activities has
been recognized by both the
Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations, Mr. Robert
Nelson, and by President Kenneth
Pitzer. In a statement dated May
7, Nelson suggested that
reasonable paid time-off "would
generally amount to about one to
two hours during a normal work
day."
In a statement to all staff
members on May 11, Pitzer said
that it is important that staff
members "find a means of
meeting their obligations as
concerned citizens of this
community along with their
employment obligations," and
urged staff participation subject
to agreement "in advance between
the staff member and his
supervisor."
SWAG is working in the
following ways to make staff
participation possible:
I—Disseminating information
about various campus activities to
staff;
2—Forming groups of faculty,
students and staff to meet with
staff members at their work
departments in order to form
discussion groups for exchange of
views;
3—Setting up informational
teach-ins at work departments as
requested by staff members;
4—Providing temporary student
and faculty replacement for staff
members who want to participate
in some activity but are unable to
get leave from their jobs;
s—Aiding staff members in
reaching agreements with their
supervisors about how much time
off they should receive.
