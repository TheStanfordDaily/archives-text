# Crew Awaits Western Championships
## 
### DENNIS MORROW 
Stanford's varsity eight sank
Cal Saturday with a three-length
win in the Big Row. Cal took the
junior varsity race by three feet,
but lost the Jim Reynolds Cup
when their freshmen as a war
protest, refused to row.
Cal's varsity jumped to an early
one length lead when the Bear
coxwain took advantage of calm
water near the shore of the
Redwood City course. Stanford,
fighting rough water in the center
of the channel, pulled even at the
1000 meter mark.
Rowing at 37 strokes a minute,
the Indians powered past the Cal
boat in the second thousand
meters walking away to an easy
13 second margin at the finish
Hag. It was the fifth straight Big
Row win for Tribe coach Will
Condon.

There were two changes made
in the varsity since the UCLA loss
two weeks ago. Harry Waters, a
sophomore, moved into the stroke
seat for his first varsity race and
Pete Sapin, a junior, took over the
number four position.
Coach Condon said, "Our new
stroke definitely made a
difference, but the whole boat is
rowing better now."
Stanford's J.V. boat took a
length lead early in their race, but
couldn't hold it as Cal caught and
passed them at the 1000-meter
mark. With 700 meters to go the
Indians came to life and began
eating into the Bear lead.
By 500 to go Stanford had cut
the margin to 3 A length and had
started to sprint. In the most
exciting finish this year they
pulled within three feet and were
still moving up when both boats

crossed the line. Cal was judged
the winner by half a second.
In a third boat race Cal edged
Stanford by one length, but both
boats were beaten by the Stanford
Frosh crew rowing an exhibition
race. The Stanford third boat, put
together this week just for this
race, lacked the experience to
handle bad conditions on the
course.
Cal's freshmen voted not to
row as a protest against the war in
Indochina. Stanford Freshmen
then elected to row in the third
varsity race for practice. Cal's
forfeit cost them the Jim
Reynolds Cup which goes to the

winner of two out of three of the
varsity, J.V., and freshman races.
The only other signs of dissent
were a small peace flag flying on
the bow of a Cal shell and a group
of Stanford musicians reputedly
chanting "strike (up) the band."
Stanford crew persons now
turn their early morning
attentions to next week's Western
Sprint Championships. On the
basis of comparative times, both
varsity and J.V. should be
contenders for their class title.
Washington and UCLA are
co-favorites, but crew statisticians
delight in juggling figures to show
that there are five or six schools

with the potential to "do it" in
Long Beach on Saturday.
Varsity Cox Mike Yoshimura
said, "We'll be in there next week
no matter who wins. Both of our
boats have a chance to take it all
and that's just what we're going to
do."

HAPPY DAY—Dick Borchers (11) meets a sizable welcoming contingent alter
Masting his first home run of the year Tuesday in the Indians' 2-0 win over Santa
Clara. Dave Edson drove in Phil Keller for Stanford's second run, coming in the
second inning, and from there on it was a typical Stanford-Santa Clara game,
replete with the usual squabbles and profanity. Keller pitched the distance for die
win—he's 8-s—giving up eight hits and striking out nine. But though the Broncos
threatened on occasion, Keller consistently hurled himself out of jams.

Congratulating Borchers, left to right, are Boh Wilhelm, Bob Reece (14), Mike
Ewing (16), Tom Williams (31) and Tom Changnon (17), Steve Dunning (24) and
Bob Marshall who seem to be expressing particular delight. Stanford, eliminated
from the league playoff when it was determined that the rained-out
Oregon-UCLA doubleheader would not be made up, finishes its year wiUi a home
and home weekend series with California.
