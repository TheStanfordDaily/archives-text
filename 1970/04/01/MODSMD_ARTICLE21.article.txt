# Five Sports Set On Intramural Schedule
## 
### STEVE CRONENBERG 
On Saturday May 16 the first
Intramural Bike Race will be held
at 11 a.m. The race will be 10
miles in length and will be run
around the football stadium. Each
living unit may enter up to 5
riders. The event is not a relay
race, but a race in which each
individual rider must ride the full
10 miles.
Each rider will be awarded
meet points on the basis of the
order in which he finishes the
race. The riders from each unit
will then add their scores together
to determine the winning living
unit. Cro Mem is the top-heavy
early favorite for this race based
on past performances in the
Convalescent Home Bike Race.
Softball, volleyball, and water
polo are all in their last week of
regularly scheduled play, with the
tournaments in each of these
sports slated to start either late
this week or sometime next week.
The softball tourney will probably
get under way this Saturday with
many teams given a good shot at
winning it all.
In volleyball, there are no clear
favorites as many groups have
come up with very good teams
and many league winners have not
made it through their entire
league season without suffering a
loss. In water polo, the Sigma Chis
appear to have the edge over the
rest of the field if their team can

remain healthy. They will be hard
pressed by teams from Cro Mem,
DU, Alpha Sig, and Beta Theta Pi.
The Intramural Swimming Meet
is scheduled for May 20 at the
varsity pool. The events and the
order in which they are to be held
are as follows: 200 Yard Medley
Relay; 150 Yard Free Style; 50
Yard Free Style; 100 Individual
Medley; Diving; 75 Yard
Butterfly; 100 Yard Free Style;
75 Yard Backstroke; 75 Yard
Brest Stroke; and the 200 Yard
Free Style Relay. Deadline for
signups for these events is Mav 15.
