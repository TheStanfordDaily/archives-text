## DOD Research Forum Today 
### 
A Community meeting on
research and funding has been
called for 10 a.m. today by the
Committee On Research Policy
and the Department of Physics.
The meeting will be held in
Memorial Auditorium, and
loudspeakers will be set up
outside. It will also be covered on
KZSU. Planners say that the
purpose of the meeting is to
provide an open forum for
discussion of the research issues,
and to begin groundwork on
alternative funding and new
research directions.
Both faculty members
knowledgeable on the research
issues and radical representatives
of the strike will begin the agenda
with formal presentations.

Afterwards, there will be open
microphones.
Professor W.F. Miller,
Vice-president for Research and
Arthur Schawlow, Chairman of
the Committee on Research, will
participate in the forum. The
meeting will be moderated by
Professor Walter E. Meyerhof, and
Dan Bracken, both from the
Physics Department.
Both the Strike Steering
Committee and the administration
have called for a large turnout at
the meeting. Yesterday afternoon,
in a statement to the Daily,
Provost Richard Lyman said: "I'm
glad there's to be an open
discussion on research policy, and
a full opportunity for interested
people to convey their views on

Department of Defense research
to the Committee on Research
Policy and the Vice President for
Research. Professor Schawlow's
Committee, which reports to the
Academic Senate, is the proper
body to consider these matters.
"Professor Miller has been doing
an outstanding job on helping
faculty to diversify their sources
of research support, and people
should know about this. There
have been some excellent
teach-ins on the subject, but a lot
of people still have questions and
Thursday's meeting is the place to
ask them."
A leaflet has been circulated by
the Strike Committee to all
residences and department offices,
encouraging all members of the
community to attend.
