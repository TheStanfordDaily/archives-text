# 28 More Face SJC; Only ROTC Blockaded
## 
### 
Forty demonstrators marched
to the North County Court House
Wednesday to protest felony
charges brought against student
Burnell Mack. Twenty-eight other
demonstrators blocking the ROTC
building identified themselves
today and now face hearings
before the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC).
The marchers, moving from the
main Quad to the Court House on
Grant Avenue in Palo Alto, joined
another 40 including a number of
black students at the courtroom
in protesting Mack's arrest April
29 during night-time campus
demonstrations.
Mack's plea on charges of
assault with a deadly weapon and
resisting arrest was put over to 10
a.m. May 20 by Municipal Judge
J. Barton Phelps. The student
remains free on $1000 bond.
Mack, a junior in political
science, and members of the Black
Students Union (BSU) at Stanford
alleges that he was beaten so badly
by police that he could barely
speak.
Meanwhile, 29 students
identified themselves as
"practicing civil disobediance" in
blocking entry to the ROTC
building and entrances to the
Armory across the street. They
must attend a preliminary SJC
hearing by noon today, or face
suspension from Stanford for the
remainder of this quarter. Twelve
demonstrators who identified
themselves Tuesday faced the SJC
yesterday and had hearings set for
June 1. The total number of SJC
disciplinary cases is now 112.
Photographs Studied
Photographs of an additional
25 to 50 persons who refused to
identify themselves Tuesday and
did not leave the Electronics
Research Laboratories' entrances
when ordered to are still being
studied by University officials.
Demonstrators said yesterday
that starting once again at 6:00

a.m. they intend to keep the
ROTC building closed for the
tenth day. At 7:45 this morning
student pickets will again
demonstrate in front of the
shipping and receiving area of the
physical plants on Campus
Drive -the central delivery point
for all university office supplies.
Research Forum
At 10:00 this morning the
Committee on Research Policy

will jointly sponsor a symposium
on Defence Department research.
A mass meeting of the Stanford
community is scheduled for 4:00

The Hewlett-Packard/Industrial

Registrar Harvey Hall
announced yesterday that
individual faculty members and
departments were made
responsible for determining the
appropriate means of evaluating
spring quarter academic work. In
a campus memorandum, Hall
urged individual departments to
establish appropriate guidelines
"to maintain equity and to
minimize conflicts" in academic
work evaluation.
"Ultimately, individual
instructors must decide the best
way to evaluate the
accomplishments of students
under conditions which have
existed for the latter part of this
quarter," he added.

Registrar Harvey Hall
announced yesterday that
individual faculty members and
departments were made
responsible for determining the
appropriate means of evaluating
spring quarter academic work. In
a campus memorandum, Hall
urged individual departments to
establish appropriate guidelines
"to maintain equity and to
minimize conflicts" in academic
work evaluation.
"Ultimately, individual
instructors must decide the best
way to evaluate the
accomplishments of students
under conditions which have
existed for the latter part of this
quarter," he added.
Forty demonstrators marched
to the North County Court House
Wednesday to protest felony
charges brought against student
Burnell Mack. Twenty-eight other
demonstrators blocking the ROTC
building identified themselves
today and now face hearings
before the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC).
The marchers, moving from the
main Quad to the Court House on
Grant Avenue in Palo Alto, joined
another 40 including a number of
black students at the courtroom
in protesting Mack's arrest April
29 during night-time campus
demonstrations.
Mack's plea on charges of
assault with a deadly weapon and
resisting arrest was put over to 10
a.m. May 20 by Municipal Judge
J. Barton Phelps. The student
remains free on $1000 bond.
Mack, a junior in political
science, and members of the Black
Students Union (BSU) at Stanford
alleges that he was beaten so badly
by police that he could barely
speak.
Meanwhile, 29 students
identified themselves as
"practicing civil disobediance" in
blocking entry to the ROTC
building and entrances to the
Armory across the street. They
must attend a preliminary SJC
hearing by noon today, or face
suspension from Stanford for the
remainder of this quarter. Twelve
demonstrators who identified
themselves Tuesday faced the SJC
yesterday and had hearings set for
June 1. The total number of SJC
disciplinary cases is now 112.
Photographs Studied
Photographs of an additional
25 to 50 persons who refused to
identify themselves Tuesday and
did not leave the Electronics
Research Laboratories' entrances
when ordered to are still being
studied by University officials.
Demonstrators said yesterday
that starting once again at 6:00

a.m. they intend to keep the
ROTC building closed for the
tenth day. At 7:45 this morning
student pickets will again
demonstrate in front of the
shipping and receiving area of the
physical plants on Campus
Drive -the central delivery point
for all university office supplies.
Research Forum
At 10:00 this morning the
Committee on Research Policy
and the Engineering Department
will jointly sponsor a symposium
on Defence Department research.
A mass meeting of the Stanford
community is scheduled for 4:00
this afternoon in White Plaza.
Police report that five molotov
cocktails were discovered in Frost
