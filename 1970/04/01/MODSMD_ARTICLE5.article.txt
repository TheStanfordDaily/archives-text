# D.C. Delegates Still Skeptical

### DAVE BRENNER 
Four members of the Stanford
delegation to Washington showed
guarded optimism about the
ultimate effect of their two day
visit in an interview broadcast
over KZSU last night.
Professors John Lewis, Sandy
Dornbusch, Elanor Maccoby, and
Stanford Young Republicans,
president Don Ayer expressed
their surprise at the lack of
communication in the executive
branch of the government.
Lewis noted that no one in the
Department of Asian Affairs had
even been consulted about the
recent Cambodian invasion. He
said that this was indicative of a
trend in the Nixon administration
of disregarding the lower
eschelons of officialdom.
Dornbusch later affirmed that the
President does not even get all the
intelligence about foreign affairs.
He said, "much support for Mr.
Nixon is based on the assumption
that he nr.. t know best since he
has all the facts. However, he
doesn't know all the facts, or even
use the ones he has. Father
doesn't necessarily know best."
Cold War Mentality
Earlier Mrs. Maccoby
characterized most Nixon officials
as having a "cold war mentality."
Prof. Lewis agreed, noting that
attitudes in the Capitol have
changed little since 1950.
All were hesitant to assess the
actual impact of the mission. Ayer
felt that the protests did have
some effect on the powers that
be. It was vital, he said, for
Washington to see that academia
is seriously interested in national
policy.

All four panelists emphasized
the need for maintaining the
momentum of the latest student
faculty uprising. Lewis stated that
all the departments on campus
should "do what they can do
best" to inform the public about
US foreign policy. Mrs. Maccoby
called for the building of a
common base between students
and organized labor, after
expressing her dismay at the
recent clash between construction
workers and collegians in New
York City
Establish Communications
Ayer said that students must
establish communications with
the rest of America. "We must fit
ourselves into their framework
and relate in ways that they can
understand. To me that means
working through political parties.
I believe that's the only way we'll
do it."
After noting that Henry
Kissinger felt that the anti-war
sentiment would die in "about
three weeks", Lewis called for
continuation of present efforts
through the summer until the
November elections. "We've got
to show them we mean business,"
he said.
Dornbusch commented that
the student and faculty
delegations that have been
swarming over Capitol Hill are
beginning to convey to many
officials the sense of urgency that
some Americans feel about recent
events. Men like Senators Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Hiram
Fong (R-Ha.) are already more in
sympathy with campus protesters
than with the government's
policies.
