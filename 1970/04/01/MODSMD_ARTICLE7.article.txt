# PACC Coordinates Protest
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
Representatives of many
campus political action groups
met yesterday to coordinate their
efforts through the Political
Action Coordinating Committee.
"The strike mobilized people.
Better organization is needed now
if the effect is to continue," said
PACC's Ken Ritterspach.
According to Ritterspach,
PACC is moving froiri being an
informational organization to a
coordinating agency. PACC is an
umbrella which seeks to provide
funds, services and manpower to
on-going action groups in order to
facilitate cooperation among the
groups, he said.
"The success of this movement
will depend on whether in fact
students really want to get out
and work for peace," commented
Ritterspach.
Different academic
departments have accepted
responsibility for coordinating
various kinds of political action.
Communications department is
handling public relations,
anthropology is coordinating
canvassing, the political science
institute is collating research,
math is heading the letter writing
campaign, the med center is
promoting a national work
stoppage and the history strike
group is generating educational
programs for the community.
Most groups shared needs for
more manpower and more funds.
Financial support will be sought

through the ASSU Peace Fund
and PACC fund raising efforts.
Ben Page, instructor and
spokesman for the Indochina
Political Action Group announced
that a printed booklet detailing
the how's and why's of political
organization in opposition to the
war will be available at the end of
next week. Plans call for the
distribution of 100,000 copies in
the western states if the necessary
$5,000 can be raised.
A packet of collected
information on political action,
the state of the war and current
legislation is available from the
Indochina Political Action Group
for speakers and other interested
individuals.
Attempting to sustain the
movement beyond Kissinger's
three week period of
emotionalism, one PACC affiliate
is organizing to equip students to
take the peace campaign back into
their home communities this
summer.
The law school, the med
school, the business school and
the schools of education are
operating speakers bureaus. In
addition, speakers on campus
issues and the strike are being
provided through PACC. The
department of Speech and Drama
is booking free performances of
war related drama and music for
community engagements.
The Communications
Department produced a news
program on the strike jointly with

U.C. Berkeley which will probably
be shown on KQED today.
The radio news bureau in the
communications department is
now organized to feed news
reports about strike progress into
commercial radio stations in the
Bay Area. Nine stations are now
regularly taking feeds from the
bureau and several have voiced
their enthusiasm for the
broadcasts.
A ten minute news reel about
recent campus activities is
complete and has been shown in
industry plants and is scheduled
for showings in local churches.
The Medical Center has
concentrated its organizing efforts
within the center and in other
medical facilities in the area.
Extensive work is being done in
connection with the planned
National Work Stoppage.
The Anthropology Department
reported that canvassers have

saturated the surrounding
communities and extended their
effort to Fremont and the Bank
of America world headquarters in
San Francisco. People are now
needed to provide transportation
and manpower for leafletting in
other communities.
A music play-in is scheduled by
the Music department Saturday in
the Stanford Shopping Center as
part of its letter writing campaign.
Other activities currently
underway include plans to
computerize inter-group
communication with the help of
the computer science department,
a coordinating body to direct
people to peace candidates who
need volunteer support, tentative
plans for regularly scheduled
teach-ins for university
employees, and the birth of a
services agency to handle typing,
dittoing and such activities for all
political action groups.
