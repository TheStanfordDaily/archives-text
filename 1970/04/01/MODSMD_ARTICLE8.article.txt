# On All Levels
## 
### 
Two weeks ago, the University Council of Princeton
altered its academic calendar to allow a two week recess
before the November elections.
Today the Stanford faculty Senate will consider a
similar proposal. We support this proposal and urge its
adoption.
There are many who feel that such an effort is useless;
that the system is corrupt and beyond reform. We think
the drive for peace can continue on many levels and see a
two week break as one small step.
For those who choose to work through the system, it
affords time when that work can be most effective.
During the extended break campaigners would not be
limited to local elections, but could travel to help any
candidate in the country.
Of course, two weeks is hardly enough. If the
university community is to become a force which all
candidates must reckon with it must apply pressure
throughout the year. A pre-election break should
complement year long, action oriented study ot the
political process.
Students have long been challenged to make the
system work. The Princeton proposal will free us to make
an impact on the recalcitrant system.

A Dissenting Editorial
Spending a week or two weeks in the autumn working
for political candidates is somewhat like worrying about
who was going to be elected mayor of Berlin in 1938.
