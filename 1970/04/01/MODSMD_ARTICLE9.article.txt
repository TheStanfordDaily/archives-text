## University's DOD Research 
### Phil Golds milk 
One of the most strongly
decried ties between Stanford and
the defense department/war
machine is the existence of some
9.8 million dollars worth of DOD
research contracts on which
members of the university are
currently working.
The objections to such research
are based on the understanding
that the Mansfield amendment to
the fiscal year 1970 military
authorization bill limits that
organization to contracting
research having "a direct and
apparent relationship to a specific
military function or operation." It
is believed that such a law will
force each researcher either to
turn down DOD contracts or to
state publicly how his work
relates to a DOD mission, and
that, if he does the latter, the
university's letting such work
remain on campus means it is
clearly in complicity with the
Pentagon's policies.
Agencies of Destruction
Unfortunately for those of us
who would like to end the
university's aid of agencies of
destruction, the situation is not
quite that easy. The DOD merely
has to convince Congress that all
research they fund is related to a
defense mission; the individual
researcher can remain silent.
Apparently, according to
Stanford research administrator
Earl Cilley, the DOD is paring off
the scientifically least valuable
basic research in amounts large

enough to make dovish senators
happy and then claiming to
Congress all their other contracts
are mission oriented. So, despite
the Mansfield amendment, not all
DOD research contracts on this
campus written in fiscal year 1970
have a direct relationship to a
military mission.
University Power Minimal
Another problem is that this
university alone or all universities
in concert have little power to
impair the DOD's operations.
Most of the eight billion dollars
worth of research contracted by
the DOD is done by industry—and
much of the 350 million dollars
worth done on university
campuses is not directly related to
current military missions. Thus, if
all universities stopped doing
DOD research, the resulting effect
would primarily be on the pool of
basic knowledge which, only in
the long run (and assuming such
research were not funded by some
other agency), might impair the
DOD.
Unseen Implications
For example, according to
Cilley, some professors, after
having their research funded for
many years by a given agency,
may be asked by that agency to
do other work for them, with the
implication that the professor
may not have his research
re-funded if he refuses. Since
professors do not like to seek out
new funding sources, especially if
they have had an assured funding

source or if there are few funding
sources for their type of research,
they are likely to do the other
work and not risk losing their
contract.
Obviously the DOD is not the
only agency which can coerce
people in this way—any
government agency has that
power except those like the
National Institutes of Health
which make their funding
decisions on the basis of
peer-group evaluation of the
merits of a project—but there
seems to be a substantial
difference between an individual
being coerced to work on a missile
system and on a health program.
This year, the House Armed
Services committee eliminated the
Mansfield amendment to the fiscal
year 1971 military authorization
bill but added another section
prohibiting any DOD funding
(except continued or renewed
contracts "likely to make a
significant contribution to the
defense effort") at universities
barring any military recruiters
from coming on campus.
So, it is not only to protest the
foreign policy of tbis country, but
also to avoid keeping individuals
and the entire university in a
position where they can be
coerced by Congress or the
military, that the academic senate
and other empowered bodies on
this campus should form a
committee representative of the

help find alternative sources of
funding for research currently
sponsored by the DOD.
I think the committee should
be instructed to reduce the
1969-70 amount of DOD-funded
research by at least one-quarter
yearly until, by the 1973-74
academic year, Stanford has no
DOD-funded research. The
committee should be empowered
to determine which research is
directly related to military
missions and to instruct the
investigators of such projects that
their work is incompatible with
the purposes of the university and
thus can't be done on this campus
after the end of the contract
period. It should help all others
obtain alternative funding.

relates to a DOD mission, and
that, if he does the latter, the
university's letting such work
remain on campus means it is
clearly in complicity with the
Pentagon's policies.
Agencies of Destruction
Unfortunately for those of us
who would like to end the
university's aid of agencies of
destruction, the situation is not
quite that easy. The DOD merely
has to convince Congress that all
research they fund is related to a
defense mission; the individual
researcher can remain silent.
Apparently, according to
Stanford research administrator
Earl Cilley, the DOD is paring off
the scientifically least valuable
basic research in amounts large

enough to make dovish senators
happy and then claiming to
Congress all their other contracts
are mission oriented. So, despite
the Mansfield amendment, not all
DOD research contracts on this
campus written in fiscal year 1970
have a direct relationship to a
military mission.
University Power Minimal
Another problem is that this
university alone or all universities
in concert have little power to
impair the DOD's operations.
Most of the eight billion dollars
worth of research contracted by
the DOD is done by industry—and
much of the 350 million dollars
worth done on university
campuses is not directly related to
current military missions. Thus, if
all universities stopped doing
DOD research, the resulting effect
would primarily be on the pool of
basic knowledge which, only in
the long run (and assuming such
research were not funded by some
other agency), might impair the
DOD.
Unseen Implications
For example, according to
Cilley, some professors, after
having their research funded for
many years by a given agency,
may be asked by that agency to
do other work for them, with the
implication that the professor
may not have his research
re-funded if he refuses. Since
professors do not like to seek out
new funding sources, especially if
they have had an assured funding

source or if there are few funding
sources for their type of research,
they are likely to do the other
work and not risk losing their
contract.
Obviously the DOD is not the
only agency which can coerce
people in this way—any
government agency has that
power except those like the
National Institutes of Health
which make their funding
decisions on the basis of
peer-group evaluation of the
merits of a project—but there
seems to be a substantial
difference between an individual
being coerced to work on a missile
system and on a health program.
This year, the House Armed
Services committee eliminated the
Mansfield amendment to the fiscal
year 1971 military authorization
bill but added another section
prohibiting any DOD funding
(except continued or renewed
contracts "likely to make a
significant contribution to the
defense effort") at universities
barring any military recruiters
from coming on campus.
So, it is not only to protest the
foreign policy of tbis country, but
also to avoid keeping individuals
and the entire university in a
position where they can be
coerced by Congress or the
military, that the academic senate
and other empowered bodies on
this campus should form a
committee representative of the

help find alternative sources of
funding for research currently
sponsored by the DOD.
I think the committee should
be instructed to reduce the
1969-70 amount of DOD-funded
research by at least one-quarter
yearly until, by the 1973-74
academic year, Stanford has no
DOD-funded research. The
committee should be empowered
to determine which research is
directly related to military
missions and to instruct the
investigators of such projects that
their work is incompatible with
the purposes of the university and
thus can't be done on this campus
after the end of the contract
period. It should help all others
obtain alternative funding.

in general studies.)
One of the most strongly
decried ties between Stanford and
the defense department/war
machine is the existence of some
9.8 million dollars worth of DOD
research contracts on which
members of the university are
currently working.
The objections to such research
are based on the understanding
that the Mansfield amendment to
the fiscal year 1970 military
authorization bill limits that
organization to contracting
research having "a direct and
apparent relationship to a specific
military function or operation." It
is believed that such a law will
force each researcher either to
turn down DOD contracts or to
state publicly how his work
relates to a DOD mission, and
that, if he does the latter, the
university's letting such work
remain on campus means it is
clearly in complicity with the
Pentagon's policies.
