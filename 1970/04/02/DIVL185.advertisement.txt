Consider our page-size music system. Three
components just the size of a sheet of typing paper
—BV2 xll — and 3 inches thick. Gives you AM
and FM Stereo radio in one "sheet," a fine quality
speaker system in each of the other two. And we'll
add a Garrard record changer with base and
diamond needle.
The whole system — record player, radio, and
speakers — is only $89.95 at Lafayette.
How's that for catching the ball?

HYPNOSIS
WORKSHOP
is a privately owned school of self-hypnosis. We
offer a seven-week course (one hour instruction
a week), teaching you how to hypnotize your
self, showing you how to do various hypnotic
phenomena, such as:
• Learning to relax deeply and quickly, as, completely as
while asleep.
• Learning to increase your ability to concentrate, by focusing
your attention completely and tuning out irrelevant stimulii.
• Reducing or eliminating pain. This potential is already used
extensively in dentistry and childbirth.
• Remembering and actually reliving past events. In reliving
past events, you can experience them emotionally and with
all five senses, in a vivid hypnotic dream, i
• Hypnotic dreams are also useful in enhancing creativity.
• Learning to produce altered states of consciousness, indud- :
ing the ability to enhance meditation states, and produce
states of amplified awareness.
The course costs $30, with the option of a $15 refund
on the third week, as well as a limited number of
scholarships. There will be a free lecture-demonstra
tion on hypnosis and the uses of self-hypnosis at our
office at 1010 Doyle Street in Menlo Park at 7:30 on
these nights: April 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Come to
any one of the lectures; meet the staff of Hypnosis
Workshop. If you find you are interested further, you
may take our hypnotic susceptibility test, and—if you
like—register for the course. Our phone is 322-2992.
