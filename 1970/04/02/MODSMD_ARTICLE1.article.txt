# Bomb Rumors
## Violence Deplored 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Provost Richard Lyman said
yesterday that he believed some
of the anti-ROTC demonstrators
Tuesday night might have been
carrying dynamite and Molotov
cocktails (firebombs).
Lyman told the Daily "the
sources from which I have it are
numerous enough and involved
enough for me to believe. I don't
have enough evidence to go to
court with though . . ."
A check of Daily sources
revealed that several of them had
seen or heard demonstrators
bragging about dynamite or
Molotov cocktails. None however
were able to identify those
involved.
Michael Sweeney, a member of
the anti-ROTC Movement, had
this reply:
"I was carrying an H-bomb,
but it was so dark that nobody
saw it. Lyman is just trying to
scare the demonstrators. He's a
paid liar. Lyman also says he's
against the war, but the fact is
that he's doing his best to support
the war machine."
A total of $5500 worth of
damage was done Tuesday night,
Lyman said. He added that
another $1000 will be needed to
pay overtime to Stanford police.
No Identifications
Because of darkness, the
University was unable to identify
any of those involved.
"Stanford is determined,"
Pitzer said, "to do everything
possible, within the boundaries
appropriate to an academic
community, to protect ourselves
from personal injury and property
destruction.
"It is regretable that the
University has had to request
outside police assistance on at
least three similar occasions
during the past year, for each
instance marks a failure of our
community to exercise its own
capacity for self control and
governance."
Pitzer went on to praise the
Santa Clara County sheriff's
deputies for the speed and
restraint they used in controlling
the crowd.
The crowd of about 200 to
250 people broke the windows in
a protest against ROTC. There
were no arrests or injuries though
the Santa Clara Sheriff alleges that
several of his men were hit by
rocks.

Police Warning
Sheriff Charles Prelsnik
warned, "We will arrest those
demonstrators throwing rocks at
people and charge them with
assault with a deadly weapon."
The charge is a felony under
California law and punishable by
up to ten years in prison and a
$5000 fine.
Prelsnik said he thought
carefully before he made a
statement, and maintained it was
not intended "as a challenge or a
provocation."
The ASSU Council of
Presidents also issued a statement
deploring the violence. "The sad
truth is that these actions
confront the Establishment with a
fait accompli. The only course of
action is a react-on which tries to
meet the counterforce and stop its
actions. The result: arrests,
injuries, ugly moods on both
sides.
"This only leads to a further
hardening of opinion w'lich all
but overlooks the essential
questions and centers on tactics.
"Violence begets violence.
Nothing permanent can be gained
in this University through coercive
mob action and destruction."
'It Was Fake'
Student Senator Doug
McHenry had a different
objection: "It was so fake: there
wasn't any emotion. I believed in
going to the ROTC (the first step
of the demonstrators) to show
how pissed off we were at the
conflict of interest of 13 or 14
people voting in the ROTC
decision.
"I didn't believe in going over
to the other buildings and
breaking windows: we want to
politicize people, not alienate
them. The negative actions now
outweigh the issue."
Speaking as an individual, Prof.
Daniel Bershader, vice-chairman
of aeronautics and astronautics
called the window breaking in the
Durand Building "clearly an act of
deliberate vandalism, reminiscent
of the mob terror one associates
with the old Nazi storm trooper
tactics."
A Threat
He continued, "It represents a
threat to the freedom and rights
of all members of the Stanford
community. Successful pursuit of
our programs of teaching,
scholarly research, and related
cultural and intellectual activities
requires an absolutely coercion

free atmosphere. Indeed freedom
of any kind requires a minimal
base of law and order.
"Those of us concerned with
the preservation of academic
freedom should do what we can
to identify the vandals in this
case, in order to insure that
appropriate action is taken in
accordance with existing
regulations. If we make the
mistake of assuming a completely
passive attitude, the situation will
only grow worse."
