# One Mans Phantasy
## Isaiah And ROTC: A Prayer 
### Nick Selby 
The vision of Nicholas inspired
of Isiah, which he saw concerning
Amerika and Stanford in the days
of Nixon, Packard, Fitzer, and
Brooks, fools in search of the
whirlwind:
"Ah, sinful nation, a people
laden with iniquity, offspring of
evildoers, sons who deal corruptly:
You and your faculty have joined
yourselves with death and made a
pact with Satan; you approve the
generals and credit those who
learn murder.
"Therefore the LORD says,
'Al, I will vent my wrath on my
enemies, and avenge myself on my
foes. You starve my children, you
kill my sons; the rice farmers,
they also you attack.' He is the
LORD of hosts and his wrath is
great.

"My people go into exile for
want of knowledge Far to the
north have lhey fled, seeking
justice, seeking charity. They have
heard your lies, hypocrites, they
have heard your logic, fools. Can
you teach the art of life while you
teach the art of death? Can vou
preserve as you destroy?
" 'We shall be wise and
compromise,' says the President,
the arm-twister, 'We shall gain
money lor our scholars as we sell
our souls. We have learned to
compromise with death and
slaughter, so let us be wise.'
Deserted Cities
How long, O LORD? 1
asked, 'How long will you avenge
this?"
"Out of the growing whirlwind

He answered, out of the clouds of
doom he called: 'i'titil citics lie
waste without inhabitant, and
houses without men. unit the lund
is utterly desolate, until then shall
I punish.'
"Therefore I say unto you.
heed the promise of the LORD,
for the haughty looks of man shall
he brought low. and the pride of
men shall he humbled The
professors with their robes, the
learned with their titles, they shall
he brought low also.
" Woe to those who draw
iniquity with cords of falsehood
Woe to those who call evil flood
and good evil, who put darkness
for light and light for darkness,
who put bitter for sweet and
sweet for bitter. Woe to those
who are wise in their own eyes,
and shrewd in their own sight.
Hypocritical Pro Is
"Woe unto you, professors,
woe unto you, hypocrites, killers.
For you call yourselves wise and
think as serpents, you call
yourselves shrewd and figure like
adders. Be glad with your money:
your governors support your
school, be glad for the generals
and their money. Your day is
coming.
"Woe to you, destroyer, who
yourself have not been destroyed.
you treacherous one, with who
none has dealt treacherously!
When you and your boys have
ceased to destroy, you will be
destroyed, and when you and
your soldiers have made an end of
dealing treacherously, you will be
dealt with treacherously.
Voting Oppression
"Woe to those who decree
iniquitous resolutions, and the
professors who keep voting
oppression, who turn aside the

needy from justice and rob the
poor of their right. In the end
your offices shall crumble, your
homes shall be swallowed by the
earth.
"Your fee! run to evil, you
make haste to shed innocent
blood, your thoughts are thoughts
of iniquity; desolation and
destruction are in your highways.
The way of peace you know not,
and there is no justice in your
paths.
"What will you do on the day
of punishment, in the storm
which will come from afar? To
whom will you flee for help, and
where will you leave your wealth ?
"Behold, you sinners, you
vipers, you who approve of
murder, the day of the LOUD
comes, cruel with wrath and fierce
anger, to make the earth a
desolation and to destroy its
sinners from it.
"Already the earth mourns and
withers, the world languishes and
withers; already the heavens
languish with the earth. The earth
lies polluted under its inhabitants.
Behold, professors, the day of the
LORD shall come."
Visionary Gleam
Thus spoke Isaiah, in my
vision. And I prayed to the
LORD, that we all, hypocrites,
professors, petulant
window-smashers, all might be
spared:
"... in our sins we have been
a long time, and shall we be
sewed? We have ALL become like
one who is unclear, and ALL our
righteous deeds are like a polluted
garment . . .Be not exceedingly
angry, O LORD, and remember
not iniquity for ever. Behold,
consider, we are ALL thy
people."
