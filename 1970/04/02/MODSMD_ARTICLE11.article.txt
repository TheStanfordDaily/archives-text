# Who Pays?
## The 						Windows War 
### D. McGuire 
"I just finished boarding up
$5,000 worth of windows," said
the carpenter. "Somebody is
going to have to pay for that.
They are going to take it away
from me."
This man, a Stanford worker,
raised a vital political question.
Who is going to pay for that
broken glass at the ROTC offices,
the Business School and the Aero
and Astro building?
In one way or another, the
University will probably tell its
employees that they must "share
the cost." For some time now,
Stanford has been under strong
compulsion to keep wages down,
avoid paying for retirement and
other benefits, and cut the payroll
by eliminating jobs. The fact that
windows are becoming trash will
provide a handy opportunity to
blame the economic squeeze on
student radicals.
Tennis Klliow
Several things should be
pointed out. For one thing, every
revolutionary on this campus will
have a bad case of tennis elbow
before the movement can throw
enough stones to equal the cost of

one B 52 load of TNT. Every time
the Vietnamese shoot down a
Phantom jet they cost the United
States more than militant
dissenters have managed to tote
up since Freedom Summer.
And we must remember that
Vietnamese people have paid for
every one of those jets with their
lives.
But there is a more important
aspect to this question. Why is the
University having a "fiscal crisis"
in the first place?
Fiscal Crisis
Everybody has to pay more for
what they want these days, and
Stanford is no exception. Prices
are going up because the
government has spent so much
money in the past ten years on
"defense," expensive gadgets that
go to the moon, and the
unsuccessful attempt to subdue
the people of Vietnam. The
economy is like a boil, swollen to
the breaking point. The boil is full
of money.
In order to relieve some of the
pressure, the government must
attempt to drain off some of the
money. So they raise taxes and
cut spending.

Working men pay most of the
taxes. And when the budget is cut
(or when interest rates are raised)
workers are the ones who lose
their jobs. It does not take long to
see who is paying for the war in
Vietnam.
No Contracts
Stanford employees are among
the first to get hurt by the crisis
of inflation. The University
depends heavily on government
contracts. When those contracts
begin to dry up, which is
happening right now, janitors,
carpenters, maids, switch-board
operators and gardeners find
themselves out of work. Those
who escape the lay-off find
themselves working harder and
faster.
To make things worse,
University employees are not
eligible for unemployment
compensation when they are
unemployed. And even if a family
goes on welfare, the money buys
less all the time.
It is clear that workers in
general and Stanford workers in
particular are suffering because
the government and the powerful
corporations are making thorn pay
for economic expansion in
Southeast Asia and elsewhere. It is
clear that they will continue to
suffer until the economy begins to
serve their needs instead of the
needs of insatiable corporations
and their rich owners.
Windows
Which brings us back to
windows. Workers will not have to
pay for that glass. And even if
they had to, the glass will never
cost as much as the war. Workers
will continue to pay for the war
because they do not have any
choice and because the war must
be fought to protect corporate
investments and other interests in
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia and the rest
of the countries down the line.
ROTC is just one part of the
system that keeps the war going.
ROTC must be ended as part of
the process that will eventually
end the war and create a system
that will give workers power over
their own lives.
The attack on ROTC is a small
and primitive part of the struggle
to end the war and change the
system. But it is a move in the
direction of victory. And things
will not get any better until this
victory is won.

they had to, the glass will never
cost as much as the war. Workers
will continue to pay for the war
because they do not have any
choice and because the war must
be fought to protect corporate
investments and other interests in
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia and the rest
of the countries down the line.
ROTC is just one part of the
system that keeps the war going.
ROTC must be ended as part of
the process that will eventually
end the war and create a system
that will give workers power over
their own lives.
The attack on ROTC is a small
and primitive part of the struggle
to end the war and change the
system. But it is a move in the
direction of victory. And things
will not get any better until this
victory is won.
"I just finished boarding up
$5,000 worth of windows," said
the carpenter. "Somebody is
going to have to pay for that.
They are going to take it away
from me."
This man, a Stanford worker,
raised a vital political question.
Who is going to pay for that
broken glass at the ROTC offices,
the Business School and the Aero
and Astro building?
In one way or another, the
University will probably tell its
employees that they must "share
the cost." For some time now,
Stanford has been under strong
compulsion to keep wages down,
avoid paying for retirement and
other benefits, and cut the payroll
by eliminating jobs. The fact that
windows are becoming trash will
provide a handy opportunity to
blame the economic squeeze on
student radicals.
Tennis Klliow
Several things should be
pointed out. For one thing, every
revolutionary on this campus will
have a bad case of tennis elbow
before the movement can throw
enough stones to equal the cost of

one B 52 load of TNT. Every time
the Vietnamese shoot down a
Phantom jet they cost the United
States more than militant
dissenters have managed to tote
up since Freedom Summer.
And we must remember that
Vietnamese people have paid for
every one of those jets with their
lives.
But there is a more important
aspect to this question. Why is the
University having a "fiscal crisis"
in the first place?
Fiscal Crisis
Everybody has to pay more for
what they want these days, and
Stanford is no exception. Prices
are going up because the
government has spent so much
money in the past ten years on
"defense," expensive gadgets that
go to the moon, and the
unsuccessful attempt to subdue
the people of Vietnam. The
economy is like a boil, swollen to
the breaking point. The boil is full
of money.
In order to relieve some of the
pressure, the government must
attempt to drain off some of the
money. So they raise taxes and
cut spending.

Working men pay most of the
taxes. And when the budget is cut
(or when interest rates are raised)
workers are the ones who lose
their jobs. It does not take long to
see who is paying for the war in
Vietnam.
No Contracts
Stanford employees are among
the first to get hurt by the crisis
of inflation. The University
depends heavily on government
contracts. When those contracts
begin to dry up, which is
happening right now, janitors,
carpenters, maids, switch-board
operators and gardeners find
themselves out of work. Those
who escape the lay-off find
themselves working harder and
faster.
To make things worse,
University employees are not
eligible for unemployment
compensation when they are
unemployed. And even if a family
goes on welfare, the money buys
less all the time.
It is clear that workers in
general and Stanford workers in
particular are suffering because
the government and the powerful
corporations are making thorn pay
for economic expansion in
Southeast Asia and elsewhere. It is
clear that they will continue to
suffer until the economy begins to
serve their needs instead of the
needs of insatiable corporations
and their rich owners.
