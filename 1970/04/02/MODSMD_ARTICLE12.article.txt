# Environmental Teach-In
## 
### 
While the rest of the nation's
colleges focus on teaching
environmental problems on
April 22 Earth Day, Stanford,
too, is moving towards a day of
action.
Better known as simply the
"environmental teach-in,"
colleges and universities across
the country have been planning
a nationally coordinated day of
informing their campuses and
surrounding communities about
causes and solutions to the
deteriorating environment.
Action Theme
Action will be the theme
locally at Stanford. April 22 has
been labelled END Day, for
Environment Near Death.
Highlighting the program on
April 22 will be an ecology fair.
It will be opened by Stephanie
Mills, currently editor of Earth
Times, an environmental
underground newspaper, and
Eddie Albert, star of television's
"Green Acres" and an active
conservationist.
An evening panel at 7:30 in
Memorial Church will focus on a
mixed media presentation of
Bay Area ecological and
environmental problems. Slated
to moderate the panel is Joshua

Lederberg, Nobel Laureate
geneticist. Accompanying him
will be Steve Weissman, local
activist, Congressman "Pete"
McCloskey, and Professor
George Reichl of San Francisco
State College, an expert in
ecological affairs. Walter Hickle,
Secretary of the Interior, has
been invited to be the federal
representative and fifth member
of the panel.
The panel and the fair will
delineate what people can do
here on the mid-peninsula to
help clean up the air and water,
to stop the destruction of the
Bay and the local forests, and to
cope with the ever-expanding
population.
The fair, to be located on
Stanford's Main Quad, White
Plaza, or both, will feature
booths demonstrating such
things as organic gardening and
informing people about action
groups such as Ecology Action,
Zero Population Growth, and
the Environmental Law Society.
Booths with childrens: games
will be included. A day-long
series of slide shows and
documentary ecological films
will be showing at various
Stanford auditoriums.
Cars Abandoned
Also in keeping with the

theme of action, the END Day
committee is asking for students,
faculty, and staff to ride bicycles
to Stanford for the day, and
wherever possible in the local
communities citizens are
requested to ride their bikes to
take the bus, abandoning the
automobile for the day.
Community members are
invited to bring their suppers to
the campus for a large
community feast. In this way it
will be easier to attend both the
fair and panel, and will
hopefully generate a community
spirit of togetherness.
To insure continuing action,
Wednesday, the 22nd's activities
will be followed up by a series of
workshops on Saturday, April
25. These workshops will relate
to such specific topics as logging,
water and air pollution,
environmental engineering, the
ghetto and barrio, in addition to
Vietnam and the environment.
Also scheduled are special
sessions for lawyers, high school
teachers, and city councilmen
and county supervisors.
Prior to April 22 the Stanford
END day committee will be
running action programs in the
dormitories. From April 1 thru 8
students will listen to speakers.

presented on a two dorms a

On the weekend before April
22 groups of students and
citizens will canvass local homes,
carrying a special edition of
Cross Currents magazine devoted
to investigate articles on the
environment, interviews with
politicians for their view and
action plans, if any, to inform
the voter, and action guidelines
for the citizen (the so-called
"silent majority.")
Some canvassers will be
carrying a questionaire, which
will attempt to measure local
sympathy for environmental
problems and willingness of local
people to work and to support
improvement campaigns.
Stanford students have also
laid the groundwork for
collection network for old
papers and cans for recycling.
Two dormitories and the School
of Education lounge are now
collecting aluminum cans. This
(action will be spread to a wider
base and will include paper
collection as well.

Better known as simply the
"environmental teach-in,"
colleges and universities across
the country have been planning
a nationally coordinated day of
informing their campuses and
surrounding communities about
causes and solutions to the

Action Theme
Action will be the theme
locally at Stanford. April 22 has
been labelled END Day, for
Environment Near Death.
Highlighting the program on
April 22 will be an ecology fair.
It will be opened by Stephanie
Mills, currently editor of Earth

George Reichl of San Francisco
State College, an expert in
ecological affairs. Walter Hickle,
Secretary of the Interior, has
been invited to be the federal

help clean up the air and water,
to stop the destruction of the
Bay and the local forests, and to
cope with the ever-expanding
population.
The fair, to be located on
Stanford's Main Quad, White
Plaza, or both, will feature
booths demonstrating such
things as organic gardening and
informing people about action
