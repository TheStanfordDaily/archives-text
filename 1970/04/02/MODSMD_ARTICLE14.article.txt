# Fire Fighters File Petition
## 
### ED KOHN 
Union members at Stanford's
Fire Department have filed a
petition with the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) asking
that the Teamsters Union, which
is trying to organize Physical Plant
employees, be barred from
seeking representation rights for
Fire Department employees.
The firemen, members of the
International Association of Fire

Fighters (lAFF), a branch of the
AFL-CIO, are worried that the
Teamsters might try to
incorporate them in any
campus-wide organizing effort
they might make.
"We have filed a petition to
protect our local," said Gary
Dufresne, president of 1-12, the
lAFF local. "If we didn't file a
petition (with the NLRB), we
could be pulled into the

Teamsters Union under a
technicality."
Dufresne said that 1-12 was
acting on advice of its counsel, the
IAFF, and the Santa Clara County
Professional Fire Fighters, a group
of 1200 unionized firemen. He
said that the professional
organization was covering the
legal expenses connected with the
petition, which was filed March
11.
Location Uncertain
Jim Farley, an NLRB
spokesman in San Francisco, said
that he was not sure "where the
petition is at this point."
However, he doubted that any
action would be taken on the
firemen's petition before a ruling
is handed down on a Teamsters
petition which is also before the
Board.
The Teamsters petitioned the
NLRB Feb. 18 to take jurisdiction
of Stanford's labor affairs. In the
past the NLRB has refused to act
in cases involving a non-profit
educational institution; the
University has also refused to
recognize any union seeking
on-campus representation rights.
The San Francisco NLRB
office refused to act on the matter
and sent the petition to
Washington for "advice." Harley
indicated that the 1-12 petition
would probably be sent to
Washington in the near future to
be acted upon with the Teamster
petition.
Shorter Workweek
1-12 president Dufresne said
that some firefighters are
members of the Teamsters Union,
but that "it hasn't worked out too
well" where this is the case.
Although the University has
not recognized 1-12 officially as
an on-campus union local, the
officers of the group have been
negotiating with administration
and business office officials in an
attempt to obtain higher salaries,
earlier retirement and better
benefits. Dufresne said that he
was "reasonably satisfied" after
the six negotiating sessions held so
far, but added that "We have yet
to face the big issues," including
salaries.
He said that University officials
will not discuss salaries until April
30 for theyear starting Sept. 1.
However, Dufresne pointed out
that among other benefits, the
firemen have already won a
reduction in their workweek from
67.2 to 56 hours, which has
become the standard workweek
for firemen in Santa Clara
County. The shorter hours will
take effect Sept. 1.
Thirty-two of 40 eligible
firemen are now members of 1-12,
which received its charter in
October, 1969. Only seven
high-ranking officers and the
master mechanic are not members
of the group.
