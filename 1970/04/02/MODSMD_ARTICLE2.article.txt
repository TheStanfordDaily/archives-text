# Eating Clubs Safe Despite One Closing
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Despite the closing of one club, Stanford Eating Clubs are not in
danger of bankruptcy, according to Brad Weeks, S.E.C. General.
Manager.
El Capitan did not reopen Spring Quarter due to insufficient
membership. The 'L' as the club complex is called, is still solvent.
The Eating Clubs share a central bank account which is subdivided
into individual accounts for bookkeeping purposes. When one club
loses money, it is given a "loan" by the other clubs.
During fall quarter only two clubs made profits, and S.E.C. lost
money. Weeks said four clubs finished in the black winter quarter and
will show a profit again this spring.
At least one club, El Cuadro, is still experiencing serious financial
difficulties. Again, low membership is mainly responsible.
Weeks expressed confidence about the future of the "L' . "I feel
the eating clubs offer one of the most attractive living experiences on
campus," the senior member of El Tigre stated. "It allows a student to
eat with people he does not necessarily live with, to meet students
from off-campus, from the trailers and the graduate living units as well
as residents of Toyon."
The clubs differ in personality and activities, but most offer social
programs and field intramural teams in addition to providing a place
to eat. All but one, Toro, are co-ed.
Weeks could not speculate on the future of El Capitan, but said he
hoped it could be reopened. He mentioned the possibility of its use by
some campus group, but emphasized that concrete plans were being
made at this time.
Returning to the financial difficulties of the "L" as a whole, Weeks
dismissed the prospect of University aid in the form of a subsidy.
"We're completely autonomous now," he commented, "and we want
to stav that wav "
