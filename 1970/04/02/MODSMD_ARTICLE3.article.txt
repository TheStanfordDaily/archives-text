LIBERTY, N.Y. (AP) - Arthur J.
Goldberg touched off a furor at
the Democratic State Committee
meeting Wednesday night by
winning the party's designation
for governor, declaring he would
reject the endorsement and then
announcing he was accepting it.
Goldberg's assertion that he
was rejecting the designation
because he preferred to get on the
ballot by way of a primary,
touched off a clamor of hissing
and booing among many of the
delegates.
Amid a general hubub,
Goldberg returned to the rostrum
and declared he never intended to
reject the designation but that he
intended to "go the petition route
in addition to that designation.
"I said I was very honored to
be designated by this body as its
candidate," Goldberg said.
"Therefore I accept the
designation."
His effort to reassure the
committeemen was less than
successful. One delegate shouted
from the floor, "He's making a
mockery of our convention."
In making his unprecedented
initial announcement rejecting the
designation, Goldberg also said
that former U.S. Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark would head a
"broadly representative citizens'
committee" to supervise the
primary campaign.
Goldberg also said he was
endorsing Negro State Sen. Basil
A. Paterson's bid to run for
lieutenant governor. He said it was
time for New York State to have a
black candidate "for a statewide
office of this magnitude."
Panther Raid
LOS ANGELES (AP) A
Superior Court judge says police
acted illegally last December when
they raided two Black Panther
buildings in a weapons roundup.
He upheld the validity of a third
search-and-seizure warrant.
The decision Wednesday by
Judge Alfred J. McCourtney
prompted defense attorney Leo
Branton Jr. to predict that four
arrested at the two buildings
would be freed.
McCourtney said another judge
who signed the "no-knock"

warrant permitting officers to
enter the two buildings
unannounced lacked sufficient
evidence that it would be
dangerous to enter them
otherwise.
McCourtney agreed, however,
there was reason to believe danger
existed at the third building—the
main Panther party headquarters
on South Central Avenue. This is
where most of the 18 Panthers
facing trial were arrested and
where a predawn shootout left
several persons wounded.
No War
BOSTON (AP) - The
Massacusettts Legislature enacted
Wednesday a bill which would bar
Massachusetts residents from
serving in any war not declared by
Congress.
The bill aims to set up a test of
the legality of the Vietnam war by
institution of court action by the
state to bring the question to the
Supreme Court of the United
States.
It was enacted by the
40-member Senate on a roll call of
29-3. Earlier the House enacted it
on a voice vote after a test roll call
of 127-92 rejected a move to kill
the measure outright.
The bill was sent immediately
to the office of Gov. Francis W.
Sargent, who has not indicated
whether he will sign it. Sargent
said he will make the decision
Thursday.
Air Controllers
WASHINGTON (AP) - Air traffic
controllers remained off the job in
large numbers Wednesday and
officials had little hope for a
quick end to the dispute that has
restricted air traffic across the
country for more than a week.
The government said some
controllers returned to work
following a call Tuesday by their
union leaders to end the sick-call
action, but not enough to make
any noticeable difference.
Fewer planes—both military
and commercial—were flying.
Delays from a few minutes to two
hours were reported in the
Northeast, the area hardest hit by
the walkout of the Professional

Air Traffic Controllers
Organization. And to make things
worse, a major snow storm
blanketed the Midwest.
TWA and American Airlines
both reported 30 percent of their
nationwide flights canceled.
United canceled 16 percent.
