# ROTC Protests Continue, Four Marchers Arrested
## 
### 
Police arrested four persons
and at least three others were
clubbed as an ti -ROTC
demonstrations entered the
second night of increasingly angry
protest.
About a dozen windows were
broken in the ROTC-Athletic
Department building, but other
buildings were left untouched by
the loosely organized crowd.
Police charged more frequently
and pursued demonstrators longer
than on Tuesday night. The crowd
initially scattered from the ROTC
building, but reformed near the
Business School, Demonstrators
then milled through and beside
the Quad. Police pursued, and the
crowd swung toward the
Undergraduate Library and
ultimately toward Wilbur Hall in a
series of running dodges of police
lines.
Two students, freshman David
Smothers and junior Brooks
Yeager; and two non-students,
Charles Noble and Lewis Soffer,
were charged with assault with a
deadly weapon. This felony
charge can be made for throwing
rocks at people.
Some demonstrators reported
being hit with police riot batons,
and others said the right-wing
counter-demonstrators struck
them. English professor Bruce
Franklin, Leonard Siegel, and
Daily reporter Phil Revzin
reported that the counter-protes
tors sprayed them in the eyes with
an irritating agent.

The evening began with a
Cubberlv meeting called to discuss
further action against the presence
of ROTC on campus. For three
hours a crowd of 350 debated
alternatives—a sit-in, disruption of
ROTC classes and drills, boarding
up the building, and others.
The group voted to disrupt
classes and to make an attempt
like the one Tuesday night to
board up the ROTC building.
At 10:30 the meeting broke up
and the crowd divided itself into
six "affinity groups" smaller
action units. The demonstrators,
now numbering less than 300,
moved toward ROTC
headquarters in the Athletic
Building. Nearing the structure,
they split into groups to approach
it from two angles.
Half a dozen counter-demon
strators awaited the marchers at
the door, as they had the night
before. Although a few
anti-ROTC protesters urged them
to move out of the way, the small
band refused to step aside.
With no police in sight, the
marchers clustered around the
entrance ana began to board it up
with several large planks. A few
rocks were thrown at the second
floor windows of the ROTC
offices.
Within ten minutes after the
crowd's arrival, two busses of
Santa Clara County police pulled
into the area, one at each end of
the ROTC block of Galvez St.
The demonstrators retreated

quickly across Galvez and
scattered into a vacant field as
police lines formed and moved
down the street.
As the demonstrators
regrouped across the street, a
police jeep equipped with
loudspeakers and floodlights
drove forward. Several rocks were
thrown at the police as a voice
announced over speakers that the
demonstration was unlawful.
Then a small scuffle broke out
amidst the protestors when several
plainclothes police tried to arrest
a demonstrator.
The police then charged
forward and the demonstrators
fled down Memorial Way toward
the Business School. The deputies
followed the crowd until the
group scattered.
Most of the students regrouped
in front of the Business School on
Serra St.and discussed in their
affinity groups whether to return
to the ROTC building. Three of
the groups had voted to return
when a busload of police abruptly
arrived and chased the
demonstrators toward the Main
Quad entrance.
Having dwindled to 150 by
now, the group drifted through
the main quad area past President
Kenneth Pitzer's office and
through the archway to the lawn
in front of the main library.
Suddenly the police began
marching slowly up the mall and
the protestors retreated to the
Bookstore parking lot. The
deputies paused momentarily,
then a squad of four charged from
a flank into the milling crowd.
Two of the fleeing
demonstrators were knocked
down by police. Seeing this the
crowd retreated slowly, throwing
stones and shouting angrily at the
police.
At this point the deputies
stopped their advance and the
students paused along the curb of
Alvarado and Salvatierra Sts. In
one cluster of the crowd, students

identified two plainclothes police
dressed in Army fatigue jackets
and Levi's.
"Why are You here?" yelled
some of the demonstrators.
"We're just freelancing. We're
here to help you. Doing our
thing," replied one of the
undercover deputies nervously. As
the crowd quickly grew angrier,
the two slipped away back to the
police lines.
By 11:45 the crowd wandered
to the intersection of Escondido
and Galvez to regroup and discuss
the evening's activities. A number
of the protestors suggested that
the crowd move farther down
Escondido so that more students
from the dormitories would join
in.
Suddenly an empty police bus
roared around the corner with its
horn blaring. The group panicked
and students ran to either side of
the street. Some paused to throw
rocks at the bus as it careened by.
Cursing and yelling, the crowd
then reassembled on the Wilbur
lawn.
At the Cubberly meeting,
protestors set plans for today
which include auditing of ROTC
classes at 10 a.m., meeting of
affinity group leaders at 3 p.m. in
the Serra lounge, and a planned
march on the ROTC headquarters
at 9 p.m. from Cubberly.

"We're just freelancing. We're
here to help you. Doing our
thing," replied one of the
undercover deputies nervously. As
the crowd quickly grew angrier,
the two slipped away back to the
police lines.
By 11:45 the crowd wandered
to the intersection of Escondido
and Galvez to regroup and discuss
the evening's activities. A number
of the protestors suggested that
the crowd move farther down
Escondido so that more students
from the dormitories would join
in.
Suddenly an empty police bus
roared around the corner with its
horn blaring. The group panicked
and students ran to either side of
the street. Some paused to throw
rocks at the bus as it careened by.
Cursing and yelling, the crowd
then reassembled on the Wilbur
lawn.
At the Cubberly meeting,
protestors set plans for today
which include auditing of ROTC
classes at 10 a.m., meeting of
affinity group leaders at 3 p.m. in
the Serra lounge, and a planned
march on the ROTC headquarters
at 9 p.m. from Cubberly.
Police arrested four persons
and at least three others were
clubbed as an ti -ROTC
demonstrations entered the
second night of increasingly angry
protest.
About a dozen windows were
broken in the ROTC-Athletic
Department building, but other
buildings were left untouched by
the loosely organized crowd.
Police charged more frequently
and pursued demonstrators longer
than on Tuesday night. The crowd
initially scattered from the ROTC
building, but reformed near the
Business School, Demonstrators
then milled through and beside
the Quad. Police pursued, and the
crowd swung toward the
Undergraduate Library and
ultimately toward Wilbur Hall in a
series of running dodges of police
lines.
Two students, freshman David
Smothers and junior Brooks
Yeager; and two non-students,
Charles Noble and Lewis Soffer,
were charged with assault with a
deadly weapon. This felony
charge can be made for throwing
rocks at people.
Some demonstrators reported
being hit with police riot batons,
and others said the right-wing
counter-demonstrators struck
them. English professor Bruce
Franklin, Leonard Siegel, and
Daily reporter Phil Revzin
reported that the counter-protes
tors sprayed them in the eyes with
an irritating agent.

The evening began with a
Cubberlv meeting called to discuss
further action against the presence
of ROTC on campus. For three
hours a crowd of 350 debated
alternatives—a sit-in, disruption of
ROTC classes and drills, boarding
up the building, and others.
The group voted to disrupt
classes and to make an attempt
like the one Tuesday night to
board up the ROTC building.
At 10:30 the meeting broke up
and the crowd divided itself into
six "affinity groups" smaller
action units. The demonstrators,
now numbering less than 300,
moved toward ROTC
headquarters in the Athletic
Building. Nearing the structure,
they split into groups to approach
it from two angles.
Half a dozen counter-demon
strators awaited the marchers at
the door, as they had the night
before. Although a few
anti-ROTC protesters urged them
to move out of the way, the small
band refused to step aside.
With no police in sight, the
marchers clustered around the
entrance ana began to board it up
with several large planks. A few
rocks were thrown at the second
floor windows of the ROTC
offices.
Within ten minutes after the
crowd's arrival, two busses of
Santa Clara County police pulled
into the area, one at each end of
the ROTC block of Galvez St.
The demonstrators retreated

quickly across Galvez and
scattered into a vacant field as
police lines formed and moved
down the street.
As the demonstrators
regrouped across the street, a
police jeep equipped with
loudspeakers and floodlights
drove forward. Several rocks were
thrown at the police as a voice
announced over speakers that the
demonstration was unlawful.
Then a small scuffle broke out
amidst the protestors when several
plainclothes police tried to arrest
a demonstrator.
The police then charged
forward and the demonstrators
fled down Memorial Way toward
the Business School. The deputies
followed the crowd until the
group scattered.
Most of the students regrouped
in front of the Business School on
Serra St.and discussed in their
affinity groups whether to return
to the ROTC building. Three of
the groups had voted to return
when a busload of police abruptly
arrived and chased the
demonstrators toward the Main
Quad entrance.
Having dwindled to 150 by
now, the group drifted through
the main quad area past President
Kenneth Pitzer's office and
through the archway to the lawn
in front of the main library.
Suddenly the police began
marching slowly up the mall and
the protestors retreated to the
Bookstore parking lot. The
deputies paused momentarily,
then a squad of four charged from
a flank into the milling crowd.
Two of the fleeing
demonstrators were knocked
down by police. Seeing this the
crowd retreated slowly, throwing
stones and shouting angrily at the
police.
At this point the deputies
stopped their advance and the
students paused along the curb of
Alvarado and Salvatierra Sts. In
one cluster of the crowd, students

identified two plainclothes police
dressed in Army fatigue jackets
and Levi's.
"Why are You here?" yelled
some of the demonstrators.
"We're just freelancing. We're
here to help you. Doing our
thing," replied one of the
undercover deputies nervously. As

Serra St.and discussed in their
affinity groups whether to return
to the ROTC building. Three of
the groups had voted to return
when a busload of police abruptly
arrived and chased the
demonstrators toward the Main
Quad entrance.
Having dwindled to 150 by
now, the group drifted through
the main quad area past President
Kenneth Pitzer's office and
through the archway to the lawn
in front of the main library.
Suddenly the police began
marching slowly up the mall and
the protestors retreated to the
Bookstore parking lot. The
deputies paused momentarily,
then a squad of four charged from
a flank into the milling crowd.
Two of the fleeing
demonstrators were knocked
down by police. Seeing this the
crowd retreated slowly, throwing
stones and shouting angrily at the
police.
At this point the deputies
stopped their advance and the
students paused along the curb of
Alvarado and Salvatierra Sts. In
one cluster of the crowd, students

identified two plainclothes police
dressed in Army fatigue jackets
and Levi's.
"Why are You here?" yelled
some of the demonstrators.
"We're just freelancing. We're
here to help you. Doing our
thing," replied one of the
undercover deputies nervously. As
the crowd quickly grew angrier,
the two slipped away back to the
police lines.
By 11:45 the crowd wandered
to the intersection of Escondido
and Galvez to regroup and discuss
the evening's activities. A number
of the protestors suggested that
the crowd move farther down
Escondido so that more students
from the dormitories would join
in.
Suddenly an empty police bus
roared around the corner with its
horn blaring. The group panicked
and students ran to either side of
the street. Some paused to throw
rocks at the bus as it careened by.
Cursing and yelling, the crowd
then reassembled on the Wilbur
lawn.
At the Cubberly meeting,
protestors set plans for today
which include auditing of ROTC
classes at 10 a.m., meeting of
affinity group leaders at 3 p.m. in
the Serra lounge, and a planned
march on the ROTC headquarters
at 9 p.m. from Cubberly.
Police arrested four persons
and at least three others were
clubbed as an ti -ROTC
demonstrations entered the
second night of increasingly angry
protest.
About a dozen windows were
broken in the ROTC-Athletic
Department building, but other
buildings were left untouched by
the loosely organized crowd.
Police charged more frequently
and pursued demonstrators longer
than on Tuesday night. The crowd
initially scattered from the ROTC
building, but reformed near the
Business School, Demonstrators
then milled through and beside
the Quad. Police pursued, and the
crowd swung toward the
Undergraduate Library and
ultimately toward Wilbur Hall in a
series of running dodges of police
lines.
Two students, freshman David
Smothers and junior Brooks
Yeager; and two non-students,
Charles Noble and Lewis Soffer,
were charged with assault with a
deadly weapon. This felony
charge can be made for throwing
rocks at people.
Some demonstrators reported
being hit with police riot batons,
and others said the right-wing
counter-demonstrators struck
them. English professor Bruce
Franklin, Leonard Siegel, and
Daily reporter Phil Revzin
reported that the counter-protes
tors sprayed them in the eyes with
an irritating agent.

The evening began with a
Cubberlv meeting called to discuss
further action against the presence
of ROTC on campus. For three
hours a crowd of 350 debated
alternatives—a sit-in, disruption of
ROTC classes and drills, boarding
up the building, and others.
The group voted to disrupt
classes and to make an attempt
like the one Tuesday night to
board up the ROTC building.
At 10:30 the meeting broke up
and the crowd divided itself into
six "affinity groups" smaller
action units. The demonstrators,
now numbering less than 300,
moved toward ROTC
headquarters in the Athletic
Building. Nearing the structure,
they split into groups to approach
it from two angles.
Half a dozen counter-demon
strators awaited the marchers at
the door, as they had the night
before. Although a few
anti-ROTC protesters urged them
to move out of the way, the small
band refused to step aside.
With no police in sight, the
marchers clustered around the
entrance ana began to board it up
with several large planks. A few
rocks were thrown at the second
floor windows of the ROTC
offices.
Within ten minutes after the
crowd's arrival, two busses of
Santa Clara County police pulled
into the area, one at each end of
the ROTC block of Galvez St.
The demonstrators retreated

quickly across Galvez and
scattered into a vacant field as
police lines formed and moved
down the street.
As the demonstrators
regrouped across the street, a
police jeep equipped with
loudspeakers and floodlights
drove forward. Several rocks were
thrown at the police as a voice
announced over speakers that the
demonstration was unlawful.
Then a small scuffle broke out
amidst the protestors when several
plainclothes police tried to arrest
a demonstrator.
The police then charged
forward and the demonstrators
fled down Memorial Way toward
the Business School. The deputies
followed the crowd until the
group scattered.
