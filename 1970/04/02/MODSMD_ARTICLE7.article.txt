# Noon March To Encina Presesents 'Injunction'
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
One hundred fifty
demonstrators marched to Encina
Hall yesterday and presented a
mock "injunction" to Vice
President for Business Alf
Brandon demanding a stop to the
construction of the Dillingham
project.
The "injunction" said the
University "has leased its vast
lands with primary regard for
profit and considerable disregard
for the needs of the People of the
area."
The march to Encina followed
a noon rally at White Plaza that
attracted a crowd of about 250.
At the rally, Paul Rupert, a leader
of the Grass Roots protest
organization, said that hindrance
of the building of the Dillingham
project would discourage future
investors who might damage

"They don't want to ris«\ ineir
money on a bad investment, and
we'll make it a bad investment,"
Rupert declared.
There were no incidents at
Encina Hall when 100 of the 150
marchers entered, presented
Brandon with the "injunction"
and entered the Planning Office.
There the protestors
ceremoniously placed copies of
the injunction on a large model of
the entire Stanford land
development.
Small toy houses were also
placed on the ROTC and
Aerospace buildings, symbolizing
the group's desire for Stanford to
devote more land to low cost
housing instead of buildings tiod
to the military-industrial complex.
Rally in City
At the rally Grass Roots
announced that they would
demonstrate at 1 p.m. today at

headquarters of the Dillingham
Corporation in San Francisco.
The group plans to smash a
model of the Dillingham project
and carry the pieces to the office
of the corporation, located on the
31st floor of the Wells Fargo Bank
building.
At Encina the protestors
symbolically read the
"injunction" on the steps of the
building, entered the lobby and
the Planning Office, and then left
after a few minutes. A few of the
group circulated throughout the
building distributing leaflets.
The "injunction" forbids
Stanford from leasing its lands
"without collective decision;"
from constructing the Dillingham
building and the Palo Alto Square;
from further developing the
Coyote Hill area; and from
"continued with-holding of the
large tracts of land suitable for
low-income housing from these
persons who most need it."
Construction Slated
The Dillingham Palo Alto
Square project lease has already
been signed and construction is
scheduled to start soon. The
project, valued at $1 5 million, will
include two 10 story office towers
and a 17 story hotel on a 21-acre
site at the corner of El Camino
and Page Mill Roads.
Also at the rally, Diarmuid
McGuire announced last night's
meeting on ROTC. He said that
the only way to get Stanford to
remove ROTC would be to make
it more expensive for the
University to have it stay than for
it to leave.
He said, "The way we make
sure that Stanford will remove
ROTC" is to make sure that it
"knows no peace until Stanford
removes ROTC."
Harvey Hukari, Jr., leader of
the Free Campus Movement,
chanted against the protestors as
the rally was breaking up and at
Encina.
There will be a meeting for all
returning Daily staffers, and
anyone interested in beginning a
career with the Peninsula's only
morning daily, at 1:1 5 today.
Orientation for new staffers,
and a general organizational
discussion will lake place in the
Daily office in the Storkc
Publications Building, on l/omita
Drive.

the only way to get Stanford to

ROTC" is to make sure that it
"knows no peace until Stanford
removes ROTC."

PRKSKNTATlON—Demonstrators deliver an 'injunction 1 against University land
development to I'.ncina I'.til
One hundred fifty
demonstrators marched to Encina
Hall yesterday and presented a
mock "injunction" to Vice
President for Business Alf
Brandon demanding a stop to the
construction of the Dillingham
project.
The "injunction" said the
University "has leased its vast
lands with primary regard for
profit and considerable disregard
for the needs of the People of the
area."
The march to Encina followed
a noon rally at White Plaza that
attracted a crowd of about 250.
At the rally, Paul Rupert, a leader
of the Grass Roots protest
organization, said that hindrance
of the building of the Dillingham
project would discourage future
investors who might damage

"They don't want to ris«\ ineir
money on a bad investment, and
we'll make it a bad investment,"
Rupert declared.
There were no incidents at
Encina Hall when 100 of the 150
marchers entered, presented
Brandon with the "injunction"
and entered the Planning Office.
There the protestors
ceremoniously placed copies of
the injunction on a large model of
the entire Stanford land
development.
Small toy houses were also
placed on the ROTC and
Aerospace buildings, symbolizing
the group's desire for Stanford to
devote more land to low cost
housing instead of buildings tiod
to the military-industrial complex.
Rally in City
At the rally Grass Roots
announced that they would
demonstrate at 1 p.m. today at

headquarters of the Dillingham
Corporation in San Francisco.
The group plans to smash a
model of the Dillingham project
and carry the pieces to the office
of the corporation, located on the
31st floor of the Wells Fargo Bank
building.
At Encina the protestors
symbolically read the
"injunction" on the steps of the
building, entered the lobby and
the Planning Office, and then left
after a few minutes. A few of the
group circulated throughout the
building distributing leaflets.
The "injunction" forbids
Stanford from leasing its lands
"without collective decision;"
from constructing the Dillingham
building and the Palo Alto Square;
from further developing the
Coyote Hill area; and from
"continued with-holding of the
large tracts of land suitable for
