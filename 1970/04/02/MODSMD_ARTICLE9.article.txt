## Violence At Stanford 
### F. H 
Yes, indeed, ladies and
gentlemen. Spring has come to a
great western university.
The sun is out. The lake is full.
There is talk in the air of love and
of riots. The sap is running all
over campus.
The first of the quarter is not
over yet, but we have already
witnessed a spectacle shameful
enough to disgust us for the whole
term.
Much has already been said in
condemnation of the violence of
March 31st. Mob action can never
be an acceptable mode of
expression at this university.
Anyone breaking windows and
threatening further destruction
simply will not bring about the
reforms he allegedly seeks. Such
action is mindless and asinine.
To my mind, the organizers of
Tuesday night's action and the
speakers at the Wednesday noon
rally are involved in two great
crimes. One was the wanton
destruction perpetrated on the
31st. The other was their wanton
misuse of the name of "The
People."
Stanford radicals love always
to talk about The People, whether
The People agree with them or
not. "If the majority is with
me democracy; if it is against
me conscience!"
I agree. Let's invoke The
People's authority.
The People of Stanford
University have, in many cases,
declared their emnity against the
overdevelopment of Stanford
land. The People have voiced
many reservations on the subject
of ROTC: they want to make sure
that the program is closely
scrutinized; they want-and this
often goes for the cadets
themselves'—to have the restrictive
and punitive clauses of the
military contracts changed.
This week, however, The
People—if the demonstrations'
leaders had been listening to
them were, in most cases, saying
something else as well.
People were saying that the
damage to the Business School
and the Aero and Astro Building
probably would amount to about
$5,000. People wondered whether
or not the money might better

have been used for scholarships,
staff salaries, or teaching
assistantships.
People looked at the
surrounding community, the real
world on the other side of El
Camino, and decided that the
senseless acts of the evening of
March 31st would alienate
potential supporters of peace and
the preservation of the
environment. We should work, it
was thought, to influence this
community. We should not
tolerate acts which only can
antagonize them.
People imagined what might be
the national repercussions of acts
of destruction on college
campuses. Every time a window is
broken, Lester Maddox can order
himself another case of Pickrick
Drumstick axe handles. Every
time a building is bombed,
Governor Reagan is ten thousand
votes closer to reelection. Every
time the name of a great
university is dragged through the
gutter by a mindless gang, higher
education in this country can
expect bigger budget deficits as
legislative or alumni support is
withdrawn.
The refusal of The People—real
people—to countenance mob
action is not mere quibbling over
tactics. The concern of the
captains of the mob is to organize
disruption and destruction. Few
of them care a damn for the
specific issues involved. They care
only, as the phrase has aptly been
turned, for Revolution for the
Hell of It.
If you heard the presentation
in White Plaza on April 1, you will
have seen this fact quite clearly.
The speakers made a heroic
attempt to yoke together all the
great issues—the war, smog,
military training, housing, and so
on. I can see their point, in a way.
Any of us who has ever ridden a
car in the Bay Area is ultimately
responsible for air pollution. Any
of us who pays Federal taxes is
ultimately financing the Defense
Department. And ultimately, war
and despoilment continue because
of the same reservoir of apathy
and shortsightedness.
This much of the wedding of

great issues I can buy. But no
rhetoric, no leap of the
imagination, can bring me to the
conclusion that this great nexus of
problems — problems of
destruction, problems of
violence —is a reason for further
destruction and further violence.
Violence is not any more
attractive at Stanford than it is in
Vietnam. Destruction is not any
more attractive at Stanford than it
is in a wilderness area.
That, if I read it aright, is the
opinion of The People.

land. The People have voiced
many reservations on the subject
of ROTC: they want to make sure
that the program is closely
scrutinized; they want-and this
often goes for the cadets
themselves'—to have the restrictive
and punitive clauses of the
military contracts changed.
This week, however, The
People—if the demonstrations'
leaders had been listening to
them were, in most cases, saying
something else as well.
People were saying that the
damage to the Business School
and the Aero and Astro Building
probably would amount to about
$5,000. People wondered whether
or not the money might better

have been used for scholarships,
staff salaries, or teaching
assistantships.
People looked at the
surrounding community, the real
world on the other side of El
Camino, and decided that the
senseless acts of the evening of
March 31st would alienate
potential supporters of peace and
the preservation of the
environment. We should work, it
was thought, to influence this
community. We should not
tolerate acts which only can
antagonize them.
People imagined what might be
the national repercussions of acts
of destruction on college
campuses. Every time a window is
broken, Lester Maddox can order
himself another case of Pickrick
Drumstick axe handles. Every
time a building is bombed,
Governor Reagan is ten thousand
votes closer to reelection. Every
time the name of a great
university is dragged through the
gutter by a mindless gang, higher
education in this country can
expect bigger budget deficits as
legislative or alumni support is
withdrawn.
The refusal of The People—real
people—to countenance mob
action is not mere quibbling over
tactics. The concern of the
captains of the mob is to organize
disruption and destruction. Few
of them care a damn for the
specific issues involved. They care
only, as the phrase has aptly been
turned, for Revolution for the
Hell of It.
If you heard the presentation
in White Plaza on April 1, you will
have seen this fact quite clearly.
The speakers made a heroic
attempt to yoke together all the
great issues—the war, smog,
military training, housing, and so
on. I can see their point, in a way.
Any of us who has ever ridden a
car in the Bay Area is ultimately
responsible for air pollution. Any
of us who pays Federal taxes is
ultimately financing the Defense
Department. And ultimately, war
and despoilment continue because
of the same reservoir of apathy
and shortsightedness.
This much of the wedding of

great issues I can buy. But no
rhetoric, no leap of the
imagination, can bring me to the
conclusion that this great nexus of
problems — problems of
destruction, problems of
violence —is a reason for further
destruction and further violence.
Violence is not any more
attractive at Stanford than it is in
Vietnam. Destruction is not any
more attractive at Stanford than it
is in a wilderness area.
That, if I read it aright, is the
opinion of The People.
Yes, indeed, ladies and
gentlemen. Spring has come to a
great western university.
The sun is out. The lake is full.
There is talk in the air of love and
of riots. The sap is running all
over campus.
The first of the quarter is not
over yet, but we have already
witnessed a spectacle shameful
enough to disgust us for the whole
term.
Much has already been said in
condemnation of the violence of
March 31st. Mob action can never
be an acceptable mode of
expression at this university.
Anyone breaking windows and
threatening further destruction
simply will not bring about the
reforms he allegedly seeks. Such
action is mindless and asinine.
To my mind, the organizers of
Tuesday night's action and the
speakers at the Wednesday noon
rally are involved in two great
crimes. One was the wanton
destruction perpetrated on the
31st. The other was their wanton
misuse of the name of "The
People."
Stanford radicals love always
to talk about The People, whether
The People agree with them or
not. "If the majority is with
me democracy; if it is against
me conscience!"
I agree. Let's invoke The
People's authority.
