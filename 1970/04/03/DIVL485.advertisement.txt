THE FINAL SOLUTION TO
PACIFIC STEREO'S
INVENTORY PROBLEM
This sale is an attempt to clear out as many compacts as possible. A compact is a component stereo music system in three
pieces instead of four. They're perfect for apartments and they're as easy to set up as you could want. The problem with selling
compacts is that for the same price as a compact you can usually assemble a system from separate components which is a better
value. If you're not strapped for space, and if you don't want the convenience, you won t buy a compact. During this sale we ve
cut the prices on compacts well below our usual discount price and below what you d have to spend for a component music
system of equivalent value. You can now get a compact's convenience and cabinetry and save on what you'd have to pay for
an equivalent component music system. But, please hurry, it's first come, first serve, and when they're gone, they're gone.
The compacts are all covered under Pacific Stereo's 5 year written guarantee which provides for absolutely free service for
2 years at any Pacific Stereo store.
