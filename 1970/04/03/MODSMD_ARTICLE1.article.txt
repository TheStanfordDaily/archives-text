# Lindsay Asks No New Frontiers For Violence'
## 
### 
"Our task is not to open up
new frontiers for violence, but to
stop it once and for all," New
York Mayor John Lindsay
declared yesterday in a speech
given both at Stanford and at
Berkeley.
Speaking before about 2300
people in Memorial Church
yesterday afternoon, Lindsay
emphasized his opposition to
violence of any type, and called
for patience in working out the
problems of the nation.
When Lindsay stated that
"violence and terror are cowardly
and immoral," whether they hurt
the Vietnamese or office workers
in New York, the crowd
applauded.
The mayor began his speech by
criticizing the Nixon
administration. "A 'moral
nperative' has been replaced by a
strategy of surrender to our most
aggressive impulses," he said.
Deep Polarization
Because of this shift in
emphasis, Lindsay sees the
polarization in the U.S. today as
deeper even than during the

violence of the summer of 1967.
He cited the conclusion of the
Kerner report, that America was
splitting into two separate and
unequal Americas.
"A subtle, ominous division
seems to be setting in now," he
said. "It seems that what no
enemy could do to us, we are
doing to ourselves."
Lindsay spoke about the
repressive measures being passed
by Congress, which were
increasingly removing peoples'
rights, and coming close to both
requiring I.D. cards and abolishing
freedom of assembly.
Signs of Progress
However, Lindsay said, there
were signs of progress, even
though it seemed to follow the
pattern of two steps back for
every three steps forward.
"We have begun to shatter the
myth of military infallibility," he
said, "and have succeeded in
putting the issue of war before the
people while it is being fought."
Lindsay also turned upon the
violence of the left, declaring that

"we must respond to human need,
but in a way that we don't tear
down every human liberty before
the institutions would do it, if left
alone."
A Delicate Balance
"We are at a delicate point of
balance, where we can make the
country go either way," he
concluded. "We can heal the
country, but only if we have the
patience to withstand the
setbacks."
Lindsay was introduced by
Provost Richard Lyman as a
"gallant champion of urban
America,"and was well-received
by the crowd that filled the
church.
During his visit to Stanford,
Lindsay also spoke before a closed
meeting of law students, and
attended a reception at Law
School Dean Bayless Manning's
house, where he met with
President Pitzer and conversed in
French with Marcel Marceau, the
famous pantomist who
performed in Memorial
Auditorium last night.

NO MORE VIOLENCE—New York Mayor John Lindsay asked his audience of
more than 2300 to shun violence which he regarded as "cowardly and
immoral."
"Our task is not to open up
new frontiers for violence, but to
stop it once and for all," New
York Mayor John Lindsay
declared yesterday in a speech
given both at Stanford and at
Berkeley.
Speaking before about 2300
people in Memorial Church
yesterday afternoon, Lindsay
emphasized his opposition to
violence of any type, and called
for patience in working out the
problems of the nation.
When Lindsay stated that
"violence and terror are cowardly
and immoral," whether they hurt
the Vietnamese or office workers
in New York, the crowd
applauded.
The mayor began his speech by
criticizing the Nixon
administration. "A 'moral
nperative' has been replaced by a
strategy of surrender to our most
aggressive impulses," he said.
Deep Polarization
Because of this shift in
emphasis, Lindsay sees the
polarization in the U.S. today as
deeper even than during the

violence of the summer of 1967.
He cited the conclusion of the
Kerner report, that America was
splitting into two separate and
unequal Americas.
"A subtle, ominous division
seems to be setting in now," he
said. "It seems that what no
enemy could do to us, we are
doing to ourselves."
Lindsay spoke about the
repressive measures being passed
by Congress, which were
increasingly removing peoples'
rights, and coming close to both
requiring I.D. cards and abolishing
freedom of assembly.
Signs of Progress
However, Lindsay said, there
were signs of progress, even
though it seemed to follow the
pattern of two steps back for
every three steps forward.
"We have begun to shatter the
myth of military infallibility," he
said, "and have succeeded in
putting the issue of war before the
people while it is being fought."
Lindsay also turned upon the
violence of the left, declaring that

"we must respond to human need,
but in a way that we don't tear
down every human liberty before
the institutions would do it, if left
alone."
A Delicate Balance
"We are at a delicate point of
balance, where we can make the
country go either way," he
concluded. "We can heal the
country, but only if we have the
patience to withstand the
setbacks."
Lindsay was introduced by
Provost Richard Lyman as a
"gallant champion of urban
America,"and was well-received
by the crowd that filled the
church.
During his visit to Stanford,
Lindsay also spoke before a closed
meeting of law students, and
attended a reception at Law
School Dean Bayless Manning's
house, where he met with
President Pitzer and conversed in
French with Marcel Marceau, the
famous pantomist who
