# The 						Brotherhood
## Frat Variety 
### Joe Virga 
Rccent articles in the Daily dealing with fraternities have come to
my attention. Every spring these same issues seem to arise and are
more often than not, given voice to the Stanford Daily. Year after
year the same misconceptions and misunderstandings hang over rush.
Confusion seems to be the word which most aptly describes the
situation.
I am writing in the hope of clearifying some of this confusion and
perhaps shedding some light on the situation.
The first point that needs clarification is that of the purpose and
meaning of fraternity life.
Fraternity Brotherhood
The fraternity is first and foremost a brotherhood. The members
have chosen to live and share with one another both their possessions
and their experiences. They have chosen to spend a large portion of
their lives here at Stanford together. Most of these men live with the
same people for three or more years and so it becomes very important
for them to have interests and desires in common. The feeling of
"brotherhood" and the desire to do things "together" are what most
typify fraternity life.
What emerges from this in rush is a very real desire and need on the
part of the fraternities to pledge men whom they feel will "fit-in."
That is to say, those freshmen who will best profit both the fraternity
and themselves by living with, and as a very important part of, the
fraternity brotherhood. No freshman is forced to rush and only very
rarely is any freshman who wants to join a fraternity turned down by
that fraternity. In fact, most freshmen receive numerous bids to join
fraternities.
The second point of misconception is that fraternity men lead a
very limited existence centered around only the frat and its problems.
On the contrary, fraternity men have even a wider range of interest
and activities than do most dorm dwellers. I might ask, what
percentage of any given dorm's members bother to go to house
meetings? Nearly 100% of a fraternity's membership is present at
house meetings.
Changing Life Style
I might also mention, that at these house meetings the members
have and often exercize the prerogative of changing their fraternity's
life style. So it can be concluded that no fraternity is so set in its ways
that it can not be changed by its membership.
Fraternity men are active in all campus functions as well as in
sports. The yearly work done by frats for the con home is just one
example, Lag Seca is another. Fraternity members are active in
campus groups ranging from the SDS to the YAF and KZSU. It is easy
for anyone who wants to know to ask a fraternity member what his
and his frat's interests are.
In summary, I would encourage freshmen men to give themselves
the choice of living in a fraternity by taking the time to come to open
houses and talk to the members. I believe there is a fraternity here on
campus for every interest and for every freshman. Judge fraternity life
for Yourself before you decide where you want to live next year. You
may be surprised.
