# Oink! Oink!
## Play War At Night 
### Jesse Cedarbaum 
Oink! Oink! Skree-Skree! Walk!
Run! Come-together!
Look-out-here-they-come! OFF
THE PIGS! PIGS OFF CAMPUS!
To-the-dorms! Back-to-ROTC!
You gotta admit, that's a hell of a
way to run an army.
Like Norman Mailer's Armies
of the Night, the People once
again stormed Stanford's own
mini-Pentagon Wednesday night,
only to retreat in utter confusion
andchaosaccording to true guerilla
tradition. Casualties for the night:
four demonstrators busted a few
windows, the same.
All in all, it was a nice night for
playing war - budding military
strategists were in all their glory,
maneuvering the übiquitous
affinity groups. The added
presence of an enemy in the
person of vigilante jocks and
helmeted blue meanies with
real-live guns and nightsticks
helped charge the atmosphere
with a super-Orwellian realism and
battle-frenzy.
Farenheit 451
A pig-filled bus came careening
down Escondido Rd., horn
blaring, sending the milling crowd
streaming into Crothers and Stern
courtyards. Visions of "Farenheit
451" and "Z" came floating
through the midnight sky as the
throng regrouped on the Wilbur
lawn to evaluate the night's
activities.
It was cold. And late. The tired
and the shivering split off to seek
the shelter of their beds. Curious
Wilburians and Sternites, roused
by the noise, ventured out,
swelling the slowly dwindling
crowtLShould we regroup now, or
wait for tomorrow morning? The
pigs seemed to be gone, ROTC, to
far away. The curtain rang down
on Round Two of the Battle of
ROTC.
What Accomplished?
And what was accomplished in
all the melee? The police again
exhibited their majestic prowess
at intimidation and their bravery

in combat, ganging up two and
three at a time on unarmed,
unprotected demonstrators, once
more demonstrating what a
supremely well-trained bunch of
public servants they are. But then
again, that's what happens any
time they show up where the
action is.
The demonstrators, on the
other hand, striking another blow
for the People against the mighty
Establishment, blew it again. It
takes a great deal of courage to
throw rocks at windows, a great
deal of conviction to run away
when the pigs stride forth, and a
great deal of maturity to do both.
Infantile Behavior
How can the People succeed in
eliminating ROTC from the
campus when they lack the
conviction to stand fast in the
face of confrontation, when they
try to fight the violence they
allegedly abhor with
rock-throwing and the boarding of
windows? A baby, when it cannot
get its way, picks up the nearest
object to heave at the source of its
frustration, only to cry and try to
squirm away when it is spanked in
punishment.
Must we lower ourselves to this
kind of infantile behavior to
accomplish our goals?
We fancy ourselves to be some
sort of young Davids that our
pebble-flinging will fell the mighty
pig Goliath armed with guns and
clubs and gas grenades? Who are
we trying to kid? Ourselves, most
likely.
The futility of fighting the
military monolith with sticks and
stones does convey a certain kind
of existentialist irony. But it is
also indicative of the weakness
exhibited by the People in their
struggle. The presence of ROTC
on campus serves as a reminder of
the violent militaristic element we
all say we are trying to rid our
society of. Yet we have proved
ourselves to be not a damn shot

better than the objectionable ones
we are trying to purge.
Above the Pigs
By lowering ourselves to the
level of violence, we defeat our
entire purpose. If the People
really want ROTC off campus,
they should show themselves to
be above the level of the common
pigs and military fascists. Instead
of running away and throwing
stones, ten People should stand
their ground when the police
approach, or plunk themselves on
their behinds and refuse to move,
and make the pigs do the work.
Running scared accomplishes
nothing, except to show that
those who say they're out to
change the world are nothing
more than a bunch of
bored-to-death kids out to have a
lark.

You gotta admit, that's a hell of a
way to run an army.
Like Norman Mailer's Armies
of the Night, the People once
again stormed Stanford's own
mini-Pentagon Wednesday night,
only to retreat in utter confusion
andchaosaccording to true guerilla
tradition. Casualties for the night:
four demonstrators busted a few
windows, the same.
All in all, it was a nice night for
playing war - budding military
strategists were in all their glory,
maneuvering the übiquitous
affinity groups. The added
presence of an enemy in the
person of vigilante jocks and
helmeted blue meanies with
real-live guns and nightsticks
helped charge the atmosphere
with a super-Orwellian realism and
battle-frenzy.
Farenheit 451
A pig-filled bus came careening
down Escondido Rd., horn
blaring, sending the milling crowd
streaming into Crothers and Stern
courtyards. Visions of "Farenheit
451" and "Z" came floating
through the midnight sky as the
throng regrouped on the Wilbur
lawn to evaluate the night's
activities.
It was cold. And late. The tired
and the shivering split off to seek
the shelter of their beds. Curious
Wilburians and Sternites, roused
by the noise, ventured out,
swelling the slowly dwindling
crowtLShould we regroup now, or
wait for tomorrow morning? The
pigs seemed to be gone, ROTC, to
far away. The curtain rang down
on Round Two of the Battle of
ROTC.
What Accomplished?
And what was accomplished in
all the melee? The police again
exhibited their majestic prowess
at intimidation and their bravery

in combat, ganging up two and
three at a time on unarmed,
unprotected demonstrators, once
more demonstrating what a
supremely well-trained bunch of
public servants they are. But then
again, that's what happens any
time they show up where the
action is.
The demonstrators, on the
other hand, striking another blow
for the People against the mighty
Establishment, blew it again. It
takes a great deal of courage to
throw rocks at windows, a great
deal of conviction to run away
when the pigs stride forth, and a
great deal of maturity to do both.
Infantile Behavior
How can the People succeed in
eliminating ROTC from the
campus when they lack the
conviction to stand fast in the
face of confrontation, when they
try to fight the violence they
allegedly abhor with
rock-throwing and the boarding of
windows? A baby, when it cannot
get its way, picks up the nearest
object to heave at the source of its
frustration, only to cry and try to
squirm away when it is spanked in
punishment.
Must we lower ourselves to this
kind of infantile behavior to
accomplish our goals?
We fancy ourselves to be some
sort of young Davids that our
pebble-flinging will fell the mighty
pig Goliath armed with guns and
clubs and gas grenades? Who are
we trying to kid? Ourselves, most
likely.
The futility of fighting the
military monolith with sticks and
stones does convey a certain kind
of existentialist irony. But it is
also indicative of the weakness
exhibited by the People in their
struggle. The presence of ROTC
on campus serves as a reminder of
the violent militaristic element we
all say we are trying to rid our
society of. Yet we have proved
ourselves to be not a damn shot

better than the objectionable ones
we are trying to purge.
Above the Pigs
By lowering ourselves to the
level of violence, we defeat our
entire purpose. If the People
really want ROTC off campus,
they should show themselves to
be above the level of the common
pigs and military fascists. Instead
of running away and throwing
stones, ten People should stand
their ground when the police
approach, or plunk themselves on
their behinds and refuse to move,
and make the pigs do the work.
Running scared accomplishes
nothing, except to show that
those who say they're out to
change the world are nothing
more than a bunch of
bored-to-death kids out to have a
lark.
