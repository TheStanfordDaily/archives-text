## Why Windows? 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom,
I can't understand the rash of
window smashing on campus. Do
the people perpetrating this
violence have anything in
common?
Confused Alumnus
Palo Alto Women's Club
Dear Confused,
Yes, there is one common
denominator - all the window
smashers have fathers in the glass
business. This bewildering fact is
being investigated by a new
faculty-student committee.
($5,000 of ASSU funds has been
allocated and they are meeting in
Dr. Seaver's windowless office in
History Corner.) A pamphlet
entitled "Does Glass Replacement
Industry Attract Stinking Commie
Types?" is being prepared by the
President's Special Committee on
Stinking Commie Types.
Women's Lib may be doing the
damage as a reaction to women's
window-washing role. (Where was
Your mother Tuesday and
Wednesday nights?)

Dear Mom,
How do you feel about the
voiding of the Insanity Test?

Dear Goo Goo,
University Admissions is a
tough enough job without
removing their mainstays for
admittance. Next, they won't
count S.A.T.'s!
Love,

Dear Mom,
To what do you attribute the
lack of interest in fraternities?
Fiji
Dear Fiji
Most people today are looking
for a small group of people with
similar interests around the same
age, and with a sense of belonging
or brotherhood. The fraternities
offer all this but no women. I
think the solution to this is
sororities for men. Then in after
years, children could proudly
boast, "My Daddy was a Kappa
Kappa Gamma."
Yours in the bonds,

a Kappa but my Daddy went to
Vassar." NEST ON THE BLOCK:
