# The 						ROTC Issue
## A 						Divided Campus 
### John Schwartz 
It is appropriate that Tom
Hayden should have spoken here
the night of the first Stanford
disruptions in that he symbolized
the twin escalation that
accompanies violent protest.
Chicago is the perfect example of
how police repression and ever
more militant protest can spark
each other in turn, escalating
finally into the student riots that
have spread across the nation one
one hand, and the repression of
the Chicago Eight trial on the
other.
What too few realize is that this
same tragic process of violent
escalation is now working at
Stanford. Radical meetings have
turned from discussions on ROTC
to tactical arguments over the best
way to damage the university;
similarly, every witness to
Tuesday and Wednesday night's
disturbances will know that police
were growing steadily less
disciplined and restrained.
This is essentially what radical
leaders want; they hope to open a
chasm between students and all
branches of the establishment, a
chasm that cannot be sealed, but
only widened through violence. In
this manner they hope to
strengthen their cause and
relatedly, to eliminate ROTC on
campus.

Just as in Vietnam, what is
clearly needed is not a hardening
of already intense conflict, but
rather unilateral de-escalation.
Progress will not be made by
choking off existing channels of
communication in rage; we must
open new ones through concern.
The tragic fact is that this view
has not been actively voiced by
the many who hold it. The
majority of Stanford students are
still buried in their books and
sweating over their GPA's. Any
majority that remains silent
deserves the catastrophies it
allows to occur.
What we must endeavor to do is
to reach our radical brothers and
sisters, asking them to help us
stop the continuing violence and
actively pursue peaceful means of
driving ROTC from our campus.
We must meet with them
individually as friends; we must
attend their open meetings to
co-operate in peacefully achieving
our mutual goals.
There are means to eliminate
ROTC and the defuse the
situation one which has already
raced too far towards explosion.
First, CUS, the group that is to
rule on credit for ROTC courses,
may well decide to grant none at
all for contractual reasons.
Affinity groups could be formed
to educate themselves on the issue
and meet with each member of
this council to present their views
in a concerned, non-threatening
manner. Second, if the Academic
Senate were to ban junior college
students from participating in
ROTC at Stanford, it wnnifi
cripple the program for sheer lack
of membership.
There were perhaps 300 people
that went out to attack the ROTC
building Wednesday night; that
number could divide itself into
fifty groups of 6, and concentrate
on convincing the ten key
decision-makers in CUS and the
forty in the Senate - hopefully
yielding more results than would
be produced by vandalizing the
entire campus.
It is time then, for the large
uninvolved group of students to
act - not armed with rocks or
fire-bombs as the radical
leadership might hope, but rather
with the weapons of love and
understanding to be directed both
toward our brothers and sisters
and toward the administration. If
we want peace, we must work for
it here, but certainly not by
helping to start a new war.
