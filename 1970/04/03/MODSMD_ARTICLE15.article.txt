## Rocks And Racism 
### 
Non-Returnable Rocks
Editor, THE D/MLY:
This message is directed to the
cowardly mob that left its calling
cards in various University
bui dings Tuesday night.
Unfortunately none of the rocks
bore a return address, so the
DAILY will have to serve as an
intermediary.
I don't know what your
performance was supposed to
prove. The newscasts usually
explain that you were protesting
against Monday's ROTC decision.
Unfortunately no one has
explained the relationship
between ROTC and windows in
the Business School or the
Bookstore. The DAILY hinted
that you were angry about police
being on campus. Strangely
enough, well over 10,000 students
and faculty managed to go about
their business without even feeling
oppressed.
Personally, the only quarrel I
have with the police is that they
allowed you to cause so much
destruction. You each probably
fell pretty powerful—hiding in the
middle of a mob in the dark
defying police who probably had
orders not to arrest anyone. And
you were even brave enough to
throw rocks—children seem to
love to break windows and you
had a wonderful chance to break
some with virtually no fear of
punishment. I bet vou really had a
ball.
It probably seems unkind of
me to begrudge you your
entertainment, but I do. The
sound of breaking windows may
please you; the sight of broken
windows merely angers me. A
shattered window cannot possibly
solve any problems: it just has to
be replaced. And that costs
money, part of which will be
mine. So don't look to me for any
support. I no longer care what
you say your motives are—l'll
oppose you because I dislike your
vandalism.

Indian Racism
Editor, THE DAILY :
Talk about racism on the
Stanford campus! I wish someone
would take a second look at the
emblem of the Stanford Indian. It
is an insult to every native
American.
If this university called its
teams "The Blacks," no one
would think of representing them
as cross-eyed, deformed

pickaninnies. The ca/icature of
the "Redskin" on your sweat
shirts or athletic posters degrades
and humiliates the Indian.
Isn't it time Stanford respect
the Indian, not mock him?

Editor, THE DAILY:
The newest manifestation of
radical activity seems to be a
mania for breaking windows. It
might be valuable to explore the
symbolic implications of this
peculiar behavior: Buildings,
because of their shape and
womblike aspects, are classically
considered female genital
symbols. Windows, because of
their fragility and the ease with
which they rupture, are often
regarded as virginal entrances. By
thrusting stones (extensions of
male genitalia) through the
windows at night, one is
symbolically raping the building.
Therefore, it seems that these
particular radicals are
Motherf...ers.
One should also investigate the
progression of radical rape on
campus. Demonstrators used to
occupy buildings peaceably and
legitimately (Old Union, 1968).
They turned to entering these
womblike structures forcibly
(Encina, 1969). Now through
further impotence (1970), they
merely try to enter these
structures from a distance.
As the movement gets less and
less potent, one wonders what the
next logical step in this
progression is. It would seem
symbolically appropriate if these
radicals soon begin cutting down
telephone poles and lamp posts,
and make attempts on Hoover
Tower.

considered female genital
symbols. Windows, because of
their fragility and the ease with
which they rupture, are often
regarded as virginal entrances. By
thrusting stones (extensions of
male genitalia) through the
windows at night, one is
symbolically raping the building.
Therefore, it seems that these
particular radicals are
Motherf...ers.
One should also investigate the
progression of radical rape on
campus. Demonstrators used to
occupy buildings peaceably and
legitimately (Old Union, 1968).
They turned to entering these
womblike structures forcibly
(Encina, 1969). Now through
further impotence (1970), they
merely try to enter these
structures from a distance.
As the movement gets less and
less potent, one wonders what the
next logical step in this
progression is. It would seem
symbolically appropriate if these
radicals soon begin cutting down
telephone poles and lamp posts,
and make attempts on Hoover
Tower.

This message is directed to the
cowardly mob that left its calling
cards in various University
bui dings Tuesday night.
Unfortunately none of the rocks
bore a return address, so the
DAILY will have to serve as an
intermediary.
I don't know what your
performance was supposed to
prove. The newscasts usually
explain that you were protesting
against Monday's ROTC decision.
Unfortunately no one has
explained the relationship
between ROTC and windows in
the Business School or the
Bookstore. The DAILY hinted
that you were angry about police
being on campus. Strangely
enough, well over 10,000 students
and faculty managed to go about
their business without even feeling
oppressed.
Personally, the only quarrel I
have with the police is that they
allowed you to cause so much
destruction. You each probably
fell pretty powerful—hiding in the
middle of a mob in the dark
defying police who probably had
orders not to arrest anyone. And
you were even brave enough to
throw rocks—children seem to
love to break windows and you
had a wonderful chance to break
some with virtually no fear of
punishment. I bet vou really had a
ball.
It probably seems unkind of
me to begrudge you your
entertainment, but I do. The
sound of breaking windows may
please you; the sight of broken
windows merely angers me. A
shattered window cannot possibly
solve any problems: it just has to
be replaced. And that costs
money, part of which will be
mine. So don't look to me for any
support. I no longer care what
you say your motives are—l'll
oppose you because I dislike your
vandalism.

Indian Racism
Editor, THE DAILY :
Talk about racism on the
Stanford campus! I wish someone
would take a second look at the
emblem of the Stanford Indian. It
is an insult to every native
American.
If this university called its
teams "The Blacks," no one
would think of representing them
as cross-eyed, deformed

pickaninnies. The ca/icature of
the "Redskin" on your sweat
shirts or athletic posters degrades
and humiliates the Indian.
Isn't it time Stanford respect
the Indian, not mock him?
