# Springtime
## Ecology And Things 
### Lee Herzenberg 
Spring is here again. The hills
are green, even Coyote Hill in the
places where the bull dozers and
the asphalt layers haven't cut it
up. Apricot trees, what few of
them are left in the orchards not
yet converted to housing tracts,
are opening delicate white
blossoms in a call to renewal.
Spring is here again on campus,
too. Sitting on the patio of the
Union, basking in the sunshine,
it's almost possible to forget that
bombers are wiping out acres of
the Vietnam countryside, that
Laos and Cambodia are about to
be leveled, that the garbage in San
Francisco Bay has crowded out
the fish and shellfish that used to
live -here, that people who work
and study at Stanford can't afford
to live within a ten mile radius,
that Stanford continues to
convert its land into industry that
feeds the war machine and
overcrowds the area.
It's almost possible to forget,
but not quite. Not quite because
even though you find a pleasant
place in the sunshine, the
environment is a total thing. The
smog is there and you can't help
breathing it. A friend passes
whose number is low. A bird
pecks at a plastic cup.
Not quite because you're
sitting on a patio of the Stanford
Union, and this week Stanford has
brought back ROTC to campus.
Not quite because last week
Stanford signed a contract with
the Dillingham Corporation,
builder in Vietnam and Thailand,
to bring high rise office

congestion to the corner of Page
Mill and El Camino. Not quite
because Stanford has carved up a
beautiful hillside to grow
industrial plants instead of trees.
Spring Returns
So Spring comes again, and
almost on the anniversary of the
April 3rd Movement, when the
campus moved to say no to the
research destructive of human life,
students are in the streets,
chanting "'Off ROTC," demanding
that the University do away with
a program designed to educate
men to kill other men.
President Pitzer chose the
issue. Not content with the
decision of his faculty last year to
do away with credit for a program
of dubious academic value, he
reopened the question this winter,
making no bones nbout the kind
of pressures from the Defense
Department and friends of the
Defense Department to which he
was yielding.
The Faculty Senate, less
mindful of the need to respect the
decision of its constituency than
the need to accomodate to the
new pressure, responded favorably
to the request of the President.
Finally the faculty, perhaps
reflecting the schizophrenia of
attempting to run a sane
University in the middle of a
topsy-turvy world, split itself right
down the middle, advising the
President by seventeen votes to
keep the program, but really
advising him (if he is listening)
that they are undecided, that they
don't wish to choose between
keeping ROTC or losing Defense
Department support.
Failure
Now that students are on the
streets, protesting the "decision"
to keep ROTC, the usual
discussions of violence and law
and order will appear. The 373
faculty members, excepting
perhaps a few who voted against
ROTC, will say "I agree with your

aims but not with your methods."
The others will say, "I don't want
my vote negated by mob action."
And the students will answer
that you had your chance to do
something to set the world right
and you failed. With all your
Nobel prizes and your
distinguished honors, your leading
scholarship and your grey hairs,
you couldn't move to get the war
out of your own back yard.
Which brings us back to Spring,
and the grass and the trees.
Because the issue isn't just ROTC.
The issue is what Stanford is
doing to mess up the world, how
Stanford is helping to foul the nest
from which there is no place to
go.
The issue is nothing short of
the total environment in which we
live, an environment which cannot
admit war and killing, nor smog,
pollution and hunger.
The move to rid the campus of
ROTC is but one arm of a
movement to make the world a fit
place for human habitation. It
moves with a body which says
that all exploitation of people, all
destruction of the environment,
all destruction of mankind must
stop. And it moves with a heart
and mind which says that a world
can and will be built where people
cooperate with one another, and
where a child can grow up with
love.
