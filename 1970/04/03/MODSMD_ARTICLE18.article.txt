## Biocides: Silent Spring 
### Barry Wood 
Silenl Spring was published in
1962 and it brought its author
many bitter attacks. Rachel
Carson was accused of trying to
frighten people and the pesticide
industry did all it could to
discredit her findings. But now
Frank Graham has brought out
Since Silenl Spring which records
the deceits and lies still used by an
entrenched pesticide industry.
Within the last year we have
had encouraging bans on DDT in
this country. This, of course, was
only allowed after DDT had lost
its importance as a pesticide. As if
to vindicate Darwin, pests
subjected to DDT poisoning have
been taking just about 3 years to
evolve a new superpest strain
which is resistant. New and more
powerful killers become
necessary, and soon appear. There
are now well over 100 pests
resistant to DDT and some dozens
which have led us a merry chase
through progressively stronger
chemicals—BHC, lindane,
toxaphene, dieldrin, aldrin.
The reason for concern over
"pesticides" boils down to the
fact that they are really
"biocides." Sprayed over crops
and orchards, forests and, yes,
suburbs, these lethal chemicals
sink into the ground, are taken up
into our grains, permeate our
carrots and applies, and become
ever more concentrated as grass
eaten by cows is served up as
butter and milk. The brown
pelican is dying out because its
eggs, the shells weakened by
concentrated pesticides, are

collapsing almost as soon as laid.
Thousands of birds have died at
Tule Lake, Lower Klamath, and
Clear Lake in California from
pesticides. DDT has been found in
every living species examined.
Human milk is now too high in
DDT content to be transported
across state lines!
The amounts of pesticides used
in this country alone are truly
staggering—7 million pounds of
parathion annually, for example.
Parathion used in California alone
constitutes a lethal dose for 5 to
10 times the world's population.
And where does it all go? It sinks
into the soil where it lingers for
years; it filters to the water table
where it begins a slow course
toward the sea. Deep wells draw
contaminated water;
fish-spawning rivers flow with it;
it spreads to the ocean and resides
in the flesh of salmon and herring.
No Kscape?
Pesticides have now cornered
us with one of those dilemmas
from which there seems no
escape. Since we have disrupted
whole ecosystems, killing pest and
predator alike, a halt might spell
disaster. This, however, seems to
be a minor problem beside the
vested interests of the pesticide
industry, which has made
repeated claims that our
agricultural success depends on
their use. Actually, most of our
increased farm efficiency dates
back to the pro-pesticide advances
in soil culture and fertilizers in the
1930'5. This industry has also
pointed to the lack of hard facts
about pesticide effects on
humans. Some have said that it is
unwarranted to ban poisons about
which too little is known, from
which we conclude that the less
known about a poison the freer
we should feel in using it.
At its roots the problem of
pesticides is not an agricultural
one at all, but a problem of
attitudes and philosophy. For
hundreds of years we have been
saddled with the myth that "man
is higher than the beasts," a myth
which Christianity has tacitly
supported. Accordingly, nature is
brute and material— intractible
sludge lo be bulldozed and beaten
into submission. Whatever is not
for us is against us. Anything
standing in our way must be
trampled; anything that bites

must be exterminated. If it's
worth money, stake a claim. The
so-called "pests" are just like the
bison and buffalo, passenger
pigeons, mountain lions, and
California redwoods: as part of
nature, they don't matter.
Population Central
The other component of the
problem—the central one for
survival—is population. There are
too many people, 3 million more
American mouths every year.
Every morning 10,000 more
Americans report for work. We
are under more and more pressure
to feed people—not only our own
but a world population growing at
100 million per year. This means
more food from limited land.
And, because of urban sprawl and
highway construction, this means
some millions of acres less yearly,
most of it from the best growing
belts of the country. Under the
illusion that people can, will, and
ought to reproduce, we
desperately fertilize the land, then
spray the pests (and the fertilizer),
in a race to stave off hunger a
little longer by producing more
tons and bushels per acre.
If I were a pessimist, I would
be tempted to say we probably
won't put a stop to the
indiscriminant use of pesticides
until we start to sicken and fall in
our own poison. According to
some this is already happening,
but clear cut evidence is difficult
to obtain. At the moment,
however, we are headed towards
an infinitely expanding
agricultural business to support
infinite people, deluding ourselves
with the dream of farming the
oceans. This will be a nice
smorgasbord indeed—ocean fresh
fish and bird, nourished on
untreated sewage, laced with
Santa Barbara oil, spiced with
pesticides.
