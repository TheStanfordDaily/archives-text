# 800 March For Third Night In Peaceful ROTC Protest
## 
### 
In a third night of anti-ROTC
demonstrations, hundreds of
marchers surged across campus, in
a peaceful protest.
Estimates of the crowd ranged
from 700 to the official police
estimate of 1700. A Daily count
revealed a peak attendance of
800.
There was no violence, and no
arrests. Santa Clara County
Sherriff's deputies remained on
alert, but were not called .it to
confront the marchers.
The march, which included
stops at the ROTC building and
President Kenneth Pitzer's home,
climaxed a ninety-minute tactical
debate on the steps of Cubberly.
In addition to preparing last
night's activities, the group made
plans for the formation of
"affinity groups" this afternoon.
When the meeting was called to
order at 9:20 p.m., about 250
people had gathered on the
Cubberly steps.
Following some preliminary
announcements, the debate
opened with a questioning of
KZSU's broadcasting of the
meeting. Despite an early motion

to permit broadcasting, the
radiomen were later asked to
disconnect their microphones as
chairwoman Amy Lewis opened
the floor to individual speakers.
Croups Stressed
Always stressing the
importance of building a
movement, speakers suggested
sit-ins, "affinity groups," marches
on the ROTC building, and
marches to Memorial Church,
where another program was
underway.
The "affinity groups" received
the most attention, as a means of
discouraging infiltration as well as
attrition by direct police assault.
A peaceful march was
proposed as a tactic to increase
student support. Through
discussion, a motion emerged
outlining a march past the ROTC
building, the Graduate School of
Business, and "other places,
including Pitzer's house."
Meeting Called
It further called for a meeting
this afternoon on "Agitators'
Grass" in White Plaza for the
formation of "affinity groups," as
bases for future activities.

By the time this final vote was
taken, the crowd had swelled to
over 350 people. The motion
passed almost unanimously at
10:45 and the march began
immediately. .
The demonstrators moved past
the' Undergraduate Library and
into Escondido Street, changing,
"Off ROTC, Join Us."
As the crowd moved down the
street, many students emerged
from Toyon, Branner, Wilbur, and
Stern to do just that. The march,
now grown to over 700 persons,
spilled into the Wilbur parking lot,
heading for Campus Drive.
Stopping traffic on the drive,
the demonstrators moved past the
Row and Florence Moore,
receiving stares but little support.
Turning down Lomita, they
swept past the Aerospace
building, scene of Tuesday night's
violence, and into the Quad.
Moves Through Quad
The crowd moved through the
center of the Quad, stretching
almost the entire length of the
inner area. It passed the
President's office, but did not
stop.
Students then moved past the
History Corner, across Serra
Street and past the Graduate
School of Business.
The crowd, having slowed in
order to close ranks, turned onto
Memorial Way in back of the
Business School and about a block
in front of the ROTC building,
filling the street and sidewalks.
As the march moved toward
the building, groups of students
opposed to the demonstration
were assuming positions around
the area. About 20 members of
the Free Campus Movement
(FCM) were included.
Harvey Hukari Jr., leader of
the FCM, said "we were prepared
to take photographs of any illegal
actions during the
demonstrations" and "of any rock
throwing that took place."
Police Absent
The crowd arrived at the
ROTC headquarters at about
11:30 p.m. No uniformed police
were at the scene when they
arrived nor at any other time
during the evening.
There was some brief

discussion concerning the
marchers' plans for the rest of the
evening. Only one of two
photographs were taken by FCM
members at the building, and
there were no confrontations with
demonstrators.
After a quiet stay of about 12
minutes, the group decided to
continue the march up to Pitzer's
house. It moved up Galvez Street,
encouraging students to "join us"
as they passed Crothers and Stern
Halls.
As the group turned left onto
Alvarado Row and across Campus
Drive, students chanted a
countdown to midnight and
cheered at the start of April 3, the
anniversary of the start of last
year's April 3rd Movement.
Arrive At House
The march then moved about
two blocks to Santa Ynez Street,
where it turned right and headed
toward Pitzer's house, three
blocks ahead. Students continued
anti-ROTC and "join us" chants
as they passed fraternity and Row
houses.
The crowd, now numbering
about 300, arrived at Pitzer's

residence, at 623 Mirada Avenue,
about 12:10 a.m. Students moved
up the sloping lawn to the house
and poured onto a large patio
area.
A few ascended stairs to an
uDDer balconv to trv. without
success, to find the President. The
University News Service reported
that Dr. and Mrs. Pitzer were in
the house at the time, but stayed
out of sight.
A Daily phone call to the
Pitzers' house was answered by
Bob Carlson, an assistant to the
President.
Crowd Disperses
During the demonstrators' stay
at the house, chants against
ROTC, Pitzer and Stanford
activities in Asia continued, while
a student stood on a balcony and
imitated Pitzer.
The crowd began to break up
about 12:20, after the singing of

"Mickey Mouse," "Solidarity
Forever" and "Happy Birthday"
to April 3rd. A string of
firecrackers was set off, but by
12:30 all but two persons had
left.
Leaders called for a 1 p.m.
meeting today in White Plaza,
followed by a move on the
Academic Council meeting at
4:15 in the Physics Tank.
