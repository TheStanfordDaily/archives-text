# Radicals Attend ROTC Class Learn About Military Justice
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Major C. Darrell Kirkland's
military science course has gained
sudden and unexpected
popularity.
More than fifty eager
"Off-ROTC" activists showed up
for Kirkland's Command and
Staff class at 11 a.m. yesterday
morning, and hoped in the words
of Art Busse, "to turn that
classroom into our own
classroom."
The students were in high
spirits as they filed up the steps to
the room in the Athletic Building.
There they were greeted by
University Security Manager
Bruce Wiggins, who warned the
crowd that they were not to enter
the classroom until all the
students already registered for the
class were seated.
Standing in the open doorway,
his arm blocking the entrance,
Wiggins refused to allow the
overflow crowd to enter the
forty-seat classroom. However, he
was at a loss to do anything when
Busse announced that any

University student had a right to
take the course, and then
promptly led the crowd into the
room.
The crowd filled the classroom
to capacity, with many of the
regularly registered students
having to stand in the back or
wait in the hall.
Vict Cong Weapons
A poster of Viet Cong weapons
that was lying on the floor was
tacked high on the back wall, to
the cheers of the group.
As more students jammed into
the doorways, a tight-lipped Major
Kirkland entered the room and
the major calmly asked all those
who were not seated to leave. The
anti-ROTC students promptly
doubled and tripled up on the
seats, with many others sitting on
the desks, heaters and window
sills. The regular ROTC students
filled the remaining seats.
"One student per seat,"
Kirkland announced, growing
slightly impatient. "I am asking all
those not now in a seat to please
leave the classroom," he said.

When his request fell on deaf
ears, the Major proceeded to read
the University Disruptions policy.
The policy declares it a violation
for a member of the faculty, staff,
or student body to "prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or
approved activity, such as
lectures, etc.
"Members of the faculty, staff
or student body," the policy
further states, "have an obligation
to leave a University building or
facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above
regulations by a member of the
University community acting in
an official role."
"What's your name rank and
serial number?" an activist called
out defiantly as Kirkland was
finishing the statement of policy.
Ignoring that and other insults,
the Major declared, "If you do
not leave at this time I consider it
a disruption."
Fire Ordinance
Asked why they were in
violation of the disruptions
policy, he replied that the
crowded conditions of the room
constituted a violation of fire
ordinances.
Soon students without seats
walked out, leaving those
remaining in the class to view a
film on the Uniform Code of
Military Justice. The first scene
consisted of a police car driving
down a road and a voice
reminding the students that "We
all must obev the rule of law."

AUDITORS GALOREâ€”About 25 students protesting the presence of on-campus ROTC audited Maj. C. Darrell kirkland's
military justice class yesterday. Another twenty were turned away for lack of seating. After class, the auditors filed out
chanting "Off ROTC, Off ROTC." There was no violence.
