# Charged With Assault
## Suspects Out On Bail 
### 
The four persons arrested in
Wednesday nights campus
demonstrations were released on
bail yesterday after being held
overnight at the North Santa Clara
County jail in Palo Alto.
The four, three of them
Stanford students, were charged
with assault with a deadly weapon
following the protest march on
the Army ROTC building and
skirmishes with police Wednesday
night.
Those arrested were: Charles
Woodbridge Noble, 22, a
non-student who lives in Palo
Alto; David Arthur Smothers, 18,
a freshman; Lewis Jordan Soffer,
20, a junior political science major
who was erroneously reported as a
non-student in yesterday's
DAILY; and Brooks Birdwell
Yeager, 20, a junior philosophy
major.
Assault Charges
According to Santa Clara
County Sheriff Charles J. Prelsnik,
three of those arrested were
charged with two counts each of
assault with a deadly weapon.
Soffer was charged with one
county of assault with a deadly
weapon and one count of assault
on a police officer, Prelsnik said.
Assault with a deadly weapon is a
felony and is punishable by up to
ten years in prison and a $5000
fine.
All were released on bail
yesterday. Prelsnik said that the
three students were released on
$1500 bail, and bail for Nobel was
set at $1 000.
Prelsnik estimated that
between 40 and 50 Santa Clara
County police officers were
present at the Wednesday night
demonstrations. He also said that
some county officers and San Jose
police in plainclothes were
present, although he did not know
how many. Some of the four
arrests were made by
plainclothesmen.
Bus Incident
When asked if the police bus
which had reportedly sped

through a crowd ot demonstrators
was used intentionally to disperse
the group, Prelsnik said, "This is
absolutely untrue."
"If they did it they'd be in
very serious trouble with me," he
added. Prelsnik indicated that
after the bus had unloaded, the
demonstrators began throwing
rocks and broke a window of the
bus, and the driver sped the bus
up to get away from the crowd.
Prelsnik said that "a couple" of
officers were hit by rocks thrown
by the demonstraotrs, though
apparently not at the same time as
the bus incident. One officer had
the plastic protective helmet he
wore broken by a rock, and
Prelsnik said yesterday that "a
couple were knocked dizzy"
although he had no yet heard if
they had required medical care.
One Injury
Cowell Health Center reported

yesterday that one male student
was confined to the infirmary
with head injuries, although the
center would not release his name
or the extent of his injuries.
Chris Hocker, business manager
of the Free Campus Movement
(FCM) objected yesterday to an
article in yesterday's DAILY
reporting that right-wing
counter-demonstrators protested
against the anti-ROTC
demonstrators. "Those people
who were there . . . had no real
political consciousness and to call
them right-wingers is inaccurate,"
Hocker said.
"Last night there was no
member of the FCM anywhere
near the ROTC building," Hocker
said. He said that there were
about 15 or 20 FCM members
who were observing the
demonstrations from a distance.

set at $1 000.
Prelsnik estimated that
between 40 and 50 Santa Clara
County police officers were
present at the Wednesday night
demonstrations. He also said that
some county officers and San Jose
police in plainclothes were
present, although he did not know
how many. Some of the four
arrests were made by
plainclothesmen.
Bus Incident
When asked if the police bus
which had reportedly sped

through a crowd ot demonstrators
was used intentionally to disperse
the group, Prelsnik said, "This is
absolutely untrue."
"If they did it they'd be in
very serious trouble with me," he
added. Prelsnik indicated that
after the bus had unloaded, the
demonstrators began throwing
rocks and broke a window of the
bus, and the driver sped the bus
up to get away from the crowd.
Prelsnik said that "a couple" of
officers were hit by rocks thrown
by the demonstraotrs, though
apparently not at the same time as
the bus incident. One officer had
the plastic protective helmet he
wore broken by a rock, and
Prelsnik said yesterday that "a
couple were knocked dizzy"
although he had no yet heard if
they had required medical care.
One Injury
Cowell Health Center reported

yesterday that one male student
was confined to the infirmary
with head injuries, although the
center would not release his name
or the extent of his injuries.
Chris Hocker, business manager
of the Free Campus Movement
(FCM) objected yesterday to an
article in yesterday's DAILY
reporting that right-wing
counter-demonstrators protested
against the anti-ROTC
demonstrators. "Those people
who were there . . . had no real
political consciousness and to call
them right-wingers is inaccurate,"
Hocker said.
"Last night there was no
member of the FCM anywhere
near the ROTC building," Hocker
said. He said that there were
about 15 or 20 FCM members
who were observing the
demonstrations from a distance.
The four persons arrested in
Wednesday nights campus
demonstrations were released on
bail yesterday after being held
overnight at the North Santa Clara
County jail in Palo Alto.
The four, three of them
Stanford students, were charged
with assault with a deadly weapon
following the protest march on
the Army ROTC building and
skirmishes with police Wednesday
night.
Those arrested were: Charles
Woodbridge Noble, 22, a
non-student who lives in Palo
Alto; David Arthur Smothers, 18,
a freshman; Lewis Jordan Soffer,
20, a junior political science major
who was erroneously reported as a
non-student in yesterday's
DAILY; and Brooks Birdwell
Yeager, 20, a junior philosophy
major.
Assault Charges
According to Santa Clara
County Sheriff Charles J. Prelsnik,
three of those arrested were
charged with two counts each of
assault with a deadly weapon.
Soffer was charged with one
county of assault with a deadly
weapon and one count of assault
on a police officer, Prelsnik said.
Assault with a deadly weapon is a
felony and is punishable by up to
ten years in prison and a $5000
fine.
All were released on bail
yesterday. Prelsnik said that the
three students were released on
$1500 bail, and bail for Nobel was
set at $1 000.
