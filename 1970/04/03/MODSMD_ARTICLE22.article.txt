A scheduled Grass Roots
demonstration against the
Dillingham Corp. failed to
materialize early yesterday
afternoon.
One Grass Roots spokesman,
who asked not to be identified,
said the protest was cancelled
"because of the ROTC conflict."
Grass Roots announced earlier
this week that it planned to smash
a replica of the Dillingham office
building-hotel complex, slated to
be built on Stanford lands, in the
Dillingham corporate offices on
the 31st floor of the Wells Fargo
Bank building.
Six policemen were on hand
shortly before noon, when the
demonstration was supposed to
start.
The police left the area at 1
p.m. when the demonstrators
failed to show up.
A crowd of some 200
onlookers stood by, staring at the
policemen and the photographers.
Like the policemen, they lost
interest after an hour of fruitless
waiting.
