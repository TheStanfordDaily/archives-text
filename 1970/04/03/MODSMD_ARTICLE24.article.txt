## Postal Pay Raise 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
nation's postmen got their pay
raise and pulled all other Civil
Service employes and military
men up with them in a landmark
agreement that for the first time
provides collective bargaining
rights for government workers.
The argreement, reached
Thursday but still subject to
congressional approval, was
scheduled for formal presentation
to Capitol Hill today in the form
of presidential messages.
As worked out in talks that
opened March 25, the pact
provides a 14 percent, two-step
pay raise for postal workers that
breaks down this way:
A 6 percent increase for Post
Office employes-and with them,
more than 2 million other
government workers and 3 million
in the military services retroactive
to Dec. 27.
Another 8 percent for the
postal workers who wrought the
agreement in the wake of their
first-ever strike last month, and
collective bargaining rights if the
Post Office Department is
reorganized.
The cost was estimated at $1.2
billion the first six months of this
year and $2.5 billion in fiscal
1971.
Sick-Out Ends
WASHINGTON (AP) — Leaders
of air traffic controllers agreed in
federal court Thursday to order
their men to end a sick-call
walkout, but the Federal Aviation
Administration confirmed that
dismissal proceedings had been
initiated against three controllers
whose transfers had sparked the
work stoppage.
An FAA spokesman confirmed
Thursday night that letters of
proposed removal had been send
to controllers Shelby McCurnin,
James R. Sparks and James A.
Henson at Baton Rouge, La.
Such letters are the first step in
dismissal proceedings under the
civil service system. The men have
30 days to respond to the letters
and after that face the usual civil
service procedures.
The FAA said the three were
accused of failure to report to
new duty stations. They had been
ordered to new posts effective last
Monday, the FAA said, but each
reported he was too ill to travel.
Cambodia Meutral
(AP) — The Cambodian
government declared Thursday it
would never consent to U.S. or
South Vietnamese forces persuing
the North Vietnamese or Viet
Cong into Cambodia.
This policy was enunciated
despite the government's report
that 40,000 North Vietnamese
and 16,000 Viet Cong in
Cambodia border sanctuaries pose
a threat to the new regime.
Fulbright Speaks
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. J.W.
Fulbright says the United States
should accept North Vietnam's
domination of Indochina as a
political fact of life that poses no
threat to American security.
"North Vietnam is far too small
a power to have any serious hope
to conquering all of Southeast
Asia, much less of posing any kind
of a threat to the United States,"
the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee said
Thursday.
His Senate speech came during
a new round of discussions on
U.S. policy toward Vietnam, Laos

and Cambodia. Senators of both
parties began throwing their
support behind a French proposal
for an all-Indochinese conference
to neutralize the three countries.
Welfare Fails
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
welfare systems of 40 states failed
to meet federal standards
completely, the Department of
Welfare disclosed Thursday.
Some of the apparent violations
involved relatively minor
bureaucratic provisions that little
affect directly the nation's 10
million welfare receipients.
Others cut to the heart of
compliance with congressional
provisions and Supreme Court
decisions as long as three years
ago enlarging the rights of persons
receiving public assistance.
Compliance deadlines are past in
all cases.

some of the other shenanigans
that are going on we'd save more

WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. J.W.
Fulbright says the United States

"North Vietnam is far too small
a power to have any serious hope

the chairman of the Senate

Thursday.

Welfare Fails
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
welfare systems of 40 states failed
to meet federal standards
completely, the Department of
Welfare disclosed Thursday.
Some of the apparent violations
involved relatively minor
bureaucratic provisions that little
affect directly the nation's 10
million welfare receipients.
Others cut to the heart of
compliance with congressional
provisions and Supreme Court
decisions as long as three years
ago enlarging the rights of persons
receiving public assistance.
Compliance deadlines are past in
all cases.
S tilings
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice
Adm. Hyman Rickover told a
Senate subcommittee Thursday a
minimum of $2 billion a year
could be trimmed from defense
procurement costs by imposing
standard accounting rules for huge
defense contractors.
"And I think if we got into
some of the other shenanigans
that are going on we'd save more
than that," he told a Senate
Banking subcommittee.
Rickover is in charge of the
Navy's nuclear-propulsion
division.
Speaking scornfully of giant
corporations which he said want
to "maximize their profits and
socialize their losses."
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
nation's postmen got their pay
raise and pulled all other Civil
Service employes and military
men up with them in a landmark
agreement that for the first time
provides collective bargaining
rights for government workers.
The argreement, reached
Thursday but still subject to
congressional approval, was
scheduled for formal presentation
to Capitol Hill today in the form
of presidential messages.
As worked out in talks that
opened March 25, the pact
provides a 14 percent, two-step
pay raise for postal workers that
breaks down this way:
A 6 percent increase for Post
Office employes-and with them,
more than 2 million other
government workers and 3 million
in the military services retroactive
to Dec. 27.
Another 8 percent for the
postal workers who wrought the
agreement in the wake of their
first-ever strike last month, and
collective bargaining rights if the
Post Office Department is
reorganized.
The cost was estimated at $1.2
billion the first six months of this
year and $2.5 billion in fiscal
1971.
Sick-Out Ends
WASHINGTON (AP) — Leaders
of air traffic controllers agreed in
federal court Thursday to order
their men to end a sick-call
walkout, but the Federal Aviation
Administration confirmed that
dismissal proceedings had been
initiated against three controllers
whose transfers had sparked the
work stoppage.
An FAA spokesman confirmed
Thursday night that letters of
proposed removal had been send
to controllers Shelby McCurnin,
James R. Sparks and James A.
Henson at Baton Rouge, La.
Such letters are the first step in
dismissal proceedings under the
civil service system. The men have
30 days to respond to the letters
and after that face the usual civil
service procedures.
The FAA said the three were
accused of failure to report to
new duty stations. They had been
ordered to new posts effective last
Monday, the FAA said, but each
reported he was too ill to travel.
