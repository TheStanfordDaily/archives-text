April 3, 1970.
Today is an anniversary filled with memories
but void of celebration.
It is a day for recalling lost hopes, abandoned
tactics, and a fleeting moment when Stanford was
a community committed to a nonviolent
movement for peace and life.
A year ago people cared. They jammed
Dinkelspiel Auditorium to denounce war and
war-related research. They were joined by
hundreds, more when they first occupied the
Applied Electronics Lab (ALL).
A year ago no windows had been smashed and
the spectre of police on campus seemed remote.
And if the police ever came, it was assumed all hell
would break loose.
This April police come every night. White Pla/a,
Quad, Meyer Library lawns they echo with the
crack of shattering glass and the crackle of police
radios.
At noon the campus sparkles in the luxuriant
spring sun. Thousands of students attend to their
academic and leisure lives. All hell does not break
loose. The clashes of the night are like a play
without an audience.
The message is clear: the politics of concern are
embraced at Stanford. The politics of
confrontation arc accepted. The politics of rage
are ignored and disdained.
The message is not, as might be presumed, that
the issue is wrong. Many of the same students who
opposed Stanford war research oppose ROTC.
Unlike the most militant radicals, however, the
bulk of students have not crossed the line of real
or unreal frustration when violence becomes a
readily used weapon.

The resulting isolation of radicals this first week
ol Spring Quarter is an inevitable development on
a campus, and in a society, where violent change is
deplored and repressed.
Vet to the radicals, justifiably or not, violence
seems to be the last tactic left. Ironically, when
they need mass support most, they are employing
a tactic that produces the least. Roots of this
trouble are visible in the development of the
Stanford radical movement in recent years.
In Autumn 1967, students and faculty
demonstrated outside liicina Hall against CIA
recruiting interviews. The interviews were
disrupted and the alleged offenders were
proceeded by the campus judicial system, l or six
months their cases were toyed with by the Student
Judicial Council. Finally an all-faculty judicial
review board took jurisdiction and ordered
suspension of the students.
Three days later, students occupied the Old
Union in Stanford's first major sit-in. With the
sit-in, developed Stanford's early style of militant
mass action nonviolence and education.
Students took over the Old Union to force the
administration to recant on the recommended
suspensions and to use the building seizure as a
dramatic focal point for debate about university
governance. The enti-e campus watched closely as
the active students, faculty, and administrators
jockeyed for position. Mass rallies outside the Old
Union were attended by thousands.
Decision-making in the Old Union was touted
to be democratic, but if not entirely successful, at
least the leaders had to keep an eye on community
opinion.

Coming shortly after Columbia University's
massive student-police battles, people marveled at
the relative calm and good manners at Stanford.
Though the majority of students balloting in a
later election that spring voted against the sit-in as
a viable method of change, radicals were far from
alienated. And they were far from frustrated
because their immediate demands had been met.
But 1968 was a bitter year for the nation.
Students who placed their hope in McCarthy and
Kennedy felt abandoned and disgusted by Chicago
and November, and deeply wounded by June in
Los Angeles and April in Memphis. At Chicago,
repression had raised its ugly head.
In January 1969, following a peaceful Autumn
on campus, radicals broke up a Trustees' meeting
and shortly thereafter, black students briefly
assaulted the bookstore. The shattered glass in the
bookstore was the first mass action violence on
campus.
Radicals were waiting, not looking for more
violence but looking for an issue. They got it on
March 11,. 1969 .when Trustees educated the
campus in Memorial Auditorium. No single event
in recent years nag greater ramifications.
Until that day,, radicals were accepted as part of
the Stanford scene, but viewed as slightly fanatic
by most students. In Memorial Auditorium,
students discovered that radical criticism of the
Trustees, at least, was justified. In fact, many
moderate students were outraged by the Trustee
showing.
The base was built for the April 3 Movement.
In their guts and in their heads, many students felt
war research had to stop at Stanford. The results
are well-known recent history. At thv beginning
the movement was open. I! drew wide support,
even after occupying AI:L. For the first few days
in the lab, complicity letters poured in from dorms
and fraternities. More than 1600 students signed.
Just prior to the sit-in. President Pit/er took the
students message to the Board in an eloquent
statement asking the board to reverse its priorities
and pay heed to the voices of change.
Again, as in the Old Union, the campus's
attention was transfixed on the demonstration.
More than at the Old Union, a community of
students and faculty formed, pledged to seek
peace through peaceful methods.
And then the dream began to shatter.
I he complex issues, and growing impatience on
all sides built the crescendo of the May I l iicina
sit-in and the demonstrations outside SRI on
Hanover Street. As tempers flared, tactics
toughened on both sides. Students violently
overran Encina and the University called in police
and got a court injunction against further
demonstrations on campus.

Students moved off campus, and battled with
police. With each step, fewer and fewer students
took part. A3M became sour and bitter and its
numbers diminished. The fewer the numbers, the
more necessary it became to catch attention via
violence.
By June, Stanford was exhausted. No issue this
year galvani/ed support. Thinking issues
themselves were no longer inflammatory, radicals
have decided to use violence and terror to draw
attention to issues.
Unfortunately, the violence and not the issues
become the key. In time, enough violent forays
around campus may produce bloodshed and a
resulting campus outcry. ROTC will not be the
concern. Perhaps outrage against police will do for
radicals and their broader concern about society.
But lor now, their tactic is not working. They
are discovering that if you build a big enough fire
it will attract attention but people will stay away
from the heat.
Their mistake may well be Stanford's loss.
Radicals are saying the right things in America.
But they are cutting off their support.
