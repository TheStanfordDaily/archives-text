# Stanford Prof Calls For National Population Policy
## 
### 
JEFFERSON CITY (AP) - John
H. Thomas, Stanford University
ecologist, said Tuesday the
nation's deteriorating
environment comes back
eventually to the population
problem.
"The United States must adopt
a policy of population
stabilization as a national goal,"
he said. "This is imperative."

Thomas spoke at a banquet on
the opening day of the three-day
Missouri Governor's conference
on Urban Affairs. He said there is
a lot of hope that the massive
problems can be solved.
He suggested "much more
federal money into family
planning." He also urged stepped
up sex education, birth control,
dissemination of contraceptives

and said he would like to see
abortion made a strictly personal
matter.
Thomas said he thought a
system of incentives including tax
advantages, would be better than
a system of penalties.
"We may have to pay people
not to have children," he said.
"At some point in the luture,
the population of the world is
going to have to stop growing. It
may come about by war,
starvation or poisoning the entire
planet ..."
He gave this equation :
"The present population plus
increasing population, plus high
living standards in part of the
world, plus rising expectations
throughout thy world causes
environmental deterioration.
Population is the common
denominator that we simply can't
get away from."
Dr. Arthur Neilson of St.
Louis, chairman of the state
medical association's
environmental health committee,
warned that "mankind stands
today at a moment in history
when there is a sickness abroad
that could spell final disaster for
us all."
He said a way must be found
somehow to get out of the trap of
urbanization with its air and water
pollution, psychic trauma and loss
of esthetic values.
