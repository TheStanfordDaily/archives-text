# New Device Developed To Aid Heart Effort
## 
### 
A light-weight bed with a space-age name is providing Stanford
University scientists with new information on drugs that affect the
heart and heart transplant rejection.
Called a ballistocardiogram (BCG), the apparatus enables the
measurement, literally, of the hurling or ejection of blood from the
heart, according to Dr. N. Ty Smith, assistant professor of anesthesia
at Stanford University School of Medicine and director of the BCG
research project. Dr. Smith's work is supported by the National
Institutes of Health.
"The first thing that goes wrong with the heart is not its ability to
put out a certain amount of blood, but its ability to accelerate the
blood into the area," Dr. Smith says. "Therefore, the measurement of
this ability is a good indicator of the heart's overall function."
He compares good or bad heart function with two cars. While both
may be able to eventually travel between two points or at a certain
speed, it is the car with "get-up-and-go" from the stop light that
performs better.
Pendulum Principle
To record the BCG, a patient simply lies on a cot-like bed weighing
four pounds that is delicately suspended from eight 9'/2 foot wires that
extend through the ceiling of the BCG laboratory. The apparatus
works on the principle of a pendulum, with the long suspension wires
giving the BCG bed a natural swinging frequency that is lower than
the natural heart beat of the subjects to be studied.
"This design, with the bed so lightly coupled to earth, enables us to
measure the movements of the body caused by acceleration of blood
in the body," Dr. Smith points out. The movement is measured by a
highly sensitive accelerometer, a direct spin-off of the space program,
which is attached to the foot of the bed. This information is
converted to an electrical signal which is recorded, amplified and
printed out on paper for the doctors to study.
Drugs and Heart Function
Using volunteer subjects with normal function, Dr. Smith and his
associates, Dr. Thomas Shakespeare and Dr. Jack Reitan, postdoctoral

fellows in anesthesiology, have used the BCG extensively to study the
effects of drugs, particularly anesthetic agents, that depress heart
function."
"We have also investigated drugs that raise the blood pressure," Dr.
Smith noted. "Some drugs, using more conventional monitoring
devices, may indicate on paper that they raise blood pressure, thus
increasing the blood flow to vital organs of the body. Using the B( (■
we have found that in fact these drugs do not stimulate the heart to
pump more blood, but instead raise the pressure by constricting the
blood vessels and thus further decrease blood flow."

In heart transplantation, the BCG is another valuable tool used to
detect rejection. Coupled with other devices such as the
electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical properties of the
heart, by BCG, by measuring the mechanical function is able to tell li
the heart's pumping ability has been affected b., rejection. This
additional information aids the physicians to decide if rejection is or is
not occurring and if treatment is effective.
"The principle of the BCG is not now, with crude uses ol it
reported in the late 1800's," L)r. Smith says. "But all ol its use until
recently was a hit-and-miss proposition. It is only in the last several
years, with the interest and input of engineers and physicists that the
BCG has been refined into a precise science."

speed, it is the car with "get-up-and-go" from the stop light that
performs better.
Pendulum Principle
To record the BCG, a patient simply lies on a cot-like bed weighing
four pounds that is delicately suspended from eight 9'/2 foot wires that
extend through the ceiling of the BCG laboratory. The apparatus
works on the principle of a pendulum, with the long suspension wires
giving the BCG bed a natural swinging frequency that is lower than
the natural heart beat of the subjects to be studied.
"This design, with the bed so lightly coupled to earth, enables us to
measure the movements of the body caused by acceleration of blood
in the body," Dr. Smith points out. The movement is measured by a
highly sensitive accelerometer, a direct spin-off of the space program,
which is attached to the foot of the bed. This information is
converted to an electrical signal which is recorded, amplified and
printed out on paper for the doctors to study.
Drugs and Heart Function
Using volunteer subjects with normal function, Dr. Smith and his
associates, Dr. Thomas Shakespeare and Dr. Jack Reitan, postdoctoral

fellows in anesthesiology, have used the BCG extensively to study the
effects of drugs, particularly anesthetic agents, that depress heart
function."
"We have also investigated drugs that raise the blood pressure," Dr.
Smith noted. "Some drugs, using more conventional monitoring
devices, may indicate on paper that they raise blood pressure, thus
increasing the blood flow to vital organs of the body. Using the B( (■
we have found that in fact these drugs do not stimulate the heart to
pump more blood, but instead raise the pressure by constricting the
blood vessels and thus further decrease blood flow."

In heart transplantation, the BCG is another valuable tool used to
detect rejection. Coupled with other devices such as the
electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical properties of the
heart, by BCG, by measuring the mechanical function is able to tell li
the heart's pumping ability has been affected b., rejection. This
additional information aids the physicians to decide if rejection is or is
not occurring and if treatment is effective.
"The principle of the BCG is not now, with crude uses ol it
reported in the late 1800's," L)r. Smith says. "But all ol its use until
recently was a hit-and-miss proposition. It is only in the last several
years, with the interest and input of engineers and physicists that the
BCG has been refined into a precise science."


HEART FUNCTION MONITORED—Stanford University scientists here are
using a highly sensitive device to provide information on drugs that affect the
heart and heart transplant rejection. Called a ballistocardiogram (BCG), the
light-weight bed suspended on long wires, measures the hurling or ejection ol
blood from the heart.
A light-weight bed with a space-age name is providing Stanford
University scientists with new information on drugs that affect the
heart and heart transplant rejection.
Called a ballistocardiogram (BCG), the apparatus enables the
measurement, literally, of the hurling or ejection of blood from the
heart, according to Dr. N. Ty Smith, assistant professor of anesthesia
at Stanford University School of Medicine and director of the BCG
research project. Dr. Smith's work is supported by the National
Institutes of Health.
"The first thing that goes wrong with the heart is not its ability to
put out a certain amount of blood, but its ability to accelerate the
blood into the area," Dr. Smith says. "Therefore, the measurement of
this ability is a good indicator of the heart's overall function."
He compares good or bad heart function with two cars. While both
may be able to eventually travel between two points or at a certain
speed, it is the car with "get-up-and-go" from the stop light that
performs better.
