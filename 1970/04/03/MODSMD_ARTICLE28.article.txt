explains that the statewide
organization hopes to obtain
about 3,000,000 signatures on
their proclamations. The
committee thinks that this

massive support will nudge the
legislators toward action.
There have already been some
hints of legislative support for the
proposal. The main backing so far
has been from Democratic
Gubernatorial nominee Jesse
U nruh."
In a recent statement Unruh
said, "I am delighted to offer my
full support to the plan of the
Martin Luther King Holiday
Committee to conduct a
door to-door solicitation asking
for 1..)i Kind's birthday to he
i, 1 (. alilornia holiday. Martin
Luther King represented all that is
forward looking and progressive in
American society and was an
outstanding representative of his
race."
