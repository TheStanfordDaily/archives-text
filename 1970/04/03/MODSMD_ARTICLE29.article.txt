# Radicals Vs. Arena
## Libertarians Split On ROTC Question 
### 
Yesterday's ARENA did not
print a letter to the editor which
vehemently attacked THE
ARENA'S stand upholding the
legitimacy of ROTC.
Those associated with the
letter point out that a copy of the
text was shown to ARENA editor
Harvey Hukari almost a week
before the current issue appeared.
At that time, they maintain,
Hukari agreed to print the letter.

Signers of the letter include the
business manager of THE ARENA
and the treasurer of the Free
Campus Movement, which Hukari
heads. This may reflect severe
internal disagreements among
those who once constituted the
membership of Stanford's
now-disaf filiated chapter of
Young Americans for Freedom.
Others of the signers were never
members of the conservative
movement and are anarchists and

decent ralists of various
tendencies.
Hukari told THE DAILY
yesterday that tlu> letter was held
for lack of space and said he had
planned to run ii in a later issue.
Bill Evers, a signer of the letter,
commented, "Hukari obviously
has space constraints, but what he
does within those constraints is
affected by his political stance.
The letter is obviously of topical
interest."
The letter was written before
the announcement of the
Academic Council vote on limited
credit for ROTC and does not
refer to the incidents which have
occurred since then. Some
speculation among the letter's
signers has tended toward the
opinion that Hukari did not wish
to associate THE ARENA in any
way with anti-ROTC sentiment at
.> a time when anti-ROTC activities
? were going on at Stanford.
Text of the letter follows:
r
1 As libertarians, we strongly
e oppose the position adopted by
â–  THE ARENA on the question of
t the Reserve Officers Training
Corps.
i
s ROTC at Stanford is NOT
. preparation for a career in an
J all-volunteer, voluntarily financed,
s non-aggressive militia, which
e functions only as a defense force.
ROTC is instead an integral part

of the welfare-warfare state
apparatus which is attempting
right now to extend all over the
world the same sort of corporate
state economy which we object to
very much here in America.
ROTC at Stanford is part of
the war machine which has
intervened in Southeast Asii.. This
is a war machine which munches
on the bodies of Americans and
Asians, sucks students into ROTC
in the shadow of the unwanted
slavery of the draft, and wallows
in the riches amassed from its
tax-exploitation of the citizenry.
The words of Herbert Spencer
point directly to what is at issue
here: "Whatever fosters militarism
makes for barbarism and whatever
fosters peace makes for
civilization. There are two
fundamentally opposed principles
on which social life may be
organize d - com pu Isor y
co-operation and voluntary
cooperation: tlu> one implying
coercive institutions and the other
free institutions. Just in
proportion as military activity is
great does the coercive regime
(which army organization
exemplifies in full) pervade more
and more the whole society."
