# Bergman And Beckett This Weekend
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
This weekend treat your mind
to Bergman, Jones, and Beckett,.
Saturday at 7,8, and 9, Tresidder
is presenting Bergman's
"Persona," a film more than a few
people have had difficulty
understanding. Bergman himsell
said of "Persona": "On many
points I am unsure, and in one
instance, at least, 1 know
nothing."
"Persona" explores the
relationship between a young
nurse, Alma (from the Celiic "all
good"), who looks alter Elisabeth
Vogler (symbol of the artist,
confirmed by the fact that she is
called Vogler), a famous actress
who has lapsed into absolute
silence. This symbolic film might
be considered a study of
non-communication.
Beckett Film
Also on Saturday, the filmed
version of Leßoi Jones' play
"Dutchman" and Samuel
Beckett's only attempt at writing
a film, entitled "Film," will be
shown at 7,9, and 1 1 in Cubberly.
Beckett has never allowed any of
his plays to be filmed because he
feels that there is a distinct
difference between the art of the
theatre and the art of film. So, he
agreed to write an original
screenplay, and persuaded Buster
Keaton to star.

beckett felt that his "Film"
should possess a slightly stylized
comic reality similar to that of a
s-lent movie. Consequently, the

only sound during the twenty-tv o
minutes is "ssh . .
The director Alan Schneidei
claims that all the critics

misunderstood the intention of
the film when it was released in
J. 963. What Schneider and
Beckett said they were trying to
do was present two different
visions of reality: that of the
perceiving "eye" constantly
observing the object (the script
was once titled "The Eye"), and
that of the object observing his
environment. The object was to
possess varying degrees of
awareness of being perceived by
the eye and make varying
attempts to escape from this
perception.
The story of the film was
simply that the object's attempt
to remove all perception
ultimately failed because he could
not get rid of self-perception. In
Beckett's words, "esse est
percipi:" to be is to be perceived.
Now that you've grasped the
essence of "Film", take a
philosophy major to lunch.
Siiii <lu > Flicks
Sunday at 7:30 "The Sand
Pebbles," starring Steve McQueen
in one of his better roles, will be
shown in Memorial Auditorium.
The film is a drama set in 1926,
when China was torn by civil
strife. McQueen plays the role of a
sailor on an American gunboat
caught in the middle of the
turmoil. Richard Attenborough,
Candice Bergan, and Richard
Crenna also star.

At one time the Sunday Flicks I
was a real event. However, as the
quality of the films has improved, !
the quality of the comments I
difring thf films have declined (to
say the least). The Management |
apparently has assumed that such j
assinine noises as the ones we I
heard last quarter cannot possibly
be made by Stanford students, so |
no Stanford I.D.'sare required for t
admittance. Hopefully this will
keep all the children out.
Note: The (fodurd version of
"Sympathy for the Devil" is being
shown this Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday at 6, 8. 10, and 12 at
Dinkelspeil. It's being presented
by Beta Chi and the ASSU and
should definately not be missed.

Siiii <lu > Flicks
Sunday at 7:30 "The Sand
Pebbles," starring Steve McQueen
in one of his better roles, will be
shown in Memorial Auditorium.
The film is a drama set in 1926,
when China was torn by civil
strife. McQueen plays the role of a
sailor on an American gunboat
caught in the middle of the
turmoil. Richard Attenborough,
Candice Bergan, and Richard
Crenna also star.

At one time the Sunday Flicks I
was a real event. However, as the
quality of the films has improved, !
the quality of the comments I
difring thf films have declined (to
say the least). The Management |
apparently has assumed that such j
assinine noises as the ones we I
heard last quarter cannot possibly
be made by Stanford students, so |
no Stanford I.D.'sare required for t
admittance. Hopefully this will
keep all the children out.
Note: The (fodurd version of
"Sympathy for the Devil" is being
shown this Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday at 6, 8. 10, and 12 at
Dinkelspeil. It's being presented
by Beta Chi and the ASSU and
should definately not be missed.


TOGETHERNESS - Busier Realun and Samuel Beckett oil the set of "Film."
This weekend treat your mind
to Bergman, Jones, and Beckett,.
Saturday at 7,8, and 9, Tresidder
is presenting Bergman's
"Persona," a film more than a few
people have had difficulty
understanding. Bergman himsell
said of "Persona": "On many
points I am unsure, and in one
instance, at least, 1 know
nothing."
"Persona" explores the
relationship between a young
nurse, Alma (from the Celiic "all
good"), who looks alter Elisabeth
Vogler (symbol of the artist,
confirmed by the fact that she is
called Vogler), a famous actress
who has lapsed into absolute
silence. This symbolic film might
be considered a study of
non-communication.
Beckett Film
Also on Saturday, the filmed
version of Leßoi Jones' play
"Dutchman" and Samuel
Beckett's only attempt at writing
a film, entitled "Film," will be
shown at 7,9, and 1 1 in Cubberly.
Beckett has never allowed any of
his plays to be filmed because he
feels that there is a distinct
difference between the art of the
theatre and the art of film. So, he
agreed to write an original
screenplay, and persuaded Buster
Keaton to star.

beckett felt that his "Film"
should possess a slightly stylized
comic reality similar to that of a
s-lent movie. Consequently, the

only sound during the twenty-tv o
minutes is "ssh . .
The director Alan Schneidei
claims that all the critics

misunderstood the intention of
the film when it was released in
J. 963. What Schneider and
Beckett said they were trying to
do was present two different
visions of reality: that of the
perceiving "eye" constantly
observing the object (the script
was once titled "The Eye"), and
that of the object observing his
environment. The object was to
possess varying degrees of
awareness of being perceived by
the eye and make varying
attempts to escape from this
perception.
The story of the film was
simply that the object's attempt
to remove all perception
ultimately failed because he could
not get rid of self-perception. In
Beckett's words, "esse est
percipi:" to be is to be perceived.
Now that you've grasped the
essence of "Film", take a
philosophy major to lunch.
