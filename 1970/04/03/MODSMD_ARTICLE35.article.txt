# Hornsby's Highlights
## The 						Son of Venal Vinyl 
### PROGRESS HORNSBY 
Just back from the fabulous
Dennison Clothiers, Route 22,
Union, New Jersey, where I
interviewed the obscure and easily
forgotten Blind Lemon Chitlin,
blues man circa 1930, now turned
salesman (not a bad one either
while speaking to Blind Lemon, I
bought a smart coral-tinted
burlap-weave suit). This dynamic
interview will be presented at
some later date, and will make
somewhat softer toilet tissue than
the Palo Alto phone book.
Before I start slandering
assorted topics, I would like to
describe the scientific testing
methods I use to rate records, to
eliminate my considerable bias.
The method is a simple extension
of the scientific method I learned
at P.S. 89. Surrounding my special
Sears Silvertone speakers I have
placed cages containing birds,
monkeys, armadillos, dogs, cats
and dwarfs; at the bottom of each
cage is placed specially treated
graph paper.
I play the record in question at
average listening volume (90-120
decibels) then remove the paper at
the bottom of the cages to
examine the results (a controlled
diet of baked beans and prunes is
required to keep the animals in
shape).
Compare and Save
The quality of each record can
be easily determined by
comparing the amount and
dispersion of the deposits, with a
control group kept in a
hermitically sealed cookie jar, and
with Rorschach ink-blot patterns.
These papers conform to the new
mode of excressionism, make

handsome wallpaper and are for
sale at the gift shop.
When trying to decipher liner
notes I am often reminded of the
menu at the gourmet spot, Art's
Chile Bowl: "freshest
high-altitude Rocky Mountain
Oysters, grown in the famous
Trenton Alps, picked at the peak
of perfection, dipped in rare
Frankincense and Myrrh, and
fried in AA grade Albanian olive
oil, served en brochettes in a rich
Ripple sauc over Hollywood diet

bread, the bread of all trim
figure-conscious stars, with golden
avacado stuffed with selected
lowa corn-fed Poland China
Sows."
Classic Words
Some classic excerpts of liner
notes follow:
"Her roots are in the Holy
Roller Church, singing in
cotton fields with migrant
workers (in North Dakota?)
Her statements of earthy
honesty are as exciting as life
itself."

"No long rap needed- its all
in the groove."
"His searing soulful vocals
pay loving tribute to his
well-chosen idols. His guitar
sweetens the well paced,
pulsating turbulence of Squat."
"Remarkable control in
exerting such high voltage
Rock and Roll in such a tasty
array of instrumental
extravagance and vocal
savagery."
To an old hand at reading liner
notes such as myself, several
approaches are immediately
obvious Off Hand - "surprisingly,
it was a real pleasure to listen to
Kumquat." Enthusiastic "far out,
groovy fab gear, heavy, ho wow,
get it on, right on, a la Zap
comix. This commune of
stoned soul freaks really zonks
my nose and homogenizes my
entrails."
At last he's Here-Why haven't
seen him before?
"Working the rounds with Big
Boy Arthur Crudup, Mississippi
John Hurt, Yoko Ono, Blind
Lemon Chitlin and other
unknowns during the hard years
of the late '50's discovered
workingin a hair piece emporium
for the last 1 0 years, Feral Stump
is finally here."
Just on the Scene
"The sounds that this group of
talented 8 year olds puts out will
blow your mind; getting together
in Miss Kelly's class at Waldorf
Elementary school, this young
dynamite knew the top was
within reach."
