# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Conductors : Creative or Conceited 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
I have had the privilege over the
last three weeks to attend
symphony concerts led by four
different conductors, with two
separate orchestras in their own
halls. This opportunity has led me
to some thoughts on composers
and how they guide an orchestra.
What the audience usually sees
is a distinguished-looking fellow in
tails waving a little white stick at
90 or so musicians, producing
music. Although the actual
performance is a small part of the
conductor's job, it has always
been an important part of his
concert-hall personality. In fact,
Leopold Stokowski's gestures
were so unique that he once used
a demonstration of his baton
work as identification in cashing a
check.
Although the popularity of a
conductor may be affected by his
treatment ol the audience
(Leonard Bernstein's
lecture-conversations have earned
him the affectionate nickname of
"Bernard Learnstein"), his ability
to inspire contributions, and his
attraction for the ladies, the
production he gets from the

orchestra is based on other
factors.
Music Makers
The music is actually produced
in long hours of practice by the
musicians alone, learning their
parts, and then by the orchestra
together. It is in full rehearsal that
the conductor must subordinate
the tremendous egos of his
musicians to the good of the
whole, developing the delicate
mixture of instrumental tone
which the composer forsaw.
The conductor either attempts
to bring to life just what the
composer ordered, or to make
something new of the raw
material available to him. Neither
the decision nor the production is
easy.
Of course, the quality of the
musicians and the instruments
they play contribute to the
performance. George Szell gets a
particularly rich sound from his
violin section, particularly
amenable to performance of
Beethoven and Mozart. Not only
are his violinists superb musicians,
but the section contains fifteen
Stradivari violins (considered far
superior to any others) and

numerous other Italian 18th
century violin masterpieces.
Interpretation
The conductor must know the
score so well that the notes and
phrases are a part of him. He only
glances at the score sheet before
him (if he actually feels he needs
one), spending his conscious
energy in bringing out the
subtleties of the piece. Each
conductor has very personal ideas
about how a given piece of music
should be interpreted â€¢ lengths of
holds, placement of accents,
volume levels of each section,
tone color for each passage, and a
hundred less describable things.
A case can be made that any
interpretation is as valid as any
other. To the extent that the
orchestra can do and does what
the conductor dictates, the
performance is merely an
extention of the conductor's
thoughts. In this light, we can
disagree with his opinions, but not
with their value.
In spite of this, music critics
and audiences tend to decide on
the quality of a performance by
what they like to hear. (This is
after the technical quality of the
musicians has been appraised,
often the cause of faulty
concerts.) Does the conductor
follow the score (accents, volume,
speed); does he keep the sections
in balance; is the solo line clear.
How well the conductor succeeds
on these obvious problems, and
the "feeling" or "meaning" he is
able to add to the piece, decides
the ultimate success or failure of a
concert.
Recent Conductors
As I said, I was able to hear
Seiji Ozawa, Karel Ancerl and
Henry Lewis with San Francisco,
and Jacques Singer with the
Oregon Symphony. As followers
of this column are aware by now,

I think Ozawa will be the best
tiling to have happened to the San
Francisco Symphony in some
time. He is young, brt extremely
talented, with an understanding of
the contemporary works and
methods that Maestro Krips lacks.
However, Ancerl's "Dvorak's
Requiem" was easily the best
concert given by the Symphony
this season. Despite several
weaknesses in the bass line of
both choir and solo quartet, the
handling and blending of vocal
and instrumental lines was
nothing short of masterful.
Ancerl, former music director of
the Czech Philharmonic who takes
over from Seiji Ozawa in Toronto
next year, showed clearly that he
is among the most sensitive of
conductors.
Henry Lewis, of the New Jersey
Symphony, is a young dynamic
conductor with a feeling for
the dramatic. He led the
Symphony this week in an
emotional version of Brahm's
"Symphony No. 3," emphasizing
every mood change. In -the
modern work on the program,
William Kraft's "Concerto for
Four Percussion Soloists and
Orchestra," Lewis handled the
emotionality with care. This
piece, a concerto grosso for a
myriad of percussion instruments
played by four musicians,
alternates moods from lonely
sparse xylophone-vibraphone lines
to the fearful threatening of a
powerful extended tympani solo.
The directorial work for this
piece must have required
considerable patience as well the
great skill Lewis clearly possesses.
And although there were a few
giggles from patrons between
movements, the audience gave the
piece and the soloists a rousing
ovation after the final chord,
much to my surprise.
Up North

Jacques Singer of the Oregon
Symphony is obsessed with his
own greatness. His conducting
style does not show the fluidity of
Lewis, the sparseness of Ancerl or
the delicacy of Ozawa; it is a poor
copy of Bernstein's, exaggerated
and flamboyant. His direction
reflects his personality:
bombastic, frenetic, blatant.
The contrast between the
studied quietude of Ancerl and
the hyperkinesis of Singer was
what set me to thinking about the
conductor's art. It seems that
conducting is much like all other
fields of endeavor: a certain
proclivity is molded by careful
training, and confidence is
instilled by successes and belief in
one's own ability.
Ancerl, Lewis, Ozawa, and
Krips all show that they know
they are qualified; this assuredness
rubs off on the musicians who can
trust in their leader and perform
their best. Singer, however, seems
to be dreadfully unsure of his
qualifications.
Many Portland symphony goers
quite agree. Rumor has it that
Singer was offered a renewal of
his contract with a salary cut, in
hopes that he would refuse it.
Having no other options available,
he signed the contract, to the
chagrin of some.
This uncertainty has expressed
itself in purges of the orchestra
members, cancellations of
programs, scheduling of
second-rate soloists, and many
empty seats in the Auditorium.
San Francisco prides itself on
being a cultured community. It
has managed to finance a fine
symphony orchestra and has
attracted superb conductors. Let
us hope that this tradition will
continue
