## MASH Vs. The Brass 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
The United States Army and
Air Force banned the film
"M*A*S*H" from base showings
because the picture "reflected
unfavorably on the military" and
might undermine the morale of
American soldiers. Two weeks
later the military changed their
minds and decided to permit its
screening in Army and Air Force
theaters starting in April
The official announcement
read: "The decision to use the
film is based upon the fact that it
is a farcical comedy and it is not
representative of life and activities
of the Armed Forces."
Apparently someone thought
"M*A*S*H" hit a little too close
to home.
Surgical Cuts
Elliot Gould and Donald
Sutherland portray two young,
but experienced doctors who are

where they are by chance and not
choice. Together with the other
surgeons of a Mobile Army
Surgical Hospital, they cut up
while putting together the
casualties of a Korean conflict.
They make the best they can
out of their situation, which
means getting it on with the
nurses, making their stay as
comfortable as possible, and
totally disrespecting the Modus
operandi of the military. Their
performances have an
improvisational quality that make
the film a success.

Somehow, Director Robert
Altman and Screenwriter Ring
Lardner have succeeded in
walking a tightrope across the
Grand Canyon into which so
many satirists have fallen. Two
levels of insanity (that of the

hilarious antics ot the men that
work in a mudhole called a
hospital, and that of the fate of
the dismembered and dying men
that are worked on) maintain a
very delicate and precarious
balance throughout the film.
Neither level went to extremes
by making the film either one of a
hundred stupid Army farces or
turning it into a tasteless black
comedy. I'd venture to guess that
some people will consider
"M*A*S*H" in bad taste, but
then there are those who consider
war in bad taste.
is the most biting
and witty film I can remember
seeing. It would be quite easy to
list each hilarious scene, but I
recommend you see it for
yourself. I guarantee, Sergeant
Bilko and Gomer Pyle were never
like this.
