# Indian Master Georgia Bound
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Fifteen years ago Tom Watson
took a sawed off putter from his
father and started whacking golf
balls around greens in Kansas
City, Missouri. Today he leaves
for the Masters in Augusta,
Georgia.
The Masters, well marinated in
southern sun and tradition, is one
of THE biggies on the annual golf
circuit. With ample help from
national sporting publications and
their full-color spreads, thought of
the Masters invariably evokes
contemporary visions of Arnie
and the army stalking the hills or
Jack's titanic struggles in the
rough, and older scenes with
Hogans, Sneads and the
customary green blazer for the
winner.
But Watson, a calm junior
majoring in psychology, has
important concerns aside from the
tradition and color of the
tournament. Making the cut, for
in stance.
"That's the part I'm worried
about now," he said in an
interview this week during a break
in his efforts to get his class cards
in before his departure today.
"They have a lot of good
plavers."

Last year golfers surviving the
36-hole pruning shot between 148
and 153, a score Tom figures he
should be able to make.
"It depends, though, on how
I'm hitting the ball," he adds. "If
I hit it well, 1 hope so But right
now I'm not hitting too well."
His practice this last month for
the Masters has been more
intensive (not surprising) than his
usual daily round. "I've been
working for it, trying to get down
certain shots 1 think I'll probably
use, but it hasn't really paid off
yet."
"Down there," he says, "1
won't have anything to contend
with but golf. Watching other
good golfers for a time always
helps me get my rhythm back.
And a big tournament kind of
peps me up."
Two-time Missouri amateur
champion, Watson golfed his way
into the Masters by placing fifth
in last year's National Amateur in
Pittsburgh. The top eight finishers
in that tourney are invited.
Under the watchful eye of the
Professional Golfers Assn.,
amateur golf is decidedly different
from amateur tennis, which has
been known in some cases to be a

well-paying profession. Watson
has to provide his own
transportation and expenses,
although the clubhouse in
Augusta does lodge its visiting
amateurs at special rates
Tom's father, himself a
participant in the national
amateur "two or three times." got
his son involved in golf at age six
and Watson has been enthralled
with the game ever since. But he
has no aspirations to play it
professionally.
"I'm not sure what I'll do
when I get out of school, but pro
golf won't be it." Though he likes
to travel, travelling as pros do it
isn't Tom's idea of the way to go.
Also, his older brother's Peace
Corps work in Thailand has
interested Tom in contact with
non-western cultures, where
demand for professional golfers is
not particularly strong.
His golf ambition to this point
has been "play in the
Masters" which will be
fulfilled next week Beyond that,
Watson would be happy to play
on the U S Walker Cup team, but
"There's a lot of competition," he
says when weighing that
possibility. Then a pause and,
"But if I work hard enough . .

"That's the part I'm worried

in before his departure today.
"They have a lot of good
plavers."

Last year golfers surviving the
36-hole pruning shot between 148

"It depends, though, on how
I'm hitting the ball," he adds. "If
I hit it well, 1 hope so But right
now I'm not hitting too well."
His practice this last month for
the Masters has been more
intensive (not surprising) than his
usual daily round. "I've been
working for it, trying to get down
certain shots 1 think I'll probably
use, but it hasn't really paid off
yet."
"Down there," he says, "1
won't have anything to contend
with but golf. Watching other
good golfers for a time always
helps me get my rhythm back.
And a big tournament kind of
peps me up."
Two-time Missouri amateur
champion, Watson golfed his way
into the Masters by placing fifth
in last year's National Amateur in
Pittsburgh. The top eight finishers
in that tourney are invited.
Under the watchful eye of the
Professional Golfers Assn.,
amateur golf is decidedly different
from amateur tennis, which has
been known in some cases to be a

well-paying profession. Watson
has to provide his own
transportation and expenses,
although the clubhouse in
Augusta does lodge its visiting
amateurs at special rates
Tom's father, himself a
participant in the national
amateur "two or three times." got
his son involved in golf at age six
and Watson has been enthralled
with the game ever since. But he
has no aspirations to play it
professionally.
"I'm not sure what I'll do
when I get out of school, but pro
golf won't be it." Though he likes
to travel, travelling as pros do it
isn't Tom's idea of the way to go.
Also, his older brother's Peace
Corps work in Thailand has
interested Tom in contact with
non-western cultures, where
demand for professional golfers is
not particularly strong.
His golf ambition to this point
has been "play in the
Masters" which will be
fulfilled next week Beyond that,
Watson would be happy to play
on the U S Walker Cup team, but
"There's a lot of competition," he
says when weighing that
possibility. Then a pause and,

TOM WATSON
Fifteen years ago Tom Watson
took a sawed off putter from his
father and started whacking golf
balls around greens in Kansas
City, Missouri. Today he leaves
for the Masters in Augusta,
Georgia.
The Masters, well marinated in
southern sun and tradition, is one
of THE biggies on the annual golf
circuit. With ample help from
national sporting publications and
their full-color spreads, thought of
the Masters invariably evokes
contemporary visions of Arnie
and the army stalking the hills or
Jack's titanic struggles in the
rough, and older scenes with
Hogans, Sneads and the
customary green blazer for the
winner.
But Watson, a calm junior
majoring in psychology, has
important concerns aside from the
tradition and color of the
tournament. Making the cut, for
