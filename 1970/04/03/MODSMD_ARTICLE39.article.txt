# Hamlin Adds Another Title
## 
### My FRED LEESON 
Shelley Hamlin, wrote a
Chronicle reporter at the time she
won the San Francisco City
Amateur Championship just
before finals last quarter, is
probably the best feminine
amateur golfer in the country.
"Now wasn't that a cute thing
for him to say?" the same
feminine amateur golfer said this
week. "Actually, it's debatable."
Maybe. Though Shelley had
the top American score in last
summer's ladies' national amateur
(she finished second behind
France's Catherine Lacoste) there
is an Arizona State coed, one Jane
Bastanchurry, who has strung
together nine amateur titles. But
she folded in the national
amateur.
Hamlin, a junior from Fresno,
usually comes out of the
journalistic mill as "pert,"
"bubbling," or "effervescent."
Which means she is cheerful and
talks a lot.
She also has a tendency to
speak almost simultaneously
about serious things and trivial
things, making it difficult, at
times, to tell which is which.
But seriously, the nation's best
debatable female amateur will not
turn pro. "The main thing if I
turned pro would be that golf
would be my whole life—travelling
from tournament to tournament.
That's no life for a lady."
"A tournament is a big thing
for each little club it comes to.
They throw parties before and
after, and just going from party to
party is a fantasy life. I'd rather
keep golf to the side. I don't want
to lead a normal life and sav I've

never accomplished anything. I
don't know yet what it is I want
to accomplish, but the desire's
there."
Her amateur golf intentions are
more definite. "I'd like to be the
best," she says with the
omnipresent smile.
"My main goal is to win the
womens' open sometime. I really
think I could do it, and it would
be a lot of fun. But
nobody except maybe my
parents would ever think I could
do it."
Winning the national amateur?
"Oh, definitely. I'll probably win
the amateur this summer." (Big

smile and a laugh. How do you
take that?)
Noni Schneider, who won the
San Francisco title in 1969
between Shelley's 1968 and 1970
wins, said this year that a lot of
golfers are bothered by Miss
Hamlin's "fantastic national
reputation."
"It's all kinda new to me,"
Shelley comments. "I never think
of myself as nationally famous."
About Miss Schneider, with whom
Shelley has competed since they
were both fifteen or sixteen, she
says,"I always thought we were
friends, but she was very formal
out there."

That national reputation, if
there is one, comes mainly from a
couple of stories in Sports
Illustrated in which she has been
prominent. But the trouble with a
lot of sports writers, in her view,
is their tendency to twist
statements so they fit some
particular angle. Don't let facts
get in the way of a good story, as
the old joke goes.
As a result, some things she
said about Miss Lacoste just
before Shelley played her for the
national amateur crown last
summer camo out in that second
article looking downright catty
and nationalistic when they
hadn't really been intended that
way.
Which is, it would seem,
merely a problem that stems from
another of Shelley's loves aside
from golf. "I've always enjoyed
talking."

said about Miss Lacoste just
before Shelley played her for the
national amateur crown last
summer camo out in that second
article looking downright catty
and nationalistic when they
hadn't really been intended that
way.
Which is, it would seem,
merely a problem that stems from
another of Shelley's loves aside
from golf. "I've always enjoyed
talking."


SIIELLKY II AM hi N
Shelley Hamlin, wrote a
Chronicle reporter at the time she
won the San Francisco City
Amateur Championship just
before finals last quarter, is
probably the best feminine
amateur golfer in the country.
"Now wasn't that a cute thing
for him to say?" the same
feminine amateur golfer said this
week. "Actually, it's debatable."
Maybe. Though Shelley had
the top American score in last
summer's ladies' national amateur
(she finished second behind
France's Catherine Lacoste) there
is an Arizona State coed, one Jane
Bastanchurry, who has strung
together nine amateur titles. But
she folded in the national
amateur.
Hamlin, a junior from Fresno,
usually comes out of the
journalistic mill as "pert,"
"bubbling," or "effervescent."
Which means she is cheerful and
talks a lot.
She also has a tendency to
speak almost simultaneously
about serious things and trivial
things, making it difficult, at
times, to tell which is which.
But seriously, the nation's best
debatable female amateur will not
turn pro. "The main thing if I
turned pro would be that golf
would be my whole life—travelling
from tournament to tournament.
That's no life for a lady."
"A tournament is a big thing
for each little club it comes to.
They throw parties before and
after, and just going from party to
party is a fantasy life. I'd rather
keep golf to the side. I don't want
to lead a normal life and sav I've

never accomplished anything. I
don't know yet what it is I want
to accomplish, but the desire's
there."
Her amateur golf intentions are
more definite. "I'd like to be the
best," she says with the
omnipresent smile.
"My main goal is to win the
womens' open sometime. I really
think I could do it, and it would
be a lot of fun. But
nobody except maybe my
parents would ever think I could
do it."
Winning the national amateur?
"Oh, definitely. I'll probably win
the amateur this summer." (Big

smile and a laugh. How do you
take that?)
Noni Schneider, who won the
San Francisco title in 1969
between Shelley's 1968 and 1970
wins, said this year that a lot of
golfers are bothered by Miss
Hamlin's "fantastic national
reputation."
"It's all kinda new to me,"
Shelley comments. "I never think
of myself as nationally famous."
About Miss Schneider, with whom
Shelley has competed since they
were both fifteen or sixteen, she
says,"I always thought we were
friends, but she was very formal
out there."

That national reputation, if
there is one, comes mainly from a
couple of stories in Sports
Illustrated in which she has been
prominent. But the trouble with a
lot of sports writers, in her view,
is their tendency to twist
statements so they fit some
particular angle. Don't let facts
get in the way of a good story, as
the old joke goes.
As a result, some things she
said about Miss Lacoste just

national amateur crown last
summer camo out in that second

way.
