# Violence Of Protests Requires Outside Police, Pitzer Declares
## 
### 
President Kenneth Pitzer told
the faculty Senate yesterday that
the last two nights of
"rock-throwing, rampaging" is a
protest of a "different character"
from past demonstrations,
requiring greater reliance on
outside police authority.
Both Pitzer and Provost
Richard Lyman praised the
restraint of Santa Clara County
police in dealing with the
anti-ROTC protests. Several
faculty observers of the
demonstrations confirmed this
view although one faculty
members said he had heard of
police using unnecessary force.
Lyman said that in the face of
"wholly irrational mob action"
the restraint of the police "has
been one of the most amazing"
events of the past several days.
"I don't know how long that
can hold out," Lyman continued.
"The conscious intention of some
leaders of the demonstrations is to
wear police patience thin in hopes
that the police will commit some
atrocity—or something which can
be made to look like an atrocity."
Pitzer emphasized that there
were more non-students involved
in the anti-ROTC protests than in
previous demonstrations.
No Injury
The fact that no serious injury
has occurred so far "is to a
considerable degree largely a
matter of luck," he said.
Lyman said the violence "will
only end when the community is
thoroughly fed up" . . . and . . .
"indicates in every way that this is
unacceptable."
"Our dependence on outside
authority will become more
complete, unless our own internal
mechanisms become more
effective," Pitzer said. And unless
people come forward with
evidence there is nothing that can
be done through those processes.
The demonstrations represent "a

complete departure from the
classical civil disobedience view,"
with a "complete refusal to accept
personal responsibility" for
individual acts, he added. The acts
are "in complete disagreement
with the idea of a university."
Praises Community
Pitzer praised the good
judgment of the community "in
recognizing the inappropriateness
of this action" and failing to join
the demonstrators as leaders of
the protestors had hoped.
The police leadership has been
"thoughtful, perceptive, and
receptive to our comments and
advice," continued Pitzer. But
both he and Lyman emphasized
that once they are called on

campus, the police are in
complete charge of their own
actions.
Lyman said, "We do not
control the police when they
come on campus," and it gets
progressively harder to exercise
influence when the campus
community is not able to bring its
own affairs under control.
General Motors Proxies
At yesterdays meeting, the
faculty Senate rejected a
resolution asking the Board of
Trustees to consider voting their
proxies at the annual
stockholder's meeting in favor of
the expansion of the General
Motors board of directors to
include members responsible to
consumer interests and the
creation of a shareholders
committee for corporate
responsibility.
Pitzer said that he had already
placed the item of General Motors
proxie voting on the agenda for
the next trustee's meeting.
The resolutions proposed in
the Faculty Senate were presented
by a group of General Motors
shareholders associated with
Ralph Nader.
In further action the Senate
approved the formation of a
Committee on Minority Affairs
that "shall be concerned with the
improvement of educational,
occupational, and social
opportunities at Stanford
University for members of
minority groups.
The committee will have no
executive authority but it will
"review and evaluate existing
programs and policies" and
recommend action and changes
where it feels necessary.
The committee will be
composed of nine voting
members: three faculty members,
three students, and three members
chosen by the President.

stockholder's meeting in favor of
the expansion of the General
Motors board of directors to
include members responsible to
consumer interests and the
creation of a shareholders
committee for corporate
responsibility.
Pitzer said that he had already
placed the item of General Motors
proxie voting on the agenda for
the next trustee's meeting.
The resolutions proposed in
the Faculty Senate were presented
by a group of General Motors
shareholders associated with
Ralph Nader.
In further action the Senate
approved the formation of a
Committee on Minority Affairs
that "shall be concerned with the
improvement of educational,
occupational, and social
opportunities at Stanford
University for members of
minority groups.
The committee will have no
executive authority but it will
"review and evaluate existing
programs and policies" and
recommend action and changes
where it feels necessary.
The committee will be
composed of nine voting
members: three faculty members,
three students, and three members
chosen by the President.
President Kenneth Pitzer told
the faculty Senate yesterday that
the last two nights of
"rock-throwing, rampaging" is a
protest of a "different character"
from past demonstrations,
requiring greater reliance on
outside police authority.
Both Pitzer and Provost
Richard Lyman praised the
restraint of Santa Clara County
police in dealing with the
anti-ROTC protests. Several
faculty observers of the
demonstrations confirmed this
view although one faculty
members said he had heard of
police using unnecessary force.
Lyman said that in the face of
"wholly irrational mob action"
the restraint of the police "has
been one of the most amazing"
events of the past several days.
"I don't know how long that
can hold out," Lyman continued.
"The conscious intention of some
leaders of the demonstrations is to
wear police patience thin in hopes
that the police will commit some
atrocity—or something which can
be made to look like an atrocity."
Pitzer emphasized that there
were more non-students involved
in the anti-ROTC protests than in
previous demonstrations.
No Injury
The fact that no serious injury
has occurred so far "is to a
considerable degree largely a
matter of luck," he said.
Lyman said the violence "will
only end when the community is
thoroughly fed up" . . . and . . .
"indicates in every way that this is
unacceptable."
"Our dependence on outside
authority will become more
complete, unless our own internal
mechanisms become more
effective," Pitzer said. And unless
people come forward with
evidence there is nothing that can
be done through those processes.
The demonstrations represent "a

complete departure from the
classical civil disobedience view,"
with a "complete refusal to accept
personal responsibility" for
individual acts, he added. The acts
are "in complete disagreement
with the idea of a university."
Praises Community
Pitzer praised the good
judgment of the community "in
recognizing the inappropriateness
of this action" and failing to join
the demonstrators as leaders of
the protestors had hoped.
The police leadership has been
"thoughtful, perceptive, and
receptive to our comments and
advice," continued Pitzer. But
both he and Lyman emphasized
that once they are called on

campus, the police are in
complete charge of their own
actions.
Lyman said, "We do not
control the police when they
come on campus," and it gets
progressively harder to exercise
influence when the campus
community is not able to bring its
own affairs under control.
