# Initial Crew Race Set For Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Stanford crew opens its
racing season tomorrow at its
home course in Redwood City
against a powerful team from St.
Mary's College.
Prospects are bright for both
varsity and freshman squads this
year, as Stanford hopes to emerge
victorious over perennial rivals
Washington, Cal, and UCLA.
In preparation for their short
racing season the crews have been
training hard since the first day of
fall quarter. Preparation has
consisted of a well integrated
program of rowing, weight lifting,
and stadium stair running.
During spring vacation the
crew remained at Stanford to
practice three times a day in
preparation for the upcoming
races. Spring quarter workouts
begin daily at 5 :30 a.m.
In early pre-season action, a
fast sophomore crew outclassed
the other three boats in the
annual Interclass Race last week.
Following them were the juniors,
seniors and freshmen. The
sophomores turned in the fast
time of 6:04 for the 2000 meter
distance.
In other preliminary races,
Stanford's freshman boat has
handily beaten challengers from
Santa Clara and Pacific Lutheran
University.
The varsity team, coached by
law student Will Condon, hopes to
improve on last year's third place
finish at the Western
Championships. To accomplish
this, Stanford has become the first

West Coast crew to adopt the
European style of rowing which
has proved so successful recently
in the East.
Principal competition at the
varsity level will come from
Washington, Cal, and UCLA, but
both Irvine and Long Beach State
are also rumored to have fast
crews this year. Senior captain
Don Connolly sums up Stanford's
chances as follows: "This could be
a big year for the Stanford crew.
We should have very close races
with the best Western crews, and
continued improvement during
the spring should enable us to
have a successful season."
The varsity boat will be
stroked by junior Kurt Lofgren
and coxed by senior co-captain
Mike Yoshimura. Setting the pace
for the junior varsity will be
senior John Raines, with senior
John Dudrey as coxswain. The
third varsity will be stroked by
junior Larry Gulberg, and
freshman Gary Rector will bark
the commands.
The freshman squad, though
small in size and number, has
worked hard and hopes to make
up in precision and determination
what it lacks in size and strength.
Major competition will come from
defending national champion
Washington, with other stern
challenges from UCLA and
Orange Coast College.
Coxed by "Chairman" Norman
Mau, this year's freshmen are
coached by business student Joe
Bracewell and captained by Nick
Mackenzie.

The Stanford crew opens its
racing season tomorrow at its
home course in Redwood City
against a powerful team from St.
Mary's College.
Prospects are bright for both
varsity and freshman squads this
year, as Stanford hopes to emerge
victorious over perennial rivals
Washington, Cal, and UCLA.
In preparation for their short
racing season the crews have been
training hard since the first day of
fall quarter. Preparation has
consisted of a well integrated
program of rowing, weight lifting,
and stadium stair running.
During spring vacation the
crew remained at Stanford to
practice three times a day in
preparation for the upcoming
races. Spring quarter workouts
begin daily at 5 :30 a.m.
In early pre-season action, a
fast sophomore crew outclassed
the other three boats in the
annual Interclass Race last week.
Following them were the juniors,
seniors and freshmen. The
sophomores turned in the fast
time of 6:04 for the 2000 meter
distance.
In other preliminary races,
Stanford's freshman boat has
handily beaten challengers from
Santa Clara and Pacific Lutheran
University.
The varsity team, coached by
law student Will Condon, hopes to
improve on last year's third place
finish at the Western
Championships. To accomplish
this, Stanford has become the first

West Coast crew to adopt the
European style of rowing which
has proved so successful recently
in the East.
Principal competition at the
varsity level will come from
Washington, Cal, and UCLA, but
both Irvine and Long Beach State
are also rumored to have fast
crews this year. Senior captain
Don Connolly sums up Stanford's
chances as follows: "This could be
a big year for the Stanford crew.
We should have very close races
with the best Western crews, and
continued improvement during
the spring should enable us to
have a successful season."
The varsity boat will be
stroked by junior Kurt Lofgren
and coxed by senior co-captain
Mike Yoshimura. Setting the pace
for the junior varsity will be
senior John Raines, with senior
John Dudrey as coxswain. The
third varsity will be stroked by
junior Larry Gulberg, and
freshman Gary Rector will bark
the commands.
The freshman squad, though
small in size and number, has
worked hard and hopes to make
up in precision and determination
what it lacks in size and strength.
Major competition will come from
defending national champion
Washington, with other stern
challenges from UCLA and
Orange Coast College.
Coxed by "Chairman" Norman
Mau, this year's freshmen are
coached by business student Joe
Bracewell and captained by Nick
Mackenzie.
