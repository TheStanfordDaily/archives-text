## Net Streak On Line 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
puts its perfect 7-0 record on the
line today when it challenges the
UCLA Bruins on their home
courts. Leading the Uclans into
action will be number one net star

Haroom Rahim. Rahim has just
returned from his homeland
Pakistan where he led the
Pakistani Davis Cup to a surprising
upset over India. Backing up
Rahim are sophomore sensation
Jeff Borowiak, Venezuelan ace
Tito Vasquez, and freshmen Jeff
Austin. The Bruins, who captured
the Pac-8 net title last year, are
top ranked nationally this season.
Saturday afternoon, the Tribe
meets USC at the Los Angeles
Tennis Club. The Trojans are
defending NCAA national
champions and second ranked in
national competition this year.
Led by veteran Tom Leonard,
Troy presents a formidable line-up
which Indian coach Dick Gould
describes as more "glamour and
erratic" than UCLA. Following
Leonard will be frosh standout
Eric Van Dillen, ex-national junior
champ Steve Avoyer, former
Junior Davis Cupper George
Taylor, Mike Machette, and
Fernando Gentil. In their only
encounter thus far this spring,
UCLA edged out USC for the
Southern California
Intercollegiate Championship.
Coach Gould has confidence in
his squad and feels that Stanford
can win both matches provided all
players perform up f o their
potential. Gould says the most
important aspect of this year's
young team is that "they have
confidence in themselves and I
think each of them will win at

least one singles match this
weekend."
Heading the Indian charge will
be undefeated frosh ace Roscoe
Tanner. Supporting Tanner are
frosh understudy Rick Fisher,
Rick Evans, Gerry Groslimond,
Paul Marienthal, and Rob
Rippner. Tanner and Rippner will
top the doubles line-up. Rounding
out the Tribe's pairings will be
Fisher and Groslimond followed
by Evans and MacClaflin in the
third slot. Coach Gould expressed
his most enthusiastic support and
hopes for sophomore Rick Evans.
Gould is optimistically counting
on two singles victories from Rick
over very rugged opposition.
Over vacation, Stanford scored
three impressive triumphs over
Utah, Oregon, and Pebble Beach.
The three freshmen led the way
over Utah by winning all three of
their singles and both doubles
matches clinching victory 5V4-3V&.
Opening the Pac-8 action last
week, the Indians pummelled
Oregon, 8-1. In winning all six
singles matches and the two top
doubles, Stanford didn't drop one
set. In third doubles, frosh netters
Wes Hampton and Jim Healy fell
to the Beavers in a grueling
three-setter.
In the varsity's last outing,
they overwhelmed Pebble Beach
13-3. Depth came in handy as the
Indians swept five of the top six
singles and two of the top three
douhles.

NUMBER ONE? Rick Fisher, Ireshman, makes a point of sorts in the opening
Pac-8 match against Oregon. Fisher, scheduled in the second singles spot against
UCLA, faces a tough battle as all the Indians will be out for upsets today and
tomorrow in Los Angeles.
