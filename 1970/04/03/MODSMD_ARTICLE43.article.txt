# Giant Levi's Wrist Wrest Hits Campus
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
For a day and a night in a
tavern south of Casa Blanca the
Old Man, Santiago, battled with
the big Black from Cienfuegos,
locked, elbow to elbow, hand to
hand. Who would yield first?
Blood spurted from beneath their
finger nails and the referees were
relieved every four hours. The bets
continued to pile up. And then, as
the dawn of the second day
brightened the Mediterranean
horizon, Santiago reached deep
down and powered the Black's
knuckles to the table top.
Wrist-wrestling has come a long
way since Ernest Hemingway
wrote The Old Man and the Sea.
Wrist wrestling has come to
Stanford this year, as well as to
three other northern California
schoolsâ€”Cal, St. Mary's and
University of San Francisco, Levi
Strauss, the blue-jeans people, are
sponsoring the first Inter-collegiate
Championships under the auspices
of the international organization.
The event has not yet received
NCAA sanction.
Regardless, Stanford's top
team will meet the champs from
each of the other schools on April
18 at the Longshoreman's Hall in
the city, to decide the coveted
wrist-wrestling championship of
the Bay Area. Winners will receive
a round-trip ticket to the world
championships to be held May 1
in Petaluma or $3.06, whichever is
preferable.
Presently, team entries are
being recruited for Stanford's
eliminations, to be held April 9, at
7:30 in Bishop Auditorium. Each
team is comprised of four guys in
weight classes of under 155, 175,
195 and over, plus a girl who can
weigh anything she pleases (no
weights will be revealed).
According to Levi the contest
"should provide a meaningful
confrontation between Dorms,
Fraternities, the Silent Majority
and the Vocal Minority." That
remains to be seen.
Competitors and innocent
bystanders are welcome. Register
your team with Cliff Nancarrow
at 327-2920 x 122 or contact the
