# Collett Leads LA Trackmen

### DON TOLLEFSON 
When UCLA's Athletic News
Bureau sent us a picture of their
superstar, Wayne Collett, it might
havp been more appropriate if
their shot had been one from the
rear. For if everything goes as it
should, a majority of Stanford's
runners will see only Collett's
posterior during most of the
afternoon's events.
He is an overwhelming favorite
in the 440 (46.0), 220 (20.8) and
440 hurdles (50.0) as well as a
member of the Bruins favored 440
relay squad which has run a 39.9.
Collett and the Bruins are
coming off a big 99-55 victory
over Midwest powerhouse Kansas
last weekend and they have
previously demolished San Diego
State (112-41) and Arizona State
(91-59). On the other hand
Stanford is 0-2 in dual meet
competition and is coming off a
dismal fifth place finish in the
Easter Relays.
Stanford should regain the
services of a couple of injured
stars as well as rugby player Jim
Kauffman, but even at full
strength the Bruins have to be
conservative forty point favorites.
Among those expected to
return to action for the Indians
are defending Pac-8 hurdle
champion, Rick Tipton (13.9 high
hurdles and 9.5 100), Olympic
pole vaulter Casey Carrigan
(17-4 3 /4). Sprinters Chuck Francis
(9.5, 21.3) and A 1 Dyson (9.9,
21.6, 23-5 long jump) are still
doubtful for tomorrow's meet.
Kauffman is scheduled to broad
jump (23-10), and run in the 440
(48.2).
Although Collett is the most
publicized, he is only the first of a
long list of top rate performers
who will be leading the Bruin
invasion of Stanford Stadium at
1:15 tomorrow.
In the pole vault the Bruins
have two sixteen foot vaulters in
veteran Jon Vaughn and Canadian
freshman Bruce Simpson. Long
jumper John Johnson (25-4 Vi),
javelin thrower Roger O'Brien
(204-6) high jumper Hal
Greenwood (6-11) and shot putter
Mark Ostoich (61-10V2) are all
favored in their events.
Stanford's best hopes in the
field events will come in the
discus and the triple jump. In the
discus Steve Davis (176-9) will
challenge UCLA's Ostoich
P (178-11), and in the triple jump
i Allen Meredith (49-10) will be
pitted against Denny Rogers
, (51-4).
(In the running events
Stanford's best hopes will be in
| the distance events and hurdles. In
I the two mile Greg Brock and Don
5 Kardong have both run 8:45.2
I and will be favored. And the mile
promises to be a great duel with
1 three runners from each school
| under 4:10.
> In the low hurdles Tipton and
I Bill Griffith (14.2) will be favored
I against Duane Johnsson (14.4). In
j the intermediates, Collett will be
favored but Greg Ford (53.1) and
, Randy White (53.2) might
I challenge, especially since Collett

has two other events before the
hurdles.
But other than these events,
Stanford will be in for a long
afternoon on its Tartan track.
Bruins sweeps in the 440, 220 and
100 are distinct possibilities and
both relays should go to UCLA
easily.
In fact the Bruins top four
quartermilers, Collett, John Smith
(46.1), Brad Lyman (47.9) and
Reggie Echols (48.0) all have
times better than any Stanford
competitor. And in the 220, five
Bruins have times as good or
better than any Indian.
Although there is apparently
no way Stanford can win, they
may make it closer than expected.
One thing which may help is the
fact that the UCLA squad may
travel north on a train.
Coach Jim Bush hinted at a
train trip earlier this week because
of the air traffic controllers
walkout. And if the Bruins trip is
anything like my last trip, the
Bruins squad will not arrive in the
most rested or relaxed state. But
at this point the Card's biggest
hope is for a Bruin derailment if
they do ride the rails.
