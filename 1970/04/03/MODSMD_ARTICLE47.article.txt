# Gymnasts Improve; Rochell In Nationals

"It" you look hard enough,"
Coach Dan Millman notes while
holding back a grin, "you can
prove anything with statistics."
And when he finished his
pencil work after the Pac-8
gymnastics finals last week in
Seattle he had proved conclusively
that Stanford was the only team
in the league to improve on its
score from the previous year.
According to the latest
Millman averages from seven
competitive schools in a tough
western conference, USC was off
6.6, UCLA was down 5.4,
Washington slipped 3.2 and
repeating champion California
likewise dropped 3.2 after a
weekend of heavy action and
strenuous arbitration.
Stanford, which equalled its
sixth-place finish of 1969, was up
2.2.
Highlight for the Indian
contingent was provided by Steve
Rochell, junior, who placed third
on the rings and thus earned his
second straight free trip to the
NCAA finals, being held presently
at Temple University.
Rochell, laboring under the
same strict officiating which kept
everybody's scores below those
normal in dual meet compilations,
finished with an 8.75 mark.

California's Eric Courchesne won
the individual title with a 9.20
score, followed by Washington's
Yoski Hayasaki's 8.9.
Hayasaki won all-around
honors, to the surprise of no one
in particular, but he did have
strong competition from Cal's
George Greenfield who finished
second, 53.5 to 52.8.
California won the Pac-8 team
title with a 157.80 score, 2.3
points ahead of the hosting
Huskies. Stanford's total was
134.95.
Rich Jerome ind Murray
Kephart joined Rochell in lasting
until the finals, where Kephart
finished eighth on the high bar
and Jerome wound up sixth on
the parallel bars.
"Our performances were about
as good as any we've done,"
Millman said afterward, and also
noted that "Rochell wasn't quite
at his peak yet."
But whether the junior rings
specialist will be able to improve
on his 11th place in the NCAA
finals last year is tough to predict,
since new rules this season include
a compulsory performance of a
standard routine for all
performers as well as the
customary optional routine.
Scores from each will average to
determine a final mark.

Coach Dan Millman notes while
holding back a grin, "you can
prove anything with statistics."
And when he finished his
pencil work after the Pac-8
gymnastics finals last week in
Seattle he had proved conclusively
that Stanford was the only team
in the league to improve on its
score from the previous year.
According to the latest
Millman averages from seven
competitive schools in a tough
western conference, USC was off
6.6, UCLA was down 5.4,
Washington slipped 3.2 and
repeating champion California
likewise dropped 3.2 after a
weekend of heavy action and
strenuous arbitration.
Stanford, which equalled its
sixth-place finish of 1969, was up
2.2.
Highlight for the Indian
contingent was provided by Steve
Rochell, junior, who placed third
on the rings and thus earned his
second straight free trip to the
NCAA finals, being held presently
at Temple University.
Rochell, laboring under the
same strict officiating which kept
everybody's scores below those
normal in dual meet compilations,
finished with an 8.75 mark.

California's Eric Courchesne won
the individual title with a 9.20
score, followed by Washington's
Yoski Hayasaki's 8.9.
Hayasaki won all-around
honors, to the surprise of no one
in particular, but he did have
strong competition from Cal's
George Greenfield who finished
second, 53.5 to 52.8.
California won the Pac-8 team
title with a 157.80 score, 2.3
points ahead of the hosting
Huskies. Stanford's total was
134.95.
Rich Jerome ind Murray
Kephart joined Rochell in lasting
until the finals, where Kephart
finished eighth on the high bar
and Jerome wound up sixth on
the parallel bars.
"Our performances were about
as good as any we've done,"
Millman said afterward, and also
noted that "Rochell wasn't quite
at his peak yet."
But whether the junior rings
specialist will be able to improve
on his 11th place in the NCAA
finals last year is tough to predict,
since new rules this season include
a compulsory performance of a
standard routine for all
performers as well as the
customary optional routine.
Scores from each will average to
determine a final mark.
