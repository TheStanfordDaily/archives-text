# Edwards Resigns As Senate Chairman
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Student Senate Chairman Dave
Edwards resigned last night citing
personal finances as the reason.
The move was a surprise to all.
He said that he did not even
have the $175 necessary for a
"permit to attend" which would
have allowed him to remain as a
member of the ASSU without
being a registered student.
Refusing an offer of a personal
loan from Senator Jim Schneider,
Edwards remarked that he was
already enough in debt. Exercising
the chairman's prerogative he
refused to recognize a motion of
commendation.
Reading a letter which he had
addressed to ASSU President
Patrick A. Shea, Edwards blasted
petty politics which get in the
way of the Senate business. He
reminded the body that a lot of
Americans were still oppressed
and that the University can be a
prime mode of helping those
people. "We must seek creative
ways to deal with America,"he
said.
Edwards, a black, was
considered an exceptionally
effective chairman by most of his
Senate colleagues. Towards the
end of last quarter, they presented
him with an engraved plaque
praising him for his effective
chairmanship.
He was elected chairman last
fall through the efforts of a
coalition of white radicals and
blacks. Edwards had been
campaign manager of the blacks'
campaign and active in Black
Student Union affairs. As one
observer said last night "He spent
much of his time as chairman
using his position as chairman to
aid blacks and to remind the
white members of the oppressed
condition of blacks in America.
However he never misused his
position: he only used it to the
fullest possible extent."
Deputy Chairman John Shoch
succeeds Edwards. A new deputy
chairman will be elected at the
next Senate meeting.
Fee Election
The Senate resisted all
attempts to put a no fee choice on
the April 15 fee election ballot.
After much debate and numerous
votes, the Senate gave the voters a
choice of $1, $3, $5, and $7
plans.
Half of the money voted will
be given to divisional associations
and half to the program budget.
Next's years fee must be approved
by majority of voters. If no fee

receives a majority at the April
15, 16 election a run-off election
between the top two fees will be
held the next week.
Student Financial Manager
David Swift told the Senate that a
fee of $3.40 per quarter is
necessary to maintain programs at
the present level.
Special $1 assessments for the
Daily and the Special Events
board will also appear on the
ballot.
Once Again
In what has become nearly an
annual ritual, the student
legislature passed a resolution
condemning violence. A motion
to condemn the violence Tuesday
and Wednesday and the dumping
of paint on President Pitzer was
changed to read: Be it resolved
thai the ASSU Senate deplores
wanton destruction of property
and people as a form of protest or
to achieve political ends.
An amendment to the initial
resolution to include censure of
students and nonstudents who
have fought in or sanctioned the
war in Southeast Asia was easily
defeated. The final resolution
emerged as a compromise
measure, but not after verbal
sparring between probable ASSU
Presidential candidates Patrick C.
Shea and Bob Cory.
Cory eloquently argued that a
resolution of censure for the
protestors was incomplete
without any condemnation of the
provocation for their actions: the
war in Vietnam. Shea, no relation
to the ASSU President, replied
that nearly everyone holds
personal grudges or political gripes
but still should not use violence or
destruction to right them.
ROTC Question
The Senate also approved a
ballot referendum asking whether
the members of the Association
want ROTC on campus and, if so,
whether with credit or not.
Asked by Financial Manager
Swift whether he should commit
the ASSU to provide the
guarantee for a 'Fifth Dimension'
concert for Con Home week, the
Senate with four dissenting votes
advised him not to. Swift had said
that it would take 5500 people to
break even.
Swift also told the Senate that
it had overcommitted its
contingency funds to the extent
of $800. They voted to ask the
finance committee to decide
where cuts should be made in
order to bring expenses in line
with income.

After much debate and numerous
votes, the Senate gave the voters a
choice of $1, $3, $5, and $7
plans.
Half of the money voted will
be given to divisional associations
and half to the program budget.
Next's years fee must be approved
by majority of voters. If no fee

receives a majority at the April
15, 16 election a run-off election
between the top two fees will be
held the next week.
Student Financial Manager
David Swift told the Senate that a
fee of $3.40 per quarter is
necessary to maintain programs at
the present level.
Special $1 assessments for the
Daily and the Special Events
board will also appear on the
ballot.
Once Again
In what has become nearly an
annual ritual, the student
legislature passed a resolution
condemning violence. A motion
to condemn the violence Tuesday
and Wednesday and the dumping
of paint on President Pitzer was
changed to read: Be it resolved
thai the ASSU Senate deplores
wanton destruction of property
and people as a form of protest or
to achieve political ends.
An amendment to the initial
resolution to include censure of
students and nonstudents who
have fought in or sanctioned the
war in Southeast Asia was easily
defeated. The final resolution
emerged as a compromise
measure, but not after verbal
sparring between probable ASSU
Presidential candidates Patrick C.
Shea and Bob Cory.
Cory eloquently argued that a
resolution of censure for the
protestors was incomplete
without any condemnation of the
provocation for their actions: the
war in Vietnam. Shea, no relation
to the ASSU President, replied
that nearly everyone holds
personal grudges or political gripes
but still should not use violence or
destruction to right them.
ROTC Question
The Senate also approved a
ballot referendum asking whether
the members of the Association
want ROTC on campus and, if so,
whether with credit or not.
Asked by Financial Manager
Swift whether he should commit
the ASSU to provide the
guarantee for a 'Fifth Dimension'
concert for Con Home week, the
Senate with four dissenting votes
advised him not to. Swift had said
that it would take 5500 people to
break even.
Swift also told the Senate that
it had overcommitted its
contingency funds to the extent
of $800. They voted to ask the
finance committee to decide
where cuts should be made in
order to bring expenses in line
with income.
Student Senate Chairman Dave
Edwards resigned last night citing
personal finances as the reason.
The move was a surprise to all.
He said that he did not even
have the $175 necessary for a
"permit to attend" which would
have allowed him to remain as a
member of the ASSU without
being a registered student.
Refusing an offer of a personal
loan from Senator Jim Schneider,
Edwards remarked that he was
already enough in debt. Exercising
the chairman's prerogative he
refused to recognize a motion of
commendation.
Reading a letter which he had
addressed to ASSU President
Patrick A. Shea, Edwards blasted
petty politics which get in the
way of the Senate business. He
reminded the body that a lot of
Americans were still oppressed
and that the University can be a
prime mode of helping those
people. "We must seek creative
ways to deal with America,"he
said.
Edwards, a black, was
considered an exceptionally
effective chairman by most of his
Senate colleagues. Towards the
end of last quarter, they presented
him with an engraved plaque
praising him for his effective
chairmanship.
He was elected chairman last
fall through the efforts of a
coalition of white radicals and
blacks. Edwards had been
campaign manager of the blacks'
campaign and active in Black
Student Union affairs. As one
observer said last night "He spent
much of his time as chairman
using his position as chairman to
aid blacks and to remind the
white members of the oppressed
condition of blacks in America.
However he never misused his
position: he only used it to the
fullest possible extent."
Deputy Chairman John Shoch
succeeds Edwards. A new deputy
chairman will be elected at the
next Senate meeting.
