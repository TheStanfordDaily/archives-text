## Wald Hits Pentagonism 
### 
By TINA COOPER
Nobel Laureate George Wald,
pleaded last night for patient,
extended non-violent
demonstrations to an audience of
1500 in Memorial Church.
Introduced by Professor Linus
Pauling, the famous bio-chemist
opened by saying he had been
forced to speak out by the unrest
among his students at Harvard.
"They doubted whether they had
a future," he recalled, "and the
most disturbing thing was that I
could not assure them that they
did have a future."

Wald reviewed the country's
situation, beginning with the war
in Vietnam. "Isn't President
Nixon taking care of that?" he
asked.
"Doesn't he have the situation
well in hand? Aren't we
descalating? I don't think so.
Nixon has a plan —not to stop the
war, but to professionalize it and
to institutionalize it. Nixon means
to pull out the draftees, throwing
opposition to the war off balance.
It could go on indefinitely."
Domino Theory
"The domino theory was

right," said Wald. "We started in
Vietnam, now we're in Laos and
we're getting into Cambodia!"
Wald claimed a peace time draft
was the most un-American thing
he knew, a condition of
involuntary servitude. He
demanded a repeal of the
peacetime draft and a return to
the traditional small volunteer
army.
However, said Wald, the war
and the draft were not the largest
dangers. They were simply the
by-products of the situation in
modern American which he
defined as "Pentagonism."
New Game
"Pentagonism is the new
game," he said quietly. "Big
business today has made a
quantum jump from
multi-millions to multi-billions of
dollars, and defense is the biggest
business in human history. If you
want to make that kind of money
you have to go where it is, and it's
not in Southeast Asia - it's us. The
American people buy and pay for
their military products. The
profits are made before t'leir
products leave our shores.
"The only problem is dumping
this material so we can pay for
more - and that's what Vietnam is
for.
Threat of Nuclear War
Wald went on to outline the
immediate threat of nuclear war.
An estimate of the casualties of a
full-scale nuclear exchange with
the Soviet Union indicates that in
the first few hours 100 million
Americans and 140 million
Russians would die.
"Now what can we do?" asked
Wald.
"We must work with enormous
patience. We must keep marching
and not give up. We've hardly
begun —and we're working against
enormous forces."
Wald said that military budget
savings could be used to build
housing and schools, provide food
for the hungry, clean up
pollution, and provide for free
birth control and abortions.
"Let us press them to do it, by
marching and demonstrating, and
hope for a better America. Don't
despair, we've hardly begun—we'll
be marching for some time."

descalating? I don't think so.
Nixon has a plan —not to stop the
war, but to professionalize it and
to institutionalize it. Nixon means
to pull out the draftees, throwing
opposition to the war off balance.
It could go on indefinitely."
Domino Theory
"The domino theory was

right," said Wald. "We started in
Vietnam, now we're in Laos and
we're getting into Cambodia!"
Wald claimed a peace time draft
was the most un-American thing
he knew, a condition of
involuntary servitude. He
demanded a repeal of the
peacetime draft and a return to
the traditional small volunteer
army.
However, said Wald, the war
and the draft were not the largest
dangers. They were simply the
by-products of the situation in
modern American which he
defined as "Pentagonism."
New Game
"Pentagonism is the new
game," he said quietly. "Big
business today has made a
quantum jump from
multi-millions to multi-billions of
dollars, and defense is the biggest
business in human history. If you
want to make that kind of money
you have to go where it is, and it's
not in Southeast Asia - it's us. The
American people buy and pay for
their military products. The
profits are made before t'leir
products leave our shores.
"The only problem is dumping
this material so we can pay for
more - and that's what Vietnam is
for.
Threat of Nuclear War
Wald went on to outline the
immediate threat of nuclear war.
An estimate of the casualties of a
full-scale nuclear exchange with
the Soviet Union indicates that in
the first few hours 100 million
Americans and 140 million
Russians would die.
"Now what can we do?" asked
Wald.
"We must work with enormous
patience. We must keep marching
and not give up. We've hardly
begun —and we're working against
enormous forces."
Wald said that military budget
savings could be used to build
housing and schools, provide food
for the hungry, clean up
pollution, and provide for free
birth control and abortions.
"Let us press them to do it, by
marching and demonstrating, and
hope for a better America. Don't
despair, we've hardly begun—we'll
be marching for some time."

asked.
