# Nights Of Rage
## 
### 
After the crushing finality of the faculty's vote
on limited credit for ROTC, every night has seen
radical students lashing out at the university.
Such a situation is a time for careful analysis.
Several stands arc morally justifiable and are
deserving of consideration. Some people would
like to abolish ROTC at Stanford by ending the
contract with the Defense Department. Some
would like to work vigorously to deny ROTC
credit (through the faculty at large or through the
guidelines of the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies) in order to create a situation which the
military would consider unsatisfactory and not
supportive of ROTC. Others fear that the universal
categories which Stanford academicians would
invoke in order to ban ROTC would in the long
run have a deleterious effect on educational
activities by being invoked on some future
occasion in a way which inhibits innovation.
Although these positions apparently point in
somewhat different directions, they are informed
by similar concerns. Underlying all morally
justifiable positions at present is that very hard
thing which has been at the very center of politics
for the past several years at Stanford: How to end
the Indochina War.
The tactics necessary and sufficient to achieve
significant progress are not a matter of general
agreement. The campus has witnessed the
phenomenon of Weatherman-type activity. The
rampaging violence stems in no small way from a
rage born of recognition that the Chicago
Conspiracy trial was an onslaught on the
subculture of which radical students are a part.
But this is an unsatisfactory and incomplete
analysis. Full-time radical activists at Stanford sec
themselves as building a revolution. The
revolutionary ethos is a characteristic of this year's
radical action much more than it was of last year's
somewhat more single-issue oriented (war

research) movement.
Weatherman-like violence lias proved itself at
Stanford as elsewhere to be costly to the
established order in pecuniar) terms, but lias
failed to successfully undermine the legitimacy ol
undesirable institutions. In addition, such white
radical violence apparently has only limited appeal
and has nowhere attracted mass
participation. The incidents of the first two
nights did serve to heighten political consciousness
on an issue which did not have the moral urgency
that chemical and biological warfare research had
last spring. These incidents had the effect of
intruding into people's thoughts the idea of
abolishing ROTC and the effect of that on the
Indochina War.
The realities of the present situation arc that the
faculty has made its decision on the credit issue. It
is almost unimaginable that they would change it
under student pressure.
The professors will reconsider the issue next
year, but that is a long time from now.
One conceivable way to undermine officers
training is organizing to force it to leave by making
ROTC at Stanford unbearable and impractical for
the military.
Maybe this can be done through property
damage that makes ROTC economically
unfeasible. Or maybe continued mass
demonstrations will discourage would-be cadets.
The strength of last night's crowd was
impressive both to observers and to participants.
The crowd was self-confident. But for both the
demonstrators and all others opposed to ROTC,
the limits of the situation are structured so that it
is difficult now to see a way clear to the
elimination of ROTC. The demonstrators perceive,
correctly, that this goal cannot now be achieved
through established channels.

radical students lashing out at the university.
Such a situation is a time for careful analysis.
Several stands arc morally justifiable and are
deserving of consideration. Some people would
like to abolish ROTC at Stanford by ending the
contract with the Defense Department. Some
would like to work vigorously to deny ROTC
credit (through the faculty at large or through the
guidelines of the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies) in order to create a situation which the
military would consider unsatisfactory and not
supportive of ROTC. Others fear that the universal
categories which Stanford academicians would
invoke in order to ban ROTC would in the long
run have a deleterious effect on educational
activities by being invoked on some future
occasion in a way which inhibits innovation.
Although these positions apparently point in
somewhat different directions, they are informed
by similar concerns. Underlying all morally
justifiable positions at present is that very hard
thing which has been at the very center of politics
for the past several years at Stanford: How to end
the Indochina War.
The tactics necessary and sufficient to achieve
significant progress are not a matter of general
agreement. The campus has witnessed the
phenomenon of Weatherman-type activity. The
rampaging violence stems in no small way from a
rage born of recognition that the Chicago
Conspiracy trial was an onslaught on the
subculture of which radical students are a part.
But this is an unsatisfactory and incomplete
analysis. Full-time radical activists at Stanford sec
themselves as building a revolution. The
revolutionary ethos is a characteristic of this year's
radical action much more than it was of last year's
somewhat more single-issue oriented (war

research) movement.
Weatherman-like violence lias proved itself at
Stanford as elsewhere to be costly to the
established order in pecuniar) terms, but lias
failed to successfully undermine the legitimacy ol
undesirable institutions. In addition, such white
radical violence apparently has only limited appeal
and has nowhere attracted mass
participation. The incidents of the first two
nights did serve to heighten political consciousness
on an issue which did not have the moral urgency
that chemical and biological warfare research had
last spring. These incidents had the effect of
intruding into people's thoughts the idea of
abolishing ROTC and the effect of that on the
Indochina War.
The realities of the present situation arc that the
faculty has made its decision on the credit issue. It
is almost unimaginable that they would change it
under student pressure.
The professors will reconsider the issue next
year, but that is a long time from now.
One conceivable way to undermine officers
training is organizing to force it to leave by making
ROTC at Stanford unbearable and impractical for
the military.
Maybe this can be done through property
damage that makes ROTC economically
unfeasible. Or maybe continued mass
demonstrations will discourage would-be cadets.
The strength of last night's crowd was
impressive both to observers and to participants.
The crowd was self-confident. But for both the
demonstrators and all others opposed to ROTC,
the limits of the situation are structured so that it
is difficult now to see a way clear to the
elimination of ROTC. The demonstrators perceive,
correctly, that this goal cannot now be achieved
through established channels.
