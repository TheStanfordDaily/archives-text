## Cuban Cane Cutting 
### John Spiegel 
Five Stanford students are
among the more than six hundred
American radicals working in the
Cuban sugar cane harvest.
Together with several hundred
Cubans, we are gathered in a camp
about two hours by bus from
Havana. The camp, one of many
clustered around a sugar mill, was
formerly part of a huge plantation
owned by a certain Mr. Averhoff;
signs reading "Finca Averhoff"
are scattered about the camp
along with others invoking the ten
million ton harvest.
We live in tents sleeping twenty
in bunk beds. There are rows of
showers (no hot water), toilets
and washbasins (thirty-six of
each). The Cubans have issued us
sandals, work clothes (everything
from boots to hats), and bright
orange Venceremos Brigade
sweatshirts. We have laundry
service but wash out our own
underclothes.
Medical care is excellent; we
receive standard medicines for
minor illnesses, and instant
attention for anything more
serious (for example, one instance
of a broken foot). Nearly
everyone has had some health
problems, if only colds and
diarrhea, and there is still a line of
people waiting for medicine in
the infirmary after every meal.
Facilities
Besides the forty-odd tents in

the camp, there are two large
halls, with thatched roofs and
open sides, which are used for
eating and for assemblies.
Additionally, there is an
infirmary, a set of offices for the
camp administration, a
warehouse, a kitchen and an
information tent. The buildings
are unelaborate but sturdy; the
administration offices are the only
permanent constructions.
Our food is simple but
adequate: rolls and hot milk with
sugar for breakfast, and soup, rice,
meat, and salad for dinner and
lunch; with the "meriendas", or
snacks, we have in the field both
morning and afternoon, we eat
quite well. These meriendas vary
widely - yoghurt and pound cake,
lemonade and cookies and are the
center of attention in the fields.
We break for our merienda for
fifteen minutes in the middle of
each shift.
Workday
The working day begins at 5
a.m. We start to the fields at 6:30
(often more than a mile away),
and get back to the camp by
11:30. The afternoon shift begins
at 2:00 and we leave the fields
around 6:00.
We have Saturday afternoon
and Sunday off; last Sunday we
went to the beach. Saturday
afternoon there are usually
meetings of the work brigades and

a dance of some sort in the
evenings.
The basic living unit is the work
brigade, consisting of about thirty
men and women. The members of
the work brigades are housed
together in separate tents for men
and women; married couples have
their own housing.
Each brigade has several Cubans
working with it, one of whom is
the brigade leader. Everyday the
amount of cane cut is estimated
by the leader and posted on a
board in the camp.
Cutting
The process of cutting is simple
and quickly becomes routine.
Because our mill has a preparatory
stage which cleans the cane of
leaves we do not have to clean the
cane as we cut. Most of the cane
grows to a height of about twelve
feet; we cut once in the middle,
then cut off the leaves at the top
of the stalk, and finally cut it at
the base very close to the ground.
The cane grows in clumps, and
consequently the top half of the
stalks are cut first, and then the
leaves cleaned out around the base
so the bottom half can be cut at
the roots.
Most brigades are averaging
somewhat more than 100 arrobas
(one arroba =25 pounds) per
person per day of cane cut and
stacked on the field in piles of 25
arrobas. A Cuban brigade cuts
about three times as much;
Renaldo Castro, the cane-cutting
champion of Cuba who is working
with the Veneceremos Brigade,
can cut 2400 arrobas a day, or
nearly twenty-five times the
personal average among the
Americans.
Women are cutting along with
the men; the work of piling,
traditionally the task of women in
Cuba, is done by everyone in the
last half hour of each shift.
New Environment
To this point, most of our
energies have been concentrated
on adjusting to the new
environment of the campamento
and to the arduous work of the
cane fields. Bed times vary
between 8 and ten thirty; during
the noon rest many people have
been sleeping.
Thus the Brigade experience so
far has been primarily a first-hand
acquaintance with
underdevelopment, a realization
brought on by blisters, aching
muscles and pre-dawn rising, of
what it means to be one of the
millions of men who are
condemned to labor from dawn to
dusk at the most monotonous of
tasks.
This aspect of our experience
has already begun to be replaced
by others: political discussion
among the Americans, and
learning about the Cuban
Revolution. As we accustom
ourselves to the work in the fields,
I suspect more and more time will
be spent arguing radical politics
and taking advantage of the films
and assorted "cultural events"
which the Cubans have organized
in the evenings.
We are in fact a political
convention - Weathermen,
Communist Party members,
"youth culture" advocates • six
hundred more or less committed
revolutionaries, and we are also
guests of a Cuban government
very anxious to show us their new
society.
The Brigade is definitedly more
than a group of beaten down
manual laborers - but there is a lot
of manual labor going on.

grows to a height of about twelve
feet; we cut once in the middle,
then cut off the leaves at the top
of the stalk, and finally cut it at
the base very close to the ground.
The cane grows in clumps, and
consequently the top half of the
stalks are cut first, and then the
leaves cleaned out around the base
so the bottom half can be cut at
the roots.
Most brigades are averaging
somewhat more than 100 arrobas
(one arroba =25 pounds) per
person per day of cane cut and
stacked on the field in piles of 25
arrobas. A Cuban brigade cuts
about three times as much;
Renaldo Castro, the cane-cutting
champion of Cuba who is working
with the Veneceremos Brigade,
can cut 2400 arrobas a day, or
nearly twenty-five times the
personal average among the
Americans.
Women are cutting along with
the men; the work of piling,
traditionally the task of women in
Cuba, is done by everyone in the
last half hour of each shift.
New Environment
To this point, most of our
energies have been concentrated
on adjusting to the new
environment of the campamento
and to the arduous work of the
cane fields. Bed times vary
between 8 and ten thirty; during
the noon rest many people have
been sleeping.
Thus the Brigade experience so
far has been primarily a first-hand
acquaintance with
underdevelopment, a realization
brought on by blisters, aching
muscles and pre-dawn rising, of
what it means to be one of the
millions of men who are
condemned to labor from dawn to
dusk at the most monotonous of
tasks.
This aspect of our experience
has already begun to be replaced
by others: political discussion
among the Americans, and
learning about the Cuban
Revolution. As we accustom
ourselves to the work in the fields,
I suspect more and more time will
be spent arguing radical politics
and taking advantage of the films
and assorted "cultural events"
which the Cubans have organized
in the evenings.
We are in fact a political
convention - Weathermen,
Communist Party members,
"youth culture" advocates • six
hundred more or less committed
revolutionaries, and we are also
guests of a Cuban government
very anxious to show us their new
society.
The Brigade is definitedly more
than a group of beaten down
manual laborers - but there is a lot
of manual labor going on.
(John Spiegel is a senior in
history now with the Venceremos
Hrivade in Cuba.)
Five Stanford students are
among the more than six hundred
American radicals working in the
Cuban sugar cane harvest.
Together with several hundred
Cubans, we are gathered in a camp
about two hours by bus from
Havana. The camp, one of many
clustered around a sugar mill, was
formerly part of a huge plantation
owned by a certain Mr. Averhoff;
signs reading "Finca Averhoff"
are scattered about the camp
along with others invoking the ten
million ton harvest.
We live in tents sleeping twenty
in bunk beds. There are rows of
showers (no hot water), toilets
and washbasins (thirty-six of
each). The Cubans have issued us
sandals, work clothes (everything
from boots to hats), and bright
orange Venceremos Brigade
sweatshirts. We have laundry
service but wash out our own
underclothes.
Medical care is excellent; we
receive standard medicines for
minor illnesses, and instant
attention for anything more
serious (for example, one instance
of a broken foot). Nearly
everyone has had some health
problems, if only colds and
diarrhea, and there is still a line of
people waiting for medicine in
the infirmary after every meal.
Facilities
Besides the forty-odd tents in

the camp, there are two large
halls, with thatched roofs and
open sides, which are used for
eating and for assemblies.
Additionally, there is an
infirmary, a set of offices for the
camp administration, a
warehouse, a kitchen and an
information tent. The buildings
are unelaborate but sturdy; the
administration offices are the only
permanent constructions.
Our food is simple but
adequate: rolls and hot milk with
sugar for breakfast, and soup, rice,
meat, and salad for dinner and
lunch; with the "meriendas", or
snacks, we have in the field both
morning and afternoon, we eat
quite well. These meriendas vary
widely - yoghurt and pound cake,
lemonade and cookies and are the
center of attention in the fields.
We break for our merienda for
fifteen minutes in the middle of
each shift.
Workday
The working day begins at 5
a.m. We start to the fields at 6:30
(often more than a mile away),
and get back to the camp by
11:30. The afternoon shift begins
at 2:00 and we leave the fields
around 6:00.
We have Saturday afternoon
and Sunday off; last Sunday we
went to the beach. Saturday
afternoon there are usually
meetings of the work brigades and

a dance of some sort in the
evenings.
The basic living unit is the work
brigade, consisting of about thirty
men and women. The members of
the work brigades are housed
together in separate tents for men
and women; married couples have
their own housing.
Each brigade has several Cubans
working with it, one of whom is
the brigade leader. Everyday the
amount of cane cut is estimated
by the leader and posted on a
board in the camp.

and quickly becomes routine.

sandals, work clothes (everything
from boots to hats), and bright
orange Venceremos Brigade
sweatshirts. We have laundry
service but wash out our own
underclothes.
Medical care is excellent; we
receive standard medicines for
minor illnesses, and instant
attention for anything more
serious (for example, one instance
of a broken foot). Nearly
everyone has had some health
problems, if only colds and
diarrhea, and there is still a line of
people waiting for medicine in
the infirmary after every meal.
Facilities
Besides the forty-odd tents in

the camp, there are two large
halls, with thatched roofs and
open sides, which are used for
eating and for assemblies.
Additionally, there is an
infirmary, a set of offices for the
camp administration, a
warehouse, a kitchen and an
information tent. The buildings
are unelaborate but sturdy; the
administration offices are the only
permanent constructions.
Our food is simple but
adequate: rolls and hot milk with
sugar for breakfast, and soup, rice,
meat, and salad for dinner and
lunch; with the "meriendas", or
snacks, we have in the field both
morning and afternoon, we eat
quite well. These meriendas vary
widely - yoghurt and pound cake,
lemonade and cookies and are the
center of attention in the fields.
We break for our merienda for
fifteen minutes in the middle of
each shift.
Workday
The working day begins at 5
a.m. We start to the fields at 6:30
(often more than a mile away),
and get back to the camp by
11:30. The afternoon shift begins
at 2:00 and we leave the fields
around 6:00.
We have Saturday afternoon
and Sunday off; last Sunday we
went to the beach. Saturday
afternoon there are usually
meetings of the work brigades and

a dance of some sort in the
evenings.
The basic living unit is the work
brigade, consisting of about thirty
men and women. The members of
the work brigades are housed
together in separate tents for men
and women; married couples have
their own housing.
Each brigade has several Cubans
working with it, one of whom is
the brigade leader. Everyday the
amount of cane cut is estimated
by the leader and posted on a
board in the camp.
Cutting
The process of cutting is simple
and quickly becomes routine.
Because our mill has a preparatory
stage which cleans the cane of
leaves we do not have to clean the
cane as we cut. Most of the cane
grows to a height of about twelve
feet; we cut once in the middle,
then cut off the leaves at the top
of the stalk, and finally cut it at
the base very close to the ground.
The cane grows in clumps, and
consequently the top half of the
stalks are cut first, and then the
leaves cleaned out around the base
so the bottom half can be cut at
the roots.
Most brigades are averaging
somewhat more than 100 arrobas
(one arroba =25 pounds) per
person per day of cane cut and
stacked on the field in piles of 25
arrobas. A Cuban brigade cuts
about three times as much;
Renaldo Castro, the cane-cutting
champion of Cuba who is working
with the Veneceremos Brigade,
can cut 2400 arrobas a day, or
nearly twenty-five times the
personal average among the
Americans.
Women are cutting along with
the men; the work of piling,
traditionally the task of women in
Cuba, is done by everyone in the
last half hour of each shift.
New Environment
To this point, most of our
energies have been concentrated
on adjusting to the new
environment of the campamento
and to the arduous work of the
cane fields. Bed times vary
between 8 and ten thirty; during
the noon rest many people have
been sleeping.
Thus the Brigade experience so
far has been primarily a first-hand
acquaintance with
underdevelopment, a realization
brought on by blisters, aching
muscles and pre-dawn rising, of
what it means to be one of the
millions of men who are
condemned to labor from dawn to
dusk at the most monotonous of
tasks.
This aspect of our experience
has already begun to be replaced
by others: political discussion
among the Americans, and
learning about the Cuban
Revolution. As we accustom
ourselves to the work in the fields,
I suspect more and more time will
be spent arguing radical politics
and taking advantage of the films
and assorted "cultural events"
which the Cubans have organized
in the evenings.
We are in fact a political
convention - Weathermen,
Communist Party members,
"youth culture" advocates • six
hundred more or less committed
revolutionaries, and we are also
guests of a Cuban government
very anxious to show us their new
society.
The Brigade is definitedly more
than a group of beaten down
manual laborers - but there is a lot
of manual labor going on.
(John Spiegel is a senior in
history now with the Venceremos
Hrivade in Cuba.)
Five Stanford students are
among the more than six hundred
American radicals working in the
Cuban sugar cane harvest.
Together with several hundred
Cubans, we are gathered in a camp
about two hours by bus from
Havana. The camp, one of many
clustered around a sugar mill, was
formerly part of a huge plantation
owned by a certain Mr. Averhoff;
signs reading "Finca Averhoff"
are scattered about the camp
along with others invoking the ten
million ton harvest.
We live in tents sleeping twenty
in bunk beds. There are rows of
showers (no hot water), toilets
and washbasins (thirty-six of
each). The Cubans have issued us
sandals, work clothes (everything
from boots to hats), and bright
orange Venceremos Brigade
sweatshirts. We have laundry
service but wash out our own
