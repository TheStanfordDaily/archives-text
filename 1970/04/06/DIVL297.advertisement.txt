HYPNOSIS
WORKSHOP
is a privately owned school of self-hypnosis. We
offer a seven-week course (one hour instruction
a week), teaching you how to hypnotize your
self, showing you how to do various hypnotic
phenomena, such as:
• Learning to relox deeply and quickly, as completely as
while asleep.
• Learning to increase your ability to concentrate, by focusing
your attention completely and tuning out irrelevant stimulii.
• Reducing or eliminating pain. This potential is already used
extensively in dentistry and childbirth.
• Remembering and actually reliving past events. In reliving
past events, you can experience them emotionally and with
all five senses, in a vivj'd hypnotic dream.
• Hypnotic dreams are also useful in enhancing creativity.
• Learning to produce altered states of consciousness, includ
ing the ability to enhance meditation states, and produce
states of amplified awareness.
The course costs $30, with the option of a $15 refund
on the third week, as well as a limited number of
scholarships. There will be a free lecture-demonstra
tion on hypnosis and the uses of self-hypnosis at our
office at 1010 Doyle Street in Menlo Park at 7.30 on
these nights: April 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Come to
any one of the lectures; meet the staff of Hypnosis
Workshop. If you find you are interested further, you
may take our hypnotic susceptibility test, and—if you
like register for the course. Our phone is 322-2992.
