## Land Use Forum Set 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
Popular interest in the question
of Stanford land use and criticism
of past University decisions has
led the University Committee on
Building and Land Development
to hold an open forum for
concerned groups to express their
opinions about how Stanford land
should be used in the future.
The Coyote Hill development
and the plans for the Dillingham
project are expected to come
under fire at the forum
Wednesday night, and the use of
portions of this land may be
reconsidered But for land leases
where "breach of faith or of
promise" is involved there will
probably be no change of policy,
according to Robert N. Grant,
Chairman of the Subcommittee
on Presentations and organizer of
the land forum.
The committee is also
welcoming specific proposals on
the use of Stanford land which
has not been placed in the
"Academic Reserve" and may not
be leased out or developed for
non-academic purposes. Nearly
'10% of Stanford's 8833 acres is in
this "under review" category.
There have already been
proposals for the construction of
up to 1000 units of low-cost
housing, the possible
establishment of a second
undergraduate college in the Webb
Ranch area, and the leasing of
more land to private corporations
for industrial development. There
is also talk of building a public
park for Menlo County and a golf
course deep in the Stanford Hills.
Recommendations to Pitzer
The Committee on Builidng
and Land Development will take
the presentations under
considerations before making
their recommendations to
President Pitzer. Although the
committee is advisory, "because
Pitzer does not have the time to
look into this himself, he will
consider our proposals very
closely," said Grant.
Grant said he expected the
committee to study the proposals
through the summer, and report
on individual projects for land use
one by one rather than "dropping
a finished report on Pitzer's
desk." Grant speculated that there
would be definite
recommendations by next fall.
There is considerable pressure
on the University to develop more
of its land at present. Some of the
pressure is financial. With a two
million dollar deficit from the
past academic year and more
belt-tightening expected for the
future, the 1 700 acres of Stanford
land not yet in the Academic
Reserve are being looked to as a
source of new income.
Current Income
Current land investment brings
the university about two million
dollars per year. The fee to lease
an acre of Stanford land for 51
years, a standard length of time,
ranges from $30,000 to $175,000,
payably in advance of occupancy.

Another very real source of
pressure is the housing crush in
the Bay Area. There is a notable
lack of low-cost housing near
Stanford, and the problem will be
aggravated by the completion of
the Dillingham project which is
expected to draw 1500 more
people into the area.
Local groups such as Grass
Roots have been campaigning
actively since last fall against the
Dillingham project, and have also
been urging Stanford to erect
housing structures on its own land
at its own expense. According to
Grant, President Pitzer is sensitive
to these demands and feels that
there is an "imbalance that has
overemphasized employment and
underemphasized housing."
Grant noted that one of the
housing proposals he has heard so
far that "makes a lot of sense" is
the "50% plan" which would
require any new industry building
on land leased from Stanford to
construct viable housing for at
least half of the employees it
expects to hire.
By holding an open lorum, the
Committee on Building and Land
Development hopes to draw off
some of the criticism leveled at
the Dillingham and Coyote Mill
projects. Critics claim that both
decisions were made without
consulting the community and
that the decisions represented the
financial interests of the members
of the planning commission. The
University Relations Office
staunchly maintains however, that
"in the final analysis, the people

of the area decided" how the land
was to be used.
The forum will begin
Wednesday night at 7:.'50 in the
Forum Room of the
Undergraduate Library, and is
open to the public.
Robert Grant invites anyone
interested in making a
presentation to contact him at his
Escondido home, 6H Abrams,
326-9659.

OFF KOTC —Not by the hair on our ch ii in y-chin-chin. This particular little piggy was an unwelcome visitor at the
Academic Council meeting last Friday.
Popular interest in the question
of Stanford land use and criticism
of past University decisions has
led the University Committee on
Building and Land Development
to hold an open forum for
concerned groups to express their
opinions about how Stanford land
should be used in the future.
The Coyote Hill development
and the plans for the Dillingham
project are expected to come
under fire at the forum
Wednesday night, and the use of
portions of this land may be
reconsidered But for land leases
where "breach of faith or of
promise" is involved there will
probably be no change of policy,
according to Robert N. Grant,
Chairman of the Subcommittee
on Presentations and organizer of
the land forum.
The committee is also
welcoming specific proposals on
the use of Stanford land which
has not been placed in the
"Academic Reserve" and may not
be leased out or developed for
non-academic purposes. Nearly
'10% of Stanford's 8833 acres is in
this "under review" category.
There have already been
proposals for the construction of
up to 1000 units of low-cost
housing, the possible
establishment of a second
undergraduate college in the Webb
Ranch area, and the leasing of
more land to private corporations
for industrial development. There
is also talk of building a public
park for Menlo County and a golf
course deep in the Stanford Hills.
Recommendations to Pitzer
The Committee on Builidng
and Land Development will take
the presentations under
considerations before making
their recommendations to
President Pitzer. Although the
committee is advisory, "because
Pitzer does not have the time to
look into this himself, he will
consider our proposals very
closely," said Grant.
Grant said he expected the
committee to study the proposals
through the summer, and report
on individual projects for land use
one by one rather than "dropping
a finished report on Pitzer's
desk." Grant speculated that there
would be definite
recommendations by next fall.
There is considerable pressure
on the University to develop more
of its land at present. Some of the
pressure is financial. With a two
million dollar deficit from the
past academic year and more
belt-tightening expected for the
future, the 1 700 acres of Stanford
land not yet in the Academic
Reserve are being looked to as a
source of new income.
Current Income
Current land investment brings
the university about two million
dollars per year. The fee to lease
an acre of Stanford land for 51
years, a standard length of time,
ranges from $30,000 to $175,000,
payably in advance of occupancy.

Another very real source of
pressure is the housing crush in
the Bay Area. There is a notable
lack of low-cost housing near
Stanford, and the problem will be
aggravated by the completion of
the Dillingham project which is
expected to draw 1500 more
people into the area.
Local groups such as Grass
Roots have been campaigning
actively since last fall against the
Dillingham project, and have also
been urging Stanford to erect
housing structures on its own land
at its own expense. According to
Grant, President Pitzer is sensitive
to these demands and feels that
there is an "imbalance that has
overemphasized employment and
underemphasized housing."
Grant noted that one of the
housing proposals he has heard so
far that "makes a lot of sense" is
the "50% plan" which would
require any new industry building
on land leased from Stanford to
construct viable housing for at
least half of the employees it
expects to hire.
By holding an open lorum, the
Committee on Building and Land
Development hopes to draw off
some of the criticism leveled at
the Dillingham and Coyote Mill
projects. Critics claim that both
decisions were made without
consulting the community and
that the decisions represented the
financial interests of the members
of the planning commission. The
University Relations Office
staunchly maintains however, that
"in the final analysis, the people

of the area decided" how the land
was to be used.
The forum will begin
Wednesday night at 7:.'50 in the
Forum Room of the
Undergraduate Library, and is
open to the public.
Robert Grant invites anyone
interested in making a
presentation to contact him at his
Escondido home, 6H Abrams,
326-9659.
