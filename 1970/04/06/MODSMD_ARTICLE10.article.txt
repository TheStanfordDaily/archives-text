# Caught Right In The Middle
## Institutionalized Violence At Stanford? 
### Thomas C. Dawson 
The last week at. Stanford has
seen a curious, and disheartening,
tolerance of violence on campus.
The University President was the
victim of a malicious attack which
only merited a glib comment on
the front page of the Daily. A
student was arrested on White
Plaza for possessing a Molotov
Cocktail and apparently planning
to ignite his car. More than 100
windows were broken in a
two-hour spree of violence.
The student body, and to a
lesser extent the faculty, seem to
have accepted these events with
either resignation or indifference.
Somehow many people on
campus think the violence does
not concern them. UGLY is still
open and the lake is full.
The apathy toward these
campus events is frightening. A
small group of willful radicals
have decided that now is the time
for Stanford to throw ROTC off
campus. They dismiss as irrelevant
a close faculty vote to retain
ROTC on campus. They do not
even mention last spring's student
referendum which supported the
presence of ROTC at Stanford
with limited academic credit.
Sell K\ id en I
Rather, they proclaim as
self-evident the University's
support of napalming Vietnamese.

With this assumption they justify
the use of any means to rid
Stanford of thy presence of
ROTC. I shall not discuss the
validity of this assumption here.
Rather what concerns me is the
range of means the movement
seems willing to adopt.
They are not really concerned
with convincing the majority of
students of the correctness of
their position. Their avowed
purpose is revolutionary one, they
do not seek the reform of the
university (or society). They seek
the total destruction of the
institution Unfortunately the
I>aiI> has failed to convey this
aspect of the movement to its
readers. Stories have concentrated
on a protrayal of the action, not
the avowed goals of the
movement. The coverage of the
former has been quite good but
the latter has gone almost
completely unreported.
Uoriio \ re Concern
To return to the role of the
student body in the movement's
plans, they only seek to mobilize
enough students, or rather bodies,
to shut down the University. The
leaders of the movement do not
pretend that ROTC is the main
issue. Indeed they are frank in
stating that ROTC is only a minor
issue A total transformation of

society into some vaguely defined
socialism is what is being called
for
One of the main tactics the
movement has adopted is baiting
the police. Time and time again
they say they want the police on
campus in force They say they
want to provoke some instance of
"brutality" which will
"radicalize" enough people to
shut down the university.
Concerning the charge of
police beating those arrested, I
witnessed an arrest which many in
the movement have cited as a case
of brutality. What I saw was the
arrested person screaming
obscenities, struggling to break
loose, after the police had
identified themselves. Some
radicals were attempting to free
the arrested. During all this rocks
were still being hurled at police.
This brings us to the question
of plainclothes police. In the
above case, the arrest was made
by plainclolhesmen. This fact is
cited as an example of
"oppression." Is it? It seems to
me prudent action by the police.
The rocks were being thrown at
night. Members of the movement
said they chose the night because
lessened the chance of
i ie being busted.

It seems reasonable, therefore,
that the police take precautions
like having people in tht> crowd to
observe acts of violence. Certainly
it would have been impractical to
have uniformed officers in the
middle of the mob.
Finally many members of the
movement have expressed their
approval of the burning of the
Naval ROTC two years ago and
have endorsed the burning of the
ROTC building at some time in
the future.
The last week at Stanford has
been a discouraging one. Police
have been on campus in force for
four nights. The movement has
endorsed violence as a tactic
(perhaps also as a goal).
They have practiced violence as
well.
Their tactics have not yet
affected the great mass of
students and faculty. Perhaps they
never will, yet the threat of
violence be coming
"institutionalized" at Stanford is
a distinct possibility. It is a
possibility that has become reality
at altogether too many
universities. Let us work to avoid
the institutionalization of violence
at Stanford.
