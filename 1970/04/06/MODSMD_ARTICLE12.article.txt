## Write A Poem To ROTC 
### Michael Sweeney 
Movements are cultural. Last
spring I was locked in an iron box
of sterile liberal thinking that
went round and round in uptight
circles. Then the April 3rd
Movement blossomed and a whole
mass of people moved with their
minds and bodies against a
university that supported the war.
It was a cultural awakening; it was
hope 1 grasped onto it and began
to escape from Amerika inside
me
A movement happens when a
group of people break free of the
deadly culture of Amerika by
opposing it Amerika responds by
trying to deny their humanity.
A movement prospers when it
creates its own warmth and life. It
must listen to the impulses of its
own fledgling counter-culture, and
be guided by them.
A movement gains converts
when it admits openly that it is
flying in the face of all the
established premises of the pig
society The movement must
invite people to join in resistance
because it will be good for their
minds, bodies and souls.
The movement's
kom-mun-i-KA-shun with the
outside must ask questions like
this: "How can you get uptight
about broken windows when the
university that you say you are a
part of is trying to help the
military subjugate yellow
people?"
Alienating
A movement falters when it
becomes despondent over all the
people it is "alienating." Anybody
who is still trying to live his life in

conformity with tin* rules,
regulations, laws, tricks and games
of Amerikan society will he
alienated from someone who
denies the whole mind fuck But
it's good! Anger blows off the
smothering blanket which is
tightly wrapped around the
emotions of so many people at
Stanford. Some electrical
engineering graduate student
writes a letter to the l>ail > to say
that he only wishes that the police
had used more force to keep us
from breaking windows. More pig
power to defend ROTC. More pig
power to keep the Vietnam war
going. At least people are opening
their mouths and saying what
they stand for. That's why the
march for Victory in Vietnam last
weekend was so beautifully
honest. It was the death culture of
Amerika congratulating itself.
The Off ROTC movement can
get through to people only if they
begin to reject the whole logic of
Amerika. They will keep listening
to General Pitzer as long as they
see a future for themselves in
General Pitzer's army. If they still
take Stanford seriously—with its
competition, egoism, pretension,

and criminal hypocrisy they
won't feel what's good inside
themselves.
Corn pliiiitn t
People must understand in
their guts that it's a compliment
for Amerika to call you childish.
I remember Jeannie F'eedman
running up last spring to say,
"This professor accused all the
radicals of being childish so I told
him that it's GOOD to be like
children, because children are so
beautiful." 1 love Jeannie. She's so
childish in the way she relates to
Amerika.
Dylan put it this way: "1 was
so much older then, I'm younger
than that now."
Amerika's Cliihlren
Amerika hates its children.
They are honest. They are terribly
ill-mannered until they are beaten
into the hypocrisy necessary for
good manners in this societv.
Amerika considers itself
permissive with children because
it tries to bribe them with plastic
goods. But it must crack down
severely to train them to conform
to a massive array of sexless,
sense-less rules. Get over your
childhood, says Amerika, and live

a whole lifetime of self-repressed
adolescence.
How can a bunch of children
net lid of ROTC? They can do it
by touching upon the deep
reserves of communal human
energy that Amerikan culture tries
to stifle within them. The energy
will kom-MUN-k-kate with people
at Stanford much more effectively
than a jumble of dead
worlds —you don't need a lot of
words to explain why ROTC has
to go.
Kiierg) anil Stanford
The energy can flow against
the day-to-day, mechanistic
functioning of ROTC at
Stanford—the classes can be filled
with radicals, the drills can be
beseiged, the building can be
smashed.
Meanwhile, the student body
of Stanford will have a
referendum April 15-16 on
whether ROTC should stay The
greater the internal unity of the
movement, and the greater the
chaos it causes for ROTC, the
greater will be the choice each
student will make in the
referendum. It will be a choice
between cultures.
