## Ecology And Irrelevancies 
### Brendon Lynch 
An article appeared in last Friday's Daily
entitled "Ecology and Things." It talked about
ROTC, Vietnam, the high rent locally, and
ecology. It inferred that these things are somehow
related, but it didn't say how. No logical
connections were spelled out. It reminded me of a
cigarette ad that continually harps on Salems and
Springtime. Of course the two concepts are
unrelated, except perhaps as opposites. But the
theory is that the repetition of the two unrelated
but contiguous ideas will eventually form an
association in the mind of the listener. And so he
comes to identify Salems with Springtime. Are we
to identify ROTC with ecology in the same way?
The author of "Ecology and Things" said that
several important problems listed above (ROTC,
etc.), along with ecology, were part of our "total
environment." She didn't mention racial injustice,
drug addiction, juvenile delinquency, or women's
liberation. Aren't they part of our "total
environment" as well? Perhaps one's definition of
this curious phrase turns on his own particular
political persuasion.

This is, then, just a semantic game, and
harmless enough in itself. But it could be a
dangerous game if we pursue it too far. It is
emotionally satisfying to boil complex problems
down to a simple form that we can easily grasp,
especially if we can blame them all on something
or someone that personifies evil. Witness the
enthusiasm with which Joe McCarthy's followers
ascribed all the ills of the world to the
"Communist Conspiracy." The history of the
McCarthy era shows to what inane and dangerous
extremes this kind of self delusion can lead.
More importantly, it is unlikely that bloating
the "environment" issue to include everything else
we don't like in the world will help us in solving
what is already a vexingly complex problem. It
may provide impetus for somebody's political
movement. It may satisfy some of our emotional
needs. But will it produce hard, workable
solutions?
h motional Needs
As long as we are on the subject of emotional
needs, we might note an observation made by
William L. Shirer, author of "The Rise and Fall of
the Third Reich." In this book, he chronicled how
the leftist radical students of pre-Hitler times
became the most willing of Brownshirts after
Hitler came to power. Now Shirer questions
whether people who hold extreme political views
are responding more to their individual emotional
needs than to their intellectual convictions, and
whether this is true of U.S. students today.
Now to get back to "Ecology and Things." I
won't ask whether it is true, as the author says,
that "people who work and study at Stanford
can't afford to live within a ten mile radius," or
whether "bombers are wiping out acres of the
Vietnamese countryside," or whether Laos and
Cambodia are about to be "leveled." But I will
disagree with her opinion that: "The issue is what
Stanford is doing to mess up the world." I think
the real issue, albeit harder to face, is what are WE
doing to mess up the world.

The average American produces six pounds of
garbage a day. What about the average Stanford
student? Check the size of the pile of trash, much
of it non bio-degradable, that is picked up from
your dorm any day. Autos produce over 70
percent of the air pollution in the Bay Area. The
higher the car's horsepower, the more pollution it
creates. How many of us drive overpowered cars?
Electrical power does not simply come out of the
wall. It comes from hydroelectric dams that cover
up land, spoil wild rivers, and eventually form
valleys full of silt, or from the burning of fossil
fuels (coal and oil) that produce smoke and
noxious gases. How much electrical power do we
wastefully consume?
Our environment—our physical environment—is
in bad shape, and it is getting worse. We cannot
afford to let leftists, or for that matter
industrialists, co-opt this issue for their own
purposes. This university has a potential for
leadership in attacking this dire problem We
students, alert, well informed, enthusiastic, and
free from the economic and social ties that bind
most people outside the universities, can initiate
change.
Don't Raise Resistance
Here at Stanford, we can raise the legitimate
issues that must be raised if our planet is to be
saved But breaking windows doesn't raise issues.
It only raises the resistance of the entrenched and
recalcitrant, and provides ammunition for those
who oppose student demands for change.
We cannot begin to solve our ecological
problems without the support of those outside the
university in reaching the goals we have set. And
we will never be able to define appropriate goals if
we cannot even isolate the issues at hand.
II •Off R OTC,' . . .
If we kick ROTC off campus while we continue
to pollute the hell out of the environment with the
same mad consumption as the rest of this country,
then perhaps in a sense we can have our cake and
eat it too. For in this way we can salve our
consciences with hollow victories, while
continuing to sate our sense with all the
materialistic goodies we like so well. If this is what
we want, then let us charge on down the road to
desturction, and the more windows we break along
the way, the merrier.
If, on the other hand, we would trade these
tempting emotional and physical pleasures for the
challenge of coming to grips with a hard reality,
then let us set a different course.
Reason or Orgy?
Which will it be? Will we recycle our paper,
aluminum, cardboard and glass, and begin to
conserve our electricity and petroleum? Will we
buy only products in re-useable containers? Will
we refuse to buy those detergents deadliest to our
streams and rivers? In short, will we set a model of
reasonable, responsible ecological living for the
outside community to follow? Or will we continue
the orgy of consumption and blame what's
happening to our world on Stanford, or
Dillingham, or ROTC, or some other convenient
scapegoat? It is our choice.

the leftist radical students of pre-Hitler times
became the most willing of Brownshirts after
Hitler came to power. Now Shirer questions
whether people who hold extreme political views
are responding more to their individual emotional
needs than to their intellectual convictions, and
whether this is true of U.S. students today.
Now to get back to "Ecology and Things." I
won't ask whether it is true, as the author says,
that "people who work and study at Stanford
can't afford to live within a ten mile radius," or
whether "bombers are wiping out acres of the
Vietnamese countryside," or whether Laos and
Cambodia are about to be "leveled." But I will
disagree with her opinion that: "The issue is what
Stanford is doing to mess up the world." I think
the real issue, albeit harder to face, is what are WE
doing to mess up the world.

The average American produces six pounds of
garbage a day. What about the average Stanford
student? Check the size of the pile of trash, much
of it non bio-degradable, that is picked up from
your dorm any day. Autos produce over 70
percent of the air pollution in the Bay Area. The
higher the car's horsepower, the more pollution it
creates. How many of us drive overpowered cars?
Electrical power does not simply come out of the
wall. It comes from hydroelectric dams that cover
up land, spoil wild rivers, and eventually form
valleys full of silt, or from the burning of fossil
fuels (coal and oil) that produce smoke and
noxious gases. How much electrical power do we
wastefully consume?
Our environment—our physical environment—is
in bad shape, and it is getting worse. We cannot
afford to let leftists, or for that matter
industrialists, co-opt this issue for their own
purposes. This university has a potential for
leadership in attacking this dire problem We
students, alert, well informed, enthusiastic, and
free from the economic and social ties that bind
most people outside the universities, can initiate
change.
Don't Raise Resistance
Here at Stanford, we can raise the legitimate
issues that must be raised if our planet is to be
saved But breaking windows doesn't raise issues.
It only raises the resistance of the entrenched and
recalcitrant, and provides ammunition for those
who oppose student demands for change.
We cannot begin to solve our ecological
problems without the support of those outside the
university in reaching the goals we have set. And
we will never be able to define appropriate goals if
we cannot even isolate the issues at hand.

If we kick ROTC off campus while we continue
to pollute the hell out of the environment with the
same mad consumption as the rest of this country,
then perhaps in a sense we can have our cake and

consciences with hollow victories, while
continuing to sate our sense with all the
materialistic goodies we like so well. If this is what
we want, then let us charge on down the road to
desturction, and the more windows we break along
the way, the merrier.
If, on the other hand, we would trade these
tempting emotional and physical pleasures for the

reasonable, responsible ecological living for the
outside community to follow? Or will we continue
the orgy of consumption and blame what's
happening to our world on Stanford, or
Dillingham, or ROTC, or some other convenient
scapegoat? It is our choice.

An article appeared in last Friday's Daily
entitled "Ecology and Things." It talked about
ROTC, Vietnam, the high rent locally, and
ecology. It inferred that these things are somehow
related, but it didn't say how. No logical
connections were spelled out. It reminded me of a
cigarette ad that continually harps on Salems and
Springtime. Of course the two concepts are
unrelated, except perhaps as opposites. But the
theory is that the repetition of the two unrelated
but contiguous ideas will eventually form an
association in the mind of the listener. And so he
comes to identify Salems with Springtime. Are we
to identify ROTC with ecology in the same way?
The author of "Ecology and Things" said that
several important problems listed above (ROTC,
etc.), along with ecology, were part of our "total
environment." She didn't mention racial injustice,
drug addiction, juvenile delinquency, or women's
liberation. Aren't they part of our "total
environment" as well? Perhaps one's definition of
this curious phrase turns on his own particular
political persuasion.

This is, then, just a semantic game, and
harmless enough in itself. But it could be a
dangerous game if we pursue it too far. It is
emotionally satisfying to boil complex problems
down to a simple form that we can easily grasp,
especially if we can blame them all on something
or someone that personifies evil. Witness the
enthusiasm with which Joe McCarthy's followers
ascribed all the ills of the world to the
"Communist Conspiracy." The history of the
McCarthy era shows to what inane and dangerous
extremes this kind of self delusion can lead.
More importantly, it is unlikely that bloating
the "environment" issue to include everything else
we don't like in the world will help us in solving
what is already a vexingly complex problem. It
may provide impetus for somebody's political
movement. It may satisfy some of our emotional
needs. But will it produce hard, workable
solutions?

recalcitrant, and provides ammunition for those

We cannot begin to solve our ecological
problems without the support of those outside the

we will never be able to define appropriate goals if
we cannot even isolate the issues at hand.

If we kick ROTC off campus while we continue
to pollute the hell out of the environment with the
same mad consumption as the rest of this country,
then perhaps in a sense we can have our cake and
eat it too. For in this way we can salve our
consciences with hollow victories, while
continuing to sate our sense with all the
materialistic goodies we like so well. If this is what
we want, then let us charge on down the road to
desturction, and the more windows we break along
the way, the merrier.
If, on the other hand, we would trade these
tempting emotional and physical pleasures for the
challenge of coming to grips with a hard reality,
then let us set a different course.
Reason or Orgy?
Which will it be? Will we recycle our paper,
aluminum, cardboard and glass, and begin to
conserve our electricity and petroleum? Will we
buy only products in re-useable containers? Will
we refuse to buy those detergents deadliest to our
streams and rivers? In short, will we set a model of
reasonable, responsible ecological living for the
outside community to follow? Or will we continue
the orgy of consumption and blame what's
happening to our world on Stanford, or
Dillingham, or ROTC, or some other convenient
scapegoat? It is our choice.

An article appeared in last Friday's Daily
entitled "Ecology and Things." It talked about
ROTC, Vietnam, the high rent locally, and
ecology. It inferred that these things are somehow
related, but it didn't say how. No logical
connections were spelled out. It reminded me of a
cigarette ad that continually harps on Salems and
Springtime. Of course the two concepts are
unrelated, except perhaps as opposites. But the
theory is that the repetition of the two unrelated
but contiguous ideas will eventually form an
association in the mind of the listener. And so he
comes to identify Salems with Springtime. Are we
to identify ROTC with ecology in the same way?
The author of "Ecology and Things" said that
several important problems listed above (ROTC,
etc.), along with ecology, were part of our "total
environment." She didn't mention racial injustice,
drug addiction, juvenile delinquency, or women's
liberation. Aren't they part of our "total
environment" as well? Perhaps one's definition of
this curious phrase turns on his own particular
political persuasion.

This is, then, just a semantic game, and
harmless enough in itself. But it could be a
dangerous game if we pursue it too far. It is
emotionally satisfying to boil complex problems
down to a simple form that we can easily grasp,
especially if we can blame them all on something
or someone that personifies evil. Witness the
enthusiasm with which Joe McCarthy's followers
ascribed all the ills of the world to the
"Communist Conspiracy." The history of the
McCarthy era shows to what inane and dangerous
extremes this kind of self delusion can lead.
More importantly, it is unlikely that bloating
the "environment" issue to include everything else
we don't like in the world will help us in solving
what is already a vexingly complex problem. It
may provide impetus for somebody's political
movement. It may satisfy some of our emotional
needs. But will it produce hard, workable
solutions?
h motional Needs
As long as we are on the subject of emotional
needs, we might note an observation made by
William L. Shirer, author of "The Rise and Fall of
the Third Reich." In this book, he chronicled how
the leftist radical students of pre-Hitler times
became the most willing of Brownshirts after
Hitler came to power. Now Shirer questions
whether people who hold extreme political views
are responding more to their individual emotional
needs than to their intellectual convictions, and
whether this is true of U.S. students today.
Now to get back to "Ecology and Things." I
won't ask whether it is true, as the author says,
that "people who work and study at Stanford
can't afford to live within a ten mile radius," or
whether "bombers are wiping out acres of the
Vietnamese countryside," or whether Laos and
Cambodia are about to be "leveled." But I will
disagree with her opinion that: "The issue is what
Stanford is doing to mess up the world." I think
the real issue, albeit harder to face, is what are WE
doing to mess up the world.

The average American produces six pounds of
garbage a day. What about the average Stanford
student? Check the size of the pile of trash, much
of it non bio-degradable, that is picked up from
your dorm any day. Autos produce over 70
percent of the air pollution in the Bay Area. The
higher the car's horsepower, the more pollution it
creates. How many of us drive overpowered cars?
Electrical power does not simply come out of the
wall. It comes from hydroelectric dams that cover
up land, spoil wild rivers, and eventually form
valleys full of silt, or from the burning of fossil
fuels (coal and oil) that produce smoke and
noxious gases. How much electrical power do we
wastefully consume?
Our environment—our physical environment—is
in bad shape, and it is getting worse. We cannot
afford to let leftists, or for that matter
industrialists, co-opt this issue for their own
purposes. This university has a potential for
leadership in attacking this dire problem We
students, alert, well informed, enthusiastic, and
free from the economic and social ties that bind
most people outside the universities, can initiate
change.
Don't Raise Resistance
Here at Stanford, we can raise the legitimate
issues that must be raised if our planet is to be
saved But breaking windows doesn't raise issues.
It only raises the resistance of the entrenched and
recalcitrant, and provides ammunition for those
who oppose student demands for change.
We cannot begin to solve our ecological
problems without the support of those outside the

we will never be able to define appropriate goals if
