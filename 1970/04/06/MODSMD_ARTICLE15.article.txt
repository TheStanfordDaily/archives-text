In response to the April 1
l>;iil\ article, "C'reditless ROTC
Possible," ! have received I he
following comments from Clen.
C P. Hannum, who is in charge of
ROTC' affairs for the Army
"The derision as to how much
academic credit is given for ROTC'
is the prerogative of the
institution, We encourage the
maximum amount of academic
credil consistent with thpolicies
of the inst it ution.
"We request that the
institution, in making its decision,
look at the course content, the
qualifications of the Army
instructor to teach his subject,
and Ikiw it is being taught.
Further, we request that the
course in military science be
treated in this respect as other
academic programs at the
"Regardinu the ROTC program
at Stanford University, my

comment (to the Daily reporter)
was, in substance, that when one
considers all the issues that have
been raised concerning ROTC,
and the resolution of these issues,
the one underlying factor of
importance is that, of institutional
support.
"If the majority of the
administrators, faculty, and
student body back the program,
then the resolution of these issues
could, in all probability, be
accomplished to the satisfaction
of the institution and the Army.
"(However) any quote or
inference in (the Daily) article
which stales that with strong
institutional support the Army
will stay on any campus regardless
of the form of the ROTC' is
incorrect
Three points should.be kept in
mind about Army ROTC at
Stanford
I Faculty rank is abolished,
effective September, 1970.1t does

not continue through 1972-73, as
provided for in the Faculty Senate
action of February, 1969.
2. Academic departmental
status is abolished effective
September 3, 1970; it does not
continue through 1972-73, as
provided for in the Senate action
of February, 1 969.
3. The Army, under the plan
now approved, starts with NO
credit. The Senate action of
February, 1970, provides ONLY
that the Army ROTO may submit
course credit proposals to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. The decision is, in the
end, in the hands of the
appropriate faculty committee.
The new arrangement, in itself,
provides no credit, and no
guarantee of credit.

of February, 1 969.
3. The Army, under the plan
now approved, starts with NO
credit. The Senate action of
February, 1970, provides ONLY
that the Army ROTO may submit
course credit proposals to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. The decision is, in the
end, in the hands of the
appropriate faculty committee.
The new arrangement, in itself,
provides no credit, and no
guarantee of credit.

Kililor, Tll» DAILY :
In response to the April 1
l>;iil\ article, "C'reditless ROTC
Possible," ! have received I he
following comments from Clen.
C P. Hannum, who is in charge of
ROTC' affairs for the Army
"The derision as to how much
academic credit is given for ROTC'
is the prerogative of the
institution, We encourage the
maximum amount of academic
credil consistent with thpolicies
of the inst it ution.
"We request that the
institution, in making its decision,
look at the course content, the
qualifications of the Army
instructor to teach his subject,
and Ikiw it is being taught.
Further, we request that the
course in military science be
treated in this respect as other
academic programs at the
"Regardinu the ROTC program
at Stanford University, my

comment (to the Daily reporter)
was, in substance, that when one
considers all the issues that have
been raised concerning ROTC,
and the resolution of these issues,
the one underlying factor of
importance is that, of institutional
support.
"If the majority of the
administrators, faculty, and
student body back the program,
then the resolution of these issues
could, in all probability, be
accomplished to the satisfaction
of the institution and the Army.
"(However) any quote or
inference in (the Daily) article
which stales that with strong
institutional support the Army
will stay on any campus regardless
of the form of the ROTC' is
incorrect
Three points should.be kept in
mind about Army ROTC at
Stanford
I Faculty rank is abolished,
effective September, 1970.1t does

not continue through 1972-73, as
provided for in the Faculty Senate
action of February, 1969.
2. Academic departmental
status is abolished effective
September 3, 1970; it does not
continue through 1972-73, as
provided for in the Senate action
of February, 1 969.
3. The Army, under the plan
now approved, starts with NO
credit. The Senate action of
