## Dear Pitzer: Help Stop The War Now 
### Nick Selby 
Invitation For Dr. Pil/.er'YThe

President Kenneth S. Pitzer
Stanlt> rd Un i versi t y
Dear Dr Pitzer:
I am writing to ask if you will
r! for p\'H'<' with me and other
SI-tnfoYd students this Saturday.
We in the Moratorium will be
leaflet ling in shopping centers and
•amassing neighborhoods in a
peaceful and orderly marine- to
increase public support for ei. 'ing
1 he Vietnam war
I would be greatly honored if
on would join me in distributing
leaflets at the Stanford shopping
enter at noon. I am sure you will
find nothing objectionable in the
leaflets: they suggest President
Nixon's "Vietnaniization" plans
are hopeless and that, far from
decreasing, the scope of the war is
daily increasing.
> on will immediately suppose
thai I am "putting you on," that
this-invitation to participate is a
joke. Let me assure you this is not
the case. I believe that you can
make a substantial contribution to
the peace movement, even if you
leaflet for only a short period of
I inu\
For Dr. Pitzer, you are
president of one of the leading
private universities in this
country. Your past statements
about the need to end "secret
research, the need to reorder this
nation's priorities, and the need to
end the draft and establish a
volunteer army have received wide
publicity and attention.
Any actions you lake now,
when the peace movement seems
to have lost the life it had last fall,
will be doubly important, first
because act ions always mean more
than speeches, and second because
the simple act of leafletfiiig will
indicate that one of the important
"liberal" presidents has not yet
given up hope about the public's
ability to influence foreign policy.
Ih> Not Despair!
Most of all, I believe we cannot
allow ourselves the comfort and
luxury of despair. We must insist
on keeping faith that wars can be
ended, that the Pentagon does not
have to control our destiny, that

men can someday live in harmony
and peace.
Sometimes I fear we will never
see an end to the Vietnam
debacle. But this does not mean
we can stop trying to end the war.
You have spoken often about
the need for responsible dissent,
the kind of protest that does not
lead to irrational window
smash ings but leads instead to
rational dialogue and human
understanding. 1 believe that your
helping distribute leaflets will
indicate your desire to work for
peace without becoming irrational
or petulant.
The "Enemy's Strength
We face a gigantic enemy
within our own midst: The
Pentagon and war industry
businessmen, some of whom
employ you as president of
"their," as they would have
students believe, university. As I
guess you are aware from the
recent controversy over
reinstating KOTC programs at
Stanford, these men are able to
apply fantastic amounts of
pressure to get their way, to see
that their interests are placed
above and before those of
everyone else.
We cannot believe that one
protest march in Washington, one
day of national rallies, will
influence them. They have told us
up to now that they will not be
influenced by what we, or any
part of the American people, do.
How long do you think they can
afford not to listen? Surely, not
forever. However, much patient
work awaits us.
It may take us years, decades
even, if we survive that long, to
change the direction in which this
nation is being lead by Mr. Nixon,
the Pentagon generals, and the
aerospace indusi rialists.
In the end, however, we will
succeed, for our cause is right and
just: peace and equality among
ALL men. We need only believe,
only have faith, and the yoke of
working for peace will become
easy, the burden of dissenting will
become light.
Free oneself!
Your help leaflet ting may serve
to inspire and, indeed, to free
other college presidents in

situations much like yours. I am
"pin;? you will attempt to assert
your in •j > ndence and your
humanity by working for peace:
no position is too high, no title too
impressive, to prevent a man from
joining in Ihe cause of humanity,
from working for our common
hope, peace.
Will you risk your reputation
for peace? Will you sacrifice an
hour, a day, even ten minutes, to
make a public demonstration of
your concern about the vitiating
effects of the war, both abroad
and at home? I hope you will, I
am confident you will. Please?
I would be more than

overjoyed to discuss any questions
you may have. I believe that we,
you and I, can reason together. I
may be, in your eyes, only a
student, but I am also a human
being deeply upset by the
slaughter and waste of lives in
Vietnam.
Again, I am totally serious in
this invitation. I will call at your
office to learn your response.
Help us, help yourself, help the
cause of man.
Yours sincerely,
E. NicholasSelby

r! for p\'H'<' with me and other
SI-tnfoYd students this Saturday.
We in the Moratorium will be
leaflet ling in shopping centers and
•amassing neighborhoods in a
peaceful and orderly marine- to
increase public support for ei. 'ing
1 he Vietnam war
I would be greatly honored if
on would join me in distributing
leaflets at the Stanford shopping
enter at noon. I am sure you will
find nothing objectionable in the
leaflets: they suggest President
Nixon's "Vietnaniization" plans
are hopeless and that, far from
decreasing, the scope of the war is
daily increasing.
> on will immediately suppose
thai I am "putting you on," that
this-invitation to participate is a
joke. Let me assure you this is not
the case. I believe that you can
make a substantial contribution to
the peace movement, even if you
leaflet for only a short period of
I inu\
For Dr. Pitzer, you are
president of one of the leading
private universities in this
country. Your past statements
about the need to end "secret
research, the need to reorder this
nation's priorities, and the need to
end the draft and establish a
volunteer army have received wide
publicity and attention.
Any actions you lake now,
when the peace movement seems
to have lost the life it had last fall,
will be doubly important, first
because act ions always mean more
than speeches, and second because
the simple act of leafletfiiig will
indicate that one of the important
"liberal" presidents has not yet
given up hope about the public's
ability to influence foreign policy.
Ih> Not Despair!
Most of all, I believe we cannot
allow ourselves the comfort and
luxury of despair. We must insist
on keeping faith that wars can be
ended, that the Pentagon does not
have to control our destiny, that

men can someday live in harmony
and peace.
Sometimes I fear we will never
see an end to the Vietnam
debacle. But this does not mean
we can stop trying to end the war.
You have spoken often about
the need for responsible dissent,
the kind of protest that does not
lead to irrational window
smash ings but leads instead to
rational dialogue and human
understanding. 1 believe that your
helping distribute leaflets will
indicate your desire to work for
peace without becoming irrational
or petulant.
The "Enemy's Strength
We face a gigantic enemy
within our own midst: The
Pentagon and war industry
businessmen, some of whom
employ you as president of
"their," as they would have
students believe, university. As I
guess you are aware from the
recent controversy over
reinstating KOTC programs at
Stanford, these men are able to
apply fantastic amounts of
pressure to get their way, to see
that their interests are placed
above and before those of
everyone else.
We cannot believe that one
protest march in Washington, one
day of national rallies, will
influence them. They have told us
up to now that they will not be
influenced by what we, or any
part of the American people, do.
How long do you think they can
afford not to listen? Surely, not
forever. However, much patient
work awaits us.
It may take us years, decades
even, if we survive that long, to
change the direction in which this
nation is being lead by Mr. Nixon,
the Pentagon generals, and the
aerospace indusi rialists.
In the end, however, we will
succeed, for our cause is right and
just: peace and equality among
ALL men. We need only believe,
only have faith, and the yoke of
working for peace will become
easy, the burden of dissenting will
become light.
Free oneself!
Your help leaflet ting may serve
to inspire and, indeed, to free
other college presidents in

situations much like yours. I am
"pin;? you will attempt to assert
your in •j > ndence and your
humanity by working for peace:
no position is too high, no title too
impressive, to prevent a man from
joining in Ihe cause of humanity,
from working for our common
hope, peace.
Will you risk your reputation
for peace? Will you sacrifice an
hour, a day, even ten minutes, to
make a public demonstration of
your concern about the vitiating
effects of the war, both abroad
and at home? I hope you will, I
am confident you will. Please?
I would be more than

overjoyed to discuss any questions
you may have. I believe that we,
you and I, can reason together. I
may be, in your eyes, only a
student, but I am also a human
being deeply upset by the
slaughter and waste of lives in
Vietnam.
Again, I am totally serious in
this invitation. I will call at your
office to learn your response.
Help us, help yourself, help the
cause of man.
Yours sincerely,
E. NicholasSelby

I would be greatly honored if
on would join me in distributing
leaflets at the Stanford shopping
enter at noon. I am sure you will
find nothing objectionable in the
leaflets: they suggest President
Nixon's "Vietnaniization" plans
are hopeless and that, far from
decreasing, the scope of the war is
daily increasing.

For Dr. Pitzer, you are
president of one of the leading
private universities in this
country. Your past statements
about the need to end "secret
research, the need to reorder this
nation's priorities, and the need to
end the draft and establish a
volunteer army have received wide
publicity and attention.
Any actions you lake now,
when the peace movement seems
to have lost the life it had last fall,
will be doubly important, first
because act ions always mean more
than speeches, and second because
the simple act of leafletfiiig will
indicate that one of the important
"liberal" presidents has not yet
given up hope about the public's
ability to influence foreign policy.
Ih> Not Despair!
Most of all, I believe we cannot
allow ourselves the comfort and
luxury of despair. We must insist
on keeping faith that wars can be
ended, that the Pentagon does not
have to control our destiny, that

men can someday live in harmony
and peace.
Sometimes I fear we will never
see an end to the Vietnam
debacle. But this does not mean
we can stop trying to end the war.
You have spoken often about
the need for responsible dissent,
the kind of protest that does not
lead to irrational window
smash ings but leads instead to
rational dialogue and human
understanding. 1 believe that your
helping distribute leaflets will
indicate your desire to work for
peace without becoming irrational
or petulant.
The "Enemy's Strength
We face a gigantic enemy
within our own midst: The
Pentagon and war industry
businessmen, some of whom
employ you as president of
"their," as they would have
students believe, university. As I
guess you are aware from the
recent controversy over
reinstating KOTC programs at
Stanford, these men are able to
apply fantastic amounts of
pressure to get their way, to see
that their interests are placed
above and before those of
everyone else.
We cannot believe that one
protest march in Washington, one
day of national rallies, will
influence them. They have told us
up to now that they will not be
influenced by what we, or any
part of the American people, do.
How long do you think they can
afford not to listen? Surely, not
forever. However, much patient
work awaits us.
It may take us years, decades
even, if we survive that long, to
change the direction in which this
nation is being lead by Mr. Nixon,
the Pentagon generals, and the
aerospace indusi rialists.
In the end, however, we will
succeed, for our cause is right and
just: peace and equality among
ALL men. We need only believe,
only have faith, and the yoke of
working for peace will become
easy, the burden of dissenting will
become light.
Free oneself!
Your help leaflet ting may serve
to inspire and, indeed, to free
other college presidents in

situations much like yours. I am
"pin;? you will attempt to assert
your in •j > ndence and your
humanity by working for peace:
no position is too high, no title too
impressive, to prevent a man from
joining in Ihe cause of humanity,
from working for our common
hope, peace.
Will you risk your reputation
for peace? Will you sacrifice an
hour, a day, even ten minutes, to
make a public demonstration of
your concern about the vitiating
effects of the war, both abroad
and at home? I hope you will, I
am confident you will. Please?
I would be more than

overjoyed to discuss any questions
you may have. I believe that we,
you and I, can reason together. I
may be, in your eyes, only a
student, but I am also a human
being deeply upset by the
slaughter and waste of lives in
Vietnam.
Again, I am totally serious in
this invitation. I will call at your
office to learn your response.
Help us, help yourself, help the
cause of man.
Yours sincerely,
