## Fear And ROTC 
### Diarmuid McGuire 
The peculiar thing about the
situation at Stanford this springs
that no one seems to he in favor
of the war in Vietnam or of
military training at the University.
Individuals and members
liberal or conservative groups who
have defended ROTC' have never
taken a stand in favor of
economic and military expansion
by the United States in Asia or
anywhere else.
They have said that 1) they do
not necessarily see any connection
between the ROTC program and
Vietnam or imperialism 2) even if
ROTC were done away with, the
war would probably continue, 3)
students would be free to choose
military training just as they are
free to choose courses in literature
or nuclear physics, and 4) it is
better to have liberally educated
college graduates in the army than
less humanistic products of service
academies and Officer Candidate
School.
It is not necessary to list the
responses to these arguments. The
point is that men are being
prepared at Stanford to kill
Vietnamese and other citizens of
the Third World for the ultimate
profit of big corporations, and
that it does not matter to the
victim whether the executioner
cherishes life and liberal values.
Even liberals should not be free to
choose murder and exploitation,
(itiiiim ii it it y \ s. KOTC
But if most members of this
community are against ROTC,
and if the support for ROTC rests
on such weak logic why is ROTC
still here?
We have learned the answer in
the past week. ROTC is being
maintained at Stanford by the
threat and use of naked force.
E} c o nomic c o m p u Is i on
combined with manipulation and

various kinds of threats, was used
to reverse the faculty's decision of
last spring. It is only necessary to
remember that the Defense
Depaitment has an annual budget
of about $80 billion in order to
understand why Stanford's
academics were blown out of the
way like so much dandilion fluff.
Physical Violence
But now we know that dollars
and jeopardized careers are not
the ultimate weapons in the
arsenal of the establishment.
When the people took the only
path left and marched to the
ROTC offices last Tuesday and
Wednesday nights, they met
physical violence.
Windows are not the issue.
Windows were broken before and
after the police attacked. But any
sane person would agree that if all
the windows at Stanford could be
traded for the life of one
Vietnamese or one American, it
would be a bargain.
The fact is that police are
beating, macing and arresting
people on the Stanford campus.
They are doing these things so
that young men can train at
Stanford to gas, arrest, torture
and kill other people in Vietnam.
Many Afraid
Many of those who oppose
ROTC at Stanford are now afraid
to take action. And rightly so. It
is sensible to be afraid of being
maced. beaten and arrested.
But this fear must be overcome
in one way or another if ROTC is
going to be eliminated.
Reactionaries often force
people to overcome fear. In
Chicago and Berkeley, at schools
like San Francisco State and
Cornell the system has backed
people up against the wall and
given them no choice but to fight.
Administrators Keeping Cool
At Stanford, the
administration and the powers
behind the administration are
keeping cool. They are using
violence quickly and selectively.
And they are offering to the
Movement the choice between
acting and facing a real fight or
doing nothing and being safely
ineffectual.
We have to make a choice in
the next few days. But no matter
what happens, we have been given
a valuable insight. Now we know
that, although David Packard and
Smiley Ken Pitzer make decisions,
they do not have any power or
legitimacy of their own. They
have to depend on drafted or
hired mercenaries, whether it is
the Army or a squad of Santa
Clara County goons wearing ski
masks and field jackets.
In the short run, this kind or
surrogate power must be taken
into account. But in the end, it is
no power at all.

violence quickly and selectively.
And they are offering to the
Movement the choice between
acting and facing a real fight or
doing nothing and being safely
ineffectual.
We have to make a choice in
the next few days. But no matter
what happens, we have been given
a valuable insight. Now we know
that, although David Packard and
Smiley Ken Pitzer make decisions,
they do not have any power or
legitimacy of their own. They
have to depend on drafted or
hired mercenaries, whether it is
the Army or a squad of Santa
Clara County goons wearing ski
masks and field jackets.
In the short run, this kind or
surrogate power must be taken
into account. But in the end, it is
no power at all.
The peculiar thing about the
situation at Stanford this springs
that no one seems to he in favor
of the war in Vietnam or of
military training at the University.
Individuals and members
liberal or conservative groups who
have defended ROTC' have never
taken a stand in favor of
economic and military expansion
by the United States in Asia or
anywhere else.
They have said that 1) they do
not necessarily see any connection
between the ROTC program and
Vietnam or imperialism 2) even if
ROTC were done away with, the
war would probably continue, 3)
students would be free to choose
military training just as they are
free to choose courses in literature
or nuclear physics, and 4) it is
better to have liberally educated
college graduates in the army than
less humanistic products of service
academies and Officer Candidate
School.
It is not necessary to list the
responses to these arguments. The
point is that men are being
prepared at Stanford to kill
Vietnamese and other citizens of
the Third World for the ultimate
profit of big corporations, and
that it does not matter to the
victim whether the executioner
cherishes life and liberal values.
Even liberals should not be free to
choose murder and exploitation,
(itiiiim ii it it y \ s. KOTC
But if most members of this
community are against ROTC,
and if the support for ROTC rests
on such weak logic why is ROTC
still here?
We have learned the answer in
the past week. ROTC is being
maintained at Stanford by the
threat and use of naked force.

combined with manipulation and

various kinds of threats, was used
to reverse the faculty's decision of
last spring. It is only necessary to
remember that the Defense
Depaitment has an annual budget
of about $80 billion in order to
understand why Stanford's
academics were blown out of the
way like so much dandilion fluff.
Physical Violence
But now we know that dollars
and jeopardized careers are not
the ultimate weapons in the
arsenal of the establishment.
When the people took the only
path left and marched to the
ROTC offices last Tuesday and
Wednesday nights, they met
physical violence.
Windows are not the issue.
Windows were broken before and
after the police attacked. But any
sane person would agree that if all
the windows at Stanford could be
traded for the life of one
Vietnamese or one American, it
would be a bargain.
The fact is that police are
beating, macing and arresting
people on the Stanford campus.
They are doing these things so
that young men can train at
Stanford to gas, arrest, torture
and kill other people in Vietnam.
Many Afraid
Many of those who oppose
ROTC at Stanford are now afraid
to take action. And rightly so. It
is sensible to be afraid of being
maced. beaten and arrested.
But this fear must be overcome
in one way or another if ROTC is
going to be eliminated.
Reactionaries often force
people to overcome fear. In
Chicago and Berkeley, at schools
like San Francisco State and
Cornell the system has backed
people up against the wall and
given them no choice but to fight.
