A pungent briefcase of
marijuana seized by police in a
Meyer library locker, January
1969, does not exist in the eyes of
the State Court of Appeal.
The grass was declared
inadmissable evidence in the case
of John Lanthier, its former
owner, because the officers did
not secure the proper search
warrant.
The contents of the case had
been discovered when the reeking
odor of its preservative attracted
the attention of the building
superintendent, who opened the
locker. Dissenting in the 2 lo 1
decision, associate justice Harold
Brown contended that the police

i.ui;, iin'iitificd the grass after the
employees had legally discovered
it.
Lanthier was arrested by a
stakeout of Santa Clara deputies
when he came to the locker.
Although he did not deny the
dope was his, he argued his
constitutional rights had been
violated by university's search,
and the police intervention
without a search warrant.
The arrest last year prompted
campus debate concerning the
action of outside police on
campus, and the ambiguity ol the
university's policy on drugs.
Lanthici had previously been
