## Revolution In The Head 
### Wayne Kemp 
Peace for the hell of it! Abbie didn't say it, but
I think that we can all feel it.
However, violent revolution in the streets
would not be Woodstock Nation in White Plaza. It
would be Vietnam in the streets, hate in the head,
and power manipulation politics.
It is very true that the acts of violence involved
in breaking campus windows and burning Bank of
America branches are insignificant when compared
to the magnitude of the South East Asia thing. But
the militaristic altitudes involved arc frighteningly
comparable. Persons who immerse themselves in
the politics of hate and in violent confrontation
tactics are developing within themselves many of
the same attitudes which they are opposing in the
present system. If they succeed in overthrowing
the established military complex via guerrilla
warfare, destruction, street fighting, and other
militaristic methods, it will be because they will
have become a more effective military force than
their opposition. This can only happen if they
levelop minds which are at least equally
militaristie as those they confront.
The military mind is capable of intense loyalty
to its comrades in arms, but it must also make
it.se 11 insensitive to the suffering of any whose
existence hampers the Cause. This attitude can be
seen in both the minds of soldiers at My Lai and
the bomb making revolutionaries in New York. If
in the process of creating a "better" society the
creators become militaristic animals, then why
bother?
World W nr I
Arguments stating that only violent methods
can bring down the injustices of our society and

eventually replace them with a world of love and
peace and freedom, have the familiar ring of World
W;ir I propaganda. In 1918 we fought what
President Wilson called "the war to end all wars,"
the war which was to "make the world safe for
democracy."
The only peace which militarism has ever led to
has been either the peace of realignment, while
preparations are made for future war, or the
"peace" of repression, such as the Reign of Terror
after the French Revolution.
"Revolution for the hell of it" is an existential
attitude which has a great deal of merit. It means
that (he revolutionary process in and of itself must
be a good tiling, independent of its ultimate goals.
A revolution of this nature must be primarily one
of attitudes and values. It must involve the
creation of greater awareness, concern, and love. It
is a better thing to gamble that a reoriented
personal life style, combined with peaceful tactics,
will bring about desired changes in society, than to
develop a life style and tactics which are
intrinsically bad, but which might lead to good
results. A Machiavellian attitude may be
appropriate for traditional wars and power grabs,
but it has no place in an idealistic struggle to
change values and eliminate suffering, repression,
and hale.
Phil Ochs has stated that "in such an ugly time
the true protest is beauty." It can be added that in
a hale filled time, the true protest is love.
