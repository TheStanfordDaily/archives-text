# Probe A3M History At 'Party'
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
The successes of shortcomings
of last year's April 3rd Movement
(A3M) were discussed Friday in
an A3M "Birthday Party" at the
Clubhouse.
Participating in the discussion,
sponsored by B'nai B'rith Hillel,
were Harry Cleaver, of the staff of
the Pacific Studies Center, Fred
Cohen an A3M leader, and Hans
Anderson, a member of the
Stanford Research Institute (SKI)
Research Committee.
The A3M was a coalition of
groups opposed to classified and
war-related research on campus
and at SRI. It officially formed
into a movement on last April 3,
then started a nine-day sit-in at
the Applied Electronics Lab
(AEL) six days later.
The speakers discussed the
immediate and long-range effects
of the A3M and what has
happened since the protests ended
in late May, after demonstrations
at the SRI Hanover St. facility.
Work Continues
Cleaver noted that while a
A3M did damage SRI, it is still
doing the same type fo work as
last year. "It's important to keep
in mind," he stressed, "that the
issues from last year. . .still go
undiscussed."
He saw that, in terms of
research, the A3M had been
successful in getting some people
out of SRI, in accentuating their
financial problems, and in
stopping some military research
on campus.
Cleaver said, however, that
since the end of last year's

protests SRI has been allowed "to
heal its wounds." He added he felt
there had been a "negligible"
effect on SRI in the long run.
He claimed, referring to the
war-related research criticized last
year, that "all this continues;
nothing has changed."
4 Shen aniguiis' (ion tin ue
Silence about SRI since last
year, he said, has allowed the
facility, now separated from the
university, to keep up its
"corporate shenanigans."
"It's very important that
people understand," Cleaver
noted, that research within the
"same vicious institution"
continues in "a cold, calculated,
methodical way."
Cohen stressed the broader
aspects of the A3M and added
what he thought were some of its
failings.
He said that students saw last
year an "example of the truth"
that the American university
serves the ruling class. Referring
to Stanford as "an elite
university," he claimed that it is
"an important part of a larger
political and economic system."
Cohen said he viewed the A3M
protests as a clash between the
ruling class and institutions like
Stanford and the combined
efforts of the youth and anti-war
movements.
Planning Noted
As far back as October, 1968,
he said, there was an organized
campaign of action and education
of the community on the question
of war-related research.
Between that time and the
more militant actions later in the
year, there came the growth of
what he called "one of the most
sophisticated" of any anti-war
movement in the country.
The position of the A3M was
not just to rid the university of
the research, but to eliminate it
entirely and then control the
institutions. "Purification" of the
university was not the issue, and
this, Cohen said, "showed a
changing conception of the
university."
'Fear' Claimed
One of the problems of the
A3M, he claimed, developed out
of a "fear of the ASM leadership"
that it would lose the support of
liberal elements.

The radical leadership was
"afraid to lay out one of the basic
questions," he said. That question
dealt with power and its use.
Cohen said there was an
"inability of the movement to
exert its full potential" and noted
"we never fully challanded them
(the university.)"
"The main reason the April
Third Movement had as little
effect that it did was the fact thai
the movement maintained itself as
a protest movement." "The
attack," he said, "could have gone
to the ideological function of the
university."
"We should have related the
fact that Stanford is an imperialist
university," Cohen noted. People
then could have been moved to
question the kind of education
they are getting.

He claimed that "people were
not willing to spend the time and
take the risk that could have been
possible" in achieving the group's
demands. "We never had the
opportunity to use the ultimate
weapon," (i.e., mobilizing the
students into a strike).
Anderson said the "only
concrete success of the A3M" was
to "eliminate classified research
on campus." During the AEL
sit-in, the Faculty Senate voted to
ban all classified research on
campus through a series of
resolutions.

Anderson claimed that this
move wouldn't have been taken
without a .sit-in. He noted,
however, that the language of the
resolution dealt with the secrecy
of the research and not the moral
aspects of it that concerned the
A3M.
Molality Klein ilia It'll
It is a "mistake to think" he
said, that the faculty, in voting
against classified research, voted
for the morality reasons of the
A3M.
Saying that the faculty was
"reluctant to legislate morality,"
Anderson claimed that the
resolution would not have passed
had it been phrased in terms of
the morality of research.
In a question session with the
approximately 30 people present,
Colin noted sharp differences
between the A3M and the recent
protests against ROTC. "There is
a tendancy to confuse militancy
with radicalism," he said, and
noted that the ROTC protestors
have not been working all year to
educate the community on the
issue.
All three panelists agreed that
the A3M, especially the length of
the AEL sit-in, was "unique."
Cleaver claimed that it will
"eventually be necessary to
destroy the university," since he
"can't forsee" that the right
people will have enough money to
support a radical institution of
Stanford's size.

immediate and long-range effects
of the A3M and what has
happened since the protests ended
in late May, after demonstrations
at the SRI Hanover St. facility.
Work Continues
Cleaver noted that while a
A3M did damage SRI, it is still
doing the same type fo work as
last year. "It's important to keep
in mind," he stressed, "that the
issues from last year. . .still go
undiscussed."
He saw that, in terms of
research, the A3M had been
successful in getting some people
out of SRI, in accentuating their
financial problems, and in
stopping some military research
on campus.
Cleaver said, however, that
since the end of last year's

protests SRI has been allowed "to
heal its wounds." He added he felt
there had been a "negligible"
effect on SRI in the long run.
He claimed, referring to the
war-related research criticized last
year, that "all this continues;
nothing has changed."
4 Shen aniguiis' (ion tin ue
Silence about SRI since last
year, he said, has allowed the
facility, now separated from the
university, to keep up its
"corporate shenanigans."
"It's very important that
people understand," Cleaver
noted, that research within the
"same vicious institution"
continues in "a cold, calculated,
methodical way."
Cohen stressed the broader
aspects of the A3M and added
what he thought were some of its
failings.
He said that students saw last
year an "example of the truth"
that the American university
serves the ruling class. Referring
to Stanford as "an elite
university," he claimed that it is
"an important part of a larger
political and economic system."
Cohen said he viewed the A3M
protests as a clash between the
ruling class and institutions like
Stanford and the combined
efforts of the youth and anti-war
movements.
Planning Noted
As far back as October, 1968,
he said, there was an organized
campaign of action and education
of the community on the question
of war-related research.
Between that time and the
more militant actions later in the
year, there came the growth of
what he called "one of the most
sophisticated" of any anti-war
movement in the country.
The position of the A3M was
not just to rid the university of
the research, but to eliminate it
entirely and then control the
institutions. "Purification" of the
university was not the issue, and
this, Cohen said, "showed a
changing conception of the
university."
'Fear' Claimed
One of the problems of the
A3M, he claimed, developed out
of a "fear of the ASM leadership"
that it would lose the support of
liberal elements.

The radical leadership was
"afraid to lay out one of the basic
questions," he said. That question
dealt with power and its use.
Cohen said there was an
"inability of the movement to
exert its full potential" and noted
"we never fully challanded them
(the university.)"
"The main reason the April
Third Movement had as little
effect that it did was the fact thai
the movement maintained itself as
a protest movement." "The
attack," he said, "could have gone
to the ideological function of the
university."
"We should have related the
fact that Stanford is an imperialist
university," Cohen noted. People
then could have been moved to
question the kind of education
they are getting.

He claimed that "people were
not willing to spend the time and
take the risk that could have been
possible" in achieving the group's
demands. "We never had the
opportunity to use the ultimate
weapon," (i.e., mobilizing the
students into a strike).
Anderson said the "only
concrete success of the A3M" was
to "eliminate classified research
on campus." During the AEL
sit-in, the Faculty Senate voted to
ban all classified research on
campus through a series of
resolutions.

Anderson claimed that this
move wouldn't have been taken
without a .sit-in. He noted,
however, that the language of the
resolution dealt with the secrecy
of the research and not the moral
aspects of it that concerned the
A3M.

It is a "mistake to think" he
said, that the faculty, in voting
against classified research, voted
for the morality reasons of the
A3M.
Saying that the faculty was
"reluctant to legislate morality,"
Anderson claimed that the
resolution would not have passed
had it been phrased in terms of
the morality of research.
In a question session with the
approximately 30 people present,
Colin noted sharp differences
between the A3M and the recent
protests against ROTC. "There is
a tendancy to confuse militancy
with radicalism," he said, and
noted that the ROTC protestors
have not been working all year to
educate the community on the
issue.
All three panelists agreed that
the A3M, especially the length of
the AEL sit-in, was "unique."
Cleaver claimed that it will
"eventually be necessary to
destroy the university," since he
"can't forsee" that the right
people will have enough money to
support a radical institution of
Stanford's size.
The successes of shortcomings
of last year's April 3rd Movement

there had been a "negligible"
effect on SRI in the long run.
He claimed, referring to the
war-related research criticized last
year, that "all this continues;
nothing has changed."

Silence about SRI since last
year, he said, has allowed the
facility, now separated from the
university, to keep up its
"corporate shenanigans."
"It's very important that
people understand," Cleaver
noted, that research within the
"same vicious institution"
continues in "a cold, calculated,
methodical way."
Cohen stressed the broader
aspects of the A3M and added
what he thought were some of its
failings.
He said that students saw last
year an "example of the truth"
that the American university
serves the ruling class. Referring
to Stanford as "an elite
university," he claimed that it is
"an important part of a larger
political and economic system."
Cohen said he viewed the A3M
protests as a clash between the
ruling class and institutions like
Stanford and the combined
efforts of the youth and anti-war
movements.
Planning Noted
As far back as October, 1968,
he said, there was an organized
campaign of action and education
of the community on the question
of war-related research.
Between that time and the
more militant actions later in the
year, there came the growth of
what he called "one of the most
sophisticated" of any anti-war
movement in the country.
The position of the A3M was
not just to rid the university of
the research, but to eliminate it
entirely and then control the
institutions. "Purification" of the
university was not the issue, and
this, Cohen said, "showed a
changing conception of the
university."
'Fear' Claimed
One of the problems of the
A3M, he claimed, developed out
of a "fear of the ASM leadership"
that it would lose the support of
liberal elements.

The radical leadership was
"afraid to lay out one of the basic
questions," he said. That question
dealt with power and its use.
Cohen said there was an
"inability of the movement to
exert its full potential" and noted
"we never fully challanded them
(the university.)"
"The main reason the April
Third Movement had as little
effect that it did was the fact thai
the movement maintained itself as
a protest movement." "The
attack," he said, "could have gone
to the ideological function of the
university."
"We should have related the
fact that Stanford is an imperialist
university," Cohen noted. People
then could have been moved to
question the kind of education
they are getting.

He claimed that "people were
not willing to spend the time and
take the risk that could have been
possible" in achieving the group's
demands. "We never had the
opportunity to use the ultimate
weapon," (i.e., mobilizing the
students into a strike).
Anderson said the "only
concrete success of the A3M" was
to "eliminate classified research
on campus." During the AEL
sit-in, the Faculty Senate voted to
ban all classified research on
campus through a series of
resolutions.

Anderson claimed that this
move wouldn't have been taken
without a .sit-in. He noted,
however, that the language of the
resolution dealt with the secrecy
of the research and not the moral
aspects of it that concerned the
A3M.

It is a "mistake to think" he
said, that the faculty, in voting
against classified research, voted
for the morality reasons of the
A3M.
Saying that the faculty was
"reluctant to legislate morality,"
Anderson claimed that the
resolution would not have passed
had it been phrased in terms of
the morality of research.
In a question session with the
approximately 30 people present,
Colin noted sharp differences
between the A3M and the recent
protests against ROTC. "There is
a tendancy to confuse militancy
with radicalism," he said, and
noted that the ROTC protestors
have not been working all year to
educate the community on the
issue.
All three panelists agreed that
the A3M, especially the length of
the AEL sit-in, was "unique."
Cleaver claimed that it will
"eventually be necessary to
destroy the university," since he
"can't forsee" that the right
people will have enough money to
support a radical institution of
Stanford's size.
The successes of shortcomings
of last year's April 3rd Movement
(A3M) were discussed Friday in
an A3M "Birthday Party" at the
Clubhouse.
Participating in the discussion,
sponsored by B'nai B'rith Hillel,
were Harry Cleaver, of the staff of
the Pacific Studies Center, Fred
Cohen an A3M leader, and Hans
Anderson, a member of the
Stanford Research Institute (SKI)
Research Committee.
The A3M was a coalition of
groups opposed to classified and
war-related research on campus
and at SRI. It officially formed
into a movement on last April 3,
then started a nine-day sit-in at
the Applied Electronics Lab
(AEL) six days later.
The speakers discussed the
immediate and long-range effects
of the A3M and what has
happened since the protests ended
in late May, after demonstrations
at the SRI Hanover St. facility.
Work Continues
Cleaver noted that while a
A3M did damage SRI, it is still
doing the same type fo work as
last year. "It's important to keep
in mind," he stressed, "that the
issues from last year. . .still go
undiscussed."
He saw that, in terms of
research, the A3M had been
successful in getting some people
out of SRI, in accentuating their
financial problems, and in
stopping some military research
on campus.
Cleaver said, however, that
since the end of last year's

protests SRI has been allowed "to
heal its wounds." He added he felt
there had been a "negligible"
