# Black Belts Teach Defense
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
With at least three or four
unsolved rapes having been
committed on campus this year,
Stanford coeds have become quite
naturally concerned about their
safety.
In an attempt to lesson the
threat of attack, the University
has sponsored self-defense films
from the sheriff's department and
most recently installed an
experimental light system along
Palm Drive, the scene of most of
the attacks.
Now possibly the best safety
precaution, a thorough class in
self-defense is being organized by
five Stanford students, who call
themselves the Black Belt
Association. What separates these
five from other students is that
they are five of the 255 black belt
karate experts in the United
States.
PASSPORTS (OH JOY!)
The Stanford I) ai I > Passport
Service resumes operation
Monday, April 6. This quarter we
are open Monday through Friday
1 pm to 3 pm. You do not need
an appointment. Call (only) ex.
4631 in the evenings for info.

The leader and highest ranking
of the five is Jerry Offstein, head
of the Political Union Board and a
graduate student in political
science. Offstein is the holder of a
third degree black belt in
Taekwon-Do. He will be assisted
by four other black belts.
The class, which is being
co-sponsored by the Womens'
Recreation Association, will have
its first introductory meeting
today at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The course will
probably be limited to 25 women.
Following the opening meeting,
meetings will bo held in the
Women's PE Department,
probably on Monday and
Thursday. Both PE and SWOPSI
credit will be available for the
course, according to Offstein.
Combat Danger
Offstein said that the class was
organized because the five felt
that "they could help by offering
their services to help combat a
clear and present danger." Their
only reservation was that they
might possibly demean their
martial arts, but they felt the
beneficial effects would largely
outweigh this.

Offstein states that any women
who takes the course "will within
six weeks be able to defend
herself adequately against a
potential attacker." The
instruction will be almost all
defensive and will include some
instruction in a couple of martial
arts including karate, judo, aikido,
yawara.
Free Course
Undoubtedly the best feature
of the class will be the fact there
will be no cost. Although there
are private schools in this area,
they are all quite expensive and,
according to Offstein, there are
none he knows of with an
accredited black belt on their
staff. And he also says that "When
there is a black belt on a staff, the
instruction rates usually double."
If the class proves successful,
Offstein said attempts will be
made to organize a summer course
for Stanford female employees.
Offstein is hopeful that there will
be a good turnout for today's
meeting because he feels that this
class could really help combat the
assault problem and would be
infinitely more valuable than
other safety precautions now
used.
