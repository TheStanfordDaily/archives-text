# This Week's Films
## 'If...', Ulysses On Tap 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Six different, film series offer
movies ranging from "If,"
possibly one of the best films to
be shown on campus this quarter
and "Ulysses," a soporific piece of

celluloid matched only by
Warhol's "Sleep."
Tonight Funky Films will
present three short films at 7 and
9 in Cubberly. "The Grateful
Dead" by Robert Nelson ("Dem
Watermelons") is, in the director's
works, "A psychedelic film"
depicting The Grateful Dead in
action at the Fillmore and
recording studios.
"Freaks," a 1932 film by the
Edgar Allan Poe of the cinema,
Tod Browning ("Dracula," "Mark
of the Vampire") stars the
deformed members of a circus. A
film like this has never beenmade
before and hopefully will never be
made again. Also featured on the
Funky Films program is
"Barbershop" with W.C. Fields.
Frosh Films
Tuesday, April 7, Clive's Frosh
Films offer two 1939 classics
starting at 7:45 in Geology 320.
The first show is "Four Feathers"
directed by Zoltan Korda and
starring Ralph Richardson, C.
Aubrey Smith, John Clements,
and June Duprez.
The second feature at 10 is
"The Story of Vernon and Irene
Castle." This musical was directed
by H.C. Potter and stars the
dynamic dancing duo of Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers.
Wednesday, April 8, the second
of six programs of the Kinetic Art
Films will be shown at Bishop
Auditorium at 7 :30 and 9:30. The
programs consist of a diverse
group of animated, experimental
documentary, and dramatic short
films, representing the latest
achievements in creative cinema
by film makers from Europe,
Japan, and the United States.
"It. . ."and revolution
Also on Wednesday, Beta Chi
will present "If" at 7, 9, and 11 in
Cubberly. Set at a British public
school (the equivalent of an
American prep school), "If" is a
fusion of documentary naturalism
and adolescent fantasy about the
violent overthrow of authority.

"My sympathies," says Lindsey
Anderson the director, "are
always with the revolutionaries
But then, you must define what
revolution is because you can
make a revolution by making a
film, just as much as by shooting
somebody. Maybe better."
For anyone finding symbolic
meaning for the sequences filmed
in sepia and black and white,
Anderson explained that they
were included, not for the sake of
symbolism, but rather were a
financial necessity. An excellent
film, "If" presents a timeless
comment, not only on the British
public school system, but also on
the crisis confronting American
universities today, (Stanford take
note.)
"The Young and the Damned"
is being presented by the
International Association this
Thursday at 7:45 in Cubberly.
Luis Bunuel ("Un Chien
Andalou," "Simon of the Desert,"
"Belle de Jour") directed this
drama of a desperate
poverty-haunted youth. This film
is one of Bunuel's best.
Friday Films
Friday, April 10, Erich von
Stroheim's "Foolish Wives" will
be shown at 7, 8, and 9 at
Tresidder. Sophisticated sex,
seduction and intrigue are all
elements of this story of a
dissatisfied wife, an obtuse
husband and an immoral officer.
A refreshing look at life and love.
The same evening Beta Chi is
showing "Ulysses" at 7, 9:30 and
12 in Dinkelspiel. The film is a
horrendous adaptation of a
brilliant literary work. The
photography is second-rate, the
music dull, and the direction
unimaginative. Even acceptable
performances by Milo O'Shea os
Bloom and Barbara Jefford as
Molly fail to save this film from
being a disaster. "Ulysses makes
some sense if you've read the
book, but is only confusing and
boring if you haven't.
