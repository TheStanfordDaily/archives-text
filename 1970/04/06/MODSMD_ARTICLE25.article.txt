# Speedy Bruins Burn Indians
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
As thirty-odd UCLA tracksters
were leaving Stanford Stadium
Saturday afternoon with a 90-64
victory under their belts, one
figure stood out. With his track
shoes in a plastic bag over one
shoulder and an Adidas travel bag
over the other, Wayne Collett
looked much like the other Bruins
clad in their bright blue and gold
warmup suits.
With the exception of his gold
Adidas tennis shoes, Collett was
no different than the other
runners. Except for the fact he is
one of the finest collegiate
runners in the nation. In fact his
coach, Jim Bush calls him "the
greatest all-around collegiate
runner in the country."
On Saturday, slowed by a virus
infection, Collett ran an easy 48.4
good for second in the 440 and he

coasted in on the anchor of the
Bruins victorious 440 relay squad.
He didn't even compete in the
220 and 440 hurdles in which he
was favored, as Bush had decided
to rest him in preparation for next
week's meet with Washington
State.
Aimless
When I asked Collett about his
immediate plans, he had no idea
of what he would run in this
year's NCAA's. He said he had no
idea of what he'd run and being as
versatile as he is, he could easily
run in any of four events.
He has run a 45.2 440, a 50.0
440 hurdles, a 20.7 220, a 9.5 100
and a 14.7 120HH. In last year's
nationals, he was fourth in the
220 and anchored the Bruins
national champion mile relay
team (3:03.4).
He also ran on their

non-placing 440 relay team which
ran a school record 39.6.
Indicative of his great versatility is
the fact he was "College
Freshman Track Athlete ol
1968."
After discussing immediate
plans I couldn't resist the
temptation of asking Collett if he
had any future plans to follow in
the Bob Hayes-Tommie
Smith-John Carlos vein and take a
shot at pro football.
At 6-2 and 180 Collett looks
like he couldn't miss, but we may
never find out. Collett said, "I am
not a football player. I do not
want to be a professional athlete
and be bought and sold. I am
nobody's property but my own."
When I asked him if this also ruled
out any possible professional
track, Collett emphatically said,
"Yes!"
Retire in '7 2
Wayne is a junior political
science major and he says he'll
probably go to graduate business
school. He wants to run in the
1972 Olympics but he says he'll
retire in '72 even if he doesn't
make the Olympics. After school
he doesn't know what he wants to
do. But far as personable and
intelligent a person as Collett is, I
don't think he'll have any more
trouble doing well in what he
wants to do than he has had on
the track.
As Collett faded back into
momentary anonymity among a
sea of blue and gold aboard a grey
and green chartered bus, Payton
Jordan and "his boys" were
heading back for the warm
showers of a friendly lockeroom.
UCLA had never really been
challenged, but Jordan in his
bright red blazer said he was
proud of his team. They had come
up with some fine performances
and at least made it interesting for
5000 sun-baked track enthusiasts.
Bruins Burn
The Indians swept the two mile
and the 440 intermediate hurdles
and took one-two in the mile and
the 120 yard high hurdles.
Following those two one-two
finishes, the Cards only trailed
27-32 but then UCLA turned on
their awesome sprint power and
swept the 440, 100 and 220 to
put it out of reach.
Particularly impressive for the
Indians were the performances of
Rick Tipton, Jim Kauffman,
Casey Carrigan, and Allen
Meredith. Tipton came off a
couple of injuries and won the

high hurdles with a good opening
time of 14.3.
Kauffman made his debut after
a fantastic rugby season and long
jumped 23-7'/4 and ran the 440 in
49.3. Carrigan fought off his
mononucleosis troubles and
finally cleared 16 feet in the pole
vault while Meredith upset
UCLA's Denny Rogers with a
40-11 Vi triple jump.
Carrigan's vault was a Stanford
freshman record as was Rod
Utley's 48-6'/t triple jump. The
only meet record to be broken
was the steeplechase where
Stanford's Brook Thomas ran a
9:09.0. Next weekend Payton
Jordan, his red blazer and "his
boys" travel to Corwallis to take

on Oregon State in another Hac-H
dual meet.

put it out of reach.
Particularly impressive for the
Indians were the performances of
Rick Tipton, Jim Kauffman,
Casey Carrigan, and Allen
Meredith. Tipton came off a
couple of injuries and won the

high hurdles with a good opening
time of 14.3.
Kauffman made his debut after
a fantastic rugby season and long
jumped 23-7'/4 and ran the 440 in
49.3. Carrigan fought off his
mononucleosis troubles and
finally cleared 16 feet in the pole
vault while Meredith upset
UCLA's Denny Rogers with a
40-11 Vi triple jump.
Carrigan's vault was a Stanford
freshman record as was Rod
Utley's 48-6'/t triple jump. The
only meet record to be broken
was the steeplechase where
Stanford's Brook Thomas ran a
9:09.0. Next weekend Payton
Jordan, his red blazer and "his
boys" travel to Corwallis to take

on Oregon State in another Hac-H
dual meet.

blazes through the 120 high hurdles
Saturday, winning that event with a
time of 14.3, coming of minor injuries
thai hampered him last week.

ANOTHKR FIRST—One of the Tribe's most consistent point getters has been
triple jumper Alan Meredith, shown here winning that event Saturday with a mark
of 50-11 3 4. The Indians did better than expected, but still fell 90-64.
As thirty-odd UCLA tracksters
were leaving Stanford Stadium
Saturday afternoon with a 90-64
victory under their belts, one
figure stood out. With his track
shoes in a plastic bag over one
shoulder and an Adidas travel bag
over the other, Wayne Collett
looked much like the other Bruins
clad in their bright blue and gold
warmup suits.
With the exception of his gold
Adidas tennis shoes, Collett was
no different than the other
runners. Except for the fact he is
one of the finest collegiate
runners in the nation. In fact his
coach, Jim Bush calls him "the
greatest all-around collegiate
runner in the country."
On Saturday, slowed by a virus
infection, Collett ran an easy 48.4
good for second in the 440 and he

coasted in on the anchor of the
Bruins victorious 440 relay squad.
He didn't even compete in the
220 and 440 hurdles in which he
was favored, as Bush had decided
to rest him in preparation for next
week's meet with Washington
State.
Aimless
When I asked Collett about his
immediate plans, he had no idea
of what he would run in this
year's NCAA's. He said he had no
idea of what he'd run and being as
versatile as he is, he could easily
run in any of four events.
He has run a 45.2 440, a 50.0
440 hurdles, a 20.7 220, a 9.5 100
and a 14.7 120HH. In last year's
nationals, he was fourth in the
220 and anchored the Bruins
national champion mile relay
team (3:03.4).
He also ran on their

non-placing 440 relay team which
ran a school record 39.6.
Indicative of his great versatility is
the fact he was "College
Freshman Track Athlete ol
1968."
After discussing immediate
plans I couldn't resist the
temptation of asking Collett if he
had any future plans to follow in
the Bob Hayes-Tommie
Smith-John Carlos vein and take a
shot at pro football.
At 6-2 and 180 Collett looks
like he couldn't miss, but we may
never find out. Collett said, "I am
not a football player. I do not
want to be a professional athlete
and be bought and sold. I am
nobody's property but my own."
When I asked him if this also ruled
out any possible professional
track, Collett emphatically said,
"Yes!"
Retire in '7 2
Wayne is a junior political
science major and he says he'll
probably go to graduate business
school. He wants to run in the
1972 Olympics but he says he'll
retire in '72 even if he doesn't
make the Olympics. After school
he doesn't know what he wants to
do. But far as personable and
intelligent a person as Collett is, I
don't think he'll have any more
trouble doing well in what he
wants to do than he has had on
the track.
As Collett faded back into
momentary anonymity among a
sea of blue and gold aboard a grey
and green chartered bus, Payton
Jordan and "his boys" were
heading back for the warm
showers of a friendly lockeroom.
UCLA had never really been
challenged, but Jordan in his
bright red blazer said he was
proud of his team. They had come
up with some fine performances
and at least made it interesting for
5000 sun-baked track enthusiasts.
Bruins Burn
The Indians swept the two mile
and the 440 intermediate hurdles
and took one-two in the mile and
the 120 yard high hurdles.
Following those two one-two
finishes, the Cards only trailed
27-32 but then UCLA turned on
their awesome sprint power and
swept the 440, 100 and 220 to
put it out of reach.
Particularly impressive for the

year's NCAA's. He said he had no
idea of what he'd run and being as
versatile as he is, he could easily
run in any of four events.
He has run a 45.2 440, a 50.0
440 hurdles, a 20.7 220, a 9.5 100
and a 14.7 120HH. In last year's
nationals, he was fourth in the
220 and anchored the Bruins
national champion mile relay
team (3:03.4).
He also ran on their

non-placing 440 relay team which
ran a school record 39.6.
Indicative of his great versatility is
the fact he was "College
Freshman Track Athlete ol
1968."
After discussing immediate
plans I couldn't resist the
temptation of asking Collett if he
had any future plans to follow in
the Bob Hayes-Tommie
Smith-John Carlos vein and take a
shot at pro football.
At 6-2 and 180 Collett looks
like he couldn't miss, but we may
never find out. Collett said, "I am
not a football player. I do not
want to be a professional athlete
and be bought and sold. I am
nobody's property but my own."
When I asked him if this also ruled
out any possible professional
track, Collett emphatically said,
"Yes!"
Retire in '7 2
Wayne is a junior political
science major and he says he'll
probably go to graduate business
school. He wants to run in the
1972 Olympics but he says he'll
retire in '72 even if he doesn't
make the Olympics. After school
he doesn't know what he wants to
do. But far as personable and
intelligent a person as Collett is, I
don't think he'll have any more
trouble doing well in what he
wants to do than he has had on
the track.
As Collett faded back into
momentary anonymity among a
sea of blue and gold aboard a grey
and green chartered bus, Payton
Jordan and "his boys" were
heading back for the warm
showers of a friendly lockeroom.
UCLA had never really been
challenged, but Jordan in his
bright red blazer said he was
proud of his team. They had come
up with some fine performances
and at least made it interesting for
5000 sun-baked track enthusiasts.
Bruins Burn
The Indians swept the two mile
and the 440 intermediate hurdles
and took one-two in the mile and
the 120 yard high hurdles.
Following those two one-two
finishes, the Cards only trailed
27-32 but then UCLA turned on
their awesome sprint power and
swept the 440, 100 and 220 to
put it out of reach.
Particularly impressive for the
Indians were the performances of
Rick Tipton, Jim Kauffman,
Casey Carrigan, and Allen
Meredith. Tipton came off a
couple of injuries and won the

high hurdles with a good opening
time of 14.3.
Kauffman made his debut after
a fantastic rugby season and long
jumped 23-7'/4 and ran the 440 in
49.3. Carrigan fought off his
mononucleosis troubles and
finally cleared 16 feet in the pole
vault while Meredith upset
UCLA's Denny Rogers with a
40-11 Vi triple jump.
Carrigan's vault was a Stanford
freshman record as was Rod
Utley's 48-6'/t triple jump. The
only meet record to be broken
was the steeplechase where
Stanford's Brook Thomas ran a
9:09.0. Next weekend Payton
Jordan, his red blazer and "his
boys" travel to Corwallis to take

on Oregon State in another Hac-H
dual meet.

ANOTHKR FIRST—One of the Tribe's most consistent point getters has been
triple jumper Alan Meredith, shown here winning that event Saturday with a mark
of 50-11 3 4. The Indians did better than expected, but still fell 90-64.
As thirty-odd UCLA tracksters
were leaving Stanford Stadium
Saturday afternoon with a 90-64
victory under their belts, one
figure stood out. With his track
shoes in a plastic bag over one
shoulder and an Adidas travel bag
over the other, Wayne Collett
looked much like the other Bruins
clad in their bright blue and gold
warmup suits.
With the exception of his gold
Adidas tennis shoes, Collett was
no different than the other
runners. Except for the fact he is
one of the finest collegiate
runners in the nation. In fact his
coach, Jim Bush calls him "the
greatest all-around collegiate
runner in the country."
On Saturday, slowed by a virus
infection, Collett ran an easy 48.4
good for second in the 440 and he

coasted in on the anchor of the
Bruins victorious 440 relay squad.
He didn't even compete in the
220 and 440 hurdles in which he
was favored, as Bush had decided
to rest him in preparation for next
week's meet with Washington
State.
