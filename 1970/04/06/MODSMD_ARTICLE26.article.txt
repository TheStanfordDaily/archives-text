# Grand Slams Dump Spartans

### FRED LEESON 
Steve Dunning, if you'll pardon
the cliche, did it all in Stanford's
Saturday baseball sweep of San
Jose State at Sunken Diamond.
He saved the first game with a
monumental four-run homer in
the fifth inning which landed
somewhere on the soccer field and
left local fanatics claiming it must
have gone 415 feet, even longer
than a 400 footer he hit at
Riverside.
He won the second game on
the mound, hurling a five hit
victory with 16 strikeouts,
bringing his average for a nine
inning game up to 12.
He drove in Stanford's first run
in the second game with triple off
the fence, and then scored what
proved to be the winning run.
He also made three errors in
one inning in the first game, but
we won't mention that.
Brute power did what finesse
couldn't as Stanford took the first
game 9-7, and the second was a
close duel for seven innings until a
six-run outburst ran the final
score up to 8-1.
Don Schellenberg blasted San
Jose out of the finale with the
Tribe's second grand-slam of the
afternoon, a 355 foot shot to left
which ended the six run rally, all
scored after two men were out.
Phil Keller hurled the first
game, giving up five earned runs in
seven innings, walking two and
striking out seven as he stretched
his record to 5-2.
But it wasn't easy.
The beer was hardly out of
the ice chest in the top of the first
before the Spartans were up 3-9,
and Stanford helped the San Jose
side with a number of errors, of
which only four were the kind

that can be kept in a scorebook.
The Indians struck back with
three in the third on walks to
Keller and Phil Kelber and singles
by Dave Edson and Mike Ewing
and a Wild pitch, but the Spartans
upped their lead to 7-3 as Tom
McLachlan belted a two-run
homer to left in the fourth.
Kelber and Ewing rapped
singles again in the fifth and Mike
Nelson waited out a walk to load
the bases for Dunning, who then
bludgeoned a 2-2 pitch outa sight.
Keller stymied the visitors for
the final three innings and drove
home the winning run in the
sixth, scoring Bob Marshall, who
had arrived at third via a walk, a
wild pitch and a fielder's choice,
with a fly ball to right.
Sandy Swanson tallied the final
Indian run as he got caught in a
rundown between third and the
plate when somebody missed a
signal, and was sent home on an
interference call.

Edson and Ewing were 2-4 in
the first game and Dunning was 3
for 3.
Dunning and San Jose's Bob
Grover battled each other for four
and a half scoreless innings in the
second game before Dunning
waited out a slow curve and
bounced a triple off the right field
screen to highlight Stanford's
two-run fifth.
San Jose picked up its run in
the sixth as Gary Cunningham
drilled a single up the middle .

score McLachlan who had gone to
third after a double.
Dunning was in control from
there on (he's now 8-1), and
Ewing's single in the seventh
drove in two just before
Schellenberg smashed his grand
slam.
The Indians face UOP and St.
Mary's on the road next week
before opening the Pac-8 season
against Cal next Saturday in
Berkeley.
