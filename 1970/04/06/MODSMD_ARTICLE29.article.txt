# TV Set For 11th Game
## 
### 
Stanford's 11th football game
of the 1970 season, against
Arkansas Sept. 12 in Little Rock,
will be televised nationally,
American Broadcasting Company
president Roone Arledge
announced yesterday.
ABC's two-year package made
public Sunday includes 11
national telecasts and 24 regional
showings, costing the network
$12 million each season in rights
paid to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA).
The Associated Press says it has
learned that each school involved
in the nation-wide sportcasts will
receive $205,000.
Stanford Athletic Director
Chuck Tayior and Bob Murphy,
sports information director, where
unavailable for comment.
The NCAA approved addition
of an 11th game to college
football schedules specifically as a
revenue-increasing agent to

combat rising costs. Television
revenue would be an addition to
actual game profits.
The Stanford-Arkansas game,
which will open the television
slate, is the first of four night
games to be beamed nation-wide.
Other Pac-8 teams signed for the
ABC series include UCLA and
USC who will face each other

Nov. 21.
Arledge made the official
announcement at a convention of
the National Association of
Broadcasters, ending weeks of
speculation. Informed sources
told the Daily that actual game
selections had been made by the
television network as early as the
end of January, however.
