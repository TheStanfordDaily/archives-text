# Newer Left For The 70's Moves To Hardened Ideology
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL (First In A Series) 
The radical movement in 1970
is not what it was in 1969, either
at Stanford or anywhere else in
the nation.
Bombs in New York buildings
and town houses, fires in
California banks, and broken
windows in Stanford buildings
have proven this.
Many radicals see sit-ins and
marches as the "old" tactics and
small-scale guerrilla actions as the
"new." The "New Left" is
retreating and a harder
ideologically-oriented "Left" is
gaining strength.
Shattering Change
Tom Hay den tells us that the
"Conspiracy 7" trial was the
attempt of the "dinosaurs of the
19ft0's to keep the 1960's from
becoming the 1970'5." And the
shattering of Stanford glass
heralds what may be the arrival of
Hayden's '70's.
There are visible differences
between April 1969 April 1970.
Last year Stanford radicals
organized a mass movement

against SRI in a year-long
propaganda campaign.
More than 1000 students
attended the Dinkelspiel meeting
that decided to sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory,
and most of them participated in
seizing the building. That the first
demonstrations last Spring would
be non-violent was never in doubt.
This year, however, the
propaganda campaign has been
spotty. No more than 200 to 300
participated in the first two nights

involved the ultimate goal of "The
Revolution" than talk of the more
immediate goal of removing
ROTC from campus.
Two Factors
These differences between last
year's and this year's
demonstrations arise from two
factors: 1) the different problems
that caused the actions, and 2) the
changed radical mind.
The first of these is important
and often overlooked. Last year,
the decision on SRI had been
made at the time of the first
demonstrations. For this reason
its purpose was to influence the
impending decision.
Irreversible Decision
This year however, the final
decision has been reached. As one
radical said, "The faculty has
reversed itself once, but it can't
do it 1 wice."
So, demonstrating against a
decision that is practically
■speaking, irreversible, radicals
cannot help but question the
effectiveness of non-violent mass
movement. To many the realities
of the situation dictate destructive
tactics that will make ROTC
unviable for the Army.
The other factor that has led to
such different demonstrations this
year has been the state (if radical
thought.
During the past year most
activists have devoted a good deal
of their time to ideological
debates within the movement. In
many ways this has been a year
for radicals to develop their
revolutionary idenlily.
That identity is still forming,
however, and it would be
simplistic to categorize all radicals
as contained within the
newly-forming bundle of beliefs.
The radical movement is not a
unitary whole. It is rankled by
ideological disputes about tactics
and immediate goals whieh will be
discussed in a second part of this

The radical movement in 1970
is not what it was in 1969, either
at Stanford or anywhere else in
the nation.
Bombs in New York buildings
and town houses, fires in
California banks, and broken
windows in Stanford buildings
have proven this.
Many radicals see sit-ins and
marches as the "old" tactics and
small-scale guerrilla actions as the
"new." The "New Left" is
retreating and a harder
ideologically-oriented "Left" is
gaining strength.
Shattering Change
Tom Hay den tells us that the
"Conspiracy 7" trial was the
attempt of the "dinosaurs of the
19ft0's to keep the 1960's from
becoming the 1970'5." And the
shattering of Stanford glass
heralds what may be the arrival of
Hayden's '70's.
There are visible differences
between April 1969 April 1970.
Last year Stanford radicals
organized a mass movement

against SRI in a year-long
propaganda campaign.
More than 1000 students
attended the Dinkelspiel meeting
that decided to sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory,
and most of them participated in
seizing the building. That the first
demonstrations last Spring would
be non-violent was never in doubt.
This year, however, the
propaganda campaign has been
spotty. No more than 200 to 300
participated in the first two nights

involved the ultimate goal of "The
Revolution" than talk of the more
immediate goal of removing
ROTC from campus.
Two Factors
These differences between last
year's and this year's
demonstrations arise from two
factors: 1) the different problems
that caused the actions, and 2) the
changed radical mind.
The first of these is important
and often overlooked. Last year,
the decision on SRI had been
made at the time of the first
demonstrations. For this reason
its purpose was to influence the
impending decision.
Irreversible Decision
This year however, the final
decision has been reached. As one
radical said, "The faculty has
reversed itself once, but it can't
do it 1 wice."
So, demonstrating against a
decision that is practically
■speaking, irreversible, radicals
cannot help but question the
effectiveness of non-violent mass
movement. To many the realities
of the situation dictate destructive
tactics that will make ROTC
unviable for the Army.
The other factor that has led to
such different demonstrations this
year has been the state (if radical
thought.
During the past year most
activists have devoted a good deal
of their time to ideological
debates within the movement. In
many ways this has been a year
for radicals to develop their
revolutionary idenlily.
That identity is still forming,
however, and it would be
simplistic to categorize all radicals
as contained within the
newly-forming bundle of beliefs.
