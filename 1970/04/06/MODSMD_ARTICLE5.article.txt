# Demonstrators Invade Movie, Move On Academic Council
## 
### ED KOHN 
About 140 anti-ROTC
demonstrators briefly occupied
pari of the Physics Tank (phi 00)
Friday afternoon in an attempt to
hold a verbal confrontation with
members of the Academic Council
meeting there.
After President Pitzer asked
University Public Safety Director
Dan DeYoung to read a standing
court injunction banning campus
disruptions, the demonstrators
filed out of the building singing
"We Shall Overcome" and
chanting "Off ROTC."
Friday night, for the fourth
evening in a row, the protestors,
numbering about 175, marched to
the ROTC building. The
demonstration was held after a
9:30 p.m. mass meeting in the Old
Union courtyard. No damage was
reported during the peaceful
protest, and the three busloads of
Santa Clara County sheriffs
deputies standing by behind the
Fire Department were not called
to the scene.
On its way to the ROTC
building, the group also disrupted
the 10 o'clock showing of
.'ean-Luc Godard's "One Plus
One" ("Sympathy for the Devil")

in an attempt to gain additional
support for the march. But the
moviewatchers were content to
stay in Dinkelspiel, and the
demonstrators, gaining only one
or two recruits, left the building
and continued to ROTC
headquarters, object of the march.
IN o Parly al ROTC
In disrupting "One Plus One,"
the demonstrators entered
Dinkelspiel by a side door, turned
on some lights, and stood on the
stage, shouting and gesturing to
the crowd. After several minutes,
the management of the movie
decided that it would offer a free
midnight showing of the film in
hopes of getting the
demonstrators to leave. However,
the demonstrators had already
started to file out seeing that they
were gaining no support from the
movie-goers.
When the group arrived at the
ROTC building, it met for several
minutes to decide on a course of
action for the rest of the evening,
since it had voted earlier al the
mass meeting not to make such a
decision until it arrived at the
ROTC building. After deciding
not to hold a sit-in, someone,
apparently a Menlo College

student, produced a keg ot beer,
and despite the lack of a pump,
the group decided to hold a party
outside the building.
As the main meeting was
taking place, a small group
gathered around Prof. Bruce
Franklin, who charged earlier
during the Council meeting that
plainclothes "members of the San
Jose Tac Squad" had beaten a
student during the demonstrations
Wednesday night and tha he
personally had been sprayed in
the face with an irritating
substance.
Rt>quests Reports
Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig, who was one of
about four faculty members
gathered around Franklin, said
that demonstrators with similar
complaints should file written,
detailed statements of the
incidents with the Provost's
office.
The party never got off the
ground, and after milling around
in front of the building for half an
hour, the group decided to split
back up into affinity groups and
to hold smaller parties, watch the
free showing of "One Plus One"
or go to bed.
The demonstrators moved off
slowly, and the area was quiet
again by midnight. At 12:15 a.m.,
the only sign of a demonstration
was an affinity group sitting near
Tresidder singing "Solidarity
Forever."
I I Affinity Groups
A large portion of the
demonstrators Friday night were
high school students. At one
point, early in the evening, a

group of 40 arrived together and
silt down as a group. Later on, it
was estimated that one-third of
the demonstrators were high
school students.
Pig's Handshake
Earlier in the day, about 3:30
p.m., some 150 protestors
marched to the Physics Tank, and
most went straight through the
front doors after being warned
that the Academic Council
meeting was not open to students
and that they would be in
violation of the University's
disruption policy.
Heavily photographed, the
marchers entered phi 00. Most
took seats near the back, although
several groups took seats near a
microphone located near the
center of the room. Occasionally a
chant or shout would be started
by one of the affinity groups,
whose members were sitting
together.
A cheer went up as a student
wearing a paper-mache mask of a
pig's head went to the front of the
room, attempted to shake Pitzer's
hand, and sat down next to a
security officer and put his arm
around him.
Faculty Reacts
As the students sang, "You
Can't Always Get What You
Want," a few professors drifted
into the room. Most remained
standing on a platform near the
middle of- the Tank, looking
puzzled or angry.
Lennie Siegel attempted to call
the meeting to order, explaining
that Pitzer, who was present in
the room, was sick. He was greet
by repeated cries of "You're
awfully funny" and "Come on"
by enraged faculty members
sitting on the right side of the
room.
Then Pitzer declared that "The
meeting is a closed one . . . for
faculty and academic staff only."
He asked the students to leave the
room and offered to meet with
them after the formal meeting was
concluded.
Ovation for Injunction
Siegel then asked "General
Pitzer" why the meeting was
closed. Pitzer explained that the
Council determines its own rules
and that "this campus has many
mechanisms of communication."
Pitzer then declared that the
demonstrators were "in violation
of the campus disruption policy."
His words were met by a standing
ovation from the demonstrators.
After leaving the meeting the
protestors met for about 45
minutes while the Academic
Council was in session to attempt
to determine policy for the next
several days. They considered, at
length, proposals that included a
return to the Council meeting and

a possible sit-in, a take-over at the
ROTC building, and a sit-in at
Encina. Eventually the protestors,
who then numbered 200, decided
to hold the mass meeting in the
Old Union courtyard.
Prof. Lincoln E. Moses, Dean
of the Graduate Division, was
invited to address the group on
the steps, but stopped after beini;
verbally abused by a few, notably
Janet Weiss. He stayed outside the
Tank, talking with a few of the
demonstrators in a small group,
until the Council adjourned.
Discussions on Slrps
Near the end of the meeting,
SLAC Prof. Pierre Noyes came
outside and said that the Council
had voted to allow three
representatives from the
demonstration to address the
Council for a total of 15 minutes.
A discussion began, and Prof.
Bruce Franklin emerged from the
Council to announce that the
fifteen minutes had already
started to elapse l . The
demonstrators continued their
discussion, and the Council
adjourned for lack of business.
The Movement will meet again
at 8 o'clock tonight in the Old
Union courtyard.
