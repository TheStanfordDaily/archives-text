# Restraint, Firmness Win Faculty Praise
## 
### 
The Academic Council Friday
gave a standing vote of confidence
to President Kenneth Pitzer,
Provost Richard Lyman and
faculty leaders, commending them
"for their restraint combined with
firmness in dealing with violent
actions of the past week."
Most of the 200 faculty
members present at the meeting,
earlier disrupted by anti-ROTC
demonstrators, stood indicating
their support when the resolution
was introduced by William E.
Spicer, professor of electrical
engineering.
Near the end of the meeting
the faculty voted on the
recommendation of SLAC
Professor Pierre Noyes, to invite
three spokesmen from the
anti-ROTC demonstrators
gathered outside the Physics Tank
to talk to the faculty for a total of
15 minutes.
The demonstrators, after
discussion, rejected the proposal
overwhelmingly.
Pitzer Interrupted
Earlier in the meeting when
Pitzer commended the Santa Clara

County Police for their help in
combating demonstrators on
campus. English professor Bruce
Franklin interrupted Pitzer and
shouted, "You obviously weren't
there to see four police beat a
student."
After letting Pitzer finish his
general remarks, Franklin claimed
that Wednesday night, a
demonstrator standing next to
him was jumped by four
plainclothes police and severely
beaten. Franklin said, "When I
went to help him, I was maced at
close range." He said that he has
not yet recovered physically.
Thomas Ehrlich, professor of
law, then said that he had not
seen the incident (he was present
at the protests) and that he had
not heard of it from anyone else
who was present.
Restrained Reaction
Ehrlich said the police "reacted
with restraint, extreme caution
and care," according to everything
he had seen and heard.
Franklin defended himself
"Since Prof. Ehrlich in effect is
calling me a liar," and said the
person beaten was Chuck Noble
and that Diarmuid McGuire was a
witness.
He explained how people
became revolutionaries and
referred to himself and the
anti-ROTC demonstrators as "the
ones who have been beaten all
over this country . . ."
In his informal remarks to the
faculty group, Pitzer said it was
"only good luck" that the large
stones that have been thrown have
not injured anyone. He said the
cost of the physical damage to
University property due to the
demonstrations is at least $8,000.
"Only when faculty and staff
regard those acts as intolerable
will they stop," he continued.
Pitzer said coercive factors are
being used to overturn a decision
achieved through democratic
means and in light of the great
efforts that have been made in the
last two years to integrate faculty
and students in decision making
processes.
ROTC and Vietnam
Pharmacology Professor Avram
Goldstein tied the events of the
last few days to the Vietnam War.
He said that the demonstrators
were attacking ROTC because it is
"the tangible symbol of the
military on this campus."
And, although he did not
advocate violence, he said that
"the breaking of a few windows is
nothing compared to what this
country is doing every day in
Southeast Asia."
Pitzer responded to this by
saying that "We have to be ready
to distinguish between them
(ROTC and Vietnam) .. ." and
that you cannot put blame on
something that is only remotely
related to it.
