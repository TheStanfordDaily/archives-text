# On ASSU Ballot
## DAILY Initiative 
### 
The Stanford Daily filed
petitions yesterday asking that
students vote on a $1 per student
per quarter special assessment to
help fund next year's publication.
More than 900 students had
signed the petitions to place the
question on the April 15-16
ballot. Six hundred signatures
must be submitted to the ASSU
office by 5 o'clock this afternoon
to put any initiatives to a vote.
The April 15-16 election was
scheduled to determine how much
students will pay for ASSU
programs next year, and to elect
an ASSU president, senior class
officers, and members of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC).
Petitions to run for these
offices must also be submitted to
the ASSU office by 5 o'clock.
ASSU and senior class officer
candidates need 40 signatures
each; SCLC candidates' petitions
require 25.
ROTC Poll
The student Senate has asked
that, in addition, students be
polled concerning credit for
ROTC and its existence on
campus.
Two other initiatives —asl per
quarter assessment for the Special
Events Board and a proposal to
make ASSU membership
voluntary are also expected to
appear on the ballot.
Presently all graduates and
undergraduates are automatically
members of ASSU and pay $3 of
each quarter's tuition to the
organization. Under the
constitution adopted last spring,
students choose how much they
want to give ASSU each quarter.
Dailv lt> I.aw
The new constitution also
elunuated a bvlaw which

automatically gave the Daily 85c
per student per quarter.
Money from tuition presently
furnishes about $28,000 or
one-fifth of the Daily's revenue,
according to business manager
Jeff Bonzon. Other expenses are
met with income from advertising.
The amount asked from
students has been increased to $1
to cover inflation since the 85c
by-law was passed several years
ago. It would also help build
financial reserves to cover costs of
overtime and special editions
during crisis situations, such as
last spring's demonstrations
Drastic Reduction
If the Daily receives no money
from students, Bonzon explained,
the number and size of issues
would have to be drastically
reduced.
Student Financial Manager
David Swift reported that present
ASSU programs, excluding the
Daily, cost $58,000 per year. The
rest of the money is used for basic
ASSU operations to pay office
staff, etc.
Beginning next fall, the
University will pay $90,000 pet
year for office expenses. For one
year only, it will also provide
$34,000 in program funds.
Students will be voting for
program fees above $34,000. To
provide a total amount equal to
the student Senate's program
budget this year, students would
have to assess themselves $3.25 to
$3.50 per quarter.
Under the new constitution,
special assessments do not receive
the same treatment as ASSU
program funds. Half of all
program fees are automatically set
aside for divisional
a s soci a t i on s — de part mental
organizations which students may
form
