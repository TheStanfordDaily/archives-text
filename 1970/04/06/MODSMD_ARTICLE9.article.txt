# Off-ROTC Tactics
## Violence? 
### Larry Diamond 
The events of the first week of
spring quarter have inspired
heated pointed out
varying analysis by a number of
factions at the University.
Several issues are at stake: the
existence of a tool of the Defense
Department on campus which is
teaching Stanford students how to
make war; the ability of the
University administration to
reverse the spirit and letter of a
faculty decision, after being
pressured by outside forces; and,
finally, the tactics that have been
chosen by some students and
ex-students, most of whom are
motivated by the highest
intentions, to force the removal of
ROTC from campus.
The origins of last week's
demonstrations lie in part in the
decision to restore partial credit
to ROTC courses. One year ago
the faculty voted 403-356 to deny
credit to ROTC courses,
sustaining an earlier Senate vote
of 2H-8. The effect of the vote
was to deal a quiet, if not
immediate, death sentence to
Stanford ROTC. The issue was
finally decided: no credit for
ROTC
But the Administration did not
treat the issue as decided. It
negotiated a contract for Army
ROTC that would allow course
credit, won its adoption in this
year's decidedly more
conservative Senate, and then
proceeded to push it through the
Academic Council. The Council
adopted the proposal by a margin
of only 17 votes, with more than
750 faculty members voting.
Significantly, the margin of
victory was provided by 24 ROTC
instructors and Administration
officials who, by Ihe nature of
their jobs, had no place taking
part in a faculty vote on this issue.
Inconclusive Vote
The closeness, indeed
inconclusiveness, of the faculty
vote must surely have surprised
even President Pitzer. But still, he
has won, and his victory, in its
negation of last year's vote by the
faculty, represents a most, serious
affront to the integrity of faculty
decision making power.
It represents an affront, also, to
the overwhelming feeling against
militarism manifested a year ago
by people of all ages in the
Stanford community. This
affront, this unresponsiveness, has
in a large way bred the
frustrations which lie behind the
cynicism, impatience, and
violence of the Off-ROTC
movement.
A second issue is the very

existence, especially with credit,
of ROTC at Stanford. ROTC is a
part of the military machine. It is
training students to give and obey
the orders that have slaughtered
hundreds of thousands of
Southeast Asians so that Thieu
and Ky and the military-industrial
complex might all go on
functioning very nicely. As it
exists today, ROTC is an
instrument of killing. As such it
runs counter to everything that a
university should stand for.

Yet the issue of ROTC on
campus is largely a symbolic one.
Only six Stanford freshman are
enrolled in Army ROTC. Ending
this program will do little to end
the war; nor will it significantly
challenge the "Pentagonism"
which Dr. George Wald has
described as bloodsucking our
society to death.
What the' ending of the ROTC
program at Stanford will do is
enable the University to assume a
more consistent moral stand
against war and militarism; it will
make Stanford a more real symbol
of the humanistic values which
are, ultimately, the only salvation
for our society—peace, love, and
lasting regard for the sacredness of
human life.
Which brings us to a discussion
of the third issue—the tactics of
the Off-ROTC movement. Many
in the movement believe that by
making it so costly for ROTC to
remain on campus—through
damage to the physical plant and
the tranquility of the campus
psyche —the administration will
capitulate and remove ROTC.
Thus, a continuous program of
terrorism is envisioned.
Revolutionary As.sumplions
The movement has been
infused with a number of
assumptions characteristic of
revolutionary thought. First, that
damage and destruction will not
be tolerated by the established
powers, and that the police will
appear the minute the first
window is smashed. Correct.
Second, that the confrontations
between radicals and police will
grow more bitter and bloody as
the destruction continues. Also
correct. Third, that as this tug of
war between radical left and
repressive right becomes more
vicious, the Stanford community
will grow increasingly more
polarized and angry. Correct
again.
But the fourth assumption is
not correct. The confidence that
the revolution will succeed is
foolish. Ultimatelv it will fail

because, by the nature o! its
tactics, il can only replace the
violence of American militarism
with another kind of violence, just
as inhuman, just as deadly.
The radicals naively believe that
as the repression and polarization
proceed, a revolutionary
conciousness will build amongst
the people which will provide the
popular support needed to tear
down the evil structure and bring
the revolution to fruition.
This view is logically and
historically inept. If it should
come to a choice between
violent revolution and
repression, the majority of the
people will choose repression, as
they have done in the past.
V iolcn
The question is not whether we
must have a revolution, but what
kind of revolution it will be. If we
succumb to violence, we will
defeat everything we are working
for. The idea that peace, love, and
life can be affirmed and
established through violent means
is hypocritical and senseless. The
precedent that is being established
which recognizes violence as an
acceptable method of redressing
grievances can only signal the
asphyxiation of the last vestiges of
a democratic society.
Violence will result in innocent
people being hurt. Violence will
alienate and anger a large
constituency that the anti-war
movement must capture if it is to
succeed. Violence will divide us at
a time when we cannot afford to
be divided.
Is the pursuit of what is largely
a symbolic issue worth tearing
down the University? Supporters
of the Off ROTC- tactics must
ponder this, realizing that by the
very fact that so much of the
Stanford community finds ROTC
so morally obnoxious, it will
eventually die of its own weight
here. They should consider the
alternatives of other anti-war
groups, which offer some real
hope of attacking militarism
effectively with non violent
means.
As John Lindsay pleaded
Friday, let us not "open up a new
frontier for bloodshed," lest we
fall victims to the same abhorrent
logic of that officer in Vietnam
who argued, "We had to destroy
the village in order to liberate it."

alternative anti-war action by
Moratorium Chairman John
Kramer will appear later this week
in the Daily.)
