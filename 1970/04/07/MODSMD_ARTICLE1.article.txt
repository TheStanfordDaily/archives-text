# Berkeley Bombers Gassed Frosh
## Stolen Axe Anniversary This Week 
### TOM GIVEN 
April 3, 1930, marked a milestone in local history - the
invention of chemical warfare in Berkeley.
Yes, the use of tear gas predates Sheriff Madigan, Clark
Kerr and even Ronald Reagan. For such an innovation, one
turned then as now to the problem-oriented souls of
Stanford.
The problem was not one of Vietnam or even Peoples Park
dimensions. The Stanford Axe, symbol of the Farm, had
been stolen during a baseball game in 1899. What members
of the Cardinal proposed to do was recover it.
N u m 1> e rs
Thus did the Immortal Twenty-One join the calvalcade of
history alongside such famed names as the Chicago Eight, the
New York Twenty-One, Oakland Seven, and the
Chuckwagon Nineteen.
Most of them were veterans - seasoned in previous failing
attempts to recover the Axe and Stanford's honor. In 1927.
one stalwart Indian actually carried the Axe into a Berkeley
bank. Unfortunately, he was followed by a band of
Californians, who - rather than serenading him - beat him and
retained the implement.
Injuries
The next year saw near-tragedy as a Cal guard fell upon
the weapon, saving it from rescue. He was cut, though not
too badly, and awarded a Purple Heart for his efforts.
Biding their time, the Immortal Twenty-One (which was
little more than an affinity group before the recapture), sat
out the 1929 season. Perhaps, what with Hoover on the
campaign trail, they had better things to do.
April Fools
They set their trap for the third of April, 1930, when Cal
scheduled a pep rally in the Greek Theatre. The Axe was
removed from its safe deposit box in the American Trust
Company for the occassion. The Immortal Twenty-One were
on hand as well.

They attended the rally, then waited f or th». mored ear
bearing the Axe to return to the bank. Posing as
photographers, they backed their car onto the sidewalk,
setting up equipment and casing the neighborhood.
As the car arrived, the "photographers" began to ask the
freshmen guarding the bank to pose for their pictures. Being
freshmen, they readily complied. With blinding flash from
an overloaded flash attachment, the Stanford raiders fell
upon the armored car, taking the Axe and melting into the
crowd.
Bombing in Berkeley
They then threw a tear gas bomb into the crowd, to
complete the chaos and cover their exit. The choking
freshman guard hurried into the bank to escape the fumes.
With the weapon hidden under an overcoat, they
regrouped in downtown Berkeley. l king a rented getaway car
(for tax purposes), they sped down 1 » Palo 4
Hitting speeds of 62 m.p.h. alonfc Teleg ivenue, they
accelerated to 73 m.p.h. through Oaklan aching a top
speed ol 86 m.p.h. near Fremont. Alameda County police
must have been having a convention, for not a cop (the word
"pig" still implied pork) was in sight.
Return
They returned to a welcome now reserved for astronauts
and members of the Conspiracy. For days afterwards they
were chased by newsmen and photographers, and mobbed by
students and alumni. To prove the Pitzer contention of
"times don't change," they were not welcomed by the
university bureaucracy - which refused to pay for the car
rental without the proper requisitions.
While Stanford cheered their exploits, Cal seethed in a
manner unmatched until Ronald Reagan's election. The next
morning saw this scathing editorial in the Daily Cal:
"Stanford is likely to wake up a different campus this
morning. The clever boys who stole the Ax may have
returned to paint the town red, but they might find the place
painted blue and gold before the night is over.

"Hate Stanford. Catch the euphony of that sentence, note
its essential accuracy. Hate Stanford. Repeat it over and over
in your mind; formulate it with your lips. Hate Stanford.
"UV have always had a notion as to the sort of people who
inhabit that godforsaken campus forty miles south, and our
notion u. tou> confirmed. The rally committee, though it
may have erred in allowing the armored ear to be too far in
advance of the scanty freshman guard, cannot be blamed for
being routed by the most carefully planned racketeer
robbery " local history. Stanford, despairing of an honest
burglary, imported Chicago methods. Tear bombs may be
fair play at Stanford, but that is Stanford. Hate Stanford.
"We are nurturing an especial animosity, and that is for
Stanford. And we won't be sorry if the Stanford boys find
their quad a deserted ruin this morning, and the campus
returned to the desert from which it came.
" 112 Stanford gets satisfaction out of this, then O.K. So do
we - out of hating Stanford."
Presidential Statement
The president of the UC Associated Students, John
Reynolds, echoed the sentiments, "California didn't exercise
enough precaution, we haven't feared Stanford enough, we
haven't hated her enough."
Little did he suspect that the fortieth anniversary of the
heist would find two of the Twenty-One actually residing in
Berkeley. Robson Taylor reports that he has had no
difficulty in the transition, "There are too many other
hostilities here." While not denying his innovative role in
Berkeley history, he notes that "as far as tear gas goes, we
were small potatoes compared to what's being done
nowadays."
No special festivities greeted the fortieth anniversary of
the return of the Axe. Members of the Immortal Twenty-One
spent the day going about their normal business. Stanford,
facing the newer versions of tear gas and the like, took no
official note. But then, neither did Berkeley.

Presidential Statement
The president of the UC Associated Students, John
Reynolds, echoed the sentiments, "California didn't exercise
enough precaution, we haven't feared Stanford enough, we
haven't hated her enough."
Little did he suspect that the fortieth anniversary of the
heist would find two of the Twenty-One actually residing in
Berkeley. Robson Taylor reports that he has had no
difficulty in the transition, "There are too many other
hostilities here." While not denying his innovative role in
Berkeley history, he notes that "as far as tear gas goes, we
were small potatoes compared to what's being done
nowadays."
No special festivities greeted the fortieth anniversary of
the return of the Axe. Members of the Immortal Twenty-One
spent the day going about their normal business. Stanford,
facing the newer versions of tear gas and the like, took no
official note. But then, neither did Berkeley.


ANNIVERSARY — II was forty years ago this week that the Stanford Axe,
seen here in front of the (Campanile, was recovered from the University of
California in a lightening: raid.
April 3, 1930, marked a milestone in local history - the
invention of chemical warfare in Berkeley.
Yes, the use of tear gas predates Sheriff Madigan, Clark
Kerr and even Ronald Reagan. For such an innovation, one
turned then as now to the problem-oriented souls of
Stanford.
The problem was not one of Vietnam or even Peoples Park
dimensions. The Stanford Axe, symbol of the Farm, had
been stolen during a baseball game in 1899. What members
of the Cardinal proposed to do was recover it.
N u m 1> e rs
Thus did the Immortal Twenty-One join the calvalcade of
history alongside such famed names as the Chicago Eight, the
New York Twenty-One, Oakland Seven, and the
Chuckwagon Nineteen.
Most of them were veterans - seasoned in previous failing
attempts to recover the Axe and Stanford's honor. In 1927.
one stalwart Indian actually carried the Axe into a Berkeley
bank. Unfortunately, he was followed by a band of
Californians, who - rather than serenading him - beat him and
retained the implement.
Injuries
The next year saw near-tragedy as a Cal guard fell upon
the weapon, saving it from rescue. He was cut, though not
too badly, and awarded a Purple Heart for his efforts.
Biding their time, the Immortal Twenty-One (which was
little more than an affinity group before the recapture), sat
out the 1929 season. Perhaps, what with Hoover on the
campaign trail, they had better things to do.
April Fools
They set their trap for the third of April, 1930, when Cal
scheduled a pep rally in the Greek Theatre. The Axe was
removed from its safe deposit box in the American Trust
Company for the occassion. The Immortal Twenty-One were
on hand as well.

They attended the rally, then waited f or th». mored ear
bearing the Axe to return to the bank. Posing as
photographers, they backed their car onto the sidewalk,
setting up equipment and casing the neighborhood.
As the car arrived, the "photographers" began to ask the
freshmen guarding the bank to pose for their pictures. Being
freshmen, they readily complied. With blinding flash from
an overloaded flash attachment, the Stanford raiders fell
upon the armored car, taking the Axe and melting into the
crowd.
Bombing in Berkeley
They then threw a tear gas bomb into the crowd, to
complete the chaos and cover their exit. The choking
freshman guard hurried into the bank to escape the fumes.
With the weapon hidden under an overcoat, they
regrouped in downtown Berkeley. l king a rented getaway car
(for tax purposes), they sped down 1 » Palo 4
Hitting speeds of 62 m.p.h. alonfc Teleg ivenue, they
accelerated to 73 m.p.h. through Oaklan aching a top
speed ol 86 m.p.h. near Fremont. Alameda County police
must have been having a convention, for not a cop (the word
"pig" still implied pork) was in sight.
Return
They returned to a welcome now reserved for astronauts
and members of the Conspiracy. For days afterwards they
were chased by newsmen and photographers, and mobbed by
students and alumni. To prove the Pitzer contention of
"times don't change," they were not welcomed by the
university bureaucracy - which refused to pay for the car
rental without the proper requisitions.
While Stanford cheered their exploits, Cal seethed in a
manner unmatched until Ronald Reagan's election. The next
morning saw this scathing editorial in the Daily Cal:
"Stanford is likely to wake up a different campus this
morning. The clever boys who stole the Ax may have

They attended the rally, then waited f or th». mored ear
bearing the Axe to return to the bank. Posing as
photographers, they backed their car onto the sidewalk,
setting up equipment and casing the neighborhood.
As the car arrived, the "photographers" began to ask the
freshmen guarding the bank to pose for their pictures. Being
freshmen, they readily complied. With blinding flash from
an overloaded flash attachment, the Stanford raiders fell
upon the armored car, taking the Axe and melting into the
crowd.
Bombing in Berkeley
They then threw a tear gas bomb into the crowd, to
complete the chaos and cover their exit. The choking
freshman guard hurried into the bank to escape the fumes.
With the weapon hidden under an overcoat, they
regrouped in downtown Berkeley. l king a rented getaway car
(for tax purposes), they sped down 1 » Palo 4
Hitting speeds of 62 m.p.h. alonfc Teleg ivenue, they
accelerated to 73 m.p.h. through Oaklan aching a top
speed ol 86 m.p.h. near Fremont. Alameda County police
must have been having a convention, for not a cop (the word
"pig" still implied pork) was in sight.
Return
They returned to a welcome now reserved for astronauts
and members of the Conspiracy. For days afterwards they
were chased by newsmen and photographers, and mobbed by
students and alumni. To prove the Pitzer contention of
"times don't change," they were not welcomed by the
university bureaucracy - which refused to pay for the car
rental without the proper requisitions.
While Stanford cheered their exploits, Cal seethed in a
manner unmatched until Ronald Reagan's election. The next
morning saw this scathing editorial in the Daily Cal:
"Stanford is likely to wake up a different campus this
morning. The clever boys who stole the Ax may have
returned to paint the town red, but they might find the place
painted blue and gold before the night is over.

"Hate Stanford. Catch the euphony of that sentence, note
its essential accuracy. Hate Stanford. Repeat it over and over
in your mind; formulate it with your lips. Hate Stanford.
"UV have always had a notion as to the sort of people who
inhabit that godforsaken campus forty miles south, and our
notion u. tou> confirmed. The rally committee, though it
may have erred in allowing the armored ear to be too far in
advance of the scanty freshman guard, cannot be blamed for
being routed by the most carefully planned racketeer
robbery " local history. Stanford, despairing of an honest
burglary, imported Chicago methods. Tear bombs may be
fair play at Stanford, but that is Stanford. Hate Stanford.
"We are nurturing an especial animosity, and that is for
Stanford. And we won't be sorry if the Stanford boys find
their quad a deserted ruin this morning, and the campus
returned to the desert from which it came.
" 112 Stanford gets satisfaction out of this, then O.K. So do
we - out of hating Stanford."
Presidential Statement
The president of the UC Associated Students, John
Reynolds, echoed the sentiments, "California didn't exercise
enough precaution, we haven't feared Stanford enough, we
haven't hated her enough."
Little did he suspect that the fortieth anniversary of the
heist would find two of the Twenty-One actually residing in
Berkeley. Robson Taylor reports that he has had no
difficulty in the transition, "There are too many other
hostilities here." While not denying his innovative role in
Berkeley history, he notes that "as far as tear gas goes, we
were small potatoes compared to what's being done
nowadays."
No special festivities greeted the fortieth anniversary of
the return of the Axe. Members of the Immortal Twenty-One
spent the day going about their normal business. Stanford,
facing the newer versions of tear gas and the like, took no
official note. But then, neither did Berkeley.


ANNIVERSARY — II was forty years ago this week that the Stanford Axe,
seen here in front of the (Campanile, was recovered from the University of
California in a lightening: raid.
April 3, 1930, marked a milestone in local history - the
invention of chemical warfare in Berkeley.
Yes, the use of tear gas predates Sheriff Madigan, Clark
Kerr and even Ronald Reagan. For such an innovation, one
turned then as now to the problem-oriented souls of
Stanford.
The problem was not one of Vietnam or even Peoples Park
dimensions. The Stanford Axe, symbol of the Farm, had
been stolen during a baseball game in 1899. What members
of the Cardinal proposed to do was recover it.
N u m 1> e rs
Thus did the Immortal Twenty-One join the calvalcade of
history alongside such famed names as the Chicago Eight, the
New York Twenty-One, Oakland Seven, and the
Chuckwagon Nineteen.
Most of them were veterans - seasoned in previous failing
attempts to recover the Axe and Stanford's honor. In 1927.
one stalwart Indian actually carried the Axe into a Berkeley
bank. Unfortunately, he was followed by a band of
Californians, who - rather than serenading him - beat him and
retained the implement.
Injuries
The next year saw near-tragedy as a Cal guard fell upon
the weapon, saving it from rescue. He was cut, though not
too badly, and awarded a Purple Heart for his efforts.
Biding their time, the Immortal Twenty-One (which was
little more than an affinity group before the recapture), sat
out the 1929 season. Perhaps, what with Hoover on the
campaign trail, they had better things to do.
April Fools
They set their trap for the third of April, 1930, when Cal
scheduled a pep rally in the Greek Theatre. The Axe was
removed from its safe deposit box in the American Trust
Company for the occassion. The Immortal Twenty-One were
on hand as well.
