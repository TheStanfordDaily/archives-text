# On Common Ground
## Ecology And Radicalism 
### Andy Smith 
In Monday's I>uil > , Brendan
Lynch pleaded for an attack upon
environmental issues that would
be executed independently, it
seemed, of Leftist political
movements. In the process, he
made an arbitrary separation of
the choices available for action:
that of those who are willing to
change superficially their life
styles, by employing such
methods as recycling of materials
and considering more carefully
the long-range consequences of
new products, and that of those
who attack the over all structure
of the system and culture in
which we live, by questioning, for
example, the way in which
Stanford land is used, or the
legitimacy of the institutions that
the University allows to flourish
on its campus.
This divison is very dangerous
to progress in solving ecological
problems, for it says, or at least
implies, that there are no common
goals of the two groups, no
common ground on which they
can work together. Ignorance of
this relationship is precisely the
point to which Lee Herzenberg
was trying to speak. Brendan says
that "no logical connections were
spelled out." It is not easy to do
this in a short article, and perhaps
all one can do is suggest that these
connections really do exist. For
example:
1) Stanford laud use — Lee
pointed out that many "people
who work and study at Stanford
can't- afford to live within a ten
mile radius." Is this not a clear,
direct outgrowth of University

policy toward land use, a policy
which has not met the needs of
the community? And as long as
people are forced to live great
distances from campus, and mass
transit is still unrealized, does
anyone think that the heavy use
of automobiles, leading to further
air pollution in the area, will not
continue? I leave it to the reader
to complete this connection,
linking Stanford land use policy
with people who "blame what's
happening to our world on
Stanford, or Dillingham."
2) "Oil ROTC" Movement — I
agree with Brendan that the
solution is not to "kick ROTC off
campus while we continue to
pollute the hell out of the
environment." But the crucial
question is not whether the first is
SUFFICIENT for preventing the
second, but whether it is
NECESSARY. That is, can we
adopt a saner environmental
policy within the framework of
our present economic system,
which entails a continuing
expansion of both consumers and
PER CAPITA consumption?
ROTC Is The Enemy
1, and some others, feel that
the ROTC program is one
important means by which this
economic framework is
reinforced, as it serves not only to
train persons to lead the fight
against insurgent movements
based on competing ideologies,
but also to instill in these same
people questionable values such as
blind obedience to authority, and
unquestioning servitude to
national goals. Whether others
agree with this line of thinking or
not, the presence at this
University of the ROTC program,
as a potential support for an
economic system that manifestly
has been unable to cope with
environmental problems, is

something tha ought to be
questioned in local discussions of
these problems.
I do agree with the implication
of Brendan's article that problems
dealing with the environmental
crisis go beyond the adoption of a
new economic system, for in fact,
no politico-economic structure of
our time, be it "capitalism,"
communism, or socialism, or some
mixture of these, has shown
evidence that it is able to solve
these problems. For that matter,
none of these systems, by itself,
has been able to guarantee an end
to the increasing alienation people
feel from their technology
dominated world.
So the issue is partly, as
Brendan says, "what are WE doing
to mess up the world." The way
in which we relate to ourselves, to
other people, and to our material
needs and desires, must be
criticized thoroughly, and to the
extent tha radicals as individuals
do not recognize that these are
failings of theirs, EVEN AS AND
AFTER THEY BECOME
POLITICALLY INVOLVED, as
well as of everyone else, the
political movement is weakened.
A Result of Upbringing
But these failings are, after all,
in large measure a result of the
type of society in which we have
grown up, and this society is
strongly influenced by the
economic structure of the

country. To attempt to make
personal and societal changes
without considering their
economic foundations is a
difficult game for even a
"liberated" student to play; for
most of the people in this
country, who as Brendan points
out, are far more dependent upon
the economic system, it is
impossible.
The real thrust of the radical
movement is not saying, or at
least 1 don't think it is saying,
"We have the answers to the
environmental crisis," for these
answers are partly technological,
and will require much hard work
and discussion by all of us who
are concerned. Rather, it is saying,
"The present economic system
does not, will not, cannot have
the answers, and therefore
productive discussion cannot
BEGIN until this system is
challenged."
This means that institutions
that are seen as props of this
system must be criticized. To the
extent that discussion of
environmental issues refuses to
address itself to these criticisms,
or even to acknowledge them, it
closes a door to the possibility of
change.

personal and societal changes
without considering their
economic foundations is a
difficult game for even a
"liberated" student to play; for
most of the people in this
country, who as Brendan points
out, are far more dependent upon
the economic system, it is
impossible.
The real thrust of the radical
movement is not saying, or at
least 1 don't think it is saying,
"We have the answers to the
environmental crisis," for these
answers are partly technological,
and will require much hard work
and discussion by all of us who
are concerned. Rather, it is saying,
"The present economic system
does not, will not, cannot have
the answers, and therefore
productive discussion cannot
BEGIN until this system is
challenged."
This means that institutions
that are seen as props of this
system must be criticized. To the
extent that discussion of
environmental issues refuses to
address itself to these criticisms,
or even to acknowledge them, it
closes a door to the possibility of
change.

In Monday's I>uil > , Brendan
Lynch pleaded for an attack upon
environmental issues that would
be executed independently, it
seemed, of Leftist political
movements. In the process, he
made an arbitrary separation of
the choices available for action:
that of those who are willing to
change superficially their life
styles, by employing such
methods as recycling of materials
and considering more carefully
the long-range consequences of
new products, and that of those
who attack the over all structure
of the system and culture in
which we live, by questioning, for
example, the way in which
Stanford land is used, or the
legitimacy of the institutions that
the University allows to flourish
on its campus.
This divison is very dangerous
to progress in solving ecological
problems, for it says, or at least
implies, that there are no common
goals of the two groups, no
common ground on which they
can work together. Ignorance of
this relationship is precisely the
point to which Lee Herzenberg
was trying to speak. Brendan says
that "no logical connections were
spelled out." It is not easy to do
this in a short article, and perhaps
all one can do is suggest that these
connections really do exist. For
example:
1) Stanford laud use — Lee
pointed out that many "people
who work and study at Stanford
can't- afford to live within a ten
mile radius." Is this not a clear,
direct outgrowth of University

policy toward land use, a policy
which has not met the needs of
the community? And as long as
people are forced to live great
distances from campus, and mass
transit is still unrealized, does
anyone think that the heavy use
of automobiles, leading to further
air pollution in the area, will not
continue? I leave it to the reader
to complete this connection,
linking Stanford land use policy
with people who "blame what's
happening to our world on
Stanford, or Dillingham."
2) "Oil ROTC" Movement — I
agree with Brendan that the
solution is not to "kick ROTC off
campus while we continue to
pollute the hell out of the
environment." But the crucial
question is not whether the first is
SUFFICIENT for preventing the
second, but whether it is
NECESSARY. That is, can we
adopt a saner environmental
policy within the framework of
our present economic system,
which entails a continuing
expansion of both consumers and
PER CAPITA consumption?
ROTC Is The Enemy
1, and some others, feel that
the ROTC program is one
important means by which this
economic framework is
reinforced, as it serves not only to
train persons to lead the fight
against insurgent movements
based on competing ideologies,
but also to instill in these same
people questionable values such as
blind obedience to authority, and
unquestioning servitude to
national goals. Whether others
agree with this line of thinking or
not, the presence at this
University of the ROTC program,
as a potential support for an
economic system that manifestly
has been unable to cope with
environmental problems, is

something tha ought to be
questioned in local discussions of
these problems.
I do agree with the implication
of Brendan's article that problems
dealing with the environmental
crisis go beyond the adoption of a
new economic system, for in fact,
no politico-economic structure of
our time, be it "capitalism,"
communism, or socialism, or some
mixture of these, has shown
evidence that it is able to solve
these problems. For that matter,
none of these systems, by itself,
has been able to guarantee an end
to the increasing alienation people
feel from their technology
dominated world.
So the issue is partly, as
Brendan says, "what are WE doing
to mess up the world." The way
in which we relate to ourselves, to
other people, and to our material
needs and desires, must be
criticized thoroughly, and to the
extent tha radicals as individuals
do not recognize that these are
failings of theirs, EVEN AS AND
AFTER THEY BECOME
POLITICALLY INVOLVED, as
well as of everyone else, the
political movement is weakened.
A Result of Upbringing
But these failings are, after all,
in large measure a result of the
type of society in which we have
grown up, and this society is
strongly influenced by the
economic structure of the

country. To attempt to make
personal and societal changes
without considering their
economic foundations is a
difficult game for even a
"liberated" student to play; for

crisis go beyond the adoption of a
new economic system, for in fact,
no politico-economic structure of
our time, be it "capitalism,"
communism, or socialism, or some
mixture of these, has shown
evidence that it is able to solve
these problems. For that matter,
none of these systems, by itself,
has been able to guarantee an end
to the increasing alienation people
feel from their technology
dominated world.
So the issue is partly, as
Brendan says, "what are WE doing
to mess up the world." The way
in which we relate to ourselves, to
other people, and to our material
needs and desires, must be
criticized thoroughly, and to the
extent tha radicals as individuals
do not recognize that these are
failings of theirs, EVEN AS AND
AFTER THEY BECOME
POLITICALLY INVOLVED, as
well as of everyone else, the
political movement is weakened.
A Result of Upbringing
But these failings are, after all,
in large measure a result of the
type of society in which we have
grown up, and this society is
strongly influenced by the
economic structure of the

country. To attempt to make
personal and societal changes
without considering their
economic foundations is a
difficult game for even a
"liberated" student to play; for
most of the people in this
country, who as Brendan points
out, are far more dependent upon
the economic system, it is
impossible.
The real thrust of the radical
movement is not saying, or at
least 1 don't think it is saying,
"We have the answers to the
environmental crisis," for these
answers are partly technological,
and will require much hard work
and discussion by all of us who
are concerned. Rather, it is saying,
"The present economic system
does not, will not, cannot have
the answers, and therefore
productive discussion cannot
BEGIN until this system is
challenged."
This means that institutions
that are seen as props of this
system must be criticized. To the
extent that discussion of
environmental issues refuses to
address itself to these criticisms,
or even to acknowledge them, it
closes a door to the possibility of
change.

In Monday's I>uil > , Brendan
Lynch pleaded for an attack upon
environmental issues that would
be executed independently, it
seemed, of Leftist political
movements. In the process, he
made an arbitrary separation of
the choices available for action:
that of those who are willing to
change superficially their life
styles, by employing such
methods as recycling of materials
and considering more carefully
the long-range consequences of
new products, and that of those
who attack the over all structure
of the system and culture in
which we live, by questioning, for
example, the way in which
Stanford land is used, or the
legitimacy of the institutions that
the University allows to flourish
on its campus.
This divison is very dangerous
to progress in solving ecological
problems, for it says, or at least
implies, that there are no common
goals of the two groups, no
common ground on which they
can work together. Ignorance of
this relationship is precisely the
point to which Lee Herzenberg
was trying to speak. Brendan says
that "no logical connections were
spelled out." It is not easy to do
this in a short article, and perhaps
all one can do is suggest that these
connections really do exist. For
example:
1) Stanford laud use — Lee
pointed out that many "people
who work and study at Stanford
can't- afford to live within a ten
mile radius." Is this not a clear,
direct outgrowth of University

policy toward land use, a policy
which has not met the needs of
the community? And as long as
people are forced to live great
distances from campus, and mass
transit is still unrealized, does
anyone think that the heavy use
of automobiles, leading to further
air pollution in the area, will not
continue? I leave it to the reader
to complete this connection,
linking Stanford land use policy
with people who "blame what's
happening to our world on
Stanford, or Dillingham."
2) "Oil ROTC" Movement — I
agree with Brendan that the
solution is not to "kick ROTC off
campus while we continue to
pollute the hell out of the
environment." But the crucial
question is not whether the first is
SUFFICIENT for preventing the
second, but whether it is
NECESSARY. That is, can we
adopt a saner environmental
policy within the framework of
our present economic system,
which entails a continuing
expansion of both consumers and
PER CAPITA consumption?
ROTC Is The Enemy
1, and some others, feel that
the ROTC program is one
important means by which this
economic framework is
reinforced, as it serves not only to
train persons to lead the fight
against insurgent movements
based on competing ideologies,
but also to instill in these same
people questionable values such as
blind obedience to authority, and
unquestioning servitude to
national goals. Whether others
agree with this line of thinking or
not, the presence at this
University of the ROTC program,
as a potential support for an
economic system that manifestly
has been unable to cope with
environmental problems, is

something tha ought to be
questioned in local discussions of
these problems.
