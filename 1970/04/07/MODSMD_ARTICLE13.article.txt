# The 						ASSU Scene
## Insult Intelligence 
### Chris Hocker 
The Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is an insult
to your intelligence, your free choice, your ability to govern yourself,
and your individuality.
By including the ASSU fee in your tuition, the administration of
this university has said, in effect: "You are not able to govern
yourselves. Therefore, we give you a student government to play with.
You can elect a president, or even four presidents, but they can not
do anything really, because we won't let them. You must be a part of
this student association, because being in it is part of your education
and you will need it when you get out into the real world. But never
think that it means anything. It is merely a pacified to give you
something else besides courses to spend your time with."
The ASSU is not student-run. Those who hold office are either
enjoying their little power-trip, trying to make something meaningful
of their tenure, or defeatedly carrying out the duties that they know
are trivial. By dutifully paying your ASSU fee every quarter, you are
contributing to this Theater of the Absurd. The Stanford student will
never attain the full expression of his individuality as long as he must
channel his activities through the ASSU.
The move to abolish compulsory membership in the ASSU is based
on the principle that no sane, competent person should be obliged to
join an organization, especially one that performs few important
services for all the members and that misrepresents the wishes of the
members most of the time. The abolition of compulsory ASSU
membership would be a blow to the patronizing attitude of the
administration and its belief that it must run the affairs of students.
What would happen if there were no ASSU? Very little that does
not already happen. The services that we are all used to would not
disappear, but would be assumed either by the university itself or,
more likely, by private organizations. Those services that are included
under the ASSU are there as extensions of the administration's idea
that it is good to let the students run things, as long as they are largely
meaningless. The ASSU does not supervise your room, board, and
tuition, but it is allowed to have a hand in your travel plans and your
afternoon snacks. For this reason, the argument that the payment of
the ASSU fee is comparable to the payment of taxes is invalid.
Government fares go toward those things which the government
decides are necessary.
The passage of the amendment on the ballot would not abolish
ASSU. It would abolish compulsory ASSU membership. Those
students who care nothing for ASSU- including a large number of
graduate students and undergraduates who are here to study and
nothing else â€”should not be forced into membership if for no other
reason than on principle. Student elections average a turnout of no
more than 10 percent. Those 40 percent who elect to join the ASSU
may do so freely and with greater effectiveness, for it will at last be
their own, not a harmless gift from the administration.
The passage of this amendment on April 15 and 16 will accomplish
a great deal. It will free those who do not care about student
government from the financial burden that, though relatively slight, is
now upon them. And, most importantly, it will represent a victory for
the principle of free choice and free expression of the individual
st u dent.
