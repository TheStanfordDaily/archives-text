# On Fraternities
## Lie Of 'Brotherhood' 
### David Morgan 
I am writing to clarify the fiction of the article
"Frat Variety," written by Joe Virga (Daily, April
.'J). Joe claims that "the" fraternity is first and
foremost a brotherhood. After residing in the Phi
Delt house for the academic year 1968-9, and
becoming a member, it is impossible for me to
comprehend this claim as stemming from
innocence or ignorance. Rather, his contention is a
blatant and malignant prevarication, at least in
relation to Phi Delta Theta, which may or may not
be paradigmatic of fraternities at Stanford.
There was NO "brotherhood," as such, in the
house last year. In fact, the motto of the house
had been for years, affectionately, "Fuck the
brothers."
The concrete relations amongst the members of
the house ranged from the normal respect friends
showed to friends, to no respect at all for others,
independent of their status as member, pledge, or
boarder.
The basic reason why Phi Delta Theta engages
in rush is not to find new "brothers"; this is
merely a tertiary motive. Rather, foremost in the
members' minds is the new source of revenue for
the house, which is always on the verge of
bankruptcy.
Secondly, the present members are always
happy to get new people into the house to do
housework, to clean up the pig-stye, as it were,
because only new members do housework. This
would not be such an intolerable proposition in
itself, except that none of the actives feel any sort
of respect for the house at all.
Hence, as long as THKY do not have to clean it
up, they are quite willing to drop their cigarette
butts on the floor or in the urinals; or participate
in periodical food fights which the pledges must

clean up. Of course, lei us nol forget, the great
amounts of pleasure which the actives derive from
invoking pledge training on the "pukes," as the
pledges are affectionately known.
Joe also claims that frat men, contrary to
popular opinion, do NOT lead a limited existence
with its center around the frat. As evidence of this,
he cites that nearly 100 percent of a fraternities'
membership is present at house meetings. Notice,
what Joe has overlooked is the fact of HOUSE
meetings, concerning the FRATERNITY and not
anything outside of the fraternity. Joe is living
proof of the limited existence which frat men lead;
I can do little to improve on his self-indictment.
Of course, the nearly 100 percent attendance at
fraternity house meetings must be understood in
the light that, at least at Phi Delta Theta, members
are subject, to censure in the form of a monetary
fine should they fail to attend a house meeting.
I would recommend that all freshmen choose
for themselves whether or not they would like to
live in a frat next year. Because 1 did not have a
happy experience with fraternity life does not
necessarily mean that others have not had happy
experiences in the past, or will not have happy
experiences in the future. But, 1 would urge
anyone participating in rush to remember that you
cannot get a straight answer from a member of a
house that is rushing you. They have a vested
interest in getting new members as a new source of
revenue, as people to keep their house clean, as
someone to get their kicks out of during pledge
training. Therefore, they have a vested interest in
making the frat look good despite the reality of
the situation 1 would suggest that freshmen
understand "brotherhood" in fraternities for what
it i*, a fiction.

itself, except that none of the actives feel any sort
of respect for the house at all.
Hence, as long as THKY do not have to clean it
up, they are quite willing to drop their cigarette
butts on the floor or in the urinals; or participate
in periodical food fights which the pledges must

clean up. Of course, lei us nol forget, the great
amounts of pleasure which the actives derive from
invoking pledge training on the "pukes," as the
pledges are affectionately known.
Joe also claims that frat men, contrary to
popular opinion, do NOT lead a limited existence
with its center around the frat. As evidence of this,
he cites that nearly 100 percent of a fraternities'
membership is present at house meetings. Notice,
what Joe has overlooked is the fact of HOUSE
meetings, concerning the FRATERNITY and not
anything outside of the fraternity. Joe is living
proof of the limited existence which frat men lead;
I can do little to improve on his self-indictment.
Of course, the nearly 100 percent attendance at
fraternity house meetings must be understood in
the light that, at least at Phi Delta Theta, members
are subject, to censure in the form of a monetary
fine should they fail to attend a house meeting.
I would recommend that all freshmen choose
for themselves whether or not they would like to
live in a frat next year. Because 1 did not have a
happy experience with fraternity life does not
necessarily mean that others have not had happy
experiences in the past, or will not have happy
experiences in the future. But, 1 would urge
anyone participating in rush to remember that you
cannot get a straight answer from a member of a
house that is rushing you. They have a vested
interest in getting new members as a new source of
revenue, as people to keep their house clean, as
someone to get their kicks out of during pledge
training. Therefore, they have a vested interest in
making the frat look good despite the reality of
the situation 1 would suggest that freshmen
understand "brotherhood" in fraternities for what
it i*, a fiction.
I am writing to clarify the fiction of the article
"Frat Variety," written by Joe Virga (Daily, April
.'J). Joe claims that "the" fraternity is first and
foremost a brotherhood. After residing in the Phi
Delt house for the academic year 1968-9, and
becoming a member, it is impossible for me to
comprehend this claim as stemming from
innocence or ignorance. Rather, his contention is a
blatant and malignant prevarication, at least in
relation to Phi Delta Theta, which may or may not
be paradigmatic of fraternities at Stanford.
There was NO "brotherhood," as such, in the
house last year. In fact, the motto of the house
had been for years, affectionately, "Fuck the
brothers."
The concrete relations amongst the members of
the house ranged from the normal respect friends
showed to friends, to no respect at all for others,
independent of their status as member, pledge, or
boarder.
The basic reason why Phi Delta Theta engages
in rush is not to find new "brothers"; this is
merely a tertiary motive. Rather, foremost in the
members' minds is the new source of revenue for
the house, which is always on the verge of
bankruptcy.
Secondly, the present members are always
happy to get new people into the house to do
housework, to clean up the pig-stye, as it were,
because only new members do housework. This
would not be such an intolerable proposition in
itself, except that none of the actives feel any sort
of respect for the house at all.
