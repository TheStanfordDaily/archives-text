# University Signs Lease For $15 Million Dillingham Project
## 
### 
By SUSAN KRIKGER
Plans for the much-disputed
Palo Alto Square were finalized
on March 13 when Stanford and
the Dillingham Land Corporation
signed a contract for the project.
The document provides for a
fifty-one year lease. Stanford will
receive $250,000 annually from
the lease.
Neither party has announced
when construction on the site will
begin, Ned Spieker of Dillingham
refusing to comment. He noted "I
will be better able to comment in
a couple of weeks. We are working
out some business details over
which we have no control." The
site is at the corner of El Cainino
and Page Mill Road.
Twenty Mouths To Complete
Palo Alto Square will take
approximately twenty months to
complete, at a cost of $15 million.

The completed complex will have
two office towers, a 300-room
high-rise hotel and conference
center, low-rise financial wings,
and an 800-seat theater. In
addition, a two-acre park between
the buildings will be planted with
400 trees. The complex will
employ about 900 people.
Both the Stanford and the Palo
Alto communities have protested
the construction of the complex
because of the increases in
population and traffic it will
cause, and on the grounds that
there are better uses for the land.
A February petition was rejected
by President Pitzer because he
said, it "would constitute an ex
post facto action which is neither
equitable to the parties concerned
nor responsive to the regular
processes of government."

The most recent protests came
on March 17, when 100 students
and residents of Palo Alto
gathered at the site for a St.
Patrick's Day exorcism of
"Demon Dillingham." The group
chanted "Power to the people;
Out, Demon, Out!" and a scroll
consisting of Biblical quotations
and incidences of Dillingham's
project at Lake Tahoe Keys was
read by Joseph Hardegree of the
United Campus Ministry.
In defending Palo Alto Square
Pitzer said that Stanford could
have divided the land into
one-acre lots for individual
commercial and manufacturing
enterprises, which would have
brought more revenue, but also
more traffic. The alternative
chosen, he said, was approved by
the city Real Estate Manager
Boyd Smith said that most of the
firms represented in Palo Alto
Square will be from this area.
According to President Pitzer,
Stanford is carefully reviewing the
use of its unzoned and unannexed
land outside the 5200-acre
Academic Reserve.


e
No, Ihi.s is not a student's wash
dtying nature's way. This is a tree willi
llie Iruits of a HOTC affinity group
lunging from it. The group, called "Z"

worked all weekend at Stern Hall
creating these fashions for today's
radical. "Join the Conspiracy" and
"Do It" are the messages.

Boyd Smith said that most of the
firms represented in Palo Alto
Square will be from this area.
According to President Pitzer,
Stanford is carefully reviewing the
use of its unzoned and unannexed
land outside the 5200-acre
Academic Reserve.

Plans for the much-disputed
Palo Alto Square were finalized
on March 13 when Stanford and
the Dillingham Land Corporation
signed a contract for the project.
The document provides for a
fifty-one year lease. Stanford will
receive $250,000 annually from
the lease.
Neither party has announced
when construction on the site will
begin, Ned Spieker of Dillingham
refusing to comment. He noted "I
will be better able to comment in
a couple of weeks. We are working
out some business details over
which we have no control." The
site is at the corner of El Cainino
and Page Mill Road.
Twenty Mouths To Complete
Palo Alto Square will take
approximately twenty months to
complete, at a cost of $15 million.

The completed complex will have
two office towers, a 300-room
high-rise hotel and conference
center, low-rise financial wings,
and an 800-seat theater. In
addition, a two-acre park between
the buildings will be planted with
400 trees. The complex will
employ about 900 people.
Both the Stanford and the Palo
Alto communities have protested
the construction of the complex
because of the increases in
population and traffic it will
cause, and on the grounds that
there are better uses for the land.
A February petition was rejected
by President Pitzer because he
said, it "would constitute an ex
post facto action which is neither
equitable to the parties concerned
nor responsive to the regular
processes of government."

The most recent protests came
on March 17, when 100 students
and residents of Palo Alto
gathered at the site for a St.
Patrick's Day exorcism of
"Demon Dillingham." The group
chanted "Power to the people;
Out, Demon, Out!" and a scroll
consisting of Biblical quotations
and incidences of Dillingham's
project at Lake Tahoe Keys was
read by Joseph Hardegree of the
United Campus Ministry.
In defending Palo Alto Square
Pitzer said that Stanford could
have divided the land into
one-acre lots for individual
commercial and manufacturing
enterprises, which would have
brought more revenue, but also
more traffic. The alternative
chosen, he said, was approved by
the city Real Estate Manager
Boyd Smith said that most of the
firms represented in Palo Alto
