# Psychologists Study Suicide On Campus
## 
### 
The suicide of a college youth
is typically not an impulsive act
by "some kid on a drug trip" or
under campus pressure, but the
result of years of accumulating
un happiness, says the
co-conductor of a two-year study.
"It's a very serious thing for a
human being to decide to dispose
of himself, and almost invariably
we found that it takes at least a
fourth of a lifetime for it to
happen to an intelligent
youngster," Dr. Michael Li. Peck
told the national convention of
the American Orthopsychiatric
Association Sunday.
He said his study assessed
suicides and suicidal behavior at
52 Southern California colleges
with about 300,000 students,
representing about 5 per cent of
all college students in the United
States.
"Almost universally, we learned
that youthful suicide is the result
of a chronic condition that builds
up from an early age, with a
strong element of parental
influence involved," he said later
in an interview.
"The impression that a
disturbed young person had been
on LSD or getting bad grades just
did not hold water."
Early signs build up in the
child's personality and behavior
by about age 1 2 or 13.

"He begins not relating to
anyone, becomes a loner, as a
product of his growing despair,"
Peck said.
"By the time he reaches
college, he has very few contacts,
no social sex, and indulges in less
drug usage than the non-suicidai
student."
A major reason is parental
pressure, Peck said.
"We may legitimately ask, how
did he get that way? Since the
study revealed no major overt
disturbance in the parents, how is
it that parents were still seen as
playing a major contributing role?
"The careful study revealed a
pattern in the parents of much
overt striving for themselves and
their children to be successful,
and a tendency to not accept
other kinds of communication
from their children."
Peck said children's feelings of
unhappiness, frustration or failure
were either ignored, denied or met
by such defensive hostility as:
"What have you got to be
unhappy about? You have
everything."
When the child failed to live up
to parental expectations, he felt a
tremendous humiliation, Peck
said.
In case after case, however, it
was years later before the child
decided life was no longer worth
living, he added.

result of years of accumulating
un happiness, says the
co-conductor of a two-year study.
"It's a very serious thing for a
human being to decide to dispose
of himself, and almost invariably
we found that it takes at least a
fourth of a lifetime for it to
happen to an intelligent
youngster," Dr. Michael Li. Peck
told the national convention of
the American Orthopsychiatric
Association Sunday.
He said his study assessed
suicides and suicidal behavior at
52 Southern California colleges
with about 300,000 students,
representing about 5 per cent of
all college students in the United
States.
"Almost universally, we learned
that youthful suicide is the result
of a chronic condition that builds
up from an early age, with a
strong element of parental
influence involved," he said later
in an interview.
"The impression that a
disturbed young person had been
on LSD or getting bad grades just
did not hold water."
Early signs build up in the
child's personality and behavior
by about age 1 2 or 13.

"He begins not relating to
anyone, becomes a loner, as a
product of his growing despair,"
Peck said.
"By the time he reaches
college, he has very few contacts,
no social sex, and indulges in less
drug usage than the non-suicidai
student."
A major reason is parental
pressure, Peck said.
"We may legitimately ask, how
did he get that way? Since the
study revealed no major overt
disturbance in the parents, how is
it that parents were still seen as
playing a major contributing role?
"The careful study revealed a
pattern in the parents of much
overt striving for themselves and
their children to be successful,
and a tendency to not accept
other kinds of communication
from their children."
Peck said children's feelings of
unhappiness, frustration or failure
were either ignored, denied or met
by such defensive hostility as:
"What have you got to be
unhappy about? You have
everything."
When the child failed to live up
to parental expectations, he felt a
tremendous humiliation, Peck
said.
In case after case, however, it
was years later before the child
decided life was no longer worth
living, he added.
