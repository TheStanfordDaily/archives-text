# Land Freeze Urged
## Portola Mayor Speaks 
### RICJAY 
Mayor Sam Halsted of Portola
Valley announced Monday his
proposals for area environmental
conservation, calling for a
"freeze" on land development in
San Mateo County's coastside
are. Speaking before a
noon-audience of nearly 100 at
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business, the mayor expressed a
fear that if the coastside area is
not used for recreational values, it
will be lost in vast building
programs of "bedroom
communities." He warned that
pending bills in the state
legislature establishing
environmental planning

commissions may not be "quick
enough" to prevent environmental
damage.
His solution called for an
"emergency moratorium" on land
development until the
state-appointed commissions
could be formed. Mr. Halsted said
that those developers now having
building permits would not be
affected by the moratorium, but
those without could be legally
prevented from starting
construction until approved by
the commission. According to the
mayor, it is not too late to save
western San Mateo County's
environment.
Halsted stated that although
the area in question (from Daly
City south to the Santa Clara
county line) included 50 percent
of San Mateo County, it
contained only 10-thousand of
the county's 550,000 residents.
He forsaw another upsurge in land
and building investment which,
unless controlled, could bring
1 50,000 into the area by means of
massive small-lot subdivision
development.
In order to prevent this
westward exodus, Halsted urged
that planned pre-zonirig be used
to regulate development. Using
Portola Valley as an example, he
explained how the community
had used zoning as a protective
device to keep out mass suburban
and commercial development.
Stressing more than just the
loss of the county's picturesque
terrain, the mayor noted the
dangers of over-settlement in an
area associated with the San

Andreas Fault. He also mentioned
that the present water supply
would be insufficient to serve any
such population increase, unless
the proposed Arastidero Dam
were to take the growth into
consideration. But Halsted said
that the dam would defeat the
conservation issues by inducing
development unless only built to
serve the planning commission's
forecasts.
Halsted, a Stanford graduate
and Republican candidate for San
Mateo County state senatorial
nomination, is a consulting
planner and engineer. He has been
associated with various private
and public developments
throughout the country, including
industrial parks, Indian
reservations, airports and
recreational facilities. He was the
opening speaker of the Stanford
Business School Conservation
Consultants'-sponsored "Survival
in the 70's: A Forum on the
Environment," designed to serve
as an introduction to the National
Ecological "Teach-In", April 22.
Two more speakers are
scheduled to appear this week.
Prof. John Hessel of Stanford's
Biology Department will be
making a noon appearance
Tuesday, and Mr. Phil Barry,
president of the Sierra Club, is
slated for Wednesday.

and building investment which,
unless controlled, could bring
1 50,000 into the area by means of
massive small-lot subdivision
development.
In order to prevent this
westward exodus, Halsted urged
that planned pre-zonirig be used
to regulate development. Using
Portola Valley as an example, he
explained how the community
had used zoning as a protective
device to keep out mass suburban
and commercial development.
Stressing more than just the
loss of the county's picturesque
terrain, the mayor noted the
dangers of over-settlement in an
area associated with the San

Andreas Fault. He also mentioned
that the present water supply
would be insufficient to serve any
such population increase, unless
the proposed Arastidero Dam
were to take the growth into
consideration. But Halsted said
that the dam would defeat the
conservation issues by inducing
development unless only built to
serve the planning commission's
forecasts.
Halsted, a Stanford graduate
and Republican candidate for San
Mateo County state senatorial
nomination, is a consulting
planner and engineer. He has been
associated with various private
and public developments
throughout the country, including
industrial parks, Indian
reservations, airports and
recreational facilities. He was the
opening speaker of the Stanford
Business School Conservation
Consultants'-sponsored "Survival
in the 70's: A Forum on the
Environment," designed to serve
as an introduction to the National
Ecological "Teach-In", April 22.
Two more speakers are
scheduled to appear this week.
Prof. John Hessel of Stanford's
Biology Department will be
making a noon appearance
Tuesday, and Mr. Phil Barry,
president of the Sierra Club, is
slated for Wednesday.
Mayor Sam Halsted of Portola
Valley announced Monday his
proposals for area environmental
conservation, calling for a
"freeze" on land development in
San Mateo County's coastside
are. Speaking before a
noon-audience of nearly 100 at
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business, the mayor expressed a
fear that if the coastside area is
not used for recreational values, it
will be lost in vast building
programs of "bedroom
communities." He warned that
pending bills in the state
legislature establishing
environmental planning

commissions may not be "quick
enough" to prevent environmental
damage.
His solution called for an
"emergency moratorium" on land
development until the
state-appointed commissions
could be formed. Mr. Halsted said
that those developers now having
building permits would not be
affected by the moratorium, but
those without could be legally
prevented from starting
construction until approved by
the commission. According to the
mayor, it is not too late to save
western San Mateo County's
environment.
Halsted stated that although
the area in question (from Daly
City south to the Santa Clara
county line) included 50 percent
of San Mateo County, it
contained only 10-thousand of
the county's 550,000 residents.
He forsaw another upsurge in land
and building investment which,
unless controlled, could bring
1 50,000 into the area by means of
massive small-lot subdivision
development.
