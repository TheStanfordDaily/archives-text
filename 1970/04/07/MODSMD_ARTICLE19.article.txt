A paragraph in last night's
lead demonstration story was
mistakenly deleted as the paper
was being made up The
demonstrators did not intend to
disrupt the Academic Council
when they entered the Physics
Tank, as the story seems to
indicate.
The missing paragraph reads
as follows:
"We don't want to prevent
the faculty from voting," said
Art Busse before the Academic
Council's meeting started. "We
don't want to disrupt. We want
to meet and discuss ROTC. We'll
be glad to leave as soon as they
(the Council members) come in
and make room for them."
