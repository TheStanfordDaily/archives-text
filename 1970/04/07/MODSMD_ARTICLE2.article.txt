# Residence Plans Reflect 1969 Draw
## 
### 
A proposed housing
configuration for next year
released yesterday shows a
significant increase in coed
housing, both for freshmen and
upperclassmen.
Saying that the proposal
"comes about as close as possible,
given Stanford's ratio and housing
facilities, to implementing
student's housing desires as
expressed in last Spring's draw,"
the student-staff committee also
noted that displacements of
current residences had been kept
to a minimum and that special
draw provisions for those moved
had been made.
For freshmen, coed spaces
increase about 35 percent to 969
freshmen, or 69 percent of all
freshmen places. For
upperclassmen, coed spaces
increased about 1 2 percent to 959
which represents 69 percent of all
upperclass spaces outside of
Hoskins and Manzanita.
The increase in frosh coed
spaces was made possible in part

by a projected change in
male-female ratio from the
present 950-450 to 900-500 for
next year.
The ratio, of men to women in
Manzanita will be changed from
the present 3-1 to about 1-1; and
Hoskins, presently all women, will
change to become about 1-1 men
to women. There will be
approximately 30 more spaces <or
upperclass women on campus,
which the committee said
reflected a consistently larger
number of women than men on
the waiting list for housing during
the past year.
A complete description of the
proposal has been provided for all
residence staff. Any dormitory
which would like to have
committee members available to
answer questions about the
proposal should call Bill Leland,
Associate Dean of Students at ext.
3048.
A complete listing of the
proposed configuration appears
