# Picketing Today
## Workers Protest Appointments 
### 
The United Stanford
Employees (USE) Thursday
decided to sponsor an
informational picket line at 4 p.m.
today in front of building T-600,
where the Faculty-Staff Affairs
Committee is scheduled to hold
its second meeting.
USE is protesting President
Pitzer's appointment of staff
representatives to the committee.
In a resolution passed at its
monthly meeting Thursday night
in Bishop Auditorium, the USE
membership declared: "Staff
members have the right to select
their own representatives; they
have the right and responsibility
to speak for themselves."
"Broadly based representation,
including employees from both
sexes, varying racial, economic
and social backgrounds, is needed
to provide a broader scope of
insights about community
problem solving."
Health Physics employee
Roland A. Finston said Sunday
that no other groups would be
asked to join the picket line
because of the lack of

organizational time. He added
that he expected the picket line to
remain small because few
employees can rearrange their
work schedules to allow them to
finish for the day before 4 p.m.
Asks Other Croups
USE plans to ask other
employee groups to join it in
asking the Stanford
administration sponsor
campus-wide elections this quarter
to elect new representatives and
"legitimize" the committee.
Finston said that the present
representatives would be invited
to occupy a place on the ballot.
The group also plans to ask for
a new University standing
committee, the Staff Committee
on Nominations. The proposed
committee would parallel similar
student and faculty groups
already in existance.
In its picket line today, the
USE also plans to protest a
decision made by the committee
at its first meeting last week to
hold all meetings behind closed
doors unless specific people are
invited to appear.

At present, the Faculty-Staff
Affairs Committee is composed of
four faculty members, one
student, four Pitzer-appointed
staff members, and two ex-officio
members of the administration,
Robert M. Nelson, Director of
Personnel and Employee
Relations, and his secretary.
The USE wants the proposed
Staff Committee on Nominations
to be composed of at least 12
members, with all employees who
work "for or at Stanford" to be
eligible for nomination to office
or the committee and eligible to
vote.

Dr. Count D. Gibson, Associate
Dean of the Medical School for
Community Health Programs told
the 80 staff members present that
with some members of the staff
living 50 miles from campus that
it would be difficult if not
impossible to establish a
community health program
because of a "lack of
community."
Finston said that the group
would continue to study staff
housing needs and would make a
presentation to Wednesday night's
meeting of the Committee of
Land and Development.

remain small because few
employees can rearrange their
work schedules to allow them to
finish for the day before 4 p.m.

USE plans to ask other
employee groups to join it in
asking the Stanford
administration sponsor
campus-wide elections this quarter
to elect new representatives and
"legitimize" the committee.
Finston said that the present
representatives would be invited
to occupy a place on the ballot.
The group also plans to ask for
a new University standing
committee, the Staff Committee
on Nominations. The proposed
committee would parallel similar
student and faculty groups
already in existance.
In its picket line today, the
USE also plans to protest a
decision made by the committee
at its first meeting last week to
hold all meetings behind closed
doors unless specific people are
invited to appear.

At present, the Faculty-Staff
Affairs Committee is composed of
four faculty members, one
student, four Pitzer-appointed
staff members, and two ex-officio
members of the administration,
Robert M. Nelson, Director of
Personnel and Employee
Relations, and his secretary.
The USE wants the proposed
Staff Committee on Nominations
to be composed of at least 12
members, with all employees who
work "for or at Stanford" to be
eligible for nomination to office
or the committee and eligible to
vote.

Dr. Count D. Gibson, Associate
Dean of the Medical School for
Community Health Programs told
the 80 staff members present that
with some members of the staff
living 50 miles from campus that
it would be difficult if not
impossible to establish a
community health program
because of a "lack of
community."
Finston said that the group
would continue to study staff
housing needs and would make a
presentation to Wednesday night's
meeting of the Committee of
Land and Development.
The United Stanford
Employees (USE) Thursday
decided to sponsor an
informational picket line at 4 p.m.
today in front of building T-600,
where the Faculty-Staff Affairs
Committee is scheduled to hold
its second meeting.
USE is protesting President
Pitzer's appointment of staff
representatives to the committee.
In a resolution passed at its
monthly meeting Thursday night
in Bishop Auditorium, the USE
membership declared: "Staff
members have the right to select
their own representatives; they
have the right and responsibility
to speak for themselves."
"Broadly based representation,
including employees from both
sexes, varying racial, economic
and social backgrounds, is needed
to provide a broader scope of
insights about community
problem solving."
Health Physics employee
Roland A. Finston said Sunday
that no other groups would be
asked to join the picket line
because of the lack of

organizational time. He added
that he expected the picket line to
remain small because few
employees can rearrange their
work schedules to allow them to
finish for the day before 4 p.m.
