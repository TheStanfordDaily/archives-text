# Handball, Squash, Too
## Pool Plans Unveiled 
### 
Fund-raising is underway for a
proposed $2,520,000 swimming,
squash and handball compl°x to
be constructed near Maples
Pavilion, bounded by the varsity
tennis courts on the south and
Angell Field to the west.
The buildings are part of Phase
II of a Master Building Plan for
the Department of Athletics.
Phase I was Maples Pavilion,
which was completed in January,
1969.
Trustees of the University
approved the start of the
fund-raising campaign at their
meeting last month.
Director of Athletics Chuck
Taylor has said that a
comprehensive fund-raising
campaign was not envisioned, but
rather, "We're going to be asking a
limited number of potential
donors."
The cost estimate for the new
complex is based on all funds
raised or pledged by early 1971
when construction is planned.
Planners estimate a ten percent
rise in cost annually should the
funds not be raised by that time.
Gifts totalling $420,210 have
been received or pledged thus far.
The swimming complex will

consist of two pools—a 50-meter
by 25-yard outdoor pool and a
25-yard by 25-meter in-door pool.
The latter, with both one and
three-meter diving facilities, will
have seats for 3,000 spectators.
In addition, the building will
house dressing rooms for women
as well as men, along with
showers, team rooms and offices.
Aside from use in
intercollegiate competition, the
pool facilities will also allow
expanded water instruction in
scuba diving, water safety, life
saving and boat safety.
Underwater viewing windows
have been planned for the indoor
pool which are claimed to be
instructional aids.
The pools will also be available
for recreational and intramural
use, regardless of weather. Unlike
the present Encina pool complex,
shower and dressing rooms will be
available for women.
The squash-handball will be
built for eight courts, four for
each sport. The Department of
Physical Education will introduce
squash and handball courses, and
the facilities will also be available
for intramural and recreation
play.

Hawley and Peterson, Palo
Alto, are architects for the
complex which will bear some
structural resemblance to the
form of Maples Pavilion.
Stanford never has had
handball or squash facilities, and
the new pools will relieve the
three existing Eneina pools, built
in 1929, of their inter-collegiate
use.
Study of the existing pools
revealed rusted pipes and an
inadequate gutter system, which
aside from creating cumbersome
wave action is also considered to
be a health hazard.
Renovation of the existing
pools would involve destruction
of the pool walls in order to get at
the concrete encased plumbing
structure. Concrete aprons
surrounding the pools have been
described by the athletic
department as "a patchwork of
cracks and patches."
Water leakage has also been a
problem.
The new facilities are expected
to bring increased enrollment to
winter-quarter swimming classes
and to shield swimming fans from
inclement weather during
intercollegiate competition.
