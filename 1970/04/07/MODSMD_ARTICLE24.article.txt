# Card Laxmen Post Two Wins
## 
### 
The Stanford lacrosse club
came out on top twice this
weekend, downing the East Bay
Lacrosse Club 9-3 on Saturday
and the San Francisco Lacrosse
Club 8-4 on Sunday.
Stanford completely dominated
East Bay outshooting them four
to one, but typical of early
season, the game was
characterized by haphazard
passing, a general tendency to
rush every action and overall
disorganized play.
East Bay attempted to slow
down play and get organized
several times, but their lack of
stickhandling ability forced them
to turn the ball over before a
scoring opportunity could
develop.
Stanford never really took
control of the ball for a sustained
offensive drive, relying more on
forcing the ball past their
opponents. Stanford also lacked
the desire to get control of loose
balls, scooping through the ball
only on rare occasions.

On Sunday a wiser Stanford
team ran into a more proficient
San Francisco team. This time the
Indians took full control of the
game, settling the ball down on
offense, breaking San Francisco's
Maryland ride slowly and
methodically (as it should be
broken) and consistantly breaking
up San Francisco's offensive
drives.
Stanford put it all together at
3:10 into the fourth period, when
after a good clear the Tribe set up
its offense around the opponents
goal and proceeded to move the
ball around the perimeter until
the weak spot was found at which
point Paul Tittman fired a shot
home after receiving a beautiful
feed from Butch Hazlett.
San Francisco, foiled by
Stanford's strong defense led by
Bill Eakland and Wade Killifer,
could only chalk up four
unassisted goals. Only the
astronomical amount of penalties
marred the otherwise well played
game, Stanford with ten for

nine-and-a-half minutes while San
Francisco drew nine for ten
minutes.
Both with exceptional
performances over the weekend,
Butch Hazlett and Chip Loveman
lead the Tribe laxmen in the
scoring category with five goals
and seven assists, and eight goals
and four assists, respectively.
Stanford puts its perfect 2-0-0
league record on the line when it
goes against Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club next Saturday at 2 p.m. at
Palo Alto.
The Tribe laxmen dropped
their opening encounter of the
season during spring break, losing
to the University of Denver, 10-6.
In that game Chip Loveman
scored four of Stanford's six goals
and assisted on another.

Stanford puts its perfect 2-0-0
league record on the line when it
goes against Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club next Saturday at 2 p.m. at
Palo Alto.
The Tribe laxmen dropped
their opening encounter of the
season during spring break, losing
to the University of Denver, 10-6.
In that game Chip Loveman
scored four of Stanford's six goals
and assisted on another.
The Stanford lacrosse club
came out on top twice this
weekend, downing the East Bay
Lacrosse Club 9-3 on Saturday
and the San Francisco Lacrosse
Club 8-4 on Sunday.
Stanford completely dominated
East Bay outshooting them four
to one, but typical of early
season, the game was
characterized by haphazard
passing, a general tendency to
rush every action and overall
disorganized play.
East Bay attempted to slow
down play and get organized
several times, but their lack of
stickhandling ability forced them
to turn the ball over before a
scoring opportunity could
develop.
Stanford never really took
control of the ball for a sustained
offensive drive, relying more on
forcing the ball past their
opponents. Stanford also lacked
the desire to get control of loose
balls, scooping through the ball
only on rare occasions.

On Sunday a wiser Stanford
team ran into a more proficient
San Francisco team. This time the
Indians took full control of the
game, settling the ball down on
offense, breaking San Francisco's
Maryland ride slowly and
methodically (as it should be
broken) and consistantly breaking
up San Francisco's offensive
drives.
Stanford put it all together at
3:10 into the fourth period, when
after a good clear the Tribe set up
its offense around the opponents
goal and proceeded to move the
ball around the perimeter until
the weak spot was found at which
point Paul Tittman fired a shot
home after receiving a beautiful
feed from Butch Hazlett.
San Francisco, foiled by
Stanford's strong defense led by
Bill Eakland and Wade Killifer,
could only chalk up four
unassisted goals. Only the
astronomical amount of penalties
marred the otherwise well played
game, Stanford with ten for

nine-and-a-half minutes while San
Francisco drew nine for ten
minutes.
Both with exceptional
performances over the weekend,
Butch Hazlett and Chip Loveman
lead the Tribe laxmen in the
scoring category with five goals
and seven assists, and eight goals
and four assists, respectively.
