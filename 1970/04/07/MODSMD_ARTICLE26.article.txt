# Fun And Games
## TV Or No TV 
### John Arthur 
The announcement yesterday that Stanford's Sept. 12 tootball
game with Arkansas would be nationally televised brings the whole
11th game affair full circle.
Collegiate athletic programs these days are big businesses, but too
often skyrocketing costs across the board leave incomes tar behind.
And when athletic departments can't sustain themselves (and they
rarely can) universities must step in to help shoulder the iinancial
burdens. Recognizing this, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association finally approved the 11th game early this year.
The contest was envisioned as a sorely needed elixir for whatever
schools found themselves on an expensive sickbed. Nevertheless, only
about half of the more than 100 major colleges have taken advantage
of the option. Most of these have scheduled "soft-touch" opponents
in games designed to bolster incomes as well as won-lost marks. Other
schools, sensitive to charges of "overemphasis" of football and the
like, have decided let the game pass.
At Stanford, the decision to play Arkansas appears to have been
based on several factors. For one, the matchup, featuring two
high-scoring teams and two talented quarterbacks, Jim Plunkett and
Bill Montgomery, is attractive.
Secondly, both schools need the money. The football program
here, along with University subsidies, pays for the entire athletic
program, and increased football revenue will help make up for an
anticipated 20-25% cutback from the University next year.
Thirdly, the American Broadcasting Company wanted the game for
its national TV opener and made its intentions known to both schools
as early as February, just weeks after the 1 Ith game was approved by
the NCAA.
The importance of television cannot be over estimated here.
According to Athletic Director Chuck Taylor, Stanford and Arkansas
will be able to split up to $300,000 from the national TV contract.
Stanford will bring its 150 G's back to the west, keep 40% (about
$60,000) giving the rest to the Pacific Eight. The league then
divides the sum eight ways, so Stanford gets $11,250 back. And if the
garr.e in Little Rock is a sellout, Stanford stands to gain up to
$100,000, which should give the Indians about $170,000 altogether.
Of course, lrom all of this must be subtracted the costs of keeping
the football team here for an extra week in August (perhaps $20,000)
along with the transportation costs to Little Rock (perhaps $24,000).
So, the TV money becomes an important factor. Taylor says that
when the game was scheduled last month there was no guarantee that
it would be televised (although if not, the Purdue game on Oct. 3
might have been), but you can be sure that one of the reasons the
University checked out racial practices at Arkansas so meticulously
was to avoid fouling up a lucrative arrangement.
ABC, which had the game scheduled as early as February, would
not have been pleased by the announcement from Taylor in March
that Stanford's Student-Faculty Athletic Committee had refused to
sanction it because not enough was known about the situation in
Fayetteville.
The New York Times has said that ABC "brought Stanford and
Arkansas together" for its opener. Taylor merely admits that the
network had expressed an interest in the game, if it was scheduled. He
adds that he has been reluctant to arrange schedules solely for
television purposes ever since last year's Big Game. At that time the
network had indicated a desire to televise the Stanford-Cal game but
only if game time was moved up. Yet after thoroughly researching the
possibilities of such a move, the two teams learned that the deal
wasn't possible because of NCAA TV regulations.

The contest was envisioned as a sorely needed elixir for whatever
schools found themselves on an expensive sickbed. Nevertheless, only
about half of the more than 100 major colleges have taken advantage
of the option. Most of these have scheduled "soft-touch" opponents
in games designed to bolster incomes as well as won-lost marks. Other
schools, sensitive to charges of "overemphasis" of football and the
like, have decided let the game pass.
At Stanford, the decision to play Arkansas appears to have been
based on several factors. For one, the matchup, featuring two
high-scoring teams and two talented quarterbacks, Jim Plunkett and
Bill Montgomery, is attractive.
Secondly, both schools need the money. The football program
here, along with University subsidies, pays for the entire athletic
program, and increased football revenue will help make up for an
anticipated 20-25% cutback from the University next year.
Thirdly, the American Broadcasting Company wanted the game for
its national TV opener and made its intentions known to both schools
as early as February, just weeks after the 1 Ith game was approved by
the NCAA.
The importance of television cannot be over estimated here.
According to Athletic Director Chuck Taylor, Stanford and Arkansas
will be able to split up to $300,000 from the national TV contract.
Stanford will bring its 150 G's back to the west, keep 40% (about
$60,000) giving the rest to the Pacific Eight. The league then
divides the sum eight ways, so Stanford gets $11,250 back. And if the
garr.e in Little Rock is a sellout, Stanford stands to gain up to
$100,000, which should give the Indians about $170,000 altogether.
Of course, lrom all of this must be subtracted the costs of keeping
the football team here for an extra week in August (perhaps $20,000)
along with the transportation costs to Little Rock (perhaps $24,000).
So, the TV money becomes an important factor. Taylor says that
when the game was scheduled last month there was no guarantee that
it would be televised (although if not, the Purdue game on Oct. 3
might have been), but you can be sure that one of the reasons the
University checked out racial practices at Arkansas so meticulously
was to avoid fouling up a lucrative arrangement.
ABC, which had the game scheduled as early as February, would
not have been pleased by the announcement from Taylor in March
that Stanford's Student-Faculty Athletic Committee had refused to
sanction it because not enough was known about the situation in
Fayetteville.
The New York Times has said that ABC "brought Stanford and
Arkansas together" for its opener. Taylor merely admits that the
network had expressed an interest in the game, if it was scheduled. He
adds that he has been reluctant to arrange schedules solely for
television purposes ever since last year's Big Game. At that time the
network had indicated a desire to televise the Stanford-Cal game but
only if game time was moved up. Yet after thoroughly researching the
possibilities of such a move, the two teams learned that the deal
wasn't possible because of NCAA TV regulations.
The announcement yesterday that Stanford's Sept. 12 tootball
game with Arkansas would be nationally televised brings the whole
11th game affair full circle.
Collegiate athletic programs these days are big businesses, but too
often skyrocketing costs across the board leave incomes tar behind.
And when athletic departments can't sustain themselves (and they
rarely can) universities must step in to help shoulder the iinancial
burdens. Recognizing this, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association finally approved the 11th game early this year.
