# Professors Honored
## 
### 
Three Stanford University
professors—Holt Ashley and
Arthur Biyson of the Department
of Aeronautical and Astronautical
Engineering, and Calvin Quate of
Applied Physics and Electrical
Engineering—have been elected to
membership in the National
Academy of Engineering.
Membership in the engineering
academy is the highest
professional distinction that can
be conferred upon an American
engineer.
Prof. Ashley is an authority on
ceroelastic phenomena such as
"flutter," and has pioneered in
theoretical techniques designed to
predict unsteady airloads,
aeroelastic stability and response.
Prof. Bryson is a specialist in fluid
mechanics, flight mechanics, and
automatic control. Prof. Quate is
well known for his contributions
to the theory and design of low
noise amplifiers, and for his
investigations of wave propagation
in solids.
