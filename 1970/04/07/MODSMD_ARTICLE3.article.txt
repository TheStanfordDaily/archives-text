# New Bylaws Pose Election Difficulties
## 
### 
Six presidential slates, three
referenda and one constitutional
amendmentare scheduled for the
ballot when students vote next
week in the ASSU election.
The problems lie however, in
the deadline date for petition
submission. According to the old
by-laws, all petitions for
candidates and special
referenda had to be in nine
days before the election, which
was 5:00 yesterday afternoon.
Under the revised by-laws they are
not due until five days before the
scheduled election on Friday.
These by-laws were passed about
a month before the end of the
winter quarter.
Jan Westfall, ASSU Election
Commissioner, has been operating
under the old by-laws because the
additional four days is needed to
send the ballots to the overseas
campus and receive their results
by the end of the elections.
According to John Delaney,
ASSU By-law Committee
Chairman, the five day deadline
allows sufficient time, and the
commissioner received enough
notice of the change in deadlines
to plan the election according to
the new by-laws. If there are any
complaints about the nine day
deadline, which Miss Westfall is
planning to stand by, the entire
election couid be thrown out.
As it stands now, the

presidential slates are: Harvey H.
Hukari, president; Ernesto Real,
vice-president; Charles B. Kitsman
and John E. Pratt; and John
Shoch and Bill Evers. Two
Councils are running, composed
of Bob Mattson, Loudin Beam,
Bob Corey; and Patrick C. Shea,
Robert Grant, Adam Levin and
Hal Mickelson.
A petition was submitted with
the names of Richard Atkins as
presidential candidate and David
Swift as vice-president, but it is
unclear as to whether Swift will
remain a candidate.
Referendas include a special
assessment proposition for the
Daily, the ASSU Program Fee
referendum, an ASSU Special
Events Board referendum, and an
ASSU ROTC referendum, which
will ask student opinion on the
continuing presence of ROTC on
campus and, if ROTC remains,
whether it should be given credit.
The amendment to the
constitution proposes that
membership in the ASSU be made
voluntary and limited only to
those who pay the assessed fee.
Student conduct legislative
council candidates who will
appear on the ballot are James L.
Barber, Paul J. Busse, Cynthia
Cherbak, Steven L. Guerra, Chris
Hocker, Harries-Clichy Peterson,
Jr., Robert Spiro, John A.
Washburn, and Raymond R.
White.

Shoch and Bill Evers. Two
Councils are running, composed
of Bob Mattson, Loudin Beam,
Bob Corey; and Patrick C. Shea,
Robert Grant, Adam Levin and
Hal Mickelson.
A petition was submitted with
the names of Richard Atkins as
presidential candidate and David
Swift as vice-president, but it is
unclear as to whether Swift will
remain a candidate.
Referendas include a special
assessment proposition for the
Daily, the ASSU Program Fee
referendum, an ASSU Special
Events Board referendum, and an
ASSU ROTC referendum, which
will ask student opinion on the
continuing presence of ROTC on
campus and, if ROTC remains,
whether it should be given credit.
The amendment to the
constitution proposes that
membership in the ASSU be made
voluntary and limited only to
those who pay the assessed fee.
Student conduct legislative
council candidates who will
appear on the ballot are James L.
Barber, Paul J. Busse, Cynthia
Cherbak, Steven L. Guerra, Chris
Hocker, Harries-Clichy Peterson,
Jr., Robert Spiro, John A.
Washburn, and Raymond R.
White.
Six presidential slates, three
referenda and one constitutional
amendmentare scheduled for the
ballot when students vote next
week in the ASSU election.
The problems lie however, in
the deadline date for petition
submission. According to the old
by-laws, all petitions for
candidates and special
referenda had to be in nine
days before the election, which
was 5:00 yesterday afternoon.
Under the revised by-laws they are
not due until five days before the
scheduled election on Friday.
These by-laws were passed about
a month before the end of the
winter quarter.
Jan Westfall, ASSU Election
Commissioner, has been operating
under the old by-laws because the
additional four days is needed to
send the ballots to the overseas
campus and receive their results
by the end of the elections.
According to John Delaney,
ASSU By-law Committee
Chairman, the five day deadline
allows sufficient time, and the
commissioner received enough
notice of the change in deadlines
to plan the election according to
the new by-laws. If there are any
complaints about the nine day
deadline, which Miss Westfall is
planning to stand by, the entire
election couid be thrown out.
As it stands now, the

presidential slates are: Harvey H.
Hukari, president; Ernesto Real,
vice-president; Charles B. Kitsman
and John E. Pratt; and John
Shoch and Bill Evers. Two
Councils are running, composed
of Bob Mattson, Loudin Beam,
Bob Corey; and Patrick C. Shea,
