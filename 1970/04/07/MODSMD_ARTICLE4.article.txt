## Carswell Survives 
### 
WASHINGTON AP - The Senate
gave President Nixon a
surprisingly easy-but possibly
temporary victory Monday,
refusing to send the Supreme
Court nomination of G. Harrold
Carswell back to the .Judiciary
Committee.
The vote was 52 to 44 to reject
a recommittal motion that would
have spelled all but certain death
for Nixon's second straight high
court nomination.
But appointment of the
f> 0-year-old appeals court judge,
accused by his critics of racism
and mediocrity, still faces its
ultimate test Wednesday when
confirmation comes to a straight
up-or-downvote.
Although the eight-vote margin
of victory was seen as an
indication Carswell will be
confirmed, some switches both

ways were expected and his
opponents refused to abandon the
fight.
"There may be some small or
moderate slippage," Senate
Republican Leader High Scott of
Pennsylvania told newsmen. But
he said he is confident of
confirmation.
"It looks to me like its leaning
toward Carswell," said Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield of
Montana who voted for
recommittal. "I imagine the vote
on recommittal will be a precursor
as to what will happen
Wednesday."
With the probably outcome
increasingly apparent before the
recommittal roll call began, the
only moment of drama came
minutes after it ended. Mansfield
rose to suggest the Senate
abandon an earlier agreement.
