# Protestors Smash Windows In Scattered Guerilla Attacks
## 
### 
At least 55 windows were
quickly smashed by more than
250 anti-ROTC demonstrators last
night in the fifth evening of
protest against officer training.
Within 10 minutes the
well-organized radicals broke 15
windows in President Kenneth
Pitzer's office and 34 in the
Aeronautics and Astronautics
building, their two primary targets.
Uniformed police were not in
evidence, and no arrests or injuries
were reported.
The crowd, which consisted
partly of Berkeley, Foothill, and
Palo Alto High School radicals,
also shattered a few windows in
the Earth Sciences, Material
Sciences, Geology and Political
Science buildings.
At the meeting in the Old
Union courtyard prior to last
night's action, the protestors
voted to continue their
demonstrations today with a noon

rally in White Plaza to announce
the time and location of a
"mobile militant, sit-in, mill-in."
After formulating this plan, the
group voted overwhelmingly to
take some kind of immediate
''militant action." The
demonstrators then divided into
affinity groups of 15 to 20 to
discuss what to do in case of
police counter-actions.
Coordinating Council
Meanwhile two targets were
chosen by a meeting of the
"coordinating council" consisting
of a representative from each
affinity group. Choices were
then relayed back to the group
members.
By this tactic demonstrators
hoped to minimize information
leaks to police.
Organized into tight bands the
demonstrators massed for what at
first almost appeared to be a

leisurely stroll to the President's
office.
Chanting "OFF ROTC" the
radicals grouped in front of his
office on the Inner Quad for a
brief rock throwing foray.
Quick March
The demonstrators then
regrouped and marched quickly
across the Quad toward Physics
Tank, picking up more rocks
before veering toward the
Aero-Astro building. "Fast pace!
Tighten it up!" they yelled.
Responding to shouts from
within the crowd, the
demonstrators waited until all
were within striking distance of
the buildings windows before
beginning the barrage.
The sound of shattering
windows filled the air for the next
10 seconds before the crowd
moved into Lomita Drive.
Protestors then trailed back

toward the Union before
dispersing.
Quiet Beginning
The evening began quietly
enough. By 8:15, 150 people had
assembled in the Old Union
Courtyard. The meeting was
scheduled at the Sunday barbeque
at Lake Lagunita and announced
in leaflets distributed throughout
the campus.
Most of the early discussion at
the meeting centered on
long-range tactics for the
movement especially on how to
involve more of the Stanford
community.
Considerable attention was also
paid to the goals of the
movement. At least one hour was
spent on debate over the adoption
of a series of demands as specific
goals.
Three major demands were
proposed, although not officially
adopted. They are:
— 1) An immediate end to
ROTC on campus.
—2) A guarantee by the
University of financial aid to those
needy cadets who would lose
scholarships if ROTC were
discontinued.
—3) Legal aid from the
University to students in their last
two years of the ROTC program
who are entrapped by the
"punitive clause."
Other proposals voiced
■ncluded a campus-wide forum on

ROTC, petitions to get ROTC off
campus, and a demand of amnesty
for those arrested during protests.
It was also suggested that the
movement contribute money to
the Bobby Seale defense fund and
that it support attempts of
University workers to organize.
Decision Postponed
The final decision on these
proposals was postponed until
affinity groups meet and vote.
Leaflets were then distributed
concerning procedures for legal
defense in the event of arrest and
for first aid in the case of injury.
At about 8:45, with more than
200 people present the group
finally began discussing strategy.
A number of "Scenarios for
Victory" were presented. They
included proposals for more
daylight actions including today's
plans and for wallpapering the
ROTC building.
Other discussion emphasized
the need for increased "political
education" and discussion of
means by which ROTC can be
made too costly or bothersome
for the University and the Army
to maintain.
A call was then voiced to
maintain a set level of militancy
and after that point the tone of
the evening was established.

dispersing.
Quiet Beginning
The evening began quietly
enough. By 8:15, 150 people had
assembled in the Old Union
Courtyard. The meeting was
scheduled at the Sunday barbeque
at Lake Lagunita and announced
in leaflets distributed throughout
the campus.
Most of the early discussion at
the meeting centered on
long-range tactics for the
movement especially on how to
involve more of the Stanford
community.
Considerable attention was also
paid to the goals of the
movement. At least one hour was
spent on debate over the adoption
of a series of demands as specific
goals.
Three major demands were
proposed, although not officially
adopted. They are:
— 1) An immediate end to
ROTC on campus.
—2) A guarantee by the
University of financial aid to those
needy cadets who would lose
scholarships if ROTC were
discontinued.
—3) Legal aid from the
University to students in their last
two years of the ROTC program
who are entrapped by the
"punitive clause."
Other proposals voiced
■ncluded a campus-wide forum on

ROTC, petitions to get ROTC off
campus, and a demand of amnesty
for those arrested during protests.
It was also suggested that the
movement contribute money to
the Bobby Seale defense fund and
that it support attempts of
University workers to organize.
Decision Postponed
The final decision on these
proposals was postponed until
affinity groups meet and vote.
Leaflets were then distributed
concerning procedures for legal
defense in the event of arrest and
for first aid in the case of injury.
At about 8:45, with more than
200 people present the group
finally began discussing strategy.
A number of "Scenarios for
Victory" were presented. They
included proposals for more
daylight actions including today's
plans and for wallpapering the
ROTC building.
Other discussion emphasized
the need for increased "political
education" and discussion of
means by which ROTC can be
made too costly or bothersome
for the University and the Army
to maintain.
A call was then voiced to
maintain a set level of militancy
and after that point the tone of
the evening was established.

MORF RO'I'C HOC KS — \lhuil 250 demonstrators staged hit-and-run attacks
011 a( least five campus buildings last night as HOTC related violence
continued. At least windows were broken during last night's demonstration.
At least 55 windows were
quickly smashed by more than
250 anti-ROTC demonstrators last
night in the fifth evening of
protest against officer training.
Within 10 minutes the
well-organized radicals broke 15
windows in President Kenneth
Pitzer's office and 34 in the
Aeronautics and Astronautics
building, their two primary targets.
Uniformed police were not in
evidence, and no arrests or injuries
were reported.
The crowd, which consisted
partly of Berkeley, Foothill, and
Palo Alto High School radicals,
also shattered a few windows in
the Earth Sciences, Material
Sciences, Geology and Political
Science buildings.
At the meeting in the Old
Union courtyard prior to last
night's action, the protestors
voted to continue their
demonstrations today with a noon

rally in White Plaza to announce
the time and location of a
"mobile militant, sit-in, mill-in."
After formulating this plan, the
group voted overwhelmingly to
take some kind of immediate
''militant action." The
demonstrators then divided into
affinity groups of 15 to 20 to
discuss what to do in case of
police counter-actions.
Coordinating Council
Meanwhile two targets were
chosen by a meeting of the
"coordinating council" consisting
of a representative from each
affinity group. Choices were
then relayed back to the group
members.
By this tactic demonstrators
hoped to minimize information
leaks to police.
Organized into tight bands the
demonstrators massed for what at
first almost appeared to be a

leisurely stroll to the President's
office.
Chanting "OFF ROTC" the
radicals grouped in front of his
office on the Inner Quad for a
brief rock throwing foray.
Quick March
The demonstrators then
regrouped and marched quickly
across the Quad toward Physics
Tank, picking up more rocks
before veering toward the
Aero-Astro building. "Fast pace!
Tighten it up!" they yelled.
Responding to shouts from
within the crowd, the
demonstrators waited until all
were within striking distance of
the buildings windows before
beginning the barrage.
The sound of shattering
windows filled the air for the next
10 seconds before the crowd
moved into Lomita Drive.
Protestors then trailed back

toward the Union before
dispersing.

MORF RO'I'C HOC KS — \lhuil 250 demonstrators staged hit-and-run attacks
011 a( least five campus buildings last night as HOTC related violence
continued. At least windows were broken during last night's demonstration.
At least 55 windows were
quickly smashed by more than
250 anti-ROTC demonstrators last
night in the fifth evening of
protest against officer training.
Within 10 minutes the
well-organized radicals broke 15
windows in President Kenneth
Pitzer's office and 34 in the
Aeronautics and Astronautics
building, their two primary targets.
Uniformed police were not in
evidence, and no arrests or injuries
were reported.
The crowd, which consisted
partly of Berkeley, Foothill, and
Palo Alto High School radicals,
also shattered a few windows in
the Earth Sciences, Material
Sciences, Geology and Political
Science buildings.
At the meeting in the Old
Union courtyard prior to last
night's action, the protestors
voted to continue their
demonstrations today with a noon

rally in White Plaza to announce
the time and location of a
"mobile militant, sit-in, mill-in."
After formulating this plan, the
group voted overwhelmingly to
take some kind of immediate
''militant action." The
demonstrators then divided into
affinity groups of 15 to 20 to
discuss what to do in case of
police counter-actions.
Coordinating Council
Meanwhile two targets were
chosen by a meeting of the
"coordinating council" consisting
of a representative from each
affinity group. Choices were
then relayed back to the group
members.
By this tactic demonstrators
hoped to minimize information
leaks to police.
Organized into tight bands the
demonstrators massed for what at
first almost appeared to be a

leisurely stroll to the President's
office.
Chanting "OFF ROTC" the
radicals grouped in front of his
office on the Inner Quad for a
brief rock throwing foray.
Quick March
The demonstrators then
regrouped and marched quickly
across the Quad toward Physics
Tank, picking up more rocks
before veering toward the
Aero-Astro building. "Fast pace!
Tighten it up!" they yelled.
Responding to shouts from
within the crowd, the
demonstrators waited until all
were within striking distance of
the buildings windows before
beginning the barrage.
The sound of shattering
windows filled the air for the next
10 seconds before the crowd
moved into Lomita Drive.
Protestors then trailed back

toward the Union before
dispersing.
Quiet Beginning
The evening began quietly
enough. By 8:15, 150 people had
assembled in the Old Union
Courtyard. The meeting was
scheduled at the Sunday barbeque
at Lake Lagunita and announced
in leaflets distributed throughout
the campus.
Most of the early discussion at
the meeting centered on
long-range tactics for the
movement especially on how to
involve more of the Stanford
community.
Considerable attention was also
paid to the goals of the
movement. At least one hour was
spent on debate over the adoption
of a series of demands as specific
goals.
Three major demands were
proposed, although not officially
adopted. They are:
— 1) An immediate end to
ROTC on campus.
—2) A guarantee by the
University of financial aid to those
needy cadets who would lose
scholarships if ROTC were
discontinued.
—3) Legal aid from the
University to students in their last
two years of the ROTC program
who are entrapped by the
"punitive clause."
Other proposals voiced
■ncluded a campus-wide forum on

ROTC, petitions to get ROTC off
campus, and a demand of amnesty
for those arrested during protests.
It was also suggested that the
movement contribute money to
the Bobby Seale defense fund and
that it support attempts of
University workers to organize.
Decision Postponed
The final decision on these
proposals was postponed until
affinity groups meet and vote.
Leaflets were then distributed
concerning procedures for legal
defense in the event of arrest and
for first aid in the case of injury.
At about 8:45, with more than
200 people present the group
finally began discussing strategy.
A number of "Scenarios for
Victory" were presented. They
included proposals for more
daylight actions including today's
plans and for wallpapering the
ROTC building.
Other discussion emphasized
the need for increased "political
education" and discussion of
means by which ROTC can be
made too costly or bothersome
for the University and the Army
to maintain.
A call was then voiced to
maintain a set level of militancy
and after that point the tone of
the evening was established.
