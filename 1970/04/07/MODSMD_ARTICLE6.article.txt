# University Issues Development Report

By J ACk KAPLAN
Responding to community
criticism of Stanford land
development, the University
Relations Office yesterday issued
a report defending University
policy, promising a thorough
review of alternatives for nearly
2000 acres of unused land, but
refusing to reconsider the
Dillingham Palo Alto Square
project, Coyote Hill industrial
construction, or other
already-approved plans. Copies
have been sent to all faculty and
staff, and are in the process of
being delivered to student
residences and other campus
distribution points.
While leaving the land open
would be ideal, the report asserts,
Stanford would have to subsidize
the open space through higher
tuition, lower salaries, increased
gifts from alumni and friends, or
reduced educational programs.
The University has therefore
decided to lease some of its land,
but in such a way as to preserve
natural beauty, add relatively
little to local problems, provide
tax resources to support the
community, and allow the land to
be recaptured for academic use in
the distant future. "Noisy, dirty,"
mass manufacturing facilities are
excluded.
The people of the area, it adds,
decide how the land is to be used
through community planning
commissions and councils, open
hearings, and occasional public
referenda.
Stanford has "greatly reduced"
its income per acre, says the
report, by imposing standards of
development. The Dillingham site,
for example, could more
profitably be leased to motels,
restaurants, and shops, but
Stanford decided against such a
plan because of the greater

population density and traffic it
would create.
Vulnerable University
Paul Rupert, a representative of
Grass Roots, a student group
organized to fight peninsula land
development policies, commented
that "the University must feel
pretty vulnerable to put out such
an extensive rebuttal. The battle
will ultimately be fought out in
the hearts and minds of the
people."
The Dillingham Palo Alto
Square project, a $15 million
complex of office buildings, a
hotel, and a theatre at the corner
of El Camino and Page Mill Road,
has been a primary grievance
among Grass Roots members and
other critics of Stanford land
development.
A Grass Roots booklet, "The
Promised Land," concludes that
the Dillingham "profiteers"
ignored the big-city problems
already threatening Palo Alto:
The people of the area were not
given a chance to decide whether
they wanted it approved."
Park In Square
In defense of the project, the
University report notes that the
Square will return about
$450,000 annually in taxes to the
area, and that its construction was
unanimously approved by the
Palo Alto Planning Commission
and City Council. Moreover, says
the report, "a two-acre landscaped
park will be located between the
major buildings and 400 trees will
be planted."
The Promised Land reports that
"thirteen of the 21 acres (of the
Square) will be paved over for
parking, with -100 potted trees
spaced around t he asphalt."
The Coyote Mill industrial
construction, another subject of
recent criticism, has been under
discussion for 10 years according

to the University report. The
Promised Land states that
Stanford and Palo Alto,"
anticipating intense criticism,"
have defended the project with
"secrecy, speed and attempts at
appeasement," and that the
decision to "destroy" Coyote Hill,
is "a case study in undemocratic
decision-making."
No University Responsibility
Stanford has also come under
recent attack for not doing
enough to alleviate the area's
housing shortage, while
simultaneously adding to the
problem by aiding the growth of
industries and consequently
increasing the demand for
residences.
The report, while
acknowledging the problem,
contends that the University does
not bear the responsibility. The
housing crisis, it argues, is a "local
manifestation of a national
problem," resulting from the
"high cost of money, land, labor,
and materials."
Of Stanford's BHOO acres, 910
have been leased, an additional
21H have been annexed to
neighboring cities in preparation
for being leased, and 665 have
been condemned for public use.
Another 177.3 acres are currently
unused and under review. The
remainder, over 5200 acres,
comprises the Academic
Reserveâ€”land set aside for
educational purposes. Much of the
Academic Reserve is open land.
Unused land is a financial
burden to the University, since
property taxes must be paid even
though the land earns no income.
Taxes can be minimized, says the
report, by placing the land within
the Academic Reserve, or in
agricultural greenbelt zones.
To place land within the
Academic Reserve, Stanford must
demonstrate to the county tax
assessor that the land is being put
to educational use.
Placing land in agricultural
greenbelt zones involves complex
legal problems, according to the
report, and that alternative is
being carefully investigated. Back
taxes and penalties would
probably be incurred if Stanford
later tried to recover the property
of education or development.
The Founding Grant prohibits
Stanford from setting aside land
for public parks.

Stanford has not screened
tenants on the basis of social
desireability, says the report,
because the term is hard to define
and changes with the times. "A
more feasible approach is a roster
of tenants broadly representative
of the diversity of American
industry.
The University Committee on
Land and Building Development,
a faculty-student advisory body,
will hold an open forum on land
use tomorrow night at 7:30 in the
Forum Room of the
Undergraduate Library.
