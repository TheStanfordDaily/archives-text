## Lament For Flab Departed 
### Nick Selby 
A close friend noticed recently that his jowls had begun to
droop with the unaccustomed weight of extra poundage.
Indeed, the normal sharpness of his cheekbones had been
effaced into cherubic softness, and around his middle, those
appendages so tenderly known as "love handles," i.e., the
accumulated rings of flab above the pelvis, made it quite impossible
for him to tuck in his shirt.
At first, as he began to lessen the notch of his belt, Horace (not
his real name) was quite unaffected by his growth. "Guess I'm
getting old after all," he mused. Horace is barely 22.
We always knew that Horace had been blessed with the most
prodigious appetite this side of lloss Cartwright. The mere mention
of roast beef, cracked crab, or steak tartare set his mind and
stomach churning in near gluttonous anticipation.
Glowing Eyes
Add to this menu the thought of duck a I'orange or Cornish
game hens topped with black pitted cherries in a wine sauce and
you can imagine how his eyes would glow, how his moustache
would roll back above his lips as he grinned.
In Horace, to be sure, the appetites for knowledge and excellent
cuisine, heretofore thought mutually exclusive, had been blended
to the most harmonious and delightful degree. He pored over his
thick tomes, scanning the thought of centuries, with a relish
unequalled by anything but the way he tore into a crown roast of
lamb chops.
Never have you discovered such an appetite. It is said that
Horace would actually perspire while eating. Those shiny beads of
sweat, glistening across his tall forehead, were in fact the greatest
compliment any would-be chef could receive. I myself have seen
him perspire over a bowl of jello.
Alas! As all good meals must someday end, so did Horace find
that his years-long debauche must know the iron gate of restraint.
"Really, I must do something about this," he determined a bit
half-heartedly.
The Fatal Word
So as Horace, a Stanford undergraduate, lay savoring the
evening's dinner one night, he turned beneath the heavy quilts and
whispered gently to his wife Carolyn, who surely must have been
asleep:
"Sweetie, I've been thinking," he muttered, half to himself, "I
think . . that perhaps . . . well, maybe ... at some time in the

future, not tomorrow ... I should put myself (here he shuddered
with dread) ... on a diet."
The fatal work. Eureka! as if a thunderbolt had struck their
duplex home, as il the last day had come and the long-awaited
Messiah stood knocking at their bedroom door, his wife Carolyn
I lew out of bed with a joyous shriek:
"GOOD! I've got it all planned out, no potatoes, no French
bread, no peanut butter, no bananas, no artichokes, no
Hollandsise, no balogna, no spaghetti, no strawberries .. ."
Endless Proscriptions
Carolyn s list was interminable. The first rays of dawn struck the
lemon trees outside their house as she finished. A waking
nightmare for our friend Horace, whose one slip of the tongue had
provoked the onslaught. A medical authority was consulted, for
Horace determined that his wife's diet did not even allow him
oxygen, so proscriptive it seemed. The doctor reportedly Horace's
father, did little better: only protein (meat, egg whites, non-fat
cheese, etc.) and water, lots ol it, eight glasses of water a day at
least, were permitted.
O wondrous flab, whence art thou departed? Horace resigned
himself to the worst. Aside from a few whines off "How about a
hot fudge chocolate sundae, with pistachio nuts and a Marachino
cherry?" Horace remained meek and quiet under his wife's stern
eye.
The Urge To Ouil
At first, to his ultimate horror, Horace gained weight. "I'm
quitting this, it doesn't work," he pleaded before Carolyn's feet.
"NO YOU'RE NOT!" she replied calmly, and as women do usually
have the last word, that was that: the diet stayed and the
refrigerator, once raided nightly, continued bereft of goodies.
Ah the miracle of faith! After about a week of this torture,
Horace has lost five whole pounds. He still prowls around looking
for hidden snacks, but his extectations go unfulfilled. His goal is a
total of fifteen pounds.
He may yet reach this lofty peak of abstinence. And if he does, I
shall help him celebrate: two of Kirk's jumbo cheeseburgers, three
orders of French fries, and a double raspberry milkshake. Go to it,
Horace: your brow shall bead once more.
