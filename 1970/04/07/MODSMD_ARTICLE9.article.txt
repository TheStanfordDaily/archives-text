ROTC Rebuttal
I wrote the story "Creditless
ROTC Possible" th;it Vice Provost
responded to in yesterday's Daily
letters section. There are several
implications in his response that
need clarification.
His letter related what General
C.P. Hannum, head of Army
ROTC, claims he told me in the
interview I had with him last
week. Brooks' quotations are
substantially correct and in fact
substantiate the accuracy of the
story I wrote.
The only apparent particular in
which Brooks' account of his
conversation differs from my
account of my interview is
implied in the following quotation
from Brooks' letter.
"Any quote or inference in the
Daily article which states that
with strong institutional support
the Army will stay on any campus
regardless of the form of ROTC is
incorrect."
I had quoted him as saying that
ROTC would stay "om any
campus as long as it was wanted,
regardless of form."
Another quotation in the
article re d, "Army ROTC is the
of the University and we
will stay (on campus) as long as
we are wanted. The academic
credit issue is only one small issue
involved."
Mannum's general statements
to me on ROTC are reported fully
in this and other passages of my
story. They are accurate and
porti iv the sense of our

discussion.
The question then is what
Hannum meant in implying that
ROTC might leave a campus at
which it had institutional support
but at which its form was
unsatisfactory.
Hannum's statements are more
understandable in light of two
things.
First, the General is in a
difficult situation in which any
statement such as that he made to
me would put the army in a
difficult bargaining position with
other universities.
And, second, what Hannum
really meant seems clearer in light
of the rest of my interview with
him.
I had originally called him at
the suggestion of the Washington
University (at St. Louis) Army
ROTC commander to verify his
private and public statements that
ROTC "would remain (at
Washington U) as long as the
University wanted it to." Hannum
verified the commanders'
statements.
It is interesting to note that at
the time of our discussions
Washington University radicals
were breaking windows at their
ROTC building. Also that
University's ROTC program
received credit only in the
engineering department, !n fact,
the university commander's public
statements about staying on the
campus were made at a lime when
the engineering school faculty was
considering taking away its last
credit

That situation seems much the
same as that which exists here.
The facts still stand. Stanford
' > ersity could have negotiated a
edit Army ROTC' contract,
l u did not. Statements by
President Pit/.er and Howard
Brooks indicate, however that
they did not think this possible. I
challenge either of them to prove
their assert ions.
Kill Inivoin'l
Why ROTC Should (i<>
Professor George Wald was
unable to condemn ROTC
whole-heartedly on Thursday
night, although he wished military
training to take place elsewhere
than on university campuses. He
could foresee circumstances in
which soldiers would be needed,
and he wanted to be able to
'choose his wars.' World War II
was a case in point. There, he said,
he was concerned only that our
soldiers do their job well. Did he
accept the military necessity of
Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
I doubt it. But while he may have
regretted the occurrence he had to
accept the fact. The truth is that
if one accepts the doctrine of the
"just war" between national states
one has to accept, in one way or
another, the Dresdens, Hiroshimas
and Nagasakis that inevitably go
with it (perhaps as repayment of
Warsaw, Bclscn, Ausschwitz, etc.).
And today, of course, one has to
accept the possibility of mutual
megadest ruct ion.
One does not have to Iv a
complete pacifist to see that there

is a certain inconsistency in
objecting to what our military
forces are doing in Vietnam and at
the same time allowing for
circumstances in which military
destruction at this or even a
higher level would be justified
because directed at a real enemy.
There are already millions of
people in the U.S.A. who consider
the destruction of Vietnam
regrettable but necessary, the real
enemy being Russia or perhaps
China. Like inquisitors they burn
in order to save. There always are
such people, in any war, on both
sides.
I repeat, one does not have to
be a complete pacifist to reject
totally the principle that wars
between national states are
justified under special
circumstances (which are always
to be found, on both sides). The
use of violence by an oppressed
people against its oppressors is
quite another matter. But as for
the wars that have been
stage-managed during the past one
hundred years or so with the aid
<>l military conscription by special
interest groups in control of the
machinery of national states there
is only one answer, and that is a
total refusal on the part of an
enlighted youth to serve. And this
is why HOTC should go not
merely off campus but into
oblivion, along with the system of
military conscription that has
plagued the West since the
Napoleonic wars.
