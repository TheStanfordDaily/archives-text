You are invited to come to a weekend session at
the INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF NONVIOLENCE -
LAND: FOR LIFE OR DEATH?
April 17-19
The history of the Mid-Peninsula reflects the history of Ameri
can warfare. The land has increasingly been used for the pur
pose of inventing, developing, and manufacturing weapons
of war. In this session we will examine the use of land in the
Mid-Peninsula and the way in which decisions have been
made about land use. The emphasis will be on studying the
phenomenal growth of war-related industries in this area that
has been made possible by these decisions. We will look
closely at the perilous social problems that have been created
and are perpetuated by rapid and unchecked industrialization.
Using the example of the Mid-Peninsula, we will explore the
concept of democratic control of land use, how this process
might be achieved, how it would work, and how it might be
possible to use the land in this area to serve the needs of thjfr
larger community. v
If you would like to participate in this session, please call
