# As Chappie Head
## Asks Sweeney To Quit 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The former editor of Chapparal
asked Monday that Michael
Sweeney resign as President of
Hammer and Coffin Society, the
publishers of the Stanford
magazine.
Bernard Gould, Permanent
Secretary of Hammer and Coffin
Society, Stanford founding
chapter, and 1930-1932
Chapparal, editor charged in a
letter to Sweeney that his "use of
Chapparal, and the personally-led
actions which followed, climaxing
in criminal vandalism during the
last few days and nights, are
resulting in irretrievable damage
to the honorable reputation the
the 70-vear tradition of the
Stanford Chapparal. .
Gould noted that Sweeney was
not registered in Stanford
University for the current Spring
quarter and therefore, "cannot
legally function as either Editor or
as the President of Hammer and
Coffin, Stanford chapter; You
cannot vote in an election of your
successor. .
Reply
Replying to the charges
yesterday, Sweeney called the
demand for his resignation, "one
man's authoritarian fantasy." He
states that the "national Hammer
and Coffin Society" as he referred
to the Stanford founding chapter,
had no power to make such
requests and that Gould's office
was purely honorary.
"We are currently choosing the
new president of Hammer and
Coffin Society and we will
announce our decision at the end
of April," Sweeney concluded.
A humor magazine for most of
its seventy years, Chapparal
published only one issue last year
and folded with a debt to
A.S.S.U. of $16,000.
Endorsed Sweeney
At that time, Gould states,
Sweeney approached him and

other concerned former Chappies
with "an intelligent and
comprehensive plan for
continuance of Chapparal. The
group used funds in the Hammer
and Coffin Trust to pay off the
debt endorsed the election of
Sweeney to the presidency of
Hammer and Coffin, and arranged
for $3500 of the Trust to go to
Sweeney for "technical
equipment."
The alumni apparently knew of
Sweeney's radical background,
but felt the magazine's future
editorial policy should not
influence their decision to endorse
him. Even yesterday Gould said,
"The point os the disagreement of
not the editorial content of the
ROTC issue as such. .

The call for Sweeney's
resignation came at a time when
Chapparal is rumored to once
again be in financial difficulties.
The magazine owes ASSU
Publications Board $600 for use
of the ASSU Type Shop. ASSU
Financial Manager David Swift has
stopped credit for Chapparal in
the Student Organizations Fund
until it has collected its accounts
receivable (n)oney owed to the
magazine for past advertising.)
However, Sweeney said
yesterday that the Chapparal
would continue to publish. He
claimed that over $400 had been
received in accounts receivable in
the last few weeks and predicted
his publication will finish in the
black.
