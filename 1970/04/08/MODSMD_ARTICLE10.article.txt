# Make Your Own Life
## Individuals And Fraternities 
### Wayne E. Miller 
Monday night I sat and listened to
representatives from various affinity groups
present a variety of scenarios on how to off ROTC
from Stanford. I went primarily to learn, but
secondly because I refuse to let anyone make
decisions that directly effect me for me, I don't
want the path of my life determined by default.
I sat among a considerable contingent of
sympathetic high school students who had, quite
clearly, come to throw rocks. They were not
disappointed. That many of the students around
me were incapable of articulating why they were
there angered me. But mostly I just felt frustrated,
for it seemed that, the more passive elements of the
"people's democracy" could not compete with the
inherently more vocal militant interests.
Tuesday morning I read David Morgan's expose
of the "lie of brotherhood." It was an article
which 1 feel might have been better left unwritten,
not because it was untruthful (I don't argue that
either way), but because consciously or
unconsciously he implied that his experience and
circumstances were some how typical of all
fraternities.
I take exception to his remark that because
actives have a "vested interest" in the fraternity
that the rushee will not get a straight answer from
him. That's bullshit. What connection has the
Monday night meeting and David Morgan's article?
Both underline the single greatest, misconception
about fraternities, and their greatest fault. What is
killing fraternities is an attitude, a question: What
are fraternities going to do for me? It is an attitude
I have fought in my own house for throe years and
one I see all too often in rushees. The answer is
that fraternities won't do one thing for you; you
have to make your own life.
A frat,Â« initv is not a mother-father substitute, it

won t spoon leed you sex anu social involvement,
it won't teach you to think. Yes, it can and does
too often become an island. But is that the fault of
the fraternity or the individual? The opportunities
have been there for those individuals in Stanford's
fraternities who have chosen to look.
Activities
This year members of Stanford's fraternities
h;ive organized a Watt's workshop, participated in
research at Stanford Medical School, tutored high
school and grammar school children in Palo Alto
and Mountain View, served as "big brothers" to
delinquents, visited convicts families, worked with
retarded children and organized a variety of
seminars. A fraternity is not a dorm or an
apartment it is an organization and it demands of
its members commitment to its use, it is strong
only as long as it is used.
Unlike the "movement," the fraternity is a
durable organization. Its durability is strengthened
by the existence of a "house" and the "alumnae,"
which formalize the institution. Its direction is
highly responsive to those individuals work within
it, thus for those individuals who cannot support
the militancy of the movement, yet feel a deep
commitment to social change, the fraternity
provides an opportunity to participate in and
change the fraternities themselves and to use thy
fraternity organization for greater external social
involvement.
Participate in Hush
I encourage all freshmen not to except at face
value what I or anyone has said about fraternities.
Participate in rush, examine each fraternity as the
unique group of individuals that it is. But if you
are interested in fraternities purely for what each
may offer you, forget it. We don't need you.
