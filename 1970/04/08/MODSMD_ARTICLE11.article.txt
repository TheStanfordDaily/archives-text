# GM And The Stanford Faculty
## 'An Ancient Vending Machine' 
### Robert Spencer 
Last Thursday the Stanford
faculty exonerated itself of all
charges of academic
responsibility.
Professor Ronald Rebholz
introduced a resolution before the
Academic Senate requesting that
the Board of Trustees vote
Stanford's 21,189 shares of
General Motors stock in
opposition to management on two
propositions appearing on the GM
proxy ballot. These two proposals
advocate 1) the expansion of the
GM Board of Directors from 24
members to 27, and 2) the
establishment ot a Stockholder's
Committee for Corporate
Responsibility.
The first measure is intended
to provide directorships for Rev.
Channing Philips, minorities
representative; Betty Furness,
consumer vigilante; and Rene

Dubos, ecologist, on the GM
Board without removing any of
the present directors. A
Nader-backed organization plans
to place these three in nomination
should the resolution pass.
The second proposal represents
a genuine attempt to reform
corporate practices "within the
system." It calls for the formation
of an ad hoc committee to
scrutinize GM corporate policies,
and the issuance of a committee
report to all GM stockholders by
1971.
Innocuously Unendorsed
It is difficult to conceive of
two more innocuous resolutions.
The Academic Senate refused
to endorse, 21-14.
More dismaying than the vote
was the quality of argument
advanced in opposition. Professor
George Bach of the Business

School expressed uneasiness over
the promotion of
stockholder-management conflict
through proposals such as these,
apparently discounting the
sanguinary carnage wreaked
during a healthy proxy fight.
Bach Unmoved
Bach was also the source of
that simplistic argument one never
fails to encounter: "It's not our
problem." Presumably, it would
require a lethal atmosphere, a
ravished countryside, gutted
cities, and screaming hordes
pouring down Palm Drive before
George Leland Bach would raise
his eyebrows and take note of
what was happening in the
world about him.
One other worthy opposed
involvement on the grounds that
it might embroil Stanford in
thousands of similar conflicts. But
the University does not own

thousands of issues of common
stock. Nor is it likely that many
concerned citizens will be
prepared to ante up the tens of
thousands of dollars necessary to
force placement of
counter-management proposals on
proxy ballots, or to publicize such
campaigns.
One member of the Senate,
Professor Kline, had served on a
GM-organized committee to
investigate smog control
techniques and implementation.
He supported the Senate
resolution, asserting that
management required external
prodding before it would initiate
reform. The Senate wasn't
interested.
Already Considered
President Pitzer spoke against
th Rebholz resolution,
disingenuously remarking that if
its purpose was to bring the issue
to the attention of the Trustees, it
was unnecessary, as consideration
of the dispensation of the GM
proxy ballots had already been
placed on the Trustees' agenda.
The aim of the Senate
proposition was patently not to
focus attention, but rather was to
marshal support for a favorable
disposition of the resolutions.
Another of the University
constituencies, through the ASSU

Senate, had already passed a
resolution in support.
Pitzer's opposition is curious,
since he previously pledged that
the University Land and Building"
Development Committee would
henceforth consider social
consequences before making its
decisions. Consistency requires
that the Board of Trustees be
bound by an identical policy in
discharging its jiduciary I
responsibilities.
Mythical Channels
Attempts to dissuade radicals J
from violent action have always j
incorporated the admonition to j
work through established ,
channels. It appears that these
"channels" are a perpetrated
myth. As ROTC demonstrated,
even when you win, you lose. And
now, a far more temperate
proposal, an appeal to support
corporate reform, has been
repudiated by the Academic
Senate and almost certainly will
be by the Board of Trustees when
they convene on April 13.
Perhaps Tom Hayden's
"dinosaur" metaphor is apropos
to our own University power
structure. Evidence of ossification
is rampant. Like an ancient
vending machine, our
administration may just require a
little kick to make it work.
