# America From A Train
## The 						Crucial Factor 
### Lang Atwood 
WASHINGTON—The Penn Central railroad with
the prodding and financial assistance of the
Department of Transportation is now operating a
limited number of high-speed trains along the New
York-Baltimore-Washington corridor.
It is now possible to go from downtown New
York to central Washington in two and a half
hours aboard the 120 mile per hour Metroliner.
This compares favorably with total time spent
trying to fly over the same route; in bad weather
or heavy traffic in the air or on the freeways the
train beats the planes.
The Metroliner has been hailed by some as the
answer to some of our future transportation
problems.
The train itself is a sleek, 21st century
appearing vehicle, the pride of the Penn Central.
All of the cars are very luxurious, vaguely
resembling the first class cabin of a jet only more
spacious. A snack-bar car operated by the
railroad's traditional black steward (why?)
dispensed over-priced food and Bell Telephone
even had a radio-telephone booth on the train.
As the Metroliner emerged from its slow
journey under Manhattan and the East River, an
auto junkyard instantly appeared on the right. It
was quickly followed by brown fields of broken
equipment of various types and the drab concrete
ribbon of a freeway. The train passed an
autotransporter loaded with new cars inching
along the crowded freeway. Off to the left,
smokestacks emitted little plumes of dirty smoke.
The train picked up speed and darted under
another freeway. Suburbia appeared on the right,
while factories dominated the view out the other
side. Slowly the Metroliner passed a commuter
train, No. 682, packed full of people returning to
the quiet communities surrounding New York.
Suddenly the train seemed to be heading
through the backyards of a city. (Do the tracks

always go through the bad part of town?) A
blackened factory stood silent. An abandoned car
saluted the Metroliner with its upraised trunk.
A sort of Daly City-East appeared. Row after
row of neat look-alike houses in pastel colors lined
the right-of-way. They passed by quickly to be
replaced by more ugly factories which gave way to
a simple rural landscape.
Speeding thru a city a neon sign flashed,
"Bar-liquors," "Bar-liquors." The train swept past
"Johnson & Johnson"—neat, clean and sterile. The
countryside continued to roll by: naked trees, a
small town and some horses feeding by a pond.
Farms, stark and simple, dotted the gentle hills
marred only by a powerline.
Near Washington the signs reappeared,
"Gas-28.9c," "Longshore Auto Sales." And the
red arrow flashed thru the repeating
"SUNOCO-SUNOCO-SUNOCO." Before entering
Union Station one final advertisement appeared,
"Buy American."
Most of the passengers on that train were
businessmen or government officials. They paid
scant attention to the views that raced passed their
windows.
They prefer to minimize or ignore the alarms
that our environment is deteriorating and our
society pulling apart. To them ecology means
politics, a new popular issue to revitalize the
Democrats and strengthen the Republicans. Each
is trying to out do the other, but not to save the
world or man. Instead they seek only to increase
and consolidate their power.
This stranglehold will not be broken until the
people serve notice that they are no longer willing
to have politics be the crucial factor in making
decisions with such immense ramifications.

auto junkyard instantly appeared on the right. It
was quickly followed by brown fields of broken
equipment of various types and the drab concrete
ribbon of a freeway. The train passed an
autotransporter loaded with new cars inching
along the crowded freeway. Off to the left,
smokestacks emitted little plumes of dirty smoke.
The train picked up speed and darted under
another freeway. Suburbia appeared on the right,
while factories dominated the view out the other
side. Slowly the Metroliner passed a commuter
train, No. 682, packed full of people returning to
the quiet communities surrounding New York.
Suddenly the train seemed to be heading
through the backyards of a city. (Do the tracks

always go through the bad part of town?) A
blackened factory stood silent. An abandoned car
saluted the Metroliner with its upraised trunk.
A sort of Daly City-East appeared. Row after
row of neat look-alike houses in pastel colors lined
the right-of-way. They passed by quickly to be
replaced by more ugly factories which gave way to
a simple rural landscape.
Speeding thru a city a neon sign flashed,
"Bar-liquors," "Bar-liquors." The train swept past
"Johnson & Johnson"—neat, clean and sterile. The
countryside continued to roll by: naked trees, a
small town and some horses feeding by a pond.
Farms, stark and simple, dotted the gentle hills
marred only by a powerline.
Near Washington the signs reappeared,
"Gas-28.9c," "Longshore Auto Sales." And the
red arrow flashed thru the repeating
"SUNOCO-SUNOCO-SUNOCO." Before entering
Union Station one final advertisement appeared,
"Buy American."
Most of the passengers on that train were
businessmen or government officials. They paid
scant attention to the views that raced passed their
windows.
They prefer to minimize or ignore the alarms
that our environment is deteriorating and our
society pulling apart. To them ecology means
politics, a new popular issue to revitalize the
Democrats and strengthen the Republicans. Each
is trying to out do the other, but not to save the
world or man. Instead they seek only to increase
and consolidate their power.
This stranglehold will not be broken until the
people serve notice that they are no longer willing
to have politics be the crucial factor in making
decisions with such immense ramifications.

WASHINGTON—The Penn Central railroad with
the prodding and financial assistance of the
Department of Transportation is now operating a
limited number of high-speed trains along the New
York-Baltimore-Washington corridor.
It is now possible to go from downtown New
York to central Washington in two and a half
hours aboard the 120 mile per hour Metroliner.
This compares favorably with total time spent
trying to fly over the same route; in bad weather
or heavy traffic in the air or on the freeways the
train beats the planes.
The Metroliner has been hailed by some as the
answer to some of our future transportation
problems.
The train itself is a sleek, 21st century
appearing vehicle, the pride of the Penn Central.
All of the cars are very luxurious, vaguely
resembling the first class cabin of a jet only more
spacious. A snack-bar car operated by the
railroad's traditional black steward (why?)
dispensed over-priced food and Bell Telephone
even had a radio-telephone booth on the train.
As the Metroliner emerged from its slow
journey under Manhattan and the East River, an
auto junkyard instantly appeared on the right. It
