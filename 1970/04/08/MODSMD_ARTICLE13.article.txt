For all anyone reading the CHRON knows, the Berkeleyites, the
Foothillers, et. al., who are so selflessly giving their nocturnal services
to Stanford represent the will of all of us. Do they? The motion is
being carried for lack of opposition.
People, get off your arses and do something. If the mob doesn't
march for you, stand up and say so. If it does, at least have the guts to
pick up your own rock and get out there. The mob is using your good
name, and you are neither calling the presumption nor earning the
privilege.
Where do you stand, Stanford? Do the outsiders and your
minorities really speak for you?
