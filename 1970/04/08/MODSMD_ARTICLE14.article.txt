# Trustees Approve
## 1970-71 Budget Set 
### DICK BUXTON 
A 197 0-71 University
operating budget of $57,103,000
was approved by the Board of
Trustees at its meeting last March.
This budget is an increase of
$4,819,000 over the current year.
The budget includes plans for a
new golf course, remodelling of
the Main Library, and additional
athletic facilities to be built near
Maples Pavillion.
Income for next year is
expected to be $55,617,000 and
the deficit will be made up from
budget savings and income
improvement, prior years'
unrestricted gifts, and funds from
the Pace Campaign's matching
grant from the Ford Foundation.
The Budget Adjustment
Program (BAP), which is seeking a
total reduction in spending of
$2,500,000 by 1974-75 set a
reduction goal of $950,000 for
the current year and achieved a
reduction of $978,000. Raymond
Bachette, Assistant Provost, said
that in planning for future
reductions the Provost's office
must continually be more
analytical in deciding where
budget reduction money can
come from with the least
reduction in quality. Evaluation
and planning have begun for an

approximate reduction goal of
$750,000 for next year.
Budget Reductions
Reductions in the operating
budget come from elimination of
faculty and other personnel
positions, expenditure shifts from
unrestricted to available restricted
funds, decreases in expenditures
such as faculty travelers using
hotels that give academic
discounts or increases in student
charges such ..s in the Overseas
Campus program. One probable
increase in charges for students
overseas will be an increase in the
field trip fee with a decrease in
university subsidy for the trips.
The operating budget includes
schools and departments, libraries
and insi-tutions, student services,
student aid under the Provost and
business under the Vice-President
for Business and the Vice
President for Finance.
Golf Course
The Trustees in further action
authorized a lease with Ross
Chamberlain, George Lane, and
Lyle Gray for an 18-hole par 3
public gold course and driving
range in the vicinity of Deer
Gulch Creek below Coyote Hill.
Boyd Smith, Manager of Real
Estate, said that the 55-acre site
has been considered for a public
gold course by the University for
over 10 years as a means to
preserve the creek and trees in the
area. In order to remain tax-free
institution Stanford could not
develop the land itself as a public
course and has been looking for a
developer. Ross Chamberlain is a
Stanford alumnus, Lyle Gray, a
well-known golfer at the Stanford
Golf Course and George Lane is a
Golf Course developer from Los
Angeles.
Smith said, "The land is being
developed for income as well as
aesthetics." He said that if
developed as a park, for example,
taxes of $10-15,000 a year would
still be assessed on the land. He
said that the City of Palo Alto did
not wish to develop a park on the
site because the city has systems
in the Bay Area.
Lighting of the course for night
playing was proposed by the

developers but rejected by
Stanford because of the
annoyance it might cause nearby
residents. Smith said that
Stanford will receive income from
the lease and a percentage of the
gross income of the public course,
driving range and concessions.
Library Remodeling
The Board of Trustees also
approved construction and
remodeling totaling $ 1,260,000 in
the Main Library, primarily to
bring the building into compliance
with fire regulations
Philip Leighton, building
projects manager of the library,
said that the remodeling, which
will begin in August, will include
installation of fire sprinkling
systems and the construction of
fire stairs in the main stacks.
Leighton said that the
remodeling plans are necessary to
avoid closing of the building by
the fire marshall.
Leighton said that plans for a
new library addition to be built
behind the present Main Library
have been approved pending
funding. He added that if the new
structure, which will house main
collections, administrative offices
and small groups, is completed in
about three years other
alternatives for storage space for
the expandion library collections
will not have to be used.
He stressed fears, however, that
if the new building cannot be
funded and built storage
alternatives may include further
use of the Undergraduate Library
Basement, possible warehouse
storage near the physical plant, or
re-use of the old pavilion.
Pools and Courts
The Trustees authorized plans
for construction of two
swimming pools, handball and
squash courts, and additional
locker and shower facilities within
a budget of $2,085,000 to be
financed from gift funds specified
for these constructions.
The complete operating budget
of the University will be published
within the next two weeks.
