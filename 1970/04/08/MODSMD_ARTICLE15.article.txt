# Students Clubbed At Cal ROTC Clash
## 
### 
One person was arrested and several demonstrators injured in an
anti-ROTC demonstration at U.C. Berkeley yesterday.
A non-student was charged with "interference" by campus police
and held on $'200 bond.
A noon rally in Sproul Plaza heard three speakers from radical
groups, then marched on Callahan Hall, headquarters of ROTC. A line
of two dozen campus police met the march near Edwards Field, where
the arrest was made and several students were clubbed.
The march then turned to Harmon Gymnasium, where an ROTC
class was in session. Disrupting the class, some demonstrators
attempted to obtain entry to the ROTC arsenal in the basement, where
they were turned away by police. There were unverified reports of
further clubbings in the basement, and police then cleared the first
floor of demonstrators.
A small meeting outside Harmon called for a mass meeting for the
evening, also planning further disruption Thursday when ROTC drill is
held on Edwards Field.
