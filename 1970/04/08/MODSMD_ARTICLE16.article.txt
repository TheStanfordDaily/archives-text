# Mock Trials Offer Fun, Law Practice
## 
### 
Some of the best
entertainment on campus has
been playing for free this year in
the Law School, usually on
Thursday nights.
The trials, sponsored by
Serjeants at Law, a student
organization, feature law students
before real judges and
undergraduate juries. The cases
run the gamut from the sexually
erotic to those dealing with
existential philosophy.
Some of this quarter's
highlights will be the trial on
Thursday, April 30 of Michael
Sarrizan for shooting Jane Fonda
in the movie "They Shoot Horses
Don't They?" For hockey fans,
Ted Green of the Boston Bruins
will sue Wayne Maki of the St.
Louis Blues for Maki's breaking of
a hockey stick over Green's head
in a hockey fight last September.
That trial will be on Wednesday,
April 15.
Other trials will include an
auto-pedestrian accident, on April

9; an airplane crash, on April 23,
the trial of a doctor for
pronouncing a man dead and
removing his heart for a
transplant, on May 7; and the trial
of a 65 year old man being treated
with L-dopa (a new drug being
used in the treatment of
Parkinson's Disease, and which is
possibly an aphrodisiac), who
rapes his nurse, on May 14.
The last trial of the year will be
on Saturday, May 16 when the
owner of the Cocoanut Grove, a
Boston night club which burned
down in 1945 killing more than
400 persons, will be tried for
negligence.
Trials start at 7:30 in the Law
School Moot Courtroom on the
third floor of the Law School.
The trials have their full quota of
excitement and usually plenty of
humor.
