# Stanford Overseas Selection Based On Modified GPA
## 
### LAURIE HORN 
Now that this year's selection
for Overseas Campuses has been
made, the Committee on Foreign
Study Programs is planning to
review what its policy will be for
next year's groups. As usual,
protests from disgruntled students
have led the Overseas Office to
reconsider the present system.
This year's selections were
made on the basis of policy set by
the now-extinct Subcommittee on
Overseas Campuses of the General
Studies Committee. Applications
were read by a selection
committee of four men: Robert
Walker, Director of the Overseas
Campuses; Robert Hamrdla,
Assistant Director; John Hanson,
Associate Dean of Students; and
Doug Davis, Special Assistant to
the Provost According to
Hamrdla, the main criterion used
for selection is a system he calls
"modified gpa."

"We have to make one basic
assumption," he said, "that, on
the whole, given the spectrum of
Stanford students, the person
with a high gpa who is stabilized
in his studies is probably better
equipped to profit from Stanford
Overseas."
Under "modified gpa," the
importance of gpa as a factor in
selection depends on the amount
of competition for places
available. Austria, Britain, France,
and Germany each have room for
80 people; Italy has room for 88.
When there are fewer applicants
than openings, everybody who
applies and is qualified generally
goes. If more people apply than
can be accepted, though, those
with the highest gpa are selected
first.
There are difficulties, though,
with choosing people on the basis
of gpa alone. Incompletes or
heavy course loads can sometimes
make gpa an unfair reflection of a
student's status. Since the
university counts incompletes as
F's until they are made up,
incompletes have' cometimes
pulled gpa's below the cutoff
point.
In the same way, ambitious
course loads have pulled gpa's way
down. Still, Hamrdla claims that
this year he reconsidered ten
applications of students who
made up incompletes during
winter quarter after they had filed
their applications. He stresses that
the system is called modified gpa:
"I think there's a general
misconception that we love gpa as
a marvelous indicator of how to
pick people."
Borderline Cases
"About 20%" of the people
selected in the high-competition
groups are what Hamrdla calls
"borderline cases." These are
students whose gpa is close to the
cutoff, but who may have
scheduling problems or special
interests which weigh in their
favor.
"What do you do," says
Hamrdla, "about the nursing

student who knows that the
nursing school won't let her go
any time but her sophomore
year?"
Advanced standing in foreign
language study may also throw a
decision in a student's favor. In
addition, the committee generally
favors upperclassmen, who may
not have a chance to apply again.
Makeup Not Affected
Contrary to rumors, the policy
of favoring upperclassmen in
borderline cases has not seriously
affected the makeup of the
overseas campuses. Hamrdla
estimates that sixty percent of the
students overseas are
sophomores-people who applied
in their freshman year.
"As a general rule," Hamrdla
exnlainc. "those sessions which
are most popular tend to be
'older,' simply because more
people don't get accepted the first
time around."
Alternatives Considered
Hamrdla is still very conscious
that the present system is
sometimes unjust to "borderline"
applicants. He says that the
Committee on Foreign Study
Programs will probably consider
at least two alternatives are
selection by interview, or
selection by random. Both have
inherent difficulties. Interviewing
would take too much time and
depend solely on the subjective
judgement of the interviewer.
A random system on the other
hand, would solve the problem of
subjectivity. At the same time,
though, it might sacrifice fairness
in special cases, such as that of the
nursing student.
Hamrdla claims the main
problem irking the Overseas
Office isn't that of selection.
Instead the offices trouble springs
from students who persist in
mystifying its goings-on to the
point where rumor is believed
more readily than fact.
"If people says Hamrdla, really
want to find out what is going on,
we encourage them to come in
and ask."
