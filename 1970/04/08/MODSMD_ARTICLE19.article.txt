# A 						Nixon Flub: Diamond Fan Jilted
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
In what seems to be a
consistent pattern of executive
arrogance, President Nixon has
again alienated a large segment of
the American people by refusing
to acknowledge national
priorities. .
Although his administration is
barely a year old, the President
has continually rebuked
significant strains of public
opinion in regard to the ABM, the
manned space program, HEW
appropriations, race relations, and
the role of the United States in
Southeast Asia.
Last week, Nixon again defied
the public will be refusing to
throw out the ball that
inaugurated the 1970 major
league baseball season. Relying
heavily on the southern strategy
that many think won him the
election, Mr. Nixon not only
chose to ignore the national
pastime in favor of sectional
courting, but also refused to send
Vice-President Agnew in his place,
making it the first time since 1945
that neither of the top men in
Washington was present on
opening day.
Nixon's light treatment of
national priorities raises serious
questions about his ability to
fulfill the mandate that he
received in 1968. Baseball is an
American institution - one that is
now entering its second century
of existence.
Why should its opening day
ceremonies be marred by the
presence of David Eisenhower, a
22-year-old radical who has
threatened to boycott his own

graduation:
It is clear that x in his haste to
placate the multitude of
Americans, President Nixon's
selection of Mr. Eisenhower
further embittered the American
majority that is fed up with the
nation's youth. On the basis of
this decision, made at such a
crucial time, for reasons grounded
in political opportunism, can it be
safely asserted that Richard Nixon
is qualified to be the President of
the United States?
Embarrassed Nixon spokesmen
are now saying that the President
really did send Spiro Agnew to
the game, but that the
Vice-President confused the two
groups of Washington Senators.
Nixon's advisers are also saying
that he does not intend to attend
David Eisenhower's graduation.
But all this appears to be hasty
political patchwork, unlike the
slick professionalism for which
the Nixon Administration is
noted.
It is ironic that the questioning
of Nixon's qualifications has come
to light in his own ballpark, for
the President is certainly an avid
sportsman. But public will and
national sentiment can only be
ignored temporarily.
The forces of baseball have
been around for one hundred
years; President Nixon, for little
more than half that long. And one
can debate endlessly as to which is
more exciting to watch.
The point is that the President
is responsible for the nation's
priorities, and knowing this, you
don't send a boy to do a man's
job.
