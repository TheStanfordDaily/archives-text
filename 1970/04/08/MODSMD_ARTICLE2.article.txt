# Blackball System Dying Out As Frats Face The Future
## 
### WALLY THURSTON 
Brooks? Pass. Melborne? Pass.
Jacobs? Pass. Reaves? Ding.
That's the ding system. At one
time a single objection could bar a
Stanford student from the
fraternity of his dreams. . . and
everlasting glory.
Today the glory is gone. With
dusty rooms and empty beds to
spare, few frats can afford to turn
down an applicant.
As a result, Stanford's
fraternities are slowly liberalizing
their selection procedures. "The
old system," says Theta Delta Chi
president Paul Ormand, "was no
longer practicable; or fair."
Wide Variety
This Spring, rushees will find a
bewildering gamut of selection
procedures, ranging from
spotlessly new to crumbling ritual.

If the aspiring student tries
Theta Xi he will find the ding
system officially in operation.
"However," admits ruch chairman
Mike Bladwin, "in the past few
years it hasn't been practicable.
Now mainly you tell the rushee
what, he wants to hear."
Unlike Theta Xi, Lambda Nu
has many more applicants than
spaces available. In the name of
fairness, a draw system has been
devised where one only need sign
a rush list several times to
participate. According to rush
chairman Tom Buck, this system
allows for a diversity that would
otherwise not be attainable.
Caught in tlie Middle
Most fraternities seem to be in
between the two extremes, where
a certain "natural" or two way
selection is involved.
At Theta Delta Chi a
combination of positive
recommendation along with a
final draw was established
recently. "The purpose of the
draw is only to eliminate the final
selection of those who are already
eligible," explained President Paul
Ormand.
At Delta Upsilon, an 85 percent
affirmative majority is needed to
bid a member into the house. "It
really works out just about the
same as before," says President
George Corbun, "because the
system works both ways. By the
time a guy has been up here a few
times we know he likes us and he

knows whether we like him or
not."
Fraternities that are becoming
independent or coeducational feel
the strongest need for reforming
the selection process.
"Now that we're independent,"
says Phi Gamma Delta President
Jim Giunta, "it's either do or die.
We don't have the economic
support of the national fraternity
and we can't afford to be picky."
The Phi Gamma's selection
problem also came about as a
result of their new coeducational
setting. Part of the agreement
with the university declares that
there will be "no selectivity of
females."
Most rush chairmen agree that
liberalizing the selection
procedure will not alter the house
atmosphere. "There is a tendency
for a certain kind of people to
come here," says Lambda Nu rush
chairman Tom Buck, "but the
draw gives some diversity."
Citing a disadvantage of the
draw, he said that "If it is easy to
get into the house, then you get
people rushing who really aren't
interested in living in the house."
Thus the main concern for
most fraternities seems to be
filling facancies, rather than
pursuing house unity. "Right
now there's no attraction to this
cluster specifically," explains
Giunta, "Rush is still bad and
they're going to have to start
realizing that."
