## Rochell Places Fifth 
### 
Stanford gymnast Steve
Rochell, who had placed third on
the still rings in the Pac-8 meet a
week earlier, won fifth place in
that event last Saturday in NCAA
competition at Temple University
in Philadelphia.
Rochell, a junior, improved on
his 11th place finish in the
national finals a year ago. In the
Pac-8 meet he placed behind Cal's
Eric Courchesne and Washington's
Yoshi Hayasaki.
After Friday's competition he
was one of six finalists on the
rings, and was one of only four
west coast gymnasts to reach the
NCAA finals.
Three Stanford crews rowed to
easy victories over St. Mary's in
their opening races last week on
the home Redwood City course.
John Raines stroked the varsity
boat to a 30 second victory while
the junior varsity boat, stroked by
Larry Gulberg, and the freshman
boat, stroked by George Ganse,
each raced to two and a half
length victories over the 2,000
meter course.
The frosh covered the distance
in 6:06, and the junior varsity
topped that by a second. Saturday
Oregon State, USC and Santa
Clara face the Indians at Redwood
City.
Pac-8 track statistics released
yesterday show that Casey

Carrigan is one of four pole
vaulters in the league to hit 16feet
this year, and triple jumper Alan
Meredith has the second longest
leap in that event, 50-11 1/4.
Greg Brock and Don Kardong,
who both set a Stanford record
with 8:45.2 times in the two mile,
have the second best marks in the
league there, behind Oregon
freshman Steve Prefontaine who
has run 8:40.0. Prefontaine,
incidently, has the fastest times in
the mile, two mile and three mile.
Stanford's Bill Griffith, tied
with four others, has the league's
fourth best score in the 120 high
hurdles at 14.2, and Randy White,
tied with two others, has the
fourth best mark in the 440
intermediate hurdles at 52.6.
There's still time for avid Wrist
Wrestlers to register for
university-wide competition
tomorrow night in Bishop
Auditorium with the prospect of
moving on to bigger things in the
northern California intercollegiate
championships April 17 in San
Francisco.
(If you come a little closer you
might hear Cliff Nancarrow at
372-2920 ext. 122 whisper that
the first team to sign up will
probably be the winner because of
an overwhelmingly phenomenal
lack of response, but we wouldn't
want to start any rumors.)

has run 8:40.0. Prefontaine,
incidently, has the fastest times in
the mile, two mile and three mile.
Stanford's Bill Griffith, tied
with four others, has the league's
fourth best score in the 120 high
hurdles at 14.2, and Randy White,
tied with two others, has the
fourth best mark in the 440
intermediate hurdles at 52.6.
There's still time for avid Wrist
Wrestlers to register for
university-wide competition
tomorrow night in Bishop
Auditorium with the prospect of
moving on to bigger things in the
northern California intercollegiate
championships April 17 in San
Francisco.
(If you come a little closer you
might hear Cliff Nancarrow at
372-2920 ext. 122 whisper that
the first team to sign up will
probably be the winner because of
an overwhelmingly phenomenal
lack of response, but we wouldn't
want to start any rumors.)
Stanford gymnast Steve
Rochell, who had placed third on
the still rings in the Pac-8 meet a
week earlier, won fifth place in
that event last Saturday in NCAA
competition at Temple University
in Philadelphia.
Rochell, a junior, improved on
his 11th place finish in the
national finals a year ago. In the
Pac-8 meet he placed behind Cal's
Eric Courchesne and Washington's
Yoshi Hayasaki.
After Friday's competition he
was one of six finalists on the
rings, and was one of only four
west coast gymnasts to reach the
NCAA finals.
Three Stanford crews rowed to
easy victories over St. Mary's in
their opening races last week on
the home Redwood City course.
John Raines stroked the varsity
boat to a 30 second victory while
the junior varsity boat, stroked by
Larry Gulberg, and the freshman
boat, stroked by George Ganse,
each raced to two and a half
length victories over the 2,000
meter course.
The frosh covered the distance
in 6:06, and the junior varsity
topped that by a second. Saturday
Oregon State, USC and Santa
Clara face the Indians at Redwood
City.
Pac-8 track statistics released
yesterday show that Casey

Carrigan is one of four pole
vaulters in the league to hit 16feet
this year, and triple jumper Alan
Meredith has the second longest
leap in that event, 50-11 1/4.
Greg Brock and Don Kardong,
who both set a Stanford record
with 8:45.2 times in the two mile,
have the second best marks in the
league there, behind Oregon
freshman Steve Prefontaine who
has run 8:40.0. Prefontaine,
incidently, has the fastest times in
the mile, two mile and three mile.
Stanford's Bill Griffith, tied
with four others, has the league's
fourth best score in the 120 high
