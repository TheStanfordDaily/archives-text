# Radicals Go Revolutionary
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
"It's a radical movement becoming a revolutionary movement."
That is how Michael Sweeney describes the recent evolution of the
activist student movement.
The history of radical development during the past year reinforces
Sweeney's analysis. Revolutionary rhetoric has become more frequent
and proto-revolutionary action has largely replaced radical non-violent
tactics.
Some radicals have discovered and internalized an authentic
revolutionary identity. As the internalization Drocess continues

News Analysis

increasing emphasis is placed on ideological and organizational
development, The result of this emphasis has been increasing
tactionalism within the entire movement.
Last year, at Stanford and around the nation, the SDS (Students
for a Democratic Society) was the activist core of the student
movement—but no longer.
The Workers Student Alliance (WSA) group that calls itself the
Stanford SDS is one of the smallest radical organizations on campus.
Most campus revolutionaries are now either unaffiliated or members
of Professor Bruce Franklin's Revolutionary Union group.
Possibly the single major dividing force over the past months has
been the increase in the number of revolutionaries that have adopted a
classical Marxist-Leninist political and organizational perspective.
Ideologically this shift is manifest in a greater emphasis on the
importance of the worker as the agent of revolution.
This ideological emphasis has organizational implications. Since the

workers lie at, the heart of the revolution, radicals must stress their
recruitment.
Debate over the place of Marxism-Leninism and worker
recruitment in American revolutionary theory was a key factor in the
national and local-SDS splits.
In fact, at Stanford the only two closely knit radical organizations,
the WSA and the Revolutionary Union, are firm adherents to the
more traditional Socialist notions or worker exploitation. (These two
groups strongly differ on other issues, however.)
This is not meant to say that the other, unaffiliated groups of
Stanford revolutionaries do not also see importance in Socialist
ideology and worker organization.
Despite all the movement toward a harder radical ideology, the
majority of Stanford revolutionaries remain skeptical of the American
worker as a revolutionary agent.
Because of this, these radicals direct most of their activism toward
Grass Roots and anti-war causes, while the harder liners are more
active in labor organization.
The radical movement is not a monolithic force. As one anti-ROTC
protest leader told me the other day, "if you think we know what is
going to happen at these meetings you have to be kidding."
The different radical political perspectives are reflected in different
attitudes toward the present ROTC protests. While most are generally
pleased with actions that have been taken, leaders like Paul Rupert
and Lenny Siegel question the effectiveness of the window-breaking in
building a mass movement.
Despite the factions, however, revolutionaries have been able to
unite effectively around an arousing issue. During the present ROTC
demonstrations the splits have hardly been visible.

The Workers Student Alliance (WSA) group that calls itself the
Stanford SDS is one of the smallest radical organizations on campus.
Most campus revolutionaries are now either unaffiliated or members
of Professor Bruce Franklin's Revolutionary Union group.
Possibly the single major dividing force over the past months has
been the increase in the number of revolutionaries that have adopted a
classical Marxist-Leninist political and organizational perspective.
Ideologically this shift is manifest in a greater emphasis on the
importance of the worker as the agent of revolution.
This ideological emphasis has organizational implications. Since the

workers lie at, the heart of the revolution, radicals must stress their
recruitment.
Debate over the place of Marxism-Leninism and worker
recruitment in American revolutionary theory was a key factor in the
national and local-SDS splits.
In fact, at Stanford the only two closely knit radical organizations,
the WSA and the Revolutionary Union, are firm adherents to the
more traditional Socialist notions or worker exploitation. (These two
groups strongly differ on other issues, however.)
This is not meant to say that the other, unaffiliated groups of
Stanford revolutionaries do not also see importance in Socialist
ideology and worker organization.
Despite all the movement toward a harder radical ideology, the
majority of Stanford revolutionaries remain skeptical of the American
worker as a revolutionary agent.
Because of this, these radicals direct most of their activism toward
Grass Roots and anti-war causes, while the harder liners are more
active in labor organization.
The radical movement is not a monolithic force. As one anti-ROTC
protest leader told me the other day, "if you think we know what is
going to happen at these meetings you have to be kidding."
The different radical political perspectives are reflected in different
attitudes toward the present ROTC protests. While most are generally
pleased with actions that have been taken, leaders like Paul Rupert
and Lenny Siegel question the effectiveness of the window-breaking in
building a mass movement.
Despite the factions, however, revolutionaries have been able to
unite effectively around an arousing issue. During the present ROTC
demonstrations the splits have hardly been visible.
"It's a radical movement becoming a revolutionary movement."
That is how Michael Sweeney describes the recent evolution of the
activist student movement.
The history of radical development during the past year reinforces
Sweeney's analysis. Revolutionary rhetoric has become more frequent
and proto-revolutionary action has largely replaced radical non-violent
tactics.
Some radicals have discovered and internalized an authentic
revolutionary identity. As the internalization Drocess continues
