# Pitzer Closes Building After Mill-In At ROTC
## 
### 
Responding quickly to a noon
mill-in at the ROTC Department,
President Kenneth Pitzer last
night issued an emergency
regulation closing the Athletic
Building and the ROTC
Departments to all but employees
or students having classes there.
Almost 100 anti-ROTC
demonstrators held an hour-long
mill-in at ROTC headquarters in
the Athletic Dept. yesterday
afternoon as protests against
on-campus officer training entered
their second week.
The* demonstrators yesterday
also disrupted an evening lecture
session of an Army ROTC class
being held in room 87 of the
Graduate School of Business.
The emergency regulation was
promulgated under section D.2.b
of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter, which permits the
President to enact emergency
regulation when the Student
Conduct Legislative Council lacks
the necessary time.
According to the Charter the
President may enact the
legislation "provided (he) shall
first consult with as many
members of the SCLC as
practicable."
Of the five members of the 11
man SCLC contacted by the Daily
last night none had been
consulted by President Pitzer.
Chairman Hubert Marshall stated
that he was home all evening.
Defiant Member
Member Yale Braunstein said,
"I plan to spend as much of my
time in the ROTC building to
show my defiance and contempt
for this illegal regulation."
The SCLC meet yesterday
afternoon for two hours. No
mention of the regulation was
made by anyone present.

After leaving the building, the
demonstrators held a lengthy
meeting on the Athletic Dept.
lawn, directly below the ROTC
office's windows, to decide on
future plans for the movement.
After discussing several proposals
the group decided to hold another
noontime White Plaza rally today,
march to the ROTC building, and
hold another mill-in there. They
also planned to continue affinity
group meeting in the dormitories.
In a surprise move last night,
about 4 5 demonstrators
"audited" an Army ROTC class
being conducted in the Graduate
School of Business. At least two
affinity groups were represented
during last night's protest.
After listening to two military
speakers for a total of 25 minutes,
the group became disruptive, and
after hearing the campus policy
on disruptions, Bruce Wiggins, a
member of the University's
security department, read the
demonstrators the same
injunction that they had heard
earlier in the day.
Started At Rally
Yesterday's activities began
with a noon rally on White Plaza
attended by slightly more than
200 people. After the group heard
from three speakers, Mike
Sweeney, one of the anti-ROTC
leaders, said, "We are going to sit
in the hallways, the offices and
the classrooms and we are going
to assert our presence.
"This afternoon," he
continued, "The ROTC building
will become a center for
discussion and debate over how to
end its (ROTC's) presence on
campus.
"It will become a center for
liberation studies. We plan to hold
an all-afternoon mill-in.
"No one will damage any
property, and no one will do
anything that is not a right of any
person to do on an open campus,"
he said.
As the demonstrators arrived,
the Athletic Dept. doors were
wide open, and the 100 protestors
poured in through the front door
and up the steps to the ROTC
offices on the second floor.
Demonstrators questioned desk
personnel at all three military
offices and then reconvened to
hold a meeting at the top of the
steps. A decision was reached to
continue the mill-in and attend a
3:15 class slated for the building.
Denied Entrance
Demonstrators tried to gain
admittance to a 1:15 class in
"Foundations of National
Power," taught by Lt. Edward
Eckert, but Eckert blocked the
door and refused to allow the
protestors to enter the classroom.
At the same time, another
group of demonstrators tried to
enter another class, "World
Military History," taught by Capt.
Clinton Anderson. Anderson and
some of the cadets in his class
attempted to shut the door, thus
barring the demonstrators, but a
large group of demonstrators
grabbed hold of the door ami held
on during a 15-minute tug-of-war.
Eventually, the cadets managed to
shut the door, but the class lasted
only about five minutes as
DeYoung arrived bearing the
injunction.
Two students apparently were
injured in the clash. One cadet
suffered a facial cut, while one
demonstrator left the building

grasping his mouth. The
seriousness of their injuries could
not be immediately determined.
No arrests were reported
during the incident.
Discussions
At least ten cadets stopped to
talk with the demonstrators
before leaving the area. Both
demonstrators and cadets
remained calm during the half
hour that the discussions lasted.
The campus was quiet until
7:55 p.m. when a band of about
40 demonstrators from two
affinity groups entered an
orientation class of "Branches of
Service" taught by Col. Casey.
Two guest speakers, apparently
attached to the Presidio,
continued to speak after Casey
re eatedly asked the
demonstrators to be quiet and to
stop throwing paper airplanes.
When pressed repeatedly by
the demonstrators, Casey said that
the speakers might be available to
answer questions after the class
was dismissed at 9 p.m.
The 45 demonstrators then
present didn't wait until 9. Chair
squeaking, talking and airplane
flying grew more intense, and
Casey again stopped the speaker,
who was discussing the duties of a
tank commander. Casey read the
campus disruption statement, and
Bruce Wiggins, a University safety
official, read the count injunction.
Col. Stanley Ramey, in the back
of the room, turned the lights on
and off. The demonstrators
listened to part of the injunction
and filed out of the room.
After leaving the Business
School, the group split into two
affinity groups and headed to
Donner for additional meetings.

The lull text of President
Pitzer's statement reads as
follows: NOTICE TO THE
