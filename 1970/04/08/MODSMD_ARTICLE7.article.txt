A Faculty Moral
Editor, The Daily:
Are the Stanford faculty to
blame for the windows broken
during the evening of the
transition from March to April,
1970? You see, 51% of the
faculty voting in the recent ROTC
/mail ballot did not vote the way
3% of the students wanted them
to. Consequently the 3% felt
justified in marching around
breaking windows, presumably in
order to change the outcome of
the vote. Moral: a majority should
never vote approval of a matter
which is disapproved by a small
minority.

Observations
Editor, THE DAILY:
Having been present at the
demonstrations the last two nights
(despite non-student Jim Shoch's
threats to "kill guys like you
someday") I have several
observations to make.
First, allegations that members
of the FCM have attacked any
demonstrators are wholly
fictitious. I have been with that
group for the past two evenings
and observed no tripping,
clubbing or other anti-social
behavior. Threats against our
persons were made on several
occasions, but we did not respond
even to these with force.
Second, the demonstrators are
incredibly self-righteous. They
plan an attack on a building quite
openly, discussing in some detail
how to provoke police reaction

and how to get other students to
react to police presence, and then
act outraged when some of their
number get arrested. And that
after they have stoned windows in
buildings and in policje vehicles,
and the police themselves!
Third, the situation would be
pretty much under control if
enough people turned out to
identify or restrain rock throwers
like D. McGuire. If your friends
won't listen to you, and persist in
destruction, turn them in to
the police. The university has
promised to prosecute
lawbreakers in this demonstration.
Now it is up to us to identify
them. It sure would be nice if
some of the moderates would join
us right-wingers in the battle to
preserve the university and the
civil rights of all of us.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The University's personnel
department has asked all
administrative units to provide the
names of all employees in certain

ethnic or psuedo-ethnic groups.
The stated purpose is to facilitate
the development of statistics on
employment of people from these
groups to comply with federal
requirements.
The provision of statistics on
minority employment may be
helpful in evaluating a large
employer's efforts to provide real
opportunities for traditionally
excluded segments of the
population and to this end I
support the University's desire to
comply with the Federal
Government's requirements. But,
there is no requirement for a
registry and most particularly a
central registry of the names of
Blacks, Chicanos, Orientals and
etc. Many possibilities for abuse
of such a registry are obvious.
I urge you to have us return to
the previous method of compiling
overall statistics from department
statistics and require that no race
or ethnic information be a part of
the record of any Stanford
people.

Are the Stanford faculty to
blame for the windows broken
during the evening of the
transition from March to April,
1970? You see, 51% of the
faculty voting in the recent ROTC
/mail ballot did not vote the way
3% of the students wanted them
to. Consequently the 3% felt
justified in marching around
breaking windows, presumably in
order to change the outcome of
the vote. Moral: a majority should
never vote approval of a matter
which is disapproved by a small
minority.

Observations
Editor, THE DAILY:
Having been present at the
demonstrations the last two nights
(despite non-student Jim Shoch's
threats to "kill guys like you
someday") I have several
observations to make.
First, allegations that members
of the FCM have attacked any
demonstrators are wholly
fictitious. I have been with that
group for the past two evenings
and observed no tripping,
clubbing or other anti-social
behavior. Threats against our
persons were made on several
occasions, but we did not respond
even to these with force.
Second, the demonstrators are
incredibly self-righteous. They
plan an attack on a building quite
openly, discussing in some detail
how to provoke police reaction

and how to get other students to
react to police presence, and then
act outraged when some of their
number get arrested. And that
after they have stoned windows in
buildings and in policje vehicles,
and the police themselves!
Third, the situation would be
pretty much under control if
enough people turned out to
identify or restrain rock throwers
like D. McGuire. If your friends
won't listen to you, and persist in
destruction, turn them in to
the police. The university has
promised to prosecute
lawbreakers in this demonstration.
Now it is up to us to identify
them. It sure would be nice if
some of the moderates would join
us right-wingers in the battle to
preserve the university and the
civil rights of all of us.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The University's personnel
department has asked all
administrative units to provide the
names of all employees in certain

ethnic or psuedo-ethnic groups.
The stated purpose is to facilitate
the development of statistics on
employment of people from these
groups to comply with federal
requirements.
The provision of statistics on
minority employment may be
helpful in evaluating a large
employer's efforts to provide real
opportunities for traditionally
excluded segments of the
population and to this end I
support the University's desire to
comply with the Federal
Government's requirements. But,
there is no requirement for a
registry and most particularly a
central registry of the names of
Blacks, Chicanos, Orientals and
etc. Many possibilities for abuse
of such a registry are obvious.
I urge you to have us return to
the previous method of compiling
overall statistics from department
statistics and require that no race
or ethnic information be a part of
the record of any Stanford
people.
