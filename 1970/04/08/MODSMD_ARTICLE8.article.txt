# Silent Spring

### 
It is Silent Spring again at Stanford; the only relief in sight seems
to be the chants of radial mohs and an occasional breaking window.
And around the Quad and T.agunita are to be heard the inaudible
articulations of the Great Silent.
It is not that this spring is different from the previous. We
remember .he tumult of silence and apathy unleashed last spring when
the very unquiet A3M invaded AEL. And The People did not speak,
did not condemn, did not approve the action taken then, as now, in
the name of The People; and this left the radicals no alternative but to
accept the implicit support thus offered them. So We The People
became the A3M, and for the same reason We The People are
becoming the Midnight Heroes of the Windowpane.
