# From The Inside
## One Cadet's Criticisms 
### 
Several years ago as a
freshman, when I considered the
regimented dehumanizing process
all enlisted inductees undergo
during and after basic training,
Army ROTC with its two year
active duty obligation, seemed to
be a fairly good deal.

Besides, I knew that second
lieutenants had more privileges,
better living conditions, better
pay, less harassment from
"superior" officers, and more
leeway as far as retaining ones
own individuality, than do
enlisted recruits or draftees.
Graduation and comissioning
as a second lieutenant seemed so
far away, and the imperialistic war
of oppression and aid to the
South Vietnamese military
dictatorship would probably end
in those years between the time I
joined ROTC and the time I went
on active duty. By then, I
thought, the American military
would begin to see the futility in
trying to brutally repress peoples'
rebellions against oppressive
military dictatorships like the
Thieu-Ky regime.
What a fairy tale that has
turned out to be. It soon became
quite clear to me that the U.S.
Army does not want its 20,000
annual ROTC graduates "To
protect and uphold the American
Constitution" and all the rest of
that bullshit rhetoric the ROTC
enlistment oath states. It wants
them simply for the purpose of
preserving the oppressive
fascist-ruled states like South
Vietnam, Thailand, and now
Cambodia and Laos.
Filthy Job
I told myself I would no longer
allow myself to be trained to do
the Army's filthy job for them. So
I just recently began looking for a
way out.
This wouldn't be easy, since I
had already signed that infamous
contract containing the "punitive
clause," which put me under
obligation to immediately serve
two years active duty in the Army
as a private (which was what I had

wanted to avoid doing all along)
were I to quit ROTC, leave
school, get poor ROTC grades, or
do anything else the Army might
consider to be a "breach of
contract."
Both President Pitzer and Vice
Provost Brookes have at one time
or another verbally lashed out
against the punitive clause in the
ROTC student contracts and
urged that they be abolished. The
senior ROTC officers merely reply
that only an act of Congress can
delete the punitive clause from
individual ROTC contracts. This is
a half-truth at best, for the senior
officers of the ROTC units are
granted almost .unlimited
flexibility in freeing ROTC
students from the contracts'
provisions.
ROTC Ultimatum
If President Pitzer and Dr.
Brooks were really sincere about
having the punitive clause
removed, they would only have to
deliver an ultimatum to the ROTC
departments ordering them to
revise the student contracts now
or get out of Stanford.
In addition to blackmailing
individual cadets into conformity
with the punitive clause, the
Army ROTC has a much more
highly refined method of
whipping us cadets into line. In
the Army there are "branches"
which can be divided into two
categoriesâ€”the "safe" noncombat
branches (Signal, Engineer,
Supply, Military Police, Finance,
and Military Justice), and the
"unsafe" combat branches
(Infantry, Artillary, and Armor).
For the "top" 10 percent of
each fourth year graduating
ROTC cadet class, the special
award and designation of
"Distinguished Military Student"
is presented. Known as the DMS
award, it is supposedly earned by
excellence in leadership ability,
scholarship, enthusiasm, and other
meaningless boot-licking criteria.
All third year cadets make first,
second, and third branch choices,
and one of those choices must be
a combat branch. Usually the
combat branch is everyone's third
choice, for all cadets want to stay
alive.
DMS First Choice
By an amazing coincidence, all
DMS designees get their first
choice (noncombat) branches, and
most others get their third choice
(combat) branches. This may not
seem so evil in itself, but the
entire DMS program is designed so
that every cadet who wants his
first branch choice must adopt the
"correct" political viewpoints
(and express them in class). He
must not be found to be
associated with any of the
"incorrect" political organizations
like the SDS, the Moratorium, the
Free University, or anything to
the left of Hubert Humphrey.
With this coercive force
omnipresent in the campus lives
of each Army ROTC cadet, it can
hardly be said that the liberally
educated Stanford cadets are a
humanizing influence on the
military, for the Army is already
exerting its influence on each
cadet. As far as the "humanizing"
influence of ROTC on the
military, I would like to call
attention to one of the Army's
"jody calls."
A "jody call" is simply a short
marching song used for keeping a
drilling unit in step to its beat.
One well know jody call:
I wanna be an airborn ranger,
I wanna live a life of danger,
I wanna go to Vietnam,
'Cause I wanna kill a Charlie
Cong.
If getting rid of the punitive
clause and the unfair branch
assignment system means
completely getting rid of ROTC,
then I am for its removal from
Stanford.
