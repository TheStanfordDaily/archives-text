# Police Suummoned To Unlock ROTC
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
Between 150 and 200
anti-ROTC demonstrators papered
and padlocked the entrance to the
ROTC-Athletic building yesterday
afternoon before police undid
their handiwork and ordered them
to disperse.
Seven Santa Clara County
sheriff's deputies and three
plainclothes police cleared the
entrances to the building an hour
after protesters effectively closed
it with cartoons of University
President Kenneth Pitzer pasted
across the door and a small
bicycle lock joining its handles.
Despite a few scuffles no
damage or arrests resulted from
the two-hour building
mill-around, the seventh
anti-ROTC protest in the last two
weeks. Demonstrators have
announced that they will meet
tonight at 7:30 a.m. in Tresidder
large lounge to discuss further
action.
Another meeting has been set
for TMU 270-1 at 7:00 p.m. this
evening by Council of Presidents
members Pat Shea and John
Grube and former Moratorium
Committee Chairman John
Kramer. They hope to organize an
"anti-ROTC, anti-violence" group.
Yesterday's protest action
followed a noon rally in White
Plaza at which radicals criticized
Pitzer's Tuesday night
proclamation temporarily closing
the Athletic building to
unauthorized persons and his
Wednesday decision to close
enrollment to ROTC classes. (See
related story below.)
Plot to Squash Dissent
Speakers at the rally described
the attempt of about a dozen
students yesterday morning to
enter the Athletic building in
order to audit a military training
course. They were turned back by
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
Former student Bruce Pollock
said that Taylor and University
Security Manager Bruce Wiggins
had assaulted several of the
students. "Some people have been
talking about fascism . . ." Pollock
added, referring to the assault.
"We're up against a plot to keep
ROTC on campus and to squash
dissent," he continued.
Bill Keely, one of those
allegedly attacked, described
being "chopped on the hand" by
Taylor, but conceded "it wasn't
much of an attack."
Other speakers challenged the
legitimacy of Pitzer's decision to
close the Athletic building to
unauthorized persons.
Rick Atkins, chairman of the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC), branded the
action a return to "one-man rule
on campus." SCLC member Yale
Braunstein claimed Pitzer's action
had ignored provisions of the
Judicial charter that required him
to consult with as many SCLC
members as practicable before
making such declarations.
John Shoch, speaker of the
Student Senate then suggested
that the protesters stage a
"stuff-in" in the entry to the
Athletic building. "I really think
we need a contest like those old
phone booth stuffing contests
they used to have," he said.
After marching to the building
at about 1:30 p.m., the protesters
encouraged 53 of their group to
cram into the seven by 12 foot
doorway. A dog joined them. A
few more of the crowd then
moved around to block the back
entrance of the building.
A number of athletes and
cadets were able to enter the
building before 2 p.m. but soon
thereafter protesters began using
condensed milk to plaster over the
front and back entrances.
They covered the doors to the
building with copies of a cartoon
showing a caricature of the
Department of Defense leading

"Kennethaurus Fitz." A while
later someone put a small bicycle
lock on the front door handles.
Shortly after 3:15 p.m. the
small detachment of police
arrived, clipped the lock in half,
and allowed authorized persons
into the building again. Protesters
jammed into the doorway again to
question and taunt the officers,
but the deputies remained
expressionless.
The police had been called by
Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig who explained: "We
had a report that turned out to be
true that the front door was
chained and padlocked. We felt it
was a substantial danger to the
people in the building."
About 4:00 p.m. the 40
remaining demonstrators who had
begun to disperse, were warned
they were conducting an unlawful
assembly by C.D. Marron of the
Sheriff's Department. They left.
The Daily also learned
yesterday a window had been
broken in radical Professor Bruce
Franklin's Inner Quad office, and
that three were shattered in
Professor Halstead Holman's
home. Holman's son Michael has
participated in some of the
protests.
