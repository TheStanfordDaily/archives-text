# Ecology And Survival
## Desert America Soon? 
### Barry Wood 
One of the indices of American
affluence is the availability of
fresh water in unlimited
quantities, for any purpose, at any
hour of the day. We find the idea
of a whole family washing in one
tub of water for three days
unthinkable, yet this is normal for
India. It seems completely
primitive that Hong Kong spigots
flow with water for a short period
only once in four days.
In the face of such riches
Americans are profligate wasters.
We consume 145 gallons daily for
domestic use, 2000 gallons for all
purposes, for a daily total of 360
billion gallons. By 1980 this figure
is expected to rise to an incredible
600 billion gallons daily.
Water is the trickiest resource
to manage. In 1980 we will be
drawing off just about one half of
the flow of our rivers for water
systems, but will be under a daily
shortage of some 100 billion
gallons. Yet this does not mean
that river dwellers will be well off,
for the draught will strike our
most vulnerable nerve-agriculture.
There is no need to project
disaster into the future. Right
now we are pumping the country
dry. Agricultural needs in the San
Joaquin back in the 1940's and
50's required artesan wells
hundreds of feet deep. Valley
farmers were actually mining
fossil water dating to the last ice
age.
Deeper & Deeper
All over the country the wells
are being dug deeper and deeper
in a frantic search for water.
Nebraska has dug 1 00 wells a year
since World War 11, resulting in a
drop in the water table of more
than 15 feet. Mississippi basin
wells are 100 feet deeper on the
average than 12 years ago. In the

high plains of Texas, water
replenishing the water table at
50,000 acre feet annually is being
drawn off 1-10 times as fast.
The extent of ecological
problems connected with water
alone is vast. A water table is
replenished by water held in soil
humus, which can retain as much
as 200,000 poinds of water per
acre. It is also aided by forest
cover which absorbs ground water
and actually increases rainfall
because of the stabilized
temperature at the ground level.
Denuded of millions of acres of
forest and ground cover,
California has experienced a drop
in annual rainfall from 33 to 22
inches during the past century. It
boils down to the fact that a
watershed subjected to paving,
draining, and urban sprawl results
in terrestrial heat, drier air,
diminished rainfall and less
retention of ground water, which
runs off the land instead of
sinking in.
Desalinizing The War
Recently great hope has been
held out through the technique of
desalinizing ocean water. Yet even
the estimated world output of
desalinized water by 1980 is only
one third of the present
requirements of the U.S. Add to
this mountains of unwanted salt
and pumping costs and problems
seem formidable.
Traditionally our water has
come from great heights in the
mountains, thereby providing
convenient hydro-electric power
as a bonus. But what happens
when you have millions of gallons
of desalinized water at sea level,
and no power to pump it up over
the mountains? Presumably you
burn fossil fuel to provide power,
thus polluting the air, or atomic
energy plants are built which
dump millions of gallons of
boiling brine back into the ocean,
disturbing the whole ecology of
the continental shelf.
II seems bitterly ironic that the
richest nation in the world will
falter on a shortage of the most

abundant resource. That irony is
symbolic of the fact that all our
so-called "riches" are abstractions
like "buying power" or the Gross
National Product. Our real wealth
is our soil, forest, lakes and rivers.
Paradoxically, at the point when
our GNP reaches its highest point
our real wealth will stand at
nothing.
Now here To Go?
It is now apparent that as this
nation streaks ahead at breakneck
speed the pioneering ravages of
nature will have to be halted. The
philosophy of "foul the nest,
move west" has left us nowhere to
go but into an increasingly
polluted Pacific. The armies of
offspring we are producing cannot
be continually packed into Los
Angeles.
J.B. Priestly recently said: "I
have been feeling genuinely and
deeply sorry for the American
people. 1 am sorry for them
because, bewildered, saddened
and maddened, they are trying to
grope their way out of a long and
dangerous dream." To put off the
moment of realization by dreams
of building a bigger technology to
solve our problems, or notions of
colonizing space, or the sea
bottoms, is only to prolong our
dangerous dream.
Sooner or later we must assess
the resources of this country and
this planet, and then decWe how
many people can "live off the
land" without destroying it. The
alternative to this are three - a vast
American desert, a completely
Los Angelesized country, or a
completely septic environment.

boils down to the fact that a
watershed subjected to paving,
draining, and urban sprawl results
in terrestrial heat, drier air,
diminished rainfall and less
retention of ground water, which
runs off the land instead of
sinking in.
Desalinizing The War
Recently great hope has been
held out through the technique of
desalinizing ocean water. Yet even
the estimated world output of
desalinized water by 1980 is only
one third of the present
requirements of the U.S. Add to
this mountains of unwanted salt
and pumping costs and problems
seem formidable.
Traditionally our water has
come from great heights in the
mountains, thereby providing
convenient hydro-electric power
as a bonus. But what happens
when you have millions of gallons
of desalinized water at sea level,
and no power to pump it up over
the mountains? Presumably you
burn fossil fuel to provide power,
thus polluting the air, or atomic
energy plants are built which
dump millions of gallons of
boiling brine back into the ocean,
disturbing the whole ecology of
the continental shelf.
II seems bitterly ironic that the
richest nation in the world will
falter on a shortage of the most

abundant resource. That irony is
symbolic of the fact that all our
so-called "riches" are abstractions
like "buying power" or the Gross
National Product. Our real wealth
is our soil, forest, lakes and rivers.
Paradoxically, at the point when
our GNP reaches its highest point
our real wealth will stand at
nothing.
Now here To Go?
It is now apparent that as this
nation streaks ahead at breakneck
speed the pioneering ravages of
nature will have to be halted. The
philosophy of "foul the nest,
move west" has left us nowhere to
go but into an increasingly
polluted Pacific. The armies of
offspring we are producing cannot
be continually packed into Los
Angeles.
J.B. Priestly recently said: "I
have been feeling genuinely and
deeply sorry for the American
people. 1 am sorry for them
because, bewildered, saddened
and maddened, they are trying to

dangerous dream." To put off the
moment of realization by dreams
of building a bigger technology to
solve our problems, or notions of
colonizing space, or the sea
bottoms, is only to prolong our
dangerous dream.
Sooner or later we must assess
the resources of this country and

One of the indices of American
affluence is the availability of
fresh water in unlimited
quantities, for any purpose, at any
hour of the day. We find the idea
of a whole family washing in one
tub of water for three days
unthinkable, yet this is normal for
India. It seems completely
primitive that Hong Kong spigots
flow with water for a short period
only once in four days.
In the face of such riches
Americans are profligate wasters.
We consume 145 gallons daily for
domestic use, 2000 gallons for all
purposes, for a daily total of 360
billion gallons. By 1980 this figure
is expected to rise to an incredible
600 billion gallons daily.
Water is the trickiest resource
to manage. In 1980 we will be
drawing off just about one half of
the flow of our rivers for water
systems, but will be under a daily
shortage of some 100 billion
gallons. Yet this does not mean
that river dwellers will be well off,
for the draught will strike our
most vulnerable nerve-agriculture.
There is no need to project
disaster into the future. Right
now we are pumping the country
dry. Agricultural needs in the San
Joaquin back in the 1940's and
50's required artesan wells
hundreds of feet deep. Valley
farmers were actually mining
fossil water dating to the last ice
age.
Deeper & Deeper
All over the country the wells
are being dug deeper and deeper
in a frantic search for water.
Nebraska has dug 1 00 wells a year
since World War 11, resulting in a
drop in the water table of more
than 15 feet. Mississippi basin
wells are 100 feet deeper on the
average than 12 years ago. In the

high plains of Texas, water
replenishing the water table at
50,000 acre feet annually is being
drawn off 1-10 times as fast.
The extent of ecological
problems connected with water
alone is vast. A water table is
replenished by water held in soil
humus, which can retain as much
as 200,000 poinds of water per
acre. It is also aided by forest
cover which absorbs ground water
and actually increases rainfall
because of the stabilized
temperature at the ground level.
Denuded of millions of acres of
forest and ground cover,
California has experienced a drop
in annual rainfall from 33 to 22
inches during the past century. It

opulence is beginning to look like
thirst and sickness in a completely
Chinafied world.
(liarry Wood is a graduate
student in English.)
One of the indices of American
affluence is the availability of
fresh water in unlimited
quantities, for any purpose, at any
hour of the day. We find the idea
of a whole family washing in one
tub of water for three days
unthinkable, yet this is normal for
India. It seems completely
primitive that Hong Kong spigots
flow with water for a short period
only once in four days.
In the face of such riches
Americans are profligate wasters.
We consume 145 gallons daily for
domestic use, 2000 gallons for all
purposes, for a daily total of 360
billion gallons. By 1980 this figure
is expected to rise to an incredible
600 billion gallons daily.
Water is the trickiest resource
to manage. In 1980 we will be
drawing off just about one half of
the flow of our rivers for water
systems, but will be under a daily
shortage of some 100 billion
gallons. Yet this does not mean
that river dwellers will be well off,
for the draught will strike our
most vulnerable nerve-agriculture.
There is no need to project
disaster into the future. Right
now we are pumping the country
dry. Agricultural needs in the San
Joaquin back in the 1940's and
50's required artesan wells
hundreds of feet deep. Valley
farmers were actually mining
fossil water dating to the last ice
age.
Deeper & Deeper
All over the country the wells
are being dug deeper and deeper
in a frantic search for water.
Nebraska has dug 1 00 wells a year
since World War 11, resulting in a
drop in the water table of more
than 15 feet. Mississippi basin
wells are 100 feet deeper on the
average than 12 years ago. In the

high plains of Texas, water
replenishing the water table at
50,000 acre feet annually is being
drawn off 1-10 times as fast.
The extent of ecological
problems connected with water
alone is vast. A water table is
replenished by water held in soil
humus, which can retain as much
as 200,000 poinds of water per
acre. It is also aided by forest
cover which absorbs ground water
and actually increases rainfall
because of the stabilized
temperature at the ground level.
Denuded of millions of acres of
forest and ground cover,
California has experienced a drop
in annual rainfall from 33 to 22
inches during the past century. It
boils down to the fact that a
watershed subjected to paving,
draining, and urban sprawl results
in terrestrial heat, drier air,
diminished rainfall and less
retention of ground water, which
runs off the land instead of
sinking in.
Desalinizing The War
Recently great hope has been
held out through the technique of
desalinizing ocean water. Yet even
the estimated world output of
desalinized water by 1980 is only
one third of the present
requirements of the U.S. Add to
this mountains of unwanted salt
and pumping costs and problems
seem formidable.
Traditionally our water has
come from great heights in the
mountains, thereby providing
convenient hydro-electric power
as a bonus. But what happens
when you have millions of gallons
of desalinized water at sea level,
and no power to pump it up over
the mountains? Presumably you
burn fossil fuel to provide power,
thus polluting the air, or atomic
energy plants are built which
dump millions of gallons of
boiling brine back into the ocean,
disturbing the whole ecology of
the continental shelf.
II seems bitterly ironic that the
richest nation in the world will
falter on a shortage of the most

abundant resource. That irony is
symbolic of the fact that all our
so-called "riches" are abstractions
like "buying power" or the Gross
National Product. Our real wealth
is our soil, forest, lakes and rivers.
Paradoxically, at the point when
our GNP reaches its highest point
our real wealth will stand at
nothing.
Now here To Go?
It is now apparent that as this
nation streaks ahead at breakneck
speed the pioneering ravages of
nature will have to be halted. The
philosophy of "foul the nest,
move west" has left us nowhere to
go but into an increasingly
polluted Pacific. The armies of
offspring we are producing cannot
be continually packed into Los
Angeles.
J.B. Priestly recently said: "I
have been feeling genuinely and
deeply sorry for the American
people. 1 am sorry for them
because, bewildered, saddened
and maddened, they are trying to
grope their way out of a long and
dangerous dream." To put off the
moment of realization by dreams
of building a bigger technology to
solve our problems, or notions of
colonizing space, or the sea
bottoms, is only to prolong our
dangerous dream.
Sooner or later we must assess
the resources of this country and
this planet, and then decWe how
many people can "live off the
land" without destroying it. The
alternative to this are three - a vast
American desert, a completely
Los Angelesized country, or a
