## Simplistic Views 
### Tom Dawson 
Stanford's current crop of moral crusadcrs, the allegedly anti-ROTC
movement, are fond of quoting with a-pproval various latter-day
revolutionary slogans such as "If you aren't part of the solution,
you're part of the problem" and "You're either with us or against us."
Such a simplistic view of the world enjoys particular vogue on
college campuses today. The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department
is seen as working hand in hand with Chiang Kai-Shek to oppress the
working peoples of the world. By this analysis, further, Mayor
Lindsay and Strom Thurmond are "part of the problem." In more
advanced intellectual circles on this campus, the Russians join the
American government as part of the problem.
While simplistic world views are not a new phenomenon, many
think they are new to America. A quick review of American history
uncovers some rather strange bedfellows for today's radical
movement.
Back in the mid 1950'5, a prominent statesman went on record as
condemning neutralism in the communist-capitalist struggle as
"immoral". Stanford's own Michael Sweeney and Bruce Franklin
assuredly would agree that neutrality in the present world situation is
"immoral."

The only hitch is that the "prominent statesman referred to above
is none other than the architect of Cold War diplomacy, John Foster
Dulles.
In his book 1000 l);i\s Arthur M. Schlesinger argues that Marxists
have "inverted the Dulles doctrine" and "adopted it" for themselves.
Schlesinger goes on to quote with approval a speech by President
Kennedy at Berkeley: "No one can doubt that the wave of the future
is not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the
liberation of the diverse energies of free nations and free men."
This pluralistic view of the world is in stark contrast with both the
worlcjs of -John Foster Dulles and Stanford radicals. But. what is even
more interesting is the marked similarity between the views of Cold
Warrior Dulles and the New Leftists of today.
The views of both express a moral certainty of tin 1 superiority of
their world view. Neither sees any room for diversity among people.
The "international Communist conspiracy" can be interchanged with
"American imperialism" of "Soviet revisionism" of the "international
Zionist conspiracy" quite comfortably. Unfortunately all these
phrases occupy an important part of today's rhetoric.
Those in this country who attack the New Left as being
un-American are, in an empirical sense, quite wrong. Their intolerance
has its roots in the Cold War rhetoric of Dulles If Duljjes was wrong,
and I think he was, then I think the radicals of today, the Didleses of
today, are equally wrong.

phrases occupy an important part of today's rhetoric.
Those in this country who attack the New Left as being
un-American are, in an empirical sense, quite wrong. Their intolerance
has its roots in the Cold War rhetoric of Dulles If Duljjes was wrong,
and I think he was, then I think the radicals of today, the Didleses of
today, are equally wrong.
Worldviews make strange bedfellows

Stanford's current crop of moral crusadcrs, the allegedly anti-ROTC
movement, are fond of quoting with a-pproval various latter-day
revolutionary slogans such as "If you aren't part of the solution,
you're part of the problem" and "You're either with us or against us."
Such a simplistic view of the world enjoys particular vogue on
college campuses today. The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department
is seen as working hand in hand with Chiang Kai-Shek to oppress the
working peoples of the world. By this analysis, further, Mayor
Lindsay and Strom Thurmond are "part of the problem." In more
advanced intellectual circles on this campus, the Russians join the
American government as part of the problem.
While simplistic world views are not a new phenomenon, many
think they are new to America. A quick review of American history
uncovers some rather strange bedfellows for today's radical
movement.
Back in the mid 1950'5, a prominent statesman went on record as
condemning neutralism in the communist-capitalist struggle as
"immoral". Stanford's own Michael Sweeney and Bruce Franklin
assuredly would agree that neutrality in the present world situation is
"immoral."

The only hitch is that the "prominent statesman referred to above
is none other than the architect of Cold War diplomacy, John Foster
Dulles.
In his book 1000 l);i\s Arthur M. Schlesinger argues that Marxists
have "inverted the Dulles doctrine" and "adopted it" for themselves.
Schlesinger goes on to quote with approval a speech by President
Kennedy at Berkeley: "No one can doubt that the wave of the future
is not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the
liberation of the diverse energies of free nations and free men."
This pluralistic view of the world is in stark contrast with both the
worlcjs of -John Foster Dulles and Stanford radicals. But. what is even
more interesting is the marked similarity between the views of Cold
Warrior Dulles and the New Leftists of today.
The views of both express a moral certainty of tin 1 superiority of
their world view. Neither sees any room for diversity among people.
The "international Communist conspiracy" can be interchanged with
"American imperialism" of "Soviet revisionism" of the "international
Zionist conspiracy" quite comfortably. Unfortunately all these
phrases occupy an important part of today's rhetoric.
