## Ecology Reforms Not Enough 
### Ned Groth 
"The first lesson o! ecology,"
says Barry Commoner, "is that
everything is connected to
everything else.'' Commoner, a
biologist who has been laying the
groundwork for the sudden
"movement" of environmental
concern between pollution,
exploitative consumption, and ihe
world-spanning militarism of the
US power structure in his article
in the April 4 Sulurdu) Keview.
Paul Ehrlich makes the same
points, in some ways even more
lucidly, in The I'opulalimi Homli.
Both of these men are scientists,
trained to observe and record,
independent of political ideologies
or other values; and many others
have joined them in viewing war
and imperialism as interwoven
parts of the ecological problems
we face.
This analysis of the problem
leads to tbe conclusion that
solutions that touch only the
environmental symptoms of the
disease, without rooting out the
cause, will in the end be
worthless. Beyond that:
solutions—like the ones advocated
in Brandan Lynch's column
Monday- that are based on
inadequate analysis of the cause
of the problem can distract
peoples energies from working on
genuine solutions.

ll the ecology "movement"
aims primarily at changing
individual life-stylos, it will never
approach the sweeping changes in
cultural, political, and economic
values and institutions that will be
required to put us on an
ecologically sound footing. Like
the Free U and the pot-smokers,
the recyclers, Volkswagen drivers
and odd creatures of all types who
run around turning off lights to
reduce power consumption can
anil will be tolerated. Their
impact will be absorbed,
cushioned by the vast majority
who will always do what is easiest,
not what is best.
People are not innately
superconsumers; they have to be
carefully taught. The lessons are
all around everyone every day.
They form the patterns of out
lives.
How do we change those
patterns? We've got to start
somewhere, so why not begin
with out own lives? Fine. But the
individual who reforms his own
values and adopts a better life
style soon finds himself up against
a massive frustration: he learns
that the system can survive
without him. So he has a choice.
He can attempt to get others to
follow his example, to "drop out"
the way he did. Drop out and be
isolated, and get drowned in the
backwash of the (undoubtedly
polluted) mainstream.
Political Power
The other alternative is to go
after political power and try to
impose change on the system
from the top. A thorough look at
American politics shows that that
is traditionally the way changes
occur in this country. Those at
the top make a decision that
changes the behavior of the
majority, and the majority then
adjusts its values to include the
new behavior. Detroit makes it,
we buy it. PG&E makes a deal
with a developer, and 1000 tract

houses have all-electric kitchens.
Look anywhere and the pattern
repeats itself.
The decision makers (those at
the top) repeatedly use the fact
that people ACCEPT having their
choices predetermined as a
rationale for resisting change.
"That's what the consumer
WANTS," they tell lis. "1 can't
change, or I'd go out of business."
It's probably no accident that
the ecology "movement" has
absorbed that corporate
double-think into its embryonic
ideology. (And let's NOT try to
pretend that there isn't any
ideology connected with "Earth
Day"and all the rest.) After all, if
the throw-away container
manufacturers can set up the
Anti-Litter League (which they
did, and sold the idea that it's
the hand that drops it, not the
company that makes it, that is at
fault), why can't the polluting,
earth-eating corporations get
involved in a soul-searching,
breast-beating paroxysm of
concern over "our polluting way
of life?" That way, we can all
work together (it might even
bridge the generation gap), and we
can solve all our problems and all
live happily ever after. Right?
Mot Even Bullshit
I won't even dignify that
proposition by calling it bullshit.
But, incredibly, it reflects the
kind of thinking that is fairly
widespread among the masses of
new recruits to the ecology cause.
The whole tune of the
"movement" so far is to bring
about surface differences in the
way we live that will buy off all
our liberal guilt, without making
any real changes in the underlying
relationshps of power.
Let's talk about the objectives
Brendan sets up in his column
Monday. Recycling of materials,
reduction of energy consumption,
and switching to less damaging
detergents, among others. These
are seemingly worthwhile

goals—although they work against
each other (recycling would
increase energy consumption
something fierce). But what sort
of changes are possible in the
"hard reality" that we are urged
to accept?
We can recycle aluminum cans.
We can got the lead out of gas. We
can turn off the lights, and drive a
car less. We can probably get the
legislature to outlaw throw-away
containers, and set limits on the
nutrient content of detergents.
There are lots of other little ways
we can change our lives to pollute
a little less. They will be and are
being done, because they are more
or less acceptable to the people
who are running the show.
Fu ml amen tal Changes
But what about the
fundamental changes that it will
take to "save" our environment?
Can we replace the auto with a
sane, integrated transportation
system that doesn't pave over a
million acres a year? Can we
reduce US consumption of world
resources to a level commensurate
with our share of the world's
population? How about making it
possible for people to live where
they choose, out on the land,
rather than packed together in
cities Hkc rats in sewers? Can we
stop PG&E from doubling its
energy sales in the next ten years?
Hell no. We can't do any of those
in any sort of reasonable time, let
alone do all of them together,
without creating economic and
political chaos a goal most
people, even those with the best
ecological intentions, avoid like
the plague.
Brendan's solution to these
insoluble dilemmas is to begin by
transforming Stanford into a
model of sound ecological living
and exert moral pressure on the
surrounding communities. (
assume he would stop short of
tearing up the streets to plant
organic gardens, since that might
involve property destruction that

would isolate us from the support
of the "silent majority" outside.)
But 1 wouldn't {jive us much of
a chance to transform Stanford in
any meaningful way. It wouldn't
be enough to just change our way
of life here -we'd be training
people to continue to respect the
earth after they left. Which means
Stanford couldn't really go on
educating people to take jobs that
contribute directly or indirectly
to ripping off resources, or
turning them into consumable
junk. Or helping to build and run
the military machine that enables
the whole thing to go on.
Stanford's Reaction
No, we'd have to make some
pretty fundamental changes in the
good old U. And the people who
run Stanford might not like that.
Teach people to live without cars?
Chrysler's Bill Hewlett might
object. Consume less energy? That
could upset Shell Oil's Richard
McCurdy. Ban superfluous
packaging? Owens-Illinois' Ernie
Arbuckle and Ken Pitzer might
find that thought a little
disturbing.
Yes indeed, if we were very
effective in our eco-movement, we
might even isolate all the rest of
the trustees too! (The same
trustees who last week refused to
lend the support of Stanford's
21,000 shares of General Motors
stock to Ralph Nader's very tame
proxy attempt to inject a little
eco-consciousness into the GM
Board of Directors.)
It will take a lot more than a
little ecological awareness to bring
about the changes eco-activists
envision. It will take a sound
political program, based on a
realistic understanding of the
power relationships and
priority-setting mechanisms of
this society. Raising the issues
isn't enough; we should be
prepared to raise our fists as well.

No, we'd have to make some

It will take a lot more than a

ll the ecology "movement"
aims primarily at changing
individual life-stylos, it will never
approach the sweeping changes in
cultural, political, and economic
values and institutions that will be
required to put us on an
ecologically sound footing. Like
the Free U and the pot-smokers,
the recyclers, Volkswagen drivers
and odd creatures of all types who

anil will be tolerated. Their

who will always do what is easiest,
not what is best.
People are not innately
superconsumers; they have to be
carefully taught. The lessons are
all around everyone every day.
They form the patterns of out
lives.
How do we change those
patterns? We've got to start
somewhere, so why not begin
with out own lives? Fine. But the
individual who reforms his own
values and adopts a better life
style soon finds himself up against
a massive frustration: he learns
that the system can survive
without him. So he has a choice.
He can attempt to get others to
follow his example, to "drop out"
the way he did. Drop out and be
isolated, and get drowned in the
backwash of the (undoubtedly
polluted) mainstream.
Political Power
The other alternative is to go
after political power and try to
impose change on the system
from the top. A thorough look at
American politics shows that that
is traditionally the way changes
occur in this country. Those at

Look anywhere and the pattern
repeats itself.
The decision makers (those at
the top) repeatedly use the fact
that people ACCEPT having their
choices predetermined as a

"That's what the consumer
WANTS," they tell lis. "1 can't

It's probably no accident that

absorbed that corporate
double-think into its embryonic
ideology. (And let's NOT try to
pretend that there isn't any
ideology connected with "Earth
Day"and all the rest.) After all, if
the throw-away container
manufacturers can set up the
Anti-Litter League (which they
did, and sold the idea that it's
the hand that drops it, not the
company that makes it, that is at
fault), why can't the polluting,
earth-eating corporations get
involved in a soul-searching,
breast-beating paroxysm of
concern over "our polluting way
of life?" That way, we can all
work together (it might even
bridge the generation gap), and we
can solve all our problems and all
live happily ever after. Right?
Mot Even Bullshit
I won't even dignify that
proposition by calling it bullshit.
But, incredibly, it reflects the
kind of thinking that is fairly
widespread among the masses of
new recruits to the ecology cause.
The whole tune of the
"movement" so far is to bring
about surface differences in the
way we live that will buy off all
our liberal guilt, without making
any real changes in the underlying
relationshps of power.
Let's talk about the objectives
Brendan sets up in his column
Monday. Recycling of materials,
reduction of energy consumption,
and switching to less damaging
detergents, among others. These
are seemingly worthwhile

goals—although they work against
each other (recycling would
increase energy consumption
something fierce). But what sort
of changes are possible in the
"hard reality" that we are urged
to accept?
We can recycle aluminum cans.
We can got the lead out of gas. We
can turn off the lights, and drive a
car less. We can probably get the
legislature to outlaw throw-away
containers, and set limits on the
nutrient content of detergents.
There are lots of other little ways
we can change our lives to pollute
a little less. They will be and are
being done, because they are more
or less acceptable to the people
who are running the show.
Fu ml amen tal Changes
But what about the
fundamental changes that it will
take to "save" our environment?
Can we replace the auto with a
sane, integrated transportation
system that doesn't pave over a
million acres a year? Can we
reduce US consumption of world
resources to a level commensurate
with our share of the world's
population? How about making it
possible for people to live where
they choose, out on the land,
rather than packed together in
cities Hkc rats in sewers? Can we
stop PG&E from doubling its
energy sales in the next ten years?
Hell no. We can't do any of those
in any sort of reasonable time, let
alone do all of them together,
without creating economic and
political chaos a goal most
people, even those with the best
ecological intentions, avoid like
the plague.
Brendan's solution to these
insoluble dilemmas is to begin by
transforming Stanford into a
model of sound ecological living
and exert moral pressure on the
surrounding communities. (
assume he would stop short of
tearing up the streets to plant
organic gardens, since that might
involve property destruction that

would isolate us from the support
of the "silent majority" outside.)
But 1 wouldn't {jive us much of

Fu ml amen tal Changes
But what about the
fundamental changes that it will
take to "save" our environment?
Can we replace the auto with a
sane, integrated transportation
system that doesn't pave over a
million acres a year? Can we
reduce US consumption of world
resources to a level commensurate
with our share of the world's
population? How about making it
possible for people to live where
they choose, out on the land,
rather than packed together in
cities Hkc rats in sewers? Can we
stop PG&E from doubling its
energy sales in the next ten years?
Hell no. We can't do any of those
in any sort of reasonable time, let
alone do all of them together,
without creating economic and
political chaos a goal most
people, even those with the best
ecological intentions, avoid like
the plague.
Brendan's solution to these
insoluble dilemmas is to begin by
transforming Stanford into a
model of sound ecological living
and exert moral pressure on the
surrounding communities. (
assume he would stop short of
tearing up the streets to plant
organic gardens, since that might
involve property destruction that

would isolate us from the support
of the "silent majority" outside.)
But 1 wouldn't {jive us much of
a chance to transform Stanford in
any meaningful way. It wouldn't
be enough to just change our way
of life here -we'd be training
people to continue to respect the
earth after they left. Which means
Stanford couldn't really go on
educating people to take jobs that
contribute directly or indirectly
to ripping off resources, or
turning them into consumable
junk. Or helping to build and run
the military machine that enables
the whole thing to go on.
Stanford's Reaction
No, we'd have to make some
pretty fundamental changes in the
good old U. And the people who
run Stanford might not like that.
Teach people to live without cars?
Chrysler's Bill Hewlett might
object. Consume less energy? That
could upset Shell Oil's Richard
McCurdy. Ban superfluous
packaging? Owens-Illinois' Ernie
Arbuckle and Ken Pitzer might
find that thought a little

Yes indeed, if we were very
effective in our eco-movement, we
might even isolate all the rest of
the trustees too! (The same
trustees who last week refused to
lend the support of Stanford's
21,000 shares of General Motors
stock to Ralph Nader's very tame
proxy attempt to inject a little
eco-consciousness into the GM
Board of Directors.)
It will take a lot more than a
little ecological awareness to bring
about the changes eco-activists
envision. It will take a sound
political program, based on a
realistic understanding of the
power relationships and
priority-setting mechanisms of
this society. Raising the issues
isn't enough; we should be

ll the ecology "movement"
aims primarily at changing
individual life-stylos, it will never

values and institutions that will be

and odd creatures of all types who

anil will be tolerated. Their

who will always do what is easiest,
not what is best.
People are not innately
superconsumers; they have to be
carefully taught. The lessons are
all around everyone every day.
They form the patterns of out
lives.
How do we change those
patterns? We've got to start
somewhere, so why not begin
with out own lives? Fine. But the
individual who reforms his own
values and adopts a better life
style soon finds himself up against
a massive frustration: he learns
that the system can survive
without him. So he has a choice.
He can attempt to get others to
follow his example, to "drop out"

isolated, and get drowned in the

The other alternative is to go

American politics shows that that

Look anywhere and the pattern
repeats itself.
The decision makers (those at
the top) repeatedly use the fact
that people ACCEPT having their
choices predetermined as a
rationale for resisting change.
"That's what the consumer
WANTS," they tell lis. "1 can't
change, or I'd go out of business."
It's probably no accident that
the ecology "movement" has
absorbed that corporate
double-think into its embryonic
ideology. (And let's NOT try to
pretend that there isn't any
ideology connected with "Earth
Day"and all the rest.) After all, if
the throw-away container
manufacturers can set up the
Anti-Litter League (which they
did, and sold the idea that it's
the hand that drops it, not the
company that makes it, that is at
fault), why can't the polluting,
earth-eating corporations get
involved in a soul-searching,
breast-beating paroxysm of
concern over "our polluting way
of life?" That way, we can all
work together (it might even
bridge the generation gap), and we
can solve all our problems and all
live happily ever after. Right?
Mot Even Bullshit
I won't even dignify that
proposition by calling it bullshit.
But, incredibly, it reflects the
kind of thinking that is fairly
widespread among the masses of
new recruits to the ecology cause.
The whole tune of the
"movement" so far is to bring
about surface differences in the
way we live that will buy off all
our liberal guilt, without making
any real changes in the underlying
relationshps of power.

"That's what the consumer
WANTS," they tell lis. "1 can't

It's probably no accident that
the ecology "movement" has
absorbed that corporate
double-think into its embryonic
ideology. (And let's NOT try to
pretend that there isn't any
ideology connected with "Earth
Day"and all the rest.) After all, if
the throw-away container
manufacturers can set up the
Anti-Litter League (which they
did, and sold the idea that it's
the hand that drops it, not the
company that makes it, that is at
fault), why can't the polluting,
earth-eating corporations get
involved in a soul-searching,
breast-beating paroxysm of
concern over "our polluting way
of life?" That way, we can all
work together (it might even
bridge the generation gap), and we
can solve all our problems and all
live happily ever after. Right?
Mot Even Bullshit
I won't even dignify that
proposition by calling it bullshit.
But, incredibly, it reflects the
kind of thinking that is fairly
widespread among the masses of
new recruits to the ecology cause.
The whole tune of the
"movement" so far is to bring
about surface differences in the
way we live that will buy off all
our liberal guilt, without making
any real changes in the underlying
relationshps of power.
Let's talk about the objectives
Brendan sets up in his column
Monday. Recycling of materials,
reduction of energy consumption,
and switching to less damaging
detergents, among others. These
are seemingly worthwhile

goals—although they work against
each other (recycling would
increase energy consumption
something fierce). But what sort
of changes are possible in the
"hard reality" that we are urged
to accept?
We can recycle aluminum cans.
We can got the lead out of gas. We
can turn off the lights, and drive a
car less. We can probably get the
legislature to outlaw throw-away
containers, and set limits on the
nutrient content of detergents.
There are lots of other little ways
we can change our lives to pollute
a little less. They will be and are
being done, because they are more
or less acceptable to the people
who are running the show.
Fu ml amen tal Changes
But what about the
fundamental changes that it will
take to "save" our environment?
Can we replace the auto with a
sane, integrated transportation
system that doesn't pave over a
million acres a year? Can we
reduce US consumption of world
resources to a level commensurate
with our share of the world's
population? How about making it
possible for people to live where
they choose, out on the land,
rather than packed together in
cities Hkc rats in sewers? Can we
stop PG&E from doubling its
energy sales in the next ten years?
Hell no. We can't do any of those
in any sort of reasonable time, let
alone do all of them together,
without creating economic and
political chaos a goal most
people, even those with the best
ecological intentions, avoid like
the plague.
Brendan's solution to these
insoluble dilemmas is to begin by
transforming Stanford into a
model of sound ecological living
and exert moral pressure on the
surrounding communities. (
assume he would stop short of
tearing up the streets to plant
organic gardens, since that might
involve property destruction that

would isolate us from the support
of the "silent majority" outside.)
But 1 wouldn't {jive us much of
a chance to transform Stanford in
any meaningful way. It wouldn't
be enough to just change our way
of life here -we'd be training
people to continue to respect the
earth after they left. Which means
Stanford couldn't really go on
educating people to take jobs that
contribute directly or indirectly
to ripping off resources, or
turning them into consumable
junk. Or helping to build and run
the military machine that enables
the whole thing to go on.
Stanford's Reaction
No, we'd have to make some
pretty fundamental changes in the
good old U. And the people who
run Stanford might not like that.
Teach people to live without cars?
Chrysler's Bill Hewlett might
object. Consume less energy? That
could upset Shell Oil's Richard
McCurdy. Ban superfluous
packaging? Owens-Illinois' Ernie
Arbuckle and Ken Pitzer might
find that thought a little
disturbing.
Yes indeed, if we were very
effective in our eco-movement, we
might even isolate all the rest of
the trustees too! (The same
trustees who last week refused to
lend the support of Stanford's
21,000 shares of General Motors
stock to Ralph Nader's very tame
proxy attempt to inject a little
eco-consciousness into the GM
Board of Directors.)
It will take a lot more than a
little ecological awareness to bring
about the changes eco-activists
envision. It will take a sound
political program, based on a
realistic understanding of the
power relationships and
priority-setting mechanisms of
this society. Raising the issues
isn't enough; we should be
prepared to raise our fists as well.

"The first lesson o! ecology,"
says Barry Commoner, "is that
everything is connected to
everything else.'' Commoner, a
biologist who has been laying the
groundwork for the sudden
"movement" of environmental
concern between pollution,
exploitative consumption, and ihe
world-spanning militarism of the
US power structure in his article
in the April 4 Sulurdu) Keview.
Paul Ehrlich makes the same
points, in some ways even more
lucidly, in The I'opulalimi Homli.
Both of these men are scientists,
trained to observe and record,
independent of political ideologies
or other values; and many others
have joined them in viewing war
and imperialism as interwoven
parts of the ecological problems
we face.
This analysis of the problem
leads to tbe conclusion that
solutions that touch only the
environmental symptoms of the
disease, without rooting out the
cause, will in the end be
worthless. Beyond that:
solutions—like the ones advocated
in Brandan Lynch's column
Monday- that are based on
inadequate analysis of the cause
of the problem can distract
peoples energies from working on
genuine solutions.

ll the ecology "movement"
aims primarily at changing
individual life-stylos, it will never
approach the sweeping changes in
cultural, political, and economic
values and institutions that will be
required to put us on an
ecologically sound footing. Like
the Free U and the pot-smokers,
the recyclers, Volkswagen drivers
and odd creatures of all types who
run around turning off lights to
reduce power consumption can
anil will be tolerated. Their
impact will be absorbed,
cushioned by the vast majority
who will always do what is easiest,
not what is best.
People are not innately
superconsumers; they have to be
carefully taught. The lessons are
all around everyone every day.
They form the patterns of out
lives.
How do we change those
patterns? We've got to start
somewhere, so why not begin
with out own lives? Fine. But the
individual who reforms his own
values and adopts a better life
style soon finds himself up against
a massive frustration: he learns
that the system can survive
without him. So he has a choice.
He can attempt to get others to
follow his example, to "drop out"
the way he did. Drop out and be
isolated, and get drowned in the
backwash of the (undoubtedly
polluted) mainstream.
Political Power
The other alternative is to go
after political power and try to
impose change on the system
from the top. A thorough look at
American politics shows that that
is traditionally the way changes
occur in this country. Those at
the top make a decision that
changes the behavior of the
majority, and the majority then
adjusts its values to include the
new behavior. Detroit makes it,
we buy it. PG&E makes a deal
with a developer, and 1000 tract

houses have all-electric kitchens.
Look anywhere and the pattern
repeats itself.
The decision makers (those at
the top) repeatedly use the fact
that people ACCEPT having their
choices predetermined as a
rationale for resisting change.
"That's what the consumer
WANTS," they tell lis. "1 can't
change, or I'd go out of business."
It's probably no accident that
the ecology "movement" has
