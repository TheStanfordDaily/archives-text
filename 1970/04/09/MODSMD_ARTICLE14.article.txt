Relish Our Together
Celebrations:
Brothers and Sisters, there is
more to be done than we know.
Goddard's Stones movie just may
have zapped more action than the
Stanford window battle scene.

Lucky for us if we purify
Stanford of ROTC's military glass
that right now doesn't reflect
ourselves or anybody we know.
Plenty of unlucky dudes will still
end up dodging mortar attacks in
Southeast Asia if we don't spread
the vibrations out and see the end
of ROTC as a small sample of the
coming culture.
During the Tuesday afternoon
mill-in most of the radicals
shouted the same old chants
instead of trying to get it together
with the young ROTC cats
outside who were pretty willing to
rap. Let's turn on our ROTC
brothers with whatever medicine
we know of that brings people on
home. Everybody's heard the
radical jargon. Let's not forget the
revolutionary future of Mick
Jagger and Mother Nature's
nurture. Our virile bodies and
minds can find plenty of things to
do that are more exciting than
meetings. Jerry says Do ll!
Once we tune into the coherent

rhythm of the cosmos we won't
need any army or meeting scheme
telling us to organize. And the
reserved officers whatever-it-is will
fade into the horizon. Turn on the
ROTC brothers! Turn on the folks
back home! Turn on Harvey
Hukari! Turn us on!
Relish Our Together
Celebrations!

Broken Windows
An open letter to the members of
OFF ROTC:
Last night, (April 6) for the
second time, members of your
organization staged a planned
attack on the various buildings on
this campus. The one in particular
that concerns me is the Aero and
Astro building, where several plate
windows were destroyed. I have
thus far failed to understand the
reasons for this destruction; could
one of you please explain clearly
why a peace movement destroys
preperty?
Much more damage has been
done than simply broken
windows. I am a first year
graduate student without financial
support from anyone, though I
expect to spend several years
earning my degree in
Astrophysics. I have applied for
financial support from the A A
department but was turned down
for lack of funds. I certainly
would like to have had a chance at
the thousands of dollars that are
going to be spent on new glass.
Your violence may have
justifiable causes, I really don't
care. But are the innocent victums
of your war any better off than
the innocents of Vietnam? If you
really feel your cause can justify
your methods, are you willing to
make ammends to the innocents?
I suggest that each of you
involved in the destruction at the
Aero and Astro building
contribute ten dollars to those of
us who suffer for your actions. I
will need $2400 to pay for next
year's tuition since my loan has
reached its limits. You could send
it to this paper in my name.

Thela Xi Rush
Editor, The l)nil> :
In the April 8 issue of the Daily
there appeared an article by Wally
Thurston entitled "Blackball
System Dying Out as Frats Face
the Future." The article states
that "if the aspiring student tries
Theta Xi he will find the ding
system officially in operation."
The official policy of Theta Xi,
as specified in the house bylaws, is
that a bid for membership shall be
extended to any person interested
in living in the house who receives
an affirmative vote of 75% of the
members voting. This has been
our official policy since January
22, 19GH.
I feel that the mistake made in
the article is worth correcting
because it obscures the whole set
of reforms which Thela Xi has
undertaken during the last five

years. We no longer impose
sophomore work on pledges, but
rather divide house work among
all three classes. We no longer
have any vestige of "hell week"
activities. And we do not operate,
even technically, on a single ding
system.
Donald R. Stebbins
President, Theta Xi

the Editor.)
Child Care
Kditor, The Daily :
Last quarter several articles anc
letters published in the Daily
tended to give the false impression
that the Stanford Community
Children's Center is connected
with other organizations at
Stanford. The principal groups the
Center is rumored to be associated
with are Women's Liberation and
United Stanford Employees.
Some of this misinformation is
undoubtedly fostered by other
activities of members of the
Center. But it should be made
clear that in no way, officially or
unofficially, is the Center itself
connected with other
organizations on or off campus.
Nor does it tacitly endorse the
activities of other groups seeking
improved child care at Stanford.
All policy decisions of the
Center are made by consensus or
majority vote of the members.
Endorsements are handled in a
similar way, a recent example
being the Center's endorsement of
the child care proposal presented
to President Pitzer last week.

Center Coordinator
