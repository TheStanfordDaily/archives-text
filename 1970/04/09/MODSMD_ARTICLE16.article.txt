# Trustees To Consider GM Proxy Shift; Nader Would Vote Stanford Shares
## 
### EMMA PRICE 
The Board of Trustees will
consider voting the University's
2. ,189 shares of General Motors
stock to the Project on Corporate
Responsibility, led by Ralph
Nader.
The Trustees will evaluate
Nader's proposals, and, more
basically, will consider the
(' estion of whether Stanford
should consider social and
political implications in
investment decisions.
Nader, the consumer crusader,
has placed two proposals on the
General Motors shareholders
I —illot because he feels that the
company has operated with
minimal concern for social
responsibility. These call for
election of three representatives
of the public interest to the GM
Board, and the creation of a GM
shareholder "committee for
corporate responsibility." This
would examine General Motors
performance in the areas of
consumer protection, pollution
control, and minority hiring
practices.
Stanford has never before
considered social responsibility in
it estment decisions. The idea
that the University should do so
was first voiced by former ASSU
president Denis Hayes on March
25, 1969. In a letter to President
Pitzer, Hayes stated, "In an age
where an acute awareness is
dawning of 'institutionalized
r c is m ' and other
'institutionalized effects' 1 think it
imperative that we add some new

criteria to the assembling of our
portfolio." He proposed that
Stanford establish an "expert
student-faculty committee to
construct an 'index of social
responsibility."
In the April issue of the
Alumni Almanac, Hayes
elaborated this view. Referring to
University investment, he stated:
"The modern decision-making
process is amoral. Yet
outrageously immoral decisions
are being made."
Anticipate Conflict
"The only way that disruption
can definitely be avoided is by
anticipating potential sources of
conflict and carrying such issues
to a satisfactory resolution. This
was perhaps Dr. Bob Glaser's
greatest talent—but the present
administration sometimes seems
to lack his deftness " Hayes
added.
On April 29, 1961 Mr.
Kenneth Cuthber tson ,
Vice-President for Finance, sent -i
letter to members of the Trustee
Committee on Investments in
which he stated "Based on events
and commentary both here at
Stanlord and nation-wide, it
seems likely that we will have to
lace the issue of social
considerations as they relate to
university investments."
The issue received relatively
little attention until the Nader
proposals were presented to the
public early this year.
Others Contacted
At this point, several groups

and individuals at Stanford
became interested. Mr. Rod
Adams, the University Investment
Manager, wrote to other
universities to find out their plans
regarding the issue.
Bob Grant, student member of
the Board's Finance Committee
brought the matter to the
attention of other students on
Trustee Committees. All agreed
that the topic should be
considered by the Board.
The matter was first presented
to the Finance Committee, which
was chosen because there are no
student members on the
Investments Committee. The
proposals appeared on the Board's
March agenda as a discussion item.
At this meeting the Trustees
voiced objections to Nader's
proposals. Some members
considered voting proxies a poor
method for achieving social
change. It was felt that direct
discussions with management
might be more effective.
In teres 1 Conflicts
Perhaps the chief problem
which the Trustees face is that
most of the members of the Board
are themselves directors of
corporations. As such they are
reluctant to attack their own
co n te m p or a r ie s. F u r th e rmo re,
they have an obvious stake in
preventing Nader type

c»no» holder proposals from
becoming a wide-spread
phenomenon.
After the meeting the
proposals were referred to the
President's staff. President Pitzer
will make a recommendation to
the Board at the April meeting.
Generally the Board acts as the
P res id en t re commends.
Many other universities are also
considering the Nader proposals.
Last Monday the Trustees
Investment Committee of the
University of Pennsylvania
decided to vote all of that school's
29,H93 CM shares to Ralph
Nader. The University of Michigan
announced that it would hold an
election of faculty and students,
then divide the proxies of its
27,4 38 shares according to the
percentage vote count.
Students at Harvard, MIT, and
Brown have all petitioned their
Trustees to vote their school's
holdings to Nader.
Support for the proposals has
already been expressed by some
members of the Stanford
Community. The ASSU Senate, a
SWOPSI course on Stanford
Investments and Social
Responsibility, and the
Committee for Corporate Reform
of the Business School have all
sent statements to the Board
recommending adoption of the
Nader resolutions.
