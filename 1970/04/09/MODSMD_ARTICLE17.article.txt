T e Stanford Student Community:
I am today withdrawing my candidacy for President of the Associated
Students of Stanford University.
I do so in part in an effort to allow the student body to consider a smaller
slate of candidates, and in a larger sense to urge the Association to reevaluate its
role in the University Community. During the past several years, the role and
influence to the student body in the university has, it seems to me, gone from
passive to apathetic.
Wo members of the Association must consider that Stanford University
• Uiild no' exist at the whim of David Packard and his cohorts - nor should it
in i medieval fief more or less despotKally controlled by Kenneth Pitzer. The
interference with the processes of self-government by the University President,
Piii ticularly evidenced in the matter of appointments to Trustee Committees,
ha ; been overwhelming. And the blanket acceptance of these presidential
ctcr.roes by the present ASSU Presidents and the ASSU Senate has been
disappointing. As a further point in fact, the existence and maintenance of an
"undefined residual authority" of the President of the University in iudicial
.nattors allowing him the ad lib prerogative to amend, append, or translate
decisions of the SJC should be equally ambiguous to a student body which is
">'-> posed to be a respectable, self-governing, self-maintaining entity in the
. liversity community.
When I asked Kenneth Pitzer when he was still President-designate at a
meeting in Rinconada House: "What is the role of the student in the
University?" he wouldn't even attempt to answer the question. When I
narrowed the field to the problem of possible student dissatisfaction with the
running of the University, his suggested means of its alleviation became: "Write
a letter to the DAILY."
It we are to have a de facto one man rule on this campus, then that should be
i ide abundantly clear to us, and we can abandon a useless Association and a
pnwerless presidency and Senate. I don't think that this is what we want - nor is
it something which we will accept.in actual or practical fact.
112 our years ago in his successful campaign for Student Body President, David
lorris noted: "It is time to raise important questions." The time hasn't
changed: It is time for the student body to evaluate its present role in the
University and to consider where il wants to go from here. The President of the
Association must be more than subservient to the University President, and,
indeed, must be even more than a representative of the student body. He must
be both responsive and responsible to its collective heads - to aid and assist it in
t , orning the University.
To that end I tind only one slate of candidates remarkable, and I personally
look forward to their election. I thank my supporters in the School of
Medicine, my supporters throughout the University, and my able runningmate,
David Swift, and I commend to them the election of John F. Shoch as ASSU
President and Bill b vers as ASSU Vice-President.

I am today withdrawing my candidacy for President of the Associated
Students of Stanford University.
I do so in part in an effort to allow the student body to consider a smaller
slate of candidates, and in a larger sense to urge the Association to reevaluate its
role in the University Community. During the past several years, the role and
influence to the student body in the university has, it seems to me, gone from
passive to apathetic.
Wo members of the Association must consider that Stanford University
• Uiild no' exist at the whim of David Packard and his cohorts - nor should it
in i medieval fief more or less despotKally controlled by Kenneth Pitzer. The
interference with the processes of self-government by the University President,
Piii ticularly evidenced in the matter of appointments to Trustee Committees,
ha ; been overwhelming. And the blanket acceptance of these presidential
ctcr.roes by the present ASSU Presidents and the ASSU Senate has been
disappointing. As a further point in fact, the existence and maintenance of an
"undefined residual authority" of the President of the University in iudicial
.nattors allowing him the ad lib prerogative to amend, append, or translate
decisions of the SJC should be equally ambiguous to a student body which is
">'-> posed to be a respectable, self-governing, self-maintaining entity in the
. liversity community.
When I asked Kenneth Pitzer when he was still President-designate at a
meeting in Rinconada House: "What is the role of the student in the
University?" he wouldn't even attempt to answer the question. When I
narrowed the field to the problem of possible student dissatisfaction with the
running of the University, his suggested means of its alleviation became: "Write
a letter to the DAILY."
It we are to have a de facto one man rule on this campus, then that should be
i ide abundantly clear to us, and we can abandon a useless Association and a
pnwerless presidency and Senate. I don't think that this is what we want - nor is
it something which we will accept.in actual or practical fact.
112 our years ago in his successful campaign for Student Body President, David
lorris noted: "It is time to raise important questions." The time hasn't
changed: It is time for the student body to evaluate its present role in the
University and to consider where il wants to go from here. The President of the
Association must be more than subservient to the University President, and,
indeed, must be even more than a representative of the student body. He must
be both responsive and responsible to its collective heads - to aid and assist it in
t , orning the University.
To that end I tind only one slate of candidates remarkable, and I personally
look forward to their election. I thank my supporters in the School of
Medicine, my supporters throughout the University, and my able runningmate,
David Swift, and I commend to them the election of John F. Shoch as ASSU
President and Bill b vers as ASSU Vice-President.
