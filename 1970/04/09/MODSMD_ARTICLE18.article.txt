# April 15 Moratorium
## 'Hair' To Sing At Sunrise 
### 
The planning has been
completed and the organizational
machine for the April Moratorium
is now beginning to take shape.
Moratorium leaders are billing this
ri. mth's program—which includes
canvassing, leafletting, dorm
meetings, a march and rally in San
Mateo, and a "Festival of
Life" as "the most massive and
intensive effort by the
Moratorium since November."
Headlining the April schedule
,'.ll be the "Festival of
Life Dawning of Peace" program
at 6 a.m., April 15, in Frost
Amphitheatre. Featured in the
program will be the San Francisco
cast of "Hair," who will do a one
hour adaptation of their show.
Speaking will be Congressman
C.orge Brown, whom the
Moratorium has endorsed for the
U.S. Senate, and Assemblyman
John Vasconcellos, endorsed for
reelection by the Moratorium.
The two will discuss the
re-ordering of national priorities
"for peace and life rather than
v .ir and death."
Other candidates endorsed by
the Moratorium —Stu McClean for
Congress, John Rutherford for
State Senate, and Ken Croft for
State Assembly—will be
introduced.
Other big name rock groups, as
y-1 undisclosed, will play for the
remainder of the program, till
1 t :30.
Dorrn Discussions
Meetings in dormitories took
place last night, and will continue
tonight. with discussions after
d iner in the following lounges:
Dinner and Serra (Stern), Olivo
and Naranja (Lagunita), Roble,
and Toyon.
'.The after-dinner discussion
hours with faculty members are
focusing on several subjects: the
pl'a.ns and activities of the April
Moratorium and other anti-war
groups, the goals and tactics of
Off-ROTC, and the desirability of
KOTC itself. Student Moratoirum
leaders are hoping that the

discussions will stimulate a "more
careful and rational consideration
of the dangers of violence as a
means of protest." By offering the
plans and activities of the
Moratorium as non-violent
alternative for anti-war action.
Moratorium coordinators hope to
counter the tactics of window
smashing, which they claim are
"self-defeating."
The dormitory meetings are
also being used to recruit students
for the canvassing and leafletting
efforts in the community this
Saturday. These efforts will be
directed toward expanding the
Moratorium's base of support and
informing people of the economic
and social costs of the war.
Kconomic Focus
Moratorium leaders, both
locally and nationally, see the
economic aspects of the war as a
major focus for April. People,
having just paid their income tax,
will understand more clearly how
devastating the costs of the war
have been, or so the Moratorium
leaders believe. A leaflet entitled
"Paid in Full" has been prepared
for the Moratorium which enabies
people to compute exactly how
much they personally are
spending on I he war. The leaflet
also points toward California's
great reliance on the war for
economic security ("Almost 2 of
every 5 manufacturing jobs here
are in defense-related activities.")
It is hoped that the canvassing
this Saturday will not only
confront people with the
economic costs of the war, but
also remind them that the war is
continuing "with no end in sight."
Canvassers will attempt to
encourage support for anti-war
candidates, and involve more
people in the 91 neighborhood
groups that form the backbone of
the Moratorium in the
community.
On Saturday, and on the
remaining days before the
"Festival of Life program,"

leafletting will be conducted in
shopping centers, business
districts, and industrial parks to
familiarize people wilh the issues
and inform them of the April 15
program.
Kcology Months
After l he major morning
program on April 15, there will be
several booths set up in Frost
Amphitheatre which will offer
people a number of alternatives
for action in politics and ecology.
The booths, which will be manned
till 1 1:30 in the morning, will
include such groups as Zero
Population Growth, Planned
Parenthood, and The George
Brown for Senate campaign.
The quality of life will be a
major theme of April 15, and
Moratorium leaders are hoping to
demonstrate thai the issues of the
war and ecology are interrelated.
"Not only do pollution and war
spring from the same institutions
in America," notes one student
coordinator, "but the money
needed to effectively attack the
former is. being squandered to
finance the latter."
At 11:30 on April 15, buses

will leave from Frost for what is
termed as "a major march and
rally" in San Mateo. The major
emphasis of the San Mateo
program will be to protest the use
of tax dollars to continue the war
in Vietnam. The march will move
from the Hillsdale Shopping
Center to Central Park by way of
the Internal Revenue Service
building. A short rally in the park
at noon will feature Admiral
Arnold True and Prof. Martin
Carnoy as speakers.
Tax Day
i The protest is specifically
planned to come on the same day
as income taxes are due. Marchers
will be encouraged to fill out
statements protesting the use of
their tax dollars for the
continuation of the war. These
will be deposited at the IRS
center dirinti the march.
This month's protest, notes
Moratorium Chairman John
Kramer, also comes at a time
when the President will be making
future decisions on troop
reductions, and the commitment
of more American support to the
fight inn in Laos and Cambodia.

After l he major morning
program on April 15, there will be
several booths set up in Frost
Amphitheatre which will offer
people a number of alternatives
for action in politics and ecology.
The booths, which will be manned
till 1 1:30 in the morning, will
include such groups as Zero
Population Growth, Planned
Parenthood, and The George
Brown for Senate campaign.
The quality of life will be a
major theme of April 15, and
Moratorium leaders are hoping to
demonstrate thai the issues of the
war and ecology are interrelated.
"Not only do pollution and war
spring from the same institutions
in America," notes one student
coordinator, "but the money
needed to effectively attack the
former is. being squandered to
finance the latter."
At 11:30 on April 15, buses

will leave from Frost for what is
termed as "a major march and
rally" in San Mateo. The major
emphasis of the San Mateo
program will be to protest the use
of tax dollars to continue the war
in Vietnam. The march will move
from the Hillsdale Shopping
Center to Central Park by way of
the Internal Revenue Service
building. A short rally in the park
at noon will feature Admiral
Arnold True and Prof. Martin
Carnoy as speakers.
Tax Day
i The protest is specifically
planned to come on the same day
as income taxes are due. Marchers
will be encouraged to fill out
statements protesting the use of
their tax dollars for the
continuation of the war. These
will be deposited at the IRS
center dirinti the march.
This month's protest, notes
Moratorium Chairman John
Kramer, also comes at a time
when the President will be making
future decisions on troop
reductions, and the commitment
of more American support to the
fight inn in Laos and Cambodia.
The planning has been
completed and the organizational
machine for the April Moratorium
is now beginning to take shape.
Moratorium leaders are billing this
ri. mth's program—which includes
canvassing, leafletting, dorm
meetings, a march and rally in San
Mateo, and a "Festival of
Life" as "the most massive and
intensive effort by the
Moratorium since November."
Headlining the April schedule
,'.ll be the "Festival of
Life Dawning of Peace" program
at 6 a.m., April 15, in Frost
Amphitheatre. Featured in the
program will be the San Francisco
cast of "Hair," who will do a one
hour adaptation of their show.
Speaking will be Congressman
C.orge Brown, whom the
Moratorium has endorsed for the
U.S. Senate, and Assemblyman
John Vasconcellos, endorsed for
reelection by the Moratorium.
The two will discuss the
re-ordering of national priorities
"for peace and life rather than
v .ir and death."
Other candidates endorsed by
the Moratorium —Stu McClean for
Congress, John Rutherford for
State Senate, and Ken Croft for
State Assembly—will be
introduced.
Other big name rock groups, as
y-1 undisclosed, will play for the
remainder of the program, till
1 t :30.
Dorrn Discussions
Meetings in dormitories took
place last night, and will continue
tonight. with discussions after
d iner in the following lounges:
Dinner and Serra (Stern), Olivo
and Naranja (Lagunita), Roble,
and Toyon.
'.The after-dinner discussion
hours with faculty members are
focusing on several subjects: the
pl'a.ns and activities of the April
Moratorium and other anti-war
groups, the goals and tactics of
Off-ROTC, and the desirability of
KOTC itself. Student Moratoirum
leaders are hoping that the

discussions will stimulate a "more
careful and rational consideration
of the dangers of violence as a
means of protest." By offering the
plans and activities of the
Moratorium as non-violent
alternative for anti-war action.
Moratorium coordinators hope to
counter the tactics of window
smashing, which they claim are
"self-defeating."
The dormitory meetings are
also being used to recruit students
for the canvassing and leafletting
efforts in the community this
Saturday. These efforts will be
directed toward expanding the
Moratorium's base of support and
informing people of the economic
and social costs of the war.
Kconomic Focus
Moratorium leaders, both
locally and nationally, see the
economic aspects of the war as a
major focus for April. People,
having just paid their income tax,
will understand more clearly how
devastating the costs of the war
have been, or so the Moratorium
leaders believe. A leaflet entitled
"Paid in Full" has been prepared
for the Moratorium which enabies
people to compute exactly how
much they personally are
spending on I he war. The leaflet
also points toward California's
great reliance on the war for
economic security ("Almost 2 of
every 5 manufacturing jobs here
are in defense-related activities.")
It is hoped that the canvassing
this Saturday will not only
confront people with the
economic costs of the war, but
also remind them that the war is
continuing "with no end in sight."
Canvassers will attempt to
encourage support for anti-war
candidates, and involve more

place last night, and will continue
tonight. with discussions after
d iner in the following lounges:
Dinner and Serra (Stern), Olivo
and Naranja (Lagunita), Roble,
and Toyon.
'.The after-dinner discussion
hours with faculty members are
focusing on several subjects: the
pl'a.ns and activities of the April
Moratorium and other anti-war
groups, the goals and tactics of
Off-ROTC, and the desirability of
KOTC itself. Student Moratoirum
leaders are hoping that the

discussions will stimulate a "more
careful and rational consideration
of the dangers of violence as a
means of protest." By offering the
plans and activities of the
Moratorium as non-violent
alternative for anti-war action.
Moratorium coordinators hope to
counter the tactics of window
smashing, which they claim are
"self-defeating."
The dormitory meetings are
also being used to recruit students
for the canvassing and leafletting
efforts in the community this
Saturday. These efforts will be
directed toward expanding the
Moratorium's base of support and
informing people of the economic
and social costs of the war.
Kconomic Focus
Moratorium leaders, both
locally and nationally, see the
economic aspects of the war as a
major focus for April. People,
having just paid their income tax,
will understand more clearly how
devastating the costs of the war
have been, or so the Moratorium
leaders believe. A leaflet entitled
"Paid in Full" has been prepared
for the Moratorium which enabies
people to compute exactly how
much they personally are
spending on I he war. The leaflet
also points toward California's
great reliance on the war for
economic security ("Almost 2 of
every 5 manufacturing jobs here
are in defense-related activities.")
It is hoped that the canvassing
this Saturday will not only
confront people with the
economic costs of the war, but
also remind them that the war is
continuing "with no end in sight."
Canvassers will attempt to
encourage support for anti-war
candidates, and involve more
people in the 91 neighborhood
groups that form the backbone of
the Moratorium in the
community.
On Saturday, and on the
remaining days before the
"Festival of Life program,"

leafletting will be conducted in
shopping centers, business
districts, and industrial parks to
familiarize people wilh the issues
and inform them of the April 15
program.
Kcology Months
After l he major morning
program on April 15, there will be
several booths set up in Frost
Amphitheatre which will offer
people a number of alternatives
for action in politics and ecology.
The booths, which will be manned
till 1 1:30 in the morning, will
include such groups as Zero
Population Growth, Planned
Parenthood, and The George
Brown for Senate campaign.
The quality of life will be a
major theme of April 15, and
Moratorium leaders are hoping to
demonstrate thai the issues of the
war and ecology are interrelated.
"Not only do pollution and war
spring from the same institutions
in America," notes one student
coordinator, "but the money
needed to effectively attack the
former is. being squandered to
finance the latter."
At 11:30 on April 15, buses

will leave from Frost for what is
termed as "a major march and
rally" in San Mateo. The major
emphasis of the San Mateo
program will be to protest the use
of tax dollars to continue the war
in Vietnam. The march will move
from the Hillsdale Shopping
Center to Central Park by way of
the Internal Revenue Service
building. A short rally in the park
at noon will feature Admiral
Arnold True and Prof. Martin
Carnoy as speakers.
Tax Day
i The protest is specifically
planned to come on the same day
as income taxes are due. Marchers
will be encouraged to fill out
statements protesting the use of
their tax dollars for the
continuation of the war. These
will be deposited at the IRS
center dirinti the march.
This month's protest, notes
Moratorium Chairman John
Kramer, also comes at a time
when the President will be making
future decisions on troop
reductions, and the commitment
of more American support to the
fight inn in Laos and Cambodia.
The planning has been
completed and the organizational
machine for the April Moratorium
is now beginning to take shape.
Moratorium leaders are billing this
ri. mth's program—which includes
canvassing, leafletting, dorm
meetings, a march and rally in San
Mateo, and a "Festival of
Life" as "the most massive and
intensive effort by the
Moratorium since November."
Headlining the April schedule
,'.ll be the "Festival of
Life Dawning of Peace" program
at 6 a.m., April 15, in Frost
Amphitheatre. Featured in the
program will be the San Francisco
cast of "Hair," who will do a one
hour adaptation of their show.
Speaking will be Congressman
C.orge Brown, whom the
Moratorium has endorsed for the
U.S. Senate, and Assemblyman
John Vasconcellos, endorsed for
reelection by the Moratorium.
The two will discuss the
re-ordering of national priorities
"for peace and life rather than
v .ir and death."
Other candidates endorsed by
the Moratorium —Stu McClean for
Congress, John Rutherford for
State Senate, and Ken Croft for
