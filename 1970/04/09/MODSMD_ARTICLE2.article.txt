## Senate Rejects Carswell 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate rejected the Supreme
Court nomination of G. Harrold
Carswell Wednesday by a
surprising 51-45 vote that touched
off pandemonium in the staid and
ornate old chamber.
After the Senate's rejection of
a second Southern judge for the
Court, Republican senators are
urging President Nixon to consult
them before submitting another
nomination.

In the wake of the Senate vote
against confirming Judge Carswell,
the White House gave no hint of
Nixon's third choice for the court
vacancy.
Press Secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said another nomination
will be made "in due course," and
he did not rule out the possibility
Nixon might wait until after the
November election.
Sen. Robert J. Dole, R-Kan., a
strong Carswell supporter,
suggested the administration take
- the issue to voters, but he also
told newsmen "a little earthy
discussion with senators" would
be advisable before the
administration selects another
nominee.

A flurry of b ick-to-work
movements Wednesday checked
the growth of a nationwide truck
drivers' strike as Teamsters union
officials met in Washington to

discuss the widespread walkout.
Striking truckers were back on
the job in Oakland, Calif.,
Milwaukee, Minneapolis,
Carlstadt, N.J., and several West
Virginia communities.
But the effect of their actions
was partly counterbalanced by a
wildcat walkout that hit a major
Chicago grocery chain and a
picket line that some 1,000 steel
haulers in Gary, Ind., declined to
cross.
The drivers are striking to
express their disapproval of a
tentative national contract
hammered out last week in
Washingl on.
Nearly 15,000 employees of
Detroit's Big Three automakers
either were laid off or working
curtailed shifts because of
trucking titjups. The scarcity of
goods to deliver forced layoffs of
nonstr iking drivers in Salt Lake
City, Las Vegas, Kansas City and
Cincinnati.
