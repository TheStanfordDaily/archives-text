### 
Jim Schnieder, president of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community resigned his post
Tuesday for reasons resulting
from "a combination of recent
campus events and personal
circumstances."
In a letter to the CAC
Executive Board dated April 7,
Schnieder commented that "never [
before has the overwhelming
majority of students so clearly
rejected the use of violence and
intimidation in settling University
affairs."
Schnieder continued to say
that he feels secure at this time to
focus the bulk of his attention on j
the "demanding duties of a i
graduating senior."
Schnieder expressed optimism
over the involvement of the
"mainstream of students" in
bringing about "broad and
positive social change" within the
Stanford community. He praised .
the new curricular programs
which have innovated measures
aimed at solving local, national,
and world problems.
Also singled out were "new
and improved channels for
communication and grievance
procedures," as well as "many
other forward looking
innovations."
The CAC ran a full page ad in
the I>aiI> on the anniversary of
the April Third Movement in
opposition to the violent arm of
the anti-ROTC movement. In his
letter of resignation, Schnieder

noted that "the Community now
recognizes that those creating the
problem currently facing the
University are, for the most part,
non-students and, excepting a few
tag-alongs, are committed and
violent revolutionaries."
He added that "just as
Stanford students would reject

the association and axe handle of
Lester Maddox, they are rejecting
the association and rocks of
Lenny Siegal."
Schnieder remains "confident
that the CAC will continue its
worthwhile function under the
leadership of its Executive and
Advisory Boards."
