# Lawyer Discusses Ecology

### CATHY COOPER 
"How do we get corporations
to cease their barbarous use of our
environment?," asked Phillip
Berry, President of the Sierra club
in his address to the Business
School on Wednesday. Speakong
on the "Role of the Businessman
in Conservation" he said "we
must talk about law since there is
little likelihood that corporations
will act voluntarily to protect the
environment."
Berry proposed a Federal law
making protection of the
environment one of the legally
specified purposes of the
corporations. Such a law would
not only require corporations to
think about the effects of their
actions on the eco-system at every
stage of their operations. It would
also make it possible for a single
stockholder to secure a court
injunction halting corporate
destruction of the surroundings.
"The modern corporation is
the part of the government that
got away," said Berry. "It is these
corporations that are making the
decisions that will effect the
quality of life in the future.
Environmentalists are insisting
that we must recognize our
environment as capital which
must be protected."
Berry predicted that if business
does not quickly accept
responsibility for environmental
protection those advocating j
government take-over of business
will increase in number. If
socialism ever comes to this
country it will not be because the
theories of Marx, he said, but in
response to the environmental
crisis.
Berry labeled Standard Oil's
willful failure to install storm
chokes on their Gulf oil wells an
"uncivilized act." Citing the
current penalties against such
infractions as "grossly
inadequate," the youthful
attorney stated that the only way
to hurt large corporations is
through class action law suits with
billion dollar punitive damages
attached. "".Those people are going
to have to learn that the people
give a damn."
The Sierra Club has been
highly successful in the past ten
years with lawsuits on
conservation issues. Berry further
predicted that the courts are
ready to hear more such suits. In :
the future the Sierra Club will j
spend less of its money on slick
publications and more on
"environmental survival," he
promised.
Berry's appearance was part of
"Survival in the 70's: A Forum on
the Environment" sponsored by
the Conservation Consultants of
the Graduate School of Business.
The Forum will present
engineering professor Rolf
Eliassen on the topic "Technology
and Environment" on Tuesday,
April 14.
