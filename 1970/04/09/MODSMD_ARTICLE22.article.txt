# 'Street Crier' Prints Shown At Gallery
## 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
An art exhibit focusing on a
theme, such as the depiction of
Street Criers and Itinerant
Tradesmen, offers a viewer
twofold enjoyment. The
extensive collection of 17th, 18th
and 19th century European prints
now on display at the Stanford
Gallery have immediate artistic
interest, as well as chronicling a
curious aspect of folk history.
Professor Dwight Miller of the
Stanford Art Department and
curator of 17th and 1 Bth century
art at the Stanford Art Museum
assembled the exhibit and wrote
the catalogue. His interest in the
theme stems from the early fifties
when he became aware of the
abundance of such prints and the
popularity they held among the
public during their own time.
Print Production
The prints were produced and
sold in sets, or suites; each suite
showing usually one locale, such
as London, and each seperate
print illustrating a street crier
with a different product to sell.
Their popularity reached its peak
in the late 18th and early 19th
century.
The prints in the Stanford show
contain varied examples of the
more than 300 suites of prints
known to have been produced.
They represent artists such as
Hogarth, Boucher, Greuze and
Rembrandt, and the cities of
Venice, London, Paris, and
Vienna.
Many of the prints include
verses in various dialects and bars
of music which were sung by the
tradesmen pictured. These
itinerant salesmen were usually of
the lower class of the large cities
and were considered a pecularity
of their own time.
Depiction of itinerant salesmen
in print had some gradual
influences on tradition methods
of illustration. Artists responded
directly and spontaneously to the
characters and were thus forced to
drop previously held ideas of

style. A new vocabulary of
expression was developed to solve
the new range of problems.
Significance ot Genre
In the introduction to his
catalogue Prof. Miller discusses
the importance of the prints: "It
is an example of that confluence
of popular vernacular culture with
artistic tradition, which has
always proved to be so
invigorating a process in European
art. The variegated and lusty
panorama of life in the streets of
the great European cities provided
artists with a rich fund of
material."
Prof. Miller goes on to explain
why the subject is historically
relevant: "A whole subculture of
street cry doggerel accumulated
from the later Middle Ages on,
rich in idiomatic nuances and
local flavor, and affording the
social historian of today with

intriguing insights into domestic
customs and manners of particular
times and places in the past.
Indeed, the history of street cries
is also the history of social
change."
The exhibit will remain at the
Stanford Art Gallery through May
3rd. It will travel to the
Achenback Foundation for the
Graphic Arts at the California
Palace of the Legion of Honor for
a showing of May 9th to sth of
July. The beautifully illustrated
catalogue which supplements the
exhibition as well as being a
complete book in itself, was
released today and is on sale at
the Gallery Bookstore.
New works by Robert
Mother*ell will be on display in
the Stanford Museum April 14th
through May 3rd. This exhibit will
be discussed in the I>aiI> next
week.
