## Bunuel's 'Olvidados' Showing 
### DRANREB AREVIR CYNTHIA WEBER 
"The Young and the Damned"
is about misery, destitute
individuals, the children of the
streets, the Olvidados. There is
Jaibo, a cruel and treacherous
Mexican teenager who escaped
from the reformatory; Pedro, a
younger boy whose fate, like the
other members of the gang, is
controlled by Jaibo; Pedro's
mother who realizes her mistake
only after her son is imprisoned;
and the Blind Man, the most
ambiguous character in the film,
who, in conflict between good
and evil, finally is no better than
Jaibo.
Compromise
At the time "Los Olividados"
was made (1951), it was difficult
for Luis Bunuel to show how bad
the social conditions actually
were. Consequently, to avoid
problems of censorship, he
compromised and included
unnecessary moralizing.
The prologue emphasized that
such problems are universal and
not peculiar to Mexico. Moreover,
a benevolent image of the state is

purposely overstated in the person
of the director of a state
reformatory.
Overlooking such mistakes
obviously incongruous with the
style of the rest of the film, one
must appreciate Bunuel's craft in
presenting the tragedy of the
Olvidados.
The very symbol of this tragedy
is in the first shot of the film that
of a corrida (bullfight), merely a
game played by children. Only a
parody in the beginning, the
corrida soon becomes real and
deadly.
The entire film is a series of
corridas that take different forms,
with different people, in different
places. The heroes are successively
the bull and the torero - the one
who is killed and the one who
kills. The camera takes the point
of view of the spectator in an
arena when the children, under
the direction of Jaibo, attack the
blind man, when they assault a
legless cripple, and when Jaibo
kills Julian.
Each individual is fated and
realizes that death is inevitable.
The tragedy is in the perpetual

struggle for survival and in the
fear of not knowing how and
when death will win. Pedro is
beaten to death in a deserted barn
and Jaibo is shot late at night in
the street. No one is around when
they live or die. They are
Olvidados.
Undcrstalcm cnt
The tragedy is always
understated. There is nothing
sensational or overly dramatic as
the English translation implies.
The title is not "The Young and
the Damned" but rather "The
Olvidados": a mere adjective - the
forgotten. All the people are

forgotten; Pedro by his mother,
the blind/musician by the crowds
he entertains, the legless cripple
by the passerby. Each one of
them is 'alone', has been and will
'always' stay alone. Those were
the last words of Jaibo before he
died.
The last sequence of the film
shows Pedro dead, being thrown
at night into a garbage dump.
Such is the fate of the Olvidados.

"The Young and the Damned"
is about misery, destitute
individuals, the children of the
streets, the Olvidados. There is
Jaibo, a cruel and treacherous
Mexican teenager who escaped
from the reformatory; Pedro, a
younger boy whose fate, like the
other members of the gang, is
controlled by Jaibo; Pedro's
mother who realizes her mistake
only after her son is imprisoned;
and the Blind Man, the most
ambiguous character in the film,
who, in conflict between good
and evil, finally is no better than
Jaibo.
Compromise
At the time "Los Olividados"
was made (1951), it was difficult
for Luis Bunuel to show how bad
the social conditions actually
were. Consequently, to avoid
problems of censorship, he
compromised and included
unnecessary moralizing.
The prologue emphasized that
such problems are universal and
not peculiar to Mexico. Moreover,
a benevolent image of the state is

purposely overstated in the person
of the director of a state
reformatory.
Overlooking such mistakes
obviously incongruous with the
style of the rest of the film, one
must appreciate Bunuel's craft in
presenting the tragedy of the
Olvidados.
The very symbol of this tragedy
is in the first shot of the film that
of a corrida (bullfight), merely a
game played by children. Only a
parody in the beginning, the
corrida soon becomes real and
deadly.
The entire film is a series of
corridas that take different forms,
with different people, in different
places. The heroes are successively
the bull and the torero - the one
who is killed and the one who
kills. The camera takes the point
of view of the spectator in an
arena when the children, under
the direction of Jaibo, attack the
blind man, when they assault a
legless cripple, and when Jaibo
kills Julian.
Each individual is fated and
realizes that death is inevitable.
The tragedy is in the perpetual

struggle for survival and in the
fear of not knowing how and
when death will win. Pedro is
beaten to death in a deserted barn
and Jaibo is shot late at night in
the street. No one is around when
they live or die. They are
Olvidados.
Undcrstalcm cnt
The tragedy is always
understated. There is nothing
sensational or overly dramatic as
the English translation implies.
The title is not "The Young and
the Damned" but rather "The
Olvidados": a mere adjective - the
forgotten. All the people are

forgotten; Pedro by his mother,
the blind/musician by the crowds
he entertains, the legless cripple
by the passerby. Each one of
them is 'alone', has been and will
'always' stay alone. Those were
the last words of Jaibo before he
died.
The last sequence of the film
shows Pedro dead, being thrown
at night into a garbage dump.
Such is the fate of the Olvidados.

"Los Olvidados" is being shown
by the International Association
tonight at 7:45 in Cubberly
Auditorium.
