# Marceau Captures Stanford Audience
## 
### GARY SALT 
Marcel Marceau is one of perhaps a handful of solo performers who
can command audiences simply by the purity and excellence of their
art.
He has brought his style pantomines and the escapades of his
alter-ego, Bip, to the United States and Canada for a three-month
tour, doubtless as successful as his previous visits if Bay Area reaction
is suggestive. Seeing Marceau again last weekend, I was reminded of
the statement that "gesture is the countenance of the soul," a
judgement well-suited to many of Marceau's mimodramas.
Routines Mature
His inventory at Stanford and for the tour in general includes many
familiar, many now world-famous routines that have matured with
their creator; timeless routines derived from timeless themes and
situations - from the multifarious characters inhabiting the "Public
Garden," to an archetype conflict in "The Creation of the World," or
"Bip as David and Goliath."
Marceau's comedy boils up from innumerable springs. Since he
creates all his "props" in thin air, objects are always mutable.
Consequently, as a street musician Bip's violin is countless
instruments, each changing to match whatever music he hears.
Such notions as surprise, discovery, height, danger, or fear acquire
new dimensions without words, objects, or other performers around
to deny them. Thus, as a tightrope walker, Marceau creates a fear of
height which leads to unintended, spectacular feats on the high wire.
Matador Bip stomps boldly toward a lethargic bull coaxing him to
charge. Fireman Bip, who lights his cigar off a burning building,
becomes an accidental hero who must later be saved from a fire
himself.
Digging David
The Stanford audience seemed to rate "Bip as David and Goliath,"
among its favorits. Using a black flat center-stage as a "changing" area,
Marceau slips back and forth with such rapidity and precision that the
momentary illusion of two people becomes a sustained illusion.
Goliath's hand slips behind the left side of the screen a split-second
before David's head appears at the right. Or maybe they were there at
the same time? Or maybe . . .?
In pantomines such as this and several others, Marceau revealed the
outer reaches of his techniques and his artistry in the extra-ordinary
moments of genius that many of us had come expecting to sec.
