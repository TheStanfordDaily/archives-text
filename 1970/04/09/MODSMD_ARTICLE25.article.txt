# The 						Athletic Safety Gap-
## Dangerous Plays And Trainer Shortages 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
ireaking from the line of scrimmage at the snap, the fleet wide
receiver streaks down field for twenty yards, then abruptly cuts
towards the sidelines. Just after changing directions he looks bach
towards the quarterback and begins to see the football,
perfectly -thrown, coining right at him. With a magnificently timed
leap the receiver grabs the bull and turns once more, this time towards
the goal line. Only a free safely' the sole defender not faked out on
the play, stands between the receiver and six points.
By now the crowd is roaring, as the two streak to the endzone. And
at the last minute the safety throws himself at the receiver's knees,
effectively knocking him out of bounds and preventing the
touchdown. As play resumes, few notice that the receiver has failed to
get up and reenter the game.
Fewer still notice that he has to be helped to a seat on the bench,
where he sits in agonizing pain while a doctor and a trainer concur on
a fast and it turns out accurate diagnosis. The player has sustained a
dislocation of the knee, possibly torn ligaments, will require surgery

and won't soon play again. Should complications develop, he might
never re I urn.
And on the other side of the field, the safety who so successfully
broke up the play has returned to the bench complaining of pains in
his side There's a good chance that lie has suffered a bruised spleen or
kidney, perhaps a cracked rib. Although he continues to play, the
team doctor will make a point of examining him after the game.
The situation is hypothetical but hardly far-fetched. In fact, it's a
likely report of what can, and often does, happen on a football lield
when one of the sport's most lethal plays - the cross-body block - is
used. The play, which gained popularity as an offensive maneuver, has
had increased use recently as a substitute for traditional tackling
procedures. But in either instance the method is the same: the blocker
throws himself horizontally at the opponent's knees in order to upset
him. The play is an exciting one to watch, usually coming in the open
field when the two players are running at top speed. It is also highly
dangerous to both.
The cross-body block can be likened to the thrust of a railroad tie
against the unprotected knee. Studies have shown that the play causes
more knee injuries in football than any other maneuver. And football
players' padding offers little protection to the blocker, who exposes
virtually his entire side, risking damage to the ribs, spleen, kidneys,
spine and lungs. Many coaches are alarmed at the dangers inherent in
this play, but it is nevertheless taught routinely in high school and is
such an effective blocking and tackling technique that football
rulemakers have been reluctant to enforce specific legislation against
it.
Hitting Harder
Not all plays in football are this dangerous, of course, but many
entail similar risk. Like most athletes, football players these days are
bigger and faster than ever before. And, according to one doctor,
"They're coached to hit harder, too." But despite the fact that
advances in equipment and safety techniques have been substantial,
there has been no significant reduction in the number or percentage of
injuries. Statistics on this subject are hard to come by - in fact,
comprehensive, national figures do not exist - but an opinion generally
shared by most trainers and dcotors associated with athletics is that
competitive sports on the scholastic level are no safer now than they
ever have been.
The reasons for this lag are varied. For one, while there are more
participants in violent and strenuous sports, especially on the high
school level, than there used to be, the quality of trained medical
personnel and medical research in the area of athletics haven't been
able to keep pace with this increase. More importantly, most high
schools lack consistently adequate medical care on a day-to-day basis
for athletes. According to Dr. Frederick L. Behling, an orthopedic
surgeon on the staff of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, this deficiency is
a serious problem on the scholastic level.
"Usually there's no trainer in a high school," Behling says, "a factor
which puts all the push on the coach during the week, and no matter
how conscientious a coach is, his first obligation is to win, along with
protecting his kids from harm.
Coaches' Quandry
Yet among coaches the problem is more one of ignorance than of
deliberate error. Dr. Behling asserts. "There are fewer coaches today
who would be willing to take a chance on hurting a kid than who just
don't know how serious an injury is. There are almost no coaches who
jeopardize players knowingly, but sometimes it's very difficult to
evaluate an injury, especially when the kid won't say how much he's
hurt. You have to know the guy." Indeed, doctors and trainers who
don't know how the individuals under their care react to pain, which
ones will plead to play with a fractured leg and which ones will beg
sympathy for a bad hangnail, are not likely to be particularly
effective. And Stanley Scott, assistant trainer this year at Stanford
adds that "It's amazing how many things go unrecognized on the high
school level until they're quite severe."
Most trainers are licensed physiotherapists who have completed one
or two years of study covering subject like anatomy, pathology, the
process of disease, the theraputic aspects of exercise, nutrition, and
the whole realm of injury and trauma. Furthermore, the experienced
trainer is more often than not the resident authority on such diverse
matters as equipment, the correct care of athletic surfaces, coaching
techniques and coaches' temperaments as well as
psychiatrist-in-residence for a host of adolescent athletes. Still, as
Scott stresses, as far as diagnosis goes, "Physical therapists aren't
qualified to do anything more than first aid."
