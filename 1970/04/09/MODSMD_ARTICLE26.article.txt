SAN FRANCISCO - Wrapped
in a brand new package, the
fourth official Pacific-8
Conference baseball season gets
I under way this Saturday.
The 1970 schedule has some
; new twists, including Northern
and Southern Divisions, and it
calls for a 17-game regular season
for each club plus a post-season
four-way playoff to decide the
Pac-8 representative in the NCAA
District VIII showdown.
Two Divisions
The Northern Division will
include Washington, Washington
State, Oregon and Oregon State,
while California, Stanford, USC
and UCLA will make up the
Southern Division. Each team, in
its 17-game regular season
schedule, will play nine games in
its own division. The overall
Conference champion will be
decided on the best won-loss
percentage for all 17 games. A
team must play a minimum of 11
Conference games to qualify for
the championship.
The post-season playoff,
tentatively scheduled for one of
the Northern Division sites, will
include the first and second place
teams for each division. It will be
a double elimination playoff, now
set for May 21-22 and 23, with
the playoff champion representing
the Conference in District VIII
playoffs that decide a berth in the
NCAA World Series.
Stanford a I Cal
The schedule opens Saturday
with single games between
traditional rivals with WSU
hosting Washington, OSU at
Oregon, USC entertaining UCLA
and Stanford at California.
Inter-division play back-to back
doubleheaders on Friday and
Saturday will be on Mav 1-2 and
May 8-9.
There's been a different
Conference baseball champion
each season since the Pacific-8
adopted a full league schedule at
the start of the 1967 season.

UCLA is the defending
Conference champion, winning
last season with a 17-4 second,
one full game ahead of runner-up
Stanford.
