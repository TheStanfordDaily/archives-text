# Volleyballers To Berkeley
## 
### 
Stanford's volleyball team,
working out in preparation for the
NCAA Western Regional
Championships, comes up against
some stiff competition this
weekend in the AAU Far Western
Championships at Berkeley's
Harmon Gym.
Coming off fine showings at a
recent tournament in Santa
Barbara where they finished just
points behind strong teams from
UCLA and San Diego State, the
Indians will sharpen up Saturday
against some of the finest
open division teams in the United
States.
Teams from the Olympic Club
of San Francisco, the Balboa Bay
Club of Southern California, and
all-star teams including U.S.
Olympic team participants from
the four branches of the armed
services will participate as well as
college teams from around the
state.
Stanford earned its invitation
to the NCAA Regionals by
beating USC, the other third-place
finisher at Santa Barbara,
trouncing the Trojans 15-6, and
15-11 in three straight games of a
best of five series.
Saturday's matches begin at 9
a.m. with the finals getting under
way at 7 in the evening. It will be
the only opportunity to see
Stanford's 1970 team in action as
they point toward a spot in the
nationals, and volleyball
enthusiasts are urged to turn out
for the event.
