# NUC Resolution
## 
### 
At a Wednesday night meeting, the New University Conference, a
radical faculty group adopted this statement
As the war in Vietnam escalates to Laos and Cambodia it becomes
increasingly clear that we can no longer tolerate the presence of
ROTC on the Stanford campus. ROTC can no longer be allowed to
train officers, on this campus or elsewhere, to increase the power of
the American military establishment to kill. As long as Stanford keeps
ROTC, no matter how nominally and restricted, it publicly declares
its support for a systematic policy of aggression and destruction which
victimizes much of the world.
President Pitzer, by his reversal of the decision to drop credit for
ROTC, has forced the faculty to a vote of confidence in the military.
We do not have such confidence in the military; their aims and goals
are antithetical to the functioning of an institution of higher learning.
The imposition of their presence on this campus has brought about
violent disruption and a breakdown of education.
Violence is at the heart of the military, and it io no surprise that
violence is to be used against them. The real issue is not the breaking
of a few windows, but the institutionalizing of violence in keeping
ROTC. Therefore, ROTC must be removed from campus immediately.
We urge all members of the community to use whatever power is at
their disposal to remove ROTC from this campus.
1) We will support and participate in the community anti-ROTC
meeting on Thursday, at 7 :30 in the Tresidder Large Lounge.
2) Since no building on campus should be closed to a faculty
member or student, we plan to go to the ROTC building to talk to our
"colleagues."
3) We plan to organize and teach mini-courses relevant to the
current struggle.
4) Finally, if you are a faculty member or graduate student who is
interested in working with NUC on this program, come to our meeting
on Monday, April 13, 2-4 p.m. in Tresidder, Room 267-68.
