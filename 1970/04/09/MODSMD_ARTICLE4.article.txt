# Under Emergency Authority
## Pitzer Issues New Rules 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
In a move designed to clarify
Tuesday's emergency regulation,
President Kenneth Pitzer
yesterday re-issued and extended
the regulation restricting entrance
to the Athletic Department
Building.
Pitzer also appealed again to
members of the community to
come to his office to identify
pictures of demonstrators.
After consultations with
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLS) members, Pitzer
promulgated a rule allowing him
or his designatee to declare any
other building on campus subject
to restrictions similar to those
already imposed on the Athletic
Building.
Those restrictions forbid any
person not having business in the
Athletic Department building,
which houses the ROTC
department, from entering. The
regulations are framed under the
interim legislation procedure of
the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
Provost Richard Lyman also
announced that enrollment in
ROTC classes was being closed.
"This extraordinary step is
made necessary by the destructive
events of the past week and by
the explicity threatened further
disruption of ROTC activities,"
Lyman said.
President Pitzer came under
intense criticism at yesterday's
noon rally because he had not
consulted any SCLC members
before issuing the first regulation,
as the Charter requires him.
Speakers at the rally, including
SCLC member Yale Braunstein
contended that the regulation was
invalid because of the lack of
consultation.
A statement released by Pitzer
last night, however, answered this
argument: "It was my judgement
on the evening of April 7
(Tuesday) that time and the
imminent nature of the threat of
disruption did not permit
meaningful consultations with
members of SCLC. Contact could
have been merely for the purposes
of notification, which seemed to
me not what the Charter intends."
SCLC Chairman Hubert
Marshall commented that Pitzer
probably made a mistake in

Following is the text ot Pitzer's
addition to his initial statement
closing the ROTC building:
Whenever the President or his
authorized designee finds that a
building or any part ol a building
on the campus cannot effectively
be used for its authorized
operations because of the
presence or threatened presence
of persons in said building or in
the immediate vicinity of such
building, he may declare said
building to be closed for a definite
period of time to all persons or to
all persons not having authorized
business therein.
Any student who enters a
building or specified area
surrounding such building in
violation of such an order closing
such building is guilty of an
offense punishable b) the
Stanford Judicial Council.
Iden lilicalion
Pitzer asked for help in
identifying pictures in order to

make the campus judicial
procedures work.
The purposeless violence visited
on the campus again on Monday
night has no rational connection
to any issue of policy before the
University. It is the work of a
group of people - some of them
students, some not - whose
program is destruction and whose
goal is a University in which those
who have the power to destroy
win the power to rule.
I refuse to believe that the
students, staff, and faculty of (his
University tvjll stand by
indifferently while a mob roams
the campus night after night
systematically smashing windows.
When that same mob enters a
University building, as it did on
Tuesday, for the purpose and with
the effect of disrupting the
activities, including classes, in that
building, it brings closer to home
the realization that violence
directed against the University is

directed equally at all ol its
functions and all of its people.
We learned last year that the
only effective answer to tactics of
this kind is for members of the
University community to step
forward to identify individuals
who have engaged in violation of
University regulations or civil law.
Photographs taken at various
times during the last week are
available for inspection at the
Office of the President. It is
essential that those in the
photographs be identified. In
addition, members of the
community who have witnesses
what they believe to be an illegal
act, such as rock throwing, should
make this information known to
the President's Office.
It is my firm intention to bring
action wherever possible before
the Stanford Judicial Council,
before the local courts, or both.
Those who believe, as I do, that
this University cannot tolerate the
malicious actions of the past week
can and must play a part in
bringing them to an end.
