# New Procedures For Room Draw
## 
### 
A manual outlining procedures
for this spring's Housing Draw has
been distributed to all residence
offices, R.A.'s, and sponsors and
is available today for all students
to read before the draw on May
4-8.
Each student who desires
University housing for next fall
must pick up a draw card at his
residence hall office on May 1 and
fill out his residence preferences.
During the draw, each student
then draws a number at the Old
Union. This number will
determine the student's priority
for the residences he has chosen as
his preferences.
As in last spring's draw,
everyone who wishes to have
University housing next fall must
enter the draw whether or not
they wish to be reassigned to their
present residence.
The Housing Office has
announced that there will be a
few changes in this year's draw,

however. The Housing Office is
promising that everyone who is
assigned on the first round of the
draw will receive either their
present residence or a preference
they listed higher than their
present residence.
This provision means that the
priority number each student
receives will be less important
than in previous years, when those
with low priorities received
residence assignments which they
listed lower than their present
residence.
The second round of the draw
will be held for students, if any,
who were unassigned after the
first round and for students who
want to improve their Round 1
assignment. Students who attempt
to improve their first assignment
in Round 2 are guaranteed that
they will receive the same
assignment or a preference they
listed above their present
assignment. Students are allowed
to change their first two
preferences if I hey enter the
second round.
As before, up to four people
who wish to draw together may
draw one number and list their
first few preferences in identical
order. For the first time, however,
the groups drawing together mav
be coed if they are drawing into
coed residences.
Another change in the draw
this year will be that wait lists will
not be generated automatically as
the draw proceeds. Instead, after
the second round, students may
place their names in order of draw
number on one or two wait lists at
the Housing Office until June 15.
After that date, names will be
placed on the list in the order in
which the students contact the
Housing Office.
May 1 is the deadline for
students in Manzanita Park and
Hoskins to indicate their desire
for housing next year. To remain
in Hoskins or Manzanita, they
must notify the Housing Office
who all of their roommates will be
on official forms.
The deadline for students'
petitions for special housing
consideration because of a
physical handicap is also May I.
