# Speech-Drama Dropped To 'Spartan' Budget
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Major cutbacks in next year's
Speech and Drama Department
budget will force a virtual
elimination of Speech Division
activities within two years and put
drama at Stanford on what one
instructor called a "starvation
budget."
Eventual cuts of up to $69,000
in faculty and technical salaries
will be made from the present
salary budget of $300,000. These
budget figures do not include
additional losses of grants which
pay for teaching fellows and
production deficits.
Speech Division Chairman
Helen Schrader confirmed that
speech faculty contracts will not
be renewed upon expiration and
"there will be no replacements for
people when their terms are
completed."
Two of the five speech
instructors will leave when their
contracts expire at the end of this
year and two more at the end of
next year. Only Dr. Schrader,
whose job is protected by tenure,
will remain.

Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Lawrence V. Ryan
said that, faced by the need for
budget cuts, "We decided this was
one [department) we would
phase down as much as we
possibly could."
But Dr. Schrader denied that
the division is being completely
eliminated. She commented, "I'm
still involved and believe in the
work we're doing here."
1000 Enrolled
Over 1000 undergraduates
enrolled in Speech division
courses this year. Forensics
Director Kenneth Mosier
responded to the phase-out plan,
"I find it hard to believe that
that's the will of the university.
Certainly in this age we shouldn't
try to deemphasize spoken
communication
Mosier believes the division was
"vulnerable" to elimination
because it has not offered a major
for several years.
He criticized former Associate
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Robert Sears for describing the
speech courses as a "service" in a
budget report to the Academic
Senate. Mosier said that the
speech program was no more of a
dispensable service than any other
course an undergraduate might
choose outside of his major.
He added, "The problem
probably is that we just don't
produce scientific grants."
Drama Confusion
In the Drama division, there is
confusion over departmental
priorities. The clearest decision
reached is the official death of
Stanford Repertory Theater
(SRT). SRT began in 1965 as a
professional company of ten
actors and two acting fellows. But
as private funding ended and
expenses rose, the number of
professionals decreased
This year SRT had no
professional artists, and it simply
became the name for the
department's biggest
nonprofessional productions. But
a four-man SRT administrative
staff had been retained until now.
These jobs in publicity, box
office, community relations, and
business will be eliminated next
year.
Speech and Drama Department
Chairman Michael Barry said
those positions will have to be
taken over by student volunteers,
who probably will not even be
given sufficient funds for
complete mail campaigns.

And there will also be big
budget problems for the plays
those volunteers will publicize.
The University had always
covered SRT's yearly deficit. But
beginning next year, as Professor
Barry said, "We're going to have
to pay our own way."
The University is expected to
furnish an initial production loan,
but the drama season will have to
break even. That means there will
only be several full-scale
productions next year, with most
plays performed "in black"—with
actors in leotards and on a dark
stage.
Spartan Conditions
Drama Professor Eleanor
Prosser said that would most hurt
"design and technical" students,
who will have little opportunity
to work on elaborate sets or
costumes under future "Spartan
conditions."
"We can't afford to fail in next
year's productions," Dr. Prosser
said. "We'll have to be extremely
cautious in the plays we pick."
The cuts will affect drama
course offerings. Directing courses
are among those to be eliminated.
Dr. Prosser said one full faculty
appointment in dramatic
literature would be lost.
Acting fellows will also be
eliminated. There are now two
fellows, students who have
completed graduate drama
studies, then are paid to assist in
department work for a year.
M FA To Con tinue
A major uncertainty of the
drama cutbacks is its effect on
undergraduate drama students.
Prof. Prosser said that MFA
programs were protected before
undergraduate courses. She said
the MFA program had to come
first because it is already
minimally staffed and "Stanford
is committed to a complete
professional program" required
for MFA's.
The acting course for freshmen
and sophomores is a controversial
undergraduate casualty. The
department's first such course was
initiated this year by teaching
fellow Rich Rekow, whose job
was scrapped in the cutback
He said he was "hoping the
cutbacks would make the people
in the department rethink the
whole program" to stress
undergraduate drama. He called
the undergraduates "the most
exciting people in the
department" and said that
independent student projects such
as Ram's Head and the Company
indicate their potential.
