# Committee Listens
## Housing, Open Space Asked 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
Plea after plea for construction
of low-cost housing, preservation
of the beauty of Stanford land,
and the maintenance of open
space came from a long list of
speakers at a open hearing last
night on future uses of University
land.
More than twenty speakers
representing various University
groups and civic organizations
from neighboring cities addressed
the Committee on Land and
Building Development at an open
hearing attended by about 150
persons.
The purpose of the hearing
according to Robert N. Grant, the
chairman of the Committee, was
to provide an open forum for new
ideas for the use of the nearly
2900 acres of Stanford land
available for future development.
Ecology Action, the United
Stanford Employees, Grass Roots,
the American Federation of
Teachers, and several other groups
suggested that Stanford construct
as many as 6000 units of low and
moderate-income housing.
University 's First Obligation
Roland Finston, an employee
representing the United Stanford
Employees, maintained bitterly
that "the University's first
obligation now is to its
employees. It would be criminally
irresponsible if it continued to
expand itself" before providing
adequate housing for its staff.
Paul Rupert, speaking for Grass
Roots, challenged the legality of
the Land Committee itself,
charging that low-income groups,
women, and Stanford employees
were not adequately represented.
"These decision-making structures
are going to be inadequate to
solve problems in the future," said
Rupert.
War Industry
Rupert also called for the
establishment of "workable social
criteria concerning the kind of
industry that can move onto
Stanford land in the future,"
alluding to the war-related
industries currently operative in
the Indus)rial Park

Several groups, notably the
Committee for Green Foothills,
advocated the formulation of a
"master plan" for Stanford land
use before any further
development is undertaken.
Gordan Finwall, a citizen of
Palo Alto, urged the committee to
consider why people had come to
Palo Alto in the first place. He
pointed to Ihe many benefits that
have accrued to Palo Alto from
the Stanford Industrial Park, and
recommended that the University
"duplicate the Industrial Park
effort," and to avoid being misled
by the "slogans of the moment."
Cluster Colleges
J.B. Truher, a Stanford
alumnus and staff member.

proposed that a system of "cluster
colleges" be built just west of the
present campus.
Truher's plan, which he
compared to the scheme of the
University of California at Santa
Cruz or the Claremont Colleges,
would provide more or less
specialized communities for
undergraduates interested in a
certain field. Truher maintained
that the plan is financially
feasible, and challenged the
committee to look into the idea
more closely.
The Land Use Committee plans
more hearings in the future, and
will take the presentations into
consideration before reporting to
President Pitzer.

by the "slogans of the moment."
Cluster Colleges
J.B. Truher, a Stanford
alumnus and staff member.

proposed that a system of "cluster
colleges" be built just west of the
present campus.
Truher's plan, which he
compared to the scheme of the
University of California at Santa
Cruz or the Claremont Colleges,
would provide more or less
specialized communities for
undergraduates interested in a
certain field. Truher maintained
that the plan is financially
feasible, and challenged the
committee to look into the idea
more closely.
The Land Use Committee plans
more hearings in the future, and
will take the presentations into
consideration before reporting to
President Pitzer.

University to conserve open space, construct low cost housing, and preserw i *
area's natural beaulv.
Plea after plea for construction
of low-cost housing, preservation
of the beauty of Stanford land,
and the maintenance of open
space came from a long list of
speakers at a open hearing last
night on future uses of University
land.
More than twenty speakers
representing various University
groups and civic organizations
from neighboring cities addressed
the Committee on Land and
Building Development at an open
hearing attended by about 150
persons.
The purpose of the hearing
according to Robert N. Grant, the
chairman of the Committee, was
to provide an open forum for new
ideas for the use of the nearly
2900 acres of Stanford land
available for future development.
Ecology Action, the United
Stanford Employees, Grass Roots,
the American Federation of
Teachers, and several other groups
suggested that Stanford construct
as many as 6000 units of low and
moderate-income housing.
University 's First Obligation
Roland Finston, an employee
representing the United Stanford
Employees, maintained bitterly
that "the University's first
obligation now is to its
employees. It would be criminally
irresponsible if it continued to
expand itself" before providing
adequate housing for its staff.
Paul Rupert, speaking for Grass
Roots, challenged the legality of
the Land Committee itself,
charging that low-income groups,
women, and Stanford employees
were not adequately represented.
"These decision-making structures
are going to be inadequate to
solve problems in the future," said
Rupert.
War Industry
Rupert also called for the
establishment of "workable social
criteria concerning the kind of
industry that can move onto
Stanford land in the future,"
alluding to the war-related
industries currently operative in
the Indus)rial Park

Several groups, notably the
Committee for Green Foothills,
advocated the formulation of a
"master plan" for Stanford land
use before any further
development is undertaken.
Gordan Finwall, a citizen of
Palo Alto, urged the committee to
consider why people had come to
Palo Alto in the first place. He
pointed to Ihe many benefits that
have accrued to Palo Alto from
the Stanford Industrial Park, and
recommended that the University
"duplicate the Industrial Park
effort," and to avoid being misled
by the "slogans of the moment."
