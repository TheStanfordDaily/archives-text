# Conflicting Outlooks
## Why Rock Throwing 
### W.C.M. F 
Editor, The Daily :
Last night (April 6) rocks were
thrown again on this campus.
That these rocks were thrown
indicates the seriousness of the
movement to get ROTG off
campus. But the off-ROTC
movement is not committed to
throwing rocks. The only thing we
are committed to is the
discontinuation of ROTC. As long
as we are small in number, more
feasible, more generally-accept
able tactics to achieve this are not
available. We need the support of
everyone on the Stanford campus
who is against ROTC. With this
support we can begin to
implement those alternatives:
large-scale attendance of ROTC
classes, mobile sit-ins, a student
strike, wall-papering the ROTC
building with scenic posters. We
can implement others as well.
Thursday night showed not
only that there are large numbers
of students that oppose the
presence of ROTC, 'but that we
can come together and act
together. Last night showed that
il there is to be no more
rock-throwing, we must come

together again, until ROTC is off
this campus.
The point is that we should not
allow differences over tactics to
divide us. Our goal is the same. We
want your support; there are
tactics on which we can all agree.
Join us: the movement will go on,
but how depends on you.
So they came to Jerusalem.
And there Jesus went into the
temple, and began driving our
those who sold and bought in the
temple, and overthrew the tables
of the bankers, and the chairs of
the pigeon sellers; nor would lie
allow anyone to carry his wares
through the temple. And this was
the admonition he gave them, "Is
11 not written, 'My house shall be
known among all the nations for a
house of prayer?' Whereas you
have made it into a den of
thieves." The chief priests and
scribes heard of this, and looked
for some means of making away
with him; Iliey were afraid of him,
because all the multitude was so
full of admiration of his teaching.

Editor, The Daily:
The W.C.M.E. Affinity Group
distributed a statement this
morning in which they condoned
the anti-ROTC rock-throwing
activities of the past few days.
Their statement said: "As long as
we are small in number, more
feasible, more generally
acceptable tactics to achieve this
discontinuation of ROTC are not
available." (
I would suggest to the authors
of this position paper that perhaps
the reason they do not have the
support of a large portion of the
Stanford community is that the
majority does not favor banning
ROTC from campus. The student
referendum of last year and the
recent faculty vote amply
demonstrate this.
Thursday night did not show
that there are large numbers of
students who oppose ROTC as the
WCMF paper would have us
believe; rather it showed that the
movement has a talent for
attracting high school and other
outside agitators
