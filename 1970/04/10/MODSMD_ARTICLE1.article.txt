# SCLC Asks Weapons Ban
## 
### LAURIE HORN 
The Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) has
voted to ban the "knowing
possession or use" of deadly
weapons on campus.
The committee also proposed a
detailed "Penalty Code" defining
Judicial Council punishments, and
in further action it abolished
remaining social regulations which
have been unenforced in recent
years.
The new SCLC ruling on
deadly weapons states that
"knowing possession or use" of a
deadly weapon would be
prohibited and might keep ROTC
students from carrying guns on
campus. The ruling also prohibits
students from using instruments
of destruction "except in defense
of his own person."
The social regulations
abolished include parietal rules
(concerning open hours in dorms),
the women's dress code, and a
regulation banning drinking
out-of-doors.
In order for the SCLC
proposals to become University
law, they must go through a
double "gestation" period—a time
when objections to the new ruling
can be aired, and possible
revisions proposed.
The first stage of this review
period begins today with rule
publication (see page seven for
text).
After the two, three-week
periods of consideration, the
earliest possible date for the full
passage of new proposals would
be the last Tuesday in May. Since
the proposed penalty code would
provide long-awaited definitions
of what University penalties
mean, it is possible that the
content of the proposal will be
adopted in practice before hat
date.
The Judicial Council has in the
past assigned penalties—ranging
from expulsion to
censure—without precisely
interpreting what sanctions go
along with each penalty and thus
causing confusion in interpreting
intermediate penalties like
suspension or probation.
Hubert Marshall, professor of

political science and member of
SCLC, said that the new code
proposes to solve such problems
by defining each penalty,
although it will make no attempt
to assign specific penalties to
specific offenses.
Marshall pointed out that there
would be nothing to prevent the
Judicial Council from unofficially
adopting the new definitions
before official passage in late May.
If disciplinary action is taken
in the wake of present ROTC
demonstrations, the Council could
choose to interpret its penalties in
light of the new code.
The deadly weapons proposal,
contested strenuously in
committee, was passed after an
amendment from Yale Braunstein
eliminated a cluase saying deadly
weapons would be prohibited
"except for authorized academic
purposes."

by defining each penalty,
although it will make no attempt
to assign specific penalties to
specific offenses.
Marshall pointed out that there
would be nothing to prevent the
Judicial Council from unofficially
adopting the new definitions
before official passage in late May.
If disciplinary action is taken
in the wake of present ROTC
demonstrations, the Council could
choose to interpret its penalties in
light of the new code.
The deadly weapons proposal,
contested strenuously in
committee, was passed after an
amendment from Yale Braunstein
eliminated a cluase saying deadly
weapons would be prohibited
"except for authorized academic
purposes."

AIRING THE ISSUK - al Wednesday's mill-in.
The Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) has
voted to ban the "knowing
possession or use" of deadly
weapons on campus.
The committee also proposed a
detailed "Penalty Code" defining
Judicial Council punishments, and
in further action it abolished
remaining social regulations which
have been unenforced in recent
years.
The new SCLC ruling on
deadly weapons states that
"knowing possession or use" of a
deadly weapon would be
prohibited and might keep ROTC
students from carrying guns on
campus. The ruling also prohibits
students from using instruments
of destruction "except in defense
of his own person."
The social regulations
abolished include parietal rules
(concerning open hours in dorms),
the women's dress code, and a
regulation banning drinking
out-of-doors.
In order for the SCLC
proposals to become University
law, they must go through a
double "gestation" period—a time
when objections to the new ruling
can be aired, and possible
revisions proposed.
The first stage of this review
period begins today with rule
publication (see page seven for
text).
After the two, three-week
periods of consideration, the
earliest possible date for the full
passage of new proposals would
be the last Tuesday in May. Since
the proposed penalty code would
provide long-awaited definitions
of what University penalties
mean, it is possible that the
content of the proposal will be
adopted in practice before hat
date.
The Judicial Council has in the
past assigned penalties—ranging
from expulsion to
censure—without precisely
interpreting what sanctions go
along with each penalty and thus
causing confusion in interpreting
intermediate penalties like
suspension or probation.
Hubert Marshall, professor of

political science and member of
SCLC, said that the new code
proposes to solve such problems
by defining each penalty,
although it will make no attempt
to assign specific penalties to
specific offenses.
Marshall pointed out that there
would be nothing to prevent the
Judicial Council from unofficially
adopting the new definitions
before official passage in late May.
