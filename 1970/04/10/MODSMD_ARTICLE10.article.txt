Sweeney Must Go
Editor, The Daily:
As a formed editor-in-chief of
the Chaparral and President of the
Hammer and Coffin Society
(1959-1960), I would like to lend
my support to Barney Gould's
request that Michael Sweeney
resign as President of the Hammer
and Coffin Society. According to
the Constitution and By-Laws of
the Society, this implies his
resignation as editor of the
Chaparral as well. Certainly Mr.
Sweeney's self-serving efforts have
caused the reputations and
traditions of these organizations
to suffer more than enough
already. In addition to this, it
would appear that Mr. Sweeney is
not legally eligible to serve in
either position.
As for Mr. Sweeney's reply to
Mr. Gould, I would like to say
that Mr. Gould is a gentleman,
and hardly the sort of person to
indulge in "authoritarian
fantasies." In these respects he
would seem to be the antithesis of
Mr. Sweeney.

Editor, The Daily :
For the sake of an accurate
record, let me correct some errors
of fact in Robert Spencer's Article
of 8 April entitled 'An Ancient
Vending Machine'. The resolution
presented to the Senate on April 2
asked that Stanford's Board of
Trustees consider voting its
proxies in favor of the two
Nader-backed propositions that
will appear on the General Motors
proxy ballot.

Since I spoke in favor of the
propositions themselves, I
personally did want "to marshal
support" for them. But the
wording of the resolution made
only the modest request for the
Board's consideration. Secondly,
the resolution was not "mine"
except in the sense that I gathered
the signatures necessary to get it
before the Senate. It was rather a
resolution placed on the action
calendar by eleven members of
the Senate. Finally, I am sure
Professor George Bach is keenly
aware of what is happening in the
world.

Proper Senate Stance
Editor, The Daily:
Your columnist, Robert
Spencer, reports me in the April 8
DAILY at some length on the
topic of the attitude of the
Academic Senate in relation to
the request that it take a position
on voting the University's GM
stock in connection with the
so-called Nader proposal.
Since Mr. Spencer's "report"
bears only the vaguest
resemblance to what I actually
said, I hope you will grant me a
few lines to indicate the position I
actually presented. Incidentally,
so far as I know Mr. Spencer was
not there, and one may wonder
where he got his information.
The central point I argued, as
did a number of other Senators, is
that the Academic Senate is an
academic institution and should
not begin taking positions on
behalf of the Stanford faculty on
non-academic issues, be they

political, social, economic, or of
any other non-academic variety. I
emphasized that this was not
because I personally do not feel
strongly about the pollution issue;
I do. But I believe, as apparently
do a number of other Senators,
that if the Senate begins taking
positions on such non-academic
issues, the number of such issues
is virtually unlimited and they will
become a deeply devisive force in
the Senate, undercutting its
ability to do effectively its central
job on academic issues. Pollution
is indeed "our problem". It is our
problem individually, however,
and not as a University Senate.
So far as I know, Spencer's
paragraph about the "sanguinary
carnage wreaked in healthy proxy
fights" has nothing to do with
anything I said.
Issues like the "polluiton
problem" are complex and
difficult ones in a society like
ours. I personally believe that the
political process (laws passed and
morally supported by the bulk of
the people) represents the most
effective, and probably the only
effective, way of dealing with
most of these big issues. They
simply range beyond local control
or actions of individual
businessmen or citizens. My
personal hope would be that some
of the energies being devoted to
this problem could be focussed
where I think they will do the
most good - on getting more
effective legislation governing the
problems involved.

Speech-Drama Cuts
Editor, The Daily:
Although I am not a regular
member of the debate squad here
at Stanford, I have participated in
certain speech activities here and
am well acquainted with several
Stanford debaters. My concern
and disgust, therefore, for the
virtual phasing out of the debate
program along with the entire
Speech Department is sincerely
felt.
I am appalled that a university
of Stanford's stature would even
think of dropping the University's
chief source of academic
competition. Stanford, under the
directorship of Dr. Mosier, has
gained recognition as one of the
top three squads in the country.
In addition, its program is of such
high caliber that high school
organizations (most of which will
have better programs than
Stanford's after the cuts), have
sought Stanford as the site for
many important state and
national tournaments. And this
the squad has been able to do
only after scraping the bottom of
the Senate's financial barrel for
funds, which seems to yield more
readily to causes of more dubious
value to the University as a whole.
There are numerous other

reasons for retaining the program,
such as maintaining the academic
prestige of the University and
keeping our educational priorities
in order. I certainly hope the
University reconsiders this action,
which displays naught but the
basest understanding of the value
of forensics and the liberal arts,
and which I thought could only
occur in a second rate institution,
or worse yet, in a high school

Off the Clothes
Editor, The Daily :
I should like to address myself
to the young man who wore the
woolen ski face mask for his TV
debut at the ROTC builidng the
other day. It must have been
dreadfully warm and
uncomfortable. May I suggest
something in permanent press
percale, perhaps with long flowing
sleeves and a hood rising to an
attractive point on top.
Betty M. Frischmann
Open Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
A few things concerning the
column in Wednesday's Daily,
"From the Inside - One Cadet's
Criticism."
Shouldn't Daily policy
concerning letters and columns be
a bit more consistent? If letters
must be signed to be printed, why
not columns? You say the author
"refused to give his name." I can
understand why: No one would
believe that Michael Sweeney,
Leonard Siegel,' or whatever
Movement member wrote that
column is enrolled in the ROTC
program.
I challenge anyone to convince
me that that article was written
by an ROTC cadet.

Braunstein A musing
Editor, The Daily:
I read with amusement Mr.
Braunstein's indignant and
ungrammatical statement "I plan
to spend as much of my time in
the ROTC building to show tnv

defiance and contempt for this
illegal regulation." His moral
outrage may be commendable; it
is unfortunate that it is so
narrow-minded. No mention was
made of the wanton destruction
by protestors that has occurred
within the past week. One might
ask how Mr. Braunstein would
complete his sentence. Perhaps he
intended to say "1 plan to spend
as much of my time in the ROTC
building to show my defiance and
contempt for this regulation and
to illustrate my disrespect for the
democratic workings of the
Academic Senate as I plan to
spend time breaking windows."
Peter Carey
Senior, Psychology and Economics
Broken Windows
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to invite everyone
to come over to the Aero and
Astro Building to see the
destruction caused by the
"Off-ROTC" rock-hurling brigade.
Each broken window will cost
$100 or so to replace. The damage
so far runs close to $10,000. Who
pays for this? You do. The money
comes out of the University
General Fund, which is fed by
your tuition. Can you afford to
pay for such waste?
There is, however, a greater
price to pay than $10,000. The
price is erosion of our freedoms.
Anarchy does not coexist with
freedom. Each act of political
violence stirs a counter-current of
repression. The Wallaces, Agnews
and the Reagans feast on campus
riots. A few more Isla Vistas and
Jess Unruh can kiss-off his diet
because Ronnie Reagan will be
riding herd on four more years of
Death Valley Days in Sacramento.
Not to mention Spiro T. who will
make us all wish he would join the
silent majority.
America is not a fascist
country now (in fact, if it were
one, nobody would have the
freedom to call it fascist).
However the right-wing reaction
to campus turmoil can unleash a
whirlwind which will overpower
Stanford's motto (taanslated),
"The winds of freedom blow." In
an odd way, reminiscent of 1984
doublethink, our local
revolution-addicts could create
the very conditions they say they
oppose: fascism, repression and
tyranny.
Yesterday while viewing the
broken windows, I heard a liberal
professor mutter, "These idiots
will make a conservative of me
yet!" I assure you he has much
farther to go than the average
member of our silent (but
awakening) majority.
So the next time you find
yourself with an overpowering
urge to hurl a rock through a
window, please remember it is not
just a stone you cast but 100
votes for Ronald Reagan.

on voting the University's GM
stock in connection with the
so-called Nader proposal.
Since Mr. Spencer's "report"
bears only the vaguest
resemblance to what I actually
said, I hope you will grant me a
few lines to indicate the position I
actually presented. Incidentally,
so far as I know Mr. Spencer was
not there, and one may wonder
where he got his information.
The central point I argued, as
did a number of other Senators, is
that the Academic Senate is an
academic institution and should
not begin taking positions on
behalf of the Stanford faculty on
non-academic issues, be they

political, social, economic, or of
any other non-academic variety. I
emphasized that this was not
because I personally do not feel
strongly about the pollution issue;
I do. But I believe, as apparently
do a number of other Senators,
that if the Senate begins taking
positions on such non-academic
issues, the number of such issues
is virtually unlimited and they will
become a deeply devisive force in
the Senate, undercutting its
ability to do effectively its central
job on academic issues. Pollution
is indeed "our problem". It is our
problem individually, however,
and not as a University Senate.
So far as I know, Spencer's
paragraph about the "sanguinary
carnage wreaked in healthy proxy
fights" has nothing to do with
anything I said.
Issues like the "polluiton
problem" are complex and
difficult ones in a society like
ours. I personally believe that the
political process (laws passed and
morally supported by the bulk of
the people) represents the most
effective, and probably the only
effective, way of dealing with
most of these big issues. They
simply range beyond local control
or actions of individual
businessmen or citizens. My
personal hope would be that some
of the energies being devoted to
this problem could be focussed
where I think they will do the
most good - on getting more
effective legislation governing the
problems involved.

Speech-Drama Cuts
Editor, The Daily:
Although I am not a regular
member of the debate squad here
at Stanford, I have participated in
certain speech activities here and
am well acquainted with several
Stanford debaters. My concern
and disgust, therefore, for the
virtual phasing out of the debate
program along with the entire
Speech Department is sincerely
felt.
I am appalled that a university
of Stanford's stature would even
think of dropping the University's
chief source of academic
competition. Stanford, under the
directorship of Dr. Mosier, has
gained recognition as one of the
top three squads in the country.
In addition, its program is of such
high caliber that high school
organizations (most of which will
have better programs than
Stanford's after the cuts), have
sought Stanford as the site for
many important state and
national tournaments. And this
the squad has been able to do
only after scraping the bottom of
the Senate's financial barrel for
funds, which seems to yield more
readily to causes of more dubious
value to the University as a whole.
There are numerous other

reasons for retaining the program,
such as maintaining the academic
prestige of the University and
keeping our educational priorities
in order. I certainly hope the
University reconsiders this action,
which displays naught but the
basest understanding of the value
of forensics and the liberal arts,
and which I thought could only
occur in a second rate institution,
or worse yet, in a high school

A few things concerning the

Shouldn't Daily policy
concerning letters and columns be
a bit more consistent? If letters
must be signed to be printed, why
not columns? You say the author
"refused to give his name." I can
understand why: No one would
believe that Michael Sweeney,
Leonard Siegel,' or whatever

I challenge anyone to convince

Braunstein A musing
Editor, The Daily:
I read with amusement Mr.
Braunstein's indignant and
ungrammatical statement "I plan
to spend as much of my time in
the ROTC building to show tnv

defiance and contempt for this
illegal regulation." His moral
outrage may be commendable; it
is unfortunate that it is so
narrow-minded. No mention was
made of the wanton destruction
by protestors that has occurred
within the past week. One might
ask how Mr. Braunstein would
complete his sentence. Perhaps he
intended to say "1 plan to spend
as much of my time in the ROTC
building to show my defiance and
contempt for this regulation and
to illustrate my disrespect for the
democratic workings of the
Academic Senate as I plan to
spend time breaking windows."

Senior, Psychology and Economics
Broken Windows
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to invite everyone
to come over to the Aero and
Astro Building to see the
destruction caused by the
"Off-ROTC" rock-hurling brigade.
Each broken window will cost
$100 or so to replace. The damage
so far runs close to $10,000. Who
pays for this? You do. The money
comes out of the University
General Fund, which is fed by
your tuition. Can you afford to
pay for such waste?
There is, however, a greater
price to pay than $10,000. The
price is erosion of our freedoms.
Anarchy does not coexist with
freedom. Each act of political
violence stirs a counter-current of
repression. The Wallaces, Agnews
and the Reagans feast on campus
riots. A few more Isla Vistas and
Jess Unruh can kiss-off his diet
because Ronnie Reagan will be
riding herd on four more years of
Death Valley Days in Sacramento.
Not to mention Spiro T. who will
make us all wish he would join the
silent majority.
America is not a fascist
country now (in fact, if it were
one, nobody would have the
freedom to call it fascist).
However the right-wing reaction
to campus turmoil can unleash a
whirlwind which will overpower
Stanford's motto (taanslated),
"The winds of freedom blow." In
an odd way, reminiscent of 1984
doublethink, our local
revolution-addicts could create
the very conditions they say they
oppose: fascism, repression and
tyranny.
Yesterday while viewing the
broken windows, I heard a liberal
professor mutter, "These idiots
will make a conservative of me
yet!" I assure you he has much
farther to go than the average
member of our silent (but
awakening) majority.
So the next time you find
yourself with an overpowering
urge to hurl a rock through a
window, please remember it is not
just a stone you cast but 100
votes for Ronald Reagan.

Sweeney Must Go
Editor, The Daily:
As a formed editor-in-chief of
the Chaparral and President of the
Hammer and Coffin Society
(1959-1960), I would like to lend
my support to Barney Gould's
request that Michael Sweeney
resign as President of the Hammer
and Coffin Society. According to
the Constitution and By-Laws of
the Society, this implies his
resignation as editor of the
Chaparral as well. Certainly Mr.
Sweeney's self-serving efforts have
caused the reputations and
traditions of these organizations
to suffer more than enough
already. In addition to this, it
would appear that Mr. Sweeney is
not legally eligible to serve in
either position.
As for Mr. Sweeney's reply to
Mr. Gould, I would like to say
that Mr. Gould is a gentleman,
and hardly the sort of person to
indulge in "authoritarian
fantasies." In these respects he
would seem to be the antithesis of
Mr. Sweeney.

For the sake of an accurate

presented to the Senate on April 2
asked that Stanford's Board of

Since I spoke in favor of the

only the modest request for the
Board's consideration. Secondly,
the resolution was not "mine"
except in the sense that I gathered

and disgust, therefore, for the
virtual phasing out of the debate
program along with the entire
Speech Department is sincerely
felt.
I am appalled that a university
of Stanford's stature would even
think of dropping the University's
chief source of academic
competition. Stanford, under the
directorship of Dr. Mosier, has
gained recognition as one of the
top three squads in the country.
In addition, its program is of such
high caliber that high school
organizations (most of which will
have better programs than
Stanford's after the cuts), have
sought Stanford as the site for
many important state and
national tournaments. And this
the squad has been able to do
only after scraping the bottom of
the Senate's financial barrel for
funds, which seems to yield more
readily to causes of more dubious
value to the University as a whole.
There are numerous other

reasons for retaining the program,
such as maintaining the academic
prestige of the University and
keeping our educational priorities
in order. I certainly hope the
University reconsiders this action,
which displays naught but the
basest understanding of the value
of forensics and the liberal arts,
and which I thought could only
occur in a second rate institution,
or worse yet, in a high school

Shouldn't Daily policy

not columns? You say the author

Braunstein A musing
Editor, The Daily:
I read with amusement Mr.
Braunstein's indignant and
ungrammatical statement "I plan
to spend as much of my time in
the ROTC building to show tnv

defiance and contempt for this
illegal regulation." His moral
outrage may be commendable; it
is unfortunate that it is so
narrow-minded. No mention was
made of the wanton destruction
by protestors that has occurred
within the past week. One might
ask how Mr. Braunstein would
complete his sentence. Perhaps he
intended to say "1 plan to spend
as much of my time in the ROTC
building to show my defiance and
contempt for this regulation and
to illustrate my disrespect for the
democratic workings of the
Academic Senate as I plan to
spend time breaking windows."

Senior, Psychology and Economics
Broken Windows
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to invite everyone
to come over to the Aero and
Astro Building to see the
destruction caused by the
"Off-ROTC" rock-hurling brigade.
Each broken window will cost
$100 or so to replace. The damage
so far runs close to $10,000. Who
pays for this? You do. The money
comes out of the University
General Fund, which is fed by
your tuition. Can you afford to
pay for such waste?
There is, however, a greater
price to pay than $10,000. The
price is erosion of our freedoms.
Anarchy does not coexist with
freedom. Each act of political
violence stirs a counter-current of
repression. The Wallaces, Agnews
and the Reagans feast on campus
riots. A few more Isla Vistas and
Jess Unruh can kiss-off his diet
because Ronnie Reagan will be
riding herd on four more years of
Death Valley Days in Sacramento.
Not to mention Spiro T. who will
make us all wish he would join the
silent majority.
America is not a fascist
country now (in fact, if it were
one, nobody would have the
freedom to call it fascist).
However the right-wing reaction
to campus turmoil can unleash a
whirlwind which will overpower
Stanford's motto (taanslated),
"The winds of freedom blow." In
an odd way, reminiscent of 1984
doublethink, our local
revolution-addicts could create
the very conditions they say they
oppose: fascism, repression and
tyranny.
Yesterday while viewing the
broken windows, I heard a liberal
professor mutter, "These idiots
will make a conservative of me
yet!" I assure you he has much
farther to go than the average
member of our silent (but
awakening) majority.
So the next time you find
yourself with an overpowering
urge to hurl a rock through a
window, please remember it is not
just a stone you cast but 100
votes for Ronald Reagan.

Sweeney Must Go
Editor, The Daily:
As a formed editor-in-chief of
the Chaparral and President of the
Hammer and Coffin Society
(1959-1960), I would like to lend
my support to Barney Gould's
request that Michael Sweeney
resign as President of the Hammer
and Coffin Society. According to
the Constitution and By-Laws of
the Society, this implies his
resignation as editor of the
Chaparral as well. Certainly Mr.
Sweeney's self-serving efforts have
caused the reputations and
traditions of these organizations
to suffer more than enough
already. In addition to this, it
would appear that Mr. Sweeney is
not legally eligible to serve in
either position.
As for Mr. Sweeney's reply to
Mr. Gould, I would like to say
that Mr. Gould is a gentleman,
and hardly the sort of person to
indulge in "authoritarian
fantasies." In these respects he
would seem to be the antithesis of
Mr. Sweeney.

Editor, The Daily :
For the sake of an accurate
record, let me correct some errors
of fact in Robert Spencer's Article
of 8 April entitled 'An Ancient
Vending Machine'. The resolution
presented to the Senate on April 2
asked that Stanford's Board of
Trustees consider voting its
proxies in favor of the two
Nader-backed propositions that
will appear on the General Motors
proxy ballot.

Since I spoke in favor of the
propositions themselves, I
personally did want "to marshal
support" for them. But the
wording of the resolution made
only the modest request for the
Board's consideration. Secondly,
the resolution was not "mine"
except in the sense that I gathered
the signatures necessary to get it
before the Senate. It was rather a
resolution placed on the action
calendar by eleven members of
the Senate. Finally, I am sure
Professor George Bach is keenly
aware of what is happening in the
world.
Ronald A. Rebholz
Department of English
Proper Senate Stance
Editor, The Daily:
Your columnist, Robert
Spencer, reports me in the April 8
DAILY at some length on the
topic of the attitude of the
Academic Senate in relation to
the request that it take a position
on voting the University's GM
stock in connection with the
so-called Nader proposal.
Since Mr. Spencer's "report"
bears only the vaguest
resemblance to what I actually
said, I hope you will grant me a
few lines to indicate the position I
actually presented. Incidentally,
so far as I know Mr. Spencer was
not there, and one may wonder
where he got his information.
The central point I argued, as
did a number of other Senators, is
that the Academic Senate is an
academic institution and should
not begin taking positions on
behalf of the Stanford faculty on
non-academic issues, be they

political, social, economic, or of
any other non-academic variety. I
emphasized that this was not
because I personally do not feel
strongly about the pollution issue;
I do. But I believe, as apparently
do a number of other Senators,
that if the Senate begins taking
positions on such non-academic
issues, the number of such issues
is virtually unlimited and they will
become a deeply devisive force in
the Senate, undercutting its
ability to do effectively its central
job on academic issues. Pollution
is indeed "our problem". It is our
problem individually, however,
and not as a University Senate.
So far as I know, Spencer's
paragraph about the "sanguinary
carnage wreaked in healthy proxy
fights" has nothing to do with
anything I said.
Issues like the "polluiton
problem" are complex and
difficult ones in a society like
ours. I personally believe that the
political process (laws passed and
morally supported by the bulk of
the people) represents the most
effective, and probably the only
effective, way of dealing with
most of these big issues. They
simply range beyond local control
or actions of individual
businessmen or citizens. My
personal hope would be that some
of the energies being devoted to
this problem could be focussed
where I think they will do the
most good - on getting more
effective legislation governing the
problems involved.

Braunstein A musing
Editor, The Daily:
I read with amusement Mr.
Braunstein's indignant and
ungrammatical statement "I plan
to spend as much of my time in
the ROTC building to show tnv

defiance and contempt for this
illegal regulation." His moral
outrage may be commendable; it
is unfortunate that it is so
narrow-minded. No mention was
made of the wanton destruction
by protestors that has occurred
within the past week. One might
ask how Mr. Braunstein would
complete his sentence. Perhaps he
intended to say "1 plan to spend
as much of my time in the ROTC
building to show my defiance and
contempt for this regulation and
to illustrate my disrespect for the
democratic workings of the
Academic Senate as I plan to
spend time breaking windows."

Senior, Psychology and Economics
Broken Windows
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to invite everyone
to come over to the Aero and
Astro Building to see the
destruction caused by the
"Off-ROTC" rock-hurling brigade.
Each broken window will cost
$100 or so to replace. The damage
so far runs close to $10,000. Who
pays for this? You do. The money
comes out of the University
General Fund, which is fed by
your tuition. Can you afford to
pay for such waste?
There is, however, a greater
price to pay than $10,000. The
price is erosion of our freedoms.
Anarchy does not coexist with
freedom. Each act of political
violence stirs a counter-current of
repression. The Wallaces, Agnews
and the Reagans feast on campus
riots. A few more Isla Vistas and
Jess Unruh can kiss-off his diet
because Ronnie Reagan will be
riding herd on four more years of
Death Valley Days in Sacramento.
Not to mention Spiro T. who will
make us all wish he would join the
silent majority.
America is not a fascist
country now (in fact, if it were
one, nobody would have the
freedom to call it fascist).
However the right-wing reaction
to campus turmoil can unleash a
whirlwind which will overpower
Stanford's motto (taanslated),
"The winds of freedom blow." In
an odd way, reminiscent of 1984
doublethink, our local
revolution-addicts could create
the very conditions they say they
oppose: fascism, repression and
tyranny.
Yesterday while viewing the
broken windows, I heard a liberal
professor mutter, "These idiots
will make a conservative of me
yet!" I assure you he has much
farther to go than the average
member of our silent (but
awakening) majority.
So the next time you find
yourself with an overpowering
urge to hurl a rock through a
window, please remember it is not
just a stone you cast but 100
votes for Ronald Reagan.

Sweeney Must Go
Editor, The Daily:
As a formed editor-in-chief of
the Chaparral and President of the
Hammer and Coffin Society
(1959-1960), I would like to lend
my support to Barney Gould's
request that Michael Sweeney
resign as President of the Hammer
and Coffin Society. According to
the Constitution and By-Laws of
the Society, this implies his
resignation as editor of the
Chaparral as well. Certainly Mr.
Sweeney's self-serving efforts have
caused the reputations and
traditions of these organizations
to suffer more than enough
already. In addition to this, it
would appear that Mr. Sweeney is
not legally eligible to serve in
either position.
As for Mr. Sweeney's reply to
Mr. Gould, I would like to say
that Mr. Gould is a gentleman,
and hardly the sort of person to
indulge in "authoritarian
fantasies." In these respects he
would seem to be the antithesis of
Mr. Sweeney.

GM Stock Issue ,
Editor, The Daily :
For the sake of an accurate
record, let me correct some errors
of fact in Robert Spencer's Article
of 8 April entitled 'An Ancient
Vending Machine'. The resolution
presented to the Senate on April 2
asked that Stanford's Board of
Trustees consider voting its
proxies in favor of the two
Nader-backed propositions that
will appear on the General Motors
proxy ballot.

Since I spoke in favor of the
propositions themselves, I
personally did want "to marshal
support" for them. But the
wording of the resolution made
only the modest request for the
Board's consideration. Secondly,
the resolution was not "mine"
except in the sense that I gathered
the signatures necessary to get it
before the Senate. It was rather a
resolution placed on the action
calendar by eleven members of
the Senate. Finally, I am sure
Professor George Bach is keenly
aware of what is happening in the
world.
Ronald A. Rebholz
Department of English
Proper Senate Stance
Editor, The Daily:
Your columnist, Robert
Spencer, reports me in the April 8
DAILY at some length on the
topic of the attitude of the
Academic Senate in relation to
the request that it take a position
on voting the University's GM
stock in connection with the
so-called Nader proposal.
Since Mr. Spencer's "report"
bears only the vaguest
resemblance to what I actually
said, I hope you will grant me a
few lines to indicate the position I
actually presented. Incidentally,
so far as I know Mr. Spencer was
not there, and one may wonder
where he got his information.
The central point I argued, as
did a number of other Senators, is
that the Academic Senate is an
academic institution and should
not begin taking positions on
behalf of the Stanford faculty on
non-academic issues, be they

political, social, economic, or of
any other non-academic variety. I
emphasized that this was not
because I personally do not feel
strongly about the pollution issue;
I do. But I believe, as apparently
do a number of other Senators,
that if the Senate begins taking
positions on such non-academic
issues, the number of such issues
is virtually unlimited and they will
become a deeply devisive force in
the Senate, undercutting its
ability to do effectively its central
job on academic issues. Pollution
is indeed "our problem". It is our
problem individually, however,
and not as a University Senate.
So far as I know, Spencer's
paragraph about the "sanguinary
carnage wreaked in healthy proxy
fights" has nothing to do with
anything I said.
Issues like the "polluiton
problem" are complex and
difficult ones in a society like
ours. I personally believe that the
political process (laws passed and
morally supported by the bulk of
the people) represents the most
effective, and probably the only
effective, way of dealing with
most of these big issues. They
simply range beyond local control
or actions of individual
businessmen or citizens. My
personal hope would be that some
of the energies being devoted to
this problem could be focussed
where I think they will do the
most good - on getting more
effective legislation governing the
problems involved.

Speech-Drama Cuts
Editor, The Daily:
Although I am not a regular
member of the debate squad here
at Stanford, I have participated in
certain speech activities here and
am well acquainted with several
Stanford debaters. My concern
and disgust, therefore, for the
virtual phasing out of the debate
program along with the entire
Speech Department is sincerely
felt.
I am appalled that a university
of Stanford's stature would even
think of dropping the University's
chief source of academic
competition. Stanford, under the
directorship of Dr. Mosier, has
gained recognition as one of the
top three squads in the country.
In addition, its program is of such
high caliber that high school
organizations (most of which will
have better programs than
Stanford's after the cuts), have
sought Stanford as the site for
many important state and
national tournaments. And this
the squad has been able to do
only after scraping the bottom of
the Senate's financial barrel for
funds, which seems to yield more
readily to causes of more dubious
value to the University as a whole.
There are numerous other

reasons for retaining the program,
such as maintaining the academic
prestige of the University and
keeping our educational priorities
in order. I certainly hope the
University reconsiders this action,
which displays naught but the
basest understanding of the value
of forensics and the liberal arts,
and which I thought could only
occur in a second rate institution,
or worse yet, in a high school

an odd way, reminiscent of 1984
doublethink, our local
revolution-addicts could create
the very conditions they say they
oppose: fascism, repression and
tyranny.
Yesterday while viewing the
broken windows, I heard a liberal
professor mutter, "These idiots
will make a conservative of me
yet!" I assure you he has much
farther to go than the average
member of our silent (but
awakening) majority.
So the next time you find
yourself with an overpowering
urge to hurl a rock through a
window, please remember it is not
just a stone you cast but 100
votes for Ronald Reagan.

Sweeney Must Go
Editor, The Daily:
As a formed editor-in-chief of
the Chaparral and President of the
Hammer and Coffin Society
(1959-1960), I would like to lend
my support to Barney Gould's
request that Michael Sweeney
resign as President of the Hammer
and Coffin Society. According to
the Constitution and By-Laws of
the Society, this implies his
resignation as editor of the
Chaparral as well. Certainly Mr.
Sweeney's self-serving efforts have
caused the reputations and
traditions of these organizations
to suffer more than enough
already. In addition to this, it
would appear that Mr. Sweeney is
not legally eligible to serve in
either position.
As for Mr. Sweeney's reply to
Mr. Gould, I would like to say
that Mr. Gould is a gentleman,
and hardly the sort of person to
indulge in "authoritarian
fantasies." In these respects he
would seem to be the antithesis of
Mr. Sweeney.

Acting Assistant Professor
GM Stock Issue ,
Editor, The Daily :
For the sake of an accurate
record, let me correct some errors
of fact in Robert Spencer's Article
of 8 April entitled 'An Ancient
Vending Machine'. The resolution
presented to the Senate on April 2
asked that Stanford's Board of
Trustees consider voting its
proxies in favor of the two
Nader-backed propositions that
will appear on the General Motors
proxy ballot.

Since I spoke in favor of the
propositions themselves, I
personally did want "to marshal
support" for them. But the
wording of the resolution made
only the modest request for the
Board's consideration. Secondly,
the resolution was not "mine"
except in the sense that I gathered
the signatures necessary to get it
before the Senate. It was rather a
resolution placed on the action
calendar by eleven members of
the Senate. Finally, I am sure
Professor George Bach is keenly
aware of what is happening in the
world.

Proper Senate Stance
Editor, The Daily:
Your columnist, Robert
Spencer, reports me in the April 8
DAILY at some length on the
topic of the attitude of the
Academic Senate in relation to
the request that it take a position
on voting the University's GM
stock in connection with the
so-called Nader proposal.
Since Mr. Spencer's "report"
bears only the vaguest
resemblance to what I actually
said, I hope you will grant me a
few lines to indicate the position I
actually presented. Incidentally,
so far as I know Mr. Spencer was
not there, and one may wonder
where he got his information.
The central point I argued, as
did a number of other Senators, is
that the Academic Senate is an
academic institution and should
not begin taking positions on
behalf of the Stanford faculty on
non-academic issues, be they

political, social, economic, or of
any other non-academic variety. I
emphasized that this was not
because I personally do not feel
strongly about the pollution issue;
I do. But I believe, as apparently
do a number of other Senators,
that if the Senate begins taking
positions on such non-academic
issues, the number of such issues
is virtually unlimited and they will
become a deeply devisive force in
the Senate, undercutting its
ability to do effectively its central
job on academic issues. Pollution
is indeed "our problem". It is our
problem individually, however,
and not as a University Senate.
So far as I know, Spencer's
paragraph about the "sanguinary
carnage wreaked in healthy proxy
fights" has nothing to do with
anything I said.
Issues like the "polluiton
problem" are complex and
difficult ones in a society like
ours. I personally believe that the
political process (laws passed and
morally supported by the bulk of
the people) represents the most
effective, and probably the only
effective, way of dealing with
most of these big issues. They
simply range beyond local control
or actions of individual
businessmen or citizens. My
personal hope would be that some
of the energies being devoted to
this problem could be focussed
where I think they will do the
most good - on getting more
effective legislation governing the
problems involved.

Speech-Drama Cuts
Editor, The Daily:
Although I am not a regular
member of the debate squad here
at Stanford, I have participated in
certain speech activities here and
am well acquainted with several
Stanford debaters. My concern
and disgust, therefore, for the
virtual phasing out of the debate
program along with the entire
Speech Department is sincerely
felt.
I am appalled that a university
of Stanford's stature would even
think of dropping the University's
chief source of academic
competition. Stanford, under the
directorship of Dr. Mosier, has
gained recognition as one of the
top three squads in the country.
In addition, its program is of such
high caliber that high school
organizations (most of which will
have better programs than
Stanford's after the cuts), have
sought Stanford as the site for
many important state and
national tournaments. And this
the squad has been able to do
only after scraping the bottom of
the Senate's financial barrel for
funds, which seems to yield more
readily to causes of more dubious
value to the University as a whole.
There are numerous other

reasons for retaining the program,
such as maintaining the academic
prestige of the University and
keeping our educational priorities
in order. I certainly hope the
University reconsiders this action,
which displays naught but the
basest understanding of the value
of forensics and the liberal arts,
and which I thought could only
occur in a second rate institution,
or worse yet, in a high school

Off the Clothes
Editor, The Daily :
I should like to address myself
to the young man who wore the
woolen ski face mask for his TV
debut at the ROTC builidng the
other day. It must have been
dreadfully warm and
uncomfortable. May I suggest
something in permanent press
percale, perhaps with long flowing
sleeves and a hood rising to an
attractive point on top.
Betty M. Frischmann
Open Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
A few things concerning the
column in Wednesday's Daily,
"From the Inside - One Cadet's
Criticism."
Shouldn't Daily policy
concerning letters and columns be
a bit more consistent? If letters
must be signed to be printed, why
not columns? You say the author
"refused to give his name." I can
understand why: No one would
believe that Michael Sweeney,
Leonard Siegel,' or whatever
Movement member wrote that
column is enrolled in the ROTC
program.
I challenge anyone to convince
me that that article was written
by an ROTC cadet.

Braunstein A musing
Editor, The Daily:
I read with amusement Mr.
Braunstein's indignant and
ungrammatical statement "I plan
to spend as much of my time in
the ROTC building to show tnv

defiance and contempt for this
illegal regulation." His moral
outrage may be commendable; it
is unfortunate that it is so
narrow-minded. No mention was
made of the wanton destruction
by protestors that has occurred
within the past week. One might
ask how Mr. Braunstein would
complete his sentence. Perhaps he
intended to say "1 plan to spend
as much of my time in the ROTC
building to show my defiance and
contempt for this regulation and
to illustrate my disrespect for the
democratic workings of the
Academic Senate as I plan to
spend time breaking windows."

Broken Windows
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to invite everyone
to come over to the Aero and
Astro Building to see the
destruction caused by the
"Off-ROTC" rock-hurling brigade.
Each broken window will cost
$100 or so to replace. The damage
so far runs close to $10,000. Who
pays for this? You do. The money
comes out of the University
General Fund, which is fed by
your tuition. Can you afford to
pay for such waste?
There is, however, a greater
price to pay than $10,000. The
price is erosion of our freedoms.
Anarchy does not coexist with
freedom. Each act of political
violence stirs a counter-current of
repression. The Wallaces, Agnews
and the Reagans feast on campus
riots. A few more Isla Vistas and
Jess Unruh can kiss-off his diet
because Ronnie Reagan will be
riding herd on four more years of
Death Valley Days in Sacramento.
Not to mention Spiro T. who will
make us all wish he would join the
silent majority.
America is not a fascist
country now (in fact, if it were
one, nobody would have the
freedom to call it fascist).
However the right-wing reaction
to campus turmoil can unleash a
whirlwind which will overpower
Stanford's motto (taanslated),
"The winds of freedom blow." In
an odd way, reminiscent of 1984
doublethink, our local
revolution-addicts could create
the very conditions they say they
oppose: fascism, repression and
tyranny.
Yesterday while viewing the
broken windows, I heard a liberal
professor mutter, "These idiots
will make a conservative of me
yet!" I assure you he has much
farther to go than the average
member of our silent (but
awakening) majority.
So the next time you find
yourself with an overpowering
urge to hurl a rock through a
window, please remember it is not
just a stone you cast but 100
votes for Ronald Reagan.
