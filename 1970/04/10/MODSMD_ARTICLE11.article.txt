# Phi Delts Fight Back
## Brotherhood Not A Lie 
### Rich Viken 
The word that kept cropping
up in recent Daily columns on
fraternities and that seemed to be
the subject of debate was
"brotherhood." I agree with the
April 7 th article in that the
existence of brotherhood within
Stanford fraternities is a total
myth. The hard-core fraternity
chapters in the Midwest and Deep
South probably savor the only
remnants of true "Fraternity
Brotherhood" in America.
What we call brotherhood on
the West Coast strongly conforms
to the description given in the
article of April 7: a houseful of
cliques with the interaction
between them raging from a deep
respect shared by close friends to
little respect at all for others. I
don't believe it can be denied that
this defines the situation in every
fraternity and living group on the
Stanford campus.
'Just Swell'
Only one type of male will
seek a living arrangement wherein
he finds all the guys "just swell."
Similarly, no one in his right mind
will join a fraternity because he
likes one or two members and
couldn't care less about
befriending anybody else.
Fraternity life around here
requires a delicate balance
between like and dislike, regarding
those with whom one is living.
Consequently, I think the article
"Frat Variety" had no business
trying to paint a rosy picture of a
fraternity as "first and foremost a
brotherhood."
On the other hand, I am
greatly disturbed by the attitude
displayed in the article entitled
"Lie of 'Brotherhood'." One can
hardly write an objective analysis
when he has an axe to grind. The
first two sentences of this article
give the indication of an
intelligent criticism of Joe Virga
and fraternities in general (which
is exactly what Joe wrote about in
his April 3rd article). Strangely
enough, the third sentence, and
every sentence thereafter, is a
blatant slam on the Phi Delt house
in particular.
Certainly, several of the
objectionable conditions
mentioned are true, but they are
also true for nearly every
fraternity house on campus. The
article in question, however, has
taken these conditions as they
apply specifically to the Phi Delt
house and has blown them out of
proportion, apparently in the
hope that this will serve as an
antidote for a bitter pill once
swallowed. Prospective members
are fully aware of these conditions
before they join.
The Phi Delt house owes
money all right (and who

doesn't?), but to Stanford
University, which owns over half
of the house. In view of this
situation, I think the description
of the house as being "always on
the verge of bankruptcy" is highly
misleading.
The rationale behind pledge
training is that the best way to
unite a group of men who are
going to be living together the rest
of their college lives is to pit them
against a common "challenge." I
use the word challenge here in a
facetious way, since the activities
of pledge training are all meant in
fun. Pledge training can be a very
rewarding, enjoyable, and
memorable experience, IF one
simply "plays the game," without
taking anything personally.
'Changed a Lot'
Housework is designed not to
humiliate the man but is
performed by pledges because
somebody must do the work, and
sophomores usually have fewer
responsibilities than
upperclassmen. The tasks are
evenly divided among the pledges,
so that a minimum of time and
effort need be spent per week per
individual. Several times this year
I have seen a number of actives

voluntarily clean up before and
after special events.
The April 7th article is
obviously dated, since it uses the
academic year 1968-69 as its only
reference point with respect to
time. Hopefully, no one needs to
be reminded that this is the
academic year 1969-70, and that
people and houses change a lot in
a year's time. Furthermore, the
April 7th article assigns to the Phi
Delt house a "motto," which I
haven't heard since the days of
Pat Boone and white bucks. If
"Fuck the brothers" is the real
Phi Delt catchword, it is a
remarkable feat that 56 men can
withstand such punishment and
indignation from themselves.
Unfortunately, some people
find out too late that life in a
fraternity house is not for them.
Most of these people leave
immediately, realize their mistake,
and forget about it. Others leave
immediately, put a chip on their
shoulder, and write articles for the
Daily. The simplest rule to
remember in this case is that one
only gets out of a fraternity what
he puts into it.
