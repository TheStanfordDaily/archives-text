# Confused Stand
## CAC-Status Quo Apologists 
### Sandy Perry 
For a year now the CAC has sought to set itself
up as a rational bulwark amid the chaotic gusts of
left and right wing political sentiment on campus.
I think a closer analysis of their typical arguments,
however, shows less of careful reasoning than it
does a thinly disguised apology for the status quo.
In their latest effort, "LET'S CONSIDER:
MORAL ACTIONS," they contend in a nutshell
that "a person who engages in immoral actions
becomes immoral." This, the principle on which
they base their entire argument and hence their
political stance, is totally unsatisfactory on two
counts.
First, it leaves the concept of "immoral"
utterly undefined; one can merely glean from the
list of examples given (breaking and entering,
seizure of property, bombings, arson, beatings,
assault, murder) that the CAC's criteria for moral
action are wholly abstract, absolute, and arbitrary
standards, and are patently drawn solely from
convention.
This method of moral discrimination, however,
leaves itself open to innumerable difficulties in
practical application. Take the extreme example:
in 1940 one is given the chance to murder (and
only to murder) Hitler, and thereby foreseeably
save five million lives. In this situation the CAC
argument pales both in logic and humaneness
before one which finds this murder not only
justifiable but perhaps even a moral imperative.

Once again, however, this is an arbitrary and
abstract distinction which falls down when
confronted with certain real situations; it is clear,
for instance, that on many occasions inaction in its
negative way can have as much of an effect on
others as does action.
A similar dilemma confronts Americans in the
face of the Vietnam War. To argue that it is
immoral to combat evil with evil is at best
irrelevant in a situation like the present one, where
we're all so deeply mired in evil to begin with that
inaction itself is corrupt. The problem is clearly
not one of choosing between an arbitrary good
and evil, but of choosing among degrees and types
of evil; in short, of redefining the concepts of good
and evil altogether, in accordance with their
contexts. In doing so one must take care to avoid
on the one hand principles so abstract as to be
useless, such as those of the CAC, and on the other
hand the loss of all principles altogether, as is
threatened by the liberal anarchist element in the
radical movement.
"How can we tell the good from the bad," asks
Mao, "by the motive (the subjective intention) or
by the effect (social practice)? Idealists stress
motive and ignore effect, while mechanical
materialists stress effect and ignore motive. In
contradistinction to both, we dialectical
materialists insist on the unity of motive and
effect."

utterly undefined; one can merely glean from the
list of examples given (breaking and entering,
seizure of property, bombings, arson, beatings,
assault, murder) that the CAC's criteria for moral
action are wholly abstract, absolute, and arbitrary
standards, and are patently drawn solely from
convention.
This method of moral discrimination, however,
leaves itself open to innumerable difficulties in
practical application. Take the extreme example:
in 1940 one is given the chance to murder (and
only to murder) Hitler, and thereby foreseeably
save five million lives. In this situation the CAC
argument pales both in logic and humaneness
before one which finds this murder not only
justifiable but perhaps even a moral imperative.

Once again, however, this is an arbitrary and
abstract distinction which falls down when
confronted with certain real situations; it is clear,
for instance, that on many occasions inaction in its
negative way can have as much of an effect on
others as does action.
A similar dilemma confronts Americans in the
face of the Vietnam War. To argue that it is
immoral to combat evil with evil is at best
irrelevant in a situation like the present one, where
we're all so deeply mired in evil to begin with that
inaction itself is corrupt. The problem is clearly
not one of choosing between an arbitrary good
and evil, but of choosing among degrees and types
of evil; in short, of redefining the concepts of good
and evil altogether, in accordance with their
contexts. In doing so one must take care to avoid
on the one hand principles so abstract as to be
useless, such as those of the CAC, and on the other
hand the loss of all principles altogether, as is
threatened by the liberal anarchist element in the
radical movement.
"How can we tell the good from the bad," asks
Mao, "by the motive (the subjective intention) or
by the effect (social practice)? Idealists stress
motive and ignore effect, while mechanical
materialists stress effect and ignore motive. In
contradistinction to both, we dialectical
materialists insist on the unity of motive and
effect."
For a year now the CAC has sought to set itself
up as a rational bulwark amid the chaotic gusts of
left and right wing political sentiment on campus.
I think a closer analysis of their typical arguments,
however, shows less of careful reasoning than it
does a thinly disguised apology for the status quo.
In their latest effort, "LET'S CONSIDER:
MORAL ACTIONS," they contend in a nutshell
that "a person who engages in immoral actions
becomes immoral." This, the principle on which
they base their entire argument and hence their
political stance, is totally unsatisfactory on two
counts.
First, it leaves the concept of "immoral"
utterly undefined; one can merely glean from the
list of examples given (breaking and entering,
seizure of property, bombings, arson, beatings,
assault, murder) that the CAC's criteria for moral
action are wholly abstract, absolute, and arbitrary
standards, and are patently drawn solely from
