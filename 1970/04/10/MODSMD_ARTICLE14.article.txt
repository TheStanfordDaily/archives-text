# The 						Environment
## Crowding And The Car Crush 
### 
"Overpopulation is the main problem Scientists fear that if people,
like rats, live too close together, they will destroy each other."—a Palo
Alto fifth-grader's response to a questionnaire on environment is
inserted in the Congressional Record by Repr. George E. Brown (D.,
Calif.). This is an admirable example of the vitality and awareness of
one of today's schoolgirls.
Grayer heads have voiced the same threat of doom that we will
destroy ourselves like the lemmings, even if we find technical and
political solutions to the hazards of war, famine and pollution.
The argument is often self-contradictory. On the one hand, we are
in a bad fix about population because we have lost, in the course of
evolution, the behavioral regulators that keep some animal species
from overgrowing their habitat. On the other hand, our collective
psyche is supposedly still shadowed by an urge to self-destruction that
will become irresistible when our population exceeds a certain
density.
Scientists are indeed making some extraordinarily interesting
discoveries about the effects of crowding on reproductive failure and
on fighting in animal communities. The results vary a great deal
among different species and circumstances. One important
generalization is that the introduction of a strange male into a group is
likely to be more stressful than crowding itself.
Crowding Leads to Crime
Some popularizers have insisted that crowding leads directly to
crime and other social pathology—as an inevitable consequence of
man's animal heritage. Scientists working in the laboratory and
involved in objective psychological testing are much more critical and
cautious. The noted anthropologist, Edward T. Hall, has been one of
the most avid students of "proxemics," the science of man's use of
space. In "The Hidden Dimension," he writes: "The animal studies
also teach us that crowding per se is neither good nor bad, but rather
that overstimulation and disruptions of social relationships as a
consequence of overlapping personal distances lead to population
collapse."
He then goes on to discuss methods of environmental management,
through architecture and urban planning, that can minimize the stress
on the human organism that may be a byproduct of crowding.
The organization of our communities then faces us as the essential
issue for our survival as a species. Planning new cities, and the
rebuilding of our old ones, are inelegant challenges. They involve
complicated and intellectually unrewarding arrangements of people
and resources. The academic mind is not the best adapted for these
tasks; but it may still unearth a great deal about the biology and
psychology of living together which is profoundly relevant. Airy
speculations about the biological inevitability of doom are not only
bad science, but serious impediments to solving some of our most
urgent problems.
One of the most immoral suggestions now adrift on our campuses is
that we must pull back on our economic growth. Obviously, we are a
badly mis-developed country, but a redirection, not a regression, is
what we need. The reconstruction of our cities is already a task which
can properly consume any conceivable surplus that our industrial
economy can generate.
Another Daily Mistake
It appears that the DAILY made another mistake yesterday. The
cartoon oh page 2 was by Stanley Richard Krute, and not by Stanley
Ramey, who happens to be a colonel with the ROTC group here. As
usual, the DAILY regrets the error.
Young Mr. Krute stated, "I'm very concerned and will issue a
statement in the morning."

The automobile has rightly
been called the key in our struggle
for survival since it accounts for
85 percent of all air pollution in
America. But efforts to produce
an emission free car, even if
successful, amount to band-aid
medicine, disguising the fact that
we will probably have to scrap it
completely before too many years
have gone by.
There are 83 million of these
steel beasts in this country,
enough to stretch around the
world bumper to bumper ten
times, enough to fill a parking lot
of 358 square miles. The roads
needed to transport this monster
add up to 3.7 million miles, which
equals a parking lot of solid gravel
and pavement of 32,000 square
miles!
As Kenneth Cantor has pointed
out, each car in Berkeley has 968
square feet of road space while
each citizen has 28.1 square feet
of parks. A full 26 percent of
Berkeley's land area is given over
to roads, driveways, garages,
parking lots, service stations, and
car washes. One might ask: "Who
is in charge here, anyway?"
At the moment the U.S.
consumption of oxygen by the
burning of fossil fuels amounts to
9.8 trillion pounds a year, while
the green plants of the country
aryproducing only 5.8 trillion
tons. (Presumably, the deficit is
made up from oxygen wafted in
from the Third World.)
Meanwhile, we are paving over
one million acres of oxygen
producing land per year for roads
and parking lots.
Private Car Not Worth 11
When you add up the score the
private car is not worth it. TV
commercials portray the car on
the open road, the open field, the
open beach, things which are hard
to find these days, cxcept by
those who make commercials.
But, in fact, the car merely
provides us with more expensive
equipment to fight increasing
traffic in a mad attempt to go to
another city which looks just as
bad as the one behind.
Designed to gobble up the road
at better than 80, most of the
cars on the road at any given
moment are involved in snarling
traffic jams creeping around
cloverleaves at 10 m.p.h
Advert ised as the panacea of
civilized man, cars are crowding us
( t of the country and lining the
pockets of corporations like GM,
which now figures up to be the

third richest "nation" in the
world.
The car involves a vast support
system, involving half the oil
derricks in this country, huge 40
inch pipelines stretching hundreds
of miles across the land, some 180
tankers with r 100,000 ton
capacity (3io larger
"supertankers" are now on the
drawing boards), and a
consumption of steel and rubber
that boggles the imagination.
Cost-Benefit Analysis
A cost-benefit analysis reveals
that the individual owner is
paying through the teeth for the
luxury of the car. Adding
depreciation, interest on purchase,
gasoline, insurance, highway
taxes, garage rental, toll charges,
and parking fees adds up to
literally hundreds of dollars
annually. Work it out sometime.
One sixth of the GNP derives
from the auto industry which
means that 6 out of 36 working
hours of your time go to pay for
it every week. If you drive the
average 12,000 miles annually
you spend about 10 hours driving
every week. For every lOhoursof
driving you pay for it by working
six. This, I contend, is a colossal
waste of time which could be
spent on something more
enlightening.
The car is directly responsible
for the vast expansion of urban
centers into unlivable
catastrophes. We have been
hoodwinked into believing it is
enjoyable to drive 50 miles or
more for a movie and a glass of
beer. We live in a civilization
where a broken carburetor can
leave us stranded, unable to shop,
visit, or find our friends.
Complete Han
The complete banning of the
automobile and the diversion of
the money now spent on it could
build subway networks in every
city and rapid, scenic
transportation to every city.

beach, and National Park in the
country. Such a radical redesign
of the nation would effectively
restructure our cities from end to
end, since all the roads right up to
every front door could be turned
into scenic walks and greenbelts.
The landscape would be quiet and
safe for children, and suburbs
might become communities rather
than terminal points in ft Cement
Wilderness.
Those who call this Utopian
should consider the present
situation. The time, money, and
space devoted to the car has
turned ours into the first
Automotive Civilization. At
present the car population of
American is increasing at the same
rate as the human population.
Heralded around the world as the
symbol of American affluence,
the car disease is rapidly infecting
the whole planet.
There is reason to believe we
will clean up our air and water.
The instinct for survival will force
us, one way or another. But space
consumption is more subtle, more
creeping. Emission free exhausts
could fool us into inaction and
the car would linger on, exacting
an immense but hidden toll in our
lives by building an Asphalt
Wilderness and calling it progress
and freedom.
