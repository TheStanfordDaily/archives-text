# Hard Rock Blues
## Questions For Radicals 
### Christie Viggers 
I'd like to see an article
presenting a radical's answers to
the following questions:
How is throwing rocks through
windows of buildings related to
the political and social issues
discussed at meetings?
How can anyone throwing a
rock through a window from the
center of a large crowd in the
middle of the night appear to
onlookers as anything else but a
coward afraid of being identified
with his actions?
How can those associated
directly with midnight window
breakers appear as anything but
uncritical sheep, convinced by the
hard core that breaking windows
will do something besides alienate
more and more people every day?
How is the time and energy
that must be spent for students'
safety and for the preservation of
the buildings on campus justified?
Is it realized that this energy
could be directed towards change
and constructive activities if rock
throwers ceased to exist?
The theory that society needs a
shock to start thinking and talking
that result in problem solving is a
good one. But can't this theory be
more effectively used by showing
flicks or having exhibits (i.e. of
how much food one person would
get per day if all the food in the
world was divided equally) than
by breaking windows? Doesn't
breaking windows just get people
like me talking about breaking
windows and not about ways to
solve social and political
problems?
If Stanford radicals are
anti-establishment enough to have
lost faith in the peaceful means of
change existing, why do they
attend Stanford where critical
thinking and problem solving are
the thrust of the undergraduate
years? It seems many of the
radicals I've attempted to talk
with are through hearing, much
less discussing, other points of
view.
I think it's pretty clear when
young people all over the country
are trying to dodge the draft that
something is rotten, and I don't
know very many people who feel
without a doubt that the U.S.
should be in Vietnam. I also dc)n't
know very many people who find
breaking windows particularly
relevant to anything but juvenile
delinquency.
Attacks on symbols such as
ROTC don't seem as valuable as
other actions could be. Demands
for classes teaching what is going
on in Vietnam that include
different points of view of why
we are there is one suggestion of
what might be more valuable.
What is happening in Paris? What

is said when Congressmen discuss
Vietnam? might be other topics.
Students of American government
and of history might be able to
learn (or at least make intelligent
guesses on) what really runs our
country. Students might be able
to learn the logic of someone who
defends killing, or someone who
thinks we should have no police.
I think it is too bad when bus
loads of policemen have to spend
their time on a campus of

supposedly "above average"
people chasing rock throwers
while they are needed elsewhere
patrolling our roads and cities.
In short, I think the $2500
spent on windows last week could
have been spent in a better way. I
think using violence as a means to
an end today in America focuses
attention on the violence, not on
the goal, just as the Vietnam War
has resulted in concern over the
killing and not over the cause.
