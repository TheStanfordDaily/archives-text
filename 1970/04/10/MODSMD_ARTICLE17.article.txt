# Hornsby's Highlights
## Obscurity Is Its Own Reward 
### BISON HORNSBY 
Ah, the joys of groveling in
obscure albums—the pleasure in
finding something good or the
vituperative ecstacy of making a
flower pot of a particularly bad
album; e.g., Lord Sutch. The
latest group is somewhat more
mundane but still worth sharing.
Mark Lindsay got up early (the
album jacket shows plenty of
eyelid) to convince you that "he's
gone through a lot of changes"
(which is calls "extensions")
presumably towards more
sensitivity since the days of his
Saturday-morning-imitation-Mon
kees-and-hootenany show with
Paul Revere.
Trying to capitalize and expand
on the popular trend of glorifying
cities in song ("Seattle," "San
Francisco," "Galveston"), Mark
embraces the whole state of
"Arizona," with such deathless
lyrics as "She must belong to San
Francisco, She must have lost her
way." He does some other drippy
numbers and some strikingly
unattractive arrangements of
half-commercial, half-art songs
like "I'll Never Fall in Love
Again." (popularized by Dionne
Warwick) and "Something" (a
special treat here is a completely
uncalled for 8-bar a cappela vocal
intro). "Miss America" really
moved me; the whole album is
pretentious supermarket music.
Time of Changes
The Fabulous Charlie Rich
gives a look at the kind of changes
that a "Mohair Sam" man might
make. It's not that he ain't so
fast-talkin' or slow-walkin'

anymo' (he sure is good-lookin',
dyed white D.A. hair, hmmm,
hmmm), it's just that he's into
other things . . . like crooning a
little Elvis-style and some more
country type material. The best
cut on the album, "July the 12th
1939" has been getting some FM
play and it's cool. Charlie sings
and talks his way through this
plaintive, driving ballad 'bout
women, money 'n poo' boys (with
innuendoes of rape). The song is
well arranged and the backup is
fantastic; it's too bad the rest of
the album is not as notable.
You've heard Frijid Pink's 45;
that's the heavy fuzz zipper
guitar that hemorraged your car
radio about two weeks ago. On
the album version, that guitar
goes, neetsy keene, back and forth
between the speakers of your
stereo. However, it is a mystery to
me how any group can stomach
doing another version of "House

of the Rising Sun," except that
since it's in the public domain, no
writer need be paid All of this
smacks of commercialism, and
then they lay this on you, "You
have your protestors, I don't want
'em, can't you see. You can take
your drugs, baby, don't inject 'em
in me." That kind of drivel leaves
me frigid.
HI vis Hendrix?
Phiiamore Lincoln gives you a
nice pic of his navel and lower lip
as he tries to cross the surliness of
Elvis with the cool of Jimi
Hendrix. Inside the cover ary
some nice cuts showing soul and
chicken guitar influences, and a
pretty song called "Temma
Harbour" which I mistook for
Donovan.
The album cover of Fuse
brought new technology into
my possession; I always told my
mommy that I'd learn something
from rock. This is a young group

with a strong instrumental sound,
well-integrated, and melodic, if
not virtuoso, fuzz guitar and
absolutely great drumming. The
engineering came out well; it's a
pity that the vocals are so
non-melodic and uninspired
because this could be a neat
album.
Concert Wrap-up
On the concert side, the Family
Dog is getting to be a favorite
place. Two weeks ago,
Commander Cody failed to warm
the crowd for the Youngbloods
whose low tension style often
leave the fans somewhat
unfulfilled. Jesse and Banana are
great though and it's really
pleasant just to listen and not
twitch.
It's A Beautiful Day put in a
surprise "dawn" appearance, but
were not as exciting as they were
at the Grateful Dead Bail Bond
concert (outasight!). Cody
featured an amusing interplay
between an extraterrestial violin
player and a mechanical drummer
whose eyes were closed for the
whole set. The spacey lead singer
bashed an acoustic guitar and
poured out torrid old favorites
like "I'm Truckin'." The
Youngbloods were more than
welcome.
Burdon is Back
Last weekend Eric Burdon (ah,
the original "Rising Sun") excited
a date-night crowd who barely
tolerated Ballin' Jack, a tight and
funky Seattle group with a great
bass player and horn section.
They did put out some weak

patter between songs but deserved
a better reception.
The fans did get it on for the
violence of Eric and his new group
WAR (all black except the harp
player); the man is kno»vn for his
screamin' blues and bouncing
cross the stage. The visual show
was key: the conga player looked
like Buddha, and the bass player
(in shades like all bass players)
was not from our planet. Pigpen
sat in on the congas—all in all, an
amusing performance.
Coming Concerts
This weekend has some
interesting groups; at the Dog, we
find Albert Collins (blues) and the
Rhythm Dukes (what's left of
Moby Grape). At the Fillmore
West will be Grateful Dead, the
Miles Davis Quintet, and Stone
the Crows. The Berkeley
Community Theater has Buffy St.
Marie on Friday night, and
Ritchie Havens and Turilee
Richards (who has "Love Minus
Zero/No Limit" by Dylan out
over AM) on Saturday.
The best show of the weekend,
however, may be at the Old
Fillmore where Hot Tuna (Jorma
and Jack of the Airplane) work
out with the Amboy Dukes and
the Flamin' Groovies.
If you like sunshine or hate
driving, Frost Amphitheater at
12:30 Sunday will have Cold
Blood, Elvin Bishop, Aum, Dan
Hicks & his Hot Licks, and two
others. In the immortal words of
Dear Abby, "You can't always get
what you want, so you better like
what you get."
