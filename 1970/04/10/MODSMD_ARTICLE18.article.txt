# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Judy, Joni, Joan, and Jean On Top 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
The folk tradition is the life of
the people. Whenever men care,
they sing, to make the work
easier, the wars shorter, the
protests stronger. The message
lives and grows in the song. Judy
Collins, Joni Mitchell, Jean
Ritchie and Joan Baez Harris are
all living and growing, and
demonstrating the folk tradition
alive today.
Jean Ritchie is from
Appalachia. For thirty years, she
has been singing the traditional
mountain songs, and she knows
more about this music than nearly
anyone. Her album "Clear Waters
Remembered," on the London
label, puts the old songs to a new
use: she is condemning the rape of
her country by the strip miners.
West Virginia, she points out,
was the greenest, lushest most

pleasant spot on earth when she
was a girl. Now, due to the greed
and blindness of the mine owners,
the land is blighted, the waters
polluted, the trees gone, the earth
slipping away.
The old songs tell of the old life
and what some folks saw coming.
The message is clear: act now to
avoid our fate.
Jean Ritchie's voice is not
tender and sweet, for the times
she sings of were and are full of
agony. In songs like "Black
Waters," telling how the
once-fresh springs now run dark
with coal dust, she reminds us of
the years when singing was the
only way to keep spirits up. It is a
painful and a beautiful album.

Joan Baez Harris has a new
album out this month, "One Day
At A Time," on Vanguard. It is

something of a sequel to her last
offering, the very fine "David's
Album." Joanie's theme is always
hope, peace, and non-violence,
symbolized on the latter release in
these words:
Will the circle be unbroken,
By and by, Lord, by and by,
There's a belter world
awaiting,
In the sky, Lord, in the sky. *
On the current album, the title
song reflects the same ideas:
I live one day at a time,
I dream one dream at a time,
Yesterday's dead and
tomorrow is blind,
I live one day at a time.
Both albums are really love
offerings to David (now at a work
camp in Arizona, where he was
transferred after organizing
prisoners to gain reforms at his
last camp). The message is
revolution, but peaceful,
non-violent revolution.
Joan's way is the gentle way,
and her songs are the gentle songs.
When she sings "I Dreamed I saw
Joe Hill Last Night," we know she
believes in the ideas, and she
knows the ideas will survive even
when the singers are imprisoned.
Musically, the album is good,
although not as stirring as
"David's Album" Jeffrey
Shurtleff provides some fine
harmony and takes some solo

passages, while the instrumental
background is provided by some
of Nashville's finest. Here we have
old songs sung in a new way, and
new songs sung in the old way—the
essence of the folk process.
Stardust Speaking
Finally, we should speak of
Joni Mitchell's excellent new
release, "Ladies of the Canyon."
Far superior to her first album,
"Ladies" may well become the
most popular folk LP of the year.
Joni's voice is stronger; she has
lost much of that little-girl twang
that was so disturbing before, her
arrangements are infinitely better,
and she demonstrates her skill on
piano as well as guitar in "Rainy
Night House," probably the best
cut.
As before, all the songs on the
album were written by Joni, who
j is becoming the best composer in
the folk tradition around. In
"Woodstock," she tries to evoke
the feelings of that weekend
(where she played), quite
successfully:

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Hack to the garden.
"Morning Morgantown" is the
only song I felt was unequal to
the others, the vocals being rushed
and the instrumental line blending
poorly.

Judy Collins doesn't have a new
album out, but she has lent her
name, her songs, and several
reminiscenses to a publisher, who
recently released "The Judy
Collins Songbook." The
arrangements are good and the
selection of songs is excellent. All
the Judy Collins songs I know or
would want to know are included.
It makes a fine complement to the
"Joan Baez Songbook" which
came out some time ago.
As long as people love and fear
and toil and play, they will sing of
their lives. These ladies in the folk
tradition help us to express
ourselves in song.
Peace and long life.

"Ladies" may well become the
most popular folk LP of the year.
Joni's voice is stronger; she has
lost much of that little-girl twang
that was so disturbing before, her
arrangements are infinitely better,
and she demonstrates her skill on
piano as well as guitar in "Rainy
Night House," probably the best
cut.
As before, all the songs on the
album were written by Joni, who
j is becoming the best composer in
the folk tradition around. In
"Woodstock," she tries to evoke
the feelings of that weekend
(where she played), quite
successfully:

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Hack to the garden.
"Morning Morgantown" is the
only song I felt was unequal to
the others, the vocals being rushed
and the instrumental line blending
poorly.

Judy Collins doesn't have a new
album out, but she has lent her
name, her songs, and several
reminiscenses to a publisher, who
recently released "The Judy
Collins Songbook." The
arrangements are good and the
selection of songs is excellent. All
the Judy Collins songs I know or
would want to know are included.
It makes a fine complement to the
"Joan Baez Songbook" which
came out some time ago.
As long as people love and fear
and toil and play, they will sing of
their lives. These ladies in the folk
tradition help us to express
ourselves in song.
Peace and long life.

The folk tradition is the life of
the people. Whenever men care,
they sing, to make the work
easier, the wars shorter, the
protests stronger. The message
lives and grows in the song. Judy
Collins, Joni Mitchell, Jean
Ritchie and Joan Baez Harris are
all living and growing, and
demonstrating the folk tradition
alive today.
Jean Ritchie is from
Appalachia. For thirty years, she
has been singing the traditional
mountain songs, and she knows
more about this music than nearly
anyone. Her album "Clear Waters
Remembered," on the London
label, puts the old songs to a new
use: she is condemning the rape of
her country by the strip miners.
West Virginia, she points out,
was the greenest, lushest most

pleasant spot on earth when she
was a girl. Now, due to the greed
and blindness of the mine owners,
the land is blighted, the waters
polluted, the trees gone, the earth
slipping away.
The old songs tell of the old life
and what some folks saw coming.
The message is clear: act now to
avoid our fate.
Jean Ritchie's voice is not
tender and sweet, for the times
she sings of were and are full of
agony. In songs like "Black
Waters," telling how the
once-fresh springs now run dark
with coal dust, she reminds us of
the years when singing was the
only way to keep spirits up. It is a
painful and a beautiful album.

Joan Baez Harris has a new
album out this month, "One Day
At A Time," on Vanguard. It is

something of a sequel to her last
offering, the very fine "David's
Album." Joanie's theme is always
hope, peace, and non-violence,
symbolized on the latter release in
these words:
Will the circle be unbroken,
By and by, Lord, by and by,
There's a belter world
awaiting,
In the sky, Lord, in the sky. *
On the current album, the title
song reflects the same ideas:
I live one day at a time,
I dream one dream at a time,
Yesterday's dead and
tomorrow is blind,
I live one day at a time.
Both albums are really love
offerings to David (now at a work
camp in Arizona, where he was
transferred after organizing
prisoners to gain reforms at his
last camp). The message is
revolution, but peaceful,
non-violent revolution.
Joan's way is the gentle way,
and her songs are the gentle songs.
When she sings "I Dreamed I saw
Joe Hill Last Night," we know she
believes in the ideas, and she
knows the ideas will survive even
when the singers are imprisoned.
Musically, the album is good,
although not as stirring as
"David's Album" Jeffrey
Shurtleff provides some fine
harmony and takes some solo

passages, while the instrumental
background is provided by some
of Nashville's finest. Here we have
old songs sung in a new way, and
new songs sung in the old way—the
essence of the folk process.

symbolized on the latter release in
these words:
Will the circle be unbroken,
By and by, Lord, by and by,
There's a belter world
awaiting,
In the sky, Lord, in the sky. *
On the current album, the title
song reflects the same ideas:
I live one day at a time,
I dream one dream at a time,
Yesterday's dead and
tomorrow is blind,
I live one day at a time.
Both albums are really love
offerings to David (now at a work
camp in Arizona, where he was
transferred after organizing
prisoners to gain reforms at his
last camp). The message is
revolution, but peaceful,
non-violent revolution.
Joan's way is the gentle way,
and her songs are the gentle songs.
When she sings "I Dreamed I saw
Joe Hill Last Night," we know she
believes in the ideas, and she
knows the ideas will survive even
when the singers are imprisoned.
Musically, the album is good,
although not as stirring as
"David's Album" Jeffrey
Shurtleff provides some fine
harmony and takes some solo

passages, while the instrumental
background is provided by some
of Nashville's finest. Here we have
old songs sung in a new way, and
new songs sung in the old way—the
essence of the folk process.
Stardust Speaking
Finally, we should speak of
Joni Mitchell's excellent new
release, "Ladies of the Canyon."
Far superior to her first album,
"Ladies" may well become the
most popular folk LP of the year.
Joni's voice is stronger; she has
lost much of that little-girl twang
that was so disturbing before, her
arrangements are infinitely better,
and she demonstrates her skill on
piano as well as guitar in "Rainy
Night House," probably the best
cut.
As before, all the songs on the
album were written by Joni, who
j is becoming the best composer in
the folk tradition around. In
"Woodstock," she tries to evoke
the feelings of that weekend
(where she played), quite
successfully:

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Hack to the garden.
"Morning Morgantown" is the
only song I felt was unequal to
the others, the vocals being rushed
and the instrumental line blending
poorly.
Broadsides
Judy Collins doesn't have a new
album out, but she has lent her
name, her songs, and several
reminiscenses to a publisher, who
recently released "The Judy
Collins Songbook." The
arrangements are good and the
selection of songs is excellent. All
the Judy Collins songs I know or
would want to know are included.
It makes a fine complement to the
"Joan Baez Songbook" which
came out some time ago.
As long as people love and fear
and toil and play, they will sing of
their lives. These ladies in the folk
tradition help us to express
ourselves in song.
Peace and long life.
