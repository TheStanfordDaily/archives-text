# Critic's Choice
## Giving The Oscar A Little Style 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Tinsel Town did it again, but
this time with a little more style
and organization. Wednesday
night, April 7, the Academy
Awards Variety Hour presented
"Hollywood Stars Then and
Now."
Part I featured Fred Astaire,
Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, and
John Wayne. Part 11, "Up and
Coming Has Beens" starred
Katharine Ross, Ali McGraw, Jon
Voight, and Elliot Gould.
For forty-one years the
Academy of Arts and Sciences
took itself too seriously. The
presentation of the Golden God
was always boring, too long and
apparently so meaningless that
most actors and actresses didn't
even bother to attend. Hollywood
was losing money and face, but
failed to recognize the facts.
Revolution
However, for the past two
years something like a revolution
started changing things.
Independent productions and
"Youth Oriented Films" started
to fill the coffers once again. In
1969 the change was quite
apparent as reflected in the films
nominated by the Academy for
Best .
The selection of Best Anything
is ludicrous in itself, but if it has
to be done to help inflate a few
egos, it might as well be done with
a little more style than The Ed
Sullivan Show.
The producers of this years
Academy Awards must have
caught an acute case of
creativeness, because surprisingly
enough, they sought to change
frequencies after forty-one years
of reruns. The program included
film clips of directors David Lean,
Kurosawa, Bergman, Wilder,
Schlesinger, Fellini, and Nichols,
offering words on how they
became directors and what they
think about censorship. But what
is most interesting is the fact that
only one out of all those
legendary directors had a picture

nominated for an Academy
Award.
Cooperation
All the sick jokes were kept at
a minimum and it seemed that a
few of the song and dance
numbers had actually been
rehearsed. However, after each
winner picked up his/her reward,
he/she had to thank everyone and
his grandmother for the moment.
But then, the cinema is a
cooperative medium.
Still, it was great seeing the
Stars as they really are, in real life.
Someone did a great job of
persuading most everyone,
including Elizabeth Taylor, to
attend. (Could it have been the
opportunity to show America her
assets, including a $1,050,000
diamond?)

Weekend
Flicks

Five potentially entertaining
films will be shown on campus
this weekend. A documentary, a

Chinese film, and a movie
filmed on the Stanford campus
are included in Saturday's and
Sunday's programs.
Saturday at Tresidder,
Wiseman's "High School" and
Beckett's "Film" will be screened
at 7, 8, and 9. Wiseman, famous
for his revealing documentaries
"Titicut Follies" and "Hospital,"
chose the students and faculty of
Northeast High School in
Philadelphia as an example of
secondary education in America.
High School
Northeast has all the elements
necessary for a well-rounded
repressive education. The
ex-Marine turned counselor, the
fat old English teacher who reads
"Casey at the Bat" to her high
school students, and the local
doctor who tells stupid jokes
while giving an auditorium full of
boys a lecture on sex are all stars
of this tragedy.
Aware of the presence of
Wiseman's camera, everyone
apparently thought they were
projecting a good, positive image.
Instead, they were being ridiculed
and laughed at. The result of this
"education" is students
exemplified by the one who
apologetically says to her teacher,
"I didn't mean to be
individualistic."
Beckett's "Film" is also being
shown on the same program.
Buster Keaton stars in this
one-character drama without

dialogue, that explores Beckett's
characteristic theme of
hopelessness in modern life.
Chinese Film
Sunday at 2:30 in Memorial
Auditorium, the Chinese Students
Association will present "Come
Drink WiLh Me," starring Cheng
Pei Pei and Yudh Hua. This action
Hick from Hong Kong features an
accomplished swordswoman and a
"Drunken Beggar" who can kill
without touching the victim,
maim without drawing blood, and
knock down his opponents with a
pair of chopsticks. Considered to
be the best sword-fighting film of
1966...
Premiere
The West Coast Premiere of
"The Girl Who Returned," filmed
on the Stanford campus, will be
shown at 7 and 9 in Cubberly.
This feature length comedy, made
by Stanley Kaufman, Jr. in 1968
while he was a summer student at
Stanford, is about a fictitious
world in which men and women
are bitter enemies and live in
seperate countries. They meet
only once every four years for
Olympic Games to decide which
will be supreme, and to mate for
reasons of survival.
Kaufman got his idea for the
film at Yale where he found the
male-female relationship
"somewhat artificial." Although I
haven't seen the film, judging
from its successful reception at
Yale and other Eastern campuses,
it might really be worth seeing.
Sunday Flicks
The Sunday Flicks offers
"Pretty Poison" with Tuesday
Weld and Anthony Perkins at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
Pollution, sabotage, murder, and
baton twirling are all elements of
"Pretty Poison," considered by
many critics to be an excellent
film. Weld and Perkins are cast in
roles they know best; emotionally
disturbed teenagers. The
screenplay was written by
Lorenzo Temple who was also
responsible for that American
television classic, "Batman."

Chinese film, and a movie
filmed on the Stanford campus
are included in Saturday's and
Sunday's programs.
Saturday at Tresidder,
Wiseman's "High School" and
Beckett's "Film" will be screened
at 7, 8, and 9. Wiseman, famous
for his revealing documentaries
"Titicut Follies" and "Hospital,"
chose the students and faculty of
Northeast High School in
Philadelphia as an example of
secondary education in America.
High School
Northeast has all the elements
necessary for a well-rounded
repressive education. The
ex-Marine turned counselor, the
fat old English teacher who reads
"Casey at the Bat" to her high
school students, and the local
doctor who tells stupid jokes
while giving an auditorium full of
boys a lecture on sex are all stars
of this tragedy.
Aware of the presence of
Wiseman's camera, everyone
apparently thought they were
projecting a good, positive image.
Instead, they were being ridiculed
and laughed at. The result of this
"education" is students
exemplified by the one who
apologetically says to her teacher,
"I didn't mean to be
individualistic."
Beckett's "Film" is also being
shown on the same program.
Buster Keaton stars in this
one-character drama without

dialogue, that explores Beckett's
characteristic theme of
hopelessness in modern life.
Chinese Film
Sunday at 2:30 in Memorial
Auditorium, the Chinese Students
Association will present "Come
Drink WiLh Me," starring Cheng
Pei Pei and Yudh Hua. This action
Hick from Hong Kong features an
accomplished swordswoman and a
"Drunken Beggar" who can kill
without touching the victim,
maim without drawing blood, and
knock down his opponents with a
pair of chopsticks. Considered to
be the best sword-fighting film of
1966...
Premiere
The West Coast Premiere of
"The Girl Who Returned," filmed
on the Stanford campus, will be
shown at 7 and 9 in Cubberly.
This feature length comedy, made
by Stanley Kaufman, Jr. in 1968
while he was a summer student at
Stanford, is about a fictitious
world in which men and women
are bitter enemies and live in
seperate countries. They meet
only once every four years for
Olympic Games to decide which
will be supreme, and to mate for
reasons of survival.
Kaufman got his idea for the
film at Yale where he found the
male-female relationship
"somewhat artificial." Although I
haven't seen the film, judging
from its successful reception at
Yale and other Eastern campuses,
it might really be worth seeing.
Sunday Flicks
The Sunday Flicks offers
"Pretty Poison" with Tuesday
Weld and Anthony Perkins at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
Pollution, sabotage, murder, and
baton twirling are all elements of
"Pretty Poison," considered by
many critics to be an excellent
film. Weld and Perkins are cast in
roles they know best; emotionally
disturbed teenagers. The
screenplay was written by
Lorenzo Temple who was also
responsible for that American
television classic, "Batman."
Tinsel Town did it again, but
this time with a little more style
and organization. Wednesday
night, April 7, the Academy
Awards Variety Hour presented
"Hollywood Stars Then and
Now."
Part I featured Fred Astaire,
Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, and
John Wayne. Part 11, "Up and
Coming Has Beens" starred
Katharine Ross, Ali McGraw, Jon
Voight, and Elliot Gould.
For forty-one years the
Academy of Arts and Sciences
took itself too seriously. The
presentation of the Golden God
was always boring, too long and
apparently so meaningless that
most actors and actresses didn't
even bother to attend. Hollywood
was losing money and face, but
failed to recognize the facts.
Revolution
However, for the past two
years something like a revolution
started changing things.
Independent productions and
"Youth Oriented Films" started
to fill the coffers once again. In
1969 the change was quite
apparent as reflected in the films
nominated by the Academy for
Best .
The selection of Best Anything
is ludicrous in itself, but if it has
to be done to help inflate a few
egos, it might as well be done with
a little more style than The Ed
Sullivan Show.
The producers of this years
Academy Awards must have
caught an acute case of
creativeness, because surprisingly
enough, they sought to change
frequencies after forty-one years
of reruns. The program included
film clips of directors David Lean,
Kurosawa, Bergman, Wilder,
Schlesinger, Fellini, and Nichols,
offering words on how they
became directors and what they
think about censorship. But what
is most interesting is the fact that
only one out of all those
legendary directors had a picture

nominated for an Academy
Award.
Cooperation
All the sick jokes were kept at
a minimum and it seemed that a
few of the song and dance
numbers had actually been
rehearsed. However, after each
winner picked up his/her reward,
he/she had to thank everyone and
his grandmother for the moment.
But then, the cinema is a
cooperative medium.
Still, it was great seeing the
Stars as they really are, in real life.
Someone did a great job of
persuading most everyone,
including Elizabeth Taylor, to
attend. (Could it have been the
opportunity to show America her
assets, including a $1,050,000
diamond?)

years something like a revolution
started changing things.
Independent productions and
"Youth Oriented Films" started
to fill the coffers once again. In
1969 the change was quite
apparent as reflected in the films
nominated by the Academy for
Best .
The selection of Best Anything
is ludicrous in itself, but if it has
to be done to help inflate a few
egos, it might as well be done with
a little more style than The Ed
Sullivan Show.
The producers of this years
Academy Awards must have
caught an acute case of
creativeness, because surprisingly
enough, they sought to change
frequencies after forty-one years
of reruns. The program included
film clips of directors David Lean,
Kurosawa, Bergman, Wilder,
Schlesinger, Fellini, and Nichols,
offering words on how they
became directors and what they
think about censorship. But what
is most interesting is the fact that
only one out of all those
legendary directors had a picture

nominated for an Academy
Award.
Cooperation
All the sick jokes were kept at
a minimum and it seemed that a
few of the song and dance
numbers had actually been
rehearsed. However, after each
winner picked up his/her reward,
he/she had to thank everyone and
his grandmother for the moment.
But then, the cinema is a
cooperative medium.
Still, it was great seeing the
Stars as they really are, in real life.
Someone did a great job of
persuading most everyone,
including Elizabeth Taylor, to
attend. (Could it have been the
opportunity to show America her
assets, including a $1,050,000
diamond?)

Weekend
Flicks

Five potentially entertaining
films will be shown on campus
this weekend. A documentary, a

Chinese film, and a movie
filmed on the Stanford campus
are included in Saturday's and
Sunday's programs.
Saturday at Tresidder,
Wiseman's "High School" and
Beckett's "Film" will be screened
at 7, 8, and 9. Wiseman, famous
for his revealing documentaries
"Titicut Follies" and "Hospital,"
chose the students and faculty of
Northeast High School in
Philadelphia as an example of
secondary education in America.
High School
Northeast has all the elements
necessary for a well-rounded
repressive education. The
ex-Marine turned counselor, the
fat old English teacher who reads
"Casey at the Bat" to her high
school students, and the local
doctor who tells stupid jokes
while giving an auditorium full of
boys a lecture on sex are all stars
of this tragedy.
Aware of the presence of
Wiseman's camera, everyone
apparently thought they were
projecting a good, positive image.
Instead, they were being ridiculed
and laughed at. The result of this
"education" is students
exemplified by the one who
apologetically says to her teacher,
"I didn't mean to be
individualistic."
Beckett's "Film" is also being
shown on the same program.
Buster Keaton stars in this
one-character drama without

dialogue, that explores Beckett's
characteristic theme of
hopelessness in modern life.
Chinese Film
Sunday at 2:30 in Memorial
Auditorium, the Chinese Students
Association will present "Come
Drink WiLh Me," starring Cheng
Pei Pei and Yudh Hua. This action
Hick from Hong Kong features an
accomplished swordswoman and a
"Drunken Beggar" who can kill
without touching the victim,
maim without drawing blood, and
knock down his opponents with a
pair of chopsticks. Considered to
be the best sword-fighting film of
1966...
Premiere
The West Coast Premiere of
"The Girl Who Returned," filmed
on the Stanford campus, will be
shown at 7 and 9 in Cubberly.
This feature length comedy, made
by Stanley Kaufman, Jr. in 1968
while he was a summer student at
Stanford, is about a fictitious
world in which men and women
are bitter enemies and live in
seperate countries. They meet
only once every four years for
Olympic Games to decide which
will be supreme, and to mate for
reasons of survival.
Kaufman got his idea for the
film at Yale where he found the
male-female relationship
"somewhat artificial." Although I
haven't seen the film, judging
from its successful reception at
Yale and other Eastern campuses,
it might really be worth seeing.
Sunday Flicks
The Sunday Flicks offers
"Pretty Poison" with Tuesday
Weld and Anthony Perkins at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
Pollution, sabotage, murder, and
baton twirling are all elements of
"Pretty Poison," considered by
many critics to be an excellent
film. Weld and Perkins are cast in
roles they know best; emotionally
disturbed teenagers. The
screenplay was written by
Lorenzo Temple who was also
responsible for that American
television classic, "Batman."
Tinsel Town did it again, but
this time with a little more style
and organization. Wednesday
night, April 7, the Academy
Awards Variety Hour presented
"Hollywood Stars Then and
Now."
Part I featured Fred Astaire,
Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, and
John Wayne. Part 11, "Up and
Coming Has Beens" starred
Katharine Ross, Ali McGraw, Jon
Voight, and Elliot Gould.
For forty-one years the
Academy of Arts and Sciences
took itself too seriously. The
presentation of the Golden God
was always boring, too long and
apparently so meaningless that
most actors and actresses didn't
even bother to attend. Hollywood
was losing money and face, but
failed to recognize the facts.

Wiseman's camera, everyone
apparently thought they were
projecting a good, positive image.
Instead, they were being ridiculed
and laughed at. The result of this
"education" is students
exemplified by the one who
apologetically says to her teacher,
"I didn't mean to be
individualistic."
Beckett's "Film" is also being
shown on the same program.
Buster Keaton stars in this
one-character drama without

dialogue, that explores Beckett's
characteristic theme of
hopelessness in modern life.
Chinese Film
Sunday at 2:30 in Memorial
Auditorium, the Chinese Students
Association will present "Come
Drink WiLh Me," starring Cheng
Pei Pei and Yudh Hua. This action
Hick from Hong Kong features an
accomplished swordswoman and a
"Drunken Beggar" who can kill
without touching the victim,
maim without drawing blood, and
knock down his opponents with a
pair of chopsticks. Considered to
be the best sword-fighting film of
1966...
Premiere
The West Coast Premiere of
"The Girl Who Returned," filmed
on the Stanford campus, will be
shown at 7 and 9 in Cubberly.
This feature length comedy, made
by Stanley Kaufman, Jr. in 1968
while he was a summer student at
Stanford, is about a fictitious
world in which men and women
are bitter enemies and live in
seperate countries. They meet
only once every four years for
Olympic Games to decide which
will be supreme, and to mate for
reasons of survival.
Kaufman got his idea for the
film at Yale where he found the
male-female relationship
"somewhat artificial." Although I
haven't seen the film, judging
from its successful reception at
Yale and other Eastern campuses,
it might really be worth seeing.
Sunday Flicks
The Sunday Flicks offers
"Pretty Poison" with Tuesday
Weld and Anthony Perkins at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
Pollution, sabotage, murder, and
baton twirling are all elements of
"Pretty Poison," considered by
many critics to be an excellent
film. Weld and Perkins are cast in
roles they know best; emotionally
disturbed teenagers. The
screenplay was written by
Lorenzo Temple who was also
responsible for that American
television classic, "Batman."
