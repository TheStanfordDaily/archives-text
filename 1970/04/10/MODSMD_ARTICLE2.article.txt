### 
The Board of Trustees will
meet next Monday and Tuesday
in its regularly scheduled monthly
meeting.
Committee meetings start
Monday with the Investment
Committee gathering at noon in
the Faculty Club. All other
committee meetings follow in the
afternoon in room 74 of the
Graduate School of Business.
Tuesday the entire board will
meet at 9 a.m. in room gsb 74.
Items expected to be included
on the agenda include: a proposal
that Stanford vote its more than
21,000 shares of General Motors
stock in favor of Ralph Nader
consumer interest proposals; an

amendment to leases of private
social clubs on Stanford land that
would allow them to sell liquor;
and a discussion of a requirement
by the state of Pennsylvania that
Stanford supply the names of
students involved in campus
disorders and convicted of
misdemeanors that have
scholarships sponsored by
Pennsylvania.
On January 14, 1969, about 50
students physically disrupted a
Trustees' meeting protesting the
University involvement with the
defense department and the
Vietnam War. The disruption was
the beginning of a series of events
that led up to the April 3rd
Movement.
