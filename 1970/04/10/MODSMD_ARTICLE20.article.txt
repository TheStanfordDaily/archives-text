# In World Premiere
## 'Drums' Proves Remarkable 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
"Drums of Snow" is a kind of historical
pageant play written by a gentleman named David
Pinner. It had its world premiere Wednesday night
in Little Theater, of all places. It's a good play,
and it's a good production, and I would advise you
to buy. your tickets now, because when the wbrd
gets out about this one, it's going to be a sell-out.
I guess the most impressive thing about this
production is the script. "Drums of Snow" is
about the Puritan Revolution which was
responsible for the overthrow and execution of
King Charles I and the ascension of Oliver
Cromwell in seventeenth century England (an
event which resulted in, among other things, the
banning of live theater for two decades).
Su btlc
It is so wonderful to see a play about war and
po'litics which does not try to ram its message
down your throat. There are obvious parallels
between the events (and perhaps even the
characters) of "Drums of Snow" and the world of
1970, but Mr. Pinner lets you make the
connections yourself. He is too busy creating
characters and situations to waste his time with
the crude and condescending propaganda which
seems to be so important to some modern artists.
He has written a loosely constructed play with
tightly constructed scenes that create tension and
interest in their. unfolding. He has managed to
create a feeling of history playing itself out before
you, with a cast of characters whose size and
complexity are reminiscent of Russian novels.
And yet, our interest is focused on half a dozen
characters whose personalities become more and
more real as the play progresses. I think that Mr.
Pinner has given us a fine play, a complex, funny,
and beautiful play, and I hope that it passes on to
bigger forums than Stanford University.
Quality Production
The quality of the production itself does the

play, and SRT,credit. John Chioles' direction is
generally very good, although at times 1 was a bit
bothered by the looseness. Also, I had trouble
remembering who was who (the Russian novel
effect), especially at the beginning. In any case it
wasn't very important.
There was a certain amount of gimickry in the
production, most of which worked, some of which
didn't. One of Mr. Pinner's intentions (apparantly)
was to point out the ghastly, gallows humor
absurdity of war, the church and the governmental
process, and of course Mr. Chioles did his best to
incorporate these ideas in his production. Having a
young lady named Hope Alexander Willis trapped
in a cage over the stage, presumably representing
the English People, seemed to work; some of the
sillier scenes in Parliament did not.
Acting Excellent
Some of the acting is excellent. Andros
Thomson is superb as Charles I. I cannot imagine
how he could be better. The characterization had a
quality and complexity that one associates with
the work of the finer Shakespearian actors, and it
set the standard for the rest of the cast.
Gene Engene is also excellent as Oliver
Cromwell, "the Beast," "Ironsides," the political
enemy of Charles, the man who on the strength of
his character rises from obscurity to the leadership
of the Puritans, and eventually of England.
Terry J. Hinz played the part of John Lilburne,
who seemed to represent in this play the more
vocal and self-aware element of Common English
society. Mr. Hinz played the role with a dash and
impertinence which made him fun to watch. My
only objection was that his voice wasn't quite up
to some of the a capella singing he was asked to
do. This is a general fault with the whole
companyâ€”only Miss Willis, in her seventeenth
century go-go cage above the stage, was
consistently in good voice throughout the show
(she is listed as "The Voice" in the program.)
