# Five To 70 Thousand Involved
## Problems Faced By Canadian 'Immigrants' 
### JOHN SLOAN 
(Editor's note This is the first
article in a two part series on
American s who have fled to
Canada to escape the draft.)
Depending on whom you
believe there are somewhere
between five and 70 thousand
Americans who have i'led to
Canada to escape the draft. It
doesn't really matter how many
people have left the country. The
fact is that a great number have
and are now leaving legally, or
illegally in either Canada or
Sweden, the two major draft
havens.
In Vancouver the main
clearing-house for Americans
coming to Canada is the
"Committee To Aid American
War Objectors." Their office is
located in the ground floor of
something which looks like it used
to be a warehouse. Decorations
are mostly posters from past
peace marches and a few hand
made leather goods. In the back a
typewriter occasionally bangs
while the telephone rings

constantly. Usually there are at
least half a dozen guys and
perhaps a girl waiting around for
information on help.
Pete, a tall red-bearded person
with a very sincere face and a soft
voice presently runs the
committee. From the moment
you meet him you feel that he is
someone to trust and who will tell
it to you exactly like it is.
According to him there are
presently aroung 15,000 draft
dodgers and deserters in
Vancouver alone, and they are
receiving new people at the rate of
25 to 40 a week, half of whom are
deserters.
The first problem which faces
Americans who enter Canada is to
obtain landed immigrant status. It
is legally impossible to obtain a
job unless you have been accepted
as a landed immigrant. Anybody
can get a visitors visa, but it is
only good for six months, during
which time you cannot work. And
if you apply for a visitors visa first
you may have trouble obtaining
your landed immigrant status
later.

The Canadian regulations for
landed immigrant status work on
the system of points where you
must compile at least fifty points
in such areas as education, job
skills, ability to speak English and
French, appearance, etc.
Recently there have been a series
of ads in local campus and
underground papers for girls
willing to marry men solely in
order that they can get 20 points
towards status.
After becoming a landed
immigrant; the next major
obstacle is finding a job. This is
tough, both for Canadians and
Americans. To help people get by
for the first little while the
committee runs two hostels for
housing purposes.
Job discrimination does not
seem to exist on the part of
Canadian employers. It mainly
comes from companies which are
American owned, (and there are a
lot of them), but very few people
have found themselves being
turned down solelv for being a

draft dodger. In fact there art"
cases where it has even helped.
As far as continuing one's
education, it is quite hard for an
undergraduate in the west to get
into a university. Supposedly it is
easier in the east. Post-graduate
work is not too difficult to
obtain.
The official Canadian
government policy on Americans
coming to Canada to escape the
draft is that if they can make
landed immigrant status they are
•welcome. Canada has no draft and
in five years you can get Canadian
citizenship. A short time ago there
was a case in which the RCMP
(Royal Canadian Mounted Police)
picked up three American
deserters, took them to the
boarder and handed them over to
the FBI. One of the three
managed to escape and return to
Canada. When the story broke
there was an uproar which
reached all the way to the
Canadian parliament.
Presently, there is an
investigation under way to
determine if the RCMP
overstepped its authority.
However, acts such as this are not
official policy. And according to
Pete, although similar incidents
used to happen often a few years
ago, they don't go on any more.
Rather, there is a problem
persond prejudices.

When asked how Americans
reacted to Canada, Pete said that
at least for the first while they
feel alienated and generally have a
tough time. The ones who have
the most trouble are the deserters
because they usually have less
education and little money. They
are most severely hit by the cronic
lack of jobs.
Parental reaction differs
widely. There is an increasing
number of parents who more
whole families to Canada as the
drall looms closer. However, they
are obviously a minority. About
twenty percent of the parents are
sympathetic when their son moves
to Canada, about sixty percent
disagreewhile another twenty
percent write their sons off as
cowards and in some cases,
disown them.
There is a difference between
Canada and the U.S. Canada is a
huge country with a very small
population. It is obviously
Americanized, but it is not
America. And how do Americans
react to the difference? Pete
probably spoke for a lot of people
when he said, "if the war ended
today and amnesty was declared,
most of those who have been here
under six months or else are
highly political would return to
the U.S. But those who have been
here over six months would
probably stay."

and are now leaving legally, or
illegally in either Canada or
Sweden, the two major draft
havens.
In Vancouver the main
clearing-house for Americans
coming to Canada is the
"Committee To Aid American
War Objectors." Their office is
located in the ground floor of
something which looks like it used
to be a warehouse. Decorations
are mostly posters from past
peace marches and a few hand
made leather goods. In the back a
typewriter occasionally bangs
while the telephone rings

constantly. Usually there are at
least half a dozen guys and
perhaps a girl waiting around for
information on help.
Pete, a tall red-bearded person
with a very sincere face and a soft
voice presently runs the
committee. From the moment
you meet him you feel that he is
someone to trust and who will tell
it to you exactly like it is.
According to him there are
presently aroung 15,000 draft
dodgers and deserters in
Vancouver alone, and they are
receiving new people at the rate of
25 to 40 a week, half of whom are
deserters.
The first problem which faces
Americans who enter Canada is to
obtain landed immigrant status. It
is legally impossible to obtain a
job unless you have been accepted
as a landed immigrant. Anybody
can get a visitors visa, but it is
only good for six months, during
which time you cannot work. And
if you apply for a visitors visa first
you may have trouble obtaining
your landed immigrant status
later.

The Canadian regulations for
landed immigrant status work on
the system of points where you
must compile at least fifty points
in such areas as education, job
skills, ability to speak English and
French, appearance, etc.
Recently there have been a series
of ads in local campus and
underground papers for girls
willing to marry men solely in
order that they can get 20 points
towards status.
After becoming a landed
immigrant; the next major
obstacle is finding a job. This is
tough, both for Canadians and
Americans. To help people get by
for the first little while the
committee runs two hostels for
housing purposes.
Job discrimination does not
seem to exist on the part of
Canadian employers. It mainly
comes from companies which are
American owned, (and there are a
lot of them), but very few people
have found themselves being
turned down solelv for being a

draft dodger. In fact there art"
cases where it has even helped.
As far as continuing one's
education, it is quite hard for an
undergraduate in the west to get
into a university. Supposedly it is
easier in the east. Post-graduate
work is not too difficult to
obtain.
The official Canadian
government policy on Americans
coming to Canada to escape the
draft is that if they can make
landed immigrant status they are
•welcome. Canada has no draft and
in five years you can get Canadian
citizenship. A short time ago there
was a case in which the RCMP
(Royal Canadian Mounted Police)
picked up three American
deserters, took them to the
boarder and handed them over to
the FBI. One of the three
managed to escape and return to
Canada. When the story broke
there was an uproar which
reached all the way to the
Canadian parliament.
Presently, there is an
investigation under way to
determine if the RCMP
overstepped its authority.
However, acts such as this are not
official policy. And according to
Pete, although similar incidents
used to happen often a few years
ago, they don't go on any more.
Rather, there is a problem
persond prejudices.

When asked how Americans
reacted to Canada, Pete said that
at least for the first while they
feel alienated and generally have a
tough time. The ones who have
the most trouble are the deserters
because they usually have less
education and little money. They
are most severely hit by the cronic
lack of jobs.
Parental reaction differs
widely. There is an increasing
number of parents who more
whole families to Canada as the
drall looms closer. However, they
are obviously a minority. About
twenty percent of the parents are
sympathetic when their son moves
to Canada, about sixty percent
disagreewhile another twenty
percent write their sons off as
cowards and in some cases,
disown them.
There is a difference between
Canada and the U.S. Canada is a
huge country with a very small
population. It is obviously
Americanized, but it is not
America. And how do Americans
react to the difference? Pete
probably spoke for a lot of people
when he said, "if the war ended
today and amnesty was declared,
most of those who have been here
under six months or else are
highly political would return to
the U.S. But those who have been
here over six months would
probably stay."
(Editor's note This is the first
article in a two part series on
American s who have fled to
Canada to escape the draft.)
Depending on whom you
believe there are somewhere
between five and 70 thousand
Americans who have i'led to
Canada to escape the draft. It
doesn't really matter how many
people have left the country. The
fact is that a great number have

typewriter occasionally bangs
while the telephone rings

constantly. Usually there are at
least half a dozen guys and
perhaps a girl waiting around for
information on help.
Pete, a tall red-bearded person
with a very sincere face and a soft
voice presently runs the
committee. From the moment
you meet him you feel that he is
someone to trust and who will tell
it to you exactly like it is.
According to him there are
presently aroung 15,000 draft
dodgers and deserters in
Vancouver alone, and they are
receiving new people at the rate of
25 to 40 a week, half of whom are
deserters.
The first problem which faces
Americans who enter Canada is to
obtain landed immigrant status. It
is legally impossible to obtain a
job unless you have been accepted
as a landed immigrant. Anybody
can get a visitors visa, but it is
only good for six months, during
which time you cannot work. And
if you apply for a visitors visa first
you may have trouble obtaining
your landed immigrant status
later.

The Canadian regulations for
landed immigrant status work on
the system of points where you
must compile at least fifty points
in such areas as education, job
skills, ability to speak English and
French, appearance, etc.
Recently there have been a series
of ads in local campus and
underground papers for girls
willing to marry men solely in
order that they can get 20 points
towards status.
After becoming a landed
immigrant; the next major
obstacle is finding a job. This is
tough, both for Canadians and
Americans. To help people get by
for the first little while the
committee runs two hostels for
housing purposes.
Job discrimination does not
seem to exist on the part of
Canadian employers. It mainly
comes from companies which are
American owned, (and there are a
lot of them), but very few people
have found themselves being
turned down solelv for being a

draft dodger. In fact there art"
cases where it has even helped.
As far as continuing one's
education, it is quite hard for an
undergraduate in the west to get
into a university. Supposedly it is
easier in the east. Post-graduate
work is not too difficult to
obtain.
The official Canadian
government policy on Americans
coming to Canada to escape the
draft is that if they can make
landed immigrant status they are
•welcome. Canada has no draft and
in five years you can get Canadian
citizenship. A short time ago there
was a case in which the RCMP
(Royal Canadian Mounted Police)
picked up three American
deserters, took them to the
boarder and handed them over to
the FBI. One of the three
managed to escape and return to
Canada. When the story broke
there was an uproar which
reached all the way to the
Canadian parliament.
Presently, there is an
investigation under way to
determine if the RCMP
overstepped its authority.
However, acts such as this are not
official policy. And according to
Pete, although similar incidents
used to happen often a few years
ago, they don't go on any more.
Rather, there is a problem
persond prejudices.

When asked how Americans
reacted to Canada, Pete said that
at least for the first while they
feel alienated and generally have a
tough time. The ones who have
the most trouble are the deserters
because they usually have less
education and little money. They
are most severely hit by the cronic
lack of jobs.
Parental reaction differs
widely. There is an increasing
number of parents who more
whole families to Canada as the
drall looms closer. However, they
are obviously a minority. About
twenty percent of the parents are
sympathetic when their son moves
to Canada, about sixty percent
disagreewhile another twenty
percent write their sons off as
cowards and in some cases,
disown them.
There is a difference between
Canada and the U.S. Canada is a
huge country with a very small
population. It is obviously
Americanized, but it is not
America. And how do Americans
react to the difference? Pete
probably spoke for a lot of people
when he said, "if the war ended
today and amnesty was declared,
most of those who have been here
under six months or else are
highly political would return to
the U.S. But those who have been
here over six months would
probably stay."
(Editor's note This is the first
article in a two part series on
American s who have fled to
Canada to escape the draft.)
Depending on whom you
believe there are somewhere
between five and 70 thousand
Americans who have i'led to
Canada to escape the draft. It
doesn't really matter how many
people have left the country. The
fact is that a great number have
and are now leaving legally, or
illegally in either Canada or
Sweden, the two major draft
havens.
In Vancouver the main
clearing-house for Americans
coming to Canada is the
"Committee To Aid American
War Objectors." Their office is
located in the ground floor of
something which looks like it used
to be a warehouse. Decorations
are mostly posters from past
peace marches and a few hand
made leather goods. In the back a
typewriter occasionally bangs
while the telephone rings

constantly. Usually there are at
least half a dozen guys and
perhaps a girl waiting around for
information on help.
