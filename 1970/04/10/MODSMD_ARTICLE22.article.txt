# Radio Interference
## KZSU 'Harassed' By Police 
### 
For the first time in the
campus station's history, KZSU
has had two of its reporters

harassed by police officers during
the recent ROTC demonstrations.
The harassment has not
amounted to outright arrest yet.
Student newsmen for KZSU have
complained that law officers have
"threatened" them with detention
in the police compound.
Reporters covering the
movements of police forces on
campus have been told by officers
that the newsmen "were coming
pretty close to obstructing
justice."
KZSU staffers stationed near
the police compound during the
disturbances had also
encountered some type of radio
interference on their
walkie-talkies. During this period,
police communications runs with
broadcasting antennae were
evident.
The radio station uses
walkie-talkies on channel 11 of
the citizens' band to report to the
station. Newsmen there maintain
that it is common practice of the
police to monitor all broadcasts
on channel 11.
During last week, there were
several incidents involving radio
reporters and the local law forces.
In one, a reporter stationed across
the street from the police
compound broadcasting reports
was frisked by officers who
noticed his activity.
Recent Incidents
Last Friday night, in the same
location, a KZSU staffer reporting
the size and movement of local
officers and Santa Clara County
Sheriff's officers was "asked" to
accompany three policemen into
the compound. He was advised
not to make further reports on his
walker-talker. The student passed
his walkie-talkie to another staffer
who continued to make reports
from the Manzanita Park area.
This newscaster had three
contentions regarding these
incidents. First, that it is not
illegal to make such reports of the
activity of law enforcement
officials on campus. Second, that

KZSU reports the movements of
both the police and the
demonstrators. The reporter, who
asked not to be identified, said
that the police use the KZSU
reports of the demonstrators' path
and size. Police in the crowd with
walkie-talkies would obviously
not be feasible. Third, that no
policeman ever told the reporters
to "desist" their reports. The
officers try to make their point by
veiled threats, not actual charges.
The news reporters at the radio
station are considering discussing
with the police departments
exactly what the reporters' rights
are. In the meantime, the station
has been in contact with a
University lawyer to advise them
of the legal aspects of the
problem.

that the police use the KZSU
reports of the demonstrators' path
and size. Police in the crowd with
walkie-talkies would obviously
not be feasible. Third, that no
policeman ever told the reporters
to "desist" their reports. The
officers try to make their point by
veiled threats, not actual charges.
The news reporters at the radio
station are considering discussing
with the police departments
exactly what the reporters' rights
are. In the meantime, the station
has been in contact with a
University lawyer to advise them
of the legal aspects of the
problem.
For the first time in the
campus station's history, KZSU
has had two of its reporters

harassed by police officers during
the recent ROTC demonstrations.
The harassment has not
amounted to outright arrest yet.
Student newsmen for KZSU have
complained that law officers have
"threatened" them with detention
in the police compound.
Reporters covering the
movements of police forces on
campus have been told by officers
that the newsmen "were coming
pretty close to obstructing
justice."
KZSU staffers stationed near
the police compound during the
disturbances had also
encountered some type of radio
interference on their
walkie-talkies. During this period,
police communications runs with
broadcasting antennae were
evident.
The radio station uses
walkie-talkies on channel 11 of
the citizens' band to report to the
station. Newsmen there maintain
that it is common practice of the
police to monitor all broadcasts
on channel 11.
During last week, there were
several incidents involving radio
reporters and the local law forces.
In one, a reporter stationed across
the street from the police
compound broadcasting reports
was frisked by officers who
noticed his activity.
Recent Incidents
Last Friday night, in the same
location, a KZSU staffer reporting
the size and movement of local
officers and Santa Clara County
Sheriff's officers was "asked" to
accompany three policemen into
the compound. He was advised
not to make further reports on his
walker-talker. The student passed
his walkie-talkie to another staffer
who continued to make reports
from the Manzanita Park area.
This newscaster had three
contentions regarding these
incidents. First, that it is not
illegal to make such reports of the
activity of law enforcement
officials on campus. Second, that

KZSU reports the movements of
both the police and the
demonstrators. The reporter, who
asked not to be identified, said
that the police use the KZSU
reports of the demonstrators' path
and size. Police in the crowd with
walkie-talkies would obviously
not be feasible. Third, that no
policeman ever told the reporters
to "desist" their reports. The
officers try to make their point by
veiled threats, not actual charges.
The news reporters at the radio
station are considering discussing
with the police departments
exactly what the reporters' rights
are. In the meantime, the station
has been in contact with a

of the legal aspects of the
problem.
