# Spring Festival Continues
## The 						New Theater 
### ANNE EGGEBROTEN 
TNT (The New Theater) will explode in
Memorial Church this Sunday at 8 p.m. with
"dramatic snatches celebrating the human
condition."
Gerald Hiken and Paul E. Richards are the
two-man traveling theater known as TNT, in their
own words, "the whole acting company, design
staff, promotion department and
playwrigh ts-in-residence."
The pair worked with the Stanford Repertory
Theater for three years, leaving in 1968 to create
their own theater.
Hiken and Richards are out to destroy the wall
between the audience and the actors - they think
the audience should be a part of what's going on.
Anywhere And Everywhere
To get this across, TNT performs everywhere
from living rooms to mountain tops to actual
theaters, but always without a raised stage, sets
and special lighting. A few chairs, a ladder and a
screen for backdrop are virtually the only props.
Wearing street clothes, they keep up a running
conversation with the audience during
performance.
Hiken and Richards will do their thing on the
steps and floor in the front of the church. Just
what their thing will be no one will know until it
happens.
I'ollti ck
Chances are it will include "The Mirror,"
reflections on theater and life by Sh.kespeare,
Chekhov ("Swan Song" and"The Sea Gull"), and
Brecht with footnotes by Holub ("Polonius"),
Sartre ("Kean"), Sandburg, Thurber ("The Mac
Beth Murder Mystery") and others

A short play by Richards, "If Lost, Please
Return To. . is also likely to be performed.
Richards and Hiken play two dogs, Fearless, a
mongrel, and Charlene, a prize poodle whom
Fearless tries to seduce. When Fearless dies on
Junipero Serra, Charlene bays over him and gives
him her rhinestone collar.
Sketches by Harold Pinter, "Trouble in the
Works" and "Interview," are another possibility.
Spring Festival
TNT is the second feature of the Spring Festival
sponsored by Memorial Church during the month
of April on Sunday nights. The next events will be
the Voices of Joy on April 19 with "a happy
gospel concert by young voices" and Aquarius
Rising with "dance experiments in ceremonial
joy" on April 26.
Before coming to Stanford, Hiken & Richards
were members of the Actors Studio in New York,
appearing in over thirty productions on and
off-Broadway and in hundreds of TV plays and
films.
"Big theater alienates the audience from the
actors," Richards maintains. "It is really a
spectacle where you, the audience, come to look
at me, the actor. Spectacles are all right for
big-time musicals, but otherwise theater should be
an interchange."
Summary
TNT has played in the past few months at the
Presentation Theatre in San Francisco and at the
Hill barn Theater in Foster City.
Coffee will be served afterward in the Round
Room of Memorial Church for those who want to
talk with Hiken and Richards after the
performance.

performance.
TNT (The New Theater) will explode in
Memorial Church this Sunday at 8 p.m. with
"dramatic snatches celebrating the human
condition."
Gerald Hiken and Paul E. Richards are the
two-man traveling theater known as TNT, in their
own words, "the whole acting company, design
staff, promotion department and
playwrigh ts-in-residence."
The pair worked with the Stanford Repertory
Theater for three years, leaving in 1968 to create
their own theater.
Hiken and Richards are out to destroy the wall
between the audience and the actors - they think
the audience should be a part of what's going on.
Anywhere And Everywhere
To get this across, TNT performs everywhere
from living rooms to mountain tops to actual
theaters, but always without a raised stage, sets
and special lighting. A few chairs, a ladder and a
screen for backdrop are virtually the only props.
Wearing street clothes, they keep up a running
conversation with the audience during
performance.
Hiken and Richards will do their thing on the
steps and floor in the front of the church. Just
what their thing will be no one will know until it
happens.
I'ollti ck
Chances are it will include "The Mirror,"
reflections on theater and life by Sh.kespeare,
Chekhov ("Swan Song" and"The Sea Gull"), and
Brecht with footnotes by Holub ("Polonius"),
Sartre ("Kean"), Sandburg, Thurber ("The Mac
Beth Murder Mystery") and others

A short play by Richards, "If Lost, Please
Return To. . is also likely to be performed.
Richards and Hiken play two dogs, Fearless, a
mongrel, and Charlene, a prize poodle whom
Fearless tries to seduce. When Fearless dies on
Junipero Serra, Charlene bays over him and gives
him her rhinestone collar.
Sketches by Harold Pinter, "Trouble in the
Works" and "Interview," are another possibility.
Spring Festival
TNT is the second feature of the Spring Festival
sponsored by Memorial Church during the month
of April on Sunday nights. The next events will be
the Voices of Joy on April 19 with "a happy
gospel concert by young voices" and Aquarius
Rising with "dance experiments in ceremonial
joy" on April 26.
Before coming to Stanford, Hiken & Richards
were members of the Actors Studio in New York,
appearing in over thirty productions on and
off-Broadway and in hundreds of TV plays and
films.
"Big theater alienates the audience from the
actors," Richards maintains. "It is really a
spectacle where you, the audience, come to look
at me, the actor. Spectacles are all right for
big-time musicals, but otherwise theater should be
an interchange."
Summary
TNT has played in the past few months at the
Presentation Theatre in San Francisco and at the
Hill barn Theater in Foster City.
Coffee will be served afterward in the Round
Room of Memorial Church for those who want to
talk with Hiken and Richards after the
performance.
