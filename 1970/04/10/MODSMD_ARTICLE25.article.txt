application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any fine
when in the Dean's judgment it
appears necessary to avoid undue
financial hardship. In no event,
however, shall a university degree
be awarded to any defendant
until he has paid the full amount
due.

pay as ordered shall be treated as
if he had been suspended and
shall be subject to all the
disabilities of Section 3 until
such time as he does pay.

losses of any individual or
organization which losses were
directly caused by the offense
for which the fine is imposed.

on-campus facility or organization
a. 1. Prior to the imposition of such
a penalty, the SJC shall inquire
of the defendant whether or not
he has any objection in principle
to penalties requiring involuntary
imposition of work. If so, an
alternative penalty shall be
imposed.

degree from the University prior
to successful completion of any
work fine imposed upon him.

conditioned as follows: The
Dean of Students shall upon
application by a defendant
postpone the time that the-work
must be completed when, in the
Dean's judgment, it appears
necessary to avoid undue
hardship. In no event, however,
shall a University degree be
awarded to any defendant until
he has successfully completed
the work.
3. A student who has failed to
meet a deadline shall thereupon
be treated as if he had been
suspended and shall be subject to
all the disabilities of Section 3
until such time as he does
satisfactorily complete the work.

preliminary consideration of the
proposed Penalty Code beyond this
point in the text.)
6. Loss of Rights and Privileges
a. 1. Whenever a student is deprived
of a right or privilege, both the
specific right or privilege lost and
the period of such loss must be
stated in writing.

may be deprived of such rights and
privileges as living in University
housing, using University
machinery, driving a motor vehicle
on campus, etc.; but such penalty
may be imposed only when the
offense of which the student has
been found guilty constituted an
abuse of the right or privilege to be
taken away.
7. Probation
a. Probation is the imposition and
the setting aside of a penalty
suspending the student from the
University on terms, a violation of
which automatically results in the
reinstatement of the suspension.
b. 1. A violation shall consist of the
commission of any subsequent
offense during the period of the
probation, unless the judicial
body hearing said subsequent
offense specifically deems it to
be both trivial and non-related to
the type of offense for which
probation was granted.
2. A violation will also consist of
the breach of any specific term
upon which the probation was
granted.
c. 1 . Unless otherwise specified by
the judicial body, "probation"
shall be read to impose and set
aside suspension for one full
academic quarter.
2. Unless otherwise specified in
the original probation order, and
except as provided in (3) below,
any period of suspension for
violation of probation shall begin
as of thy first day of the next
ensuing quarter after the
determination that the student is
guilty of a subsequent offense or
other violation of probation.
3. If the next ensuing quarter is
Summer Quarter, then the
suspension shall begin as the first
day of the Fall Quarter unless it
be determined by the Dean of
Students, in his sole discretion,
that the student would have
enrolled as a full time student
during the Summer Quarter had
no violation taken place.
d. The provisions of section
11.3.(c)(2) are fully applicable to
suspension imposed for violation of
probation.
e. Once a determination has been
made that the student is guilty of a
second offense or other violation of
probation, the student shall be
subject to the provisions of section
11.3 (c)(3).
112. 1. The sentence imposed for
violation of probation is the
reinstated sentence for the
offense for which probation was
granted
2. The judicial body shall impose
an independent sentence for the
subsequent violation itself. In
determining the sentence for said
subsequent offense the judicial
body shall consider the
reinstated sentence for the first
offense and its severity, and may
allow the initial sentence, as
reinstated, to suffice for both
offenses, or may impose
additional penalties.
8. Formal Censure by the University
President

The President shall in writing so
notify any student against whom
censure is ordered.
9. Combination of Penalties
The judicial body may impose a
sentence combining various
penalties, when it deems such action
appropriate. For example, a penalty
could consist of suspension for a
quarter, plus probation for a
two-year period thereafter during
which time the student would not
be permitted to live in University
housing.

2. A violation will also consist of
the breach of any specific term
upon which the probation was
granted.
c. 1 . Unless otherwise specified by

proposed Penalty Code beyond this
point in the text.)

of a right or privilege, both the
specific right or privilege lost and
the period of such loss must be
stated in writing.

imposition of the sentece.
b. Under section 1.6.(d), a student
may be deprived of such rights and
privileges as living in University
housing, using University

a. Probation is the imposition and
the setting aside of a penalty

which automatically results in the
reinstatement of the suspension.

probation, unless the judicial
body hearing said subsequent
offense specifically deems it to
be both trivial and non-related to
the type of offense for which
probation was granted.
2. A violation will also consist of
the breach of any specific term
upon which the probation was
granted.
c. 1 . Unless otherwise specified by
the judicial body, "probation"
shall be read to impose and set
aside suspension for one full
academic quarter.

112. 1. The sentence imposed for
violation of probation is the
reinstated sentence for the
offense for which probation was
granted
2. The judicial body shall impose
an independent sentence for the
subsequent violation itself. In
determining the sentence for said
subsequent offense the judicial
body shall consider the
reinstated sentence for the first
offense and its severity, and may
allow the initial sentence, as
reinstated, to suffice for both
offenses, or may impose
additional penalties.
8. Formal Censure by the University
President

The President shall in writing so
notify any student against whom
censure is ordered.
9. Combination of Penalties
The judicial body may impose a
sentence combining various

appropriate. For example, a penalty
could consist of suspension for a
quarter, plus probation for a
two-year period thereafter during
which time the student would not
be permitted to live in University
housing.

subsequent violation itself. In
determining the sentence for said

offenses, or may impose
additional penalties.
8. Formal Censure by the University
President

The President shall in writing so

censure is ordered.
9. Combination of Penalties
The judicial body may impose a

quarter, plus probation for a
two-year period thereafter during
which time the student would not
be permitted to live in University
housing.

appears necessary to avoid undue
financial hardship. In no event,
however, shall a university degree
be awarded to any defendant
until he has paid the full amount
due.

pay as ordered shall be treated as
if he had been suspended and
shall be subject to all the
disabilities of Section 3 until

on-campus facility or organization

alternative penalty shall be
imposed.

hardship. In no event, however,
shall a University degree be
awarded to any defendant until
he has successfully completed
the work.

meet a deadline shall thereupon
be treated as if he had been
suspended and shall be subject to
all the disabilities of Section 3
until such time as he does

preliminary consideration of the
proposed Penalty Code beyond this
point in the text.)

may be deprived of such rights and
privileges as living in University
housing, using University

offense of which the student has
been found guilty constituted an
abuse of the right or privilege to be
taken away.

a. Probation is the imposition and
the setting aside of a penalty
suspending the student from the
University on terms, a violation of
which automatically results in the
reinstatement of the suspension.
b. 1. A violation shall consist of the
commission of any subsequent
offense during the period of the
probation, unless the judicial
body hearing said subsequent
offense specifically deems it to
be both trivial and non-related to
the type of offense for which
probation was granted.
2. A violation will also consist of
the breach of any specific term
upon which the probation was
granted.
c. 1 . Unless otherwise specified by
the judicial body, "probation"
shall be read to impose and set
aside suspension for one full
academic quarter.

the original probation order, and
except as provided in (3) below,
any period of suspension for
violation of probation shall begin
as of thy first day of the next
ensuing quarter after the
determination that the student is
guilty of a subsequent offense or
other violation of probation.
3. If the next ensuing quarter is
Summer Quarter, then the
suspension shall begin as the first

be determined by the Dean of
Students, in his sole discretion,
that the student would have
enrolled as a full time student
during the Summer Quarter had
no violation taken place.
d. The provisions of section
11.3.(c)(2) are fully applicable to
suspension imposed for violation of
probation.
e. Once a determination has been
made that the student is guilty of a
second offense or other violation of
probation, the student shall be
subject to the provisions of section
11.3 (c)(3).
112. 1. The sentence imposed for
violation of probation is the
reinstated sentence for the
offense for which probation was
granted
2. The judicial body shall impose
an independent sentence for the
subsequent violation itself. In
determining the sentence for said
subsequent offense the judicial
body shall consider the
reinstated sentence for the first
offense and its severity, and may
allow the initial sentence, as
reinstated, to suffice for both
offenses, or may impose
additional penalties.
8. Formal Censure by the University
President

The President shall in writing so
notify any student against whom
censure is ordered.
9. Combination of Penalties
The judicial body may impose a
sentence combining various
penalties, when it deems such action
appropriate. For example, a penalty
could consist of suspension for a
quarter, plus probation for a
two-year period thereafter during
which time the student would not
be permitted to live in University
housing.

2. A violation will also consist of
the breach of any specific term
upon which the probation was
granted.
c. 1 . Unless otherwise specified by

to successful completion of any
work fine imposed upon him.
b. 1. Any work fine shall specify

the number of hours to be
worked and set a deadline or
deadlines before which said work
isito be satisfactorily completed.
2. Every work deadline shall be
conditioned as follows: The
Dean of Students shall upon
application by a defendant
postpone the time that the-work
must be completed when, in the
Dean's judgment, it appears
necessary to avoid undue
hardship. In no event, however,
shall a University degree be
awarded to any defendant until
he has successfully completed
the work.
3. A student who has failed to
meet a deadline shall thereupon
be treated as if he had been
suspended and shall be subject to
all the disabilities of Section 3
until such time as he does
satisfactorily complete the work.
(NOTE: The SCLC has not completed
preliminary consideration of the
proposed Penalty Code beyond this
point in the text.)
6. Loss of Rights and Privileges
a. 1. Whenever a student is deprived
of a right or privilege, both the
specific right or privilege lost and
the period of such loss must be
stated in writing.
2. Whenever it is stated that a
student shall not serve on one
type of committee or in a
position of trust, it shall be
assumed, unless clearly stated
otherwise, that the sentence does
not remove the student from
other positions for which he was
appointed or hired prior to
imposition of the sentece.
b. Under section 1.6.(d), a student
may be deprived of such rights and
privileges as living in University
housing, using University
machinery, driving a motor vehicle
on campus, etc.; but such penalty
may be imposed only when the
offense of which the student has
been found guilty constituted an
abuse of the right or privilege to be
taken away.
7. Probation
a. Probation is the imposition and
the setting aside of a penalty
suspending the student from the
University on terms, a violation of
which automatically results in the
reinstatement of the suspension.
b. 1. A violation shall consist of the
commission of any subsequent
offense during the period of the
probation, unless the judicial
body hearing said subsequent
offense specifically deems it to
be both trivial and non-related to
the type of offense for which
probation was granted.
2. A violation will also consist of
the breach of any specific term
upon which the probation was
granted.
c. 1 . Unless otherwise specified by
the judicial body, "probation"
shall be read to impose and set
aside suspension for one full
academic quarter.
2. Unless otherwise specified in
the original probation order, and
except as provided in (3) below,
any period of suspension for
violation of probation shall begin
as of thy first day of the next
ensuing quarter after the
determination that the student is
guilty of a subsequent offense or
other violation of probation.
3. If the next ensuing quarter is
Summer Quarter, then the
suspension shall begin as the first
day of the Fall Quarter unless it
be determined by the Dean of
Students, in his sole discretion,
that the student would have
enrolled as a full time student
during the Summer Quarter had
no violation taken place.
d. The provisions of section
11.3.(c)(2) are fully applicable to
suspension imposed for violation of
probation.
e. Once a determination has been
made that the student is guilty of a
second offense or other violation of
probation, the student shall be
subject to the provisions of section
11.3 (c)(3).
112. 1. The sentence imposed for
violation of probation is the
reinstated sentence for the
offense for which probation was
granted
2. The judicial body shall impose
an independent sentence for the
subsequent violation itself. In
determining the sentence for said
subsequent offense the judicial
body shall consider the
reinstated sentence for the first
offense and its severity, and may
allow the initial sentence, as
reinstated, to suffice for both
offenses, or may impose
additional penalties.
8. Formal Censure by the University
President

The President shall in writing so
notify any student against whom
censure is ordered.
9. Combination of Penalties
The judicial body may impose a
sentence combining various
penalties, when it deems such action
appropriate. For example, a penalty
could consist of suspension for a
quarter, plus probation for a
two-year period thereafter during
which time the student would not
be permitted to live in University
housing.
