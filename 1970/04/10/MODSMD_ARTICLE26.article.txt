## Indians Open At Cal 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
After 30 games over a span of
more than two months, Stanford's
baseball team finally gets down to
business tomorrow in the Pacific-8
opener at Berkeley.
The Indians will be putting a
streak of some interest on the line
when the 17 game regular season
schedule gets underway at 2 p.m.
in Cal's Evans Diamond. Stanford,

although trailing in the series 139
to 95, hasn't lost to the Bears in
the last 11 games. The Indians
have swept the season series from
Cal for the past three years.
Last season Stanford's 16-5
mark was second only to the 17-4
record of UCLA. Cal finished at
12-9, five games behind the
Bruins. Both teams have compiled
impressive early season records
thus far. Stanford, with a win
yesterday over St. Mary's, comes
into the game with a 24-5-1 mark.
Stanford is led by pitchers Phil
Keller, Steve Dunning and Jim
Coate, all of whom had earned
run averages under 2 going into

this week's action. At the plate
the Cards have been getting good
performances from Dunning, Mike
Ewing, Mike Nelson and Don
Schellenberg.
On Tuesday the Indians
exploded for six runs in the
fourth inning to beat University
of Pacific 8-3 at Stockton. Jim
Coate was rocked for three runs
early, but the lefthander held on
to get his fifth win against one
loss. Dick Borchers went three for
four with 2 runs batted in.
The Stanford Braves entertain
the Bears in a Bay Area Collegiate
League doubleheader at 1 p.m.
tomorrow.
