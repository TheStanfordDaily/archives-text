# Stanford, Beavers Seek First Wins
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Amid the usual number of
question marks Stanford's winless
track team sets out in Corvallis,
Ore., tomorrow afternoon for its
first win, facing an equally
unlucky Oregon State contingent.
Questionable aspects of the
meet include the Stanford team,
the Oregon State team and the
weather.
According to informal Daily
compilations, comparison of
season bests shows Stanford ahead
in eight events, OSU on top in six,
and four undecided.
Four are undecided because it's
tough to tell just who will be
competing for the Beavers, and
the status of the Tribe's A 1 Dyson
is unknown, too.
And then at Corvallis, the
weather (or, more accurately, the
rain) is inevitably another
imponderable.
Last week in Pullman,
Washington State dumped OSU in
its league opener 96-58, but the
Beavers left 11 injured performers
in Corvallis and ace sprinter Willie
Turner missed the trip because of
''academic deficiencies,"
according to OSU releases.
Whether or not "academic
deficiencies" are merely weekly
affairs at Oregon State should be
of primary concern for Stanford
fans, since the presence of Mr.
Turner would throw three of the
four "undecided" events—loo,
220, 440 relay—into the Beaver
column.
But should Dyson be over a
pulled hamstring muscle that kept
him out of action last week, it
would greatly help the Tribe in
the sprint events.
Stanford's strength against the
Beavers will clearly be the
distance events, where Don
Kardong and Greg Brock should
have the two-mile to themselves,

where Duncan Macdonald could
win by 10 or more seconds in the
mile, and where Brook Thomas
should take the steeplechase by
half a minute.
Alan Meredith, Casey Carrigan
and T C. Jones figure to dominate
the triple jump, pole vault and
shot put, respectively, and Randy
White shouldn't have really rough
competition in the intermediate
hurdles.
But Oregon State's Pat Collins
may come up a double winner in
the 440 and 880, and Tim Voth,
who has thrown 30 feet past
Stanford's Jerry Porter, should be
another Beaver winner in the
javelin.
Rick Tipton figures to have a
tight race with one Lowell Harris
in the high hurdles, and another
interesting battle should come in
the discus where Stanford's Steve
Davis has a two inch (176-9)
advantage over OSU's Steve
Athay.
The mile relay should be
another squeaker, as OSU's best
time is only .2 better than
Stanford's.
You can, then, look for a close
final score with minor injuries and
possibly a damp track providing
the margin for the winner and
justifiable excuse for the loser.
