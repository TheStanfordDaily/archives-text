# ASSU Senate Committee
## Report Critical Of Finances 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
The report of the student
Senate committee investigating
ASSU finances released last night
reveals that the Arena's charges of
sloppy ASSU office procedures
were substantially correct.
The right wing newspaper had
attacked the way ASSU finances
are being run in its February 5
issue. The most important charge
it made was that the ASSU's
books were in no condition for
the independent audit required by
the Constitution.
The committee report admits
that the ASSU's certified
accountant refused to audit the
books because "the books were
not ready to be audited." It
blames turnover in personnel in
the office (four office managers in
the past two years) and the
accounting firm's failure to report
a deterioration in the
bookkeeping before this year.
Legal Defense Fund
Charges that the Legal Defense

Fund (LDF) had no constitution,
mailbox, or signature card
authorizing withdrawals were
refuted by the four member
committee. No constitution or
mailbox are required for
voluntary associations, the
committee reported. It also stated
that "Both the chairman of the
Legal Defense Fund and the
Student Financial Manager attest
to the fact that such a card was
repeatedly removed from the
files."
The charge that a non-student,
Lennie Siegel, had authorized a
check from the LDF account was
held valid. The committee
contended however that Siegel had
mistakenly signed the
authorization and "that there is
absolutely no evidence that there
was any attempt to draw funds
from the Legal Defense fund
account improperly."
SCORE Vindicated
It stated that the Stanford
Committee on a Radical
Education need not have reported
sales tax receipts from the sale of
refreshments at a concert to the
ASSU or the University. "Tom
Bacchetti, director of public
events for the University, reported
to the committee that it has not
been the practice in the past for
Stanford groups to report sales
tax on any refreshments they
sold," the committee said.
Finally the committee
confirmed Hukari's report that 11
ASSU organizations had overspent
their appropriations. However, it
said that the largest debt, $11,000
of the Special Events Board was in
accounts receivable and that the
ASSU was considering suing to
recover that debt.
Their principle
recommendations were that
procedures to determine whether
representatives of voluntary
organizations are students be

instituted, that the salary of the
ASSU office manager or
bookkeeper be increased, and that
an experienced accountant be
hired to prepare the books for the
1968-69 audit and design
improved accounting procedures.
The report was not actually
read at the abbreviated Senate
meeting. A quorum call by
Senator Yale Braunstein as ASSU
President Pat Shea was preparing
to report on the ROTC
controversy ended the meeting
after only an hour and a half.
Before the end of the session
however the Senate did appoint
John Delaney, Louis Humphrey
and John McKenzie to the
nominations committee, and
certified the - nominations
procedures to be used for the
forthcoming election as valid.

It is not today but Sunday
whose anniversary we recall.
President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt died 25 years ago
on April 12. There was no
silent majority on that day,
only a majority sobbing.
Perhaps he didn 7 end the
Depression to stop the War,
but he did have a humanity
certain con tempo ra ry
Presidents lack. Somehow
how we can V imagine a
national trauma when
President Johnson or Nixon
dies. Put then America has
changed.
