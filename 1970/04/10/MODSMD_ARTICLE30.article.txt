# Injuries And Equipment
## New Gear Can Invite New Risks Fickle Athletes And Plastic Shoes 
### JOHN ARTHUR (Second of two) articles 
Despite significant advances in equipment
technology and closer supervision of organized
competitive athletics, most sports, especially the
contact variety, remain dangerous. But certain
hazards entail more risk than others.
Dr. Robert W. Jamplis, who, along with Dr.
Frederick Behling acts as physician for Stanford
teams, warns that head injuries are among the
most common and most dangerous in all athletics.
"Close observation of players by the team
physician, with early recognition of head injury on
the playing field, is necessary to prevent further
injury to a stunned and transiently inept player.
Fred Behling and I feel that no player with a
diagnosed concussion should return to play for 48
to 72 hours, and then only after thorough
examination by our neurosurgeons."
But, says, Jamplis, a thoracic surgeon at the
Palo Alto Clinic and a quarterback in the late
1930's at the University of Chicago, "The head
injury problem isn't too bad, considering the size
of the players today and how they hit. In any case,
the helmet could be improved. There ought to be
some sort of shock-proof helmet. There have been
promising developments here, but a helmet which
is both safer and acceptable by the athletes has yet
to be invented."
More so than most people, athletes are
notoriously fickle. Their capricious discrimination
in taste engulfs everthing from styles in clothing to
the latest in chin straps. And therein lies an
appreciable problem for coaches and physicians
endeavoring to introduce new, usually safer,
equipment.
For example, early last fall the football coaches
at Stanford, faced with the prospect of sending
their team out to play two games on artificial turf
during the season, introduced a new type of
football shoes for those games. The shoe featured
a special array of 20 short (3/8") cleats made of
hard, tough plastic specifically designed for use on
the fake turf. The point was to eliminate the deep
bite needed for traction on old-fashiontd grass
lields. Ordinarily, such a radical innovation would
require months of promotion before adoption by
the athletes. But the members of the team
enthusiastically endorsed the new cleats for use on
artificial grass and at least one player like them so
much he wore them in every game.
Such rapid acceptance of a new idea is the
exception rather than the rule, however. Dr.
Jamplis points out that "We still haven't been able
to get the players to wear mouthpieces to protect

their teeth. And a Los Angeles orthopedist with a
national reputation for his work with injured
athletes like Sandy Koutax and Wilt Chamberlain,
Dr. Robert Kerlan, admits that his plan to insert
small plastic shields into rear pockets on basketball
shorts to guard against injury when players fell on
their behinds failed when the athletes objected to
the appearance of the devices. Other
safety-oriented innovations which have failed to
receive wide acceptance among athletes have been
goalie masks and helmets in hockey (although only
the pros are holding out here, with use of this
equipment widespread among amateurs), and
earpads for rugby and wrestling.
Another new development which has been
hailed in part because it's supposed to reduce
injuries has been the artificial turf. But Behling
and Jamplis agree that an advertising campaign by
at least one manufacturer has been misleading. Ads
lor Monsanto's Astro Turf claim that the nylon
surface "substantially reduces knee and ankle
injuries." The theory is that cleats won't catch in
wet turf or mud.
Yet Jamplis maintains that "There are not more
or fewer injuries," on the substance. "The scrapes
burns and cuts incurred when a player falls on the
nylon are much harder to handle than those
sustained on regular grass," he says, adding that,
"the bacteria in the nylon can be infecting." Nor
are players apparently enthused about the ersatz
grass. In a survey last fall at Stanford, virtually all
players questioned said they preferred most
regular grass to Astro Turf, and all said the artificial
surface was "more bruising to fall on."
Such are the pitfalls of innovation, however.
New developments in equipment are often
accompanied by new risks. The advent of face bars
on football helmets, for instance, was widely
heralded as a boon to the sport of those who
cherished unbroken noses and checkbones. But
along with the bars came two new hazards:
dangerous face-mask vibrations, in which opposing
players made tackled by grabbing the bars, and the
risk of serious neck injury when players,
particularly linemen, no longer concerned about
getting a list in the face, would block an opponent
with the head up.
This technique, labeled spearing, had a
significant rise as players, confident that their
heads were protected, used the helmet as a
battering ram to stop an opponent. But, as the
A.M.A.'s Committee on the Medical Aspects of
Sports in 1968, "It was soon obvious that an
increase in head and neck injuries was occurring
with this trend." The problem was traced to the
coaches, as a survey showed that 60 percent of the
players receiving head injuries had been taught to
spear, and 44 percent of those with neck injuries
had been similarly coached.
Neck injuries, of course, like any others, can be
forestalled if not prevented by proper
conditioning. The team physician concerned about

the possibility ot a rash oi neck injuries can either
prescribe intensive pre-season drills to strengthen
specilic muscles or can use his influence on the
coaching stall to change a team's style. Yet while
team doctors, to be at all effective, must demand
complete cooperation from the coaching staff and
the school administration as well as unquestioned
authority regarding which players may participate,
Behling points out, "You can't legislate how a
coach will coach."
Virtually all doctors associated with athletics
emphasize the importance of preseason
conditioning, as well as a thorough physical exam.
"There's no question that the guy in the best
physical condition will get hurt the least," Jamplis
says, adding, "And I can't prove it, but aggressive
players get hurt less than others, too."
There is no denial that injury is as much a part
of sport as winning and losing. Behling and Jamplis
claim that there is virtually no chance of a player
completing three years of competitive football at
the high school or college level without missing at
least some practice or game time due to injury.
And one player in 15 or 20 will probably need
surgical treatment. The crucial question is where
to draw the line between "inherent risk factors"
and legislation promoting safer equipment and
constricting rules.
The men who must draw this line and see that
it is not crossed are not the coaches or the athletic
directors but the doctors and trainers. Most
athletic administrators recognize this, and team
physicians can be as valuable as any $100,000
superstars. Dr. Kerlan, who was physician to the
Los Angeles Dodgers, was once called "the most
valuable man I've signed," by former Dodgers'
General Manager Buzzie Bavasi. And Coach Weeb
Ewbank says that the first man to see the New
York Jets' draft choices is the team doctor. "We've
learned. We're still paying people who never
played for us," he's said.
On the college and scholastic level the stakes
are just as high. In electing to play for Stanford
again this fall, rather than turn pro, Jim Plunkett is
exposing himself to the very real possibility of a
career-terminating injury. Similarly, basketball's
Detroit Pistons, who recently signed the injured
Bob Lanier, are wagering an enormous sum on
medicine's ability to return an expensive athlete to
top form.
Furthermore, in this era of mass recreation, the
gains made in the treatment of high-priced athletes
can indirectly, through the development of new
techniques, benefit such diverse types as weekend
skiers, tennis players and touch footballers.
