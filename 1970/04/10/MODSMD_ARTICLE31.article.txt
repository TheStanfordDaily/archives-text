Stanford will host the Western
Regional Championship of the
Collegiate Karate Union of the
United States this Saturday, with
competition slated to begin at 1
p.m. in Encina Pavillion. Schools
participating include UCLA, UC
Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, UC
San Diego, UC Riverside, USC,
Cal State Los Angeles, University
of Hawaii, and both Stanford
Karate Clubs.
Spectators can view both
individual and team competition
in kumite (free sparring) and kata
(formal exercise). The winners,
team and individual, will represent
the Western Region in the
National Championships to be
held this year in St. Louis.

In a karate free-sparring match,
a contestant is awarded a point if
he is able to deliver a strongly
focused punch or kick to a vital
area, controlling the attack so that
no contact is actually made. He is
subject to disqualification if he
actually strikes his opponent.
In kata competition,
contestants are judged on their
ability to perform traditional
sequences of attack and defense
moves with strength, rhythm and
timing.
The tournament is sponsored
by the Stanford University Karate
Club, under the auspices of the
US Collegiate Karate Union, a
non-profit federation of university
karate clubs.
