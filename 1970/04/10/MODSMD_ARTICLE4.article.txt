# Anti-ROTC Strategy Discussed At Meeting
## 
### 
Over 300 opponents of ROTC
last night set aims for the
movement and detailed future
action.
The eleven-point program
adopted, focuses on the
elimination of ROTC at Stanford
as its "central demand."
Subsidiary demands include the
elimination of University
involvement in "American
imperialism," amnesty for
anti-ROTC protesters, support of
Stanford workers, and aid to
ROTC students seeking to drop
out of the program.
Other Proposals
Sixteen proposals other than
the off-ROTC demand were
presented. Ten were approved.
After all suggestions were
made, the group voted almost
unanimously to make the ROTC
elimination its only demand, and
to make all other proposals part
of a supplementary program.
The provisional text of the
demand statement is:
the Reserve Officers Training Corps
program at Stanford must be
immediately eliminated.
Subject to ratification of
wording, the Movement adopted
the following program to
strengthen and clarify the primary
demand.
1. All needy cadets currently on
ROTC scholarships must receive
whatever aid is necessary for their
continued education at Stanford
once the program is terminated.
2. In addition the University must
provide legal defense for any cadet
adversely affected by the Punitive
Clause of the ROTC contract.
3. Furthermore, University staff now
employed in ROTC-connected
programs must be guaranteed
continued employment at Stanford
once ROTC is eliminated.
4. We affirm the right of Stanford
workers to organize into unions.
5. We support the just wage demands
of Stanford employees.
6. To insure that curriculum decisions
reflect the best interests of both
students and faculty, responsibility
for such decisions must be shared
by students and faculty without
interference from the
administration or Trustees.
7. Control of the University must be
transferred from the Board of
Trustees to staff, faculty, and
students.
8. To further remove Stanford from
the war in Southeast Asia, no
military, CIA or FBI recruiting
should be permitted on campus.
9. All counterinsurgency research at
Stanford must be eliminated.
10.Amnesty against prosecution must
be guaranteed for all those—on or
off campus—participating in the
struggle against ROTC.
Rejected proposals were: that
ROTC be kept on campus; that
job training be provided for
former ROTC students; that all
university involvement with the
government be ended; that
"the profit motive be eliminated"
and that all students needing
financial aid be granted it.
Clearing House
At the start of the meeting, a
coordinating committee
spokesman had reported that a
"clearing house" for anti-ROTC
work and information has been
established in the ASSU office.
It was also announced that
coordinating committee meetings
will not be open to the public,
starting with one today at 12:30
at the ASSU office.

Fund raising for the legal
defense fund and the "Street Wall
Journal," a movement publication
which was first distributed
yesterday, was also stressed. There
will be a fund-raising project at a
Sunday concert in Frost.
The permanent injunction on
campus disruptions was discussed,
as well as a proposed Teach-In
next week, to which University
administrators will be invited. A
proposed reply to a recent KCBS
editorial was presented.
The discussion, chaired by
Doug McHenry, then turned to
tactics.
Tactics
Before a dwindling crowd of
250, speakers posed a wide variety
of strategic options. One speaker
issued a call for a concerted
non-violent campaign stressing
next week's referendum on
ROTC.
Another speaker suggested
retention of the ROTC program as
a means of humanizing the
military.
After forty minutes of
discussion, and a series of votes, a
consensus of future action
emerged.
A number of speakers were
pessimistic about the results of
any such student ROTC
referendum, supporting the vote
only because it would illustrate

"Pitzer's contradictory stand."
Support of a petition campaign
was withheld by the meeting.
Action Next Week
Most future action is scheduled
for next week, when the Trustees
meet and the referendum is held.
Monday, ROTC drill will
possibly be interrupted by a
"nude-in," as some affinity groups
and individuals join Naval ROTC
drills in the nude.
Tuesday, the group plans to
have lunch with the Trustees as
they meet on campus. They hope
to ask the board "relevant"
questions relating to the ROTC
question as well as "why is the
University run as the personal
property of the Trustees?"
Also planned for Tuesday is a
forum, to feature the Trustees,
Pitzer, and Provost Richard
Lyman. Should they be unable to
attend, there will be an open mike
for discussion of the ROTC issue.
Left open to future discussion
was a proposal for a sit-in in the
event of Trustee refusal to open
their meeting.
Other future plans include
identification and communication
with members of the Council of
Undergraduate Studies (CUS),
which must pass on the issue of
ROTC course credit, as well as use
of rock concerts as future forums
for ROTC discussion.

1. All needy cadets currently on
ROTC scholarships must receive
whatever aid is necessary for their
continued education at Stanford
once the program is terminated.
2. In addition the University must
provide legal defense for any cadet
adversely affected by the Punitive
Clause of the ROTC contract.
3. Furthermore, University staff now
employed in ROTC-connected
programs must be guaranteed
continued employment at Stanford
once ROTC is eliminated.
4. We affirm the right of Stanford
workers to organize into unions.
5. We support the just wage demands
of Stanford employees.
6. To insure that curriculum decisions
reflect the best interests of both
students and faculty, responsibility
for such decisions must be shared
by students and faculty without
interference from the
administration or Trustees.
7. Control of the University must be
transferred from the Board of
Trustees to staff, faculty, and
students.
8. To further remove Stanford from
the war in Southeast Asia, no
military, CIA or FBI recruiting
should be permitted on campus.
9. All counterinsurgency research at
Stanford must be eliminated.
10.Amnesty against prosecution must
be guaranteed for all those—on or
off campus—participating in the
struggle against ROTC.
Rejected proposals were: that
ROTC be kept on campus; that
job training be provided for
former ROTC students; that all
university involvement with the
government be ended; that
"the profit motive be eliminated"
and that all students needing
financial aid be granted it.
Clearing House
At the start of the meeting, a
coordinating committee
spokesman had reported that a
"clearing house" for anti-ROTC
work and information has been
established in the ASSU office.
It was also announced that
coordinating committee meetings
will not be open to the public,
starting with one today at 12:30
at the ASSU office.

Fund raising for the legal
defense fund and the "Street Wall
Journal," a movement publication
which was first distributed
yesterday, was also stressed. There
will be a fund-raising project at a
Sunday concert in Frost.
The permanent injunction on
campus disruptions was discussed,
as well as a proposed Teach-In
next week, to which University
administrators will be invited. A
proposed reply to a recent KCBS
editorial was presented.
The discussion, chaired by
Doug McHenry, then turned to
tactics.
Tactics
Before a dwindling crowd of
250, speakers posed a wide variety
of strategic options. One speaker
issued a call for a concerted
non-violent campaign stressing
next week's referendum on
ROTC.
Another speaker suggested
retention of the ROTC program as
a means of humanizing the
military.
After forty minutes of
discussion, and a series of votes, a
consensus of future action
emerged.
A number of speakers were
pessimistic about the results of
any such student ROTC
referendum, supporting the vote
only because it would illustrate

"Pitzer's contradictory stand."
Support of a petition campaign
was withheld by the meeting.
Action Next Week
Most future action is scheduled
for next week, when the Trustees
meet and the referendum is held.
Monday, ROTC drill will
possibly be interrupted by a
"nude-in," as some affinity groups
and individuals join Naval ROTC
drills in the nude.
Tuesday, the group plans to
have lunch with the Trustees as
they meet on campus. They hope
to ask the board "relevant"
questions relating to the ROTC
question as well as "why is the
University run as the personal
property of the Trustees?"
Also planned for Tuesday is a
forum, to feature the Trustees,
Pitzer, and Provost Richard
Lyman. Should they be unable to
attend, there will be an open mike
for discussion of the ROTC issue.
Left open to future discussion
was a proposal for a sit-in in the
event of Trustee refusal to open
their meeting.
Other future plans include
identification and communication
with members of the Council of
Undergraduate Studies (CUS),
which must pass on the issue of
ROTC course credit, as well as use
of rock concerts as future forums
for ROTC discussion.
Over 300 opponents of ROTC
last night set aims for the
movement and detailed future
action.
The eleven-point program
adopted, focuses on the
elimination of ROTC at Stanford
as its "central demand."
Subsidiary demands include the
elimination of University
involvement in "American
imperialism," amnesty for
anti-ROTC protesters, support of
Stanford workers, and aid to
ROTC students seeking to drop
out of the program.
Other Proposals
Sixteen proposals other than
the off-ROTC demand were
presented. Ten were approved.
After all suggestions were
made, the group voted almost
unanimously to make the ROTC
elimination its only demand, and
to make all other proposals part
of a supplementary program.
The provisional text of the
demand statement is:
the Reserve Officers Training Corps
program at Stanford must be
immediately eliminated.
Subject to ratification of
wording, the Movement adopted
the following program to
strengthen and clarify the primary
demand.
1. All needy cadets currently on
ROTC scholarships must receive
whatever aid is necessary for their
continued education at Stanford
once the program is terminated.

should be permitted on campus.
9. All counterinsurgency research at
Stanford must be eliminated.
10.Amnesty against prosecution must
be guaranteed for all those—on or
off campus—participating in the
struggle against ROTC.
Rejected proposals were: that
ROTC be kept on campus; that
job training be provided for
former ROTC students; that all
university involvement with the
government be ended; that
"the profit motive be eliminated"
and that all students needing
financial aid be granted it.
Clearing House
At the start of the meeting, a
coordinating committee
spokesman had reported that a
"clearing house" for anti-ROTC
work and information has been
established in the ASSU office.
It was also announced that
coordinating committee meetings
will not be open to the public,
starting with one today at 12:30
at the ASSU office.

Fund raising for the legal
defense fund and the "Street Wall
Journal," a movement publication
which was first distributed
yesterday, was also stressed. There
will be a fund-raising project at a
Sunday concert in Frost.
The permanent injunction on
campus disruptions was discussed,
as well as a proposed Teach-In
next week, to which University
administrators will be invited. A
proposed reply to a recent KCBS
editorial was presented.
The discussion, chaired by
Doug McHenry, then turned to
tactics.
Tactics
Before a dwindling crowd of
250, speakers posed a wide variety
of strategic options. One speaker
issued a call for a concerted
non-violent campaign stressing
next week's referendum on
ROTC.
Another speaker suggested
retention of the ROTC program as
a means of humanizing the
military.
After forty minutes of
discussion, and a series of votes, a
consensus of future action
emerged.
A number of speakers were
pessimistic about the results of
any such student ROTC
referendum, supporting the vote
only because it would illustrate

"Pitzer's contradictory stand."
Support of a petition campaign
was withheld by the meeting.
Action Next Week
Most future action is scheduled
for next week, when the Trustees
meet and the referendum is held.
Monday, ROTC drill will
possibly be interrupted by a
"nude-in," as some affinity groups
and individuals join Naval ROTC
drills in the nude.
Tuesday, the group plans to
have lunch with the Trustees as
they meet on campus. They hope
to ask the board "relevant"
questions relating to the ROTC
question as well as "why is the
University run as the personal
property of the Trustees?"
Also planned for Tuesday is a
forum, to feature the Trustees,
Pitzer, and Provost Richard
Lyman. Should they be unable to
attend, there will be an open mike
for discussion of the ROTC issue.
Left open to future discussion
was a proposal for a sit-in in the
event of Trustee refusal to open
their meeting.
Other future plans include
identification and communication
with members of the Council of
Undergraduate Studies (CUS),
which must pass on the issue of
ROTC course credit, as well as use
of rock concerts as future forums
for ROTC discussion.
Over 300 opponents of ROTC
last night set aims for the
movement and detailed future
action.
The eleven-point program
adopted, focuses on the
elimination of ROTC at Stanford
as its "central demand."
Subsidiary demands include the
elimination of University
involvement in "American
imperialism," amnesty for
anti-ROTC protesters, support of
Stanford workers, and aid to
ROTC students seeking to drop
out of the program.
Other Proposals
Sixteen proposals other than
the off-ROTC demand were
presented. Ten were approved.
After all suggestions were
made, the group voted almost
unanimously to make the ROTC
elimination its only demand, and
to make all other proposals part
of a supplementary program.
The provisional text of the
demand statement is:
the Reserve Officers Training Corps
program at Stanford must be
immediately eliminated.
Subject to ratification of
wording, the Movement adopted
the following program to
strengthen and clarify the primary
demand.
1. All needy cadets currently on
ROTC scholarships must receive
whatever aid is necessary for their
continued education at Stanford
once the program is terminated.
2. In addition the University must
provide legal defense for any cadet
adversely affected by the Punitive
Clause of the ROTC contract.
3. Furthermore, University staff now
employed in ROTC-connected
programs must be guaranteed
continued employment at Stanford
once ROTC is eliminated.
4. We affirm the right of Stanford
workers to organize into unions.
5. We support the just wage demands
of Stanford employees.
6. To insure that curriculum decisions
reflect the best interests of both
students and faculty, responsibility
for such decisions must be shared
by students and faculty without
interference from the
administration or Trustees.
7. Control of the University must be
transferred from the Board of
Trustees to staff, faculty, and
students.
8. To further remove Stanford from
the war in Southeast Asia, no
military, CIA or FBI recruiting
should be permitted on campus.
9. All counterinsurgency research at
Stanford must be eliminated.
10.Amnesty against prosecution must
be guaranteed for all those—on or
off campus—participating in the
struggle against ROTC.
