# Monday March

### BOB LITTERMAN RALPH KOSTANT 
Reacting to recent anti-ROTC
violence, two student groups are
planning a march against violence
Monday night.
The candle-light procession will
begin at 7:50 p.m. in White Plaza
and proceed to Memorial Church.
Three speakers, including
Volunteers In Asia Director
Dwight Clark and Sanford
Dornbusch, professor of sociology
will address the crowd.
The march is an outgrowth of a
meeting last Wednesday night
during which 30 students and
faculty members discussed what
could be done to counteract the
recent violence on campus. People
at the meeting broke into two
groups after a disagreement on the
ROTC issue. One group, led by
ASSU President Pat Shea,
opposed ROTC while the other,
under the direction of Shea's
fellow Council of Presidents
member, John Grube, did not
address itself to the ROTC issue.
According to Grube, the march
organizers believe, "that violence
is unacceptable as a means of
bringing about change in the
University."
Second Meeting
About 40 students attended a
meeting in Tresidder yesterday
evening to discuss effective,
non-violent actions directed
towards the elimination of ROTC
on the Stanford campus. Shea,
who presided at the meeting,

stressed the importance of the
referendum on ROTC which will
be on the ASSU elections ballot
next week.
"Ambiguous as last year's
referendum was," he commented,
"the 3 to 2 student vote in favor
of maintaining ROTC on campus
was used repeatedly in this year's
Academic Senate debate by
proponents of the ROTC
experimental program."
Shea urged the students to
work for a "mass turnout against
ROTC."
Other courses of action to be
pursued by Shea's group include
circulating a petition stating,
"that academic credit should be
denied to all ROTC courses" and
requesting open sessions of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (vs) to discuss the granting
of credit to individual ROTC
classes.
Shea holds that the so-called
"punitive clauses" in student
ROTC contracts hinder
individuals who wish to drop
ROTC courses. Because of these
violations of academic freedom
Shea's group feels that no ROTC
course should be granted credit.
Contrary to statements made
by the groups organizers last
night, Vietnam Moratorium
Chairman John Kramer has not
helped organize the march against
violence but has been involved in
the non-violent anti-ROTC
campaign.
