# Against ROTC Protestors
## Pitzer Expects Criminal Charges 
### FRANK MILLER 
Criminal charges resulting from
this week's anti-ROTC
demonstrations will "no doubt"
be filed by the district attorney,
President Kenneth S. Pitzer said
yesterday.
Photographs and other evidence
will be used to prosecute those
involved, either through the
Stanford Judicial Council or the
criminal courts.
Pitzer said that "there has not
been a decision" on the issue of
whether to prosecute students in
court or before the judicial
Council. "When (members of the
campus community) are closely
involved with non-Stanford
people, and when the police also
are involved," he added the only
equitable way may be to go to
court.
Nevertheless, the President did
reaffirm his preference for using
campus judicial mechanisms "as
much as possible."
"Illegal acts of violence are not
to be condoned," he said. "So far
as there is evidence of individuals
perpetrating such acts, they ought
to be punished."

Photographs of the
demonstration that disrupted the
Academic Council meeting a week
ago and of the demonstrations
Tuesday and Wednesday at the
ROTC-Athletic Building are being
held by the President's office and
members of the Stanford
community have been asked by
Pitzer to identify people in the
pictures.
Pitzer re-emphasized the
democratic nature of the decision
making process by which the
faculty voted to allow Army
ROTC to qualify for limited
credit. "To allow a small pressure
group to overturn that sort of
decision-making would be most
unfortunate to the University," he
said.
When there is new evidence
with regard to ROTC, the
Academic Senate should
re-evaluate it's decision, Pitzer
added. But, "we ought to regard
this (the 1 ROTC decision) as
decided for this year."
Slii ilrn I R «■ pros en la I ion
He said that the key decision in
the Army ROTC issue was
primarily academic in nature and
so was the faculty's responsibility.

Student views wore represented,
according to Pitzer, through
student representation on the
President's advisory committee on
ROTC and last spring's student
referendum.
Pitzer stated however, that next
week's student ROTC referendum
would "certainly influence future
decisions in this area." The
peaceful march presently planned
for Monday night would be a
"perfectly legitimate element" of
expression, although the
"referendum would be a more
apt" view of student sentiment,
Pitzer said.
He added that at any time a
member of the faculty Senate
could introduce a new proposal
on ROTC.
Both the Navy and Air Force
are considering how much to
follow the plan of the Army here
at Stanford. Due to the small
enrollment in Air Force ROTC
and the small output in officers,
"the Air Force might decide not
to stay just on that basis, Pitzer
said.
Sin,ill Sii lisiilif's
The President noted that the
money Stanford uses to indirectly

subsidize the ROTC is "very
small." "There is a net financial
benefit to the University" when
this subsidy is compared to the
financial aid ROTC provides to
students. "There's no question
(that) elimination of ROTC would
have a direct, adverse effect on
funds," he added.
According to Don Price, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, the
University indirect subsidy of
ROTC last year amounted to
about $22,000 lor supply of
buildings and office services.
ROTC scholarships last year
amounted to about SI 45,000.
Pitzer said he had not had
intensive conversations with the
military, the defense department,
or the Stanford ROTC officers
since the demonstrations began,
but indicated that lie did not feel
any appreciable outside pressure
to clamp down harder on the
demonstrators. "1 don't need to
b<> prodded by others" to do
something about the violent
disruptions, he said.
Pii"--nIT (in DOD
ROTC arrangements at other
universities will be closely
watched, lie said. II information is

received that other universities
have set up a more favorable
program and "if their situation is
similar to ours, (Stanford) will put
pressure on the Defense
Department to adjust
correspondingly."
He added that situations differ
greatly around the nation. "At
some schools, things like
undergraduate specials are not
given academic credit at all." He
emphasized that the Army
proposal does not promise any
credit for ROTC courses it only
says that ROTC courses will be
considered for credit on their
merits.
Pitzer again expressed his
concern over the punitive clauses
in the student ROTC contracts.
He said that "greatest attention
will be given to getting the
legislation changed" and that in
the meantime he hoped that there
would be "a clear definition of
how the Defense Department
administers (this provision) within
the latitude permitted by
legislation."
Pitzer made his statements
yesterday in an exclusive
interview with the Daily.

Academic Senate should
re-evaluate it's decision, Pitzer
added. But, "we ought to regard
this (the 1 ROTC decision) as

He said that the key decision in
the Army ROTC issue was
primarily academic in nature and
so was the faculty's responsibility.

Student views wore represented,
according to Pitzer, through
student representation on the
President's advisory committee on
ROTC and last spring's student
referendum.
Pitzer stated however, that next
week's student ROTC referendum
would "certainly influence future
decisions in this area." The
peaceful march presently planned
for Monday night would be a
"perfectly legitimate element" of
expression, although the
"referendum would be a more
apt" view of student sentiment,
Pitzer said.
He added that at any time a
member of the faculty Senate
could introduce a new proposal
on ROTC.
Both the Navy and Air Force
are considering how much to
follow the plan of the Army here
at Stanford. Due to the small
enrollment in Air Force ROTC
and the small output in officers,
"the Air Force might decide not
to stay just on that basis, Pitzer
said.

The President noted that the
money Stanford uses to indirectly

subsidize the ROTC is "very
small." "There is a net financial
benefit to the University" when
this subsidy is compared to the
financial aid ROTC provides to
students. "There's no question
(that) elimination of ROTC would
have a direct, adverse effect on
funds," he added.
According to Don Price, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, the
University indirect subsidy of
ROTC last year amounted to
about $22,000 lor supply of
buildings and office services.
ROTC scholarships last year
amounted to about SI 45,000.
Pitzer said he had not had
intensive conversations with the
military, the defense department,
or the Stanford ROTC officers
since the demonstrations began,
but indicated that lie did not feel
any appreciable outside pressure
to clamp down harder on the
demonstrators. "1 don't need to
b<> prodded by others" to do
something about the violent
disruptions, he said.

ROTC arrangements at other
universities will be closely

received that other universities
have set up a more favorable
program and "if their situation is
similar to ours, (Stanford) will put
pressure on the Defense
Department to adjust
correspondingly."
He added that situations differ
greatly around the nation. "At
some schools, things like
undergraduate specials are not
given academic credit at all." He
emphasized that the Army
proposal does not promise any
credit for ROTC courses it only
says that ROTC courses will be
considered for credit on their
merits.
Pitzer again expressed his
concern over the punitive clauses
in the student ROTC contracts.
He said that "greatest attention
will be given to getting the
legislation changed" and that in
the meantime he hoped that there
would be "a clear definition of
how the Defense Department
administers (this provision) within
the latitude permitted by
legislation."
Pitzer made his statements
yesterday in an exclusive
interview with the Daily.

Criminal charges resulting from
this week's anti-ROTC
demonstrations will "no doubt"
be filed by the district attorney,
President Kenneth S. Pitzer said
yesterday.
Photographs and other evidence
will be used to prosecute those
involved, either through the
Stanford Judicial Council or the
criminal courts.
Pitzer said that "there has not
been a decision" on the issue of
whether to prosecute students in
court or before the judicial
Council. "When (members of the
campus community) are closely
involved with non-Stanford
people, and when the police also
are involved," he added the only
equitable way may be to go to
court.
Nevertheless, the President did
reaffirm his preference for using
campus judicial mechanisms "as
much as possible."
"Illegal acts of violence are not
to be condoned," he said. "So far
as there is evidence of individuals
perpetrating such acts, they ought
to be punished."

Photographs of the
demonstration that disrupted the
Academic Council meeting a week
ago and of the demonstrations
Tuesday and Wednesday at the
ROTC-Athletic Building are being
held by the President's office and
members of the Stanford
community have been asked by
Pitzer to identify people in the
pictures.
Pitzer re-emphasized the
democratic nature of the decision
making process by which the
faculty voted to allow Army
ROTC to qualify for limited
credit. "To allow a small pressure
group to overturn that sort of
decision-making would be most
unfortunate to the University," he
said.

According to Don Price, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, the
University indirect subsidy of
ROTC last year amounted to
about $22,000 lor supply of
buildings and office services.
ROTC scholarships last year
amounted to about SI 45,000.

Criminal charges resulting from
this week's anti-ROTC
demonstrations will "no doubt"
be filed by the district attorney,
President Kenneth S. Pitzer said
yesterday.
Photographs and other evidence
will be used to prosecute those
involved, either through the
Stanford Judicial Council or the
criminal courts.
Pitzer said that "there has not
been a decision" on the issue of
whether to prosecute students in
court or before the judicial
Council. "When (members of the
campus community) are closely
involved with non-Stanford
people, and when the police also
are involved," he added the only
equitable way may be to go to
court.
Nevertheless, the President did
reaffirm his preference for using
campus judicial mechanisms "as
much as possible."
"Illegal acts of violence are not
to be condoned," he said. "So far
as there is evidence of individuals
perpetrating such acts, they ought
to be punished."

Photographs of the
demonstration that disrupted the
Academic Council meeting a week
ago and of the demonstrations
Tuesday and Wednesday at the
ROTC-Athletic Building are being
held by the President's office and
members of the Stanford
community have been asked by
Pitzer to identify people in the
pictures.
Pitzer re-emphasized the
democratic nature of the decision
making process by which the
faculty voted to allow Army
ROTC to qualify for limited
credit. "To allow a small pressure
group to overturn that sort of
decision-making would be most
unfortunate to the University," he
said.
When there is new evidence
with regard to ROTC, the
Academic Senate should
re-evaluate it's decision, Pitzer
added. But, "we ought to regard
this (the 1 ROTC decision) as
decided for this year."
Slii ilrn I R «■ pros en la I ion
He said that the key decision in
the Army ROTC issue was
primarily academic in nature and
so was the faculty's responsibility.

Student views wore represented,
according to Pitzer, through
student representation on the
President's advisory committee on
ROTC and last spring's student
referendum.
Pitzer stated however, that next
week's student ROTC referendum
would "certainly influence future
decisions in this area." The
peaceful march presently planned
for Monday night would be a
"perfectly legitimate element" of
expression, although the
"referendum would be a more
apt" view of student sentiment,
Pitzer said.
He added that at any time a
member of the faculty Senate
could introduce a new proposal
on ROTC.
Both the Navy and Air Force
are considering how much to
follow the plan of the Army here
at Stanford. Due to the small
enrollment in Air Force ROTC
and the small output in officers,
"the Air Force might decide not
to stay just on that basis, Pitzer
said.

The President noted that the
money Stanford uses to indirectly

subsidize the ROTC is "very
small." "There is a net financial
benefit to the University" when
this subsidy is compared to the
financial aid ROTC provides to
students. "There's no question
(that) elimination of ROTC would
have a direct, adverse effect on
funds," he added.
According to Don Price, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, the
University indirect subsidy of
