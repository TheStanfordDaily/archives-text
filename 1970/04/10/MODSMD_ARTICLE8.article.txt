# Inside Looking Out
## Effective Non-Violence 
### Dave Fidanque 
I think it is necessary to clarify the position of my affinity group
(the West Coast Motherfuckers), which appeared in Thursday's Daily
under the title "Why Rock Throwing," especially for those people
who feel violent tactics are wrong but are also against the presence of
ROTC on this campus.
It seems clear to me that the anti-ROTC movement is considered
more dangerous by the administration when it engages in non-violent
tactics than when it is throwing rocks. I think the events of the past
few days have shown this. As long as rocks are thrown, the
administration knows that they can justify any action they take. But
what most people don't realize is that the University is not trying to
stop property damage; it is engaging in overt repression.
The night of Thursday, April 2, between 800 and 1200 people
participated in a non-violent march around campus to show that they
were against the continued presence of ROTC at Stanford. The
administration's lack of response to th&t demonstration proves that
large non-violent action can be ignored by President Pitzer in the same
way it has been ignored in Washington by President Nixon. In
November half a million people marched non-violently in Washington
and another 100,000 marched in San Francisco. What was the
response from the White House? There has been none except to show
an increasing willingness to widen the Vietnam War into Laos and
Cambodia. When John Lindsay spoke on this campus a week ago he
counseled "patience," but how can we be "patient" when more
people are being killed in Southeast Asia every day?
The dilemma becomes one of showing that there is a limit to our
patience, without resorting to violence. The dilemma arises more
clearly every day because of the repression that originated in the
White House and Department of Justice and which is spreading every
day. It is not the repression of Huxley's Brave New World; it is much
more subtle than that. The repression that we can now see is an
attempt to equate non-violence with patience and apathy and to
equate effective non-violent action with property destruction and
more violent tactics.
Pitzer's Actions
Perhaps you can begin to see where President Pitzer's actions of the
past few days fit into this analysis. First, the use of last year's Encina
injunction: this injunction has, can be, and will be used to prevent the
peaceful occupation of any building on this campus. This means that
immediately the tactic of a non-violent sit-in is not available to us as
long as it has a chance of being effective, as was the Old-Union sit-in
t wo years ago and as was the AEL sit-in last year.
Thus, if we are to engage in peaceful tactics they must be on a
smaller scale than a sit-in if they are to be effective. This has been the
rationale behind most of the past week's tactics: the non-violent
visitation of the Academic Council one week ago, the non-violent
mill-in at the ROTC building on Tuesday, the non-violent mill-around
at the ROTC building on Wednesday afternoon. These tactics were
not only non-violent, they were also effective; and they were more
effective than throwing rocks because rocks didn't have any
immediate effect on the teaching of war at this University.
It is for this reason that the administration, and in particular
President Pitzer, has been taking all possible actions to attempt to
stop it. Let's take a look at his justification for violating the
Legislative and Judicial Charter. Why didn't he consult the SCLC
before he took emergency action Tuesday night? Because, "Contact
could have been merely for the purposes of notification, which
seemed to me (Pitzer) not what the Charter intends." Of course that
isn't what the Charter "intends"; it intends to stop any President of
this University from becoming a dictator who pays no attention to
wishes of faculty and students.
Lyman 's Justification
What was Provost Lyman's justification of freezing enrollment in
all ROTC classes? That: "This extraordinary step is made necessary by
the destructive events of the past week and by the explicitly
threatened further disruption of ROTC activities."
In other words, the threat of ROTC classes being stopped, or, even
worse, the attendance of those classes in a non-disruptive fashion
cannot be tolerated by those who have a stake in keeping ROTC on
this campus.
Well then, what can one that is anti-ROTC and non-violent do?
First, do not allow yourself to justify inaction by deploring the
throwing of rocks, because by not acting the only result will be that
more rocks will be thrown. At every meeting of the anti-ROTC
movement a wide range of tactics have been proposed. The more
people, the more non-violent the tactic decided upon. Contrary to

what many people believe the movement is not controlled by a small
number.of people; it is controlled by all of those present at meetings.
Slop Non-Violent Action?
The administration is attempting to stop all effective non violent
action. We must not let them because if they do they will accomplish
exactly what they claim they are trying to stop: they will drive the
movement underground where it will not die, it will onJy be more
difficult '■> deal with. By writing this article lam myself taking a
risk, as i believe everyone that is truly committed to effective
non-violent action must at this time. The University has indicated its
willingness to prosecute us. I feel an obligation to speak out and an
obligation to act. We must show President Pitzer that we will do just
that until ROTC is extinct, and until Stanford and the US are out of
Vietnam.

I think it is necessary to clarify the position of my affinity group
(the West Coast Motherfuckers), which appeared in Thursday's Daily
under the title "Why Rock Throwing," especially for those people
who feel violent tactics are wrong but are also against the presence of
ROTC on this campus.
It seems clear to me that the anti-ROTC movement is considered
more dangerous by the administration when it engages in non-violent
tactics than when it is throwing rocks. I think the events of the past
few days have shown this. As long as rocks are thrown, the
administration knows that they can justify any action they take. But
what most people don't realize is that the University is not trying to
stop property damage; it is engaging in overt repression.
The night of Thursday, April 2, between 800 and 1200 people
participated in a non-violent march around campus to show that they
were against the continued presence of ROTC at Stanford. The
administration's lack of response to th&t demonstration proves that
large non-violent action can be ignored by President Pitzer in the same
way it has been ignored in Washington by President Nixon. In
November half a million people marched non-violently in Washington
and another 100,000 marched in San Francisco. What was the
response from the White House? There has been none except to show
an increasing willingness to widen the Vietnam War into Laos and
Cambodia. When John Lindsay spoke on this campus a week ago he
counseled "patience," but how can we be "patient" when more
people are being killed in Southeast Asia every day?
The dilemma becomes one of showing that there is a limit to our
patience, without resorting to violence. The dilemma arises more
clearly every day because of the repression that originated in the
White House and Department of Justice and which is spreading every
day. It is not the repression of Huxley's Brave New World; it is much
more subtle than that. The repression that we can now see is an
attempt to equate non-violence with patience and apathy and to
equate effective non-violent action with property destruction and
more violent tactics.
Pitzer's Actions
Perhaps you can begin to see where President Pitzer's actions of the
past few days fit into this analysis. First, the use of last year's Encina
injunction: this injunction has, can be, and will be used to prevent the
peaceful occupation of any building on this campus. This means that
immediately the tactic of a non-violent sit-in is not available to us as
long as it has a chance of being effective, as was the Old-Union sit-in
t wo years ago and as was the AEL sit-in last year.
Thus, if we are to engage in peaceful tactics they must be on a
smaller scale than a sit-in if they are to be effective. This has been the
rationale behind most of the past week's tactics: the non-violent
visitation of the Academic Council one week ago, the non-violent
mill-in at the ROTC building on Tuesday, the non-violent mill-around
at the ROTC building on Wednesday afternoon. These tactics were
not only non-violent, they were also effective; and they were more
effective than throwing rocks because rocks didn't have any
immediate effect on the teaching of war at this University.
It is for this reason that the administration, and in particular
President Pitzer, has been taking all possible actions to attempt to
stop it. Let's take a look at his justification for violating the
Legislative and Judicial Charter. Why didn't he consult the SCLC
before he took emergency action Tuesday night? Because, "Contact
could have been merely for the purposes of notification, which
seemed to me (Pitzer) not what the Charter intends." Of course that
isn't what the Charter "intends"; it intends to stop any President of
this University from becoming a dictator who pays no attention to
wishes of faculty and students.
Lyman 's Justification
What was Provost Lyman's justification of freezing enrollment in
all ROTC classes? That: "This extraordinary step is made necessary by
the destructive events of the past week and by the explicitly
threatened further disruption of ROTC activities."
In other words, the threat of ROTC classes being stopped, or, even
worse, the attendance of those classes in a non-disruptive fashion
cannot be tolerated by those who have a stake in keeping ROTC on
this campus.
Well then, what can one that is anti-ROTC and non-violent do?
First, do not allow yourself to justify inaction by deploring the
throwing of rocks, because by not acting the only result will be that
more rocks will be thrown. At every meeting of the anti-ROTC
movement a wide range of tactics have been proposed. The more
people, the more non-violent the tactic decided upon. Contrary to

what many people believe the movement is not controlled by a small
number.of people; it is controlled by all of those present at meetings.
Slop Non-Violent Action?
The administration is attempting to stop all effective non violent
action. We must not let them because if they do they will accomplish
exactly what they claim they are trying to stop: they will drive the
movement underground where it will not die, it will onJy be more
difficult '■> deal with. By writing this article lam myself taking a
risk, as i believe everyone that is truly committed to effective
non-violent action must at this time. The University has indicated its
willingness to prosecute us. I feel an obligation to speak out and an
obligation to act. We must show President Pitzer that we will do just
that until ROTC is extinct, and until Stanford and the US are out of
Vietnam.

that until ROTC is extinct, and until Stanford and the US are out of
Vietnam.

I think it is necessary to clarify the position of my affinity group
(the West Coast Motherfuckers), which appeared in Thursday's Daily
under the title "Why Rock Throwing," especially for those people
who feel violent tactics are wrong but are also against the presence of
ROTC on this campus.
It seems clear to me that the anti-ROTC movement is considered
more dangerous by the administration when it engages in non-violent
tactics than when it is throwing rocks. I think the events of the past
few days have shown this. As long as rocks are thrown, the
administration knows that they can justify any action they take. But
what most people don't realize is that the University is not trying to
stop property damage; it is engaging in overt repression.
The night of Thursday, April 2, between 800 and 1200 people
participated in a non-violent march around campus to show that they
were against the continued presence of ROTC at Stanford. The
administration's lack of response to th&t demonstration proves that
large non-violent action can be ignored by President Pitzer in the same
way it has been ignored in Washington by President Nixon. In
November half a million people marched non-violently in Washington
and another 100,000 marched in San Francisco. What was the
response from the White House? There has been none except to show
an increasing willingness to widen the Vietnam War into Laos and
Cambodia. When John Lindsay spoke on this campus a week ago he
counseled "patience," but how can we be "patient" when more
people are being killed in Southeast Asia every day?
The dilemma becomes one of showing that there is a limit to our
patience, without resorting to violence. The dilemma arises more
clearly every day because of the repression that originated in the
White House and Department of Justice and which is spreading every
day. It is not the repression of Huxley's Brave New World; it is much
more subtle than that. The repression that we can now see is an
attempt to equate non-violence with patience and apathy and to
equate effective non-violent action with property destruction and
more violent tactics.
Pitzer's Actions
Perhaps you can begin to see where President Pitzer's actions of the
past few days fit into this analysis. First, the use of last year's Encina
injunction: this injunction has, can be, and will be used to prevent the
peaceful occupation of any building on this campus. This means that
immediately the tactic of a non-violent sit-in is not available to us as
long as it has a chance of being effective, as was the Old-Union sit-in
t wo years ago and as was the AEL sit-in last year.
Thus, if we are to engage in peaceful tactics they must be on a
smaller scale than a sit-in if they are to be effective. This has been the
rationale behind most of the past week's tactics: the non-violent
visitation of the Academic Council one week ago, the non-violent
mill-in at the ROTC building on Tuesday, the non-violent mill-around
at the ROTC building on Wednesday afternoon. These tactics were
not only non-violent, they were also effective; and they were more
effective than throwing rocks because rocks didn't have any
immediate effect on the teaching of war at this University.
It is for this reason that the administration, and in particular
President Pitzer, has been taking all possible actions to attempt to
stop it. Let's take a look at his justification for violating the
Legislative and Judicial Charter. Why didn't he consult the SCLC
before he took emergency action Tuesday night? Because, "Contact
could have been merely for the purposes of notification, which
seemed to me (Pitzer) not what the Charter intends." Of course that
isn't what the Charter "intends"; it intends to stop any President of
this University from becoming a dictator who pays no attention to
wishes of faculty and students.
Lyman 's Justification
What was Provost Lyman's justification of freezing enrollment in
all ROTC classes? That: "This extraordinary step is made necessary by
the destructive events of the past week and by the explicitly
threatened further disruption of ROTC activities."
In other words, the threat of ROTC classes being stopped, or, even
worse, the attendance of those classes in a non-disruptive fashion
cannot be tolerated by those who have a stake in keeping ROTC on
this campus.
Well then, what can one that is anti-ROTC and non-violent do?
First, do not allow yourself to justify inaction by deploring the
throwing of rocks, because by not acting the only result will be that
more rocks will be thrown. At every meeting of the anti-ROTC
movement a wide range of tactics have been proposed. The more
people, the more non-violent the tactic decided upon. Contrary to

what many people believe the movement is not controlled by a small
number.of people; it is controlled by all of those present at meetings.
Slop Non-Violent Action?
The administration is attempting to stop all effective non violent
action. We must not let them because if they do they will accomplish
exactly what they claim they are trying to stop: they will drive the
movement underground where it will not die, it will onJy be more
difficult '■> deal with. By writing this article lam myself taking a
risk, as i believe everyone that is truly committed to effective
non-violent action must at this time. The University has indicated its
willingness to prosecute us. I feel an obligation to speak out and an
obligation to act. We must show President Pitzer that we will do just
that until ROTC is extinct, and until Stanford and the US are out of
Vietnam.
