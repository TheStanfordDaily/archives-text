# US War Machine
## A 						Rational Way To Off ROTC By Gary Reid 
### 
The ROTC issue on campus has
caused me to have serious doubts
as to the efficacy of certain tactics
and characteristic attitudes of the
New Left, (which I should really
call the radicals or
revolutionaries), which 1 either
failed to grasp or believe before or
tried to condone. There are two
basic areas of the ROTC issue that
I think should be clearly
understood, both separately and
as they tie together. First there is
a ethical question as to whether
ROTC should be allowed at
Stanford; and second, there is the
question as to what sort of means
should be used to remove ROTC
should our answer to the first
question be that ROTC should
not exist at Stanford.
Should ROTC Exist?
Let's look at these separately:
(1) Should ROTC be allowed to
exist at Stanford? What exactly
are the reasons given for wanting
to abolish ROTC? The primary
line of argument seems to be this -
ROTC is a part of the US
war-machine. In order to stop war
completely, we must eliminate the
tool by which war is propagated.

Therefore, we eliminate ROTC
and work up the line, eventually
eliminating the entire machine.
There are various peripheral
reasons tor joining the movement
(such as, to do away with the
unfair punitive clause in ROTC
cadet contracts), but these only
touch on the main argument.
There seem to be two basic
reasons why the US war-machine
is held to be immoral. (1) It is
immoral to the rest of the world
because it propagates wars which
oppress, kill, take advantage of,
etc., the rest of the world. (2) It is
immoral to American males
between the ages of 18 and 35
because it forces them to serve in
a particular organization whether
they choose to or not, and just to
make sure that that point is
brought home, organization
oppresses not only those who
fight against it but also those who
are members of it (this was quite
well explained and documented
by the anonymous cadet who
wrote an article on the editorial
page of the Wednesday, April 8
Daily).
War Machine
Let's grant the validity of the

statement that the US
War-machine is immoral to the
rest of the world on the basis of
the Vietnam (and now Laos and
Cambodia) war, but with
reservations. Those reservations
are that, in fact, our actions in
Southeast Asia may be immoral,
but that doesn't imply that our
military actions everywhere in the
world are immoral. As a matter of
fact, it is not too difficult to find
particular instances where our
military power has been used
morally and wisely - witness WW
11, and the Cuban crisis under JFK
(despite certain reservations we
may have about some of our other
activities in Cuba, not to mention
the rest of South and Central
America).
So, we are assuming that the
war-machine has a tendency to
perpetrate immoral actions. But
already I can hear the radical
screaming back at me that it's not
just a tendency, it is the very
nature of the armed forces to do
immoral things, i.e., to kill. When
he says that, he is missing my
point. Killing is immoral, but
most people would agree (myself
included) that we had to go to
war in WW 11. There are situations
in which our only choice lies
between two ostensibly immoral
acts. How we decide which act to
choose is open to question, but
we must choose and we must do
one of the two. The radicals, in
fact, use this same argument in
their justification of their own
violent tactics.
Profit Motive
Assumedly, something more is
meant in saying that it is the very
nature of the war-machine to
perpetrate immoral acts the
fact that killing is incurred in the
course of its activities.
Presumably, what is meant is that
this killing is generally unjustified.
By this, I think that what is meant
is the idea that the military is only
part of a system (namely,
capitalism) which must necessarily
lead to unjustified killing. The
idea is that the basic motive for
action of any significant sort

under capitalism is the incentive,
which thereby bypasses other
ithical considerations.
With this in mind, we can put
the argument briefly: war creates
profits in war-related industries,
who consequently grow and
therefore exert more influence on
government policy, and since they
see was as necessary for their own
monetary well-being, they exert
into a vicious spiral in which more
war leads to more profits leads to
more war etc.
If this is the view that is being
espoused by the person who says
that the US war-machine must be
eliminated, then we can see that
not only is the mil iary a small
part of this machine, but it is a
part in the same sense that a pair
of scissors is a part of the barber's
trade. The scissors (military) are
only a tool, and as such exercise
no influence over the way they
are used and to what purpose. The
real source of the activity is the
barber (capitalism, or more
explicitly , the supremacy of the
profit motive in American life).
This analogy is apt although it
misses some of the finer
complexities, such as the fact that
the military does have some
influence over the way it is used -
nevertheless, I find the analogy
useful in pointing out the futility
of eliminating one pair of scissors,
or for that matter, all scissors. If
you steal the barber's pair of
scissors he will merely but another
pair (comparable to eliminating
ROTC at Stanford). On the other
hand, if you eliminate all scissors,
he'll find some other tool such as
electric razors or straight-edges
(comparable to eliminating the
armed forces - that is to say, if
profit seekers can't take advantage
of underdeveloped countries
through war, they will simply do
so in other ways - witness the
United Fruit Co.)
What is needed, if the almighty
profit motive is indeed the source
of all this injustice, is some way to
eliminate or at least put the profit
motive in its proper place. That is
a much deeper problem than

ROTC, which is at best a fourth
generation problem. (1 • profit
motive, 2 - business' power over
government, 3 - government use
of military as a result of that
pressure, 1 • ROTC as a part of
that military)
Draft lin in oral
But now let's look at the
second reason given for
considering the war-machine (now
in the restricted sense of 'the
military') immoral - i.e., the fact
that it forces males between the
ages of 19 and 35 to join whether
they want to or not. This charge
is, I think quite valid, although
trying to prove it is a rather
difficult matter.
What does it mean to say that
one is forced to do something
against his will? What do we say
to the fact that most people are
forced to work in order to survive
whether they want to or not?
Generally one is not forced to do
something just for the sake of
doing that. The justification of
some action which must be done
is some other thing, state, activity,
et al., which can only be attained
by doing the forst thing. One
can't survive without eating. One
can't get food to eat without
money. Hence one must get
money, then one must get food,
then one must eat that food in
order to survive.
But how does military service
fit into this? The normal
justification of compulsory
military service is that each person
owes his country a debt - is
converted into two year's military
service among other things. This
justification is weak since it is by
no means clear that only males
between the ages of 19 and 35
owe this, nor that the debt for
these people must necessarily be
military service.
From these and other
considerations it becomes
increasingly clear that compulsory
military service is practically and
ethically wrong and should be
eliminated. The question is how
should this be accomplished?
