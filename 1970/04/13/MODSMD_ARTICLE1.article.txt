# Broken Window Costs Mount Over $15,000
## 
### 
Windows smashed by
rock- throwing anti-ROTC
protesters will cost Stanford "in
excess of $15,000," according to
University Security Manager
Bruce Wiggins.
Repair estimates for many of
the 34 windows broken in the
Aero-Astro building run close to
$200 per window. The order to
replace windows broken there and
in President Pitzer's office last
Monday night has not yet been
given. The windows remain taped.
Some of the large tinted
windows broken in the Lou Henry
Hoover building on March 31st,
the first night of anti-ROTC
related rock throwing, cost as
much as $400 per window to
replace, Wiggins reported.
In addition to replacing broken
windows, Stanford will have to
pay its police over $800 in

overtime pay for the period from
March 31st to April 9th.
Sergeant Don Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department revealed that the
Sheriff's Dept. has spent aboirt
$10,500 through last Thursday in
sending deputies to Stanford
demonstrations. The cost of
sending several busloads of police
here averages $2500 per night,
Tamm said. Police units from San
Jose and Palo Alto have also been
called to campus in the past 10
days, but their expenses have not
been reported.
Although it is too early to tell,
an alumni backlash reaction to
militant demonstrations and the
administration's handling of the
current situation may prove
extremely costly to Stanford.
Exactly how costly is impossible
to determine, according to Darrell

Pearson, General Secretary of the
University.
"There's no way anyone can
put a dollar sign on it. I can say
with definite assurance that we
would receive more money in
gifts, but I can't say how much "
Contributions from "living
persons"—the vast majority of
them alumni—constitute over 25
percent of Stanford's gift income.
The remainder comes from
corporations, bequests, and
foundations.
Determination of the effect of
student demonstrations on alumni
giving cannot be determined
because of a number of
factors —increased participation in
fund drives, decline of the market
value, and the impossibility of
knowing who would have
contributed but did not because
of demonstrations.
