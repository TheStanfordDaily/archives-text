## ASSU Voluntary 
### 
We are running for President
and Vice-President in order to
abolish the ASSU. Unlike our
opponents whocomeforward with
a variety of programs and
proposals to demonstrate that
they are the best qualified people
to assume the mantle of power
and responsibility, all we have to
offer is the analysis that real
student power, energy and
creativity exists in a wide variety
of voluntary student organizations
and not in the ASSU. We propose
that ASSU membership be made
voluntary as a first step to
restricting its functions and to
that end we urge that students
vote for the Liberty Amendment
to the ASSU Constitution which
will appear on the ballot this
week.
In the past, the ASSU has been
used as a vehicle by radical
students and non-students to
facilitate their attacks against
Stanford and its resources. This
year, despite a new constitution
and the most effective chairman
of the Senate that this campus has
had in the past five years, student
government has remained a
playground for liberals and
radicals who care little for the
needs and sensibilities of the vast
number of students that find
themselves excluded from the
ASSU power structure. For most
students at Stanford, particularly
in the graduate division, ASSU is
irrelevant and does nothing for
them.
We strongly feel that the only
function which the ASSU should
perform is the conducting of
elections to insure student
representation on various
University committees. Every
other service which the ASSU
allegedly provides should either be
eliminated, placed in the hands of
voluntary organizations or
financed voluntarily by other
sectors of the community. If
elected, we plan to pay for the
cost of conducting student
elections by franchising the one
service the ASSU offers that
makes a profit and pleases the
largest number of people: the
Sunday Flicks.
Radical Alternative
Our candidacy offers a radical
alternative to the student body.
Now they have a choice between
those who need the prestige of the
ASSU Presidency for their
graduate school applications and
offer reforms and our ticket
which says that student
government is inherently
bureaucratic, unrepresentative,

inefficient and impotent and
ought to be dispensed with. We
would like to see all student
organizations, fraternities and
other living groups freed from the
constraints that the ASSU
Student Organizations Fund, with
whom they are compelled to
bank, currently imposes on their
finances. We would like to see the
Stanford Daily become
independent of ASSU or
Administration support.
We strongly support the ideal
of the University remaining an
open and free campus and
maintain that the greatest threat
to that ideal comes from the
rampaging radical mobs that have
plagued Stanford over the past
two weeks. We believe in the right
of the ROTC program to exist on
campus with appropriate credit
for its courses as long as there are
Stanford students who wish to
participate in such a program. We
support the principle of open job
recruiting on the Stanford
campus. We would point out that
we are the only candidates who
have taken a firm stand in support
of these principles and have been
actively opposing the violence and
destruction directed at the
University.
Our belief is that people do
best what they do for themselves.
Student government at Stanford
does not serve the interests or
needs of the majority of students.
The large number of voluntary
organizations do perform that
function. The question is, what
would we do without ASSU? Our
answer: Anything we want!

offer is the analysis that real
student power, energy and
creativity exists in a wide variety
of voluntary student organizations
and not in the ASSU. We propose
that ASSU membership be made
voluntary as a first step to
restricting its functions and to
that end we urge that students
vote for the Liberty Amendment
to the ASSU Constitution which
will appear on the ballot this
week.
In the past, the ASSU has been
used as a vehicle by radical
students and non-students to
facilitate their attacks against
Stanford and its resources. This
year, despite a new constitution
and the most effective chairman
of the Senate that this campus has
had in the past five years, student
government has remained a
playground for liberals and
radicals who care little for the
needs and sensibilities of the vast
number of students that find
themselves excluded from the
ASSU power structure. For most
students at Stanford, particularly
in the graduate division, ASSU is
irrelevant and does nothing for
them.
We strongly feel that the only
function which the ASSU should
perform is the conducting of
elections to insure student
representation on various
University committees. Every
other service which the ASSU
allegedly provides should either be
eliminated, placed in the hands of
voluntary organizations or
financed voluntarily by other
sectors of the community. If
elected, we plan to pay for the
cost of conducting student
elections by franchising the one
service the ASSU offers that
makes a profit and pleases the
largest number of people: the
Sunday Flicks.
Radical Alternative
Our candidacy offers a radical
alternative to the student body.
Now they have a choice between
those who need the prestige of the
ASSU Presidency for their
graduate school applications and
offer reforms and our ticket
which says that student
government is inherently
bureaucratic, unrepresentative,

inefficient and impotent and
ought to be dispensed with. We
would like to see all student
organizations, fraternities and
other living groups freed from the
constraints that the ASSU
Student Organizations Fund, with
whom they are compelled to
bank, currently imposes on their
finances. We would like to see the
Stanford Daily become
independent of ASSU or
Administration support.
We strongly support the ideal
of the University remaining an
open and free campus and
maintain that the greatest threat
to that ideal comes from the
rampaging radical mobs that have
plagued Stanford over the past
two weeks. We believe in the right
of the ROTC program to exist on
campus with appropriate credit
for its courses as long as there are
Stanford students who wish to
participate in such a program. We
support the principle of open job
recruiting on the Stanford
campus. We would point out that
we are the only candidates who
have taken a firm stand in support
of these principles and have been
actively opposing the violence and
destruction directed at the
University.
Our belief is that people do
best what they do for themselves.
Student government at Stanford
does not serve the interests or
needs of the majority of students.
The large number of voluntary
organizations do perform that
function. The question is, what
would we do without ASSU? Our
answer: Anything we want!


Pal Shea, Bob (iranl (top), Hal IVlickt'lsoii, and Adam Levin
We are running for President
and Vice-President in order to
abolish the ASSU. Unlike our
opponents whocomeforward with
a variety of programs and
proposals to demonstrate that
they are the best qualified people
to assume the mantle of power
and responsibility, all we have to
offer is the analysis that real
student power, energy and
creativity exists in a wide variety
