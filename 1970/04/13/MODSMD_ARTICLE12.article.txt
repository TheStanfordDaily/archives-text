# Shea, Grant, Mickelson, Levin
## Raze The ‘Political Stadium ’ 
### 
The emphasis in the Shea/Grant/Mickelson/
Levin platform is on freeing the ASSU from some
of its political stadium aspects and making it more
of a service organization for students.
We have spoken during the campaign about
ASSU involvement in academic reform and
innovation and about the nonpolitical need for
more live, on-campus, entertainment and cultural
programs. At the same time, we have recognized
that the ASSU must be concerned with critical,
controversial issues facing the University and its
students—issues like R.O.T.C. and land use policy.
The Quiet ASSU
The ASSU Executive has worked hard this year
to provide a number of student services without
publicity or fanfare.
SWOPSI was able to get off the ground because
the Council of Presidents, among others, devoted a
great deal of time to it. A student-compiled
evaluation of courses and professors—covering 225
offerings was prepared through the energy of the
Council.
We believe that these efforts should be
expanded. The pressure on candidates in this
election to offer "something new" to voters
should not force this year's achievements to be
swept under the rug.
We are committed to increasing ASSU activity
in the realm of academic reform. Over 75% of the
reports of the Study of Education at Stanford
have not been acted upon. Our approach to this
problem is not to reissue these reports as if they
were our own ideas, but rather to commit
ourselves to support trustee/faculty/ student
committees which are already considering the
proposals. The ASSU Committee on Nominations
placed more than 75 students on more than thirty
University committees; the ASSU Executive not
only chairs this committee, but should coordinate
and publicize the work of its appointees.
Even ts
Offerings of ASSU-sponsored entertainment
and cultural events this year have been dismal.
With the projected demise of SRT, the future
prospect for the arts at Stanford is more dismal
still.
Any entertainment or concert series requires a
large amount of money initially. This year, the
ASSU Special Events Board has had $2900 to
work with; groups like Creedence or Blood, Sweat
and Tears get over $15,000 against a percentage
for a performance, and ask half their guarantee in
advance. When outside promoters are invited on
campus, high prices (the Ray Charles and Bill
Cosby shows) inevitably result.
We endorse the ASSU Special Events
Proposition as a remedy for this state of affairs.
The Proposition would provide $40,000 as initial
funding for an enlarged Special Events program
next year; the program would in future years
become entirely self-supporting.
It is. incidentally, mistaken to assert that the
Special Events Board is now in debt (limited
though its budget has been). The meaning of
"accounts receivable" has been misunderstood in
some quarters: $11,000 is owed to the Special
Events Board,bv not the Special Events Board.
ROTC
Most students on this campus are opposed to
the war in Vietnam and are concerned about the
pervasive military influence in this country. We
number ourselves among this group. But we are
not dictators or philosopher-kings who can impose
these beliefs upon other individuals in the
community.
The United States says to its young men that
they have a "military obligation." Different
individuals face this legal prescription in different
ways. Some enlist in the army, some wait for the
draft, some declare conscientious objection or
choose to resist the system.

We do not believe that the elimination of
ROTC as an alternative on the Stanford campus
would serve the interests of students facing this
dilemma.
This is not to say that there are no problems in
the ROTC program at Stanford. Punitive clauses
must be eliminated from financial assistance
contracts; an Act of Congress is necessary to effect
this reform. The University must cease giving
ROTC an indirect subsidy by the free provision of
office space and classrooms; the Department of
Defense is richer than the University, and ought to
bear its full share of the cost of these facilities.
The present proposal for academic credit for
ROTC is not, in our judgment, a sound one; it too
clearly pre-supposes the academic merit of courses
under consideration.
Land Use Policy
The University has signed the lease for the
Dillingham project. It is legally bound to permit
the development.
We think there is nothing to be gained by
beating the dead horse of Dillingham. Rather, the
University, and with it the ASSU, should direct
attention to other land use problems before they,
too, are irrevocably decided.
For example: Jasper Ridge is endangered by the
plans of San Mateo County to transform it into a
public recreational park. Students who have taken
directed research on the Ridge find it difficult to
imagine the area paved with parking lots and
provided with sandboxes and baseball diamonds.
The area is a unique example of California
wilderness, and ought to be preserved in its present
form. But in order to assure this, the student voice
will have to be heard at a dozen zoning and
condemnation hearings.
Graduate Student Problems
We have issued a position paper on the
problems of graduate and professional students
within the University. Bob Grant, as a married
law/business student, living in Escondido, is
especially qualified to attack these problems. He
has discussed matters like the Child Care Center,
graduate housing questions, and the desireability
of graduate participation in the overseas program.
The ASSU should work more closely with
divisional associations in engineering, the Law
School, and so forth—to avoid duplication of
effort or mutual ignorance of mutally beneficial
programs.
Division of Responsibility
The strength of a Council of Presidents is its
potential for flexibility and specialization. We have
arranged the following division of executive
responsibility among ourselves: If we are elected,
Patrick C. Shea would handle alumni and trustee
relations, university governance, and coordination
of the Executive and staff.
Hal Mickelson would sit as Chairman of the
Committee on Nominations, and on the Academic
Council and Senate; his general province would be
academic reform.
Adam Levin would continue his present
concern with ASSU student services, such as the
Special Events program and the management of
office facilities for clubs, boards, and commissions.
Bob Grant, as we have said, would be
concerned with the problems of graduate students;
he would also be our spokesman on questions of
University finance and land development.
We believe that we offer the necessary expertise
and background to fill these and other Executive
responsibilities effectively. We also believe that we
have presented a program which reflects the needs
and concerns of all students on the campus. The
ASSU must be respected by its student
membership if it is to be respected by those to
whom it speaks in other constituencies.
The emphasis in the Shea/Grant/Mickelson/
Levin platform is on freeing the ASSU from some
of its political stadium aspects and making it more
of a service organization for students.

University finance and land development.
We believe that we offer the necessary expertise
and background to fill these and other Executive
responsibilities effectively. We also believe that we
have presented a program which reflects the needs
and concerns of all students on the campus. The
ASSU must be respected by its student
membership if it is to be respected by those to
whom it speaks in other constituencies.
The emphasis in the Shea/Grant/Mickelson/
Levin platform is on freeing the ASSU from some
of its political stadium aspects and making it more
of a service organization for students.
We have spoken during the campaign about
ASSU involvement in academic reform and
innovation and about the nonpolitical need for
more live, on-campus, entertainment and cultural
programs. At the same time, we have recognized
that the ASSU must be concerned with critical,
controversial issues facing the University and its
students—issues like R.O.T.C. and land use policy.
The Quiet ASSU
The ASSU Executive has worked hard this year
to provide a number of student services without
publicity or fanfare.
SWOPSI was able to get off the ground because
the Council of Presidents, among others, devoted a
great deal of time to it. A student-compiled
evaluation of courses and professors—covering 225
offerings was prepared through the energy of the
Council.
We believe that these efforts should be
expanded. The pressure on candidates in this
election to offer "something new" to voters
should not force this year's achievements to be
swept under the rug.
We are committed to increasing ASSU activity
in the realm of academic reform. Over 75% of the
reports of the Study of Education at Stanford
have not been acted upon. Our approach to this
problem is not to reissue these reports as if they
were our own ideas, but rather to commit
ourselves to support trustee/faculty/ student
committees which are already considering the
proposals. The ASSU Committee on Nominations
placed more than 75 students on more than thirty
University committees; the ASSU Executive not
only chairs this committee, but should coordinate
and publicize the work of its appointees.
Even ts
Offerings of ASSU-sponsored entertainment
and cultural events this year have been dismal.
With the projected demise of SRT, the future
prospect for the arts at Stanford is more dismal
still.
Any entertainment or concert series requires a
large amount of money initially. This year, the
ASSU Special Events Board has had $2900 to
work with; groups like Creedence or Blood, Sweat
and Tears get over $15,000 against a percentage
for a performance, and ask half their guarantee in
advance. When outside promoters are invited on
campus, high prices (the Ray Charles and Bill
Cosby shows) inevitably result.
We endorse the ASSU Special Events
Proposition as a remedy for this state of affairs.
The Proposition would provide $40,000 as initial
funding for an enlarged Special Events program
next year; the program would in future years
become entirely self-supporting.
It is. incidentally, mistaken to assert that the
Special Events Board is now in debt (limited
though its budget has been). The meaning of
"accounts receivable" has been misunderstood in
some quarters: $11,000 is owed to the Special
Events Board,bv not the Special Events Board.
ROTC
Most students on this campus are opposed to
the war in Vietnam and are concerned about the
pervasive military influence in this country. We
number ourselves among this group. But we are
not dictators or philosopher-kings who can impose
these beliefs upon other individuals in the
community.
The United States says to its young men that
they have a "military obligation." Different
individuals face this legal prescription in different
ways. Some enlist in the army, some wait for the
draft, some declare conscientious objection or
choose to resist the system.

We do not believe that the elimination of
ROTC as an alternative on the Stanford campus
would serve the interests of students facing this
dilemma.
This is not to say that there are no problems in
the ROTC program at Stanford. Punitive clauses
must be eliminated from financial assistance
contracts; an Act of Congress is necessary to effect
this reform. The University must cease giving
ROTC an indirect subsidy by the free provision of
office space and classrooms; the Department of
Defense is richer than the University, and ought to
bear its full share of the cost of these facilities.
The present proposal for academic credit for
ROTC is not, in our judgment, a sound one; it too
clearly pre-supposes the academic merit of courses
under consideration.
Land Use Policy
The University has signed the lease for the
Dillingham project. It is legally bound to permit
the development.
We think there is nothing to be gained by
beating the dead horse of Dillingham. Rather, the
University, and with it the ASSU, should direct
attention to other land use problems before they,
too, are irrevocably decided.
For example: Jasper Ridge is endangered by the
plans of San Mateo County to transform it into a
public recreational park. Students who have taken
directed research on the Ridge find it difficult to
imagine the area paved with parking lots and
provided with sandboxes and baseball diamonds.
The area is a unique example of California
wilderness, and ought to be preserved in its present
form. But in order to assure this, the student voice
will have to be heard at a dozen zoning and
condemnation hearings.
Graduate Student Problems
We have issued a position paper on the
problems of graduate and professional students
within the University. Bob Grant, as a married
law/business student, living in Escondido, is
especially qualified to attack these problems. He
has discussed matters like the Child Care Center,
graduate housing questions, and the desireability
of graduate participation in the overseas program.
The ASSU should work more closely with
divisional associations in engineering, the Law
School, and so forth—to avoid duplication of
effort or mutual ignorance of mutally beneficial
programs.
Division of Responsibility
The strength of a Council of Presidents is its
potential for flexibility and specialization. We have
arranged the following division of executive
responsibility among ourselves: If we are elected,
Patrick C. Shea would handle alumni and trustee
relations, university governance, and coordination
of the Executive and staff.
Hal Mickelson would sit as Chairman of the
Committee on Nominations, and on the Academic
Council and Senate; his general province would be
academic reform.
Adam Levin would continue his present
concern with ASSU student services, such as the
Special Events program and the management of
office facilities for clubs, boards, and commissions.
Bob Grant, as we have said, would be
concerned with the problems of graduate students;
he would also be our spokesman on questions of
University finance and land development.
We believe that we offer the necessary expertise
and background to fill these and other Executive

Council and Senate; his general province would be
academic reform.
Adam Levin would continue his present
concern with ASSU student services, such as the
Special Events program and the management of
office facilities for clubs, boards, and commissions.
Bob Grant, as we have said, would be
concerned with the problems of graduate students;
he would also be our spokesman on questions of
University finance and land development.
We believe that we offer the necessary expertise
and background to fill these and other Executive
responsibilities effectively. We also believe that we
have presented a program which reflects the needs
and concerns of all students on the campus. The
ASSU must be respected by its student
membership if it is to be respected by those to
whom it speaks in other constituencies.
The emphasis in the Shea/Grant/Mickelson/
Levin platform is on freeing the ASSU from some
of its political stadium aspects and making it more
of a service organization for students.
We have spoken during the campaign about
ASSU involvement in academic reform and
innovation and about the nonpolitical need for
more live, on-campus, entertainment and cultural
programs. At the same time, we have recognized
that the ASSU must be concerned with critical,
controversial issues facing the University and its
students—issues like R.O.T.C. and land use policy.
The Quiet ASSU
The ASSU Executive has worked hard this year
to provide a number of student services without
publicity or fanfare.
SWOPSI was able to get off the ground because
the Council of Presidents, among others, devoted a
great deal of time to it. A student-compiled
evaluation of courses and professors—covering 225
offerings was prepared through the energy of the
Council.
We believe that these efforts should be
expanded. The pressure on candidates in this
election to offer "something new" to voters
should not force this year's achievements to be
swept under the rug.
We are committed to increasing ASSU activity
in the realm of academic reform. Over 75% of the
reports of the Study of Education at Stanford
have not been acted upon. Our approach to this
problem is not to reissue these reports as if they
were our own ideas, but rather to commit
ourselves to support trustee/faculty/ student
committees which are already considering the
proposals. The ASSU Committee on Nominations
placed more than 75 students on more than thirty
University committees; the ASSU Executive not
only chairs this committee, but should coordinate
and publicize the work of its appointees.
Even ts
Offerings of ASSU-sponsored entertainment
and cultural events this year have been dismal.
With the projected demise of SRT, the future
prospect for the arts at Stanford is more dismal
still.
Any entertainment or concert series requires a
large amount of money initially. This year, the
ASSU Special Events Board has had $2900 to
work with; groups like Creedence or Blood, Sweat
and Tears get over $15,000 against a percentage
for a performance, and ask half their guarantee in
advance. When outside promoters are invited on
campus, high prices (the Ray Charles and Bill
Cosby shows) inevitably result.
We endorse the ASSU Special Events
Proposition as a remedy for this state of affairs.
The Proposition would provide $40,000 as initial
funding for an enlarged Special Events program
next year; the program would in future years
become entirely self-supporting.
It is. incidentally, mistaken to assert that the
Special Events Board is now in debt (limited
though its budget has been). The meaning of
"accounts receivable" has been misunderstood in
some quarters: $11,000 is owed to the Special
Events Board,bv not the Special Events Board.
ROTC
Most students on this campus are opposed to
the war in Vietnam and are concerned about the
pervasive military influence in this country. We
number ourselves among this group. But we are
not dictators or philosopher-kings who can impose
these beliefs upon other individuals in the
community.
The United States says to its young men that
they have a "military obligation." Different
individuals face this legal prescription in different
ways. Some enlist in the army, some wait for the
draft, some declare conscientious objection or
choose to resist the system.

We do not believe that the elimination of
ROTC as an alternative on the Stanford campus
would serve the interests of students facing this
dilemma.
This is not to say that there are no problems in
the ROTC program at Stanford. Punitive clauses
must be eliminated from financial assistance
contracts; an Act of Congress is necessary to effect
this reform. The University must cease giving
ROTC an indirect subsidy by the free provision of
office space and classrooms; the Department of
Defense is richer than the University, and ought to
bear its full share of the cost of these facilities.
The present proposal for academic credit for
ROTC is not, in our judgment, a sound one; it too
clearly pre-supposes the academic merit of courses
under consideration.
Land Use Policy
The University has signed the lease for the
Dillingham project. It is legally bound to permit
the development.
We think there is nothing to be gained by
beating the dead horse of Dillingham. Rather, the
University, and with it the ASSU, should direct
attention to other land use problems before they,
too, are irrevocably decided.
For example: Jasper Ridge is endangered by the
plans of San Mateo County to transform it into a
public recreational park. Students who have taken
directed research on the Ridge find it difficult to
imagine the area paved with parking lots and
provided with sandboxes and baseball diamonds.
The area is a unique example of California
wilderness, and ought to be preserved in its present
form. But in order to assure this, the student voice
will have to be heard at a dozen zoning and
condemnation hearings.
Graduate Student Problems
We have issued a position paper on the
problems of graduate and professional students
within the University. Bob Grant, as a married
law/business student, living in Escondido, is
especially qualified to attack these problems. He
has discussed matters like the Child Care Center,
graduate housing questions, and the desireability
of graduate participation in the overseas program.
The ASSU should work more closely with
divisional associations in engineering, the Law
School, and so forth—to avoid duplication of
effort or mutual ignorance of mutally beneficial
programs.
Division of Responsibility
The strength of a Council of Presidents is its
potential for flexibility and specialization. We have
arranged the following division of executive
responsibility among ourselves: If we are elected,
Patrick C. Shea would handle alumni and trustee
relations, university governance, and coordination
of the Executive and staff.
Hal Mickelson would sit as Chairman of the
Committee on Nominations, and on the Academic
Council and Senate; his general province would be
academic reform.
Adam Levin would continue his present
concern with ASSU student services, such as the
Special Events program and the management of
office facilities for clubs, boards, and commissions.
