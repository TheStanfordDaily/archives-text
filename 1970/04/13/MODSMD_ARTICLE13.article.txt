# Mattson, Cory, Beam: New Programs
## 
### 
In the past three years, the ASSU Presidency has
shown itself to be ineffective in meeting University crises.
It is shackled by minimal executive authority and
negligible student support. Student government has
become an advisory board with no power to effect
legfitimate student concerns.
The ASSU has lost contact with the majority of its
students to the extent that a voluntary ASSU is a popular
proposal. The ASSU must move in a new direction if it is
not to be continually bypassed by concerned interest
groups seeking necessary changes. We have learned that
CONCERN INVOLVES ACTION and that students will
direct their efforts outside provided channels if those
channels remain impotent. We offer a mechanism whereby
student government will be able to gain credibility as a
valid channel of expression: a FACULTY STUDENT
ADMINISTRATION COUNCIL (FSAC).
A frustrating reality at this campus for those in student
government is the enormous bureacracy through which
any legitimate concern must pass. Problems confronting
the whole University are lost in overlapping committees,
faculty politics or the tactic of "benign neglect." The
FSAC will act as an appeal board from the student Senate.
Any pressing proposal which is passed through the Senate
by a 2/3 vote can be sent to the FSAC. If the proposal is
passed by this council by a majority vote, IT IS SENT TO
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY AND MUST
BE ACTED UPON WITHIN If) DAYS.
The FSAC will provide the ASSU with an instrument
to see ideas acted upon and problems met before they
reach crisis proportion. It can be implemented through
the Committee of 15; not only will the C-15 obtain a
long-needed legitimacy-community decision-making will
become a reality at Stanford.
SI'.S Action I'rposal
A year ago, the Study of Education at Stanford was
released. Its suggestions for community-town living, co-op
stores and housing, student services, and community
government represented potentially the most important
changes at Stanford since the radical General Studies
revisions of the mid-fifties. Since its release, the SES
Report has been tragically neglected. Powerful members
of th« faculty, have dragged their heels in implementing
specific proposals. If the programs of SES are ever to be
realized, faculty-student co-operation will be necessary.
To this end. we propose an SES IMPLEMENTATION

BOARD. This Board will be composed of five students
and five faculty members. Next year the SES Board will
concentrate its efforts on the realization of two or three
of the SES proposals. Other original ideas, such as the
Student Center, will be continued until they are fully
realized. Among various proposals are:
STUDENT CO-OP— A student-run store to serve the
community in ways which the Bookstore and our
high-priced drugstore cannot. SES also proposed that
other shops be brought onto the campus to create
community living here and to provide competition for
institutions now monopolizing student trade.
ri'TORIAL COLLEGE- Similar to the program at
Yale, graduate students submit through their departments
courses they would like to teach. Academic credit would
be given, and classes would be limited to 5 or 6 students.
Not only would students enjoy the advantage of small
seminar-like classes, but graduates and undergraduates will
be able to interact on a greater level than is now possible.
LAW COMMUNE- Through the Law School a program
can be developed whereby students can receive free legal
aid, whether on questions of rent exploitation or criminal
charges.
CHILI) I) A CAKE CENTER-Providing supervision of
students' children while the former attend classes.
Crisis In Community
We feel the problem at Stanford this spring is not
ROTC, mindless violence, or the failure of student
government to provide a direction for the issues. The
problem is one of a fragmanted university and its lack of
community. Crisis seems to be the only stimulus for
community. Last year it was SRI, this year it is ROTC and
violence. Faculty finally begin to talk with students, and
students begin to talk with each other. This "instant
communication" is a warped idea of community. We must
begin to develop a consciousness of community apart
from the superficial consciousness produced by a
University crisis. To this end, we propose in addition to a
Fall Symposium and Faculty-dinner-Program, a Students
Park.
Gather and Talk
Wr wish to take the lot across from the Beta House and
turn it. into a park for students. A platform and public
address system will be set up, and the grass will he mowed
to provide students with a place to gather and relax.
Students will be responsible for planting trees, shrubs, and

(lowers. The University will finally have a place where
people can gather and talk.
Trustee Live-in
Trustees will be invited to live in various dorms to
informally discuss the University. They will be able to
view student life and attitudes from a participant's level.
This program can be one of the most important in
bringing the disparate elements of our University together.
K ore
The Revised ROTC report recommended that: 1.
Present ROTC instructors be denied faculty status; 2.
Individual courses by submitted to the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies for approval; and 3. Courses in the
revised program should be taught be accredited faculty
members in appropriate departments.
This report touched upon a number of significant
issues, yet we feel that its omissions are at least as notable
as the issues covered. In particular the ROTC Report
should have considered abolishing the punitive clause in
ROTC contracts and the use of University facilities for
training of both non-Stanford and Stanford students. In
light of these inadequacies we consider the Revised
Report to be incomplete and propose the following
amendments: 1. The punitive clause should be eliminated
from all ROTC contracts. 2. ROTC should be denied use
of any and all facilities of Stanford University.
Finally, the University has a clear obligation to provide
legal aid to those students wishing to leave ROTC but who
are unable to do so because of the punitive clause in their
contracts. A similiar obligation exists in the area of
personal finances; the University should assume
responsibility for porviding financial assistance where
needed.
Fee Proposals
We feel the students should vote for the amount of
$3.00 in assessment fees. Next year, unlike previous years,
the amount assessed for the ASSU will be divided; half for
student divisional associations (i.e. Axe Comm. 1.A.,
Mecha). There will be a basic fee from the University that
covers the operating expense of the ASSU office. As
current Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Loudin
Beam feels that in order for the ASSU to operate with a
similar amount of funds as was appropriated in the ASSU
this year, anything less than $3.00 would hinder the
continuation of current ASSU programs
