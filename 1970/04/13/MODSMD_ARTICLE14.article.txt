# Shoch-Evers
## A 						Radical Analysis 
### 
The Shoch-Evers campaign has
been an effort to examine and
analyze the institutions which
every day confront students in
America in the course of trying to
live their lives as human beings.
An attempt has been made to
explain why the present
institutions exist and what they
do.
We believe in analysis which
goes to the roots of social
problems and is at the same time
reasoned discourse. A very
important meaning of "rational"
is the idea that arguments are
stated in such a way that if
someone's analysis is wrong, it is
possible for someone else to
marshal evidence against him.
Thus, our analysis while radical,
has not been mere strident
assertion of dogma.
We have witnessed student
government administration after
student government

administration act in only an
advisory capacity to the university
administration and sometimes as
an auxiliary of the university
administration. This happens
despite the fact that many student
government officers act from
good motives and with the best of
intentions.
The problems all students face
stem, in large measure, from the
social structures which surround
them and define the boundaries of
acceptable activity. We think
Senator J. William Fulbright is
correct in identifying a
"military-industrial - university
complex." We find the fact that
the University has hosted
war-related research to be a
matter for direct political action.
We consider the fact that the
University is the home of many
intellectuals who spin apologies
for unconscionable activities to be
symptomatic of the context in
which education occurs in the
United States.
CIA and ROTC
Th is university has
distinguished itself by having
Central Intelligence Agency
people doing work here on
government scholarships and by
lowering admissions standards in
order to fill ROTC programs. We
favor the elimination of ROTC,
but consider the effort to deny
credit to ROTC as not without
importance. In this position we
find ourselves part of a Stanford
tradition. The University's first
president, David Starr Jordan, was
in his time an opponent of
campus military training and of
the world-wide military
interventions of the U.S.
government.
In contemporary America, the
fusion of big government and big
business into an organic whole has
had a momentous effect on
education. Big business utilizes
the government to socialize its
production costs. Economist
James O'Connor has pointed out
how through the financing of
higher education "the costs of
research, development of new
products, new production
processes, and so on, and above
all, the costs of training and
retraining the labor force, in
particular, technical,
administrative, and non-manual
workers" are borne by the state.
The twentieth century has seen
a tremendous growth in state
expenditures on education. As
Clark Kerr described the effects in
The Uses <>t the University:
"Taking the campus to the state
brings the state to the campus."
Education is now a nationalized
industry. The government has
acted often in recent years to
prevent threats to this industry
from undermining its present
condition. When students, who
are remote from the locus of
power, find conditions intolerable
and rebel, the government moves
in troops and police. Such
incidents have occurred with
increasing frequency at Stanford.
But a portent of what may yet
come can be seen in the arrest and
jailing last Febriary 10 of 894
black students from Valley State
College in Mississippi. This mass
bust was directed by the U.S.
Justice Department's Law

Enforcement Assistance
Administration alter white
Mississippi officials said they had
a state of civil disorder. The black
students had been peacefully
striking for a series of mild
student power demands.
It iÂ» h Is I rani pled
The rights of thousands of
Americans are trampled on daily,
and this trampling has been
systematized (that is, there is, "a
System"). In bureaucratic
organizations of the particular
sort that Stanford exemplifies,
modern empirical economists have
discovered an institutionalized
tendency toward discrimination.
Women and members of ethnic
minorities (blacks, Chicanoes,
Asian-Americans, Indians, etc.)
are likely to receive treatment
which falls short of what is
warranted by their abilities.
The conditions at Stanford are
part of a larger, society-wide
pattern of discrimination.
Stanford has an unsatisfactory
number of blacks in professorial
and academic administrative
positions. Stanford describes itself
as a residential university, but the
lack of on-campus housing puts
pressure on the East Palo Alto
housing market. The ratio of
women to men in the
undergraduate student
population, and statistically
calculated discrimination against
women in graduate admissions
(for example, in the psychology
department) show that here as
elsewhere women are treated as
members of an inferior caste.
This university must establish a
land development program which
is responsive to the desires of the
Stanford community, rather than
one responsive to pressure from
the trustees, big government, and
big business.
Board of Trustees
We find the Board of Trustees
to be an illegitimate institution
long overdue for extinction. It is
necessary that a university
community be run by the
students, faculty members, and
workers. (All of whom can be
viewed as homesteading the
University right now.)
Our tuition diversion plan for
University-paid instructors and
University-accreditation for
SWOPSI-type courses is a specific
reform which addresses itself to
the need for student feedback on
the quality of teaching and
provides a parallel sector of
student-initiated educational
endeavor which will help make
clear where the dead wood on the
present faculty is.
In general, on educational
matters, we agree with former
student body president David
Harris, who told incoming
freshman class in 1966: "If any of
you believe in the word freedom,
and if any of you have come in
search of that high ideal, you're
not going to find yourselves free
until you find yourselves in the
position where you can stand up
to the University and tell it to
chuck itself into the lake. None of
you are really going to start being
educated until you're in the
position where you could just as
easily drop out of this university.
So much of the University is
inculcating dependence."
