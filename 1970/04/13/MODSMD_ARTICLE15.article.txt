## ASSU Reform 
### 
Most recently there has been
considerable discussion of several
issues on this campus—primarily
the disposition of ROTC and the
question of violence in an
academic community. It is my
feeling that crises such as these
need not occur if the elements of
this university were functioning in
their proper manner. We seem to
be consumed fairly regularly with
the necessity of coming to some
immediate resolution of issues
that have provoked violent
reactions and disruptions. The
proper execution of student
government is not to be forced
into immediate action at the time
of such crises but to inject that
creative aspect into academic
reform and to make it so active,
pervasive and innovative that
disruptions on the scale of the
past few weeks are both
unnecessary and non-occurring.
Rather than be forced into action,
it should be the case that student
government leads reform and
organizes viable and immediate
implementation.
ROTC
The existence of Reserve
Officers' Training Corps on this
campus is an affront to academic
freedom in several ways. First,
there exist punitive clauses that
penalize and attempt to constrain
any participant from withdrawal.
Secondly, the program is not
directly administered by the
university, but by the Department
of Defense. Finally, we find
militarism and training to destroy
extremely repugnant in an
academic community where
creative talents and contribution
to human knowledge are avowed
goals. We therefore maintain that
ROTC should not exist for
academic credit on this campus,
and we urge everyone to vote to
defeat ROTC in the referendum
this week.
V iolcnce
Violence has no place in the
academic community; indeed, it is
contrary to the basic premise
upon which this university was
founded. The most recent
instance of violence on this
campus in the demonstrations
against ROTC is self-defeating
—the thing that was to be opposed
was actually used by the
demonstrators, and the hypocrisy
of such actions became blatant.
SKS Reports
The SES Reports are a
welcome contribution to the
improvement of education at
Stanford and should be
implemented immediately. The
revision of the grading system,
provisions for self-designed
majors, interdisciplinary courses
and studies (e.g., the Urban
Studies curricula), establishment
of a reading period of two weeks,
and the Innovation Fund (the
Student Center) are suggestions
absolutely necessary to maintain
our position as a top-flight
university.
Tuition
The recent tuition hikes are an
affront to students already hard
pressed by the high cost of
education. The decision by the
Trustees to reduce the operating
deficit by increasing students'
outlay is myopic. Tuition
increases can only tend towards
the point of diminishing returns
by excluding non-scholarship
students. In fact, this method of
fund raising may be construed as a
punitive gesture by the power
interests of this country. Large
endowment contributions and
gifts seem to have tapered off as a
result of increased student

activity, even non-violent forms of
activity. It is imperative that
students not be increasingly called
upon to contribute financially at a
time when such resources have
been almost completely depleted.
Instead, it is time that those
industries in this area that profit
from the university being here be
called upon to make some gifts,
not necessarily in the form of
scholarship funds but in the form
of unrestricted general university
funds.
Refcrend um
We urge all students to vote for
an increase in funds contributed
to the ASSU by choosing the
amount of five dollars ($5.00) on
this week's referendum. This
amount would allow the ASSU to
be expanded in its efforts for
academic reform and would
hopefully make it possible for this
body to involve more students,
individual students, in its
activities. This is not an attempt
to make the leaders of the ASSU
more powerful but to provide for
more power to individuals
—'power to the people.'
In addition, we urge all
students to approve the Daily
assessment and the Special Events
assessment. The Daily fee is
essential to maintain its
circulation and the services it
provides to our community.
Likewise, the services provided by
the Special Events Board are
essential.
Wasted Time?
One fact must be evident to all
students here when they look at
their fellow students—the calibre
of student that Stanford attracts
is no less than that of any
university in this country. Yet the
announced changes due to the

university deficit are a denial of
this fact, it is as if the governing
body of this school has decided
otherwise and that second-class
facilities will be tolerated by
students. The moving of the
Architecture Department from
the Art Department to
Engineering is an affront to any
architecture student, particularly
when it is the opinion of some
academicians that this particular
discipline calls forth the most in
creative ability from its adherents.
Is there to be a de-emphasis of the
humanitarian viewpoints
necessary to any planning task?
The phasing out of four faculty
members in the Speech
Department (80 percent of the
faculty of that department)
reflects a disregard for the pursuit
of knowledge in a most vital form
of communication. One may ask
what department is to be next?
Such changes in the
composition of this university fan
the fires of discontent with the
"Stanford Education" and bring
into question whether or not the
standard of education here is
equal to the calibre of student. It
may be argued that a good
student will be able to learn
regardless of where he is. If that is
the case, then there is no reason
that a student should be here
instead of some other
university—in fact, he would be
wasting his time here if the school
offered anything less than his
abilities would merit. This
university must widen and
increase its course offerings,
rather than cut back, and all of us
must find ways to increase its
financial resources. The university
is in a state of arrested growth, in
a purgatory between mediocrity
and true excellence.

Studies curricula), establishment
of a reading period of two weeks,
and the Innovation Fund (the
Student Center) are suggestions
absolutely necessary to maintain
our position as a top-flight
university.
Tuition
The recent tuition hikes are an
affront to students already hard
pressed by the high cost of
education. The decision by the
Trustees to reduce the operating
deficit by increasing students'
outlay is myopic. Tuition
increases can only tend towards
the point of diminishing returns
by excluding non-scholarship
students. In fact, this method of
fund raising may be construed as a
punitive gesture by the power
interests of this country. Large
endowment contributions and
gifts seem to have tapered off as a
result of increased student

activity, even non-violent forms of
activity. It is imperative that
students not be increasingly called
upon to contribute financially at a
time when such resources have
been almost completely depleted.
Instead, it is time that those
industries in this area that profit
from the university being here be
called upon to make some gifts,
not necessarily in the form of
scholarship funds but in the form
of unrestricted general university
funds.
Refcrend um
We urge all students to vote for
an increase in funds contributed
to the ASSU by choosing the
amount of five dollars ($5.00) on
this week's referendum. This
amount would allow the ASSU to
be expanded in its efforts for
academic reform and would
hopefully make it possible for this
body to involve more students,
individual students, in its
activities. This is not an attempt
to make the leaders of the ASSU
more powerful but to provide for
more power to individuals
—'power to the people.'
In addition, we urge all
students to approve the Daily
assessment and the Special Events
assessment. The Daily fee is
essential to maintain its
circulation and the services it
provides to our community.
Likewise, the services provided by
the Special Events Board are
essential.

One fact must be evident to all
students here when they look at
their fellow students—the calibre
of student that Stanford attracts
is no less than that of any
university in this country. Yet the
announced changes due to the

university deficit are a denial of
this fact, it is as if the governing
body of this school has decided
otherwise and that second-class
facilities will be tolerated by
students. The moving of the
Architecture Department from
the Art Department to
Engineering is an affront to any
architecture student, particularly
when it is the opinion of some
academicians that this particular
discipline calls forth the most in
creative ability from its adherents.
Is there to be a de-emphasis of the
humanitarian viewpoints
necessary to any planning task?
The phasing out of four faculty
members in the Speech
Department (80 percent of the
faculty of that department)
reflects a disregard for the pursuit
of knowledge in a most vital form
of communication. One may ask
what department is to be next?
Such changes in the
composition of this university fan
the fires of discontent with the
"Stanford Education" and bring
into question whether or not the
standard of education here is
equal to the calibre of student. It
may be argued that a good
student will be able to learn
regardless of where he is. If that is
the case, then there is no reason
that a student should be here
instead of some other
university—in fact, he would be
wasting his time here if the school
offered anything less than his
abilities would merit. This
university must widen and
increase its course offerings,
rather than cut back, and all of us
must find ways to increase its
financial resources. The university
is in a state of arrested growth, in
a purgatory between mediocrity
and true excellence.


John Pratt and Charles kitsman
Most recently there has been
considerable discussion of several
issues on this campus—primarily
the disposition of ROTC and the
question of violence in an
academic community. It is my
feeling that crises such as these
need not occur if the elements of
this university were functioning in
their proper manner. We seem to
be consumed fairly regularly with
the necessity of coming to some
immediate resolution of issues
that have provoked violent
reactions and disruptions. The
proper execution of student
government is not to be forced
into immediate action at the time
of such crises but to inject that
creative aspect into academic
reform and to make it so active,
pervasive and innovative that
disruptions on the scale of the
past few weeks are both
unnecessary and non-occurring.
Rather than be forced into action,
it should be the case that student
government leads reform and
organizes viable and immediate
implementation.
ROTC
The existence of Reserve
Officers' Training Corps on this
campus is an affront to academic
freedom in several ways. First,
there exist punitive clauses that
penalize and attempt to constrain
any participant from withdrawal.
Secondly, the program is not
directly administered by the
university, but by the Department
of Defense. Finally, we find
militarism and training to destroy
extremely repugnant in an
academic community where
creative talents and contribution
to human knowledge are avowed
goals. We therefore maintain that
ROTC should not exist for
academic credit on this campus,
and we urge everyone to vote to
defeat ROTC in the referendum
this week.
V iolcnce
Violence has no place in the
academic community; indeed, it is
contrary to the basic premise
upon which this university was
founded. The most recent
instance of violence on this
campus in the demonstrations
against ROTC is self-defeating
—the thing that was to be opposed
was actually used by the
demonstrators, and the hypocrisy
of such actions became blatant.

announced changes due to the

university deficit are a denial of
this fact, it is as if the governing
body of this school has decided
otherwise and that second-class
facilities will be tolerated by
students. The moving of the
Architecture Department from
the Art Department to
Engineering is an affront to any
architecture student, particularly
when it is the opinion of some
academicians that this particular
discipline calls forth the most in
creative ability from its adherents.
Is there to be a de-emphasis of the
humanitarian viewpoints
necessary to any planning task?
The phasing out of four faculty
members in the Speech
Department (80 percent of the
faculty of that department)
reflects a disregard for the pursuit
of knowledge in a most vital form
of communication. One may ask
what department is to be next?
Such changes in the
composition of this university fan
the fires of discontent with the
"Stanford Education" and bring
into question whether or not the
standard of education here is
equal to the calibre of student. It
may be argued that a good
student will be able to learn
regardless of where he is. If that is
the case, then there is no reason
that a student should be here
instead of some other
university—in fact, he would be
wasting his time here if the school
offered anything less than his
abilities would merit. This
university must widen and
increase its course offerings,
rather than cut back, and all of us
must find ways to increase its
financial resources. The university
is in a state of arrested growth, in
a purgatory between mediocrity
and true excellence.


John Pratt and Charles kitsman
Most recently there has been
considerable discussion of several
issues on this campus—primarily
the disposition of ROTC and the
question of violence in an
academic community. It is my
feeling that crises such as these
need not occur if the elements of
this university were functioning in
their proper manner. We seem to
be consumed fairly regularly with
the necessity of coming to some
immediate resolution of issues
that have provoked violent
reactions and disruptions. The
proper execution of student
government is not to be forced
into immediate action at the time
of such crises but to inject that
creative aspect into academic
reform and to make it so active,
pervasive and innovative that
disruptions on the scale of the
past few weeks are both
unnecessary and non-occurring.
Rather than be forced into action,
it should be the case that student
government leads reform and
organizes viable and immediate
implementation.
ROTC
The existence of Reserve
Officers' Training Corps on this
campus is an affront to academic
freedom in several ways. First,
there exist punitive clauses that
penalize and attempt to constrain
any participant from withdrawal.
Secondly, the program is not
directly administered by the
university, but by the Department
of Defense. Finally, we find
militarism and training to destroy
extremely repugnant in an
academic community where
creative talents and contribution
to human knowledge are avowed
goals. We therefore maintain that
ROTC should not exist for
academic credit on this campus,
and we urge everyone to vote to
defeat ROTC in the referendum
this week.
V iolcnce
Violence has no place in the
academic community; indeed, it is
contrary to the basic premise
upon which this university was
founded. The most recent
instance of violence on this
campus in the demonstrations
against ROTC is self-defeating
—the thing that was to be opposed
was actually used by the
demonstrators, and the hypocrisy
of such actions became blatant.
SKS Reports
The SES Reports are a
welcome contribution to the
improvement of education at
Stanford and should be
implemented immediately. The
revision of the grading system,
provisions for self-designed
majors, interdisciplinary courses
and studies (e.g., the Urban
Studies curricula), establishment
of a reading period of two weeks,
and the Innovation Fund (the
Student Center) are suggestions
absolutely necessary to maintain
our position as a top-flight
university.
Tuition
The recent tuition hikes are an
affront to students already hard
pressed by the high cost of
education. The decision by the
Trustees to reduce the operating
deficit by increasing students'
outlay is myopic. Tuition
increases can only tend towards
the point of diminishing returns
by excluding non-scholarship
students. In fact, this method of
fund raising may be construed as a
punitive gesture by the power
interests of this country. Large
endowment contributions and
gifts seem to have tapered off as a
result of increased student

activity, even non-violent forms of
activity. It is imperative that
students not be increasingly called
upon to contribute financially at a
time when such resources have
been almost completely depleted.
Instead, it is time that those
industries in this area that profit
from the university being here be
called upon to make some gifts,
not necessarily in the form of
scholarship funds but in the form
of unrestricted general university
funds.
Refcrend um
We urge all students to vote for
an increase in funds contributed
to the ASSU by choosing the
amount of five dollars ($5.00) on
this week's referendum. This
amount would allow the ASSU to
be expanded in its efforts for
academic reform and would
hopefully make it possible for this
body to involve more students,
individual students, in its
activities. This is not an attempt
to make the leaders of the ASSU
more powerful but to provide for
more power to individuals
—'power to the people.'
In addition, we urge all
students to approve the Daily
assessment and the Special Events
assessment. The Daily fee is
essential to maintain its
circulation and the services it
provides to our community.
Likewise, the services provided by
the Special Events Board are
essential.
Wasted Time?
One fact must be evident to all
students here when they look at
their fellow students—the calibre
of student that Stanford attracts
is no less than that of any
university in this country. Yet the
announced changes due to the

university deficit are a denial of
this fact, it is as if the governing
body of this school has decided
otherwise and that second-class
