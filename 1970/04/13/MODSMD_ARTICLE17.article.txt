## The 						ROTC Cadet 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was quite amused after having
read the "open challenge"
delivered to my fellow ROTC
cadet, Hank Liese, challenging
anyone to convince him that last
Wednesday's Daily article "From
the Inside —One Cadet's
Criticisms" was written by an
ROTC cadet. As the author of
that article, I find it amusing that
Cadet Liese really thinks any of
his fellow cadets incapable of
having moral values and political
ideals that go against (he grain of
the military. He states, "No one
would believe that Mike Sweeney,
Leonard Siegel, or whatever
Movement member wrote that
column is enrolled in the ROTC
program." That statement simply
shows his lack of ability to
understand why the Army could
not mold every ROTC cadet into
unquestioning loyalty and
obedience.
Do you, fellow cadet Liese,
really believe it impossible for one
ROTC cadet to retain his
individuality under the military's
subjugation, and be able to speak
out against that subjugation? No
Movement member wrote that
article, Mr. Liese, and 1 would by
perfectly content to make my

name public were it not for the
Army's coercive influence in my
life. It could be said that I am not
withholding my name, but the
Army is, through its own brand of
coercion, namely the punitive
clause and branch assignments.

'Mindless A ctioh
Editor, The Daily :
Opposition to ROTC is
understandable. Opposition to
classified research is
understandable. The AEL sit-in
with its stated basis of
non-violence won fairly wide
support. But the radical actions of
the past week are very difficult to
understand and impossible to
justify.
Even the fact that the crowd
included Berkeley students,
Foothill students, high school
students, and non-students, is no
excuse for stupid conduct and
petty destruction. The one thing
this community cannot tolerate is
mindless action.
