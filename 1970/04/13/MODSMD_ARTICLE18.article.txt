# This Week's Films
## U.S. Directors Featured 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Films by Griffith, Hawks, and
Nichols, three outstanding
American directors, will be
featured this week on
campus. Tuesday, April 14, in
Geology 320 the Freshman Film
Series will present two late 1930
feature films. "My Man Godfrey,"
a 1936 comedy starring William
Powell and Carole Lombard will
be shown at 8.
The second film at 10 will be
"Only Angels Have Wings," a
1939 adventure film starring
Academy Award Winner Cary
Grant, Jean Arthur, Richard
Barthelmess, and Rita Hayworth.
Howard Hawks, one of the least
appreciated Hollywood directors,
produces and directed this classic.
Included among Hawks' other fine
films are "Scareface" (1932),
"The Road to Glory" (1936),
"Red River" (1948), "Gentlemen
Prefer Blonds" (1953), "Rio
Bravo" (1959), "Hatari" (1962),
"Man's Favorite Sport" (1964),
and "El Dorado" (1967).
Kinetic Art
This Wednesday, Tresidder will
show the third program of the
Kinetic Art Series at 7:30 and
9:30 in Bishop Auditorium. Nine
creative short films from Prague,
Paris, Hamburg, and San
Francisco will be featured.
Included are "The Last Trick of
Mr. Edgar," winner of the Grand
Prize for Experiment at the
Bergamo Film Festival, and
"Versailles" by Albert Lamorisse
who is best known for his classic,
"The Red Balloon." "Versailles"
won Grand Prize for the Short
Film at the Cannes Festival.
Also on Wednesday evening,
Contemporary Cinema Society is
sponsoring one of my all-time
favorite Stage Plays on Film,
"Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?" with Super Stars
Elizabeth Taylor and Richard
Burton and co-performers George

Segal and Sandy (the whimperer)
Dennis. Rounding out this All
Star event are America's highest
paid director Mike Nichols who
has gained Boy Wonder status
with only two films, "Virginia
Woolf" and "The Graduate" (his
long awaited "Catch-22" will be
released next month), and
cinematographer Haskell Wexler,
now famous for "Medium Cool",
but who also filmed "The Loved
One," "In the Heat of the Night",
and "ThomasCrown Affiar."
The International Association
film showing Thursday at 7 :45 in
Cubberly is "Professor Hanibal," a
1957 Hungarian film by Zoltan
Fabri.
Silent Kilms
The Friday Night Silent Films
at Tresidder will be "Waxworks",
directed by Paul Leni, and "The
New York Hat", directed by
David Wark Griffith. The three
villains of "Waxworks", a 1924
horror fantasy, are Conrad Veidt
as Ivan the Terrible, Emil Jannings
as Harounal-Rashid, and Werner
Krauss as Jack the Ripper.

"The New York Hat" (1912),
stars Mary Pickford, Lionel
Barrymore, Lillian Gish and Mae
West. The program will be
repeated at 7, 8, and 9, with live
piano accompaniment at the 7
and 9 showings.* * *
Note: I consider John Wayne a
fine actor, but don't believe he
should have received an Academy
Award for the film "True Grit".
He has had far too many
memorable performances ("The
Horse Soldiers", "The Alamo",
"North to Alaska", etc.) to be
remembered for such a mediocre
movie. Another example was
Katherine Hepburn who received
an Award for "Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner".
Academy Awards shouldn't
have to be given for Best
Sentimental Performance by an
Aging Actor or Actress. If the
Academy feels it has to
compensate for its ineptitude, it
should give special Oscars such as
the one awarded Cary Grant this
year for his "sheer brilliance in
the acting business."

Silent Kilms
The Friday Night Silent Films
at Tresidder will be "Waxworks",
directed by Paul Leni, and "The
New York Hat", directed by
David Wark Griffith. The three
villains of "Waxworks", a 1924
horror fantasy, are Conrad Veidt
as Ivan the Terrible, Emil Jannings
as Harounal-Rashid, and Werner
Krauss as Jack the Ripper.

"The New York Hat" (1912),
stars Mary Pickford, Lionel
Barrymore, Lillian Gish and Mae
West. The program will be
repeated at 7, 8, and 9, with live
piano accompaniment at the 7
and 9 showings.* * *
Note: I consider John Wayne a
fine actor, but don't believe he
should have received an Academy
Award for the film "True Grit".
He has had far too many
memorable performances ("The
Horse Soldiers", "The Alamo",
"North to Alaska", etc.) to be
remembered for such a mediocre
movie. Another example was
Katherine Hepburn who received
an Award for "Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner".
Academy Awards shouldn't
have to be given for Best
Sentimental Performance by an
Aging Actor or Actress. If the
Academy feels it has to
compensate for its ineptitude, it
should give special Oscars such as
the one awarded Cary Grant this
year for his "sheer brilliance in
the acting business."
