# Committee Repeals Tonkin Resolution
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted Friday to repeal
the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin
resolution, used by the
administration of President
Lyndon B. Johnson as the basis
for sending more than 500,000
U.S. troops to Vietnam.
A resolution approved
unanimously by the committee
would also repeal the 1958 Middle
East resolution. Both actions, if
approved by the House and
Senate, would take effect after
the current session of Congress
ends.
The committee decided to take

repeal of the two resolutions from
a much broader measure that,
among other things, would have
also repealed in 1955 Formosa
resolution and a 1962 Cuba
resolution.
All of the resolutions authorize
the executive branch to take
necessary action and were passed
to meet specific crises at the time.
"We are beginning a process of
clearing away the obsolete
agreements and resolutions,"
Chairman J. W. Fulbright, D-Ark.,
told reporters. "I hope," he said,
"it will cause a re-examination of
all of our commitments around
the world."
