Patrick C. Shea
Robert Grant
Hal Mickelson
Adam Levin
The ASSU Senate should
concentrate on "services to
students," according to Council of
President candidates Patrick C.
Shea, Robert Grant, Hal
Mickelson, and Adam Levin.
They see a need to
"deemphasize the aspect of ASSU
as a political forum" which passes
ineffective resolutions, and to

concentrate instead on such
student services as academic
reform. They advocate
implementing SES proposals and
pledge firm support for the
SWOPSI program of
undergraduate special courses.
The four candidates are also
strongly advocating passage of the
Special Events assessment, which
they helped sponsor. They said it
would provide funds "so that next
year the arts of Stanford will have
support."
They believe the assessment
will provide financial backing for
campus groups wishing to sponsor
rock and classical concerts,
lectures, and other cultural events.
They predicted it would make
possible at least three concerts
each quarter.
Shea, Grant, Mickelson, and
Levin also have pledged
involvement in university land and
building development plans. As an
example, they support action to
protect the Jasper Ridge-Searsville
Lake area of campus which they
call "a uniquely preserved part of
California."
The candidates support
continuance of ROTC on campus
as a student service, although they
do not believe academic credit
should be given for ROTC-taught
courses.
But the four also support the
ROTC referendum and have
pledged to abide by its decision,
even if it does not agree with their
stand.
Anti Violence
They have spoken against
violence on campus as "not a
legitimate means for affecting
change in the university."
An ASSU fee of $1 is
recommended in their platform,
as well as support for the Daily
assessment.
Patrick C. Shea (no relation to
the present Council of Presidents
member) is a junior in philosophy.
He has worked as an ASSU Senate
representative, a member of the
Board of Trustees Committee on
Planning and Development, and a
member of the ASSU Committee
on University Governance. Shea
has also been a Stanford-in Wash
ington intern and was President of
the Stanford Student Alumni
Associates.
Robert N. Grant is a graduate
student in the Stanford
Law-Business Program and a 1967
Princeton graduate. At Stanford,
he has been a member of the
Board of Trustees Committee on
Finance and the President's
Advisory Committee on Land and
Building Development. He has
also served in the ASSU Senate
and on the ASSU Committee on
Nominations.
Hal M. Mickelson, a junior in
history, has served as a member of
the ASSU Senate and the ASSU
Senate Rules Committee. He has
also been announcer for the
Stanford Marching Band.
Adam Levin, a junior in
political science, has served for

two years as chairman of the
ASSU Special Events Board. He
has also been a member of the
Committee on Public Events and
has worked on the U.S. Senate
staff of Sen. Harrison Williams.
Charles Kitsman
John Pratt
"Major academic reform" is a
campaign theme of Senate
presidential candidate Charles
Kitsman and his vice-presidential
running-mate, John Pratt.
They are calling for renewed
efforts to implement SES reform
proposals, support of the Student
Center for Innovation in Research
and Education, and a new
emphasis on interdisciplinary
studies.
Kitsman said new
interdisciplinary programs are
important, particularly to fill in
the gaps in social sciences." He
pointed to urban studies as a field
in need of such cross-depart
mental efforts.
Kitsman commented, "I'm not
terribly politically inclined. I'm
more interested in setting up a
better educational system here."
Kitsman and Pratt have also
called for efforts to lower tuition
"or at least keep it from going up
any more." They said present
expenses "crucify" students, who
are "getting the short end of the
stick" through misuse of campus
facilities.
Tuition
They propose student
involvement in university
fund-raising to prevent further
tuition increases. Kitsman
suggested approaching Stanford
Industrial P.ark industries for fund
contributions.
Kitsman and Prat have stated,
"ROTC should not exist for
academic credit on this campus"
and have urged such a vote on this
week's referendum. But they
believe ROTC should be allowed
to stay without credit.
They have also said, "Violence
has no place in the academic
community."
Kitsman and Pratt have
supported an ASSU fee of $5 to
provide funds for academic
reform and "make the Senate's
presence felt more."
They have also expressed
support for the Daily assessment
and the Special Events fee.
Kitsman is a junior with an
interdepartmental major in
spoken communication. He ran
for ASSU president last year on a
"communicational" theme and
has lived and studied in Canada,
Australia, Kuwait, and
Switzerland.
Pratt, a junior in political
science, has served as chairman of
the Undergraduate Committee on
an Urban Studies Curriculum and
is interested in international
relations. He now lives in Beirut,
Lebanon and has also lived in
Libya, Egypt, Berlin, and
Casablanca.

Bob Cory
Bob Matson
Loudin Beam

Streamlining student
government is a major goal of the
Cory-Mattson-Beam ticket for
ASSU Senate President.
Bob Cory, Bob Mattson, and
Loudin Beam, running as a Council
of Presidents, advocate
"legitimizing the current
Committee of Fifteen" as a
formal Student-Faculty
-Administration Council (SFAC).
Any proposal passed in the
Student Senate by a two-thirds
vote would then go to the SFAC.
A majority approval by the SFAC
would send the proposal to
President Pitzer, who would be
required to act on it within fifteen
days.
The candidates believe the
SFAC would speed up campus
decision-making and "act as an
appeal board for the Student
Senate."
They also favor a student-run
Co-op, to sell a wider variety of
goods than the campus bookstore
and drugstore and offer lower
prices. Another plan is for a
"trustee live-in." According to
Beam, at least four trustees have
already expressed interest in
spending several days at a time
living in dormitories, "as
participants" in campus life.
They have backed an ASSU fee
of "no less than $3" to maintain
the present budget level. They
have also expressed support of the
Daily assessment, but opposition
to the proposed $1 Special Events
fee.
No ROTC
Cory, Beam, and Mattson have
called for elimination of ROTC if
the university can protect those in
the program from the
government's punitive clause and
arrange substitute financial aid to
that provided by ROTC.
They have expressed
disapproval of all uses of violence
on campus.
Bob Cory, a senior in Political
science, has served in the ASSU
Senate, LASSU the old student
legislature, and last year's
Committee of Fifteen. He worked
for establishment of a university
ombudsman and has participated
in the Nairobi Tutorial, the
Moratorium, and the Kennedy
presidential campaign.
Bob Mattson, a senior in
history and humanities honors,
served in LASSU and participated
on freshman housing, sponsoring,
and food service committees.
Mattson has also been a
Moratorium co-ordinator, a
member of the Advisory Student
Board of the House Report on
Campus Unrest, and chairman of
the Western Leadership
Conference.
Loudin Beam, a junior in
honors political science, is a
Committee of Fifteen member
and ASSU Senate representative.
He has served as chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee,
assistant director of the Stanford
Management Intern program, and
as a member of the Stanford
