# NY Governor Signs Liberal Abortion Law
## 
### 
The most liberal abortion
proposal for any state was signed
into law in New York Saturday, as
Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller
repealed the state's 110-year old
abortion statute.
The new law will take effect
July 1.
The law allows a doctor to
perform an abortion within 24
weeks of conception with the
consent of the women. There are
no age or residency requirements.
The old law permitted an
abortion only if the mother's life
were in danger.
Proposals similar to the New
York law are presently pending
before the governors of Alaska
and Maryland.
The Alaska House passed a
State Senate-approved bill Friday
that would require that abortions
be performed in a hospital. In
addition it requires 30-day
residence in the state.
The proposal would make
abortion a medical matter
between a doctor and his patient
until the fetus can sustain life
outside the womb, usually about
the 26th week after conception.
Alaska's governor Keith H.
| Miller has not yet indicated
whether he will sign the new law.
The new statute proposed for
Maryland, already passed by both
Houses of the Maryland legislature
and awaiting Governor Marvin

Mandel's signature, would
eliminate virtually all restrictions
on abortions.
Governor Mandel has set a
public hearing on the bill later this
month, and said he will announce
by May 1 whether he plans to sign
the bill.
Passage of the abortion law in
New York came after lengthy and
often emotional debate. The bill
got strong support from women's
groups and some doctors and was
opposed by the Roman Catholic
Church.
