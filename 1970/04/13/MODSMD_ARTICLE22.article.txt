# Paper Drive Planned
## 
### 
The Stanford Conservation
Group will be co-ordinating a
campus-wide effort to collect old
newspapers and to sell them for
recycling purposes.
Proceeds from the sale of the
newspapers will go to the
Sem pervircns Fund —a statewide
fund which is being used to save
priceless redwood forests from
destruction by logging.
Boxes for old newspapers will
be placed in each dorm late next
week.
See Campus Roundup for
details of organizational meeting
tonight.
