# Crew, Job Top Aquatic Action

Stroking to a facile 12 second
victory, Stanford's varsity crew
nobly defended its possession of
the Conn Findlay Cup (the what?)
Saturday morning on placid bay
waters near Redwood City.
The Indian oarsmen covered
the 2,000 meter course in 5:53,
well ahead of the Oregon State
contingent (6:05) whose final
spring caught USC and relegated
the Trojans to third, another six
seconds back.
Santa Clara, which showed up
late anyway, maintained that
trend and straggled in with a 6:23
time.
Though the morning got off to
a windy start, by the time the
varsity crews got going the breeze
had stopped, and at the finish the
band had stripped down to
whatever it strips down to while
cheering the victory with 200
others.
Oregon State's junior varsity
nipped Stanford by a half a length
in the first race, after which the
Tribe frosh won the freshman
competition.
In the winning varsity boat
were Mike Yoshimura, cox, Kurt
Lofgren, stroke, Bill Durham,
seventh, Bernie Thurber, sixth,
Don Connolly, fifth, Don Steele,
fourth, John Strong, third, Jim
Topic, second, and Bob Casper,
bow.
The morning's closest race was

the first, in which OSU's junior
varsity started out with a
three-seat lead over Stanford,
picked up a lead of five seats at
the 1500 meter mark after the
Indians had pulled even, and then
turned on a final sprint to cinch
the win.
Next action is next Saturday in
Eugene, against Oregon, Oregon
State and Washington.

Stanford's Brian Job, the new star
of the swimming world, today
begins a well-earned rest at the
Cortland, Ohio home after
another remarkable
record-breaking session which was
among the highlights of the
National AAU Men's and
Women's Swimming
Championship in Cincinnati.
Job, who last month lowered
national standards in the 1 00- and
200-yd. breaststroke and
participated on the Stanford
100-yd. medley relay team which
was also responsible for a new
NCAA standard, virtually
repeated his performance in
Cincinnati, swimming for the
Santa Clara Swim Club.
Setting the only American
record in the opening session of
the four day meet, Job broke his
NCAA record of :57.6 by
three-tenths of a second in the
morning preliminaries last
Thursday, and moved it down to
:f>7.o in the finals Thursday night.
On Friday, Job helped lower
the 1969 American record in the
400-yd. medley relay to 3:24.1.
The new time also breaks the
Stanford NCAA record of 3:24.8
set last month at Salt Lake City.
Job's third record in as many
days was set Saturday, as the
freshman breaststroke champion
churned the 200-yard event in
2:04.3, a time which breaks his
NCAA mark of 2:05.99.
