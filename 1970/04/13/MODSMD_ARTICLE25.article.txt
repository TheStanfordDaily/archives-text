Lifetime-best performances by
long-jumper Tom Anderson and
pole-vaulter Steve Flannery and a
find double effort by miler*
Duncan Mac Donald were not
enough to pull out a victory for
the still-winless Stanford track
squad, as the Indians fell to a
surprisingly strong Oregon State
team, 93-61, Saturday in
Corvallis.
Stanford Coach Payton Jordan
had no excuse for the loss other
than the solid performances of the
Beaver runners, who dominated
all but the distance events. "They
competed very well," Jordan
commented, "and they're a much
better team than they've shown
thus far this year. They'll be one
of the stronger teams in "the
conference."
However, the Stanford traclfc
mentor had words of praise for
several of- his performers. Jordan
noted lifetime-bests for Anderson,
whose leap of 23-4 gave him
second in the long jump, and
Flannery, whose 15-6 pole-vault
effort was not only six inches
higher than a previous best but
also provided a half-foot margin
of victory over an OSU rival.
Jordan also singled out
performances by Don Kardong in
the three-mile, Duncan
Mac Donald in the mile and 880,
and Brian Mittelstaedt in the mile.

Kardong won his event in 13:43.4
and Mac Donald won the mile and
placed second in the half-mile
with a 1 :52.4 which equals a
lifetime-best.. Of Mittelstaedt's
performance in the mile run,
Jordan said "Brian ran an
excellent mile, a smart mile which
was one of the better
performances of the meet."
The Stanford trackmen meet
powerhouse Southern California
in Los Angeles next weekend in a
match which Jordan seemed to
characterize by saying, "the going
gets tougher all the time."
