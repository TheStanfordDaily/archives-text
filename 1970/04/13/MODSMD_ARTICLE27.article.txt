## Cards Win Two Of Three From Cal 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
BERKELEY - Stanford's
Pac-8 pennant drive got off to a
revolting start here Saturday when
the Indians were shut out by
California, 3-0.
Undone partly by a lefthanded
pitcher with a devilish pickoff
move and partly by some
horrendous luck on more than a
dozen sharply hit balls, the Tribe
this morning finds itself in the
unfamiliar confines of last place in
the league.
This might be more serious
than it sounds. Last season only
one game separated second place
Stanford from Pac-8 winner
UCLA, and ths year the matchups
between the four California
schools look to be just as tight.
Not only that, but both the
Bruins and the USC Trojans are
due in Sunken Diamond this
weekend.
In other words, the Indians'
fate, if not decided at Cal
Saturday, might well be if two or
more games aren't won from the
southlanders.
Frustration
Saturday's contest here was a
fast-moving affair which left the
confident Cards frustrated and
stunned. Chiefly responsible was
Bear pitcher Ron Wayne, who
served up a cleverly-chosen
assortment of tosses which were
so easy to hit when you first saw
them that it was impossible later
on.
As the game began Wayne
appeared to have just about
enough stuff to last a very few
frames. The Indians collected
three singles in the first and hit
the ball right on the nose for most
of the rest of the afternoon.
Trouble was, just about every ball
hit went right at a Cal fielder. And
when Wayne did get himself in
trouble, as he did in the third and
seventh, he saved himself with the
sneakiest pickoff moves you (or
Stanford's runners) ever saw.
When he nailed Don Schellenberg
to dim Indian hopes for an
uprising in the seventh, it was
Wayne's eighth pickoff of the
year.
At this point you're probably
wondering how Stanford failed to
score in the first on three singles.
Well, it was like this. Shortstop
Dave Edson opened the game with
a single to right, then went to
second when an errant Wayne
pickoff attempt got away from
rookie first baseman Mick Tate.
But when Dick Borchers lofted a
fly to center, Edson tried to tag
and go to third, where he was
gunned down by an 8-6-5 relay.
So when Mike Ewing and Mike
Nelson followed with singles, it
was all for naught.
Cal Scores
All this was frustrating, of
course, but it didn't appear to be
serious so long as Stanford's Phil
Keller was able to keep the Bears
at bay. And this he did, to the
tune of seven strike-outs and two
hits over the first six stanzas. But
in the seventh centerfielder Garry
Reagan slammed a one-run shot
over the left field fence, and in
the eighth a leadoff double and an
unplayable roller to the mound
set the scene for a booming
two-run double to far right by
second baseman Chuch Kerkjian.
And that was it.
INDIAN ITEMS . . . Cal coach
George Wolfman on Wavne: "He's

been good all year but this was his
best game so far. He had more
control than usual. He's a smart
pitcher and was using his stuff to
set Stanford batters up in the late
innings." . . . Wayne vs Keller was
a classic example of how
overpowering stuff (which Keller
had) is not always enough to
win . . . Keller's ERA is a rising
but still decent 1.67 . . . Edson's
single gave him a 12 game
streak . . . Ewing, at .298, is the
closest thing the Indians have to a
.300 hitting regular.
Stanford entertains UC (Davis)
here tomorrow, San Diego State
on Thursday, UCLA Friday and
USC in a double header Saturday.

BACKHAND — Senior Captain Bob Rippner won both his singles and doubles
iction as Stanford whomped Cal on the Tribe's courts Saturday
BERKELEY - Stanford's
Pac-8 pennant drive got off to a
revolting start here Saturday when
the Indians were shut out by
California, 3-0.
Undone partly by a lefthanded
pitcher with a devilish pickoff
move and partly by some
horrendous luck on more than a
dozen sharply hit balls, the Tribe
this morning finds itself in the
unfamiliar confines of last place in
the league.
This might be more serious
than it sounds. Last season only
one game separated second place
Stanford from Pac-8 winner
UCLA, and ths year the matchups
between the four California
schools look to be just as tight.
Not only that, but both the
Bruins and the USC Trojans are
due in Sunken Diamond this
weekend.
In other words, the Indians'
fate, if not decided at Cal
Saturday, might well be if two or
more games aren't won from the
southlanders.
Frustration
Saturday's contest here was a
fast-moving affair which left the
confident Cards frustrated and
stunned. Chiefly responsible was
Bear pitcher Ron Wayne, who
served up a cleverly-chosen
assortment of tosses which were
so easy to hit when you first saw
them that it was impossible later
on.
As the game began Wayne
appeared to have just about
enough stuff to last a very few
frames. The Indians collected
three singles in the first and hit
the ball right on the nose for most
of the rest of the afternoon.
Trouble was, just about every ball
hit went right at a Cal fielder. And
when Wayne did get himself in
trouble, as he did in the third and
seventh, he saved himself with the
sneakiest pickoff moves you (or
Stanford's runners) ever saw.
When he nailed Don Schellenberg
to dim Indian hopes for an
uprising in the seventh, it was
Wayne's eighth pickoff of the
year.
At this point you're probably
wondering how Stanford failed to
score in the first on three singles.
Well, it was like this. Shortstop
Dave Edson opened the game with
a single to right, then went to
second when an errant Wayne
pickoff attempt got away from
rookie first baseman Mick Tate.
But when Dick Borchers lofted a
fly to center, Edson tried to tag
and go to third, where he was
gunned down by an 8-6-5 relay.
So when Mike Ewing and Mike
Nelson followed with singles, it
was all for naught.
Cal Scores
All this was frustrating, of
course, but it didn't appear to be
serious so long as Stanford's Phil
Keller was able to keep the Bears
at bay. And this he did, to the
tune of seven strike-outs and two
hits over the first six stanzas. But
in the seventh centerfielder Garry
Reagan slammed a one-run shot
over the left field fence, and in
the eighth a leadoff double and an
unplayable roller to the mound
set the scene for a booming
two-run double to far right by
second baseman Chuch Kerkjian.
And that was it.
INDIAN ITEMS . . . Cal coach
George Wolfman on Wavne: "He's

been good all year but this was his
best game so far. He had more
control than usual. He's a smart
pitcher and was using his stuff to
set Stanford batters up in the late
innings." . . . Wayne vs Keller was
a classic example of how
overpowering stuff (which Keller
had) is not always enough to
win . . . Keller's ERA is a rising
but still decent 1.67 . . . Edson's
single gave him a 12 game
streak . . . Ewing, at .298, is the
closest thing the Indians have to a
.300 hitting regular.
Stanford entertains UC (Davis)

on Thursday, UCLA Friday and
USC in a double header Saturday.

BACKHAND — Senior Captain Bob Rippner won both his singles and doubles
iction as Stanford whomped Cal on the Tribe's courts Saturday
BERKELEY - Stanford's
Pac-8 pennant drive got off to a
revolting start here Saturday when
the Indians were shut out by
California, 3-0.
Undone partly by a lefthanded
pitcher with a devilish pickoff
move and partly by some
horrendous luck on more than a
dozen sharply hit balls, the Tribe
this morning finds itself in the
unfamiliar confines of last place in
the league.
This might be more serious
than it sounds. Last season only
one game separated second place
Stanford from Pac-8 winner
UCLA, and ths year the matchups
between the four California
schools look to be just as tight.
Not only that, but both the
Bruins and the USC Trojans are
due in Sunken Diamond this
weekend.
In other words, the Indians'
fate, if not decided at Cal
Saturday, might well be if two or
more games aren't won from the
southlanders.
Frustration
Saturday's contest here was a
fast-moving affair which left the
confident Cards frustrated and
stunned. Chiefly responsible was
Bear pitcher Ron Wayne, who
served up a cleverly-chosen
assortment of tosses which were
so easy to hit when you first saw
them that it was impossible later
on.
As the game began Wayne
appeared to have just about
enough stuff to last a very few
frames. The Indians collected
three singles in the first and hit
the ball right on the nose for most
of the rest of the afternoon.
Trouble was, just about every ball
hit went right at a Cal fielder. And
when Wayne did get himself in
trouble, as he did in the third and
seventh, he saved himself with the
sneakiest pickoff moves you (or
Stanford's runners) ever saw.
When he nailed Don Schellenberg
to dim Indian hopes for an
uprising in the seventh, it was
Wayne's eighth pickoff of the
year.
At this point you're probably
wondering how Stanford failed to
score in the first on three singles.
Well, it was like this. Shortstop
Dave Edson opened the game with
a single to right, then went to
second when an errant Wayne
pickoff attempt got away from
rookie first baseman Mick Tate.
But when Dick Borchers lofted a
fly to center, Edson tried to tag
and go to third, where he was
gunned down by an 8-6-5 relay.
So when Mike Ewing and Mike
Nelson followed with singles, it
was all for naught.
Cal Scores
All this was frustrating, of
course, but it didn't appear to be
serious so long as Stanford's Phil
Keller was able to keep the Bears
at bay. And this he did, to the
tune of seven strike-outs and two
hits over the first six stanzas. But
in the seventh centerfielder Garry
Reagan slammed a one-run shot
over the left field fence, and in
the eighth a leadoff double and an
unplayable roller to the mound
set the scene for a booming
two-run double to far right by
second baseman Chuch Kerkjian.
And that was it.
INDIAN ITEMS . . . Cal coach
George Wolfman on Wavne: "He's

been good all year but this was his
best game so far. He had more
control than usual. He's a smart
pitcher and was using his stuff to
set Stanford batters up in the late
innings." . . . Wayne vs Keller was
a classic example of how
overpowering stuff (which Keller
had) is not always enough to
win . . . Keller's ERA is a rising
but still decent 1.67 . . . Edson's
