# Braves Split Cal Twinbill
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's soph-frosh baseball
team stretched its impressive
record to 21-5 Saturday by
splitting an exciting Bay Area
Collegiate League doubleheader
with Cal here.
The Braves won the opener 5-4
in eight innings. Mickey Aquirre
singled in the tying run in the
bottom of the seventh and Andy
Frank drove in the winning tally
with an eighth inning single. Bob
Scott hurled the final two frames
to get the win, his fifth against no
defeats.
In the nightcap the Tribe fell
apart, relinquishing four unearned
runs in the top of the seventh

Both games were highlighted
by close plays at the plate. Tom

two RBl's in the second game.
In the first game, Frank,
Aguirre, Gary Osterhout and Rod
Boone all had two hits. Stanford
is now 8-2 in League play with a
game at Berkeley on Tuesday.

Coach Dick Gould's broad
smile adequately expressed his
quiet satisfaction about

arch-foe, Cal. The Indian netmen
had just overwhelmed the Bears
9-0 before a large crowd of
Stanford fans.

7-4 6-2.

In the final match of the day,

Tomorrow, the Stanford
varsity tennis team takes on the
Stanford graduate school, one of
the most rugged teams the varsity
will face all year. Later, the
Indians take on USC and UCLA

Stanford's soph-frosh baseball
team stretched its impressive
record to 21-5 Saturday by
splitting an exciting Bay Area
Collegiate League doubleheader
with Cal here.
The Braves won the opener 5-4
in eight innings. Mickey Aquirre
singled in the tying run in the
bottom of the seventh and Andy
Frank drove in the winning tally
with an eighth inning single. Bob
Scott hurled the final two frames
to get the win, his fifth against no
defeats.

apart, relinquishing four unearned
runs in the top of the seventh
(and final) frame. Cal's Charlie
Brown snuffed an Indian threat in
the bottom half of the inning to
get the win.

by close plays at the plate. Tom
Williams went three for four with
two RBl's in the second game.

Aguirre, Gary Osterhout and Rod
Boone all had two hits. Stanford
is now 8-2 in League play with a
game at Berkeley on Tuesday.

smile adequately expressed his
quiet satisfaction about

Stanford fans.
