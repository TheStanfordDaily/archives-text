# Noon Rally, ROTC Drills
## Anti-violence March Formed 
### 
Plans for a march tonight
protesting the violent anti-ROTC
actions of the last two weeks
clouded yesterday while the
anti-ROTC movement went ahead
with its plan that calls for
extensive action today and
tomorrow.
Anti-ROTC forces plan a
"nude-in" at Navy ROTC drills
today—at 7 a.m. and 3:15 p.m.
Spokesmen for the movement
have said that the protestors will
join the Navy midshipmen in their
weekly marching in the parking
lot behind Encina gym—only the
demonstrators will march nude.
The demonstrators have also
scheduled a noon rally in White
Plaza. At least one of the five who
have been served with injunctions
for their anti-ROTC activities will
speak.
The anti-violence march,
scheduled to begin from White
Plaza at 7:30, is billed by its
organizers as an opportunity for
the community to express its
concern about the violence that
has taken place on campus in Lhe
past two weeks. The organizers
take a neutral stand on ROTC and
feel the march should not take a
formal stand on thy issue either.
ROTC. 'Violenl'
However, the anti-ROTC
movement has said that it will join

in the march. That group feels
that it is the past and continuing
presence of ROTC on campus that
constitutes violence and that that
violence is what should be
opposed.
Another group feels that the
campus violence is the force that
initiated the march and that
should be opposed, but they also
believe that there are institutions
on this campus that perpetuate
violence and that ROTC is one of
these. They are protesting against
both campus violence and ROTC.
A forum on "Southeast Asia:
War, Imperialism, and our
Trustees" is scheduled for
Dinkelspiel Auditorium from 2:15
to 4:15 p.m. today. The
"Teach-In," sponsored by the
anti-ROTC Movement, features
Franz Schurmann, a Berkeley
historian who will speak on "The
Future U.S. Military Strategy in
Asia."
Other speakers include: Jim
Shoch, former Stanford student;
Bink Garrett, a Stanford graduate
and now a political science
graduate student at Brandeis
University; and Harry Cleaver, a
graduate student in economics.
Mass Meeting
The group has scheduled a
mass meeting at 9 a.m. Tuesday in
Frost amphitheater and has
invited the entire community.
Jerry Rubin, a member of the
Chicago "7", has been asked to
speak.
At 11 a.m. the group plans to
move in mass and in a totally
non-violent way to the Trustees
meeting in the Business School.
When they arrive, Ihey will remain
outside and will make no attempt
to disrupt or enter the meeting.

The anti-violence march will
conclude at Memorial Church
with a convocation moderated by
Rev. Wayne Rood, acting dean of
the Chapel, at 8:15. Speakers at
the meeting include: Gordon
Wright, professor of history;
Sanford Dornbusch, professor of
sociology; and Dwight Clark,
director, Volunteers in Asia.
Prof. Dornbusch is expected to
address himself, at least partially,
to the institutions of violence on
campus.
Discussion Croups
Following the speeches three
discussion groups are planned:
one on non-violence, one on
ROTC, and one on violence and
the University.
There is also a possibility that
Paul Rupert, an intern of the
United Campus Ministry and a
member of the anti-ROTC
movement, will address the march
in White Plaza. The anti-ROTC
group has decided that if Rupert
is not allowed to speak, they will
confront the meeting at the end
of the scheduled speakers and ask
the group present that they let
him speak.
Regardless of the decision, the
anti-ROTC people will join all the
discussion groups.
S ta Inn en I
The organizers of the march,
including John Grube, member of
the Council of Presidents, and
Bob Mattson and Hal Mickelson,
candidates for ASSU president,
have issued the following
statement on the march:
"During the past two weeks, we
have witnessed acts of violence
practiced on the Stanford campus
by some who are concerned about
the stii! us of ROTC The I raced v

of these events has been that a
number of students are convinced
that violence is a justifiable and
necessary tactic to produce
change within the University.
"The march and convocation
will allow the community to
express its concern about the
violence that has taken place and
to investigate non-violence as an
alternative.
"We must each take a stand on
ROTC. Some want it off campus;
some want it deprived of credit;
still others want to see it retained
as an academic program for credit.
We must each find a way of
implementing our beliefs. None of
us, however, can be justified in
the use of violence as a tactic in
support of any of these positions.
"All of us should be educated
to what a commitment to a
non-violent stance involves. This is
the purpose of Monday's march
and convocation. The entire
community is invited to
participate."
Pat A. Shea, current member
of the Council of Presidents,
issued a slightly different
statement : "I will be marching to
protest violence as it is
perpetuated by institutions on
campus, specifically ROTC, and
violence as a tactic to change
these institutions."

In an ROTC-related incident, a
graduate student who has spoken
at an anti-ROTC rally said
yesterday that he received a
threatening note in his Menlo Park
residence mail box on Saturday.
The note said "we want you to
know that we know your home
address" and was signed "your
local latent red-necks."
