# New PhD Program In Modern Thought
## 
### 
A new interdisciplinary program to prepare teachers of literature,
leading to the degree of Ph.D. in Modern Thought and Literature, has
been established here.
This program, the first of its kind in the country, assumes at least
some professors of modern literature should be familiar with various
aspects of contemporary culture, and with one or more of the
adjacent disciplines that have affected modern thinkingâ€”dynamic
psychology, philosophy, anthropology, political and social thought.
Candidates for the degree will devote approximately half their time
to the advanced study of a modern literature from the Enlightenment
to the present. The other half will be spent on a coherent but
individually-programmed exploration of related fields.
A further innovation is to encourage students to engage in creative
writing or other artistic activity, with a reasonable amount of this
work to count toward the Ph.D. degree requirements. The sponsoring
committee, chaired by Prof. Albert Guerard (English), believes such
creative work contributes to the development of the teacher and
critic, in part by giving him greater insight into the creative process.
The first students in the program will, in place of written
examinations, collaborate on a book of interdisciplinary studies of
various modern literary problems. They will also join a faculty
committee planning an undergraduate program in modern thought
and literature.
No students from outside Stanford will be admitted before
September, 1971. But a pilot group of four transfers from the English
Department began work this quarter.
According to Prof. Guerard, various attempts to develop similar
programs at other universities have been thwarted in recent years,
partly because of traditional hostility to a modernist emphasis and to
any work in the social sciences by graduate students in literature.
Interdisciplinary studies have gained widely at the undergraduate
level, however, especially in the newer universities, and the demand
for broadly-trained modernists seems certain to increase.
