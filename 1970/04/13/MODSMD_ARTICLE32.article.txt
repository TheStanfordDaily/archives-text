This evening at 7:30 in White Plaza, members of the community
will gather for a MARCH AND CONVOCATION. These events will
produce an opportunity to show concern about the violence that has
occurred on campus in the last two weeks. They should also provide
ideas about what a non-violent stance involves. The Convocation
speakers will be GORDON WRIGHT, Professor of History;
SANFORD DORNBUSCH, Professor of Sociology and member of the
Academic Senate; and DWIGHT CLARK, Director of Volunteers in
Asia. Following the Convocation there will be issue-oriented
discussion groups on non-violence, the status of ROTC at Stanford,
and violence and the University. Faculty, staff, and students are
invited to attend.
