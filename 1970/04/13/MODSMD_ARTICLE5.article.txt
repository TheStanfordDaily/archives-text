# 50 Face SJC Charges; Contempt Citation Filed
## 
### ED KOHN 
Five well-known members of
the anti-ROTC movement have
been ordered to show cause
Thursday morning why they
should not be held in contempt of
court in connection with recent
demonstrations that have
disrupted ROTC activities and a
meeting of the Academic Council.
In addition, University officials
announced last night that they
will "shortly" bring Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) charges
against "approximately 50"
students for violation of the
campus disruption policy.
The charges stem from the
same incidents in which five
persons were ordered to show
cause why they should not be
held in contempt of court.
No further information on the
SJC charges was available last
night.
The five were accused of
violating a Superior Court
injunction issued against 500
supporters of the April 3
Movement (A3M) last May 16.
Civil Contempt
Lennie Siegel, Art Busse, and
John Shoch, all of whom were
named in the injunction issued
last May, were named defendants
in the proceedings. Janet Weiss
and Michael Sweeney, who were
not named in the injunction, were
charged with "aiding and
abetting" the other three
defendants. Sweeney and Siegel
are not students at the present
time.
The University, which filed the
charges Friday, asked that civil
contempt charges be brought
against the five. The maximum
penalty for civil contempt is a
$500 fine, or five days
imprisonment, or both, for each
instance of contempt, according
to a University spokesman. Four

of the defendants face four
counts, while the fifth faces two
counts of contempt.
The Santa Clara County
District Attorney can, however,
ask that criminal contempt
charges be brought against the
defendants. The sentence for
criminal contempt ranges from six
months to two years
imprisonment.
The four will not be tried by
jury.
Four Incidents
Shoch and Busse are presently
on probation on charges stemming
from the SRI demonstrations last
year. If they are found guilty of
contempt of court, their
probation could be revoked and
they could be given additional jail
sentences. Shoch is presently a
candidate for ASSU President.
A hearing on the show cause
order will be held at 9:30 a.m.
Thursday at the North County
Building, 270 Grant Street, Palo
Alto. According to an affidavit
filed by David M. Heilbron, an
attorney for the Board of
Trustees, the citation stems from
the disruption of the Academic
Council meeting April 3, and from
confrontations, a mill-in and
disruption of ROTC classes April
2 and 7.
The injunction, as well as the
University policy on disruptions,
was read to the demonstrators on
each of these occasions. The
demonstrators have left each
protest as soon as the injunction
was read.
More Citations Possible
The show cause order is not
concerned with the rock throwing
that has taken place during the
past two weeks. President Pitzer,
contacted yesterday afternoon by
the Daily, said that charges were
not brought after the
rock-throwing because of
insufficient identification.

"However, more people may
be cited if there are clear
identifications,' 1 Pitzer said.
The five were charged because
"it was a matter of those events
where we have identification of
people who have violated the
campus disruption policy," he
said.
A University 'Obligation 1
James V. Siena, a legal advisor
to Pitzer, said that "the decision
(to ask contempt charges) was
made after we thought that the
facts warranted the charge."
He said that the University
asked for the injunction last year,
acting on its own volition, and
that it has "an obligation to insure
that it is not violated. 1 '
"We're still reviewing the
photographs," Siena said. "I can't
say if and when more charges will
be brought."
Not Fully Served
Pitzer said that the courts
would assume most of the
responsibility where violation of
the injunction is concerned.
"However, this does not mean
that the SJC (Stanford Judicial
Council) cannot be used as a
primary instrument where the
disruptions policy has been
violated," he said.
Copies of the injunction and
the accompanying affidavits have
been served on only three of the
five defendants. John Shoch and
Art Busse are "partially
underground," according to one
Movement spokesman. They must
be served with the papers "at least
two days" before their court
appearance is slated for the
citation to take effect.
I 3 Affidavits
Shoch and Busse made brief
appearances at Frost
Amphitheater Sunday afternoon
at a rock concert by 8,000
persons. Busse held a brief "rap"
and left the area, accompanicd by
several bodyguards, some of
whom were reported to be high

school students. The concert was
sponsored by SCORE (Stanford
Committee on R a d ical
Education).
Included with the injunction
were 13 affidavits filed by
University administrators and a
faculty member, ROTC
instructors and Heilbron, the
Trustees' attorney.
Termed 'Intimidation'
Commenting on the show
cause order, the five defendants
said, "The more effective we have
become the more they have
turned to intimidation and terror
as ways of stopping the
movement . . .
". . . It (the contempt citation)
is merely intimidation and
harassment in a different form.
We are not being tried for any
specific criminal act, and we will
not be allowed a jury. Our rights
of appeal are restricted. The
administration has attempted to
single out "leaders" because they
think that without them there
would be no anti-ROTC
movement. They are wrong. They
are incapable of understanding a
people's movement at Stanford;
just as they are unable to defeat a
people's army in Vietnam . .
In an open letter sent Friday,
the anti-ROTC movement has
invited members of the Board of
Trustees to two open forums to
be held today and tomorrow.
Replying to the letter, W.
Parmer Fuller 111, president of the
Board, said yesterday that "The
present status of Army ROTC is
the result of action of the Faculty
Senate Jan. 22 and the Academic
Council March HO, 1970, based on
recommendations of the
President. It is important to make
that point not only in the interest
of accuracy but also because it
clarifies a fundamental aspect of
the government of the university,
namely that the faculty decides
what courses are worthy of credit
toward a degree at Stanford."

is merely intimidation and

We are not being tried for any
specific criminal act, and we will
not be allowed a jury. Our rights
of appeal are restricted. The
administration has attempted to
single out "leaders" because they
think that without them there
would be no anti-ROTC
movement. They are wrong. They
are incapable of understanding a
people's movement at Stanford;
just as they are unable to defeat a
people's army in Vietnam . .
In an open letter sent Friday,
the anti-ROTC movement has
invited members of the Board of
Trustees to two open forums to
be held today and tomorrow.
Replying to the letter, W.
Parmer Fuller 111, president of the
Board, said yesterday that "The
present status of Army ROTC is
the result of action of the Faculty
Senate Jan. 22 and the Academic
Council March HO, 1970, based on
recommendations of the
President. It is important to make
that point not only in the interest
of accuracy but also because it
clarifies a fundamental aspect of
the government of the university,
namely that the faculty decides
what courses are worthy of credit
toward a degree at Stanford."
Five well-known members of
the anti-ROTC movement have
been ordered to show cause
Thursday morning why they
should not be held in contempt of
court in connection with recent
demonstrations that have
disrupted ROTC activities and a
meeting of the Academic Council.
In addition, University officials
announced last night that they
will "shortly" bring Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) charges
against "approximately 50"
students for violation of the
campus disruption policy.
The charges stem from the
same incidents in which five
persons were ordered to show
cause why they should not be
held in contempt of court.
No further information on the
SJC charges was available last
night.
The five were accused of
violating a Superior Court
injunction issued against 500
supporters of the April 3
Movement (A3M) last May 16.
Civil Contempt
Lennie Siegel, Art Busse, and
John Shoch, all of whom were
named in the injunction issued
last May, were named defendants
in the proceedings. Janet Weiss
and Michael Sweeney, who were
not named in the injunction, were
charged with "aiding and
abetting" the other three
defendants. Sweeney and Siegel
are not students at the present
time.
The University, which filed the
charges Friday, asked that civil
contempt charges be brought
against the five. The maximum
penalty for civil contempt is a
$500 fine, or five days
imprisonment, or both, for each
instance of contempt, according
to a University spokesman. Four

of the defendants face four
counts, while the fifth faces two
counts of contempt.
The Santa Clara County
District Attorney can, however,
ask that criminal contempt
charges be brought against the
defendants. The sentence for
criminal contempt ranges from six
months to two years
imprisonment.
The four will not be tried by
jury.
Four Incidents
Shoch and Busse are presently
on probation on charges stemming
from the SRI demonstrations last
year. If they are found guilty of
contempt of court, their
probation could be revoked and
they could be given additional jail
sentences. Shoch is presently a
candidate for ASSU President.
A hearing on the show cause
order will be held at 9:30 a.m.
Thursday at the North County
Building, 270 Grant Street, Palo
Alto. According to an affidavit
filed by David M. Heilbron, an
attorney for the Board of
Trustees, the citation stems from
the disruption of the Academic
Council meeting April 3, and from
confrontations, a mill-in and
disruption of ROTC classes April
2 and 7.
The injunction, as well as the
University policy on disruptions,
was read to the demonstrators on
each of these occasions. The
demonstrators have left each
protest as soon as the injunction
was read.
More Citations Possible
The show cause order is not
concerned with the rock throwing
that has taken place during the
past two weeks. President Pitzer,
contacted yesterday afternoon by
the Daily, said that charges were
not brought after the
rock-throwing because of
insufficient identification.

"However, more people may
be cited if there are clear
identifications,' 1 Pitzer said.
The five were charged because
"it was a matter of those events
where we have identification of
people who have violated the
campus disruption policy," he
said.
A University 'Obligation 1
James V. Siena, a legal advisor
to Pitzer, said that "the decision
(to ask contempt charges) was
made after we thought that the
facts warranted the charge."
He said that the University
asked for the injunction last year,
acting on its own volition, and
that it has "an obligation to insure
that it is not violated. 1 '
"We're still reviewing the
photographs," Siena said. "I can't
say if and when more charges will
be brought."
Not Fully Served
Pitzer said that the courts
would assume most of the
responsibility where violation of
the injunction is concerned.
"However, this does not mean
that the SJC (Stanford Judicial
Council) cannot be used as a
primary instrument where the
disruptions policy has been
violated," he said.
Copies of the injunction and
the accompanying affidavits have
been served on only three of the
five defendants. John Shoch and
Art Busse are "partially
underground," according to one
Movement spokesman. They must
be served with the papers "at least
two days" before their court
appearance is slated for the
citation to take effect.
I 3 Affidavits
Shoch and Busse made brief
appearances at Frost
Amphitheater Sunday afternoon
at a rock concert by 8,000
persons. Busse held a brief "rap"
and left the area, accompanicd by
several bodyguards, some of
whom were reported to be high

school students. The concert was
sponsored by SCORE (Stanford
Committee on R a d ical
Education).
Included with the injunction
were 13 affidavits filed by
University administrators and a
faculty member, ROTC
instructors and Heilbron, the
Trustees' attorney.
Termed 'Intimidation'
Commenting on the show
cause order, the five defendants
said, "The more effective we have
become the more they have
turned to intimidation and terror

movement . . .

primary instrument where the
disruptions policy has been
violated," he said.
Copies of the injunction and
the accompanying affidavits have
been served on only three of the
five defendants. John Shoch and
Art Busse are "partially
underground," according to one
Movement spokesman. They must
be served with the papers "at least
two days" before their court
appearance is slated for the
citation to take effect.
I 3 Affidavits
Shoch and Busse made brief
appearances at Frost
Amphitheater Sunday afternoon
at a rock concert by 8,000
persons. Busse held a brief "rap"
and left the area, accompanicd by
several bodyguards, some of
whom were reported to be high

school students. The concert was
sponsored by SCORE (Stanford
Committee on R a d ical
Education).
Included with the injunction
were 13 affidavits filed by
University administrators and a
faculty member, ROTC
instructors and Heilbron, the
Trustees' attorney.
Termed 'Intimidation'
Commenting on the show
cause order, the five defendants
said, "The more effective we have
become the more they have
turned to intimidation and terror
as ways of stopping the
movement . . .
". . . It (the contempt citation)
is merely intimidation and
harassment in a different form.
We are not being tried for any
specific criminal act, and we will
not be allowed a jury. Our rights
of appeal are restricted. The
administration has attempted to
single out "leaders" because they
think that without them there
would be no anti-ROTC
movement. They are wrong. They
are incapable of understanding a
people's movement at Stanford;
just as they are unable to defeat a
people's army in Vietnam . .
In an open letter sent Friday,
the anti-ROTC movement has
invited members of the Board of
Trustees to two open forums to
be held today and tomorrow.
Replying to the letter, W.
Parmer Fuller 111, president of the
Board, said yesterday that "The
present status of Army ROTC is
the result of action of the Faculty
Senate Jan. 22 and the Academic
Council March HO, 1970, based on
recommendations of the
President. It is important to make
that point not only in the interest
of accuracy but also because it
clarifies a fundamental aspect of
the government of the university,
namely that the faculty decides
what courses are worthy of credit
toward a degree at Stanford."
Five well-known members of
the anti-ROTC movement have
been ordered to show cause
Thursday morning why they
should not be held in contempt of
court in connection with recent
demonstrations that have
disrupted ROTC activities and a
meeting of the Academic Council.
In addition, University officials
announced last night that they
will "shortly" bring Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) charges
against "approximately 50"
students for violation of the
campus disruption policy.
The charges stem from the
same incidents in which five
persons were ordered to show
cause why they should not be
held in contempt of court.
No further information on the
SJC charges was available last
night.
The five were accused of
violating a Superior Court
injunction issued against 500
supporters of the April 3
Movement (A3M) last May 16.
Civil Contempt
Lennie Siegel, Art Busse, and
John Shoch, all of whom were
named in the injunction issued
last May, were named defendants
in the proceedings. Janet Weiss
and Michael Sweeney, who were
not named in the injunction, were
charged with "aiding and
abetting" the other three
defendants. Sweeney and Siegel
are not students at the present
time.
The University, which filed the
charges Friday, asked that civil
contempt charges be brought
against the five. The maximum
penalty for civil contempt is a
$500 fine, or five days
imprisonment, or both, for each
instance of contempt, according
to a University spokesman. Four

of the defendants face four
counts, while the fifth faces two
counts of contempt.
The Santa Clara County
District Attorney can, however,
ask that criminal contempt
charges be brought against the
defendants. The sentence for
criminal contempt ranges from six
months to two years
imprisonment.
The four will not be tried by
jury.
Four Incidents
Shoch and Busse are presently
on probation on charges stemming
from the SRI demonstrations last
year. If they are found guilty of
contempt of court, their
probation could be revoked and
they could be given additional jail
sentences. Shoch is presently a
candidate for ASSU President.
A hearing on the show cause
order will be held at 9:30 a.m.
Thursday at the North County
Building, 270 Grant Street, Palo
Alto. According to an affidavit
filed by David M. Heilbron, an
attorney for the Board of
Trustees, the citation stems from
the disruption of the Academic
Council meeting April 3, and from
confrontations, a mill-in and
disruption of ROTC classes April
2 and 7.
The injunction, as well as the
University policy on disruptions,
was read to the demonstrators on
each of these occasions. The
demonstrators have left each
protest as soon as the injunction
was read.
More Citations Possible
The show cause order is not
concerned with the rock throwing
that has taken place during the
past two weeks. President Pitzer,
contacted yesterday afternoon by
the Daily, said that charges were
not brought after the
rock-throwing because of
insufficient identification.

"However, more people may
be cited if there are clear
identifications,' 1 Pitzer said.
The five were charged because
"it was a matter of those events
where we have identification of
people who have violated the
campus disruption policy," he
said.
A University 'Obligation 1
James V. Siena, a legal advisor
to Pitzer, said that "the decision
(to ask contempt charges) was
made after we thought that the
facts warranted the charge."
He said that the University
asked for the injunction last year,
acting on its own volition, and
that it has "an obligation to insure
that it is not violated. 1 '
"We're still reviewing the
photographs," Siena said. "I can't
say if and when more charges will
be brought."
Not Fully Served
Pitzer said that the courts
would assume most of the
responsibility where violation of
the injunction is concerned.
