# GM Proxies For Nader
## Trustees To Decide 
### EMMA PRICE 
Today two Trustee
committees, the Committee on
Academic Affairs and the
Committee on Finance, will
consider whether to vote
Stanford's 21,189 shares of
General Motors stock to Ralph
Nader's Project on Corporate
Responsibility or to GM
management.
The Trustees must both
evaluate Nader's proposals, and,
more basically, they must
consider the question of whether
Stanford should take into account
the political and social

implications of investment
decisions.
Nader, the consumer crusader,
feels that American companies
have tended to ignore the public
consequences of their corporate
decisions. One way to remedy this
situation, he argues, is to go
directly to the theoretical owners
of the company: the stockholders.
Nader's group has decided to
try this approach on General
Motors because they feel this
company has been negligent in
three key areas: pollution control,
minority hiring, and consumer
protection. They have therefore

placed two proposals on the GM
ballot. One adds three members
representative of the public
interest to the Board of Directors.
The second establishes a
watch-dog committee to issue a
report on GM's performance in
regard to the three areas.
Support
So far the Project has gained
some illustrious support from
educational institutions. The
Trustee Investment Committee of
the University of Pennsylvania
unanimously decided to vote that
school's 29,893 shares to the
group.
The University of Michigan will
hold an election of faculty and
students, then divide the proxies
on its 27,438 shares according to
the percentage vote count.
has never before
considered social responsibility in
investment decisions. The idea
that the University's GM stocks
should be voted to Nader was first
pre posed to the Trustee Finance
Committee by Bob Grant, student
member.
It appeared on the Board's
March agenda as a discussion item.
Further Study
The matter was then turned
over to the President's staff for
further study. Generally the
President makes a
recommendation to the Trustees
on issues referred to him.
President Pitzer has, however,
decided not to make any
recommendation in this case.
Instead, he will present a
supposedly impartial analysis of
the issue,
The President plans to vote his
personal GM stocks in favor of the
first Nader proposal, and possibly
the second.
There are two chief matters
which the Committees of the
Board must decide today. One is
whether Stanford as an institution
should make moral, social or
political decisions.
Opposing Argument
Those who feel the answer is
"no" argue that the fiduciary
responsibility of the Trustees is to
make money for the university.
The argument in favor of
considering social implications in
investment decision is that any
share holder, as owner of a
company, has a moral duty to
make sure that the company's
policies are not opposed to his
own feelings.
Further, it states educational
institutions are supposedly
directed toward the furtherment
of knowledge and the betterment
of humanity. Stanford should
then attempt to express this
philosophy in all its activities,
including invertment decisions.
