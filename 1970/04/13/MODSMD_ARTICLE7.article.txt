that the Mattson, Beam ticket
includes Bob Cory although
Cory's name will not be on the
ballot; similarly the Shea-Grant

A referendum on ROTC will
ask if ROTC should continue at
Stanford and, it so, whether it
should be granted credit

and limited to those paying an
annual membership fee. A
two thirds majority is necessary
for passage.
fimple majority votes will be
required to set fee levels for
support of public events and for
the Daily, and to establish the
ASSU program fee.

units will select senior class
officers from among the following
slates: the council of Roman
Buhler, B.S. Jordan, 111, C.W.
Combs, and Kevin Porter; the
