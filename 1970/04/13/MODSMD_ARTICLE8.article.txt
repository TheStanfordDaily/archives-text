# Dual Standard

A lot of us are past the point of surprise when the
University tries to use external agencies to police internal
dissent. Officials have made it perfectly clear that they will
use the courts to stop disruptions and window-smashing.
What is terribly unclear though, is why the University took
the risks of serving injunctions and why it chose to
prosecute the people it did.
President Pitzer has taken a tremendous risk; the five so
far charged may become martyrs. If they do become martyrs
to a sizable segment of the community, all the police in the
Bay Area won't be able to control the crowd, let alone stop
further destruction of property. At the moment perhaps
200 support the rock-throwing. Pitzer and his
administration have stated both publicly and privately that
the one thing they fear is police brutalizing students, for
this would allow the student radicals to form another
broad-based movement like the A3M. Apparently President
Pitzer and his aides feel that there will be little student
reaction to trying students in the courts.
Like the Justice Department and the Chicago 7 they
may be wrong in this case for three good reasons. First, the
order to show cause seems, at least to the non-legalist, to
presume prior guilt on the part of the five radicals. Few arc
willing to accept anything that smacks of prior guilt, for the
American legal tradition is too ingrained even in the most
radical of us.
Second, to anyone following the disturbances it seems
the University picked on some of the wrong people. John
Shoch for instance was not a leader, and his prosecution is
too coincidental for comfort. The idea may well take hold
that the University was persecuting him as a well known
student leader, rather than a leading radical.
Third, and perhaps most important is the overwhelming
sense that the Administration is once again chucking the
Legislative and Judicial system. Trying some students in
Superior Court and some in the Stanford Judicial Council is
hardly an endearing tactic. Why bother to have a student
judicial system when it is only used selectively? If the
students involved had broken windows at Cal as a Big Game
prank, we can hardly imagine the University reverting to the
courts. However, when students smash windows to
challenge the legitimacy of an Administration-Faculty
Senate-Trustee decision they are remanded to the courts for
action. Perhaps the Administration feels jail sentences are
more threatening than SJC imposed fines or suspensions.
They are right: but a double standard for political and
non-political crimes is more troubling to most students than
court action. And that is the risk the Administration takes.
Martyrdom is a difficult phenomenon to cope with, either
for a University Administration or a Republican
Administration. Choosing not to use a community
sanctioned judicial system is at the very least a dangerous
tactic. In the shortrun, it can cause bad feelings, martrydom
and possibly violence beyond the imaginations of the
Administration. In the long run, it destroys the University's
only hope for avoiding this kind of dispute: a sense of
community and the sanctity of community decisions.
Disregard of a fledgling judicial system, sanctioned by three
constituencies of the University, is a pretty good way to
destroy other community institutions.
