# Time To Talk

The Stanford Trustees have received a letter inviting
them to join in open discussion about ROTC. If they intend
to inject responsibility into their questionable participation
in University governance, they must put aside misgivings
and accept that invitation.
More than $15,000 worth of damage has been done in
reaction to ROTC arrangements. Nine people face jail. The
time is long overdue for students to question the Board
about its influenee in the controversial ROTC plans, and for
the Board to face its constituentsâ€” of all political
persuasions.
Stanford's Trustees often maintain that they have no
power that they play a purely formal role in governing the
University. But President Pitzer himself has acknowledged
their influence. In a January 28 news conference, he
explained:
"This (the ROTC issue) is one area in which all sorts of
friends of the University are concerned. So I thought that if
it was possible to compromise with these groups (alumni,
Trustees and other outside friends) it was best to do so."
A list of the Trustees' corporate ties- Lockheed, General
Dynamics, Hewlett-Packard, and more points out another,
very direct interest in this country's defense establishment.
Pleas of powerlessness cannot cloak the Trustees' role in
the ROTC deliberations and in governing the University
roles which must be openly, reasonably discussed. Several
leaders of the anti-ROTC movement have assured us that
their invitation was made in good faith. Students on all sides
of the question will be allowed to speak. The Trustees will
not be shouted down.
Those who oppose window-breaking have often pointed
out that the University can and should be a haven for
rational, open discussion. The Trustees have the
opportunity indeed, the obligation to fulfill that ideal
today. This powerful element in the University rarely comes
to campus; its contacts with students are even more unique.
The University is facing a crisis which deeply involves the
Trustees. We will be waiting in Memorial Church.
