Spring Time . . . Engagement Time
Spring — when a young man's fancy turns to Love and Ro
mance. A Diamond Engagement Ring is one of the most
glorious ways to symbolize your future together. The Diamond
Engagement Rings shown were particularly selected for fine
color, cutting, clarity, and exceptional brilliance—for their
quality of which we are justly proud.
