# Astronauts Move To Lunar Module
## Apollo 13 Aborted As Craft Loses Power 
### 
SPACE CENTER, HOUSTON (AP) - The Apollo
13 astronauts, carrying a diminished oxygen
supply, fired their only working rocket Tuesday to
start their disabled spacecraft on an arc around the
moon and then back to earth. Their moon landing
mission wa; cancelled and they were more than
200,000 miles from home.
Astronauts James A. Lovell Jr., John L. Swigert
Jr. and Fred W. Haise Jr. fired the descent engine
of the small lunar lander, Aquarius, without which
they would have been trapped forever in orbit
around the moon.
Officials said the situation was "under control
.We have a safe situation at the moment."
Christopher C. Kraft, deputy director of the
Manned Spacecraft Center, said, "If the situation
remains stabilized, there is no question that we can
bring them back to earth safely."
Oxygen Tank Leak
A serious drop in electrical power Monday night
signaled the beginning of the emergency. Mission
Control said the command ship had a major leak
from one of the super-cold oxygen storage tanks.
What caused the leak was unknown. The impact of
a meteor was considered one remote possibility.
The astronauts, fighting to keep enough air to
survive until they return to earth, siphoned oxygen
from the moon lander. The ruptured tank
exhausted the oxygen from the command ship.
The moon lander, still attached to the command
ship, was to have taken astronauts Lovell and
Haise to the moon's surface Wednesday. Now it
must keep the three spacemen alive.

"This is as serious a situation as we have ever
had in manned space flight," said Kraft.
Friends and neighbors quickly gathered at the
homes of Lovell and Haise.
Apollo 12 astronaut Charles Conrad went to the
Lovell house to comfort Mrs. Lovell and her four
children.
"She's pretty calm, but tense," said Conrad as
he left the house on a motorcycle. In answer to a
question, he said: "Sure, they'll make it. Of
course, it's always a shame to give up a mission."
Families React
"I'm not saying another word until Jim gets
back home," Marilyn Lovell told newsmen.
Astronaut Alan L. Bean went to the home of
Haise. Mrs. Haise has three children and is
expecting another in June.
Swigert is a bachelor and has no family here.
Must Circle Moon
Officials said the Apollo 13 astronauts will
depend on the small moon landing craft docked to
the command ship as a life boat. It is providing
them with oxygen and electrical power, both vital
to survival in space.
Officials said Apollo 13 would have to circle the
moon in order to return to earth. This path was
faster than turning around and returning directly
to earth because the spacecraft picks up speed
from the gravity of the moon. The moon's
gravitational field will whip Apollo 13 around and
send it back toward the earth.
Friday Landing
The spacecraft is expected to land on earth

sometime Friday.
Officials at the Houston Space Center,
appearing calm but clearly concerned, said
preparations were being made for the craft to land
either in the Pacific or Atlantic Ocean depending
on flight developments and that aid would be
accepted in the Atlantic Ocean from the ships of
any nation.
In their desperate journey home, the astronauts
will ride with two spacemen in the command ship
and one in the smaller lunar module. The
astronaut in the moon lander must be always
awake and alert to assure the systems continue to
operate. Oxygen is fed into the command module
through a tunnel in the moon lander.
Uncontrolled gyrations, thought to be caused
by the venting of the oxygen, caused the
spacecraft to toss and twist out of control at
several points after the emergency began.
It was several minutes before Mission Control
announced the source of the problem: a critical
leak in the supercold oxygen storage tank of the
command ship. What caused the leak was not
known.
Normal Living Impossible
The loss of oxygen made remaining in the
command ship impossible, and Mission Control
began giving the spacemen procedures to follow
for occupying the moon lander.
The lunar module on which their life depends is
designed to support only two men but can
accommodate three in emergencies. Never before

have three depended on its limited electrical and
oxygen supplies for survival in space.
The astronauts are expected to fire the descent
engine of the moon ander as they pass behind the
moon. This rocket firing will break the gravity
hold of the moon and start the trio homeward.
Remain In LEM
The spacemen probably will ride in the lunar
module, until they approach the earth's
atmosphere.
They may then return to the command module
and use its small remaining oxygen and batteries to
return to earth.
The lunar module is not designed to fly in
earth's atmosphere and would dissolve in fire if
they attempted to land in it.
Cell Rupture
The emergency developed first as a major loss of
electrical power.
An oxygen tank supplying an electrical power
cell in the spacecraft apparently ruptured.
Flight Director Glynn Lunney said oxygen
pressure in the spacecraft was dropping alarmingly.
Power Surge
Moments later the astronauts began transferring
to the lunar module.
Lovell sounded the warning of the sudden
emergency:
"Houston, we've got? a problem. . .a problem
with the on board electrical power system."
He then described the sudden power surge
which knocked out two of the craft's three
electrical producing fuel cells.
