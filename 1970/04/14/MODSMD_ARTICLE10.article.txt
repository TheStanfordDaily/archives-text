David Harris cast a long shadow which colored ASSU for
several terms after his resignation. This year vestigages of his
kind of creativity have shaded curriculum innovation; the
Student Center and SWOPSI are a credit to his challenging
vision.
But in many ways student government has been walking
not in the shadow, but in the darkness. Each week the
Senate plays a gloomy scene of egotistical rivalry, obscuring
chances for students to be taken seriously-even by
themselves-in University government.
The ASSU executive has also been obscured. Most of its
time has been spent shuffling through the University
bureaucracy and demonstrating its reflexes during crisis
situations. It has not offered consistent, resourceful
leadership. It has succumbed to a pattern laid out by the
structure of student government, a pattern which vexes
every ASSU president a pattern which must be shattered by
bold leadership if students are to be represented effectively
against at Stanford.
Generally the silhouettes cast by this year's presidential
candidates hardly appear bold. While the
Shea-Mickelson-Grant-Levin ticket waxes strong for student
services, it minimizes larger political concerns. Services are
an important and direct relationship between students and
their government. But the ASSU executive has more of a
responsibility. He must press the deep political and moral
convictions for a student constituency with few outlets for
expression.
The Mattson-Cory-Beam slate concerns itself more with
expression of beliefs, and advocates creation of a new
student-faculty-administration council to deal with them.
The mechanism may open many channels, but opening
channels is only half the battle, and we wonder how firmly
this slate can press any of the political beliefs students hold.
The Hukari-Rael duo certainly represents a definite
concern the atrophy of all but the basic ASSU functions.
Hukari's stand destroys only organization which can
realistically be expected to press full time. This unique
potential should not be sacrificed.
Kitsman and Pratt may intend to use their positions
effectively, but their qualifications for grappling with other
segments of the University seem minimal.
We find in John Shoeh and Bill livers the best chance for
making ASSU government the diligent student advocate that
it should be. Their campaign has promised a stance apart
from the tangle of university bureaucracy and
administration pressure. They want to shake up the
structure and re-define the University community to
eliminate government domination through programs like
ROTC; to establish community control by eliminating the
Board of Trustees.
These kind of radical plans are the kind of bold initiative
of the spirit missing from ASSU government in the recent
years.
The students need more than liberal politicians who can
carry through on programs effectively but get co-opted in
the morass of the President's office. Rather we need
boldness and the refusal to accept the old assumptions
which is inherent in the Shoch-Evers ticket.

several terms after his resignation. This year vestigages of his
kind of creativity have shaded curriculum innovation; the
Student Center and SWOPSI are a credit to his challenging
vision.
But in many ways student government has been walking
not in the shadow, but in the darkness. Each week the
Senate plays a gloomy scene of egotistical rivalry, obscuring
chances for students to be taken seriously-even by
themselves-in University government.
The ASSU executive has also been obscured. Most of its
time has been spent shuffling through the University
bureaucracy and demonstrating its reflexes during crisis
situations. It has not offered consistent, resourceful
leadership. It has succumbed to a pattern laid out by the
structure of student government, a pattern which vexes
every ASSU president a pattern which must be shattered by
bold leadership if students are to be represented effectively
against at Stanford.
Generally the silhouettes cast by this year's presidential
candidates hardly appear bold. While the
Shea-Mickelson-Grant-Levin ticket waxes strong for student
services, it minimizes larger political concerns. Services are
an important and direct relationship between students and
their government. But the ASSU executive has more of a
responsibility. He must press the deep political and moral
convictions for a student constituency with few outlets for
expression.
The Mattson-Cory-Beam slate concerns itself more with
expression of beliefs, and advocates creation of a new
student-faculty-administration council to deal with them.
The mechanism may open many channels, but opening
channels is only half the battle, and we wonder how firmly
this slate can press any of the political beliefs students hold.
The Hukari-Rael duo certainly represents a definite
concern the atrophy of all but the basic ASSU functions.
Hukari's stand destroys only organization which can
realistically be expected to press full time. This unique
potential should not be sacrificed.
Kitsman and Pratt may intend to use their positions
effectively, but their qualifications for grappling with other
segments of the University seem minimal.
We find in John Shoeh and Bill livers the best chance for
making ASSU government the diligent student advocate that
it should be. Their campaign has promised a stance apart
from the tangle of university bureaucracy and
administration pressure. They want to shake up the
structure and re-define the University community to
eliminate government domination through programs like
ROTC; to establish community control by eliminating the
Board of Trustees.
These kind of radical plans are the kind of bold initiative
of the spirit missing from ASSU government in the recent
years.
The students need more than liberal politicians who can
carry through on programs effectively but get co-opted in
the morass of the President's office. Rather we need
boldness and the refusal to accept the old assumptions
which is inherent in the Shoch-Evers ticket.
David Harris cast a long shadow which colored ASSU for
