# Inside View
## Another Cadet Speaks 
### Kirk Hanson 
I am a member of Naval ROTC
at Stanford. I am real and will sign
my name to this column. I will
also vote "no" later this week on
whether ROTC programs should
be granted special status on
campus or academic credit.
I feel it is important I speak
out now to show that there is a
diversity of opinion within ROTC
and to show that the structure
does not completely crush every
individual who expresses a
contrary view.
My first concern is for
academic freedom within the
University. Whenever any program
advocates a particular moral or
political philosophy or is
controlled and directed by a
power external to the University,
I believe academic freedom is
compromised.
ROTC programs presume that
violence may be used to redress
wrongs or achieve one's
objectives. Furthermore, they
presume that a man may bind
himself to unswerving loyalty to
the President as armed forces
commander-in-chief. A large
number of individuals may
contend that these are not moral
decisions, but I believe they are.
Furthermore, an individual has a
reasonable expectation of the
type of actions the military will
be involved in during his service
and thus his participation in the
military constitutes an affirmation
of the values of those actions.
Secondly, the ROTC programs
ire directly controlled from

outside the University. ROTC
instructors cannot assume the role
of independent members of the
University community because of
their disciplinary ties to the
military. Even the ROTC student
becomes bound by that external
power via the punitive clause.
My conclusion from this
analysis is that ROTC programs
must be denied special status in
the University. The University
should establish neither a
department nor a center for
military studies; faculty status
should not be granted to military
instructors; university resources
should not be offered free to
ROTC programs; and no special
consideration should be given to
accrediting courses for those who
participate in ROTC programs.
I do not agree with those who
would unconditionally eliminate
ROTC programs from the campus.
Academic freedom further
demands that any group of
students be free to associate
themselves in an extracurricular
activity called ROTC and that
they have the right to petition for
academic credit for proposed
courses either through
departmental channels or through
those procedures for accrediting
undergraduate specials.
I believe the University must
hold firm on all the foregoing
principles. It can permit academic
freedom to be broached neither
for the sake of the military
services nor for popular anti-war
or anti-ROTC sentiment.
