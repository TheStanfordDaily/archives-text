# 'Bring Campus Alive'
## Special Events Fee 
### Bennett Cullum 
The ASSU Entertainment
Proposition has been proposed
with a single purpose in mind: to
bring the Stanford campus alive
with a far-reaching but
well-balanced entertainment
program.
To this end the Committee for
the ASSU Entertainment
Proposition has placed on the
primary election ballot a proposal
to assess each student $1.00 per
quarter for the 1970-71 academic
year. If approved, this assessment
would make available $41,000 as
a reserve from which the ASSU
Special Events Board, on its own
initiative and with the
cooperation of other interested
groups, can organize a viable
entertainment program whose
broad spectrum of activities
would offer something to nearly
all members of the Stanford
community.
Administration ol (he Fund
The administration of this
entertainment fund would be
vested in the ASSU Special Events
Board, an agency composed of
students with a reservoir of
experience in a variety of
entertainment media. The ASSU
Senate would not be able to divert
this money to any other
expenditure.
On its own, the Special Events
Board would arrange a program of
at least three concerts per quarter
(one folk, one rock, and one
symphonic) in addition to a series
of lectures and current films. In
keeping with the nature of
student sponsorship of these
activities, student admission
would be maintained at the lowest
possible level consistent with
sound financial practices.
The Fund a* Reserve
The fund would also serve as a
reserve from which enterprising
campus groups with definite plans
could receive monetary assistance.
For example, dramatic
organizations whose budgets have
been reduced or, as in the case of
SRT, totally eliminated would be
able to request support from the
Special Events Board in order to
continue their activities.

The Special Events Board
would review such applications
for funding in light of the
potential benefit of the activity to
the entire student body. If the
Board determines that the request
for support is justified, funds
would be forwarded to the
organization for preliminary
expenses. After the production
was completed, the independent
organization would return to the
fund the amount borrowed plus a
very small percentage of any
profits as a service charge. For its
part, the Special Events Board
would, upon request, assist the
organization in matters of
technical production and
facilities.
Why $1.00 per Quarter
The Committee for the ASSU
Entertainment Proposition
decided upon the amount $1.00
per quarter for several reasons. In
the first instance, $1.00 per
quarter is needed in order to
establish a fund large enough to
bring to campus such big-name
groups as the following: Blood,
Sweat and Tears—minimum
$15,000. Crosby, Stills, Nash and
Young —minimum $12,500.
Credence Clearwater—minimum
$25,000.
In each case these groups
require that a downpayment of at
least one-half of their guarantee
be remitted at the time the
contract is signed. This year the
ASSU could not afford such
groups because the Special Events
budget was less than $3000 and
the ASSU Senate was unable or
unwilling to use funds from the
ASSU general reserves to
underwrite such concerts. With a
fund of approximately $41,000
by the end of next year, the
Special Events Board would be
able to afford big-name groups as
well as help local campus
organizations.
The amount $1.00 per quarter
was also selected because of the
fact that the Special Events Board
would guarantee that student
admission to any of the activities
under its direct sponsorship would
be at least $1.00 less than general

admission. In other words, if a
student attended only one of
three concerts per quarter, his
$1.00 investment in
entertainment would be returned
to him.
Sense of Community
In closing, we would like to
remind each student that a great
deal has been said in recent years
about creating a sense of
community at this University. We
believe that an assessment of
$1.00 per student per quarter for
a comprehensive entertainment
plan is a simple, effective, and

economical means of founding a
program which offers a hope of a
substantive beginning towards this
sense of community.
On the basis of these
arguments, the Committee
commends this assessment
proposition to the consideration
of the student body in the hope
that each student will vote YES
on this proposal in the ASSU
election.
