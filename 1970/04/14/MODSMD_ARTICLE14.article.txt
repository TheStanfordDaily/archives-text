# DAILY Proposition
## Drastic Reduction 
### 
By petition of more than 950
students, a proposition asking for
a special $1 assessment for the
Daih is appearing on the ASSU
ballot Wednesday and Thursday.
If Stanford is to have a daily
newspaper next year, the
proposition must pass.
Under an old -ASSU
constitution by-law, the paper
automatically received 85 cents
per quarter per student. The funds
total about $28,000 each
year —one-fifth of the paper's
budget.
Using this money and
advertising revenue, the Daily has
published five days a week with
an average size of six pages. This
quarter we have averaged seven
pages a day, and have often felt
cramped for space in covering
last-breaking stories and their
complex backgrounds
Next year, under the new
ASSU constitution, the Dail> will
not automatically receive student
subscription fees. Without them
the paper would be reduced to an
average size of four pages and
published onl> three times each
H erk .
The first logical question is
why can't the Dail> increase
advertising revenue to make up
the slack? Frankly, the local ad
market is saturated, and the
paper's contract with a national
advertising agency provides as
many national ads as possible. A
jump of $28,000 in advertising
revenue is, unfortunately, out of
the quest ion.

The second logical inquiry asks
why the campus needs a six-page
daily newspaper at all. It
doesn't—if students are content
with no daily announcements, no
sports coverage except of major
events, no film and theatre
reviews, little space for
contributed opinion columns, and
drastically curtailed news
coverage.
The third inevitable query asks
why the I>aiI> needs $1 a quarter
next year when it only needed 85
cents a quarter before.
In fact, the 85 cent level, set
several years ago, has not always
proved adequate. In an effort to
furnish the latest and most
complete coverage of last spring's
demonstrations, the newspaper
mounted a debt of several
thousand dollars. The overtime
printing costs and extra pages
which good coverage sometimes
demand do not come cheaply.
To account for inflation and
to begin building financial reserves
for improved coverage, we ask for
a 15 cent raise. Hopefully it will
also be the nest-egg of reserves
which can eventually make the
l)ail> financially independent and
free for all students.
Stanford's daily newspaper is
the only frequent, effective means
of communication for a
community of more than 15,000
people. Isn't that worth a dollar?
