# Fee Election
## Why The Ballot? 
### David Swift 
This week, and possibly next,
students at Stanford will have an
opportunity, their first in many
years, to decide how much
financial support ASSU sponsored
activities should receive. The
ASSU Fee Election will determine
how much each student shall
contribute each quarter to ASSU
and the divisional associations.
In past years ASSU has
received $3/student/qtr., and
because the size of the student
population was rapidly increasing
yearly the University contribution
to ASSU from general funds also
increased. However, as tuition was
spiraling upwards, the percentage
of each student's tuition remitted
to ASSU for student services was
rapidly declining. For example, in
1964-65 tuition was $470/qtr.,
and the ratio of ASSU fee to
tuition was .0064.
In 1968-69 tuition was
$64 0/qtr., and the ratio was
.0047. Thus while tuition was
increased by 32 percent
(supposedly to reflect rising
costs), the percentage of tuition
remited to ASSU was reduced by
more than 25 percent. ASSU was

locked in a financial position
which, due to inflation, could be
expected only to get
worse—unless there could be
found a means to generate
additional revenues.
Then, in 1969 the old ASSU
Constitution was scrapped and the
current one approved. One of the
important changes brought about
by the new Constitution was in
the area of finance. According to
the new Constitution the student
body as a whole will decide how
much monetary support they will
contribute to their Association.
The University will act as
collecting agent, and remit the
monies so collected directly to
ASSU.
While the original intent of the
Constitution seemed to be that
both the basic operating expenses
(ASSU office, 5.0. F., judicial,,
etc.) and the program expenses
(Axe Comm., MECHA, DAILY)
would be assessed over and above
tuition, it was interpreted that the
University could contribute the
amount necessary for operations
(a considerable reduction from
their current level of $123,000)

from general funds. The students
will therefore only have to be
assessed for the programs of
ASSU.
The new Constitution provides
that one-half of all program fees
will be allocated by ASSU as the
Senate sees fit, while one-half will
be remited by ASSU to divisional
associations on a per capita basis.
For example, the GSB Student
Association, with 650 students
each of whom paid $3/qtr., would
receive $975/qtr. as their share of
the program fee, while ASSU
would allocate the other $975.
This year, fiscal 1969-70, the
ASSU is receiving $123,000 from
Stanford general funds. This
works out to a little more than
$3/student/qtr., although the
funding is not on a per capita
basis. The ASSU Senate has
allocated $85,285 to programs, of
which $28,500 has gone to the
support of the STANFORD
DAILY.
This means, assuming the
DAILY is funded by a successful
special referendum, that ASSU
will need $56,785 in revenues to
maintain its current level of
support for programs If this were
to come from program fees, it
would be necessary to collect
$113,570, since half the funds go
to divisional associations.
Assuming an average of 11,000
students/qtr. during fall, winter,
and spring, and 4,000 during
summer, the cost per student
would be $3.07.
If none of the four numbers
receives a majority of the votes
cast, the two receiving the largest
number of votes will be placed on
a final ballot next week. If one
number receives a majority of the
votes cast in the first election, it
will become the program fee for
next year.
Write-ins are not permitted on
the fee ballot. The numbers
thereon were selected by the
Senate, although any number
could have also been placed on
the ballot by petition signed by 5
percent of the student body, as is
indicated in the Constitution.

locked in a financial position
which, due to inflation, could be
expected only to get
worse—unless there could be
found a means to generate
additional revenues.
Then, in 1969 the old ASSU
Constitution was scrapped and the
current one approved. One of the
important changes brought about
by the new Constitution was in
the area of finance. According to
the new Constitution the student
body as a whole will decide how
much monetary support they will
contribute to their Association.
The University will act as
collecting agent, and remit the
monies so collected directly to
ASSU.
While the original intent of the
Constitution seemed to be that
both the basic operating expenses
(ASSU office, 5.0. F., judicial,,
etc.) and the program expenses
(Axe Comm., MECHA, DAILY)
would be assessed over and above
tuition, it was interpreted that the
University could contribute the
amount necessary for operations
(a considerable reduction from
their current level of $123,000)

from general funds. The students
will therefore only have to be
assessed for the programs of
ASSU.
The new Constitution provides
that one-half of all program fees
will be allocated by ASSU as the
Senate sees fit, while one-half will
be remited by ASSU to divisional
associations on a per capita basis.
For example, the GSB Student
Association, with 650 students
each of whom paid $3/qtr., would
receive $975/qtr. as their share of
the program fee, while ASSU
would allocate the other $975.
This year, fiscal 1969-70, the
ASSU is receiving $123,000 from
Stanford general funds. This
works out to a little more than
$3/student/qtr., although the
funding is not on a per capita
basis. The ASSU Senate has
allocated $85,285 to programs, of
which $28,500 has gone to the
support of the STANFORD
DAILY.
This means, assuming the
DAILY is funded by a successful
special referendum, that ASSU
will need $56,785 in revenues to
maintain its current level of
support for programs If this were
to come from program fees, it
would be necessary to collect
$113,570, since half the funds go
to divisional associations.
Assuming an average of 11,000
students/qtr. during fall, winter,
and spring, and 4,000 during
summer, the cost per student
would be $3.07.
If none of the four numbers
receives a majority of the votes
cast, the two receiving the largest
number of votes will be placed on
a final ballot next week. If one
number receives a majority of the
votes cast in the first election, it
will become the program fee for
next year.
Write-ins are not permitted on
the fee ballot. The numbers
thereon were selected by the
Senate, although any number
could have also been placed on
the ballot by petition signed by 5
percent of the student body, as is
indicated in the Constitution.

Financial Manager.)
This week, and possibly next,
students at Stanford will have an
opportunity, their first in many
years, to decide how much
financial support ASSU sponsored
activities should receive. The
ASSU Fee Election will determine
how much each student shall
contribute each quarter to ASSU
and the divisional associations.
In past years ASSU has
received $3/student/qtr., and
because the size of the student
population was rapidly increasing
yearly the University contribution
to ASSU from general funds also
increased. However, as tuition was
spiraling upwards, the percentage
of each student's tuition remitted
to ASSU for student services was
rapidly declining. For example, in
1964-65 tuition was $470/qtr.,
and the ratio of ASSU fee to
tuition was .0064.
In 1968-69 tuition was
$64 0/qtr., and the ratio was
.0047. Thus while tuition was
increased by 32 percent
(supposedly to reflect rising
costs), the percentage of tuition
remited to ASSU was reduced by
more than 25 percent. ASSU was

locked in a financial position
which, due to inflation, could be
expected only to get
worse—unless there could be
found a means to generate
additional revenues.
