# One Manâ€™s Fantasy
## On Digging El Camino 
### Nick Selby 
Such a pleasant and charming stretch of
concrete! Why, I believe it unsurpassed by any
similar strip in the entire cosmos. Three lanes each
way! Hungry? Out of gas or booze? Want to buy a
billiards table? Well, just come along with me,
won't you, I can tell you where to go.
Now, from the same land known as the home of
the brave, from the same nation that gave you
Martha Mitchell and the Southern strategy, comes
another team of real winners: the Orange Julius,
Jack-in-the-Box cola, A7W Root Beer., and Winton
M. Blount.
Yes, from the same 'brain' that gave you postal
reform, draft reform,My Lai, and Bob Hope, come
ten of the most delightful miles you could ever
hope to travel: presenting for the first time
anywhere, the King's privy, El Camino Real!
California's very own Penny Lane.
The Grand Totals
Have you ever stopped to count the number of
hamburger stands between Redwood City and Los
Altos? Have you ever dared? (Imagine the pounds
of grease consumed every day.) To be precise, there
are twenty-two burger bars.
To be even more precise, an official count
includes:
Forty-nine gas stations; thirty-one motels,
hotels, and assorted flophouses; nineteen banks
and income tax return centers; sixty-seven
restaurants, restaurants-and-bars, plain old bars,
pizza parlors, snack shoppes, coffee houses, and
anuthing else not properly classified as a
hamburger stand; sixty-two car lots (from jalopies
to Cadillacs) and car accessory dealers, pushing

tires, mufflers, motorcycles, trailers, spare parts,
radios, stereo tape decks, and what-not.
I found three miracles along El Camino: first,
that anyone in his right mind would work there
day after day and consider it a privilige to be
situated in the mid-peninsula; second, the roses
somehow surviving the omnipresent clouds of
automobile exhaust, gayly blooming along
Stanford's wire fence that keeps interested parties
out; and third, the five or six horses which roam at
will through the future Dillingham site.
I wonder if those horses are preventing
construction of more banks, offices, and hotel
facilities? Forgive this parenthetical fantasy, but I
find it difficult to believe, after going up and down
El Camino, that we really need Dillingham, etc.
Perhaps those Grass Roots folk are on to
something.
Without admitting guilt, I remember little less
than a year ago walking along this highway after
the SRI demonstration. There were about five
hundred to a thousand of us, marching, singing,
chanting such wildly insurrectionary slogans as
"Two-four-six-eight-Organize to smash the state!"
and "Ho! Ho! Ho Chi Minh! The NLF is going to
win!" Wow! This was an ecstatic triumph over El
Camino Real, let me tell you.
It seems to me that if anyone really must throw
rocks, he can start with those hamburger stands.
After all, imperialism may be only the outward
symptom of indigestion.
Just remember: the Gainesburger of today is the
cheeseburger of tomorrow.
HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH?
