## A 						Voluntary ASSU 
### Chris Hocker 
No individual should be
coerced into joining an
organization, especially one which
performs services inefficiently and
cares for the wishes of only a
fraction of its membership. It is
this principle on which the
movement to abolish compulsory
ASSU membership is based.
Student government at Stanford is
presently a playground for
aspiring politicians, but not a
viable means of responding to
student needs. This is because of
its bureaucratic nature and its
inescapable ties with the
administration which severely
limit its effectiveness in dealing
with Stanford students.
The argument most often used
against voluntary ASSU
membership is: What would
happen to all the worthwhile
organizations like BSU and
MECHA? They would have no
money to operate. The answer is
simple: Worthwhile organizations
would continue to exist as
independent entities. It is absurd
to suggest that BSU or MECHA
would disappear merely because
ASSU was made voluntary. Those
students who wish to belong to
such an organization eould use the
money which tiiev forrierly

payed in ASSU fees, and
contribute this money to the
organization of their choice.
Sunday Flicks
In addition, independent
organizations can be allowed
franchise rights to such
profit-making establishments as
the Sunday Flicks. Those
organizations which have become
irrelevant to student desires will
be abolished; those that have real
value will become more effective
than at present, because they will
not be forced to handle their
affairs through the bureaucratic
hassle that is the ASSU.
The proposed constitutional
amendment would not abolish
ASSU. It would, rather, allow
individuals to decide for
themselves whether the ASSU is
relevant to them. As can easily be
determined by recent voting
totals, over 60 percent of the
students at Stanford care nothing
for the political circus that now
passes for a student government.
Surely, these SO percent should
not be forced to associate
themselves with an organization
which means nothing to them and
does nothing for them.
I'Yur of Change
A major factor in the

apposition to the amendment has
been fear of change. Many
students are unable to imagine a
Stanford without an ASSU.
Paradoxically, many
self-confessed radicals oppose the
amendment, although it is by far
the most radical proposition to
appear on an ASSU ballot in
years. Support for the amendment
need not be confined to the
Right, but should extend from all
students who agree with the
United Nations Charter that no
person should be forced to join
any organization.
It is only complacency, a
feeling of apathy towards student
government as it now stands, that
leads students into retaining the
ASSU. Are you satisfied with the
ASSU? Are you convinced that
any of the presidential candidates
is able to bring order out of the
chaos which is the current ASSU
bureaucracy? What does the
ASSU do that independent
organizations could not do as well
or better?
What would we do without
ASSU?
Anything we want!

such an organization eould use the
money which tiiev forrierly

payed in ASSU fees, and
contribute this money to the
organization of their choice.
Sunday Flicks
In addition, independent
organizations can be allowed
franchise rights to such
profit-making establishments as
the Sunday Flicks. Those
organizations which have become
irrelevant to student desires will
be abolished; those that have real
value will become more effective
than at present, because they will
not be forced to handle their
affairs through the bureaucratic
hassle that is the ASSU.
The proposed constitutional
amendment would not abolish
ASSU. It would, rather, allow
individuals to decide for
themselves whether the ASSU is
relevant to them. As can easily be
determined by recent voting
totals, over 60 percent of the
students at Stanford care nothing
for the political circus that now
passes for a student government.
Surely, these SO percent should
not be forced to associate
themselves with an organization
which means nothing to them and
does nothing for them.
I'Yur of Change
A major factor in the

apposition to the amendment has
been fear of change. Many
students are unable to imagine a
Stanford without an ASSU.
Paradoxically, many
self-confessed radicals oppose the
amendment, although it is by far
the most radical proposition to
appear on an ASSU ballot in
years. Support for the amendment
need not be confined to the
Right, but should extend from all
students who agree with the
United Nations Charter that no
person should be forced to join
any organization.
It is only complacency, a
feeling of apathy towards student
government as it now stands, that
leads students into retaining the
ASSU. Are you satisfied with the
ASSU? Are you convinced that
any of the presidential candidates
is able to bring order out of the
chaos which is the current ASSU
bureaucracy? What does the
ASSU do that independent
organizations could not do as well
or better?
What would we do without
ASSU?
Anything we want!
(Chris Hocker is a member of
Ihe A(I Hoe Committee for a
Voluntary ASSU.)
No individual should be
coerced into joining an
organization, especially one which
performs services inefficiently and
cares for the wishes of only a
fraction of its membership. It is
this principle on which the
movement to abolish compulsory
ASSU membership is based.
Student government at Stanford is
presently a playground for
aspiring politicians, but not a
viable means of responding to
student needs. This is because of
its bureaucratic nature and its
inescapable ties with the
administration which severely
limit its effectiveness in dealing
with Stanford students.
The argument most often used
against voluntary ASSU
membership is: What would
happen to all the worthwhile
organizations like BSU and
MECHA? They would have no
money to operate. The answer is
simple: Worthwhile organizations
would continue to exist as
independent entities. It is absurd
to suggest that BSU or MECHA
would disappear merely because
ASSU was made voluntary. Those
students who wish to belong to
such an organization eould use the
money which tiiev forrierly

payed in ASSU fees, and
contribute this money to the
organization of their choice.
