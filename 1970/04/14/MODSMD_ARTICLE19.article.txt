## In Defense Of Pat Shea 
### Larry Diamond 
It is ironic, in a way, that Mike
Sweeney, in his condemnation of
Pat Shea in this week's Wall Streel
Journal, should accuse the
Council of Presidents member of a
determination to "deceive and
mislead students." It is ironic not
only because it is untrue, but
because Sweeney's charges are a
classic example of deception and
distortion of the truth.
It is first charged that Shea told
trustees in a University Advisory
Committee Meeting last April that
radical students represented
"a m element that must be
excised from campus." Shea did
say there was a malignant growth
on campus, but he called it "a
creative force," and did not argue
that it be excised. What he argued
was that we must be on the watch
to make sure that this growth
does not exceed rational
boundaries and destroy the
university.

A second charge is that Shea
last year obtained a list of student
defendants from the Dean of
Students and telephoned each one
to urge compliance with the
administration's wishes. In fact,
the administration threatened to
automatically suspend the accused
students from school for one year
without any hearing unless they
complied with the request to
appear before the SJC. Pat was
given the list of students, and
allowed 3 days to have these
people appear before the SJC
before the automatic suspensions
would ensue
Still another accusation so false
as to be ludicrous, is that Shea
barred Paul Rupert from speaking
on the March anti-draft program
for the Moratorium. The program
committee for that event, of
which Shea and I were both
members chose Richard

Boardman to speak from the
Resistance. When he learned of
the choice, Paul Rupert let it be
known that the Resistance should
decide who would speak on the
program, and that that speaker
should be Paul Rupert. Pat Shea
did not have any blackballing
power over the program. We
decided as a group that we wanted
Richard Boardman to speak from
the Resistance, and he did.
The most blatantly false charge
is that Shea urged the Academic
Senate to immediately approve
the Army ROTC contract. In the
words of Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch, a Senate member,
"He's always been opposed to
ROTC." In the January 22 Senate
meeting, discussion lasted late
into the afternoon and there was a
proposal to delay a vote on ROTC
until a later meeting. What Pat
argued was that the Senate make a
decision at that meeting, so that

some elements on campus could
not accuse the faculty of inaction.
Prof. Philip Dawson, another
Senate member, confirmed this.
"He never urged (hat the Army
contract be approved, then, or at
any other time I've heard."
Sweeney charges lastly that
Shea will continue to work with
President Pitzer to preserve
ROTC. This is ridiculous. By
working staunchly to defeat
ROTC at the polls this week, Shea
has made a significant
contribution to abolishing ROTC
at Stanford.
In my close association with
Pat Shea in planning the anti-draft
rally and the non-violent
anti-ROTC campaign I have found
him at least as dedicated as
Michael Sweeney, and
considerably more trustworthy.
