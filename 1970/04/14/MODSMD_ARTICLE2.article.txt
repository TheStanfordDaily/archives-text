# 'Hair' Here Tomorrow
## April Moratorium 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
The sun will be greeted
tomorrow morning in Frost
Ampitheater by the full San
Francisco cast of "Hair" as the
April version of the Moratorium
gets under way with a "Festival of
Life."
A large crowd is expected to be
on hand weather permitting, for
the 6 a.m. event which will be
followed by a program of speakers
and a noon march through
downtown San Mateo.
The march, sponsored by the
San Mateo Peace Center and the
Peninsula Moratorium, will
protest the use of taxes to finance

the war. Participants will be
encouraged to prepare written
statements of protest to be
dropped off as the march detours
past the Internal Revenue Service
on the way to a rally in Central
Park.
Busses will be provided to
transport demonstrators from the
program at Frost to the march's
assembling point at Hillsdale
Shopping Center and to return
them to the Stanford campus
following the march at 2 p.m.
"The emphasis of the April
Moratorium is on the social and
economic cost of the war and to
demonstrate the link-up of the

war with pressing problems in this
country," stated John Kramer,
campus Moratorium co-ordinator.
Total Involvement Asked
"We hope to involve people
from all walks of life, from all age
groups, making it hard for the
Administration to pass it off as
the protest of a fringe group of
people," he said.
Rear Adm. (ret) Arnold True
will be the featured speaker at the
rally along with Professor Martin
Carnoy and Henry David Thoreau
(as played by a professional
actor.)
Musical entertainment will be
provided by "Ice", "The Loading
Zone," "Jamahl," and "Mad
Dog."
6:15 'Hair' Production
"Our conception of politics fits
well with what we're trying to
do," said Kramer. "Political
action should be fun and part of
an integrated life style."
The entire cast of the popular
musical "Hair" volunteered to
stage a free, shortened version of
the play at sunrise on Moratorium
morning, billed as the "Dawning
of Peace."
"There will be organizing in the
dorms to get people up and out
for the production," said Kramer.
"Hair"goes on just as the sun
comes up, about 6:15, and plays
for an hour."
Rep. George Brown, from
Southern California, who has
consistently voted against
appropriations for the war effort,
will headline the roster of
speakers for the morning program.
The U.S. Senate candidate will
speak on "Reordering National
Priorities for Peace and Life."

The sun will be greeted
tomorrow morning in Frost
Ampitheater by the full San
Francisco cast of "Hair" as the
April version of the Moratorium
gets under way with a "Festival of
Life."
A large crowd is expected to be
on hand weather permitting, for
the 6 a.m. event which will be
followed by a program of speakers
and a noon march through
downtown San Mateo.
The march, sponsored by the
San Mateo Peace Center and the
Peninsula Moratorium, will
protest the use of taxes to finance

the war. Participants will be
encouraged to prepare written
statements of protest to be
dropped off as the march detours
past the Internal Revenue Service
on the way to a rally in Central
Park.
Busses will be provided to
transport demonstrators from the
program at Frost to the march's
assembling point at Hillsdale
Shopping Center and to return
them to the Stanford campus
following the march at 2 p.m.
"The emphasis of the April
Moratorium is on the social and
economic cost of the war and to
demonstrate the link-up of the

war with pressing problems in this
country," stated John Kramer,
campus Moratorium co-ordinator.
Total Involvement Asked
"We hope to involve people
from all walks of life, from all age
groups, making it hard for the
Administration to pass it off as
the protest of a fringe group of
people," he said.
Rear Adm. (ret) Arnold True
will be the featured speaker at the
rally along with Professor Martin
Carnoy and Henry David Thoreau
(as played by a professional
actor.)
Musical entertainment will be
provided by "Ice", "The Loading
Zone," "Jamahl," and "Mad
Dog."
6:15 'Hair' Production
"Our conception of politics fits
well with what we're trying to
do," said Kramer. "Political
action should be fun and part of
an integrated life style."
The entire cast of the popular
musical "Hair" volunteered to
stage a free, shortened version of
the play at sunrise on Moratorium
morning, billed as the "Dawning
of Peace."
"There will be organizing in the
dorms to get people up and out
for the production," said Kramer.
"Hair"goes on just as the sun
comes up, about 6:15, and plays
for an hour."
Rep. George Brown, from
Southern California, who has
consistently voted against
appropriations for the war effort,
will headline the roster of
speakers for the morning program.
The U.S. Senate candidate will
speak on "Reordering National
Priorities for Peace and Life."
