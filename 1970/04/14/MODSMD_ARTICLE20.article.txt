# Radicals Nabbed
## Exposeâ€™ In Pitzer's Office 
### Tom Given 
It's a bit unsettling to see your
friends in a line-up.
The line-up is in President
Pitzer's office, where in the
interests of truth, beauty,
democracy, or whatever, one sifts
through numerous photographs
taken during the ROTC
demonstrations of the past two
weeks.
Getting there is half the fun.
There are two guards in front of
the room with the photographs -
Stanford police complete with
uniform and gun. They take your
name, rank and serial number -
identification is required. Then
you wait, for there are only two
sets of prints (the financial crisis
rears its ugly head once more) and
only two or three identifiers can
go through them at a time.
There's a nice map of the world
in an adjacent room, some decent
chairs, and an old issue of the
Chronicle to keep you busy.
Then, the guard calls your name,
and his colleague opens the door.
Inside, you are greeted by yet
another peace officer, as well as
an efficient little lady from the
Manpower People (most of
Pitzer's staff must be busy with
other matters). She hands out an
efficient form, complete with
carbon, and space for name,
phone number, person identified,
picture and number, and
"remarks".
Then you get the envelope.
There are three of them, marked
naturally as A, B, and C. Flipping
through the pictures, one may
identify persons circled and
numbered.
The pictures are pretty good,
indeed some of them might win
photography awards were they
entered in another kind of

contest. Others aren't so hot, but
then demonstrations can be a
drag.
Identifying the bodies is but
the first step in assembling
detailed dossiers - a sort of Who's
Who courtesy of the SIA
(Stanford Intelligence Agency). In
line with the president's call for
all true Stanford men and women
to be counted, the SAI has
released the files on a number of
subversives caught last week by

Bay Aroa. Trained, 1962,

Hearst, George Murphy, and S.I.

cou n ter-intelligence purposes.

jacket with "Keep Cool with

7. Kenneth S. Pitzer - erstwhile
president, Stanford University.
Chemist. Contributor to SEICUS -
believer in sex education. Closely
aligned with Communist front
organizations such as W.C.T.U.,
A.S.P.C.A., and the Mothers and
Sons for Elm Trees on the
Peninsula. Visited Moscow, 1949,
a member of chemical
information delegation to the
Supreme Soviet. Known to be
dangerous.
It's a bit unsettling to see your
friends in a line-up.
The line-up is in President
Pitzer's office, where in the
interests of truth, beauty,
democracy, or whatever, one sifts
through numerous photographs
taken during the ROTC
demonstrations of the past two
weeks.
Getting there is half the fun.
There are two guards in front of
the room with the photographs -
Stanford police complete with
uniform and gun. They take your
name, rank and serial number -
identification is required. Then
you wait, for there are only two
sets of prints (the financial crisis
rears its ugly head once more) and
only two or three identifiers can
go through them at a time.
There's a nice map of the world
in an adjacent room, some decent
chairs, and an old issue of the
Chronicle to keep you busy.
Then, the guard calls your name,
and his colleague opens the door.
Inside, you are greeted by yet
another peace officer, as well as
an efficient little lady from the
Manpower People (most of
Pitzer's staff must be busy with
other matters). She hands out an
efficient form, complete with
carbon, and space for name,
phone number, person identified,
picture and number, and
"remarks".
Then you get the envelope.
There are three of them, marked
naturally as A, B, and C. Flipping
through the pictures, one may
identify persons circled and
numbered.
The pictures are pretty good,
indeed some of them might win
photography awards were they
entered in another kind of

contest. Others aren't so hot, but
then demonstrations can be a
drag.
Identifying the bodies is but
the first step in assembling
detailed dossiers - a sort of Who's
Who courtesy of the SIA
(Stanford Intelligence Agency). In
line with the president's call for
all true Stanford men and women
to be counted, the SAI has
released the files on a number of
subversives caught last week by

It's a bit unsettling to see your
friends in a line-up.
The line-up is in President
Pitzer's office, where in the
interests of truth, beauty,
democracy, or whatever, one sifts
through numerous photographs
taken during the ROTC
demonstrations of the past two
weeks.
Getting there is half the fun.
There are two guards in front of
the room with the photographs -
Stanford police complete with
uniform and gun. They take your
name, rank and serial number -
identification is required. Then
you wait, for there are only two
sets of prints (the financial crisis
rears its ugly head once more) and
only two or three identifiers can
go through them at a time.
There's a nice map of the world
in an adjacent room, some decent
chairs, and an old issue of the
Chronicle to keep you busy.
Then, the guard calls your name,
and his colleague opens the door.
Inside, you are greeted by yet
another peace officer, as well as
an efficient little lady from the
Manpower People (most of
Pitzer's staff must be busy with
other matters). She hands out an
efficient form, complete with
carbon, and space for name,
phone number, person identified,
picture and number, and
"remarks".
Then you get the envelope.
There are three of them, marked
naturally as A, B, and C. Flipping
through the pictures, one may
identify persons circled and
numbered.
The pictures are pretty good,
indeed some of them might win
photography awards were they
entered in another kind of

contest. Others aren't so hot, but
then demonstrations can be a
drag.
Identifying the bodies is but
the first step in assembling
detailed dossiers - a sort of Who's
Who courtesy of the SIA
(Stanford Intelligence Agency). In
line with the president's call for
all true Stanford men and women
to be counted, the SAI has
released the files on a number of
subversives caught last week by
the camera.

the Red. Sometime editor of that
so-called pinko journal. The
Stanford Daily. Former organizer
