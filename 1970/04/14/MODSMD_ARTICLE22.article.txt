# ROTC Debate
## Questions And Answers 
### 
QUESTION: We recognize that the War in
Vietnam and U.S. imperialism are wrong. But
ROTC is just one small part of the system that is
killing people in Asia and dominating the
economies of Third World countries. Why bother
to attack ROTC at Stanford?
ANSWER: Members of the anti-ROTC
movement differ on many important political
questions. But must of them agree that the system
which dominates the United States, based on
advanced capitalism and expressed in imperialism
is fundamentally corrupt. They see the Southeast
Asian War, the racism of American society, the
recent series of nationwide strikes, the destruction
of the environment and the cultural alienation of
many young Americans as related to the structural
crisis of this system.
If the system is expansionist, militaristic, racist
and insatiably greedy in its very nature, the
question is how to destroy it so that a new system
can be constructed
Everybody recognized that the system is
powerful and violent. Such a system can only be
taken apart one piece at a time, and each weakness
in it must be used to advantage.
The most basic weakness in the system is that it
does not work to benefit the great majority of the
people. Most people work hard to keep the system
going, but are rewarded with only a small fraction
of i,he value of what they produce.
Material Rewards
The material rewards available to Stanford
students are much greater than those allocated to
most other people. Their social background and
the fact that they have been trained at an elite
university will open many dojrs to wealth and
power. But even so, many members of this
community have that the system does
not operate in their real interests, much less in the
interests of most people.
For many young men, it is intolerable that they
are asked to kill and perhaps die in Southeast Asia
to protect the economic interests of very rich
individuals and corporations.

Many women have come to see that the system
offers them only a subtle second class citizenship,
economic exploitation, and alienation from their
own sexual identity and human potential.
Riches Of Oppressors
For many people, it has become clear that life
on the side of the oppressors is not worth all the
riches that the oppressors have to offer.
An attack on ROTC is just a first small step in
the direction of destroying this system. But it is an
important step for several reasons.
Reserve Officer Training programs are of
significant importance to the Army. Forty to fifty
per cent of their newly commissioned officers each
year come out of these programs. It would be
difficult to find other ways to recruit and train
officers. It would be more difficult still to attract
young men with elite backgrounds into the Army
if ROTC did not exist on the campuses of elite
universities.
ROTC Trend
The fate of the ROTC program at Stanford is
particularly important because it may help set a
trend. ROTC was eliminated or denied credit at
many schools last year, including most of the Ivy
League and upper class institutions. This year the
Defense Department is trying to re-establish itself
at many of these same schools, and Stanford is one
of the primary targets.
But perhaps more important than ROTC itself
are the lessons that can be learned through fighting
it. It is relatively easy to maintain liberal illusions
about the system until we try to change it in just
one small way. The violence that the system uses
to protect itself at Stanford teaches us something
about the violence that imperialism is using to
extend itself in Asia. The struggle over a relatively
small issue at Stanford leads us to ask questions
about the system as a whole.
ROTC is just one part of a big, powerful system.
But ROTC is right here, right now. If we are going
to take this system apart, there is no better place
to start than right here, and no better time than
now.
