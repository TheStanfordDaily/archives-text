Contempt of Court
Editor, THE DAILY:
The use of contempt of court
charges in political cases, like the
ROTC issue here, has been a
controversial judicial practice. In

1969, in the case of Frank vs U.S.,
the Supreme Court upheld such a
conviction. But Chief Justice Earl
Warren and Justice William O.
Douglas wrote a dissenting
opinion that contained this grim
warning:
Today's decision stands as an
open suggestion to the courts to
utilize oppressive practices for
avoiding, in unsettled times such
as these, issues that must be
squarely faced and for denying
our minorities their full rights
under the First Amendment.
Without having to wait for a
jury conviction, the trial judge
would be free to impose, at will,
such a lengthy probation sentence
with onerous probation
conditions—the effect of which
could be oppressive. A trial judge
need not wait until laws are
violated and prosecutions are
actually brought. He can simply
issue a blanket injunction against
an unpopular group, cite its
members for contempt en masse
for the slightest injunction
violation, deny them a jury, and
then, by imposing strict
conditions, effectively depiive
them of any meaningful freedom
of an indefinite period of up to
five years.
Despite our recent efforts to
curb its use, the injunction power
has today become, when used
with thii, newly liberated
contempt power, too awesome a
weapon to place in the hands of
one man.
' Speech and Drama
Editor, The Daily :
The recent decision to phase
out the Speech and Drama
program as a legitimate part of the
Stanford corriculum is a tragic
occuranee. In any budget squeeze
the low priority items are cut
first, but Stanford's priorities are
visibly distorted. Of course the
market value of having had Acting
1 is less than some engineering
course, but is the experience less
rewarding?
Stanford's priorities are a
reflection of the market's
profitability; ROTC, Aero-Astro,
and the Business school all
produce highly marketable
commodities and bring back grant
funds. 1 challenge, though,
whether Stanford should be
producing commodities, or rather
providing a full educational
experience for its students. It is

evident that when Stanford cuts
educational experience for its
students. It is evident that when
Stanford cuts funds the
Hummanities find the blow
costlier than the hard sciences.
Undergraduates have been
deprived of opportunities (this
time Speech and Drama, but
English and Philosophy may join
the crippled in the future) to
enrich themselves as human
beings. Oh, but I forgot human
beings are worth very little on the
market.

ASS (J Ammendment
Editor, The Daily:
The significance of the
upcoming amendment to
reconstitute the ASSU as a
voluntary organization should not
be lost on the abject absurdity of
this particular unnecessary,
compulsory institution:
unnecessary, compulsory
institutions are absurd by mere
definition. Rather, the Liberty
Amendment should be seen
primarily as a strike at the
co llectivist, authoritarian
hypocrisy which runs rampant on
the campus, and which makes
such nefarious institutions
possible.
That the main issue is
hypocrisy is evinced by the
expectedly negligible attempts to
justify the ASSU. The proponents
of the student power structure are
attempting to ignore the Liberty
Amendment not because it is
inconsequential —it has an
excellent chance of
succeeding—but because they
want to evade the principles
involved—principles of human
freedom. This evasion is an
intellectual copout by
self-proclaimed intellectuals; a
hypocrisy of the first order.
The unmasking of the ASSU by
The Arena might be necessary to
kill the monster on pragmatic,
range-of-the-moment grounds. But
the particular absurdities of the
ASSU should not obscure the
principles which engender these
principles. The Liberty
Amendment is a first attempt to
discredit the collectivist-author
itarian hypocrisy, and the chance
to make it successful should not
be lost at the next polls. It is a
first attempt, but it will not be
the last.
