# ROTC Violence
## Students Against Tactics 
### JOHN SCHWARTZ 
As campus activists are aware,
militant tactics have the twin
effects of dividing a community
and hardening existing views on
both sides. At a time when the
Stanford off-ROTC movement
hovers between employing
peaceful and violent methods, the
key question is where the cleavage
will fall in the aftermath of the
action it chooses.
The Daily tried to assess the
campus mood on this subject by
distributing questionnaires that
requested anticipated reactions to
the four alternatives most
seriously considered by the
off-ROTC movement: attempting
to eliminate the program
"through the system," breaking
windows or damaging other
university property, more militant
action such as burning a building,
and finally a building occupation.
Those polled were asked to
predict their reactions according
to a four-point scale ranging from
highly favorable and favorable on
one hand to unfavorable and
highly unfavorable on the other.
The option of "no opinion" was
also included. Finally, for
corrolational purposes, each
respondent was asked whether he
was for or against granting credit
for ROTC.
A table of responses in percent
is printed on this page.
Opposition to Violence
The result weighed heavily
against violent tactics. Ninety-two
percent of those questioned said
that they would react at least
unfavorably to a continuation of
the kind of action thus far
taken—rock throwing and minor
property damage—and 58 percent
predicted that they would react
highly unfavorably.
Regarding more militant
action like burning a building, the
response was even stronger. Such
tactics would be approved by only
four percent of the sample, while
12 percent would be unfavorable
and 85 percent highly
unfavorable.
The results were only slightly
less strong among those opposed
to offering ROTC for credit, the
potential supporters of the
off-ROTC movement. Eighty-six
percent said they would be
unfavorable or highly unfavorable
toward rock throwing or similar
tactics, while regarding actions
such as burning a building, 75
percent said they would
disapprove highly and another 18

percent said they would
disapprove.
The most popular of the four
choices was "working through the
system." It would be considered
highly, favorable by thirty-lour
percent of those questioned,
favorable by 34 percent,
unfavorable by 8 percent and
highly unfavorable by 10 percent.
This figure was much higher
among those against ROTC for
credit, with 46.5 percent highly
favorable, 43 percent favorable,
and only 7 percent opposed.
Reaction was most mixed on
the alternative of occupying a
building, mentioned as a possible
action this week. Overall, ten
percent said they would react
highly favorably, 22 percent
favorably, 32 percent
unfavorably, and 24 percent
highly unfavorably.
Among those opposing credit
for ROTC, however, the issue was
almost evenly split, with a slight
edge for those in favor. Fifteen
percent of this group said they
would be highly favorable, 32
percent favorable, 32 percent
unfavorable, and 10.5 percent
highly unfavorable.
Among those either presently
for ROTC credit or offering no
opinion—the group the off-ROTC
movement wishes to convert—4
percent said they would highly
approve of a building occupation
and 9 percent approving. Nearly
three-quarters said they would at
least disapprove.
Message to Militants
If these results are to be
applied to the entire campus, the
message for the off-ROTC
movement clearly seems to be
off-violence. Over nine-tenths of
the students stand to be alienated
by such tactics, including a very
large majority of those opposed to
ROTC credit, and thus the
movement's potential supporters.
The cases for a building
occupation or "working through
the system" are less clear.
Occupying a building would offer
publicity and possible attraction
of support through direct
confrontation. On the other hand,
the movement would run the risk
of alienating the over 40 percent
of its possible supporters who
stated they would react
unfavorably, while according to
the Daily survey, they stand to
attract only a small portion of
those currently neutral or in favor
of ROTC credit.

Finally, the alternative of
"working through the system,"
would please most students and a
large majority of those who
oppose ROTC for credit. Yet such
action lacks the visceral excitement
of militant tactics, and the more
radical of the movement would be
likely to reject it as bankrupt.
(This poll was taken of 50
students in four of the Eating
Clubs, including graduates and
undergrads, men and women.
Though not a statistically valid
representation of the whole
community, its conclusions do
reflect the general mood—Ed.)

action this week. Overall, ten
percent said they would react
highly favorably, 22 percent
favorably, 32 percent
unfavorably, and 24 percent
highly unfavorably.
Among those opposing credit
for ROTC, however, the issue was
almost evenly split, with a slight
edge for those in favor. Fifteen
percent of this group said they
would be highly favorable, 32
percent favorable, 32 percent
unfavorable, and 10.5 percent
highly unfavorable.
Among those either presently
for ROTC credit or offering no
opinion—the group the off-ROTC
movement wishes to convert—4
percent said they would highly
approve of a building occupation
and 9 percent approving. Nearly
three-quarters said they would at
least disapprove.
Message to Militants
If these results are to be
applied to the entire campus, the
message for the off-ROTC
movement clearly seems to be
off-violence. Over nine-tenths of
the students stand to be alienated
by such tactics, including a very
large majority of those opposed to
ROTC credit, and thus the
movement's potential supporters.
The cases for a building
occupation or "working through
the system" are less clear.
Occupying a building would offer
publicity and possible attraction
of support through direct
confrontation. On the other hand,
the movement would run the risk
of alienating the over 40 percent
of its possible supporters who
stated they would react
unfavorably, while according to
the Daily survey, they stand to
attract only a small portion of
those currently neutral or in favor
of ROTC credit.

Finally, the alternative of
"working through the system,"
would please most students and a
large majority of those who
oppose ROTC for credit. Yet such
action lacks the visceral excitement
of militant tactics, and the more
radical of the movement would be
likely to reject it as bankrupt.
(This poll was taken of 50
students in four of the Eating
Clubs, including graduates and
undergrads, men and women.
Though not a statistically valid
representation of the whole
community, its conclusions do

CAMPUS DISRUPTIONS have resulted in police on campus. A DAILY poll
reveals most students are against such violence.
As campus activists are aware,
militant tactics have the twin
effects of dividing a community
and hardening existing views on
both sides. At a time when the
Stanford off-ROTC movement
hovers between employing
peaceful and violent methods, the
key question is where the cleavage
will fall in the aftermath of the
action it chooses.
The Daily tried to assess the
campus mood on this subject by
distributing questionnaires that
requested anticipated reactions to
the four alternatives most
seriously considered by the
off-ROTC movement: attempting
to eliminate the program
"through the system," breaking
windows or damaging other
university property, more militant
action such as burning a building,
and finally a building occupation.
Those polled were asked to
predict their reactions according
to a four-point scale ranging from
highly favorable and favorable on
one hand to unfavorable and
highly unfavorable on the other.
The option of "no opinion" was
also included. Finally, for
corrolational purposes, each
respondent was asked whether he
was for or against granting credit
for ROTC.
A table of responses in percent
is printed on this page.
Opposition to Violence
The result weighed heavily
against violent tactics. Ninety-two
percent of those questioned said
that they would react at least
unfavorably to a continuation of
the kind of action thus far
taken—rock throwing and minor
property damage—and 58 percent
predicted that they would react
highly unfavorably.
Regarding more militant
action like burning a building, the
response was even stronger. Such
tactics would be approved by only
four percent of the sample, while
12 percent would be unfavorable
and 85 percent highly
unfavorable.
The results were only slightly
less strong among those opposed
to offering ROTC for credit, the
potential supporters of the
off-ROTC movement. Eighty-six
percent said they would be
unfavorable or highly unfavorable
toward rock throwing or similar
tactics, while regarding actions
such as burning a building, 75
percent said they would
disapprove highly and another 18

percent said they would
disapprove.
The most popular of the four
choices was "working through the
system." It would be considered
highly, favorable by thirty-lour
percent of those questioned,
favorable by 34 percent,
unfavorable by 8 percent and
highly unfavorable by 10 percent.
This figure was much higher
among those against ROTC for
credit, with 46.5 percent highly
favorable, 43 percent favorable,
and only 7 percent opposed.
Reaction was most mixed on
the alternative of occupying a
building, mentioned as a possible
action this week. Overall, ten
percent said they would react
highly favorably, 22 percent
favorably, 32 percent
unfavorably, and 24 percent
highly unfavorably.

campus mood on this subject by
distributing questionnaires that
requested anticipated reactions to
the four alternatives most
seriously considered by the
off-ROTC movement: attempting
to eliminate the program
"through the system," breaking
windows or damaging other
university property, more militant
action such as burning a building,
and finally a building occupation.
Those polled were asked to
predict their reactions according
to a four-point scale ranging from
highly favorable and favorable on
one hand to unfavorable and
highly unfavorable on the other.
The option of "no opinion" was
also included. Finally, for
corrolational purposes, each
respondent was asked whether he
was for or against granting credit
for ROTC.
A table of responses in percent
is printed on this page.
Opposition to Violence
The result weighed heavily
against violent tactics. Ninety-two
percent of those questioned said
that they would react at least
unfavorably to a continuation of
the kind of action thus far
taken—rock throwing and minor
property damage—and 58 percent
predicted that they would react
highly unfavorably.
Regarding more militant
action like burning a building, the
response was even stronger. Such
tactics would be approved by only
four percent of the sample, while
12 percent would be unfavorable
and 85 percent highly
unfavorable.
The results were only slightly
less strong among those opposed
to offering ROTC for credit, the
potential supporters of the
off-ROTC movement. Eighty-six
percent said they would be
unfavorable or highly unfavorable
toward rock throwing or similar
tactics, while regarding actions
such as burning a building, 75
percent said they would
disapprove highly and another 18

percent said they would
disapprove.
The most popular of the four
choices was "working through the
system." It would be considered
highly, favorable by thirty-lour
percent of those questioned,
favorable by 34 percent,
unfavorable by 8 percent and
highly unfavorable by 10 percent.
This figure was much higher
among those against ROTC for
credit, with 46.5 percent highly
favorable, 43 percent favorable,
and only 7 percent opposed.
Reaction was most mixed on
the alternative of occupying a
building, mentioned as a possible
action this week. Overall, ten
percent said they would react
highly favorably, 22 percent
favorably, 32 percent
unfavorably, and 24 percent
highly unfavorably.
Among those opposing credit
for ROTC, however, the issue was
almost evenly split, with a slight
edge for those in favor. Fifteen
percent of this group said they
would be highly favorable, 32
percent favorable, 32 percent
unfavorable, and 10.5 percent
highly unfavorable.
Among those either presently
for ROTC credit or offering no
opinion—the group the off-ROTC
movement wishes to convert—4
percent said they would highly
approve of a building occupation
and 9 percent approving. Nearly
three-quarters said they would at
least disapprove.
Message to Militants
If these results are to be
applied to the entire campus, the
message for the off-ROTC
movement clearly seems to be
off-violence. Over nine-tenths of
the students stand to be alienated
by such tactics, including a very
large majority of those opposed to
ROTC credit, and thus the
movement's potential supporters.
The cases for a building
occupation or "working through
the system" are less clear.
Occupying a building would offer
publicity and possible attraction
of support through direct
confrontation. On the other hand,
the movement would run the risk
of alienating the over 40 percent
of its possible supporters who
stated they would react
unfavorably, while according to
the Daily survey, they stand to
attract only a small portion of
those currently neutral or in favor
of ROTC credit.

Finally, the alternative of
"working through the system,"
would please most students and a
large majority of those who
oppose ROTC for credit. Yet such
action lacks the visceral excitement
of militant tactics, and the more
radical of the movement would be
likely to reject it as bankrupt.

CAMPUS DISRUPTIONS have resulted in police on campus. A DAILY poll
reveals most students are against such violence.
