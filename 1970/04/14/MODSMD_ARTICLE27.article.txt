# USC Students Vote Special Assessment
## 
### 
Students at the University of
I Southern California voted Friday
to assess themseJves $8 a year for
the next ten years to raise
scholarship funds for needy
students.
The University will match the
student-raised funds on a 2-1
basis. The projected net of the
project if $480,000 for the first
year. The new assessment will
take effect in the fall.
The assessment was a victory
for USC's Black Student Union,
which first proposed the fee and
then won student government
approval to place the matter on
the ballot.
Ron McDuffie, a Black student
running for student body
president in the same election,
faces a run-off contest later this
week. If he is elected, he will
become the first Black student
body president in USC's history.
A committee will
hearings soon to decide how
students want to distribute the
money. While the proposal was
sponsored by the BSU, the monies

will go to all needy students, with
no special provisions for
individual minority groups.
University President Norman
Topping said that Friday's vote
makes USC "the first university
in the nation where the student
body itself has given such
meaningful recognition to the
needs of disadvantaged students."
The vote on the measure was
1,572 to 1,406. USC has an
enrollment of 20,000 students.
