# Candidates-Right And Left
## Shoch-Evers 
### JOHN SLOAN 
"We are running on our
principles, not on our
bureaucratic qualifications," say
John Shoch and Bill Evers who
together form the slate most to
the left in the ASSU presidential
elections.
Shoch, who is the presidential
candidate and Evers, the vice
presidential candidate, although
they would prefer to have it as
co-presidents, stress that they are
not running on their
administrative qualifications. In
line with this view they have been
publishing a series of in-depth
position papers called 'Speak
Truth To Power' instead of
waging what is considered a
normal election. As Shoch said,
following up the statement on
their lack of interest in the
bureaucratic side of the election,
"it is for that reason that we are
putting out a series of analytical
position papers rather than
superficial campaign literature."
Haw Experience
However, regardless of
whether they stress it or not, both
do have experience in campus
organizations as well as being
widely known for their political
positions. Shoch is presently
chairman of the student senate.
He was also in LASSU for two
years and is on the editorial board
of the Chaparral. Evers too was in
LASSU, off and on for three years
and he has also worked at limes
with the Dail >.
Obviously the Shoch-Evers
slate is not running a traditional
election. Instead they are trying
to widen the social consciousness
of the university community and
perhaps bring back memories of
the David Harris days.
"We think that the university
should confront the social issues

of our times" and with regards to
ROTC, "we favor the elimination
of ROTC by all means necessary
and sufficient to the task." Their
campaign is based on Lhe belief
that you cannot sacrifice your
personal integrity for political
expediency, or as Evers said, "you
have to be an honest human being
and respond to injustice whenever
it enters into your experiences."
One of their slogans is 'A Free
University and a Free Society.'
Their position papers outline
several proposals to move towards
this end, such as a tuition
deferment plan to bring in wanted
outsidy professors, and the freeing
of scientific research at Stanford
from government control. n ut
basically their campaign is
"designed to challenge both the
concept of what ASSU is and
should be and what the university
is and should be."
It remains to be seen whether
they will have the chance to
implement any of their proposals
and ideas to create a 'new'
university. Bureaucracy is not
their strong point, social
consciousness is. This is the way
they want it to be. And as one of
them said, "there are no student
issues, but only those of the
university and the society in
which we live."
