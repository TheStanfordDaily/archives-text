# Rubin To Speak At ROTC Meeting
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees and
Jerry Rubin will be performing
live on campus today, with an
enthusiastic chorus provided by
the Stanford Off-ROTC
Movement.
The ' Movement begins its
surveillance of the Trustees at
10:30 a.m. at the Business School,
where a rally will be held during
the Board meeting. Hopefully, the
Trustees will reply favorably to an
invitation issued earlier by the
Movement to speak to the
Stanford Community on the
ROTC question at an open-mike
meeting.
Whether the Trustees are
present or not, a meeting will be
held at 4 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium, with another guest of
honor, Jerry Rubin of the Chicago
7 conspiracy. The Movement is
urging that "Join the Conspiracy"
T-shirts be worn to this gathering.
Between the morning and

afternoon meetings, the Trustees
will be lunching at the Faculty
Club. Even this short respite may
not be entirely unmarred, for at
noon, a hunger vigil is scheduled
to begin in front of President
Pitzer's office in the Inner Quad.
The source of another possible
lunch time disturbance is to be
found in historical reflection. At
the Trustees' Faculty Club lunch
last January, a group of 19
radicals broke into the lunchroom
and disrupted their meeting, not
only by their noisy presence, but
by also taking a number of
important papers with them when
they left including the agenda for
the meeting.
