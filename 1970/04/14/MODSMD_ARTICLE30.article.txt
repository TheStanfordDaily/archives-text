"The central issue is whether
or not ASSU will continue to
exist," says Harvey lltikari who,
with t.rnosto Roberto Rael, is
running for the ASSU presidency.
This slate differs from all the rest
in that if it is elected ASSU will
he, for the most part, dissolved.
Hukari is a graduate student in
communications as well as
chairman of the Free Campus
Movement and editor of the
Arena. He is presently on the
Student Conduct Legislative

Council and was formerly a
member of the Student Education
Council. Rael is a freshman in
math.
Hukari is widely known on
campus for his political stance and
in this election stands to the right
of all the other candidates. He is
basing this election almost solely
on the belief that ASSU should
cease to exist as a compulsorary
organization.
End ASSU
"If elected we will essentially
abolish ASSU. It will continue to
exist as a minimal structure to
conduct elections to insure
student representation on
university committees. Nobody
would have to pay anything into
ASSU," said Hukari. In keeping
with this idea Hukari is urging his
followers to vote for the 'liberty'
amendment which would in effect
put ASSU out of existence.
To finance the necessary
elections they would franchise the
ASSU Sunday Flicks to the
highest bidder to cover election
costs. In the past Hukari, through
the ARENA, has published an
expose of the ASSU finances.
"We believe that ASSU is
irrelevant, impotent and that real
student power exists in voluntary
groups, be they left, right, social
or ethnic. Everything ASSU does
now could be carried on by
voluntary organizations . . . and
there are a lot of things that
ASSU does now that they
shouldn't be doing." Here he cited
the ASSU compulsary banking
system. "We are unique in that
neither of us are part of the ASSU
establishment," Hukari continued.

Discussing the recent
disruptive events on campus
Hukari stated that the emergency
powers and decisions of President
Pitzer had "come down on
everybody. It is regrettable that
this had to happen." Hukari and

Rael are the only candidates for
office that to date have come out
in favor of retaining ROTC on
campus with appropriate credit as
decided by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
Hukari and Rael are hoping
that the majority of the campus
will agree with them when they
feel that the ASSU is a needless
bureaucracy. As Hukari summed
up his argument, "we are the only
ones offering a radical alternative.
We are the only people not acting
in the role of revisionists but as
abolitionists."
