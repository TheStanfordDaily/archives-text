Late tomorrow night eight Stanford sailors will
leave (by plane) for Annapolis, Md., and the Sixth
Annual Kennedy Cup Regatta on Chesapeake Bay.
The regatta, hosted by the U.S. Naval Academy
in conjunction with the Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association of North America, brings
together eleven sailing teams from around the
nation. Stanford has participated every year since
1966 and won in 1967 and '68. The skipper who
engineered the latter triumph, Tom McCarthy, will
be at the helm again this weekend.
The five races will be held Saturday and
Sunday in identical fiberglass Luders 44 foot yawls
owned by the Academy. Along with Stanford,
teams from Cornell, Brown, Harvard, Princeton,
the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the Naval
Academy, Michigan, Notre Dame, Tulane and USC
will be entered. The two west coast teams
represent the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Sailing
Association.
Stanford's team, pictured on this page, has
been practicing for the regatta for several weeks on
San Francisco Bay aboard a sloop-rigged Luders
44 owned by Dr. Francis Sooy of the San
Francisco Yacht Club These photographs of the
crew were taken on a recent afternoon of tacking
and spinnaker practice in a freshening breeze of
15-20 knots. The crew members:
—Tom McCarthy, a senior from Kentfield,
helmsman.
—John London, a senior from San Diego,
