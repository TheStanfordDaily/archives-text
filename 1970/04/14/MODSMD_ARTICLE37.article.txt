Congress should halt further
expansion of the Safeguard ABM
system lest it escalate the nuclear
arms race, Stanford's Wolfgang
Panofsky told the Senate Foreign
Relations Disarmament
Subcommittee Monday.
Prof. Panofsky, a former
nuclear test ban treaty negotiator
and director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center,
asserted that the ABM expansion
requested by President Nixon will
jeopardize success of the
forthcoming U.S.-Soviet strategic
arms limitation (SALT) talks
which he said offer the best hope
of ending the arms race.
"There can no longer be any
question that ABM has escalated
and will continue to escalate the
nuclear arms race," he said.
"Suspected deployment of
ABM by the Soviets has given the
incentive for U.S. development of
the MIRV; deployment of
multiple warheads by the Soviets
has given last year's justification
for the U.S. deployment decision
on Safeguard; the possible
expanding role of Safeguard in
protecting our cities will give rise
to Soviet fears of being able to
maintain their deterrent against
us; the possibility of improving
the accuracy of American MIRV's
with which we are trying to
counter Soviet ABM's appears to
threaten Soviet missile silos; and
so on.
"In short, starting from
concern about ABM deployment,
the world is embarking on the
next large step of the arms race.
Yet the world has now strategic
nuclear armament sufficient to
destroy life as we know it on both
the European and North
American continents, and in fact
to endanger survival of the entire
human race.
Presenting technical evidence to
prove his points, the Stanford
physicist said that Safequard does
very little to protect the
Minuteman force it is designed to
defend, or to shield us from
nuclear missiles which China
might launch.
"Fortunately the President has
emphasized, in particular in his
more recent statements, that he
considers ABM levels fully
negotiable in the forthcoming
SALT talks. I hope he can justify
to the American people giving
away in negotiation with the
