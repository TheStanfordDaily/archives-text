# Cornell Officials Ask Fire Watch
## 
### 
Cornell University's
administration organized a fire
watch yesterday, asking students
and faculty members to volunteer
for patrols guarding the campus
against firebombings.
The call for petrels was made
after two smaP fires were set in
university buildings Sunday night.
In addition, two Molotov
cocktails that failed to ignite were
also discovered.
Both fires, one in the 'ibrary
and the other in the student
union, were extinguished before
significant damage could be done.
Half a dozen windows were also
broken during the early morning

excitement on the Ithica, N.Y.
campus.
An 11 p.m. curfew was
established last week, but it was
ignored and later dropped by the
university administration.
A university spokesman called
for more than 200 volunteers to
guard Cornell's f>oo buildings
"throughout the night." Those
volunteering were instructed to
report all suspicious activities to
the campus police department.
The campus is normally
patrolled by armed campus
policemen, who recently have
been working 12-hour shifts with
no days off in the wake of
continued student unrest.
