# Panel Discusses Value Of Lenin
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
A Hoover Institute historian
argued heatedly with a Stanford
communist last night over
whether V.I. Lenin is the
prototype totalitarian dictator, in
the style of Hitler and Mussolini,
or the liberator of the proletariet
from their capitalist exploiters.
Occasion of the debate was a
Tresidder panel discussion on
Lenin before an audience of

nearly 200. Before the meeting
broke up, opinions were expressed
by Hoover Institute historian
Bertram Wolfe; Marxist-Leninist
history graduate student Ivo
Banac; a Soviet Union Communist
Party member who is visiting this
country; Harvey Hukari, FCM
leader and candidate for ASSU
president; Lincoln Malik, a
prominent Stanford radical and
staunch Marxist-Leninist from
Iraq; John Kramer, student leader
of Stanford's Vietnam
Moratorium; and others.
First to speak was Wolfe. "The
world," he said, "is a poorer,
bleaker, more dangerous place
because Lenin lived."
Lenin's tactics, he asserted,
have established the definition of
dictatorship, since adopted by
Hitler and Mussolini—totally
unlimited power, restricted
neither by tradition,
constitutional law, ethics, or
religion.
Cannon Fodder
Banac answered several
minutes later. "Lies, villainy and
calumny" have been hurled at
Lenin every day by men like
Wolfe, he said. "Recall the misery
of the working classes (before the
Bolshevik revolution)—used as
cannon fodder by the ruling
classes in the imperialist war of
1914."
A workers' dictatorship, said
Banec, was necessary for a Marxist
victory. The violence of the
bourgeosie had to be smashed by
violence.
Imperialism and capitalism are
doomed, he said. "The working
classes are not being bought off."
"The dead Lenin," he
concluded, "is more alive than all
the forces of reaction."
Proletariet Victims
After intervening speeches,
Wolfe had a chance to answer.
The Russian people, he said,
would be better off economically
had the Bolshevik revolution
never occurred. But, he added,
even had the resolution hrought
economic benefits, it would not
be worth the cost in human
suffering and brutality.
What I write, he said, his voice
quivering slightly, is the truth.
The Russian dictatorship is not a
dictatorship of the proletariet; the
