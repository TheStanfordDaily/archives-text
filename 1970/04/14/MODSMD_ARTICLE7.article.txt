## 
###

A locked and guarded joint
meeting of the Board of Trustees'
Finance and Academic Affairs
committees yesterday decided to
establish an ad hoc Trustee
committee to consider the
proposals.
The three-man committee will
make a recommendation for
Board action at the Trustees' May
meeting.
One person who attended
yesterday's meeting said, however,
that Trustee reaction was "very
cold and negative" to the
proposals.
In addition to their GM action,
Board members also discussed the
recent ROTC demonstrations.
They are reported to have
asked University administrators
why some of the students
involved in the protests could not
be summarily expelled or
dismissed. They also wanted to
know what could be done about
the faculty members involved.

presented to the Board by
President Kenneth Pitzer. Backers
of Nader's Project for Corporate
Responsibility have asked for the

shares of GM stock in the
company's May 22 stockholders
meeting.
If adopted, Nader's proposals
would add three consumer
advocates to the GM Board of
Directors and it would sane lon an
external study of the
corporation's business practices.
