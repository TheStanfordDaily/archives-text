# Mass Meeting Probes ROTC, Recent Violence
## 
### 
Five hundred students gathered
in Memorial Church last night
following a silent march from
White Plaza to protest and to
discuss the recent violence on
campus.
Offering a contrast to the
revolutionary rhetoric of the past
two weeks, four speakers probed
the nature of the rock-throwings
on campus as well as the
institutionalized violent nature of
the ROTC program.
Gordon Wright, professor of
history; Sanford Dornbusch,
professor of sociology,; Paul
Rupert, a former ROTC cadet and
now a leader in the Resistance;
and Dwight Clark, director of the
Volunteers in Asia program,

addressed the Convocation, which
was chaired by Rev. Wayne Rood,
acting dean of the chapel.
Agree on ROTC
The meeting, initially called to
protest violence, saw general
agreement on the elimination of
ROTC. As Rupert noted, "A
person who is committed to
nonviolence is clearly committed
to removing ROTC from the
Stanford campus."
In a slightly different vein,
Clark called for the embracement
of nonviolence as a "personal
ethic" and not a "difference in
tactics." Calling for an
investigation of violent
institutions within the University,
he suggested "disciplined,
non-violent action of several
kinds, including a fast, until the
University acts, and perhaps a
sit-in."
His reference to a sit-in echoes
a proposal made at last Thursday's
Off-ROTC meeting. The group
reserved such action until the
Trustees and President Pitzer
refuse to attend an open forum or
ignore the results of the
referendum on ROTC.
Sit-in Called
A leaflet distributed in a
seminar following the speeches
also called for a sit-in: "You can
help transform the movement and
bring peace to the Stanford
campus by joining a nonviolent
sit-in at the ROTC building."
Agreement on a sit-in was not
general. Dr. Dornbush declared
that "the helpless peasants of
Vietnam are not gaining from the
concentration of Stanford
home-made missiles on ROTC,
but Governor Reagan is. Violence
only brings down repression."
An opponent of ROTC and a
leader in the Vietnam
Moratorium, Dornbush added that
it was "unlikely" that a recent
one-year extension of Army
ROTC will be overthrown by the
faculty this year, but predicted

that student vote against ROTC in
the referendum "will prove
decisive in the inevitable next
faculty referendum" a year from
now.
Pitzer's Performance
Expanding on the notion of the
non-violent ethic, Clark scored
President Pitzer's handling on the
recent demonstrations. He noted
that in Pitzer's position the
accepted standards would include:
"Not rushing to emergency
regulations without following
their spirit and letter; no haste to
court action carrying possible
two-year sentences for the
non-violent activity of a mill-in;
and no hassling of the law
students who have served a useful
community role as legal
observers."
Turning then to the radical
approach to the ROTC issue, he
emphasized that "By employing
violence, whether limited or not,
whether against property or
against people, we validate the
employment of violence we
supposedly oppose."
Wail On Windows
Rupert's position was not as
clear-cut. He noted that "People
wail against broken windows, but
fail to struggle against ROTC;
they wail against the actions of
protestors, but call for the police
and the courts. They are passive
and not in the Gandhian
tradition."
Continuing, he declared that,
"Gandhi would have marched
tonight, but would have protested
tomorrow against the
institutionalized violence of
ROTC."
His reference was to a
demonstration scheduled for
10:30 this morning at the
Graduate School of Business,
where the entire Board of
Trustees will meet.
