# Drill Protests Fail
## 
### LAURIE MORN 
The heat in the anti-ROTC
movement fizzled yesterday, as
high winds and low temperatures
kept potential demonstrators
indoors. Early in the afternoon,
only 10 demonstrators showed up
at Maples Pavilion to hold a
guerilla theater encounter with
Navy ROTC cadets. The cadets
had decided to play hide and seek,
though, and had switched their
drill activities to the football
stadium.
The same group of guerilla
theatricians who pursued the
Navy ROTC drill team wound up
stealing (he Stanford ROTC drill
trophy from the Navy classrooms
behind Encina Hall. The
protesters claimed that they had
won the trophy by default, since
the Navy drill team hadn't shown
up. According to radical
spokesman Michael Sweeney, if
the NROTC team wants the
trophy back, it had better come
prepared to drill tomorrow
afternoon on stage at the
anti-ROTC meeting in Memorial
Auditorium at 4 p.m.
The scheduled noon rally
yesterday turned into a non-rally.
Speakers in White Plaza
announced that Jerry Rubin of
the Chicago 7 would appear

today, and that there would be a
teach-in on "Southeast Asia,
Imperialism, and Stanford
Trustees" later in the afternoon.
At the teach-in, about 75
people slumped quietly in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium seats as
former Stanford student J'm
Shoch detailed "the nature of
U.S. imperialism: Profit before
lives and people."
Shoch chargcd that U.S.
intervention in S.E. Asia is based
on the need to protect interests in
raw materials, and to maintain the
economic strength of Japan. He
linked the names of Stanford
trustees with specific companies
involved in Asia now.
"The trustees are in the midst
of the oil rush," said Shoch "The
trustees are in the forefront of
imperialism in S.E. Asia."
Stanford graduate Bink
Garnett then connected U.S.
involvement in Vietnam with
involvement in Laos and
Cambodia. He stated that the U.S.
war in Laos is "pure . . . clean . . .
cheap ... a C.I .A. triumph,"
costing 1 percent of Vietnam.
"The only thing the Laotian
government ever takes seriously is
the opium trade . . . Ask about
opium and you're dead."
