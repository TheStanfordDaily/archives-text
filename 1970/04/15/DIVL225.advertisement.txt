Today
Certainly a date oj great
irony. Yesterday Jerry
Rubin, the original Yippie
and convicted crosser of state
lines. spoke here. Fifty years
ago today Sacco and
Vanzetti were accused of
killing two men in a payroll
robbery in Brain tree, Mass.
"The court system is nothing
but a railroad, a super high
speed railroad," Rubin said
yesterday. Rubin is still
around to tell us. Sacco and
Vanzetti aren't.
