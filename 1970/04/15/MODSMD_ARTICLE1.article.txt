# Fees, Officer Election Slated
## 
### SUSAN MAAS 
ASSU elections today and
tomorrow will cover the issues of
ROTC, ASSU membership, fee
assessments, and will elect an
ASSU president, senior class
officers, and SCLC members.
Running for ASSU president
and vice president are Harvey
Hukari Jr., and Ernesto Rael;
Charles Kitsman and John Pratt;
John Schoch and Bill Evers; and
the presidential councils of Bob
Mattson, Loudin Beam, and Bob
Cory; and of Patrick C. Shea,
Robert Grant, Adam Levin, and
Hal Mickelson.
Since only two names of any
ticket can appear on the ballot,
the Mattson, Beam, Cory ticket
will not contain Cory's name,
although he is still part of the
ticket. Likewise, the ticket listed
as Shea-Grant will actually include
Levin and Mickelson.
Senior class officers may be
voted on by students with more
than 130 units. They will choose
between the council of Roman
Buhler, B.S. Jordan, 111, C. W.
Combs, and Kevin Porter; the
council of John Ford, John Elger,
David Velasquez, and Teresa
Cady; and the slate of Taylor
Crosby, pres., Margaret Earl, vice
pres., and Phillip Feldman,
business manager.
SCLC Candidates
Three students will be elected
to the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) from
among the following: James L.
Barber, Paul J. Busse, Cynthia
Cherbak, Steven L. Guerra, Chris
Hocker, Harnes-Clichy Peterson,
Jr., Robert Spiro, John A.
Washburn, and Raymond R.
White.
SCLC is the group which

recently proposed a new "Penalty
Code" for students, and voted to
ban the "knowing possession or
use" of deadly weapons on
campus.
A constitutional amendment
proposed by Harvey Hukari, a
leader of the Free Campus
Movement, would make
membership in ASSU voluntary
and limited to those paying an
annual membership fee. A
two-thirds majority is necessary
for its passage.
The purpose of the "liberty"
amendment, according to Hukari,
is to put the ASSU out of
existence.
ROTC Vole
A special referendum on the
status of ROTC will also be on the
ballot. Students will have a chance
to voice their opinions on whether
ROTC should continue at
Stanford, and, if so, whether it
should be granted credit.
Three proposals for fee
assessment will be on the ballot
each requiring a simple majority
to pass.
First is the ASSU fee, on which
students may vote for one of
several suggested fees, or for none
at all. This fee will cover the
various programs and functioning
of the ASSU.
Another request for money
comes in the ASSU Entertainment
Proposition, asking one dollar per
quarter from each student, in
order to organize a varied program
of entertainment for students.
This money, administered by
the Special Events Board, would
go toward such projects as drama,
concerts, films, and lectures.
Daily Request
The final fund request is for the
Daily, which is also asking for one
dollar per quarter per student.
This money will keep the Daily
operating at its present rate.
Formerly, the Daily received an
automatic 85 cents per student
each quarter, but a change in
ASSU by-laws makes a special
request necessary.
Results of the election will be
announced in Friday's Daily.
Runoff elections are scheduled for
April 22 and 23 to determine the
winner in presidential elections
and the fee assessments.
The winners of the SCLC race
will not be known, however, until
after the overseas campus ballots
are received in several weeks.
The issue of Stanford's General
Motors stock will appear among
the referendums on the run-off
ballot.
