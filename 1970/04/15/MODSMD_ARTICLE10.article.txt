# Fund Students
## 
### 
Stanford students regularly elect their officers and
occasionally express their will on specific policy issues.
Rarely have they been given the opportunity to set their
taxes. But today and tomorrow, the student body can do
just that - determining how much to give ASSU program
coffers and whether to fund Special Events Board and the
Daily.
The basic choice is simple: are students willing to support
student run programs adequately? In a time of financial
crisis, it is naive to expect the University to pick up the bill
for inadequately funded activities. It is also rather
unrealistic to expect many programs to survive if only a few
students belong to ASSU and pay fees. Sufficient amounts
of money are available only when all students pay a small
amount.
We feel there are sound reasons for maintaining at least
this year's level of ASSU program funding and for
supporting Special Events Board and the Daily.
ASSU program activities represent opportunities to
broaden one's world beyond academia, and benefit all
students who venture out of the scholarly cocoon. The
smorgasbord provided to choose from this year is impressive
- Axe Comm, the Black Student Union, MECHA, Political
Union, Pre-Registration planning, the Sequoia literary
magazine, KZSU, the Company drama group, and more.
Student Financial Manager David Swift has untangled the
knot of figures surrounding the choice of a quarterly ASSU
program assessment. His conclusion: a level of $3.00 per
quarter per student is required to collect program fees equal
to those spent this year. We find the diversity of activities
well worth the price.
A $1 per quarter special assessment for Special Events
Board is also a good investment. With these funds, the
Board plans to offer rock, folk and symphonic concerts by
well known groups each quarter. Students would be
admitted at a discount. Smaller activities, like drama
productions, could also get capital from the Board.
The special $1 per quarter assessment for the Daily may
be understood as a simple question: does Stanford need a
daily newspaper? We feel a community of more than 15,000
people must have frequent, regular communication. It needs
to know a wealth of news, to read a broad spectrum of
opinions, to be entertained by feature stories and spirts,
and to learn what groups are meeting and what activities are
planned every day. As detailed in a column in yesterday's
Daily, without the special assessment the Daily cannot
provide these services.
Vote yes on the Daily special assessment; vote yes for
Special Events funding; vote at least $3.00 for the ASSU
program fee.
