# White Plaza Fast
## 
### 
The cycle of violence must be stopped. We believe that the only
means to that end is for each person to realize that fact and rearrange
his or her life accordingly. This commitment must come from within
and must be a lasting one.
By fasting we are attempting to show our commitment to both
non-violence and action. Our immediate goal is the elimination of
ROTC from this campus. Today and tomorrow we shall continue to
fast in White Plaza.
We urge everyone to vote NO in the referendum and to come talk
to us.
The issue is not tactics. Ths issue is ROTC.
