Naval Science Courses
Editor, The Daily:
As a result of conversations
with Stanford students I have
come to believe that many
members of this University
misunderstand the issue of credit
for Naval Science courses at
Stanford.
There are at present ten courses
offered at Stanford taught by
officers of the Naval service.
These courses have worthwhile
academic content and would be of
interest to students who may not
wish to enter the Naval service but
do desire to have an
understanding of military affairs
and techniques.
Last Fall sixteen students who
were not in NROTC enrolled in
one Navigation course. Thirteen
of these students continued the
Navigation series in the Winter
quarter.
No requirement exists nor has a
request been made tc the
University for blanket approval of
Naval Science instruction for
credit. What has been asked is that
each course be reviewed by
whatever means and standards this
University wishes to establish, and
be judged for credit entirely on its
merit.
One purpose of thp
Undergraduate Special Course
offerings and the credit review
process of such courses by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies is to bring non-faculty
expertise into the teaching role in
areas of academic interest to some
Stanford students. Courses taught
by officers of the Naval service
appear to me to be consistent
with that purpose.
It would indeed be unfortunate
if students - such as Mr. Kifk
Hanson - who actually subscribe
to a petition and review process
for courses taught by military
officers were to preclude such
procedures by voting
unconditionally to abolish credit
for ROTC courses.

Phony Issue
Editor, The Daily:
I have just completed the Army
ROTC program at Stanford, and
feel qualified to give the lie to this
anonymous "cadet" whose hostile
remarks about ROTC "from the
inside" have been so widely
circulated in the last few days.
(Daily column April 8, letter April
13.)
It's not surprising that some
have questioned whether the
anonymous fellow is truly a cadet,
for his ignorance about the
organization of the Army and the
operation of the ROTC program is
remarkable. This purported cadet
doesn't even know what the
branches of the Army are, much
less understand the differences
among them with respect to
combat service. Since accurate
information on the Army branch
system can easily be obtained by
one disposed to learn what he's
talking about, I would like to
simply respond to Anonymous's
major charge that the "punitive
clause" and the branch assignment
system are employed to
"blackmail" cadets into political
conformity.
In four years of Army ROTC
enrollment I have never witnessed
or heard of a single incident that
could • even remotely be
interpreted as an attempt on the
part of the ROTC administrators
to manipulate political opinions
or political behavior of cadets.
Furthermore, I cannot recall ever
hearing a discussion of personal
political viewpoints as such in a
ROTC class - a necessity for the
blackmailing, according to
Anonymous.
Anonymous asserts that the
DMS award serves to ensure "that
every cadet who wants his first
branch choice must adopt the
'correct' political viewpoints" and
not associate with any "incorrect"
political organizations. This
description of the DMS and
branch assignment operation is
utterly false. In this year's
graduating class, 23% of the
cadets were DMS designees. Hut
fil% of all the cadets received
their first choice branch, 14%

their second choice, 2% their third
choice, and 23% some other
branch. Of ten DMS winners, one
did not receive any of his three
choices.
The whole branch assignment
thing is a phony issue anyway
because all cadets realize that they
have committed themselves to
serve in any branch the Army
decides to put them in. There is
no right to a first-choice branch
assignment, and every cadet is
prepared to accept commissioning
in any branch.
The infamous "punitive
clause," prescribed by legislation
in 1964, has never been invoked
by Stanford Army ROTC to
obtain induction of a contract
defaulter. Far from serving as a
device for blackmail, the
"punitive clause" in cadet
contracts has virtually been
ignored by cadets and cadre alike.
I personally feel, however, that
any Stanford junior who hasn't
got the maturity to maintain a
good faith agreement doesn't have
any business executing a contract
in the first place.

Editorial Protest
Editor, The Daily:
DAILY is the news organ of the
Stanford community. It is the
only publication which can claim
that position. Those two facts,
more than anything else, must
determine the editorial policy of
the DAILY.
On Wednesday, the DAILY
endorsed the Shoch—Evers ticket
for the ASSU presidency. I
strongly object to this action, and
not on political grounds. I feel in
endorsing any ticket the editorial
staff of the DAILY betrayed its
responsibility to the community.
The editorial staff, perhaps
justifiably, may feel it is more
aware of campus political
conditions th'in the average
Stanford student. Its duty should
therefore be to strive to make the
DAILY readership equally
knowledgeable.However, once the
student body has been informed
of the facts, it is presumptuous of
the DAILY editorial staff to

assume that they can best
interpret them.
Finally, the editorial was
poorly written. The reasons given
for not endorsing two of the
tickets (Mattson-Cory-Beam and
Kitsman-Pratt) were not backed
up by facts. The editorial sounded
like a empty statement of
opinion.
If the members of the DAILY
editorial staff felt duty bound to
endorse a ticket, they should have
signed the editorial as individuals.
Ralph Kostanl
DAI LY news staff
The Daily feels a great
obligation to present the news
fairly, and to include on its
editorial pages columns from all
points of view on campus. The
energy of the staff is directed
toward these goals, which are
unfortunately not always
attained, Today's editorial page,
however, attests to the openness
of our forum.
Because reporters concentrate
on being consistent, informed
observers of the news, most of us
at the Daily feel the staff, too, has
a right and an obligation to offer
its opinions in the editorial
column. We do not presume to
represent the entire student body,
but merely to present another
opinion for its consideration.
Daily editorial stands are taken
by a vote of the nine member
managing board, or by vote of the
staff at an editorial meeting. Such
a meeting was called for last
Sunday to discuss the week's
editorials, including an
endorsement for ASSU president.
Mr. Kostant was welcome to
attend. However, only managing
board members showed up.
Seven of the nine supported the
Shoch-Evers ticket, and other
staff members who later read the
editorial concurred. Staff
members who support other
candidates, or no one, were
offered space for a dissenting
editorial. They declined. Ed.
Daily's Neglcct
Fiditor, The Dail v:
The Daily editorial yesterday
morning endorsed one ticket for

their "bold initiative" advancing
various, unnamed, proposals. Such
is the Daily's prerogative.
However, some facts should be
pointed out to the Stanford
community, facts which the Daily
has neglected to present to the
students. The endorsement was
made without the customary
Daily editorial board interview of
all major candidates. Perhaps this
was because the Daily
decisionmakers had already
decided who they liked
Another fact the Daily chose to
ingore is that the vice-presidential
candidate on the endorsed ticket
favors the abolition of student
government at Stanford. Is this
ticket indeed "the best chance for
making ASSU government the
diligent student advocate that it
should be?" Since abolition of
student government is
tantamount to doing away with
student fees, presumably the
Daily also has reversed itself on
the matter of student funding of
the Daily.
The Daily also deplores the
student Senate's "gloomy scene of
egotistical rivalry" while
neglecting to note that its
candidate for student body
president has been serving as
vice-chairman of the senate until
last month when he was elevated
to the position of chairman. Is he
both part of the problem and part
of the solution?
Finally, let me note the
deterioration of the Daily's
renowned objectivity over the last
two issues. In Monday a page one
story refers to "a supposedly
impartial analysis" by President
Pitzer. Tuesday editorializing
again triumphed with "Hopefully,
the Trustees will respond
favorably.. ."
Tom Dawson
Former Managing Kriitor
The Daily's endorsement was
made after careful consideration
of the platforms, qualifications
and h adcrship styles of each slate,
in a manner explained in the
editor's note above. IVc admit to
and regret the editorial comments
which slipped past editors into
two page-one stories. Editor

more than anything else, must

On Wednesday, the DAILY
endorsed the Shoch—Evers ticket
for the ASSU presidency. I
strongly object to this action, and
not on political grounds. I feel in
endorsing any ticket the editorial
staff of the DAILY betrayed its
responsibility to the community.
The editorial staff, perhaps
justifiably, may feel it is more
aware of campus political
conditions th'in the average
Stanford student. Its duty should
therefore be to strive to make the
DAILY readership equally
knowledgeable.However, once the
student body has been informed
of the facts, it is presumptuous of
the DAILY editorial staff to

assume that they can best
interpret them.
Finally, the editorial was
poorly written. The reasons given
for not endorsing two of the
tickets (Mattson-Cory-Beam and
Kitsman-Pratt) were not backed
up by facts. The editorial sounded
like a empty statement of
opinion.
If the members of the DAILY
editorial staff felt duty bound to
endorse a ticket, they should have
signed the editorial as individuals.

The Daily feels a great

points of view on campus. The

unfortunately not always
attained, Today's editorial page,
however, attests to the openness

Because reporters concentrate

at the Daily feel the staff, too, has
a right and an obligation to offer
its opinions in the editorial
column. We do not presume to
represent the entire student body,
but merely to present another
opinion for its consideration.
Daily editorial stands are taken
by a vote of the nine member
managing board, or by vote of the

a meeting was called for last
Sunday to discuss the week's
editorials, including an
endorsement for ASSU president.
Mr. Kostant was welcome to
attend. However, only managing
board members showed up.
Seven of the nine supported the

staff members who later read the

members who support other
candidates, or no one, were
offered space for a dissenting

The Daily editorial yesterday

their "bold initiative" advancing
various, unnamed, proposals. Such
is the Daily's prerogative.
However, some facts should be
pointed out to the Stanford
community, facts which the Daily
has neglected to present to the
students. The endorsement was
made without the customary
Daily editorial board interview of
all major candidates. Perhaps this
was because the Daily
decisionmakers had already
decided who they liked
Another fact the Daily chose to
ingore is that the vice-presidential
candidate on the endorsed ticket
favors the abolition of student
government at Stanford. Is this
ticket indeed "the best chance for
making ASSU government the
diligent student advocate that it

student government is
tantamount to doing away with

president has been serving as
vice-chairman of the senate until
last month when he was elevated

both part of the problem and part

Naval Science Courses
Editor, The Daily:
As a result of conversations
with Stanford students I have
come to believe that many
members of this University
misunderstand the issue of credit
for Naval Science courses at
Stanford.
There are at present ten courses
offered at Stanford taught by
officers of the Naval service.
These courses have worthwhile
academic content and would be of
interest to students who may not
wish to enter the Naval service but
do desire to have an
understanding of military affairs
and techniques.
Last Fall sixteen students who
were not in NROTC enrolled in
one Navigation course. Thirteen
of these students continued the
Navigation series in the Winter
quarter.
No requirement exists nor has a
request been made tc the
University for blanket approval of
Naval Science instruction for
credit. What has been asked is that
each course be reviewed by
whatever means and standards this
University wishes to establish, and
be judged for credit entirely on its
merit.
One purpose of thp
Undergraduate Special Course
offerings and the credit review
process of such courses by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies is to bring non-faculty
expertise into the teaching role in
areas of academic interest to some
Stanford students. Courses taught
by officers of the Naval service
appear to me to be consistent
with that purpose.
It would indeed be unfortunate
if students - such as Mr. Kifk
Hanson - who actually subscribe
to a petition and review process
for courses taught by military
officers were to preclude such
procedures by voting
unconditionally to abolish credit
for ROTC courses.

Phony Issue
Editor, The Daily:
I have just completed the Army
ROTC program at Stanford, and
feel qualified to give the lie to this
anonymous "cadet" whose hostile
remarks about ROTC "from the
inside" have been so widely
circulated in the last few days.
(Daily column April 8, letter April
13.)
It's not surprising that some
have questioned whether the
anonymous fellow is truly a cadet,
for his ignorance about the
organization of the Army and the
operation of the ROTC program is
remarkable. This purported cadet
doesn't even know what the
branches of the Army are, much
less understand the differences
among them with respect to
combat service. Since accurate
information on the Army branch
system can easily be obtained by
one disposed to learn what he's
talking about, I would like to
simply respond to Anonymous's
major charge that the "punitive
clause" and the branch assignment
system are employed to
"blackmail" cadets into political
conformity.
In four years of Army ROTC
enrollment I have never witnessed
or heard of a single incident that
could • even remotely be
interpreted as an attempt on the
part of the ROTC administrators
to manipulate political opinions
or political behavior of cadets.
Furthermore, I cannot recall ever
hearing a discussion of personal
political viewpoints as such in a
ROTC class - a necessity for the
blackmailing, according to
Anonymous.
Anonymous asserts that the
DMS award serves to ensure "that
every cadet who wants his first
branch choice must adopt the
'correct' political viewpoints" and
not associate with any "incorrect"
political organizations. This
description of the DMS and
branch assignment operation is
utterly false. In this year's
graduating class, 23% of the
cadets were DMS designees. Hut
fil% of all the cadets received
their first choice branch, 14%

their second choice, 2% their third
choice, and 23% some other
branch. Of ten DMS winners, one
did not receive any of his three
choices.
The whole branch assignment
thing is a phony issue anyway
because all cadets realize that they
have committed themselves to
serve in any branch the Army
decides to put them in. There is
no right to a first-choice branch
assignment, and every cadet is
prepared to accept commissioning
in any branch.
The infamous "punitive
clause," prescribed by legislation
in 1964, has never been invoked
by Stanford Army ROTC to
obtain induction of a contract
defaulter. Far from serving as a
device for blackmail, the
"punitive clause" in cadet
contracts has virtually been
ignored by cadets and cadre alike.
I personally feel, however, that
any Stanford junior who hasn't
got the maturity to maintain a
good faith agreement doesn't have
any business executing a contract
in the first place.

Phony Issue
Editor, The Daily:
I have just completed the Army
ROTC program at Stanford, and
feel qualified to give the lie to this
anonymous "cadet" whose hostile
remarks about ROTC "from the
inside" have been so widely
circulated in the last few days.
(Daily column April 8, letter April
13.)
It's not surprising that some
have questioned whether the
anonymous fellow is truly a cadet,
for his ignorance about the
organization of the Army and the
operation of the ROTC program is
remarkable. This purported cadet
doesn't even know what the
branches of the Army are, much
less understand the differences
among them with respect to
combat service. Since accurate
information on the Army branch
system can easily be obtained by
one disposed to learn what he's
talking about, I would like to
simply respond to Anonymous's
major charge that the "punitive
clause" and the branch assignment
system are employed to
"blackmail" cadets into political
conformity.
In four years of Army ROTC
enrollment I have never witnessed
or heard of a single incident that
could • even remotely be
interpreted as an attempt on the
part of the ROTC administrators
to manipulate political opinions
or political behavior of cadets.
Furthermore, I cannot recall ever
hearing a discussion of personal
political viewpoints as such in a
ROTC class - a necessity for the
blackmailing, according to
Anonymous.
Anonymous asserts that the
DMS award serves to ensure "that
every cadet who wants his first
branch choice must adopt the
'correct' political viewpoints" and
not associate with any "incorrect"
political organizations. This
description of the DMS and
branch assignment operation is
utterly false. In this year's
graduating class, 23% of the
cadets were DMS designees. Hut
fil% of all the cadets received
their first choice branch, 14%

their second choice, 2% their third
choice, and 23% some other
branch. Of ten DMS winners, one
did not receive any of his three
choices.
The whole branch assignment
thing is a phony issue anyway
because all cadets realize that they
have committed themselves to
serve in any branch the Army
decides to put them in. There is
no right to a first-choice branch
assignment, and every cadet is
prepared to accept commissioning
in any branch.
The infamous "punitive
clause," prescribed by legislation
in 1964, has never been invoked
by Stanford Army ROTC to
obtain induction of a contract
defaulter. Far from serving as a
device for blackmail, the
"punitive clause" in cadet
contracts has virtually been
ignored by cadets and cadre alike.
I personally feel, however, that
any Stanford junior who hasn't
got the maturity to maintain a
good faith agreement doesn't have
any business executing a contract
in the first place.

Editorial Protest
Editor, The Daily:
DAILY is the news organ of the
Stanford community. It is the
only publication which can claim
that position. Those two facts,
more than anything else, must
determine the editorial policy of
the DAILY.
On Wednesday, the DAILY
endorsed the Shoch—Evers ticket
for the ASSU presidency. I
strongly object to this action, and
not on political grounds. I feel in
endorsing any ticket the editorial
staff of the DAILY betrayed its
responsibility to the community.
The editorial staff, perhaps
justifiably, may feel it is more
aware of campus political
conditions th'in the average
Stanford student. Its duty should
therefore be to strive to make the
DAILY readership equally
knowledgeable.However, once the
student body has been informed
of the facts, it is presumptuous of
the DAILY editorial staff to

assume that they can best
interpret them.
Finally, the editorial was
poorly written. The reasons given
for not endorsing two of the
tickets (Mattson-Cory-Beam and
Kitsman-Pratt) were not backed
up by facts. The editorial sounded
like a empty statement of
opinion.
If the members of the DAILY
editorial staff felt duty bound to
endorse a ticket, they should have
signed the editorial as individuals.
Ralph Kostanl
DAI LY news staff
The Daily feels a great
obligation to present the news
fairly, and to include on its
editorial pages columns from all
points of view on campus. The
energy of the staff is directed
toward these goals, which are
unfortunately not always
attained, Today's editorial page,
however, attests to the openness
of our forum.
Because reporters concentrate
on being consistent, informed
observers of the news, most of us
at the Daily feel the staff, too, has
a right and an obligation to offer
its opinions in the editorial
column. We do not presume to
represent the entire student body,
but merely to present another
opinion for its consideration.
Daily editorial stands are taken
by a vote of the nine member
managing board, or by vote of the
staff at an editorial meeting. Such
a meeting was called for last
Sunday to discuss the week's
editorials, including an
endorsement for ASSU president.
Mr. Kostant was welcome to
attend. However, only managing
board members showed up.
Seven of the nine supported the
Shoch-Evers ticket, and other
staff members who later read the
editorial concurred. Staff
members who support other
candidates, or no one, were
offered space for a dissenting
editorial. They declined. Ed.
Daily's Neglcct
Fiditor, The Dail v:
The Daily editorial yesterday
morning endorsed one ticket for

their "bold initiative" advancing
various, unnamed, proposals. Such
is the Daily's prerogative.
However, some facts should be
pointed out to the Stanford
community, facts which the Daily
has neglected to present to the
students. The endorsement was
made without the customary
Daily editorial board interview of
all major candidates. Perhaps this
was because the Daily
decisionmakers had already
decided who they liked
Another fact the Daily chose to
ingore is that the vice-presidential
candidate on the endorsed ticket
favors the abolition of student
government at Stanford. Is this
ticket indeed "the best chance for
making ASSU government the
diligent student advocate that it
should be?" Since abolition of
student government is
tantamount to doing away with
student fees, presumably the
Daily also has reversed itself on
the matter of student funding of
the Daily.
The Daily also deplores the
student Senate's "gloomy scene of
egotistical rivalry" while
neglecting to note that its
candidate for student body
president has been serving as
vice-chairman of the senate until
last month when he was elevated
to the position of chairman. Is he
both part of the problem and part
of the solution?
Finally, let me note the
deterioration of the Daily's
renowned objectivity over the last
two issues. In Monday a page one
story refers to "a supposedly
impartial analysis" by President
Pitzer. Tuesday editorializing
again triumphed with "Hopefully,
the Trustees will respond
favorably.. ."

The Daily feels a great

editorial pages columns from all
points of view on campus. The
energy of the staff is directed
toward these goals, which are
unfortunately not always
attained, Today's editorial page,
however, attests to the openness
of our forum.
Because reporters concentrate
on being consistent, informed

at the Daily feel the staff, too, has
a right and an obligation to offer
its opinions in the editorial
column. We do not presume to
represent the entire student body,
but merely to present another
opinion for its consideration.
Daily editorial stands are taken
by a vote of the nine member
managing board, or by vote of the

a meeting was called for last
Sunday to discuss the week's
editorials, including an
endorsement for ASSU president.
Mr. Kostant was welcome to
attend. However, only managing
board members showed up.
Seven of the nine supported the
Shoch-Evers ticket, and other
staff members who later read the

members who support other

offered space for a dissenting

The Daily editorial yesterday

their "bold initiative" advancing
various, unnamed, proposals. Such
is the Daily's prerogative.
However, some facts should be
pointed out to the Stanford
community, facts which the Daily
has neglected to present to the
students. The endorsement was
made without the customary
Daily editorial board interview of
all major candidates. Perhaps this
was because the Daily

decided who they liked
Another fact the Daily chose to
ingore is that the vice-presidential
candidate on the endorsed ticket
favors the abolition of student
government at Stanford. Is this
ticket indeed "the best chance for
making ASSU government the

student government is
tantamount to doing away with

The Daily also deplores the

president has been serving as
vice-chairman of the senate until

both part of the problem and part

deterioration of the Daily's
renowned objectivity over the last

Naval Science Courses
Editor, The Daily:
As a result of conversations
with Stanford students I have
come to believe that many
members of this University
misunderstand the issue of credit
for Naval Science courses at
Stanford.
There are at present ten courses
offered at Stanford taught by
officers of the Naval service.
These courses have worthwhile
academic content and would be of
interest to students who may not
wish to enter the Naval service but
do desire to have an
understanding of military affairs
and techniques.
Last Fall sixteen students who
were not in NROTC enrolled in
one Navigation course. Thirteen
of these students continued the
Navigation series in the Winter
quarter.
No requirement exists nor has a
request been made tc the
University for blanket approval of
Naval Science instruction for
credit. What has been asked is that
each course be reviewed by
whatever means and standards this
University wishes to establish, and
be judged for credit entirely on its
merit.
One purpose of thp
Undergraduate Special Course
offerings and the credit review
process of such courses by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies is to bring non-faculty
expertise into the teaching role in
areas of academic interest to some
Stanford students. Courses taught
by officers of the Naval service
appear to me to be consistent
with that purpose.
It would indeed be unfortunate
if students - such as Mr. Kifk
Hanson - who actually subscribe
to a petition and review process
for courses taught by military
officers were to preclude such
procedures by voting
unconditionally to abolish credit
for ROTC courses.

Phony Issue
Editor, The Daily:
I have just completed the Army
ROTC program at Stanford, and
feel qualified to give the lie to this
anonymous "cadet" whose hostile
remarks about ROTC "from the
inside" have been so widely
circulated in the last few days.
(Daily column April 8, letter April
13.)
It's not surprising that some
have questioned whether the
anonymous fellow is truly a cadet,
for his ignorance about the
organization of the Army and the
operation of the ROTC program is
remarkable. This purported cadet
doesn't even know what the
branches of the Army are, much
less understand the differences
among them with respect to
combat service. Since accurate
information on the Army branch
system can easily be obtained by
one disposed to learn what he's
talking about, I would like to
simply respond to Anonymous's
major charge that the "punitive
clause" and the branch assignment
system are employed to
"blackmail" cadets into political
conformity.
In four years of Army ROTC
enrollment I have never witnessed
or heard of a single incident that
could • even remotely be
interpreted as an attempt on the
part of the ROTC administrators
to manipulate political opinions
or political behavior of cadets.
Furthermore, I cannot recall ever
hearing a discussion of personal
political viewpoints as such in a
ROTC class - a necessity for the
blackmailing, according to
Anonymous.
Anonymous asserts that the
DMS award serves to ensure "that
every cadet who wants his first
branch choice must adopt the
'correct' political viewpoints" and
not associate with any "incorrect"
political organizations. This
description of the DMS and
branch assignment operation is
utterly false. In this year's
graduating class, 23% of the
cadets were DMS designees. Hut
fil% of all the cadets received
their first choice branch, 14%

their second choice, 2% their third
choice, and 23% some other
branch. Of ten DMS winners, one
did not receive any of his three
choices.
The whole branch assignment
thing is a phony issue anyway
because all cadets realize that they
have committed themselves to
serve in any branch the Army
decides to put them in. There is
no right to a first-choice branch
assignment, and every cadet is
prepared to accept commissioning
in any branch.
The infamous "punitive
clause," prescribed by legislation
in 1964, has never been invoked
by Stanford Army ROTC to
obtain induction of a contract
defaulter. Far from serving as a
device for blackmail, the
"punitive clause" in cadet
contracts has virtually been
ignored by cadets and cadre alike.
I personally feel, however, that
any Stanford junior who hasn't
got the maturity to maintain a
good faith agreement doesn't have
any business executing a contract
in the first place.
