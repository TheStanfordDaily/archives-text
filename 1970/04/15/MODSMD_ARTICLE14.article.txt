### Richard W. Lyman 
Your editorial of Monday,
entitled "Dual Standard," cites
three reasons why the
administration erred in seeking
enforcement of the injunction
which it obtained last year,
against five persons who have
been involved in recent
disruptions of campus activities.
In explaining why we chose to
proceed as we did let me address
those three reasons.
First, the editorial states that
"the order to show cause seems,
at least to the non-legalist, to
presume prior guilt on the part. .
of those charged. This is false.
There is no presumption of prior
guilt in this proceeding. Therefore
the supposed conflict with "the
American legal system" which
you claim to perceive is wholly
imaginary. This would suggest
that you might do well in future
editorials which comment on the
law to seek the advice of a trained
"legalist" of your own choosing.
If you are concerned, as you say
you are, with the risk of these
people wrapping themselves in the
cloak of martyrdom, why
contribute to that risk by
publishing so ill-based a
commentary on the law being
applied?

Second, you charge that the
University "picked on some of the
wrong people." Leaving aside the
pejorative expression, "picked
on," the fact is that we are trying
to protect the court order which
was obtained last year, and to
protect the University and all its
residents from violations of that
order. Those named to appear
before the court were those who,
on the facts and law, appear to us
to have violated the injunction
terms. No other criteria have been
or will be used
The only way we could be
legitimately accused of
prosecuting "wrong people"
would be if we were to prosecute
people who did not violate the
order. You are apparently asking
that the law be a respecter of
persons because of offices they
hold, something quite contrary to
any equitable standards of justice.
One obtains no immunity to
break the law merely be becoming
"a well known student leader."
Chuck the System
Third, the editorial charges that
the administration is "once again
chucking the legislative and
judicial system." When was the
last time? I think the record

illustrates, as does your front-page
headline of Monday, that the
administration is intent on making
the judicial system work. But this
does not mean that the University
is foreclosed from recourse to the
civil and criminal courts in
appropriate cases. No case seems
more appropriate than this one,
and indeed in our view the
University is compelled to resort
to the courts when an order which
it obtained from those courts is
violated.
There is no "dual standard"
involved in these cases. But there
are, as everybody in the
University community should be
aware, two sets of laws which
operate on this campus. The first
are the rules which have been
enacted by the University
community for the protection of
our standards and interests as a
University. The second is the law
of the State of California and
certain federal laws. The violation
of a court order is a violation of
state law, and when the University
was a party to obtaining that
court order it ought not to sit idly
by and see it disobeyed.
Workable Internal System?
I recognize and share the
dedication of this community to a

workable internal judicial system.
And, for that reason we are
referring those students (as that
term has been interpreted by the
Stanford Judicial Council) who
have been cited to the court for
contempt of the injunction to the
Judicial Council also, with note of
the fact that contempt
proceedings have been instituted
against them. This will give the
Judicial Council an opportunity
to determine whether sanctions,
for violation of the University's
policies, are also appropriate in
these circumstances.
