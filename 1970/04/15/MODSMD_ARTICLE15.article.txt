# The 						Military
## ROTC Cadet Votes No 
### Unknown Soldier 
In response to yesterday's
column by the Navy ROTC
mid-ship, I would like to further
elaborate on the type of coercive
influence Army ROTC exerts on
its cadets by means of service
branches and the punitive clause,
and to further explain why I still
refuse to sign my name to this
column as I refused to sign last
Wednesday's column on ROTC.
To repeat, the Army ROTC
uses service branch assignments as
a means for enforcing military
conformity among its cadets. Any
cadet who refuses to fully play
the Army's game by supposedly
demonstrating excellence in
leadership ability, motivation,
enthusiasm, and political and
moral views, can most probably
expect to be assigned to a combat
branch.
No Army ROTC cadet can
really be assured of avoiding the
combat branches (Infantry,
Artillery, or Armor) unless he can
bootlick his way to the highly
sought "Distinguished Military
Student" designation thereby
obtaining his first branch choice.
It might also be of interest to note
that each Distinguished Military
Student designee is first selected
by the Professor of Military
Science and then sent for approval

to the President of Stanford
University. The branch that a
graduating cadet is assigned to
may mean the difference between
life and death.
A very high percentage of new
second lieutenants in any Army
branch are sent to Vietnam
shortly after commissioning
whether they be in the Infantry,
Signal Corps, Artillery,
Quartermaster Corps or whatever.
However, it is well understood by
Army ROTC cadets that a
Quartermaster Corps second
lieutenant in Vietnam has a much
better chance of staying alive than
does his Infantry counterpart. The
Stanford Army ROTC has nearly
complete control, autonomous
from Sixth headquarters, over
cadet branch assignments.
If a cadet's branch assignment
(assigned early in his senior year)
turns out to be Infantry at a time
when the war of aid to Saigon's
military dictatorship still drags on
with its high Infantry platoon
leader mortality rate, there is no
way out. The punitive clause in
Army ROTC contracts would
simply turn a potential lieutenant
in the Infantry into a private in
the Infantry.
In yesterday's column
"Another Cadet Speaks" the Navy
ROTC midshipman author seemed

to pride himself on signing his
name to his column which defined
ROTC's punitive clause as a
violation of the academic freedom
inherent in the university. The
Navy ROTC does not have control
over branch assignments as such,
but does exercise control over the
first duty assignments of
graduating ensigns (i.e. what type
of naval vessel individual ensigns
are assigned to).
The type of war being
perpetuated on the Vietnamese is
considerably more dangerous to
Army personnel than Navy
personnel, who for the most part
sit safely 20 miles from Vietnam's
shore and fire their guns where
the Army tells them to. The Army
ROTC exercises considerably
more control over the lives of its
cadets, and has eventual power of
life and death over them, than
does the Navy ROTC over its
midshipmen.
If you are not easily convinced
by the more popular argument
against having ROTC on campus,
namely that it is part of the
United States war machine and is
responsible for the deaths of
thousands of third world people,
that is somewhat understandable.
You cannot see Vietnamese
villages being napalmed, nor can
you see the Calleys and Medinas
who unfeelingly murder women,
children, and old men. You
cannot see the brutalization the
Army, Navy, and Air Force uses
on human beings in Vietnam. But
if you look hard enough, you can
see the repression ROTC
perpetuates on the minds of some
of its cadets, even though this is
infinitesimal compared to what
the military does in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.
This is one of the few, if small,
methods of military coercion
visible on this campus. Because
ROTC at Stanford has chosen to
retain the punitive clause and its
branch assignment methods, I as
an ROTC cadet, am going to vote
NO on ROTC in today's
referendum, for ROTC is a clear
violation of the academic freedom
that is said to exist at this
university.

cadet's name at his request. We

Signal Corps, Artillery,
Quartermaster Corps or whatever.
However, it is well understood by
Army ROTC cadets that a
Quartermaster Corps second
lieutenant in Vietnam has a much
better chance of staying alive than
does his Infantry counterpart. The
Stanford Army ROTC has nearly
complete control, autonomous
from Sixth headquarters, over
cadet branch assignments.
If a cadet's branch assignment
(assigned early in his senior year)
turns out to be Infantry at a time
when the war of aid to Saigon's
military dictatorship still drags on
with its high Infantry platoon
leader mortality rate, there is no
way out. The punitive clause in
Army ROTC contracts would
simply turn a potential lieutenant
in the Infantry into a private in
the Infantry.
In yesterday's column
"Another Cadet Speaks" the Navy
ROTC midshipman author seemed

to pride himself on signing his
name to his column which defined
ROTC's punitive clause as a
violation of the academic freedom
inherent in the university. The
Navy ROTC does not have control
over branch assignments as such,
but does exercise control over the
first duty assignments of
graduating ensigns (i.e. what type
of naval vessel individual ensigns
are assigned to).
The type of war being
perpetuated on the Vietnamese is
considerably more dangerous to
Army personnel than Navy
personnel, who for the most part
sit safely 20 miles from Vietnam's
shore and fire their guns where
the Army tells them to. The Army
ROTC exercises considerably
more control over the lives of its
cadets, and has eventual power of
life and death over them, than
does the Navy ROTC over its
midshipmen.
If you are not easily convinced
by the more popular argument
against having ROTC on campus,
namely that it is part of the
United States war machine and is
responsible for the deaths of
thousands of third world people,
that is somewhat understandable.
You cannot see Vietnamese
villages being napalmed, nor can
you see the Calleys and Medinas
who unfeelingly murder women,
children, and old men. You
cannot see the brutalization the
Army, Navy, and Air Force uses
on human beings in Vietnam. But
if you look hard enough, you can
see the repression ROTC
perpetuates on the minds of some
of its cadets, even though this is
infinitesimal compared to what
the military does in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.
This is one of the few, if small,
methods of military coercion
visible on this campus. Because
ROTC at Stanford has chosen to
retain the punitive clause and its
branch assignment methods, I as
an ROTC cadet, am going to vote
NO on ROTC in today's
referendum, for ROTC is a clear
violation of the academic freedom
that is said to exist at this
university.
The Daily is witholding the
cadet's name at his request. We
have checked his credentials as a
member of Army ROTC )
In response to yesterday's
column by the Navy ROTC
mid-ship, I would like to further
elaborate on the type of coercive
influence Army ROTC exerts on
its cadets by means of service
branches and the punitive clause,
and to further explain why I still
refuse to sign my name to this
column as I refused to sign last
Wednesday's column on ROTC.
To repeat, the Army ROTC
uses service branch assignments as
a means for enforcing military
conformity among its cadets. Any
cadet who refuses to fully play
the Army's game by supposedly
demonstrating excellence in
leadership ability, motivation,
enthusiasm, and political and
moral views, can most probably
expect to be assigned to a combat
branch.
No Army ROTC cadet can
really be assured of avoiding the
combat branches (Infantry,
Artillery, or Armor) unless he can
bootlick his way to the highly
sought "Distinguished Military
Student" designation thereby
obtaining his first branch choice.
It might also be of interest to note
that each Distinguished Military
Student designee is first selected
by the Professor of Military
Science and then sent for approval

to the President of Stanford
University. The branch that a
graduating cadet is assigned to
may mean the difference between
life and death.
A very high percentage of new
second lieutenants in any Army
branch are sent to Vietnam
shortly after commissioning
whether they be in the Infantry,
Signal Corps, Artillery,
Quartermaster Corps or whatever.

Army ROTC cadets that a
