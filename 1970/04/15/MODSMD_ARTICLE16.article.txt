# Senior Class Officers
## 
### 
Crosby,
Earl,
And Feldman
Our platform represents the
viewpoint that the offices of
Senior Class President,
Vice-President, and Senior Class
Business Manager are largely
apolitical. HOWEVER, we believe
that the best way to represent the
Senior Class is to encourage more
interaction between the students
and the world outside our
cloistered community, an
interaction which we hope will
result in a less painful transition
between senior year and our
post-graduate pursuits.
We are not running on any
idealistic, bloated statements of
"unifying" the class, because we
feel that as college seniors, a
feeling of unity within a class is
not half as important as helping to
establish a feeling of unity with
the world into which we will
graduate.
We are concerned about the
estimated loss of $9,000,000 in
alumni contributions to the
university over the last year, and
thus believe that closer contact
with alumni disillusioned or
otherwise, would not only benefit
the university, but graduating
seniors (looking for jobs, etc.) as
well!
We have all worked with alumni
in the past, either through the
Stanford Student-Alumni
Associates or through contact
within our own community, and
thus feel we are qualified to not
only endorse, but CARRY
THROUGH effective
senior-alumni programs (For
instance, we are interested in
continuing the success of the
HERITAGE FUND, which in the
past year raised $16,000 to help
worthy freshmen and sophomores
pay for their tuition).
Furthermore, through this
history of association with
alumni, as well incoming
freshmen, we feel that seniors
should be encouraged to help in
the recruitment of high school
students interested in Stanford.
Here again is a service to the
university which seniors, more
than anyone else in the university,
are qualified to give.
We are also interested in better
faculty-student relationships, and
feel that small, informal
faculty-senior lunches would
enable professors to write more
accurate recommendations. These
would be held in addition to

afternoon departmental-senior
get-togethers (held this year in the
Political Science Department on a
limited basis) in which the seniors
majoring in a given departmnet
would have a chance to meet with
all the profs in their dept.
Of course we endorse happy
hours for as frequently as we can
get a good turnout, and will vary
the environment by hold at least
one rousing HILL PARTY. We
have also considered beach parties
and using class dues for a concert
which would raise more money
for us, and also help ASSU
establish better special events.
P.S. We are willing to work
without salary - such a deal!
Ford,
Cady,
Velasquez,
And Elger
Despite the accepted
assumption that Senior Class
Officers have little or no
responsibility, John Ford, Teresa
Cade, Dave Velasquez, and John
Elger still see these positions as
potentially meaningful in
establishing better relations
between students and faculty,
opening more communication
channels with alumni, and
eliminating financial waste. Thus,
we offer the following ideas for
your consideration.
The Senior Class should be
instrumental in establishing and
coordinating student-faculty
organizations within each
academic department. Faculty
directories for individual
department. Faculty directories
for individual departments which
acquaint people with particular
backgrounds and interests of
faculty members should be
available to seniors. Funds and
facilities are needed to allow
students to meet their advisors
more regularly - over lunch or any
place outside the academic
environment. Small seminars for
no credit can be instituted within
individual departments where
students can meet and discuss
future goals and opportunities
with more faculty members than
their advisor alone.
Stanford should avail itself of

its versatile alumni and sponsor a
variety of people to speak to
seniors on future possibilities and
encourage the alumni to aid
graduating seniors in securing
future positions. At the same
time, students from the Senior
Class should be given a greater
opportunity to speak to and meet
with alumni on their terms. This
would only help to strengthen the
bonds between these divergent
groups. We recognize the
importance of alumni during
Stanford's financial crisis.
Therefore, we support and will
continue such efforts as the
Heritage Fund and SUN.
Initially, if we are to reduce
financial demands upon seniors
and reallocate our funds more
effectively, the social program
must be reevaluated. Happy Hours
are a satisfactory means of
bringing seniors together and
should be continued. But, who
ever heard of the Senior Ball,
which costs many dollars? With
better management, smaller social
events can bring more people
together. We would also like to
organize one social event, the
profits of which would be
donated to a worthy scholarship
fund. Secondly, some students
spend more money senior year on
tuition than need be. We would
urge the administration to
institute reduced tuition for those
students taking less than 13 units.
Provide Services
In conclusion, we will publish
monthly a letter concerning
seniors and their activities. We
wish to provide services for you
which will alleviate some of the
constant harassments of senior
year.
John Ford, a history major, was
a Stanford-in-Washington intern
last summer. He is presently
serving on the Overseas Campus
Board.
David Velasquez is an
economics major and is also a
member of the Overseas Campus
Board. He spent six months at
Stanford-in-Italy and is now the
Residence Editor of the Quad.
Teresa Cady is majoring in
history and French. She served on
Axe Command spent
Spring-Summer 1 969 at
Stanford-in-France.
John Elger is presently
Financial Manager of Phi Kappa
Sigma. He has served on Axe
Command is a civil engineering
maior.
Because of a last minute
change, Teresa Cady's and Dave
Velasquez's name will not appear

on the ballot. However, they are
both definitely candidates for
Senior Class Offices running with
John Ford and John Elger.
Jordan,
Buhler,
Combs,
And Porter
If four candidates have ever
undergone a triai by fire, we have.
For six months now we have
inhabited the same tenement of
Manzanita Park and squabbled
about everything from
dishwashing to politics. We shot
so much bull at each other that,
having none left to shoot, we were
forced to negotiate peace.
In the meantime however, we
have co-operated on campus
projects in support of Tom
Bradley for Mayor of L.A. and
John Lindsay for Mayor of New
York. In 1968, Kevin Porter
worked in the Kennedy
Campaign, Bill Jordan in the
McCarthy Campaign, and Roman
Buhler in the Rockefeller
campaign. Bill and Kevin are now
working for liberal Democrat
George Brown, while Roman
wastes his time trying to liberalize
the Young Republicans. Charlie
Combs, an a-political Turkey,
adds a badly needed touch of
sanity to the group.
While we're boasting about our
activism, we might as well
mention that Kevin is an Alumni
Associate and will be teaching in
Indonesia for Volunteers in Asia.
Bill is a member of the Overseas
Campuses Board, and Charlie used
to be the Athletic Director of
Mayfield House. Our Business
Manager, Bart Shenone, was the
Business Manager of El Campo
eating club. We're trying to
de-emphasize Roman's role in the
campaign, although he writes all
the propaganda, so we won't
boast about him.
We are running because we
believe that we can do a good job
as Senior Class President and still
have as much fun as the rest of
you.
Get The Job Done
We personally regret the lack of
opportunity we have had to meet
faculty and trustees informally.
You can count on us to encourage
such contacts through dinner
programs and, perhaps, temporary
live-in arrangements.
We will continue to support the
Heritage Scholarship Fund for
disadvantaged students which is
now sponsored by the Senior
Class.
The Alumni will hear a great
deal from us as we try to establish
communications with them and
break down the walls of
misunderstanding which, among
other things are costing Stanford a
great deal of badly needed money.
You will undoubtedly be happy
to know that we plan to continue
the "Happy Hour" tradition at
the beach, the bar, and even at
Lake Tahoe.
Finally, we guarantee a
stimulating commencement
program for all.
If we have not made enough
promises to satisfy you, vote for
somebody else, but we believe we
can get the job done and get it
done well.
We invite our supporters,
hangers-on, and other assorted
riff-raff to our first Happy Hour
(BYO) at Trailer 17Y on Friday,
April 17, at 4:00 p.m. DANCE IN
THE STREET!
