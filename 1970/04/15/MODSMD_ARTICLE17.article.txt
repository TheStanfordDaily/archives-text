# April 18th
## Environment Canvass 
### Barbara Fenner 
! Saturday, April 18 is an important day for everyone concerned
'about saving our environment while it is still salvageable. In
conjunction with the April 22 Environmental Teach-in, Saturday,
April 18 has been designated as the day for convassing the
surrounding communities to stimulate awareness and urge action on
the crucial problems affecting the well-being of everyone.
"Why canvass? What good does it do to talk to people? They won't
change their minds anyway." These are some of the comments
frequently heard whenever canvassing is mentioned.
Canvassing can make a difference, especially on these serious
environmental issues. People need to realize exactly how grave the
current situation is, how we are raping and ravaging the environment,
never thinking that perhaps there is not an infinite supply of
resources. Talking to people about these issues may not seem to have
any immediate effect, but at least it may motivate them to think and
talk, a necessary first step in creating an urgent awareness of the
current crises.
Once awareness and sincere concern are generated, action ana
involvement follow more easily. It is imperative to develop grass roots
pressure on politicians and corporations to change their present
policies which are so detrimental to the ecology. People can have an
impact upon the decisions of these two powerful groups, but only if
they make their voices of protest and indignation heard.
Individual Action
Many people profess a concern for the welfare of the environment
but haven't yet made the commitment to take action, possibly
because they don't know what, if anything, one person can do. Our
canvassing materials are aimed primarily at this point, what an
individual actually can do.
Included will be interviews with Congressmen and Congressional
candidates designed to discover their positions on environmental
issues as well as names and addresses of ecology organizations which
need many members if they are to be at all effective in fighting for a
purer environment. There will also be information on recycling as an
illustration of the new attitude of consumption or
"non-consumption" which we must all adopt if we hope to alter the
present environmental detereoration.
By suggesting numerous steps an individual can take, steps which
may cause some inconvenience and hardship but which are now
required by the seriousness of the crisis, we hope to stress the
importance of each individual's participation in this ideological,
political, and economic campaign.
Need Help
Canvassing on Saturday, April 18 is a crucial part of the whole
Environmental Teach-in since it is the activity which reaches the
community most directly. To have any impact, at all there must be a
large number of people willing to participate and show their concern
by talking to others. We need your help. Come to the ASSU office
Saturday at 8:30 or 1 2:30 for morning or afternoon assignments.
Additional canvassing details and instructions will be presented at
an important meeting Thursday at 7:30 in the Tresidder Large
Lounge. Professor Arthur Hastings will again discuss canvassing
approaches, this time with a greater emphasis on role-playing.

conjunction with the April 22 Environmental Teach-in, Saturday,
April 18 has been designated as the day for convassing the
surrounding communities to stimulate awareness and urge action on
the crucial problems affecting the well-being of everyone.
"Why canvass? What good does it do to talk to people? They won't
change their minds anyway." These are some of the comments
frequently heard whenever canvassing is mentioned.
Canvassing can make a difference, especially on these serious
environmental issues. People need to realize exactly how grave the
current situation is, how we are raping and ravaging the environment,
never thinking that perhaps there is not an infinite supply of
resources. Talking to people about these issues may not seem to have
any immediate effect, but at least it may motivate them to think and
talk, a necessary first step in creating an urgent awareness of the
current crises.
Once awareness and sincere concern are generated, action ana
involvement follow more easily. It is imperative to develop grass roots
pressure on politicians and corporations to change their present
policies which are so detrimental to the ecology. People can have an
impact upon the decisions of these two powerful groups, but only if
they make their voices of protest and indignation heard.
Individual Action
Many people profess a concern for the welfare of the environment
but haven't yet made the commitment to take action, possibly
because they don't know what, if anything, one person can do. Our
canvassing materials are aimed primarily at this point, what an
individual actually can do.
Included will be interviews with Congressmen and Congressional
candidates designed to discover their positions on environmental
issues as well as names and addresses of ecology organizations which
need many members if they are to be at all effective in fighting for a
purer environment. There will also be information on recycling as an
illustration of the new attitude of consumption or
"non-consumption" which we must all adopt if we hope to alter the
present environmental detereoration.
By suggesting numerous steps an individual can take, steps which
may cause some inconvenience and hardship but which are now
required by the seriousness of the crisis, we hope to stress the
importance of each individual's participation in this ideological,
political, and economic campaign.
Need Help
Canvassing on Saturday, April 18 is a crucial part of the whole
Environmental Teach-in since it is the activity which reaches the
community most directly. To have any impact, at all there must be a
large number of people willing to participate and show their concern
by talking to others. We need your help. Come to the ASSU office
Saturday at 8:30 or 1 2:30 for morning or afternoon assignments.
Additional canvassing details and instructions will be presented at
an important meeting Thursday at 7:30 in the Tresidder Large
Lounge. Professor Arthur Hastings will again discuss canvassing
approaches, this time with a greater emphasis on role-playing.
