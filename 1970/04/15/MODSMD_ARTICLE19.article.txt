# Draft Deserters Face Uncertainty
## 
### JOHN SLOAN 
Last Friday's article dealt
mainly with facts and figures
concerning Americans who are
now in Canada. But it is people
who go to Canada, people who
make the decision to leave this
country, and people who must
face up to the consequences. For
the most part they are leaving
everything, beginning again
in conditions which are, at best,
uncertain.
Few of the draft-dodgers have
had an easy time. If their troubles
didn't start when they were still in
the U.S., then they began on
arrival in Canada. For most the
problems at hand were to obtain
landed immigrant status and to
get a job. If one didn't get the
former there is the possibility that
he could be deported back to jail
or the army, and if he couldn't get
the latter he might starve.
Mike is a 22-year-old from
Seattle. He's been in Canada for a
year, applied for landed
immigrant status once, been
rejected, and is now in the process
of appealing.
This isn't the first time that
he's been in Canada. He came up
once when he was 18, stayed a
month, but was unable to get
landed immigrant status, so he
returned to the U.S. There, he
applied for conscientious objector
status but was unable to obtain it.
So, he dropped out of college and
just waited to be called up. When
his notice came he didn't do
anything.
"Then one morning the FBI
came to our house, barged in and
arrested me for draft evasion.
They took me before a U.S.
Marshall who released me on
personal recognisance. The FBI
had come once before to talk to
me, but it was actually three
months later before they finally
came and arrested me. The whole
process before my trial took
almost a year and just before my
trial was to take place I decided to
come to Canada. It had been
brewing a long time."
What has happened to him
since he arrived? "Originally I had
$200 but now I'm living on
money that people in the states
owe me. I had a friend who was
deported because he admitted
that he had taken drugs. He was
on an honesty trip, but he was
able to sneak across the border
again. However, there has been
one attempt to turn us over to the
FBI."
And what does he think about
Canada? "I want to live here. I
don't think that I'd go back even
if there was amnesty. Ya, I prefer
it in a lot of ways."
Jim is a tall, 20 year old with a
ready smile. A native of Detroit,
he served in the marines for a
while, saw action in Vietnam and
is now a deserter. He's been in

Canada for eight months.
He came back to the U.S. and
was stationed at Barstow,
California before he was due to
return to Vietnam. "One day I
decided that I couldn't take all
this shit they were feeding me, so
I went AWOL and hitchhiked up
to Canada."
Jim is not applying for
immigrant status and has a job as
a tile company clerk. He obtained
a social security number illegally
by claiming he was from Windsor,
Ontario which Ls just across the
river from Detroit. He hasn't had
any help from his parents
financially or otherwise, in fact
his family and friends call him a
coward.
If he is refused landed
immigrant status. . ."I guess I'll go
east or go to Sweden. I'm hassled
about the whole thing in the U.S.
All the nervous breakdown and
shit they're all about the war. If I
get status I'd like to go to
university but, as for now, I'm
making it out OK."
