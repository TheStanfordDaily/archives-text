# Petitions Support S. Viet Students
## 
### 
Concerned Asian Scholars
(CCAS) will be collecting
signatures at Engineering corner
tomorrow in support of South
Vietnamese students in Japan.
The students are threatened with
deportation to Saigon where three
now face sentences of six to
twenty years for refusing
induction.
The three students are leaders
of Beheito or "Vietnamese in
Japan fighting for peace and unity
of our Fatherland." Beheito has
been responsible for
demonstrations against the
Thieu-Ky regime and against the
war.
On September 20, following
memorial rallies for Ho Chi Minh,
the three leaders of Beheito were

ordered to report for induction.
They refused and were tried and
sentenced in absentia by a South
Vietnamese military court.
Vietnamese students in Japan
must renew their passports each
April, and it is likely these three
as well as other members of
Beheito will be denied renewal.
The Japanese have often deported
Asian activists before, including
one whose life may have been
saved by a campaign similar to
tomorrow's.
Beheito has appealed to
American students to support
their stand. Petitions will be
available all day tomorrow at
Engineering corner. Anyone
interested in further information
should contact CCAS at 551
Salvatierra Street, ext. 3362.
