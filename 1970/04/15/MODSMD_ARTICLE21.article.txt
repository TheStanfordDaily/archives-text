# Pitzer Endorses End-Day Teach-in
## 
### 
President Kenneth S. Pitzer has
endorsed the nationwide
ecological teach-in scheduled and
designated April 22 as END Day
(Environment Near Death).
"It is an educational project
worthy of the attention and
support of all citizens," he said.
"The program of events
planned in observance of this
day," President Pitzer said, "is
designed to help educate the
university community and the
public on environmental problems
and what can be done about
them.
"I commend those who will
devote this day to becoming truly
informed about our environment.
"Regularly scheduled classes
will not be cancelled on the
22nd," President Pitzer added,
"But I would hope that many
members of the faculty will find it
appropriate to plan their class
periods for some enlightened
discussion of environmental
concerns, ideally within the
context of their own disciplines."
All students, faculty and staff
have been asked to abandon
automobiles on END Day and
bicycle to, from and around the
campus as a means of diminishing
the daily outpouring of air
pollution from auto exhausts.
Stanford will present an
ecological fair, scheduled to be
opened at 10 a.m. by Miss
Stephanie Mills, editor of Earth
Times, and actor Eddie Albert,
star of the TV series, "Green

Acres." Miss Jeanne Friedman,
former Stanford activist, also will
speak.
A panel discussion of the
nation's ecological problems is
planned for 7:30 p.m. in
Memorial Church. Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, Nobel Laureate in
genetics at the Medical School,
will serve as moderator. Panelists
include political activist Steve
Weismann, Congressman Paul N.
"Pete" McCloskey Jr. (R.-Portola
Valley), and Stanford Vice
President for Business Affairs Alf
E. Brandin.
Exhibitors scheduled to man
booths at the fair include Zero
Population Growth, the
Environmental Law Society,
Ecology Action, Build the Earth,
and the Sierra Club. Continuous
slide and movie shows are
scheduled for a neighboring
auditorium
END Day activities will be
followed up with a series of
workshops on Saturday, April 25.
These will cover such topics as
logging in the Santa Cruz ranges,
air and water pollution,
environmental engineering,
problems of the urban minorities
and the war in Vietnam
