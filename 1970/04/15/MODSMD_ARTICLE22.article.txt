# 6 Of 9 From FCM
## SCLC Candidates 
### 
JAMES L. "Rocky"
Barber is an ASSU Senator and is
on the Senate's committee
investigating ASSU finances. He is
a freshman in Branner, with an
undergraduate studies major.
He says "SCLC has a duty to
review all rules to look for
inconsistencies and to accomodate
change." He thinks President
Pitzer's decision to close the
ROTC building without informing
SCLC is a "definite violation of
student rights."
Paul Busse, a sophomore
transfer from Northwestern, is an
economics major living in
Burbank. He is a "nonviolent
libertarian" active in FCM and
works for the ARENA. He says"I
am very concerned about the
violence of the past few weeks—l
think SCLC can be useful."
Cynthia Cherbak, the only
female running, wants "to change
SCLC from a slow, ineffective
watchdog of Jane Stanford's
moral-crammed will to a source of
effective student power to
determine the laws which effect

them." Cherbak, a sophomore
major in Communications and
Economics, has been active in
KZSU news editing, Pre-Reg
Committee, the COMPANY, and
the Stanford Elementary School
Environmental Teach-in.
She feels the major issues of
SCLC "lie in its structure" and
that it can be a "forum for
student opinion and a source of
student power" and that it should
prevent the SJC from enforcing
University Policy "while the
students remain voiceless."
Steven L. Guerra, a history
junior, has been interested in legal
systems for a long time. He has
been to Stanford-in-Washington
and was on his dorm's judicial
council. He is also a member of
FCM. He says "some rules have
been around a little too long and
should either be abolished or
enforced."
He thinks "the important thing
to do is to decentralize the
system—but to make sure a small
group of people don't take over
smaller judicial systems." He also
thinks that there should be a
review of "just how the judicial
council should see actions
committed because of some
higher moral or political
rationale."
Chris Hocker, a freshman in
English, is a writer for the
ARENA and has run for ASSU
Senate. He thinks "SCLC is
encumbered with a bunch of
obsolete rules. This I think SCLC
can be made a lot more compact,
with fewer and more relevant
regulations." He says the
"advisory capacity of SCLC is the
most important thing it can face"
and also criticizes Pitzer's rccent
action bypassing the Council.
Another freshman,
Harries-Clichy Peterson, Jr., is
"against punitive legislation" if it
is going to be there it should be
meaningful" and thinks
"abolishing regulations this year
was good." Peterson, also in FCM
and an ARENA staffer, feels that
"what we need is not more laws
but less laws" and the "student
conduct really shouldn't be
legislated." If that is necessary, it
should be only to "restrict
people's actions that infringe on
other's rights."
Robert Sprio feels that there
are two main problems for SCLC
to face. One is "the very nature of
the legal structure of the
campus—it is considered the
property of the Trustees." The
other is the "summary power of
the President to enact just about
what he wants, regardless of the

SJC and SCLC."
Spiro, a junior in political
science, is a former LASSU
senator and has been on the
Student Education Council and
the Committee on Faculty-Staff
affairs. The reason he is running is
"what I consider to be a
discriminatory use of the campus
disruption policy and arbitrary
use of the judicial system and
outside courts."
John Washburn, a freshman
member of FCM, has also been
active in Glee Club and Stanford
Christian Fellowship. He feels that
"the rule of law is important in an
academic community" and that
this rule is "strenghtened by good
rules." SCLC is much better than
getting "off-the-cuff rules from
the President" and he hopes to
avoid rules being made "by
political factions to further their
own success."
Raymond White is the only
graduate Biology student in the
race. He is also in FCM. He states
that "Stanford's Judical system
must be firm enough to control
disruptions on this campus. . . at
the same time the judical system
must reflect the values of the
time. I favor abolition of social
regulations regarding liquor, hours
and dress. We need a minimum of
rules adequately enforced."
White concurs and supports the
"unfortunately necessary steps
which President Pitzer has had to
take."
