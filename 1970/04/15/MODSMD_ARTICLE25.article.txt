### 
One of the main objectives of the April
twenty-second Environmental Teach-in is
to increase awareness and understanding of
the urgency and complexity of our
environmental and population problems.
Towards this end, Stanford students will
canvass the surrounding communities on
Saturday, April 18. They will be taking
with them copies of a special edition of the
Cross Currenls newspaper which is devoted,
with a local focus, to the environmental
crisis. Groups will leave the campus in car
pools at 8:30 in the morning and 1:00 in

the afternoon, and will return by noon and
4 p.m. respectively. Target areas include
Portola Valley, Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Los
Altos, and Los Altos Hills.
A preparatory meeting will be held on
Thursday night at 7:30 in the Tresidder
Large Lounge. Professor Arthur Hastings
will use role-playing to recreate possible
canvassing situations and will elaborate on
the communication techniques he discussed
at last Thursday's meeting. All those
interested in canvassing are urged to attend.
