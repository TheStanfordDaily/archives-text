# Varied Actions In ROTC Protest
## 
### 
Anti-ROTC protests took a
peaceful bend yesterday with a
non-violent gathering, two fasts
and a planned anti-ROTC
information center outside
President Pitzer's office.
About 50 protesters gathered
outside the Graduate School of
Business in an attempt to meet
and talk with Trustees at the end
of their meeting yesterday
morning. There were no incidents
and the trustees were generally
unconcerned about the
demonstration.
At one point while the trustees
were still meeting Associate
Provost Robert Rosenzweig
brought out coffee and sweetrolls,
provided by the University, for
the protesters.

Two groups have begun fasts
in protest of ROTC on campus.
One group, staying in the White
Plaza mall, will fast through
Thursday night after the
referendum vote; the other group
will camp out in front of
President Pitzers office and may
continue for two weeks.
"The basic thing behind it is a
belief that there is a cycle of
violence, and that it must stop,"
Dave Fidanque, a member of the
first group stated. "There must be
an affirmative alternative to it."
According to Fidanque, "Our
immediate goal is to influence
people to vote in the ROTC
referendum. Yesterday 20 persons
participated, and more are
expected to join today.

The second group, led by Stan
Krute and Roland Silva, is seeking
to have the trustees participate in
a public forum on ROTC with all
members of the Stanford
community. The group met at
noon outside Pitzer's office
yesterday and plans to return
today.
Krute says that the area in
front of Pitzer's office is going to
be used to set up a department of
anti-ROTC information. Members
of the group have been going to
dorms encouraging participation
in the peaceful gathering which
they hope to stimulate.
In related action, the
Committee of Concerned Asian
Scholars yesterday unanimously
voted to oppose the presence of
ROTC on the Stanford Campus.
