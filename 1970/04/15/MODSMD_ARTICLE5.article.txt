# Trustees Reject Pennsylvania Law On Campus Dissidents
## 
### KAURA HORN 
Stanford Trustees will no
longer tolerate a provision in
Pennsylvania law requiring the
university to provide the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency with "name,
address, and pertinent facts"

concerning any student from
Pennsylvania who engages in
campus disruption.
Y esterday afternoon the
trustees voted unanimously to
reject a proposed agreement for
Pennsylvania scholarship funds.
According to a background
report presented to the Board,
"those provisions which require
the termination of (student) aid
for misconduct which does not in
the judgement of the University
community justify suspension or
dismissal are attempts, in effect,
to deny the deprived student a
chance to continue his education
(even though) the University
judges him fit for that purpose."
Precedent Set
The Trustee's action sets a
precedent for how the University
will handle future "anti-riot"
riders in educational assistance
agreements. Proposed legislation
both in Congress and in the
California legislature is, in the
words of one spokesman, "pretty
ominous".
While laws now on the books
give the University an opportunity
to decide whether or not
scholarship funds will be withheld
from disruptive students, the
proposed legislation, like the
Pennsylvania law, leaves the
University no opportunity to
intervene.
As a result, the trustees view
yesterday's vote as an assertion of
their determination to preserve
"freedom of speech. . .freedom of

association. . ." and the "right to
demonstrate and dissent."
According to James V. Siena,
Legal Advisor to President Pitzer,
Stanford has already had to learn
how to deal with "non-consensual
and non-rational ways of solving
disputes."
By restricting the university's
methods of handling disruption,
the "government is coming in at
the end of the game. . .Efforts
may hurt universities more than
they help."
Instrsion Cited
"The level of intrusion can't
help but grow" commented Peter
Bulkeley, Dean of Students.
At present, Stanford has 230
undergraduates and 56 graduate
students with home addresses in
Pennsylvania. Eight are receiving
aid from the state agency, totaling
$5,572 this year. Sixteen have
loans totaling $16,000.
Those students who lose their
aid as a result of yesterday's
decision will be entitled to aid
under the Stanford assistance
program, providing they meet
Stanford requirements.
"We will treat any student from
Pennsylvania who applies for aid
as if his state didn't have an aid
program" said Siena.
The background paper notes
that "provisions of this sort are
unwise in that they do not go far
to achieve the legislative purpose,
while at the same time they
introduce distortion in the normal
functioning of the university."
