# Chicano Students Rally
## 
### 
A group of Chicanos attached
the farmworkers black eagle flag
below the U.S. flag at the Post
Office during a noon rally at
White Plaza yesterday.
The farmworkers emblem was
hauled down after the rally.
The noon rally was a kick-off
for MECHA'S Semana De La
Raza, a week of seminars, rallies,
and theatrical events on the
Chicano movement.
Speaking at the rally attended
by 300 persons were Venustiano
Holguin and Elizabeth Rodriguez,
leaders of the farmworkers strike
against grapegrowers in Delano
and the Coachella Valley.
Farmworkers recently signed a
contract with three growers in the
Coachella Valley.
They said that union-picked
grapes now bear the "Huelga
Eagle" symbol to proclaim the
fact that they are sanctioned by
the union. The speakers warned
all consumers to purchase only
grapes bearing this label and to
continue to boycott non-union
grapes.
Following the speeches, a
march to Memorial Church was
led by musicians from the Teatro
Urbano, a street theatre group, by
way of the Meyer Library. The
singing, clapping group walked
through the ivy-covered arches of
the inner quad and were greeted
by bystanders watching from the
corridors and classrooms of the
sandstone structures.
A 1:00 p.m. rally at White
Piaza today will hear Sal Castro,
militant Los Angeles educator,
and Jose Angel Gutierrez,
co-founder of Texas MAYO
(Mexican American Youth
Organization) and leader of the
school walkouts last December in
Crystal City, Texas.
This evening the attention turns
to Chicano political power when
Denver's Rodolfo "Corky"
Gonzalez, leader of the Crusade
for Justice, and organizer of an
independent Chicano political
party, speaks at 7:30 p.m. in
Memorial Church.
