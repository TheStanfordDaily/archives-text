# Yippie Leader Jerry Rubin Urges Crowd To ‘Do It' Now
## 
### DAVE BRENNER 
Yippie leader Jerry Rubin
expounded his famour "DO It"
philosophy to a "riot" almost
1400 students large in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
According to present standards,
Rubin explained, any meeting of
three or more people constitutes a
riot.
After introducing himself as
"Johnny Cash visiting Stanford
Penitentiary" Rubin talked about
the problems facing Stanford
students. "The most oppressed are
not the blacks or the poor, but
the rich. Children or the rich have
nothing to fight for. They are
born into the prison of suburbia."
Oppression and revolution
formed the axis around which
Rubin's arguments revolved. More
specifically, he attacked schools
and universities, the court system,
ROTC, and the repression of

youth by society. He
encompassed all these ills by
saying, "America is destroying its
youth. Parents kill their children.
We're facing genocide. We're in
the way - public nuisances. They
send the blacks to Vietnam and
the whites to high schools and
colleges."
Rubin then developed an anal
analysis of the educational
dilemma. "Every student is a
political prisoner. This is just
advanced toilet training. They're
training us to be new trustees.
Fuck grades. Fuck exams. Start
by not going to class tomorrow.
Taking an exam is like taking a
shit. You collect it all then drop it
on the right day."
Close Universities
He spoke of the war being
fought in Vietnam and of the war
that must be fought on the
campuses to free the minds of
students. "The war is not just in
Asia, or in the ghettos; it's on
campuses. School imposes guilt,
it's a pacification program.
Intellectuals are working for
nothing. We can only secceed by
breaking it down. If we close the
universities we deliver a body
blow to society."
Warning against becoming an
intellectual, Rubin stated that
liberals are the greatest threat to
the movement. He cited the
example of the liberal jurors in
the "Chicago 7" trial who
acknowledged the defendants'
innocence but succumbed to
pressure from the more hard-line
jurors in delivering a guilty verdict
and not holding out for complete
acquittal.
He drew a comparison between
the conflict on campuses and the
battles being fought in American
courtrooms. "A trial is just like
school, you always get graded at
the end of a trial.

"The law is corrupt. It's
whatever the establishment wants
it to be."
In his speech, the Yippee leader
demanded an immediate end to
ROTC regardless of the outcome
of the upcoming referendum. "I
don't care of 99.99% want it.
ROTC should be off. There is no
civil liberty to kill. Certain things
don't rate votes-ROTC is one of
them."
'Kill Your Parents'
The crowd was sympathetic to
most of Rubin's attacks on
schools and the courts. Scattered
applause and good natured
laughter marked the majority of
his talk. But a stunned hush fell
over the hall when he flatly stated
a fundamental tenent of the
Yippie credo, "Kill your parents.
They are dictators over us.
They're trying to get us to lead
the same miserable lives they do."
Rubin admittedly stoned, led
the audience on an emotional
rollercoaster, bringing them up
and letting them down. His
conclusion came up an up beat
and left many eager for action.
He said, "Action is what
counts. Don't go on an
intellectual trip. This is a life trip.
I'm talking about life and death.
Books should be burned-they
oppress us. Fuck history. Get
stoned and look to the future.
There are only two important
words in my book, DO IT."
Many were moved to simply
leave the auditorium, but several
hundred stayed to develop a plan
of immediate action. In the face
of continuing debate a steady
stream of people began to file out.
In desperation a hasty vote was
taken and the remaining students
walked over to the ROTC
building, which they soon left
after remaining outside.
