# Students Don't â€˜Do It'

### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
IBM says "Think."
Jerry Rubin says "Do It."
Twelve hundred Stanford
students wildly cheered Jerry
Rubin in Memorial Auditorium
yesterday. And then went back to
their dorms to think.
More precisely, considering it
was dinner time, 1200 students
screamed approval to Do It, and
then decided to eat it.
For more than an hour, the
colorful, exciting Rubin kept the
audience laughing, thinking, and
applauding. They loved him A
crescendo of excitment
developed, and when Rubin raised
his fist in a final salute to action,
the audience rose in an outburst
of approval.

The air was electric. The only
question was whether they would
Do It to Pitzer's office or Encina
or the ROTC building. One yell to
move on ROTC might have
directed the explosive energy.
Moments later it was too late.
Two thirds of the crowd was
leaving, and even those remaining
decided to think. A proposal to
occupy the ROTC building passed
a vote but no one moved.
Eventually, almost inevitably, the
electricity faded and a short,
lethargie meeting of 200 students
was held outside the ROTC
headquarters.
When Jerry Rubin pleaded that
people "Do It,"he did not realize
Stanford students would have a
catharsis and leave it at that.
The intellectuals "did it" again.
