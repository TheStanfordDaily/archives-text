## Apollo 13 Heads For Earth 
### 
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP)
— Three American astronauts gave
their stricken spaceship a burst of
rocket power Tuesday to hurry
them home before their vital and
already short supplies of water,
oxygen and electricity run out.
The rocket burst, borrowed
from the prime engine of the little
moon lander, will bring Apollo 13
crewmen James A. Lovell Jr.,
Fred W. Haise Jr. and Jack L.
Swigert Jr. to earth 10 hours
earlier than planned.
Little more than l'/z hours
before the rocket firing, they
emerged from their only pass
behind the moon, their only
close-up view of the surface they
had hoped to explore. For almost
40 minutes, blocked from earth
by the lunar surface, they were
out of contact.
When they came out at 7:16
p.m. EST, they were on a return
course of their abbreviated
journey, heading for a splashdown
in the Pacific Ocean about 300
miles south-southeast of Samoa
on Friday at about 12:18 p.m.
EST.
The astronauts must keep their
command ship docked to
Aquarius until only minutes
before plunging into the earth's
atmosphere on Friday. Then
they'll jettison the small craft and
ride to earth breathing only the
oxygen left in the cabin of the
command ship.
A tropical storm that could
develop into a hurricane headed
toward the Apollo 13 splashdown
site in the Pacific Tuesday. A
recovery ship awaited the
astronauts' early return to earth.
Weather observers said that if
Tropical Storm Helen maintains
its present course and speed, it

should be about 200 miles
north-west of the target point by
the scheduled splashdown time
Friday.
Should the weather become a
critical factor, the spacecraft
could move its target point 200
miles up or down the mid-Pacific
recovery line in the final hours.
Mission Control said it
expected a carbon dioxide
buildup in the capsule and was
not alarmed when it appeared last
night, but the astronauts were
clearly concerned when the
warning lights flashed.
Despite its statement that it
was not concerned with the
carbon dioxide, Mission Control
responded quickly to the
astronauts' report. It ordered
them to rig up a quick, makeshift
air-cleansing device to cope with
the potential breathing hazard.
Officials were concerned
mainly with the water supply.
With 72 hours to go, based on a
Friday landing, they had enough
water for 84 hours, a margin of 1 2
hours. To keep this margin, the
astronauts must power down to
minimum electrical po'vei of 17
amperes per hour for most of the
journey, reducitn the average
hourly water consumption from
five to 2.68 pounds. The water is
used for coolin the electronics
and cabin ox i u as well as for
drinking.
Suprrmr Court
WASHINGTON (AP) - Judge
Harry A. Blackmun of Minnesota
was named Tuesday by President
Nixon to fill the much fought
over Supreme Court vacancy
which is now nearly a year old.
The appointment, announced
bv presidential press secretary

Ronald L. Ziegler some hours
after it had become known
unofficially, is Nixon's third
effort to fill the long-vacant seat.
Ziegler told reporters the
61-year-old member of the Bth
U.S. Court of Appeals was
selected from a group of six
possibilities. The press secretary
said that in contrast to the
procedure on the two earlier
appointments the President
conferred in person with
Blackman before nominating him.
Ziegler continued:
"The President said he was
highly impressed with Judge
Blackmun's personal qualities and
that he was highly impressed
when he studied the judicial
record. He considers Judge
Blackmun to be a strict
constructionist."
Although Blackmun is a
longtime close personal friend of
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger,
Ziegler said Burger made no
recommendation for Blackmun's
appointment. But the chief justice
was consulted on the appointee's
record, Ziegler said.
The Senate Judiciary
Committee plans to start public
hearings a week after the
nomination is submitted formally
to the Senate.
If no major opposition
develops, it is likely that
committee and floor votes will
come quickly so that the court
can be restored to its normal
complement of nine justices.
Republican Senate leaders and
GOP members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee met for
about an hour Tuesday with
Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindien.it and were briefed on
the nominee selected by the
President.

But Sen. Milton R. Young of
North Dakota, one of the GOP
leaders who attended the meeting
with Kleindienst, told reporters he
sees no reason why Blackmun
should have any difficulty in
being confirmed.
Former Minnesota Sen. Hubert
H. Humphrey said Monday
Blackmun is the kind of man he
would like to have on the court.
Blackmun was reached during a
court recess of the appellate court
at St. Louis after the report of his
pending nomination was
circulated but he would not
comment beyond saying "I have
mixed emotions about it, even if
it should come."

had hoped to explore. For almost
40 minutes, blocked from earth
by the lunar surface, they were
out of contact.
When they came out at 7:16
p.m. EST, they were on a return
course of their abbreviated
journey, heading for a splashdown
in the Pacific Ocean about 300
miles south-southeast of Samoa
on Friday at about 12:18 p.m.
EST.
The astronauts must keep their
command ship docked to
Aquarius until only minutes
before plunging into the earth's
atmosphere on Friday. Then
they'll jettison the small craft and
ride to earth breathing only the
oxygen left in the cabin of the
command ship.
A tropical storm that could
develop into a hurricane headed
toward the Apollo 13 splashdown
site in the Pacific Tuesday. A
recovery ship awaited the
astronauts' early return to earth.
Weather observers said that if
Tropical Storm Helen maintains
its present course and speed, it

should be about 200 miles
north-west of the target point by
the scheduled splashdown time
Friday.
Should the weather become a
critical factor, the spacecraft
could move its target point 200
miles up or down the mid-Pacific
recovery line in the final hours.
Mission Control said it
expected a carbon dioxide
buildup in the capsule and was
not alarmed when it appeared last
night, but the astronauts were
clearly concerned when the
warning lights flashed.
Despite its statement that it
was not concerned with the
carbon dioxide, Mission Control
responded quickly to the
astronauts' report. It ordered
them to rig up a quick, makeshift
air-cleansing device to cope with
the potential breathing hazard.
Officials were concerned
mainly with the water supply.
With 72 hours to go, based on a
Friday landing, they had enough
water for 84 hours, a margin of 1 2
hours. To keep this margin, the
astronauts must power down to
minimum electrical po'vei of 17
amperes per hour for most of the
journey, reducitn the average
hourly water consumption from
five to 2.68 pounds. The water is
used for coolin the electronics
and cabin ox i u as well as for
drinking.
Suprrmr Court
WASHINGTON (AP) - Judge
Harry A. Blackmun of Minnesota
was named Tuesday by President
Nixon to fill the much fought
over Supreme Court vacancy
which is now nearly a year old.
The appointment, announced
bv presidential press secretary

Ronald L. Ziegler some hours
after it had become known
unofficially, is Nixon's third
effort to fill the long-vacant seat.
Ziegler told reporters the
61-year-old member of the Bth
U.S. Court of Appeals was
selected from a group of six
possibilities. The press secretary
said that in contrast to the
procedure on the two earlier
appointments the President
conferred in person with
Blackman before nominating him.
Ziegler continued:
"The President said he was
highly impressed with Judge
Blackmun's personal qualities and
that he was highly impressed
when he studied the judicial
record. He considers Judge
Blackmun to be a strict
constructionist."
Although Blackmun is a
longtime close personal friend of
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger,
Ziegler said Burger made no
recommendation for Blackmun's
appointment. But the chief justice
was consulted on the appointee's
record, Ziegler said.
The Senate Judiciary
Committee plans to start public
hearings a week after the
nomination is submitted formally
to the Senate.
If no major opposition
develops, it is likely that
committee and floor votes will
come quickly so that the court
can be restored to its normal
complement of nine justices.
Republican Senate leaders and
GOP members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee met for
about an hour Tuesday with
Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindien.it and were briefed on
the nominee selected by the
President.

But Sen. Milton R. Young of
North Dakota, one of the GOP
leaders who attended the meeting
with Kleindienst, told reporters he
sees no reason why Blackmun
should have any difficulty in
being confirmed.
Former Minnesota Sen. Hubert
H. Humphrey said Monday
Blackmun is the kind of man he
would like to have on the court.
Blackmun was reached during a
court recess of the appellate court
at St. Louis after the report of his
pending nomination was
circulated but he would not
comment beyond saying "I have
mixed emotions about it, even if
it should come."
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP)

oxygen left in the cabin of the
command ship.
A tropical storm that could
develop into a hurricane headed
toward the Apollo 13 splashdown
site in the Pacific Tuesday. A
recovery ship awaited the
astronauts' early return to earth.
Weather observers said that if
Tropical Storm Helen maintains
its present course and speed, it

should be about 200 miles
north-west of the target point by
the scheduled splashdown time
Friday.
Should the weather become a
critical factor, the spacecraft
could move its target point 200
miles up or down the mid-Pacific
recovery line in the final hours.
Mission Control said it
expected a carbon dioxide
buildup in the capsule and was
not alarmed when it appeared last
night, but the astronauts were
clearly concerned when the
warning lights flashed.
Despite its statement that it
was not concerned with the
carbon dioxide, Mission Control
responded quickly to the
astronauts' report. It ordered
them to rig up a quick, makeshift
air-cleansing device to cope with
the potential breathing hazard.
Officials were concerned
mainly with the water supply.
With 72 hours to go, based on a
Friday landing, they had enough
water for 84 hours, a margin of 1 2
hours. To keep this margin, the
astronauts must power down to
minimum electrical po'vei of 17
amperes per hour for most of the
journey, reducitn the average
hourly water consumption from
five to 2.68 pounds. The water is
used for coolin the electronics
and cabin ox i u as well as for
drinking.
Suprrmr Court
WASHINGTON (AP) - Judge
Harry A. Blackmun of Minnesota
was named Tuesday by President
Nixon to fill the much fought
over Supreme Court vacancy
which is now nearly a year old.
The appointment, announced
bv presidential press secretary

Ronald L. Ziegler some hours
after it had become known
unofficially, is Nixon's third
effort to fill the long-vacant seat.
Ziegler told reporters the
61-year-old member of the Bth
U.S. Court of Appeals was
selected from a group of six
possibilities. The press secretary
said that in contrast to the
procedure on the two earlier
appointments the President
conferred in person with
Blackman before nominating him.
Ziegler continued:
"The President said he was
highly impressed with Judge
Blackmun's personal qualities and
that he was highly impressed
when he studied the judicial
record. He considers Judge
Blackmun to be a strict
constructionist."
Although Blackmun is a
longtime close personal friend of
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger,
Ziegler said Burger made no
recommendation for Blackmun's
appointment. But the chief justice
was consulted on the appointee's
record, Ziegler said.
The Senate Judiciary
Committee plans to start public
hearings a week after the
nomination is submitted formally
to the Senate.
If no major opposition
develops, it is likely that
committee and floor votes will
come quickly so that the court
can be restored to its normal
complement of nine justices.
Republican Senate leaders and
GOP members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee met for
about an hour Tuesday with
Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindien.it and were briefed on
the nominee selected by the
President.

But Sen. Milton R. Young of
North Dakota, one of the GOP
leaders who attended the meeting
with Kleindienst, told reporters he
sees no reason why Blackmun
should have any difficulty in
being confirmed.
Former Minnesota Sen. Hubert
H. Humphrey said Monday
Blackmun is the kind of man he
would like to have on the court.
Blackmun was reached during a
court recess of the appellate court
at St. Louis after the report of his
pending nomination was
circulated but he would not
comment beyond saying "I have
mixed emotions about it, even if
it should come."
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP)
— Three American astronauts gave
their stricken spaceship a burst of
rocket power Tuesday to hurry
them home before their vital and
already short supplies of water,
oxygen and electricity run out.
The rocket burst, borrowed
from the prime engine of the little
moon lander, will bring Apollo 13
crewmen James A. Lovell Jr.,
Fred W. Haise Jr. and Jack L.
Swigert Jr. to earth 10 hours
earlier than planned.
Little more than l'/z hours
before the rocket firing, they
emerged from their only pass
behind the moon, their only
close-up view of the surface they
had hoped to explore. For almost
40 minutes, blocked from earth
by the lunar surface, they were
out of contact.
When they came out at 7:16
p.m. EST, they were on a return
course of their abbreviated
journey, heading for a splashdown
in the Pacific Ocean about 300
miles south-southeast of Samoa
on Friday at about 12:18 p.m.
EST.
The astronauts must keep their
command ship docked to
Aquarius until only minutes
before plunging into the earth's
atmosphere on Friday. Then
they'll jettison the small craft and
ride to earth breathing only the
oxygen left in the cabin of the
command ship.
