NOW'S THE TIME
TO LOOK AGAIN
We are looking for students who have ideas about their edu
cation; students who have the energy to make those ideas
work; students who realize that today's education must be
different from yesterday's.
If your liberal arts education includes theatre, the natural sci
ences, philosophy and religion, business management, history
and politics, the fine arts, literature and writing, or the social
sciences, Franconia may be for you. But only if you're ready
to become the architect of your own education.
We are small. 200 students and 25 faculty. But we all work
together to make the College go.

IBBJI—week summer program. For in-

I LAFAYETTE
Sure. I here s lots of good stereo equipment on
-K. on f he market, and the other stores have some.
And most of it is priced so they can offer the
customer a tricky "discount" and still make a full
j||| proft. (They have to, to stay in business, you
; know). We have to do the same, with other
brands of equipment that are priced that way.
Our own Lafayette equipment (top-rated by
B ® TH independent consumer testing organiza
"tfl; tions ) is just a little different. It's a little better,
,"'C for one thing. (Let us show you those independent
;||| reports).
And it's honestly priced, to give you good
value, but not fake discounts. Shop elsewhere.
•V\ Then see what good systems you can get at
I Lafa yette for the price you want to pay. Our
M VALUES are the best. That's why we think you'll
shop Lafayette last!
