VOTE FOR SHOCH-EVERS
Stanford University stands compromised today by its direct involve
ment with the United States government and that government's repres
sive policies at home and abroad. Because of this the University exists
today in direct contradiction with its own stated values of academic
freedom and scholarly neutrality.
On a purely internal level the history of the so-called Study of Edu
cation at Stanford shows conclusively that the administration of this
University it totally uncommitted to any thoroughgoing redistribution of
power and responsibilities over academic affairs among students and
faculty.
In 1966 David Harris and in 1967 Peter Lyman and Cesare Massa
renti took forthright positions against these very aspects of Stanford
University. Only a return to that form of forthright leadership can guar
antee real change at Stanford. We support JOCH SHOCH and BILL EVERS
because their past record and present commitments prove that they are
are going to raise these issues in a firm and uncompromising manner.
Only such a stance can guarantee change in the face of an unimagina
tive and educationally conservative administration.

power and responsibilities over academic affairs among students and
faculty.
In 1966 David Harris and in 1967 Peter Lyman and Cesare Massa
renti took forthright positions against these very aspects of Stanford
University. Only a return to that form of forthright leadership can guar
antee real change at Stanford. We support JOCH SHOCH and BILL EVERS
because their past record and present commitments prove that they are
are going to raise these issues in a firm and uncompromising manner.
Only such a stance can guarantee change in the face of an unimagina
tive and educationally conservative administration.

VOTE FOR SHOCH-EVERS
Stanford University stands compromised today by its direct involve
ment with the United States government and that government's repres
sive policies at home and abroad. Because of this the University exists
today in direct contradiction with its own stated values of academic
freedom and scholarly neutrality.
On a purely internal level the history of the so-called Study of Edu
cation at Stanford shows conclusively that the administration of this
University it totally uncommitted to any thoroughgoing redistribution of
power and responsibilities over academic affairs among students and
faculty.
In 1966 David Harris and in 1967 Peter Lyman and Cesare Massa
renti took forthright positions against these very aspects of Stanford
University. Only a return to that form of forthright leadership can guar
antee real change at Stanford. We support JOCH SHOCH and BILL EVERS
because their past record and present commitments prove that they are
are going to raise these issues in a firm and uncompromising manner.
