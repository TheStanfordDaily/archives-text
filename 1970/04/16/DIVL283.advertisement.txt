SINCE THE DAILY WONT TELL YOU!!
ELL Y STONE
IS HERE! DON T MISS HER!
Elly Stone is out of sight! And she's here on campus
right now preparing one of the wildest pop-rock con
certs you will ever see. Rehearsals are open to the
public, and they will blow your mind!
Elly Stone is the fabulous original star of the musical
"Jacques Brel Is Alive And Well And Living In Paris."
She set Northern California on fire last summer when
she played in the show here on campus. Her latest
record is a great emotional trip.
We asked Elly to come back for a two-week residency
to prepare and present a new concern program. She's
here! Now!
We tried to get the Daily to tell you about it earlier,
but for some reason The Daily has decided to with
hold news of this unusual event from the community.
Probably because nobody pulled his head out of the
sand long enough to think about one of the most ex
citing artistic residencies we've ever had here.
Go to the free open rehearsals any day from 2:30 to
5:30 p.m. in the Women's Clubhouse (except Tues
day at Alpha Sig house); go to her audience briefing
next Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in Tresidder.
Go to her concert on Friday or Saturday, April 24 or
25, at 8:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel.
You've never heard songs like the ones Elly Stone will
sing, and unless you've heard Elly Stone, you've miss
ed an experience of a lifetime. If you hear Elly Stone,
you'll never been the same again.
ELLY STONE
Fabulous! Unbelievable! Incredible!
