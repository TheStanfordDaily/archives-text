# Emergency Declared Following Cal Violence
## 
### 
Antiwar demonstrators,
attacking University of California
police with heavy showers of
rocks, were repulsed by tear gas
yesterday afternoon in a battle
which seesawed for hours.
As the conflict spewed onto
city streets, the campus police
called for help from Berkeley
police, and Alameda County
sheriff, and the San Francisco Tac
Squad.
University Chancellor Roger W.
Heyns declared a state of
emergency, permitting summary
suspensions on reasonable
suspicion of violations.
Circumstances made "clear the
predetermined intent of the
violence," Heyns said. "The
campus cannot and will not
accede to the settlement of issues
by force, nor tolerate the threat
violence poses to lives, porperty
and the freedom of the
university."
Arrests
Berkeley Police Chief William
Beale said there were at least 19
arrests and dozens of minor
injuries. For those arrested were
identified by police as members of
the SDS Weatherman group.
Countless windows were
broken. An arson fire did $20,000
damage to the Life Sciences
Buildings and numerous other
buildings had water damage from
fire hoses turned on by
demonstrators.

The forces of officers used
clubs, smoke bombs and repeated
barrages of tear gas to check and
scatter the repeated attacks.
After a series of struggles in
which the whole campus area was
engulfed in tear gas, most
demonstrators took to the streets,
breaking windows along Telegraph
Avenue.
Reinforcements
Other police and sheriff's
deputies reinforced the
outnumbered campus police as
chanting, screaming youths
attempted to regroup around the
Student Union building and at
other campus points. By late
afternoon, the situation settled
into a standoff, with small knots
of militants roaming the area and
with police spradically firing tear
gas to keep them off balance.
Sproul Plaza was littered with
rocks, boards, smouldering trash
and other debris. The outburst
began after a quiet rally at Sproul
Plaza, the main university
gathering point.
Ho mbardment
A crowd of about 1,000
marching on Callaghan Hall, the
campus Navy ROTC headquarters,
heavily bombarded 40 flak-vested
campus policemen with stones
and debris.
Several youths were arrested in
a 10 minute melee. A number of
reporters and photographers were
given emergency treatment for

tear gas. Television camerman Lou
Calderon of KGO, San Francisco,
suffered facial cuts when a rock
smashed his gas mask faceplate. A
freelance photographer was also
injured.
About 300 demonstrators,
throwing rocks and brick
fragments drove a half-dozen
police into nearby Wheeler Hall,
Damaged by arsonists in campus
troubles last year.
Windows Smashed
About 400 demonstrators
smashed windows in California
Hall, headquarters of Chancellor
Roger W. Heyns.
Police, braving a continuous
shower of hundreds of rocks,
drove them off with gas and
smoke bombs.
Police in repeated small
skirmishes managed to break the
militants into smaller groups,
preventing reorganization as the
gas drifted acridly across the
campus.
The severely outnumbered
officers maintained a no-man's
land just inside Sather Gate by
throwing down tear gas canisters
periodically.
Gas Routs Class
Police threw gas inside Dwinelle
Hall to rout about 200
demonstrators who had fled
inside. Classes in session inside the
hall also were routed.
The area around Sproul Hall
was cleared by a police car with a
tear gas dispenser. It was in front
of Sproul Hall that the
demonstration began quietly at
lunchtime.
Former student body president
Dan Siegel exhorted the crowd,
declaring, "We have to use
whatever force is necessary until
the war stops. The university is as
much as enemy as the military."
He has since been charged with
incitement to riot.
With Siegel crying, "Smash
university complicity, Smash
ROTC," the throng then marched
behind several Viet Cong flags,
first to University Hall, the main
universiy system office building,
and then to the ROTC
headquarters where the assault
began.
Also in the wake of yesterday's
violence, the administration
cancelled an appearance of
William Kunstler and Jerry Rubin,
scheduled for Sunday.
