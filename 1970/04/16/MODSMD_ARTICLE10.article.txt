# Guilty?
## Our Contempt Trial Begins 
### Michael Sweeney 
This morning John Shoch,
Janet Weiss, Art Busse, Lennie
Siegel and I will go on trial for
something. I'm not sure what.
We're not charged with hurting
anyone physically; nor are we
charged with destroying any
property. In fact, we aren't
charged with breaking any
criminal law whatsoever.
After reading the 12 affidavits
filed against us, I have reached the
conclusion that we are on trial for
being ourselves.
Technically, the University
claims we are in contempt of
court for violati a court
injunction which forbids
"Entering. . .any academic. .
.building. . .with the knowledge
that such conduct is disrupting
classes, meetings. . .or the conduct
«il the business of Stanford
University."
Guilty as charged. Every time
one of us enters a building on
campus, business seems to be
disrupted. It's because
administrators hate the sight of
us. Their jaws tighten and they
forget what they were doing. With
one hand they reach for a
telephone to call the police while
with the other they pull out a
copy of the Campus Policy on
Disruptions. Until now I never
thought that it was our fault that
the administrators were so
uptight. But the court seems to
disagree. According to the
injunction, the University doesn't
have to prove that we actually
took actions to disrupt, but
merely that we "had knowledge"
that our simple presence was
disruptive.
Like all political offenders,
we're being tried for what's going
on in our minds. The penalty will
be a maximum 15 days in jail and
$1500 find. We are denied a jury.
The affidavits claim that we
disrupted the functioning of the
educational machine on four
occasions.
First Crime
The first was a visit to an
ROTC class on "Command and
Staff" April 2. Fifty of us entered
the spacious classroom and sat
down The instructor, Major
Kirkland, has written an affidavit
explaining how we interfered with
his teaching: "A number of
questions concerning the nation's
policy in Viet Nam, the Presidio
trials and the alleged My Lai
massacres, which were in no way
relevant to the subject matter of
that day's class, were asked."
Apparently because of our
insistence on asking "irrelevant"
questions, Kirkland read the
Campus Policy on Disruptions. To
quiet him, all of us who did not
have a chair left. Kirkland then
continued with the class and
finished it as usual. However, he
writes, "My class was definitely
disrupted between 11:00 and
11:15 and as a result, I was not
able to complete all of the
instruction scheduled."
Second Crime
The second disruption was the
visit of 100 of us to the Academic
Council meeting April 3. We
wanted to attend this important
forum to watch the faculty make

decisions which affected the lives
of millions of Asian peasants. Art
Busse announced twice that we
did not intend to disrupt their
proceedings. We politely got up
from our seats to make room for
the arriving faculty.
Head Stanford cop Dan De
Young states in his affidavit,
however, that the meeting was
disrupted because it "was closed
to other than authorized people"
and because we were "noisy and
unruly." For example, De Young
says "1 heard Mr. Siegel ask a
question from a microphone
beginning with 'General Pitzer.'
When they read us the disruptions
policy we sang "We Shall
Overcome" and walked out. We
heard later that the faculty didn't
do anything at the meeting that
we could have disrupted anyway.
As usual.
Third Crime
The third crime was our mill-in
April 7 at the ROTC
headquarters. It was a traumatic
experience for Colonel Stanley
Ramey, nicknamed "The Hump"
by his cadets. Ramey wrote in his
affidavit about a visit to his
office: "I noticed one of the
individuals standing in the
doorway wearing one of my hats.
. .1 removed it from his head."
Ramey also reported that Lennie
Siegel "had a drum and was
wearing a coolie type hat."
(Lennie always wears that hat. He
is a Viet Cong.)
Down the hall from Ramey's
office, a freshman ROTC class was
about to begin. A movie projector
was set up, so we asked the
instructor, Captain Clint
Anderson, if we could see the
movie too.
Anderson blocked the doorway

while his cadets peered out at us
and started to rap. We proceeded
to create a disruption, according
to Anderson's affidavit, by
"shouting and taunting the cadets,
asking 'Why are you in ROTC?
'Getting a taste of Vietnam?' or
questions to that effect." Once
again, it was our questions that
the Army could not tolerate.
Like the other "disruptions,"
the mill-in ended when the
administration declared a
disruption and we all left.
Fourth Crime
The final crime was a visit to
Captain Tom Casey's class in
"Principles of War, Military
Leadership and Tactics," during
the evening of April 7. Captain
Casey initially said we could stay
in the room if we were quiet. A
black officer was lecturing on how
to maneuver tanks. We applauded
occasionally and started taping
posters on the wall that said,
"What does ROTC mean to the
Vietnamese?" with a photo of a
victim of U.S. artillery who was
missing a large portion of his
skull. Worst of all, according to
Bruce Wiggins affidavit, "Some of
the disruptive group were
throwing paper airplanes" and
"Anti-ROTC people continued to
ask questions out of order." He
read the riot act and we all left.
Will the University succeed in
sending us to jail for these heinous
crimes? Don't wait and see! Come
participate. You can join in the
workings of American justice by
attending our trial, starting at
9:30 a.m. today in department
two, North County Court
Building, 270 Grant Avenue, Palo
Alto.
When tyranny is law, revolution
is in order.

the administrators were so
uptight. But the court seems to
disagree. According to the
injunction, the University doesn't
have to prove that we actually
took actions to disrupt, but
merely that we "had knowledge"
that our simple presence was
disruptive.
Like all political offenders,
we're being tried for what's going
on in our minds. The penalty will
be a maximum 15 days in jail and
$1500 find. We are denied a jury.
The affidavits claim that we
disrupted the functioning of the
educational machine on four
occasions.
First Crime
The first was a visit to an
ROTC class on "Command and
Staff" April 2. Fifty of us entered
the spacious classroom and sat
down The instructor, Major
Kirkland, has written an affidavit
explaining how we interfered with
his teaching: "A number of
questions concerning the nation's
policy in Viet Nam, the Presidio
trials and the alleged My Lai
massacres, which were in no way
relevant to the subject matter of
that day's class, were asked."
Apparently because of our
insistence on asking "irrelevant"
questions, Kirkland read the
Campus Policy on Disruptions. To
quiet him, all of us who did not
have a chair left. Kirkland then
continued with the class and
finished it as usual. However, he
writes, "My class was definitely
disrupted between 11:00 and
11:15 and as a result, I was not
able to complete all of the
instruction scheduled."
Second Crime
The second disruption was the
visit of 100 of us to the Academic
Council meeting April 3. We
wanted to attend this important
forum to watch the faculty make

decisions which affected the lives
of millions of Asian peasants. Art
Busse announced twice that we
did not intend to disrupt their
proceedings. We politely got up
from our seats to make room for
the arriving faculty.
Head Stanford cop Dan De
Young states in his affidavit,
however, that the meeting was
disrupted because it "was closed
to other than authorized people"
and because we were "noisy and
unruly." For example, De Young
says "1 heard Mr. Siegel ask a
question from a microphone
beginning with 'General Pitzer.'
When they read us the disruptions
policy we sang "We Shall
Overcome" and walked out. We
heard later that the faculty didn't
do anything at the meeting that
we could have disrupted anyway.
As usual.
Third Crime
The third crime was our mill-in
April 7 at the ROTC
headquarters. It was a traumatic
experience for Colonel Stanley
Ramey, nicknamed "The Hump"
by his cadets. Ramey wrote in his
affidavit about a visit to his
office: "I noticed one of the
individuals standing in the
doorway wearing one of my hats.
. .1 removed it from his head."
Ramey also reported that Lennie
Siegel "had a drum and was
wearing a coolie type hat."
(Lennie always wears that hat. He
is a Viet Cong.)
Down the hall from Ramey's
office, a freshman ROTC class was
about to begin. A movie projector
was set up, so we asked the
instructor, Captain Clint
Anderson, if we could see the
movie too.
Anderson blocked the doorway

while his cadets peered out at us
and started to rap. We proceeded
to create a disruption, according
to Anderson's affidavit, by
"shouting and taunting the cadets,
asking 'Why are you in ROTC?
'Getting a taste of Vietnam?' or
questions to that effect." Once
again, it was our questions that
the Army could not tolerate.
Like the other "disruptions,"
the mill-in ended when the
administration declared a
disruption and we all left.
Fourth Crime
The final crime was a visit to
Captain Tom Casey's class in
"Principles of War, Military
Leadership and Tactics," during
the evening of April 7. Captain
Casey initially said we could stay
in the room if we were quiet. A
black officer was lecturing on how
to maneuver tanks. We applauded
occasionally and started taping
posters on the wall that said,
"What does ROTC mean to the
Vietnamese?" with a photo of a
victim of U.S. artillery who was
missing a large portion of his
skull. Worst of all, according to
Bruce Wiggins affidavit, "Some of
the disruptive group were
throwing paper airplanes" and
"Anti-ROTC people continued to
ask questions out of order." He
read the riot act and we all left.
Will the University succeed in
sending us to jail for these heinous
crimes? Don't wait and see! Come
participate. You can join in the
workings of American justice by
attending our trial, starting at
9:30 a.m. today in department
two, North County Court
Building, 270 Grant Avenue, Palo
Alto.
When tyranny is law, revolution
is in order.
This morning John Shoch,
Janet Weiss, Art Busse, Lennie
Siegel and I will go on trial for
something. I'm not sure what.
We're not charged with hurting
anyone physically; nor are we
charged with destroying any
property. In fact, we aren't
charged with breaking any
criminal law whatsoever.
After reading the 12 affidavits
filed against us, I have reached the
conclusion that we are on trial for
being ourselves.
Technically, the University
claims we are in contempt of
court for violati a court
injunction which forbids
"Entering. . .any academic. .
.building. . .with the knowledge
that such conduct is disrupting
classes, meetings. . .or the conduct
«il the business of Stanford
University."
Guilty as charged. Every time
one of us enters a building on
campus, business seems to be
disrupted. It's because
administrators hate the sight of
us. Their jaws tighten and they
forget what they were doing. With
one hand they reach for a
telephone to call the police while
with the other they pull out a
copy of the Campus Policy on
Disruptions. Until now I never
thought that it was our fault that
the administrators were so
uptight. But the court seems to
disagree. According to the
injunction, the University doesn't

quiet him, all of us who did not
have a chair left. Kirkland then
continued with the class and
finished it as usual. However, he
writes, "My class was definitely
disrupted between 11:00 and
11:15 and as a result, I was not
able to complete all of the
instruction scheduled."
Second Crime
The second disruption was the
visit of 100 of us to the Academic
Council meeting April 3. We
wanted to attend this important
forum to watch the faculty make

decisions which affected the lives
of millions of Asian peasants. Art
Busse announced twice that we
did not intend to disrupt their
proceedings. We politely got up
from our seats to make room for
the arriving faculty.
Head Stanford cop Dan De
Young states in his affidavit,
however, that the meeting was
disrupted because it "was closed
to other than authorized people"
and because we were "noisy and
unruly." For example, De Young
says "1 heard Mr. Siegel ask a
question from a microphone
beginning with 'General Pitzer.'
When they read us the disruptions
policy we sang "We Shall
Overcome" and walked out. We
heard later that the faculty didn't
do anything at the meeting that
we could have disrupted anyway.
As usual.
Third Crime
The third crime was our mill-in
April 7 at the ROTC
headquarters. It was a traumatic
experience for Colonel Stanley
Ramey, nicknamed "The Hump"
by his cadets. Ramey wrote in his
affidavit about a visit to his
office: "I noticed one of the
individuals standing in the
doorway wearing one of my hats.
. .1 removed it from his head."
Ramey also reported that Lennie
Siegel "had a drum and was
wearing a coolie type hat."
(Lennie always wears that hat. He
is a Viet Cong.)
Down the hall from Ramey's
office, a freshman ROTC class was
about to begin. A movie projector
was set up, so we asked the
instructor, Captain Clint
Anderson, if we could see the
movie too.
Anderson blocked the doorway

while his cadets peered out at us
and started to rap. We proceeded
to create a disruption, according
to Anderson's affidavit, by
"shouting and taunting the cadets,
asking 'Why are you in ROTC?
'Getting a taste of Vietnam?' or
questions to that effect." Once
again, it was our questions that
the Army could not tolerate.
Like the other "disruptions,"
the mill-in ended when the
administration declared a
disruption and we all left.
Fourth Crime
The final crime was a visit to
Captain Tom Casey's class in
"Principles of War, Military
Leadership and Tactics," during
the evening of April 7. Captain
Casey initially said we could stay
in the room if we were quiet. A
black officer was lecturing on how
to maneuver tanks. We applauded
occasionally and started taping
posters on the wall that said,
"What does ROTC mean to the
Vietnamese?" with a photo of a
victim of U.S. artillery who was
missing a large portion of his
skull. Worst of all, according to
Bruce Wiggins affidavit, "Some of
the disruptive group were
throwing paper airplanes" and
"Anti-ROTC people continued to
ask questions out of order." He
read the riot act and we all left.
Will the University succeed in
sending us to jail for these heinous
crimes? Don't wait and see! Come
participate. You can join in the
workings of American justice by
attending our trial, starting at
9:30 a.m. today in department
two, North County Court
Building, 270 Grant Avenue, Palo
Alto.
When tyranny is law, revolution
is in order.
This morning John Shoch,
Janet Weiss, Art Busse, Lennie
Siegel and I will go on trial for
something. I'm not sure what.
We're not charged with hurting
anyone physically; nor are we
charged with destroying any
property. In fact, we aren't
charged with breaking any
criminal law whatsoever.
After reading the 12 affidavits
filed against us, I have reached the
conclusion that we are on trial for
being ourselves.
Technically, the University
claims we are in contempt of
court for violati a court
injunction which forbids
"Entering. . .any academic. .
.building. . .with the knowledge
that such conduct is disrupting
classes, meetings. . .or the conduct
«il the business of Stanford
University."
Guilty as charged. Every time
one of us enters a building on
campus, business seems to be
disrupted. It's because
administrators hate the sight of
us. Their jaws tighten and they
forget what they were doing. With
one hand they reach for a
telephone to call the police while
with the other they pull out a
copy of the Campus Policy on
Disruptions. Until now I never
thought that it was our fault that
the administrators were so
uptight. But the court seems to
disagree. According to the
injunction, the University doesn't
have to prove that we actually
took actions to disrupt, but
merely that we "had knowledge"
that our simple presence was
disruptive.
Like all political offenders,
we're being tried for what's going
on in our minds. The penalty will
be a maximum 15 days in jail and
$1500 find. We are denied a jury.
The affidavits claim that we
disrupted the functioning of the
educational machine on four
occasions.
First Crime
The first was a visit to an
ROTC class on "Command and
Staff" April 2. Fifty of us entered
the spacious classroom and sat
down The instructor, Major
Kirkland, has written an affidavit
explaining how we interfered with
his teaching: "A number of
questions concerning the nation's
policy in Viet Nam, the Presidio
trials and the alleged My Lai
massacres, which were in no way
relevant to the subject matter of
that day's class, were asked."
Apparently because of our
insistence on asking "irrelevant"
questions, Kirkland read the
Campus Policy on Disruptions. To
quiet him, all of us who did not
have a chair left. Kirkland then
continued with the class and
finished it as usual. However, he
writes, "My class was definitely
disrupted between 11:00 and
