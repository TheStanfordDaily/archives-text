# The 						Dead Letter
## Dear R.M.N. 
### Neil Arnet 
Dear President Richard M. Nixon,
I just want to send you a brief
note of congratulations on the
success of the Vietnamization of
the Vietnam War. In these days of
protest I have the feeling not
many people realize the great job
you're doing. True you've had
some setbacks lately
Haynesworth, Cars well, and now
the trouble with the Apollo 13
Flight, but your war efforts
shouldn't be -slighted as a
consequence.
About two months ago my
radio awakened me with the
sound of an ABC News reporter
happily informing me that
Vietnamization was working. The
reporter's excitement grew
steadily as he described how the
South Vietnamese forces had
killed 209 Commies in 4 days of
fighting which included 53
separate encounters. Our own
forces only fought in 4
encounters. As for my own
immense excitement I can't even

describe how it escalated.
Then last week I heard that the
South Vietnamese had killed
between 500 and 600 Viet Cong
while sustaining only light losses
themselves. And all this success
had occurred in only two days
time.
Obviously we're doing a great
job of training the South
Vietnamese. In just a few short
months we've taught them how to
kill, and, more importantly, to do
it effeciently and in large
numbers. We've been able to
instill in them our own
enthusiasm for fighting their war.
We've made them want to fight
and want to kill those Viet Cong
and North Vietnamese. For all
this you deserve congratulations.
I do have one possible
suggestion, Mr. President. Perhaps
we're doing too good a job of
Vietnamization. I'm fearful that if
the South Vietnamese become too
efficient at killing their enemy
that our own men may become
jealous. After all, sir, you realize
how much pride our men take in
their ability to kill. If they discern
that the South Vietnamese troops
are doing too good a job and
showing us up, our men may insist
on staying in rather than leaving
from Vietnam. Soldiers who have
already left Vietnam, now that
their honor will be at stake, will
insist on returning. This will cause
unnecessary paperwork to keep
from overcrowding. But these
men will be adamant in their
demands. Those for whom there
isn't enough room inVietnam will
figure out ways of getting into
Cambodia and Laos.
And then, of course, there will
exist the problem of all the
college seniors and graduate
students who will not be able to
serve their country in the ways
they had been planning since
December Ist. The whole balance
of our country could be
threatened if we continue to allow
the South Vietnamese to kill their
enemy instead of us.
I just felt I should make you
aware of this possibility. Good
luck regardless of which way you
decide to kill the enemy.
In peace,
Neil Arnet

serve their country in the ways
they had been planning since
December Ist. The whole balance
of our country could be
threatened if we continue to allow
the South Vietnamese to kill their
enemy instead of us.
I just felt I should make you
aware of this possibility. Good
luck regardless of which way you
decide to kill the enemy.
In peace,

Dear President Richard M. Nixon,
I just want to send you a brief
note of congratulations on the
success of the Vietnamization of
the Vietnam War. In these days of
protest I have the feeling not
many people realize the great job
you're doing. True you've had
some setbacks lately
Haynesworth, Cars well, and now
the trouble with the Apollo 13
Flight, but your war efforts
shouldn't be -slighted as a
consequence.
About two months ago my
radio awakened me with the
sound of an ABC News reporter
happily informing me that
Vietnamization was working. The
reporter's excitement grew
steadily as he described how the
South Vietnamese forces had
killed 209 Commies in 4 days of
fighting which included 53
separate encounters. Our own
forces only fought in 4
encounters. As for my own
immense excitement I can't even

describe how it escalated.
Then last week I heard that the
South Vietnamese had killed
between 500 and 600 Viet Cong
while sustaining only light losses
themselves. And all this success
had occurred in only two days
time.
Obviously we're doing a great
job of training the South
Vietnamese. In just a few short
months we've taught them how to
kill, and, more importantly, to do
it effeciently and in large
numbers. We've been able to
instill in them our own
enthusiasm for fighting their war.
We've made them want to fight
and want to kill those Viet Cong
and North Vietnamese. For all
this you deserve congratulations.
I do have one possible
suggestion, Mr. President. Perhaps
we're doing too good a job of
Vietnamization. I'm fearful that if
the South Vietnamese become too
efficient at killing their enemy
that our own men may become
jealous. After all, sir, you realize
how much pride our men take in
their ability to kill. If they discern
that the South Vietnamese troops
are doing too good a job and
showing us up, our men may insist
on staying in rather than leaving
from Vietnam. Soldiers who have
already left Vietnam, now that
their honor will be at stake, will
insist on returning. This will cause
unnecessary paperwork to keep
from overcrowding. But these
men will be adamant in their
demands. Those for whom there
isn't enough room inVietnam will
figure out ways of getting into
Cambodia and Laos.
And then, of course, there will
exist the problem of all the
college seniors and graduate
students who will not be able to
serve their country in the ways
they had been planning since
December Ist. The whole balance
of our country could be
threatened if we continue to allow
the South Vietnamese to kill their
enemy instead of us.
