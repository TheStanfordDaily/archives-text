# 'On A Clear Day...'
## San Quentin: Life-In-Death 'Inside' 
### TOM GIVEN 
Tuesday night, I celebrated the feast of freedom in
San Quentin.
It was the Passover Seder-the ceremony
commemorating the emancipation of the Jews from
their bondage in Egypt.
The twentieth century has other slaves. They make
license plates, not temples. They live alone, not as
families.
Going through San Quentin, one wonders just how
much man has progressed in the thirty-five centuries
since Moses led the Children of Israel into a land of
freedom. "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"
remains to this day the philosophical basis of order in
society. I he concept of punishment is as firmly rooted
in California as in Caanan.
p Reality of the Wall
Amid the recent cries for peace on the campus, for
order in the University, one must confront the reality of
piison the institution society uses to enforce its rules.
As the arrests here and elsewhere mount until those
arrested are known by numbers, the good people of
the land must look hard at San Quentin, Folsom,
Leavenworth, Joliet, Sing-Sing, and the countless
prisons, jails, and farms housing society's outcasts.
Be I ore anyone on campus recommends prison
sentences, they should first see a prison. Any will do
though San Quentin is closest.
San Quentin is a model prison ; authorities from other
states wish they could offer its facilities and care. In
many ways, it is a model of an institutional form gone
wrong.
From Ship to Ccllblock
It has a long history. A century ago, a ship docked at
County headland was used to house prisoners.

—_ COMMENTARY —

The first buildings went up in the 1890's, as the physical
plant took shape.
There are approximately 3500 men in San Quentin.
They live in a number of cellblocks—from maximum
security and the famous Death Row to the closely
watched and honor blocks. Conditions are better than at
most prisons; still, in the honor blocks a man may share
a five by seven foot cell with a cellmate.
"There's no privacy at all," noted one of the inmates.
"There's no place where a man can close the door and be
alone. He's always part of the world around him."
That world bears little resemblance to reality outside
the wall. It's a world with a definite boundary—the San
Quentin News runs a column, "On a Clear Day You Can
See the Wall." It's a world with a definite vocabulary—a
con speaks of three castes, tht jjards, the cons, and the
freemen. It's a world with a definite way of life—one
that accepts homosexuality, bribery, and quick death.
"You send a man to a place that's notorious and he
lives up to it," said another con. "You hear guys talking
about things here, saying things they wouldn't ever say
on the street."
Violence and the threat of violence are endemic to
tne prison. Although prison security attempts to keep
weapons out, many inmates manage to make their own,
fashioning knives out of metal. Recently, a con was
stabbed nine times near the guard shack in the yard.
Racial rioting several months ago resulted in a number of
deaths. As one con reported, "First, they got one of
ours, then we got one of theirs . . ."
Life goes on, but haphazardly.
San Quentin offers opportunities missing in other
institutions. It is the only prison in the nation with an

accredited school system. The Bayview School has no
view of the bay no view save the wall—but it allows
many prisoners to finish their high school educations
behind the Wall. Instructors from the College of Marin
teach a few junior college courses as well.
Selt-improvement like this looks good to parole boards,
and so many cons go through the motions.
Parole Problems
Parole is a subject of much discussion. California, in
its enlightenment, gives indeterminate sentences to cons.
A man may serve five to ten, two to eight, or any other
combination of sentences. As opposed to prisoners
serving flat sentences in other states, they never know
how much longer they'll serve.
Their first opportunity of parole is almost never
granted. Standard procedure is denial; the prisoner
returning to his block for another year. Such denials,
coming after years of good behavior, increase con
bitterness. It's little encouragement for further good
behavior.
Recidivism
Such a system is not all that successful. The return
rate of San Quentin is 80 percent. Only one con in five
manages to stay clean on the streets.
Its a damning indictment at best, an outrage at
worst. It law and order are to ever prevail in America,
then the prison system cannot remain out of sight and
out of mind. As long as the prison system punishes and
iails to rehabilitate, as long as stiffer penalties are the
solutions to societal ills, as long as human needs fall
behind administrative convenience, San Quentin will be
with us.
Let those who seek to punish do so, with the
understanding of just what punishment means.
