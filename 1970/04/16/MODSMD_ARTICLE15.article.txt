# Super – Cool Accelerator May Provide Cancer Tool
## 
### DICK BUXTON 
In a lecture Tuesday night
Stanford associate professor H.
Alan Schwettman explained the
importance of research in
super-cold physics for such
developments as the design of a
superconducting proton linear
accelerator, and as a tool in cancer
treatment.
Presenting the fifth program in
the series on "Physics and Man,"
Prof. Schwettman discussed "Low
Temperature Physics—A New
Frontier" including the
reconstruction of the High Energy
Physics Laboratory's (HEPL)
billion-volt linear accelerator into
a superconducting "linac."
Following the lecture the
audience was given a tour of the
linac construction, including its
600-foot tunnel 30 feet beneath
the laboratory.
A byproduct of the project
could be the linac's use as a
"meson factory," he said, to
produce subnuclear particles
(negative pi mesons) for cancer
treatment.
The negative pi meson is an
unstable particle, and when it
finally stops its negative charge is
captured by the nucleus of an
oxygen atom, many of which are
present in cells. The result is
destruction of the cell in a "star
explosion" with particles
spreading out star-like in all
directions.
If the exploding cells belong to
a cancer tumor th<> inmnr ic

destroyed. With precise control on
energy and direction of the
penetrating mesons, doctors
possibly could deliver larger local
doses of cancer-destroying
radiation.
Low temperature physics takes
advantage of the changes in the
properties of physical systems
which occur at very low
temperatures. These temperatures
are on the absolute or Kelvin
temperature scale on which the
boiling point of water is about
370° Kelvin (K) and the melting
point of ice is about 273° K.
Physicists are using temperatures
below 4°K, which is the
temperature at which Helium gas
liquifies.
Super-Phenomena
Super-conductivity and
super-fluidity are two phenomena
which occur in metals and liquids
at low absolute temperatures and
which are aiding physicists in
many areas of their research.
Super-conductivity means that
a metal such as mercury or
niomium at some particular low
temperature (2-4°K) loses all its
resistence to the passage of an
electric current. This lack of
resistance can effectively decrease
power consumption over a million
times in the accelerating cavities
of a linear accelerator. Ten billion
watts of power consumption
(equivalent to 100 million-100
watt light bulbs) in a normal
accelerator can be reduced with

the use of super-conducting
cavaties to 1000 watts (or 10-100
watt light bulbs).
Besides these savings, the
superconducting machine would
have superior qualities to the
conventional one, said
Schwettman.
The phenomenon of
super-fluidity means that the
viscosity of a low temperature
liquid at a certain temperature is
almost zero. The liquid in this
state will flow through a ceramic
wall in much the same way that
water will pour through a window
screen.
Impossibilities
Schwettman said that research
in low temperature physics has
become increasingly important in
the last decade but that in the
early 60's physicists everywhere
except at Stanford gave up
working on developing
super-conducting accelerators
because of the difficulties
involved in the development.
"Doubting Thomases" said
Schwettman, opposed the work at
Stanford all along because of what
they saw as seemingly
insurmountable difficulties. The
sequence of problems which were
confronted at Stanford were
overcome through persistent
experimentation and research
with the result that Stanford is
now building its own, and the
first, super-conducting linear
accelerator.

a metal such as mercury or
niomium at some particular low
temperature (2-4°K) loses all its
resistence to the passage of an
electric current. This lack of
resistance can effectively decrease
power consumption over a million
times in the accelerating cavities
of a linear accelerator. Ten billion
watts of power consumption
(equivalent to 100 million-100
watt light bulbs) in a normal
accelerator can be reduced with

the use of super-conducting
cavaties to 1000 watts (or 10-100
watt light bulbs).
Besides these savings, the
superconducting machine would
have superior qualities to the
conventional one, said
Schwettman.
The phenomenon of
super-fluidity means that the
viscosity of a low temperature
liquid at a certain temperature is
almost zero. The liquid in this
state will flow through a ceramic
wall in much the same way that
water will pour through a window
screen.
Impossibilities
Schwettman said that research
in low temperature physics has
become increasingly important in
the last decade but that in the
early 60's physicists everywhere
except at Stanford gave up
working on developing
super-conducting accelerators
because of the difficulties
involved in the development.
"Doubting Thomases" said
Schwettman, opposed the work at
Stanford all along because of what
they saw as seemingly
insurmountable difficulties. The
sequence of problems which were
confronted at Stanford were
overcome through persistent
experimentation and research
with the result that Stanford is
now building its own, and the
first, super-conducting linear
accelerator.

In a lecture Tuesday night
Stanford associate professor H.
Alan Schwettman explained the
importance of research in
super-cold physics for such
developments as the design of a
superconducting proton linear
accelerator, and as a tool in cancer
treatment.
Presenting the fifth program in
the series on "Physics and Man,"
Prof. Schwettman discussed "Low
Temperature Physics—A New
Frontier" including the
reconstruction of the High Energy
Physics Laboratory's (HEPL)
billion-volt linear accelerator into
a superconducting "linac."
Following the lecture the
audience was given a tour of the
linac construction, including its
600-foot tunnel 30 feet beneath
the laboratory.
A byproduct of the project
could be the linac's use as a
"meson factory," he said, to
produce subnuclear particles
(negative pi mesons) for cancer
treatment.
The negative pi meson is an
unstable particle, and when it
finally stops its negative charge is
captured by the nucleus of an
oxygen atom, many of which are
present in cells. The result is
destruction of the cell in a "star
explosion" with particles
spreading out star-like in all
directions.
If the exploding cells belong to
a cancer tumor th<> inmnr ic

destroyed. With precise control on
energy and direction of the
penetrating mesons, doctors
possibly could deliver larger local
doses of cancer-destroying
radiation.
Low temperature physics takes
advantage of the changes in the
properties of physical systems
which occur at very low
temperatures. These temperatures
are on the absolute or Kelvin
temperature scale on which the
boiling point of water is about
370° Kelvin (K) and the melting
point of ice is about 273° K.
Physicists are using temperatures
below 4°K, which is the
temperature at which Helium gas
liquifies.
Super-Phenomena
Super-conductivity and
super-fluidity are two phenomena
which occur in metals and liquids
at low absolute temperatures and
which are aiding physicists in
many areas of their research.
