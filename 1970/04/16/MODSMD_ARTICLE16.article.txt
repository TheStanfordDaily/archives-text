## 
### 
The anti-ROTC fast in front of
President Pitzer's office dispersed
this morning as some of the
protestors took up new positions
on the grass in the middle of
White Plaza.
Members of the "Z" affinity
group apparently spent the night
outside the office, but abandoned
the post to move to White Plaza
yesterday morning.
About 15 students lounged on
the grass, talked, , and played
musical instruments yesterday
afternoon to protest the presence
of ROTC on campus and to urge
other students to cast votes
against ROTC in the ASSU
referendum. Most of the
protestors said that they would
fast for two or three days.
Today, members of the
Movement plan to attend a
show-cause hearing at the North
County Building, Palo Alto, where
three well-known members of the
group face charges of contempt of
court for violating a preliminary
injunction issued last May.
During the noon recess, the
group plans to travel by train to
the Dillingham Corporation's
offices in San Francisco to smash
a model of the Dillingham Project
slated to be built on Stanford land
in the near future.
Five persons—Lennie Siegel,
Michael Sweeney, Janet Weiss, Art
Busse and John Shoch—were
originally ordered to appear at the
hearing, but officials have been
unable to serve the necessary
papers on Busse and Shoch.
At a Movement coordinating
committee meeting Tuesday
night, two meetings were
scheduled for later this week.
At 7:45 a.m. Saturday,

front of the armory across from

the ROTC building to accompany
Army ROTC cadets on their
monthly exercises in the
foothills.
Also scheduled was a mass
meeting for 7:30 p.m. Sunday in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
purpose of the meeting will be to
discuss the results of the ROTC
referendum and future activities
of the Movement.
Affinity groups will also meet
before the Sunday night gathering
to discuss individual proposals for
action so that these can be
considered at the meeting.
