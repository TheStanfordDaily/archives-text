# 'Oldies But Goodies' Spark Ballet Season
## 
### 
For the past few years, the San
Francisco Ballet has been the
most well-known group of
vagabonds in the dance world.
Homeless, but not without
determination, talent, and Lew
Christensen's commendable
leadership, these gypsies proved
they are the Bay Area's premier
dance company at the recent
Spring opening. That they are
performing a complete repertoire
at all is astounding since their
arrangement with the Opera
House is on something resembling
an hour-by-hour basis. Despite the
home-front problems, the opening
was stunning.
Christensen chose two of his
"oldies but goodies," "Symphony
in D," and long-time favorite,
"Beauty and the "Beast."
"Symphony" is an abstract ballet,
a visual articulation of Cherubini's
score executed in front of a
simple, geometric setting. Groups
of dancers develop a variety of
schemes corresponding to each of
the Symphony's four movements.

The opening ensemble seemed
a little ragged at first but the
impression changed quickly
enough and by the time Christine
Bennett and Philippe Arrona
performed, it was clear that the
group was off to an auspicious
start. Arrona was especially
strong, he handled his partner well
and his lifts were accomplished
with sureness and authority.
The ensemble work, after the
early moments, found its measure
and remained excellent,
culminating in the tth movement
Allegro featuring the entire cast.
Christensen made them fill the
stage and full space was used
consistently in both ballets. In
"Symphony," he demonstrated
the full depth of his personnel,
displayed in a neat, crisp,
economical bundle.
'Beauty' Breath taking
That bundle burst wide-open
in "Beauty and the Beast," a
stupendous production! This four
act dance-romance uses music by
Tschaikowsky and, presumably,
deals with the theme that beauty
AND beastliness is only skin deep.
Seldom has the music and
choreography of a major dramatic
ballet been matched with such
visual excitement as that of Tony
Duquette's sets and costumes.
From th# painted drop-curtain to
the final Grande Polonaise,
"Beauty" is breathtaking.
Outstanding performances
were numerous: Leo Ahonen as

the Marmoset showed some
exceptional moves, poised and
powerful in his entrechats, the
"Magic Flowers" led by Christine
Bennett were perfectly fragile,
and Sandra Adamson and Victoria
Gyorfi as Beauty's "nosey"
jealous sisters were perfectly
un-charming. Bruce Bain and
guest artist Matti Tikkanen split
the role of the Beast/Prince,
Tikkanen coming up with the
meat of the part; a moving
transformation scene from beast
to man that stopped the show and
the classic pas de deux with Linda
Meyer as Beauty. This was a most
effective partnering resulting in
spectacular performances by both
dancers. During his variation,
Tikkanen must have explored
every foot of stage space in a
sparkling virtuoso effort.
Somewhere along the way, the
characterization, the theme of
humanizing love was put in the
corner and Mr. Bain's mime and
move as the Beast in Act I was
much more evocative of human
sorrow and anguish than Mr.
Tikkanen's characterization of the
Prince. I found it curious that the
role should have been divided for
while it may enhance the diversity
of the ballet, the theme is
ruptured.
Near Over-Production
"Beauty and the Beast" looks
like a very busy work, the settings
and costume colors are not quite
garish, not too over-blown and I
sense the final result comes up
just short of being over-produced.
It is unnerving to think that
"Symphony in D" winds up
looking like a bloodless
curtain-raiser. The two works are
polar to each other but the
overwhelming spectacle of
"Beauty" is difficult to shake.
In any case, things are cooking
at the San Francisco Ballet and I
urge you to pay them a visit.
Performances are scheduled for
Saturday evenings and Sunday
matinees April 25 and 26, May 2
and 3, and 17 and 18. Future
performances will include Filling
Station, Fantasma and Carlos
Carvajal's new Genesis '70. Lew
Christensen is presently working
on a major new ballet to be
premiered on May 16. Student
discounts are available for all
performances. They'll give you a
good evening.

Bennett and Philippe Arrona
performed, it was clear that the
group was off to an auspicious
start. Arrona was especially
strong, he handled his partner well
and his lifts were accomplished
with sureness and authority.
The ensemble work, after the
early moments, found its measure
and remained excellent,
culminating in the tth movement
Allegro featuring the entire cast.
Christensen made them fill the
stage and full space was used
consistently in both ballets. In
"Symphony," he demonstrated
the full depth of his personnel,
displayed in a neat, crisp,
economical bundle.
'Beauty' Breath taking
That bundle burst wide-open
in "Beauty and the Beast," a
stupendous production! This four
act dance-romance uses music by
Tschaikowsky and, presumably,
deals with the theme that beauty
AND beastliness is only skin deep.
Seldom has the music and
choreography of a major dramatic
ballet been matched with such
visual excitement as that of Tony
Duquette's sets and costumes.
From th# painted drop-curtain to
the final Grande Polonaise,
"Beauty" is breathtaking.
Outstanding performances
were numerous: Leo Ahonen as

the Marmoset showed some
exceptional moves, poised and
powerful in his entrechats, the
"Magic Flowers" led by Christine
Bennett were perfectly fragile,
and Sandra Adamson and Victoria
Gyorfi as Beauty's "nosey"
jealous sisters were perfectly
un-charming. Bruce Bain and
guest artist Matti Tikkanen split
the role of the Beast/Prince,
Tikkanen coming up with the
meat of the part; a moving
transformation scene from beast
to man that stopped the show and
the classic pas de deux with Linda
Meyer as Beauty. This was a most
effective partnering resulting in
spectacular performances by both
dancers. During his variation,
Tikkanen must have explored
every foot of stage space in a
sparkling virtuoso effort.
Somewhere along the way, the
characterization, the theme of
humanizing love was put in the
corner and Mr. Bain's mime and
move as the Beast in Act I was
much more evocative of human
sorrow and anguish than Mr.
Tikkanen's characterization of the
Prince. I found it curious that the
role should have been divided for
while it may enhance the diversity
of the ballet, the theme is
ruptured.
Near Over-Production
"Beauty and the Beast" looks
like a very busy work, the settings
and costume colors are not quite
garish, not too over-blown and I
sense the final result comes up
just short of being over-produced.
It is unnerving to think that
"Symphony in D" winds up
looking like a bloodless
curtain-raiser. The two works are
polar to each other but the
overwhelming spectacle of
"Beauty" is difficult to shake.
In any case, things are cooking
at the San Francisco Ballet and I
urge you to pay them a visit.
Performances are scheduled for
Saturday evenings and Sunday
matinees April 25 and 26, May 2
and 3, and 17 and 18. Future
performances will include Filling
Station, Fantasma and Carlos
Carvajal's new Genesis '70. Lew
Christensen is presently working
on a major new ballet to be
premiered on May 16. Student
discounts are available for all
performances. They'll give you a
good evening.
For the past few years, the San
Francisco Ballet has been the
most well-known group of
vagabonds in the dance world.
Homeless, but not without
determination, talent, and Lew
Christensen's commendable
leadership, these gypsies proved
they are the Bay Area's premier
dance company at the recent
Spring opening. That they are
performing a complete repertoire
at all is astounding since their
arrangement with the Opera
House is on something resembling
an hour-by-hour basis. Despite the
home-front problems, the opening
was stunning.
Christensen chose two of his
"oldies but goodies," "Symphony
in D," and long-time favorite,
"Beauty and the "Beast."
"Symphony" is an abstract ballet,
a visual articulation of Cherubini's
score executed in front of a
simple, geometric setting. Groups
of dancers develop a variety of
schemes corresponding to each of
the Symphony's four movements.

The opening ensemble seemed
a little ragged at first but the
impression changed quickly
enough and by the time Christine
Bennett and Philippe Arrona
performed, it was clear that the
group was off to an auspicious
start. Arrona was especially
strong, he handled his partner well
and his lifts were accomplished
