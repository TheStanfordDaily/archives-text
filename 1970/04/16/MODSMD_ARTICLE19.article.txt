# The 						Reel World
## Brasilian Parable Here 
### DRANRE BAREVIR 
"The Given Word," written
and directed by Anselmo Duarte,
one of the leading directors of the
Brasilian "Cinema nuvo," received
the Golden Palm Award for the
best film at the Cannes
International Film Festival in
1962, and the Best Film Award at
the San Francisco International
Festival in 1962. It is not a film to
be analyzed, but rather a film to
be accepted as a parable.
The first shots dissolving
between each other show a man,
Ze, carrying a heavy crucifix
across countrysides of mud and
rain, cracked earth, sun dust, wind
and dead shrubs. The crowds are
choirs singing God's glory and give
the film an epical opening which
announces the final martyr of Ze.
Ze has been carrying his cross for
thirty miles, but Duarte only uses
the shots picturing his expedition
to superimpose the credits.
Making Ze's calvary an
important part of the film would
have given to him a stature of
hero, but Ze is not a hero. Neither
is he the "New Christ" that the
press—in the film—make him out
to be.
Ze is a poor farmer as pu,re,
simple and rough as the first
apostles.
One Duarte's genius could
create such a character. Ze is
purposely a diminutive name
given to the simple minded. Ze
does not have the happy and
careless accent, open and almost
spanish, which the people of
Brazil have. Ze's language is
rough, firm, simple,
unsophisticated, closed-mouthed,
almost muffled and as penitent as
the original portuguese.
Duarte marvelously uses all the
resources of this language of
peasants and fishermen who live
in a world that they regard as the
Lord's more than as Man's.
At night, when Ze comes into
town carrying his cross, the
women of the thresholds wonder:
"What kind of an act is that?". In
effect, Ze comes from a different
world and his entrance in the
society makes his tragic and
inevitable. Ze wants to place his
crucifix on the cathedral altar in
fulfillment of a promise he gave
for the miraculous saving of the
life of his donkey—Nicholas. In
one of the most beautiful
moments of the film, Ze, filled

with wonder, tells the priest his
story as they go up the stairs
leading to the cathedral porch.
He is refused entry to the
church after the priest learns that
he made his promise during a
pagan ceremony. Ze,
uncomprehending, is determined
to keep his "Given word." The
donkey, the most humble animal
and Ze, the ridiculous peasant,
become one identical symbol of a
christian life of purity and
simplicity as well as a life of
suffering, penitence and faith
which is made human by living it
under God.
Ze believes in "Santa Barbara"
as a child does: "A promise is a
promise, it's like a business deal"
or "The Saint will understand."
Yes, the Saint will understand but
the society won't. Is he mad, a
mystic, an agitator? Nobody
understands him, neither the
pimp, the poet, the bartenant, the
priest, the church hierarchy, the
voodoo people, the journalists,
the police, nor the crowd.
Ze stays on the stairs of the
church, waiting, hoping and the
"vultures" gather around him to
exploit his misery. He is shot in
the middle of a rioting crowd.
Nobody, neither the people there,
nor the audience, knows who
killed him.

Each one of us is responsible
He finally enters the church, dead,
on the cross.
