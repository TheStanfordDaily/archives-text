# Cadet Morale High Despite Protests
## 
### JESSE CEDARBAUM 
How does the movement to
oust ROTC look to the cadets
themselves?
Most of the ROTC cadets
disagree with both the aims and
the tactics of anti-ROTC
protestors. Their assessments of
the group, and its actions during
the last two weeks ranged from
"asinine" to "hypocritical" to
"though I don't agree with their
goals, if I were in (the movement
leaders) position, rock-throwing
would seem to be the most
effective means."
Recent events have caused
some cadets to question their
participation in ROTC.
"It's making us think about
our position . . . Can we stay in
and still maintain our pride?"
volunteered one.
Others are not affected much.
"There hasn't been much effect,"
commented one student. "The
protest comes from such a small
segment (of the university)."
According to Col. Stanley
Ramey, head of Army ROTC,
only one student has approached
him about leaving the program.
Howver, the student had been
considering such action for some
time, Ramey said.
Cadets interviewed gave two
major reasons for enrolling in the
program.

Some are involved because of
the scholarships that are available
to them; others are looking
forward to postponement of their
military obligations until after
graduate school.
A few feel that they have an
obligation to serve their country,
and would rather serve as an
officer in the service of their
choice rather than as an
infantryman.
Assessment of long-range
effects of the off-ROTC
movement were varied. According
to Col. Robert Thomas, chairman
of Navy ROTC, a decision to
arbitrarily deny credit to ROTC
courses would probably force the
Navy to halt the program.
Ramey, on the other hand,
stated that the Army would keep
its program going. The Army
wants ROTC to remain at
Stanford, he explained, "because
Stanford produces some of the
Army's best officers." They
nearly always finish number one
in the training programs they
undergo after graduation, he said.
At least one cadet believes that
some positive good could come
out of the demonstrations. ROTC
could stand some revision, he
remarked. "Perhaps the
demonstrations could result in
some improvement of the
program—if ROTC is allowed to
stay," he said.

Assessment of long-range
effects of the off-ROTC
movement were varied. According
to Col. Robert Thomas, chairman
of Navy ROTC, a decision to
arbitrarily deny credit to ROTC
courses would probably force the
Navy to halt the program.
Ramey, on the other hand,
stated that the Army would keep
its program going. The Army
wants ROTC to remain at
Stanford, he explained, "because
Stanford produces some of the
Army's best officers." They
nearly always finish number one
in the training programs they
undergo after graduation, he said.
At least one cadet believes that
some positive good could come
out of the demonstrations. ROTC
could stand some revision, he
remarked. "Perhaps the
demonstrations could result in
some improvement of the
program—if ROTC is allowed to
stay," he said.
