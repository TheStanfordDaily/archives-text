# Doubled Up
## Duplicate's Different Goals 
### Marshall Schwartz 
The bidding:
SOUTH WEST NORTH EAST
INT pass 2NT pass

Opening Lead: Heart 4 Vul: Both
Duplicate bridge is made up of
many different animals. Match
points, international match
points, and board-a-match all
require different attitudes—when
to play safe, when to gamble,
when to risk the fate of the
contract for a mere overtrick or
two. Today's hand, from the
■ Master's Pairs at the Spring
Nationals in Portland last month,
is a good illustration.
Playing weak no-trumps
(11-14 points), South opened
! INT and North, with 11 points
j and a good five-card suit, invited
j to game, South declining.

The attitude declarer takes
when he sees dummy depends on
what version of duplicate he is
playing. With the heart lead, he
has eight sure tricks—five
diamonds and three hearts—and
his contract. If he is playing
rubber bridge or a duplicate team
game scored by international
match points, he will take his
eight tricks and run for cover.
In these two scoring systems,
making your contract is of
primary importance and
overtricks are worth bothering
with only after the contract is
home. With the club suit wide
open, it is highly dangerous to try
to bring in a spade trick before
cashing out.
Match point duplicate is
another story, however. Here, you
get one point for every other pair
your way you do better than, and
a half-point for every one you tie.
So making your contract isn't
worth very much if everyone else
is in another contract getting a
better score.
When dummy comes down,
declarer can see he is in a contract
few other players will reach. Most
Souths will open one diamond,
North will raise to three—and that
is where they will play. They will
make four, for 130 points. The

no-trump is only worth 120, so
declarer must make an overtrick,
f0r.150 points.
Noting that West couldn't find
the killing club lead the first time,
declarer can see there won't be
too much of a problem if West
holds the spade ace and takes the
first trick in that suit. The
problem is if East holds that key
card. He will very likely switch to
a club if he wins the spade, and
therefore declarer's task must be
to convince him not to take it on
the first round, if he holds it.
Therefore, the proper play is
for South to play the heart ten
from dummy on the first trick,
which wins. Now he must lead a
LOW spade off board. Unless East
is a top-flight player and suspects
what is going on, he will hold off
the first round and now declarer is
home.
He takes the spade in hand and
then runs his other eight
tricks—making three.
As it turned out, this play was
vital. In one section, one declarer
ran for cover with his eight
tricks—and got a fat bottom zero
matchpoints, for his efforts. A
score of plus 150, however, was
worth 8 points out of 12. Even if
East had risen to the occasion and
the defense had cashed six tricks,
setting declarer, it couldn't have
produced a worse result. A
bottom by any name is still a
zero.

his contract. If he is playing
rubber bridge or a duplicate team
game scored by international
match points, he will take his
eight tricks and run for cover.
In these two scoring systems,
making your contract is of
primary importance and
overtricks are worth bothering
with only after the contract is
home. With the club suit wide
open, it is highly dangerous to try
to bring in a spade trick before
cashing out.
Match point duplicate is
another story, however. Here, you
get one point for every other pair
your way you do better than, and
a half-point for every one you tie.
So making your contract isn't
worth very much if everyone else
is in another contract getting a
better score.
When dummy comes down,
declarer can see he is in a contract
few other players will reach. Most
Souths will open one diamond,
North will raise to three—and that
is where they will play. They will
make four, for 130 points. The

no-trump is only worth 120, so
declarer must make an overtrick,
f0r.150 points.
Noting that West couldn't find
the killing club lead the first time,
declarer can see there won't be
too much of a problem if West
holds the spade ace and takes the
first trick in that suit. The
problem is if East holds that key
card. He will very likely switch to
a club if he wins the spade, and
therefore declarer's task must be
to convince him not to take it on
the first round, if he holds it.
Therefore, the proper play is
for South to play the heart ten
from dummy on the first trick,
which wins. Now he must lead a
LOW spade off board. Unless East
is a top-flight player and suspects
what is going on, he will hold off
the first round and now declarer is
home.
He takes the spade in hand and
then runs his other eight
tricks—making three.
As it turned out, this play was
vital. In one section, one declarer
ran for cover with his eight
tricks—and got a fat bottom zero
matchpoints, for his efforts. A
score of plus 150, however, was
worth 8 points out of 12. Even if
East had risen to the occasion and
the defense had cashed six tricks,
setting declarer, it couldn't have
produced a worse result. A
bottom by any name is still a
zero.

Duplicate bridge is made up of
many different animals. Match
points, international match
points, and board-a-match all
require different attitudes—when
to play safe, when to gamble,
when to risk the fate of the
contract for a mere overtrick or
two. Today's hand, from the
■ Master's Pairs at the Spring
Nationals in Portland last month,
is a good illustration.
Playing weak no-trumps
(11-14 points), South opened
! INT and North, with 11 points
j and a good five-card suit, invited
j to game, South declining.

The attitude declarer takes
when he sees dummy depends on
what version of duplicate he is
playing. With the heart lead, he
has eight sure tricks—five
diamonds and three hearts—and
his contract. If he is playing
rubber bridge or a duplicate team
game scored by international
match points, he will take his
eight tricks and run for cover.
