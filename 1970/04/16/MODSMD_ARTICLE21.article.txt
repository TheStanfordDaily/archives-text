# Recruit Harvest-A Spring Rite
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
On that fall day late last November when
Stanford squeaked by Cal 29-28 in the Big Game,
Stanford football was over in the mind of most
people for the next nine months. But the end of
the playing season for John Ralston and his
assistants marked the start of a crucial part of any
football program: the recruiting season.
For the next few months Ralston and his staff
would work on trying to convince blue chip high
school and junior college prospects that Stanford
would be "their kind of school." As the recruiting
season opened, coaches and recruiters from all
over the nation swooped down on the prospective
athlete to try and convince them that their school
offered the best football, "employment"
opportunities, parties, girls, alumni funds and
maybe even the test academic program.
The season now culminates in the spring with
letter -of-intent announcements as each school
flourishes the list of prospects it has lured.
The J C M arkel
Naturally, Ralston was after junior college
transfers who can step in and help this coming
season in nailing down the Rose Bowl berth which
so miraculously eluded Stanford last fall. Although
the Indians will have a nucleus of thirty-four
lettermen returning, question marks remain on
both offense and defense due to the loss of such
defensive stalwarts as linebackers Don Parish and
Pat Preston and backs Rich Keller and Dick Oliver;
'offensive linemen Pete Seymour, George Crooks,
Bob Reinhard and Dave Sharp, and running backs
Howie Williams and Bubba Brown.
At this point at least six good junior college
transfers have been lined up for next season. They
include two defensive backs, a linebacker, a
running back and two linemen.
The two defensive backs are Tim Robnett from
Bakersfield JC and Ben Barnes from Contra Costa
JC. Robnett goes at 5-11, 185 and played two
seasons at Bakersfield. He is tabbed as having good
speed and being exceptionally quick. Barnes, 6-1,
195, also had two years experience in junior
college. While he was at CCJC he ran back four
interceptions for touchdowns including one for 96
yards. Besides being the team's leading tackier, he
also saw action as an offensive receiver.
Next come the two linemen, Roger Cowan and
Larry Jones. Cowan is a 6-3, 230 pound defensive
tackle from Santa Monica Junior College. He
worked out with the Indians last fall but came
down with mononucleosis and was forced to leave
school. Jones is a 6-1, 231 pound offensive tackle
from Pasadena JC.
The final two transfers are linebacker Mike

Simone and running back Vic Lamanuzzi. The
5-1 1, 195 pound Simone was a two year ietterman
at Golden West Junior College. He has run a 4.7 40
yard dash and has been compared to Pat Preston.
Lamanuzzi averaged 5.6 yards per carry during his
career at Fresno City College.
Although these six and maybe a couple more
will help out next year, Stanford's academic
standards are too high and financial assistance
funds too low to make a giant USC style JC
recruiting system possible. As far as other Pac-8
schools go, Cal seems to have had the most success
at getting signed letters of intent. The Bears
already have letters of intent from 16 junior
college players including four All-State performers
and eight offensive linemen.
Since USC seldomly has its junior college
transfers bother to sign letters of intent, their
recruiting success is hard to measure right now but
they have at least three talented transfers,
including two JC All-Americans.
Although Stanford needs JC help to further

Rose Bowl ambitions immediately, it also has to
look ahead to the future and try to get the high
school stars also. And it looks as though the
Indians have a couple of prize catches already.
Among the greenhorns who can look forward
to "membership in the Stanford community" next
fall is John Winesberry, one of the most sought
after running backs of the year. Winesberry is a
6-0, 185 pound performer from Washington High
School in Tulsa Oklahoma, which won the state
football championship the three years he was
there. In last year's title game he was the leading
rusher and scored three touchdowns on an HO yard
kickoff return, a 40 yard pass reception and a 60
yard interception return. He has run a 9.6 100 and
has been likened to some unknown by the name of
Gale Sayers.
Winesberry carried a 3.2 g.p.a. in high school
and has plans to go on to law school. Reportedly
he made up his mind about Stanford partly
because of the law school. Ralston has called
Winesberry the finest prospect he has had in his
career here. Instrumental in convincing Wi.iesberry
was head frosh coach Bill Moultrie who will have
the pleasure of using him right off next season.
California Phenoms
Set to join Winesberry in late September for
unpacking, pre-reg and the opening of frosh
football is another fine running back, James
Ferguson. Ferguson, a 6-1, 180 pound back from
Kennedy High School in Richmond California, was
a member of the North Shrine football team this
season and has run the 100 in 9.9. Another good
prospect is Reggie lshman from Compton High
School in Compton, who was a third team All-CIF
split end. He is also reportedly a speedy low
hurdler.
One of a number who has yet to make up his
mind about Stanford is Lynn Swann, from Serra
High in San Mateo, considered one of the best
all-around athletes anywhere this past year. Swann
is a former teammate of Jess Freitas, who is
scheduled to play again after sitting out last year's
frosh season with mononucleosis.
As a junior, Swann made the all-Northern
California football team at offensive end, then
moved to quarterback following Frietas'
graduation and was named Northern California
Player of the Year for the past season. He was also
all-league in basketball and is an outstanding
hurdler and long jumper, -and will probably be
used as a wide receiver wherever he goes to college.
Swann has narrowed his choices down to USC and
Stanford, but has said he won't make a decision
until watching spring drills at both schools.

so miraculously eluded Stanford last fall. Although
the Indians will have a nucleus of thirty-four
lettermen returning, question marks remain on
both offense and defense due to the loss of such
defensive stalwarts as linebackers Don Parish and
Pat Preston and backs Rich Keller and Dick Oliver;
'offensive linemen Pete Seymour, George Crooks,
Bob Reinhard and Dave Sharp, and running backs
Howie Williams and Bubba Brown.
At this point at least six good junior college
transfers have been lined up for next season. They
include two defensive backs, a linebacker, a
running back and two linemen.
The two defensive backs are Tim Robnett from
Bakersfield JC and Ben Barnes from Contra Costa
JC. Robnett goes at 5-11, 185 and played two
seasons at Bakersfield. He is tabbed as having good
speed and being exceptionally quick. Barnes, 6-1,
195, also had two years experience in junior
college. While he was at CCJC he ran back four
interceptions for touchdowns including one for 96
yards. Besides being the team's leading tackier, he
also saw action as an offensive receiver.
Next come the two linemen, Roger Cowan and
Larry Jones. Cowan is a 6-3, 230 pound defensive
tackle from Santa Monica Junior College. He
worked out with the Indians last fall but came
down with mononucleosis and was forced to leave
school. Jones is a 6-1, 231 pound offensive tackle
from Pasadena JC.
The final two transfers are linebacker Mike

Simone and running back Vic Lamanuzzi. The
5-1 1, 195 pound Simone was a two year ietterman
at Golden West Junior College. He has run a 4.7 40
yard dash and has been compared to Pat Preston.
Lamanuzzi averaged 5.6 yards per carry during his
career at Fresno City College.
Although these six and maybe a couple more
will help out next year, Stanford's academic
standards are too high and financial assistance
funds too low to make a giant USC style JC
recruiting system possible. As far as other Pac-8
schools go, Cal seems to have had the most success
at getting signed letters of intent. The Bears
already have letters of intent from 16 junior
college players including four All-State performers
and eight offensive linemen.
Since USC seldomly has its junior college
transfers bother to sign letters of intent, their
recruiting success is hard to measure right now but
they have at least three talented transfers,
including two JC All-Americans.
Although Stanford needs JC help to further

Rose Bowl ambitions immediately, it also has to
look ahead to the future and try to get the high
school stars also. And it looks as though the
Indians have a couple of prize catches already.
Among the greenhorns who can look forward
to "membership in the Stanford community" next
fall is John Winesberry, one of the most sought
after running backs of the year. Winesberry is a
6-0, 185 pound performer from Washington High
School in Tulsa Oklahoma, which won the state
football championship the three years he was
there. In last year's title game he was the leading
rusher and scored three touchdowns on an HO yard
kickoff return, a 40 yard pass reception and a 60
yard interception return. He has run a 9.6 100 and
has been likened to some unknown by the name of
Gale Sayers.
Winesberry carried a 3.2 g.p.a. in high school
and has plans to go on to law school. Reportedly
he made up his mind about Stanford partly
because of the law school. Ralston has called
Winesberry the finest prospect he has had in his
career here. Instrumental in convincing Wi.iesberry
was head frosh coach Bill Moultrie who will have
the pleasure of using him right off next season.
California Phenoms
Set to join Winesberry in late September for
unpacking, pre-reg and the opening of frosh
football is another fine running back, James
Ferguson. Ferguson, a 6-1, 180 pound back from
Kennedy High School in Richmond California, was
a member of the North Shrine football team this
season and has run the 100 in 9.9. Another good
prospect is Reggie lshman from Compton High
School in Compton, who was a third team All-CIF
split end. He is also reportedly a speedy low
hurdler.
One of a number who has yet to make up his
mind about Stanford is Lynn Swann, from Serra
High in San Mateo, considered one of the best
all-around athletes anywhere this past year. Swann
is a former teammate of Jess Freitas, who is
scheduled to play again after sitting out last year's
frosh season with mononucleosis.
As a junior, Swann made the all-Northern
California football team at offensive end, then
moved to quarterback following Frietas'
graduation and was named Northern California
Player of the Year for the past season. He was also
all-league in basketball and is an outstanding
hurdler and long jumper, -and will probably be
used as a wide receiver wherever he goes to college.
Swann has narrowed his choices down to USC and
Stanford, but has said he won't make a decision
until watching spring drills at both schools.

On that fall day late last November when
Stanford squeaked by Cal 29-28 in the Big Game,
Stanford football was over in the mind of most
people for the next nine months. But the end of
the playing season for John Ralston and his
assistants marked the start of a crucial part of any
football program: the recruiting season.
For the next few months Ralston and his staff
would work on trying to convince blue chip high
school and junior college prospects that Stanford
would be "their kind of school." As the recruiting
season opened, coaches and recruiters from all
over the nation swooped down on the prospective
athlete to try and convince them that their school
offered the best football, "employment"
opportunities, parties, girls, alumni funds and
maybe even the test academic program.
The season now culminates in the spring with
letter -of-intent announcements as each school
flourishes the list of prospects it has lured.

also saw action as an offensive receiver.
Next come the two linemen, Roger Cowan and
Larry Jones. Cowan is a 6-3, 230 pound defensive
tackle from Santa Monica Junior College. He
worked out with the Indians last fall but came
down with mononucleosis and was forced to leave
school. Jones is a 6-1, 231 pound offensive tackle
from Pasadena JC.
The final two transfers are linebacker Mike

Simone and running back Vic Lamanuzzi. The
5-1 1, 195 pound Simone was a two year ietterman
at Golden West Junior College. He has run a 4.7 40
yard dash and has been compared to Pat Preston.
Lamanuzzi averaged 5.6 yards per carry during his
career at Fresno City College.
Although these six and maybe a couple more
will help out next year, Stanford's academic
standards are too high and financial assistance
funds too low to make a giant USC style JC
recruiting system possible. As far as other Pac-8
schools go, Cal seems to have had the most success
at getting signed letters of intent. The Bears
already have letters of intent from 16 junior
college players including four All-State performers
and eight offensive linemen.
Since USC seldomly has its junior college
transfers bother to sign letters of intent, their
recruiting success is hard to measure right now but
they have at least three talented transfers,
including two JC All-Americans.
Although Stanford needs JC help to further

Rose Bowl ambitions immediately, it also has to
look ahead to the future and try to get the high
school stars also. And it looks as though the
Indians have a couple of prize catches already.
Among the greenhorns who can look forward
to "membership in the Stanford community" next
fall is John Winesberry, one of the most sought
after running backs of the year. Winesberry is a
6-0, 185 pound performer from Washington High
School in Tulsa Oklahoma, which won the state
football championship the three years he was
there. In last year's title game he was the leading
rusher and scored three touchdowns on an HO yard
kickoff return, a 40 yard pass reception and a 60
yard interception return. He has run a 9.6 100 and
has been likened to some unknown by the name of
Gale Sayers.
Winesberry carried a 3.2 g.p.a. in high school
and has plans to go on to law school. Reportedly
he made up his mind about Stanford partly
because of the law school. Ralston has called
Winesberry the finest prospect he has had in his
career here. Instrumental in convincing Wi.iesberry
was head frosh coach Bill Moultrie who will have
the pleasure of using him right off next season.
California Phenoms
Set to join Winesberry in late September for
unpacking, pre-reg and the opening of frosh
football is another fine running back, James
Ferguson. Ferguson, a 6-1, 180 pound back from
Kennedy High School in Richmond California, was
a member of the North Shrine football team this
season and has run the 100 in 9.9. Another good
prospect is Reggie lshman from Compton High
School in Compton, who was a third team All-CIF
split end. He is also reportedly a speedy low
hurdler.
One of a number who has yet to make up his
mind about Stanford is Lynn Swann, from Serra
High in San Mateo, considered one of the best
all-around athletes anywhere this past year. Swann
is a former teammate of Jess Freitas, who is
scheduled to play again after sitting out last year's
frosh season with mononucleosis.
As a junior, Swann made the all-Northern
California football team at offensive end, then
moved to quarterback following Frietas'
graduation and was named Northern California
Player of the Year for the past season. He was also
all-league in basketball and is an outstanding
hurdler and long jumper, -and will probably be
used as a wide receiver wherever he goes to college.
Swann has narrowed his choices down to USC and
Stanford, but has said he won't make a decision
until watching spring drills at both schools.


BILL MOULTRIEâ€”His recruiting efforts bring results.
On that fall day late last November when
Stanford squeaked by Cal 29-28 in the Big Game,
Stanford football was over in the mind of most
people for the next nine months. But the end of
the playing season for John Ralston and his
assistants marked the start of a crucial part of any
football program: the recruiting season.
For the next few months Ralston and his staff
would work on trying to convince blue chip high
school and junior college prospects that Stanford
would be "their kind of school." As the recruiting
season opened, coaches and recruiters from all
over the nation swooped down on the prospective
athlete to try and convince them that their school
offered the best football, "employment"
opportunities, parties, girls, alumni funds and
maybe even the test academic program.
The season now culminates in the spring with
letter -of-intent announcements as each school
flourishes the list of prospects it has lured.
The J C M arkel
Naturally, Ralston was after junior college
transfers who can step in and help this coming
season in nailing down the Rose Bowl berth which
so miraculously eluded Stanford last fall. Although
the Indians will have a nucleus of thirty-four
lettermen returning, question marks remain on
both offense and defense due to the loss of such
defensive stalwarts as linebackers Don Parish and
Pat Preston and backs Rich Keller and Dick Oliver;
'offensive linemen Pete Seymour, George Crooks,
Bob Reinhard and Dave Sharp, and running backs
Howie Williams and Bubba Brown.
At this point at least six good junior college
transfers have been lined up for next season. They
include two defensive backs, a linebacker, a
running back and two linemen.
The two defensive backs are Tim Robnett from
Bakersfield JC and Ben Barnes from Contra Costa
JC. Robnett goes at 5-11, 185 and played two
seasons at Bakersfield. He is tabbed as having good
speed and being exceptionally quick. Barnes, 6-1,
195, also had two years experience in junior
college. While he was at CCJC he ran back four
interceptions for touchdowns including one for 96
yards. Besides being the team's leading tackier, he
also saw action as an offensive receiver.
Next come the two linemen, Roger Cowan and
Larry Jones. Cowan is a 6-3, 230 pound defensive
