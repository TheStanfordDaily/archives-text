# Chasers Still Win Despite Big Play
## 
### STEVE CRONENBERG 
Spring intramural sports got
off to a roaring start last week
with league play beginning in
water polo, volleyball, and
softball.
In water polo, the DUs
displayed a strong offense in their
victory over the Chi Psis. In other
games the Theta Chis squeaked
past the SAEs, and the Theta

Delts defeated Biz I.
In volleyball, the Theta Delts
served notice that they could be
the team to beat as they soundly
trounced the SAEs. In other
games, the Phi Sigs decisioned
Theta Xi, the Delts slipped by the
Alpha Delts, and the Chi Psis
narrowly edged the Zetes.
In softball there was the usual
number of high scoring games and
great defensive plays which always
mark the first week of play. One
of the more lustrous defensive
gems was pulled off by the Math
team in their game against the
Ambulance Chasers. The
Ambulance Chasers had loaded
the bases with no one out when
the batter lofted a pop-up in the
infield.
The runners on base for the
Ambulance Chasers must have
heard sirens as at the crack of the
bat they were off and running. To
their great dismay the Math
in fielder caught the ball and
turned the routine pop-up into
the first triple play of the young
season.
Unfortunately, - this was the
highlight of the game for the Math
team as thev proceeded to lose
11-2.
Rumor has it that the Theta
Chi-Fiji softball game was a
grudge match as the Fijis
reportedly have stolen the
infamous Theta Chi "cheese"
defense. The Fijis did not waste
any time before using it as they
allowed the Theta Chi team to
score seven runs in the top of the
first on two hits and countless
errors. Theta Chi went on to win
the game, 12-0.
