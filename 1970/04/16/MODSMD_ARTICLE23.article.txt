# Roble Team Takes Title
## 
### 
Roble Hall walked off with a
bid to the Levi's Northern
California Intercollegiate
Wrist-Wrestl ing Championships by
sweeping Stanford's preliminaries
hands down so to speak.
There were no other teams
entered.
"We're looking for a shot at
the world's title that will by on
the line this May in Petaluma,"
commented manager John Sabl
following the gruelling matches.
"We're in it for more than the
blue jeans."
The fans, all two of them,
friends of the promoter, were on
their feet all eveningâ€”not
applauding, but providing practice
competition for the Roble
quintet.
Tom Raya, Ken Cook, Steve
Dougherty, and Paul Morse will be
wristling in the men's weight
divisions, and Iris Boudart will be
Stanford's big hope in the ladies
event.
