# Lacrosse Team Hits Road
## 
### 
Coming off a 7-5 victory over
Palo Alto last week which upped
its league record to 3-0, Stanford's
lacrosse team ventures away from
home this weekend to face Utah
and the Air Force Academy.
The Tribe, winner of new
popularity in the Utah area these
days, flies to Salt Lake Ci y for a
Friday battle with the Redskins
before pushing on to Colorado
Springs to face the Falcons who
clobbered Stanford 21-2 last year.
Coach Hugh West, former Card
goalie, expects the competition as
well as the altitute to present
problems.
"During this week, especially,
we've been emphasizing
conditioning and team work; we
have to work as a team Friday and
Saturday if we hope to win. All in

all I think we have a good chance
to come back with two wins," he
said during the week.
But the thin air and Air Force
could get in the way of those
plans. Utah, which Stanford has
never faced in lacrosse, is an
unknown quantity.
Last Saturday Butch Hazlett
scored three goals and Dirk Speas
gunned in two to pace the Indians
in their win over Palo Alto.
Stanford jumped out to a 4-1 lead
after two periods before the
visitors put together a strong but
ultimately futile challenge in the
fourth.
Stu Childs and Chip Loveman
tallied the other Stanford goals.
The upcoming road games will
be the second and third
intercollegiate games for the

lacrosse club, which dropped its
opener to the University of i
Denver 10-6.
The Indians travel to Berkeley
April 25, then meet the University
of Oregon here on May 9. After a
Los Angeles trip to face UCLA on
May 16, Berkeley will come to
Stanford May 23.
