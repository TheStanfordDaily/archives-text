# Tidings Glad & Sad On Sunken Scene
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
There was some good news
and some bad news Tuesday
afternoon as Stanford hosted UC
Davis in Sunken Diamond.
First the good news: the
Indians stretched their impressive
record to 25-5-1 with a laughing
11-2 win over the Aggies.
Stanford scored two runs in the
second, then picked up seven
more in the sixth with the help of
a slew of Davis errors.
Now the bad news: lefthander
-Jim Coate started for the Tribe
and was shelled. In two innings he
game up six hits and two earned
runs. Coate was pitching well
before spring break and was being
counted on to continue that kind
of performance during the Pac-8
season.
But should the junior not be at
peak effectiveness, especially this
weekend when two Pac-8 heavies,
USC and UCLA come to town,
then the mighty Indians might be
in more trouble than a Nixon
nominee to the Supreme Court.
With a loss to Cal in the league
opener last Saturday already on
the books, Stanford can ill-afford
to be losing front-line pitchers at
this stage.
The guy who might step in if
coach Ray Young decides not to
go with Coate is Bruce Schoen,
who went three scoreless innings,
striking out four, on Tuesday. But
Schoen has only pitched 29
innings this year, with an
earned-run-average of 2.77.
A better bet would be that
Bob Kammeyer (1.95 ERA) or
Tom Changnon ( 1.69) will get the
nod should Coate not pitch. (No
charge for these perceptive
a na I y se s, I h ree - fi ve.)
As is usually the case these
days, Steve Du ning was chiefly
responsible for Tuesday's win.
The righthander came over from

third base in the sixth and went
the last four, giving up one hit, no
runs and striking out eight. His
ERA went down to 1.31 and his
strike-out total is now 94 in 69
innings. His record is 9-1.
Du ning is having such a good
year that even his singles turn into
something exciting. On Tuesday,
with two men on, he hit a drive
over second which looked like it
might be good for one base. But
when the Aggies' 6-5 centerfielder
charged the rolling horsehide he
wasn't able to bend over far
enough to pick it up. Bingo,
Dunning turns on the gas and ,
scores.
Stanford stung the bail hard all
day and ended up with 1 1 hits.
Phil Kelber and Dick Borchers had I
two hits and Kelber chalked up
two RBl's.
The Cards face San Diego
State here today pt 3 p.m., UCLA
tomorrow and USC in a I
doubleheader starting at noon
Saturday.
The Stanford Braves,
meanwhile, scored seven runs in
the last two innings Tuesday to
defeat Cal 8-4 at Berkeley. Coach
Jim Jones' outfit, now 22-5, faces
USF in a doubleheader here a 1
p.m. today.
Bob Scott, now 6-0, got the
win Tuesday to help increase
Stanford's Bay Area Collegiate
League lead to two and one-half I
games over second place Santa |
Clara.
