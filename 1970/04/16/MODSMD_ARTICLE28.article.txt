# Ram's Head Shows: Ionesco, Prevert
## 
### 
Ram's Head Spring Show will
present an evening of French
farce—two related one act plays
by Eugene lonesco and Jacques
Prevert. Although both have been
iully cast, crew members for the
lonesco play are still needed.
lonesco's The Halt! Soprano has
now become a classic of the
theater of the absurd, but it was
received with confused disbelief
by audiences in 1950. The
inspiration for characters,
situation and dialogue comes from
a Teach Yourself English
textbook. The Bald Soprano is a
hilarious comment on many
subjects at many levels.
Set in a middle-class English
household, the characters include
Mr. and Mrs. Smith (played by
Tom Cushing and Janis Stewart),
their maid, Mary (Laura
deVirgilis), Mr. and Mrs. Martin
(Paul Moser and Joan Riley), and
the Fire Chief (Jody Schepps). It
is being directed by Kit Cameron
with assistant director Avery
Coburn.
A "United' Family is a
farce by French satirical poet
Jaques Prevert, best known to
American audiences for his
scenario for the movie classic The
Children of Paradise. Although
the play was first published in
1955, a first version had been
presented as early as 1935.
The action of a "United"
Family takes place in the living
room of a Paris lawyer who is
beseiged by several members of an
extraordinary family, each for a
different reason. Prevert wrote the
play originally to shock and
amuse his audience; the
amusement remains, but it is
unlikely that anyone today will be
shocked.
Appearing in A "United"
Family are Bill Frankfather,

Howard Brown, James Kason,
Jean Hartmann, Liz Frankfather,
Ninou Lake and Nancy Hendrick.
Robin Lake is directing.
A "United" Family runs about
half an hour and will follow The
Bald Soprano. The plays will be
presented in the Nitery on May
7-9 and 15-16 at 8:30 p.m., with a
student preview on Wednesday
May 6. Tickets will be on sale at
Tresidder Box Office.
