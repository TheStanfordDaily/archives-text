# Legal Defense Appeal
## 
### 
An appeal has been made for
contributions to support the legal
defense of students who have
been arrested in connection with
recent demonstrations.
The Legal Defense Committee
estimates that $10,000 will be
needed to pay court costs, appeal
bonds and fines for defense of
nine defendants faced with more
than '20 charges.
Five of the defendants have
been charged with three counts of
contempt of court for allegedly
violating an injunction against
disrupting ROTC classes. In their
trial beginning tomorrow, they
will be denied a jury and
presumed to be in contempt

unless tliey can show cause why
they did not violate the
injunction. Appeal rights are
limited. Penalties can range up to
15 days in jail and $1,500 fine
each.
Four earlier court cases arose
when arrests were made by police
on campus during the night-time
marches to the ROTC building
two weeks ago. Bail for these
defendants was set at $1,500
each.
The defense fund has asked
residence groups to consider
contributing part of their house
funds to the legal defense.
Contributions should be sent to
the Legal Defense Committee,
ASSU Office, Stanford.
