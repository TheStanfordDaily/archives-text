# 8000 Attend Dawn Frost Rally Marking Anti-War Moratorium
## 
### JOHN JOHNSTON 
Eight thousand people braved
early morning chill and bleary
eyes yesterday morning to fill
Frost Amphitheater, joining the
cast of Hair and Americans across
the country in an April
Moratorium protesting the
Vietnam war.
The dawn "Festival of Life" in
Frost was the keynote anti-war
activity at Stanford, featuring
songs from "Hair," and speeches
by U.S. Senate candidate George
Brown and State Assemblyman
John Vascancellos.
Sixty thousand demonstrators
turned out in the Boston
Common and 20,000 gathered in
New York, climaxing the first day
of major anti-war protest since the
November 15 marches in San
Francisco and Washington.
Primary as Referendum
Candidate Brown urged the
Frost crowd to treat the June
California primary elections as a
referendum on the war. Said
Brown, "President Nixon will
never listen to assemblies such as
this one, but he does count
votes." Brown urged support of
anti-war candidates.
Brown stated clearly that "no
candidate for public office should
go before the people this year
without taking the firmest
possible stand against the war in
Vietnam."
In related matters, Brown
expressed his opinion that this
and the past administrations have
been pursuing a deliberate policy
of deceiving the people of this
country and working to establish
a "warfare state." He said it is
time to return power to the
people and to make government
responsive to them rather than to
the major economic powers. "In
other words, it is time to turn the
whole system around," he
declared.
Listing two possible methods
for carrying out this objective, the
electoral process and violent
revolution, he decided to give the
government one more chance to
change nonviolently even though
a number of people in the crowd
indicated their preference for
violent revolution.
Radical Evaluation
Songs chosen from the musical
closely paralleled the remarks of
opening speaker Assemblyman
John Vascancellos. Assemblyman
Vascancellos, the author of a bill
to forbid California men to fight
in a foreign war without a
Congressional declaration of war,
called for a "radical evaluation of
each one of us as human beings."
He lauded participation in a
group that would come out to the
amphitheatre at six o'clock in the
morning in the interest of doing
something for peace.
"The critical question is one of

how," he stated. "How can I live
my life, orient my being, put
myself together to help bring
about peace? Unless you and I are
willing to get personally and
heavily involved into the problem
of how," he continued, "then
we're really not very serious about
what has been so easy to
proclaim."
Although Vascancellos did not
suggest any specific practices, he
did urge the crowd to "get
together as a people and as a
community to affect those in
public office who need their
awareness changed."
Internal Revenue Protest
Later in the day, the focus of
activity turned to protests at
Internal Revenue Service offices.
In San Mateo, 325 people
marched from the Hillsdale
Shopping Center past the Internal
Revenue office. About 25
protestors stayed to march around
the building, as the crowd moved
off to San Mateo's Central Park.
After listening to several rock
groups the group, now numbering

200 heard retired Navy Admiral
Arnold True and Vietnam veteran
Andy Fisher decry U.S. Vietnam
policy. Stanford economics
professor Martin Carnoy told the
crowd that "we have to take
action as a group, and by that I
mean direct action." Carnoy
urged the protestors to withhold
that portion of their income tax
used for war.
San Francisco
A lunch time crowd estimated
by police at 3,500 gathered in the
San Francisco Civic Center,
listening to rock bands and
brandishing such signs as "Your
tax dollars will become coffin
nails."
Monitors wearing armbands of
The Resistance and the New
Mobilization kept everything in
order.
A threatened sit-in at the
Internal Revenue Service offices
failed to develop.
The Rev. James Groppi,
militant Milwaukee Catholic
priest, scolded the crowd for lack
of action.

"We ought to be tying up this
city," he said. "We need a little
more direct and militant action."
Other Protests
Elsewhere across the country
similar protests were staged.
Crowds in Boston Common
were estimated at 60,000, in New
York's Bryant Park, 20,000, but
generally turnouts were below
that of previous moratoriums.
Tea was dumped into the
Mississippi and Cedar rivers as
reenactments of the
Revolutionary era's tax
defianceâ€”the Boston Tea Party.
Demonstrators at Internal
Revenue Service sites numbered
4,000 in Chicago and in New
York City, and ranged down to
about 700 in Washington, D.C.,
200 in Boston, 150 in White
Plains, N.Y., and 16 in Oklahoma
City.
Demonstrators at Pennsylvania
State University seized and
damaged the administration
building, and a brief melee
erupted between police and
protesters in Detroit.
