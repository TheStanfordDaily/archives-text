## Apollo 13 Corrects Course 
### 
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP)
— Three harried American
astronauts fired a 15-second burst
of rocket power last night and
likely broke out of the perilous
course that would have left them
stranded in space.
Flight Director Gerald Griffin
said, "It looks good at first look.
If the burn turned out as well as it
appeared, we will not need
another midcourse correction."
Whether the hobbled Apollo
13 spaceship was on a course for a
Friday landing in the Pacific
Ocean was not. known yet. But
the voices of its crew, James L.
Lovell Jr., Fred W. Haise Jr. and
Jack L. Swigert Jr. turned
somewhat brighter after the burn.
Flight dynamics officers want
more time to study the orbit and
track the spacecraft by radio.
They estimate they will have a
good reading on the new flight
path sometime between 2 a.m.
EST and 4 a.m. EST Thursday.
They are also waiting for the
effects of the venting of some
helium gas which may or may not
alter the orbit even more.
The firing looked good from
the start.
"Thrust looks good," said
Mission Control. The space
veteran Lovell, flight commander
and world record holder for most
hours in space was at the controls.
His two rookie crewmate*s
concentrated on the instruments.

The rocket firing came with
Apollo 13 so badly off course that
without correction it would miss
the earth by 104 miles, its three
pilots lost forever.
The burst of power had a
braking effect on the Apollo 13,
aimed to make its angle to earth
more steep.
Massacre
The bodies of hundreds of
Vietnamese, possibly killed by
Cambodians, floated down the
Meking River yesterday while 65
miles to the southeast Cambodian
troops teamed with South
Vietnamese in a battle with the
North Vietnamese inside
Cambodia.
A police official at Neak
Luong, where a ferry crosses the
Meking, said he had counted 400
bodies in the morning and still
more could be seen.
There was no direct evidence
that Cambodian soldiers had
killed the Vietnamese. But the
government has been carrying on
a violent propaganda campaign
against the 600,000 Vietnamese
living in Cambodia. The Viet Cong
also has been killing Vietnamese
in Cambodia
The Khmers of Cambodia and
the Vietnamese have been
traditional enemies for centuries.
The government that overthrew
Prince Norodom Sihanouk last
month has been rounding up
Vietnamese as suspected security
risks.
Cambodian soldiers have
burned a number of villages
inhabited by Vietnamese. In some
instances they claimed the
villagers fled with the Viet Cong.
Attacks Douglas
WASHINGTON (AP) - Gerald R.
Ford asserted yesterday that
Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas may be unfit to remain
on the court because of
questionable outside activities.

including controversial writings
and possible associations with
underworld figures.
In a wide-ranging attack on the
71-year-old justice, Ford told the
House he supports creation of a
select congressional committee to
study Douglas's activities and
determine what cause there might
be for impeachment. But the GOP
leader stopped short of flatly
demanding removal of Douglas, a
Democrat.
"What we should scrutinize in
sitting judges is their continuing
pattern of action, their behavior,"
the Michigan Republican said.
"The Constitution does not
demand that it be exemplary or
perfect. But it does have to be
good."
Fort attacked also Douglas's
most recent book. "Points of
Rebellion," declaring "its thesis is
that violence may be justified and
perhaps only revolutionary
overthrew of the establishment
can save the country."
"I concede that William O.
Douglas has a right to write and
publish what he pleases, but I
suggest that for Associate Justice
Douglas to put his name to such
an inflammatory volume as
"Points of Rebellion" at a critical
time in our history when peace
and order is what we need, is less
than judicial good behavior,"
Ford said.

SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP)
— Three harried American
astronauts fired a 15-second burst
of rocket power last night and
likely broke out of the perilous
course that would have left them
stranded in space.
Flight Director Gerald Griffin
said, "It looks good at first look.
If the burn turned out as well as it
appeared, we will not need
another midcourse correction."
Whether the hobbled Apollo
13 spaceship was on a course for a
Friday landing in the Pacific
Ocean was not. known yet. But
the voices of its crew, James L.
Lovell Jr., Fred W. Haise Jr. and
Jack L. Swigert Jr. turned
somewhat brighter after the burn.
Flight dynamics officers want
more time to study the orbit and
track the spacecraft by radio.
They estimate they will have a
good reading on the new flight
path sometime between 2 a.m.
EST and 4 a.m. EST Thursday.
They are also waiting for the
effects of the venting of some
helium gas which may or may not
alter the orbit even more.
The firing looked good from
the start.
"Thrust looks good," said
Mission Control. The space
veteran Lovell, flight commander
and world record holder for most
hours in space was at the controls.
His two rookie crewmate*s
concentrated on the instruments.

The rocket firing came with
Apollo 13 so badly off course that
without correction it would miss
the earth by 104 miles, its three
pilots lost forever.
The burst of power had a
braking effect on the Apollo 13,
aimed to make its angle to earth
more steep.
Massacre
The bodies of hundreds of
Vietnamese, possibly killed by
Cambodians, floated down the
Meking River yesterday while 65
miles to the southeast Cambodian
troops teamed with South
Vietnamese in a battle with the
North Vietnamese inside
Cambodia.
A police official at Neak
Luong, where a ferry crosses the
Meking, said he had counted 400
bodies in the morning and still
more could be seen.
There was no direct evidence
that Cambodian soldiers had
killed the Vietnamese. But the
government has been carrying on
a violent propaganda campaign
against the 600,000 Vietnamese
living in Cambodia. The Viet Cong
also has been killing Vietnamese
in Cambodia
The Khmers of Cambodia and
the Vietnamese have been
traditional enemies for centuries.
The government that overthrew
Prince Norodom Sihanouk last
month has been rounding up
Vietnamese as suspected security
risks.
Cambodian soldiers have
burned a number of villages
inhabited by Vietnamese. In some
instances they claimed the
villagers fled with the Viet Cong.
Attacks Douglas
WASHINGTON (AP) - Gerald R.

Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas may be unfit to remain

questionable outside activities.

In a wide-ranging attack on the
71-year-old justice, Ford told the
