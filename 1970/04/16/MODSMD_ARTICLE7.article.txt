# Crowds Attend Chicano Rally, Speech
## 
### 
Corky Gonzales, leader of the
Denver Crusade for Justice told
.500 in Memorial Church last night
that Mexicanos will "create a
brotherhood that will make the
Mafia look like an insect. A
brotherhood not for crime, but
for La Causa, for freedom."
"We have to teach our own
people that nationalism means we
are one family. Don't let a liberal
tell you that nationalism is reverse
racism. The reverse of racism is
humanism."
Gonzales stated that Chicanos
must be able to select their own
leaders and decide how to run
their own communities.
Education of their people must
begin at the family unit, Chicanos
must demand that doctors and
lawyers must contribute to the
community rather than exploit it.
Mexicanos must stop being used
by the two party system by
creating and building an
independent party such as La
Raza Unidos.
His speech and a noon rally
were part of Semana de La
Raza, a series of Mexican-Amer
ican oriented events organized by
MECHA, the Chicano student
organization.
Chicano power is gaining the
upper hand in Crystal City, Texas,

the nowly-elected young chairman
of the Crystal City school board
told a noon rally at Stanford
yesterday.
Jose Angel Gutierrez told 400
Bay Area high school and college
students that Crystal City stresses
"barriology" â€” emphasis on the
need for Chicano cultural and
economic solidarity.
The Southwest Texas area
which is 85 percent Chicano, is
using economic boycotts to
eliminate franchise operators and
to "transfer the economy" to the
Chicano community.
They have acquired beer
franchises, a chain of grocery
stores, and are making strides
toward establishing a chain of dry
cleaners throughout the U.S.
South west.
Kliminalr The (irineo
"Wo are going to eliminate the gringo,
not by racial extermination but in the
sense that the paternalist and
racist Anglo attitude is eliminated,
Gutierrez said.
Gutierrez this month was
elected to the school board, which
now has a Chicano majority of
four out of the seven members,
Chicanos also have a good chance
to dominate the city council and
the county board of supervisors,
he related.

The inability of the Texas State
Board of Education to supply
them with appropriate history
texts has led them to obtain
textbooks in Spanish from
Mexico, Gutierrez said.
Remember Heritage
Felix Gutierrez, assistant dean
of students at Stanford, urged the
crowd not to forget their cultural
heritage.
He urged them not to be
assimilated by the Anglo culture
but to "study your books, ask for
relevant education, and sweep
away all obstacles toward what
you want."
Militant I nemc
A similar theme was
emphasized by another guest
speaker, Sal Casto, a militant Los
Angeles high school teacher.
Casto said that Chicano
students "were psychologically
whipped from the age of five by
the need to make a judgement to
use English because it is more
effective than Spanish.
He also described Chicanos as
the "invisible minority". To prove
his assertion, Casto noted several
instances in which American
history text.s eliminated successes
of noteworthy Mexican-Amer
icans.
