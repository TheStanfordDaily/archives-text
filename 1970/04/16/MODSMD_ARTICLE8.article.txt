# No ROTC
## 
### 
American military officers train more than 200 Stanford, Foothill
and San Jose State college students each year to become what Army
Colonel Stanley Ramey calls "some of the best officers in the
country."
Between the walls of Stanford's athletic building, army, navy and
air force officers teach the academic essentials any good American
officer must know. On the dusty Stanford athletic fields, instructors
teach their men the discipline they desire in American military
officers.
In return for scholarship aid, students must drill, go on summer
cruises or to summer camp, and take special, designated courscs.
As Vice Provost Howard Brooks explained one day, "ROTC
scholarship students are actually under orders when they are here.
When they ask to leave the ROTC program, the army sees this as a
violation of orders."
During the past two years, both students and faculty have attacked
this kind of military training program. Their chajlcnge has focused on
two questions: first, should ROTC receive academic credit; second,
should University facilities be used to support such training?
We say no to both.
The major issues may be approached wdhin either an academic or
a political framework. Academicians attempt to analyse the ROTC
program on its own merits, but in a political and temporal void. The
others emphasize the political implications of Stanford training
officers for the American military. While we believe the political
argument is the most telling of the two, the academic argument
against ROTC is also valid.
In an academic analysis, the central question is whether ROTC
courses are conducted like other University courses; and if they are
not, whether the differences warrant removing credit and banning
them from campus.
That there are significant differences between ROTC courses and
other subjects cannot be contested. As Provost Richard Lyman said in
an interview last night, 'These courses are not exactly like any other
ones."
Punitive clauses constitute the primary difference. Only ROTC
students arc required to take certain subjects and then ordered to
pursue and practice what they have learned for four years after they
have left school.
Many people maintain the importance of the punitive clause is
exaggerated, and that may be true; but for those who have read the
"Unknown Soldier's" columns in recent Dailies, there can be little
doubt academic freedom is stilled by the potential of the clause. It is
also restricted by the more subtle power that ROTC commanders
possess of assigning their officers to combat zones.
Stanford's ROTC program allows the military to train its men in
"academically free" University facilities —to train them under orders
and with the obligation to undertake four years of leadership scrvice.
One final academic question must be considered -should there be
an absolute right to teach and learn anything one wants. Knee-jerk
liberals respond that this right is inherent, inalienable. We disagree.
Rights are not absolute. Even the fundamental right to "freedom
of speech" is vastly limited. No one has the right to conspire to
murder another individual. This right to talk is curtailed, and well it
should be.
Teaching and learning are similar to speech. There should be no
right to conspire in any classroom to murder others. Yet exactly that
occurs every day in the ROTC classrooms and on the drill fields.
Of course, there is a response to this academic argument—that the
University is part of the country and that its regulations should
support United States institutions. But this argument involves a
political decision which few people recognize.
The military is the coercive arm of the state, and therefore helps
carry out the policies of the state. ROTC, as a part of the military,
helps carry out United States policies in Vietnam, Laos,
Cambodia ... One cannot ignore this fact in considering the
legitimacy of ROTC at Stanford.
The major criticism leveled at this kind of political reasoning is
that the Vietnam war is too temporary an event to warrant
eliminating an institution. We believe ephemeral symptoms should not
cause the total destruction of basically sound institutions. However,
the American military is not only locked into Vietnam. The armed
services or CIA military forces have been involved in Cuba, the
Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Iran, Laos, Thailand, etc. And they
will be for years.
Most of the peoples of Asia, Latin America and Africa arc
economically oppressed, and the United States military almost
uniformly aids and abets the oppressors.
We see no major change of US policy in sight.
We sec the elimination of ROTC as a way to help cripple an
important element used to implement that policy. Vote ROTC off
campus.
