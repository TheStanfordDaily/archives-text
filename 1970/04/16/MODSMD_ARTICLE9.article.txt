Law School Protest
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Board of Trustees
is prosecuting five members of the
Anti-ROTC movement for
violating an injunction obtained
nearly a year ago. We, the
undersigned law students, wish to
make clear the repressive and
political nature of this
prosecution.
Contempt proceedings lack
certain fundamental procedural
safeguards of formal criminal
prosecutions. The 5 cited will not
receive a jury trial, will be denied
basic evidentiary safeguards and
will have only five days to prepare
their defense. Furthermore, the
injunction makes conduct which
is not illegal under the California
Penal Code subject to such
contempt proceedings. None of
the affidavits filed by the Board
of Trustees contains any
allegation that the 5 engaged in
conduct in itself clearly violative
of California criminal law; they
are being prosecuted merely for
participating in a "mill-in" and for
attending ROTC classes and an
Academic Council meeting.
Secondly, the trustees' choice
of defendants reveals their
intention to strike at the political
roots of the movement by ripping
off those they recognize as its
"leaders." The university's own
affidavits make clear that the
actions of those cited were no
more ''disruptive" or
"obstructive" than those of
countless others. These five are in
fact being prosecuted because
they have spoken out at numerous
public meetings. This form of
selective prosecution is at best a
subterfuge to bypass and weaken
the First Amendment and at
worst the "legal" counterpart, of

political assassinationâ€”a domestic
"Operation Phoenix."
Thirdly, Stanford has exercised
considerable discretionary power
throughout this entire
prosecutorial process. It has made
very interesting and deliberate
decisions, choosing to civilly
prosecute the case itself rather
than seeking formal criminal
prosecution on the basis of a
penal statute making it a
misdemeanor willfully to violate a
court order. This alternative
prosecution by the state would
have afforded the defendants the

right of a jury trial and a greater
period of time to prepare their
case. However, to ease conviction
and expedite prosecution, the
more repressive method was
chosen.
In this instance, (similar in
many ways to management's use
of the courts against the labor
movements), the University is
attempting to put a judicial gloss
over its very "political" act of
intimidation. The courts are not
merely "sensitive" to political and
social pressures. They are
themselves political instruments

through which particular class
interests are maintained and
furthered. Off ROTC! maintained
and furthered. Off ROTC!
