# Cal Violence Flares Again
## 
### TOM GIVEN PAUL LUFKIN 
Thirty-five persons were
arrested and scores injured as
violence flared for the second day
at U.C. Berkeley.
Acting in defiance of
Chancellor Roger Heyn's state of
emergency, 1500 demonstrators
massed in Sproul Plaza at noon
yesterday to protest ROTC at Cal.
A subsequent march on
Cailaghan Hall, headquarters of
the ROTC program, was turned
back by police using tear gas and
clubs. Fighting then spread across
the campus as bands of
demonstrators threw rocks at
campus police, Berkeley police,
and Alameda County Deputy
Sheriffs.
Police used more gas to disperse
demonstrators, as the skirmshes
continued. Low on tear gas,
several groups of officers ran and
were forced to retreat into
buildings under a heavy hail of
rocks.
Policeman Felled
One policeman was felled by
the barrage near Sather Gate.
Police fired tear gas into the
lobby of the ASUC ( building
breaking a window and forcing
occupants to evacuate the
building.
Part of the crowd moved off
campus, carrying the fighting to
Telegraph Avenue, scene of the
People's Park battles.
Faculty Clu h Hit
Another group of 75
demonstrators used iron pipes to
break down the doors of the
Faculty Club. Furniture was
destroyed and the lounge and
dining area were covered with
broken dishes, and overturned
chairs.
A number of false fire alarms
were turned in, but there was no
repeat of Wednesday's $2,000
fire.
The most serious injury
reported was that of a
non-student whose leg was broken
in four places by a police club. He
was taken to a hospital under
custody.
Close to a score of others
reported lacerations and bruises
sustained during the fighting. One

observer estimated the number of
persons suffering from tear gas
inhalation at "three hundred
plus."
Arrests
Most of those arrested were
charged with assault with upon an
officer with a deadly weapon and
resisting arrest. Others were also
charged with trespassing and
assault. At least 14 persons are
being held on bails of
$5500-$5 BOO.
Former Cal student body
president Dan Siegel, charged with
incitment to riot on Wednesday,
turned himself in to police
yesterday. He was released on
$2000 bail.
Suspensions
Operating on the basis of the
state of emergency declared
Wednesday, Chancellor Hayns
issued summary suspensions of
three students yesterday. Two of
the students involved were
arrested Wednesday, the rest
arrested in yesterday's action.
Under a March ruling by the
Board of Regents, the Chancellor
can automatically suspend a
student arrested on or within a
mile of campus during a State of
Emergency.
In a statement issued yesterday
afternoon, Heyns said that the
day's "wanton destruction" was
"unprecedented in the history of
the university ..."
He added that, "Any attempt
to link today's grim events with
moral issues is a travesty on
morality and a pallid attempt to
pass off criminal acts as political
acts."
He pledged disciplinary action
against demonstrators who could
be identified. In addition, he
applauaded the "great restraint on
the part of the police."
More To Come
Despite the arrests and the
continued state of emergency, the
prospects of further violence on
campus remain high.
Last night, in a meeting held
off campus, 150 supporters of
SDS called for a rally today at
noon in Sproul Plaza. Under the
terms of the state of emergency,
any such gathering will be illegal,
and subject to dispersal by police
