# For Eco-Freaks
## The
						Environmental Reading List 
### Barry Wood 
With Earth Day just under a
week away there will probably be
a rush to bone up on the subject
so that everyone can be an Instant
Environmentalist by April 22. In
order to make the job easier the
following short guide to available
books is presented as a starting
point for the weekend ecologist.
If you have time to read only
one book, Ecotactics (95c) is
probably as good as any. This is
the Sierra Club Handbook for
Environment Activists and was
published in paperback just this
month. Ralph Nader, the
self-made consumer spokesman,
writes the introduction, pointing
out the importance of consumer
pressure in activating change.
Industry, says Nader, has the
know-how to clean up a great
deal, but will not deliver until
consumers demand it.
Two articles in this handbook
which go together are John
Mitchell's, "On the Spoor of the
Slide Rule," and"The Ecology of
Revolution" by Tony Wagner.

Mitchell speaks of the
cowboy-technocrat with the
"frontier hangover" who likes to
corral whole rivers, lasso icebergs,
and ride on sonic booms. It is rule
by Technocracy which is the basic
enemy of envirnomental quality.
"The most fundamental
question facing us today," says
Wagner, "is whether or not life
will continue on this planet." In
the common radical spate of cries
for "revolution" the question of
revolution for what is often
forgotten. Phrases like Revolution
for the Hell of It, Fascist Pigs Off
Campus, and Down With the
System chip away at the edges of
a real but monolithic problem.
Livcability Doubtful
Senator Gaylord Nelson strikes
dead center: "The institutions we
have created are destroying the
liveability of the whole world." In
Wagner's words, "the revolution is
for life against death." The rises
above party distinctions and the
rest, and forms one of the
soundest platforms for a

revolution that I have yet seen.
The Environmental Handbook
is a more "moderate" book
designed to appeal to the cautious
student on the fringe of
involvement. The editor was, I
think, attempting to avoid
alienating the Establishment
where this book is getting a wide
reading.
One wonders, however, if
moderate solutions are not
putting off a day of reckoning. It
has become apparent, even in the
last few months, that recycling
cans and bottles, composting
organic wastes, and using
biodegradable detergents are
acceptable to the Technocrats
because they provide one more
way of making money off
pollution without cutting back on
an urgent problem—over
consumption.
Complex's Iron Grip
The military-industrial-tech
nocratic complex has an iron grip
on the philosophy by which our
daily lives are lived. This must be

broken. Under this philosophy we
"need" the ABM and the SST.
Moreover, today we "need" what
was yesterday a luxury. Thus we
are hypnotized and infantilized,
turned into a nation of cry babies
who really think we need two
cars, electric mixers, automatic
washers, redwood lawn furniture,
eight pair of shoes, and mountains
of "goods" which are just short of
turning into garbage while we
gloat over them.
Despite its popularity, Silent
Spring is a highly specialized book
on pesticides. It should be read in
conjunction with Graham's book,
Since Silent Spring, which brings
the record not to date. It ought to
be read, but no as an introduction
to environmental problems.
The best introduction to the
whole spectrum of problems we
face is Moment in the Sun, which
carries the subtitle A Report on
the Deteriorating Quality of the
American Environment. This runs
the gamit, Water shortage, urban
sprawl, wildlife destruction, water
and air pollution, wilderness
levelling, noise pollution,
pesticides, population, the
economy of greed, and dozens of
smaller infections we have learned
to tolerate.
Thirty Foot Files
Written with a passion, this
book is backed by 3 decades of
first-hand experience and 30 feet
of files on the topics included.
The notes provide a goldmine of
references to magasine articles and
government reports stretching
back many years. Few books
come closer to the raw nerves of
American life than this one.
Paul Ehrlich's The Population
Bomb needs no introduction. It is
now pushing close to 400,000
sales and has created a national
awareness -not bad for a book

dashed off in 3 weeks. For a more
detailed piece of research, Famine
1975 by William and Paul
Paddock is probably as good as
any. And for a detailed analysis of
the situation in this state,
including the background to the
controversial California Water
Plan, The Destruction of
California by Dasmann is to the
point. The Handbook of the San
Francisco Region by Dreisbach
has a narrower focus, and includes
some particularly pointed
comments about automobile use
and transportation needs in the
Bay Area.
A slightly better case than
usual can be made for reading
some of these, or others on similar
lines. Stated simply: these are not
books which cater to narrow
specialization or departmental
interest. These books take on
importance precisely because they
are about survival—that is, life and
death.
