## Why Rush? Rush What? 
### Gordon Norman 
(First of two parts.)
As the members of the
twenty-one selective fraternities at
Stanford, and many freshmen,
transfer students, and some
upperclassmen are now engaged in
the most active phase of the
selection process unaffectionately
known as Rush, it is perhaps
appropriate to ask certain
fundamental questions about
what is going on: Rush what? And
why "rush" at all? Who's in such a
hurry?
I would like to think that the
freshmen are in no great hurry to
go anywhere—they will encounter
hassles galore all too soon. And as
they advance through the
anxiety-filled years of their
undergraduate career, they will
surely at some time find rushing
an inevitability. Deliberate retreat
into idleness and indolence will
become more and more difficult,
and commensurately more
luxurious. But for the present,
they seem happy with their lot in
campus life, and tend to be
unconcerned with controlling
their future insofar as that's
possible.
Upperclassmen share a
different situation—either they
have found their existential niche
in life and are consumed by the
seemingly interminable activities,
both academic and otherwise,
which they seem necessary for the
eventual realization of their
manifest destiny; or through
constant effort and diligent
self-deception, they have
"escaped" the university/real
world dilemma and find
themselves randomly tossed about
in the existential maelstrom,
obsessed with their impotence and
the futility of everything.
So by his senior year, one
finds that either one has the
diploma in the back pocket and a
foot in the back door of graduate
school, business, or industry, or
one is about to be expelled as an
immiscible drop into the stream
of life outside. Thus, one the one
hand, rushing becomes a necessary
way of life and is accepted as
readily as smog and rush-hour
traffic, or else it is a nonsensical
and useless waste of metabolic
energy which simply adds more
random motion to the existing
chaos. (Certainly a continuum of
all degrees exists within this range,
but somehow, the most notable
cases exists within this range, but
somehow, the most notable cases
always seem to fall in the
extremes.)
Rush No Picnic
So what does all this have to
do with fraternities and Rush and
freshmen, anyway? Well, in my
estimation, plenty. First of all,
Rush has to be a bilateral process
of communcation and
familiarization if it is to have
success. That means equal effort
by both parties —and there's no
use kidding yourself that Rush
isn't work and lots of it. In this
light, I think the "haste
syndrome" goes a long way
toward explaining (1) why Rush is
difficult for the freshmen, (2)
why it's no picnic for the
fraternities, and (3) why
fraternities at Stanford have

suffered from illusory images and
misconceptions for several years.
When spring's Uionysian
euphoria descends upon the Farm
and particularly its freshmen folk,
who cares about next year's living
situation, anyway? Certainly open
houses offer little competition to
the more appealing call of the
wild issued forth by the sun, surf,
sand, and suds; and numerous
attractive socio-political issues
abound which are more than eager
to absorb the entirety of one's
energies. Even those who are less
engaged in campus activities often
find Rush somewhat irrelevant
and inconvenient in the context
of their current social life and
other activities in the dorms. In
short, the motivation is lacking;
most freshmen are not quite yet
caught up in the mad dash of
academia and its extracurricular
involvements. For them, the
payoff of Rush is rather vague and
distant, if not completely elusive.
Secondly, an open house is no
fraternity's idea of an
actionpacked, fun-filled evening
of revelry, either! Most likely, the
experience is equally, if not more
uncomfortable for actives than for
rushees; and certainly it is no
more stimulating or exciting for
either after two or three years.
Many houses have some difficulty
enforcing attendance policies at
Rush functions; the actives seem
to be either too busy doing
something else— booking, classes,
speeches, meetings, etc—or simply
too lacadaisical and apathetic to
do anything at all. That is, either
the "rush syndrome" has got
them tied up already, or their

reaction to it prevents any further
action.
The only cure I can see is
concern—a concern for survival,
for vitality, for operational
viability in a community which
feels little need for or purpose to
fraternities. The need for this sort
of concern is becoming
increasingly imperative as
financial problems are besetting
many of the houses. Whether the
need will be met must ultimately
be left to the individual
fraternities.
As for image .. . it's a
much-debated, oft-paraded
subject which I would rather
avoid if I did not feel it to be so
blatantly confusing the actual
problems which confront the
fraternities. I am the first to admit
that the 21 fraternities have their
problems, as do all other living
groups, but I would at least have
them criticized for the problems
which they do have rather than
the fictitious issues which
traditionally arise at this time of
year.
The question of relevance, for
instance, no longer seems to be a
question at all—one need only
glance over a roster of fraternity
membership to find leaders and
participants in virtually every
facet of community life, from
athletics to academics, politics to
metaphysics, SLAC to SMIP.
Gone are the days lack of concern
for any issue more political than
campus liquor police . . . perhaps
too far gone for some. At any
rate, relevance is not the issue.

by both parties —and there's no
use kidding yourself that Rush
isn't work and lots of it. In this
light, I think the "haste
syndrome" goes a long way
toward explaining (1) why Rush is
difficult for the freshmen, (2)
why it's no picnic for the
fraternities, and (3) why
fraternities at Stanford have

suffered from illusory images and
misconceptions for several years.
When spring's Uionysian
euphoria descends upon the Farm
and particularly its freshmen folk,
who cares about next year's living
situation, anyway? Certainly open
houses offer little competition to
the more appealing call of the
wild issued forth by the sun, surf,
sand, and suds; and numerous
attractive socio-political issues
abound which are more than eager
to absorb the entirety of one's
energies. Even those who are less
engaged in campus activities often
find Rush somewhat irrelevant
and inconvenient in the context
of their current social life and
other activities in the dorms. In
short, the motivation is lacking;
most freshmen are not quite yet
caught up in the mad dash of
academia and its extracurricular
involvements. For them, the
payoff of Rush is rather vague and
distant, if not completely elusive.
Secondly, an open house is no
fraternity's idea of an
actionpacked, fun-filled evening
of revelry, either! Most likely, the
experience is equally, if not more
uncomfortable for actives than for
rushees; and certainly it is no
more stimulating or exciting for
either after two or three years.
Many houses have some difficulty
enforcing attendance policies at
Rush functions; the actives seem
to be either too busy doing
something else— booking, classes,
speeches, meetings, etc—or simply
too lacadaisical and apathetic to
do anything at all. That is, either
the "rush syndrome" has got
them tied up already, or their

reaction to it prevents any further
action.
The only cure I can see is
concern—a concern for survival,
for vitality, for operational
viability in a community which
feels little need for or purpose to
fraternities. The need for this sort
of concern is becoming
increasingly imperative as
financial problems are besetting
many of the houses. Whether the
need will be met must ultimately
be left to the individual
fraternities.
As for image .. . it's a
much-debated, oft-paraded
subject which I would rather
avoid if I did not feel it to be so
blatantly confusing the actual
problems which confront the
fraternities. I am the first to admit
that the 21 fraternities have their
problems, as do all other living
groups, but I would at least have
them criticized for the problems
which they do have rather than
the fictitious issues which
traditionally arise at this time of
year.
The question of relevance, for
instance, no longer seems to be a
question at all—one need only
glance over a roster of fraternity
membership to find leaders and
participants in virtually every
facet of community life, from
athletics to academics, politics to
metaphysics, SLAC to SMIP.
Gone are the days lack of concern
for any issue more political than
campus liquor police . . . perhaps
too far gone for some. At any
rate, relevance is not the issue.

As the members of the
twenty-one selective fraternities at
Stanford, and many freshmen,
transfer students, and some
upperclassmen are now engaged in
the most active phase of the
selection process unaffectionately
known as Rush, it is perhaps
appropriate to ask certain
fundamental questions about
what is going on: Rush what? And
why "rush" at all? Who's in such a
hurry?
I would like to think that the
freshmen are in no great hurry to
go anywhere—they will encounter
hassles galore all too soon. And as
they advance through the
anxiety-filled years of their
undergraduate career, they will
surely at some time find rushing
an inevitability. Deliberate retreat
into idleness and indolence will
become more and more difficult,
and commensurately more
luxurious. But for the present,
they seem happy with their lot in
campus life, and tend to be
unconcerned with controlling
their future insofar as that's
possible.
Upperclassmen share a
different situation—either they
have found their existential niche
in life and are consumed by the
seemingly interminable activities,
both academic and otherwise,
which they seem necessary for the
eventual realization of their
manifest destiny; or through
constant effort and diligent
self-deception, they have
"escaped" the university/real
world dilemma and find
themselves randomly tossed about
in the existential maelstrom,
obsessed with their impotence and
the futility of everything.
So by his senior year, one
finds that either one has the
diploma in the back pocket and a
foot in the back door of graduate
school, business, or industry, or
one is about to be expelled as an
immiscible drop into the stream
of life outside. Thus, one the one
hand, rushing becomes a necessary
way of life and is accepted as
readily as smog and rush-hour
traffic, or else it is a nonsensical
and useless waste of metabolic
energy which simply adds more
random motion to the existing
chaos. (Certainly a continuum of
all degrees exists within this range,
but somehow, the most notable
cases exists within this range, but
somehow, the most notable cases
always seem to fall in the
extremes.)

fraternities. I am the first to admit
that the 21 fraternities have their
problems, as do all other living
groups, but I would at least have
them criticized for the problems
which they do have rather than
the fictitious issues which
traditionally arise at this time of
year.
The question of relevance, for
instance, no longer seems to be a
question at all—one need only
glance over a roster of fraternity
membership to find leaders and
participants in virtually every
facet of community life, from
athletics to academics, politics to
metaphysics, SLAC to SMIP.
Gone are the days lack of concern
for any issue more political than
campus liquor police . . . perhaps
too far gone for some. At any
rate, relevance is not the issue.

As the members of the
twenty-one selective fraternities at
Stanford, and many freshmen,
transfer students, and some
upperclassmen are now engaged in
the most active phase of the
selection process unaffectionately
known as Rush, it is perhaps
appropriate to ask certain
fundamental questions about
what is going on: Rush what? And
why "rush" at all? Who's in such a
hurry?
I would like to think that the
freshmen are in no great hurry to
go anywhere—they will encounter
hassles galore all too soon. And as
they advance through the
anxiety-filled years of their
undergraduate career, they will
surely at some time find rushing
an inevitability. Deliberate retreat
into idleness and indolence will
become more and more difficult,
and commensurately more
luxurious. But for the present,
they seem happy with their lot in
campus life, and tend to be
unconcerned with controlling
their future insofar as that's
possible.
Upperclassmen share a
different situation—either they
have found their existential niche
in life and are consumed by the
seemingly interminable activities,
both academic and otherwise,
which they seem necessary for the
eventual realization of their
manifest destiny; or through
constant effort and diligent
self-deception, they have
"escaped" the university/real
world dilemma and find
themselves randomly tossed about
in the existential maelstrom,
obsessed with their impotence and
the futility of everything.
So by his senior year, one
finds that either one has the
diploma in the back pocket and a
foot in the back door of graduate
school, business, or industry, or
one is about to be expelled as an
immiscible drop into the stream
of life outside. Thus, one the one
hand, rushing becomes a necessary
way of life and is accepted as
readily as smog and rush-hour
traffic, or else it is a nonsensical
and useless waste of metabolic
energy which simply adds more
random motion to the existing
chaos. (Certainly a continuum of
all degrees exists within this range,
but somehow, the most notable
cases exists within this range, but
somehow, the most notable cases
always seem to fall in the
extremes.)
Rush No Picnic
So what does all this have to
do with fraternities and Rush and
freshmen, anyway? Well, in my
estimation, plenty. First of all,
Rush has to be a bilateral process
of communcation and
familiarization if it is to have
success. That means equal effort
by both parties —and there's no
use kidding yourself that Rush
isn't work and lots of it. In this
light, I think the "haste
syndrome" goes a long way
toward explaining (1) why Rush is
difficult for the freshmen, (2)
why it's no picnic for the
fraternities, and (3) why
fraternities at Stanford have

suffered from illusory images and
misconceptions for several years.
When spring's Uionysian
euphoria descends upon the Farm
and particularly its freshmen folk,
who cares about next year's living
situation, anyway? Certainly open
houses offer little competition to
the more appealing call of the
wild issued forth by the sun, surf,
sand, and suds; and numerous
attractive socio-political issues
abound which are more than eager
to absorb the entirety of one's
energies. Even those who are less
engaged in campus activities often
find Rush somewhat irrelevant
and inconvenient in the context
of their current social life and
other activities in the dorms. In
short, the motivation is lacking;
most freshmen are not quite yet
caught up in the mad dash of
academia and its extracurricular
involvements. For them, the
payoff of Rush is rather vague and
distant, if not completely elusive.
Secondly, an open house is no
fraternity's idea of an
actionpacked, fun-filled evening
of revelry, either! Most likely, the
experience is equally, if not more
uncomfortable for actives than for
rushees; and certainly it is no
more stimulating or exciting for
either after two or three years.
Many houses have some difficulty
enforcing attendance policies at
Rush functions; the actives seem
to be either too busy doing
something else— booking, classes,
speeches, meetings, etc—or simply
too lacadaisical and apathetic to
do anything at all. That is, either
the "rush syndrome" has got
them tied up already, or their

reaction to it prevents any further
action.
The only cure I can see is
concern—a concern for survival,
for vitality, for operational
viability in a community which
feels little need for or purpose to
fraternities. The need for this sort
of concern is becoming
increasingly imperative as
financial problems are besetting
many of the houses. Whether the
need will be met must ultimately
be left to the individual
fraternities.
As for image .. . it's a
much-debated, oft-paraded
subject which I would rather
avoid if I did not feel it to be so
blatantly confusing the actual
problems which confront the
fraternities. I am the first to admit
that the 21 fraternities have their
