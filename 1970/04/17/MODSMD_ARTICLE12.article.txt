Speech & Drama
Editor, The Daily:
It is not with little outrage that
I read in The Daily of April 9
about the terrifying cutback and
virtual destruction and
elimination of the Speech and
Drama Department. I use the
word "terrifying" with no
reservations for reasons that were
not explicit in The Daily's
account.
Today, conscientious members
of the academic community are
rightfully concerned with the
military-industrial shroud which
lays claim to the administrative
fibre and decision making bodies
of universities. We have evidenced
majority student and faculty
support for the separation of
Stanford from its
government-supported research
institute. We've recently
awakened to the ills of war
machines on campus. Defense
Department Contracts and ROTC
have become the targets of
university activists throughout the
country.
In the midst of movements to
sever Stanford's ties with ROTC

and the government, the
university's administration has
taken another major step in the
violation of the spirit of
democratic education. While
millions of dollars are being spent
in the construction of aerospace
and electronic facilities, the

Speech and Drama Department,
which teaches one-sixth of the
undergraduates at Stanford
yearly, is being eliminated. As Dr.
Kenneth Mosier, Director of
Forensics noted, "The problem
probably is that we just don't
produce scientific grants."
BEWARE of the precedent
implicit in the university's
cutback of the Speech and Drama
Department. Shall we witness, in
the near future, similar cutbacks
in all Humanities and Social
Sciences that do not guarantee
near self-sufficience through
government contracts? Certainly,
it is the responsibility of the
university, and particularly a
university that honors the ideal of
liberal education, to subsidize
pure departments that exist free
from government pimping.
As members of the Stanford
community it is our responsibility
to protest the outrageous cutback
of Speech and Drama funds. We
must act to preserve pure and free
departments if we are ever to
realize a free and pure university.

Editor, The Daily:
I feel it necessary to defend one
of my anonymous columns for
Mike Wolf's attempt to discredit it
using his carefully worded
statements on DMS's and first
branch choices. The same
statistics he cited also show that
of the 44 fourth year Stanford
Army ROTC cadets, 10 were
designated Distinguished Military
Students and 34 were not. Of the
10 DMS's 9 (90%) received their
first branch choice while 16 (48%)
of the 34 non-DMS's received
their first branch choice. Despite
the unusually large number ot
non-DMS's who received their
first choice, it is quite obvious
that the Army favors DMS's in
assigning branches, and that this
in itself constitutes a strong
coercive force on Cadets to
carefully conform to the Army's
expectations.
Mr. Wolf also states that since
its inception in 1964 the punitive
clause has never been invoked by
the Stanford Army ROTC on any
cadet. Despite this, the mere fact
that the punitive clause does exist

in every cadet's contract, and can
be invoked if the cadet leaves the
program, never really gives a third
or fourth year cadet a free choice
in deciding whether to continue in
ROTC. The fact that it can be
invoked by will by the ROTC
department hangs over each
individual cadet's head even
though the punitive clause has not
yet been used at Stanford since its
inception. No one knows how
many cadets may have decided
against quitting ROTC solely
because of the punitive clause.
Sometimes two years of ROTC
training is still not enough time to
decide whether to remain in the
program. It certainly wasn't
enough time for me to decide.

ROTC Comment
Editor, The Daily :
The comment in the next to
last paragraph of the article
"Cadet Morale High Despite
Protests" carries a completely
incorrect connotation. I indicated
to the reporter, Mr. Cedarbaum,
that the Army desired to keep
ROTC at Stanford because of the

quality of the graduates
indicating their performance on
active duty - and for that reason
had worked out a package of
conditions which, after the Senate
and Council Action, appeared to
satisfy the requirements of the
University and, in the Army's
view, established minimum
conditions for the effective
functioning of an Army ROTC
program here.
I referred to the importance of
credit in the eyes of students and
Stanford's liberal credit policies. I
also made specific mention of the
procedures for undergraduate
specials and to the newly formed
Student Center for Innovation
and Research. I stated that we
understood that we start with no
credit for courses taught by the
military officers and that
decisions as to whether credit or
no credit would be dependent on
the academic validity of our
courses as determined by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.

the near future, similar cutbacks
in all Humanities and Social
Sciences that do not guarantee
near self-sufficience through

it is the responsibility of the
university, and particularly a
university that honors the ideal of
liberal education, to subsidize
pure departments that exist free
from government pimping.

Editor, The Daily:
I feel it necessary to defend one
of my anonymous columns for
Mike Wolf's attempt to discredit it
using his carefully worded
statements on DMS's and first
branch choices. The same
statistics he cited also show that
of the 44 fourth year Stanford
Army ROTC cadets, 10 were
designated Distinguished Military
Students and 34 were not. Of the
10 DMS's 9 (90%) received their
first branch choice while 16 (48%)
of the 34 non-DMS's received
their first branch choice. Despite
the unusually large number ot
non-DMS's who received their
first choice, it is quite obvious
that the Army favors DMS's in
assigning branches, and that this
in itself constitutes a strong
coercive force on Cadets to
carefully conform to the Army's
expectations.
Mr. Wolf also states that since
its inception in 1964 the punitive
clause has never been invoked by
the Stanford Army ROTC on any
cadet. Despite this, the mere fact
that the punitive clause does exist

in every cadet's contract, and can
be invoked if the cadet leaves the
program, never really gives a third
or fourth year cadet a free choice
in deciding whether to continue in
ROTC. The fact that it can be
invoked by will by the ROTC
department hangs over each
individual cadet's head even
though the punitive clause has not
yet been used at Stanford since its
inception. No one knows how
many cadets may have decided
against quitting ROTC solely
because of the punitive clause.
Sometimes two years of ROTC
training is still not enough time to
decide whether to remain in the
program. It certainly wasn't
enough time for me to decide.

ROTC Comment
Editor, The Daily :
The comment in the next to
last paragraph of the article
"Cadet Morale High Despite
Protests" carries a completely
incorrect connotation. I indicated
to the reporter, Mr. Cedarbaum,
that the Army desired to keep
ROTC at Stanford because of the

quality of the graduates
indicating their performance on
active duty - and for that reason
had worked out a package of
conditions which, after the Senate
and Council Action, appeared to
satisfy the requirements of the
University and, in the Army's
view, established minimum
conditions for the effective
functioning of an Army ROTC
program here.
I referred to the importance of
credit in the eyes of students and
Stanford's liberal credit policies. I
also made specific mention of the
procedures for undergraduate
specials and to the newly formed
Student Center for Innovation
and Research. I stated that we
understood that we start with no
credit for courses taught by the
military officers and that
decisions as to whether credit or
no credit would be dependent on
the academic validity of our
courses as determined by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.

Editor, The Daily:
It is not with little outrage that
I read in The Daily of April 9
about the terrifying cutback and
virtual destruction and
elimination of the Speech and
Drama Department. I use the
word "terrifying" with no
reservations for reasons that were
not explicit in The Daily's
account.
Today, conscientious members
of the academic community are
rightfully concerned with the
military-industrial shroud which
lays claim to the administrative
fibre and decision making bodies
of universities. We have evidenced
majority student and faculty
support for the separation of
Stanford from its
government-supported research
institute. We've recently
awakened to the ills of war
machines on campus. Defense
Department Contracts and ROTC
have become the targets of
university activists throughout the
country.
In the midst of movements to
sever Stanford's ties with ROTC

and the government, the
university's administration has
taken another major step in the
violation of the spirit of
democratic education. While
millions of dollars are being spent
in the construction of aerospace
and electronic facilities, the

Speech and Drama Department,
which teaches one-sixth of the
undergraduates at Stanford
yearly, is being eliminated. As Dr.
Kenneth Mosier, Director of
Forensics noted, "The problem
probably is that we just don't
produce scientific grants."
BEWARE of the precedent
implicit in the university's
cutback of the Speech and Drama
Department. Shall we witness, in
the near future, similar cutbacks
in all Humanities and Social
Sciences that do not guarantee
near self-sufficience through

Mr. Wolf also states that since
its inception in 1964 the punitive
clause has never been invoked by
the Stanford Army ROTC on any
cadet. Despite this, the mere fact
that the punitive clause does exist

in every cadet's contract, and can
be invoked if the cadet leaves the
program, never really gives a third
or fourth year cadet a free choice
in deciding whether to continue in
ROTC. The fact that it can be
invoked by will by the ROTC
department hangs over each
individual cadet's head even
though the punitive clause has not
yet been used at Stanford since its
inception. No one knows how
many cadets may have decided
against quitting ROTC solely
because of the punitive clause.
Sometimes two years of ROTC
training is still not enough time to
decide whether to remain in the
program. It certainly wasn't
enough time for me to decide.

ROTC Comment
Editor, The Daily :
The comment in the next to
last paragraph of the article
"Cadet Morale High Despite
Protests" carries a completely
incorrect connotation. I indicated
to the reporter, Mr. Cedarbaum,
that the Army desired to keep
ROTC at Stanford because of the

quality of the graduates
indicating their performance on
active duty - and for that reason
had worked out a package of
conditions which, after the Senate
and Council Action, appeared to
satisfy the requirements of the
University and, in the Army's
view, established minimum
conditions for the effective
functioning of an Army ROTC
program here.
I referred to the importance of
credit in the eyes of students and
Stanford's liberal credit policies. I
also made specific mention of the
procedures for undergraduate
specials and to the newly formed
Student Center for Innovation
and Research. I stated that we
understood that we start with no
credit for courses taught by the
military officers and that
decisions as to whether credit or
no credit would be dependent on
the academic validity of our
courses as determined by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.

Speech & Drama
Editor, The Daily:
It is not with little outrage that
I read in The Daily of April 9
about the terrifying cutback and
virtual destruction and
elimination of the Speech and
Drama Department. I use the
word "terrifying" with no
reservations for reasons that were
not explicit in The Daily's
account.
Today, conscientious members
of the academic community are
rightfully concerned with the
military-industrial shroud which
lays claim to the administrative
fibre and decision making bodies
of universities. We have evidenced
majority student and faculty
support for the separation of
Stanford from its
government-supported research
institute. We've recently
awakened to the ills of war
machines on campus. Defense
Department Contracts and ROTC
have become the targets of
university activists throughout the
country.
In the midst of movements to
sever Stanford's ties with ROTC

and the government, the
university's administration has
taken another major step in the
violation of the spirit of
democratic education. While
millions of dollars are being spent
in the construction of aerospace
and electronic facilities, the

Speech and Drama Department,
which teaches one-sixth of the
undergraduates at Stanford
yearly, is being eliminated. As Dr.
Kenneth Mosier, Director of
Forensics noted, "The problem
probably is that we just don't
produce scientific grants."
BEWARE of the precedent
implicit in the university's
cutback of the Speech and Drama
Department. Shall we witness, in
the near future, similar cutbacks
in all Humanities and Social
Sciences that do not guarantee
near self-sufficience through
government contracts? Certainly,
it is the responsibility of the
university, and particularly a
university that honors the ideal of
liberal education, to subsidize
pure departments that exist free
from government pimping.
As members of the Stanford
community it is our responsibility
to protest the outrageous cutback
of Speech and Drama funds. We
must act to preserve pure and free
departments if we are ever to
realize a free and pure university.

Unknown Soldier
Editor, The Daily:
I feel it necessary to defend one
of my anonymous columns for
Mike Wolf's attempt to discredit it
using his carefully worded
statements on DMS's and first
branch choices. The same
statistics he cited also show that
of the 44 fourth year Stanford
Army ROTC cadets, 10 were
designated Distinguished Military
Students and 34 were not. Of the
10 DMS's 9 (90%) received their
first branch choice while 16 (48%)
of the 34 non-DMS's received
their first branch choice. Despite
the unusually large number ot
non-DMS's who received their
first choice, it is quite obvious
that the Army favors DMS's in
assigning branches, and that this
in itself constitutes a strong
coercive force on Cadets to
carefully conform to the Army's
expectations.
Mr. Wolf also states that since
its inception in 1964 the punitive
clause has never been invoked by
the Stanford Army ROTC on any
cadet. Despite this, the mere fact
that the punitive clause does exist

in every cadet's contract, and can
be invoked if the cadet leaves the

or fourth year cadet a free choice
