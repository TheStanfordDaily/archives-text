# One Man's Phantazie
## How To Really 'Do It' 
### Nick Selby 
A voice has come, a presence bearing light,
bringing peace and freedom. Long have I
wondered how to do it. Now the Messiah speaks:
"First of ALL, I, I who have done it, command
that you follow: Suspend everything and float.
You shall see why in a short time. C.F. Charles
Dickens' commandment, "Do men, for they will
do you."
"You are about to discover what everyone has
been too frightened to admit: you are not, and
never have been, alove!
"Each of you, in your own lifetimes of
phantazie, imagines that you are real. What is
worse, you imagine that somehow you matter
somewhere to someone. To quote the essence of
your Grace Slick, "you're passing through . . . the
ridiculous yea ..."
"Descartes laid the framework for your
non-existence. The famous cogito (I think,
therefore I am) was the first of many absurdities in
Western thought. Descartes thought — this is why
he is dead.
"He was afraid to perceive the transparency of
his own biilliance. The more correct mirror of
your uncertainty about life is the dictum: I think I
think, therefore I think I am. Nothing is sure, you
cannot even be sure you are thinking, especially
when you think about it.
"As spirits and phantoms, products of your
own whimsy, you learn the uncertainties of all life.
The telephone goes on the blink, lines are
disconnected, streets are torn up, trees are cut
down. Never an explanation, never, for
unhappiness and despair.
"What is your love, then, but a search for
absolute certainty? You look for what you
yourself cannot give, even if you most want to.
The search is so ill-defined and so limitless in its
possibilities that you are doomed to frustration
and emotional calamity. Plagued by appearances
and illusions, themselves the result of what passes
for thought, you delude and deceive yourselves,
groping in the dark for someone to "Turst."

"You want to disagree. Nothing is so
frightening as the collapse of crystalline love
castles. However, you must face it: even when you
speak to another, that other may not be listening.
You probably don't mean a word you say. You
could both be worlds apart while sleeping next to
each other. These fears haunt you all.
"Your perceptions of the other are limited by
what you imagine he is thinking. The miracle is
that you continue 'living' this way. You never
know what the other person really thinks, even if
he tells you, because you cannot know exactly
how you know what he says. For your perceptions
of yourself are themselves false
"I will tell you how to 'Do it!' The thinking
person immediately questions, "What does this
mean? Do what?" He may perhaps think that he is
to "do" "it" as "it" presents "itself" to him (or
what he thinks he thinks he thinks ... he is)
wherever he "is" or thinks he thinks (infinitely) he
is. "Don't you see? The very act of thinking is
what oppresses you so mightily. In short, do not
think. Do not even think about what you are going
to "do". Just "do".
"And now the master's step: once you have
ceased to think, you will realize that you have
never really been alive! You will realize this the
moment you are no longer capable of realizing
anything.
"It was only by the sheer power of thought
that you posited yourself in that cosmos, in that
world and country. You need not continue 'living'
there. You need not continue 'living!'
"Only by "doing" can there be an is. Bust a
window! Burn a bank! Be! Only in "doing" is
there "being." If you think you are, you most
certainly are not; and if you stop being an are not,
then, baby, you "is."
