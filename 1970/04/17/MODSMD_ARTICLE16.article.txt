# S.F. Rally
## Moratorium....Exercise In Futility? 
### JESSE CEDARBAUM 
As the sun rose Wednesday
morning on Frost Amphitheater,
eight thousand people rejoiced
with the cast of Hair, danced
gleefully to the sounds of the rock
bands, and, blisfully stoned,
ignored the politicians humbly
pledging to do their best to end
the Viet Nam war.
"This is the Revolution,
someone said to me. "It's here —
now!"
And I quietly wondered to
myself how a bunch of stoneys
frolicking in a hole in the ground
somewhere in California was
going to help convince the
imperialist pigs in Washington to
get their snouts out of the other
side of the world. So I went to the
Big City, where the action was
supposed to be.The City
As we approached the Civic
Center Plaza, people were
streaming in from all directions..
The sun was playing
hide-and-go-seek among the
clouds and kids were poking
about on the lawns, trying to find
a place to sit and drink their wine
or munch their lunch. A band was
playing on the stage. In all it
reminded me more of Altamont
or Woodstock than a political
demonstration.
I wandered among the crowd
of lost dogs and people who had
gotten split off from their friends,
waiting for the "important"
speakers — Jean Genet, Father
Groppi, Tom Hay den, and Allen
Ginsberg.
Whiffs of dope and incense
momentarily obscured the usual
city odors, heightening the
holiday atmosphere. There was a
stand giving out bologna and
peanut-butter-and-jelly
sandwiches for whatever small
contribution the buyer could
afford. Peace. Love. The
Woodstock Nation.
Uncaptivating Speakers
Intermingled with the early
bands were a few uncaptivating
speakers who pleaded with the
gathering to support their cause.
Chicanos, Blacks, women's Lib,
welfare people. It all had
something to do with Viet Nam.
Part of the crowd applauded
nicely after each was through,
then dismissed the speaker from
their collective mind.
It' struck me that David
Packard could have gotten up
there and said that if the war
didn't stop soon, he would go out
of his mind trying to figure out
what to do with all his money,
and would have still gotten the
same response.
A police helicopter zoomed in
and began circling overhead. The
master of ceremonies came to the
mike and requested that if there
were any police in the vicinity,
would they please radio that
goddamned helicopter to leave.
Almost immediately, the chopper
buzzed off. I felt that we had
accomplished something.
Everyone was doing his own
little thing. The Krishna monks
set up their camp under some
trees at the back of the square,
where they danced and chanted,
urging curious onlookers to join
them in rejoicing. "You can
accomplish nothing until you
know God," one monk. "Hare
Krishna! Hare Rama!"
Militant Action Encouraged
Finally Father Groppi,
Milwaukee's militant priest, came
forward. Appealing to the crowd's
sympathy for the poor, he
explained that even an end to the
war would hardly provide enough
capital to feed and clothe our

poor. Sympathy was his game.
Encouraging militant action, he
said, "Our Country today is no
better than Nazi Germany before
it slaughtered the Jews. We are
Americans. And we don't want
that kind of thing to happen in
our country. Don't stay in the
park where the Establishment has
you nicely hidden away. Go
march downtown."
A lot of people applauded, but
nobody moved.
Another band came on, then
another speaker. Nobody cared to
listen. They were having a good
time.
Love Machine
Country Joe and the Fish
came on, and people started to
come to life. "I wanna tell ya'
'bout a machine . . . it's not a
Patton tank. It's bigger than
that . . . it's a LOVE machine." A
few stood up and started to dance
and the clapping of hands
reverberated, though weakly, in
the city-canyon. And when the
last noted of "Feelin' like I'm
Fixin' to die Rag" flew out over
the crowd, they were ready for
something.
By this time I had pushed my
way to the foot of the stage. On
the ground in front of the stage
where just about nobody could
see it lay a simple coffin of the
type used to transport bodies
home from Viet Nam, draped in a
soiled American flag. Atop the
coffin were arrayed several medals
which someone told me
represented the thousands that
were turned in by members of the
Movement for a Democratic
Military.
But I barely had time to
contemplate the significance of

this bit of symbolic protest before
Tom Hayden appeared at the
mike. He stood there a moment,
then shouted at the crowd:
"The only total solution to
Nixon's total war is revolution!"
And before anyone could raise a
clenched fist and answer, "Right
on!" he turned and was gone.
A little grandmother asked me
to sign her telegram to the White
House. I obliged her with a smile
and she smiled back non-violently.
At least she was pleased with
herself.
Dan Siegel, ex-president of the
Berkeley student body, was the
next speaker. His vehement
rhetoric echoed hauntingly off the
stone face of City Hall across the
square.
Last Peaceful Kally
"We must move from an era of
peaceful protest and morality to a
period of political struggle and
resistance .. . This is the last
peaceful rally until the war is
over!" he proclaimed. "(We must)
go into the streets and to the
Army bases and tell them that we
will stay there until We get out of
Viet Nam. We're not gonna ask
and pray to end this war any
more. We're gonna close this
country down!
"Power to the People!"
And the crowd echoed,
"Power to the People!"
Feeble Effort
I found myself thinking how
feeble it is to sing songs in hopes
of stopping a war. I began to see
how appealing a revolution could
look, how easy it would be to
move those 10,000 kids (the
papers said 3500, but I don't
believe them) who were sitting

mere eating ineir lunches and
being entertained, how easy they
could be led into the streets, how
they would fit just as nicely
behind barricades as they do in a
city park.
But what would come after
the kind of revolution would it
really be, and what would come
after? Would the new order be
any better than the old? But then
again, how could it be much
worse?
It was late and getting cold. I
went back and found my friends
and then split, without waiting for
Allen Ginsberg, the poet of the
"beat generation" of the '50s to
"Aum" me back into my
apolitical certitude.
In November we had gone
marching so "that" they might see
us. In April we were sitting, no
longer protesting, but listening to
talk of revolution, having seen our
marching to down in history as an
exercise in futility. How long
must we remain frustrated before
King George rears his ugly head
once more, but this time on our
side of the Atlantic?
