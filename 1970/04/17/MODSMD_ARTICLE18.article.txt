# Pauling, Panofsky Discuss SALT Talks
## 
### 
"The U.S. should unilaterally
abstain from further arms
build-up," Nobel Peace Prize
winner Linus Pauling told a panel
discussion on the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) here Wednesday.
"I do not advocate unilateral
disarmament by the U. 5.,"
Pauling added.
Held on the eve of new
strategic arms limitations talks
(SALT) in Vienna, the panel
included Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, a nationally
prominent ABM critic, and Law
School student Thomas Bartman,
a former staff assistant at the
Hudson Institute, who strongly
backed the Safeguard system. Law
Dean Bayless Manning moderated.
Danger Increase
"Continued development of
weapons and defense systems
increases the danger of war
breaking out," Pauling said. "It is
a waste of the resources of the
country which prevents our using
them for the benefit of human
beings as we shouldâ€”to relieve
poverty, unemployment, and to
improve education and housing.
"While there is a balance now
between the U.S. and Soviet
Russia, continued development of
weapons and defense systems
prevents this balance from
becoming stable and increases the
possibility of a devastating war."
Dr. Pauling indicated he had
reluctantly come to the
conclusion that "the statements
of our leaders are not always
reliable, and that there is a
considerable amount of chicanery
in statements about the ABM
system.
"The defense budget is now
$82 billion a year. Much of it is
being wasted and prevents our
attacking other problems, causing
inflation that soaks the poor
instead of the rich.
"We spent $45 billion on
defense contracts," Dr. Pauling
said, "and 89 percent of it without
bids. I can understand why some
people in this country are
opposed to ending the war."

The secrecy inherent in
defense spending permits waste of
a large portion of the money, he
asserted. The defense budget
waste benefits seme people.
"The skullduggery in the
Pentagon wouldn't go on if the
money were spent for schools and
hospitals. There wouldn't be any
secrecy involved, so these people
wouldn't be satisfied with that
kind of spending."
Tragedy of History
Dr. Panofsky, former nuclear
test ban negotiator, said he
"considers the arms race one of
the great tragedies of human
history which the SALT talks
offer some hope of ending."
The Safeguard system which
President Nixon wants to expand
is not only technically ineffective
but will jeopardize the SALT
talks, he said. Moreover the arms
race debates are "shockingly
symmetrical" on both sides of the
iron curtain.
"Russia has the same hawks
and doves making the same
arguments. If our side strengthens
its defense, their side will want to
increase its offensive weaponry.
Our side then counters with
further build-up, and so on.
"By emphasizing the necessity
for Safeguard we are encouraging
the Soviets to increase their
defenses to that level. The Vienna
agreements will set limits on
defensive and offensive weaponry
that may even lead to
de-escalation of the arms race.
"I am apalled that there can
even be argument about whether
the ABM system has escalated the
arms race."
Need for Agreement
Bartman championed the
Safeguard system, both in its
present aim of defending
Minuteman missile sites and its
former objective of protecting
U.S. cities.
