## Apollo Returns Today 
### 
AP - The Apollo 13 pilots, four
harried days behind them, sped
into the last 100,000 miles home
yesterday, their cold and ailing
spaceship aimed at a Friday
splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.
Their speed was picking up in
answer to earth's gravity and they
ironed out plans for a possible
last-minute thruster jolt to aim
their ship more precisely for
landing.
For the astronauts, James A.
Lovell Jr., Fred W. Haise Jr. and
Jack L. Swigert Jr. the small
course correction scheduled for
7:53 a.m. EST Friday is intended
only to refine the ship's aim. It is
already on a path that would land
it in the Pacific without further
adjustment.
In the event Apollo 13 should
need to further conserve its
swindling power supply, the
Stanford University Radar
Astronomy Center's "Big Dish"
antenna is on stand-by to furnish
low-power communications to the
injured craft.
Is la Vista Clash
SANTA BARBARA (AP) - Police
clashed last night with a group of
young people throwing rocks and
bottles at the nearby Isla Vista
Bank of America branch which

replaced the bank burned out by
demonstrators in January.
Police threw "dozens of tear
gas canisters" at the shouting
protestors who had broken
through the chair-link fence
around the prefabricated bank
building.
About 400 students were
gathered near the bank when
officers, riding in groups of ten in
the backs of dump trucks,
converged on the area.
Officers lobbed tear gas
canisters at the students, hitting
some directly.

WASHINGTON AP - Cambodia's
new government, seeking to drive
out North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong invaders, has officially asked
the United States for arms and
material.
The Phnom Penh plea put
President Nixon in a potentially
embarrassing spot both on the
home front and in foreign policy
and the administration is treating
the matter with great caution.
"Their request is being
examined," State Department
spokesman Robert J. McCloskey
said in announcing the Cambodian
bid. He refused further details.
The Cambodian request did not
include a call for U.S. combat
forces, Washington officials said.
They also said that supplying
military assistance to a country
upon its request does not violate
that country's status as a neutral.
Inflation Slays
WASHINGTON AP - Inflation
continued unabated during
January, February and March but
the nation's actual production of
goods and services made its
deepest drop since the last
recession a decade ago, the
government reported Thursday.
Douglas Imjuiry
WASHINGTON AP - Nearly
one-fourth of the House
membership yesterday backed
calls for a special inquiry into
Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas's activities.
Two committees appeared
ready to take a look at
impeachment questions raised
about the 71-year-old jurist.
"Every day that his disruptive
conduct is allowed to continue to
pass unchallenged brings both the
court and thus House into
disrepute," Rep. Louis C. Wyman,
R-N.H., told colleagues.

He introduced a resolution to
create a special six-man
committee to determine whether
any cause exists to impeach the
justice. It is backed by 105 of the
431 House members, mainly
Republicans and Southern
Democrats. There are four
vacancies.
This approach was supported
by House GOP leader Gerald R.
Ford of Michigan who started the
move with a free-swinging attack
on Douglas Wednesday.

court and thus House into

R-N.H., told colleagues.

He introduced a resolution to
create a special six-man
committee to determine whether
any cause exists to impeach the
justice. It is backed by 105 of the
431 House members, mainly
Republicans and Southern
Democrats. There are four

This approach was supported

Ford of Michigan who started the

AP - The Apollo 13 pilots, four
harried days behind them, sped
into the last 100,000 miles home
yesterday, their cold and ailing
spaceship aimed at a Friday
splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.
Their speed was picking up in
answer to earth's gravity and they
ironed out plans for a possible
last-minute thruster jolt to aim
their ship more precisely for
landing.
For the astronauts, James A.
Lovell Jr., Fred W. Haise Jr. and
Jack L. Swigert Jr. the small
course correction scheduled for
7:53 a.m. EST Friday is intended
only to refine the ship's aim. It is
already on a path that would land
it in the Pacific without further
adjustment.
In the event Apollo 13 should
need to further conserve its
swindling power supply, the
Stanford University Radar
Astronomy Center's "Big Dish"
antenna is on stand-by to furnish
low-power communications to the
injured craft.
Is la Vista Clash
SANTA BARBARA (AP) - Police
clashed last night with a group of
young people throwing rocks and
bottles at the nearby Isla Vista
Bank of America branch which

replaced the bank burned out by
demonstrators in January.
Police threw "dozens of tear
gas canisters" at the shouting
protestors who had broken
through the chair-link fence
around the prefabricated bank
building.
About 400 students were
gathered near the bank when
officers, riding in groups of ten in
the backs of dump trucks,
converged on the area.
Officers lobbed tear gas
canisters at the students, hitting
some directly.

WASHINGTON AP - Cambodia's
new government, seeking to drive
out North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong invaders, has officially asked
the United States for arms and
material.
The Phnom Penh plea put
President Nixon in a potentially
embarrassing spot both on the
home front and in foreign policy
and the administration is treating
the matter with great caution.
"Their request is being
examined," State Department
spokesman Robert J. McCloskey
said in announcing the Cambodian
bid. He refused further details.
The Cambodian request did not
include a call for U.S. combat
forces, Washington officials said.
They also said that supplying
military assistance to a country
upon its request does not violate
that country's status as a neutral.
Inflation Slays
WASHINGTON AP - Inflation
continued unabated during
January, February and March but
the nation's actual production of
goods and services made its
deepest drop since the last
recession a decade ago, the
government reported Thursday.
Douglas Imjuiry
WASHINGTON AP - Nearly
one-fourth of the House
membership yesterday backed
calls for a special inquiry into
Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas's activities.
Two committees appeared
ready to take a look at
impeachment questions raised
about the 71-year-old jurist.
