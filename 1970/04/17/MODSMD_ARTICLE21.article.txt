# Grass Roots Members Smash Replica Of Dillingham Project
## 
### 
About 35 persons, most of
them members of Grass Roots, a
radical land use organization,
smashed a plywood replica of
Dillingham Corporation's Palo
Alto Square development
yesterday in the lobby of the
Wells Fargo Bank building in San
Francisco.
The demonstrators then slid
the remains, including the
two-foot-square base of the
replica, under a door leading to
Dillingham's corporate offices.
Waving Vietcong and
Communist Chinese flags, the
demonstrators marched three
miles singing patriotic songs to the
accompanyment of a kazoo and
chanting slogans including:
"2,4,6,8, Organize to smash the
state; 9,7,5,3 Overthrow the
bourgeouise," ''Smash
Dillingham," and "Don't bank on
America."
Reception to the group was
distinctly hostile throughout the
afternoon. Police, who followed
the marchers during most of the
demonstration, were content to
stay in their cars and made no

move to stop the demonstrators.
After travelling to San
Francisco from the Palo Alto
depot on an 11:45 train, the
group marched to the Wells Fargo
Bank building and went directly
to the 31 floor, which is occupied
entirely by Dillingham Corp. and
its subsidaries. After they were
informed that the president was
not in, the demonstrators
returned to the ground floor and
smashed the replica in view of
about 50 amazed onlookers,
mostly businessmen.
The demonstrators then went
back to the thirty-first floor, and
finding Dillingham's doors locked,
slid the pieces under the door, one
by one.
The group then marched to
the Bank of .America Center,
where they gathered for a short
speech by Paul Rupert near an
elevator control panel on the
ground floor. After leaving the
Bank of America, the group
moved across the street to the
Pacific Mutual building, where the

Trustees have a large office on the
ninth floor.
After about 10 minutes, the
group left the building and
marched back through the
financial district, pausing only to
pray for an earthquake in front of
the Wells Fargo Bank building.
