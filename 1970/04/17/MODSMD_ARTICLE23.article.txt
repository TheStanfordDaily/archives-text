## 'Honeymoon Killers' Victimized 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
"The Honeymoon Killers" is a
victim of false advertising, and
unfortunately so. The film
deserves an audience besides the
one attracted by a picture of 200
pound Martha clad in brassiere
and panties with copy that reads:
"You could have read it in the
paper. Maybe you did. He was a
cool cat . . . but cool. She was a
fat chick . . . but fat. They were
lovers who loved honeymoons.
Other people's. From which the
other people never returned."
Beyond the sensational
advertising is an interesting film
that recounts the true life
adventures of Martha Beck and
Raymond Fernandez, known in
the late 40's as the notorious
Lonelyhearts Club Killers. This
black and white, independently
produced film has more style than
many films made for twice the
price.
First Film
"The Honeymoon Killers" is a
first effort by veteran television
producer Warren Steibel and
composer Leonard Kastle, the
film's writer-director. Steibel,
fascinated by the stories of the
murders committed by Beck and
Fernandez, collaborated twenty
years later with Leonard Kastle on
a script written from available
primary sources and records of
the arrest and subsequent trial.
The result is a factual case
study of two alternately normal
and demented individuals. Fat,

lonely Martha (Shirley Stoler) met
gigolo Raymond Fernandez (Tony
Loßianco) through a lonely hearts
correspondence club. ("No more
lonely nights for two lucky
people. Aunt Carrie brought them
together. She can do it for you
too.")
Little did Aunt Carrie know
that she was responsible for
bringing together Fernandez, an
old pro at conning old widows
and spinsters, and lonely nurse
Martha, who, out of passionate
jealousy, insisted that his most
recent victims be permanently
disposed of.
Com incing Performances
The characters of Martha and
Ray, convincingly portrayed by
Stoler and Loßianco, are not
criminals glamorized or
immortalized in the current
Hollywood tradition. Instead,
they are revealed in all their
ugliness in a film that takes almost
a documentary form.
Consistent with its honest
portrayal of the murderers, "The
Honeymoon Killers" depicts the
victims as pathetic creatures who
wouldn't hesitate to marry any
man two days after meeting him.
Unfortunately, they all picked the
wrong one.
The film is neither an
adventure story, nor an analysis of
the morality and constitutionality
of capital punishment. Instead,
"The Honeymoon Killers" is a
"truth is stranger than fiction"
study of two individuals who
killed people and paid for it two

years later in the electric chair at
Sing Sing.
Campus Flicks
Two films will be shown this
Saturday on campus. At 7,8, and
9 in Tresidder, Glauber Rocha's
"Black God, White Devil," the
first important film from the
Novo Cinema movement in Brazil,
will be shown. In Cubberly at 7,
9, and 11, "Black Orpheus" will
be presented by the King Lear
Relief Fund. The $1 admission
will go to the Company's
production of King Lear.
Sunday Flicks
At 7:30 in Memorial
Auditorium, the Sunday Flicks
will feature Steve McQueen doing
a superb imitation of Steve
McQueen as a hip-cop in Peter
Yates' "Bullitt." In the most
exciting car chase sequence on
film, McQueen does his own
driving through the streets of San
Francisco at speeds over 150 mph.
Jacqueline Bissett plays Sex in
this sex and violence thriller.
Robert Vaughn provides comic
relief as a politically ambitious
district attorney. Pat Renella as
Johnny Ross is outstanding in the
scene in which he gets blown
apart by a Winchester pump
shotgun. For some suggested sex
and lots of violence and action,
don't miss Warner Brothers
interpretation of law and disorder
in the City.

"The Honeymoon Killers" is a
victim of false advertising, and
unfortunately so. The film
deserves an audience besides the
one attracted by a picture of 200
pound Martha clad in brassiere
and panties with copy that reads:
"You could have read it in the
paper. Maybe you did. He was a
cool cat . . . but cool. She was a
fat chick . . . but fat. They were
lovers who loved honeymoons.
Other people's. From which the
other people never returned."
Beyond the sensational
advertising is an interesting film
that recounts the true life
adventures of Martha Beck and
Raymond Fernandez, known in
the late 40's as the notorious
Lonelyhearts Club Killers. This
black and white, independently
produced film has more style than
many films made for twice the
price.
First Film
"The Honeymoon Killers" is a
first effort by veteran television
producer Warren Steibel and
composer Leonard Kastle, the
film's writer-director. Steibel,
fascinated by the stories of the
murders committed by Beck and
Fernandez, collaborated twenty
years later with Leonard Kastle on
a script written from available
primary sources and records of
the arrest and subsequent trial.
The result is a factual case
study of two alternately normal
and demented individuals. Fat,

lonely Martha (Shirley Stoler) met
gigolo Raymond Fernandez (Tony
Loßianco) through a lonely hearts
correspondence club. ("No more
lonely nights for two lucky
people. Aunt Carrie brought them
together. She can do it for you
too.")
Little did Aunt Carrie know
that she was responsible for
bringing together Fernandez, an
old pro at conning old widows
and spinsters, and lonely nurse
Martha, who, out of passionate
jealousy, insisted that his most
recent victims be permanently
disposed of.
Com incing Performances
The characters of Martha and
Ray, convincingly portrayed by
Stoler and Loßianco, are not
criminals glamorized or
immortalized in the current
Hollywood tradition. Instead,
they are revealed in all their
ugliness in a film that takes almost
a documentary form.
Consistent with its honest
portrayal of the murderers, "The
Honeymoon Killers" depicts the
victims as pathetic creatures who
wouldn't hesitate to marry any
man two days after meeting him.
Unfortunately, they all picked the
wrong one.
The film is neither an
adventure story, nor an analysis of
the morality and constitutionality
of capital punishment. Instead,
"The Honeymoon Killers" is a
"truth is stranger than fiction"
study of two individuals who
killed people and paid for it two

years later in the electric chair at
Sing Sing.
Campus Flicks
Two films will be shown this
Saturday on campus. At 7,8, and
9 in Tresidder, Glauber Rocha's
"Black God, White Devil," the
first important film from the
Novo Cinema movement in Brazil,
will be shown. In Cubberly at 7,
9, and 11, "Black Orpheus" will
be presented by the King Lear
Relief Fund. The $1 admission
will go to the Company's
production of King Lear.
Sunday Flicks
At 7:30 in Memorial
Auditorium, the Sunday Flicks
will feature Steve McQueen doing
a superb imitation of Steve
McQueen as a hip-cop in Peter
Yates' "Bullitt." In the most
exciting car chase sequence on
film, McQueen does his own
driving through the streets of San
Francisco at speeds over 150 mph.
Jacqueline Bissett plays Sex in
this sex and violence thriller.
Robert Vaughn provides comic
relief as a politically ambitious
district attorney. Pat Renella as
Johnny Ross is outstanding in the
scene in which he gets blown
apart by a Winchester pump
shotgun. For some suggested sex
and lots of violence and action,
don't miss Warner Brothers
interpretation of law and disorder
in the City.
