# ACT Resurrects Smash Hit 'Rosencrantz & Guildenstern'
## 
### GARY SALT 
The American Conservatory
Theatre has wisely chosen to
revive and re-stage its biggest
smash hit of last season. Tom
Stoppard's hilarious "Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are Dead."
"R&G" has been honed down and
tightened up since last year and
it's better for it.
Until Stoppard got his pen in
the picture, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, the young courtier
friends of Hamlet, had been just
two of Shakespeare's thinnest,
most forgettable creations, more
often than not having their
existence relegated to
multiple-choice questions.
Stoppard bodies them out,
three-dimensionalizes them and,
in the process, offers us an ironic
and irreverent perspective on
"Hamlet." Like his two zesty
heroes, we are on the outside
looking in. William Ball's
production leaves no doubt that

Stoppard's play has its own life,
that "Hamlet" provides a frame of
reference to be used but never
seriously explored. Fortunately,
the inevitable and inane
comparisons between Stoppard
and Shakespeare have already
been forgotten.
Dilemma
Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern's dilemma is a classic
one—they don't know what's
going on—summoned in the
middle of the night and told they
are to perform a special
assignment for Claudius, they
remain throughout the play,
"intrigued without ever being
enlightened."
Most of the time "R&G" is a
fast, fast play; the lines have the
juiciness and punch of vaudeville
snappers rendered doubly
successful by the performances of
James Milton and Philip Kerr in
the title roles—two young men as
matched as duelling pistols with
about the same function. Their
shenanigans while trying to
decipher their situation are so
diverting and imaginative that
"incidentals" like Claudius,
Gertrude, or Ophelia tend to clog
up the action.
They are more or less
accompanied on their expedition
to Elsinore by a rag-tag bunch of
actors of the "blood, love, and
rhetoric school," led by ACT
veteran Ken Ruta, black-clad and
spectral, as the Player. The Player
is perhaps one of the finest
comedy roles written for the stage
in recent years and Ruta and Ball
have concocted a brilliant
interpretation in which Ruta
emerges as a kind of diabolical
den-mother to his actors and the
two confused victims.

In a sense, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are genuinely
concerned with and ultimately
exterminated by their condition;
but until their final moments,
people and events pass around
them, barely touching their lives
until it is too late. They are
reduced to question and answer
games with each other, unable to
penetrate Hamlet's irrationality or
language. The games, the
exaggerated strutting to celebrate
hollow victories, virtually all of
Milton and Kerr's interplay result
in many ingeniously comic
moments which still preserve the
essential poignancy of born losers.
One of the most moving scenes
is set aboard ship ostensibly
carrying Rosencrantz,
Guildenstern, and Hamlet to
England. The mood is portentous
and after some swashbuckling
derring-do, the two men realize
they are on their way to their own
end, incapable of stopping it,
incapable of knowing why, yet
committed to playing out the
game. .
Don't be surprised if familiar
images begin surfacing in the
closing moments, images of two
Beckett bums, or of Joe Buck and
Ratso Rizzo on a bus-trip to
Florida, or Billy and Wyatt on a
death-trip through the South.
Certainly no writer, director, or
media has squatter's rights on a
theme—friendship and death are
part of us all. Bill Ball and Tom
Stoppard are their own men and
their "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern" presents a witty,
moving, and memorable point of
view that is worth seeing.

media has squatter's rights on a
theme—friendship and death are
part of us all. Bill Ball and Tom
Stoppard are their own men and
their "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern" presents a witty,
moving, and memorable point of
view that is worth seeing.
Eight-thirty, next Friday and
Saturday, at the Geary Theatre.
The American Conservatory
Theatre has wisely chosen to
revive and re-stage its biggest
smash hit of last season. Tom
Stoppard's hilarious "Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are Dead."
"R&G" has been honed down and
tightened up since last year and
it's better for it.
Until Stoppard got his pen in
the picture, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, the young courtier
friends of Hamlet, had been just
two of Shakespeare's thinnest,
most forgettable creations, more
often than not having their
existence relegated to
multiple-choice questions.
Stoppard bodies them out,
three-dimensionalizes them and,
in the process, offers us an ironic
and irreverent perspective on
"Hamlet." Like his two zesty
heroes, we are on the outside
looking in. William Ball's
production leaves no doubt that

Stoppard's play has its own life,
that "Hamlet" provides a frame of
reference to be used but never
seriously explored. Fortunately,
the inevitable and inane
comparisons between Stoppard
and Shakespeare have already
been forgotten.
Dilemma
Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern's dilemma is a classic
one—they don't know what's
going on—summoned in the
middle of the night and told they
are to perform a special
assignment for Claudius, they
remain throughout the play,
"intrigued without ever being
enlightened."
Most of the time "R&G" is a
fast, fast play; the lines have the
juiciness and punch of vaudeville
snappers rendered doubly
successful by the performances of
James Milton and Philip Kerr in
the title roles—two young men as
matched as duelling pistols with
about the same function. Their
shenanigans while trying to
decipher their situation are so
diverting and imaginative that
"incidentals" like Claudius,
Gertrude, or Ophelia tend to clog
up the action.
They are more or less
accompanied on their expedition
to Elsinore by a rag-tag bunch of
actors of the "blood, love, and
rhetoric school," led by ACT
veteran Ken Ruta, black-clad and
spectral, as the Player. The Player
is perhaps one of the finest
comedy roles written for the stage
in recent years and Ruta and Ball
have concocted a brilliant
interpretation in which Ruta
emerges as a kind of diabolical
den-mother to his actors and the
two confused victims.

In a sense, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are genuinely
concerned with and ultimately
exterminated by their condition;
but until their final moments,
people and events pass around
them, barely touching their lives
until it is too late. They are
reduced to question and answer
games with each other, unable to
penetrate Hamlet's irrationality or
language. The games, the
exaggerated strutting to celebrate
hollow victories, virtually all of
Milton and Kerr's interplay result
in many ingeniously comic
moments which still preserve the
essential poignancy of born losers.
One of the most moving scenes
is set aboard ship ostensibly
carrying Rosencrantz,
Guildenstern, and Hamlet to
England. The mood is portentous
and after some swashbuckling
derring-do, the two men realize
they are on their way to their own
end, incapable of stopping it,
incapable of knowing why, yet
committed to playing out the
game. .
Don't be surprised if familiar
images begin surfacing in the
closing moments, images of two
Beckett bums, or of Joe Buck and
Ratso Rizzo on a bus-trip to
Florida, or Billy and Wyatt on a
death-trip through the South.
Certainly no writer, director, or
media has squatter's rights on a
theme—friendship and death are
part of us all. Bill Ball and Tom
Stoppard are their own men and
