## Overdone Return To Woodstock 
### BISON HORNSBY 
South Florida has been the
scene of much psychedelia ever
since Freddie Cannon's immortal:
"She's my Tallahassee lassie/Way
down in F.L.A." Christmas of
1968, found the city astir over the
artistry of the Door's Jim
Morison. Yes, the city father
found his art so revealing that
they initiated proceedings to have
him do a return engagement of
sorts. For those of you with a
polemic interest, these
proceedings are called extradition.
Morison's new forms of
expression stimulated both
rejection and emulation in the
local art world. His neo-Cubist
(with influences from Dada
clear y evident) on-stage
simulation of oral intercourse was
done with such a graceful,
intuitive "hand" that the seed was
planted in his disciples.
One event fostered by this
cutting edge in the vanguard of
new art media was brought to life
by Anita Bryant and Jackie
Gleason, well-known Miami-based
romatic impressionists. Using
splashes of Orange in a rendition
of a Bowl entitled "Rally for
Decency," they evoked a vivid
picture of American life gone by.
West Palm Beach and
Hallandale have been the scene of
the world's most-hassled rock
festivals. The police have shown
incredible insensitivity in lumping
the followers of rock culture with
the Fort Lauderdale crowd.
Regular events in these
festival/rituals are pre-dawn busts
of the promoters, day-before
revokation of the permits, police
assertions that dopers will not be
tolerated, racial innuendoes, and
radio editorials on the decline and
fall of the Roman Empire.
Woodstock II its IYI iami
It is easy to understand,
therefore, why I would seek out
this exciting Mecca of the rock
world to pass my all-too-brief
Spring vacation. My faith was of
course justified by the ineluctible
wisdom of the media world. The
movie Woodstock was there and
playing tq packed houses long
before backward West Coast
centers would be ready for it. I
confess that, accustomed to Bay
Area morays, I wasn't ready for
the $4 per seat ticket price.
The theater manager trundled
down the aisle and announced to
the assembled throng, whose
average age dealt a death-blow to
the R rating of this exploitation
flick, that the city fathers of Coral
Gables (the Orange County of
Southern Florida) would not
allow him to more of these
exploitation films if anyone
smoked their stashes of Rhode
Apple Red.
This disappointed me greatly
as my neighbor had intimated that
his was "straight from Uncle Ho's
victory gardens," and you can
imagine my excitement. After
flashing the peace sign (or was it
the Nixon victory sign?), the
paunchy manager allowed the
flick to begin and therefore was
not molested by the fans. With the
dismal prospects of a dry movie,
the audience tried to get high on
the $1.25 gourmet tub of
popcorn.
Flick is A Must
The film of course is a
must-see; even at the incredible
ticket prices. Anyone who had
been there will be curious to see
how well the community
experience was captured, and
those of us who were not, need to
see what we missed. The movie
projects a much more clear
impression of the event than did
radio and newspaper accounts but
will be a disappointment to
anyone who expects to transcend
the celluloid and really relive
those halcyon days. This is not to
say that it was not fascinating; the
audience around me was
completely transfixed—no one
spoke or coughed or wiggled
around; in fact, only I noticed the
deft "popcorn ploy" made in the
row in front of me. Instead of
grooving, people were detached
and observing.
As Sly and the Family Stone
sent everyone "Higher," the
theater audience remained
curiously and uncomfortably
earth-bound. Country Joe did a
solo version of "I Feel like I'm
fixin' to Die Rag" that was
incredibly exciting and had the
always-tumultuous fans in an
absolute frenzy.
Suddenly, lyrics complete with
a bouncing ball appeared on the

screen vainly encouraging the
theater audience to join in. I
couldn't decide whether the
Miami crowd was embarrassed or
just didn't know the song. It will
be interesting to view it again in
San Francisco (when it opens on
the 30th.) On these and several
other occasions, speakers by the
candy stand were turned on with
heavily reverbered audience
noises. The effect was great; but
the moments when they were
turned on was horribly
disconcerting — audience
manipulation right out of Orwell's
1984; Constant use of this
expanded audio medium is
coming, and perhaps it will be less
distracting if it is left on from the
start of the movie.
Production Problems
This problem was indicative of
what I felt was the primary
question facing the producers;
what were they trying to do and
show in their presentation of the
festival? Were they to be artists or
chroniclers? Before going, I hoped
for more than a lavishly filmed
Monterey Pop; I am not sure that
we got it —make your own
decision, as I'm tired of trying to
ascribe artistry to the better parts
and forgiving the bad rock-cinema
cliches.
Their efforts to put across a
feeling for the sub-culture, its
interaction with New York
community, and the events
themselves had mixed results.
There were too many predictable
interviews with very predictable
points made; when they did get
into good things like a mudsliding
game, they overdid them.
Overdone
Overdone is really key to this
movie; director Michael Wadleigh
seemed to come with no new
ideas about Woodstock nor any
innovative presentation
techniques. The hype we got from
Warner Bros. included two
complete listings of the arsenal of
equipment used in the filming (if
this interests you, call us) and the
suggestion that Wadleigh may
have shot up more film that any
other '27-year-old extant.
Most of the music scenes
suffered from a lack of direction;
Wadleigh evidentally instructed
his creds to keep shooting if they
found something they liked, and
so we are often blessed with three
views (split-screen) of the lead
singer and only occasional
glimpses of the other band
members.
Visual Integrity
Visually, the integrity of a
rock group is important; lead
singers look silly unless properly
framed. Jimi Hendrix and the
Who were the clearest examples of
this; the Who is one of the most
exciting visual acts anywhere, but
three views of Roger Daltry is
more than we need. Even
Monterey Pop did a better job of
keeping Peter Townsend and the
others involved. Only Sly Stone
and Alvin Lee of Ten Year's After
were exciting enough to withstand
this treatment. Sha-Na-Na moved
around too fast to be hacked up
into pieces; that really would have
been awful! This did bring out,
however, that Carlos San tana
makes silly faces while playing his
riffs.
Spaced Music
Another questionable decision
was the attempt to give a feeling
for chronological order by spacing
out the music with interviews,
intercourse, and other interplay.
Some highlights of this included
interviews with townspeople, who
gave an interesting
non-Eastern-intellectual view of
cultural trends signified in the
festival. There were dangerous
overtones of indulgence —given
music, drugs, and a change to age,
and they-will-grow-out-of-it. The
squall of bad weather which
brought the rains was both
fascinating and slightly scary.
Unfortunately, it was poorly
edited and drags—you wind up
bored. The fact the concert was
free for many was handled much
more cleverly in a rap with two
kids who had come without
tickets than in sequences showing
the freebie announcement or the
broken fences. Things I'll be
happy to never watch again were
the cleaning of a chemical toilet
and a girl shaving her
armpits—yuck! Several short
interviews with the promoters left
me uncertain as to whether they
were inarticulate or just hostile.
Filmed Perform a noes
In sudden concern for space, I
will assume that vou are familiar

with the performing style of the
groups, and merely recount how
the film seemed to affect it.
Country Joe (with the Fish this
time) got cut off in the middle of
Rock'N'Soul music which was
unfortunate. There was too much
Joan Baez and Richie Havens,
who beat his guitar senseless while
his backup ground on and grinned
mindlessly. John Sebastian
mouthed banalities and came off
silly instead of as the sensitive
artist he is reputed to be. He, Arlo
Guthrie, and Crosby, Stills, all
seemed very ingenuous; yet all but
Sebastian came over well. Crosby
et al were the closest to a live
performance of any group
presented. Santana was a vehicle
for an especially effective drum
solo and a lot of national
exposure for Bill Graham. Jimi
Hendrix closed on a dreary
morning with his super-freaky
version of the "Star-Spangled
Banner" and performed without
his customary excitement. Those
were his Band of Gypsies days,
and let's hope they're gone
forever.
Daylight was a factor for
everybody; despite the lack of a
"light show" evening
performances seemed to be more
exciting (fewer distractions), and
what lighting they did use was
especially effective on the Who,
Ten Year's After, and Sly.
Sha-Na-Na came off well on a
sunny morning (maybe 1950's
rock satire could go well
anytime), and the Grease Band
trying to sound like a girl's chorus
behind Joe Cocker was most
amusing to watch.
Few Croups Pictured
You'll be disappointed that

only 13 of the more than 30
groups were presented; the
omissions were incredible. Short
walk-ons by Grace and Janis
(there were others, but I was
pretty distracted by the guy with
the popcorn) were the only hints
of those notable acts. I especially
wanted to see The Band as they
were supposed to have really
dominated the serious musicians
present.
(Jreat Spring in Local Rock
Last Sunday, Elvin Bishop
stole the show before a packed
and friendly audience at Frost.
Dan Hicks, Aum, and Cold Blood
were all "just right" for a
beautiful afternoon. I won't even
try to comment on the one
man/one woman onslaught which
calls itself Lamb—is it art or is it
pretention?
Wednesday at Frost, the
audience was especially warm for
the 6 a.m. performance by the
cast of Hair. Their exuberance and
talent made up for the "thin"
material and the tight but far
from heavy back-up band. Many
split before the political speeches
(to go to 7 :30 classes?), but those
that stayed saw three more
competent acts.
The evening show at

Winterland was really great. The
Dead, the Airplane, and
Quicksilver, all played long sets
and Bill Graham was not to be
seen! Between sets, some cat from
Studio 759 (the Radical
Laboratories) played Moog
synthesizer at ear-busting volume
levels. Several of his crescendoes
excited the fans. Quicksilver
played a great 1:50 set in spite of
the equipment trouble that they
always seem to have, and Dino
Valente (wrote "Get Together")
and Nicky Hopkins are very much
integrated into the sound. They
whipped the audience into a
dither with "Edward, The Mad
Shirtgrinder" and just wouldn't
let us down with the best version
of "Who Do You Love" that I've
ever heard them do.
Slick at Winterland
Grace got the sound man to
turn her mike up to near feedback
(which in Winterland is reeaalllly
loud) and Marty Balin made
several determined efforts to
drown her out. The new drummer
made little difference in their
sound though he was hard to hear
over those voices. They did
mostly familiar material in the
same good old way, though there
was a nice new song called
"Mexico."
Get in on all these good
sounds by going to Fillmore West
to see John Mayall (Mr. White
Blues, also Mr. Ego) with Duster
Bennett, Larry Coryell, and
Argent (led by Rod Argent,
former keyboard genius of the
Zombies). The Youngbloods will
be at Santa Clara on Saturday
night. Also Sat., a fabulous revival
at the Berkeley Community
Theater with Chuck Berry, Bill
Haley, the Coasters, Gary (US)
Bonds ("Quarter to Three"), and
Bo Diddely. Tickets may be had
for $3.50 to $5.50, at Sears and
the Emporium. Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young will have an
end-of-the-month concert at the
Fillmore so save your money
'cause Bill won't let you in free.

interviews with very predictable
points made; when they did get
into good things like a mudsliding
game, they overdid them.
Overdone
Overdone is really key to this
movie; director Michael Wadleigh
seemed to come with no new
ideas about Woodstock nor any
innovative presentation
techniques. The hype we got from
Warner Bros. included two
complete listings of the arsenal of
equipment used in the filming (if
this interests you, call us) and the
suggestion that Wadleigh may
have shot up more film that any
other '27-year-old extant.
Most of the music scenes
suffered from a lack of direction;
Wadleigh evidentally instructed
his creds to keep shooting if they
found something they liked, and
so we are often blessed with three
views (split-screen) of the lead
singer and only occasional
glimpses of the other band
members.
Visual Integrity
Visually, the integrity of a
rock group is important; lead
singers look silly unless properly
framed. Jimi Hendrix and the
Who were the clearest examples of
this; the Who is one of the most
exciting visual acts anywhere, but
three views of Roger Daltry is
more than we need. Even
Monterey Pop did a better job of
keeping Peter Townsend and the
others involved. Only Sly Stone
and Alvin Lee of Ten Year's After
were exciting enough to withstand
this treatment. Sha-Na-Na moved
around too fast to be hacked up
into pieces; that really would have
been awful! This did bring out,
however, that Carlos San tana
makes silly faces while playing his
riffs.
Spaced Music
Another questionable decision
was the attempt to give a feeling
for chronological order by spacing
out the music with interviews,
intercourse, and other interplay.
Some highlights of this included
interviews with townspeople, who
gave an interesting
non-Eastern-intellectual view of
cultural trends signified in the
festival. There were dangerous
overtones of indulgence —given
music, drugs, and a change to age,
and they-will-grow-out-of-it. The
squall of bad weather which
brought the rains was both
fascinating and slightly scary.
Unfortunately, it was poorly
edited and drags—you wind up
bored. The fact the concert was
free for many was handled much
more cleverly in a rap with two
kids who had come without
tickets than in sequences showing
the freebie announcement or the
broken fences. Things I'll be
happy to never watch again were
the cleaning of a chemical toilet
and a girl shaving her
armpits—yuck! Several short
interviews with the promoters left
me uncertain as to whether they
were inarticulate or just hostile.
Filmed Perform a noes
In sudden concern for space, I
will assume that vou are familiar

with the performing style of the
groups, and merely recount how
the film seemed to affect it.
Country Joe (with the Fish this
time) got cut off in the middle of
Rock'N'Soul music which was
unfortunate. There was too much
Joan Baez and Richie Havens,
who beat his guitar senseless while
his backup ground on and grinned
mindlessly. John Sebastian
mouthed banalities and came off
silly instead of as the sensitive
artist he is reputed to be. He, Arlo
Guthrie, and Crosby, Stills, all
seemed very ingenuous; yet all but
Sebastian came over well. Crosby
et al were the closest to a live
performance of any group
presented. Santana was a vehicle
for an especially effective drum
solo and a lot of national
exposure for Bill Graham. Jimi
Hendrix closed on a dreary
morning with his super-freaky
version of the "Star-Spangled
Banner" and performed without
his customary excitement. Those
were his Band of Gypsies days,
and let's hope they're gone
forever.
Daylight was a factor for
everybody; despite the lack of a
"light show" evening
performances seemed to be more
exciting (fewer distractions), and
what lighting they did use was
especially effective on the Who,
Ten Year's After, and Sly.
Sha-Na-Na came off well on a
sunny morning (maybe 1950's
rock satire could go well
anytime), and the Grease Band
trying to sound like a girl's chorus
behind Joe Cocker was most
amusing to watch.
Few Croups Pictured
You'll be disappointed that

only 13 of the more than 30
groups were presented; the
omissions were incredible. Short
walk-ons by Grace and Janis
(there were others, but I was
pretty distracted by the guy with
the popcorn) were the only hints
of those notable acts. I especially
wanted to see The Band as they
were supposed to have really
dominated the serious musicians
present.
(Jreat Spring in Local Rock
Last Sunday, Elvin Bishop
stole the show before a packed
and friendly audience at Frost.
Dan Hicks, Aum, and Cold Blood
were all "just right" for a
beautiful afternoon. I won't even
try to comment on the one
man/one woman onslaught which
calls itself Lamb—is it art or is it
pretention?
Wednesday at Frost, the
audience was especially warm for
the 6 a.m. performance by the
cast of Hair. Their exuberance and
talent made up for the "thin"
material and the tight but far
from heavy back-up band. Many
split before the political speeches
(to go to 7 :30 classes?), but those
that stayed saw three more
competent acts.
The evening show at

Winterland was really great. The
Dead, the Airplane, and
Quicksilver, all played long sets
and Bill Graham was not to be
seen! Between sets, some cat from
Studio 759 (the Radical
Laboratories) played Moog
synthesizer at ear-busting volume
levels. Several of his crescendoes
excited the fans. Quicksilver
played a great 1:50 set in spite of
the equipment trouble that they
always seem to have, and Dino
Valente (wrote "Get Together")
and Nicky Hopkins are very much
integrated into the sound. They
whipped the audience into a
dither with "Edward, The Mad
Shirtgrinder" and just wouldn't
let us down with the best version
of "Who Do You Love" that I've
ever heard them do.
Slick at Winterland
Grace got the sound man to
turn her mike up to near feedback
(which in Winterland is reeaalllly
loud) and Marty Balin made
several determined efforts to
drown her out. The new drummer
made little difference in their
sound though he was hard to hear
over those voices. They did
mostly familiar material in the
same good old way, though there
was a nice new song called
"Mexico."
Get in on all these good
sounds by going to Fillmore West
to see John Mayall (Mr. White
Blues, also Mr. Ego) with Duster
Bennett, Larry Coryell, and
Argent (led by Rod Argent,
former keyboard genius of the
Zombies). The Youngbloods will
be at Santa Clara on Saturday
night. Also Sat., a fabulous revival
at the Berkeley Community
Theater with Chuck Berry, Bill
Haley, the Coasters, Gary (US)
Bonds ("Quarter to Three"), and
Bo Diddely. Tickets may be had
for $3.50 to $5.50, at Sears and
the Emporium. Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young will have an
end-of-the-month concert at the
Fillmore so save your money
'cause Bill won't let you in free.


STONKD- Good vibrations from Sly of the Family stone in 'Woodstock.'
South Florida has been the
scene of much psychedelia ever
since Freddie Cannon's immortal:
"She's my Tallahassee lassie/Way
down in F.L.A." Christmas of
1968, found the city astir over the
artistry of the Door's Jim
Morison. Yes, the city father
found his art so revealing that
they initiated proceedings to have
him do a return engagement of
sorts. For those of you with a
polemic interest, these
proceedings are called extradition.
Morison's new forms of
expression stimulated both
rejection and emulation in the
local art world. His neo-Cubist
(with influences from Dada
clear y evident) on-stage
simulation of oral intercourse was
done with such a graceful,
intuitive "hand" that the seed was
planted in his disciples.
One event fostered by this
cutting edge in the vanguard of
new art media was brought to life
by Anita Bryant and Jackie
Gleason, well-known Miami-based
romatic impressionists. Using
splashes of Orange in a rendition
of a Bowl entitled "Rally for
Decency," they evoked a vivid
picture of American life gone by.
West Palm Beach and
Hallandale have been the scene of
the world's most-hassled rock
festivals. The police have shown
incredible insensitivity in lumping
the followers of rock culture with
the Fort Lauderdale crowd.
Regular events in these
festival/rituals are pre-dawn busts
of the promoters, day-before
revokation of the permits, police
assertions that dopers will not be
tolerated, racial innuendoes, and
radio editorials on the decline and
fall of the Roman Empire.
Woodstock II its IYI iami
It is easy to understand,
therefore, why I would seek out
this exciting Mecca of the rock
world to pass my all-too-brief
Spring vacation. My faith was of
course justified by the ineluctible
wisdom of the media world. The
movie Woodstock was there and
playing tq packed houses long
before backward West Coast
centers would be ready for it. I
confess that, accustomed to Bay
Area morays, I wasn't ready for
the $4 per seat ticket price.
The theater manager trundled
down the aisle and announced to
the assembled throng, whose
average age dealt a death-blow to
the R rating of this exploitation
flick, that the city fathers of Coral
Gables (the Orange County of
Southern Florida) would not
allow him to more of these
exploitation films if anyone
smoked their stashes of Rhode
Apple Red.
This disappointed me greatly
as my neighbor had intimated that
his was "straight from Uncle Ho's
victory gardens," and you can
imagine my excitement. After
flashing the peace sign (or was it
the Nixon victory sign?), the
paunchy manager allowed the
flick to begin and therefore was
not molested by the fans. With the
dismal prospects of a dry movie,
the audience tried to get high on
the $1.25 gourmet tub of
popcorn.
Flick is A Must
The film of course is a
must-see; even at the incredible
ticket prices. Anyone who had
been there will be curious to see
how well the community
experience was captured, and
those of us who were not, need to
see what we missed. The movie
projects a much more clear
impression of the event than did
radio and newspaper accounts but
will be a disappointment to
anyone who expects to transcend
the celluloid and really relive
those halcyon days. This is not to
say that it was not fascinating; the
audience around me was
completely transfixed—no one
spoke or coughed or wiggled
around; in fact, only I noticed the
deft "popcorn ploy" made in the
row in front of me. Instead of
grooving, people were detached
and observing.
As Sly and the Family Stone
sent everyone "Higher," the
theater audience remained
curiously and uncomfortably
earth-bound. Country Joe did a
solo version of "I Feel like I'm
fixin' to Die Rag" that was
incredibly exciting and had the
always-tumultuous fans in an
absolute frenzy.
Suddenly, lyrics complete with
a bouncing ball appeared on the

screen vainly encouraging the
theater audience to join in. I
couldn't decide whether the
Miami crowd was embarrassed or
just didn't know the song. It will
be interesting to view it again in
San Francisco (when it opens on
the 30th.) On these and several
other occasions, speakers by the
candy stand were turned on with
heavily reverbered audience
noises. The effect was great; but
the moments when they were
turned on was horribly
disconcerting — audience
manipulation right out of Orwell's
1984; Constant use of this
expanded audio medium is
coming, and perhaps it will be less
distracting if it is left on from the
start of the movie.
Production Problems
This problem was indicative of
what I felt was the primary
question facing the producers;
what were they trying to do and
show in their presentation of the
festival? Were they to be artists or
chroniclers? Before going, I hoped
for more than a lavishly filmed
Monterey Pop; I am not sure that
we got it —make your own
decision, as I'm tired of trying to
ascribe artistry to the better parts
and forgiving the bad rock-cinema
cliches.
Their efforts to put across a
feeling for the sub-culture, its
interaction with New York
community, and the events
themselves had mixed results.
There were too many predictable
interviews with very predictable
points made; when they did get
into good things like a mudsliding
game, they overdid them.
Overdone
Overdone is really key to this
movie; director Michael Wadleigh

Quicksilver, all played long sets
and Bill Graham was not to be
seen! Between sets, some cat from
Studio 759 (the Radical
Laboratories) played Moog
synthesizer at ear-busting volume
levels. Several of his crescendoes
excited the fans. Quicksilver
played a great 1:50 set in spite of
the equipment trouble that they
always seem to have, and Dino
Valente (wrote "Get Together")
and Nicky Hopkins are very much
integrated into the sound. They
whipped the audience into a
dither with "Edward, The Mad
Shirtgrinder" and just wouldn't
let us down with the best version
of "Who Do You Love" that I've
ever heard them do.
Slick at Winterland
Grace got the sound man to
turn her mike up to near feedback
(which in Winterland is reeaalllly
loud) and Marty Balin made
several determined efforts to
drown her out. The new drummer
made little difference in their
sound though he was hard to hear
over those voices. They did
mostly familiar material in the
same good old way, though there
was a nice new song called
"Mexico."
Get in on all these good
sounds by going to Fillmore West
to see John Mayall (Mr. White
Blues, also Mr. Ego) with Duster
Bennett, Larry Coryell, and
Argent (led by Rod Argent,
former keyboard genius of the
Zombies). The Youngbloods will
be at Santa Clara on Saturday
night. Also Sat., a fabulous revival
at the Berkeley Community
Theater with Chuck Berry, Bill
Haley, the Coasters, Gary (US)
Bonds ("Quarter to Three"), and
Bo Diddely. Tickets may be had
for $3.50 to $5.50, at Sears and
the Emporium. Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young will have an
end-of-the-month concert at the
Fillmore so save your money
'cause Bill won't let you in free.


STONKD- Good vibrations from Sly of the Family stone in 'Woodstock.'
South Florida has been the
scene of much psychedelia ever
since Freddie Cannon's immortal:
"She's my Tallahassee lassie/Way
down in F.L.A." Christmas of
1968, found the city astir over the
artistry of the Door's Jim
Morison. Yes, the city father
found his art so revealing that
they initiated proceedings to have
him do a return engagement of
sorts. For those of you with a
polemic interest, these
proceedings are called extradition.
Morison's new forms of
expression stimulated both
rejection and emulation in the
local art world. His neo-Cubist
(with influences from Dada
clear y evident) on-stage
simulation of oral intercourse was
done with such a graceful,
intuitive "hand" that the seed was
planted in his disciples.
One event fostered by this
cutting edge in the vanguard of
new art media was brought to life
by Anita Bryant and Jackie
Gleason, well-known Miami-based
romatic impressionists. Using
splashes of Orange in a rendition
of a Bowl entitled "Rally for
Decency," they evoked a vivid
picture of American life gone by.
West Palm Beach and
Hallandale have been the scene of
the world's most-hassled rock
festivals. The police have shown
incredible insensitivity in lumping
the followers of rock culture with
the Fort Lauderdale crowd.
Regular events in these
festival/rituals are pre-dawn busts
of the promoters, day-before
revokation of the permits, police
assertions that dopers will not be
tolerated, racial innuendoes, and
radio editorials on the decline and
fall of the Roman Empire.
Woodstock II its IYI iami
It is easy to understand,
therefore, why I would seek out
this exciting Mecca of the rock
world to pass my all-too-brief
Spring vacation. My faith was of
course justified by the ineluctible
wisdom of the media world. The
movie Woodstock was there and
playing tq packed houses long
before backward West Coast
centers would be ready for it. I
confess that, accustomed to Bay
Area morays, I wasn't ready for
the $4 per seat ticket price.
The theater manager trundled
down the aisle and announced to
the assembled throng, whose
average age dealt a death-blow to
the R rating of this exploitation
flick, that the city fathers of Coral
Gables (the Orange County of
Southern Florida) would not
allow him to more of these
exploitation films if anyone
smoked their stashes of Rhode
Apple Red.
This disappointed me greatly
as my neighbor had intimated that
his was "straight from Uncle Ho's
victory gardens," and you can
imagine my excitement. After
flashing the peace sign (or was it
the Nixon victory sign?), the
paunchy manager allowed the
flick to begin and therefore was
not molested by the fans. With the
dismal prospects of a dry movie,
the audience tried to get high on
the $1.25 gourmet tub of
popcorn.
Flick is A Must
The film of course is a
must-see; even at the incredible
ticket prices. Anyone who had
been there will be curious to see
how well the community
experience was captured, and
those of us who were not, need to
see what we missed. The movie
projects a much more clear
impression of the event than did
radio and newspaper accounts but
will be a disappointment to
anyone who expects to transcend
the celluloid and really relive
those halcyon days. This is not to
say that it was not fascinating; the
audience around me was
completely transfixed—no one
spoke or coughed or wiggled
around; in fact, only I noticed the
deft "popcorn ploy" made in the
row in front of me. Instead of
grooving, people were detached
and observing.
As Sly and the Family Stone
sent everyone "Higher," the
theater audience remained
curiously and uncomfortably
earth-bound. Country Joe did a
solo version of "I Feel like I'm
fixin' to Die Rag" that was
incredibly exciting and had the
always-tumultuous fans in an
absolute frenzy.
Suddenly, lyrics complete with
a bouncing ball appeared on the

screen vainly encouraging the
theater audience to join in. I
couldn't decide whether the
Miami crowd was embarrassed or
just didn't know the song. It will
be interesting to view it again in
San Francisco (when it opens on
the 30th.) On these and several
other occasions, speakers by the
candy stand were turned on with
heavily reverbered audience
noises. The effect was great; but
the moments when they were
turned on was horribly
disconcerting — audience
manipulation right out of Orwell's
1984; Constant use of this
expanded audio medium is
coming, and perhaps it will be less
distracting if it is left on from the
start of the movie.
Production Problems
This problem was indicative of
what I felt was the primary
question facing the producers;
what were they trying to do and
show in their presentation of the
festival? Were they to be artists or
chroniclers? Before going, I hoped
for more than a lavishly filmed
Monterey Pop; I am not sure that
we got it —make your own
decision, as I'm tired of trying to
ascribe artistry to the better parts
and forgiving the bad rock-cinema
cliches.
Their efforts to put across a
feeling for the sub-culture, its
interaction with New York
community, and the events
themselves had mixed results.
There were too many predictable
interviews with very predictable
points made; when they did get
into good things like a mudsliding
game, they overdid them.
Overdone
Overdone is really key to this
movie; director Michael Wadleigh
seemed to come with no new
ideas about Woodstock nor any
innovative presentation
techniques. The hype we got from
Warner Bros. included two
complete listings of the arsenal of
equipment used in the filming (if
this interests you, call us) and the
suggestion that Wadleigh may
have shot up more film that any
other '27-year-old extant.
Most of the music scenes
suffered from a lack of direction;
Wadleigh evidentally instructed
his creds to keep shooting if they
found something they liked, and
so we are often blessed with three
views (split-screen) of the lead
singer and only occasional
glimpses of the other band
members.
Visual Integrity
Visually, the integrity of a
rock group is important; lead
singers look silly unless properly
framed. Jimi Hendrix and the
Who were the clearest examples of
this; the Who is one of the most
exciting visual acts anywhere, but
three views of Roger Daltry is
more than we need. Even
Monterey Pop did a better job of
keeping Peter Townsend and the
others involved. Only Sly Stone
and Alvin Lee of Ten Year's After
were exciting enough to withstand
this treatment. Sha-Na-Na moved
around too fast to be hacked up
into pieces; that really would have
been awful! This did bring out,
however, that Carlos San tana
makes silly faces while playing his
riffs.
Spaced Music
Another questionable decision
was the attempt to give a feeling
for chronological order by spacing
out the music with interviews,
intercourse, and other interplay.
Some highlights of this included
interviews with townspeople, who
gave an interesting
non-Eastern-intellectual view of
cultural trends signified in the
festival. There were dangerous
overtones of indulgence —given
music, drugs, and a change to age,
and they-will-grow-out-of-it. The
squall of bad weather which
brought the rains was both
fascinating and slightly scary.
Unfortunately, it was poorly
edited and drags—you wind up
bored. The fact the concert was
free for many was handled much
more cleverly in a rap with two
kids who had come without
tickets than in sequences showing
the freebie announcement or the
broken fences. Things I'll be
happy to never watch again were
the cleaning of a chemical toilet
and a girl shaving her
armpits—yuck! Several short
interviews with the promoters left
me uncertain as to whether they
were inarticulate or just hostile.
Filmed Perform a noes
In sudden concern for space, I
will assume that vou are familiar

with the performing style of the
groups, and merely recount how
the film seemed to affect it.
Country Joe (with the Fish this
time) got cut off in the middle of
Rock'N'Soul music which was
unfortunate. There was too much
Joan Baez and Richie Havens,
who beat his guitar senseless while
his backup ground on and grinned
mindlessly. John Sebastian
mouthed banalities and came off
silly instead of as the sensitive
artist he is reputed to be. He, Arlo
Guthrie, and Crosby, Stills, all
seemed very ingenuous; yet all but
Sebastian came over well. Crosby
et al were the closest to a live
performance of any group
presented. Santana was a vehicle
for an especially effective drum
solo and a lot of national
exposure for Bill Graham. Jimi
Hendrix closed on a dreary
morning with his super-freaky
version of the "Star-Spangled
Banner" and performed without
his customary excitement. Those
were his Band of Gypsies days,
and let's hope they're gone
forever.
Daylight was a factor for
everybody; despite the lack of a
"light show" evening
performances seemed to be more
exciting (fewer distractions), and
what lighting they did use was
especially effective on the Who,
Ten Year's After, and Sly.
Sha-Na-Na came off well on a
sunny morning (maybe 1950's
rock satire could go well
anytime), and the Grease Band
trying to sound like a girl's chorus
behind Joe Cocker was most
amusing to watch.
Few Croups Pictured
You'll be disappointed that

only 13 of the more than 30
groups were presented; the
omissions were incredible. Short
walk-ons by Grace and Janis
(there were others, but I was
pretty distracted by the guy with
the popcorn) were the only hints
of those notable acts. I especially
wanted to see The Band as they
were supposed to have really
dominated the serious musicians
present.
(Jreat Spring in Local Rock
Last Sunday, Elvin Bishop
stole the show before a packed
and friendly audience at Frost.
Dan Hicks, Aum, and Cold Blood
were all "just right" for a
beautiful afternoon. I won't even
try to comment on the one
man/one woman onslaught which
calls itself Lamb—is it art or is it
pretention?
Wednesday at Frost, the
audience was especially warm for
the 6 a.m. performance by the
cast of Hair. Their exuberance and
talent made up for the "thin"
material and the tight but far
from heavy back-up band. Many
split before the political speeches
(to go to 7 :30 classes?), but those
that stayed saw three more
competent acts.
The evening show at

Winterland was really great. The
Dead, the Airplane, and
Quicksilver, all played long sets
and Bill Graham was not to be
seen! Between sets, some cat from
Studio 759 (the Radical
Laboratories) played Moog
synthesizer at ear-busting volume
levels. Several of his crescendoes
excited the fans. Quicksilver
played a great 1:50 set in spite of
the equipment trouble that they
always seem to have, and Dino
Valente (wrote "Get Together")
and Nicky Hopkins are very much
integrated into the sound. They
whipped the audience into a
dither with "Edward, The Mad

let us down with the best version
of "Who Do You Love" that I've

say that it was not fascinating; the
audience around me was
completely transfixed—no one
spoke or coughed or wiggled
around; in fact, only I noticed the
deft "popcorn ploy" made in the
row in front of me. Instead of
grooving, people were detached
and observing.
As Sly and the Family Stone
sent everyone "Higher," the
theater audience remained
curiously and uncomfortably
earth-bound. Country Joe did a
solo version of "I Feel like I'm
fixin' to Die Rag" that was
incredibly exciting and had the
always-tumultuous fans in an
absolute frenzy.
Suddenly, lyrics complete with
a bouncing ball appeared on the

screen vainly encouraging the
theater audience to join in. I
couldn't decide whether the
Miami crowd was embarrassed or
just didn't know the song. It will
be interesting to view it again in
San Francisco (when it opens on
the 30th.) On these and several
other occasions, speakers by the
candy stand were turned on with
heavily reverbered audience
noises. The effect was great; but
the moments when they were
turned on was horribly
disconcerting — audience
manipulation right out of Orwell's
1984; Constant use of this
expanded audio medium is
coming, and perhaps it will be less
distracting if it is left on from the
start of the movie.
Production Problems
This problem was indicative of
what I felt was the primary
question facing the producers;
what were they trying to do and
show in their presentation of the
festival? Were they to be artists or
chroniclers? Before going, I hoped
for more than a lavishly filmed
Monterey Pop; I am not sure that
we got it —make your own
decision, as I'm tired of trying to
ascribe artistry to the better parts
and forgiving the bad rock-cinema
cliches.
Their efforts to put across a
feeling for the sub-culture, its
interaction with New York
community, and the events
themselves had mixed results.
There were too many predictable
interviews with very predictable
points made; when they did get
into good things like a mudsliding
game, they overdid them.
Overdone
Overdone is really key to this
movie; director Michael Wadleigh
seemed to come with no new
ideas about Woodstock nor any
innovative presentation
techniques. The hype we got from
Warner Bros. included two
complete listings of the arsenal of
equipment used in the filming (if
this interests you, call us) and the
suggestion that Wadleigh may
have shot up more film that any
other '27-year-old extant.
Most of the music scenes
suffered from a lack of direction;
Wadleigh evidentally instructed
his creds to keep shooting if they
found something they liked, and
so we are often blessed with three
views (split-screen) of the lead
singer and only occasional
glimpses of the other band
members.
Visual Integrity
Visually, the integrity of a
rock group is important; lead
singers look silly unless properly
framed. Jimi Hendrix and the
Who were the clearest examples of
this; the Who is one of the most
exciting visual acts anywhere, but
three views of Roger Daltry is
more than we need. Even
Monterey Pop did a better job of
keeping Peter Townsend and the
others involved. Only Sly Stone
and Alvin Lee of Ten Year's After
were exciting enough to withstand
this treatment. Sha-Na-Na moved
around too fast to be hacked up
into pieces; that really would have
been awful! This did bring out,
however, that Carlos San tana
makes silly faces while playing his
riffs.
Spaced Music
Another questionable decision
was the attempt to give a feeling
for chronological order by spacing
out the music with interviews,
intercourse, and other interplay.
Some highlights of this included
interviews with townspeople, who
gave an interesting
non-Eastern-intellectual view of
cultural trends signified in the
festival. There were dangerous
overtones of indulgence —given
music, drugs, and a change to age,
and they-will-grow-out-of-it. The
squall of bad weather which
brought the rains was both
fascinating and slightly scary.
Unfortunately, it was poorly
edited and drags—you wind up
bored. The fact the concert was
free for many was handled much
more cleverly in a rap with two
kids who had come without
tickets than in sequences showing
the freebie announcement or the
broken fences. Things I'll be
happy to never watch again were
the cleaning of a chemical toilet
and a girl shaving her
armpits—yuck! Several short
interviews with the promoters left
me uncertain as to whether they
were inarticulate or just hostile.
Filmed Perform a noes
In sudden concern for space, I
will assume that vou are familiar

with the performing style of the
groups, and merely recount how
the film seemed to affect it.
Country Joe (with the Fish this
time) got cut off in the middle of
Rock'N'Soul music which was
unfortunate. There was too much
Joan Baez and Richie Havens,
who beat his guitar senseless while
his backup ground on and grinned
mindlessly. John Sebastian
mouthed banalities and came off
silly instead of as the sensitive
artist he is reputed to be. He, Arlo
Guthrie, and Crosby, Stills, all
seemed very ingenuous; yet all but
Sebastian came over well. Crosby
et al were the closest to a live
performance of any group
presented. Santana was a vehicle
for an especially effective drum
solo and a lot of national
exposure for Bill Graham. Jimi
Hendrix closed on a dreary
morning with his super-freaky
version of the "Star-Spangled
Banner" and performed without
his customary excitement. Those
were his Band of Gypsies days,
and let's hope they're gone
forever.
Daylight was a factor for
everybody; despite the lack of a
"light show" evening
performances seemed to be more
exciting (fewer distractions), and
what lighting they did use was
especially effective on the Who,
Ten Year's After, and Sly.
Sha-Na-Na came off well on a
sunny morning (maybe 1950's
rock satire could go well
anytime), and the Grease Band
trying to sound like a girl's chorus
behind Joe Cocker was most
amusing to watch.
Few Croups Pictured
You'll be disappointed that

only 13 of the more than 30
groups were presented; the
omissions were incredible. Short
walk-ons by Grace and Janis
(there were others, but I was
pretty distracted by the guy with
the popcorn) were the only hints
of those notable acts. I especially
wanted to see The Band as they
were supposed to have really
dominated the serious musicians
present.
(Jreat Spring in Local Rock
Last Sunday, Elvin Bishop
stole the show before a packed
and friendly audience at Frost.
Dan Hicks, Aum, and Cold Blood
were all "just right" for a
beautiful afternoon. I won't even
try to comment on the one
man/one woman onslaught which
calls itself Lamb—is it art or is it
pretention?
Wednesday at Frost, the
audience was especially warm for
the 6 a.m. performance by the
cast of Hair. Their exuberance and
talent made up for the "thin"
material and the tight but far
from heavy back-up band. Many
split before the political speeches
(to go to 7 :30 classes?), but those
that stayed saw three more
competent acts.
The evening show at

Winterland was really great. The
Dead, the Airplane, and
Quicksilver, all played long sets
and Bill Graham was not to be
seen! Between sets, some cat from
Studio 759 (the Radical
Laboratories) played Moog
synthesizer at ear-busting volume
levels. Several of his crescendoes
excited the fans. Quicksilver
played a great 1:50 set in spite of
the equipment trouble that they
always seem to have, and Dino
Valente (wrote "Get Together")
and Nicky Hopkins are very much
integrated into the sound. They
whipped the audience into a
dither with "Edward, The Mad
Shirtgrinder" and just wouldn't
let us down with the best version
of "Who Do You Love" that I've
ever heard them do.
Slick at Winterland
Grace got the sound man to
turn her mike up to near feedback
(which in Winterland is reeaalllly
loud) and Marty Balin made
several determined efforts to
drown her out. The new drummer
made little difference in their
sound though he was hard to hear
over those voices. They did
mostly familiar material in the
same good old way, though there
was a nice new song called
"Mexico."
Get in on all these good
sounds by going to Fillmore West
to see John Mayall (Mr. White
Blues, also Mr. Ego) with Duster
Bennett, Larry Coryell, and
Argent (led by Rod Argent,
former keyboard genius of the
Zombies). The Youngbloods will
be at Santa Clara on Saturday
night. Also Sat., a fabulous revival
at the Berkeley Community
Theater with Chuck Berry, Bill
Haley, the Coasters, Gary (US)
Bonds ("Quarter to Three"), and
Bo Diddely. Tickets may be had
for $3.50 to $5.50, at Sears and
the Emporium. Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young will have an
end-of-the-month concert at the
Fillmore so save your money
'cause Bill won't let you in free.


STONKD- Good vibrations from Sly of the Family stone in 'Woodstock.'
South Florida has been the
scene of much psychedelia ever
since Freddie Cannon's immortal:
"She's my Tallahassee lassie/Way
down in F.L.A." Christmas of
1968, found the city astir over the
artistry of the Door's Jim
Morison. Yes, the city father
found his art so revealing that
they initiated proceedings to have
him do a return engagement of
sorts. For those of you with a
polemic interest, these
proceedings are called extradition.
Morison's new forms of
expression stimulated both
rejection and emulation in the
local art world. His neo-Cubist
(with influences from Dada
clear y evident) on-stage
simulation of oral intercourse was
done with such a graceful,
intuitive "hand" that the seed was
planted in his disciples.
One event fostered by this
cutting edge in the vanguard of
new art media was brought to life
by Anita Bryant and Jackie
Gleason, well-known Miami-based
romatic impressionists. Using
splashes of Orange in a rendition
of a Bowl entitled "Rally for
Decency," they evoked a vivid
picture of American life gone by.
West Palm Beach and
Hallandale have been the scene of
the world's most-hassled rock
festivals. The police have shown
incredible insensitivity in lumping
the followers of rock culture with
the Fort Lauderdale crowd.
Regular events in these
festival/rituals are pre-dawn busts
of the promoters, day-before
revokation of the permits, police
assertions that dopers will not be
tolerated, racial innuendoes, and
radio editorials on the decline and
fall of the Roman Empire.
Woodstock II its IYI iami
It is easy to understand,
therefore, why I would seek out
this exciting Mecca of the rock
world to pass my all-too-brief
Spring vacation. My faith was of
course justified by the ineluctible
wisdom of the media world. The
movie Woodstock was there and
playing tq packed houses long
before backward West Coast
centers would be ready for it. I
confess that, accustomed to Bay
Area morays, I wasn't ready for
the $4 per seat ticket price.
The theater manager trundled
down the aisle and announced to
the assembled throng, whose
average age dealt a death-blow to
the R rating of this exploitation
flick, that the city fathers of Coral
Gables (the Orange County of
Southern Florida) would not
allow him to more of these
exploitation films if anyone
smoked their stashes of Rhode
Apple Red.
This disappointed me greatly
as my neighbor had intimated that
his was "straight from Uncle Ho's
victory gardens," and you can
imagine my excitement. After
flashing the peace sign (or was it
the Nixon victory sign?), the
paunchy manager allowed the
flick to begin and therefore was
not molested by the fans. With the
dismal prospects of a dry movie,
the audience tried to get high on
the $1.25 gourmet tub of
popcorn.
Flick is A Must
The film of course is a
must-see; even at the incredible
ticket prices. Anyone who had
been there will be curious to see
how well the community
experience was captured, and
those of us who were not, need to
see what we missed. The movie
projects a much more clear
impression of the event than did
radio and newspaper accounts but
will be a disappointment to
anyone who expects to transcend
the celluloid and really relive
those halcyon days. This is not to
say that it was not fascinating; the
audience around me was
completely transfixed—no one
spoke or coughed or wiggled
around; in fact, only I noticed the
deft "popcorn ploy" made in the
row in front of me. Instead of
grooving, people were detached

Hendrix closed on a dreary
morning with his super-freaky
version of the "Star-Spangled
Banner" and performed without
his customary excitement. Those
were his Band of Gypsies days,
and let's hope they're gone
forever.
Daylight was a factor for
everybody; despite the lack of a
"light show" evening
performances seemed to be more
exciting (fewer distractions), and
what lighting they did use was
especially effective on the Who,
Ten Year's After, and Sly.
Sha-Na-Na came off well on a
sunny morning (maybe 1950's
rock satire could go well
anytime), and the Grease Band
trying to sound like a girl's chorus
behind Joe Cocker was most
amusing to watch.
Few Croups Pictured
You'll be disappointed that

only 13 of the more than 30
groups were presented; the
omissions were incredible. Short
walk-ons by Grace and Janis
(there were others, but I was
pretty distracted by the guy with
the popcorn) were the only hints
of those notable acts. I especially
wanted to see The Band as they
were supposed to have really
dominated the serious musicians
present.
(Jreat Spring in Local Rock
Last Sunday, Elvin Bishop
stole the show before a packed
and friendly audience at Frost.
Dan Hicks, Aum, and Cold Blood
were all "just right" for a
beautiful afternoon. I won't even
try to comment on the one
man/one woman onslaught which
calls itself Lamb—is it art or is it
pretention?
Wednesday at Frost, the
audience was especially warm for
the 6 a.m. performance by the
cast of Hair. Their exuberance and
talent made up for the "thin"
material and the tight but far
from heavy back-up band. Many
split before the political speeches
(to go to 7 :30 classes?), but those
that stayed saw three more
competent acts.
The evening show at

Winterland was really great. The
Dead, the Airplane, and
Quicksilver, all played long sets
and Bill Graham was not to be
seen! Between sets, some cat from
Studio 759 (the Radical
Laboratories) played Moog
synthesizer at ear-busting volume
levels. Several of his crescendoes
excited the fans. Quicksilver
played a great 1:50 set in spite of
the equipment trouble that they
always seem to have, and Dino
Valente (wrote "Get Together")
and Nicky Hopkins are very much
integrated into the sound. They
whipped the audience into a
dither with "Edward, The Mad
Shirtgrinder" and just wouldn't
let us down with the best version
of "Who Do You Love" that I've
ever heard them do.
Slick at Winterland
Grace got the sound man to
turn her mike up to near feedback
(which in Winterland is reeaalllly
loud) and Marty Balin made
several determined efforts to
drown her out. The new drummer
made little difference in their
sound though he was hard to hear
over those voices. They did
mostly familiar material in the
same good old way, though there
was a nice new song called
"Mexico."
Get in on all these good
sounds by going to Fillmore West
to see John Mayall (Mr. White
Blues, also Mr. Ego) with Duster
Bennett, Larry Coryell, and
Argent (led by Rod Argent,
former keyboard genius of the
Zombies). The Youngbloods will
be at Santa Clara on Saturday
night. Also Sat., a fabulous revival
at the Berkeley Community
Theater with Chuck Berry, Bill
Haley, the Coasters, Gary (US)
Bonds ("Quarter to Three"), and
Bo Diddely. Tickets may be had
for $3.50 to $5.50, at Sears and
the Emporium. Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young will have an
end-of-the-month concert at the
Fillmore so save your money
'cause Bill won't let you in free.


STONKD- Good vibrations from Sly of the Family stone in 'Woodstock.'
South Florida has been the
scene of much psychedelia ever
since Freddie Cannon's immortal:
"She's my Tallahassee lassie/Way
down in F.L.A." Christmas of
1968, found the city astir over the
artistry of the Door's Jim
Morison. Yes, the city father
found his art so revealing that
they initiated proceedings to have
him do a return engagement of
sorts. For those of you with a
polemic interest, these
proceedings are called extradition.
Morison's new forms of
expression stimulated both
rejection and emulation in the
local art world. His neo-Cubist
(with influences from Dada
clear y evident) on-stage
simulation of oral intercourse was
done with such a graceful,
intuitive "hand" that the seed was
planted in his disciples.
One event fostered by this
cutting edge in the vanguard of
new art media was brought to life
by Anita Bryant and Jackie
Gleason, well-known Miami-based
romatic impressionists. Using
splashes of Orange in a rendition
of a Bowl entitled "Rally for
Decency," they evoked a vivid
picture of American life gone by.
West Palm Beach and
Hallandale have been the scene of
the world's most-hassled rock
festivals. The police have shown
incredible insensitivity in lumping
the followers of rock culture with
the Fort Lauderdale crowd.
Regular events in these
festival/rituals are pre-dawn busts
of the promoters, day-before
revokation of the permits, police
assertions that dopers will not be
tolerated, racial innuendoes, and
radio editorials on the decline and
fall of the Roman Empire.
Woodstock II its IYI iami
It is easy to understand,
therefore, why I would seek out
this exciting Mecca of the rock
world to pass my all-too-brief
Spring vacation. My faith was of
course justified by the ineluctible
wisdom of the media world. The
movie Woodstock was there and
playing tq packed houses long
before backward West Coast
centers would be ready for it. I
confess that, accustomed to Bay
Area morays, I wasn't ready for
the $4 per seat ticket price.
The theater manager trundled
down the aisle and announced to
the assembled throng, whose
average age dealt a death-blow to
the R rating of this exploitation
flick, that the city fathers of Coral
Gables (the Orange County of
Southern Florida) would not
allow him to more of these
exploitation films if anyone
smoked their stashes of Rhode
Apple Red.
This disappointed me greatly
as my neighbor had intimated that
his was "straight from Uncle Ho's
victory gardens," and you can
imagine my excitement. After
flashing the peace sign (or was it
the Nixon victory sign?), the
paunchy manager allowed the
flick to begin and therefore was
not molested by the fans. With the
dismal prospects of a dry movie,
the audience tried to get high on
the $1.25 gourmet tub of
popcorn.
Flick is A Must
The film of course is a
must-see; even at the incredible
ticket prices. Anyone who had
been there will be curious to see
how well the community
experience was captured, and
those of us who were not, need to
see what we missed. The movie
projects a much more clear
impression of the event than did
radio and newspaper accounts but
will be a disappointment to
anyone who expects to transcend
the celluloid and really relive
those halcyon days. This is not to
say that it was not fascinating; the
audience around me was
completely transfixed—no one
spoke or coughed or wiggled
around; in fact, only I noticed the
deft "popcorn ploy" made in the
row in front of me. Instead of
grooving, people were detached
and observing.
As Sly and the Family Stone
sent everyone "Higher," the
theater audience remained
curiously and uncomfortably
earth-bound. Country Joe did a
solo version of "I Feel like I'm
fixin' to Die Rag" that was
incredibly exciting and had the
always-tumultuous fans in an
absolute frenzy.
Suddenly, lyrics complete with
a bouncing ball appeared on the

screen vainly encouraging the
theater audience to join in. I
couldn't decide whether the
Miami crowd was embarrassed or
just didn't know the song. It will
be interesting to view it again in
San Francisco (when it opens on
the 30th.) On these and several
other occasions, speakers by the
candy stand were turned on with
heavily reverbered audience
noises. The effect was great; but
the moments when they were
turned on was horribly
disconcerting — audience
manipulation right out of Orwell's
1984; Constant use of this
expanded audio medium is
coming, and perhaps it will be less
distracting if it is left on from the
start of the movie.
Production Problems
This problem was indicative of
what I felt was the primary
question facing the producers;
what were they trying to do and
show in their presentation of the
festival? Were they to be artists or
chroniclers? Before going, I hoped
for more than a lavishly filmed
Monterey Pop; I am not sure that
we got it —make your own
decision, as I'm tired of trying to
ascribe artistry to the better parts
and forgiving the bad rock-cinema
cliches.
Their efforts to put across a
feeling for the sub-culture, its
interaction with New York
community, and the events
themselves had mixed results.
There were too many predictable
interviews with very predictable
points made; when they did get
into good things like a mudsliding
game, they overdid them.
Overdone
Overdone is really key to this
movie; director Michael Wadleigh
seemed to come with no new
ideas about Woodstock nor any
innovative presentation
techniques. The hype we got from
Warner Bros. included two
complete listings of the arsenal of
equipment used in the filming (if
this interests you, call us) and the
suggestion that Wadleigh may
have shot up more film that any
other '27-year-old extant.
Most of the music scenes
suffered from a lack of direction;
Wadleigh evidentally instructed
his creds to keep shooting if they
found something they liked, and
so we are often blessed with three
views (split-screen) of the lead
singer and only occasional
glimpses of the other band
members.
Visual Integrity
Visually, the integrity of a
rock group is important; lead
singers look silly unless properly
framed. Jimi Hendrix and the
Who were the clearest examples of
this; the Who is one of the most
exciting visual acts anywhere, but
three views of Roger Daltry is
more than we need. Even
Monterey Pop did a better job of
keeping Peter Townsend and the
others involved. Only Sly Stone
and Alvin Lee of Ten Year's After
were exciting enough to withstand
this treatment. Sha-Na-Na moved
around too fast to be hacked up
into pieces; that really would have
been awful! This did bring out,
however, that Carlos San tana
makes silly faces while playing his
riffs.
Spaced Music
Another questionable decision
was the attempt to give a feeling
for chronological order by spacing
out the music with interviews,
intercourse, and other interplay.
Some highlights of this included
interviews with townspeople, who
gave an interesting
non-Eastern-intellectual view of
cultural trends signified in the
festival. There were dangerous
overtones of indulgence —given
music, drugs, and a change to age,
and they-will-grow-out-of-it. The
squall of bad weather which
brought the rains was both
fascinating and slightly scary.
Unfortunately, it was poorly
edited and drags—you wind up
bored. The fact the concert was
free for many was handled much
more cleverly in a rap with two
kids who had come without
tickets than in sequences showing
the freebie announcement or the
broken fences. Things I'll be
happy to never watch again were
the cleaning of a chemical toilet
and a girl shaving her
armpits—yuck! Several short
interviews with the promoters left
me uncertain as to whether they
were inarticulate or just hostile.
Filmed Perform a noes
In sudden concern for space, I
will assume that vou are familiar

with the performing style of the
groups, and merely recount how
the film seemed to affect it.
Country Joe (with the Fish this
time) got cut off in the middle of
Rock'N'Soul music which was
unfortunate. There was too much
Joan Baez and Richie Havens,
who beat his guitar senseless while
his backup ground on and grinned
mindlessly. John Sebastian
mouthed banalities and came off
silly instead of as the sensitive
artist he is reputed to be. He, Arlo
Guthrie, and Crosby, Stills, all
seemed very ingenuous; yet all but
Sebastian came over well. Crosby
et al were the closest to a live
performance of any group
presented. Santana was a vehicle
for an especially effective drum
solo and a lot of national
exposure for Bill Graham. Jimi
Hendrix closed on a dreary
morning with his super-freaky
version of the "Star-Spangled
Banner" and performed without
his customary excitement. Those
were his Band of Gypsies days,
and let's hope they're gone
forever.
Daylight was a factor for
everybody; despite the lack of a
"light show" evening
performances seemed to be more
exciting (fewer distractions), and
what lighting they did use was
especially effective on the Who,
Ten Year's After, and Sly.
Sha-Na-Na came off well on a

trying to sound like a girl's chorus
behind Joe Cocker was most
amusing to watch.

Woodstock II its IYI iami
It is easy to understand,
therefore, why I would seek out
this exciting Mecca of the rock
world to pass my all-too-brief
Spring vacation. My faith was of
course justified by the ineluctible
wisdom of the media world. The
movie Woodstock was there and
playing tq packed houses long
before backward West Coast
centers would be ready for it. I
confess that, accustomed to Bay
Area morays, I wasn't ready for
the $4 per seat ticket price.
The theater manager trundled
down the aisle and announced to
the assembled throng, whose
average age dealt a death-blow to
the R rating of this exploitation
flick, that the city fathers of Coral
Gables (the Orange County of
Southern Florida) would not
allow him to more of these
exploitation films if anyone
smoked their stashes of Rhode
Apple Red.
This disappointed me greatly
as my neighbor had intimated that
his was "straight from Uncle Ho's
victory gardens," and you can
imagine my excitement. After
flashing the peace sign (or was it
the Nixon victory sign?), the
paunchy manager allowed the
flick to begin and therefore was
not molested by the fans. With the
dismal prospects of a dry movie,
the audience tried to get high on
the $1.25 gourmet tub of
popcorn.
Flick is A Must
The film of course is a
must-see; even at the incredible
ticket prices. Anyone who had
been there will be curious to see
how well the community
experience was captured, and
those of us who were not, need to
see what we missed. The movie
projects a much more clear
impression of the event than did
radio and newspaper accounts but
will be a disappointment to
anyone who expects to transcend
the celluloid and really relive
those halcyon days. This is not to
say that it was not fascinating; the
audience around me was
completely transfixed—no one
spoke or coughed or wiggled
around; in fact, only I noticed the
deft "popcorn ploy" made in the
row in front of me. Instead of
grooving, people were detached
and observing.
As Sly and the Family Stone
sent everyone "Higher," the
theater audience remained
curiously and uncomfortably
earth-bound. Country Joe did a
solo version of "I Feel like I'm
fixin' to Die Rag" that was
incredibly exciting and had the
always-tumultuous fans in an
absolute frenzy.
Suddenly, lyrics complete with
a bouncing ball appeared on the

screen vainly encouraging the
theater audience to join in. I
couldn't decide whether the
Miami crowd was embarrassed or
just didn't know the song. It will
be interesting to view it again in
San Francisco (when it opens on
the 30th.) On these and several
other occasions, speakers by the
candy stand were turned on with
heavily reverbered audience
noises. The effect was great; but
the moments when they were
turned on was horribly
disconcerting — audience
manipulation right out of Orwell's
1984; Constant use of this
expanded audio medium is
coming, and perhaps it will be less
distracting if it is left on from the
start of the movie.
Production Problems
This problem was indicative of
what I felt was the primary
question facing the producers;
what were they trying to do and
show in their presentation of the
festival? Were they to be artists or
chroniclers? Before going, I hoped
for more than a lavishly filmed
Monterey Pop; I am not sure that
we got it —make your own
decision, as I'm tired of trying to
ascribe artistry to the better parts
and forgiving the bad rock-cinema
cliches.
Their efforts to put across a
feeling for the sub-culture, its
interaction with New York
community, and the events
themselves had mixed results.
There were too many predictable
interviews with very predictable
points made; when they did get
into good things like a mudsliding
game, they overdid them.
Overdone
Overdone is really key to this
movie; director Michael Wadleigh
seemed to come with no new
ideas about Woodstock nor any
innovative presentation
techniques. The hype we got from
Warner Bros. included two
complete listings of the arsenal of
equipment used in the filming (if
this interests you, call us) and the
suggestion that Wadleigh may
have shot up more film that any
other '27-year-old extant.
Most of the music scenes
suffered from a lack of direction;
Wadleigh evidentally instructed
his creds to keep shooting if they
found something they liked, and
so we are often blessed with three
views (split-screen) of the lead
singer and only occasional
glimpses of the other band
members.
Visual Integrity
Visually, the integrity of a
rock group is important; lead
singers look silly unless properly
framed. Jimi Hendrix and the
Who were the clearest examples of
this; the Who is one of the most
exciting visual acts anywhere, but
three views of Roger Daltry is
more than we need. Even
Monterey Pop did a better job of
keeping Peter Townsend and the
others involved. Only Sly Stone
and Alvin Lee of Ten Year's After
were exciting enough to withstand
this treatment. Sha-Na-Na moved
around too fast to be hacked up
into pieces; that really would have
been awful! This did bring out,
however, that Carlos San tana
makes silly faces while playing his
riffs.
Spaced Music
Another questionable decision
was the attempt to give a feeling
for chronological order by spacing
out the music with interviews,
intercourse, and other interplay.
Some highlights of this included
interviews with townspeople, who
gave an interesting
non-Eastern-intellectual view of
cultural trends signified in the
festival. There were dangerous
overtones of indulgence —given
music, drugs, and a change to age,
and they-will-grow-out-of-it. The
squall of bad weather which
brought the rains was both
fascinating and slightly scary.
Unfortunately, it was poorly
edited and drags—you wind up
bored. The fact the concert was
free for many was handled much
more cleverly in a rap with two
kids who had come without
tickets than in sequences showing
the freebie announcement or the
broken fences. Things I'll be
happy to never watch again were
the cleaning of a chemical toilet
and a girl shaving her
armpits—yuck! Several short
interviews with the promoters left
me uncertain as to whether they
were inarticulate or just hostile.
Filmed Perform a noes
In sudden concern for space, I
will assume that vou are familiar

with the performing style of the
groups, and merely recount how
the film seemed to affect it.
Country Joe (with the Fish this
time) got cut off in the middle of
Rock'N'Soul music which was
unfortunate. There was too much
Joan Baez and Richie Havens,
who beat his guitar senseless while
his backup ground on and grinned
mindlessly. John Sebastian
mouthed banalities and came off
silly instead of as the sensitive
artist he is reputed to be. He, Arlo
Guthrie, and Crosby, Stills, all
seemed very ingenuous; yet all but
Sebastian came over well. Crosby
et al were the closest to a live
performance of any group
presented. Santana was a vehicle
for an especially effective drum
solo and a lot of national
exposure for Bill Graham. Jimi
Hendrix closed on a dreary
morning with his super-freaky
version of the "Star-Spangled
Banner" and performed without
his customary excitement. Those
were his Band of Gypsies days,
and let's hope they're gone
forever.
Daylight was a factor for
everybody; despite the lack of a
"light show" evening
performances seemed to be more
exciting (fewer distractions), and
what lighting they did use was
especially effective on the Who,
Ten Year's After, and Sly.
Sha-Na-Na came off well on a
sunny morning (maybe 1950's
rock satire could go well
anytime), and the Grease Band
trying to sound like a girl's chorus
behind Joe Cocker was most
amusing to watch.
Few Croups Pictured
You'll be disappointed that

only 13 of the more than 30
groups were presented; the
omissions were incredible. Short
walk-ons by Grace and Janis
(there were others, but I was
pretty distracted by the guy with
the popcorn) were the only hints
of those notable acts. I especially
wanted to see The Band as they
were supposed to have really
dominated the serious musicians
present.
(Jreat Spring in Local Rock
Last Sunday, Elvin Bishop
stole the show before a packed
and friendly audience at Frost.
Dan Hicks, Aum, and Cold Blood
were all "just right" for a
beautiful afternoon. I won't even
try to comment on the one
man/one woman onslaught which
calls itself Lamb—is it art or is it
pretention?
Wednesday at Frost, the
audience was especially warm for
the 6 a.m. performance by the
cast of Hair. Their exuberance and
talent made up for the "thin"
material and the tight but far
from heavy back-up band. Many
split before the political speeches
(to go to 7 :30 classes?), but those
that stayed saw three more
competent acts.
The evening show at

Winterland was really great. The
Dead, the Airplane, and
Quicksilver, all played long sets
and Bill Graham was not to be
seen! Between sets, some cat from
Studio 759 (the Radical
Laboratories) played Moog
synthesizer at ear-busting volume
levels. Several of his crescendoes
excited the fans. Quicksilver
played a great 1:50 set in spite of
the equipment trouble that they
always seem to have, and Dino
Valente (wrote "Get Together")
and Nicky Hopkins are very much
integrated into the sound. They
whipped the audience into a
dither with "Edward, The Mad
Shirtgrinder" and just wouldn't
let us down with the best version
of "Who Do You Love" that I've
ever heard them do.
Slick at Winterland
Grace got the sound man to
turn her mike up to near feedback
(which in Winterland is reeaalllly
loud) and Marty Balin made
several determined efforts to
drown her out. The new drummer
made little difference in their
sound though he was hard to hear
over those voices. They did
mostly familiar material in the
same good old way, though there
was a nice new song called
"Mexico."
Get in on all these good
sounds by going to Fillmore West
to see John Mayall (Mr. White
Blues, also Mr. Ego) with Duster
Bennett, Larry Coryell, and
Argent (led by Rod Argent,
former keyboard genius of the
Zombies). The Youngbloods will
be at Santa Clara on Saturday
night. Also Sat., a fabulous revival
at the Berkeley Community
Theater with Chuck Berry, Bill
Haley, the Coasters, Gary (US)
Bonds ("Quarter to Three"), and
Bo Diddely. Tickets may be had
for $3.50 to $5.50, at Sears and
the Emporium. Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young will have an
end-of-the-month concert at the
Fillmore so save your money
'cause Bill won't let you in free.


STONKD- Good vibrations from Sly of the Family stone in 'Woodstock.'
South Florida has been the
scene of much psychedelia ever
since Freddie Cannon's immortal:
"She's my Tallahassee lassie/Way
down in F.L.A." Christmas of
1968, found the city astir over the
artistry of the Door's Jim
Morison. Yes, the city father
found his art so revealing that
they initiated proceedings to have
him do a return engagement of
sorts. For those of you with a
polemic interest, these
proceedings are called extradition.
Morison's new forms of
expression stimulated both
rejection and emulation in the
local art world. His neo-Cubist
(with influences from Dada
clear y evident) on-stage
simulation of oral intercourse was
done with such a graceful,
intuitive "hand" that the seed was
planted in his disciples.
One event fostered by this
cutting edge in the vanguard of
new art media was brought to life
by Anita Bryant and Jackie
Gleason, well-known Miami-based
romatic impressionists. Using
splashes of Orange in a rendition
of a Bowl entitled "Rally for
Decency," they evoked a vivid
picture of American life gone by.
West Palm Beach and
Hallandale have been the scene of
the world's most-hassled rock
festivals. The police have shown
incredible insensitivity in lumping
the followers of rock culture with
the Fort Lauderdale crowd.
Regular events in these
festival/rituals are pre-dawn busts
of the promoters, day-before
revokation of the permits, police
assertions that dopers will not be
tolerated, racial innuendoes, and
radio editorials on the decline and
fall of the Roman Empire.
