# On Courts And Diamond
## Southerners Challenge Tribe 
### JOHN ARTHUR HALL DAILY 
A couple of the best college
baseball teams in the country will
be on view in Sunken Diamond
this weekend as Stanford hosts
UCLA at 3 p.m. and USC in a
doubleheader beginning at noon
tomorrow.
The baseball rankings came
out this week, and they showed
Southern Cal in the number one
spot and Stanford in fourth.
UCLA wasn't in the top ten.
Yesterday the Indians were
defeated 9-8 by San Diego State
after scoring two runs with two
down in the ninth inning on a
bases-loaded single by Dave
Edson. Mike Nelson had a
three-run homer for the losers.
The loss gave the Tribe a
25-7-1 record to bring into the
UCLA game. The Bruins,
conference champs a year ago,
don't appear to be as strong this

ser.ron, hut can't bo taken lightly.
They feature a power-hitting
sophomore catcher named Bob
Pifferini who's batting average
approaches .400 and who had live
homers going into the league
season. But their pitching's been
inconsistent. Their record is
13-'3-l.
Southern Cal, however, is
strong nil 'vor Their two leading

pitchers, Brent Strom and Jim
Barr, have a combined won-lost
mark of 16-1, and they'll
probably go against Stanford.
At the plate, the Trojans
feature a balanced attack, led by
.346 hitting outfielder Buss
Bennett. Five other hitters,
including power hitting third
baseman Dan Stoligrosz, catcher
Craig Perkins and second baseman
Frank Alfano. Overall, the Trojans
are 29-7 are over .300.
Stanford coach Ray Young
will go with Bruce Schoin against
UCLA and Steve Dunning and
Phil Keller Saturday. Despite last
week's opening loss, the Tribe
mentor says he's not concerned.
"I'd be worried if I thought we'd
been beaten by a better team.
We're hitting the ball hard and
we're still in good shape," he says.
It should be an interesting
weekend. Come early.

The two top ranked collegiate
tennis teams in the nation will be
out to spoil Stanford's lean hopes
for a Pac-8 title this weekend.
Friday, USC invades Stanford's
home courts at 2 o'clock.
Saturday, the Indians take on
UCLA beginning at noon with all
nine matches scheduled to be
played on the three stadium
courts throughout the afternoon.
Last weekend, the Trojans
upset the Bruins 6-3. In a titanic
struggle, UCS met the Uclans
without Troy's third singles
player, Steve Avoyer, whose
racket exploits include winning
the 1966 National Junior
Championships. However, SC
coach George Toley has great
depth with the addition of
Brazilian standout Fernando
Gentil.
UCLA Deeper
In the UCLA contest, coach
Dick Gould will have to contend
with a stronger and deeper team
than he faced earlier this season in
LA. Playing the top slot will be
Pakistan Davis Cupper Haroon
Rahim. In third doubles, Rick
Evans and Mac Claflin will face
freshmen eligibles Bob and Mike
Kriess, who won last weekend
against USC.
Boasting a 10-2 season record,
coach Gould's Indians are
optimistic and confident. "We feel
both USC and UCLA are
beatable," Gould commented.
"UCLA beat us bad down there,
but they have much slower courts,
so it really hurt us. We had a real
good match with SC though. This
time we'll be on our courts, which
is a big advantage since our courts
are really fast."
Questioned about his chances
for victory, Gould responded,
"Right down the line our scores
against Cal were as good as USC's
and UCLA's. If we can play as
well this weekend, both matches
should be very close."
Since WW II
Stanford's netmen haven't
beaten UCLA since World War II
and have beaten USC only three
times since WW II and in 1959
and 1960 while Troy was on
NCAA probation. Coach Gould
hopes to open a new decade with
at least one split against a
Southland team.
Earlier this week, the varsity
whipped the Grad students 6-3.
Roscoe Tanner outlasted ex-Cal
ace Chuck Darley in a grueling
three set warmup for this
weekend's action.
