# Trojans Host Spikers

### DON TOLLEFSON 
Trips to Southern California
by Stanford athletic teams have
produced the usual dismal effects
for most of this year. The
football, basketball, water polo
and tennis teams have all gone to
Los Angeles, played and returned
without a victory. Only the
swimming team and baseball team
have had any success and even the
latter lost to USC while winning
four out of seven in the Riverside
Tournament.
The last Stanford group of
athletes to appear in the Colisuim
was the football team, which lost
one of the more unbelievable
games in collegiate history to USC
26-24. For the track team to
come as close as the footballers
did would necessitate a minor
miracle.
Any hope Stanford may have
gotten when Washington tied USC
77-77 last Saturday has to be
lessened by the - fact that the
Trojan's two top point getters,
Herman Franklin and Edsel

Garrison, did not compete.
Garrison is certain to run
Saturday and Franklin will
probably see action, though his
presence would not really be
necessary.
With Franklin and Garrison
running, the Trojans had won four
straight dual meets including a
77-76 win over a loaded Cal squad
and a 101-44 rout over the same
Occidental team which nipped the
Tribe 73-72.
Garrison will be favored in the
100 (9.5) and 220 (20.7) while
Franklin, if healthy, should win
the high hurdles (13.5),
intermediate hurdles (51.9) and
long jump (24-B'/2). Indians
hurdler Rick Tipton beat Franklin
in the Pac-8 hurdles last year, but
he has been slowed by injuries and
has run only a 14.3 compared to
his 13.9 lifetime best.
The sprints and hurdles will
pretty much be USC's own show
especially since the Indians'
leading sprinter A 1 Dyson (9.9,
21.6) is still a doubtful

competitor. But from the 880 on
up there should be some good
races. Each team has three
halfmilers under 1 :54 and four
milers under 4:10.2. And in the
two mile, the Trojans' Ole Oleson
(8:50.5) will dual with Stanford's
Greg Brock (8:45.2) and Don
Kardong (8:45.2).
In the field events the Trojans
will be favored to sweep both the
shot, put and javelin. The Indians
will have their best chances in the
triple jump where Allen Meredith
(50-11'<40 takes on Howard Pratt
(50-4 3/4) and in the pole vault
where Casey Carrigan (16-0) and
Steve Flannery (15-6) will meet
Steve Smith (16-0) and Jim
Cochran (15-6).
Stanford's press release points
out that USC has beaten the
Indians in track 34 straight times.
The Tribe almost won in 1963
when they lost by 73-72, but
Payton Jordan couldn't find triple
jumper Sheridan Downey who
thought the meet was rained out
and who could have won it.
Unless something drastic
happens to the Trojan squad,
Jordan will need a lot more than
another good triple jumper to win
tomorrow.

100 (9.5) and 220 (20.7) while
Franklin, if healthy, should win
the high hurdles (13.5),
intermediate hurdles (51.9) and
long jump (24-B'/2). Indians
hurdler Rick Tipton beat Franklin
in the Pac-8 hurdles last year, but
he has been slowed by injuries and
has run only a 14.3 compared to
his 13.9 lifetime best.
The sprints and hurdles will
pretty much be USC's own show
especially since the Indians'
leading sprinter A 1 Dyson (9.9,
21.6) is still a doubtful

competitor. But from the 880 on
up there should be some good
races. Each team has three
halfmilers under 1 :54 and four
milers under 4:10.2. And in the
two mile, the Trojans' Ole Oleson
(8:50.5) will dual with Stanford's
Greg Brock (8:45.2) and Don
Kardong (8:45.2).
In the field events the Trojans
will be favored to sweep both the
shot, put and javelin. The Indians
will have their best chances in the
triple jump where Allen Meredith
(50-11'<40 takes on Howard Pratt
(50-4 3/4) and in the pole vault
where Casey Carrigan (16-0) and
Steve Flannery (15-6) will meet
Steve Smith (16-0) and Jim
Cochran (15-6).
Stanford's press release points
out that USC has beaten the
Indians in track 34 straight times.
The Tribe almost won in 1963
when they lost by 73-72, but
Payton Jordan couldn't find triple
jumper Sheridan Downey who
thought the meet was rained out
and who could have won it.
Unless something drastic
happens to the Trojan squad,
Jordan will need a lot more than
another good triple jumper to win
tomorrow.
Trips to Southern California
by Stanford athletic teams have
produced the usual dismal effects
for most of this year. The
football, basketball, water polo
and tennis teams have all gone to
Los Angeles, played and returned
without a victory. Only the
swimming team and baseball team
have had any success and even the
latter lost to USC while winning
four out of seven in the Riverside
Tournament.
The last Stanford group of
athletes to appear in the Colisuim
was the football team, which lost
one of the more unbelievable
games in collegiate history to USC
26-24. For the track team to
come as close as the footballers
did would necessitate a minor
miracle.
Any hope Stanford may have
gotten when Washington tied USC
77-77 last Saturday has to be
lessened by the - fact that the
Trojan's two top point getters,
Herman Franklin and Edsel

Garrison, did not compete.
Garrison is certain to run
Saturday and Franklin will
probably see action, though his
presence would not really be
necessary.
With Franklin and Garrison
running, the Trojans had won four
straight dual meets including a
77-76 win over a loaded Cal squad
and a 101-44 rout over the same
Occidental team which nipped the
Tribe 73-72.
