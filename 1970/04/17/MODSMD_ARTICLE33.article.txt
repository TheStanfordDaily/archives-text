# They Start Again Tomorrow
## 
### FRED LEESON 
With their ambitions focused
on fields considerably more
grandiose than those of the
Stanford practice grounds, about
100 hopeful football players open
spring practice tomorrow anxious
to earn positions on the varsity
which will attempt another foray
into the realm of fame and glory
next fall.
And this year's venture will
probably be even tougher than
those of the last two seasons.
Aside from old stand-bys like
USC, UCLA, Purdue and
California the Tribe has added a
fifth high-pressure game with its
season opener against Arkansas.
Indian Army
A frequently reliable source
(The Paly Times) has indicated
that the Indians will carry a squad
of 75 into Little Rock for that
nationally televised affair, after
which Coach John Ralston will
have to cut his troops to 46 for
league games.
But the emphasis in spring
practice is less on the schedule
ahead and more on individual
development and fundamentals
. . . like blocking, tackling,
offense and defense.
In fact, senior players, whose
abilities are already familiar to
Ralston and his flock of assistants,
won't be out for another week
while the staff gives special
attention to younger players and
newcomers.
Like most teams, on paper the
Indians seem to have their
strengths, and then again, they
have weaknesses. Rumor also has
it that the quarterback position is
pretty well filled.
On The Line
More seriously, Stanford's

immediate problems concern the
offensive line, which lost four of
its starters to graduation;
linebacking, where both
linebackers from last season are
gone; the defensive secondary,
which lost two defenders; and the
offensive backfield, which lost
two starting runners.
On the other hand, 34
lettermen return, and available
talent could well fill the existing
gaps.
The other big plus is the return
of senior quarterback Jim
Plunkett, the San Jose
record-breaker who is justifiably
being boomed for Heisman
Trophy honors.
Last year he set six Stanford
and Pac-8 season marks, and,
assuming his continued good
health, he will probably establish
three new Pac-8 career records by
the second or third game of the
season.
Another offensive asset for the
Tribe will be the return of all of
Plunkett's receivers, like Randy
Vataha, Jack Lasater, Bob Moore,
Ron Kadziel and Demea
Washington.
Hillary Shockley and Jackie
Brown figure at the outset to take
the places of Howie Williams and
Bubba Brown at fullback and
running back, respectively, and
Tom Sones and Jeff Siemon will
get first shot at filling the
linebacking spots vacated by Don
Parish and Pat Preston.
According to Ralston's
preliminary depth chart, the
offensive line features Steve Jubb
at strong side tackle, Dan
Lightfoot at strong side guard.
Bob Brown at short side guard
and Bill Meyers, a non-letterman,
at short side tackle.

In the middle of it will be
John Sande, an All-Coast center
last year who, along with Moore
at tight end, is considered by local
experts to be in the running for
first team All-America honors.
The defensive line, considered
young and inexperienced last
season, is all back, with
preliminary top spots going to
Dennis Moore, Dave Tipton, Pete
Lazetich, Jody Graves, Bill
Alexander and Jack Schulz.
Mike Ewing and Miles Moore
figure to replace Rich Keller and
Dick Oliver as the defensive backs,
while Jim Kauffman returns at
safety.
There will also be additional
help coming up from the frosh.
Jesse Freitas and Jim Wise will be
battling for the second QB spot
since Don Bunce will redshirt the
1970 season.

Other offensive prospects
include Reggie Sanderson at
fullback, Pierre Perreault at
tackle, and Eric Cross at running
back.
Frosh defensive hopefuls
feature Ned Chambers and Tom
Klein, ends; Pete Hanson, tackle;
and Charles McCloud, defensive
back.
Transfers who figure to help
include Roger Cowan, a 230
pound defensive lineman from
Santa Monica Junior College;
Mike Simone, a quick linebacker
from Golden West Junior College;
and Tim Robnett, a quick
defensive back from Bakersfield
JC.
But they won't be around
until fall.
Spring practice will run five
days per week, ending May 16.

"Red" versus "White" intersquad
scrimmages open for public
inspection will be held on
Saturdays May 9 and 16 in
Stanford Stadium.
Home games next fall will be
against San Jose State, Purdue,
USC, Oregon State and
Washington. Arkansas, Oregon,
Washington State, UCLA, Air
Force and Cal get the Indians on
the road.
In line with Pac-8 price
increases, individual reserved seats
will go for $6 this year, and the
California game prices are a dollar
higher.

Another offensive asset for the
Tribe will be the return of all of
Plunkett's receivers, like Randy
Vataha, Jack Lasater, Bob Moore,
Ron Kadziel and Demea
Washington.
Hillary Shockley and Jackie
Brown figure at the outset to take
the places of Howie Williams and
Bubba Brown at fullback and
running back, respectively, and
Tom Sones and Jeff Siemon will
get first shot at filling the
linebacking spots vacated by Don
Parish and Pat Preston.
According to Ralston's
preliminary depth chart, the
offensive line features Steve Jubb
at strong side tackle, Dan
Lightfoot at strong side guard.
Bob Brown at short side guard
and Bill Meyers, a non-letterman,
at short side tackle.

In the middle of it will be
John Sande, an All-Coast center
last year who, along with Moore
at tight end, is considered by local
experts to be in the running for
first team All-America honors.
The defensive line, considered
young and inexperienced last
season, is all back, with
preliminary top spots going to
Dennis Moore, Dave Tipton, Pete
Lazetich, Jody Graves, Bill
Alexander and Jack Schulz.
Mike Ewing and Miles Moore
figure to replace Rich Keller and
Dick Oliver as the defensive backs,
while Jim Kauffman returns at
safety.
There will also be additional
help coming up from the frosh.
Jesse Freitas and Jim Wise will be
battling for the second QB spot
since Don Bunce will redshirt the
1970 season.

Other offensive prospects
include Reggie Sanderson at
fullback, Pierre Perreault at
tackle, and Eric Cross at running
back.
Frosh defensive hopefuls
feature Ned Chambers and Tom
Klein, ends; Pete Hanson, tackle;
and Charles McCloud, defensive
back.
Transfers who figure to help
include Roger Cowan, a 230
pound defensive lineman from
Santa Monica Junior College;
Mike Simone, a quick linebacker
from Golden West Junior College;
and Tim Robnett, a quick
defensive back from Bakersfield
JC.
But they won't be around
until fall.
Spring practice will run five
days per week, ending May 16.

"Red" versus "White" intersquad
scrimmages open for public
inspection will be held on
Saturdays May 9 and 16 in
Stanford Stadium.
Home games next fall will be
against San Jose State, Purdue,
USC, Oregon State and
Washington. Arkansas, Oregon,
Washington State, UCLA, Air
Force and Cal get the Indians on
the road.
In line with Pac-8 price
increases, individual reserved seats
will go for $6 this year, and the
California game prices are a dollar
higher.

With their ambitions focused
on fields considerably more
grandiose than those of the
Stanford practice grounds, about
100 hopeful football players open
spring practice tomorrow anxious
to earn positions on the varsity
which will attempt another foray
into the realm of fame and glory
next fall.
And this year's venture will
probably be even tougher than
those of the last two seasons.
Aside from old stand-bys like
USC, UCLA, Purdue and
California the Tribe has added a
fifth high-pressure game with its
season opener against Arkansas.
Indian Army
A frequently reliable source
(The Paly Times) has indicated
that the Indians will carry a squad
of 75 into Little Rock for that
nationally televised affair, after
which Coach John Ralston will
have to cut his troops to 46 for
league games.
But the emphasis in spring
practice is less on the schedule
ahead and more on individual
development and fundamentals
. . . like blocking, tackling,
offense and defense.
In fact, senior players, whose
abilities are already familiar to
Ralston and his flock of assistants,
won't be out for another week
while the staff gives special
attention to younger players and
newcomers.
Like most teams, on paper the
Indians seem to have their
strengths, and then again, they
have weaknesses. Rumor also has
it that the quarterback position is
pretty well filled.
On The Line
More seriously, Stanford's

immediate problems concern the
offensive line, which lost four of
its starters to graduation;
linebacking, where both
linebackers from last season are
gone; the defensive secondary,
which lost two defenders; and the
offensive backfield, which lost
two starting runners.
On the other hand, 34
lettermen return, and available
talent could well fill the existing
gaps.
The other big plus is the return
of senior quarterback Jim
Plunkett, the San Jose
record-breaker who is justifiably
being boomed for Heisman
Trophy honors.
Last year he set six Stanford
and Pac-8 season marks, and,
assuming his continued good
health, he will probably establish
three new Pac-8 career records by
the second or third game of the
season.

scrimmages open for public
inspection will be held on
Saturdays May 9 and 16 in
Stanford Stadium.
Home games next fall will be
against San Jose State, Purdue,
USC, Oregon State and
Washington. Arkansas, Oregon,
Washington State, UCLA, Air
Force and Cal get the Indians on
the road.
In line with Pac-8 price
increases, individual reserved seats
will go for $6 this year, and the
California game prices are a dollar
higher.

With their ambitions focused
on fields considerably more
grandiose than those of the
Stanford practice grounds, about
100 hopeful football players open
spring practice tomorrow anxious
to earn positions on the varsity
which will attempt another foray
into the realm of fame and glory
next fall.
And this year's venture will
probably be even tougher than
those of the last two seasons.
Aside from old stand-bys like
USC, UCLA, Purdue and
California the Tribe has added a
fifth high-pressure game with its
season opener against Arkansas.
Indian Army
A frequently reliable source
(The Paly Times) has indicated
that the Indians will carry a squad
of 75 into Little Rock for that
nationally televised affair, after
which Coach John Ralston will
have to cut his troops to 46 for
league games.
But the emphasis in spring
practice is less on the schedule
ahead and more on individual
development and fundamentals
. . . like blocking, tackling,
offense and defense.
In fact, senior players, whose
abilities are already familiar to
Ralston and his flock of assistants,
won't be out for another week
while the staff gives special
attention to younger players and
newcomers.
Like most teams, on paper the
Indians seem to have their
strengths, and then again, they
have weaknesses. Rumor also has
it that the quarterback position is
pretty well filled.
On The Line
More seriously, Stanford's

immediate problems concern the
offensive line, which lost four of
its starters to graduation;
linebacking, where both
linebackers from last season are
gone; the defensive secondary,
which lost two defenders; and the
offensive backfield, which lost
two starting runners.
On the other hand, 34
lettermen return, and available
talent could well fill the existing
gaps.
The other big plus is the return
of senior quarterback Jim
Plunkett, the San Jose
record-breaker who is justifiably
being boomed for Heisman
Trophy honors.
Last year he set six Stanford
and Pac-8 season marks, and,
assuming his continued good
health, he will probably establish
three new Pac-8 career records by
the second or third game of the
season.
Another offensive asset for the
Tribe will be the return of all of
Plunkett's receivers, like Randy
Vataha, Jack Lasater, Bob Moore,
Ron Kadziel and Demea
Washington.
Hillary Shockley and Jackie
Brown figure at the outset to take
the places of Howie Williams and
Bubba Brown at fullback and
running back, respectively, and
Tom Sones and Jeff Siemon will
get first shot at filling the
linebacking spots vacated by Don
Parish and Pat Preston.
According to Ralston's
preliminary depth chart, the
offensive line features Steve Jubb
at strong side tackle, Dan
Lightfoot at strong side guard.
Bob Brown at short side guard
and Bill Meyers, a non-letterman,
at short side tackle.

In the middle of it will be
John Sande, an All-Coast center
last year who, along with Moore
at tight end, is considered by local
experts to be in the running for
first team All-America honors.
The defensive line, considered
young and inexperienced last
season, is all back, with
preliminary top spots going to
Dennis Moore, Dave Tipton, Pete
Lazetich, Jody Graves, Bill
Alexander and Jack Schulz.
Mike Ewing and Miles Moore
figure to replace Rich Keller and
Dick Oliver as the defensive backs,
while Jim Kauffman returns at
safety.
There will also be additional
help coming up from the frosh.
Jesse Freitas and Jim Wise will be
battling for the second QB spot
since Don Bunce will redshirt the
1970 season.

Other offensive prospects
include Reggie Sanderson at
fullback, Pierre Perreault at
tackle, and Eric Cross at running
back.
Frosh defensive hopefuls
feature Ned Chambers and Tom
Klein, ends; Pete Hanson, tackle;
and Charles McCloud, defensive
back.
Transfers who figure to help
include Roger Cowan, a 230
pound defensive lineman from
Santa Monica Junior College;
Mike Simone, a quick linebacker
from Golden West Junior College;
and Tim Robnett, a quick
defensive back from Bakersfield
JC.
But they won't be around
until fall.
Spring practice will run five
days per week, ending May 16.
