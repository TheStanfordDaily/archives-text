# Pitzer Says Move Likely
## Air ROTC May Leave 
### FRANK MILLER 
The Air Force ROTC unit will
"likely" be withdrawn from
campus because of low
enrollment, President Pitzer told
the faculty Senate yesterday.
Stanford Air Force has 36
cadets enrolled this year; there
were 45 last year. Pitzer said:
"Since the enrollment in the Air
Force falls well below the normal
minimum, it seems likely that the
Air Force unit may be withdrawn
for that reason."
Lt. Col. Leon Heinle,
executive head of Air Force
ROTC at Stanford, would not
confirm Pitzer's statement. He
would only say that the viability
of the program here has been
under study for some time and
that the credit issue would have
no influence on any decision.
He said that the Air Force had
received a letter from Pitzer
telling them that if the Air Force
didn't offer a proposal for revising

the contracts similar to the
Army's by May 1, then the Air
Force would be under the 1969
faculty decision on ROTC. That
decision denied credit to ROTC
classes (except for upperclassmen
already enrolled) beginning in
1970.
When asked if the Air Force
would submit a plan, Heinle said:
"I see nothing on the horizon."
Pitzer in his Senate address
indicated that the Navy would
also have to decide on its status
soon because 34 freshmen for
next year have been admitted to
Stanford who are also winners of
Navy ROTC scholarships. Pitzer
has "asked that these students be
informed promptly concerning
status of the Navy ROTC
program."
Pitzer said that the student
referendum on ROTC would be
"influential with me—and 1
assume with others—with respect
to any policy formulated in the
future to the extent that past
student referenda influenced past
decisions."
Upon questioning, Pitzer
admitted that the implication
from his speech is that the ROTC
issue is decided for now and that
any change will have to wait for
next year when the Army ROTC
plan is reviewed.
He indicated the "Closeness of
the faculty vote (on ROTC)
makes clear an unhappy state of
division in the Stanford academic
community as to the merits ... of
the new plan." He hopes that the
one year experience with the new
plan will "lead the Stanford
faculty towards a clear-cut
resolution of these complex issues
in the course of the next academic
year."
Pitzer again expressed his hope

that something could be worked
out with the ROTC punitive
clauses that "would protect the
rights of the individual student,
and would provide protection of
the Government's interest in the
performance of students who have
received scholarship support and
draft deferment."
The faculty group also
unanimously commended Patrick
A. Shea and the other three
members of the Council of
Presidents for their "unstinting
efforts" to improve the academic
environment at Stanford.
Reflecting on the past few
years, Shea said that he feels a
sense of "paralysis" in students
and faculty replacing the hope
and optimism of the 1960'5. The
idea that problems could be
solved has "fallen under a large
cloud of disillusionment" and be
urged that the faculty do
something about that.
Watching Jerry Rubin speak
and the students respond was "a
very frightening experience," sais
Shea. They were caught up in his
rhetoric but also wanted to do
something.
"Someone has to stand up and
say 'we can't throw reason out the
window'—it is the only way we
can solve problems," he
concluded. And the faculty must
do that.

Presidents for their "unstinting
efforts" to improve the academic
environment at Stanford.
Reflecting on the past few
years, Shea said that he feels a
sense of "paralysis" in students
and faculty replacing the hope
and optimism of the 1960'5. The
idea that problems could be
solved has "fallen under a large
cloud of disillusionment" and be
urged that the faculty do
something about that.
Watching Jerry Rubin speak
and the students respond was "a
very frightening experience," sais
Shea. They were caught up in his
rhetoric but also wanted to do
something.
"Someone has to stand up and
say 'we can't throw reason out the
window'—it is the only way we
can solve problems," he
concluded. And the faculty must
do that.
The Air Force ROTC unit will
"likely" be withdrawn from
campus because of low
enrollment, President Pitzer told
the faculty Senate yesterday.
Stanford Air Force has 36
cadets enrolled this year; there
were 45 last year. Pitzer said:
"Since the enrollment in the Air
Force falls well below the normal
minimum, it seems likely that the
Air Force unit may be withdrawn
for that reason."
Lt. Col. Leon Heinle,
executive head of Air Force
ROTC at Stanford, would not
confirm Pitzer's statement. He
would only say that the viability
of the program here has been
under study for some time and
that the credit issue would have
no influence on any decision.
He said that the Air Force had
received a letter from Pitzer
telling them that if the Air Force
didn't offer a proposal for revising

the contracts similar to the
Army's by May 1, then the Air
Force would be under the 1969
faculty decision on ROTC. That
decision denied credit to ROTC
classes (except for upperclassmen
already enrolled) beginning in
1970.
When asked if the Air Force
would submit a plan, Heinle said:
"I see nothing on the horizon."
Pitzer in his Senate address
indicated that the Navy would
also have to decide on its status
soon because 34 freshmen for
next year have been admitted to
Stanford who are also winners of
Navy ROTC scholarships. Pitzer
has "asked that these students be
informed promptly concerning
status of the Navy ROTC
program."
Pitzer said that the student
referendum on ROTC would be
"influential with me—and 1
assume with others—with respect
to any policy formulated in the
future to the extent that past
student referenda influenced past
decisions."
Upon questioning, Pitzer
admitted that the implication
from his speech is that the ROTC
issue is decided for now and that
any change will have to wait for
next year when the Army ROTC
plan is reviewed.
He indicated the "Closeness of
the faculty vote (on ROTC)
makes clear an unhappy state of
division in the Stanford academic
community as to the merits ... of
the new plan." He hopes that the
one year experience with the new
plan will "lead the Stanford
faculty towards a clear-cut
resolution of these complex issues
in the course of the next academic
year."
Pitzer again expressed his hope

that something could be worked
out with the ROTC punitive
clauses that "would protect the
rights of the individual student,
and would provide protection of
the Government's interest in the
performance of students who have
received scholarship support and
draft deferment."
The faculty group also
unanimously commended Patrick
A. Shea and the other three
members of the Council of
Presidents for their "unstinting
efforts" to improve the academic
environment at Stanford.
