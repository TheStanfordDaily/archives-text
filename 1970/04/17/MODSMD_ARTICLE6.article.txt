# Navy Must Submit Own Credit Plan

Navy ROTC officials have been
asked by President Kenneth Pitzer
to stop assuming that the 1969

Academic Council decision on
ROTC. That decision denied
credit to ROTC courses. But
Thomas said Pitzer called him

which allows the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS) to

still under last year's decision,
which says that "after a
transitional period, there should
be no academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education."

1970 freshman class. The classes
currently enrolled would continue

petition for Undergraduate
Special credit as anyone else.

Many faculty members had
agreed with his interpretation in
the past, according to Thomas,
but "no one seems to want to
touch this now that we're
