# Navy Must Submit Own Credit Plan
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Navy ROTC officials have been
asked by President Kenneth Pitzer
to stop assuming that the 1969
faculty decision on ROTC allows
them to submit courses for credit
as Undergraduate Specials.
The Navy has requested
Undergraduate Special credit for
six courses. Colonel Robert L.
Thomas, director of Nava! ROTC,
said he had understood the
Undergraduate Special approach
was not banned by last year's
Academic Council decision on
ROTC. That decision denied
credit to ROTC courses. But
Thomas said Pitzer called him
yesterday and said he "feels I am
assuming too much.''
Only the Army officially falls
under this year's Council decision,
which allows the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS) to
consider each Army course
proposal for academic credit on
its academic merits, with no
presumption that any such
proposal will be accepted."
The Navy and Air Force are
still under last year's decision,
which says that "after a
transitional period, there should
be no academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education."
This would take effect with the
1970 freshman class. The classes
currently enrolled would continue
with credit.
Thomas said that he believes
the 1969 decision only eliminated
RCTTC's power to grant credit to
its courses. He feels ROTC can
still find faculty sponsors and
petition for Undergraduate
Special credit as anyone else.

Many faculty members had
agreed with his interpretation in
the past, according to Thomas,
but "no one seems to want to
touch this now that we're
suddenly coming up with a class"
to submit for credit.
Thomas claimed that faculty
Senate Chairman William Clebsch
had been among those believing
the 1969 decision allowed
Undergraduate Special petitioning
for the Navy and Air Force. But
Clebsch insisted yesterday "that is
a total misquote." Although this
year's decision only covered Army
ROTC, Clebsch said its "legislative
history" showed the faculty
intended that "if the Navy and
Air Force wish to continue, they
shall submit contracts that are not
substantially different from the
contract for the Army."
Thomas objects to submitting
such a new proposal rather than
using his interpretation of the
1969 plan because he thinks
faculty approval will be a long
process that will hold next year's
ROTC freshmen "in limbo."

Navy ROTC petitioned March
16 for Undergraduate Special
credit for two navigation courses.
Four additional course plans were
submitted on April 13.
Pam Wright, a staff member of
CUS conceded that Navy petitions
had been received by the
Committee. She sad
consideration of next fall's
Undergraduate Specials has not
yet begun.
Air Force ROTC officials
apparently had been less certain
they could seek credit under the
1969 proposal. Capt. Carl R.
Oliver, an Air Force ROTC
officer, said the Air Force had
heard conflicting views on the
issue and had been waiting for
clarification. They have not
submitted any courses to the
CUS.
Thomas maintains that the
option of submitting

Undergraduate Specials for credit
was widely accepted by faculty
members when they approved the
1969 "no-credit" decision. As
evidence, he pointed to a Daily
advertisement which appeared
April 15, 1969. The advertisement
was signed by 17 professors who
supported the 1969 decision.
One of their arguments was as
follows: "A military officer at
Stanford with an extra-curricular
ROTC program would still be free
to submit any course he might
like to teach for academic credit
to the Committee on
Undergraduate Education for
approval as an Undergraduate
Special course."
Professor Clebsch, who now
disagrees with that interpretation,
was one of those signing the
advertisement. However, in recent
months several of those who
signed have said they had not read
it first.

Thomas said Pitzer called him
yesterday and said he "feels I am
assuming too much.''
Only the Army officially falls
under this year's Council decision,
which allows the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS) to
consider each Army course
proposal for academic credit on
its academic merits, with no
presumption that any such
proposal will be accepted."
The Navy and Air Force are
still under last year's decision,
which says that "after a
transitional period, there should
be no academic credit received for
participation in programs of
military training and education."
This would take effect with the
1970 freshman class. The classes
currently enrolled would continue
with credit.
Thomas said that he believes
the 1969 decision only eliminated
RCTTC's power to grant credit to
its courses. He feels ROTC can
still find faculty sponsors and
petition for Undergraduate
Special credit as anyone else.

Many faculty members had
agreed with his interpretation in
the past, according to Thomas,
but "no one seems to want to
touch this now that we're
suddenly coming up with a class"
to submit for credit.
Thomas claimed that faculty
Senate Chairman William Clebsch
had been among those believing
the 1969 decision allowed
Undergraduate Special petitioning
for the Navy and Air Force. But
Clebsch insisted yesterday "that is
a total misquote." Although this
year's decision only covered Army
ROTC, Clebsch said its "legislative
history" showed the faculty
intended that "if the Navy and
Air Force wish to continue, they
shall submit contracts that are not
substantially different from the
contract for the Army."
Thomas objects to submitting
such a new proposal rather than
using his interpretation of the
1969 plan because he thinks
faculty approval will be a long
process that will hold next year's
ROTC freshmen "in limbo."

Navy ROTC petitioned March
16 for Undergraduate Special
credit for two navigation courses.
Four additional course plans were
submitted on April 13.
Pam Wright, a staff member of
CUS conceded that Navy petitions
had been received by the
Committee. She sad
consideration of next fall's
Undergraduate Specials has not
yet begun.
Air Force ROTC officials
apparently had been less certain
they could seek credit under the
1969 proposal. Capt. Carl R.
Oliver, an Air Force ROTC
officer, said the Air Force had
heard conflicting views on the
issue and had been waiting for
clarification. They have not
submitted any courses to the
CUS.
Thomas maintains that the
option of submitting

Undergraduate Specials for credit
was widely accepted by faculty
members when they approved the
1969 "no-credit" decision. As
evidence, he pointed to a Daily
advertisement which appeared
April 15, 1969. The advertisement
was signed by 17 professors who
supported the 1969 decision.
One of their arguments was as
follows: "A military officer at
Stanford with an extra-curricular
ROTC program would still be free
to submit any course he might
like to teach for academic credit
to the Committee on
Undergraduate Education for
approval as an Undergraduate
Special course."
Professor Clebsch, who now
disagrees with that interpretation,
was one of those signing the
advertisement. However, in recent
months several of those who
signed have said they had not read
it first.

Thomas, director of Nava! ROTC,
said he had understood the
