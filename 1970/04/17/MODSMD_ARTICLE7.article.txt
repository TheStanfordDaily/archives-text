# Shea, Shoch Win; ROTC Credit Out
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
An unusually high primary
turnout has carried the John
Shoch-Bill Evers slate and the Pat
C. Shea-Hal Mickelson-Bob
Grant-Adam Levin ticket into the
ASSU presidential run-off.
Students also voted 3616-1898
to bar credit from ROTC courses,
but chose to keep the program on
campus bv a slim 138 vote margin
(2919-2781).
A proposed constitutional
amendment to make ASSU
membership voluntary was voted
down, with 2868 voting no and
2171 voting yes. Two-thirds of
the vote was needed for passage.
A run-off election must be
held, however, to determine
whether students will pay $1 or
$3 in ASSU dues each quarter
next year. Special $1 per quarter

assessments were approved for the
l)ail> and Special Events Board.
A run-off must also be held to
determine whether John Ford,
Teresa Cade, Dave Velasquez and
John Elger (with 237 votes) or
Taylor Crosby, Margaret Earl and
Phil Feldman (with 318 votes)
will be Senior Class officers.
Votes for new Student
Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) members must be
tabulated by the Hare System,
and the results will not be released
until at least a week from today.
Near Record Vote
According to elections
commissioner Jan Westl'all, 5749
students voted in the election.
Only 3549 voted in last year's
presidential primary.
The run-off election is
scheduled Wednesday and
Thursday next week for the
presidential election, the fee
assessment, and senior class
officers.
llukari Third
Shea's slate actually received
433 more votes than Shoch and
Evers in balloting Wednesday and
yesterday.
However, their total falls short
of the 50 percent needed for
election.
Harvev Hukari ran third with
1018 votes. The Bob
Mattson-Loudin Beam—Bob Cory
slate and the Charles
Kitsman-John Pratt slate trailed
with 829 and 128 votes,
respectively.
Shea (no relation to current
president Patrick A. Shea) and his
running mates waged a campaign

emphasizing improved student
services.
They opposed credit for
ROTC, but favored keeping it as
an extra-curricular activity.
'Truth To Power'
Shoch and Evers, under the
slogan "Speaking Truth to
Power," campaigned for
elimination of ROTC. They
emphasized asserting the
independence of ASSU from the
University administration.
In a statement released before
final tallies were made last night,
Shea commented, "Of course wt
are gratified at the yet unofficial
results. It appears that all of the
stands we took in our initial
position papers were generally
accepted by the student
community, and we now hope to
fulfill the program we have set out
to implement."
Shoch and Evers stated: "In
the last two years we have
witnessed the disintegration of the
ASSU into a mere rubber stamp
for the University
administration —sometimes seen
but rarely heard from. During the
course of our campaign, we've
learned that students are prepared
to cast off this idea that a
moribund ASSU is acceptable.
"The campaign has been
designed to challenge that idea
and stimulate discussion of the
overriding issues—we hope that
the next week will provide further
opportunities for students to
assess the nature of this
University."
They are holding a meeting at
1 p.m. today in Soto House.
