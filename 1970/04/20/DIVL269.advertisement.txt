m Cassettes
I Are Not
I A T °y !
Judging by the proliferation of $20 cas
sette recorders on the market, you might
tend to think so.
But cassettes, in a quality recorder such as
the Sony, can give you high-quality, satis
fying results.
At Lafayette you'll find Sony cassette re
corders in a wide range of prices, from
$69.50 with automatic volume control and
exclusive "Review" backspacing device to
$169.50 for full portable stereo, each with
unequalled Sony quality.
I Step out of the toy class — hear the Sony
quality cassettes at Lafayette!
