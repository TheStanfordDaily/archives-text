# Protestors To Sit-In If Ultimatum Denied
## 
### 
The anti-ROTC movement
voted last night to present
President Kenneth Pitzer today
with a three-point ultimatum
demanding among other
conditions, the immediate
withdrawal of ROTC from
campus.
The group agreed that if terms
of the demand are not met by
Thursday noon, it will sit-in at a
site to be determined during a
Thursday noon rally. A regional
"Off ROTC, Free Bobby Seale
Solidarity Day" is also slated for
Thursday in the Bay area.
Other demands included in the
ultimatum call for the
University to drop civil court suits
and SJC proceedings against all
anti-ROTC protestors, and that
the University rescind its
recommendation that Paul Rupert
be banned from campus.
Rally Today
The exact wording of the
ultimatum is being written
overnight by a committee
appointed at the close of last
night's meeting. A copy will be
presented to a representative of
Pitzer during the course of a noon
rally and march originating on
White Plaza today.
About 250 people were present
in the middle of the meeting as
the Brown Berets took over the
platform, but the crowd slipped
away as the meeting droned on
considering numerous procedural
matters. When the meeting was
adjourned by Chairman D.
Maguire, less than 100 people
remained in the auditorium.
I The Daily learned last night
that Pitzer is in Washington, D.C.,
and is not expected to return until
Wednesday.)
The Movement also voted to
sponsor a "solidarity statement"
which will be circulated
throughout the dormitories. The

statement will ask signers to
support a sit-in should Pitzer
refuse to comply with the
demands set forth in the
ultimatum.
Brown Berets
The meeting, which was held in
Cubberly Auditorium, was
interrupted at the close of the
first hour by a group of about 15
members of the Brown Berets, a
militant Chicano organization,
and 25 members of MECHA, a
campus Chicano group that
recently sponsored "La Semana
de la Raza."
Amidst applause and cries of
"right on," the leader of the
Berets, announced, "This is a
stickup." He asked for donations
to Venceramos College, in
Redwood City, a Chicano school
similar to the black Nairobi
College. He also demanded
signatures on a petition to remove
a San Jose judge who expressed
anti-Chicano sentiments during a
trial late last year.
Confrontation
A member of the Worker
Student Alliance (WSA) faction of
SDS then tried to critisize the
intruders, but he was drowned out
by the audience. A scuffle broke
out between WSA supporters and
the Brown Berets. The WSA
advocate was eventually thrown
out of the room by the Berets. He
returned a few minutes later, and
again was booed down when he
tried to speak.
After exhorting the students
present to forget their
"revolutionary grade points," the
Chicanos left the meeting to a
standing ovation.
Six basic proposals were
introduced during the meeting:
-a sit-in to be held at the end of
the week, possibly a mobile one,
with the Old Union or the ROTC
building as primary targets;

-that a student strike be
implemented with the Quad as its
primary target;
-that an undefended sit-in be
held today, as part of major plan
for escalation leading to
additional action later in the
week;
-that the Steering Committee of
Academic Council be asked to
reconsider its decision on credit in
light of the student referendum
just held;
-that a sit-out be held in front
of Pitzer's office and that military
recruiters on campus be harrassed.
After three hours of debate, the
group decided to issue their
ultimatum and to demand a
Thursday response. It then
considered procedural matters,
including possible realignment of
the affinity groups.
