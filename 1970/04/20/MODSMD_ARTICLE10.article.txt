# Greek Purpose
## Fraternity Identity 
### Gordon Norman 
(This column concludes an article in Friday's DAILY on
Fraternities.)
What is often cited as the basic problem of fraternities is corporate
identity and purpose. Perhaps fraternities, insofar as they represent a
highly effective vehicle for autonomy and camaraderie, exist for no
greater purpose. Perhaps corporate identity is not feasible or even
desirable in a living group that professes to value diversity as much as
cohesion.
Certainly the fraternities at Stanford differ in many ways from each
other, but they all seem to share the common problem of egocentric
members, each committed to his individual endeavors and personal
life-style. In a university which consists of virtually all chiefs and no
braves, very little fraternal chauvinism is to be expected. But this is
not necessarily a disadvantage; it certainly allows greater freedom of
action, and a wider range of attitudes and ideas than the so-called
traditional fraternity which, to my way of thinking, is not altogether
unlike a herd of sheep.
I'm trying to avoid the tautological premise that fraternities'
advantages are the fundamental cause of their problems, but there's
no question that the emphasis on wide diversity of attitudes,
backgrounds, interests and their ensuing interplay robs fraternities of
some of the cohesion they might otherwise be able to generate.
I, for one, happen to believe that this continual interaction,
whether across the volleyball net, across the dinner table, or across the
bar stool, makes fraternity life an appealing and worthwhile
experience; in addition, I believe some form of this type of experience
is considerable amounts is absolutely necessary for the development
of one's own world view, perhaps the most essential task of the
undergraduate years.
Selectivity is another issue which has traditionally received more
notoriety than it deserves. Fraternities have always been charged with
the responsibility of justifying their policies of selection. Surely no
other selective organization on campus has ever come under finer
scrutiny by the community at large, which leads me to believe that
thus singling out of fraternities is itself, hardly justifiable. Selection,
per se, does not simply discrimination—very few fraternities at
Stanford utilize selection procedures which are more discriminatory
than University admissions policy or dorm assignment.
Positive Vote System
Selection systems here are predominately positive-vote
systems—i.e., methods aimed at inclusion rather than exclusion.
Certainly these systems are subjective, but does that necessarily mean
unfair? Fraternities are, after all, organizations which are joined by
individual choice; isn't the fraternity entitled to some choice of its
own? As a matter of fact, there has been talk in the Inter-Fraternity
Council for two years about a computerized mutual-preference draw
system, and some fraternity officials have expressed confidence that
such a draw system would not appreciably change the actual
selections from what they would otherwise be. If interest continues to
grow, and the necessary finances, facilities, and personel become
available, perhaps the fraternities will be rid of at least one popular
criticism in the near future.
It seems to me that the real problems of fraternities are not these
points, but rather much more subtle and complex issues which are a
function of people and personal differences. Though the system
certainly does have its faults, and these are not to be ignored, let us
not use structure or policy as convenient scapegoats whenever
difficulties arise. It seems that individual egocentricity, extensive
commitment to various sociopolitical issues and philosophies, personal
identity confusion, and the pervasive and anxieties of the
times are far more significant as causative factors determining the
spirit and tenor of fraternities at Stanford.
It is my hope that we can all stop rushing around long enough to
seriously examine the various houses, and devote the time and
consideration necessary to form an opinion on fraternities as a living
alternative. In the light of recent concern about freedom of choice, we
can hardly afford not to exercise it now, and that requires us to be
familiar with the alternatives. So go out and exercise your personal
freedom during the next two weeks—try Rushing, for a change!

Selectivity is another issue which has traditionally received more
notoriety than it deserves. Fraternities have always been charged with
the responsibility of justifying their policies of selection. Surely no
other selective organization on campus has ever come under finer
scrutiny by the community at large, which leads me to believe that
thus singling out of fraternities is itself, hardly justifiable. Selection,
per se, does not simply discrimination—very few fraternities at
Stanford utilize selection procedures which are more discriminatory
than University admissions policy or dorm assignment.
Positive Vote System
Selection systems here are predominately positive-vote
systems—i.e., methods aimed at inclusion rather than exclusion.
Certainly these systems are subjective, but does that necessarily mean
unfair? Fraternities are, after all, organizations which are joined by
individual choice; isn't the fraternity entitled to some choice of its
own? As a matter of fact, there has been talk in the Inter-Fraternity
Council for two years about a computerized mutual-preference draw
system, and some fraternity officials have expressed confidence that
such a draw system would not appreciably change the actual
selections from what they would otherwise be. If interest continues to
grow, and the necessary finances, facilities, and personel become
available, perhaps the fraternities will be rid of at least one popular
criticism in the near future.
It seems to me that the real problems of fraternities are not these
points, but rather much more subtle and complex issues which are a
function of people and personal differences. Though the system
certainly does have its faults, and these are not to be ignored, let us
not use structure or policy as convenient scapegoats whenever
difficulties arise. It seems that individual egocentricity, extensive
commitment to various sociopolitical issues and philosophies, personal
identity confusion, and the pervasive and anxieties of the
times are far more significant as causative factors determining the
spirit and tenor of fraternities at Stanford.
It is my hope that we can all stop rushing around long enough to
seriously examine the various houses, and devote the time and
consideration necessary to form an opinion on fraternities as a living
alternative. In the light of recent concern about freedom of choice, we
can hardly afford not to exercise it now, and that requires us to be
familiar with the alternatives. So go out and exercise your personal
freedom during the next two weeks—try Rushing, for a change!

What is often cited as the basic problem of fraternities is corporate
identity and purpose. Perhaps fraternities, insofar as they represent a
highly effective vehicle for autonomy and camaraderie, exist for no
greater purpose. Perhaps corporate identity is not feasible or even
desirable in a living group that professes to value diversity as much as
cohesion.
Certainly the fraternities at Stanford differ in many ways from each
other, but they all seem to share the common problem of egocentric
members, each committed to his individual endeavors and personal
life-style. In a university which consists of virtually all chiefs and no
braves, very little fraternal chauvinism is to be expected. But this is
not necessarily a disadvantage; it certainly allows greater freedom of
action, and a wider range of attitudes and ideas than the so-called
traditional fraternity which, to my way of thinking, is not altogether
unlike a herd of sheep.
I'm trying to avoid the tautological premise that fraternities'
advantages are the fundamental cause of their problems, but there's
no question that the emphasis on wide diversity of attitudes,
backgrounds, interests and their ensuing interplay robs fraternities of
some of the cohesion they might otherwise be able to generate.
I, for one, happen to believe that this continual interaction,
whether across the volleyball net, across the dinner table, or across the
bar stool, makes fraternity life an appealing and worthwhile
experience; in addition, I believe some form of this type of experience
is considerable amounts is absolutely necessary for the development
of one's own world view, perhaps the most essential task of the
undergraduate years.
