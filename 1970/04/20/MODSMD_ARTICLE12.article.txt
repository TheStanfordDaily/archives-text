# Civilized Problems
## Confusion Of Wealth And Symbols 
### Barry Wood 
According to Alan Watts the key problem for civilized man is his
confusion of reality with symbol. The United States for example, is
first a physical territory full of lakes, forests, animals, and people.
Second, it is a political state with a flag and national anthem, in
competition with other states like the USSR and China. The first U.S.
is real, concrete, material; the second abstract and symbolic. If the
U.S. continues to lay such emphasis on existing in the second sense
she will soon cease to exist in the first sense.
This is the theme of "Wealth Versus Money," the opening essay in
Watts' latest book Does It Mailer? which carried the subtitle "Essays
in Man's Relation to Materiality." Out of 5 long essays and 7 short
ones, "Wealth Versus Money" is by far the best, having won the
Playboy award for the best article published in that magazine in 1968
(December issue).
Real wealth, says Watts, consists of food, clothing, shelter, and
human companionship. In order to exchange goods we once had to
carry such wealth on our backs, trading off our apples for cotton or
tobacco. Now we are more sensible, since we have invented symbols
for our wealth, that is, money. But, although it saves our backs, we
are now lost in hopeless confusion.
Now we work for money, not wealth, thinking a man very rich if he
has so much money that he can't spend it all. We reach absurdity
when real wealth, such as good fruit or grain, piles up in warehouses
while someone starves for lack of money that is, for lack of symbols.
Real Wealth of the Depression
During the depression we had just as much real wealth. The nations
ol the world still produces food and clothing. The rivers still flowed
and the wind blew. But somehow we got our symbols bogged down in
the stock market and could not measure out the wealth to the people.
Man has not learned to deal in real wealth without manipulating
symbols (money), which is something like a builder who can't
construct a house because he has run out of inches.
Here we are, says Watts, with a machine technology ready to release
most ol its lor a true age of leisure. But, alas, so hung up are we on
working "for money" that we allow machines to put us "out of
work," thereby forcing us to go hungry. We think the unemployed are
sad cases, whereas we ought to celebrate their freedom. But, since
machines don't eat food (yet), why not pay people for the work done
by machines? This would get our work done, release us for leisure,
and give us money to buy food.
The confusion of nation with land and money with wealth are
aspects of another confusion —mistaking our bodies for ourselves. Not
realizing that the total environmt it is a web, and therefore an

extension of our own bodies, we have gone about looting the world of
real wealth for the purely abstract benefits of making money or
jacking up the economy. The result has been the diminishment of
ourselves.
Liberating Vietnam
Once upon a time we fought wars for real wealth, for the loot and
women we could drag home. Now we fight them for abstractions like
"freedom" or "halting communism," which means that we liberate
Vietnam by defoliating its forests, craterizing the landscape, and
napalming its people.
Once upon a time we made fine pottery, musical instruments,
clothing and metalwork so beautiful that we now hoard them in our
museums. Now, for the abstraction of pure money, we turn out
mountains of mass-produced trash which is hardly fit for the dump.
Once upon a time we carried from nature what we could carry,
leaving the rest intact. Now, for the abstract riches of money we take
more than we can carry. Indeed, we take everything that can possibly
be sold. This disrespect for nature, resulting in the depletion of
wildlife, strip mining over millions of acres of land, and the logging of
the giant redwoods, turns out to be a desecration of our own lives and
a loss of our humanity.
Poor, Poor People
By searching for money we are destroying our wealth and becoming
a poor, poor people. By making war on nature we have made ourselves
sick on our own garbage and filth. What we now need is what Watts
calls an "ecological technology—that is, a technology in which man
has as much respect for his environment as for himself."
Thus Watts would like us to take Timothy Leary's advice of going
out of our minds to come to our senses. Getting out of our minds
means throwing out purely abstract nonsense like money, status,
nationalism, and opposition to such conceptual bogeys as
communism, fascism, and evil. Coming to our senses means waking up
to the fact that our own bodies, the whole natural world, and the rest
of the beautiful people on this planet are groovey as can be.
Getting all this together means the discovery of real wealth. It
means a life that makes ecological sense. And, it means turning
American energy to real, concrete wealth rather than abstract
symbolism. For, as Watts sees it, Americans are not "materialistic" at
all, since they have a distain for the material and are hung up on
abstractions like weights and measures, tonnages and (INP's. A
healthy dose of real materialism is exactly what we need.
