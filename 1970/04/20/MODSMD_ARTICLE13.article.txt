# Behind The Scene
## Some Thoughts On Paul Rupert 
### Joe Hardegree 
Paul Rupert - a 1967 Stanford
graduate, a pacifist, a sometime
member of the campus ministry
staff, and a leader of the April
Third Movement - has been given
ten days to get out and stay out
of Santa Clara County for a
period of five years as a part of his
sentence for refusing induction in
1968. And therein hangs a tale.
Paul (and the rest of us who
were close enough to know the
situation and care about it) had
reason to be optimistic last fall
when his case came before the
ninth district court of Judge
Stanley A. Weigel. Stanford
alumnus Weigel was known to be
unhappy about the selective
service system and generally fair
in the draft cases that came before
his court. The trial seemed to
justify the optimism. Judge Weigel
gave every indication of real
sympathy and even decided to
suspend judgment until a similar
case before the Supreme Court
which had an outside chance of
overturning a part of the selective
service law had been decided. In
any event, he made it clear that
the likelihood of Paul actually
going to prison was very slight.
With this good news Paul and
his lawyer decided it would be
good to begin seeking some form
of alternative service since this
might be included in the sentence

to come from Judge Weigel. Quite
naturally, Paul began to talk with
some members of the board and
staff of the United Campus
Christian Ministry (UCCM), for
whom he had worked the previous
year, about a job as a campus
ministry intern. Arrangements
were worked out and he prepared
to go back before the court, ask
for a judgment, and seek to have
the campus ministry position
accepted as his alternative service.
Meanwhile, the university
administration began putting on
the pressure. There was, first ol
all, the fact that Paul had been a
leader in the April Third
Movement. But even more
important than that, he was
presently active in Grass Roots, a
movement group that is seriously
challenging Stanford's land use
policies. So far, Grass Roots had
done nothing illegal or disruptive.
It has put on a few
demonstrations, done some good
guerrilla theater, and published
some excellent pamphlets. But the
potential is there for generating a
great deal of opposition to
Stanford's land policies and the
administration knows it.
Pressure From Lyman
The pressure came from
Provost Richard Lyman, who
talked with the chairman of the
UCCM Board on at least three

separate occasions. The essence of
Lyman's messages was: 1. The
University would be extremely
unhappy if Rupert was added to
the UCCM staff and thus made
"legitimate" as a campus figure; 2.
If UCCM persisted in this matter
it was courting the possibility of
being thrown off campus; 3. If
Rupert was added to the staff,
UCCM should communicate to
the court the fact that it (UCCM)
was not officially a part of the
University structure and that
Rupert's staff job was not the
University's doing; and 4. The
University might find it necessary
to direct its own communication
to the court.
This time, however, Juoge
Weigel's mood had changed. In a
rather gruff tone of voice he asked
questions or made comments
about window-breaking,
rock-throwing, and disrupting
meetings of Boards of Trustees
(None of which Paul had ever
engaged in or advocated). He also
asked if Paul's 'stand against
violence was only for himself or
did it extend as his
recommendation for others as
well. It was quite obvious that the
Judge who did not like the
Selective Service System did not
like the radical student movement
either.
Sentence Comes Down
The sentence came down. It
was: Five years of probation, the
first twenty-four consecutive
months of which were to be spent
in "alternative service in the
national interest"; and, after a
period of ten days Paul was to
stay out of Santa Clara County
during the probation period. The
meaning was very clear. Judge
Weigel was bent on removing him
from any possibility of working
with the Movement at Stanford
University.
It seems to me that when you
put together Stanford's activities
before the trial with Judge
Weigel's sentence at least three
conclusions can be reasonably

drawn.
First of all, we are reminded
once again of the way powerful
figures in major institutions (like
Stanford University and the U.S.
Court system) have ways of
communicating with and
influencing one another behind
the scenes that are very unfair to
those who do not have similar
powers. There are many ways in
which the Stanford administration
and trustees could have made
their wishes known to Judge
Weigel.
Secondly, this is another
example of how political
repression can be manipulated.
This is not the first time a
sentence related to a draft
violation is used to deal with
other political matters. President
Pitzer has gone on record as being
opposed to the draft in its present
form yet it was a draft violation
that is being used to get Paul
Rupert- off the Stanford campus.
â€¢Finally, it appears the
University administration prefers
a kept campus ministry rather
than one that is free to relate to
people and issues according to its
own moral judgments. This is not
the first time the administration
has tried to influence the politics
of the campus ministry. Last fall
Pitzer himself asked the Dean of
the Cahpel to make sure that
"Rupert and Hardegree" stayed in
line. It is to Dean Napier's credit
that he did not knuckle under.
I can only say that a campus
ministry must be truly free to
make its own moral and political
decisions or else it is not worth
anything to anyone, including the
community that exists at
Stanford. My own political
options (and I hope those of my
campus ministry colleagues) will
be chosen from a greater range
than that found within the narrow
confines of the administration's
side of political controversy.
