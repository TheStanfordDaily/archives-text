# Student Power
## Shoch Versus Pitzer 
### Jay Speas Barry Askinas 
Two years ago a sit-in at
Stanford produced a document
which it was then thought would
take the power of persecution out
of the hands of the president and
establish a system of justice by
and for the community. That
document was the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968. But now
we have the Chairman of the
Student Senate, John Shoch, who
is regularly invited to attend the
Academic Senate, charged with
contempt of an injunction
because he is alleged to have been
present uninvited at an Academic
Council meeting.
The clause in the Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 1968
seized upon by the president to
justify his contempt action states:
"except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and the
SJC shall have primary
responsibility for promulgating
such regulations and adjudicating
violations thereof." But if the
President considers the fifteen
minute delay of an Academic
Council meeting by a group of
singing demonstrators and three
other short-lived "disruptions" of
University activities to be

"extraordinary circumstances"
then he will consider any
disruption "extraordinary"
making the whole Charter
worthless.
That leaves us where we were
two springs ago: the President is
out of control and his power must
be restricted by faculty-student
authority.
Pitzer's use of the courts might
seem less odious if he didn't garb
his reasons in the Fundamental
Standard, the "emergency
provisions" (look for the fine
print) of the SCLC, and the Old
Testament. Why doesn't he simply
say: Our judicial system stinks
and we've called in the Sheriff and
the Julius Hoffman's to deal with
the ragers.
Faculty Failure
The faculty has failed to bring
the president to heel. They failed
when they allowed the president
to push through his ROTC
Contract. One wonders what
would have happened to SES and
academic reform (now a dead
issue at Stanford) if the president
had put a little weight behind it.
The contract ignored the
requirements for such an
agreement expressed bv an earlier

vote of the Senate and Council. It
was this hypocritical and
unprincipled reversal which
sparked the current unfortunate
outburst of rock throwing and the
more restrained non-violent
demonstrations of concerned
students.
Now, when the president has
disregarded the community's
system of justice, not one faculty
member has publically raised his
voice in protest.
When the students have no
power to restrict the president's
anarchical acts, and the faculty
will not do so themselves, their
only resort is to anarchy; anarchy
on campus can be ended only
when the president is brought
under control.
But not only has the faculty
failed to help solve the problem,
but they are PART of the
Problem. We still can't figure out
why Academic Council and
Trustee meetings are behind
closed doors. They are almost
uniformly dull. If they were open,
anybody with half a brain would
soon lose interestâ€”if they did not
first become outraged. Maybe fear
of outrage is the reason why
meetings are held behind closed
doors.
Why So Perplexed?
And we are more than
perplexed by the behavior of
many senior faculty who wildly if
not hysterically applaud the
president for dealing soundly with
those "student dissidents." Do
they really have their heads in the
sand? Their votes on KOTC and
the Nader proposals would seem
to indicate that they do. If the
faculty cannot perceive that the
times and values have changed,
that many of them have become
irrelevant to the educational
process, and if they can't adapt
then some of them are going to
find their plummage ruffled, and
not by so called radical students,
but by their own students who are
going to want to know if they can
still teach.
Many of the failures of the
community's present system of
government can still be overcome.
They can be overcome by
students achieving a certain
amount of power within the
University, other than the
non-real power to advise and
power to participate in a judicial
system which the president shall
ignore when an important
situation arises. We are tired of
running around this campus trying
to help resolve crisis situations
which arise because students'
legitimate right to a share in the
governance of their university has
been ignored. On Wednesday and
Thursday students can take (he
first step towards achieving their
rightful place by voting for John
Shoch, who is the only candidate
in this year's election who will
work vigorously to achieve
students' rightful position within
the University's government. Even
Harvey's boys can sympathize
with that.
