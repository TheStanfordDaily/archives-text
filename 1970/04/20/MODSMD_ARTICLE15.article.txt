the legendary "Egypte, O
Egypte", Cocteau's last creative

replace his lost model-Sweet
Wounded Bird.
The International Association

Silent Film Series will present two
films: "Mother", V.I. Pudovkin's
interpretation of Gorky's novel
about the 1905 revolution; and
"Earth" (1930), by Alexader
Dovzhenko, which has been
described by Pauline Kael as "a
passionate lyric on collectivization
and the continuity of man. death,

and nature." The program will be
repeated at 7, 8 and 9.
"Genesis II"
"Genesis II", a two hour
program of award-winning short
films will be shown Friday, April
24 at 7 and 9:30 in Memorial
Auditorium. This collection of 16
new films made by student and
independent film makers from
across the country will be
presented by ASSU as an
exclusive feature in this area. The
program is a representative
cross-section of what's happening
in motion picture production and
in avant-garde film making
Among the sixteen films are a
number of festival prize winners.
"Demonstration Movie I",
"Project I", "The Tempest", and
"Campus Christi", made by
Stanford graduate students D.B.
Jones and J.K. Jennings. If
"Genesis II" is half as good as
"Genesis I", shown on campus
last year, it is definately worth
seeing.
Psychplogy majors and
Bergman fans have an opportunity
to see "Hour of the Wolf",
Wednesday at 7:30, 9:lb, anu
11:00 in Cubberly. When asked to
describe his film, Bergman would
only say: "The hour of the wolf is
the time between night and dawn.
It is the hour when most people
lie, when sleep is deepest, when
nightmares are most palpable. It is
the hour when sleepers are
pursued by their sharpest
anxieties, when ghosts and
demons hold sway. The hour of
the wolf is also the hour when
most children are born."
Max von Sydow ("The Seventh
Seal", "The Face", "The Greatest
Story Ever Told", "Shame",
"Hawaii") and Liv Ullmann
("Persona" and "Shame") co-star
in this Hitch c ockian,
psychodramatic, symbolic
masterpiece.
Premiere
Thursday, April 23, ASSU will
present Jan Nemec's "Martyrs of
Love" at 7, 9 and 11 in Memorial
Auditorium. The film, a Bay Area
Premiere, consists of a cynical
trilogy of daydreams about
youth's romantic yearnings,
entitled "The Junior Clerks
Temptation", "Anastasia's
Dream", and "Orphan Rudolph's
Adventure". Acclaimed by critics
from "Playboy" to "The New
York Times", "Martyrs" is
considered among the best of the
genre of stylized cinema. Included
in the program will be two shorts;
"Homo Ludens" from Sweden
and "Apprenticeship" from
Czechoslovakia.
Also on Friday, Federico
Fellini's expose of the vices (or
virtues, depending on your
definition) of a decadent society
will be shown at 7:30 and 10:30
in Cubberly. "La Dolce Vita"
stars Marcello Mastroianni, Anouk
Aimee as a rich nymphomaniac,
Yvonne Furneau as the mistress,
and Anita Ekberg as a movie star.
The film is a must for Italy I -
XIX and anyone interested in how
a petit bourgeois, preoccupied
with the philosophic notions of
Good and Evil, found happiness in
the Trevi Fourtain.

Wednesday at 7:30, 9:lb, anu
11:00 in Cubberly. When asked to
describe his film, Bergman would
only say: "The hour of the wolf is
the time between night and dawn.
It is the hour when most people
lie, when sleep is deepest, when
nightmares are most palpable. It is
the hour when sleepers are
pursued by their sharpest
anxieties, when ghosts and
demons hold sway. The hour of
the wolf is also the hour when
most children are born."
Max von Sydow ("The Seventh
Seal", "The Face", "The Greatest
Story Ever Told", "Shame",
"Hawaii") and Liv Ullmann

Aimee as a rich nymphomaniac,

The film is a must for Italy I -
XIX and anyone interested in how
a petit bourgeois, preoccupied
with the philosophic notions of
Good and Evil, found happiness in
the Trevi Fourtain.
This week, two experimental
film series and five films by
European directors, including

Wounded Bird.

last year, it is definately worth
seeing.
Psychplogy majors and
Bergman fans have an opportunity
to see "Hour of the Wolf",
Wednesday at 7:30, 9:lb, anu
11:00 in Cubberly. When asked to
describe his film, Bergman would
only say: "The hour of the wolf is
the time between night and dawn.
It is the hour when most people
lie, when sleep is deepest, when
nightmares are most palpable. It is
the hour when sleepers are
pursued by their sharpest
anxieties, when ghosts and
demons hold sway. The hour of
the wolf is also the hour when
most children are born."
Max von Sydow ("The Seventh
Seal", "The Face", "The Greatest
Story Ever Told", "Shame",
"Hawaii") and Liv Ullmann
("Persona" and "Shame") co-star
in this Hitch c ockian,
psychodramatic, symbolic
