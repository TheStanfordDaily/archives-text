# SCLC Legislation

### 
Ed. Note: The following
statement is an explanation of
Student Conduct Legislative
Council legislation that becomes
effective after its publication of
the Daily. Following the
explanation, the entire text of the
legislation is printed.
The action of the Student
Conduct Legislative Council on
April 19, 1970 in enacting new
Interim Legislation has the effect
of superseding President Pitzer's
Interim Legislation of April S, but
does not repeal his order closing
the R.O.T.C. building to all but
authorized persons. This new
interim legislation by the SCLC
goes into effect immediately and
remains valid for 90 days.
Because a number of members
of the SCLC feel that this or
similar legislation should be
enacted on a permanent basis,
publication in the Daily of this
interim rule also constitutes a
draft presentation under Article I,
Section D, I. b. of the Legislative
and Judicial Charter. Comments
and suggestions for revision of the
draft presentation should be
submitted in writing to Professor
Hubert Marshall, Chairman,

SCLC, c/o Department of Political
Science, as soon as possible but
not later than May 6. Anyone
wishing to make an oral
presentation to the SCLC should
contact Mrs. Elizabeth Rafferty,
extension 2607, before April 30.
Whenever the President finds
that a building or any part of a
building on the campus cannot
effectively be used for its
authorized operations, or when
the safety and security of persons,
records, equipment, or property
therein are endangered, because of
the presence of persons in the
building and a clearly defined area
surrounding the building to be
closed for a stated period of time,
not to exceed thirty days, to all
persons or to all persons not
having authorized business
therein. In the latter case,
designees of the President, who
shall be stationed at an entrance
or entrances to the building, shall
authorize and regulate access to
the building to categories of
persons publicly designated by the
President.
If the President wishes to open
a building prior to the end of the

stated period for which it was
closed, he may do so by a formal
declaration to that effect. If a
building remains closed until the
end of the stated period, the
President may extend or re-extend
the period for a definite time, but
no one extension shall exceed
thirty days.
Whenever the President is
absent, all his powers and
obligations states above shall be
exercised by the Acting President.
Any student who enters or
remains in a building or the
clearly defined area surrounding
the building in violation of an
order closing the building is guilty
of an offense punishable by the
Stanford Judicial Council.
This legislation supersedes the
President's Interim Legislation
promulgated on Wednesday, April
8, 1970, under Article I, Section
D, 2. b. of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, as
amended. Nothing herein shall
invalidate any order issued by the
President under the legislation
herein superseded, which orders,
if otherwise valid, shall remain in
full force and effect.
