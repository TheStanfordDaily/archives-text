## 
### 
The Committee of Fifteen
recommended to President
Kenneth Pitzer Friday that he
establish an advisory committee
of students, faculty, and
administrators to deal with
University crises.
The proposal calls for equal
representation of all groups on
the committee and asks that the
president "consult with this
body except when immediate
action is required to avert
imminent danger of injury to
persons or serious damage to
property."
The committee would advise
the President "as to actions the
University should take to
prevent an impending crisis or to
adequately deal with an existing
crisis."
There is now in existence a

unofficial and functions as a
collection of individuals

the president. He normally
consults them concerning
campus disruptions and his
response to them. The chairman

included in this group.
The Committee of Fifteen has
