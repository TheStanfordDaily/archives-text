# Stanford Student, Dynamite Seized
## 
### 
A bundle of seven sticks of
dynamite, two bags of explosive
powder, and several firearms
including an automatic rifle were
seized Saturday from the home of
a Stanford graduate student.
Thomas E. Mosher, 28, was
booked on charges of threatening
a police officer, possession of an
illegal automatic weapon, and
possession of dynamite.
Sheriff's deputies had gone to
Mosher's house at the request of
his estranged wife, Elizabeth. She
was attempting to serve Mosher
with a legal paper involving a
dispute over the custody of their
5-year old son.
Sheriff's Sergeant E. L. Pronski
said that he and another officer
were dispatched to Mosher's home
shortly after 7 a m. He said that

Elizabeth Pronski had phoned
earlier asking that a deputy stand
by while they served the legal
papers.
The son was staying with
Mosher at the time, and Mrs.
Mosher said that she feared for
her safety.
When she and the officers
entered the house, Mosher
shouted for them to "get out,"
according to police.
Mosher ran from the 'officers
toward the basement, and from
the other room threatened their
lives.
A scuffle followed, and Mosher
was taken into custody. He was
taken to the San Mateo County
jail and booked.
In the home deputies found
seven sticks of dynamite, taped
together, two bags of black
explosive powder, a coil of red
blasting fuses, two battery-like
devices, and a quantity of nails.
In addition, the search turned
up a .223 caliber rifle modified to
make it fully automatic, a pistol, a
12 gauge shotgun, a .22 rifle, and
an M-l carbine.
