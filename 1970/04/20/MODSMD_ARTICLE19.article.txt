Prof. Linus Pauling, winner of
the Nobel Prize for both peace
and chemistry, has received an
international Lenin Peace Prize
"for his activity in defense of
peace," Tass new agency has
announced.
Pauling said he was informed of
his selection last Thursday. "I
thought it was fine that the
announcement came on the same
day the strategic arms limitation
talks (SALT) were beginning," he
said. "It gives us reason to hope
things will be better."
In a talk here Wednesday,
Pauling said the U.S. should
unilaterally abstain from further
arms buildup, including the
anti-ballastic missile. But he
added: "I do not advocate
unilateral disarmament by the
U.S."
