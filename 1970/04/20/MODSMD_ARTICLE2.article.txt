# Five-Year Probation
## Judge Exiles Rupert 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Paul Rupert—l 967 Stanford
graduate, an intern with the
United Campus Christian
Ministry, and a leader in the April
3rd Movement and Grass
Roots —has been given ten days to

leave Santa Clara County and stay
out for a period of up to five
years as part of his sentence for
refusing induction in 1968.
His full sentence, handed down
Friday by Ninth Federal District
Court Judge Stanley A. Weigel, a
1926 Stanford alumnus, was: five
years of probation, with the first
24 consecutive months to be
spent in "alternative service in the
national interest." After a period
of ten days, Rupert is to stay out
of Santa Clara County. Maximum
sentence could have been five
years in jail and $10,000 fine.
Rupert turned in his draft card
in October 1967 and refused
induction in March of 1968. He
anticipated an "alternative
service" sentence and sought a
position with the Campus
Ministry, which he now holds.
However, he must now look
elsewhere for "alternative
service," since he has been exiled
from Santa Clara County.
Considerable controversy has
arisen over the "unusual nature"
of the latter part of Rupert's
sentence. "1 have never heard of
this type of ruling in all the draft
cases that I know of," noted
Rupert.
Unusual Sentence
Judge Weigel, reached last night
by the Daily, agreed with Rupert
that his sentence was probably
somewhat unusual. However, the
Judge said that Rupert was
probably advising others at
Stanford to break the Selective
Service law. Judge Weigle felt it
might be in Stanford's interest to
remove Rupert from the
immediate community.
Pressure Charged
Reverend Joseph Hardegree, of
the Campus Ministry (UCCM), in

a column in today's Daily,
charged the University with
pressuring Judge Weigel to hand
down a heavier sentence than
Weigel was expected to do.
Provost Richard Lyman, speaking
with Rupert, denied that he
personally communicated with
the Judge, and stated that if
anyone else in the administration
had, he had no knowledge of it.
Judge Weigel declared to the
Daily that "no attempt, in any
way, or in any form, was made by
Stanford's administration to in
any way influence the court's
decision." If the University tried
to do this, he noted, "it would
have been disregarded."
.iardegree stated that Weigel
was known to be unhappy about
the selective service system and
has been "generally fair" in the
draft cases that have come before
his court.
Change of Hear I
However, at Friday's
sentencing, Judge Weigel was
"very gruff," according to both
Rupert and Hardegree, and made
comments about window
-breaking, rock-throwing, and
disrupting meetings of Boards of
Trustees—making reference to
anti-ROTC activities on campus.
Hardegree's Charge
In his column, Hardegree
pinpointed the administration's
"pressure" in the form of Provost
Richard Lyman's discussions with
the chairman of the UCCM Board,
Professor Richard Scott, on at
least three separate occasions
during the past month:
"The essence of Lyman's
message was: 1. The University
would be extremely unhappy if
Rupert was added to the UCCM
staff and thus made 'legitimate' as
a campus figure; 2. If UCCM

persisted in this matter it was
courting thie possibility of being
thrown off campus; 3. If Rupert
was added to the staff, UCCM was
not officially a part of the
University structure; and, 4. the
University might find it necessary
to direct its own communication
to the court."
Lyman's Reply
Provost Lyman stated last
night:
"At no point have I or anyone
acting at my instigation or with
my knowledge approached either
Jodge Weigel or the probation
officer on behalf of Stanford
University concerning the
question of Paul Rupert's - 1
sentencing, or any other aspect of
his case. To the best of my _
knowledge the only contact that
campus people have had with the
court has been through the UCCM
Board.
"It is true that I asked
Professor Richard Scott,
Chairman of the UCCM Board,
whether it would be made clear to
the court that UCCM, is
independent of Stanford
University and that its Board
members serve as individuals, not
as University representatives.
"Prof. Scott sent a letter to the
court requesting alternative
service for Rupert and making
clear the UCCM's relationship to
the University. Scott sent me a
copy of the letter, which I found
entirely satisfactory.
"For me to have approached
the court with a view of
influencing its sentence would
have been wrong on several
counts, not least of which is that
Rupert holds no appointment in
Stanford University, and the
proposed terms of his alternative

service here were not a subject for
University consideration or
decision."
Rupert believes it was possible
that some sort of pressure, from
some quarter, was put on Judge
Weigel for him to add that Rupert
was banned from Santa Clara
County. "The possibility exists
that he could have hardened his
attitude towards me through stuff
he got out of newspapers—but it's
pretty obvious that he had the
sense that I was involved in the
Off-ROTC thing.
"I really have no way of
knowing. But only a limited
number of people knew about the
time I would be sentenced, so it's
not likely someone called him up
the night before and made him
change his mind."
