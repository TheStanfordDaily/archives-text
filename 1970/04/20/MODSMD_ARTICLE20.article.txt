# Indians Are Still In It-Maybe
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
The players, the fans, and most
of the small boys had long since
left the premises late Saturday
afternoon when Tom Dunton,
Stanford's genial pitching coach,
yelled out to a passerby.
"Don't worry," came the
observation, "14-3 will do it."
The reply, filtering back
through clouds of wind-blown
dirt, was brief: "It had better."
The numerical allusions were
. to the won-lost mark which might
be needed for a first or
second-place finish in the
Southern Division of the Pac-8
baseball race. Dunton's projection
may well be correct, but if so,
both Stanford and UCLA are
going to have a helluva time
finishing first or second, a
prerequisite for making the league
playoffs in late May. Both teams
will have to win the remainder of
their games.
Like the Bruins, the Indians
dropped two out of three games
this past weekend, meaning that
USC and California lead the
division this morning. The
southern division standings:
W L GB
USC 3 1
Cal 3 1-
Stanford 13 2
UCLA 1 3 2
The local weekend began in
frustrating style for the Cards
when the UCLA contest Friday
stretched 12 innings before ending
as a 5-4 Bruin triumph. On
Saturday USC came to Sunken
Diamond after an equally long

win up at Berkeley and split with
the Tribe, winning the opener 3-0
but crumbling to Steve Dunning's
lastball in the nightcap, 2-1. And
in the war zone, UCLA
succumbed twice to Cal.
Pitchers. Kxcel
Friday's game here was a
sloppy contest at the start which
evolved into a stunning pitching
duel between Stanford's Bruce
Schoen and UCLA's Bill Bonham.
Schoen, the ro -ipient of the
starting assignment after Jim
Coate was hit hard on Tuesday
against UC Davis, and Bonham,
the Bruins' leading hurler, both
lasted until the final frame,
getting stronger as time went on.
Stanford moved ahead 2-1 in
the first but UCLA tied it in the
second. The Cards surged ahead
4-1 in the third when Glen
Johnson's double drove in one run
and produced another with the
help of a wild-throwing UCLA
defense. The speedy Johnson
scored as the Bruins hurled the
ball all around the lot.
A two-out homer by shortstop
Ralph Punaro closed the Bruins'
gap to 4-3 in the fifth, and a triple
by Danny Graham in the sixth
resulted in a run when Johnson
couldn't hold onto a bullet from
right fielder Phil Keller on a
sacrifice fly. Graham's bruising
slide jarred the horsehide lose, and
the Uclans had the equalizer. It
lasted for six more innings.
Schoen, strengthening, gave up
only two hits and a walk over the
next five stanzas while at the plate
the locals rallied, then fizzled in
both the ninth and eleventh. The
Bruin 12th opened happily
enough, with a leaping catch by
third baseman Dunning, but
UCLA's freshman first baseman
John Helfrick followed with a
single to left. Another out
brought pitcher Bonham to the
plate, and he crashed a 3-1 fastball
to the fence in left for a
run producing double.
To The Bench
Stanford coach Ray Young
went to his bench in an effort to
get something going in the bottom
half of the frame. Pinch-hitter
Don Schellenberg grounded out,
but Bob Wilhelm, hitting for the
exhausted Schoen, clobbered a
double to right. Curt Fant,
running for Wilhelm, advanced to
third on a Dave Edson single, so
Reichle excused Bonham in favor
of reliever Clary Robson.
There was a slight delay as
Robson groped his way to the
darkened mound, then threw one
pitch to Dick Borchers. On a
squeeze attempt, Borchers popped

up a high pitch to Robson, who
turned and fired to third to
double off Fant, and the game
was over.
Pitching was the name of this
one as the tired but happy
Bonham piled up 15 strikeouts en
route to his first win. Schoen,
meanwhile, uncorked 167 pitches
in his valiant but losing effort.
A sun-drenched gathering of
nearly 2,000 witnessed the
Saturday split as coach Rod
Dedeaux's Trojans lost their first
league contest and only their
eighth of 10 games. The visitor's
converted two singles, a passed
ball and an error, plus three Phil
Keller walks into a 3-0 first inning
lead and held on from there.
Dunning Does It
The nightcap was all Steve
Dunning, with some help from
catcher Johnson. Dunning turned
in another sensational pitching
performance, stopping the Trojan
horse in its tracks to the tune of
17 strikeouts and one walk. He
fanned the side in three different
innings, giving up only four hits to
the strongest college team in the
nation. His 121 strikeouts this
year lead all college pitchers.
On offense, the Cards ate away
at SC starter Greg Widman for
three frames before scoring once
on Johnson's double in the
fourth. Two innings later the
catcher, who's weak hitting thus
far this year had earned him the
ninth spot in the order, crashed a !
solo home run over centerfielder 1
Russ Bennett's fence-climbing
body to put the Tribe ahead 2-0.
