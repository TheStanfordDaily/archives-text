### HALL DAILY 
The Stanford tennis varsity
came closer to picking up two
upset wins over their arch-rivals
from the southland as USC edged
the Indians 5-4 and UCLA pulled
out a 6-3 margin of victory.
Last Friday before 400
enthusiastic fans, Coach Gould's
netmen nearly pulled off the three
doubles wins the Tribe needed to
overcome Troy's 4-2 lead after the
singles.
The first match of the day to
finish was sixth singles. Indian
captain and lone senior Rob
Rippner tore into SC's Fernando
Gentil 6-3, 6-2.
Next, Troy's sophomore
standout George Taylor
comfortably handled Rick Evans

6-1, 6-3 to capture third singles.
The match was much closer than
the score indicates as Rick battled
for every game before losing after
many deuces.
At fifth singles, Trojan Dick
Bornstedt defeated junior stalwart
Paul Marienthal 6-4, 6-2, to take a
2-1 lead.
Unheralded frosh star Gerry
Groslimond overcame tough Mike
Machette 6-2, 7-5 to tie up the
entire match 2-2. In the crucial
second set, Gerry lost an
advantage of 4-2 before coming
back to seal off any chance of
Trojan victory.
In second singles, SC veteran
Tom Leonard defeated Indian
freshman Rick Fisher 7-5, 6-4. In
a close second set, neither player

could break serve until Leonard
broke Rick's service at 3-3.
Leading 5-4 and 40-15, Leonard
missed a stinging overhead thus
giving Fisher another chance to
face a match point. After a fierce
rally, Rick lobbed wide to hand
SC their third singles victory.
Leonard's win gave the Trojans
a 3-2 advantage which they never
relinquished.
In the premier singles attraction
of the day, SC's Eric Van Dillen
outlasted Roscoe Tanner 6-3, 7-9,
6-4. In this battle between the
two top freshmen in the country,
Van Dillen pulled away in the
third to a 5-2 before Tanner
roared back within reach of
victory. However, Van Dillen
proved too powerful by forcing
two serious errors to win the
deciding third set.
In the doubles, Stanford's third
victory came from the Tribe's
frosh duo of Fisher and
Groslimond as they handled
Leonard and Machette 6-3, 3-6,
6-3.
In first doubles, Van Dillen and
Taylor beat Tanner and Rippner
6-4, 6-4. In third doubles, Evans
and Mac Claflin whipped
Bornstedt and Gentil 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Saturday before a sell-out
crowd, the UCLA Bruins managed
to hold on to win all three
doubles matches for a 6-3 team
victory.
In a tremendous wrin, Roscoe
Tanner defeated Haroon Rahim
7-9, 7-5, 16-14. In the second slot,
Jeff Borowiak beat Rick Fisher
8-6, 6-3. Modesto Vasquez then
put away Rick Evans 6-4, 6-3 to
garner the third singles point.
In the fourth position,
Groslimond won his third big
match of the weekend by crushing
Mike Kreiss 6-4, 6-2. Paul
Marienthal fell before Uclan
freshman Jeff Austin 6-2, 6-2 in
fifth singles. At the sixth spot,
Rob Rippner overcame Elio
Alvarez 10-9, 6-1.
With the match score tied 3-3,
UCLA forged into the lead for
good with excellent doubles play.
In number one doubles, Rahim
and Borowick edged Tanner and
Tippner 6-1, 2-6, 6-3. In second
doubles, Vasquez and Alvarez
decisioned Fisher and Groslimond
6-4, 3-6, 18-16. In the last doubles
match. Bob and Mike Kreiss
outpointed Evans and Claflin 4-6,
8-6, 6-4.
The Indians take their 10-4
record on the road against the San
Jose State Spartans on Monday.
