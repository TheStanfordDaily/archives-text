# No Surprise: Spikers Lose
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
With as much predictability as
the inevitable smog which
undoubtedly enveloped the LA
Coliseum before the day was over,
USC's track team destroyed
Stanford's finest Saturday 96-58.
Obviously vengeful after last
week's surprise tie with
Washington, the Trojans led by
Ron Pharris' double in the 100
(9.9) and 220 (21.5) took twelve
of eighteen first places. The
Trojan's thus extended their
mastery over the Indians to 35
straight dual meet victories.
There was little consolation for
the Indians who have not and may
not win a dual meet this season.
The Cards did manage to pick up
six firsts including all three
jumping events, the mile, two mile
and intermediate hurdles.
But as usual the Tribe got
destroyed in the sprints and relays
as USC swept the 100 and 220 ran
1-3 in the 44 0 and won both
relays.
Stanford's best efforts were a
best of life 4:05.6 mile by Duncan
Mac Donald and another lifetime
best of 23-10 in the long jump by
freshman Tom Anderson. But
disappointment again struck
freshman pole vaulter Casey
Carrigan, who has yet to match
the performances which sent him
to the Olympic's in 1968.
Saturday he cleared 14 feet and
then passed until 16 feet, where
he missed on all three attempts
and finished out of the money.
The Trojans won without any

points from their first rate hurdle
Herman Franklin who has been
bothered by injury problems. But
Edsel Garrison returned to the
USC lineup and won the 4-10 with
a fine 46.7.
Next Saturday the Indians
return home for their final home
meet against the Washington
Huskies. The Huskies who had a
minor scandal over use of an evil
weed by some traeksters earlier in
the season seem to have overcome
those problems.
Their tie with USC last week
was a big surprise but it was
accomplished with Franklin and
Garrison out of the USC lineup.
Of course Garrison accounted for
only five of the 38 point Trojan
margin Saturday, so you figure
out who'll be favored come
Saturday.

destroyed in the sprints and relays
as USC swept the 100 and 220 ran
1-3 in the 44 0 and won both
relays.
Stanford's best efforts were a
best of life 4:05.6 mile by Duncan
Mac Donald and another lifetime
best of 23-10 in the long jump by
freshman Tom Anderson. But
disappointment again struck
freshman pole vaulter Casey
Carrigan, who has yet to match
the performances which sent him
to the Olympic's in 1968.
Saturday he cleared 14 feet and
then passed until 16 feet, where
he missed on all three attempts
and finished out of the money.
The Trojans won without any

points from their first rate hurdle
Herman Franklin who has been
bothered by injury problems. But
Edsel Garrison returned to the
USC lineup and won the 4-10 with
a fine 46.7.
Next Saturday the Indians
return home for their final home
meet against the Washington
Huskies. The Huskies who had a
minor scandal over use of an evil
weed by some traeksters earlier in
the season seem to have overcome
those problems.
Their tie with USC last week
was a big surprise but it was
accomplished with Franklin and
Garrison out of the USC lineup.
Of course Garrison accounted for
only five of the 38 point Trojan
margin Saturday, so you figure
out who'll be favored come
Saturday.

FINAL SCORE USC 96 Stanford 58.
With as much predictability as
the inevitable smog which
undoubtedly enveloped the LA
Coliseum before the day was over,
USC's track team destroyed
Stanford's finest Saturday 96-58.
Obviously vengeful after last
week's surprise tie with
Washington, the Trojans led by
Ron Pharris' double in the 100
(9.9) and 220 (21.5) took twelve
of eighteen first places. The
Trojan's thus extended their
mastery over the Indians to 35
straight dual meet victories.
There was little consolation for
the Indians who have not and may
not win a dual meet this season.
The Cards did manage to pick up
six firsts including all three
jumping events, the mile, two mile
and intermediate hurdles.
But as usual the Tribe got
destroyed in the sprints and relays
as USC swept the 100 and 220 ran
1-3 in the 44 0 and won both
relays.
