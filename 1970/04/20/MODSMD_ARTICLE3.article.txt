# Rumors Of 'Bust' Denied By Lyman
## 
### 
Rumors that any anti-ROTC
demonstration—violent or
no n vi o 1 en t — wo u 1 d be
immediately "busted" by police
and handled through the court
system were denied yesterday by
University officials.
Provost Richard Lyman called
the rumors a "gross
oversimplification" of a meeting
held at the Dean of Students
office Friday afternoon.
According to Lyman and other
officials the meeting was called to
emphasize that a "peaceful" sit-in
like last Spring's at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory (AEL) is
disruptive and will fall under last
spring's injunction. He added that

the meeting had been called to
"draw the line between what is
permissible and what is not."
To anticipate any possible
circumstance the University finds
itself in would be "just
ridiculous", declared Dean of
Students Peter Bulkeley. He did
suggest, however, that the
administration was "terribly
concerncd about its present
state ... It is my feeling that a
sit-in is intrinsically disruptive."
"Anything that interferes with
routine activities in a strict
constructive sense is disruptive,"
he added.
Bill Leland maintained that the
meeting had been called to clarify
the seriousness of a sit-in like the
one at AEL last Spring. "A lot of
students think that a sit-in like
that is a joyous kind of picnic.
They are very romantic about it."
Although all of the officials
contacted declared that a sit-in
would be a serious violation of
last spring's injunction, none
would comment on the possibility
of police action. They were also
unclear on what is "permissible"
to the University and what is not.
When asked what would
happen if there were a sit-in in the
ROTC builidng, Lyman said that
the term "sit-in" was too vague.
Bulkeley simply stated "That's a
lovely question, I can't answer it."
However, he added that "It
would be a stupid lie if I didn't
tell you that we have been
speculating."
