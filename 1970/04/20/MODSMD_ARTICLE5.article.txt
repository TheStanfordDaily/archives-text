# Box Not There?
## No Ballots Collected At Frost 
### 
Reports that there was a polling
place for last week's election at
Wednesday's Moratorium
"Dawning of Peace" at Frost
amphitheater are evidently false.
Elections Commissioner Jan
Westfall had planned to place a
ballot box there until she learned
that there would be electioneering
at the Moratorium against
ROTC. Yesterday she said: "As
far as I know there was no ballot
box, and if there was one I don't
know where they got the ballots.
And they weren't counted
because I would have had to pick
them up in order for them to be
counted."
Member of the Council of
Presidents, Pat A. Shea,
erroneously told the faculty
Senate that there had been a
ballot box at Frost.
This Wednesday and Thursday
a runoff election is scheduled for
the offices of President of the
ASSU and Senior Class President.

Also scheduled are two referenda:
one urging the Administration to
reconsider its decision to cut back
the budget of the Speech and
Drama Department, and one
urging that Stanford vote its over
21,000 shares of General Motors
stock in favor Ralph Nader's
consumer-oriented proposals.
In the runoff election, the
presidential tickets are: Pat C.
Shea-Hal M i c kelson-Bob
Grant-Adam Levin and John
Shoch-Bill Evers. Those in the
runoff for Senior Class President
are: John Ford-Teresa Cady-Dave
Velasquez-John Elger and Taylor
Crosby-Margaret Earl-Phil
Feldman. Presidential candidates
argued over a possible debate
yesterday although the slates
could not agree on the form of
the debate.
The Shea ticket favors a debate
of any form on KZSU—but
without a live audience. Shoch
and Evers demand a public
debate.

According to Adam Levin, the
Shea tickets fears that an audience
might disrupt the debate—for one
candidate or the other. Shoch and
Evers think the public ought to
see the candidates in debate.
