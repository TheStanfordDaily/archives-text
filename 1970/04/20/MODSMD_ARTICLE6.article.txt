# Violence, Death Hit UCSB

### LARRY DIAMOND 
Santa Barbara was an ugly
lesson in contrasts this weekend.
The same beach where students
and visitors basked laxily in the
sun Friday served as a tenuous
refuge from terror that night. As a
few stranded souls, including this
reporter, stood bewildered on the
shore in the middle of the night,
shots rang out for what seemed an
eternity.
Clouds of tear gas rose above
the shallow skyline. Fires raged
throughout the once quiet college
community—in trash bins, in
buildings, in ancient cars as ten
truck loads of sheriff's deputies
rushed into the area.
When the flames and gas and
smoke had subsided early
Saturday morning, Kevin P.
Moran. a senior, lav dend Fridav

night he had come out of his Isla
Vista apartment to help put out
fires in the community. At 1 a.m.
in the morning, after having just
extinguished a fire inside the Bank
of America, Moran stood shoulder
to shoulder on the front porch of
the bank with eight others,
preventing some 50 radicals from

entering. At that moment the
fatal shot rang out, and Moral
slumped at the rail.
Other casualties included four
persons wounded by police
buckshot and birdshot. One coed
was hospitali/.ed under treatment
for 25 birdshot wounds in her
back.
Equally tragic and shaking were
the psychological ramifications of

Friday night's riots. Guns and
rocks and molotov cocktails and
tear gas exploding everywhere
capped by the death of a young
man, have taken a serious toll on
the campus community.
Any sense of calm and
normality that still remained in
Isla Vista was shattered Thursday
and Friday nights. Fear and
tension now run rampant. Police
patrol every block of the
community, and dozens of
Sheriffs, shotguns in hand,
maintain constant vigil outside the
Bank of America, guarding against
what is sure to be yet
another attempt ' < burn it down.

Saturday night, Isla Vista
resembled a ghost town, with only
the police and occasional news
reporters occupy inn the streets.
Many have tuned into the
campus radio station, attempting
to find the latest developments in
their community. Santa Barbara
Sheriff James Webster ordered the
campus radio station shut down
early Saturday morning, until the
curfew ended at 6 a.m. Saturday
night, only music was allowed to
be broadcast, and last night, news
was permitted, but no news about
the disturbances in Isla Vista.
The streets may be quiet now,
the fires and window smashing
may be halted by the massive
omnipresence of the police, but
the fear remains in Isla Vista. And
the horror remains as well: a
young man is dead.
