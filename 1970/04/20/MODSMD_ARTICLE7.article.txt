# CUS 'Unlikely' To Allow ROTC Credit
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
ROTC courses are unlikely to
receive much, if any, credit as
Undergraduate Specials, judging
from statements made by one
member of the subcommittee
involved in evaluating credit
proposals.
The Committee involved is the
Subcommittee on
Extra-departmental Courses and
Interschool Majors of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS). Specific ROTC
course petitions have not yet been
evaluated, but a negative view of
ROTC credit surfaced as the
subcommittee met in closed
sessions to set guidelines for all of
next year's Undergraduate
Specials.
The Daily has learned from the
committee that the controversial
"punitive clause" in ROTC
contracts is the likeliest basis for
refusing credit. Navy ROTC will
probably leave Stanford if the
decision is to refuse academic
credit for ROTC.
Physical Science Professor
Julien Ripley Jr., a subcommittee
member, said, "In general, the
punitive clause is not regarded as
being compatible with academic
procedures."
Punitive Clause
The punitive clause allows
immediate drafting of ROTC
cadets who quit the program
without "justifiable" reason. The
clause can be applied to students
on ROTC scholarships who quit
during the last two years of
college and to other cadets in
their last year.
The subcommittee believes the
punitive clause penalty for cadets
dropping ROTC courses is in
violation of one of its newly
passed requirements for credit:
"Assessment and prescribed
consequences of course
performance and completion
should be academically
appropriate."
Prof. Ripley conceded the
guideline was itself "passed with
that (the punitive clause) in
mind."
But he added that each ROTC
course submitted will be
considered individually, with
potential effects of the punitive
clause evaluated for each.

He said the subcommittee has
also agreed to judge each course
by additional standards, such as
whether there is a conflict
between the ROTC officer's role
as instructor and his employment
bv the military.
Navy ROTC will probably leave
Stanford if its courses are denied
Undergraduate Special credit
because of the punitive clause.
Col. Robert L. Thomas, director
of Navy ROTC, said he would
recommend ending the program
here if the courses were refused
"on a point that could not be
reconciled at any time in the
future."
He explained that the punitive
clause was such an irreconcilable
point because it is required by
federal law.
Air Force May Go
Col. Stanley Ramey, director of
Army ROTC, said he had "no
comment at this time" on Army
reaction if the punitive clause is
judged inappropriate. Army
ROTC is the only unit which the
Academic Council has thus far
authorized to apply for
Undergraduate Special credit. Air
Force ROTC is probably leaving
campus in any event, citing low
enrollment as the reason.
The seven-member
subcommittee on
Extra-departmental Courses and
Interschool Majors includes four
professors, two students, and a
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies staff.
The subcommittee's decision
on ROTC could be subject to
review by the CUS committee
which appointed it.
History Professor Mark
Mancall, CUS chairman,
emphasized that "CUS is
responsible for all actions of its
subcommittees," but he denied
the ROTC decision would be
taken away from the
subcommittee.
No Rubber Stamp
The subcommittee's attitude
confirmed Prof. Mancall's
statement that "we're not going
to just rubber stamp ROTC
courses."
But Mancall also insisted that
the decision is being made entirely
on an academic basis. He said,
"One's political views should not
play a role of any kind whatsoever
in the evaluation of any course
and in terms of our committee
will not play a role."
Prof. Ripley, a vocal anti-war
spokesman, was asked if the
subcommittee might be described
as approaching the ROTC courses
"skeptically. He answered,
"Carefully might be more
diplomatic."

course petitions have not yet been
evaluated, but a negative view of
ROTC credit surfaced as the
subcommittee met in closed
sessions to set guidelines for all of
next year's Undergraduate
Specials.
The Daily has learned from the
committee that the controversial
"punitive clause" in ROTC
contracts is the likeliest basis for
refusing credit. Navy ROTC will
probably leave Stanford if the
decision is to refuse academic
credit for ROTC.
Physical Science Professor
Julien Ripley Jr., a subcommittee
member, said, "In general, the
punitive clause is not regarded as
being compatible with academic
procedures."
Punitive Clause
The punitive clause allows
immediate drafting of ROTC
cadets who quit the program
without "justifiable" reason. The
clause can be applied to students
on ROTC scholarships who quit
during the last two years of
college and to other cadets in
their last year.
The subcommittee believes the
punitive clause penalty for cadets
dropping ROTC courses is in
violation of one of its newly
passed requirements for credit:
"Assessment and prescribed
consequences of course
performance and completion
should be academically
appropriate."
Prof. Ripley conceded the
guideline was itself "passed with
that (the punitive clause) in
mind."
But he added that each ROTC
course submitted will be
considered individually, with
potential effects of the punitive
clause evaluated for each.

He said the subcommittee has
also agreed to judge each course
by additional standards, such as
whether there is a conflict
between the ROTC officer's role
as instructor and his employment
bv the military.
Navy ROTC will probably leave
Stanford if its courses are denied
Undergraduate Special credit
because of the punitive clause.
Col. Robert L. Thomas, director
of Navy ROTC, said he would
recommend ending the program
here if the courses were refused
"on a point that could not be
reconciled at any time in the
future."
He explained that the punitive
clause was such an irreconcilable
point because it is required by
federal law.
Air Force May Go
Col. Stanley Ramey, director of
Army ROTC, said he had "no
comment at this time" on Army
reaction if the punitive clause is
judged inappropriate. Army
ROTC is the only unit which the
Academic Council has thus far
authorized to apply for
Undergraduate Special credit. Air
Force ROTC is probably leaving
campus in any event, citing low
enrollment as the reason.
The seven-member
subcommittee on
Extra-departmental Courses and
Interschool Majors includes four
professors, two students, and a
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies staff.
The subcommittee's decision
on ROTC could be subject to
review by the CUS committee
which appointed it.
History Professor Mark
Mancall, CUS chairman,
emphasized that "CUS is
responsible for all actions of its
subcommittees," but he denied
the ROTC decision would be
taken away from the
subcommittee.
No Rubber Stamp
The subcommittee's attitude
confirmed Prof. Mancall's
statement that "we're not going
to just rubber stamp ROTC
courses."
But Mancall also insisted that
the decision is being made entirely
on an academic basis. He said,
"One's political views should not
play a role of any kind whatsoever
in the evaluation of any course
and in terms of our committee
will not play a role."
Prof. Ripley, a vocal anti-war
spokesman, was asked if the
subcommittee might be described
as approaching the ROTC courses
"skeptically. He answered,
"Carefully might be more
diplomatic."
ROTC courses are unlikely to
receive much, if any, credit as
Undergraduate Specials, judging
from statements made by one
member of the subcommittee
involved in evaluating credit
proposals.
