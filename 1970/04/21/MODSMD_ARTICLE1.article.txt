# Higher Cost- Less Education?
## Study Questions Budget Cuts 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
A study by a Stanford
undergraduate questions the
priorities which determine
departmental reductions in the
proposed 1970-1971 University
budget.
The student, Christine Swent,
challenged the value judgements
made by the Administration in
making the budget cuts. "It seems
as though I will be paying 12
percent more in tuition next year,
but will receive a substantially
lower quality education," the
junior mathematics major
commented.
Miss Swent cited a letter mailed
during the Stanford University
Now (SUN) campaign which

stated that the average Stanford
student pays for only 37.5
percent of his education. "That
figure is extremely misleading,"
she said. "Students in 'bargain
basement' majors should realize
that they may pay not only for
their entire education, but also
partially finance students in
graduate departments."
Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Lawrence Ryan
acknowledged the apparent
disparity, but noted that the
condition is "almost endemic to
the University situation. Average
values are inherently misleading.
They should always be taken with
a grain of salt. Student can easily
inform themselves of the relative

costs of the various majors. Once
they choose a major, I really don't
see how they can justify their
complaints.
"What they do possibly have a
right to complain about is the size
of their classes," he continued,
"but even there, one should note
that there are excellent courses in
every department which have
small enrollments."
Dean Ryan conceded that
numerical findings of Swent "may
be correct in every respect," but
he challenged the concept of
basing priorities on the number of
students taking courses in a
particular department.
"You can't simply build a
faculty by counting who teaches
how many students," he stated."

To do so would be to risk the
deterioration of departments
essential to the academic life of
the University."
Dean Ryan said that the Speech
Department had quite frankly
been "taken apart." But he noted
that it was a non-major
department and that only one of
its teaching positions was
permanent. "To renew the
agreements with the other
members of the Speech teaching
stalf would have actually
amounted to a change of policy,"
he concluded.
The two most publicized
changes are the drastic reductions
in the Speech and Drama
Department, where the speech
faculty was trimmed to one

permanent position, and the
absorption of the Architecture
department into the School of
Engineering.
Miss Swent's study noted that
in the '69-'7O budget, the Asian
Languages department received a
16 percent increase while
encountering a 10 percent drop in
majors. Asian Languages was
granted a 1 0.6 percent increase in
the proposed '70-'7l budget,
double the average increases for
Humanities and Sciences. In the
*69 4 70 budget, these same
departments received an increase
of 1 2 percent.
Departments in the School of
Humanities and Sciences received
average increases of only 5.2
percent for 1970-71.

The Speech and Drama
department, which is supported
almost totally from the
University's general fund, received
a 2.5 percent increase in 1969-70.
While S&D served almost 6 times
as many student units, its total
budget was only one and one half
times larger than that of Asian
Languages. (One student taking
one course comprises one student
unit. Thus the average Stanford
student contributes four student
units per quarter.)
In the 4 70-'7l budget, the
Speech and Drama department
has been dealt a 1.1 percent cut in
funds, one of only three
departments in Humanities and
Sciences to see an actual decrease.
Of the other two, History was cut
by 8.8 percent, while
Architecture's funds were reduced
drastically, by 42.5 percent.
Not surprisingly, the School of
Medicine topped the list, with a
dollar cost student unit ratio of
1760. Second was the Asian
Languages department at 620.
The School of Earth Sciences
was third (471), a fact that is

especially significant since this
division was exempted from phase
one of the budget adjustment
program. The Administration
spared the school's funds on the
grounds that it "is a relatively
small operation, and . . . there are
no opportunities for immediate
reductions."
The lowest ratios were held by
French and Italian, Humanities,
Computed Science, Mathematics
(all 125), English (91), and
History (80).
In fiscal year 1968-69, Earth
Sciences received $687,100 from
unrestricted funds with 1894
student units enrolled in classes.
In Humanities and Sciences, only
J departments were allocated
funds in the $600,000 range -
chemistry with 3348 student
units, mathematics with 5937
student units, English with 8437
student units, and history with
8795 student units. In each of
these departments, faculty
appointments were reduced, the
most marked being in history, in
which 9 Western Civ instructors
were phased out.
