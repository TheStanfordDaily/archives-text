# Drug Survey
## MARC'S ON CAMPUS 
### Jeff Blum 
(First of two parts)
Caution: Drug Surveys may be hazardous to your freedom. This is
particularly true of the survey of dealers currently being conducted on
campus by Richard Blum (no relation of mine) and Jean Paul Smith
of thtf Institute for the Study of Human Problems.
Both Blum and Smith have impressive credentials in the area of
narcotics control. Smith, a recent addition to the faculty, comes to
Stanford from Washington D.C. where he was research director of the
Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (BDAC) until last year. Blum has been
at Stanford for a number of years, but has also been consulting for the
federal government 'egularly. Under President Johnson he was United
States delegate to the United Nations Narcotics Commission. Now he
serves on the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (FBNDD).
Need tor Research
Blum and Smith stress the need for research in determining federal
policies, and are themselves pioneers in the field of drug abuse
research. Blum claims to have been influential in setting up the
National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, the first
agency of the Justice Department to provide research funds for
narcotics control. He proudly states that John E. Ingersoll, director of
FBNDD, is one of his good friends and "a liberal cop in the Berkeley
tradition."
The present study of drug dealers on campus began three years ago
when Blum detailed his interests to Smith, and Smith, then research
director of BDAC, suggested his agency fund the project. Since then
Smith has come out to join Blum on the project and BDAC has been
placed inside the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
the agency which now employs all Federal Narcotics Agents, who are
affectionately called "narcs."
Blum and Smith, however, are quick to point out that they are not
narcs. They are researchers. Blum states he is working on this project
because it interests him and because "nobody knows anything about
drug dealers." Both men advocate policies of enlightened drug
control. Both claim that present laws and modes of enforcement have
not worked, that illicit drug use has increased steadily and that judges
having to throw most pot busts out of court because of the excessive
penalties attached to conviction has weakened the judicial system.

Exactly what policy Blum and Smith do advocate is as yet unclear.
Blum feels marijuana use should be a misdemeanor, but opposes
legalization on the grounds that widespread use of legal alcohol has
produced tremendous problems such as drunk driving. He is unsure
exactly how drug laws should be enforced and looks to his current
study to provide some of the answers. "I'll rest my own formulations
on wliat I find out."
It appears that one purpose of their study is to rationalize drug
control efforts, that is, to achieve maximum control with minimum
social disruption. Ultimately they would like to dry up supplies of
marijuana and other illegal drugs without alienating the younger
generation and without putting too many people in jail. But both men
know they are very far from achieving this goal and much needs to be
learned before they can even approach it.
The Questionnaire
How the present survey and interviews with dealers can help
control illegal drugs is quite apparent just from looking at the
questions on their printed three page questionaire:
Question 2. How much do you use each of these drugs? (marijuana,
LSD, speed, other)
Question 3. How much do you sell drugs (marijuana, LSD, speed,
other) Do you sell to students outside this unit (residence)?
Question 5. What %of sales have been within this unit and what
% outside of it?
Question 7. How do you supply yourself? Do you go together with
other dealers to make purchases? Do you change suppliers to keep
stocked?
Question 8. If your supplier is on campus is he an undergraduate,
graduate, faculty, staff? If off campus, what is his age, race, city?
Question 9. Do you have any Mafia connections?
Narcs and the Survey
These questions seek to discover patterns of supply and
distribution. Knowing these could help determine where best to
deploy agents and what kind of agents to deploy in order to achieve
maximum interference with illegal drug trade by each federal officer.
Questions 1 0 and 1 1 consider the amount of dealing and the effect of
present law enforcement on campus. They could be used to determine
whether more infiltration of campus residences is needed or whether
the problem is better handled from the outside by trying to stop the
drug traffic before it reaches the campus. Question 10. How many
dealers do you think there are on campus? Do you feel safe from
arrests selling drugs on campus (as opposed in a city)? Explain.
Question 11. Have you ever been arrested for drug use or sales? for
anything else? any close calls?
(In tomorrow's Daily there will be a further explanation of the drug
study.)

at Stanford for a number of years, but has also been consulting for the
federal government 'egularly. Under President Johnson he was United
States delegate to the United Nations Narcotics Commission. Now he
serves on the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (FBNDD).
Need tor Research
Blum and Smith stress the need for research in determining federal
policies, and are themselves pioneers in the field of drug abuse
research. Blum claims to have been influential in setting up the
National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, the first
agency of the Justice Department to provide research funds for
narcotics control. He proudly states that John E. Ingersoll, director of
FBNDD, is one of his good friends and "a liberal cop in the Berkeley
tradition."
The present study of drug dealers on campus began three years ago
when Blum detailed his interests to Smith, and Smith, then research
director of BDAC, suggested his agency fund the project. Since then
Smith has come out to join Blum on the project and BDAC has been
placed inside the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
the agency which now employs all Federal Narcotics Agents, who are
affectionately called "narcs."
Blum and Smith, however, are quick to point out that they are not
narcs. They are researchers. Blum states he is working on this project
because it interests him and because "nobody knows anything about
drug dealers." Both men advocate policies of enlightened drug
control. Both claim that present laws and modes of enforcement have
not worked, that illicit drug use has increased steadily and that judges
having to throw most pot busts out of court because of the excessive
penalties attached to conviction has weakened the judicial system.

Exactly what policy Blum and Smith do advocate is as yet unclear.
Blum feels marijuana use should be a misdemeanor, but opposes
legalization on the grounds that widespread use of legal alcohol has
produced tremendous problems such as drunk driving. He is unsure
exactly how drug laws should be enforced and looks to his current
study to provide some of the answers. "I'll rest my own formulations
on wliat I find out."
It appears that one purpose of their study is to rationalize drug
control efforts, that is, to achieve maximum control with minimum
social disruption. Ultimately they would like to dry up supplies of
marijuana and other illegal drugs without alienating the younger
generation and without putting too many people in jail. But both men
know they are very far from achieving this goal and much needs to be
learned before they can even approach it.
The Questionnaire
How the present survey and interviews with dealers can help
control illegal drugs is quite apparent just from looking at the
questions on their printed three page questionaire:
Question 2. How much do you use each of these drugs? (marijuana,
LSD, speed, other)
Question 3. How much do you sell drugs (marijuana, LSD, speed,
other) Do you sell to students outside this unit (residence)?
Question 5. What %of sales have been within this unit and what
% outside of it?
Question 7. How do you supply yourself? Do you go together with
other dealers to make purchases? Do you change suppliers to keep
stocked?
Question 8. If your supplier is on campus is he an undergraduate,
graduate, faculty, staff? If off campus, what is his age, race, city?
Question 9. Do you have any Mafia connections?
Narcs and the Survey
These questions seek to discover patterns of supply and
distribution. Knowing these could help determine where best to
deploy agents and what kind of agents to deploy in order to achieve
maximum interference with illegal drug trade by each federal officer.
Questions 1 0 and 1 1 consider the amount of dealing and the effect of
present law enforcement on campus. They could be used to determine
whether more infiltration of campus residences is needed or whether
the problem is better handled from the outside by trying to stop the
drug traffic before it reaches the campus. Question 10. How many
dealers do you think there are on campus? Do you feel safe from
arrests selling drugs on campus (as opposed in a city)? Explain.
Question 11. Have you ever been arrested for drug use or sales? for
anything else? any close calls?
(In tomorrow's Daily there will be a further explanation of the drug
study.)
(First of two parts)
Caution: Drug Surveys may be hazardous to your freedom. This is
particularly true of the survey of dealers currently being conducted on
campus by Richard Blum (no relation of mine) and Jean Paul Smith
of thtf Institute for the Study of Human Problems.
Both Blum and Smith have impressive credentials in the area of
narcotics control. Smith, a recent addition to the faculty, comes to
Stanford from Washington D.C. where he was research director of the
Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (BDAC) until last year. Blum has been
