# Health Menace
## Fiberglas Polution 
### Katherine Barkley 
At 12:00 tomorrow, two
masked workers from
Owe ns - Corning Fiberglas
Corporation will be speaking at
White Plaza. They are coming to
talk about the pollution that they
breathe daily in their plant. They
risk losing their jobs if the
company discovers their identity.
At 2:15, busses and cars will
leave the Tresidder lot to go over
to the factory in Santa Clara to
put some pressure behind the
workers needs for better in-plant
pollution control and flagrantly
neglected medical attention.
The Owens-Corning
demonstration is part of the
education planned by the teach-in
organizers at Stanford. Since
winter quarter, Senator Gaylord
Nelson and ASSU's own Dennis
Hayes have been priming the
nation for the Earth Day teach-in.
Tomorrow is the anxiously
awaited day. Politicians and
college administrators have been
hoping that it will serve to
"replace Vietnam as the major
issue with students" and motivate
us to bridge the generation gap in
a move for piecemeal reform.
The teach-in was designed to
bring spring activism off the
streets and back into the ivory
cells. However, no longer be
sucked into believing that
academic rhetoric affects change,
the Stanford April 22nd teach-in
is going to act. We are going to
start by putting real pressure for
change on the Owens-Corning
Fiberglas Corporation.
A Natural Target
Owens-Corning is a natural
target for an anti-pollution attack.
As a defense contractor, it's
helping the Pentagon insure
ecological disaster in Vietnam and
the rest of Southeast Asia. It is
one of the ten largest polluters in
the Bay Area, and the one most
complained about in Santa Clara
County. Most tragic of all, there's
reason to believe that
Owens-Corning is poisoning its
workers.
The plant in Santa Clara spits
up tons of fiberglas particles into
the air. Inside the factory,
pollution is much worse. The
ventilation isn't even minimally
adequate to dispel) the cloud-like
concentrate of particles of glass,
sulfates, borates, and resins.
Besides causing obvious skin and

eye irritation, the smaller particles
become imbedded in the lungs. If
you think nicotine is bad for your
general health, try inhaling
fiberglas particles for 40 hours a
week.
Although so far little research
has been done, doctors and public
health officials refuse to agree
with the industry that working
with fiberglas is safe. (The
management claims that certain
compounds may, in fact, be
"therapeutic"). However, it's very
possible that cancer and
emphysema-like illnesses may
result.
Eli (est Smog
As we sit on our elite
university, bemoaning the smog
on the horizon and talking about
"ecology," working people who
have suffered from serious
pollution for decades still go
unnoticed. These people are
asking for our help. They're trying
to formulate demands for better
ventilation and trapping, for
research on many of the probable
but still unknown health effects
of constant exposure to the
particles, and for check-ups and
compensation for any ill-effects
from working with fiberglas.
The Stanford teach-in doesn't
want to be part of the "ecology
for the rich" movement. We are
teaching-in because every man has
a right to pollution-free food, air,
water, and land. We must learn to
come together to protect these
rights. We must support the
Owens-Corning workers who for
decades have systematically been
denied that right by power and
wealth which goes unchallenged.
Tomorrow we will begin that
challenge. Join us at 2:15.

Owens-Corning is a natural
target for an anti-pollution attack.
As a defense contractor, it's
helping the Pentagon insure
ecological disaster in Vietnam and
the rest of Southeast Asia. It is
one of the ten largest polluters in
the Bay Area, and the one most
complained about in Santa Clara
County. Most tragic of all, there's
reason to believe that
Owens-Corning is poisoning its
workers.
The plant in Santa Clara spits
up tons of fiberglas particles into
the air. Inside the factory,
pollution is much worse. The
ventilation isn't even minimally
adequate to dispel) the cloud-like
concentrate of particles of glass,
sulfates, borates, and resins.
Besides causing obvious skin and

eye irritation, the smaller particles
become imbedded in the lungs. If
you think nicotine is bad for your
general health, try inhaling
fiberglas particles for 40 hours a
week.
Although so far little research
has been done, doctors and public
health officials refuse to agree
with the industry that working
with fiberglas is safe. (The
management claims that certain
compounds may, in fact, be
"therapeutic"). However, it's very
possible that cancer and
emphysema-like illnesses may
result.
Eli (est Smog
As we sit on our elite
university, bemoaning the smog
on the horizon and talking about
"ecology," working people who
have suffered from serious
pollution for decades still go
unnoticed. These people are
asking for our help. They're trying
to formulate demands for better
ventilation and trapping, for
research on many of the probable
but still unknown health effects
of constant exposure to the
particles, and for check-ups and
compensation for any ill-effects
from working with fiberglas.
The Stanford teach-in doesn't
want to be part of the "ecology
for the rich" movement. We are
teaching-in because every man has
a right to pollution-free food, air,
water, and land. We must learn to
come together to protect these
rights. We must support the
Owens-Corning workers who for
decades have systematically been
denied that right by power and
wealth which goes unchallenged.
Tomorrow we will begin that
challenge. Join us at 2:15.
(Katherine Barkley is Chairman
of the Action Committee of the
Environmental Teach-in.)
At 12:00 tomorrow, two
masked workers from
Owe ns - Corning Fiberglas
Corporation will be speaking at
White Plaza. They are coming to
talk about the pollution that they
breathe daily in their plant. They
risk losing their jobs if the
company discovers their identity.
At 2:15, busses and cars will
leave the Tresidder lot to go over
to the factory in Santa Clara to
put some pressure behind the
workers needs for better in-plant
pollution control and flagrantly
neglected medical attention.
The Owens-Corning
demonstration is part of the
education planned by the teach-in
organizers at Stanford. Since
winter quarter, Senator Gaylord
Nelson and ASSU's own Dennis
Hayes have been priming the
nation for the Earth Day teach-in.
Tomorrow is the anxiously
awaited day. Politicians and
college administrators have been
hoping that it will serve to
"replace Vietnam as the major
issue with students" and motivate
us to bridge the generation gap in
a move for piecemeal reform.
The teach-in was designed to
bring spring activism off the
streets and back into the ivory
cells. However, no longer be
sucked into believing that
academic rhetoric affects change,
the Stanford April 22nd teach-in
is going to act. We are going to
start by putting real pressure for
change on the Owens-Corning
Fiberglas Corporation.
