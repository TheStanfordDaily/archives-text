# Dean James Gibbs Promises New Concern For Innovation
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
As Stanford's first Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, James
Gibbs, isn't quite sure what the
job involves, but he has plenty of
things he wants to do.
The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), which suggested
the position be created, said the
Dean should "serve as the
academic advocate for the general
interests of undergraduates in the
University."
Gibbs does not interpret this to
mean he should be "a
cheerleader" for undergraduates,
but rather he should see "that
undergraduate interests aren't
overlooked."
The 38-year-old Gibbs, an
associate professor of
anthropology, sees two aspects to
the post he will assume next fall:
"innovating and coordinating."
A major focus of the job, he
says, will be on innovating new
courses and programs for
undergraduates. In addition, "a
good deal of coordinating" of
undergraduate education "outside
the lecture hall" will be done.
He notes many of these outside
activities are handled through
various offices and that by
coordinating the programs their
"educational focus" can be
emphasized.
Presently on leave at the Center
for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, Gibbs admits
the first thing to be done is to
"find out what's been going on
lately." But, appointed only last
week, he is already working on
major problem-advising.
Team Advising
"Advising is a faculty job; it is a

proper and good thing to do." His
views on new advising methods
center around a "team" concept,
in which faculty members living in
dorms would gather teams of
other faculty members to help in
advising, especially in the
student's first year.
By centering the advising more
in the residences, Gibbs hopes to
establish better ties between
students and faculty. "The idea
is," he explains, "if students and
professors have real intellectual
links, other links will grow out"
and form a good community.
Gibbs reports that an advising
center will be established in the
Old Union starting next fall,
offering help on courses, graduate
schools, careers, etc. He hopes it
can develop ''deeper
student-faculty relations" by
orienting itself "around bigger
issues."
Another area of immediate
concern, he adds, is the creation
of new courses and programs that
combine traditional training with
research and/or social action.
He says the "rigor of academic
training" should be combined
"with something that turns both
the professor and the student on."
Gibbs also hopes more
undergraduates can be involved in
professors research as a way of
improving both academic and
personal relations.
He cites, as support for the
idea, the "enthusiasm" that
undergraduates can bring to*
research that is related both to
social action and academic work.
Work-study programs, he says, are
another "educational option."
Overseas Campus Ideas
Gibbs claims the present
Overseas Campus program is
"ethnocentric" in that it it based
only in European countries, and
that "systematic experiences" in
Africa, Asia and Latin America
could add an extra dimension to
the program.
He also hopes for new ideas in
traditional courses and programs
through a "freer excfia/ige of
information" on what people are
doing on campus.
"Most students find education
stimulating and challenging there
is a need to get more people
talking about these things. More
discussion would make us realize
there is quite a bit of intellectual
excitement not being discussed."
Although full of ideas for the
future, Gibbs is not unresponsive
to the problems of the present.

Students today, he claims, see
their courses "as unrelated to
their deepest concerns." In
addition, there is a tendency by
the faculty to concentrate on
research and graduate education
and "see undergraduate teaching
as something separate."
Gibbs says a crisis has
developed in today's
undergraduate education, noting
this generation feels education " is
not preparing them to do
something that matters with their
lives." There is also a feeling of
alienation and neglect, he says.
In trying to cope with these
problems, Gibbs sees the
implementation of the SES
recommendations as a major
function of his office. Its "whole
nature," he says, "is to provide a
visible place in the university
where the innovations started by
SES can continue."
But, as everywhere else,
funding is a problem. "A lot of
innovative ideas" need to be
started now, he says, but financial
resources create a problem in
"achieving educational and
socially relevent goals."
He hopes his offke will be able
to free professors from"the
busywork of teaching" to have
more time to plan the new
programs. In addition, he wants to
"find a way to make
undergraduate teaching more
rewarding."
"There are people doing things
in the classroom that aren't
recognized," he says, adding that
he feels his office "can encourage
acknowledgment of significant
teaching."
Gibbs himself has received a
distinguished teacher award from
the University of Minnesota and
recently won the $4,000 E. Harris
Harbison prize for gifted teaching
from the Danforth Foundation.
He was drawn to the job of
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
"by the opportunity to do
something that may matter in
changing our corner of the
world." He adds, however, that a
job requires "a joint effort,"
including students.
"Students have to put in a
sustained effort" to help in
innovations. "We've all got to
hang together and cooperate all
the way."
"The spirit of SES"' he says,
"means that life will continually
be different at Stanford."
