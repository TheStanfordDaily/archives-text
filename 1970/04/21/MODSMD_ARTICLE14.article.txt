# Gestalt Fool Theater
## 
### 
Last year Paul Rebillot
produced Cuchullin, a cycle of
plays by W.B. Yeats and now he is
back with The Gestalt Fool
Theater and their two plays,
Thingie and Sandwich. Cuchulin
was six hours of drama and a
monumental experience of theater
at its best. Thingie and Sandwich
don't take as much time, but as
improvisational theater they are
just as impressive.
Sandwich is a fast moving
experience of neo-dada vaudeville.
Scenes are stolen from John
Lennon In His Own Write and
mixed with contemporary ballads
and poetic interludes to produce a
vicious and yet pathetically
humerous picture of man and

woman.
Thingie shows a good deal
more polish than Sandwich. Six
actors and two T.V. sets do
produce more complex images
than a man and a woman on a
bare stage.
The images produced are of
America and materialism. They
aren't flattering; but that isn't
surprising. They aren't trite and
that is truly amazing. Somehow
the play is simple in the end, and
that is the most pleasing part
about Thingie.
There will be one more
performance of Thingie and
Sandwich tonight in the Nitery at
8:00. Admission is $2.00 or
whatever.
