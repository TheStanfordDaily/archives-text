# Church Warns USA

### KARL GEORGI 
"You can't be President of the
United States without it going to
your head", asserted Senator
Frank Church (Dcm.-Idaho) last
Friday as he warned that the
Presidents of the United States are
usurping power from the Senate
in the manner of Roman Caesars.
The Senator's remarks were
contained in a paper he read to
some 300 persons in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium observing the Fiftieth
Anniversary of Stanford's Political
Science Department.
Before clarifying his warning,
Church presented Professor
Thomas S. Barclay (Emeritus)
with a document expressing the
gratitude of four of Barclay's
former students: Senators Alan
Cranston (Dem.-Calif.), Mark
Hattfield (Rep.-Ore.), Lee Letcalf
(Dem.-Mont ), and Church.
Adding that "at the knees of
Professor Barclay I learned that
government was power", he
thanked the Professor on behalf
of his colleagues in the U.S.
Senate.
Entitled, "Of Caesars and
Presidents", Church's paper
condemned past and present
Administrations for taking into
their own hands powers which
rightfully belonged in the
legislature, specifically the
authority to make treaties and the
"power of the purse".
Recalling that the Roman
Emperors extracted their strength
from the citizens represented in
the Senate, Church stated the
same process is occurring in the
United States. As it was in Rome,
the President employees war or
the threat of war as the excuse for
assuming some Congressional
duties.
Relying on old Stanford
Poly-Sci texts, the Senator cited
Alexis de Tocqueville's
observation that "protracted
warfare leads to despotism" and

proceeded to historically
document his argument.
President Franklin Roosevelt
was the first major transgressor.
F.D.R. committed the U.S. to
several actions without consulting
Congress before and during the
war, the most glaring being the
"Destroyer Deal" with Great
Britain in 1940.
Church noted that the amount
of funds approved by Congress
and holed up in the White House
is staggering. This fact, along with
the direct and indirect pressure to
approve White House budget
items, clearly supports the charge
that the Executive Branch is
grabbing for power.
The Senator concluded a
stricter adherence to the letter
and the intent of the Constitution
is needed. The rejections of
Clement Haynsworth and G.
Harrold Carswell are hopeful signs
that the Senate is reasserting its
Constitutional power.


JAMES GIBBS, new dean of Undergraduate Studies, will work to stimulate
student involvement in academic innovation.

Recalling that the Roman
Emperors extracted their strength
from the citizens represented in
the Senate, Church stated the
same process is occurring in the
United States. As it was in Rome,
the President employees war or
the threat of war as the excuse for
assuming some Congressional
duties.
Relying on old Stanford
Poly-Sci texts, the Senator cited
Alexis de Tocqueville's
observation that "protracted
warfare leads to despotism" and

proceeded to historically
document his argument.
President Franklin Roosevelt
was the first major transgressor.
F.D.R. committed the U.S. to
several actions without consulting
Congress before and during the
war, the most glaring being the
"Destroyer Deal" with Great
Britain in 1940.
Church noted that the amount
of funds approved by Congress
and holed up in the White House
is staggering. This fact, along with
the direct and indirect pressure to
approve White House budget
items, clearly supports the charge
that the Executive Branch is
grabbing for power.
The Senator concluded a
stricter adherence to the letter

"You can't be President of the
United States without it going to
your head", asserted Senator
Frank Church (Dcm.-Idaho) last
Friday as he warned that the
Presidents of the United States are
usurping power from the Senate
in the manner of Roman Caesars.
The Senator's remarks were
contained in a paper he read to
some 300 persons in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium observing the Fiftieth
Anniversary of Stanford's Political
Science Department.
Before clarifying his warning,
Church presented Professor
Thomas S. Barclay (Emeritus)
with a document expressing the
gratitude of four of Barclay's
former students: Senators Alan
Cranston (Dem.-Calif.), Mark
Hattfield (Rep.-Ore.), Lee Letcalf
(Dem.-Mont ), and Church.
Adding that "at the knees of
Professor Barclay I learned that
government was power", he
thanked the Professor on behalf
of his colleagues in the U.S.
Senate.
Entitled, "Of Caesars and
Presidents", Church's paper
condemned past and present
Administrations for taking into
their own hands powers which
rightfully belonged in the
legislature, specifically the
authority to make treaties and the
"power of the purse".
