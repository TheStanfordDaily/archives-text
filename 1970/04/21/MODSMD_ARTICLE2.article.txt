# Candidates May Debate This Afternoon In TMU
## 
### JOHN SLOAN 
The second round of the ASSU
elections will be held Wednesday
and Thursday. Included will be
the run-offs for the ASSU
Presidency, senior class officers,
and the funding for next year's
ASSU prlgrams.
These run-offs became
necessary when a majority vote
was not forthcoming in last
week's elections.

Also on the ballot will be two
referenda concerning the General
Motors proxy vote and the future
of the Speech and Drama
Department.
The ASSU Presidential election
will pit the team of John Shoch
and Bill Evers against Patrick C.
Shea, Robert Grant, A 1 Michelson
and Adam Levin.
Debate
Shoch and Evers have

challenged the Shea slated to hold
a debate this afternoon in 274
Tresidder Union at 4:15. KZSU
plans to carry the debate live.
In a statement last night, the
Shea ticket said: "Shea, Grant,
Mickelson and Levin have offered
repeatedly to debate their
opponents at any time on KZSU.
Shoch and Evers have refused this
offer because they desire a debate
but a dramatic incident, a
spectacle, to publicize their
campaign.
"We believe that KZSU is the
best forum for a true debate
which will compare our positions
and our differences for all who are
interested to hear. If Shoch and
Evers truly want a debate, we will
meet them at KZSU at any time
they choose, live or taped,
prepared questions or ab lib. We
doubt that they will accept this
offer now when they have refused
it for the last three days."
Shoch and Evers replied, "We'll
be more than happy to come and
appear on KZGU if all four
members of the other slate come
to Tresidder at 4:15 and explain
to that audience why they won't
speak to them."
KZSU reported late last night
that it will carry a speech by the
Shea ticket between 8:30 and 9
p.m. tonight, and has offered
equal time to the Shoch ticket.
ASSU Run-off
The senior class officers'
run-off will be between Taylor
Crosby, Margaret Earl, Phillip
Feldman and John Ford, Dave
Velasquez and Teresa Cady.
The ASSU program fee will be
decided between an amount of $1
and $3. One half of the
assessment will go to divisional
student organizations will the
other half be allocated to the
student organizations of the
ASSU senate.
The first of the new referenda
concerns student support for a
move to have Stanford's GM
stock voted in favor of motions to
set lip a committee for corporate
responsibility and to expand the
GM Board of Directors to include
three members selected to insure
corporate responsibility. The
move would support RalphNader's
proposals.
The second of the referenda
asks the administration to
reconsider its pending decision to
severely cut back the Speech and
Drama Department.
Polling places for the two-day
election will be in the same
locations and times as last week's
elections. Tables will be located at
the Post Office, Engineering
Corner and Physics Tank from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m.; at the
Computation Center from 1 1 a.m.
to 2 p.m.; at the Medical School
Lounge from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.;
and at the Business and Law
School Lounges from It a.m. to 4
p.m.


ULTIMATUM—Provost Richard Lyman debates with anti-ROTC protestors in
the lobby of the President's office. He is holding a copy at an ultimatum the
demonstrators gave to the administration.

but a dramatic incident, a
spectacle, to publicize their
campaign.
"We believe that KZSU is the
best forum for a true debate
which will compare our positions
and our differences for all who are
interested to hear. If Shoch and
Evers truly want a debate, we will
meet them at KZSU at any time
they choose, live or taped,
prepared questions or ab lib. We
doubt that they will accept this
offer now when they have refused
it for the last three days."
Shoch and Evers replied, "We'll
be more than happy to come and
appear on KZGU if all four
members of the other slate come
to Tresidder at 4:15 and explain
to that audience why they won't
speak to them."
KZSU reported late last night
that it will carry a speech by the
Shea ticket between 8:30 and 9
p.m. tonight, and has offered
equal time to the Shoch ticket.

Debate
Shoch and Evers have

plans to carry the debate live.
In a statement last night, the
Shea ticket said: "Shea, Grant,
Mickelson and Levin have offered
repeatedly to debate their
opponents at any time on KZSU.
Shoch and Evers have refused this
offer because they desire a debate
but a dramatic incident, a
spectacle, to publicize their
campaign.
"We believe that KZSU is the
