# 'Earth Day' Fair Slated Wednesday
## 
### 
Earth Day at Stanford on
Wednesday will feature an
Environmental Fair in White
Plaza, discussions, a box dinner
and films designed to inform the
public about various faces of the
environmental crisis.
"Stanford has a hell of a lot of
people who aren't aware of the
depth of the environmental
problem and the radical nature of
the solutions that are required,"
stated Steve Fortmann,
spokesman for the Stanford End
Day (Environment Near Death)
Committee which has organized
the activities for April 22.
"We hope to stimulate
awareness that these problems are
not simple and are not just
technological, but a matter of our
whole philosophy and life-style.
We can not go on living like we
are living, consuming like we are
consuming, and breeding like we
are breeding. It is a question of
ethics, of societal values. Attitude
change is what we are after
through the teach in," he said.
Wednesday's teach in will be a
forum for different points of view
about the nature of the solutions
required if man is to continue
living on this planet, according to
Earth Day coordinator Chuck
Dunbar. Members of the faculty
have been asked to devote their
Wednesday classes to discussions
of man and his relation to the
earth.
Focus of Earth Day will be an
Environmental Fair on White

Plaza from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.,
which will bring together various
conservation and population
groups to provide fairgoers with
information. "Things You Can
Do" will be the theme of one
booth.
Sixteen environmental films on
various subjects will be shown
starting at noon in the UGLY
Forum Room and at 2:30 p.m. in
Cubberly.
Homemade bread and honey is
the menu for dinner at 5 p.m. The
community is invited to bring a
box dinner and to hear Eddie
Albert speaking on the subject of
conservation.
More than 100 Stanford
students and faculty have been
working since January to organize
Wednesday's program and to
coordinate the efforts of other
organizations participating in
Earth Day. 400 people turned out
Saturday to canvass the
surrounding communities,
distributing 15,000 copies of the
Cross Currents environmental
issue as well as bumper stickers
and buttons. More canvassing is
scheduled for today along with a
film program at 7 p.m. in Bishop
Auditorium and the UGLY
Forum Room.
"Earth Week" will continue on
Saturday with workshops on land
use, air pollution, technology, and
ecology and the War. The
workshops will feature panel
discussions with experts from
government, the University and
business.

public about various faces of the
environmental crisis.
"Stanford has a hell of a lot of
people who aren't aware of the
depth of the environmental
problem and the radical nature of
the solutions that are required,"
stated Steve Fortmann,
spokesman for the Stanford End
Day (Environment Near Death)
Committee which has organized
the activities for April 22.
"We hope to stimulate
awareness that these problems are
not simple and are not just
technological, but a matter of our
whole philosophy and life-style.
We can not go on living like we
are living, consuming like we are
consuming, and breeding like we
are breeding. It is a question of
ethics, of societal values. Attitude
change is what we are after
through the teach in," he said.
Wednesday's teach in will be a
forum for different points of view
about the nature of the solutions
required if man is to continue
living on this planet, according to
Earth Day coordinator Chuck
Dunbar. Members of the faculty
have been asked to devote their
Wednesday classes to discussions
of man and his relation to the
earth.
Focus of Earth Day will be an
Environmental Fair on White

Plaza from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.,
which will bring together various
conservation and population
groups to provide fairgoers with
information. "Things You Can
Do" will be the theme of one
booth.
Sixteen environmental films on
various subjects will be shown
starting at noon in the UGLY
Forum Room and at 2:30 p.m. in
Cubberly.
Homemade bread and honey is
the menu for dinner at 5 p.m. The
community is invited to bring a
box dinner and to hear Eddie
Albert speaking on the subject of
conservation.
More than 100 Stanford
students and faculty have been
working since January to organize
Wednesday's program and to
coordinate the efforts of other
organizations participating in
Earth Day. 400 people turned out
Saturday to canvass the
surrounding communities,
distributing 15,000 copies of the
Cross Currents environmental
issue as well as bumper stickers
and buttons. More canvassing is
scheduled for today along with a
film program at 7 p.m. in Bishop
Auditorium and the UGLY
Forum Room.
"Earth Week" will continue on
Saturday with workshops on land
use, air pollution, technology, and
ecology and the War. The
workshops will feature panel
discussions with experts from
government, the University and
business.
