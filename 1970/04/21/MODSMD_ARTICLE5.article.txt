# Lyman Condemns 'Coercive Tactics'
## 
### 
In an hour-long "rational
dialogue" with about 40
anti-ROTC demonstrators in the
lobby of the President's office,
Provost Richard Lyman said
yesterday that the University is
"not trying to repress student
dissent" in its handling of ROTC
protests but is "determined to
keep from having coercive tactics
used to change decisions."
Lyman said later that the
University has "no intention" of
granting amnesty to individuals
who have been charged with
disruptive acts in demonstrations
over the last few weeks.
The debate followed a brief
noon rally at White Plaza by the
demonstrators at which they read
an ultimatum to the University. It
demands that the University:
eliminate ROTC from the campus
immediately; grant amnesty to all
persons arrested for anti-ROTC
activities; reverse its alleged
pressure on a federal judge who
sentenced Paul Rupert for draft
evasion; and that it meet these
demands by noon Thursday.
The group has threatened a
Thursday sit-in if these demands
are not met.
After the rally, the group
marched to the President's office
pestering along the way a
Stanford student manning a
Marine Corps recruiting table. The
demonstrators presented Lyman
with the ultimatum in President
Pitzer's absence. Pitzer is in
Washington, D.C.
Lyman labeled "completely
untrue" accusations that the
University exerted pressure on the
judge in Rupert's trial. He also
called the ROTC issue "a highly
charged symbolic issue rather than

a practical issue" and urged those
who want to change American
foreign policy to discuss foreign
policy rather than ROTC.
"Only people whose cases
could be prosecuted" were
charged with violating last year's
injunction, Lyman said during the
discussion. He explained that the
University could convict people of
violations of that injunction only
if it could be proven that people
committed actions that are in
violation of that injunction and
that they knew about the
injunction. University lawyers felt
that this applied only to five
people, according to Lyman.
He defended the existence of
ROTC on campus as long as it
coincides with the academic
nature of the University. Unless
one believes in unilateral
disarmament, dismantling the
military piece by piece doesn't
make sense, he said. The foreign
policy which shapes the military
must be regulated instead.
Pitzer and the administration
are taking the student referendum
that voted two to one against
credit for ROTC classes "under
consideration" and Pitzer will
probably release a statement on
the referendum this week, Lyman
said. In the referendum students
also voted by a narrow margin
support for keeping ROTC on
campus.
Lyman also said that he feels
that militant action is often
"counterproductive" with large
parts of the electorate.
He said that he prefers tactics
such as "rational dialogue" similar
to what was going on in the
office, for changing national or
University policy.

office, for changing national or
University policy.
In an hour-long "rational
dialogue" with about 40
anti-ROTC demonstrators in the
lobby of the President's office,
Provost Richard Lyman said
yesterday that the University is
"not trying to repress student
dissent" in its handling of ROTC
protests but is "determined to
keep from having coercive tactics
used to change decisions."
Lyman said later that the
University has "no intention" of
granting amnesty to individuals
who have been charged with
disruptive acts in demonstrations
over the last few weeks.
The debate followed a brief
noon rally at White Plaza by the
demonstrators at which they read
an ultimatum to the University. It
demands that the University:
eliminate ROTC from the campus
immediately; grant amnesty to all
persons arrested for anti-ROTC
activities; reverse its alleged
pressure on a federal judge who
sentenced Paul Rupert for draft
evasion; and that it meet these
demands by noon Thursday.
The group has threatened a
Thursday sit-in if these demands
are not met.
After the rally, the group
marched to the President's office
pestering along the way a
Stanford student manning a
Marine Corps recruiting table. The
demonstrators presented Lyman
with the ultimatum in President
Pitzer's absence. Pitzer is in
Washington, D.C.
Lyman labeled "completely
untrue" accusations that the
University exerted pressure on the
judge in Rupert's trial. He also
called the ROTC issue "a highly
charged symbolic issue rather than

a practical issue" and urged those
who want to change American
foreign policy to discuss foreign
policy rather than ROTC.
"Only people whose cases
could be prosecuted" were
charged with violating last year's
injunction, Lyman said during the
discussion. He explained that the
University could convict people of
violations of that injunction only
if it could be proven that people
committed actions that are in
violation of that injunction and
that they knew about the
injunction. University lawyers felt
that this applied only to five
people, according to Lyman.
He defended the existence of
ROTC on campus as long as it
coincides with the academic
nature of the University. Unless
one believes in unilateral
disarmament, dismantling the
military piece by piece doesn't
make sense, he said. The foreign
policy which shapes the military
must be regulated instead.
Pitzer and the administration
are taking the student referendum
that voted two to one against
credit for ROTC classes "under
consideration" and Pitzer will
probably release a statement on
the referendum this week, Lyman
said. In the referendum students
also voted by a narrow margin
support for keeping ROTC on
campus.
Lyman also said that he feels
that militant action is often
"counterproductive" with large
parts of the electorate.
He said that he prefers tactics
such as "rational dialogue" similar
to what was going on in the
office, for changing national or
