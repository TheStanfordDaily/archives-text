## Police Shot Killed Moran 
### 
SANTA BARBARA, (AP) -
Police Chief Albert Trembley said
Monday one of his men may have
fired the shot that killed a
University of California at Santa
Barbara student moments after he
doused a flame in a Bank of
America branch during a
disturbance last Saturday.
The patrolman, unidentified,
has been relieved of duty pending
an investigation by the state
attorney general's office,
Trembley told a news conference.
Trembley said the bullet
apparently ricocheted off a
building, killing Kevin P. Moran,
22, an honor student from
Saratoga, Calif., during the height
of the disturbance early Saturday
by young demonstrators in Isla
Vista, a small community adjacent
to the campus.
Earlier, sheriff's officers had
said the bullet was fired by a
sniper.
Chief Trembley said the
unidentified patrolman told him
he knew his rifle had discharged,
but on hearing reports the fatal
bullet was .22-caliber let the
matter drop. When the state crime
lab identified the bullet as
,30-caliber, the man met with the
chief.
Also at the news conference,
Webster said a dusk-to-dawn
curfew, imposed on the area since
Friday, was being eased to permit
students to attend nighttime
classes on the campus. A new
curfew, he said, would be in effect
from 1 1 p.m. to dawn.

From 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.,
Webster said, an anti-loitering
ordinance will be in effect and
riot-equipped deputies will
continue to patrol Isla Vista.
The deputies, he said, will
patrol from the back of
well-protected dump trucks and
will not ride in black and white
units.
"We are de-escalating,"
Webster said, adding that when
deputies use tear gas, it would be
only after an announcement.
He described the situation in
Isla Vista as calming but said he
had plenty of officers on hand
just in case.

SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP)
President Nixon told the nation
Monday night he plans to
withdraw 150,000 additional U.S.
troops from South Vietnam by
May 1971 and might order further
withdrawals if there were progress
on the negotiating front.
In a live television-radio
address from the Western White
House here, Nixon said: "The
decision I have announced tonight
means that we finally have in sight,
the just peace we are seeking. We
can now say with confidence that
pacification is succeeding.
"We can say with confidence
that the South Vietnamese can
develop the capability for their
own defense. We can say with
confidence that all American

combat forces can and will be
withdrawn."
While the 150,000 withdrawal
goal was triple any previous
pullout figure, it will be stretched
over a much longer time span.
However, a White House official
who declined to be identified by
name said the new withdrawal
target would mean the return to
the United States of uniformed
men at approximately the, same
rate as in recent months.
By May 1971, the official said,
the authorized U.S. troop ceiling
in South Vietnam would stand at
284,000, compared with a peak of
549,500 early in 1969.
Nixon said "The timing and
pace of these new withdrawals
within the overall schedule will be
determined by our best judgement
of the current military and
diplomatic situation."
The anonymous official
emphasized, however, that the
150,000 target is irreversible
under any foreseeable
circumstances.
At another point, the President
said, "America has never been
defeated in our proud 190-year
history and we shall not be
defeated in Vietnam."

MIAMI (AP) - Judge G. Harrold
Car.swell announced Monday he
had resigned from the U.S. sth
Circuit Court of Appeals and
would seek the Republican
p.omination for the U.S. Senate,

which two weeks ago rejected him
as an associate justice of the
Supreme Court.
Carswell told a Miami news
conference he had submitted his
resignation to President Nixon,
who had nominated him for the
high court. He is seeking the seat
being vacated by retiring Sen.
Spessard Holland, 76, a Democrat.
"In announcing my
candidacy," Carswell said, "I do
so in the belief that the
Republican Party today offers
Floridians the best channel of
providing the conservative
government in which our citizens
believe."
Accompanying Carswell at
Monday's news conference were
Florida Gov. Claude Kirk, Sen. Ed
Gurney, R-Fla., Osborne and
other state Republican leaders.
"The election of a United
States senator from Florida this
November offers a real and vital
opportunity to join President
Nixon in his goals of restructuring
our country and its government
along Constitutional, conservative
lines."
