ROTC Courses
Editor,The Daily:
1 regret that the article carried
by the Daily on April 20 based
upon a telephone interview with
me appeared to carry the
implication that the
subcommittee on undergraduate
specials had already decided that
ROTC courses are "unlikely" to
receive credit.
In my interview I explained
that each ROTC course will be
considered individually as it is
submitted and will be judged
solely on the basis of its academic
appropriateness. When I was asked
about the so-called "punitive"
clause, I explained that it might
well have a bearing since one of
the guidelines the committee had
established was that the
"assessment and prescribed
consequences of course
performance and completion
should be academically
appropriate." Since, however, no
course has yet come before the
committee for consideration, just
how this guideline will be applied
cannot be anticipated. Certainly
there is no reason to assume at
this point that the granting of
credit for ROTC courses is
"unlikely."
Again, with respect to other
standards "such as whether there
is a conflict between the ROTC
officers' role as an instructor and
his imployment by the military,"
I tried to make it clear that such
possible conflicts of interest are
considered by the committee with
respect to all undergraduate
specials submitted for
consideration. There is no way to
judge specific ROTC courses with
respect to this and other general

standards being followed by the
committee.

Physical Sciences
(The article in yesterday's Daily
on CUS and ROTC credit did
stress that "Specific ROTC course
petitions have not yet been
evaluated." The article also said
that Prof. Ripley told the Daily
reporter that "each ROTC course
submitted will be considered
individually . . . '
The statement that ROTC
classes are unlikely to receive
credit from the CUS is a
conclusion based on interviews
with Prof. Ripley and other
members of the committee and
subcommittee that will consider
credit for ROTC classes.—Ed )
Speech And Drama
Editor, The Daily:
There is a danger that the alarm
and despondency being publicly
expressed about the budget cut in
the drama department will do
more harm to the department's
prospects next year than the
economies themselves. In order to
avoid misunderstanding, it should
be pointed out that, within the
drama division, the cuts fall
principally on the theatre
operation and only marginally
upon teaching and classes. Play
production will continue, but
with fewer resources to advertise
and promote audiences and no
funds to underwrite failure. The
confidence and support of the
campus and community and a
maintenance of the interest that
has grown throughout this year
will be our strong need.
The department was in any case
regrouping itself after the
cessation of the Stanford
Repertory Theatre company with
professional actors in residence.

This came to an end, in all but
name, in June 1968. Now that it
is necessary to terminate the
promotional, fro n t-o f-ho use and
business staff and make
reductions in the wardrobe and
workshops, it is timely to
recognize that the successes of thp
present year are the student and
faculty productions of a very
good university drama
department. The M.F.A. program,
which plays a major part in these
successes has been retained, with
the exception of the small
program for theatre directors. I
was, separately, considering
stopping recruitment to this
program until it could be
reconstructed and strengthened.
This will now have to wait.
There has never been, to my
knowledge, any intention of
discontinuing the Ph.D. or
Undergraduate programs in
drama. The standards required by
the former program have and are
being raised and there will be a
closer integration of
undergraduate play productions
within the department. These are
both forward looking moves. The
freshman acting course and the
limited course for undergraduate
voice-training, that were added
last September, cannot, as things
at present stand, be taught next
year. I hope that the ommission
will be temporary. It will be
remembered that the acting
course was first taught as the
result of the devotion of a
graduate student.
I conclude by urging; there will
be a drama department, whose
reputation still attracts graduate
students from all over the
country. There will be
productions of plays with good
actors. We shall need the interest,

comment and attendance of
audiences.

ASSU Committees
Editor, The Daily:
Student positions on University
committees go begging and those
that don't never have any student
members who care to tell the
community what's happening.
Students are here four years,
faculty much longer, and
administrations and boards
seemingly forever. Think about
what this means about the stakes
involved in decision making. We,
the students, rarely stay around
long enough to witness or be
directly affected by the
consequences of most substantial
decisions. Some of the ASSU
presidential candidates are
proposing powerful
student-faculty committees to
provide the ASSU with effective
political leadership The
preceeding observations have
made me skeptical.
Vital student issues reach far
beyond the boundaries of the
campus (racism, war, ecological
crisis). Can we devise a permanent
ASSU political organ to cope with
such issues or may be better
relegate such organization to
independent groups specifically
structured to deal with them
separately? Where has the
leadership been most impressive?
Perhaps the ASSU should focus
on the administrative arena
(where it is less than efficient
now)? I don't know the answer,
but let's consider all the
alternatives (including a voluntary
organization) and admit their
limitations.

regrouping itself after the
cessation of the Stanford
Repertory Theatre company with
professional actors in residence.

This came to an end, in all but
name, in June 1968. Now that it
is necessary to terminate the
promotional, fro n t-o f-ho use and
business staff and make
reductions in the wardrobe and
workshops, it is timely to
recognize that the successes of thp
present year are the student and
faculty productions of a very
good university drama
department. The M.F.A. program,
which plays a major part in these
successes has been retained, with
the exception of the small
program for theatre directors. I
was, separately, considering
stopping recruitment to this
program until it could be
reconstructed and strengthened.
This will now have to wait.
There has never been, to my
knowledge, any intention of
discontinuing the Ph.D. or
Undergraduate programs in
drama. The standards required by
the former program have and are
being raised and there will be a
closer integration of
undergraduate play productions
within the department. These are
both forward looking moves. The
freshman acting course and the
limited course for undergraduate
voice-training, that were added
last September, cannot, as things
at present stand, be taught next
year. I hope that the ommission
will be temporary. It will be
remembered that the acting
course was first taught as the
result of the devotion of a
graduate student.
I conclude by urging; there will
be a drama department, whose
reputation still attracts graduate
students from all over the
country. There will be
productions of plays with good
actors. We shall need the interest,

comment and attendance of
audiences.

Student positions on University
committees go begging and those
that don't never have any student
members who care to tell the
community what's happening.
Students are here four years,
faculty much longer, and
administrations and boards
seemingly forever. Think about
what this means about the stakes
involved in decision making. We,
the students, rarely stay around
long enough to witness or be
directly affected by the
consequences of most substantial
decisions. Some of the ASSU
presidential candidates are
proposing powerful
student-faculty committees to
provide the ASSU with effective
political leadership The
preceeding observations have
made me skeptical.
Vital student issues reach far
beyond the boundaries of the
campus (racism, war, ecological
crisis). Can we devise a permanent
ASSU political organ to cope with
such issues or may be better
relegate such organization to
independent groups specifically
structured to deal with them
separately? Where has the
leadership been most impressive?
Perhaps the ASSU should focus
on the administrative arena
(where it is less than efficient
now)? I don't know the answer,
but let's consider all the
alternatives (including a voluntary
organization) and admit their
limitations.

1 regret that the article carried
by the Daily on April 20 based
upon a telephone interview with
me appeared to carry the
implication that the
subcommittee on undergraduate
specials had already decided that
ROTC courses are "unlikely" to
receive credit.
In my interview I explained
that each ROTC course will be
considered individually as it is
submitted and will be judged
solely on the basis of its academic
appropriateness. When I was asked
about the so-called "punitive"
clause, I explained that it might
well have a bearing since one of
the guidelines the committee had
established was that the
"assessment and prescribed
consequences of course
performance and completion
should be academically
appropriate." Since, however, no
course has yet come before the
committee for consideration, just
how this guideline will be applied
cannot be anticipated. Certainly
there is no reason to assume at
this point that the granting of
credit for ROTC courses is
"unlikely."
Again, with respect to other
standards "such as whether there
is a conflict between the ROTC
officers' role as an instructor and
his imployment by the military,"
I tried to make it clear that such
possible conflicts of interest are
considered by the committee with
respect to all undergraduate
specials submitted for
consideration. There is no way to
judge specific ROTC courses with
respect to this and other general

standards being followed by the
committee.

ROTC Courses
Editor,The Daily:
1 regret that the article carried
by the Daily on April 20 based
upon a telephone interview with
me appeared to carry the
implication that the
subcommittee on undergraduate
specials had already decided that
ROTC courses are "unlikely" to
receive credit.
In my interview I explained
that each ROTC course will be
considered individually as it is
submitted and will be judged
solely on the basis of its academic
appropriateness. When I was asked
about the so-called "punitive"
clause, I explained that it might
well have a bearing since one of
the guidelines the committee had
established was that the
"assessment and prescribed
consequences of course
performance and completion
should be academically
appropriate." Since, however, no
course has yet come before the
committee for consideration, just
how this guideline will be applied
cannot be anticipated. Certainly
there is no reason to assume at
this point that the granting of
credit for ROTC courses is
"unlikely."
Again, with respect to other
standards "such as whether there
is a conflict between the ROTC
officers' role as an instructor and
his imployment by the military,"
I tried to make it clear that such
possible conflicts of interest are
considered by the committee with
respect to all undergraduate
specials submitted for
consideration. There is no way to
judge specific ROTC courses with
respect to this and other general

standards being followed by the
committee.

(The article in yesterday's Daily
on CUS and ROTC credit did
stress that "Specific ROTC course
petitions have not yet been
evaluated." The article also said
that Prof. Ripley told the Daily
reporter that "each ROTC course
submitted will be considered
individually . . . '
The statement that ROTC
classes are unlikely to receive
credit from the CUS is a
conclusion based on interviews
with Prof. Ripley and other
members of the committee and
subcommittee that will consider
credit for ROTC classes.—Ed )
Speech And Drama
Editor, The Daily:
There is a danger that the alarm
and despondency being publicly
expressed about the budget cut in
the drama department will do
more harm to the department's
prospects next year than the
economies themselves. In order to
avoid misunderstanding, it should
be pointed out that, within the
drama division, the cuts fall
principally on the theatre
operation and only marginally
upon teaching and classes. Play
production will continue, but
with fewer resources to advertise
and promote audiences and no
funds to underwrite failure. The
confidence and support of the
campus and community and a
maintenance of the interest that
has grown throughout this year
will be our strong need.
The department was in any case
regrouping itself after the
cessation of the Stanford
Repertory Theatre company with
professional actors in residence.

This came to an end, in all but
name, in June 1968. Now that it
is necessary to terminate the
promotional, fro n t-o f-ho use and
business staff and make
reductions in the wardrobe and
workshops, it is timely to
recognize that the successes of thp
present year are the student and
faculty productions of a very
good university drama
department. The M.F.A. program,
which plays a major part in these
successes has been retained, with
the exception of the small
program for theatre directors. I
was, separately, considering
stopping recruitment to this
program until it could be
reconstructed and strengthened.
This will now have to wait.
There has never been, to my
knowledge, any intention of
discontinuing the Ph.D. or
Undergraduate programs in
drama. The standards required by
the former program have and are
being raised and there will be a
closer integration of
undergraduate play productions
within the department. These are
both forward looking moves. The
freshman acting course and the
limited course for undergraduate
voice-training, that were added
last September, cannot, as things
at present stand, be taught next
year. I hope that the ommission
will be temporary. It will be
remembered that the acting
course was first taught as the
result of the devotion of a
graduate student.
I conclude by urging; there will
be a drama department, whose
reputation still attracts graduate
students from all over the
country. There will be
productions of plays with good
actors. We shall need the interest,

comment and attendance of
audiences.

ASSU Committees
Editor, The Daily:
Student positions on University
committees go begging and those
that don't never have any student
members who care to tell the
community what's happening.
Students are here four years,
faculty much longer, and
administrations and boards
seemingly forever. Think about
what this means about the stakes
involved in decision making. We,
the students, rarely stay around
long enough to witness or be
directly affected by the
consequences of most substantial
decisions. Some of the ASSU
presidential candidates are
proposing powerful
student-faculty committees to
provide the ASSU with effective
political leadership The
preceeding observations have
made me skeptical.
Vital student issues reach far
beyond the boundaries of the
campus (racism, war, ecological
crisis). Can we devise a permanent
ASSU political organ to cope with
such issues or may be better
relegate such organization to
independent groups specifically
structured to deal with them
separately? Where has the
leadership been most impressive?
Perhaps the ASSU should focus
on the administrative arena
(where it is less than efficient
now)? I don't know the answer,
