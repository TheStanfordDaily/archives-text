# Nader's Raiders
## GM Proposals Explained 
### Tim Clark 
This week's ASSU election will
include a referendum on two
proposals that General Motors
shareholders will vote on at their
May 22 annual meeting. Stanford
owns 24,060 shares of General
Motors stock, and a joint meeting
of the trustee committee on
academic affairs and the
committee on finance last week
considered the proposals and how
Stanford would vote its shares.
After discussion, the matters was
referred to an ad hoc committee
which will report back early in
May. Student members of the
committees reported that most
Trustees present reacted
negatively to the two proposals.
The two proposals, which the
SEC directed GM to include on its
agenda after GM had rejected
them, were initiated by the
Project on Corporate
Responsibility, a group of
"Nader's Raiders." The Project
owns twelve shares of General
Motors stock.
The first of the two proposals
to appear on the ASSU
referendum would establish a GM
Shareholders Committee for
Corporate Responsibility. The
committee would have fifteen to
twenty-five members, including
representatives from GM
management, the United Auto
Workers, environmental and
conservation groups, consumers,
the academic community, civil
rights organizations, labor, the

scientific community, religious
and social organizations, and small
stockholders. The Committee
members would be chosen by a
representative from the GM board
of directors, the UAW, and a
Nader group.
Quoting from the proposal,
"The Committee for Corporate
Responsibility shall prepare a
report and make recommend
ations to the shareholders with
respect to the role of the
corporation in modern society
and how to achieve a proper
balance between the rights and
interest of shareholders,
employees, consumers and the
general public." The Committee is
directed specifically to examine
GM's past and present efforts to
produce a safe, reliable, and
non-polluting automobile and to
encourage the establishment of an
effective low-cost mass

transportation system.
The committee is also directed
to examine "The manner in which
the Corporation (GM) has used its
vast economic power to
contribute to the social welfare of
the nation." The Committee is
authorized to employ staff
members for its task and is given
"the power to obtain any
information from the Corporation
and its employees as deemed
relevant by the Committee."
The other proposal would
expand the GM board of directors
from twenty-four to twenty-seven
members, adding three directors
as "representatives of the public."
The project has nominated three
directors for the new positions:
Betty Furness, Special Assistant
for Consumer Affairs under
I*resident Johnson and currently
consumer affairs columnist for
McCalls; Reverend ("banning

Phillips, a black minister from
Washington, D.C., and Presidential
nominee at the 1968 Democratic
Convention; and Rene Dubos, a
biologist on the faculty of
Rockefeller University and
member of the Citizen's Advisory
Committee on Environmental
Quality. The Project on Corporate
Responsibility considers this
proposal "one method to insure
that the Corporation will consider
the impact of its decisions on
important public issues."
(Tomorrow an analysis of the
proposals and a response to
criticisms.)
