I Please help.
All of us hate to see empty cans and bottles lousing
up what's left of a beautiful country.
It's too bad packaging technology today isn't
as exotic and convenient'as the gimmicks and
gadgets on the TV thrill shows; like you, we'd like
nothing better than for every empty can and
bottle to self-destruct. Someday, soon, things will
be different, though... because we and a lot of
other concerned people are all working on the
problem in earnest.
Meantime, there is a foolproof way to keep cans
and bottles from cluttering up the countryside,
and you can do your part:
Please don't throw them there in the first place.
