ANNOUNCEMENT: FIRST COMPLETE
ACCOUNT OF MY LAI MASSACRE
PUBLISHED IN MAY HARPER'S
MAGAZINE. Seymour Ilersch documents
with eyewitness accounts the events before,
during and after the My Lai -I Massacre
on March 16. 1968. Herseh, the writer who
first broke the story, has interviewed mili
tary commanders, investigators both in
Vietnam and Washington, Vietnamese sur
vivors, and more than 50 members of
Charlie Company.
In this 30,000 word account, he recon
structs the massacre itself, the failure of
high military officials to report the truth,
and the reaction to the murders in America
and elsewhere. Hersch examines the back
grounds of the men and officers involved in
the murder of, according to his estimates,
between 450 and 500 civilians — mostly
women and children — of the hamlet's pop
ulation of 700.
It's the first detailed report to appear
in print. A psecial supplement in this
month's HARPER MAGAZINE, Amer
ica's First Monthly. On sale now.
