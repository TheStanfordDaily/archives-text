# Shea Quartet Airs Opinions
## 
### 
Next to its opponents, the
Patrick C. Shea—Robert
Grant—Hal Mickelson—Adam
Levin ticket sets a moderate tone.
The four have chosen to focus
their campaign on improving
student services and academic
reform and have steered away
from broad political questions,
which they feel are not the
immediate problems for student
government. But this decision has
created a problem for the
candidates.
"Because we came out so
strong for revitalized student
services, people think we are
trying to avoid issues. This isn't
true," declares Shea (no relation
to the current president).
All four criticize the opposing
slate for its lack of commitment
to programs such as SWOPSj,
committee nominations, special
events, and other student services,
that the Shea group number
among the chief accomplishments
of this year's Council of
Presidents.
"One of the dangers of their
position is that these programs
will be severely hampered through
neglect," argues Shea. "These
programs have got to be pushed
by the presidency."
Added Grant, "The argument

that these organizations will go on
by themselves is not true."
Politics Noted
The group plans to avoid
taking continual political stands,
which they see as only part of the
job as ASSU president. "If ASSU
is a political organization, it isn t
going to command a majority of
the community," states
Mickelson. "But if it has support
along with its concerns, it can
command a sense of involvement.
So I don't think it's frivolous to
talk of entertainment and student
services. It's real, it's
immediate—people support it."
Commented Levin, "It's one
thing to be visionary, but I thihk
that it's important to have the
skill and the tact to have people
consider your program. You have
to work to get anything done."
Mickelson feels an
over-emphasis on politics will lead
to some of the mistakes of this
year's student Senate. "The worst
thing about the Senate was that
every Friday morning there was a
story in the Daily about a
debating society that had met the
night before, calling itself the
Student Senate."
Committees Cited
Committees are one area in
which students can play a large

role in planning the University's
future, feels Grant. Yet he says
this role may be too new to
explain or understand fully. How
best can committees relate to the
University community? Are there
too many? Which are the most
influential?
"We definitely want to see
further representation," says
Grant, "but the exact manner
isn't really clear. We have no
grand solution, but we want to
make sure that student
representation does exist." Staff
membership is mandatory as well,
he added.
"The president may have
residual power, but in reality it's
shared by many of the faculty
committees which include student
representation," stated Grant.
"The fact is the president can't
handle everything at once, and so
he acts on committee
recommendations."
The candidates also hope to

publish a newsletter outlining
their thoughts and reporting their
progress. Explained Shea, "very
few students know what's going
on at ASSU."
Analysis Desired
Commented Grant, "Most
people have no idea of the
University's structure. We want to
give them our analysis and what
they need to know so they can
form their own ideas."
On the issue of land
development, Grant, who is a
member of the Advisory
Committee on Land and Building
Development, declared, "It
doesn't make a lot of sense to
continue the development of
Coyote Hill. The total rent from
all land development including the
Shopping Center brings in only 3
percent of the total budget. It
simply isn't worth it."
On ROTC the four feel the
program should remain on campus
but without credit.

The four have chosen to focus
their campaign on improving
student services and academic
reform and have steered away
from broad political questions,
which they feel are not the
immediate problems for student
government. But this decision has
created a problem for the
candidates.
"Because we came out so
strong for revitalized student
services, people think we are
trying to avoid issues. This isn't
true," declares Shea (no relation
to the current president).
All four criticize the opposing
slate for its lack of commitment
to programs such as SWOPSj,
committee nominations, special
events, and other student services,
that the Shea group number
among the chief accomplishments
of this year's Council of
Presidents.
"One of the dangers of their
position is that these programs
will be severely hampered through
neglect," argues Shea. "These
programs have got to be pushed
by the presidency."
Added Grant, "The argument

that these organizations will go on
by themselves is not true."
Politics Noted
The group plans to avoid
taking continual political stands,
which they see as only part of the
job as ASSU president. "If ASSU
is a political organization, it isn t
going to command a majority of
the community," states
Mickelson. "But if it has support
along with its concerns, it can
command a sense of involvement.
So I don't think it's frivolous to
talk of entertainment and student
services. It's real, it's
immediate—people support it."
Commented Levin, "It's one
thing to be visionary, but I thihk
that it's important to have the
skill and the tact to have people
consider your program. You have
to work to get anything done."
Mickelson feels an
over-emphasis on politics will lead
to some of the mistakes of this
year's student Senate. "The worst
thing about the Senate was that
every Friday morning there was a
story in the Daily about a
debating society that had met the
night before, calling itself the
Student Senate."
Committees Cited
Committees are one area in
which students can play a large

role in planning the University's
future, feels Grant. Yet he says
this role may be too new to
explain or understand fully. How
best can committees relate to the
University community? Are there
too many? Which are the most
influential?
"We definitely want to see
further representation," says
Grant, "but the exact manner
isn't really clear. We have no
grand solution, but we want to
make sure that student
representation does exist." Staff
membership is mandatory as well,
he added.
"The president may have
residual power, but in reality it's
shared by many of the faculty
committees which include student
representation," stated Grant.
"The fact is the president can't
handle everything at once, and so
he acts on committee
recommendations."
The candidates also hope to

publish a newsletter outlining
their thoughts and reporting their
progress. Explained Shea, "very
few students know what's going
on at ASSU."
Analysis Desired
Commented Grant, "Most
people have no idea of the
University's structure. We want to
give them our analysis and what
they need to know so they can
form their own ideas."
On the issue of land
development, Grant, who is a
member of the Advisory
Committee on Land and Building
Development, declared, "It
doesn't make a lot of sense to
continue the development of
Coyote Hill. The total rent from
all land development including the
Shopping Center brings in only 3
percent of the total budget. It
simply isn't worth it."
On ROTC the four feel the
program should remain on campus
but without credit.
