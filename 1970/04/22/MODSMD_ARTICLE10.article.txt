The Daily would like to reiterate its support for the
presidential ticket of John Shoch and Bill Evers. Our
reasons remain the same; Shoch and Evers stand for iniative
and refusal to accept slowly evolving reform. Rather they
believe Stanford needs fundamental change both to cope
with and accelerate the social and political change of the
Seventies.
Ihe Patrick C. Shea ticket stands with its namesake in
believing tha reform can move the students into a position
of power, where they can accomplish goals desirable to
students.
These characteristics disturb us about the Shea ticket:
-Internal inconsistencies over the issue of ROTC credit.
Mickelson has said privately that he personally supports
limited credit for ROTC and therefore is in disagreement
with the entire ticket's stand on thyissue.
—A refusal to meet in open public debate. If members of
the Shea slate are afraid to appear in front of a meeting of
students, how can they fulfill their responsibilities as
leaders?
—The failure to analyze, challenge or criticize the
location and distribution of power within the University.
—The failure to advance any significant new educational
reforms.
Iniatiating change and pressing the issue of student rights
should be the fundamental concern of the ASSU Presidency
next year.
We believe that the ASSU President must take steps to
regain what little power students have and get more of the
power students deserve. We don't think Shoch and Evers
can accomplish this in their one year in office: we only
believe they can start. And that's all we can ask of any one
slate.
