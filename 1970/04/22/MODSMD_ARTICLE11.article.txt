# Reconsider
## 
### 
We want to eliminate academic credit for ROTC. The
great majority of students want that too. We also would like
officer's training off campus. On this point students are
almost equally divided.
Still, the faculty and the administration have decided
that ROTC will stay and may have limited credit. The
question now is how can that decision be changed.
A number of people think they have the answer.
Administrators chide that students must work through
channels and wait until next year when the faculty
reconsiders the issue. "ROTC will die of its own weight,"
they say.
The Off-ROTC movement has a different answer, of
course. They want us to force officer's training from the
campus, and they see a Thursday sit-in as part of that
project.
We don't see either argument as an answer to our
problem. On the one hand we firmly reject administration
and faculty arguments which ask us to wait a year. We are
admittedly impatient; we can not promise to limit our
actions to those sanctioned by the system while that same
system shows itself to be unable to respond to
overwhelming student sentiment. We have also seen how
J much faculty and administration promises can change in a
| year, and wc are naturally wary of any delay.
On the other hand, we stand unconvinced of the
■effectiveness of a sit-in. While radical rhetoric may demand
a sit-in, the objective situation does not warrant it—yet.
A large part of our skepticism with radical politics
derives from our rejection of much of the radical or
revolutionary rhetoric. The ultimatum demanding President
Pitzer to ban ROTC from campus and to grant amnesty to
demonstrators only creates false issues. Pitzer does not have
the power to do either.
Nevertheless, regardless of the differences we have with
the tactics of the Off-ROTC movement, we are united with
them in their goal of removing officer's training from
campus.
So we ask three things.
First, that in its Thursday meeting the faculty Senate
suspend the "orders of the day"and reconsider the ROTC
question. If this fails concerned senators should petition to
put the issue on next week's agenda (only eight persons are
needed for this).
There is ample justification for this action. When, this
February, the Senate reconsidered its 1969 decision
barring academic credit from ROTC courses, it supported its
action primarily on two assumptions: 1) that the 1969
student referendum asking for limited ROTC credit should
count for something; and 2) that Stanford administrators
had gotten the best deal they could from the Army. That
underpinning is now virtually destroyed.
Student referenda should count, and that is one of the
reasons the faculty should reconsider its vote. Also, it now
appears certain that the army would remain on campus even
if it did not have credit.
There has been some controversy over this last point. On
March 31 the Daily reported a conversation with the head
of the national army ROTC program in which he said credit
was only a "minor issue" that would not affect the army's
status here. Last Thursday the Daily talked to Col. Stanley
Ramey, head of the army contingent on campus, and he is
reported to have said that even if the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies denied its credit, the program would
stay. In a published letter the next day Ramey questioned
that "connotation" but admitted the army accepted this
year's proposal with the realization that it started with no
credit.
But faculty reconsideration is not enough; therefore our
second request is that the University administration assure
us that if the punitive clause remains in the Army ROTC
contracts next year, it will recommend to the faculty that
the officer's training programs be eliminated at that time.
In recent statements, Provost Richard Lyman has said
that the programs would be in "serious danger" if the
punitive clauses are not removed. The sense of his
statements has been that the clauses would have to be
removed if officer's training is to remain. Public
committment to that sense should not be difficult.
And, finally, we ask that President Pitzer call a two-day
moratorium on classes during which administrators, faculty,
and students can discuss this issue that is obviously of great
concern to them all. They want rational dialogue. So do we.
All of these things can be done in the next two days
before the sit-in.
The administration needs to be flexible. It must stop
talking about the danger of "appeasing radicals."

count for something; and 2) that Stanford administrators
had gotten the best deal they could from the Army. That
underpinning is now virtually destroyed.
Student referenda should count, and that is one of the
reasons the faculty should reconsider its vote. Also, it now
appears certain that the army would remain on campus even
if it did not have credit.
There has been some controversy over this last point. On
March 31 the Daily reported a conversation with the head
of the national army ROTC program in which he said credit
was only a "minor issue" that would not affect the army's
status here. Last Thursday the Daily talked to Col. Stanley
Ramey, head of the army contingent on campus, and he is
reported to have said that even if the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies denied its credit, the program would
stay. In a published letter the next day Ramey questioned
that "connotation" but admitted the army accepted this
year's proposal with the realization that it started with no
credit.
But faculty reconsideration is not enough; therefore our
second request is that the University administration assure
us that if the punitive clause remains in the Army ROTC
contracts next year, it will recommend to the faculty that
the officer's training programs be eliminated at that time.
In recent statements, Provost Richard Lyman has said
that the programs would be in "serious danger" if the
punitive clauses are not removed. The sense of his
statements has been that the clauses would have to be
removed if officer's training is to remain. Public
committment to that sense should not be difficult.
And, finally, we ask that President Pitzer call a two-day
moratorium on classes during which administrators, faculty,
and students can discuss this issue that is obviously of great
concern to them all. They want rational dialogue. So do we.
All of these things can be done in the next two days
before the sit-in.
The administration needs to be flexible. It must stop
talking about the danger of "appeasing radicals."
WHF
We want to eliminate academic credit for ROTC. The
great majority of students want that too. We also would like
officer's training off campus. On this point students are
almost equally divided.
Still, the faculty and the administration have decided
that ROTC will stay and may have limited credit. The
question now is how can that decision be changed.
A number of people think they have the answer.
Administrators chide that students must work through
channels and wait until next year when the faculty
reconsiders the issue. "ROTC will die of its own weight,"
they say.
The Off-ROTC movement has a different answer, of
course. They want us to force officer's training from the
campus, and they see a Thursday sit-in as part of that
project.
We don't see either argument as an answer to our
problem. On the one hand we firmly reject administration
and faculty arguments which ask us to wait a year. We are
admittedly impatient; we can not promise to limit our
actions to those sanctioned by the system while that same
system shows itself to be unable to respond to
overwhelming student sentiment. We have also seen how
J much faculty and administration promises can change in a
| year, and wc are naturally wary of any delay.
On the other hand, we stand unconvinced of the
■effectiveness of a sit-in. While radical rhetoric may demand
a sit-in, the objective situation does not warrant it—yet.
A large part of our skepticism with radical politics
derives from our rejection of much of the radical or
revolutionary rhetoric. The ultimatum demanding President
Pitzer to ban ROTC from campus and to grant amnesty to
demonstrators only creates false issues. Pitzer does not have
the power to do either.
Nevertheless, regardless of the differences we have with
the tactics of the Off-ROTC movement, we are united with
them in their goal of removing officer's training from
campus.
So we ask three things.
First, that in its Thursday meeting the faculty Senate
suspend the "orders of the day"and reconsider the ROTC
question. If this fails concerned senators should petition to
put the issue on next week's agenda (only eight persons are
needed for this).
There is ample justification for this action. When, this
February, the Senate reconsidered its 1969 decision
barring academic credit from ROTC courses, it supported its
action primarily on two assumptions: 1) that the 1969
student referendum asking for limited ROTC credit should
count for something; and 2) that Stanford administrators
had gotten the best deal they could from the Army. That
underpinning is now virtually destroyed.
