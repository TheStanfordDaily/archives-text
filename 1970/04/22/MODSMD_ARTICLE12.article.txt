# Statement
## Shoch And Evers 
### 
Today, when we students look
at Stanford University, we see an
institution which is often
portrayed as essentially a home of
wisdom and learning. But instead
of that, we see a university locked
in the embrace of those
institutions which have destroyed
the moral integrity of America
society: the federal government
and the military-industrial
complex.
It is a thesis of the Shoch-Evers
campaign that one central factor
in this mutual seduction is the
University administration and the
diffusion of the administrative
mentality among faculty members
and sadly also among students.
As far as the role of student
government is this process goes,
Carl Davidson summed up the
situation very accurately when he
wrote: "While student
governments vary in form in the
United States, the objective
reasons for their existence are the
containment, or pacification and
manipulation of the student
body . . . Perhaps the worst aspect
of this kind of manipulation and
repression is that the
administration uses students to
control other students. Most
student governments politicos are
lackeys of the worst sort. That is,
they have internalized and
embraced all the repressive
mechanisms the administration
has designed for use against them
and their fellow students."
Most Populous Constituency
Students are the most
populous constituency in the

university. Yet the mass thing
called students does not have the
sort of control over the
educational endeavor (which is
what brings students to the
university) that would make the
tea ching-and-learning process
closer to the concerns which
students have and would point
that process in directions which
students would like to pursue.
The control over the resources
which determine the direction of
educational activities at Stanford
lies in the hands of officials of the
federal government, large
corporations, and foundations.
The limits of what is done at the
university are determined by the
interests of these external
institutions. Their officials
negotiate with faculty members
and researchers to decide what
projects will be worked on in the
university. The Shoch-Evers
ticket's tuition diversion plan for
university-paid instructors and
university accreditation for
student-initiated SWOPSI-type
courses would serve to put control
over resources back in students'
hands. This plan is specifically
designed to remedy in part a
situation in which students do not
control significant aspects of their
own lives. We hope in various
ways to place a greater proportion
of the decision-making in the
teaching-and-learning process back
in students' hands.
One approach in this effort will
be pointing out what the external
institutions which impinge on the
educational process are up to

when they are trying to influence
the content of education at
Stanford.
Another approach will be
instituting changes such that the
changes will serve to undermine
those structures of the university
which particularly diminish the
opportunity for student initiative.
We propose a plan similar to
one presently in effect at Sussex
University in England. In this
plan, students taking a professor's
course go with him on a retreat
after the course is well under way.
There the students confront the
professors as equals. They play
back tapes of the professor's
lectures, indicating where he is
being effective and where he is
not, where his subject matter is
relevant to their interests and
where it is irrelevant.
Whatever is done in the way of
real educational reform at
Stanford is needed. But at the
root of the problems lies the
distribution of power in the
university and the society at large.
All students at Stanford must
remember that the established
institutions of American society
demand conformity to the
dominant values and interests in
this society as the price of
supporting educational activities.
In order to free ourselves from
this unsatisfactory situation, it is
necessary to speak truth to power
and to act to gain control of our
lives.

The control over the resources
which determine the direction of
educational activities at Stanford
lies in the hands of officials of the
federal government, large
corporations, and foundations.
The limits of what is done at the
university are determined by the
interests of these external
institutions. Their officials
negotiate with faculty members
and researchers to decide what
projects will be worked on in the
university. The Shoch-Evers
ticket's tuition diversion plan for
university-paid instructors and
university accreditation for
student-initiated SWOPSI-type
courses would serve to put control
over resources back in students'
hands. This plan is specifically
designed to remedy in part a
situation in which students do not
control significant aspects of their
own lives. We hope in various
ways to place a greater proportion
of the decision-making in the
teaching-and-learning process back
in students' hands.
One approach in this effort will
be pointing out what the external
institutions which impinge on the
educational process are up to

when they are trying to influence
the content of education at
Stanford.
Another approach will be
instituting changes such that the
changes will serve to undermine
those structures of the university
which particularly diminish the
opportunity for student initiative.
We propose a plan similar to
one presently in effect at Sussex
University in England. In this
plan, students taking a professor's
course go with him on a retreat
after the course is well under way.
There the students confront the
professors as equals. They play
back tapes of the professor's
lectures, indicating where he is
being effective and where he is
not, where his subject matter is
relevant to their interests and
where it is irrelevant.
Whatever is done in the way of
real educational reform at
Stanford is needed. But at the
root of the problems lies the
distribution of power in the
university and the society at large.
All students at Stanford must
remember that the established
institutions of American society
demand conformity to the
dominant values and interests in
this society as the price of
supporting educational activities.
In order to free ourselves from
this unsatisfactory situation, it is
necessary to speak truth to power
and to act to gain control of our
lives.
Today, when we students look
at Stanford University, we see an
institution which is often
portrayed as essentially a home of
wisdom and learning. But instead
of that, we see a university locked
in the embrace of those
institutions which have destroyed
the moral integrity of America
society: the federal government
and the military-industrial
complex.
It is a thesis of the Shoch-Evers
campaign that one central factor
in this mutual seduction is the
University administration and the
diffusion of the administrative
mentality among faculty members
and sadly also among students.
As far as the role of student
government is this process goes,
Carl Davidson summed up the
situation very accurately when he
wrote: "While student
governments vary in form in the
United States, the objective
reasons for their existence are the
containment, or pacification and
manipulation of the student
body . . . Perhaps the worst aspect
of this kind of manipulation and
repression is that the
administration uses students to
control other students. Most
student governments politicos are
lackeys of the worst sort. That is,
they have internalized and
embraced all the repressive
mechanisms the administration
has designed for use against them
and their fellow students."
Most Populous Constituency
Students are the most
populous constituency in the

university. Yet the mass thing
called students does not have the
sort of control over the
educational endeavor (which is
what brings students to the
university) that would make the
tea ching-and-learning process
closer to the concerns which
students have and would point
that process in directions which
students would like to pursue.
