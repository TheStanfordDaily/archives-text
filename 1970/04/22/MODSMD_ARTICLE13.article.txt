## Constructive Change 
### 
The University must engage itself in
solving the moral and political problems
that face this nation and the world. In
today's election for ASSU President
students can promote the implementation
of that idea. They must vote for a slate of
candidates that will look beyond one
political issue and will work for establishing
the University as a constructive means of
change.
Shea-Grant-Mickelson-Levin have the
expertise, the desire, and the ideas that will
bring this about. They believe in reform -
not revolution.
The Shea ticket has committed itself to
University and society reform. They believe
that the University must "influence the
lethargic, unresponsive pyramids of
organizations which otherwise defy efforts
of reform."
Its members wish to confront political
issues as they are forming—before some
people feel it necessary to throw rocks.
They believe that students should help
make decisions instead of forcing their
change later. They feel that this is done by
placing responsible students, on
decision-making bodies-including the
Board of Trustees.
The alternative to this type of political
change is a reactionary backlash. Campus
disruptions elected Ronald Reagan. They
will probably re-elect him.
Shoch-Evers say they favor such
sweeping measures as abolishing the
Trustees. An astute observor of the
University should realize that the real hope
with the trustees is to make the Board
more responsive to the community's views.
The Shea ticket realizes this and favors
placing students and faculty on the Board
of Trustees, and of placing more students,
so they have real power, on influential
trustee committees.
The way to change the faculty or
trustees is not to address them as enemies
but rather to negotiate with them
rationally but firmly.
Obstructionist politics only prevent

action as illustrated by the student Senate
this year. Deliberate delay and provocation
of incidents, often led by then
vice-chairman and now chairman John
Shoch, have prevented this student
legislature from taking action-even on
crucial issues.
Stanford needs a student executive that
will bring about realistic implementation
and not provoke dramatic confrontations.
The ASSU also represents a service
organization for students-a fact largely
ignored by the Shoch-Evers ticket. John
Shoch has indicated that he feels that
programs including SWOPSI will take care
of itself and the he is only interested in the
"cosmic" issues.
The Shea ticket, however, can build a
constructive student organization that will
respond to the concerns of all students on
campus.
Bob Grant probably exemplifies this
idea of reform. Grant proposed to the
trustees that they vote the University's
General Motors stock in favor of Ralph
Naders consumer-oriented proposals and
has organized the student referendum on
the GM issue.
As member of the Trustee Finance
Committee and President's Committee on
Land and Building Development he chaired
and organized the recent open hearing on
land development in order to have
community views represented in the
eventual decisions.
Patrick C. Shea, as a Senate
representative, member of a Trustee
committee, and President of the Student
Alumni Association, has shown that he can
work with others for change.
Hal Mickelson (with academic reform)
and Adam Levin (with student services)
both have the experience and desire to
bring about necessary change.
Today and tomorrow students have the
choice between dramatic confrontation and
the realistic implementation of progressive
reforms.

organization for students-a fact largely
ignored by the Shoch-Evers ticket. John
Shoch has indicated that he feels that
programs including SWOPSI will take care
of itself and the he is only interested in the
"cosmic" issues.
The Shea ticket, however, can build a
constructive student organization that will
respond to the concerns of all students on
campus.
Bob Grant probably exemplifies this
idea of reform. Grant proposed to the
trustees that they vote the University's
General Motors stock in favor of Ralph
Naders consumer-oriented proposals and
has organized the student referendum on
the GM issue.
As member of the Trustee Finance
Committee and President's Committee on
Land and Building Development he chaired
and organized the recent open hearing on
land development in order to have
community views represented in the
eventual decisions.
Patrick C. Shea, as a Senate
representative, member of a Trustee
committee, and President of the Student
Alumni Association, has shown that he can
work with others for change.
Hal Mickelson (with academic reform)
and Adam Levin (with student services)
both have the experience and desire to
bring about necessary change.
Today and tomorrow students have the
choice between dramatic confrontation and
the realistic implementation of progressive
reforms.
F.R.M.
The University must engage itself in
solving the moral and political problems
that face this nation and the world. In
today's election for ASSU President
students can promote the implementation
of that idea. They must vote for a slate of
candidates that will look beyond one
political issue and will work for establishing
the University as a constructive means of
change.
Shea-Grant-Mickelson-Levin have the
expertise, the desire, and the ideas that will
bring this about. They believe in reform -
not revolution.
The Shea ticket has committed itself to
University and society reform. They believe
that the University must "influence the
lethargic, unresponsive pyramids of
organizations which otherwise defy efforts
of reform."
Its members wish to confront political
issues as they are forming—before some
people feel it necessary to throw rocks.
They believe that students should help
make decisions instead of forcing their
change later. They feel that this is done by
placing responsible students, on
decision-making bodies-including the
Board of Trustees.
The alternative to this type of political
change is a reactionary backlash. Campus
disruptions elected Ronald Reagan. They
will probably re-elect him.
Shoch-Evers say they favor such
sweeping measures as abolishing the
Trustees. An astute observor of the
University should realize that the real hope
with the trustees is to make the Board
more responsive to the community's views.
The Shea ticket realizes this and favors
placing students and faculty on the Board
of Trustees, and of placing more students,
so they have real power, on influential
trustee committees.
The way to change the faculty or
trustees is not to address them as enemies
but rather to negotiate with them
rationally but firmly.
Obstructionist politics only prevent

action as illustrated by the student Senate
this year. Deliberate delay and provocation
of incidents, often led by then
vice-chairman and now chairman John
Shoch, have prevented this student
legislature from taking action-even on
crucial issues.
Stanford needs a student executive that
will bring about realistic implementation
and not provoke dramatic confrontations.
The ASSU also represents a service
organization for students-a fact largely
ignored by the Shoch-Evers ticket. John
Shoch has indicated that he feels that
programs including SWOPSI will take care
of itself and the he is only interested in the
"cosmic" issues.
