The Stanford student body
needs experienced and qualified
leadership. Shea, Grant,
Mickelson, and Levin offer not
only leadership, but specific and
well-considered programs and
politics
Our opponents, on the other
hand, have offered only rhetoric.
They have attempted to exploit
immediate issues of concern for
their personal benefit; they have
substituted the perspective of
weeks for the perspective of a full
term in office. We have offered a
comprehensive program for an
entire year of ASSU activity.
Engagement of the University
The University cannot
withdraw itself from the world. It
must contribute to the solution of
moral and political problems: war,
racial and ethnic prejudice,
deterioration of our environment,
and unresponsive organizational
pyramids which defy efforts of
reform.
It is this belief in engagement
which leads us to commit
ourselves to the active recruitment
and support of minority students.
The University must positively
respond to the spurious argument

that minority admissions is racism
in reverse.
It is this belief which also leads
us to support the GM resolutions
on the runoff ballot. The
University has a duty to vote its
shares of stock responsibly.
Purposeful Academics
The University's most powerful
instrument of reform is the
knowledge it creates and
disseminates.
Most students reject a dull
routine of standardized courses
and unwanted requirements.
Many desire a curriculum which
has a visible purpose, a meaningful
relationship between thought and
action.
It is this belief which leads us
to support such educational
innovations as SWOPSI and the
Center for Innovation in
Education. These projects are vital
first steps in the transformation of
education from an indifferent,
passive experience to an exciting,
creative, and productive effort. If
the new Council of Presidents
does not commit itself to these
projects, they may very well
collapse and disappear. We
commit ourselves to their
continued success.
It is this belief which also leads
us to support the Course
Evaluation project. The strongest
incentive to better teaching is
feedback on performance. But
such a compilation is a difficult
and time-consuming task. We are
willing to commit our attention
and energy to such a worthwhile
effort.
Representative Governance
The University community
faces the prospect of continued
disruption until all of its members
feel represented in the decision
making processes.
We believe in broadening the
representation of all Stanford
constituencies on University
governing bodies as an alternative
to violence and destruction.
More can be accomplished by
dealing with an issue before it
becomes a problem than by
waiting until the decision is
completed and then denouncing
the result. We know the governing
structure of the University and
can use it to achieve real reforms.
The ASSU is one constituency
of University governance. The
Council of Presidents voices the
opinions of that constituency. If
the Council's words are clear and
its approach firm, its stature can
make it an influential agent of
change. It must represent the
views of the entire community,
not one segment.

We can fill that leadership role.
Our opponents cannot. One of
them has been in a position of
responsibility as Deputy Chairman
of the Senate for the entire year,
and yet he has offered no sign of
leadership nor any testimony on
the necessity for change until this
campaign. His running mate has
contributed no effort to any
ASSU activity at any time.
Many of the major policy
decisions of the University are
initiated in committees. Student
members of these committees are
selected by the Committee on
Nominations. At no time have our
opponents offered to contribute
their services to any of the many
committees which could use their
help.
Shea, Grant, Mickelson, and
Levin have contributed their time
and effort to these unspectacular
jobs that are so essential to the
functioning of the University.
Student government is not all
preparation, study, and work. Our
opponents have shown no
willingness to undertake such
efforts. We have and we will again
in the coming year.
Our Program
We offer a thoughtful,
balanced approach to the ASSU
Council of Presidents. We offer a
program that will continue
throughout the year and produce
substantial benefits for all
students and responsible reform
of the University.
In the preprimary campaign,
we issued position papers on land
development, R.0.T.C., student
services, special events, graduate
student problems, and funding for
the ASSU. These are sensitive
issues, and we hope that most
students have been able to read
our full statements on the
subjects.
A brief statement of support
for our ticket, with endorsements
from members of the student
body, will be distributed today.
We are anxious to be judged on
the merits of our complete
program because we believe the
ASSU is a complex organization
comprising many fields of
activity. The Association has to
provide leadership on
controversial issues—like builidng
and land preservation; it has to
provide a wide range of
nonpolitical student services from
Course Evaluation to a concert
series.
We hope that students will cast
their ballots for such an ASSU by
voting for Shea, Grant, Mickelson,
and Levin today and Thursday.
