Shoch Endorsement
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to take this
opportunity both to thank my
supporters in the recent primary
and to encourage all students to
vote for John Shoch and Bill
Evers in the Presidential Election
Runoff. My concern in this
campaign has been greater
involvement of individual students
in the ASSU and thus the
establishment of a more powerful
student lobby in university affairs.
It is my fear that the Shea-Grant
ticket would inadvertantly bring
about the death of student
government through bureaucratic
inefficiency, and inaction. There
seems to be an aura of "status
quo" about them. Shoch-Evers,
on the other hand, represent a
genuine effort for student
involvement and power, and most
importantly a stake in our own
destiny and the initiative to
accomplish it. It is absolutely
essential that we have energetic,
innovative leaders now, and I
sincerely urge all students to vote
for John Shoch and Bill Evers for
the ASSU Presidency.
Charles B. Kitsman
Shea Endorsement
Editor, The Daily:
After wading through all of the
position papers of both
presidential tickets, I have
concluded that the team of Shea,
Grant, Mickelson, and Levin
offers the only program of
substantive internal ASSU reform
that Charles Kitsman and I
worked for in our campaign.
Student government can only
be effective in dealing with other
elements of the University if the
organization representing students
has gained the respect of its
members. I feel that this kind of
respect can come from a
comprehensive program of
services to students, a program
which is glaringly absent from the
Shoch-Evers campaign.

No Endorsement
Editor, The Daily:
I have been involved with
several attempts to change the
Stanford curriculum during the
past two years: I worked last year
with the Student Education
Council to abolish University
requirements; with the Academic
Senate floor management team
last summer to present the debate
for establishing a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies; with Pat
Shea, John Grube and the
University Fellows to develop a
credit-granting mechanism more
responsive to student initiative in
the form of the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and
Education; and with Bob Jaffe,
.Joel Primack, Sue Block and

others on SWOPSI in order to
develop a more issue and
action-oriented curriculum than
existed previously.
I list these only to indicate my
background to the following three
conclusions: (1) educational
changes (curricular and structural)
are both needed and possible at
Stanford; (2) such changes will
not occur if left to the faculty;(3)
it takes a good deal of consistent
effort and time to establish such
changes.
None of the ASSU presidential
candidates have convinced me
either of their interest or
commitment to furthering in
concrete terms the vision of David
Harris, or taking the initiative
themselves; several indicated they
would not hinder efforts by
others.
I'm not saying this should be
the primary concern of all the
candidates; but it is one of the
areas in which there is potential
for change next year an area in
which there is much to be done
and filling a position which could
do those things does not mean
that they will be accomplished.
If you are interested
specifically in furthering or
initiating educational change at
Stanford, I would like to invite
you (after casting your ballot) to
call me at x 4331, or call anyone
else already working on
educational changes and perhaps
we can get interested people
together to talk about what can
be done next year.

Editor, The Daily:
The Senior Class presidential
slate of Charlie Combs, Raman
Buhler, Bill Jordan, and Kevin
Porter would like to announce
their strong and wholehearted
support of Dave Velasques, Ford,
Elger, and Cady. Bill and Kevin
know Dave Velasquez very well,
and fell that he would do an
excellent job as Senior Class
president.
We are not supporting the slate
of Crosby, Earle, and Feldmen
because we feel that Dave and his
group are more capable of
handling the office. We urge all
those who voted for us in the
primary to vote for Velasquez,
Ford, Elger, and Cady on Tuesday

"economize" by reducing wage

Buhler, Bill Jordan, and Kevin
Porter would like to announce
their strong and wholehearted
support of Dave Velasques, Ford,
Elger, and Cady. Bill and Kevin
know Dave Velasquez very well,
and fell that he would do an
excellent job as Senior Class
president.
We are not supporting the slate
of Crosby, Earle, and Feldmen
because we feel that Dave and his
group are more capable of
handling the office. We urge all
those who voted for us in the
primary to vote for Velasquez,
Ford, Elger, and Cady on Tuesday

I would like to take this
opportunity both to thank my
supporters in the recent primary
and to encourage all students to
vote for John Shoch and Bill
Evers in the Presidential Election
Runoff. My concern in this
campaign has been greater
involvement of individual students
in the ASSU and thus the
establishment of a more powerful
student lobby in university affairs.
It is my fear that the Shea-Grant
ticket would inadvertantly bring
about the death of student
government through bureaucratic
inefficiency, and inaction. There
seems to be an aura of "status
quo" about them. Shoch-Evers,
on the other hand, represent a
genuine effort for student
involvement and power, and most
importantly a stake in our own
destiny and the initiative to
accomplish it. It is absolutely
essential that we have energetic,
innovative leaders now, and I
sincerely urge all students to vote
for John Shoch and Bill Evers for
the ASSU Presidency.
Charles B. Kitsman
Shea Endorsement
Editor, The Daily:
After wading through all of the
position papers of both
presidential tickets, I have
concluded that the team of Shea,
Grant, Mickelson, and Levin
offers the only program of
substantive internal ASSU reform
that Charles Kitsman and I
worked for in our campaign.
Student government can only
be effective in dealing with other
elements of the University if the
organization representing students
has gained the respect of its
members. I feel that this kind of
respect can come from a
comprehensive program of
services to students, a program
which is glaringly absent from the
Shoch-Evers campaign.

I have been involved with
several attempts to change the
Stanford curriculum during the
past two years: I worked last year
with the Student Education
Council to abolish University
requirements; with the Academic
Senate floor management team
last summer to present the debate
for establishing a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies; with Pat
Shea, John Grube and the
University Fellows to develop a
credit-granting mechanism more
responsive to student initiative in
the form of the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and
Education; and with Bob Jaffe,
.Joel Primack, Sue Block and

others on SWOPSI in order to
develop a more issue and
action-oriented curriculum than
existed previously.
I list these only to indicate my
background to the following three
conclusions: (1) educational
changes (curricular and structural)
are both needed and possible at
Stanford; (2) such changes will
not occur if left to the faculty;(3)
it takes a good deal of consistent
effort and time to establish such
changes.
None of the ASSU presidential
candidates have convinced me
either of their interest or
commitment to furthering in
concrete terms the vision of David
Harris, or taking the initiative
themselves; several indicated they
would not hinder efforts by
others.
I'm not saying this should be
the primary concern of all the
candidates; but it is one of the
areas in which there is potential
for change next year an area in
which there is much to be done
and filling a position which could
do those things does not mean
that they will be accomplished.
If you are interested
specifically in furthering or
initiating educational change at
Stanford, I would like to invite
you (after casting your ballot) to
call me at x 4331, or call anyone
else already working on
educational changes and perhaps
we can get interested people
together to talk about what can
be done next year.

None of the ASSU presidential
candidates have convinced me
either of their interest or
commitment to furthering in
concrete terms the vision of David
Harris, or taking the initiative
themselves; several indicated they
would not hinder efforts by
others.
I'm not saying this should be
the primary concern of all the
candidates; but it is one of the
areas in which there is potential
for change next year an area in
which there is much to be done
and filling a position which could
do those things does not mean
that they will be accomplished.
If you are interested
specifically in furthering or
initiating educational change at
Stanford, I would like to invite
you (after casting your ballot) to
call me at x 4331, or call anyone
else already working on
educational changes and perhaps
we can get interested people
together to talk about what can
be done next year.

Council of Presidents
Editor, The Daily:
The Senior Class presidential
slate of Charlie Combs, Raman
Buhler, Bill Jordan, and Kevin
Porter would like to announce
their strong and wholehearted
support of Dave Velasques, Ford,
Elger, and Cady. Bill and Kevin
know Dave Velasquez very well,
and fell that he would do an
excellent job as Senior Class
president.
We are not supporting the slate
of Crosby, Earle, and Feldmen
because we feel that Dave and his
group are more capable of
handling the office. We urge all
those who voted for us in the
primary to vote for Velasquez,
Ford, Elger, and Cady on Tuesday
Editor, The Daily:
I have read the March 13 issue
of the U.S.E. (United Stanford
Employees) circular. In this I am
quoted as follows: "The following
letter is in response to a talk by
W. Panofsky, SLAC is going to
"economize" by reducing wage
increases.
This quotation is pure
fabrication.
