# Techniques Of Deception
## Smog And Smokescreens 
### Ned Groth 
One local consequence of the
growing "Ecology Movement" has
been a series of full-page
advertisements in Bay Area
newspapers, sponsored by the Bay
Area League of Industrial
Associations (BALIA), the largest
lobby for major industry in this
region.
The announced purpose of the
ads is to "Clear the Air" on
industry's role in causing
pollution. Naturally, the ads tend
to minimize industry's
contribution ("Today it
contributes only 11 percent of the
total"), and brag about progress in
pollution control ("Since 1959,
industry has reduced its air
pollutants by 28.3 percent").
They also try to shift the blame
for smog to cars (70 percent of
"the problem"), to the consumer,
to the explosion,"
and to any other convenient
scapegoat.
Actually, every one of these
statements is grossly misleading,
even if technically true. Together,
they form a clever smokescreen,
designed to distract peoples'
attention and energy away from
real and important causes of air
pollution.
The techniques of deception
are simple. First, all the different
kinds of pollutants in the air are
lumped together into one big
mess, known as "the problem."
Unfortunately, this is like adding
apples and oranges—it can't be
done; all you get is a meaningless
answer. The second trick is to
look at simply the volume of
pollutants emitted, without
considering any of the other
properties of air contaminants —

toxicity, for example—which can
play important roles in
determining the EFFECT of a
given amount of pollution.
Weight Distortion
Lumping things together on a
pure weight basis greatly distorts
the picture of Bay area air
pollution problems. For instance:
two-thirds of all emissions are
carbon monoxide, most of it from
autos; but CO is not very toxic,
and the large amounts emitted
have never caused any problems in
this area.
None of the emissions from
industry compare in volume with
CO from cars; but some industrial
pollutants are highly toxic, and
have caused annoyance or illness
to bay area residents. An example

is sulfur dioxide (SO-2), roughly
100 times as deadly as CO; and 92
percent of it comes from industry.
Industry is also responsible for 43
percent of the airborne dust, and
a substantial share of nitrogen
oxides and organic gases, although
autos are larger sources of these
last two.
When everything is lumped
together, autos come out as big
villains, and industry looks
innocent, with only 11 percent
(by weight) of emissions. But if
each pollutant is treated
separately—as it should
be—industry doesn't get off so
easily.
More Tricks
The same tricks are used to
make the statement "Industry has

reduced its pollutants 28.3
percent." Ten years ago, industrial
emissions amounted to about
1500 tons a day; they are now
down around 1100 tons each day.
But that's with everything lumped
together; what happened with
each pollutant alone?
The biggest drop was in carbon
monoxide emissions; in 1968
ONE new control device in one
(1) plant captured 440 tons of CO
that otherwise would have gone
into the air. Particulate emissions
also have been reduced
substantially since 1959, as the
result of a regulation passed in
1960. But SO-2, hydrocarbons,
and oxides of nitrogen are all
being emitted in larger amounts
now than they were ten years ago;

what's more, the amount has been
gradually increasing for several
years. The most significant
reduction in volume of
pollution—and the one that makes
up the bulk of the "28.3
percent "—was a control over the
last bothersome pollutant of
all—carbon monoxide—on the part
of a SINGLE industry.
So —rather than getting better,
overall pollution is getting worse
in the Bay Area. Who does
industry try to blame it on? You
and me, brother. "Pollution is a
people problem," reads the
BALI A ad. It comes from
"making and consuming the
things more people than ever
want, need, and require."
The Old Excuse ,
It was inevitable that polluters
would try to blame our
environmental problems on
"overpopulation." (And they
aren't even subtle about it; "Did it
all start with Adam?" asks one of
their ads, innocently.) The
population here in the Bay Area
HAS grown significantly in the
last decade or two. So has the
smog. But the cause and effect
relationship isn't that simple.
The number of people has
increased along with, but not
actually caused, both the
tremendous economic growth of
this area and the larger pollution
problems. The primary impetus to
economic growth has been the
perennial need, deeply ingrained
in the corporate mind, to increase
sales and profits year after year.
Turn out more and more products
each year, find a market
somewhere, and your company
will grow. (In this area of the
peninsula, the products are often
the tools of war; and we've seen
what happens when that market
has to keep growing.)
The same imperative to grow
GROW GROW is the fuel that
feeds the fires of consumption.
How much of our industry's
products do we really "want,
need, and require," and how
much is bought with our tax
money, or stuffed down our
throats by means of advertising
and planned obsolescence , or
consumed in any of the other
tricky ways thyeconomy keeps its
wheels spinning?
Profit!!!
The primary objective of all
this mindless consumption is
profit—not for you and me, but
for the guys who run the ads. The
relentless pursuit of profits
employs a technological machine
that is consuming the whole earth
in order to turn out products
which, for the most part, the
earth and the human race would
be better off without. Production
creates wastes; but the control of
those wastes may only serve to
make the whole process of rape
more efficient.
And BALIA h: s the gall to tell
us that this is what we want.
("Industry's goal is to give you all
the things you want—and clean
air,"). Be'lshit. Their rhetoric
stinks worn? than their factories.
There's a bigger moral to this
than "Don't believe everything
you read in a full page ad." Once
we see through the smokescreens,
we perceive that "ecology"
involves issues beyond technology
and population. The most basic
problem of all is our
economic-political system, and
the most important question we
need to answer is how do we turn
it around —or at least turn it
off—before it really IS too late?
If we're lucky, those are the
answers we will be seeking when
Earth Day and all its connected
events have swept through the
Stanford community.

MASKED MEN—Two workers from the Owens-Corning Fibergtas will discuss an usual and dangerous problem—pollution
inside the plant. Workers claim that they must breathe the fiberglas particles and the company has failed to provide better
ventilation. The workers will speak today at noon as part of the Ecology Teach-in.

make the statement "Industry has

reduced its pollutants 28.3
percent." Ten years ago, industrial
emissions amounted to about
1500 tons a day; they are now
down around 1100 tons each day.
But that's with everything lumped
together; what happened with
each pollutant alone?
The biggest drop was in carbon
monoxide emissions; in 1968
ONE new control device in one
(1) plant captured 440 tons of CO
that otherwise would have gone
into the air. Particulate emissions
also have been reduced
substantially since 1959, as the
result of a regulation passed in
1960. But SO-2, hydrocarbons,
and oxides of nitrogen are all
being emitted in larger amounts
now than they were ten years ago;

what's more, the amount has been
gradually increasing for several
years. The most significant
reduction in volume of
pollution—and the one that makes
up the bulk of the "28.3
percent "—was a control over the
last bothersome pollutant of
all—carbon monoxide—on the part
of a SINGLE industry.
So —rather than getting better,
overall pollution is getting worse
in the Bay Area. Who does
industry try to blame it on? You
and me, brother. "Pollution is a
people problem," reads the
BALI A ad. It comes from
"making and consuming the
things more people than ever
want, need, and require."
The Old Excuse ,
It was inevitable that polluters
would try to blame our
environmental problems on
"overpopulation." (And they
aren't even subtle about it; "Did it
all start with Adam?" asks one of
their ads, innocently.) The
population here in the Bay Area
HAS grown significantly in the
last decade or two. So has the
smog. But the cause and effect
relationship isn't that simple.
The number of people has
increased along with, but not
actually caused, both the
tremendous economic growth of
this area and the larger pollution
problems. The primary impetus to
economic growth has been the
perennial need, deeply ingrained
in the corporate mind, to increase
sales and profits year after year.
Turn out more and more products
each year, find a market
somewhere, and your company
will grow. (In this area of the
peninsula, the products are often
the tools of war; and we've seen
what happens when that market
has to keep growing.)
The same imperative to grow
GROW GROW is the fuel that
feeds the fires of consumption.
How much of our industry's
products do we really "want,
need, and require," and how
much is bought with our tax
money, or stuffed down our
throats by means of advertising
and planned obsolescence , or
consumed in any of the other
tricky ways thyeconomy keeps its
wheels spinning?
Profit!!!
The primary objective of all
this mindless consumption is
profit—not for you and me, but
for the guys who run the ads. The
relentless pursuit of profits
employs a technological machine
that is consuming the whole earth
in order to turn out products
which, for the most part, the
earth and the human race would
be better off without. Production
creates wastes; but the control of
those wastes may only serve to
make the whole process of rape
more efficient.
And BALIA h: s the gall to tell
us that this is what we want.
("Industry's goal is to give you all
the things you want—and clean
air,"). Be'lshit. Their rhetoric
stinks worn? than their factories.
There's a bigger moral to this
than "Don't believe everything
you read in a full page ad." Once
we see through the smokescreens,
we perceive that "ecology"
involves issues beyond technology
and population. The most basic
problem of all is our
economic-political system, and
the most important question we
need to answer is how do we turn
it around —or at least turn it
off—before it really IS too late?
If we're lucky, those are the
answers we will be seeking when
Earth Day and all its connected
events have swept through the
Stanford community.

MASKED MEN—Two workers from the Owens-Corning Fibergtas will discuss an usual and dangerous problem—pollution
inside the plant. Workers claim that they must breathe the fiberglas particles and the company has failed to provide better
ventilation. The workers will speak today at noon as part of the Ecology Teach-in.
One local consequence of the
growing "Ecology Movement" has
been a series of full-page
advertisements in Bay Area
newspapers, sponsored by the Bay
Area League of Industrial
Associations (BALIA), the largest
lobby for major industry in this
region.
The announced purpose of the
ads is to "Clear the Air" on
industry's role in causing
pollution. Naturally, the ads tend
to minimize industry's
contribution ("Today it
contributes only 11 percent of the
total"), and brag about progress in
pollution control ("Since 1959,
industry has reduced its air
pollutants by 28.3 percent").
They also try to shift the blame
for smog to cars (70 percent of
"the problem"), to the consumer,
to the explosion,"
and to any other convenient
scapegoat.
Actually, every one of these
statements is grossly misleading,
even if technically true. Together,
they form a clever smokescreen,
designed to distract peoples'
attention and energy away from
real and important causes of air
pollution.
The techniques of deception
are simple. First, all the different
kinds of pollutants in the air are
lumped together into one big
mess, known as "the problem."
Unfortunately, this is like adding
apples and oranges—it can't be
done; all you get is a meaningless
answer. The second trick is to
look at simply the volume of
pollutants emitted, without
considering any of the other
properties of air contaminants —

toxicity, for example—which can
play important roles in
determining the EFFECT of a
given amount of pollution.
Weight Distortion
Lumping things together on a
pure weight basis greatly distorts
the picture of Bay area air
pollution problems. For instance:
two-thirds of all emissions are
carbon monoxide, most of it from
autos; but CO is not very toxic,
and the large amounts emitted
have never caused any problems in
this area.
None of the emissions from
industry compare in volume with
CO from cars; but some industrial
pollutants are highly toxic, and
have caused annoyance or illness
to bay area residents. An example

is sulfur dioxide (SO-2), roughly
100 times as deadly as CO; and 92
percent of it comes from industry.
Industry is also responsible for 43
percent of the airborne dust, and
a substantial share of nitrogen
oxides and organic gases, although
autos are larger sources of these
last two.
When everything is lumped
together, autos come out as big
villains, and industry looks
innocent, with only 11 percent
(by weight) of emissions. But if
each pollutant is treated
separately—as it should
be—industry doesn't get off so
easily.

Profit!!!
The primary objective of all
this mindless consumption is
profit—not for you and me, but
for the guys who run the ads. The
relentless pursuit of profits
employs a technological machine
that is consuming the whole earth
in order to turn out products
which, for the most part, the
earth and the human race would
be better off without. Production
creates wastes; but the control of
those wastes may only serve to
make the whole process of rape
more efficient.

us that this is what we want.
("Industry's goal is to give you all
the things you want—and clean
air,"). Be'lshit. Their rhetoric

There's a bigger moral to this
than "Don't believe everything
you read in a full page ad." Once
we see through the smokescreens,
we perceive that "ecology"
involves issues beyond technology
and population. The most basic
problem of all is our
economic-political system, and
the most important question we
need to answer is how do we turn
it around —or at least turn it
off—before it really IS too late?
If we're lucky, those are the
answers we will be seeking when
Earth Day and all its connected
events have swept through the
Stanford community.

MASKED MEN—Two workers from the Owens-Corning Fibergtas will discuss an usual and dangerous problem—pollution
inside the plant. Workers claim that they must breathe the fiberglas particles and the company has failed to provide better
ventilation. The workers will speak today at noon as part of the Ecology Teach-in.
One local consequence of the
growing "Ecology Movement" has
been a series of full-page
advertisements in Bay Area
newspapers, sponsored by the Bay
Area League of Industrial
Associations (BALIA), the largest
lobby for major industry in this
region.
The announced purpose of the
ads is to "Clear the Air" on
industry's role in causing
pollution. Naturally, the ads tend
to minimize industry's
contribution ("Today it
contributes only 11 percent of the
total"), and brag about progress in
pollution control ("Since 1959,
industry has reduced its air
pollutants by 28.3 percent").
They also try to shift the blame
for smog to cars (70 percent of
"the problem"), to the consumer,
to the explosion,"
and to any other convenient
scapegoat.
Actually, every one of these
statements is grossly misleading,
even if technically true. Together,
they form a clever smokescreen,
designed to distract peoples'
attention and energy away from
real and important causes of air
pollution.
The techniques of deception
are simple. First, all the different
kinds of pollutants in the air are
lumped together into one big
mess, known as "the problem."
Unfortunately, this is like adding
apples and oranges—it can't be
done; all you get is a meaningless
answer. The second trick is to
look at simply the volume of
pollutants emitted, without
considering any of the other
properties of air contaminants —

toxicity, for example—which can
play important roles in
determining the EFFECT of a
given amount of pollution.
Weight Distortion
Lumping things together on a
pure weight basis greatly distorts
the picture of Bay area air
pollution problems. For instance:
two-thirds of all emissions are
carbon monoxide, most of it from
autos; but CO is not very toxic,
and the large amounts emitted
have never caused any problems in
this area.
None of the emissions from
industry compare in volume with
CO from cars; but some industrial
pollutants are highly toxic, and
have caused annoyance or illness
to bay area residents. An example

is sulfur dioxide (SO-2), roughly
100 times as deadly as CO; and 92
percent of it comes from industry.
Industry is also responsible for 43
percent of the airborne dust, and
a substantial share of nitrogen
oxides and organic gases, although
autos are larger sources of these
last two.
When everything is lumped
together, autos come out as big
villains, and industry looks
innocent, with only 11 percent
(by weight) of emissions. But if
each pollutant is treated
separately—as it should
be—industry doesn't get off so
easily.
More Tricks
The same tricks are used to
make the statement "Industry has

reduced its pollutants 28.3
percent." Ten years ago, industrial
emissions amounted to about
1500 tons a day; they are now
down around 1100 tons each day.
But that's with everything lumped
together; what happened with
each pollutant alone?
The biggest drop was in carbon
monoxide emissions; in 1968
ONE new control device in one
(1) plant captured 440 tons of CO
that otherwise would have gone
into the air. Particulate emissions
also have been reduced
substantially since 1959, as the
result of a regulation passed in
1960. But SO-2, hydrocarbons,
and oxides of nitrogen are all
being emitted in larger amounts
now than they were ten years ago;

what's more, the amount has been
gradually increasing for several
years. The most significant
reduction in volume of
pollution—and the one that makes
up the bulk of the "28.3
percent "—was a control over the
last bothersome pollutant of
all—carbon monoxide—on the part
of a SINGLE industry.
So —rather than getting better,
overall pollution is getting worse
in the Bay Area. Who does
industry try to blame it on? You
and me, brother. "Pollution is a
people problem," reads the
BALI A ad. It comes from
"making and consuming the
things more people than ever
want, need, and require."
The Old Excuse ,
It was inevitable that polluters
would try to blame our
environmental problems on
"overpopulation." (And they
aren't even subtle about it; "Did it
all start with Adam?" asks one of
their ads, innocently.) The
population here in the Bay Area
HAS grown significantly in the
last decade or two. So has the
smog. But the cause and effect
relationship isn't that simple.
The number of people has
increased along with, but not
actually caused, both the
tremendous economic growth of
this area and the larger pollution
problems. The primary impetus to
economic growth has been the
perennial need, deeply ingrained
in the corporate mind, to increase
sales and profits year after year.
Turn out more and more products
each year, find a market
somewhere, and your company
will grow. (In this area of the
peninsula, the products are often
the tools of war; and we've seen
what happens when that market
has to keep growing.)
The same imperative to grow
GROW GROW is the fuel that
feeds the fires of consumption.
How much of our industry's
products do we really "want,
need, and require," and how
much is bought with our tax
money, or stuffed down our
throats by means of advertising
and planned obsolescence , or
consumed in any of the other
tricky ways thyeconomy keeps its
wheels spinning?

are simple. First, all the different
kinds of pollutants in the air are
lumped together into one big
mess, known as "the problem."
Unfortunately, this is like adding
apples and oranges—it can't be
done; all you get is a meaningless
answer. The second trick is to
look at simply the volume of
pollutants emitted, without
considering any of the other
properties of air contaminants —

toxicity, for example—which can
play important roles in
determining the EFFECT of a
given amount of pollution.
Weight Distortion
Lumping things together on a
pure weight basis greatly distorts
the picture of Bay area air
pollution problems. For instance:
two-thirds of all emissions are
carbon monoxide, most of it from
autos; but CO is not very toxic,
and the large amounts emitted
have never caused any problems in
this area.
None of the emissions from
industry compare in volume with
CO from cars; but some industrial
pollutants are highly toxic, and
have caused annoyance or illness
to bay area residents. An example

is sulfur dioxide (SO-2), roughly
100 times as deadly as CO; and 92
percent of it comes from industry.
Industry is also responsible for 43
percent of the airborne dust, and
a substantial share of nitrogen
oxides and organic gases, although
autos are larger sources of these
last two.
When everything is lumped
together, autos come out as big
villains, and industry looks
innocent, with only 11 percent
(by weight) of emissions. But if
each pollutant is treated
separately—as it should
be—industry doesn't get off so
easily.
More Tricks
The same tricks are used to
make the statement "Industry has

reduced its pollutants 28.3
percent." Ten years ago, industrial
emissions amounted to about
1500 tons a day; they are now
down around 1100 tons each day.
But that's with everything lumped
together; what happened with
each pollutant alone?
The biggest drop was in carbon
monoxide emissions; in 1968
ONE new control device in one
(1) plant captured 440 tons of CO
that otherwise would have gone
into the air. Particulate emissions
also have been reduced
substantially since 1959, as the
result of a regulation passed in
1960. But SO-2, hydrocarbons,
and oxides of nitrogen are all
being emitted in larger amounts
now than they were ten years ago;

what's more, the amount has been
gradually increasing for several
years. The most significant
reduction in volume of
pollution—and the one that makes
up the bulk of the "28.3
percent "—was a control over the
last bothersome pollutant of
all—carbon monoxide—on the part
of a SINGLE industry.
So —rather than getting better,
overall pollution is getting worse
in the Bay Area. Who does
industry try to blame it on? You
and me, brother. "Pollution is a
people problem," reads the
BALI A ad. It comes from
"making and consuming the
things more people than ever
want, need, and require."
The Old Excuse ,
It was inevitable that polluters
would try to blame our
environmental problems on
"overpopulation." (And they
aren't even subtle about it; "Did it
all start with Adam?" asks one of
their ads, innocently.) The
population here in the Bay Area
HAS grown significantly in the
last decade or two. So has the
smog. But the cause and effect
relationship isn't that simple.
The number of people has
increased along with, but not
actually caused, both the
tremendous economic growth of
this area and the larger pollution
problems. The primary impetus to
economic growth has been the
perennial need, deeply ingrained
in the corporate mind, to increase
sales and profits year after year.
Turn out more and more products
each year, find a market
somewhere, and your company
will grow. (In this area of the
peninsula, the products are often
the tools of war; and we've seen
what happens when that market
has to keep growing.)
The same imperative to grow
GROW GROW is the fuel that
feeds the fires of consumption.
How much of our industry's
products do we really "want,
need, and require," and how
much is bought with our tax
money, or stuffed down our
throats by means of advertising
and planned obsolescence , or
consumed in any of the other
tricky ways thyeconomy keeps its
wheels spinning?
Profit!!!
The primary objective of all
this mindless consumption is
profit—not for you and me, but
for the guys who run the ads. The
relentless pursuit of profits
employs a technological machine
that is consuming the whole earth
in order to turn out products
which, for the most part, the
earth and the human race would
be better off without. Production
creates wastes; but the control of
those wastes may only serve to
make the whole process of rape
more efficient.
And BALIA h: s the gall to tell
us that this is what we want.
("Industry's goal is to give you all
the things you want—and clean
air,"). Be'lshit. Their rhetoric
stinks worn? than their factories.
There's a bigger moral to this
than "Don't believe everything
you read in a full page ad." Once
we see through the smokescreens,
we perceive that "ecology"
involves issues beyond technology
and population. The most basic
problem of all is our
economic-political system, and
the most important question we
need to answer is how do we turn
it around —or at least turn it
off—before it really IS too late?
If we're lucky, those are the
answers we will be seeking when
Earth Day and all its connected
events have swept through the
Stanford community.

MASKED MEN—Two workers from the Owens-Corning Fibergtas will discuss an usual and dangerous problem—pollution
inside the plant. Workers claim that they must breathe the fiberglas particles and the company has failed to provide better
ventilation. The workers will speak today at noon as part of the Ecology Teach-in.
