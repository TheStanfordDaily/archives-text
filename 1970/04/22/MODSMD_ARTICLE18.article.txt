# Vietnam, Ecology, And Racism
## 
### Prof. Paul Ehrlich 
(The following is the text of a
speech being given today by Paul
R. Ehrlieh, professor of
population biology, at Bowling
Green State University, Bowling
Green, Ohio.)
The Vietnam War and Racism
are both involved in the
pop u 1 a tion-resou rce-environment
crisis. Any politician who thinks
that the ecological movement will
attract students away from those
sticky issues is living in a dream
world.
A major determinant of U.S.
foreign policy around the world is
the need for cheap raw materials
to svipply our industries. Like
most of the other overdeveloped
countries we are resource poor. In
order to keep our wasteful
economic system going, we are, in
essence, stealing natural resources
from our children and from the
poor people of the world.
Our children can do nothing
about it, but the other people of
the world might be able to.
Therefore, it helps to be strong
militarily if we wish to compete
with other overdeveloped
countries, such as those of
Western Europe, the Soviet
Union, and Japan, in a game of
global thievery.
In an unprecedented atrocity
the United States is murdering the
people of Vietnam and destroying
the ecology of that country
primarily to protect American
interests in the natural resources
of Southeast Asia. Hitler may
have been a much more efficient
and heartless murderer, but he
lacked the technology—especially
the herbicides- "with which we
have been destroying the
environmental fabric of Vietnam.
There will be more
intervention by overdeveloped

countries in response to real or
imagined threats to their
monopoly on the material basis of
affluence. Squabbling about
ecological disasters will also
increase, and small wars will
become more and more common.
Sooner or later they will lead to
the thermonuclear war that is
being prepared for so vigorously
by scientists who have sold their
souls to the military-industrial
complexes of their countries.

Racism is involved in the crisis
in a different way. We cannot
expect members of minorities, or
the poor, or any other group
which is not given a fair shake in
our society to cooperate in an
effort to save our
civilization —unless we can make it
their civilization, too. The same
goes for the poor and non-white
nations of the world. Unless we
make it clear that the rewards of
saving the world will be honestly

shared, they would be stupid to
cooperate with us.
Equity, Peace, Etc.
The battle to save our planet is
not just a battle for population
control and environmental sanity.
It is also a battle against
exploitation, against war, and
against racism. That is, it is a
battle for equity, peace, and
justice—without which the world
would hardly be worth saving!

environmental fabric of Vietnam.
There will be more
intervention by overdeveloped

countries in response to real or
imagined threats to their
monopoly on the material basis of
affluence. Squabbling about
ecological disasters will also
increase, and small wars will
become more and more common.
Sooner or later they will lead to
the thermonuclear war that is
being prepared for so vigorously
by scientists who have sold their
souls to the military-industrial
complexes of their countries.

Racism is involved in the crisis
in a different way. We cannot
expect members of minorities, or
the poor, or any other group
which is not given a fair shake in
our society to cooperate in an
effort to save our
civilization —unless we can make it
their civilization, too. The same
goes for the poor and non-white
nations of the world. Unless we
make it clear that the rewards of
saving the world will be honestly

shared, they would be stupid to
cooperate with us.
Equity, Peace, Etc.
The battle to save our planet is
not just a battle for population
control and environmental sanity.
It is also a battle against
exploitation, against war, and
against racism. That is, it is a
battle for equity, peace, and
justice—without which the world
would hardly be worth saving!
(The following is the text of a
speech being given today by Paul
R. Ehrlieh, professor of
population biology, at Bowling
Green State University, Bowling
Green, Ohio.)
The Vietnam War and Racism
are both involved in the
pop u 1 a tion-resou rce-environment
crisis. Any politician who thinks
that the ecological movement will
attract students away from those
sticky issues is living in a dream
world.
A major determinant of U.S.
foreign policy around the world is
the need for cheap raw materials
to svipply our industries. Like
most of the other overdeveloped
countries we are resource poor. In
order to keep our wasteful
economic system going, we are, in
essence, stealing natural resources
from our children and from the
poor people of the world.
Our children can do nothing
about it, but the other people of
the world might be able to.
Therefore, it helps to be strong
militarily if we wish to compete
with other overdeveloped
countries, such as those of
Western Europe, the Soviet
Union, and Japan, in a game of
global thievery.
In an unprecedented atrocity
the United States is murdering the
people of Vietnam and destroying
the ecology of that country
primarily to protect American
interests in the natural resources
of Southeast Asia. Hitler may
have been a much more efficient
and heartless murderer, but he
lacked the technology—especially
the herbicides- "with which we
have been destroying the
environmental fabric of Vietnam.
