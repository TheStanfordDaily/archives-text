# Some Necessary Action
## 
### Prof. John Thomas 
I doubt that any rational and informed person
can argue that there is not a human population
and environmental problem in the world today.
The facts are well known and thoroughly
documented. Not only is there a problem, but it is
severe and can be expected to get worse—unless
action is taken now.
No one at this point in time knows exactly
what all of the courses of action we must take are.
But there are a number of things we must do and
there are a number of traps we should avoid. Some
of these follow.
Fundamental to the solution of the population
and environmental deterioration problem is the
need to stabilize the human population as close to
the present 3.6 billion as soon as possible. And in
the long run, this size may well be too large. In
this country we need: 1, a national population
stabilization policy and goal; 2, vast expansion in
private and public birth control services, including
voluntary sterilization; 3. repeal of all abortion
laws; 4, a tax structure which in no way
encourages population increase; 5, tax incentives
for smaller families; and 6, if the above fail,
compulsory family limitation.
No Simple Solutions
We must keep in mind that there are no simple
solutions to complex problems and we should
expect none. Not all solutions will help in all
situations and some solutions in some parts of the

world may be unfortunate, i.e., starvation and
disease.
Science and technology will be needed to help
solve our problems. They must be used as
creatively and imaginatively as possible, but a
blind faith that they alone will get us out of our
dilemmas is as futile as believing that God will do
this for us. We should keep in mind that although
we need more research, we should never use this as
a reason for avoiding responsible action now!
A ttitude Change
Attitude change is most important. Our ideas
and beliefs and notions toward our political,
economic, social, and moral systems need to be
changed. We may have to create many more
regional, supragovernmental agencies and
commissions. We need a steady state economy, not
one based on continued growth, especially
population growth. Our ideas about consumption
and waste have to be changed. Social justice must
be a reality, not just an idea. Our concept of our
place in nature is completely outmoded and
should be changed. We must cooperate wilh
nature, not try to conquer and control it. Our
concepts of our reproductive rights need altering.
Two children per family in the United States and
elsewhere may be one to many for the next several
decades and perhaps longer.

creatively and imaginatively as possible, but a
blind faith that they alone will get us out of our
dilemmas is as futile as believing that God will do
this for us. We should keep in mind that although
we need more research, we should never use this as
a reason for avoiding responsible action now!
A ttitude Change
Attitude change is most important. Our ideas
and beliefs and notions toward our political,
economic, social, and moral systems need to be
changed. We may have to create many more
regional, supragovernmental agencies and
commissions. We need a steady state economy, not
one based on continued growth, especially
population growth. Our ideas about consumption
and waste have to be changed. Social justice must
be a reality, not just an idea. Our concept of our
place in nature is completely outmoded and
should be changed. We must cooperate wilh
nature, not try to conquer and control it. Our
concepts of our reproductive rights need altering.

elsewhere may be one to many for the next several
decades and perhaps longer.

I doubt that any rational and informed person
can argue that there is not a human population
and environmental problem in the world today.
The facts are well known and thoroughly
documented. Not only is there a problem, but it is
severe and can be expected to get worse—unless
action is taken now.
No one at this point in time knows exactly
what all of the courses of action we must take are.
But there are a number of things we must do and
there are a number of traps we should avoid. Some
of these follow.
Fundamental to the solution of the population
and environmental deterioration problem is the
need to stabilize the human population as close to
the present 3.6 billion as soon as possible. And in
the long run, this size may well be too large. In
this country we need: 1, a national population
stabilization policy and goal; 2, vast expansion in
private and public birth control services, including
voluntary sterilization; 3. repeal of all abortion
laws; 4, a tax structure which in no way
encourages population increase; 5, tax incentives
for smaller families; and 6, if the above fail,
compulsory family limitation.
No Simple Solutions
We must keep in mind that there are no simple
solutions to complex problems and we should
expect none. Not all solutions will help in all
situations and some solutions in some parts of the

world may be unfortunate, i.e., starvation and
disease.
Science and technology will be needed to help
solve our problems. They must be used as
creatively and imaginatively as possible, but a
blind faith that they alone will get us out of our
dilemmas is as futile as believing that God will do
this for us. We should keep in mind that although
we need more research, we should never use this as
a reason for avoiding responsible action now!
