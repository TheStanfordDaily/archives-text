# Realistic Tactics
## Persuasion And Legal Action 
### Brendon Lynch 
In the current debate over the
ecological crisis and the
intrasigence of polluters, we often
hear the exciting words of
revolution. Change can only come
from the top, we are told; we
must raise not only issues but our
fists. Are these serious proposals
for immediate violent tactics?
Clearly not. For whatever one's
opinions of the morality of the
"establishment," one must respect
its overwhelming strength.
What effect, then, is this loose
talk apt to have. At a time when
high government officials talk
openly of bloodbaths, and of
discarding dissenters like so many
rotten apples, and when a
nation-wide poll shows that there
is little popular support for basic
constitutional rights, especially
Free Speech, and when the mood
of the country is one of
frustration and malaise, such
bombast is not likely to induce
progress. Rather, it is apt to bring
about not only stronger resistance
to change, but the serious
curtailment of the fundamental
rights of all of us as well.
If threatening violence and
rebellion is not a realistic course,
then what alternatives are open to
us? We can start, as Margaret
Mead advises us, by frankly
accepting the fact that we as
consumers are partly to blame for
the deterioration of the
environment.

Instead of exonerating
ourselves by projecting all the
blame on industry, we can start to
establish by our own example a
model of sensible ecological living
(recycling paper, aluminum &
glass, limiting our energy
consumption, abstaining from the
use of products destructive to the
air and water). Then we can
proselytize others to adopt this
new life style.
Where Called For
This is not to counsel
meekness. Boycotting, picketing,
and other action may be taken
where called for. Sit-ins and other
techniques used in the civil rights
movement may also find
application. But acts of violence
and threats of violence should be
rejected.
Beneath the tactics, deep
cultural changes must be made.
Norms and values that teach
man's preeminence over nature
and encourage his exploitation of
it must be replaced with new ones
that emphasize his communion
with and dependence on nature,
and encourage him to protect and
preserve it. But these new values
cannot, as some suggest, be
imposed from the top. They can
only be developed from within.
Like the rest of the
"establishment," the legal system
has not escaped castigation for its
role in this country's exploitative
history. And indeed, it has by and

large been attuned to the needs of
our expanding "cowboy"
economy. Doubtless, some of its
substantive doctrines will have to
be changed to take account of the
new reality. But in its basic
functions of arbitrating conflicts
and implementing policies, the
legal system must and will endure.
Legal Means
Many of the environmental
problems will have to be resolved
in the courts. Exploiters must be
enjoined from continuing their
exploitation. Polluters must be
forced to make restitution to
those who land, air, or water they
have polluted.
Unfortunately, unlike the civil
rights lawyer, for example, the
environmental lawyer lacks a firm
constitutional basis upon which to
build his cases. Common law
doctrines have been of some
limited use, but it seems likely
that much of the legal
groundwork for environmental
suits will have to be laid by the
legislatures.
The first legal tools the
environmental lawyer needs are
adequate procedural devices:
standing for concerned citizens
and groups to get into court;
jurisdiction for the courts over
environmental issues; broad
review powers for the courts over
the actions and decisions of
government agencies.
Two bills that would begin to
provide such procedural tools are
now before the California
Legislature: Assembly Bill 1311
introduced by Assemblyman
Hayes, and Senate Bill 660
introduced by Sen. Mascone.
Both deserve the attention and
consideration of all who are
concerned with out environment.
(Other important environmental
legislation now pending in
Sacramento is discussed by
Heimbegner and Dolezel in the
Teach-in edition of Cross
Currents.)
Specialized Talent
Another essential requirement
for winning environmental battles
in the courts is that an adequate
supply of specialized legal talent
be provided. What is needed is a
core of environmental public
defenders, possibly patterned
after the ACLU or the Legal
Defense Fund of the NAACP.
Organizations of this kind are now
being started on both the East and
West Coasts, but much more is
needed.
Lawyers alone cannot resolve
the environmental crisis.
Ecologists, architects and
planners, engineers, economists,
and perhaps most important in
the long run, philosophers, all
have a contribution to make. Most
important of all is the attitude of
all of us.
We can speed the adoption of
needed reforms in the system and
the development of new values in

our society if we repudiate
emotionally satisfying but
counterproductive tactics and
embrace instead the only effective
techniques at our disposal,
persuasive ones. If, however, we
persist in raising our fists, we will
only succeed in bringing down the
heavy hand of oppression on all of
us.
