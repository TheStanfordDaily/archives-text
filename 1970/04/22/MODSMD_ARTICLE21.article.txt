America
You must have been beautiful
Occasionally I can catch a glimpse
through the dark shadow that
covers you now
and see the sunshine and the
truth.
You must have been beautiful
America
With your rugged mountains and
vast plains
and clear, clear blue waters and
open skies
Nature's people, Indians, living
and loving
and struggling upon your
magnificent stage
But that state is crowded now
and the dust covers the colors
and the filth fills the waters
and the sky is dying
Vicious rats claw through the
garbage
and frighten the little children
The children cry out
But rats are hungry and feed on
fear
And as the children grow
We grew aware that a change must
come.
Not by choice but by force
It is not a dream it is a plan
America
We are your children
And we've come to kill the rats.
