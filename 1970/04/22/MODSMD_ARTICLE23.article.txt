# Engineer's Approach
## On The Control Of The Environment 
### Prof. Rolf Eliassen 
My field of environmental
engineering has as its objectives
the application of scientific and
engineering principles to the
control of the air, land and water
environment for the health and
welfare of mankind. This is urban
ecology — the interrelationship
between man and the air, land,
and water environmental systems
in which he lives. Our basic
philosophy is one of hope;
something can be done to
engineer systems for a better
environment.

Air pollution is considered one
ot the most serious threats to
man's environment. Air knows no
state or national boundary, nor
can the effects of contaminated
air be limited to the source itself.
People mustbreathe the misture of
air as it comes to them — 35
pounds for the average person
each day. Into the air over the
United States is being poured
about 200 million tons of
pollutants each year from motor
vehicles, industries, power plants,
the heating of buildings and the

burning of solid wastes. And the
amount is increasing each year at
an alarming rate! Physical,
chemical, and biological damages
from air pollution lead to social
costs measured in billions of
dollars yearly. Damage to
agriculture, to structures and
materials, the obscuration of
sunlight and other esthetic effects,
and the shortening of the life-span
of man through emphysema,
bronchitis, lung cancer and other
diseases should be signals to the
populace that constructive action
must be taken on a national and
international scale.
Plentiful electric power is a
vital phase of providing for the
environment of living. Power
generating capacities in the U.S.
will increase from 325 million KW
in 1970 to an estimated 1,500
million KW in the year 2000. The
latter forecast includes a
generation capacity of almost
1,000 million KW from nuclear
power plants. One of the
advantages of the nuclear reactor
is that it has tremendous
possibilities for air pollution
control. There is less biologically
effective radioactivity given off
from a nuclear-powered reactor
than from a coal-fired furnace
because of the radioactivity in
coal; other pollutants are also
eliminated, such as carbon
dioxide, oxides of nitrogen,
particulate matter, and so many
other pollutants in power plant
stacks.
parts of the Southwest, including
Texas, Arizona and California.
Great water projects have been
built to transmit mountain water
hundreds of miles to desert areas
of the West. Along the Atlantic,
Gulf and Pacific coasts engineers
can resort to the desalting of sea
water. Distillation is a proven
process, but it costs more than
providing the usual surface or
ground water supplies.
Reclamation of municipal waste
waters is also feasible from the
technological standpoint; it is
being used to reclaim tens of
millions of gallons of water each
day in Southern California where
once-used water is too precious to
throw away. Industry is already

using extensive quantities of
reclaimed waste waters for cooling
and other purposes as part of their
water conservation programs.
Water pollution control is
another phase of environment
control — the conservation and
preservation of the quality of
water resources for the welfare of
man. Industry helps to develop
cities, which in turn produce more
pollution. Conservationists,
ecologists, and just plain citizens
are up in arms — and so is the
Congress. It has been estimated
that over the next six years,
expenditures for treatment plant
construction for municipal and
industrial waste waters in this
country should be $23 billion in
order to stop water degradation
by pollution and start
enhancement of the quality of
lakes, rivers, and tidal estuaries.
The technology is known; money
is the key! We have a long way to
go, and students can be a vital
part of the team to make it go by
putting "people pressure" in the
right places. President Nixon felt
these pressures when he switched
to thee vironmental
"bandwagon" in his recent "State
of the Union" message.
The Land Environment
The land environment is so
greatly affected by the disposal of
solid waste; cities all over the
country are in trouble. Urban
waste production exceeds 1
billion pounds a day in the U.S.
What are we going to do with
this? We must cut down quantities
of non-returnable plastics and
bottles and start huge salvage and
recycling programs. Our resources
are not unlimited! Agricultural,
mining and industrial solid wastes

bring the total solid waste
production this country to 3.65
billion tons a year.
Demographers are predicting
that four immense metropolitan
regions will exist by the year
2000, the outgrowth and
coalescence of cities along the
North Atlantic Seaboard, the
Lower Great Lakes, Florida, and
California.
The answer lies in the creation
of new cities away from current
metropolitan centers. These cities
must take into account the
availability of adequate air
resources and provide policies for
the management of all natural
resources.
Summary
Intelligent management of our
air, water, and land environment
is feasible. Control legislation is
being enacted at an acdelerating
pace by all levels of government in
the U.S. to apply increasing
pressures on municipalities and
industries. The technology of
pollution control is well
established and is being developed
to a higher degree through
cooperative industrial-government
research. The public must be
willing to pay higher prices for
products and higher taxes for
these services; they must continue
to put pressure on their elected
governmental officials for
restrictive legislation and rigid
enforcement of pollution control
laws. This country must learn to
adopt new industrial and power
generation processes, new modes
of transportation.

that over the next six years,
expenditures for treatment plant
construction for municipal and
industrial waste waters in this
country should be $23 billion in
order to stop water degradation
by pollution and start
enhancement of the quality of
lakes, rivers, and tidal estuaries.

The Land Environment
The land environment is so
greatly affected by the disposal of
solid waste; cities all over the
country are in trouble. Urban
waste production exceeds 1
billion pounds a day in the U.S.
What are we going to do with
this? We must cut down quantities
of non-returnable plastics and
bottles and start huge salvage and
recycling programs. Our resources
are not unlimited! Agricultural,
mining and industrial solid wastes

bring the total solid waste
production this country to 3.65
billion tons a year.
Demographers are predicting
that four immense metropolitan
regions will exist by the year
2000, the outgrowth and
coalescence of cities along the
North Atlantic Seaboard, the
Lower Great Lakes, Florida, and
California.
The answer lies in the creation
of new cities away from current
metropolitan centers. These cities
must take into account the
availability of adequate air
resources and provide policies for
the management of all natural
resources.
Summary
Intelligent management of our
air, water, and land environment
is feasible. Control legislation is
being enacted at an acdelerating
pace by all levels of government in
the U.S. to apply increasing
pressures on municipalities and
industries. The technology of
pollution control is well
established and is being developed
to a higher degree through
cooperative industrial-government
research. The public must be
willing to pay higher prices for
products and higher taxes for
these services; they must continue
to put pressure on their elected
governmental officials for
restrictive legislation and rigid
enforcement of pollution control
laws. This country must learn to
adopt new industrial and power
generation processes, new modes
of transportation.

My field of environmental
engineering has as its objectives
the application of scientific and
engineering principles to the
control of the air, land and water
environment for the health and
welfare of mankind. This is urban
ecology — the interrelationship
between man and the air, land,
and water environmental systems
in which he lives. Our basic
philosophy is one of hope;
something can be done to
engineer systems for a better
environment.

Air pollution is considered one
ot the most serious threats to
man's environment. Air knows no
state or national boundary, nor
can the effects of contaminated
air be limited to the source itself.
People mustbreathe the misture of
air as it comes to them — 35
pounds for the average person
each day. Into the air over the
United States is being poured
about 200 million tons of
pollutants each year from motor
vehicles, industries, power plants,
the heating of buildings and the

burning of solid wastes. And the
amount is increasing each year at
an alarming rate! Physical,
chemical, and biological damages
from air pollution lead to social
costs measured in billions of
dollars yearly. Damage to
agriculture, to structures and
materials, the obscuration of
sunlight and other esthetic effects,
and the shortening of the life-span
of man through emphysema,
bronchitis, lung cancer and other
diseases should be signals to the
populace that constructive action
must be taken on a national and
international scale.
Plentiful electric power is a
vital phase of providing for the
environment of living. Power
generating capacities in the U.S.
will increase from 325 million KW
in 1970 to an estimated 1,500
million KW in the year 2000. The
latter forecast includes a
generation capacity of almost
1,000 million KW from nuclear
power plants. One of the
advantages of the nuclear reactor
is that it has tremendous
possibilities for air pollution
control. There is less biologically
effective radioactivity given off
from a nuclear-powered reactor
than from a coal-fired furnace
because of the radioactivity in
coal; other pollutants are also
eliminated, such as carbon
dioxide, oxides of nitrogen,
particulate matter, and so many
other pollutants in power plant
stacks.

Texas, Arizona and California.
Great water projects have been
built to transmit mountain water
hundreds of miles to desert areas
of the West. Along the Atlantic,
Gulf and Pacific coasts engineers
can resort to the desalting of sea
water. Distillation is a proven
process, but it costs more than
providing the usual surface or
ground water supplies.
Reclamation of municipal waste
waters is also feasible from the
technological standpoint; it is
being used to reclaim tens of
millions of gallons of water each
day in Southern California where
once-used water is too precious to
throw away. Industry is already

using extensive quantities of
reclaimed waste waters for cooling
and other purposes as part of their
water conservation programs.
Water pollution control is
another phase of environment
control — the conservation and
preservation of the quality of
water resources for the welfare of
man. Industry helps to develop
cities, which in turn produce more
pollution. Conservationists,
ecologists, and just plain citizens

amount is increasing each year at
an alarming rate! Physical,
chemical, and biological damages
from air pollution lead to social
costs measured in billions of
dollars yearly. Damage to
agriculture, to structures and
materials, the obscuration of
sunlight and other esthetic effects,
and the shortening of the life-span
of man through emphysema,
bronchitis, lung cancer and other
diseases should be signals to the
populace that constructive action
must be taken on a national and
international scale.
Plentiful electric power is a
vital phase of providing for the
environment of living. Power
generating capacities in the U.S.
will increase from 325 million KW
in 1970 to an estimated 1,500
million KW in the year 2000. The
latter forecast includes a
generation capacity of almost
1,000 million KW from nuclear
power plants. One of the
advantages of the nuclear reactor
is that it has tremendous
possibilities for air pollution
control. There is less biologically
effective radioactivity given off
from a nuclear-powered reactor
than from a coal-fired furnace
because of the radioactivity in
coal; other pollutants are also
eliminated, such as carbon
dioxide, oxides of nitrogen,
particulate matter, and so many
other pollutants in power plant
stacks.
parts of the Southwest, including
Texas, Arizona and California.
Great water projects have been
built to transmit mountain water
hundreds of miles to desert areas
of the West. Along the Atlantic,
Gulf and Pacific coasts engineers
can resort to the desalting of sea
water. Distillation is a proven
process, but it costs more than
providing the usual surface or
ground water supplies.
Reclamation of municipal waste
waters is also feasible from the
technological standpoint; it is
being used to reclaim tens of
millions of gallons of water each
day in Southern California where
once-used water is too precious to
throw away. Industry is already

using extensive quantities of
reclaimed waste waters for cooling
and other purposes as part of their
water conservation programs.
Water pollution control is
another phase of environment
control — the conservation and
preservation of the quality of
water resources for the welfare of
man. Industry helps to develop
cities, which in turn produce more
pollution. Conservationists,
ecologists, and just plain citizens
are up in arms — and so is the
Congress. It has been estimated
that over the next six years,
expenditures for treatment plant
construction for municipal and
industrial waste waters in this
country should be $23 billion in
order to stop water degradation
by pollution and start
enhancement of the quality of
lakes, rivers, and tidal estuaries.
The technology is known; money
is the key! We have a long way to
go, and students can be a vital
part of the team to make it go by
putting "people pressure" in the
right places. President Nixon felt
these pressures when he switched
to thee vironmental
"bandwagon" in his recent "State
of the Union" message.
The Land Environment
The land environment is so
greatly affected by the disposal of
solid waste; cities all over the
country are in trouble. Urban
waste production exceeds 1
billion pounds a day in the U.S.
What are we going to do with
this? We must cut down quantities
of non-returnable plastics and
bottles and start huge salvage and
recycling programs. Our resources
are not unlimited! Agricultural,
mining and industrial solid wastes

bring the total solid waste
production this country to 3.65
billion tons a year.
Demographers are predicting
that four immense metropolitan
regions will exist by the year
2000, the outgrowth and
coalescence of cities along the
North Atlantic Seaboard, the
Lower Great Lakes, Florida, and
California.
The answer lies in the creation
of new cities away from current
metropolitan centers. These cities
must take into account the
availability of adequate air
resources and provide policies for
the management of all natural
resources.
Summary
Intelligent management of our
air, water, and land environment
is feasible. Control legislation is
being enacted at an acdelerating
pace by all levels of government in
the U.S. to apply increasing
pressures on municipalities and
industries. The technology of
pollution control is well
established and is being developed
to a higher degree through
cooperative industrial-government
research. The public must be
willing to pay higher prices for
products and higher taxes for
these services; they must continue
to put pressure on their elected
governmental officials for
restrictive legislation and rigid
enforcement of pollution control
laws. This country must learn to
adopt new industrial and power
generation processes, new modes
of transportation.

My field of environmental
engineering has as its objectives
the application of scientific and
engineering principles to the
control of the air, land and water
environment for the health and
welfare of mankind. This is urban
ecology — the interrelationship
between man and the air, land,
and water environmental systems
in which he lives. Our basic
philosophy is one of hope;
something can be done to
engineer systems for a better
environment.

Air pollution is considered one
ot the most serious threats to
man's environment. Air knows no
state or national boundary, nor
can the effects of contaminated
air be limited to the source itself.
People mustbreathe the misture of
air as it comes to them — 35
pounds for the average person
each day. Into the air over the
United States is being poured
about 200 million tons of
pollutants each year from motor
vehicles, industries, power plants,
the heating of buildings and the

burning of solid wastes. And the
amount is increasing each year at
an alarming rate! Physical,
