## It Wasn't A Game 
### 
I would like to take issue with some of the statements made by
Larry Diamond in his "news" feature about Isla Vista. I feel he
made some exaggerations which could lead to misunderstandings. I
am Larry's room-mate, and I shared all but about 2 hours of his
experiences in Santa Barbara.
He states," ... shots rang out for what seemed an eternity."
Tragically one of those shots was not tear gas, and Keven Moran is
dead. But it is hard to say how much sniping was going on. I
personally don't know, and neither does Larry. The general feeling
seemed to be that most of the shots were the police firing tear gas.
Isla Vista was not a war zone, and it was relatively easy to get away
from the riots on Friday night if you wanted to.
"Fires raged thoughout the once quiet college community," is
true, if you consider several blocks the entire community, or a
trash can fire "raging". There was a good deal of fire in front of the
Bank of America, including an old, $15 car purchased for that
purpose. The bank was set afire, and a leather goods shop was
burned. But the fires weren't running uncontrolled through the
community.
The latter half of Larry's article comes across as a discription of
a police state with "pigs" running around hitting people
indescriminately. The fact of the matter is that a person was killed
on Friday before the police could do anything about it. Saturday,
there was a 6 p.m. curfew. Anybody walking the streets during
those hours was subject to harrassment and arrest.
Drinking A&W
The curfew and police action definately affected anybody who
was on the streets Saturday night. But during the day you could
bask on the beaches, cruise by the center of the disturbances, or
drink your A&W. During the night, the majority of the students
stayed buttoned-up in their dorms or apartments. Instead of fear,
they felt incredulity that they could possibly have been told to
stay inside on a Saturday night.
In short, Isla Vista is not a center of revolution. Rather, it is a
place where some of the students are rioting while the rest watch
and discuss. It was very reminiscent of the situation here at
Stanford a week-and-a-half ago. Most of the people consider it a
game. But in Isla Vista a student has died, and for him it wasn't a
game.
