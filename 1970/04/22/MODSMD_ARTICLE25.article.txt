# Drug Survey: Part II
## Narc On Campus 
### Jeff Blum 
(This is a continuation of
yesterday's article on the survey
of drug dealers on campus. The
survey is being conducted by
Richard Blum and Jean Paul
Smith, both experienced members
of the federal narcotics control
establishment. Yesterday's article
reviewed their questionaire and
showed how it could be used to
improve the efficiency of law
enforcement.)
If we can believe what law
enforcement officials have been
saying: that the drug problem
must be handled by focusing
- attention on the dealers and the
sources of supply rather than on
the multitudes of users, and if
Blum's statement that "nobody
knows anything about drug
dealers" is true, then this research
could be of tremendous value to
law enforcement agencies trying
to construct a rational, "humane"
and effective policy. Blum agrees
that this study can be used to
construct a more efficient policy
for controlling drugs.
Eliot Ness
Coupled with the recent
legislation allowing no knock
warrants, this research might even
transform federal narcs from the
bumbling pursuers that they are
into keen avengers whose swift
heroics have not been witnessed
since the days of Eliot Ness. We
can only speculate about how
important this research will turn
out to be.
One of the most discouraging
aspects of the dealer survey is that
it employs students to do the
interviewing and passing of
questionaires. The main student
employee is David Garvin, a
graduate student in English who
has worked for Blum and Smith
since last August. Dave Garvin is
also not a narc. He is a friend of
mine and even somewhat of a
freak. He does not particularly
want drug control efforts to
succeed. He took the job without
knowing the exact nature of the
survey because he needed to find

a job for his CO Alternative
Service, and this was the only one
he could find that was acceptable.
Now having started the job with
the approval of his draft board, he
fears he cannot quit without being
prosecuted under some section of
the selective service law.
Conscientious Objector status,
like ROTC and other alternatives
to the draft, appears to have a
punitive clause attached.
Unnamed Student Employees
Garvin is not the only student
employee. There is one other
whom neither he nor Blum is
willing to name. Also, Garvin had
hired a number of students under
him, but all of these have now
quit. According to Garvin, the
dealer survey is about half
•completed. It will continue at
least through the summer at
which time Blum says he plans to
hire three student interns. In
addition to the dealer study, Blum
and Smith are conducting a study
of families whose members use
drugs or have gotten in trouble
with drugs. This is being done
primarily in San Francisco.
Some claim research is
supposed to be amoral, but from
this research a definite moral can
be drawn. If a university hires
people interested in preserving the
stability of a society under attack,
and if these people draw their
research funds from federal
agencies whose primary interest is
in preserving stability, then the
university will find itself involved
in a variety of counterinsurgency
programs. This applied to SRl's
massive program which is funded
by the Department of Defense
and directed against peasants in
Thailand. It applies to Blum's and
Smith's dealer study which is
funded by the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
and directed against freaks and
drug users in this country.
But just because the university
is willing to promote such
research does not mean its
students have to cooperate with

it. The dealer survey is only half
done and cannot be completed
successfully without further
cooperation from students on this
campus. Encourage your friends
not to work on drug surveys. If
you know the second student
employee, encourage him to quit.
Avoid giving answers to those
asking about your drug
consumption or distribution
habits, both in interviews and on
questionaires. If cornered by a
researcher whom you do not
know how to turn away, answer
"I do not use drugs. I do not sell
drugs. I think using drugs is a
terrible idea." The present dealer
survey may appear innocuous
when presented to you by a soft
spoken long-haired student, but it
is a vital part of something much
more insidious than research. It is
designed to extend and improve
the government's control over its
citizens. Someday it may interfere
with your inalienable right to get
stoned.

must be handled by focusing
- attention on the dealers and the
sources of supply rather than on
the multitudes of users, and if
Blum's statement that "nobody
knows anything about drug
dealers" is true, then this research
could be of tremendous value to
law enforcement agencies trying
to construct a rational, "humane"
and effective policy. Blum agrees
that this study can be used to
construct a more efficient policy
for controlling drugs.
Eliot Ness
Coupled with the recent
legislation allowing no knock
warrants, this research might even
transform federal narcs from the
bumbling pursuers that they are
into keen avengers whose swift
heroics have not been witnessed
since the days of Eliot Ness. We
can only speculate about how
important this research will turn
out to be.
One of the most discouraging
aspects of the dealer survey is that
it employs students to do the
interviewing and passing of
questionaires. The main student
employee is David Garvin, a
graduate student in English who
has worked for Blum and Smith
since last August. Dave Garvin is
also not a narc. He is a friend of
mine and even somewhat of a
freak. He does not particularly
want drug control efforts to
succeed. He took the job without
knowing the exact nature of the
survey because he needed to find

a job for his CO Alternative
Service, and this was the only one
he could find that was acceptable.
Now having started the job with
the approval of his draft board, he
fears he cannot quit without being
prosecuted under some section of
the selective service law.
Conscientious Objector status,
like ROTC and other alternatives
to the draft, appears to have a
punitive clause attached.
Unnamed Student Employees
Garvin is not the only student
employee. There is one other
whom neither he nor Blum is
willing to name. Also, Garvin had
hired a number of students under
him, but all of these have now
quit. According to Garvin, the
dealer survey is about half
•completed. It will continue at
least through the summer at
which time Blum says he plans to
hire three student interns. In
addition to the dealer study, Blum
and Smith are conducting a study
of families whose members use
drugs or have gotten in trouble
with drugs. This is being done
primarily in San Francisco.
Some claim research is
supposed to be amoral, but from
this research a definite moral can
be drawn. If a university hires
people interested in preserving the
stability of a society under attack,
and if these people draw their
research funds from federal
agencies whose primary interest is
in preserving stability, then the
university will find itself involved
in a variety of counterinsurgency
programs. This applied to SRl's
massive program which is funded
by the Department of Defense
and directed against peasants in
Thailand. It applies to Blum's and
Smith's dealer study which is
funded by the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
and directed against freaks and
drug users in this country.
But just because the university
is willing to promote such
research does not mean its
students have to cooperate with

it. The dealer survey is only half
done and cannot be completed
successfully without further
cooperation from students on this
campus. Encourage your friends
not to work on drug surveys. If
you know the second student
employee, encourage him to quit.
Avoid giving answers to those
asking about your drug
consumption or distribution
habits, both in interviews and on
questionaires. If cornered by a
researcher whom you do not
know how to turn away, answer
"I do not use drugs. I do not sell
drugs. I think using drugs is a
terrible idea." The present dealer
survey may appear innocuous
when presented to you by a soft
spoken long-haired student, but it
is a vital part of something much
more insidious than research. It is
designed to extend and improve
the government's control over its
citizens. Someday it may interfere
with your inalienable right to get
stoned.
