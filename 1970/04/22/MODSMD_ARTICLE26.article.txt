# TAME GM

### Tim Clark 
These two Nader proposals do little more than ask for a
symbolic commitment from GM that it will become a socially
responsible corporation. These proposals do not require sweeping
changes or concrete actions which would put the vast economic
and political power of GM to work for the public good. Rather,
they are little more than the proverbial step in the right direction.
Likewise, Stanford's action on the issue is largely
side will Stanford come down on, the side of
progress and social good or the side of inertia and continued public
detriment? A more concrete danger is that the Board of Trustees
may establish a policy of always voting with management against
such socially concerned insurgents. An appropriate policy is for
Stanford to examine each issue on its merits and to make its
decision weighing the social and financial implications.
Corporate policy which pursues purely financial gain and
intentionally avoids social and moral considerations has had
anti-social and immoral results. Some argue that the government
ought to take regulatory actions to control the negative social
impact of corporate practices, but government action has been
insufficient. Too often the industry is stronger than the regulatory
agency. Shareholder pressure through voting stocks is simply
another way of bringing the corporation to serve the society, which
it ought to have been doing all along.
Financial Mechanism
Some fear that Stanford would be hurting itself financially by
voting for these two proposals. It is difficult to imagine how three
new members on GM's Board of Directors could produce any
financial loss. The Shareholders Committee might report
substantial shortcomings at GM, but it is financially better for GM
that such revelations be made by a group connected with the
company than by an outside group. The Shareholders Committee
will act as something of a protective mechanism; GP>? r:.n correct
situations before it is subject to damage suits foi its harmful
practices. Neither of these proposals will hurt GM financially in the
long run.
In holding GM stock, Stanford has undertaken the obligation of
responsible ownership. These two proposals offer u vehicle for
beginning to put the resources of GM to socially responsible and
productive uses. Stanford has the social obligation to use its voting
power to make GM a socially responsible corporate citizen.
There are compelling reasons for supporting these two
proposals. GM, and large corporations in general, wield enormous
power; these proposals are a small step toward putting this power
to socially beneficial uses. Stanford has the means to support this
progressive action; it has the responsibility to do so.
Vote YES twice on the GM referendum.
