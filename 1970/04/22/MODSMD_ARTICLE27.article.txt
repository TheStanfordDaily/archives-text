# UCCM Role
## Comment On Rupert Case 
### Prof. Richard Scott 
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing in my capacity as
chairman of the United Campus
Christian Ministry (UCCM) Board.
We had hoped to provide a
framework within which Paul
Rupert, who has refused
induction, could carry out his
alternative service. In offering Mr.
Rupert an internship in our
ministry, we believed that we
would be providing him with a
supportive structure conducive to
his continuing education and
development, and that he, in turn,
would be able to carry out
valuable counseling and
programming activities for our
ministry.
The Court has every right to
pass on the suitability of
alternative service arrangements.
However, Judge Weigle's decision
to prevent Mr. Rupert from
remaining in this area seems both
arbitrary and unduly
particularistic. Mr. Rupert appears
to have been summarily removed
from our community on grounds
which have not been made
explicit, but which clearly have no
relation to the offense for which
he was supposedly being
sentenced. Such decisions can
only weaken confidence in our
nation's judicial system.
Provost Lyman's role in these
matters has also been called into
question, and I would like to
comment, on mv conversations

with the Provost. Mr. Lyman did
ask to discuss with my our
Board's decision to offer an
internship to Mr. Rupert. While he
clearly had some reservations
about our decision, at no time did
he suggest that we did not have
the right to make the
appointment. He did suggest that
our letter offering the
appointment should make clear to
the Court that the UCCM was not
an official part of the University
— a statement of fact — and that
the University had taken no
action with respect to this
appointment. In this connection
he noted that if the letter from
our Board did not make these
relationships clear, that the
University might need to contact
the Court to be certain that there
was no confusion on this point. I
assured him that our
correspondence would make these
matters clear and that I would see
that he received a copy of our
letter to the Court.
Mr. Hardegree's column in the
Daily asserts that Provost Lyman
indicated that if the UCCM
persisted in this matter it was
courting the possibility of being
thrown off campus. This is Mr.
Hardegree's interpretation of my
conversation with Mr. Lyman and,
in my view, overstates and
considerably simplifies our
discussion. The Provost and I
discussed the present difficulties

of the University and the
somewhat controversial nature of
UCCM's activities. I explained
that our view of the Christian
ministry is that it spans political
divisions and conflicting interest
groups, and that hence we are
attempting to remain in working
contact with both the moderate
and the radical elements on
campus. Because our activities
sometimes bring us into conflict
with the interests of the
University as these are defined by
administrative and faculty bodies,
we discussed together what is the
appropriate relation of the UCCM
to the University. At the present
time we are, in effect, guests on
the campus. The time might come
when the University and the
interests of our ministry might be
better served if we moved off
campus. Our own Board has
debated this same issue many
times.
The proper relation between
UCCM and the University and
whether or not it is appropriate
for the UCCM to be housed on
campus were among the subjects
we discussed. However, at no time
did the Provost indicate in any
way that this decision would be
made on the basis of whether our
Board proceeded with the
appointment of Mr. Rupert as an
intern in our program.

discussion. The Provost and I
discussed the present difficulties

of the University and the
somewhat controversial nature of
UCCM's activities. I explained
that our view of the Christian
ministry is that it spans political
divisions and conflicting interest
groups, and that hence we are
attempting to remain in working
contact with both the moderate
and the radical elements on
campus. Because our activities
sometimes bring us into conflict
with the interests of the
University as these are defined by
administrative and faculty bodies,
we discussed together what is the
appropriate relation of the UCCM
to the University. At the present
time we are, in effect, guests on
the campus. The time might come
when the University and the
interests of our ministry might be
better served if we moved off
campus. Our own Board has
debated this same issue many
times.
The proper relation between
UCCM and the University and
whether or not it is appropriate
for the UCCM to be housed on
campus were among the subjects
we discussed. However, at no time
did the Provost indicate in any
way that this decision would be
made on the basis of whether our
Board proceeded with the
appointment of Mr. Rupert as an
intern in our program.

We had hoped to provide a
framework within which Paul
Rupert, who has refused
induction, could carry out his
alternative service. In offering Mr.
Rupert an internship in our
ministry, we believed that we
would be providing him with a
supportive structure conducive to
his continuing education and
development, and that he, in turn,
would be able to carry out
valuable counseling and
programming activities for our
ministry.
The Court has every right to
pass on the suitability of
alternative service arrangements.
However, Judge Weigle's decision
to prevent Mr. Rupert from
remaining in this area seems both
arbitrary and unduly
particularistic. Mr. Rupert appears
to have been summarily removed
from our community on grounds
which have not been made
explicit, but which clearly have no
relation to the offense for which
he was supposedly being
sentenced. Such decisions can
only weaken confidence in our
nation's judicial system.
Provost Lyman's role in these
matters has also been called into
question, and I would like to
comment, on mv conversations

with the Provost. Mr. Lyman did
ask to discuss with my our
Board's decision to offer an
internship to Mr. Rupert. While he
clearly had some reservations
about our decision, at no time did
he suggest that we did not have
the right to make the
appointment. He did suggest that
our letter offering the
appointment should make clear to
the Court that the UCCM was not
an official part of the University
— a statement of fact — and that
the University had taken no
action with respect to this
appointment. In this connection
he noted that if the letter from
our Board did not make these
relationships clear, that the
University might need to contact
the Court to be certain that there
was no confusion on this point. I
assured him that our
correspondence would make these
matters clear and that I would see
that he received a copy of our
letter to the Court.
Mr. Hardegree's column in the
Daily asserts that Provost Lyman
indicated that if the UCCM
persisted in this matter it was
courting the possibility of being
thrown off campus. This is Mr.
Hardegree's interpretation of my
conversation with Mr. Lyman and,
in my view, overstates and
considerably simplifies our
discussion. The Provost and I
