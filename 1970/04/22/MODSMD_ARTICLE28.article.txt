# Fast Against Violence
## New Life Style 
### My LAURIE HORN 
Craig Schindler grabbed for
both my shoulders and drew his
blue eyes six inches from my face.
"The commitment to
non-violence," he syncopated
through the din of four drums,
"Has got to be one of the most
activistic commitments . . . We're
desperately looking for alternative
life-styles . . . not just for the
message 'fuck-it; but for the
message 'recreate it."
A barefoot girl picked her way
through the armbanded fasters
clustered around Mem. Claw.
"Hey, Julie," yelled Craig.
"What time is it?"
"One," she radiated, bopping
her head.
"Four hours!" exclaimed
Sterling, cradling a
guitar . . . "That's really
something—l could go another
four."
Beat of Drums
The beat of the drums crep
insidiously up from the blankets,
shaking inside the bottoms of
chests. Craig's shoulders began to
twitch.
"How long have you been
lasting?" I asked in a strong voice.
"Has anyone seen the water
bottle?"
"HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN FASTING?" I shouted
again.
Craig was dancing
"Since Tuesday," Julie said.

Last Monday night, after the
convocation in Mem Chu, a group
met in the Round Room to
discuss non-violence. The meeting
centered on non-violence as a way
of life-not as a shrinking away
from rock-throwing militancy, but
as an affirmation that
rock-building militancy works.
The people at the meeting spoke
of non-violence in the sense of
Ghandi's Satyagrahi (soul force).
Tney saw it as "a belief in the

infinite possibilities of the
individual" —to build human
solidarity by embracing life.
In order to draw attention to
the non-violent alternative —
especially in the face of the ROTC
issue, they decided to until 5
p.m. Thursday. Thirty people
moved into White Plaza with
blankets and bongos—remained
there, singing, debating, thinking.
Statements
By Thursday afternoon about
six people had written statements.
"The immediate purpose of the
White Plaza fast," wrote Frances
Wade, "is to encourage people to
vote for OFF ROTC, but its larger
purpose is to start a non-violent
group on campus, that will be
existing at full strength in Fall
1970, hopefully in an on campus
cooperative residence, and to
promote non-violence as a way of
life."
The group met to break its fast
at 5 p.m. Thursday. The idea of
the cooperative had caught on.
Craig Schindler, tutor in Arroyo,
had spoken to Bill Leland about
the possibility of obtaining an
on-campus residence. Another
alternative would be a more rustic
co-op in the Skyline Region,
concerned with "de-develop
ment", with un-technological life,
with living in harmony with the
land.
Self-Sufficienl
Either residence, would be
self-sufficient. Members would do
their own cooking, cleaning, and
maintenance. They would begin
to organize both seminars on
non-violence and celebrations —
"Festivals of Life."
"We don't have to be sure of
anything now. We just have to be
wanting to figure things out,
that's all that matters ..."
The group agreed to meet again
this Thursday, at 5, in Arroyo.
Before leaving, 16 people signed
the statement to the left.
