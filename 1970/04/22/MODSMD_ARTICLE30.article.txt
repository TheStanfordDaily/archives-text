# Universities Oppose Nader's GM Plan
## 
### 
Three major universities have
rejected proposals similar to that
now before the Stanford Board of
Trustees that they vote their
shares of General Motors stock in
favor of Ralph Nader's Project for
Corporate Responsibility.
The regents of the University of
Michigan, the University of Texas,
and the University of California
have refused to order their GM
stock proxies voted in favor of the
Nader plan.
The plan, to be voted on at the
annual meeting of GM
stockholders on May 22 in
Detroit, is backed by a group of
Washington lawyers and has
drawn support from many campus
groups around the country. If
adopted, it would place three
consumer advocates on the
company's board of directors, and
would create a committee of
public responsibility to investigate
the company's record on such
public problems as pollution
control
UC Regents
The University of California
Regents decided Friday that the

matter should be left up to the
regent's investment committee.
The University of Michigan
Regents decided to vote the
university's 28,696 shares of GM
stock for the company
management and against Nader's
project.
The Michigan Regents said they
had "a consistent policy of voting
university shares for the
recommendation of the
management or of withholding its
proxy votes and disposing of its
shares."
Texas Regents
In Austin, Texas last week, uie
Nader project received another set
back. Regents of the University of
Texas refused to order the
school's 66,500 shares voted in

proposals.
At the last meeting of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, the
GM proxy issue was delegated to a
committee of three Trustees
which will return a
recommendation for Board action
at the May meeting.
