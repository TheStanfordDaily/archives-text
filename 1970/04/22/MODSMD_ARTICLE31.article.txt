# Statement Of Fasters
## 
### 
Hunger is among us. We are fasting. We are not
hungry because we are fasting, though, rather we
are fasting because we are hungry. We are hungry
to fulfill those needs which are spiritual,
emotional, extremely human needs, that too often
must go unnourished and suppressed at Stanford.
If we would spend as much time ministering to
each other as we spend ingesting food, (usually
way too much and of low nutritional value) ours
would be a better society.
A fast, then, is a health measure for the entire
person. Physically, we give our bodies a chance to
rest from the endless process of digestion and use
their restorative in a cleansing of the body. This
cleansing also goes on in our heads. Ours has been
a common effort. We are fasting for peace, off
ROTC, and ourselves. We need each other, we
need peace, we don't need ROTC, we don't need
violence. To fulfill these, we are seeking
Communionity.
It isn't easy, for we are not used to living
communally, feeling a simple and sincere respect
and concern for other people, and our
environment. If we live in dorms, we have our
rooms and lounges cleaned for us, our food
cooked (and de-nutritionalized) for us, our grass
cut for us, our gardens gardened for us, our trash
removed (to where?) for us. Too many aspects of

our lives are lived for us, and not by us. We live
without committments. We become alienated. We
separate heads from bodies.
We need to live together. Nqt just reside
together, apartment, together, eating together,
thinking together, dancing together, singing
together (sleeping together) crying together, and
struggling together. We need a cooperative home,
the size of the Row house, or a new fraternity that
has gone vacant, where we can care for ourselves
and each other: A place where we can undertake
an intensive study of non-violence and attempt to
extend this understanding into all dimensions of
our lives; a place of warmth, where we can seize
control of our lives and our home and attempt to
break the insidious spirals of consumption,
accumulation, pollution, imperialism, and violence
towards men, a place where we live in awareness of
the interdependence among ourselves, all others,
and our surrounding, world.
We earnestly want to begin a counter culture
within the Stanford community. Clearly violence
opposing violence partakes of an old culture, one
we no longer consider viable. We are striving to
create patterns of non-violence which offer an
alternative to violence as well as to apathy. With
our fast, a small, but not insignificant,
cornerstone, our committment to such a life-style
begins.

cleansing also goes on in our heads. Ours has been
a common effort. We are fasting for peace, off
ROTC, and ourselves. We need each other, we
need peace, we don't need ROTC, we don't need
violence. To fulfill these, we are seeking
Communionity.
It isn't easy, for we are not used to living
communally, feeling a simple and sincere respect
and concern for other people, and our
environment. If we live in dorms, we have our
rooms and lounges cleaned for us, our food
cooked (and de-nutritionalized) for us, our grass
cut for us, our gardens gardened for us, our trash
removed (to where?) for us. Too many aspects of

our lives are lived for us, and not by us. We live
without committments. We become alienated. We
separate heads from bodies.
We need to live together. Nqt just reside
together, apartment, together, eating together,
thinking together, dancing together, singing
together (sleeping together) crying together, and
struggling together. We need a cooperative home,
the size of the Row house, or a new fraternity that
has gone vacant, where we can care for ourselves
and each other: A place where we can undertake
an intensive study of non-violence and attempt to
extend this understanding into all dimensions of
our lives; a place of warmth, where we can seize
control of our lives and our home and attempt to
break the insidious spirals of consumption,
accumulation, pollution, imperialism, and violence
towards men, a place where we live in awareness of
the interdependence among ourselves, all others,
and our surrounding, world.
We earnestly want to begin a counter culture
within the Stanford community. Clearly violence
opposing violence partakes of an old culture, one
we no longer consider viable. We are striving to
create patterns of non-violence which offer an
alternative to violence as well as to apathy. With
our fast, a small, but not insignificant,
cornerstone, our committment to such a life-style
begins.
Hunger is among us. We are fasting. We are not
hungry because we are fasting, though, rather we
are fasting because we are hungry. We are hungry
to fulfill those needs which are spiritual,
emotional, extremely human needs, that too often
must go unnourished and suppressed at Stanford.
If we would spend as much time ministering to
each other as we spend ingesting food, (usually
way too much and of low nutritional value) ours
would be a better society.
A fast, then, is a health measure for the entire
person. Physically, we give our bodies a chance to
rest from the endless process of digestion and use
their restorative in a cleansing of the body. This
cleansing also goes on in our heads. Ours has been
a common effort. We are fasting for peace, off
ROTC, and ourselves. We need each other, we
need peace, we don't need ROTC, we don't need
violence. To fulfill these, we are seeking
