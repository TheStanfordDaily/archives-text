In Monday's Daily, due to a
typographical error, there was an
omission in the text of the
SCLC interim and permanent
legislation dealing with the
closing of buildings. The correct
first paragraph of that legislation
is printed below:
SCLC INTERIM LEGISLATION
Whenever the President finds
that a building or any part of a
building on the campus cannot
effectively be used for its
authorized operations, or when
the safety and security of
persons, records, equipment, or
property therein are endangered,
because of the presence of
persons in the building or in the
immediate vicinity of the
building, he may declare the
building and a clearly defined
area surrounding the building to
be closed for a stated period of
time, not to exceed thirty days,
to all persons or to all persons
not having authorized business
therein. In the latter case,
designees of the President, who

shall be stationed at an entrance
or entrances to the building,
shall authorize and regulate
access to the building to
categories of persons publicly
designated by the President.
