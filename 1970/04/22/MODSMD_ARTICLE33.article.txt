# Varied Activities To Mark END-Day
## 
### 
Earth day is finally here, and
for the thousands of college, high
school, and community organizers
the planning of five months is
coming to a climax.
Events scheduled across the
country include: dramatic
scenarios, such as a pond-cleaning
in Connecticut; a "pollution trail"
in Oregon, and a "Dead Orange
Parade" in Florida; as well as less
flashy teach-ins, nature walks, and
lectures.
The idea of a day of concern
for earth has drawn formal
endorsement from a wide range of
officials, from Secretary General
of the United Nations U Thant to
governors and mayors (including
Palo Alto mayor Edward Arnold).
The attitude of the Federal
government has been somewhat
aloof, whether deliberately or
involuntarily. But the student
organizers in Washington, D.C. see

END day as the dawn of a new era
of "ecological politics."
Earth day is not only a massive
program to awaken public
awareness to the problems
plaguing the environment; it is
also intended to "make life better,
not just bigger and faster, to
provide real, rather than rhetorical
solutions," according to the
organizers' manifesto.
Mankind's Expense
"It is a day to re-examine the
ethic of individual progress at
mankind's expense—a day to
challenge the corporate and
governmental leaders who promise
change, but who shortchange the
necessary programs . . . April 22
seeks a future worth living."
Earth Day grew out of a
suggestion made by U.S. Sen.
Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., in the
wake of last November's anti-war
demonstrations.
It was reasoned that if public
sentiment could be mobilized over

an issue that was essentially
negative, then the positive issue of
protecting the environment ought
to generate even greater support.
Local Participation
Organizers say that the key to
the success of END day is local
participation. To that end, a
largely volunteer force has been
working in a Washington, D.C.
office since January conducting a
campaign to stimulate local
observances.
Last week a spokesman for
Environmental Action, the
Washington group, estimated that
at least 2000 colleges, 10,000 high
schools, and 2000 communities
across the nation are participating
in the observances.
The budget for this huge
organizing effort has been set at
$125,000. The money has come
largely from conservation
organizations, a torrent of small
private contributors, and a few
large corporations.

However, according to
spokesman Stephen Cotton,
several offers from large firms
have been turned down.
The organizers are wary of
political alliances. Cotton said
that some politicans and
businessmen seem to think
environment is an easy issue on
which they can look good just by
expressing an interest.
Scores of events are slated for
the Bay Area today. Besides the
schedule of rallies, speeches, and
discussions here at Stanford,
significant programs are planned
at Berkeley, the University of San
Francisco, and the streets of the
City.
Senator Gaylord Nelson, a
student hero of the ecology
movement and an honorary
co-chairman of the Washington
organizational committee, is the
featured speaker at Berkeley. His
speech at 8 p.m. tonight follows a
long day of workshops and
discussions on the University of
California campus.
Water Project
Another highlight of the Cal
schedule is a panel discussion on
the controversial California Water
Project, led by Assemblyman
Jerome Waldie and State Senator
Nicholas Petris.
At the University of San
Francisco the water issue is due to
be debated by two panels of
Federal and state water officials at
10 a.m. and again at 8 p.m.
And ''educational
demonstration" on Golden Gate
Bridge for the benefit of
rush-hour commuters is also
rumored to be in the works.
Members of the San Francisco
chapter of Zero Population
Growth hope to draw out a few of
the lessons of over-population for
the harried five o'clock drivers.

Some of the more colorful
demonstrations planned across the
country include a "Dirty Orange
Parade" in Florida and a
"pollution trail" in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
The Florida "Parade,"
sponsored by a group calling itself
the New Party of Florida, will
consist of floats emphasizing the
pollution theme. One float, called
"Old Smokies," depicts
smokestacks across the country.
Another, "People Pollution," will
show a small car crammed with
people and carry a banner reading,
"We double every 35 years—food
doesn't."
Several groups made the
automobile their Earth Day
target. Traffic bans were
scheduled in many cities,
including New York and
Philadelphia.
Deeper Currents
If the immediate target of the
events is pollution in all its various
forms, there are also deeper
currents running in the minds of
the sponsors.
Organizers hurry to stress that
the issues of the Vietnam War,
racial friction, and even the basic
growth-oriented, quantity
-oriented goals of our present
society are closely bound up with
the ecology crisis.
The whole Earth Day campaign
has been widely derided by
campus radicals and black
militants as a "white middle-class
diversion" of public attention
from the issues of Vietnam and
racial equality.
Earth Day organizers respond
that a satisfactory environment
means a climate of peace and
equality; they argue that a world
at peace is a meaningless
accomplishment if mankind is
instead to perish on an
uninhabitable earth.

consist of floats emphasizing the
pollution theme. One float, called
"Old Smokies," depicts
smokestacks across the country.
Another, "People Pollution," will
show a small car crammed with
people and carry a banner reading,
"We double every 35 years—food
doesn't."
Several groups made the
automobile their Earth Day
target. Traffic bans were
scheduled in many cities,
including New York and
Philadelphia.
Deeper Currents
If the immediate target of the
events is pollution in all its various
forms, there are also deeper
currents running in the minds of
the sponsors.
Organizers hurry to stress that
the issues of the Vietnam War,
racial friction, and even the basic
growth-oriented, quantity
-oriented goals of our present
society are closely bound up with
the ecology crisis.
The whole Earth Day campaign
has been widely derided by
campus radicals and black
militants as a "white middle-class
diversion" of public attention
from the issues of Vietnam and
racial equality.
Earth Day organizers respond
that a satisfactory environment
means a climate of peace and
equality; they argue that a world
at peace is a meaningless
accomplishment if mankind is
instead to perish on an
uninhabitable earth.
Earth day is finally here, and
for the thousands of college, high
school, and community organizers
the planning of five months is
coming to a climax.
Events scheduled across the
country include: dramatic
scenarios, such as a pond-cleaning
in Connecticut; a "pollution trail"
in Oregon, and a "Dead Orange
Parade" in Florida; as well as less
flashy teach-ins, nature walks, and
lectures.
The idea of a day of concern
for earth has drawn formal
endorsement from a wide range of
officials, from Secretary General
of the United Nations U Thant to
governors and mayors (including
Palo Alto mayor Edward Arnold).
The attitude of the Federal
government has been somewhat
aloof, whether deliberately or
involuntarily. But the student
organizers in Washington, D.C. see

END day as the dawn of a new era
of "ecological politics."
Earth day is not only a massive
program to awaken public
awareness to the problems
plaguing the environment; it is
also intended to "make life better,
not just bigger and faster, to
provide real, rather than rhetorical
solutions," according to the
organizers' manifesto.
Mankind's Expense
"It is a day to re-examine the
ethic of individual progress at
mankind's expense—a day to
challenge the corporate and
governmental leaders who promise
change, but who shortchange the
necessary programs . . . April 22
seeks a future worth living."
Earth Day grew out of a
suggestion made by U.S. Sen.
Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., in the
wake of last November's anti-war
demonstrations.
It was reasoned that if public
sentiment could be mobilized over

an issue that was essentially
negative, then the positive issue of
protecting the environment ought
to generate even greater support.
Local Participation
Organizers say that the key to
the success of END day is local
participation. To that end, a
largely volunteer force has been
working in a Washington, D.C.
office since January conducting a
campaign to stimulate local
observances.
Last week a spokesman for
Environmental Action, the
Washington group, estimated that
at least 2000 colleges, 10,000 high
schools, and 2000 communities
across the nation are participating
in the observances.
The budget for this huge
organizing effort has been set at
$125,000. The money has come
largely from conservation
organizations, a torrent of small
private contributors, and a few
large corporations.

However, according to
spokesman Stephen Cotton,
several offers from large firms
have been turned down.
The organizers are wary of
political alliances. Cotton said
that some politicans and
businessmen seem to think
environment is an easy issue on
which they can look good just by
expressing an interest.
Scores of events are slated for
the Bay Area today. Besides the
schedule of rallies, speeches, and
discussions here at Stanford,
significant programs are planned
at Berkeley, the University of San
Francisco, and the streets of the
City.
Senator Gaylord Nelson, a
student hero of the ecology
movement and an honorary
co-chairman of the Washington
organizational committee, is the
featured speaker at Berkeley. His
speech at 8 p.m. tonight follows a
long day of workshops and
discussions on the University of
California campus.
Water Project
Another highlight of the Cal
schedule is a panel discussion on
the controversial California Water
Project, led by Assemblyman
Jerome Waldie and State Senator
Nicholas Petris.
At the University of San
Francisco the water issue is due to
be debated by two panels of
Federal and state water officials at
10 a.m. and again at 8 p.m.
And ''educational
demonstration" on Golden Gate
Bridge for the benefit of
rush-hour commuters is also
rumored to be in the works.
Members of the San Francisco
chapter of Zero Population
Growth hope to draw out a few of
the lessons of over-population for
the harried five o'clock drivers.

Some of the more colorful
demonstrations planned across the
country include a "Dirty Orange
Parade" in Florida and a
"pollution trail" in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
The Florida "Parade,"
sponsored by a group calling itself
the New Party of Florida, will
consist of floats emphasizing the
pollution theme. One float, called
"Old Smokies," depicts

Senator Gaylord Nelson, a
student hero of the ecology
movement and an honorary
co-chairman of the Washington
organizational committee, is the
featured speaker at Berkeley. His
speech at 8 p.m. tonight follows a
long day of workshops and
discussions on the University of
California campus.
Water Project
Another highlight of the Cal
schedule is a panel discussion on
the controversial California Water
Project, led by Assemblyman
Jerome Waldie and State Senator
Nicholas Petris.
At the University of San
Francisco the water issue is due to
be debated by two panels of
Federal and state water officials at
10 a.m. and again at 8 p.m.
And ''educational
demonstration" on Golden Gate
Bridge for the benefit of
rush-hour commuters is also
rumored to be in the works.
Members of the San Francisco
chapter of Zero Population
Growth hope to draw out a few of
the lessons of over-population for
the harried five o'clock drivers.

Some of the more colorful
demonstrations planned across the
country include a "Dirty Orange
Parade" in Florida and a
"pollution trail" in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
The Florida "Parade,"
sponsored by a group calling itself
the New Party of Florida, will
consist of floats emphasizing the
pollution theme. One float, called
"Old Smokies," depicts
smokestacks across the country.
Another, "People Pollution," will
show a small car crammed with
people and carry a banner reading,
"We double every 35 years—food
doesn't."
Several groups made the
automobile their Earth Day
target. Traffic bans were
scheduled in many cities,
including New York and
Philadelphia.
Deeper Currents
If the immediate target of the
events is pollution in all its various
forms, there are also deeper
currents running in the minds of
the sponsors.
Organizers hurry to stress that
the issues of the Vietnam War,
racial friction, and even the basic
growth-oriented, quantity
-oriented goals of our present
society are closely bound up with
the ecology crisis.
The whole Earth Day campaign
has been widely derided by
campus radicals and black
militants as a "white middle-class
diversion" of public attention
from the issues of Vietnam and
racial equality.
Earth Day organizers respond
that a satisfactory environment
means a climate of peace and
equality; they argue that a world
at peace is a meaningless
accomplishment if mankind is
instead to perish on an
uninhabitable earth.
Earth day is finally here, and
for the thousands of college, high
school, and community organizers
the planning of five months is
coming to a climax.
Events scheduled across the
country include: dramatic
scenarios, such as a pond-cleaning
in Connecticut; a "pollution trail"
in Oregon, and a "Dead Orange
Parade" in Florida; as well as less
flashy teach-ins, nature walks, and
lectures.
The idea of a day of concern
for earth has drawn formal
endorsement from a wide range of
officials, from Secretary General
of the United Nations U Thant to
governors and mayors (including
Palo Alto mayor Edward Arnold).
The attitude of the Federal
government has been somewhat
aloof, whether deliberately or
involuntarily. But the student
organizers in Washington, D.C. see

END day as the dawn of a new era
of "ecological politics."
Earth day is not only a massive
program to awaken public
awareness to the problems
plaguing the environment; it is
also intended to "make life better,
not just bigger and faster, to
provide real, rather than rhetorical
solutions," according to the
organizers' manifesto.
Mankind's Expense
"It is a day to re-examine the
ethic of individual progress at
mankind's expense—a day to
challenge the corporate and
governmental leaders who promise
change, but who shortchange the
necessary programs . . . April 22
seeks a future worth living."
Earth Day grew out of a
suggestion made by U.S. Sen.
Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., in the
wake of last November's anti-war
demonstrations.
It was reasoned that if public
sentiment could be mobilized over

an issue that was essentially
negative, then the positive issue of
protecting the environment ought
to generate even greater support.
Local Participation
Organizers say that the key to
the success of END day is local
participation. To that end, a
largely volunteer force has been
working in a Washington, D.C.
office since January conducting a
campaign to stimulate local
observances.
Last week a spokesman for
Environmental Action, the
Washington group, estimated that
at least 2000 colleges, 10,000 high
schools, and 2000 communities
across the nation are participating
in the observances.
The budget for this huge
organizing effort has been set at
$125,000. The money has come
largely from conservation
organizations, a torrent of small
private contributors, and a few
large corporations.

However, according to
spokesman Stephen Cotton,
several offers from large firms
have been turned down.
The organizers are wary of
political alliances. Cotton said
that some politicans and
businessmen seem to think
environment is an easy issue on
which they can look good just by
expressing an interest.
Scores of events are slated for
the Bay Area today. Besides the
schedule of rallies, speeches, and
discussions here at Stanford,
significant programs are planned
at Berkeley, the University of San
Francisco, and the streets of the
City.
