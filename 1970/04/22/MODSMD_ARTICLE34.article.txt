# Re-cycling
## 
### 
Newspapers will be collected in
White Plaza today to be re-cycled.
The idea is to save trees and cut
down on the amount of trash that
is dumped into the Bay. The
money received from the
collection drive will be used for a
conservation project to save
forests from developers.
Any sort of newsprint can go
into the collection bin, but
magazines cannot.
The collection drive is being
run by the Stanford Conservation
Group in conjunction with Earth
Day.
