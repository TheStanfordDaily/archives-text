# KZSU Carries Opposing Endorsements Of Candidates
## 
### 
Radio station KZSU carried
opposing endorsements yesterday
of the two presidential slates that
students will choose between
today and tomorrow. The station
emphasized that neither of the
endorsements was an editorial,
but each represented the views of
individual members of the staff.
The first statement, prepared
by KZSU news analyst Owen
Blank and approved by News
Director David Prottingeier,
endorsed the Shoch-Evers ticket.
Blank emphasized that the
university, and student
government, must take an active
role in social issues "at a time
when the nation is beset with
racism and poverty, a cruel war
continues in Southeast Asia, and
we are faced with rapidly
increasing environmental
deterioration. The Shoch-Evers
ticket has proven that they are
neither unwilling nor afraid to
take strong positions on matters
of social importance."
Noting the importance of
personal qualities in bringing
changes on campus, the
endorsement stated that "The
Shoch-Evers ticket has displayed
the kind of frankness and strength
that is needed to support student
rights and positions."
The endorsement argued,
finally, that student government
must be free from administration
control. "If community
governance is to prevail at
Stanford . . .the control of
student leaders by university
officials cannot be tolerated. We
are confident that the

t/
Shoch-Evers ticket will not allow
student interest to be sacrificed
by the hand of administrative
expediency."
The endorsement of the Shea,
Grant, Mickelson, and Levin
ticket was delivered by Tom
Dawson. It emphasized that the
Shea-Grant ticket offered the
experience and qualifications
necessary for effective leadership
while the opposing ticket "offered
only familiar rhetoric." The
statement charged that Shoch has
"attempted to exploit immediate
issues of concern for his ticket's

benefit."
The endorsement applauded
the Shea-Grant ticket for their
extensive position papers on such
issues as ROTC, student services,
and land development. "They
have asserted in their stands on
these issues that the ASSU must
offer both leadership in
controversy and also nonpolitical
services for students."
"Shea, Grant, Mickelson and
Levin," that statement concluded,
"offer the experience and
commitment necessary for a truly
representative ASSU."
