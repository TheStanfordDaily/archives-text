# Land Development Moves Announced
## 
### 
In two actions relating to land
development, the university has
announced the hiring of a regional
planning firm to aid in a land use
review and also has requested that
37 acres of property be annexed
to Palo Alto for a new golf course.
The Trustees have authorized
the hiring of the planners,
Livingston and Blayney, to help in
the campus review now being
made by the University
Committee on Land and Building
Development.
President Kenneth Pitzer has
asked the committee to study use
of 1,173 acres of unannexed land
outside the 537-acre academic
reserve, bearing in mind "the
needs of the total
community ... as well as
Stanford's critical need for
financial support."

Stanford has leased 940 of its
available 8,168 acres, about 11
percent, to obtain funds, pay
taxes, and protect its land
endowment from condemnation
proceedings.
The proposed public golf
course will stretch along Deer
Gulch Creek from Aratradero
Road to Coyote Hill Road. 36 of
the 58 acres for the course lie on
Stanford land.
The golf course will be
operated by a private group, but
open to the public. Construction
is expected to start this summer.
The wooded creek area will be
preserved in its natural state.
In a report to the city of Palo
Alto, Livingston and Blayney have
said that the golf course would be
"an excellent way to buffer this
area and to preserve the creek."
