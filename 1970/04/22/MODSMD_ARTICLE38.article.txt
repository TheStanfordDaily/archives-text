# Laxmen Split Pair With Utes, Falcons
## 
### 
The Stanford lacrosse team
moved from a field covered with
sawdust on Friday to an Astro
Turf surface on Saturday, but
their fortunes did not rise
correspondingly as they split in
weekend action. The Indians
walloped Utah Friday in Salt Lake
City, 20-3, then were forced by
snow to meet the Air Force
Academy in the Falcon
Fieldhouse, succumbing by an
11-2 count.
Utah was never in the game as
Stanford tallied four goals in each
of the first three' periods, then
burst open for eight in the final
frame. Crease attackman Butch
Hazlett rammed home eight goals
on his own, while Chip Loveman
contributed three goals and five
assists.
Loveman and Hazlett were the
only Indians to get on the
scoreboard in the much more
important game against the
Falcons. Trying to reassert their
pre-eminence in Western lacrosse,
which they were toppled from last
year in a nightmarish game at the
Academy, Stanford ran well with
the cadets, but were beaten by a
tactical problem and the ability of
the well-drilled Falcons to
capitalize on Stanford errors.
Led by a sterling performance
by senior captain Bill Eakland on

Air Force's high scoring Rick
Taylor, the Stanford defense
played well. But the Tribe simply
could not break well conceived
Maryland Ride thrown up by the
Air Force and could not get the
ball into the offensive zone often
enough to be effective.
Stanford had the opening
advantage, as John Hanley won
the first face-off, despite
difficulties with the Falcon's new
plastic sticks, and a Stanford score
looked imminent. It was the Air
Force, however, who got the first
tally on a broken play well into
the first quarter. Then the cadets
got two quick, equally
unorthodox goals to widen the
margin to three goals. Finally,
Hazlett rammed one home for the
Indians in an extra man situation
to keep the game well within
reach.
The Falcons scored two more
in the second quarter to go into
the halftime intermission with a
5-1 lead, still not particularly
comfortable. But a four-point
splurge in the third period iced it
for the Air Force and spoiled
Stanford's challenge. Only a final
goal by Loveman on a feed from
Hazlett brightened things for the
Indians, who played a much
tougher game than the score
indicates.
