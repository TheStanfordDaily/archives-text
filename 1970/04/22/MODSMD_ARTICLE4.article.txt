# Confusion Halts SJC Work
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
The Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) is waiting for the university
administration to investigate
charges against 32 anti-ROTC
demonstrators before holding a
hearing. But the administration
thinks the investigation is being
conducted independently by SJC
Judicial Aides.
As a result, no one has done
anything since last week, when
Dean of Students Peter Bulkeley
sent the defendants' names to SJC
chairman Marc Franklin.
Franklin said yesterday that an
adversary system will be used in
the case, with a university official
presenting the evidence, the
accused students organizing their
own defense, and the SJC
members acting as judge and jury.
"The responsibility is on the
administration to investigate."
But James Siena, legal advisor
to President Pitzer, revealed that
no administration officials are
conducting sr.ch an investigation.
Judicial Aides
The SJC has several Judicial
Aides, authorized by the Judicial
Charter to "investigate and report
the facts of each case." In all
previous cases this year, the Aides
have gathered the evidence.
The ROTC protestors, though,
constitute the first "political"
defendants, according to Franklin.
Students accused of honor code
violations, petty theft, and similar
offenses do not feel themselves in
confrontation with the
administration, said Franklin. In
such situations the SJC can
comfortably act, in effect, as
prosecuter, judge and jury.
Franklin described these cases as
"confidential" and "informal."
But in the ROTC cases, which
are "more like a trial," being
"prosecuter" would "put me in a
very difficult position," Franklin
remarked.
Last spring the SJC, then
chaired by Law Professor Jack
Friedenthal, conducted its own
investigation of the Encina Hall
sit-ins. This circumstance, said
Franklin, led to a "perceived
unfairness" in the Encina
defendants' attitude towards the
SJC, a development Franklin

hopes to avoid.
Memoranda Sent
Franklin-, says he knows
nothing of the cases other than
three short memoranda sent to
him last week by Bulkeley. The
memoranda name 32 students
who are suspected of violating
university regulations in
connection with three recent

anti-ROTC demonstrations, but
not involving the rock-throwing
incidents.
The students have not been
officially informed that their
names have been sent to the SJC,
although some have been notified
informally. The SJC can
investigate a charge without
informing the student involved.
Janet Weiss, one of those
named in Bulkeley's memoranda,
said yesterday that there will be a
group defense for most of the
32â€”if a hearing does take place.
The SJC, now in its second
year of existence, was approved in
1968 by the Academic Senate and
a student referendum. Its
decisions are only
recommendations to the
president, but it has not been
overruled this year.
The council is composed of
four faculty (Engineering
Professor Gene Franklin, English
Professor David Halliburton,
Psychology Professor Leonard
Horowitz, and Physics Professor
John Schwartz), four students
(Frederick Dietz, Lynn Karowsky,
H. Renton Rolph, and James
Ware), plus the chairman, Law
Professor Franklin. The chairman
votes only to break ties.
Cooperation Necessary
Faculty members are
appointed by the Academic
Senate. The students are chosen
by the Student Selection
Committee, composed of one
faculty member of the SJC, one
faculty member chosen by "the
appropriate agency of the
Academic Council," one student
member of the SJC, and three
members of the Student Senate.
A section of the Judicial
Charter requires students to
cooperate with the SJC, on
penalty of having the student's
next-quarter registration withheld.
It is unclear, according to
Franklin, whether this clause
applies to witnesses as well as
defendants. The clause is included
within a section entitled
"Defendant Cooperation."
A student does, however, have
the right to refuse to incriminate
himself.
