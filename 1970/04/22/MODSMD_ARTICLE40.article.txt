# Top College Golfers Assault Card Course
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
The dew will scarcely be off
the grass and the sun barely above
the oak trees when 150 of the
nation's top intercollegiate golfers
tee off this morning in the final
practice round of the Third
Annual U.S. Invitational Golf
Championships.
The Indians will host 27 teams
from around the nation, with the
top 15 moving into the finals on
Saturday. The individual
championship will also be on the
line, and a real battle is expected
as the intercollegiate elite tackle
the challenging Stanford course.
Tom Watson figures to lead the
Stanford charge for their second
team title in three years. The
Tribe finished first in 1968, but
finished behind USC in last year's
tournament.

Watson, recently returned from
the Master's where hs missed the
final cut by a scant three strokes,
fired a four under par 67 Sunday
to lead the Stanford varsity to an
easy win over the Stanford Golf
Club team. Coach Bud Finger's
team is 6-2 in the year.
Watson bogeyed the 18th but
had room to spare as ten holes
earlier he had canned a perfect
nine iron shot to chalk up the
third hole-in-one of his career.
Tom Keelin, consistently sharp
this season for the Indians, is
expected to give the leaders a run
for their money, and Gary Vanier
and Pete Harpster look to keep
Stanford's team score among the
lowest reported to the clubhouse.
Rich Spaeth, the only scratch
handicap golfer in the tourney
other than Watson will be among

those vying for the number one
individual honors.
Kelly Moser of San Jose State,
recent winner of the Alameda
Commuters Championship will be
on hand as will Bob Allard, 1969
Pacific-8 champ from Oregon
State.
Dave Bosley, number one man
for the Cal Bears, who led going
into the last round of the
Pasatiempo Western
Intercollegiate Championships,
figures to be a strong finisher.
Stanford made an impressive
showing at Pasatiempo, finishing
fourth ahead of USC and San Jose
State.
The Indians' only losses have
come at the hands of San Jose and
Fresno State, the two matches
Watson missed while playing at
Augusta.
