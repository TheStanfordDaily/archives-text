## Toro Team Takes Tourney 
### STEVE CRONENBERG 
In the Intramural Gymnastics
Tournament held last week, El
Toro simply outnumbered and
outclassed the rest of the field to
easily take the team crown.
Mark Wardenburg, the
all-around champion, won three
events in leading his El Toro
teammates (Fred Prudek, Gary
Montante, Steve Head, and Doug
Horst) to the championship.
Individual winners were Tom
Parchman of Donner in Free
Exercise, Steve Head of El Toro
on the Rings, Scott Stillinger of
KA in Vaulting, Ben Knight of
Los Arcos on the Trampoline, and
Mark Wardenburg of El Toro on
the Side Horse and the Parallel
Bars. Knight and Wardenburg also
tied for first on the High Bar. El
Toro was followed by Los Arcos,
Donner, KA, Cro Mem, and Theta
Chi respectively in the
competition for the team title.
Single elimination tournaments
have been arranged for both
horseshoes and tennis (singles).
There are 28 teams competing in
the horseshoes competition with
the seeded teams being Cro Mem,
Chi Psi, Theta Chi, and Alpha Sig.
The first round of this
competition is scheduled to be
played for the tennis
championship with the top four
seeded teams (KA A, Theta Chi A,
Biz I A, DA B) having byes
through the first round. This first
round competition is slated to be
completed by April 25.
Last Friday in an Intramural
softball game between Rodney's
Rods and VVV, both teams
showed up on schedule but
neither team had the foresight to
bring a bat. Fortunately one was
soon procured from the Sunken
Diamond where the

Stanford-UCLA baseball game was
in progress For VW this was
the highlight of their afternoon as
their pitcher was pounded
mercilessly by the Rods. When the
dust had finally cleared, the final
score was 14-0 in 4 innings in
favor of Rodney's Rods.
