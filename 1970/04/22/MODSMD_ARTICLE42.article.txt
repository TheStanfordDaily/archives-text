# '...Neither Decoration Nor Anecdote'
## Motherwell Exhibit Arrives 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
Robert Motherwell wrote of
colleague Jackson Pollock in
1944: "His principal problem is to
discover what his true subject is.
And since painting is his thoughts'
medium, the resolution must grow
out of the process of painting
itself."
The statement describes the
artist Motherwell himself as well,
whose recent works are presently
on display at the Stanford Art
Museum. Containing more than
20 paintings, drawings, collages
and prints from the
Marlborough-Gerson Gallery in
New York, the exhibit is the first
showing of this well known
artist's recent work in California.
Robert Motherwell lives with
his wife, the artist Helen
Frankenthaler, in New York.
They are considered important
members of the now influential
New York group of artists.
Stanford Grad
He was born in Aberdeen,
Washington, grew up in the Bay

Area and graduated from Stanford
in 1936 with an A.B. in
Philosophy. He came to art some
years later and continues to
explore areas outside of art to
bring into his work. Best known
as an artist, he has taught, written
extensively about art, other
artists, has contributed to and
edited catalogues, and writes
about his own work.
The artist is verbally as well as
visually articulatc. Writing about
his own work ana its relationship
to his audience he has said:
" . . . one has to have an intimate
acquaintance with the language of
contemporary painting to be able
to see the real beauties of it; to
see the ethical background is even
more difficult. It is a question of
consciousness . . . Without ethical
consciousness, a painter is only a
decorator . . . Without ethical
consciousness, the audience is
only sensual, one of aesthetes."
Further, the artist has said:
"True painting is a lot more than
"picture-making". A man is
neither a decoration nor an
anecdote."
Cultural Concern
Motherwell, perhaps
characteristic of the New York
artist today, is concerned with the
movement of contemporary
culture as it is manifested in the
visual, and its effect on the work
of other artists. An influential
leader of the abstract
expressionist group in the 40's
and 50's, it appears that recently
Motherwell has temporarily

shifted to the position of the
artist who is reacting through his
art, responding to what he sees
happening in the studios of his
colleagues, struggling to adjust his
own art, rather than setting the
pace. More powerful and
avante-garde expressions were
perhaps contained in the ten years
of his work preceding '67.
Turning to the present exhibit
at the Museum we see examples
from both periods. Pieces from
the suites "Elegy to the Spanish
Republic", "Summertime in
Italy", Beside the Sea", and"The
Figure Four" and powerful on
impact and remind the reviewer of
the artist's words: "... to paint,
not the thing, but the effect it
produces."
Recent Change
There has been a dramatic
change in Motherwell's work in
the past three years which is not
adequately documented for the
viewer in the group of works
selected to be shown. Perhaps the
artist has more to say then, than
the exhibit, about the shift from
the afore mentioned works to the
'67-'69 "Open Series". The large
sky blue canvas with three
intervening black charcoal lines in
the shape of a rectangle, in this
series leaves this reviewer empty,
and looks like the artist is saying
that painting in general has run
aground. Perhaps there are not
enough crucial works from this
period to complete their
statement, but the ones there are
stand out coldly alone.
There is a family resemblance
between these recent works and
the older "Summertime in Italy"
the more recent paintings being
perhaps a further exploration of
the form by reducing it on canvas
to its lowest common
denominator - concept of what is
termed 'minimal art'. But again,
there are too many pieces missing
in the show to verify this
transition.
Contemporary Awareness
In general, the exhibit is well
worth a visit to the Stanford
Museum. This is the first exhibit
of contempory art at the Museum
this year. It was fortunate to get
the show and it is in keeping with
the Museum's policy of displaying
a varied program and providing
material to correspond with
classes. As stated by the Museum's
curator; "We are concerned with

making the student aware of what
the artist is doing today."
While you are at the Museum
look at the Frank Stella painting.
Stella in particular is an artist who
is breaking new ground with his
large, colorful, geometric
canvases.

The exhibit of Motherwell
paintings, drawings, collages and
prints has been extended through
Sunday, May 17. The Stanford
Art Museum is located on
Museum Way, off Palm Drive and
is open Saturday and Sunday 1-5,
and 10-5 Tuesday through Friday.
