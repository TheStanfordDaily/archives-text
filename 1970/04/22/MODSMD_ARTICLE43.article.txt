# Silver On View
## 
### 
An important group of early American silver from the Marble
Collection will be on view at the Stanford Museum from April 18th
through May.
The exhibition contains examples of work by the finest American
silversmiths active between 1700 and 1830, including notable pieces
by Paul Revere, Jacob Hurd, John Coney, Simeon Soumain, and many
other American craftsmen who, in the Colonial and Revolutionary
periods, contributed to the formation of a distinctive, national style
of silverwork.
Formed during the 1920's and 1930's by the late Mrs. John
Emerson Marble, and loaned to the Stanford Museum by the
collector's daughter, Mrs. John H. Hinrichs, the collection has an
unusually comprehensive range. Characteristic examples illustrate the
contributions of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and other centers to
the main tradition of American silver.
The stylistic development which American silverwork underwent in
the course of its first century are represented stage by stage, from its
earliest origins, still marked by the traces of English, Dutch, and
German influence, to its culmination in the elegant sobriety and
assured originality of the work produced about the time of the
American revolution.
The wide variety of objects shown — porringers, tankards, salts,
coffee and tea services, spoons and ladles of every type and size —
affords an insight into the social ambitions, tastes, the economic
conditions, and even the dietary habits of Americans in the Colonial,
Revolutionary, and immediate Post-Revolutionary periods.
