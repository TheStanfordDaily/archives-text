# 'St. Joan' Sparkles In ACT Production
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
One day when George Bernard
Shaw was puttering around the
house with nothing to do,
somebody suggested that he write
a play about Joan of Arc. So he
wrote a play about the
Renaissance, the rise of
Nationalism, the decline of the
Church, the conceit of
Englishmen, the selfishness and
simplicity of Man, set it in
fifteenth century France, and
called it "Saint Joan." You can
see it for yourself at the Geary
Theater in San Francisco, where
ACT's brilliant production is
running in reportory for the next
few months.
It's probably a good bet that
every student at Stanford at some
time in his academic career is
exposed to G. B. Shaw in printed
form. On paper Shavian drama
seems more like lengthy
philosophy written in the form of
dialogue than like drama—sort of
low brow Plato.
Shaw was a wordy
fellow —almost every one of his
plays has an introduction or a
postscript; some have both. His
stage directions are almost as good
as his dialogue, and sometimes
one wonders why he bothered
writing the play at all, seeing as
how he seemed to have so much
fun with the peripheral material.
Urama Is Wondrous
The answer is that George
Bernard Shaw on stage if.
something rather different from
George Bernard Shaw in a book.
On paper Shaw is erudite and
witty; on stage he is exciting and
funny—very funny. When we read
Shaw in the classroom we are
really reading Shaw as a
philosopher—his plays are buried
in so much extraneous material
we really can't help it. But when
we go to the theater we see Shaw
the playwright—and Shavian
drama well done is wondrous to
behold.
What makes ACT's production
of "Saint Joan" so successful is
that the director, Edward Gilbert,
seems to have understood what
Shaw was saying and doing in
each scene, and then staged it in
such a clear and dynamic way that
the wit, intelligence and irony of

the script shines like a beautiful
star on the stage.
No Tricks
Mr. Gilbert does not resort to
tricks; he does not interpolate
contemporary politics, social
commentary, yesterday's weather
report, or anything else into the
play. He has done his best to
arrange things so that Shaw can
speak for himself, and as might be
expected from such a radical
decision, the result is a brilliant
theatrical experience.
Mr. Gilbert has been helped
out in almost every department.
His cast is generally excellent,
with small deviations to either
side.
Joan Superb
Kitty Winn has the difficult
part of Joan; she is superb. The
character of Joan exists on many
levels in the play—Joan the
country girl turned soldier, Joan
the symbol of the approaching
Reformation and rising
nationalism, and Joan the symbol
of what men both worship and
fear—a martyr.
Together Mr. Gilbert and Miss
Winn have made Joan all that
Shaw meant her to be. She is a
strong character, simple and
single-minded. She does not
change much throughout the
play—just enough to let you know
that she's real. For Shaw, and for
Shaw's characters, Joan represents
forces of social change which she
is totally unable to recognize or
understand.
Miss Winn makes us believe in
Joan the Maid, in Joan the Saint,
and in Joan the prophet of social
upheaval, and while the character
remains basically unchanged, she
stands for more and more as the
play goes on. It is a difficult task,
and Miss Winn does a beautiful
job.
Ego Involvement
Ellis Rabb plays The Dauphin
whom Joan crowns King Charles
VII in Rheims. His performance is
somewhat more stylized than I
would like to see —the part of The
Dauphin is a juicy one, and Mr.
Rabb seems to be enjoying the
juice a bit too much for the good
of the play.
Ray Reinhardt as Richard de
Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and
Ken Ruta as Peter Cauchon,
Bishop of Beauvais, are both
brilliant as representatives of the
fifteenth century Establishment
which Joan, and the ideas she
unknowingly represents, is
threatening. Together with Tom
Wheatley as the Chaplain de
Stogumber, they have a very long,
very talky scene in the first act in
which Mr. Shaw's philosophy and
wit are given their major
exhibition.

All three do credit to
themselves, to Mr. Shaw, to his
play, and to their audience.
G. Wood as the Archbishop of
Rheims gives his role dignity and
depth, making the Archbishop a
rather attractive character. Paul
Shenar does a lot better as the
soldier Dunoir, Bastard of
Orleans, then he does as Oedipus,
the King of Thebes in another
ACT production. He is the closest
thing to a romantic lead in this
show, and he carries it off quite
well.
Jay Doyle played The
Inquisitor the night I saw the
show (he alternates with Robert
Fletcher). One of Shaw's favorite
ideas is that things are often not
what they seem—they are really
the opposite. The Inquisitor is the
man who condemns Joan to the
stake, and he is at once the most
dispassionate and compassionate
character in the play. He
condemns her to save the church,
which is mankind's only hope of
escaping the fires of everlasting
hell, but he hates doing it—really
hates doing it. Excommunicating
Joan (the Church does not burn
her—the civil authorities do that)
is for him the lesser of two great
evils. The Inquisitor dominates
the second act, and Mr. Doyle
plays him with great charm and
power.
I must mention the sets by
Robert Fletcher and the costumes
by Walter Watson, all of which are
beautiful and elaborate and add
significantly to the show.
This is the best production I
have ever seen at ACT. It was a
pleasure to watch, a pleasure to
recall, and a pleasure to review. I
urge you to see it. Student rush
tickets are available just prior to
curtain, but when I saw it on a
Wednesday night it appeared to be
sold out, so check with the
theater beforehand. But go even if
you have to pay full price—this
play is worth it.

seems more like lengthy
philosophy written in the form of

low brow Plato.
Shaw was a wordy
fellow —almost every one of his
plays has an introduction or a

stage directions are almost as good
as his dialogue, and sometimes
one wonders why he bothered
writing the play at all, seeing as
how he seemed to have so much

something rather different from
George Bernard Shaw in a book.
On paper Shaw is erudite and
witty; on stage he is exciting and
funny—very funny. When we read
Shaw in the classroom we are
really reading Shaw as a
philosopher—his plays are buried
in so much extraneous material
we really can't help it. But when
we go to the theater we see Shaw
the playwright—and Shavian
drama well done is wondrous to
behold.
What makes ACT's production
of "Saint Joan" so successful is
that the director, Edward Gilbert,
seems to have understood what
Shaw was saying and doing in
each scene, and then staged it in
such a clear and dynamic way that
the wit, intelligence and irony of

the script shines like a beautiful
star on the stage.
No Tricks
Mr. Gilbert does not resort to
tricks; he does not interpolate
contemporary politics, social
commentary, yesterday's weather
report, or anything else into the
play. He has done his best to
arrange things so that Shaw can
speak for himself, and as might be
expected from such a radical
decision, the result is a brilliant
theatrical experience.
Mr. Gilbert has been helped
out in almost every department.
His cast is generally excellent,
with small deviations to either
side.
Joan Superb
Kitty Winn has the difficult
part of Joan; she is superb. The
character of Joan exists on many
levels in the play—Joan the
country girl turned soldier, Joan
the symbol of the approaching
Reformation and rising
nationalism, and Joan the symbol
of what men both worship and
fear—a martyr.
Together Mr. Gilbert and Miss
Winn have made Joan all that
Shaw meant her to be. She is a
strong character, simple and
single-minded. She does not
change much throughout the
play—just enough to let you know
that she's real. For Shaw, and for
Shaw's characters, Joan represents
forces of social change which she
is totally unable to recognize or
understand.
Miss Winn makes us believe in
Joan the Maid, in Joan the Saint,
and in Joan the prophet of social
upheaval, and while the character
remains basically unchanged, she
stands for more and more as the
play goes on. It is a difficult task,
and Miss Winn does a beautiful
job.
Ego Involvement
Ellis Rabb plays The Dauphin
whom Joan crowns King Charles
VII in Rheims. His performance is
somewhat more stylized than I
would like to see —the part of The
Dauphin is a juicy one, and Mr.
Rabb seems to be enjoying the
juice a bit too much for the good
of the play.
Ray Reinhardt as Richard de
Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and
Ken Ruta as Peter Cauchon,
Bishop of Beauvais, are both
brilliant as representatives of the
fifteenth century Establishment
which Joan, and the ideas she
unknowingly represents, is
threatening. Together with Tom
Wheatley as the Chaplain de
Stogumber, they have a very long,
very talky scene in the first act in
which Mr. Shaw's philosophy and
wit are given their major
exhibition.

All three do credit to
themselves, to Mr. Shaw, to his
play, and to their audience.
G. Wood as the Archbishop of
Rheims gives his role dignity and
depth, making the Archbishop a
rather attractive character. Paul
Shenar does a lot better as the
soldier Dunoir, Bastard of
Orleans, then he does as Oedipus,
the King of Thebes in another
ACT production. He is the closest
thing to a romantic lead in this
show, and he carries it off quite
well.
Jay Doyle played The
Inquisitor the night I saw the
show (he alternates with Robert
Fletcher). One of Shaw's favorite
ideas is that things are often not
what they seem—they are really
the opposite. The Inquisitor is the
man who condemns Joan to the
stake, and he is at once the most
dispassionate and compassionate
character in the play. He
condemns her to save the church,
which is mankind's only hope of
escaping the fires of everlasting
hell, but he hates doing it—really
hates doing it. Excommunicating
Joan (the Church does not burn
her—the civil authorities do that)
is for him the lesser of two great
evils. The Inquisitor dominates
the second act, and Mr. Doyle
plays him with great charm and
power.
I must mention the sets by
Robert Fletcher and the costumes
by Walter Watson, all of which are
beautiful and elaborate and add
significantly to the show.
This is the best production I
have ever seen at ACT. It was a
pleasure to watch, a pleasure to
recall, and a pleasure to review. I
urge you to see it. Student rush
tickets are available just prior to
curtain, but when I saw it on a
Wednesday night it appeared to be
sold out, so check with the
theater beforehand. But go even if
you have to pay full price—this
play is worth it.
One day when George Bernard
Shaw was puttering around the
house with nothing to do,
somebody suggested that he write
a play about Joan of Arc. So he
wrote a play about the
Renaissance, the rise of
Nationalism, the decline of the
Church, the conceit of
Englishmen, the selfishness and
simplicity of Man, set it in
fifteenth century France, and
called it "Saint Joan." You can
see it for yourself at the Geary
Theater in San Francisco, where
ACT's brilliant production is
running in reportory for the next
few months.

Shaw in the classroom we are
really reading Shaw as a
philosopher—his plays are buried
in so much extraneous material
we really can't help it. But when
we go to the theater we see Shaw
the playwright—and Shavian
drama well done is wondrous to
behold.
What makes ACT's production
of "Saint Joan" so successful is
that the director, Edward Gilbert,
seems to have understood what
Shaw was saying and doing in
each scene, and then staged it in
such a clear and dynamic way that
the wit, intelligence and irony of

the script shines like a beautiful
star on the stage.
No Tricks
Mr. Gilbert does not resort to
tricks; he does not interpolate
contemporary politics, social
commentary, yesterday's weather
report, or anything else into the
play. He has done his best to
arrange things so that Shaw can
speak for himself, and as might be
expected from such a radical
decision, the result is a brilliant
theatrical experience.
Mr. Gilbert has been helped
out in almost every department.
His cast is generally excellent,
with small deviations to either
side.
Joan Superb
Kitty Winn has the difficult
part of Joan; she is superb. The
character of Joan exists on many
levels in the play—Joan the
country girl turned soldier, Joan
the symbol of the approaching
Reformation and rising
nationalism, and Joan the symbol
of what men both worship and
fear—a martyr.
Together Mr. Gilbert and Miss
Winn have made Joan all that
Shaw meant her to be. She is a
strong character, simple and
single-minded. She does not
change much throughout the
play—just enough to let you know
that she's real. For Shaw, and for
Shaw's characters, Joan represents
forces of social change which she
is totally unable to recognize or
understand.
Miss Winn makes us believe in
Joan the Maid, in Joan the Saint,
and in Joan the prophet of social
upheaval, and while the character
remains basically unchanged, she
stands for more and more as the
play goes on. It is a difficult task,
and Miss Winn does a beautiful
job.
Ego Involvement
Ellis Rabb plays The Dauphin
whom Joan crowns King Charles
VII in Rheims. His performance is
somewhat more stylized than I
would like to see —the part of The
Dauphin is a juicy one, and Mr.
Rabb seems to be enjoying the
juice a bit too much for the good
of the play.
Ray Reinhardt as Richard de
Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and
Ken Ruta as Peter Cauchon,
Bishop of Beauvais, are both
brilliant as representatives of the
fifteenth century Establishment
which Joan, and the ideas she
unknowingly represents, is
threatening. Together with Tom
Wheatley as the Chaplain de
Stogumber, they have a very long,
very talky scene in the first act in
which Mr. Shaw's philosophy and
wit are given their major
exhibition.

All three do credit to
themselves, to Mr. Shaw, to his
play, and to their audience.
G. Wood as the Archbishop of
Rheims gives his role dignity and
depth, making the Archbishop a
rather attractive character. Paul
Shenar does a lot better as the
soldier Dunoir, Bastard of
Orleans, then he does as Oedipus,
the King of Thebes in another
ACT production. He is the closest
thing to a romantic lead in this
show, and he carries it off quite
well.
Jay Doyle played The
Inquisitor the night I saw the
show (he alternates with Robert
Fletcher). One of Shaw's favorite
ideas is that things are often not
what they seem—they are really
the opposite. The Inquisitor is the
man who condemns Joan to the
stake, and he is at once the most
dispassionate and compassionate
character in the play. He
condemns her to save the church,
which is mankind's only hope of
escaping the fires of everlasting
hell, but he hates doing it—really
hates doing it. Excommunicating
Joan (the Church does not burn
her—the civil authorities do that)
is for him the lesser of two great
evils. The Inquisitor dominates
the second act, and Mr. Doyle
plays him with great charm and
power.
I must mention the sets by
Robert Fletcher and the costumes
by Walter Watson, all of which are
beautiful and elaborate and add
significantly to the show.
This is the best production I
have ever seen at ACT. It was a
pleasure to watch, a pleasure to
recall, and a pleasure to review. I
urge you to see it. Student rush
tickets are available just prior to
curtain, but when I saw it on a
Wednesday night it appeared to be
sold out, so check with the
theater beforehand. But go even if
you have to pay full price—this
play is worth it.
One day when George Bernard
Shaw was puttering around the
house with nothing to do,
somebody suggested that he write
a play about Joan of Arc. So he
wrote a play about the
Renaissance, the rise of
Nationalism, the decline of the
Church, the conceit of
Englishmen, the selfishness and
simplicity of Man, set it in
fifteenth century France, and
called it "Saint Joan." You can
see it for yourself at the Geary
Theater in San Francisco, where
ACT's brilliant production is
running in reportory for the next
few months.
It's probably a good bet that
every student at Stanford at some
time in his academic career is
exposed to G. B. Shaw in printed
form. On paper Shavian drama
seems more like lengthy
philosophy written in the form of
dialogue than like drama—sort of
low brow Plato.
Shaw was a wordy
fellow —almost every one of his
plays has an introduction or a
postscript; some have both. His
stage directions are almost as good
as his dialogue, and sometimes
one wonders why he bothered
writing the play at all, seeing as
how he seemed to have so much
fun with the peripheral material.
Urama Is Wondrous
The answer is that George
Bernard Shaw on stage if.
