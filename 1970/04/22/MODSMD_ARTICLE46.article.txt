# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Spotty SF Showing 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
The San Francisco Symphony presented a
typical program last Wednesay night, a delicate
mixture of the mundane and the enjoyable. The
occasion was an uninspired string orchestra version
of Beethoven's "Grosse Fugue," a lifeless reading
of Elgar's "Cello Concerto," and a remarkably
powerful presentation of Carl Nielson's "Fourth
Symphony."
The concert opened with a laconic rendition of
one of Beethoven's most intense works. Originally
intended as the finale of the Opus 130 string
Quartet, Beethoven replaced it (at the publisher's
request) by a lighter and more traditional
movement. In musical limbo since then, it was
given a new opus number (133), a new title, and
numerous new arrangements by Beethoven and
others.
Conceived as a piece for four musicians, it was
clear even to Beethoven that its large scope
demanded more musicians. Some arrangers have
mistakenly believed that filling the stage with
strings is required.
This dilution of responsibility is not what
Beethoven intended, and it makes for an
uncommitted and lackadaisical performance. Such
was the effect of the production under the guest
baton of Maestro Jean Martinon, musical director
of the L'Orchestre de Paris.
The purity and complexity of the Beethoven
quartets is one of the real thrills in music. They
can be appreciated intellectually in following the
four separate lines as they intertwine and oppose,
or emotionally in just listening to the patterns of
the music. The Symphony's "Grosse Fugue" could
not be understood either way, since the individual
lines were muddled by the overpopulation on the
stage, and the musicians lacked the intense feeling
generated within a smaller group. The notes were
accurately played, but the insight was missing. It
was as if they were reading out loud a language
thev could not understand.
Robert Sayre has been a fine Principal Cellist
lor the Symphony, but he remains an
undistinguished soloist. The choice of the Elgar
Concerto was perhaps made in order to contrast its
subtlety with the directness of the Nielson to
follow, or perhaps because it is not particularly
difficult, but in any case, it was an ill-made
decision.
Sayre should search for a concerto which
demans no notes higher than the fifth position,
since the three or four in-tune notes he did not in
the upper positions were most likely due to
chance.
In this technically feeble performance, Sayre's
three and four-string pizzicatos stand out as

particularly deserving of scorn; for the patrons in
the balcony, his flamboyant strum was all that
signaled a chord, since they were too poorly struck
to carry.
The one bright spot in the solo came with the
long C-string glissando. Not only was it
well-played, but it heralded the completion of the
cjncerto within lour bars.
The post-intermission performance of Carl
Nielsen's symphony known as "The
Inextinguishable," was a welcome surprise. Nielsen
employs the best of the innovations made by the
Romantic/Impressionist school in delivering a very
specific, although well-worn, message: the spirit, of
M;tn is indominable. In this symphony, and in the
Fifth which he completed five and a half years
later, Nielsen sets up tensions between keys and
groups of instruments, which lead either to
resolution (sunny chordal passages) or vicious,
rending antagonisms.
These struggles gain power from the conflict
between two sets of tympani on opposite sides of
the stage. M. Martinon exploited this effect to the
fullest, with excellent results.
At the finale, the rabid kettledrums rejoin the
musicians in a paen to life. Although the
obviousness of all of this may seem childish,
Nielsen's score and Martinon's direction made it
effective.
While the "Fifth Symphony" presents the same
message as the Fourth, it has a subtlety that makes
it especially attractive. I mention it here because
Nonesuch Records has just released a recording of
the Fifth with one of the greatest conductors of
our time, Jascha Horenstein, leading the New
Philharmonia Orchestra.
This is the first Horenstein to have been
released in some time, and it is masterfully done.
My only criticism would be that the snare drum
(representing the tympani from the Fourth) is left
too much in the background.

The one bright spot in the solo came with the
long C-string glissando. Not only was it
well-played, but it heralded the completion of the

The post-intermission performance of Carl
Nielsen's symphony known as "The
Inextinguishable," was a welcome surprise. Nielsen
employs the best of the innovations made by the
Romantic/Impressionist school in delivering a very
specific, although well-worn, message: the spirit, of
M;tn is indominable. In this symphony, and in the
Fifth which he completed five and a half years
later, Nielsen sets up tensions between keys and
groups of instruments, which lead either to
resolution (sunny chordal passages) or vicious,
rending antagonisms.
These struggles gain power from the conflict
between two sets of tympani on opposite sides of
the stage. M. Martinon exploited this effect to the
fullest, with excellent results.
At the finale, the rabid kettledrums rejoin the
musicians in a paen to life. Although the
obviousness of all of this may seem childish,
Nielsen's score and Martinon's direction made it
effective.
While the "Fifth Symphony" presents the same
message as the Fourth, it has a subtlety that makes
it especially attractive. I mention it here because
Nonesuch Records has just released a recording of
the Fifth with one of the greatest conductors of
our time, Jascha Horenstein, leading the New
Philharmonia Orchestra.
This is the first Horenstein to have been
released in some time, and it is masterfully done.
My only criticism would be that the snare drum
(representing the tympani from the Fourth) is left
too much in the background.
The San Francisco Symphony presented a
typical program last Wednesay night, a delicate
mixture of the mundane and the enjoyable. The
occasion was an uninspired string orchestra version
of Beethoven's "Grosse Fugue," a lifeless reading
of Elgar's "Cello Concerto," and a remarkably
powerful presentation of Carl Nielson's "Fourth
Symphony."
The concert opened with a laconic rendition of
one of Beethoven's most intense works. Originally
intended as the finale of the Opus 130 string
Quartet, Beethoven replaced it (at the publisher's
request) by a lighter and more traditional
movement. In musical limbo since then, it was
given a new opus number (133), a new title, and
numerous new arrangements by Beethoven and
others.
Conceived as a piece for four musicians, it was
clear even to Beethoven that its large scope
demanded more musicians. Some arrangers have
mistakenly believed that filling the stage with
strings is required.
This dilution of responsibility is not what
Beethoven intended, and it makes for an
uncommitted and lackadaisical performance. Such
was the effect of the production under the guest
baton of Maestro Jean Martinon, musical director
of the L'Orchestre de Paris.
The purity and complexity of the Beethoven
quartets is one of the real thrills in music. They
can be appreciated intellectually in following the
four separate lines as they intertwine and oppose,
or emotionally in just listening to the patterns of
the music. The Symphony's "Grosse Fugue" could
not be understood either way, since the individual
lines were muddled by the overpopulation on the
stage, and the musicians lacked the intense feeling
generated within a smaller group. The notes were
accurately played, but the insight was missing. It
was as if they were reading out loud a language
thev could not understand.
Robert Sayre has been a fine Principal Cellist
lor the Symphony, but he remains an
undistinguished soloist. The choice of the Elgar
Concerto was perhaps made in order to contrast its
subtlety with the directness of the Nielson to
follow, or perhaps because it is not particularly
difficult, but in any case, it was an ill-made
decision.
Sayre should search for a concerto which
demans no notes higher than the fifth position,
since the three or four in-tune notes he did not in
the upper positions were most likely due to
chance.
In this technically feeble performance, Sayre's
three and four-string pizzicatos stand out as

particularly deserving of scorn; for the patrons in
the balcony, his flamboyant strum was all that
signaled a chord, since they were too poorly struck
to carry.
