# 500 Pledge Solidarity For Sit-In
## 
### 
Close to 500 members of the
Stanford community have signed
a solidarity statement pledging to
sit-in on Thursday according to
Biron Georgiou, a member of the
anti-ROTC movement.
"We expect 1000 people to
show up at the meeting on
Thursday," said Georgiou. "The
more people who show up, the
better the type of action which
can be taken in terms of acts
which would not be condemned
by the community."
The solidarity statement lists
three demands and reads in part,
"If these demands are not
answered by Thursday noon,
April 23, I will join a sit-in until
they are granted. This statement is
being circulated to show solidarity
for a peaceful open forum of
protest."
The purpose of the petition,
according to Georgiou, is to get an
indication of the amount of
support which the movement will
have during its Thursday action.
The three demands included in
the petition areas follows: 1)
ROTC be ended at Stanford. 2)
All prosecution of anti-ROTC
protestors be dropped in civil
courts and the SJC. 3) Paul
Rupert be allowed to remain a
member of the Stanford
community and the
administration and trustees
rescind the pressures on Judge
Stanley Wei tile to banish Rupert
as a condition of probation.
