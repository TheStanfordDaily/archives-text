# Further Viet Pullout May Mean Lower Draft Calls
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Lower
draft calls are in prospect as a
result of President Nixon's
decision to reduce American
strength in Vietnam by another
150,000 men during the next
year, Pentagon sources reported
Tuesday night.
Draft calls which had been
scheduled to average more than
18,000 men per month this year
could drop as low as 12,000
monthly, officials said.
Th" monthly levels will be
dependent to a large extent on
how soon additional troops begin
leaving Vietnam under the plan

announced by the President
Monday night and how much of
an immediate impact the
withdrawals will have on overall
U.S. military force levels.
U.S. military strength
world-wide is expected to decline
as a result of Nixon's troop order,
but officials said there are no firm
estimates at this point on how
much of a decline is likely.
The lowest monthly draft call
this year was 12,500 in January.
It was followed by 19,000 per
montn in February, March and
April. The recently announced
May quota was 15,000.

this city of 50,000 for two weeks.

scheduled to average more than
18,000 men per month this year
could drop as low as 12,000
monthly, officials said.
Th" monthly levels will be
dependent to a large extent on
how soon additional troops begin
leaving Vietnam under the plan

announced by the President
Monday night and how much of
an immediate impact the
withdrawals will have on overall
U.S. military force levels.
U.S. military strength
world-wide is expected to decline
as a result of Nixon's troop order,
but officials said there are no firm
estimates at this point on how
much of a decline is likely.
The lowest monthly draft call
this year was 12,500 in January.
It was followed by 19,000 per
montn in February, March and
April. The recently announced
May quota was 15,000.
