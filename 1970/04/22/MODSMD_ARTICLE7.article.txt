"This campaign has been an
education for us —an attempt to
campaign without compromising
ourselves or our politics," claims
John Shoch. In keeping to this
dictum, the Shoch-Evers slate has
maintained a characteristic and
firm radical position on all issues.
"In part we want to eliminate
the type of student government
that is designed to co-opt student
leaders and which establishes the
illusion of student power,"
declares Shoch. "In its place we
want to resurrect the aggressive
type of student government that
existed before with Harris and
which will fight to represent
student interests."
Evers feels "The Council of
Presidents see themselves as
conflict-management types, and in
that role they function as adjuncts
of the administration. It's a very
bothersome thing."
Opposition Hit
Both are critical of the Shea
ticket for its failure to deal with
the "fundamental problems—the
ways in which the University
interacts with the society in which
it exists." In Shoch's analysis "as
the economy grew, the University
became more and more dependent
on outside funds. It has grown
close to corporate and
government interests."

Thus Shoch sees "the greatest
single crisis of the University this
year as the financial deficit-lhe
$4 million loss in Defense
Department research funding."
Shoch cites the shift of the
Architecture department into
engineering and the curtailment of
the Speech and Drama departmet
as "effects of our dependence on
outside institutions that are now
being felt."
Both are sensitive to the
criticism that they have ignored
issues such as SWOPSI and other
student services. "I've no
objections to SWOPSI; I think it's
great," says Evers. "But we have a
tuition diversion plan that
obviates the need for SWOPSI
whereby students can get together
and hire their own instructor."
'Wider Context'
Declares Shoch, "we're not
against most of what ASSU does.
The student services, the
committees are fine. We just want
to establish a wider context."
Neither expect to accomplish
their far-reaching goals, but they
hope to point up the areas of
conflict and illustrate the
boundaries of student power. "I
don't think anyone can make
huge progress in one year, but a
start has io be made," says Shoch.
"We can agitate, investigate,
educate. It means, though, that
we won't be invited out to dinner
with President Pitzer, and we
won't be informed over the phone
of the latest trivial reform," he
continued. "What we're aiming
for is a re-examination of what it
means to be a student."
Both feel that ROTC should be
denied credit as well as a place on
campus. On the issue of land
develoiment, Evers feels "the
University ought to receive
income from that land, but I
don't think we need a hothouse
for the military-industrial
complex.

"Our land policy should reflect
the desires and needs of the
people nearby."
'Tangible Issues'
Adds Shoch, "We're running a
campaign with tangible issues such
as land use, overseas campus
reform, the tuition diversion, and
plans for more direct feedback
between professor and student
than just the course review. But at
the same time we have to put
these reforms in a larger context.
'The executive is political, and
that's very important to
remember. You have to recognize
its basic political nature."
Despite the limitations of the
ASSU presidency, Evers is
confidant that "we will
accomplish a great deal by
speaking out strongly. That's what
is meant by our slogan about
speaking truth to power."

tuition diversion plan that
obviates the need for SWOPSI
whereby students can get together
and hire their own instructor."
'Wider Context'
Declares Shoch, "we're not
against most of what ASSU does.
The student services, the
committees are fine. We just want
to establish a wider context."
Neither expect to accomplish
their far-reaching goals, but they
hope to point up the areas of
conflict and illustrate the
boundaries of student power. "I
don't think anyone can make
huge progress in one year, but a
start has io be made," says Shoch.
"We can agitate, investigate,
educate. It means, though, that
we won't be invited out to dinner
with President Pitzer, and we
won't be informed over the phone
of the latest trivial reform," he
continued. "What we're aiming
for is a re-examination of what it
means to be a student."
Both feel that ROTC should be
denied credit as well as a place on
campus. On the issue of land
develoiment, Evers feels "the
University ought to receive
income from that land, but I
don't think we need a hothouse
for the military-industrial
complex.

"Our land policy should reflect
the desires and needs of the
people nearby."
'Tangible Issues'
Adds Shoch, "We're running a
campaign with tangible issues such
as land use, overseas campus
reform, the tuition diversion, and
plans for more direct feedback
between professor and student
than just the course review. But at
the same time we have to put
these reforms in a larger context.
'The executive is political, and
that's very important to
remember. You have to recognize
its basic political nature."
Despite the limitations of the
ASSU presidency, Evers is
confidant that "we will
accomplish a great deal by
speaking out strongly. That's what
is meant by our slogan about
speaking truth to power."

"This campaign has been an
education for us —an attempt to
campaign without compromising
ourselves or our politics," claims
John Shoch. In keeping to this
dictum, the Shoch-Evers slate has
maintained a characteristic and
firm radical position on all issues.
"In part we want to eliminate
the type of student government
that is designed to co-opt student
leaders and which establishes the
illusion of student power,"
declares Shoch. "In its place we
want to resurrect the aggressive
type of student government that
existed before with Harris and
which will fight to represent
student interests."
Evers feels "The Council of
Presidents see themselves as
conflict-management types, and in
that role they function as adjuncts
of the administration. It's a very
bothersome thing."
Opposition Hit
Both are critical of the Shea
ticket for its failure to deal with
the "fundamental problems—the
ways in which the University
interacts with the society in which
it exists." In Shoch's analysis "as
the economy grew, the University
became more and more dependent
on outside funds. It has grown
close to corporate and
government interests."

Thus Shoch sees "the greatest
single crisis of the University this
year as the financial deficit-lhe
$4 million loss in Defense
Department research funding."
Shoch cites the shift of the
Architecture department into
engineering and the curtailment of
the Speech and Drama departmet
as "effects of our dependence on
outside institutions that are now
being felt."
Both are sensitive to the
criticism that they have ignored
issues such as SWOPSI and other
student services. "I've no
objections to SWOPSI; I think it's
great," says Evers. "But we have a
tuition diversion plan that
obviates the need for SWOPSI
whereby students can get together
and hire their own instructor."
