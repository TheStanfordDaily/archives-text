# Candidates Debate
## 
### 
The opposing slates in the
ASSU presidential run-off, slated
for today and tomorrow, met for
a lengthy debate last night in
KZSU's Memorial Auditorium
studios.
The debate, which started at
8:30, will be rebroadcast tonight
starting at 8 p.m.
The Shea-Grant-Michelson-
Levin ticket decided earlier that it
would not meet with the
Shoch-Evers slate yesterday
afternoon in the Tresidder large
lounge in a public debate, saying
that Shoch and Evers intended to
use the forum for a publicity
stunt instead of a serious debate.
Last night's debate began as
Bob Grant presented the
Shea-Grant-Michelson-Levin
opening statement. Grant said
that there are three basic issues in
the year's campaign: the position
of Stanford in the "world," the
prospects for "purposeful
academics," and the thrust behind
representative government.
The statement supported
minority student recruitment, the
Nader GM proposal, SWOPSI, the
Student Center for Innovation,
course evaluation, and
representative government for all
members of the Stanford
community.
Speaking extemporaneously,
Evers, in the other opening
statement, maintained that
Grant's presentation did not
include any new educational
reform. He said that he and Shoch
had advanced a "tuition diversion
plan" to provide greater student
participation in determining
course content. He stated that the
slate would work primarily to
influence the University's
relationships with all facets of
society.
Questionning
.In response to questions
offered by newsmen and listeners
calling into the station, Grant said
that he considered the
constituencies of the University to
be administrators, faculty,
students and staff. Shoch said that
his list was incomplete and
advocated that members of the
community at large be included as
a University constituency.
In response to another
question, Evers said that he might
support an "educational sit-in."
He added that the Shea ticket was
"attempting character slander
through association. We did not
and have not supported the recent
rock-throwing."
Another major issue discussed
was the political stand that ASSU
should assume. Levin had stated
earlier that the organization
should be "depoliticized." It must
first be strengthened, he explained
further so that political positions
can be assumed based on a strong
degree of internal support.
Minority Miring
The issue of minority hiring
was also raised. Grant stated that
he went to the Planning Office in
January to urge implementation
of the Affirmative External
Action program for minority
hiring. Shoch supported
the program but said that the
program's effects on Stanford
employees efforts to unionize
should also be considered.
Shoch stated in response to
another question that he and
Evers had telegrammed ( the
Academic Senate Steering
Committee immediately after the
student referendum on ROTC.
They urged faculty

reconsideration' of the credit issue.
Shea said that a more viable
plan would be to go directly to
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies since this group will
consider the que tion
immediately.
Tresidder Meeting
Shoch and Evers presented
their views on some of the issues
of the presidential campaign
yesterday at 4:15 p.m. in the
Tresidder large lounge.
Bennett Cullum, a member of
the Shea-Grant-Mickelson -Levin
campaign staff, presented a
prepared statement to the
gathering. He said a suitable
arrangement for an afternoon
debate was not renegotiated
before las night's "challenge to
debate" paper was distributed to
the dorm. He also expressed a fear
that the issues could be clouded in
an open debate due to "public
hoop-la." He stated that the
debate on KZSU would be
adequate.
Cullum did not answer any
questions and left the room
immediately after presentation of
his statement.
F ear?
Shoch and Evers then
commented on Cullum's
statement. "They have a paranoid
fear of meeting the public,"
Shoch said. "They will probably
continue this behind-the-door
type of politics if they are
elected."
Mickelson had agreed to an
open debate Sunday but Bob
Grant, who had not been
consulted, later reneged on this
promise.
Shoch and Evers repeatedly
emphasized that the Council's
version of student politics is not
broad enough.
In response to another
question Evers clarified his
political position. He stated that
he was a "radical libertarian" in
the tradition of Dave Harris.

ASSU presidential run-off, slated
for today and tomorrow, met for
a lengthy debate last night in
KZSU's Memorial Auditorium
studios.
The debate, which started at
8:30, will be rebroadcast tonight
starting at 8 p.m.
The Shea-Grant-Michelson-
Levin ticket decided earlier that it
would not meet with the
Shoch-Evers slate yesterday
afternoon in the Tresidder large
lounge in a public debate, saying
that Shoch and Evers intended to
use the forum for a publicity
stunt instead of a serious debate.
Last night's debate began as
Bob Grant presented the
Shea-Grant-Michelson-Levin
opening statement. Grant said
that there are three basic issues in
the year's campaign: the position
of Stanford in the "world," the
prospects for "purposeful
academics," and the thrust behind
representative government.
The statement supported
minority student recruitment, the
Nader GM proposal, SWOPSI, the
Student Center for Innovation,
course evaluation, and
representative government for all
members of the Stanford
community.
Speaking extemporaneously,
Evers, in the other opening
statement, maintained that
Grant's presentation did not
include any new educational
reform. He said that he and Shoch
had advanced a "tuition diversion
plan" to provide greater student
participation in determining
course content. He stated that the
slate would work primarily to
influence the University's
relationships with all facets of
society.
Questionning
.In response to questions
offered by newsmen and listeners
calling into the station, Grant said
that he considered the
constituencies of the University to
be administrators, faculty,
students and staff. Shoch said that
his list was incomplete and
advocated that members of the
community at large be included as
a University constituency.
In response to another
question, Evers said that he might
support an "educational sit-in."
He added that the Shea ticket was
"attempting character slander
through association. We did not
and have not supported the recent
rock-throwing."
Another major issue discussed
was the political stand that ASSU
should assume. Levin had stated
earlier that the organization
should be "depoliticized." It must
first be strengthened, he explained
further so that political positions
can be assumed based on a strong
degree of internal support.
Minority Miring
The issue of minority hiring
was also raised. Grant stated that
he went to the Planning Office in
January to urge implementation
of the Affirmative External
Action program for minority
hiring. Shoch supported
the program but said that the
program's effects on Stanford
employees efforts to unionize
should also be considered.
Shoch stated in response to
another question that he and
Evers had telegrammed ( the
Academic Senate Steering
Committee immediately after the
student referendum on ROTC.
They urged faculty

reconsideration' of the credit issue.
Shea said that a more viable
plan would be to go directly to
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies since this group will
consider the que tion
immediately.
Tresidder Meeting
Shoch and Evers presented
their views on some of the issues
of the presidential campaign
yesterday at 4:15 p.m. in the
Tresidder large lounge.
Bennett Cullum, a member of
the Shea-Grant-Mickelson -Levin
campaign staff, presented a
prepared statement to the
gathering. He said a suitable
arrangement for an afternoon
debate was not renegotiated
before las night's "challenge to
debate" paper was distributed to
the dorm. He also expressed a fear
that the issues could be clouded in
an open debate due to "public
hoop-la." He stated that the
debate on KZSU would be
adequate.
Cullum did not answer any
questions and left the room
immediately after presentation of
his statement.
F ear?
Shoch and Evers then
commented on Cullum's
statement. "They have a paranoid
fear of meeting the public,"
Shoch said. "They will probably
continue this behind-the-door
type of politics if they are
elected."
Mickelson had agreed to an
open debate Sunday but Bob
Grant, who had not been
consulted, later reneged on this
promise.
Shoch and Evers repeatedly
emphasized that the Council's
version of student politics is not
broad enough.
In response to another
question Evers clarified his
political position. He stated that
he was a "radical libertarian" in
the tradition of Dave Harris.
The opposing slates in the
ASSU presidential run-off, slated
for today and tomorrow, met for
