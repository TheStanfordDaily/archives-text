.................. Today
Four hundred and six years ago today, William
Shakespeare, who may or may not have written the works
attributed to him, may have been born. (There does exist a
record of Shakespeare's baptism.)
In "Henry IV," the King's deathbed advice to Prince
Hal is an exposition of the strategy followed by many
contemporary national leaders: using foreign crusades to
deflect attention from domestic difficulties. . had a
purpose now/To lead out many to the Holy Land,/Lest
rest and lying still might make them look/Too near until
my state. Therefore, my Harry,/Be it thy course, to busy
giddy minds/With foreign quarrels; that action hence borne
outj May waste the memory of the former days. "
