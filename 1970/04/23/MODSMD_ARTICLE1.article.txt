# Noon Rally Today
## ROTC Sit-In Probable 
### 
The Off-ROTC movement has
called a rally for 12:30 in White
Plaza to discuss how to react to
President Pitzer's reply to the
ultimatum issued last Monday
night. A sit-in is contemplated by
much of the group.
Yesterday evening, Pitzer
issued a statement responding to
the ultimatum's demand that
ROTC be ended immediately. He
said, in effect, that the anti-ROTC
sentiment expressed in last week's
referendum came too late to
affect the University's
commitments to keep Army
ROTC this year. Therefore, the
present agreement granting
limited credit will be honored.
Pitzer had been given until
noon today by the Off-ROTC
movement to answer the three
demands of the ultimatum. The
group also demanded that the
University drop all prosecution of

anti-ROTC protestors both in civil
court and in the SJC; that Paul
Rupert be allowed to remain at
Stanford; and that the University
rescind pressures on Judge Stanley
Weigel to banish Rupert as a
condition of probation.
In reply to these demands
Provost Richard Lyman said
Monday that the University has
"no intention" of granting
amnesty and that charges that the
University had pressured Weigle
were "completely untrue."
Today's rally has been called to
discuss "appropriate action" in
response to the rejection of the
ultimatum. According to Byron
Georgiou, spokesman for the
Off-ROTC group, "The consensus
of the movement at the present
time is for a non-violent,
non-disruptive, sit-in." He said
that about 1000 people are
expected, although past rallies

have drawn crowds of only 100 to
200.
The movement claims that 500
people have signed a solidarity
statement, which reads in part:
"I will join a sit-in until the
demands of the ultimatum are
granted. This statement is being
circulated to show solidarity for a
peaceful open forum of protest."
Some discussions in dorms (in
Arroyo Monday night, for
example) have been concerned
with how to keep the prospective
sit-in non-violent.
. However, not all anti-ROTC
actions this week have been quite
so sedentary. Tuesday night, an
obscene sign was painted on the
door of the President's office, and
"Off-ROTC" was sprayed in red
IVi-foot letters on the back of his
house. In addition, more than
forty locks were fouled at the
Food Research Institute, Naval
ROTC, Encina Hall, Hoover
Tower, and the Durand Building.
As yet, the target for the sit-in
has not been settled. However,
sites most frequently discussed
have been the Old Student Union,
Encina, or the ROTC building.
