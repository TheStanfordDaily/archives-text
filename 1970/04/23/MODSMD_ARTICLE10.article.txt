## Population And Environment 
### Dudley Kirk 
Everyone is concerned about
our environment; everyone would
like to do something about it. But
WHAT to do is not so easy. Some
proposed solutions are good, some
are not thought through clearly.
One of the simplistic answers
given for the United States is to
check our "indiscriminate
breeding." This assumes (a) that
we do in fact have "indiscriminate
breeding," (b) that this is the
chief cause of pollution, and (c)
that the situation calls for drastic
measures to restrict births. All of
these tend to be accepted as
"self-evident." Actually they are
highly dubious.
On the first point, we clearly
do not have "indiscriminate
breeding." We have the lowest
birth rate in our entire history,
with 85-90 percent of our couples
practicing birth control. The birth
rate has fallen continuously and
rapidly since 1957 and the
number of births since 1962. It is
clear that the American people
were making an adjustment to the
situation well before the louder
shouters on the subject came on
the scene. Shrinkage of
elementary school enrollment has
already begun and primary
schools are being abandoned for
lack of need. Later, of course, this
trend will spread to high schools.
Zero Population Growth
This does not mean that zero
population growth is in immediate
possibility or indeed even a
desirable goal for the near future.
To attain it would mean cutting
our present low birth rate almost
in half and reducing the average
number of children of the present
generation of young couples to a
little over one child per couple.
But in the more sophisticated
terms of generation replacement
we are moving toward unity; if we
could eliminate the 20 percent
unwanted births that occur today
(many more if we included
unwanted premarital pregnancies)
we would have reached the level
of replacement, a reasonable
target, and in the longer run zero
population growth.
The idea that national
population size and growth is
chiefly responsible for pollution
does not stand up under scientific
analysis, as pointed out by Barry
Commoner, distinguished
biologist-ecologist. Sydney,
Australia, for example, has much
the same problems of pollution as
the Bay region—smog, traffic
jams, urban sprawl, pollution of
the harbor—this in a country of
continental size with only 12
million people, as compared with
our 200 million. Conversely
countries with 10 times our
population density (the United
Kingdom) and even some 20 times
(Belgium and the Netherlands)
have less pollution than the
United States.
Population Distribution
Pollution is the product of our
population DISTRIBUTION,
specifically our crowding into a
few metrpolitan areas and into
favored areas like California.
Seventy percent of our people
now live in less than two percent
of our area. More than half the
area of the United States is
suffering from DEpopulation.
Even more, pollution is the
product of our affluence and
mismanagement of technology.
The use of nitrogen fertilizer,
pesticides, fuels, gasoline and
other pollutants has grown much
faster than our population. It is
very doubtful that the use of
DDT, for example, would have
been much different if we had had
a population of 150 million or of
250 million rather lhan the actual
200 million. DDT and other

pesticides and herbicides are
simply efficient methods of
reducing costs of agricultural
production.
Economics of Population
As a country of agricultural
surplus, and potentially much
greater surpluses, we do not have
a desperate need to use these
pollutants—it is simply a matter of
the economics of production. The
idea that we could not feed a
larger population is fatuous; for
over a generation we have been
paying farmers billions of dollars
to keep many millions of acres of
good land out of production,
simply because they aren't
needed.
A substantial population
growth in the U.S. before the
achievement of zero population
growth at the end of the century
is almost inevitable. Such is the
inertia imposed by the large
numbers of young people in our
population, the heritage of the
baby boom after World War 11.
But this is scarcely catastrophic.
An increase of national
population of one percent a year
will not be a major factor in the
increase or solution of pollution.
We cannot meet our pressing
and immediate environmental
problems by reducing the birth
rate. All projections of future
pollution without counteraction
far outrun one percent a year. To
take a single example, it is
estimated that our needs for
electric power will double in the
next decade. Less than 20 percent
of this could in any way be
attributed to population growth.
If zero population growth could
be achieved right now it would
affect less than one-fifth of the
problem. The realistic solutions
are much more immediate and
direct: make the polluters,
including each one of us, reduce
the pollution or pay the social
costs.
Predictions and Reality
Long-term extrapolations
predicting an anthill density of
population in the United States
are merely arithmetic exercises
with no relevance to reality. There
are many social trends that, if
continued, will bring disaster long
before population pressure could.
To take one, the rate of murders
in the United States is said to be
increasing at 7 percent per year. If
this continues the population
problem will be quickly solved.
We have the food, we have the
resources, we have the space in
the U.S. to accommodate the

larger population we will almost
certainly have before we achieve
zero growth. With better
management we can do so with
much less pollution or destruction
of the environment than we have
today.
Dangerous Panaccas
Few of us like crowds; few of
us welcome a much larger
population. Certainly I do not.
Cui bono? Everyone should have
the right and the means of
restricting family size. But some
of the drastic measures proposed
may be more serious than the
disease. Can one think of a more
dangerous pollution than putting
anti-fertility agents in the water
supply? Or a more serious
invasion of private rights than
compulsory sterilization of
persons having more than two
children? Or a more socially
unjust measure than imposing
economic hardships on children in
larger families to motivate their
parents not to have more?
The motivations governing
human reproductive behavior are
quite different from those of
animals. In their simplistic
approach, animal ecologists often
ignore basic aspects of human
motivation and rational action in
their economic and social context.
For this one must consider
economics, agronomy, public
health, technology, social
relationships, things absent from
crude analogies between the
behavior of animals and humans.
Social System
The social system is every bit
as delicate balanced as the
ecosystem. The assumption that a
rationed two-family system would
solve our problems involves a
naive perspective of society in
terms of what parents can give
and what society needs. Many
persons should have no children,
many should have more than two.
The important thing is the quality
of socialization, not the number
of children.
It is indeed tragic that the
present unjustified hysteria about
population growth has induced
many sensitive people not to have
children. Engendering despair for
the wrong reasons is a disservice
when courage and intelligence,
used in proper directions, can
solve many of our environmental
problems. We have great resources
for tackling these problems right
now.

unwanted births that occur today
(many more if we included
unwanted premarital pregnancies)
we would have reached the level
of replacement, a reasonable
target, and in the longer run zero
population growth.
The idea that national
population size and growth is
chiefly responsible for pollution
does not stand up under scientific
analysis, as pointed out by Barry
Commoner, distinguished
biologist-ecologist. Sydney,
Australia, for example, has much
the same problems of pollution as
the Bay region—smog, traffic
jams, urban sprawl, pollution of
the harbor—this in a country of
continental size with only 12
million people, as compared with
our 200 million. Conversely
countries with 10 times our
population density (the United
Kingdom) and even some 20 times
(Belgium and the Netherlands)
have less pollution than the
United States.
Population Distribution
Pollution is the product of our
population DISTRIBUTION,
specifically our crowding into a
few metrpolitan areas and into
favored areas like California.
Seventy percent of our people
now live in less than two percent
of our area. More than half the
area of the United States is
suffering from DEpopulation.
Even more, pollution is the
product of our affluence and
mismanagement of technology.
The use of nitrogen fertilizer,
pesticides, fuels, gasoline and
other pollutants has grown much
faster than our population. It is
very doubtful that the use of
DDT, for example, would have
been much different if we had had
a population of 150 million or of
250 million rather lhan the actual
200 million. DDT and other

pesticides and herbicides are
simply efficient methods of
reducing costs of agricultural
production.
Economics of Population
As a country of agricultural
surplus, and potentially much
greater surpluses, we do not have
a desperate need to use these
pollutants—it is simply a matter of
the economics of production. The
idea that we could not feed a
larger population is fatuous; for
over a generation we have been
paying farmers billions of dollars
to keep many millions of acres of
good land out of production,
simply because they aren't
needed.
A substantial population
growth in the U.S. before the
achievement of zero population
growth at the end of the century
is almost inevitable. Such is the
inertia imposed by the large
numbers of young people in our
population, the heritage of the
baby boom after World War 11.
But this is scarcely catastrophic.
An increase of national
population of one percent a year
will not be a major factor in the
increase or solution of pollution.
We cannot meet our pressing
and immediate environmental
problems by reducing the birth
rate. All projections of future
pollution without counteraction
far outrun one percent a year. To
take a single example, it is
estimated that our needs for
electric power will double in the
next decade. Less than 20 percent
of this could in any way be
attributed to population growth.
If zero population growth could
be achieved right now it would
affect less than one-fifth of the
problem. The realistic solutions
are much more immediate and
direct: make the polluters,
including each one of us, reduce
the pollution or pay the social
costs.
Predictions and Reality
Long-term extrapolations
predicting an anthill density of
population in the United States
are merely arithmetic exercises
with no relevance to reality. There
are many social trends that, if
continued, will bring disaster long
before population pressure could.
To take one, the rate of murders
in the United States is said to be
increasing at 7 percent per year. If
this continues the population
problem will be quickly solved.
We have the food, we have the
resources, we have the space in
the U.S. to accommodate the

larger population we will almost
certainly have before we achieve
zero growth. With better
management we can do so with
much less pollution or destruction
of the environment than we have
today.
Dangerous Panaccas
Few of us like crowds; few of
us welcome a much larger
population. Certainly I do not.
Cui bono? Everyone should have
the right and the means of
restricting family size. But some
of the drastic measures proposed
may be more serious than the
disease. Can one think of a more
dangerous pollution than putting
anti-fertility agents in the water
supply? Or a more serious
invasion of private rights than
compulsory sterilization of
persons having more than two
children? Or a more socially
unjust measure than imposing
economic hardships on children in
larger families to motivate their
parents not to have more?
The motivations governing
human reproductive behavior are
quite different from those of
animals. In their simplistic
approach, animal ecologists often
ignore basic aspects of human
motivation and rational action in
their economic and social context.
For this one must consider
economics, agronomy, public
health, technology, social
relationships, things absent from
crude analogies between the
behavior of animals and humans.
Social System
The social system is every bit
as delicate balanced as the
ecosystem. The assumption that a
rationed two-family system would
solve our problems involves a
naive perspective of society in
terms of what parents can give
and what society needs. Many
persons should have no children,
many should have more than two.
The important thing is the quality
of socialization, not the number
of children.
It is indeed tragic that the
present unjustified hysteria about
population growth has induced
many sensitive people not to have
children. Engendering despair for
the wrong reasons is a disservice
when courage and intelligence,
used in proper directions, can
solve many of our environmental
problems. We have great resources
for tackling these problems right
now.
(Dudley Kirk is a Professor ol
Demography at the Food
Research Institute.)
Everyone is concerned about
our environment; everyone would
like to do something about it. But
WHAT to do is not so easy. Some
proposed solutions are good, some
are not thought through clearly.
One of the simplistic answers
given for the United States is to
check our "indiscriminate
breeding." This assumes (a) that
we do in fact have "indiscriminate
breeding," (b) that this is the
chief cause of pollution, and (c)
that the situation calls for drastic
measures to restrict births. All of
these tend to be accepted as
"self-evident." Actually they are
highly dubious.
On the first point, we clearly
do not have "indiscriminate
breeding." We have the lowest
birth rate in our entire history,
with 85-90 percent of our couples
practicing birth control. The birth
rate has fallen continuously and
rapidly since 1957 and the
number of births since 1962. It is
clear that the American people
were making an adjustment to the
situation well before the louder
shouters on the subject came on
the scene. Shrinkage of
elementary school enrollment has
already begun and primary
schools are being abandoned for
lack of need. Later, of course, this
trend will spread to high schools.
Zero Population Growth
This does not mean that zero
population growth is in immediate
possibility or indeed even a
desirable goal for the near future.
To attain it would mean cutting
our present low birth rate almost
in half and reducing the average
number of children of the present
generation of young couples to a
little over one child per couple.
But in the more sophisticated
terms of generation replacement
we are moving toward unity; if we
could eliminate the 20 percent
unwanted births that occur today
(many more if we included
unwanted premarital pregnancies)

production.
Economics of Population
As a country of agricultural
surplus, and potentially much
greater surpluses, we do not have
a desperate need to use these
pollutants—it is simply a matter of
the economics of production. The
idea that we could not feed a
larger population is fatuous; for
over a generation we have been
paying farmers billions of dollars
to keep many millions of acres of
good land out of production,
simply because they aren't
needed.
A substantial population
growth in the U.S. before the
achievement of zero population
growth at the end of the century
is almost inevitable. Such is the
inertia imposed by the large
numbers of young people in our
population, the heritage of the
baby boom after World War 11.
But this is scarcely catastrophic.
An increase of national
population of one percent a year
will not be a major factor in the
increase or solution of pollution.
We cannot meet our pressing
and immediate environmental
problems by reducing the birth
rate. All projections of future
pollution without counteraction
far outrun one percent a year. To
take a single example, it is
estimated that our needs for
electric power will double in the
next decade. Less than 20 percent
of this could in any way be
attributed to population growth.
If zero population growth could
be achieved right now it would
affect less than one-fifth of the
problem. The realistic solutions
are much more immediate and
direct: make the polluters,
including each one of us, reduce
the pollution or pay the social
costs.
Predictions and Reality
Long-term extrapolations
predicting an anthill density of
population in the United States
are merely arithmetic exercises
with no relevance to reality. There
are many social trends that, if
continued, will bring disaster long
before population pressure could.
To take one, the rate of murders
in the United States is said to be
increasing at 7 percent per year. If
this continues the population
problem will be quickly solved.
We have the food, we have the
resources, we have the space in
the U.S. to accommodate the

larger population we will almost
certainly have before we achieve
zero growth. With better
management we can do so with
much less pollution or destruction
of the environment than we have
today.
Dangerous Panaccas
Few of us like crowds; few of
us welcome a much larger
population. Certainly I do not.
Cui bono? Everyone should have
the right and the means of
restricting family size. But some
of the drastic measures proposed
may be more serious than the
disease. Can one think of a more
dangerous pollution than putting
anti-fertility agents in the water
supply? Or a more serious
invasion of private rights than
compulsory sterilization of
persons having more than two
children? Or a more socially
unjust measure than imposing
economic hardships on children in
larger families to motivate their
parents not to have more?
The motivations governing
human reproductive behavior are
quite different from those of
animals. In their simplistic
approach, animal ecologists often
ignore basic aspects of human
motivation and rational action in
their economic and social context.
For this one must consider
economics, agronomy, public
health, technology, social
relationships, things absent from
crude analogies between the
behavior of animals and humans.
Social System
The social system is every bit
as delicate balanced as the
ecosystem. The assumption that a
rationed two-family system would
solve our problems involves a
naive perspective of society in
terms of what parents can give
and what society needs. Many
persons should have no children,
many should have more than two.
The important thing is the quality
of socialization, not the number
of children.
It is indeed tragic that the
present unjustified hysteria about
population growth has induced
many sensitive people not to have
children. Engendering despair for
the wrong reasons is a disservice
when courage and intelligence,
used in proper directions, can
solve many of our environmental
problems. We have great resources
for tackling these problems right
now.
(Dudley Kirk is a Professor ol
Demography at the Food
Research Institute.)
Everyone is concerned about
our environment; everyone would
like to do something about it. But
WHAT to do is not so easy. Some
proposed solutions are good, some
are not thought through clearly.
One of the simplistic answers
given for the United States is to
check our "indiscriminate
breeding." This assumes (a) that
we do in fact have "indiscriminate
breeding," (b) that this is the
chief cause of pollution, and (c)
that the situation calls for drastic
measures to restrict births. All of
these tend to be accepted as
"self-evident." Actually they are
highly dubious.
On the first point, we clearly
do not have "indiscriminate
breeding." We have the lowest
birth rate in our entire history,
with 85-90 percent of our couples
practicing birth control. The birth
rate has fallen continuously and
rapidly since 1957 and the
number of births since 1962. It is
clear that the American people
were making an adjustment to the
situation well before the louder
shouters on the subject came on
the scene. Shrinkage of
elementary school enrollment has
already begun and primary
schools are being abandoned for
lack of need. Later, of course, this
trend will spread to high schools.
Zero Population Growth
This does not mean that zero
population growth is in immediate
possibility or indeed even a
desirable goal for the near future.
To attain it would mean cutting
our present low birth rate almost
in half and reducing the average
number of children of the present
generation of young couples to a
little over one child per couple.
But in the more sophisticated
terms of generation replacement
we are moving toward unity; if we
could eliminate the 20 percent
unwanted births that occur today
(many more if we included
unwanted premarital pregnancies)
we would have reached the level
of replacement, a reasonable
target, and in the longer run zero
population growth.
The idea that national
population size and growth is
chiefly responsible for pollution
does not stand up under scientific
analysis, as pointed out by Barry
Commoner, distinguished
biologist-ecologist. Sydney,
Australia, for example, has much
the same problems of pollution as
the Bay region—smog, traffic
jams, urban sprawl, pollution of
the harbor—this in a country of
continental size with only 12
million people, as compared with
our 200 million. Conversely
countries with 10 times our
population density (the United
Kingdom) and even some 20 times
(Belgium and the Netherlands)
have less pollution than the
United States.
Population Distribution
Pollution is the product of our
population DISTRIBUTION,
specifically our crowding into a
few metrpolitan areas and into
favored areas like California.
Seventy percent of our people
now live in less than two percent
of our area. More than half the
area of the United States is
suffering from DEpopulation.
Even more, pollution is the
product of our affluence and
mismanagement of technology.
The use of nitrogen fertilizer,
pesticides, fuels, gasoline and
other pollutants has grown much
faster than our population. It is
very doubtful that the use of
DDT, for example, would have
been much different if we had had
a population of 150 million or of
250 million rather lhan the actual
200 million. DDT and other

pesticides and herbicides are
simply efficient methods of
reducing costs of agricultural
production.

are many social trends that, if
continued, will bring disaster long
before population pressure could.
To take one, the rate of murders
in the United States is said to be
increasing at 7 percent per year. If
this continues the population
problem will be quickly solved.
We have the food, we have the
resources, we have the space in
the U.S. to accommodate the

larger population we will almost
certainly have before we achieve
zero growth. With better
management we can do so with
much less pollution or destruction
of the environment than we have
today.
Dangerous Panaccas
Few of us like crowds; few of
us welcome a much larger
population. Certainly I do not.
Cui bono? Everyone should have
the right and the means of
restricting family size. But some
of the drastic measures proposed
may be more serious than the
disease. Can one think of a more
dangerous pollution than putting
anti-fertility agents in the water
supply? Or a more serious
invasion of private rights than
compulsory sterilization of
persons having more than two
children? Or a more socially
unjust measure than imposing
economic hardships on children in
larger families to motivate their
parents not to have more?
The motivations governing
human reproductive behavior are
quite different from those of
animals. In their simplistic
approach, animal ecologists often
ignore basic aspects of human
motivation and rational action in
their economic and social context.
For this one must consider
economics, agronomy, public
health, technology, social
relationships, things absent from
crude analogies between the
behavior of animals and humans.
Social System
The social system is every bit
as delicate balanced as the
ecosystem. The assumption that a
rationed two-family system would
solve our problems involves a
naive perspective of society in
terms of what parents can give
and what society needs. Many
persons should have no children,
many should have more than two.
The important thing is the quality
of socialization, not the number
of children.
It is indeed tragic that the
present unjustified hysteria about
population growth has induced
many sensitive people not to have
children. Engendering despair for
the wrong reasons is a disservice
when courage and intelligence,
used in proper directions, can
solve many of our environmental
problems. We have great resources
for tackling these problems right
now.

Demography at the Food
Research Institute.)
Everyone is concerned about
our environment; everyone would
like to do something about it. But
WHAT to do is not so easy. Some
proposed solutions are good, some
are not thought through clearly.
One of the simplistic answers
given for the United States is to
check our "indiscriminate
breeding." This assumes (a) that
we do in fact have "indiscriminate
breeding," (b) that this is the
chief cause of pollution, and (c)
that the situation calls for drastic
measures to restrict births. All of
these tend to be accepted as
"self-evident." Actually they are
highly dubious.
On the first point, we clearly
do not have "indiscriminate
breeding." We have the lowest
birth rate in our entire history,
with 85-90 percent of our couples
practicing birth control. The birth
rate has fallen continuously and
rapidly since 1957 and the
number of births since 1962. It is
clear that the American people
were making an adjustment to the
situation well before the louder
shouters on the subject came on
the scene. Shrinkage of
elementary school enrollment has
already begun and primary
schools are being abandoned for
lack of need. Later, of course, this
trend will spread to high schools.
Zero Population Growth
This does not mean that zero
population growth is in immediate
possibility or indeed even a
desirable goal for the near future.
To attain it would mean cutting
our present low birth rate almost
in half and reducing the average
number of children of the present
generation of young couples to a
little over one child per couple.
But in the more sophisticated
terms of generation replacement
we are moving toward unity; if we
could eliminate the 20 percent
unwanted births that occur today
(many more if we included
unwanted premarital pregnancies)
we would have reached the level
of replacement, a reasonable
target, and in the longer run zero
population growth.
The idea that national
population size and growth is
chiefly responsible for pollution
does not stand up under scientific
analysis, as pointed out by Barry
Commoner, distinguished
biologist-ecologist. Sydney,
Australia, for example, has much
the same problems of pollution as
the Bay region—smog, traffic
jams, urban sprawl, pollution of
the harbor—this in a country of
continental size with only 12
million people, as compared with
our 200 million. Conversely
countries with 10 times our
population density (the United
Kingdom) and even some 20 times
(Belgium and the Netherlands)
have less pollution than the
United States.
Population Distribution
Pollution is the product of our
population DISTRIBUTION,
specifically our crowding into a
few metrpolitan areas and into
favored areas like California.
Seventy percent of our people
now live in less than two percent
of our area. More than half the
area of the United States is
suffering from DEpopulation.
Even more, pollution is the
product of our affluence and
mismanagement of technology.
The use of nitrogen fertilizer,
pesticides, fuels, gasoline and
other pollutants has grown much
faster than our population. It is
very doubtful that the use of
DDT, for example, would have
been much different if we had had
a population of 150 million or of
250 million rather lhan the actual
200 million. DDT and other

pesticides and herbicides are
simply efficient methods of
reducing costs of agricultural
production.
Economics of Population
As a country of agricultural
surplus, and potentially much
greater surpluses, we do not have
a desperate need to use these
pollutants—it is simply a matter of
the economics of production. The
idea that we could not feed a
larger population is fatuous; for
over a generation we have been
paying farmers billions of dollars
to keep many millions of acres of
good land out of production,
simply because they aren't
needed.
A substantial population
growth in the U.S. before the
achievement of zero population
growth at the end of the century
is almost inevitable. Such is the
inertia imposed by the large
numbers of young people in our
population, the heritage of the
baby boom after World War 11.
But this is scarcely catastrophic.
An increase of national
population of one percent a year
will not be a major factor in the
increase or solution of pollution.
We cannot meet our pressing
and immediate environmental
problems by reducing the birth
rate. All projections of future
pollution without counteraction
far outrun one percent a year. To
take a single example, it is
estimated that our needs for
electric power will double in the
next decade. Less than 20 percent
of this could in any way be
attributed to population growth.
If zero population growth could
be achieved right now it would
affect less than one-fifth of the
problem. The realistic solutions
are much more immediate and
direct: make the polluters,
including each one of us, reduce
the pollution or pay the social
costs.
Predictions and Reality
Long-term extrapolations
predicting an anthill density of
population in the United States
are merely arithmetic exercises
with no relevance to reality. There
are many social trends that, if
continued, will bring disaster long
before population pressure could.
To take one, the rate of murders
in the United States is said to be
increasing at 7 percent per year. If
this continues the population
problem will be quickly solved.
We have the food, we have the
resources, we have the space in
the U.S. to accommodate the

larger population we will almost
certainly have before we achieve
zero growth. With better
management we can do so with
much less pollution or destruction
of the environment than we have
