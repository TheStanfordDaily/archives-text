## Shoch-Evers 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The most important issues at
stake in today's elections is
whether Stanford University shall
be a free and independent
institution: free from the
short - sighted and selfish
motivations of big business in
America independent of the
oppressive entanglements of the
Pentagon. How do we achieve this
freedom?
One way is to elect a student
government that will fight for the
primacy of student power and for
a courageous stand on social
issues; a government that will
fight for the end of ROTC and
university control by the
Pentagon.
John Shoch and Bill Evers will
do this They see that the issues of
war, and ecology, and how the
university is run are intricately
interrelated. If peace is to come.

American universities must say
"No" to the war machine. They
must use their lands and resources
to improve the environment
rather than further defile it. They
must stand fast for freedom
against a government that is
systematically eliminating it with
injunctions and codes that restrict
the rights of free speech and
assembly.
I have worked in the
Moratorium for six months, now,
and I am not about to see that
work washed away by a student
government that will not fight for
the values to which the
Moratorium is dedicated.
1 urge those who have claimed
sympathy with the Moratorium to
assume consistency in their views.
Vote for control of your own life.
Vote against the war machine:
vote for Shoch and Evers.
