# In Memoriam Kevin Moran
## 'Integrity Will Be His Burial Partner' 
### 
| You self-righteous radicals, you
i apathetic silent majority, you
i disdainful and gutless parents, you
i legislators wrapped up in
j superfluous bureaucratic rhetoric
( and procedure, you pious clergy
I preaching love and peace from the
I pulpit: you are all burdened with
} the responsibility of the death of
[ Kevin P. Moran. The streets of Isla
I Vista where he died no longer
I represent just the issue of tenant
l oppression, or the issues of
1 Vietnam, of racism, of capitalism
j versus imperialism, or democracy
versus communism—they
represent the issue of the integrity
of the American people. Like it or
not, you are ALL American
people. Behind this fact you
should be aware of your
conflicting ideologies, but not
op pr essi ve in your
condemnations.
Whether a policeman or a
sniper fired the shot that killed
Kevin Moran is irrelevant. You all
speak of relevancy-lhen look
yourselves in the eye and admit
that the "relevant" fact is that a
shot was fired.
You radicals, through disorder
and civil disobedience, want to
change the system you find
incompatible with humanitarian
objectives. You are right to want
this changed; you are more than
right to go out and get it rather

than to be content to vegitate in
your ivory towers; but in allowing
chaos and mayhem to overtake
and dominate the ideals you
believe in, you are inviting the
power of the state to come down
upon you, crush you out, and
leave your cause to be
remembered only in the graffiti
on the walls which would
surround the police-state you
initiated.
You silent majorities want to
change society too—change that
will let the crucial issues ride and
be lost in the impersonal
bureaucracy you perpetrate;
change that will leave you
uninvolved. You too invite the
inevitable—forced involvement in
a system where your vote is
meaningless, your church a
hypocritical gathering place, and
your home an outpost that places
you in a position of subjugation
equal with the radicals you
wanted this system to destroy; a
system that finds your son dead in
the streets of an Isle Vista, a
People's Park, or any other
journalistic myth in your
mind—dead because you were
content to "turn off" the appeals
of the active minority, and
silently approve of their silencing
by another minority, a structured
and repressive law enforcing one.
You civic leaders —church,

racial, union, fraternal,
service-—want peace and love and
equality, and you have sermons
and social gatherings to promote
these causes; but where are you
when these causes are challenged?
You can have candle-light marches
and meetings of "concerned"
citizens daily, and their effect will
be as meaningless as the Sunday
sermon damning all those who
didn't come to hear it.
Continue to grow your hair;
continue to espouse your
apple-pie philosophies; but find
out why the silent are silent and
the radical are radical. For as long
as the wall of negative
"against-ism" separates you, the
"for-ism" that can only be found
in the peace and love that is your
only uniting factor will be buried

in the diametrically opposed and
unrelenting ways you espouse it.
Love is tolerance; tolerance to
further love, rather than letting
differences condemn it. You silent
majorities go into the streets and
find out why they are in chaos,
give meaning to the burning and
take the fire out of it; you radicals
discover the roots of silence and
bring the sounds you find into
your actions, but do it without
forcing the silence to go deeper
into itself and be heard through
bull horns and bullets.
If you do not do this, then
Kevin P. Moran will have died in
vain, and the integrity of the
American people will be his burial
partner.
