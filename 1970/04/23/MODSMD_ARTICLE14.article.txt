# 'The Uselessness, The Stupidity'
## 
### 
I The following is a letter from Bob Thompson, a senior in
) economics, to his brother John—a member of the Santa Barbara
I Sheriff's department.
[ Dear John,
I lam writing you primarily because of the killing in Isla Vista this
I last weekend. I never knew Kevin Moran, but his death has really
bothered me. True I didn't have to look at the corpse and identify it
as I'm sure you did, but it bothered me nonetheless. I wonder whether
as you handled that lifeless body you thought of your brother who is
the same age, who has the same major, and who probably would have
done the same thing in the same situation. The uselessness, the
stupidity of his death and of so many others—is overwhelming.
More disturbing still is the society which witnessed his death and
which sat unmoved.
You and 1 live in vastly different environments—yours is of a
sheriff's department and mine is of a university community. But we
both see windows broken by rocks, insults hurled verbally and in
print, heads busted, lies perpetrated, and reputations ruined because
people won't talk anymore, because people won't look anymore,
because people won't feel anymore.
When I sit and look at the thousands of lights which makes cities so
beautiful at night, I come to feel the humility, the smallness of a
human being. When I sail the ocean I come to feel the power of
nature. And when I see those fascinating pictures taken of us from
100,000 miles away, as I try to relate Macleish's orb, ". . . small and
blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats. . with
mountains and men, I come to see how much we all need nature, and
I come to see how we all need one another.
Somehow, if we are to survive and to share all the small glories that
make life such a fascinating, worthwhile experience, we must ALL
become brothers. Now is NOT a time for revolution or for hate; rather
it is a time to absorb, to observe, to teach, to talk, to communicate, to
think, to act, and above all TO REASON. It is too easy to give up by
observing that very few others are trying; unless we make those
commitments to ourselves—and consequently to all the brothers and
sisters about us-Hhere is no hope for either them or us.
So before I leave you, .John, I ask you to think again. Today when
you deal with violence or handle a lifeless body, one denied life for no
good reason, please don't become more embitteredHife is too short
to waste on bitterness. Rather see the goodness which has been denied
and try to put it back yourself.
Please, John, for without that there is no hope.
Your loving brother,
Boh
