# 'You Are Responsible?'
## 
### 
Dear Movement people, etc.,
I finally got to see "True Grit" last night, and it suddenly hit me
what's been happening to it is that's been bothering me
about you lately. More and more, you're getting to look like John
Wayne.
You know John Wayne. He's the Good Guy who goes after the Bad
Guys. Now, he knows that the Bad Guys are dirty rats, and that you
don't reason with a rat, or serve papers on him, or petition him, or
hold Meaningful Dialogues with him. You put him in jail, or
somewhere where he can't do any harm, and if he won't come along
quiet-like, you shoot him. Because only when all the Bad Guys are
dead, or at least powerless, will people be able to live together in
Peace and Harmony.
Actually, old John does almost as much killing and robbing as any
of the Bad Guys, but that's okay, because he has Right and Justice on
his side. Besides, he only kills Bad Guys, and everyone knows THAT
doesn't count as murder.
Yes, it's that old frontier glory—the only way we Americans know
to be heroes. And whether you like it or not, gang, you're Americans.
Your Bad Guys are Wayne's Good Guys and vice versa, but does that
really make so much difference? "It's them or us; they'll kill us if we
don't get them first; you're either with us or against us." That's
Wayne. That's Lyndon Johnson, talking about Vietnam. That's Nixon.
And, increasingly, that's you.
A Little Matter
And now there's this little matter of Kevin Moran. I know—why
am I hassling you about Moran? You didn't want him killed, you
didn't pull the trigger; in fact, right now it looks some some pig may
have killed him. And besides, why am I sweating Moran, when kids
like him are dying in Vietnam every day?
Well, as to the first point: You believe, as I do, that the Silent
Majority, by tacitly supporting American violence in Vietnam, have
made themselves responsible for the deaths of the Vietnamese and
Americans killed there. Now you tacitly or vocally supported the
violence in Isla Vista, and you knew, when you did so, that there
might be deaths involved. You can write off Moran as an "unfortunate
but necessary casualty of the War of Liberation," if you believe in
your war. But don't say you're not responsible for what happened to
him, baby.
As to the second point, all I can say is that it's the spirit of the
thing that counts. Of course, the Movement's violence is miniscule
compared to the Establishment's. But after all, your resources are
miniscule compared to their's, and they have a long head start on you.
Given their advantages, who knows what you might accomplish? All
in the name of The People, of course.
Look
Look, I'm not saying you're any worse than they are, or even that
you re as bad. It's just that, for a while, I really believed you were
different and better. Last year, during the SRI thing, you said you
were for Life against Death, and I believed you; with all my
wishy-washy-liberal doubts and reservations, I believed you. I still
want to believe you. But the more I see and hear of where the
Movement is going, the more it looks like you're heading for another
death trip, just like everybody else.
Well, who knows. Maybe this time you WILL turn out to be
different. And maybe you're right when you say that the only way to
be effective in this world is to act like John Wayne. But please excuse
me if, through the smoke and all, I sometimes have a little trouble
telling the Good Guys from the Bad Guys.
Kill for peace, brothers and sisters.

And now there's this little matter of Kevin Moran. I know—why
am I hassling you about Moran? You didn't want him killed, you
didn't pull the trigger; in fact, right now it looks some some pig may
have killed him. And besides, why am I sweating Moran, when kids
like him are dying in Vietnam every day?
Well, as to the first point: You believe, as I do, that the Silent
Majority, by tacitly supporting American violence in Vietnam, have
made themselves responsible for the deaths of the Vietnamese and
Americans killed there. Now you tacitly or vocally supported the
violence in Isla Vista, and you knew, when you did so, that there
might be deaths involved. You can write off Moran as an "unfortunate
but necessary casualty of the War of Liberation," if you believe in
your war. But don't say you're not responsible for what happened to
him, baby.
As to the second point, all I can say is that it's the spirit of the
thing that counts. Of course, the Movement's violence is miniscule
compared to the Establishment's. But after all, your resources are
miniscule compared to their's, and they have a long head start on you.
Given their advantages, who knows what you might accomplish? All
in the name of The People, of course.
Look
Look, I'm not saying you're any worse than they are, or even that
you re as bad. It's just that, for a while, I really believed you were
different and better. Last year, during the SRI thing, you said you
were for Life against Death, and I believed you; with all my
wishy-washy-liberal doubts and reservations, I believed you. I still
want to believe you. But the more I see and hear of where the
Movement is going, the more it looks like you're heading for another
death trip, just like everybody else.
Well, who knows. Maybe this time you WILL turn out to be
different. And maybe you're right when you say that the only way to
be effective in this world is to act like John Wayne. But please excuse
me if, through the smoke and all, I sometimes have a little trouble
telling the Good Guys from the Bad Guys.
Kill for peace, brothers and sisters.

Dear Movement people, etc.,
I finally got to see "True Grit" last night, and it suddenly hit me
what's been happening to it is that's been bothering me
about you lately. More and more, you're getting to look like John
Wayne.
You know John Wayne. He's the Good Guy who goes after the Bad
Guys. Now, he knows that the Bad Guys are dirty rats, and that you
don't reason with a rat, or serve papers on him, or petition him, or
hold Meaningful Dialogues with him. You put him in jail, or
somewhere where he can't do any harm, and if he won't come along
quiet-like, you shoot him. Because only when all the Bad Guys are
dead, or at least powerless, will people be able to live together in
Peace and Harmony.
Actually, old John does almost as much killing and robbing as any
of the Bad Guys, but that's okay, because he has Right and Justice on
his side. Besides, he only kills Bad Guys, and everyone knows THAT
doesn't count as murder.
Yes, it's that old frontier glory—the only way we Americans know
to be heroes. And whether you like it or not, gang, you're Americans.
Your Bad Guys are Wayne's Good Guys and vice versa, but does that
really make so much difference? "It's them or us; they'll kill us if we
don't get them first; you're either with us or against us." That's
Wayne. That's Lyndon Johnson, talking about Vietnam. That's Nixon.
And, increasingly, that's you.
A Little Matter
And now there's this little matter of Kevin Moran. I know—why
am I hassling you about Moran? You didn't want him killed, you
