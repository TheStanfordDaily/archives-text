# Off ROTC
## Make Non-Violence Work 
### Byron Georgiou, Edith Kusnia 
Over 2700 of us voted last, week to Off ROTC.
Yet scarcely 200 of us attended the last Off ROTC
open meeting to decide on a course of action. We
are agreed that ROTC, as an integral part of the
U.S. military apparatus, must be eliminated. Our
opposition must be transformed into action;
however, that action need not be violent.
The vast majority of those of us who voted to
remove ROTC refuse to participate in Off ROTC
meetings. Some are simply apathetic, but many
more feel unable to influence a course of events
which they feel may culminate in violence.
We feel that violence can best be avoided when
large numbers of people are prepared to
participate in direct non violent action. It is
especially important to join the movement at this
time. When a small number of people engage in
violent action, it becomes easy for the
administration to repress those few. while at the
same time obfuscating the issue. THE ISSUE IS
ROTC!
VI aii v Arguments
There are many arguments against ROTC. It has
been held by some t hat ROTC has no place in the
university because it does not measure up to
academic standards. This view is too weak in that

it only calls for the denial of credit for ROTC
courses. Others maintain that ROTC compromises
academic impartiality since the university has
abandoned its neutrality by inviting ftOTC on
campus. The university has become a functionally
necessary cog in the U.S. military machine.
This is all true, but to oppose ROTC on the
grounds that it has no place in the university
implies that it may have a place elsewhere. We do
not submit to this elitist position. We do not seek
merely to expel ROTC from Stanford, thereby
shielding us even more from the reality of war.
Rather, wo eliminate ROTC as one step toward
disarming the American military.
Rejection of Violence
Our opposition lo ROTC draws its strength
from our rejection of violence. Just as wo cannot
allow the university to speak in our name by
training ROTC cadets to kill in Southeast Asia, we
cannot allow the 'Siolcnt lew" speak in our name
by trying to Off ROTC in a way we cannot affirm.
We must speak for ourselves in numbers large
enough to be heard. Come to llie rally at noon
today. Make your non-violence mean something!
