# 'Turn Radical'
## An Open Letter To President Nixon 
### A Disillusioned Youth 
Dear Mr. Nixon,
I was greatly disturbed to tead
in the New York Times April 11
of your growing fear-reaction
towards student radicals.
You and your advisors are
entrusted with the task of
governing the richest and mast
powerful nation in the world. It
seems to me that you would be
capable of a much more mature
approach to the problem of what

you term to be the "rising tide of
radical extremism."
According to some of your
advisors, you are "disturbed" by
"reports of small but growing
numbers of young people who
feel alienated from the American
system."
Another of your advisors says
of us, "We're dealing (in the case
of the radicals) with the criminal
mind, with people who have
snapped for some reason."
Anti-Communist Attitude
And what are you doing to
improve the situation? You are
attempting to 'nip the revolution
in the bud,' as it were, by
"reviving and updating an
intelligence system geared to
monitor the Communists three
decades ago," because, as one of
your aides contends, the youth of
today constitute "the most severe
internal security threat this
country has faced since the
Depression."
By using wiretapping,
undercover agents, and other such
authoritarian techniques, you
hope to "increase safeguards of
the civil liberties of individuals"
by obtaining "good information
on what the (radical fringes) are
doing" before they can act. But
once these methods become
commonplace, whose civil
liberties will not be endangered by
your "preventive" snooping?
Another of your advisors
expressed concern that "sooner or
later this (referring to the actions
of young radicals) is going to kill
innocent people." Yet another
stated that "some of these kids
don't know what country this is.
They think it's Bolivia."
Cermany or Bolivia?
No, Mr. Nixon, it's not Bolivia
we think were living in. It seems
to me that Nazi Germany before
she led the world into the
holocaust of World War II would
be a better analogy. Our country

is sinking fast, and by taking on
the burden of the "welfare" of
the rest-of the world, we're going
to drag all of mankind along with
us unless something is done to
change things.
And innocent people arc being
killed—right now—in the jungles
of Southeast Asia and wherever
else in the world American
imperialism has left its soft-shoe
imprint.
Neglected Liberals
The Times article said you have
little choice but to yield to your
conservative advisors, because the
"liberals" have failed to come up
with a viable alternative. All they
have been able to do is to throw
up their arms in desparation and
say, "What does Richard Nixon
do for these people short of
resigning the Presidency?"
Please don't resign, Mr. Nixon,
because that would leave Spiro T.
in charge, and God knows what
that would bring about. But there
are other things you can do.
Any good doctor will tell you
that in order to cure a disease,
you must treat the cause of thaL
disease, not the symptoms. The
violence, bombings and riots are
but symptoms of the disease that
is plaguing us young people. That
disease is disillusionment and
frustration, stemming from having
been lied to all our lives about the
beauty of the American ideal.
Alienation and Revolution
Darn right we've snapped! Our
country is going to the dogs. We
can read about it every day in the
newspapers, smell it in the air,
taste it in the water. And you
seem to us to be letting it happen,
even pushing it along at times.
Small wonder we feel alienated
and talk of Revolution!
Look up the word "radical" in
the dictionary. Webster defines it
as "of or from the root or roots;
going to the foundation or source

of something; favoring
fundamental change."
We are crying out for a return
to the principles on which this
country was founded. We are sick
and tired of being deceived and
manipulated.
No Justice
"With Liberty and Justice for
all." Thus ends the Pledge of
Allegiance, which I recited
faithfully every morning through
eight years of grammar school
But there is no liberty in this
country, unless you are rich,
white, and an ignoramus. And
there certainly is no justice. Ask
Julius Hoffman about that one.
So what can you do instead of
stepping up surveillance on those
who have been growing up
watching you and your cronies
perpetuating the lie we are living,
without having to admit failure
and resign your office?
Cure the Cause
The answer is very simple, Mr.
Nixon. Turn "radical" yourself
and get to the root of the matter.
Cure the cause instead of
attempting to arrest the
symptoms. A good way to begin
might be to:
Pull all our troops out of
Vietnam, Laos, and
Ca m bod ia —NO W!!
Use the money now being
spent on the war effort to curb
the in/lotion that is destroying
our economy, fight the
pollution that is corroding our
environment, to feed, clothe
and educate the poor, to fight
racism by helping Blacks,
Chicanos and other minority
groups get it together, to help
them get the education they
need to get better jobs.
End the draft, and along
with it, get ROTC off our
college campuses.
End all war-related research
that is devoted to killing

innocent people and re direct
those /'units into research for
LIFE, to make our country
and our world a better place in
which to live.
This is just a beginning, Mr.
Nixon. Though it might seem like
a giant leap for you to make, it
would be but a small step in the
right direction; there is much,
much, more to be done. Yours,
and yours alone, is the power to
begin.
We don't have that power yet,
although by continued inaction
on your part it will come to us by
default. And by virtue of our
position in society, we will have
struggle to use that power, and
the struggle will not be a pleasant
one.
K igh t to Revolt
The Declaration of
Independence, which I don't
think you would call a piece of
radical subversive literature,
states, "We hold these truths to be
self-evident. . . That, whenverany
government becomes destructive
of these ends (to preserve Life,
Liberty, and the Pursuit of
Happiness), it is the Right of the
People to abolish it, and to
institute new Government, laying
its foundations upon these
principles."
"When, in the course of human
events, it becomes necessary," Mr.
Nixon, the People will take to the
streets, and a revolution will come
to pass. This letter is not a threat;
it cannot be. It is merely a
warning to take heed and look
about you with a bit more insight
than you have been using.
I think that you will see that
these "criminals" are nothing
more than a group of individuals
who have found the present
government to be destructive of
the principles it was founded
upon. And if nothing is done to
effect a change, that government,
by those very same principles,
must fall.
If you don't want it to, Mr.
Nixon, you've got a heck of a lot
to do, and not much time to do it
in.
I speak for many others aside
from myself, so I will sign
In Peace,
A Frustrated,
Disillusioned Youth
P.S.: Though I know it won't do
any good, I am asking everyone
who reads this and who agrees
with what I have said to clip
this letter out of the paper and
mail it to you to lend you and
your more "liberal" advisors a
hand in coping with us!
