# ROTC & The Environment
## Can Laws Be Enforced? 
### Lee Herzenberg 
This is the year of the
Environment Protection Law.
With the distractive inventiveness
and characteristic of the American
political scene, problems of
environmental pollution, waste
disposal and population density,
long a thorn in the lawmakers side
have suddenly become a
bandwagon from which to woo a
public bending under the weight
of an unpopular war and an even
more unpopular inflation.
The voter, frightened by the
onslaught of highly publicized
ecological disorders, the reams of
studious foundation and
government supported reports of
impending crisis and the daily
personal view of a deteriorating
environment, is to be succoured
by a host of "quick and dirty"
solutions which, he "is promised,
will clean up the environment
without disturbing much else.
The responsibility for the
condition of the environment and
the conditioning of the public
response to environmental
problems has seldom been placed
where it belongs, with the big
decisionmakers, the corporate
power structure, in government
and out, whose maintenance in
power has become the American
way of life.
Instead the guilt has been
brought home to the individaul
consumer, car driver, father and
mother.
Lessons of History
If there is one lesson to be
learned from contemporary
American history it is that
because of the way one system
deals with regulatory legislation,
neither legislators nor the power
elite generally need fear the
passage of laws which could
significantly interfere with pursuit
of fame and fortune. Instead,
enforcement falls to regulatory
agencies and control boards or
commissions notorious for being
under funded, over-worked and
riddled with political appointees.
It's almost impossible to lift
any corner of the ecological rug
and not find blatant examples of
the impossibility of government
controlling the industries which,
in fact, control (or are?)
government, but the example of
the ROTC decision here on
campus is perhaps the best
example of how a legitimate
decision of an informed and
aroused governing body can be
manipulated and reversed by an

administration intent on
maintaining good relations with
the target of the legislation.
The formula is simple and
straightforward. After the law has
been passed, establish a
committee or a control agency to
see to the details. Appoint to the
committee representatives of the
interests who oppose passage of
the law in the first place, e.g.
Howard Brooks, experienced
administrator who made his
pro-ROTC position crystal-clear,
both before the Trustees and in
campus publications.
Add two students who apply
for the job, two of whom were
ROTC cadets and the other who
was attached to one.
For respectability, and also
hopefully to help phrase the
revision in palatable terms, add
two or more dedicated but busy
representatives of the poorly
organized supporters of the
legislation, e.g. Professors Manne
and Van Slyke. Then put the
group to work quietly for six
months to a year, allowing
complacency and disorganization
to dissipate the pressure which
had been generated for

enactment.
Lest this be considered an
accusation of conspiracy, let me
point out that students appointed
their own representatives by their
standard procedures. Mr. Brooks
did the best he could, given his
convictions and background. And
President Pitzer undoubtedly
acted to protect the University
just as the Defense Department
acts to protect the United States.
Which leaves us, those who
would bring the peace to the
world, clean air to our children
and a good life with equal
opportunities to all men, faced
with the realization that those in
power build the world in their
own image. It leaves me with the
question of why one should work
for the election of good
candidates or the passage of good
legislation, or, more accurately,
how to shake loose from the
stranglehold of an interacting
power elite, more concerned with
the maintenance of their own
power than the maintenance of
mankind, so that elections are
again meaningful.

impending crisis and the daily
personal view of a deteriorating
environment, is to be succoured
by a host of "quick and dirty"
solutions which, he "is promised,
will clean up the environment
without disturbing much else.
The responsibility for the
condition of the environment and
the conditioning of the public
response to environmental
problems has seldom been placed
where it belongs, with the big
decisionmakers, the corporate
power structure, in government
and out, whose maintenance in
power has become the American
way of life.
Instead the guilt has been
brought home to the individaul
consumer, car driver, father and
mother.
Lessons of History
If there is one lesson to be
learned from contemporary
American history it is that
because of the way one system
deals with regulatory legislation,
neither legislators nor the power
elite generally need fear the
passage of laws which could
significantly interfere with pursuit
of fame and fortune. Instead,
enforcement falls to regulatory
agencies and control boards or
commissions notorious for being
under funded, over-worked and
riddled with political appointees.
It's almost impossible to lift
any corner of the ecological rug
and not find blatant examples of
the impossibility of government
controlling the industries which,
in fact, control (or are?)
government, but the example of
the ROTC decision here on
campus is perhaps the best
example of how a legitimate
decision of an informed and
aroused governing body can be
manipulated and reversed by an

administration intent on
maintaining good relations with
the target of the legislation.
The formula is simple and
straightforward. After the law has
been passed, establish a
committee or a control agency to
see to the details. Appoint to the
committee representatives of the
interests who oppose passage of
the law in the first place, e.g.
Howard Brooks, experienced
administrator who made his
pro-ROTC position crystal-clear,
both before the Trustees and in
campus publications.
Add two students who apply
for the job, two of whom were
ROTC cadets and the other who
was attached to one.
For respectability, and also
hopefully to help phrase the
revision in palatable terms, add
two or more dedicated but busy
representatives of the poorly
organized supporters of the
legislation, e.g. Professors Manne
and Van Slyke. Then put the
group to work quietly for six
months to a year, allowing
complacency and disorganization
to dissipate the pressure which
had been generated for

enactment.
Lest this be considered an
accusation of conspiracy, let me
point out that students appointed
their own representatives by their
standard procedures. Mr. Brooks
did the best he could, given his
convictions and background. And
President Pitzer undoubtedly
acted to protect the University
just as the Defense Department
acts to protect the United States.
Which leaves us, those who
would bring the peace to the
world, clean air to our children
and a good life with equal
opportunities to all men, faced
with the realization that those in
power build the world in their
own image. It leaves me with the
question of why one should work
for the election of good
candidates or the passage of good
legislation, or, more accurately,
how to shake loose from the
stranglehold of an interacting
power elite, more concerned with
the maintenance of their own
power than the maintenance of
mankind, so that elections are
again meaningful.
