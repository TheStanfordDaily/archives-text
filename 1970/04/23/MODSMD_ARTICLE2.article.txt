### 
In last week's referendum, students
by a narrow margin voted in favor of
keeping ROTC on campus but voted
against academic credit for ROTC by a
margin of nearly 2 to 1.
Had this referendum been held
before the Academic Council's ballot
this spring, it is entirely possible that
knowledge of these results could have
made an important difference in its
outcome. However, the Senate and the
Academic Council have acted, and
binding commitments have been made
on the basis of these actions.
The fatuity vote, by a narrow
majority, affirmed the Senate's
decision leaving open the possibility of
a limited number of Army ROTC
courses attaining academic credit
through approval as undergraduate
specials by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. This proposal
contains no guarantee that academic
credit will be given by any such
courses. It states that CUS "shall
consider each Army course proposal
for academic credit on its academic
merits, with no presumption that any
such proposal will be accepted."
It is important to note that the new
agreement with the Army is for one
year only, and a review at the end of
that time can, and undoubtedly will,
take the student referendum into
account. It also will examine such
questions as whether progress has been
made—which I regard as essential—in
substituting some more reasonable
arrangements for punitive clauses
presently in Army ROTC contracts.
While I am confident that the
faculty will always be responsive to

student opinion, were it to set a
precedent of immediately reversing
itself any time there is a shift in such
opinion, the results would not be
inconsequential.
On the other hand, it seems entirely
reasonable and fair that student views
be taken into account in any further
decisions concerning ROTC—and by
"taken into account," I mean exactly
that. Such views arc important,
particularly in relation to a program
that has been justified in considerable
part because of the service it affords to
students. But the faculty must retain
ultimate authority over questions of
academic credit if Stanford's integrity
as an academic institution is to remain
intact.
I understand that the Air Force
does not plan to present a proposal
after the model set by the Army.
Thus far, the situation with respect
to the Navy is unclear. Should the
Navy forward, by the May 1 deadline
for submitting courses to CUS, a
proposal that is in the opinion of the
Advisory Committee on ROTC
identical in substance to the Army
agreement, I would conclude that the
authority conferred by the March 30,
1970, Academic Council action would
extend to that proposal. I would
therefore approve it, ;wbject, of course,
to review after one year.
If the Navy should submit a
proposal that differs in substance from
the Army agreement, I shall submit it
to the ROTC committee for its
consideration and for subsequent
action by the Senate on any questions
involving academic considerations.

The fatuity vote, by a narrow
majority, affirmed the Senate's
decision leaving open the possibility of
a limited number of Army ROTC
courses attaining academic credit
through approval as undergraduate
specials by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. This proposal
contains no guarantee that academic
credit will be given by any such
courses. It states that CUS "shall
consider each Army course proposal
for academic credit on its academic
merits, with no presumption that any
such proposal will be accepted."
It is important to note that the new
agreement with the Army is for one
year only, and a review at the end of
that time can, and undoubtedly will,
take the student referendum into
account. It also will examine such
questions as whether progress has been
made—which I regard as essential—in
substituting some more reasonable
arrangements for punitive clauses
presently in Army ROTC contracts.
While I am confident that the
faculty will always be responsive to

student opinion, were it to set a
precedent of immediately reversing
itself any time there is a shift in such
opinion, the results would not be
inconsequential.
On the other hand, it seems entirely
reasonable and fair that student views
be taken into account in any further
decisions concerning ROTC—and by
"taken into account," I mean exactly
that. Such views arc important,
particularly in relation to a program
that has been justified in considerable
part because of the service it affords to
students. But the faculty must retain
ultimate authority over questions of
academic credit if Stanford's integrity
as an academic institution is to remain
intact.
I understand that the Air Force
does not plan to present a proposal
after the model set by the Army.
Thus far, the situation with respect
to the Navy is unclear. Should the
Navy forward, by the May 1 deadline
for submitting courses to CUS, a
proposal that is in the opinion of the
Advisory Committee on ROTC
identical in substance to the Army
agreement, I would conclude that the
authority conferred by the March 30,
1970, Academic Council action would
extend to that proposal. I would
therefore approve it, ;wbject, of course,
to review after one year.
If the Navy should submit a
proposal that differs in substance from
the Army agreement, I shall submit it
to the ROTC committee for its
consideration and for subsequent
action by the Senate on any questions
involving academic considerations.
In last week's referendum, students
by a narrow margin voted in favor of
keeping ROTC on campus but voted
against academic credit for ROTC by a
margin of nearly 2 to 1.
Had this referendum been held
before the Academic Council's ballot
this spring, it is entirely possible that
knowledge of these results could have
made an important difference in its
outcome. However, the Senate and the
Academic Council have acted, and
binding commitments have been made
on the basis of these actions.
