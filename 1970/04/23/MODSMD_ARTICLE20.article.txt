### Joyce Kobayashi 
The title of "no endorsement"
on the letter published in the
Daily yesterday was somewhat
misleading. I wrote it before the
primaries—a time that tends to
focus people's thoughts on the
issues they feel are important, and
often a time to consider their own
involvement in the coming year. It
was directed specifically toward
the students who might have had
interest in furthering changes of
the educational structure here at
Stanford, and felt dissatisfied—in
that particular regard-with the
candidates.
If there were students in this
position, I felt that there were
other ways for them to be
involved directly—all the more
important because no candidates
were focussing on such issues—and
wished to talk with them. A more
precise description might have
been that it was simply not an
endorsement.
About endorsing someone: if
endorsement s-plus-conspicuous
titles are worth more than an
indication that people generally
don't have a chance to know the
people for whom they are voting,
I think they should represent
opinions that, have some extra
background to them, some extra

grounding in directly related
experience or personal contact
that might lend those opinions
some weight.
I have given my one vote quite
a bit of thought, and decided to
cast it for the Shea-Grant ticket: I
personally feel that President
Pitzer has not exerted the
leadership that his position
requires, except for perhaps
forcing a reversal of a valid
community decision on ROTC
through the Academic Senate, and
I fear that too many faculty will
withdraw comfortably behind
Professor Clebsch on more issues
than ROTC—and for more than
one year; but I deeply believe this
calls for working and talking with
the faculty all the more—not
letting go, in order to be able to
stand there and yell. But that is
one opinion v and no more.
Pat A. Shea, and John Grube
have worked with Grant, Shea and
Shoch in the ASSU Senate this
year, and have decided to endorse
the Grant-Shea ticket. One
opinion I do feel qualified to urge
on people is the respect I have for
jthe integrity and responsibility of
these friends with whom I have
worked many hours this year.
