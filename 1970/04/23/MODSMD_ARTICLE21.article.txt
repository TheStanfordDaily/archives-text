# Med School Student Day: Failure Of US Medicine
## 
### 
Failures of American Medicine,
in rural America and in the
country's urban ghettos, will be
the focus of Student Day at the
Medical School Saturday.
An all-day program devoted to
a single issue is an innovation.
Traditionally, medical students
have presented research papers
and guest speakers have delivered
talks on divergent topics. This
year the students have moved the
program from the Medical School
to Bishop Auditorium in the
Graduate School of Business so
that more people can attend. It is
open to the public.
The program is planned as a
way of increasing understanding
of problems on the current
medical scene, and of solutions to
those problems that are now being
attempted.
"Most of us are aware in a
general way of the lack of
adequate health care in rural areas
and city ghettos," says Chairman
Les Cordes, "but we may not have
been exposed to specifics. Our
speakers face the problems every
day and are actually involved in
large- and small-scale efforts to
correct them."
Los Angeles health workers

Mrs. Marion Grindell and Roy
Evans will talk at the morning
session, which begins at Bishop at
9:30.
Mrs. Grindell, who is on the
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
Commission in Los Angeles, will
speak on "Failures of Health
Services in the (south) Los
Angeles Ghetto," the area which
takes in Watts.
Evans was addicted to drugs
for seventeen years until he
committed himself to
rehabilitative training four years
ago. His talk "Ghetto Psychology
and Establishment Medicine" is
based on his experiences working
on several of Los Angeles' most
active delinquency and drug abuse
prevention projects since that
time. Currently Evans is a district
project coordinator of Narcotics
Information in the L.A.
Department of Community
Services, and he is executive
director of a project called Bridge
Back, Inc.
The early afternoon's emphasis
will be on the rural scene. Dr.
Gerald Bassett, assistant professor
of preventive medicine al the
University of -Washington and a
1959 Staifford medical alumnus,

will talk about rural health in the
State of Vteshington and other
states.
John Hatch, M.S.W. and
assistant professor of preventive
medicine at Tufts University
Medical School, will describe the
Tufts-Delta Project at Mound
Bayou, Mississippi. Started three
years ago, the project is a working
model of comprehensive health
care in a rural district.
After these presentations, a
panel of professors, resident
physicians and medical students
will discuss community health
care from both a national and a
local point of view. Panel
members will be Dr. Count
Gibson, Chairman of the
Department of Community and
Preventive Medicine; Dr. Norton
Kalishman, resident in pediatrics
and a founder of the People's
Medical Center; Miss Kate Lorig,
training coordinator at the Alviso
Community Service Organization
Family Health Center; Don
Williams, a first-year medical
student who was instrumental in
setting up the Black Man's Free
Clinic in San Francisco; and Bob
Korns, a third-year medical
student who has served a clerkship
at the Southern Monterey County
Medical Group Rural Health
Project, King City.
Dr. John Sbarbaro, director of
the Denver Neighborhood Health
Center, will conclude the day's
program with "Surrmary and
Impressions."
Dr. Sbarbaro will also speak on
campus Friday, April 24, on
"Community Health in the
Political Arena" at a Health
Colloquium at 4 p.m. in Room
Ml 14 of the Medical School.
