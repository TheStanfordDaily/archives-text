# Humanities Majors Will Be Advised In Finding Careers
## 
### DICK BUXTON 
The development , of career
planning for liberal arts majors
will become an important
function of the Placement Service
next fall as a result of the recent
hiring of a Director of Humanities
Placement.
John Kerns, who will graduate
from the Graduate School of
Business this spring, has been
selected to fill the newly
established post of director of
Humanities Placement. He will
begin working in June to organize
programs and services to help
counsel undergraduates in career
planning.
He says he will orient his work
around student interest and
demands. He feels that
information on career planning is
important even to students going
on to graduate schools because it
can help inform them about many
available job alternatives.
The Placement Service has
traditionally been a center for job
placement of engineering
students, business graduates, and
teachers. The new emphasis on
career planning is hoped to open
up information and counselling on
job opportunities to liberal arts
majors. Placement Service
Director Ralph W. Keller says that
career planning "has to be an
intergal part of the educational
process. We do not try to
influence students about what
they will do." But Keller feels
that a means should be provided
to allow all students to know
about various job alternatives.
According to Keller
information on career planning

will be available to all classes so
that students can consider
possibilities and, for example, can
use the information in choosing
needed courses for certain career
directions.
Placement Service plans for
next year include an Orientation
Week preceeding autumn
registration to stress the
importance of career planning to
incoming freshmen. Throughout
the year Kerns will be seeking
ways to provide information on
career planning to all students by
means of after dinner discussions,
group counselling and other
techniques.
Kerns feels that his role as
director of humanities placement
will have two sides. One will be
the counselling of students and
the other will be the developing of
jobs for liberal arts majors. He
feels that by providing
information on jobs to students
and information on abilities of
liberal arts majors to employers he
can serve as a "broker" or
"matchmaker" to bring both
parties together.
The idea for Kern's position
came from analyses and reports
prepared by Keller in 1965, and
from recommendations of an
independent firm which also did
an analysis of the Placement
Service. Opening of the position
has not been possible until this
year because of lack of funds.
Developments which have already
resulted from Keller's reports
include the movement of the
Placement Service from Encina
Hall to its centrally located
building and improvements in
space, equipment and procedures.

begin working in June to organize
programs and services to help
counsel undergraduates in career
planning.
He says he will orient his work
around student interest and
demands. He feels that
information on career planning is
important even to students going
on to graduate schools because it
can help inform them about many
available job alternatives.
The Placement Service has
traditionally been a center for job
placement of engineering
students, business graduates, and
teachers. The new emphasis on
career planning is hoped to open
up information and counselling on
job opportunities to liberal arts
majors. Placement Service
Director Ralph W. Keller says that
career planning "has to be an
intergal part of the educational
process. We do not try to
influence students about what
they will do." But Keller feels
that a means should be provided
to allow all students to know
about various job alternatives.
According to Keller
information on career planning

will be available to all classes so
that students can consider
possibilities and, for example, can
use the information in choosing
needed courses for certain career
directions.
Placement Service plans for
next year include an Orientation
Week preceeding autumn
registration to stress the
importance of career planning to
incoming freshmen. Throughout
the year Kerns will be seeking
ways to provide information on
career planning to all students by
means of after dinner discussions,
group counselling and other
techniques.
Kerns feels that his role as
director of humanities placement
will have two sides. One will be
the counselling of students and
the other will be the developing of
jobs for liberal arts majors. He
feels that by providing
information on jobs to students
and information on abilities of
liberal arts majors to employers he
can serve as a "broker" or
"matchmaker" to bring both
parties together.
The idea for Kern's position
came from analyses and reports
prepared by Keller in 1965, and
from recommendations of an
independent firm which also did
an analysis of the Placement
Service. Opening of the position
has not been possible until this
year because of lack of funds.
Developments which have already
resulted from Keller's reports
include the movement of the
Placement Service from Encina
Hall to its centrally located
building and improvements in
space, equipment and procedures.
The development , of career
planning for liberal arts majors
will become an important
function of the Placement Service
next fall as a result of the recent
hiring of a Director of Humanities
Placement.
John Kerns, who will graduate
from the Graduate School of
Business this spring, has been
selected to fill the newly
established post of director of
Humanities Placement. He will
begin working in June to organize
programs and services to help
counsel undergraduates in career
planning.
