Molotov cocktail, destroyed
offices on the ground floor of the
University of Redlands:

Damage was estimated at about
$40,000 to the 61-year old

in a classroom building but only
minor damage was reported.
"Very low" attendance was
reported at Yale University as a
result of a student strike in
support of eight Black Panthers
facing trial in New Haven, Conn.

undergraduate living units voted
in favor of the strike. A few
pickets were reported but no
attempts to interfere with
students who wished to go to class
/ere made.
Near the University of Kansas
curfew violators shot at firemen
and threw rocks at police Tuesday

imposed after Monday night's

racial rioting, a firebombing and
another fire that caused $2
million damage to the student
center.
The University President has
alerted National Guardsmen and
state troopers to stand by in case
of emergency.
At Chico State College 600
students confronted 150 law
enforcement officers Tuesday
night in an argument over a street
running through campus. No
injuries or arrests were reported.
Students blocked the street
that they feel causes traffic
problems and harassed motorists
trying to make their way along
the street.
Miami University of Ohio
protesting students flushed toilets
and ran showers Tuesday
nightâ€”drying up the water supply

hours.
Miami has been the scene of a
student strike since Thursday.

groups resulting from the arrest of
170 persons during the seizure of
