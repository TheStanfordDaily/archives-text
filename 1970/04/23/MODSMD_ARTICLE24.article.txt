# Conservative Freshman Knits Nixon Supporter
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Robin Friedman likes to
crochet. Hats and mufflers crafted
by the Twain House freshman
grace many heads and necks about
the campus. Robin Friedman also
like politics, Republican politics.
She has been enrolled in ROTC
for the last two quarters in War
Tactics and Guerilla Warfare "to
find out about what is behind the
military system in this country,"
and is well known by her friends
for her conservative politics.
When Robin combined her
liking for crocheting, her staunch
Republicanism and her support of
Richard Milhaus Nixon, an
interesting product emerged.
Noting the president's enthusiasm
for sports, Robin whipped out her
crochet hook and created a
presidential athletic supporter.
Personalized
It is crafted from yarn with a
red and white striped waistband,
complete with sewn-on stars. The
cup is a field of blue with the
president's nickname, Dick,
emblazoned on it. Her gift will
leave for Washington soon by

registered mail with the card
enclosed reading "We thought
you'd need all the support you
could get."
Robin really does like Nixon
and made it clear that "a lot of
love," went into her gift, and she
hoped that "he wouldn't take it
negatively." She added that
"Since it is hot in Washington
during the summer, I felt he might
be more comfortable sleeping in
it."
Dissension
Friends of Robin who don't
share her politics suggested
additional captions for the card
enclosed like "You filled
Johnson's shoes, now can you fill
his jock?" or "If you're the man
you think you are, fill this!" The
garment is a marine style
supporter with proportioned fit.
Robin has plans to crochet red,
white, and blue jocks for all the
members of Congress. "If they
come to meetings only in their
jocks, people will know that
Washington politicians have
nothing up their sleeves. Robin

added that Margaret Chase Smith
was welcome to wear whatever
she wishes.
"If all of our boys in Vietnam
wore these tricolor jocks and
nothing else, the war would be
over tomorrow. American men
would realize that aside from the
color of their skin, they don't
have anything that the Viet Cong
don't."
Plans lor Spiro
Plans are in order to provide
Spiro Agnew with a similar
garment, hopefully to improve his
golf game. It surely couldn't hurt
his game any.
The gift is being sent registered
mail in the hopes that the
president himself will get it.
Robin expects that all packages
are inspected by the FBI for
security reasons but thinks that
the President will get the gift and
thank her personally for her
support. Asked if she expected
any repercussions from the FBI,
Robin shook her blond head and
replied, "No, the only worry I
have is that the wool is going to
itch if he sweats so I'll be
depending on him to keep his
cool. If he gets a rash, he can sue
me."
Take heed Mr. President.
