HELP—That's what the Daily needs. It may bo a rag, but it's the
only daily rag the campus has. Why don't you drop over and learn
how to misspell names, slant the truth, and insult your friends
and neighbors. It's fun working at the Daily—just ask any Daily
staffer you know, or give us a call at x 4632. No experience
necessary; we don't have any either.
