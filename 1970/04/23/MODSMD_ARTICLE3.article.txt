# Abduction Charged; Bogus Arena's Lost

Student Financial Manager
David Swift claimed yesterday
that he was kidnapped in an effort
to suppress the parody ARENA, a
few copies of which appeared on
campus Tuesday, as reported in
yesterday's Daily.
Though held for only a day, he
said he saw one of his captors.
He heard three voices, one of
them a girl's.
Swift says he was kidnapped as
he was entering his apartment in
Mountain View. Given a paper hag
and told to put it on his head, he
complied and was driven for
about a half an hour or an hour.
He states that he was kept hi a
small room with a bathroom and
given one meal during his
captivity.
The ARENA'S were taken from
Swift's car trunk while he was
held captive, he states. Though his

captors did not apparently have
his key, they opened the trunk
and removed the issue.
Swift denied a statement made
in yesterday's Daily that he was
the publisher and originator of the
parody ARENA. Swift said he
originated the idea for an ARENA
parody, but he was not the
originator or publisher of the
paper that was actually printed.
A number of informed person's
are sceptical of Swift's claim,
however, believing that he stole
the copies of the ARENA because
he was embarassed by its political
content.
It contained an editorial urging
a write-in vote for Hukari and
Rael, an attack on Patrick C. and
Patrick A. Shea, articles on the
Free Campus Movement and the
Coalition for an Academic
Community, and straight
parodies.
