# Thousands Attend Teach-in, Ecological Action Stressed
## 
### 
Earth Day brought several
thousand people to White Plaza
for a day of speeches, exhibits and
education about action necessary
to stop the deterioration of our
environment.
Some forty different
organizations manned booths at
the Environmental Fair amid the
sunshine and carnival atmosphere.
Students from several local high
schools were excused for the day
to attend the Stanford
environmental teach-in.
Climaxing the day's activities,
Congressman Pete McCloskey
appeared in a panel discussion at 8
p.m. before 1,200 people in
Memorial Church.
McCloskey addressed the topic
"Growth in America" in a debate
with Steve Weissman, a
contributing editor of Ramparts
magazine. Nobel Laureate Joshua
Lederberg moderated the panel
which also included Kenneth
Cuthbertson, vice president for
finance; Paul Rupert, member of
Grass Roots; and Wallace Stegner,
member of the Committee for
Green Foothills.
Vietnam
Both Weissman and McCloskey
agreed that the primary ecological
priority of the United States is
immediately withdrawal from
Vietnam. However, Weissman
tended to lay the blame on the
American capitalistic system,
whereas McCloskey urged that
Weissman not become
disillusioned with the present
government.
He said Congress is finally

catching up with the mood of the
country.
After McCloskey answered
questions from the audience,
Rupert, Cuthbertson and Stegner
discussed Stanford land policies.
Revolution
Earlier in the day, Stephanie
Mills, editor of Earth Times,
proposed to a White Plaza crowd
"revolution in consciousness
about the way we live. We must
stop being purveyors of death
with our status quo." Branding
the Nixon administration as
"utterly hypocritical in
environmental matters," she urged
her audience to "get together and
dump Nixon. We must become
the government.
"Revolution is very convenient
but power is the only way to get
change. Learn all you can, then
turn the situation around from
inside. Otherwise we are witless
zealots." She said that there
would be no action on the
environment until the war is over,
and concluded with an appeal to
"put joy back on earth."
"We must quit our love affair
with the Gross National Product,"
observed TV actor Eddie Albert,
star of Green Acres, "We have
devoted ourselves to affluence
with results that scare the hell out
of me. I used to be a
conservationist—today
conservation is obsolete; we must
be human survivalists."
Albert rationalized the
sponsorship of his TV program by
Proctor and Gamble,
manufacturers of polluting

detergents, by saying he would
stick with the company because
they are "fighting hard" to
overcome the problem.
In contrast to the general
placid tone of the day's activities,
Stanford professor Bruce Franklin
took the microphone at one time
to denounce the pollution hazards
to workers in the Santa Clara
plant of Owens Corning fiberglas.
He charged the company with
threatening the leaders of the
employee committee for better
working conditions and having
them trailed by "rent a cops."
About 100 demonstrators,
having gone by bus to the plant,
mostly from the Stanford
community, marched peacefully
for an hour in front of the Owens
Corning plant. They filed along
the sidewalk and gave leaflets to
employees driving into and out of
the factory.
The protest was
enthusiastically attended by
Stanford radicals, who had viewed
most END Day activities as a
diversion from revolutionary
goals. The radicals supported the
Owens march as a show of
worker-student solidarity.
Owens-Corning officials deny
there is a health hazard in thy
plant.

During the afternoon speeches
in White Plaza, Frank Lockfield a
county planner from Santa Clara
urged attention to urban ecology.
"We must focus on housing since
it is housing that determines the
character of the city." Lockfield
accused the government with
responsibility for urban sprawl
through subsidization of middle
income housing.
In the same vein, Naomi
Golden of the Peninsula Fair
Housing Committee called for
provision of adequate "inner
space in low income areas. Lack
of public concern is the heart of
the housing shortage."
Palo Alto engineer Frank
Sebastian told fair-goers that
because the public's thinking is
not ready to accept technology, in
the next 20 years we will turn the
Bay into a sewer and pump
sewage into the ocean. He
described the ultra modern sewage
treatment at Lake Tahoe which,
for 2V2C a day per person about
twice the cost of secondary
sewage treatment, can produce
drinkable water, reclaim
phosphates, destroy DDT and
produce sterile ash for use as road
fill, building material and
fertilizer.

urged attention to urban ecology.
"We must focus on housing since
it is housing that determines the
character of the city." Lockfield
accused the government with
responsibility for urban sprawl
through subsidization of middle
income housing.
In the same vein, Naomi
Golden of the Peninsula Fair
Housing Committee called for
provision of adequate "inner
space in low income areas. Lack
of public concern is the heart of
the housing shortage."
Palo Alto engineer Frank
Sebastian told fair-goers that
because the public's thinking is
not ready to accept technology, in
the next 20 years we will turn the
Bay into a sewer and pump
sewage into the ocean. He
described the ultra modern sewage
treatment at Lake Tahoe which,
for 2V2C a day per person about
twice the cost of secondary
sewage treatment, can produce
drinkable water, reclaim
phosphates, destroy DDT and
produce sterile ash for use as road
fill, building material and
fertilizer.
Earth Day brought several
thousand people to White Plaza
for a day of speeches, exhibits and
education about action necessary
to stop the deterioration of our
environment.
Some forty different
organizations manned booths at
the Environmental Fair amid the
sunshine and carnival atmosphere.
Students from several local high
schools were excused for the day
to attend the Stanford
environmental teach-in.
Climaxing the day's activities,
Congressman Pete McCloskey
appeared in a panel discussion at 8
p.m. before 1,200 people in
Memorial Church.
McCloskey addressed the topic
"Growth in America" in a debate
with Steve Weissman, a
contributing editor of Ramparts
magazine. Nobel Laureate Joshua
Lederberg moderated the panel
which also included Kenneth
Cuthbertson, vice president for
finance; Paul Rupert, member of
Grass Roots; and Wallace Stegner,
member of the Committee for
Green Foothills.
Vietnam
Both Weissman and McCloskey
agreed that the primary ecological
priority of the United States is
immediately withdrawal from
Vietnam. However, Weissman
tended to lay the blame on the
American capitalistic system,
whereas McCloskey urged that
Weissman not become
disillusioned with the present
government.
He said Congress is finally

catching up with the mood of the
country.
After McCloskey answered
questions from the audience,
Rupert, Cuthbertson and Stegner
discussed Stanford land policies.
Revolution
Earlier in the day, Stephanie
Mills, editor of Earth Times,
proposed to a White Plaza crowd
"revolution in consciousness
about the way we live. We must
stop being purveyors of death
with our status quo." Branding
the Nixon administration as
"utterly hypocritical in
environmental matters," she urged
her audience to "get together and
dump Nixon. We must become
the government.
"Revolution is very convenient
but power is the only way to get
change. Learn all you can, then
turn the situation around from
inside. Otherwise we are witless
zealots." She said that there
would be no action on the
environment until the war is over,
and concluded with an appeal to
"put joy back on earth."
"We must quit our love affair
with the Gross National Product,"
observed TV actor Eddie Albert,
star of Green Acres, "We have
devoted ourselves to affluence
with results that scare the hell out
of me. I used to be a
conservationist—today
conservation is obsolete; we must
be human survivalists."
Albert rationalized the
sponsorship of his TV program by
Proctor and Gamble,
manufacturers of polluting

detergents, by saying he would
stick with the company because
they are "fighting hard" to
overcome the problem.
In contrast to the general
placid tone of the day's activities,
Stanford professor Bruce Franklin
took the microphone at one time
to denounce the pollution hazards
to workers in the Santa Clara
plant of Owens Corning fiberglas.
He charged the company with
threatening the leaders of the
employee committee for better
working conditions and having
them trailed by "rent a cops."
About 100 demonstrators,
having gone by bus to the plant,
mostly from the Stanford
community, marched peacefully
for an hour in front of the Owens
Corning plant. They filed along
the sidewalk and gave leaflets to
employees driving into and out of
the factory.
The protest was
enthusiastically attended by
Stanford radicals, who had viewed
most END Day activities as a
diversion from revolutionary
goals. The radicals supported the
Owens march as a show of
worker-student solidarity.
Owens-Corning officials deny
there is a health hazard in thy
plant.

Stanford professor Bruce Franklin
took the microphone at one time
to denounce the pollution hazards
to workers in the Santa Clara
plant of Owens Corning fiberglas.
He charged the company with
threatening the leaders of the
employee committee for better
working conditions and having
them trailed by "rent a cops."
About 100 demonstrators,
having gone by bus to the plant,
mostly from the Stanford
community, marched peacefully
for an hour in front of the Owens
Corning plant. They filed along
the sidewalk and gave leaflets to
employees driving into and out of
the factory.
The protest was
enthusiastically attended by
Stanford radicals, who had viewed
most END Day activities as a
diversion from revolutionary
goals. The radicals supported the
Owens march as a show of
worker-student solidarity.
Owens-Corning officials deny
there is a health hazard in thy
plant.

During the afternoon speeches
in White Plaza, Frank Lockfield a
county planner from Santa Clara
urged attention to urban ecology.
"We must focus on housing since
it is housing that determines the
character of the city." Lockfield
accused the government with
responsibility for urban sprawl
through subsidization of middle
income housing.
In the same vein, Naomi
Golden of the Peninsula Fair
Housing Committee called for
provision of adequate "inner
space in low income areas. Lack
of public concern is the heart of
the housing shortage."
Palo Alto engineer Frank
Sebastian told fair-goers that
because the public's thinking is
not ready to accept technology, in
the next 20 years we will turn the
Bay into a sewer and pump
sewage into the ocean. He
described the ultra modern sewage
treatment at Lake Tahoe which,
for 2V2C a day per person about
twice the cost of secondary
sewage treatment, can produce
drinkable water, reclaim
phosphates, destroy DDT and
produce sterile ash for use as road
fill, building material and
fertilizer.
