## Living Costs Increase 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Inflation
stole another nickel out of each
$10 bill in March.
The Labor Department
announced Wednesday that living
costs rose five tenths of one
percent, extending the fastest
price advance in 20 years. Big new
increases in doctor bills and
mortgage interest rates helped
inflate the index.
Officials saw some hope for a
slowdown somewhere ahead,
however. Automobile and gasoline
prices declined, food costs moved
up more slowly, and after
adjusting the figures for seasonal
variations, the increase in
consumer prices was four tenths
of one percent.
That was a bit smaller than
February's five tenths of one
percent seasonally adjusted
increase and better than the six
tenths of one percent increases
recorded in each of the three
preceding months.
There had been hope for a
more convincing price slowdown,
because wholesale prices in March
showed the smallest increase in
seven months.
Berkeley ROTC
BERKELEY (AP) - A special
University of California
faculty-administration
commission has recommended
that ROTC be retained on UC
campusesâ€”but with a number of
changes.
The commission, appointed a
year ago by President Charles
Hitch, said "The university,
because of its interest and
obligations as a public institution
must continue to participate in
the education of students who
aspire to become officers of the
armed forces of the United States
as regulars or reservists."
Last week the Berkeley campus
was the scene of violent
demonstrations by anti-ROTC
protestors.
"The commission is aware of a
wide range of attitudes toward
ROTC," the report said.
CS Gas
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House Armed Services Committee
approved Wednesday the full

$1.45 billion requested by the
Nixon administration for work on
the Safeguard antiballistic missile
system in 1971.
The action came in the wake of
testimony by Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird that
Communist China can develop
inter-continental missiles by 1973
but the first Safeguard site will
not be ready until 1974.
Testifying at a closed hearing
of the House defense
appropriations subcommittee on
Feb. 27, Laird said the Red
Chinese are not expected to have
ICBMs until several years after
1973 and are not expected to be a
serious nuclear threat before the
1980s.
"But," he said, "if the Chinese
threat came into being as early as
1973 there would be a gap of
several years during which the
Chinese could threaten nuclear
blackmail against us."

Penn State
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. (AP) -
Some 1,200 protestors calling for
a boycott of classes gathered
outside the administration
building then marched across
campus Wednesday as a week of
s udent unrest continued
unabeted at Pennsylvania State
University.
The demonstrators, protesting
the arrest of 39 persons, left the
lawn in front of Old Main to
conduct a peaceful march across
campus.
Student leaders said they
wanted amnesty for those
arrested, open communications
with school administrators and an
end to the use of court
injunctions banning
demonstrations inside campus
buildings.
Dr. Eric A. Walker, president
of the university, said most
trustees had rejected demands for
an end to the injunction and
amnesty for those arrested.
'There's a lot of pressure to
expell them immediately."
