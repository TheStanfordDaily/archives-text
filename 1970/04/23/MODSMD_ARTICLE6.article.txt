# Senates To Meet
## 
### 
The Faculty Senate meets
today in a special session to
consider a report of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies on last year's SES
proposals.
The student Senate also has a
meeting scheduled for tonight for
7:30 in gsb 75. Results of the
student body election are to be
announced at the meeting.
In line with the SES (Study of
Education at Stanford) report
released last year, the CUS report
deals with grading structure,
extended course credit,
examination structure, and
expanded directed reading and
research.
The SES report recommended,
among other things, that Stanford
adopt a new system of grading,
allowing only for grades of A, B,
or C. If a teacher felt a student
should get anything lower than
that, the student would merely
not get credit for the course.
Student progress toward
graduation would be considered
by the number of courses
completed.
