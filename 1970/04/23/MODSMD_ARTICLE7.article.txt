# Adversary Format For ROTC Hearings
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
The Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) will use for the first time in
its two-year history, a trial-like
adversary format in the upcoming
Off-ROTC demonstration
hearings.
In all previous cases, the
Judicial Council itself conducted
the investigation and presented
the evidence—acting, in effect, as
prosecutor as well as judge and
jury. That system was strongly
criticized by defendants in last
year's Encina Hall sit-in hearings.
Although no trial date has been
set and no students have been
notified that charges will be
brought against them, there
appears to be little doubt that
such hearings will take place.
Dean of Students, Peter
Bulkeley has sent the SJC names
of 32 students suspected of
violating campus disruption
policy; the administration has
amassed sufficient evidence for
trial presentation, according to
legal advisor to the president
James Siena; and University
officials are now searching for an
administration representative who
is willing to function as
prosecutor.
The administration and the
SJC do not disagree substantially
on procedural matters, as
yesterday's Daily article implied.
Some confusion exists over the
role of SJC Judicial Aides, but
both parties have agreed to the
basic adversary format.

Law students, among others,
have been approached as
candidates for "prosecutor," but
no one has yet been chosen.
Someone outside the University
may ultimately be appointed,
Siena said yesterday, although
the administration would prefer a
member of the community.
Since S.JC decisions are
recommendations to the
President, Siena said, it would be
inappropriate to choose a
"prosecutor" from the President's
or Provost's office. The Dean of
Students is also eliminated by a
clause in the Judicial Charter.
SJC Chairman Marc Franklin
told the administration last
January that he did not want to
function as "prosecutor" in
adversary hearings. Whether a case
shall be classified as adversary,
says Franklin, is determined
primarily by the chairman's "sixth
sense." "You would have to be
blind" not to know the Off-ROTC
case falls in that category, he said.
Law Professor Jack
Friedenthal, chairman of last
year's SJC, said yesterday that the
Encina sit-in hearings were
"eminently fair, in my opinion,"
but had the "appearance" of
unfairness. In order to remove this
appearance of unfairness and to
ease the administrative burden
placed on the chairman, he
proposed before and after the
Encina hearings that an adversary
system be considered.

Law students, among others,
have been approached as
candidates for "prosecutor," but
no one has yet been chosen.
Someone outside the University
may ultimately be appointed,
Siena said yesterday, although
the administration would prefer a
member of the community.
Since S.JC decisions are
recommendations to the
President, Siena said, it would be
inappropriate to choose a
"prosecutor" from the President's
or Provost's office. The Dean of
Students is also eliminated by a
clause in the Judicial Charter.
SJC Chairman Marc Franklin
told the administration last
January that he did not want to
function as "prosecutor" in
adversary hearings. Whether a case
shall be classified as adversary,
says Franklin, is determined
primarily by the chairman's "sixth
sense." "You would have to be
blind" not to know the Off-ROTC
case falls in that category, he said.
Law Professor Jack
Friedenthal, chairman of last
year's SJC, said yesterday that the
Encina sit-in hearings were
"eminently fair, in my opinion,"
but had the "appearance" of
unfairness. In order to remove this
appearance of unfairness and to
ease the administrative burden
placed on the chairman, he
proposed before and after the
Encina hearings that an adversary
system be considered.
The Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) will use for the first time in
its two-year history, a trial-like
adversary format in the upcoming
Off-ROTC demonstration
hearings.
In all previous cases, the
Judicial Council itself conducted
the investigation and presented
the evidence—acting, in effect, as
prosecutor as well as judge and
jury. That system was strongly
criticized by defendants in last
year's Encina Hall sit-in hearings.
Although no trial date has been
set and no students have been
notified that charges will be
brought against them, there
appears to be little doubt that
such hearings will take place.
Dean of Students, Peter
Bulkeley has sent the SJC names
of 32 students suspected of
violating campus disruption
policy; the administration has
amassed sufficient evidence for
trial presentation, according to
legal advisor to the president
James Siena; and University
officials are now searching for an
administration representative who
is willing to function as
prosecutor.
The administration and the
SJC do not disagree substantially
on procedural matters, as
yesterday's Daily article implied.
Some confusion exists over the
role of SJC Judicial Aides, but
both parties have agreed to the
basic adversary format.
