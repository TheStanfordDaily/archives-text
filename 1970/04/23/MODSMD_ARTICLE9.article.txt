# Systems Of Governance
## The 						Process Exists But... 
### John Grube 
The strategy of the Off-ROTC movement, as
represented in the Sunday night Cubberley
meeting, is to force the University through
coercive tactics to move ROTC entirely
off-campus. The issue of academic credit for most
of those assembled was of little importance.
Judging by the Sunday meeting, the cry Thursday
when the administration refuses to meet the
demands of the movement, will be for action in
some form, probably a sit-in. The hope ultimately
is to make the presence of ROTC at Stanford so
costly that the University will be forced to
terminate the program on-campus.
The most vocal and active opponents of ROTC
on-campus have consistently ignored the political
process inherent in the system of governance at
Stanford. This process was capable of
accomplishing the goal of the Off-ROTC
movement, but was never tried. First, dorm
organizing, an effective means of informing and
mobilizing students on a given issue, was not
emphasized and strongly pursued by Off-ROTC
throughout this year.
Second, no effort was made to mobilize student
opinion in the form of a referendum prior to the
vote of the Academic Council this year. A mere
600 signatures on a petition could have brought
the issue before the student body well before the
Academic Council's decision.
A referendum could have been a focal point for
education and Off-ROTC organization. It also
could have clarified, if not contradicted student
views on ROTC as represented in the 1969 Spring
referendumâ€”a student vote that weighed heavily
in this year's Academic Council decision on
ROTC.
Where Were They Then?
Third, the Presidential Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs, the committee charged with the
responsibility of implementing the Academic
Council's decision of 1969, has been entirely
ignored by those who favor ROTC off-campus.
There were no students in the applicant pool last

spring who opposed ROTC on-campus. Only two
of the 16 students who applied wanted ROTC
on-campus but without credit. All but five who
applied had some association with the military.
Some were cadets, some were former cadets and
others were veterans.
This spring, when it was necessary for the
ASSU Committee on Nominations to fill a vacancy
on the committee, not one student out of the six
applicants wanted ROTC off-campus. It is clear
that Off-ROTC has not pushed to have its views
represented on this important committee.
Finally, and most importantly, no systematic
and concerted effort was made by the Off-ROTC
movement to influence the vote of the Academic
Council last quarter. Little, if any, lobbying was
done with faculty members prior to the vote. Such
an effort could have had a considerable impact on
the narrow 17-vote margin and ultimately the
presence of ROTC at Stanford.
Those Who Are Concerned
The issue of ROTC has been in thy political
mill since the fall of 1968. The political process in
its various forms, likewise, has been open for at
least a year for those who are genuinely concerned
about getting ROTC off-campus.
Coercive tactics this spring will not force
faculty reconsideration of the issue and will not
bring about a reversal in this year's decision of the
Academic Council. It is logical to assume that
disruptive tactics will be met by strong and
immediate disciplinary action. It is foolish to
reason otherwise.
For the University to submit to the ultimatum
of a group which has consistently worked outside
of the political process, and which now threatens
coercive action, would be to admit that political
process did not exist or could nto work on this
issue. Clearly, the process exists and, further, it
might well have worked for the Off-ROTC
movement if tried.
