## 
### ED KOHN PHILIP TAUBMAN 
At 1 p.m. Thursday afternoon,
460 ROTC protestors seized the
Old Union.
At 1:10 a.m. this morning, 50
Santa Clara deputies swept
through the building, ending the
sit-in and arresting 13 men and
nine women on charges of
criminal trespass. One juvenile was
also arrested and one student was
being held on charges of assault
and battery with a deadly
weapon.
Asked to clear the building by
the Stanford administration, the
police surprised and angered 125
overnight demonstrators and
bystanders with their blitzkreig.
The polce momentarily
abandoned faculty observers and
swept into the building without
immediate warning, trapping
numerous students.
No serious injuries were
reported. Protestors who fled the
building ahead of the police
retaliated by throwing rocks,
glasses, and a wine jug at sheriffs
deputies guarding the south
entrance to the Old Union.
Windows Shattered
Students later shattered dozens
of windows at the Business
School, President's Office,
Tresidder Union, the Police
Station, the Post Office, Lou
Henry Hoover Library and Encina
Hall.
An Off-ROTC meeting is
scheduled for 8 a.m. today on
White Plaza. Radicals are calling
for a student strike.

The police action ended the
non-violent occupation of the Old
Union which had begun with
scuffles between radicals,
photographers, and members of
the Free Campus Movement
(FCM).
The FCM headquarters was
later unsuccessfully firebombed
with three Molotov-type devices.

By late afternoon, President
Pitzer had ordered the Old Union
closed until 8 a.m. today.
Trespassing Declared
At 5:45 p.m., four Santa Clara
County police officers spoke
briefly with the assembled
protestors. They said all
demonstrators could be arrested
on charges of trespassing.
Demonstrators voted to remain
in the building until the police
came. They planned to move into
the courtyard and re-enter the

A meeting of the Committee of
Fifteen has been called for 9 a.m.
today in Tresidder Union. With
the pleasure of the committee it
will be an open meeting according
to Rick Atkins, chairman. All
people who were at the Old Union
last night and saw the ROTC
arrests are asked to come.

building at 8 a.m. when it opens
for business. They had earlier
decided to remain non-violent and
not to disrupt those who wished
to work in the building.
In the aftermath of the
early-morning police sweep many

people were bitter. Prol. Mark
Mancall, chairman of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, was talking to students in
the building when police arrived.
He was nearly caught and later
attacked the police tactics as
"atrocious." He added, "This is
just unbelievable."
Police Tired
Police admitted they were tired
of being assaulted by rocks in
recent weeks and never arresting
their assailants. Presidential
assistant Willard Wyman noted
last night, "The police intent was
to do something meaningful."
"I've lived in fear of this event
for two years," he said.
Most demonstrators claim
police came with the primary
intent of arresting them and not
to merely disperse them.
Police 'Restraint'
Some observers disagree. Prof.
Joseph Baldridge, education,
observed the police tactics and
said, "I came here 100 percent on
the side of the students—now I am
amazed at the restraint of the
police."
C.D. Marron, field enforcement
supervisor of the Santa Clara
County police, said, "The
students had been warned earlier
in the day that police might come.
We did not set an entrapment. We
simply wanted to minimize any
damage that could take place to
property or persons."
Prof. Philip Dawson, professor
of history and vice-chairman of
the Faculty Senate, who was in

the building while the
demonstrators were being
arrested, said that some people
appeared to be bruised or hit by
police. He said that none appeared
to require hospital treatment.

Ultima tu m
The sit-in began following a
•refusal by the University

administration to comply with a
three-point ultimatum issued by
the Off-ROTC Movement Sunday
night.
400 demonstrators massed on
White Plaza at 12:30 p.m. for a
brief rally. After about 15
minutes of preliminary discussion,
the group voted to begin a sit-in at
the Old Union. They also voted to
bar photographers from the inside

of the building.
Many of those present were
well-prepared for a sit-in. Several
hundred Zorro-type masks were
passed around the plaza, and some
people were carrying small
supplies of food and drink.
Several of the short speeches
on the plaza were interrupted by
members of the FCM, led by
Harvey H. Hukari, Jr. The
counter-demonstrators, chanting
"throw a rock, vote for Shoch,"
carried signs that included "Off
Pali Hi," "Peace on Campus," and
"Stop Campus Radicals."
Door Barred
As the demonstrators
attempted to enter the building,
about 40 FCM supporters tried to
bar the front doors by linking

arms and standing three deep.
Some of the demonstrators
entered through a side door, and
scuffles broke out as they tried to
force the doors open from the
inside.
Roger Reed, president of the
Young Republicans and an FCM
member, was injured as he fought
with Diamuid Maguire and at least
two other persons. He was treated
for facial injuries and released by
Cowell Health Center. Reed was
the only person reported injured.
The demonstrators fought with
cameramen who entered the
building. Several photographers
fought briefly with the
demonstrators before leaving.
At least three reporters and

to escape in time.
