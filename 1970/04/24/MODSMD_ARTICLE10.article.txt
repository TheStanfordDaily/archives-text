# One Man's Fantasie
## Good Old Spring Onanism 
### Mick Selby 
It has all the dramatic intensity of the landing
at Normandy or the seizure of Iwo Jima.
The third annual "Rites of Onan," a
masterpiece in the fine art of political
masturbation, comes to Stanford.
The assault scenario:
Seven well-drilled columns of storm troopers,
dispatched at precise nine-second intervals, sprint
from White Plaza to the placid courtyard in front
of the Old Union.
The stalwart defenders, Dean Peter Z. Bulkeley
and crew, having infiltrated the "Movement" with
innumerable stealthy spies, are more than ready
for the assault.
In short, they have fled, and they remain, so to
speak, "out to lunch."
Several troopers from the initial shock wave
snip the barbed wire in front of the door. Others
take to the ivy vines and scale the battlements.
A window has been carelessly left open. A
combatant succeeds in crawling through. He races
to the elevator, drops down to the first floor,
walks to the door and gives entrance to his fellow
commandos.
The main assault force surges through the gap
in the enemy's forward lines. The troops swell into
the building, then break down into affinity group
strategy sessions to decide on further tactics. A
Vietcong flag is hoisted,

The crowd outside laughs, then yawns.
A snack truck pulls up to sell Hershey candy
bars.
The right-wing attempts to abort the invasion.
Fisticuffs break out. A photographer is punched.
Pandemonium grips the still-yawning throng
outside.
A girl inside is screaming. "What in hell is going
on?" The revolution is happening.
"Where is the pig?" No one knows. The troops
are anxious for the fight. A bust is imminent, but
when will it happen? The troops inside are armed
and polishing their weapons.
Finally there is a group meeting. As always, it
seems interminable. Interminable. Someone
suggests another target. The troops are flushed
with initial success. Encina, the Computation
center. Unbelievably, after all the rumors, there
are still no cops.
Others, possibly counter-revolutionaries,
suggest the troops retreat. A band volunteers for a
party in the courtyard. The heavies remain: they
will decide if a crisis looms.
The battle of the Old Union begins as a circus.
Pitzer labels the frolic a "disruption." Bust or no
bust, the radicals gain nothing. Everyone loses.
No, it has the dramatic purposefulness of a stale
marshmallow, slowly roasting over a smoky
barricade of garbage, even if you're against ROTC.
