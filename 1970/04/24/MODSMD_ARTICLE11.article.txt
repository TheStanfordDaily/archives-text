# Inside The Old Union
## A 						'Business As Usual' Sit-In 
### Felix Gutierrez 
When is a sit-in not a
sit-in?
Thursday afternoon there was
a so-called sit-in on the third floor
of the Old Union Building. But,
aside from a few extra students
sitting in the hallways and a
tightening of security precautions
on the administrative side, there
was really nothing going on. It
was pretty much "business as
usual", as one of the Chicano
students who came to see me
commented.
On my way up the elevator
from lunch I rode with several of
the would-be demonstrators.
About half of them got off on the
second floor where they said
"there might be some action."

The remainder rode up another
floor with me and talked about
the "fun offices" on the third
floor.
"What will we do when we get
there?" asked one fuzzy-faced
demonstrator.
Phone Calls
"Well, last time they didn't
turn off the phone for about two
hours and we made all kinds of
phone calls around the
country-New York, Washington
D.C.," replied a veteran of earlier
Stanford demonstrations.
I looked around the office
when I got there but, since there
wasn't much happening, returned
to the main floor to listen to the
various affinity groups talk with
each other. Later a group of
Chicano students came with me
up to my office and watched as
the demonstrators tried
unsuccessfully to scale the tower
of the Old Union.
Others yelled at us from the
Courtyard and at one point an
official-looking and sounding man
came in to ask if this was my
office and the students my
"guests." We talked a little with
the demonstrators, but most of
them seemed more worried about
scaling the building than
organizing the workers or other
students.
Coors Versus Chicanos
About mid-way through the
afternoon, we decided to go down
to the courtyard. On the way
through the second floor one of
the Chicano students noticed a
scion of the Coors family, of
brewing fame, sitting and talking
with one of the affinity groups.
"What are you doing here?
Why aren't you working at home
where your family is exploiting
Chicano workers," asked the
Chicano students. The brewery is
notorious for its mistreatment of
Chicano workers and a national
boycott of its products has been
called across the Southwest.
"You know man," replied
young Coors, "You can't work
with them. 1 know how bad the
conditions are in the plant. I
worked there for four years."

Boycott Support Promise
After explaining that the
persons in the power structure
were "fascists", he turned his
attention to other matters.
Another young girl asked if the
Chicanos needed help in
organizing demonstrations against
supermarkets because of the grape
boycott and promised to help get
more students to support
MECHA's picket of Lucky
Markets.
The events continued through
the afternoon, with speeches,
rooftop watchers, wall banners,
and occasional visitors spicing up
the late hours. Speakers droned
on. Students yelled up from the
rooftops. And administrative
types scurried busily through the
building.
But there seemed to be little
organization or commitment
throughout the afternoon. One
activist student told me that she
wasn't sitting in because "my
mother is visiting this week."
Another told me "we can't decide
whether to stay overnight, disrupt
activities, or organize the
workers."
That seemed to be the crux of
the problem. Having established
positions within the building, the
demonstrators began to rap about
tactics, rather than objectives.
Their discussions of "organizing
the workers" were extremely
condescending, as though they
felt the secretaries, clerks, and
administrators in the Old Union
were unable to decide on issues
for themselves. On the other
hand, the demonstrators seemed
to have little unity of thought on
their own side.
"It's a circus," one Chicano
student said to me late in the
afternoon. "They're trying to
intellectualize and rationalize the
sit-in and non-violence, which is
something they don't really
understand. How can one organize
anyone else when they can't even
organize themselves."
