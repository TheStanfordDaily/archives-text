# La 						Raza Opposition
## Mecha, Chicanos And ROTC 
### Manuel Cisneros 
On Monday, April 21, Chicanos at Stanford met to draft a
statement on the sentiment of Mecha towards ROTC. The resolution
which resulted from the meeting reads as follows: "We, the Chicano
students in Mecha at Stanford University, condemn ROTC, Military
Training, the draft and programs of counter-insurgency, both on and
off campus. We know that our hermanos are drafted out of the barrios
to die at a 20% rate in Vietnam and that U.S. Military forces are used
to put down social movements in Latin America and our own barrios
of Aztlan.
To us the issue is much greater than just ROTC at Stanford. We
seek the termination of all military programs. We also declare that as
people of La Raza we are able to speak for ourselves and that we do
not need so called white radicals to speak and act for us or our
people."
The significance of this resolution must be understood amidst
opinions expressed by other campus groups. Our cause and our goals
are distinct from other organizations.
Shortcomings In Education
Mecha reflects the attitudes of Chicanos who have found
inordinate faults in present systems of education. Mecha is the
projection in thought of students involved in the political
consequences of Chicanos. It is the student sector devoted only to the
Chicano movement. If Mecha at Stanford, for example, had not
provided pressure in denouncing 1968 admissions practices there
would be no Chicanos on campus.
Mecha is run by Chicanos and not by Mexican-Americans. Chicanos
are not Mexican-American in the first place. This is often the
misunderstanding of mis-informed people. Chicanos have a Mexican
heritage but they are not Mexicans. In the United States people of
Mexican lineage have been looked on as vestiges of American society.
They are an unknown minority. Consequently they are neither
Mexicans nor are they Americans. The cute appellative
Mexican-American becomes the derivation by those in power for this
confused state of mind. The Chicano has answered this
"hyphenation" of cultures with the name CHICANO. And he is going
to add a dash of revolution to complete the purpose of Mecha.
Catalysts of Change
The Chicano and the Chicano movement become catalysts of

change and revolution within and without the university system.
Chicanos have recognized that liberation and real freedom are goals
but not yet products of this society. Chicanos realize liberation is yet
unfulfilled for many segments and classes in America. Women's
liberation, Black liberation and colonial liberation resound ideational
resemblance to Chicano liberation. But there is no liberation for
women if there is no liberation for everyone as well. And there is no
liberation for Chicanos unless Chicanos themselves see to the matter.
Chicanos must do the liberating for Chicanos because only Chicanos
know where incarceration exists. The historical confinement of the
Chicano mind becomes the target of Chicano liberation.
As there is a need for continuous change in the fibre of societies,
Chicanos feel there is need for revolution as well. Civil revolution is
incomplete until people are ready to die for something that will not
change. Blood has been the common denominator of revolutions in
the past. Only where Chicanos are willing to sacrifice their blood for a
stagnant order will revolution begin.
Paralytic Government
Presently, armed revolution is in the minds of many Chicanos. This
seed of discontent perpetuates itself when observing a paralytic
government attempting vainly to accommodate the wretched in the
system. Impatience for revolution (if not reform) harbors the growing
reluctance to accept compromise. And the attitude of Mecha and
Chicanos becomes the condemnation of a socio-political structure
negligent of the growing animosity of ethnic groups.
The condemnation of ROTC at Stanford by Mecha precedes the
idea that you cannot improve humanity by developing murderers. In
Southeast Asia 19.4% of the dead have been Chicano. Yet there are
only 5.6 million Chicanos in this country. The overrepresentation of
Chicanos victims reveals the perversion of political and economic
power that precludes any logic of equality.
There is a solidarity among Chicanos that has prevented violence to
inundate our movement. Violence in all forms has not been a stranger
to Chicanos in the past or at present. At San Quentin, for example,
one-third of the inmates are Chicanos.
Political Violence
Resorting to political violence is condescension to a strategem
peculiar to society when change is unwelcome. Revolution is the
expression of political violence. But the increasing decapitation of
Chicano culture by war, politics, economic exploitation and
educational ostracism becomes the kindling for such violence. Picking
up the rock or picking up the gun become ineffectual gestures in
choking a political monster. And changing a social structure by getting
on more TV commercials becomes equally anachronistic.
The Chicano revolution has not yet thrived on political violence.
Nor has it enhanced its cause with theatrics of liberation. But
revolutionary change requires martyrdom. Chicanos have accepted
that fact.
Community Testacies
The disease of the monster is not in Building 10. Nor is it only
within black-and-white cars. But there is a disease and there is a
monster. Its testicles cannot be destroyed until it is killed in
communities where it lives. Condemnation of ROTC and military
fanaticism is but the beginning of social revolution in this country.
For Mecha and Chicanos at Stanford, the illness hurts more in the
communities we know as home. Ignorance and its control of mind
provide a strategic enemy whose annihilation we seek. With
philosophy, the answer is too simple. But so is the alternative of
revolution. The Mexican Revolution never ended. It just has a new
face.

Training, the draft and programs of counter-insurgency, both on and
off campus. We know that our hermanos are drafted out of the barrios
to die at a 20% rate in Vietnam and that U.S. Military forces are used
to put down social movements in Latin America and our own barrios
of Aztlan.
To us the issue is much greater than just ROTC at Stanford. We
seek the termination of all military programs. We also declare that as
people of La Raza we are able to speak for ourselves and that we do
not need so called white radicals to speak and act for us or our
people."
The significance of this resolution must be understood amidst

Shortcomings In Education
Mecha reflects the attitudes of Chicanos who have found
inordinate faults in present systems of education. Mecha is the
projection in thought of students involved in the political
consequences of Chicanos. It is the student sector devoted only to the
Chicano movement. If Mecha at Stanford, for example, had not
provided pressure in denouncing 1968 admissions practices there
would be no Chicanos on campus.
Mecha is run by Chicanos and not by Mexican-Americans. Chicanos
are not Mexican-American in the first place. This is often the
misunderstanding of mis-informed people. Chicanos have a Mexican
heritage but they are not Mexicans. In the United States people of
Mexican lineage have been looked on as vestiges of American society.
They are an unknown minority. Consequently they are neither
Mexicans nor are they Americans. The cute appellative
Mexican-American becomes the derivation by those in power for this
confused state of mind. The Chicano has answered this
"hyphenation" of cultures with the name CHICANO. And he is going
to add a dash of revolution to complete the purpose of Mecha.
Catalysts of Change
The Chicano and the Chicano movement become catalysts of

change and revolution within and without the university system.
Chicanos have recognized that liberation and real freedom are goals
but not yet products of this society. Chicanos realize liberation is yet
unfulfilled for many segments and classes in America. Women's
liberation, Black liberation and colonial liberation resound ideational
resemblance to Chicano liberation. But there is no liberation for
women if there is no liberation for everyone as well. And there is no
liberation for Chicanos unless Chicanos themselves see to the matter.
Chicanos must do the liberating for Chicanos because only Chicanos
know where incarceration exists. The historical confinement of the
Chicano mind becomes the target of Chicano liberation.
As there is a need for continuous change in the fibre of societies,
Chicanos feel there is need for revolution as well. Civil revolution is
incomplete until people are ready to die for something that will not
change. Blood has been the common denominator of revolutions in
the past. Only where Chicanos are willing to sacrifice their blood for a
stagnant order will revolution begin.
Paralytic Government
Presently, armed revolution is in the minds of many Chicanos. This
seed of discontent perpetuates itself when observing a paralytic
government attempting vainly to accommodate the wretched in the
system. Impatience for revolution (if not reform) harbors the growing
reluctance to accept compromise. And the attitude of Mecha and
Chicanos becomes the condemnation of a socio-political structure
negligent of the growing animosity of ethnic groups.
The condemnation of ROTC at Stanford by Mecha precedes the
idea that you cannot improve humanity by developing murderers. In
Southeast Asia 19.4% of the dead have been Chicano. Yet there are
only 5.6 million Chicanos in this country. The overrepresentation of
Chicanos victims reveals the perversion of political and economic
power that precludes any logic of equality.
There is a solidarity among Chicanos that has prevented violence to
inundate our movement. Violence in all forms has not been a stranger
to Chicanos in the past or at present. At San Quentin, for example,
one-third of the inmates are Chicanos.
Political Violence
Resorting to political violence is condescension to a strategem
peculiar to society when change is unwelcome. Revolution is the
expression of political violence. But the increasing decapitation of
Chicano culture by war, politics, economic exploitation and
educational ostracism becomes the kindling for such violence. Picking
up the rock or picking up the gun become ineffectual gestures in
choking a political monster. And changing a social structure by getting
on more TV commercials becomes equally anachronistic.
The Chicano revolution has not yet thrived on political violence.
Nor has it enhanced its cause with theatrics of liberation. But
revolutionary change requires martyrdom. Chicanos have accepted
that fact.
Community Testacies
The disease of the monster is not in Building 10. Nor is it only
within black-and-white cars. But there is a disease and there is a
monster. Its testicles cannot be destroyed until it is killed in
communities where it lives. Condemnation of ROTC and military
fanaticism is but the beginning of social revolution in this country.
For Mecha and Chicanos at Stanford, the illness hurts more in the
communities we know as home. Ignorance and its control of mind
provide a strategic enemy whose annihilation we seek. With
philosophy, the answer is too simple. But so is the alternative of
revolution. The Mexican Revolution never ended. It just has a new
face.

science.)
On Monday, April 21, Chicanos at Stanford met to draft a

of Aztlan.
To us the issue is much greater than just ROTC at Stanford. We
seek the termination of all military programs. We also declare that as
people of La Raza we are able to speak for ourselves and that we do
not need so called white radicals to speak and act for us or our
people."
The significance of this resolution must be understood amidst
opinions expressed by other campus groups. Our cause and our goals
are distinct from other organizations.
Shortcomings In Education
Mecha reflects the attitudes of Chicanos who have found
inordinate faults in present systems of education. Mecha is the
projection in thought of students involved in the political
consequences of Chicanos. It is the student sector devoted only to the
Chicano movement. If Mecha at Stanford, for example, had not
provided pressure in denouncing 1968 admissions practices there
would be no Chicanos on campus.
Mecha is run by Chicanos and not by Mexican-Americans. Chicanos
are not Mexican-American in the first place. This is often the
misunderstanding of mis-informed people. Chicanos have a Mexican
heritage but they are not Mexicans. In the United States people of
Mexican lineage have been looked on as vestiges of American society.
They are an unknown minority. Consequently they are neither
Mexicans nor are they Americans. The cute appellative
Mexican-American becomes the derivation by those in power for this
confused state of mind. The Chicano has answered this
"hyphenation" of cultures with the name CHICANO. And he is going
to add a dash of revolution to complete the purpose of Mecha.
Catalysts of Change
The Chicano and the Chicano movement become catalysts of

change and revolution within and without the university system.
Chicanos have recognized that liberation and real freedom are goals
but not yet products of this society. Chicanos realize liberation is yet
unfulfilled for many segments and classes in America. Women's
liberation, Black liberation and colonial liberation resound ideational
resemblance to Chicano liberation. But there is no liberation for
women if there is no liberation for everyone as well. And there is no
liberation for Chicanos unless Chicanos themselves see to the matter.
Chicanos must do the liberating for Chicanos because only Chicanos
know where incarceration exists. The historical confinement of the
Chicano mind becomes the target of Chicano liberation.
As there is a need for continuous change in the fibre of societies,
Chicanos feel there is need for revolution as well. Civil revolution is
incomplete until people are ready to die for something that will not
change. Blood has been the common denominator of revolutions in
the past. Only where Chicanos are willing to sacrifice their blood for a
stagnant order will revolution begin.
Paralytic Government
Presently, armed revolution is in the minds of many Chicanos. This
seed of discontent perpetuates itself when observing a paralytic
government attempting vainly to accommodate the wretched in the
system. Impatience for revolution (if not reform) harbors the growing
reluctance to accept compromise. And the attitude of Mecha and
Chicanos becomes the condemnation of a socio-political structure
negligent of the growing animosity of ethnic groups.
The condemnation of ROTC at Stanford by Mecha precedes the
idea that you cannot improve humanity by developing murderers. In
Southeast Asia 19.4% of the dead have been Chicano. Yet there are
only 5.6 million Chicanos in this country. The overrepresentation of
Chicanos victims reveals the perversion of political and economic
power that precludes any logic of equality.
There is a solidarity among Chicanos that has prevented violence to
inundate our movement. Violence in all forms has not been a stranger
to Chicanos in the past or at present. At San Quentin, for example,
one-third of the inmates are Chicanos.
Political Violence
Resorting to political violence is condescension to a strategem
peculiar to society when change is unwelcome. Revolution is the
expression of political violence. But the increasing decapitation of
Chicano culture by war, politics, economic exploitation and
educational ostracism becomes the kindling for such violence. Picking
up the rock or picking up the gun become ineffectual gestures in
choking a political monster. And changing a social structure by getting
on more TV commercials becomes equally anachronistic.
The Chicano revolution has not yet thrived on political violence.
Nor has it enhanced its cause with theatrics of liberation. But
revolutionary change requires martyrdom. Chicanos have accepted
that fact.
Community Testacies
The disease of the monster is not in Building 10. Nor is it only
within black-and-white cars. But there is a disease and there is a
monster. Its testicles cannot be destroyed until it is killed in
communities where it lives. Condemnation of ROTC and military
fanaticism is but the beginning of social revolution in this country.
For Mecha and Chicanos at Stanford, the illness hurts more in the
communities we know as home. Ignorance and its control of mind
provide a strategic enemy whose annihilation we seek. With
philosophy, the answer is too simple. But so is the alternative of
revolution. The Mexican Revolution never ended. It just has a new
face.

science.)
On Monday, April 21, Chicanos at Stanford met to draft a
statement on the sentiment of Mecha towards ROTC. The resolution
which resulted from the meeting reads as follows: "We, the Chicano
students in Mecha at Stanford University, condemn ROTC, Military
Training, the draft and programs of counter-insurgency, both on and
off campus. We know that our hermanos are drafted out of the barrios
to die at a 20% rate in Vietnam and that U.S. Military forces are used
to put down social movements in Latin America and our own barrios
of Aztlan.
To us the issue is much greater than just ROTC at Stanford. We
seek the termination of all military programs. We also declare that as
people of La Raza we are able to speak for ourselves and that we do
not need so called white radicals to speak and act for us or our
people."
