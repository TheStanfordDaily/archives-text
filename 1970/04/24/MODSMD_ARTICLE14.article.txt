# Pitzer And ROTC
## 
### Lee Herzenberg 
President Pitzer seems to have
a strong feeling about binding
commitments. We have apparently
already made binding
commitments to the army
promising credit, subject to
approval by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, for ROTC
courses. We entered into
negotiations with Dillingham
Corporation for development of a
site at the corner of Page Mill and
El Camino, on the basis of which
Dillingham spent hard money do
draw plans, which committed us
to signing the lease. We cut up
Coyote Hill with roads and
declared it subdivided into
industrial lots, and are therefore
committed to twelve new firms in
the industrial park.
Not so long ago, Honor Our
Commitments in South East Asia
became the battle cry for
continuation of the war in Viet
Nam, dredged up when no other
reason could be advanced that
could appeal to men of good
conscience who recognized that
we were there aggressors in an
unjust war. But who made the
committments in Viet Nam? And
Why?
And who made the
commitment to Dillingham? And
who decided to cut up Coyote
Hill? How can President Pitzer tell
us he is justified in asking the
faculty to reconsider its decision
when the Army asks him to, but
not when the students of his own
University do? Can all the
legalities and niceties of

governance explain why it was
necessary to make binding
commitments before the outcome
of the student referendum was
known, especially when the
faculty was so closely divided? In
such a system, does it really
matter whether the class bell ring
on time?
Just commitments by a just
administration deserve to be
honored, regardless of
disagreements among the
electorate, but when
commitments are repeatedly made
by an administration against the
will of a large segment of their
public, appeal for respect for such
commitment is an invitation to
anarchy. Enforcement of those
commitments is the beginning of
repression.
