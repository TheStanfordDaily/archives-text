Art Correction
Editor, The Daily:
The following letter was sent
to you on April 20, 1970i It
contains a statement of fact which
is intended to correct
misinformation published earlier
in the DAILY. You are no doubt
aware of the widespread belief,
held by students and faculty at
Stanford, that the DAILY
systematically suppresses factual
information when that
information interferes with the
DAILY's editorial slant. I, for
one, shall be curious to see
whether you will publish this
letter, including this introductory
paragraph which sheds light on
the delay in the publication of my
original statement.
"A letter from Mr. Bob Cory in
today's Daily uses, by way of
illustration of what Mr. Cory calls
the "systematic impoverishment
of undergraduate education" at
Stanford, the administration's
decision "to cut or eliminate the
undergraduate departments of
Art, Architecture, Drama, and
Speech."
I wonder on what facts Mr.
Cory bases his claims, so far as the
Departments of Art and of
Architecture are concerned?
No cuts are planned in the
undergraduate offering in art. This
Department has grown five or
sixfold in the last six years. It is
not an apt illustration of
education." On the contrary: the
growth of the Department of Art
illustrates the very impressive
support which the University has
given in recent years to areas in
the humanities which had
previously been neglected.
If Mr. Cory is interested in the
facts of this growth and support -
and his letter suggests that he
ought to be interested in these
facts - I invite him to meet with
me for an exchange of
information."
Cordially,
Lorenz Eitner
Chairman

The Daily withheld Prof.
Eitner's letter for reasons of space
not editorial prejudice. We would
like to run every letter we receive
as soon as possible, but frankly
this is impossible. We regret any
misunderstanding that may have
arisen—Ed.
Incredible Journal
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily is an incredible
journal.
Let mobs of Yahoos go on
stone-throwing rampages, disrupt
meetings, occupy buildings and
openly plan the destruction of a
university, and you remain silent.
But let those be cited who have
taken part in disruptive activities,
and you respond with an
indignant editorial.
When in the world are you
going to wake up to the fact that
you are playing a familiar radical
game, one played in Berkeley,
Chicago, Columbia and Stanford?
The game is simply one of steady
harassment and intimidation until
a response is provoked that drives
support to the side of the radicals.
First they trample the rights of
others, then they scream that
their own rights are being
infringed upon when legal action
is taken against them. And the
great defenders of freedom who
said nothing when others were
bullied quickly leap to the defense
of the bullies.
Due process and constitutional
rights of defendants of course
must be observed. But for
heaven's sake, please wake up to
the "scenario" the radicals are
using. They have written it well
and practiced it often, using a
different "issue" each time. It is a
clever game, and this campus
plays it every spring.
Stanley Reden
The Real Victim
Editor, The Daily:
Wednesday afternoon while
wandering through the
Environmental Fair I happened
upon a gathering of people at a

game entitled "Resource
Monopoly." From the rear of the
crowd I could hear two young
men conducting the ({ame, which
was played on a life-sized
monopoly board painted on the
pavement with various
underdeveloped countries
(including Alaska) in place of the
traditional avenues and streets,
and live persons replacing the
normal playing pieces. Shouts and
applause arose as the players hit
"chance" blocks and a revolution
was declared; and, hisses and boos
predominated as capitalists
exploited the resources of the
underdeveloped countries by
picking up resource deeds as they
landed on a given square. The
capitalists were, of course, the
players, who moved from square
to ;;r- ;q on the throw of a rather
iurg' < ! i. . It seemed like typical
radii,. . iun and games until I got a
closer look. There on the playing
board were three young children
(less than 12 years old) throwing
the die and snatching up deeds,
plus two grown men taking the
deeds away as revolutions and war
conquered the capitalists. The
ultimate irony was that as the two
MC's commented on "capitalistic
exploitation" and "U.S.
imperialism" between playing
moves, the youngsters, although
hesitating at first, began to clap
and cheer with the audience. I
wonder who was the real victim:
the children who were the pawns
or the audience whose
participation sanctioned the
exploitation of the innocent
players.

Rupert
Editor, The Daily:
Paul Rupert's sentence of being
barred from Santa Clara County
makes me feel extremely uneasy.
The University administration's
not very subtle provision of
"information" to the judge
compounds my uneasiness.
The judge and the
Administration of the University

seem to be considering Paul
Rupert a "troublemaker"; And
then to be thinking that the way
to keep trouble from occurring is
to get rid of "troublemakers".
Such a view of our present
troubles grossly underestimates
their seriousness, I believe. Paul
Rupert and other like him who
are often seen as "troublemakers"
are not the makers of the troubles
of our institutions. They are
rather the witnesses of our
troubles and our crimes.
Eliminating the witnesses will
not eliminate the crimes. In fact
there is a deep American heritage
which puts such witnesses at the
very center of democratic
evolution. They are the precious
indicators of a need to change.
Nancy M. Samelson
True Madman
Editor, The Daily:
Whatever the politics or
ideological (idiot-logical?) beliefs
of the Stanford U students,
faculty and administration, I hope
they will someday realize what
excrutiatingly poor judgement
was shown yesterday by
permitting Jerry Rubin to appear
on campus, ranting and raving in
his stoned state like a true
madman—when meanwhile three
very courageous astronauts were
striving for life aboard the Apollo
13.
Jerry Rubin is indecent
wherever he goes. Since this is a
recognized fact, there must be
some reason why the Stanford
Administration allowed him on
campus at all!!
Sincerely,
Mrs. Elisabeth Pforr
Injunction Fair?
Editor,The Daily:
Provost Lyman, in his letter to
the Daily, of April 15, 1970,
stated that the University has
cited five students for contempt
of the injunction in order to
protect the injunction and will
refer the same five to the Stanford
Judicial Council in order to
protect the internal judicial

system. A lawyer friend of mine
informs me that such a procedure
does not, legally speaking,
constitute the creation of "double
jeopardy." To my mind it does
constitute what the British and, I
should have thought, any person
of common sense would call an
"inequity." I can imagine, for
example, a situation in which the
civil court fines a graduate student
and the SJC removes the graduate
student from a position as
teaching assistant and hence from
the means of earning the income
with which to pay the civil court's
fine. Any procedure which creates
that possibility ought to be
rejected in the name of protecting
people—a matter that should be
kept in mind as we busily protect
injunctions and systems. I hope
the Provost will reconsider his
intention to refer the five students
to the SJC.
