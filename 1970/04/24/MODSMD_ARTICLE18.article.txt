# 'Fixer', 'Night And Fog' Highlighting Films
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Several individuals have
organized film series that offer an
opportunity to expand one's level
of intellectual and social
awareness without threat of
physical abuse. Show your
gratitude by attending at least one
of the seven programs offered this
weekend.
Tonight, Genesis returns with
another collection of award
winning independent and student
films. "Genesis I" was a great
success at Stanford last year, and
this current program "Genesis II"
promises to be even better. It's
being prested by ASSU at 7 and
9:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
Also this evening, Tresidder
Union continues the Silent Film
Series with "Mother" (1926) and
"Earth" (1930) at 7, 8, and 9 in
Tresidder. "La Dolce Vita" will be
shown at 7:30 and 10:30 in
Cubberley. Refer to last Monday's
Daily for further details.
Documentary
Saturday at 7, 8, and 9 in
Tresidder, "Night and Fog" and
"Love Affair" will be screened.
"Love Affair," a Yugoslavian film
directed by Dusan Makavejev,
alternates between clever comedy
and a casual tragedy in its
exploration of the relation
between sex and crime.
"Night and Fog," directed by
Alain Resnais, is an incredible
documentary on concentration
camps that contrasts footage of
the camps today that stand as
memorials to the human beings
slaughtered during the war with

actual pictures of the unbelievable
conditions under which those
people died. It's impossible to
comprehend how men could have
been responsible for such horror,
but after seeing "Night and Fog"
you'll never forget that it did
happen.
At 7, 9, and 11 the same
evening in Cubberley, The
Company will present "David and
Lisa," an overly sentimental story
of two children with
psychological problems who still
manage to fall in love.
Sunday afternoon at 2:30 in
Memorial Auditorium, the
Chinese Student Association plans
to present "Last Woman of
Shang."
Sunday Flicks
Stanford's answer to Sunday
Night at the Movies will feature
John Frankenheimer's filmed
version of Bernard Malamud's
novel "The Fixer," at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium. Hie story
is based on the actual case of
Mendel Beiliss, a Russian Jew who
was wrongly imprisoned for the
"ritual murder" of a Gentile child.
The film records the years he
spent in prison merely awaiting
his trial, during which he was
systematically tormented,
humiliated, and abused in an
effort to make him confess to the
charges against him.
Alan Bates ("Georgy Girl,"
"King of Hearts," "Zorba the
Greek," and, .jnost recently
"Women in Love") portrays the
apolitical, unreligious Yakov Bok
(Mendel Beiliss) who is forced to

draw upon basic human instincts
in order to survive.
The two major faults for which
the film has been criticized are the
distracting medley of accents that
range from Cockney to Bronxey
and for having been filmed in
cheerful color. Despite such
obvious, but minor flaws, "The
Fixer" has been described as
repellent, sensitive, irrelevent,
sadistic, and a splendid humanistic
document worthy of your closest
attention.

The Surf Interplayers, located
on Beach Street near Hyde
(between the Cannery and
Ghiradelli Square) is presenting a
program entitled MGM's Golden
Age, a series of forty classics to be
shown through July. None of the
films are in theatrical release
today and most of them have
never been shown on television or
on the Stanford campus.
The theater will feature films
starring such greats as Greta
Garbo, John Gilbert, W.C. Fields,
Lon Chaney, Jean Harlow, Lillian
Gish and Rudolph Valentino. If
you happen to be in San
Francisco and looking for
something to do, go down to the
Wharf and see what Hollywood
was once all about.
I highly recommend
"M*A*S*H", one of the funniest
Army comedies ever made. What's
so funny about the Army? Ask
yourself that question after
you've seen the movie.
"M*A*S*H" tells it like John
Wayne never could.

this current program "Genesis II"
promises to be even better. It's
being prested by ASSU at 7 and

Also this evening, Tresidder
Union continues the Silent Film
Series with "Mother" (1926) and
"Earth" (1930) at 7, 8, and 9 in
Tresidder. "La Dolce Vita" will be
shown at 7:30 and 10:30 in
Cubberley. Refer to last Monday's
Daily for further details.
Documentary
Saturday at 7, 8, and 9 in
Tresidder, "Night and Fog" and
"Love Affair" will be screened.
"Love Affair," a Yugoslavian film
directed by Dusan Makavejev,
alternates between clever comedy
and a casual tragedy in its
exploration of the relation
between sex and crime.
"Night and Fog," directed by
Alain Resnais, is an incredible
documentary on concentration
camps that contrasts footage of
the camps today that stand as
memorials to the human beings
slaughtered during the war with

actual pictures of the unbelievable
conditions under which those
people died. It's impossible to
comprehend how men could have
been responsible for such horror,
but after seeing "Night and Fog"
you'll never forget that it did
happen.
At 7, 9, and 11 the same
evening in Cubberley, The
Company will present "David and
Lisa," an overly sentimental story
of two children with
psychological problems who still
manage to fall in love.
Sunday afternoon at 2:30 in
Memorial Auditorium, the
Chinese Student Association plans
to present "Last Woman of
Shang."
Sunday Flicks
Stanford's answer to Sunday
Night at the Movies will feature
John Frankenheimer's filmed
version of Bernard Malamud's
novel "The Fixer," at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium. Hie story
is based on the actual case of
Mendel Beiliss, a Russian Jew who
was wrongly imprisoned for the
"ritual murder" of a Gentile child.
The film records the years he
spent in prison merely awaiting
his trial, during which he was
systematically tormented,
humiliated, and abused in an
effort to make him confess to the
charges against him.
Alan Bates ("Georgy Girl,"
"King of Hearts," "Zorba the
Greek," and, .jnost recently
"Women in Love") portrays the
apolitical, unreligious Yakov Bok
(Mendel Beiliss) who is forced to

draw upon basic human instincts
in order to survive.
The two major faults for which
the film has been criticized are the
distracting medley of accents that
range from Cockney to Bronxey
and for having been filmed in
cheerful color. Despite such
obvious, but minor flaws, "The
Fixer" has been described as
repellent, sensitive, irrelevent,
sadistic, and a splendid humanistic
document worthy of your closest
attention.

films are in theatrical release
today and most of them have
never been shown on television or
on the Stanford campus.
The theater will feature films
starring such greats as Greta
