## Selling A Clean Environment 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
As I sat in the corner of White
Plaza, taking in the sights, sounds,
and smells of the overcrowded
eco-fair I was approached by a
small gnome who came and sat on
my knee. Although he was only
17 inches high, he seemed like an
industrial giant in his Brooks
Brother's suit and corporate trim
hair. As he lit a large cigar and
threw the wrapper to the
pavement, he explained that he
had chosen me to tell his solution
to the environmental problems.
"The trouble is that you are all
approaching the problem from the
wrong direction," he related, his
beady eyes glistening and his
fingers tenderly caressing the
stock certificates in his pocket.
"You young hippy freaks are
trying to stop the flow of
necessities to the American people
and strangle the industrial sector
that has made this country what it
is."
"Polluted?" I queried.
The American Way
"No, efficient," he retorted.
"Without big business you
wouldn't have tin cans,
automobiles, electrical power,
enzyme detergents, or any of
those other things that pile up to
form the foundations of
democracy."
"But what do we do about the
mess, the polluted air, the unsafe
water, the additives to food, or
the noise problem?" I pleaded.
Selling Ecology
A broad grin covered the
gnomes face and I could see
visions of stock options and net
earnings dancing in his head.
"Instead of trying to give people

clean air and water, sell it to
them, that's the American way."
He knew he wasn't getting
through to me so he explained.
"Don't take away all the
pollution," he explained, "sell the
people protection from it. Don't
you realize the number of
manufacturing jobs that would be
created by consumer protection
industries?" He pulled a set of
blueprints from between a set of
annual reports and showed me his
proposed design for a gunk suit,
to be marketed to the public at
large.
"See how the helmet on the
suit filters the air and boils the
water automatically? Notice how
the whole suite is lead lined to
protect from radiation? Did you
catch the way the hip boots
provide positive traction for
wading through knee high
garbage?" It dawned on me that
he was right. A multi-billion dollar
industry was all set out on paper,
waiting to be used.
Dcm ocracy
The fallacy in my reasoning, he
explained, was that I had
expected industry to clean itself
up. It is the people's right to
defend themselves since we live in
a democracy. This new product
would provide defense against all
possible environmental crises.
The possibilities were
en or mousâ€”fashion designers
could design fall and spring styles
of gunk-suits; new shops would
open to sell and repair man's new
shield against the elements; deluxe
models with stereo and mink
lining could be introduced. Every
man, woman, and child would
have to buy one.

The dollar signs began to well
up in my brain as the tears
trickled down my cheeks. This
gnome was no ordinary arm of the
industrial/military /big business
complex, but he was a seer, a
prophet, a mini-god who found
the way to equate pollution with
profit.
Before I could thank him for
the enlightenment, he was off in a
cloud of smoke as he wheeled his
fume-belching super-car through
the crowd, closely followed by a
board of directors. I inhaled
deeply on the precious vapors and
murmured a small prayer in
thanks for thp American way.
