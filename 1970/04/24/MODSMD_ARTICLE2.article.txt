# Shea-Grant Win With 3-2 Margin
## 
### DAVID BRENNER 
The Pat C. Shea-Hal Mickelson-Bob
Grant-Adam Levin slate defeated the John
Shoch-Bill Evers ticket to win the ASSU
presidency by a wide margin of 3108 to 2027.
Though choosing to elect the Shea slate that
had campaigned on the promise to expand ASSU
student services, students voted to pay the $1 fee
assessment instead of the $3 fee by 2855 to 2298.
However this money will be supplemented by the
$1 special events fee passed last week and a
$34,000 grant from the University.
Support for Ralph Nader's proposals to "tame"
General Motors passed overwhelmingly. The first
measure, calling for the formation of a watchdog
committee for Corporate Responsibility passed
4260 to 662.
The second measure would add three
"representatives of the people" new members to
the GM Board of Directors passed 3967 to 786.
Students voted 3849 to 935 to ask
reconsideration of the administration decision to
cut back the budget of the Speech and Drama
Department.
In the contest for the Senior Class presidency
the team of John Ford, Dave Velasquez, Teresa
Cady, and John Elger gained a narrow victory over
Taylor Crosby, Margaret Earl, and Philip Feldman
by a vote of 390 to 369.
Results of the SCLC (Student Conduct
Legislative Council) election of last week are still
unknown. The long period between the casting of
ballots and announcements of results stems from
the use of the Hare system for proportional
balloting.

Commenting on their victory Shea, Mickelson,
Grant, and Levin stated;
"Victory statements have a way of being
pompous and pointless. After these weeks of
campaigning, we are tired enough to want simply
to thank our workers and those who chose to vote
for us.
"The vote in this election was a vote for a
responsible ASSUâ€”an organization which
represents and serves the whole student
community. We pledge that all student viewpoints
will be heard within ASSU during the coming year.
We invite the participation of all Stanford students
in the work before us."
Shoch and Evers issued a statement declaring,
"We thank our two thousand supporters, but
we ask them to remember Thoreau's dictum that
voting for the right is doing nothing for it.
Electoral participation is not sufficient. We both
intend to continue to work for fundamental
change in the University and in the society at
large. Our opponents' victory means that once
again the ASSU will not be the scene of the real
politics at Stanford."
Earlier in the evening Shoch offered an
informal comment,
"While the council of presidents accumulated
more votes, Bill and I have won this election. We
won because we ran with our politics up front and
without compromising our beliefs or our integrity.
The extent of our support is indicative of
increasing sensitivity to basic political questions
and the strength of radical analysis."
