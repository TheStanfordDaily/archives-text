# Hornsby's Highlights
## New Releases And Old Friends 
### 
The post-Christmas lull in rock
releases is definitely over—besides
the usual heap of obscure trash,
we actually find some new
material by name artists.
Unfortunately, not much of it is
up to expectations, but learning
to live with disappointment is
probably good training for the
future.
The best feature of Jimi
Hendrix's new album recorded
live at the Fillmore East on last
New Year's Eve is three fantastic
pictures of the funky-lookin
leftie. Hendrix can play with an
edge, yet both his voice and his
guitar can be mellow without
becoming muddled. His early
albums had the incredible
diversity of songs like "Fire,"
"Hey, Joe," "Axis, Bold as Love,"
and"The Wind Cried Mary." The
rhythm section of Noel Redding
and Mitch Mitchell were able to
be interesting in slower material
and indescribably driving in the
hot stuff. Electric Ladyland was
the last Experience album and,
though it showed some distressing
trends, it was a double set and
there were many interesting
contrasts.
The Experience split, however,
and Jimi took to touring with
various friends under the name,
Band of Gypsies. In a marathon
interview with Rolling Stone last
year, he disclosed that this move
was a rejection of the style and
hype which had brought him
fame. It was an attempt to get
away from structured songs and
just work out with nice people. "I
don't want to be a clown
anymore," he said, suggesting that
he had burned his last guitar (you
can catch this act in Monterey
Fop).

I just can't get it on for the
direction he has chosen. He has
been playing mostly with Buddy
Miles and Billy Cox; these two
may have more "soul" than
Redding and Mitchell, but they
sure don't have as much talent. I
absolutely cannot abide Buddy
Miles' voice (in 3 songs on this
album); it is without redeeming
social value.
Hendrix is without question a
great guitar player, a fantastic

singer, and an excellent songwriter
(Crosstown Traffic is pure genius);
the best thing to do is borrow the
album from a friend, tape it, and
derail what's left of the Buddy
Miles Express whenever you hear
it comin'.
Ampex has decided to get into
the record business to protect the
position in tapes, if you can dig
that. The reasoning, and I'll only
tell you once, is that with 35
percent of the recorded music

business going to pre-recorded
tapes, vinyl makers are trying to
sneak into the acetate business.
Therefore, Ampex feels that it
needs its own stable of artists to
preserve its market dominance,
and we all know how important
that is—right?
The first addition to this stable
is no nag, but rather a fine
country trotter named Jesse
Winchester. The Band has had a
tremendous influence on this
album, but Winchester has a great
voice and adds plenty of
originality to it. Produced by
Robbie Robinson (the guitar
player of the Band), the rock is
provided by great backup with
fantastic drumming by Levon
Helm (best known for singing
"The Weight") and two other
guys. Between the drums and the
snappy piano (some of which is
played by Jesse himself), the
album really drives. The
production is smooth, and the
material is good. The vocal in
"Skip Rope Song" has an
uncanny resemblance to Tim
Buckley ("Hello/Goodbye") and
overall is very pleasant. "Snow"
has great Robinson guitar, nice
chord changes, and a great
sentiment, "And I'm here to say,
if winter comes/The spring is way
behind."
Tommy James and the
Shondells rank with Humble Pie
as the most imitative group in

existence. Their new release,
Travelin', contains a bald-faced
imitation of the descant in the
Beatles "Come Together."
"Candy Maker," the song is
called. The drumming in this same
song was borrowed from Spooky
Tooth's "Waiting in the Wind,"
and there are a bunch of chord
changes last heard on Jim Webb
material. It is a record full of
cliches and studio gimmicks.
BiH Graham must have heard
of the good reviews we've been
giving to the Family Dog, because
he's bringing in some good people.
Small Faces (whose album with
Rod Stewart will be reviewed next
week) and Poco will appear in
May, and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young will be at Winterland from
April 30 to May 3. This weekend
Joe Cocker is featured with Van
Morrison and Stonemans also on
the bill. Joe is a flashy performer
on the rarely-seen no-string guitar,
and has one of the best voices in
rock. The Dog, however, is not to
be caught sleeping; Quicksilver
will be featured this
weekend—look for me in the front
row.
Country Joe and the Fish will
appear along with Eric Burdon's
exciting new group, WAR, in
support of END Sunday
afternoon in Frost. The Fish are
always especially appropriate at a
"politically conscious" occasions.
Tlie cause is good so pay
up—think what a trip to the city
and an evening with Bill Graham
costs.


COMlNG—Country Joe and the Fish head the cast for Sunday's ecology concert
at Froet.

afternoon in Frost. The Fish are
always especially appropriate at a
"politically conscious" occasions.
Tlie cause is good so pay
up—think what a trip to the city
and an evening with Bill Graham
costs.


COMlNG—Country Joe and the Fish head the cast for Sunday's ecology concert
at Froet.
The post-Christmas lull in rock
releases is definitely over—besides
the usual heap of obscure trash,
we actually find some new
material by name artists.
Unfortunately, not much of it is
up to expectations, but learning
to live with disappointment is
probably good training for the
future.
The best feature of Jimi
Hendrix's new album recorded
live at the Fillmore East on last
New Year's Eve is three fantastic
pictures of the funky-lookin
leftie. Hendrix can play with an
edge, yet both his voice and his
guitar can be mellow without
becoming muddled. His early
albums had the incredible
diversity of songs like "Fire,"
"Hey, Joe," "Axis, Bold as Love,"
and"The Wind Cried Mary." The
rhythm section of Noel Redding
and Mitch Mitchell were able to
be interesting in slower material
and indescribably driving in the
hot stuff. Electric Ladyland was
the last Experience album and,
though it showed some distressing
trends, it was a double set and
there were many interesting
contrasts.
The Experience split, however,
and Jimi took to touring with
various friends under the name,
Band of Gypsies. In a marathon
interview with Rolling Stone last
year, he disclosed that this move
was a rejection of the style and
hype which had brought him
fame. It was an attempt to get
away from structured songs and
just work out with nice people. "I
don't want to be a clown
anymore," he said, suggesting that
he had burned his last guitar (you
can catch this act in Monterey
Fop).

I just can't get it on for the
direction he has chosen. He has
been playing mostly with Buddy
Miles and Billy Cox; these two
may have more "soul" than
Redding and Mitchell, but they
sure don't have as much talent. I
absolutely cannot abide Buddy
Miles' voice (in 3 songs on this
album); it is without redeeming
social value.
Hendrix is without question a
great guitar player, a fantastic

singer, and an excellent songwriter
(Crosstown Traffic is pure genius);
the best thing to do is borrow the
album from a friend, tape it, and
derail what's left of the Buddy
Miles Express whenever you hear
it comin'.
Ampex has decided to get into
the record business to protect the
position in tapes, if you can dig
that. The reasoning, and I'll only
tell you once, is that with 35
percent of the recorded music

business going to pre-recorded
tapes, vinyl makers are trying to
sneak into the acetate business.
Therefore, Ampex feels that it
needs its own stable of artists to
preserve its market dominance,
and we all know how important
that is—right?
The first addition to this stable
is no nag, but rather a fine
country trotter named Jesse
Winchester. The Band has had a
tremendous influence on this
album, but Winchester has a great
voice and adds plenty of
originality to it. Produced by
Robbie Robinson (the guitar
player of the Band), the rock is
provided by great backup with
fantastic drumming by Levon
Helm (best known for singing
"The Weight") and two other
guys. Between the drums and the
snappy piano (some of which is
played by Jesse himself), the
album really drives. The
production is smooth, and the
material is good. The vocal in
"Skip Rope Song" has an
uncanny resemblance to Tim
Buckley ("Hello/Goodbye") and
overall is very pleasant. "Snow"
has great Robinson guitar, nice
chord changes, and a great
sentiment, "And I'm here to say,
if winter comes/The spring is way
behind."
Tommy James and the
Shondells rank with Humble Pie
as the most imitative group in

existence. Their new release,
Travelin', contains a bald-faced
imitation of the descant in the
Beatles "Come Together."
"Candy Maker," the song is
called. The drumming in this same
song was borrowed from Spooky
Tooth's "Waiting in the Wind,"
and there are a bunch of chord
changes last heard on Jim Webb
material. It is a record full of
cliches and studio gimmicks.
BiH Graham must have heard
of the good reviews we've been
giving to the Family Dog, because
he's bringing in some good people.
Small Faces (whose album with
Rod Stewart will be reviewed next
week) and Poco will appear in
May, and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young will be at Winterland from
April 30 to May 3. This weekend
Joe Cocker is featured with Van
Morrison and Stonemans also on
the bill. Joe is a flashy performer
on the rarely-seen no-string guitar,
and has one of the best voices in
rock. The Dog, however, is not to
be caught sleeping; Quicksilver
will be featured this
weekend—look for me in the front
row.
Country Joe and the Fish will
appear along with Eric Burdon's
exciting new group, WAR, in
support of END Sunday
afternoon in Frost. The Fish are
always especially appropriate at a
"politically conscious" occasions.

rock. The Dog, however, is not to
be caught sleeping; Quicksilver
will be featured this
weekend—look for me in the front
row.
Country Joe and the Fish will
appear along with Eric Burdon's
exciting new group, WAR, in
support of END Sunday
afternoon in Frost. The Fish are
always especially appropriate at a
"politically conscious" occasions.
Tlie cause is good so pay
up—think what a trip to the city
and an evening with Bill Graham
costs.


COMlNG—Country Joe and the Fish head the cast for Sunday's ecology concert
at Froet.
The post-Christmas lull in rock
releases is definitely over—besides
the usual heap of obscure trash,
we actually find some new
material by name artists.
Unfortunately, not much of it is
up to expectations, but learning
to live with disappointment is
probably good training for the
future.
The best feature of Jimi
Hendrix's new album recorded
live at the Fillmore East on last
New Year's Eve is three fantastic
pictures of the funky-lookin
leftie. Hendrix can play with an
edge, yet both his voice and his
guitar can be mellow without
becoming muddled. His early
albums had the incredible
diversity of songs like "Fire,"
"Hey, Joe," "Axis, Bold as Love,"
and"The Wind Cried Mary." The
rhythm section of Noel Redding
and Mitch Mitchell were able to
be interesting in slower material
and indescribably driving in the
hot stuff. Electric Ladyland was
the last Experience album and,
though it showed some distressing
trends, it was a double set and
there were many interesting
contrasts.
The Experience split, however,
and Jimi took to touring with
various friends under the name,
Band of Gypsies. In a marathon
interview with Rolling Stone last
year, he disclosed that this move
was a rejection of the style and
hype which had brought him
fame. It was an attempt to get
away from structured songs and
just work out with nice people. "I
don't want to be a clown
anymore," he said, suggesting that
he had burned his last guitar (you
can catch this act in Monterey
Fop).

I just can't get it on for the
direction he has chosen. He has
been playing mostly with Buddy
Miles and Billy Cox; these two
may have more "soul" than
Redding and Mitchell, but they
sure don't have as much talent. I
absolutely cannot abide Buddy
Miles' voice (in 3 songs on this
album); it is without redeeming
social value.
Hendrix is without question a
great guitar player, a fantastic

singer, and an excellent songwriter
(Crosstown Traffic is pure genius);
the best thing to do is borrow the
album from a friend, tape it, and
derail what's left of the Buddy
Miles Express whenever you hear
it comin'.
Ampex has decided to get into
the record business to protect the
position in tapes, if you can dig
that. The reasoning, and I'll only
tell you once, is that with 35
percent of the recorded music

business going to pre-recorded
tapes, vinyl makers are trying to
sneak into the acetate business.
Therefore, Ampex feels that it
needs its own stable of artists to
preserve its market dominance,
and we all know how important
that is—right?
The first addition to this stable
is no nag, but rather a fine
country trotter named Jesse
Winchester. The Band has had a
tremendous influence on this
album, but Winchester has a great
voice and adds plenty of
originality to it. Produced by
Robbie Robinson (the guitar
player of the Band), the rock is
provided by great backup with
fantastic drumming by Levon
Helm (best known for singing
"The Weight") and two other
guys. Between the drums and the
snappy piano (some of which is
played by Jesse himself), the
album really drives. The
production is smooth, and the
material is good. The vocal in
"Skip Rope Song" has an
uncanny resemblance to Tim
Buckley ("Hello/Goodbye") and
overall is very pleasant. "Snow"
has great Robinson guitar, nice
chord changes, and a great
sentiment, "And I'm here to say,
if winter comes/The spring is way
behind."
Tommy James and the
Shondells rank with Humble Pie
as the most imitative group in

existence. Their new release,
Travelin', contains a bald-faced
imitation of the descant in the
Beatles "Come Together."
"Candy Maker," the song is
called. The drumming in this same
song was borrowed from Spooky
Tooth's "Waiting in the Wind,"
and there are a bunch of chord
changes last heard on Jim Webb
material. It is a record full of
cliches and studio gimmicks.
BiH Graham must have heard
of the good reviews we've been
giving to the Family Dog, because
he's bringing in some good people.
Small Faces (whose album with
Rod Stewart will be reviewed next
week) and Poco will appear in
May, and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young will be at Winterland from
April 30 to May 3. This weekend
Joe Cocker is featured with Van
Morrison and Stonemans also on
the bill. Joe is a flashy performer
on the rarely-seen no-string guitar,
and has one of the best voices in
rock. The Dog, however, is not to
be caught sleeping; Quicksilver
will be featured this
weekend—look for me in the front
row.
