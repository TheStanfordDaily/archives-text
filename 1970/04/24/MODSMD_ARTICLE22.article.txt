# Doubled Up
## West Shows Winning Way 
### Marshall Schwartz 
Some slick shuttling back and forth and careful
card placing enabled declarer to land this thin fair
spade contract, in a hand played in the Masters'
Pairs at last month's Spring Nationals in Portland.
North-South were playing weak no-trumps,
where a one no-trump opening shows 11-14
points. For 15-17 point hands, the normal strong
no-trump, you open a minor and rebid no-trump.
South responded in his five-card suit to North's
opening, but West tried to throw a monkey
wrench into the bidding with his 2NT bid-H;he
unusual no-trump, showing here the two unbid
suits. Unfortunately for him, this call led to his
side's downfall.
North doubled to show a good hand, and East
was quick to choose hearts over clubs. South,
knowing his partner had at most four hearts,
decided against defending and rebid spades. North
naturally raised to game. South regretted his three

opade bid when he saw dummy, for the opponents
would be down one in three hearts and his
contract looked very shaky. But the unusual
no-trump bid gave him a glimmer of hope.
For his vulnerable bid, West was marked with at
least ten, probably eleven cards in clubs and
hearts. Since East took a preference, he probably
had three hearts (with 2-1 or 2-2 in the suits, he
should pass after the double, letting his partner
choose). Therefore, South concluded, West had
five hearts and five or six clubs. The lead marked
the club ace with East. If he had two clubs, then
two tricks must be lost. But there was a good
chance he had only the stiff ace. Playing for this
possibility, declarer played low from dummy to
trick one and was duly rewarded when the ace
appeared to his right.
A high heart was returned, dummy's ace
winning. Now declarer knew that West had only
two cards in spades and diamonds. First he cashed
the spade king, and when all followed low, he had
a decision. Did West have another spade or a
singleton diamond. If it was another spade, he
couldn't afford to play another diamond first to
find out, for West would ruff. And if it was a
diamond, South had to double finesse the spades
at the next trick. He decided to play West for a
diamond, and led the spade nine off board. East,
not wanting to give the show away, played low,
and the nine held. Declarer now had a complete
picture of both hands.
He pulled trump in two rounds, and led a
diamond towards dummy. When West played
small, declarer knew East had both the king and
ten. He went up with the ace, and led the eight
back. East played small, and South led the card
ride, winning the trick. Another diamond was
played from dummy, and East won his king. Now
declarer's last trump and dummy's well preserved
club king and diamond queen brought the
game-going tricks, as West took the last trick with
his king of hearts.
So West, while trying to cause trouble for his
opponents, actually revealed the only way declarer
could make his contract. And South took full
advantage of it.
