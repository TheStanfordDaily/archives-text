# Earth Week Workshops
## Solution-Seeking Conclusion 
### 
Earth Week at Stanford will
culminate Saturday and Sunday
on a net of solution-seeking and
celebration.
On Saturday, the
Environmental Teach-in will offer
workshops on many of the
problem areas of environmental
crisis—air pollution, land use,
logging, pesticides, the Vietnam
War, and ecology in the public
school curricula. Workshop
panels, coordinator David Jones
said, will discuss whether
environmental repair will come
from technological innovation,
individual sacrifice, reoriented
priorities or will require massive
institutional change.
On Sunday, the Teach-in will
present a rock concert in Frost
Amphitheater featuring Country
Joe and the Fish. The 12:30
concert will also include Eric
Burdon and War, Joy of Cooking
and Tower of Power. A donation
of two dollars is requested.
Of special interest to teachers,
students and parents will be a
workshop on "Ecology and the
Public School Curricula,"
presented with the cooperation of
the School of Education. A panel
of experts will discuss the

development of an ecology
curriculum, anti-ecological
assumptions imbedded in the
present curricula, and the relation
of the classroom to current
events.
Decision -Making
Another workshop—"Land
Use: Models for Survival"—will
offer a panel discussion of the
elements of land use
decision-ma king—population
density, open space,
environmental design and the
economics of racial and ecological
balance. A second land-use
workshop—"Land Use on the
Peninsula: Present Trends and
Future Possibilities"—will discuss
the political and ecological
planning necessary for improved
land utilization on the Peninsula.
A workshop on "The
Economics and Politics of Air
Pollution" will pit representatives
of industry, the pollution control
district and citizen activists in a
debate on the causes and control
of air pollution in the Bay Area.
A workshop on logging will
offer a panel discussion between
loggers and conservationists on
the necessity and possibility of
local regulation and stricter

standards for logging in the urban
counties of the Bay Area.
The Solution?
Further workshops will deal
with the impact of pesticides such
as DDT upon human and animal
survival and with the Vietnam war
as a case study in ecological
disaster and faulty
decision-making. A workshop
designed by Conservation
Consultants in the School of
Business and the Science and
Society Symposium will discuss
whether technology can solve
environmental problems within
the framework of present business
and industrial ethics.

debate on the causes and control
of air pollution in the Bay Area.
A workshop on logging will
offer a panel discussion between
loggers and conservationists on
the necessity and possibility of
local regulation and stricter

standards for logging in the urban
counties of the Bay Area.
The Solution?
Further workshops will deal
with the impact of pesticides such
as DDT upon human and animal
survival and with the Vietnam war
as a case study in ecological
disaster and faulty
decision-making. A workshop
designed by Conservation
Consultants in the School of
Business and the Science and
Society Symposium will discuss
whether technology can solve
environmental problems within
the framework of present business
and industrial ethics.
All workshops will take place
on the Stanford Campus as

follows:
"The Economics and Politics
of Air Pollution": 9:30 a.m.,
Physics Tank. Panelists: D.J.
Callaghan, Chief Administrative
Officer, Bay Area Pollution
Control District; Mrs. Kathy Lord,

Burby, Permanente Cement;
Leonard Her/enberg, Stanford
Genetics Professor, and Ned
Groth, seminar leader in air
pollution.

School Curricula": 10 a.m.,
Education, Room Two. Panelists:
Prof. Paul Hurd, science
curriculum specialist; Prof. George
Collier, Ecology a d
Anthropology; Jim Warford, Palo

Alto High School ecology teacher;
Brian Barhaugh, student
organizer, Ecology Action; and,
Prof. Robert Bridgham, science
curriculum specialist.
"Land Use: Models for
Survival": 10 a.m., Room 460 in
the north wing of outer quad.
Panelists: Dr. and Mrs. Henry
Mayer, population and model
cities experts; Russ Levikow,

Rutherford, President,
Mid-Peninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing.
Earth Week at Stanford will
culminate Saturday and Sunday
on a net of solution-seeking and
celebration.
On Saturday, the
Environmental Teach-in will offer
workshops on many of the
problem areas of environmental
crisis—air pollution, land use,
logging, pesticides, the Vietnam
War, and ecology in the public
school curricula. Workshop
panels, coordinator David Jones
said, will discuss whether
environmental repair will come
from technological innovation,
individual sacrifice, reoriented
priorities or will require massive
institutional change.
On Sunday, the Teach-in will
present a rock concert in Frost
Amphitheater featuring Country
Joe and the Fish. The 12:30
concert will also include Eric
Burdon and War, Joy of Cooking
and Tower of Power. A donation
of two dollars is requested.
Of special interest to teachers,
students and parents will be a
workshop on "Ecology and the
Public School Curricula,"
presented with the cooperation of
the School of Education. A panel
of experts will discuss the

development of an ecology
curriculum, anti-ecological
assumptions imbedded in the
present curricula, and the relation
of the classroom to current
events.
Decision -Making
Another workshop—"Land
Use: Models for Survival"—will
offer a panel discussion of the
elements of land use
decision-ma king—population
density, open space,
environmental design and the
economics of racial and ecological
balance. A second land-use
workshop—"Land Use on the
Peninsula: Present Trends and
Future Possibilities"—will discuss
the political and ecological
planning necessary for improved
land utilization on the Peninsula.
A workshop on "The
Economics and Politics of Air
Pollution" will pit representatives
of industry, the pollution control
district and citizen activists in a
debate on the causes and control
of air pollution in the Bay Area.
