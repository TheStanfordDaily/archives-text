# Co-Op Coffee House
## The
						Full Circle 
### 
The Full Circle, a community co-op coffee
house-restaurant-delicatessen was ready to open Thursday; so it did.
The new establishment, behind the doors of the defunct Tangent on
University Avenue, represents a project worked on by 250 people
since February.
Inside, a host of not-yet paid workers prepare and serve meals,
sandwiches, expresso, and real tea from real tea leaves. A gleaming
expresso boiler toped with a gold eagle sits behind the fountain,
nearest the window. The two dining rooms are surrounded by original
paintings by Miller McDaniel, and decorated in hewn wood. Your
order for a roast beef sandwich and jasmine tea has your first name on
it, and you're called when it's ready.
The grand opening will be this Friday and Saturday at 8:30, and
will feature Sunbear and some surprise guests.
Sitting in uarkened comer, The Full Circle's manager Mark
Jenson explained that "A lot of blood, sweat and tears have gone into
this." So has $20,000. Many changes had to be made to meet
inspections, fire laws, and esthetics. Construction was performed by
volunteers and directed by skilled workers.
Goes Natural
"The delicatessen next door may be open in a few weeks," Mark
said, "We'll have our salads and sandwiches there, and maybe try to
get into natural foods, grains and others."
The Full Circle will house more than food; Midpeninsula Free
University is moving into the upstairs offices today. An upstairs room
may some time be set up for lunch meetings, and perhaps even a
cabaret will eventually be there.
Although the Palo Alto city council refused to grant the cafe a beer
license, manager Jenson commented that the"Council has been pretty
nice to us." The main problems have been getting things ready.
"We've set lots of opening dates, and we missed them all, so we just
stopped setting them. At 11:20 I got the change for the cash register,
and we opened at 11:30."
Twenty people are currently working every day, and Jenson hopes
that in a week or so there will be enough money to pay each full time
worker $75 a week.
A Veteran Advisor
The organization is reminiscent of a better-decorated Alice's
restaurant. The "advisor" of the group is Verne Gates who represents
the word of restaurant experience; Verne previously ran a restaurant
further up University. Verne mans the cash register, and is decked in a
veteran Beethovan sweatshirt.
Full Circle's menu features hot and cold sandwiches, french onion
soup, dinners (business, poor man's, and yogi), pizza, a dozen teas and
coffees, and chef's special lunch and dinner ("That's where we can
fool around with different things.").
Full Circle is open daily 10 a.m. till midnight; for the grand
opening show there will be a $1.50 admission. It is organized as a
co-op and is non-profit. It's located at 117 University, at the corner
across from the underpass to Palm Drive.
