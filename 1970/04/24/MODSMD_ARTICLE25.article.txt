# Professor Herbert Gutman
## 'Many Stable Marriages' 
### 
"The past of the Negro family has been
considered fixed, but it is actually mere
speculation," Professor Herbert Gutman of the
University of Rochester told Stanford students
Tuesday.
Speaking to about 60 students on "The Black
Family after the Civil War," Gutman criticized the
Frazier study of 1939, thereby indirectly attacking
the infamous Moynihan report which speaks of the
matriarchial tradition of the Negro family.
"Frazier's study explodes the misconception of
uniformity of behavior among Negroes," Gutman
stated, but its conclusions are extrapolated from
existing conditions, rather than based on historical
data.
According to Frazier, two streams of Negro
family life developed out of the slave experience,
one being a two-parent household, but the
dominant one being a matriarchal family.
Gutman cited data from both North and South
beginning in 1865 and up to 1905 to disprove
Frazier's conclusions.
Marriage Not Common
The slave experience blocked normal family
development for freedmen, Frazier said, so that
emancipation was a crisis in the life of the Negro,
and marriage as a legal and moral institution was
not common.
Census figures and marriage registers fo
1860-80 contradict this view, Gutman claimed,
showing that most free Negroes lived in
male-headed households. Although it varied in
different parts of the country, no less than 70
percent and in some places as many as 90 percent
of all Negro families contained a father.
Gutman pointed to the nuclear family of

mother, father, and children as the most common
among Negroes in 1880, although the augmented
family, containing additional relatives or boarders,
gained some importance later.
Prejudices
In studies emphasizing the matriarchal family,
Gutman asserts that "prejudices often clouded
perceptions," so that "what they believed had
little relation to what they saw," and their views
"were founded neither in reason nor in
experience."
Both slave experience and economic conditions
influenced the family structure developed by
Negroes after the Civil War, Gutman stated.
Although not too much study has been done on
the subject yet, Gutman added that the pattern
seemed similar to that of whites in the same
economic class, and to ethnic groups studied in
New York in 1855 and 1905.
No Complexity
Gutman also commented on the "steady
decline in occupational complexity for Negroes."
By 1905, the number of black artisans was
dropping, so that blacks were being pushed down
more into the lower class. Ethnic occupation, on
the other hand, took on more complexity with
passing time.
Continuing his comments on the family,
Gutman said, "We must reject Professor Elkins
idea of slavery as a closed system allowing masters
to re-make their slaves' lives. There were many
models of stable marriages among blacks even
during slavery."
Most of Gutman's speech was made up of
passages from a report he has prepared on the
Negro family after the Civil War.
