# PhD Problems Arise

### DICK BUXTON 
Because of a decreasing job
market for the present supply of
Ph.D's and because of decreases in
available fellowship and grant
money many departments in the
University will decrease graduate
enrollment next year, according
to the office of the dean of the
graduate division.
Lincoln E. Moses, associate
provost and dean of Graduate
Studies observed that virtually
every recipient of a Stanford
Ph.D. last year and in 1970 has or
will have obtained adequate
professional placement.
In recent years, according to
Dean Moses, employment
opportunities for doctoral
recipients have decreased,
although fields vary in how
critical the shortage of positions
is.
The United States will
continue to require many
thousands of Ph.D.'s each year,
said Moses, but the needs will be
fewer than the annual supply if
present trends continue.
According to Dean Moses it
will be necessary to determine
whether cutbacks should be made
in all institutions or just in those
with marginal Ph.D. programs
with lesser facilities.
Federal Money Down
Cutbacks in enrollment in
universities across the nation,
however, will be influenced next
year and in the years to follow by
decreases in federal government

aid. Chuck Koob, assistant to
Mosses, said that NDEA grants
(National Defense Education
Act), which go to humanities
departments, have gone down
about two-thirds over the past
four or five years at Stanford.
Grants to universities, he said,
are "down from the high mark of
federal aid." Cuts are expected in
grants to the sciences such as NSF
(National Science Foundation),
AEC (Atomic Energy
Commission), NIH (National
Institute of Health), NASA, and
others though specific figures of
decreases are not available.
Present Oversupply
According to Dean Moses, the
oversupply of Ph.D.'s in certain
fields is the product of a number
of factors, and some of the more
important causes are clear. These
include:
I—ln1 —In the last 10 years there
has been an increase of over 60
percent in the number of
universities offering Ph.D.
programs. This has been in
deliberate response to a projected
need for college teachers in the
late 1960'5. It also has been the
result of the increasing
importance that has been placed
on graduate education by faculty,
students, and funding agencies.
2—The number of doctorates
conferred each year also is
growing steadily. Last year almost
23,000 doctorates were conferred,
compared with 8,800 in 1958.
Stanford's own experience has

paralleled the national trend. The
University produced 187 Ph.D.'s
in 1958 and 503 in 1968-69.
3—'The academic community is
by far the major employer of
doctoral recipients. Over 65
percent of Ph.D.'s produced each
year is employed in teaching or
research at colleges and
universities. In some fields that
percentage is growing as
opportunities in government and
industry tighten. (Between 1958
and 1966, the percentage of
doctoral recipients in physical
sciences going to universities rose
from 39 percent to 48 percent.)
This trend can be expected to
continue as the government cuts
back research and development
programs.
4—Until very recently, the
annual production of Ph.D.'s was
less than the need for college
teachers. This trend now is
reversing itself. The current
production rate of Ph.D.'s will
result in an oversupply in the near
future. It is forecast that by 1980
there will be a supply of 350,000
science Ph. D.'sand a utilization
level of somewhere from 275,000
to 300,000. A year ago the
Modern Language Association
listed 595 college vacancies in
English; in December, 1969, there
were 387.
New Directions
Universities are being urged to
study and teach in areas of social
urgency that don't fit neatly into
the established programs. Among
these are transportation, urban
development, population control,
and racial issues.
According to Dean Moses, the
production of Ph.D.'s will have to
be brought in line quickly with
the needs of the academic
environment. Otherwise, "if the
present projections continue, we
will have serious problems," he
said.
Dean Moses expressed
confidence that "the market place
works," and a natural adjustment
is possible among institutions,
applications for graduate study,
and the job market.

level of somewhere from 275,000
to 300,000. A year ago the
Modern Language Association
listed 595 college vacancies in
English; in December, 1969, there
were 387.
New Directions
Universities are being urged to
study and teach in areas of social
urgency that don't fit neatly into
the established programs. Among
these are transportation, urban
development, population control,
and racial issues.
According to Dean Moses, the
production of Ph.D.'s will have to
be brought in line quickly with
the needs of the academic
environment. Otherwise, "if the
present projections continue, we
will have serious problems," he
said.
Dean Moses expressed
confidence that "the market place
works," and a natural adjustment
is possible among institutions,
applications for graduate study,
and the job market.
Because of a decreasing job
market for the present supply of
Ph.D's and because of decreases in
available fellowship and grant
money many departments in the
University will decrease graduate
enrollment next year, according
to the office of the dean of the
graduate division.
Lincoln E. Moses, associate
provost and dean of Graduate
Studies observed that virtually
every recipient of a Stanford
Ph.D. last year and in 1970 has or
will have obtained adequate
professional placement.
In recent years, according to
Dean Moses, employment
opportunities for doctoral
recipients have decreased,
although fields vary in how
critical the shortage of positions
is.
The United States will
continue to require many
thousands of Ph.D.'s each year,
said Moses, but the needs will be
fewer than the annual supply if
present trends continue.
According to Dean Moses it
will be necessary to determine
whether cutbacks should be made
in all institutions or just in those
with marginal Ph.D. programs
with lesser facilities.
Federal Money Down
Cutbacks in enrollment in
universities across the nation,
however, will be influenced next
year and in the years to follow by
decreases in federal government

aid. Chuck Koob, assistant to
Mosses, said that NDEA grants
(National Defense Education
Act), which go to humanities
departments, have gone down
about two-thirds over the past
four or five years at Stanford.
Grants to universities, he said,
are "down from the high mark of
federal aid." Cuts are expected in
grants to the sciences such as NSF
(National Science Foundation),
AEC (Atomic Energy
Commission), NIH (National
Institute of Health), NASA, and
others though specific figures of
decreases are not available.
Present Oversupply
According to Dean Moses, the
oversupply of Ph.D.'s in certain
fields is the product of a number
of factors, and some of the more
important causes are clear. These
include:
I—ln1 —In the last 10 years there
has been an increase of over 60
percent in the number of
universities offering Ph.D.
programs. This has been in
deliberate response to a projected
need for college teachers in the
late 1960'5. It also has been the
result of the increasing
importance that has been placed
on graduate education by faculty,
students, and funding agencies.
2—The number of doctorates
conferred each year also is
growing steadily. Last year almost
23,000 doctorates were conferred,
compared with 8,800 in 1958.
Stanford's own experience has

paralleled the national trend. The
University produced 187 Ph.D.'s
in 1958 and 503 in 1968-69.
3—'The academic community is
by far the major employer of
doctoral recipients. Over 65
percent of Ph.D.'s produced each
year is employed in teaching or
research at colleges and
universities. In some fields that
percentage is growing as
opportunities in government and
industry tighten. (Between 1958
and 1966, the percentage of
doctoral recipients in physical
sciences going to universities rose
from 39 percent to 48 percent.)
This trend can be expected to
continue as the government cuts
back research and development
programs.
4—Until very recently, the
annual production of Ph.D.'s was
less than the need for college
teachers. This trend now is
reversing itself. The current
production rate of Ph.D.'s will
result in an oversupply in the near
future. It is forecast that by 1980
there will be a supply of 350,000
science Ph. D.'sand a utilization
level of somewhere from 275,000
to 300,000. A year ago the

doctoral recipients. Over 65
percent of Ph.D.'s produced each
year is employed in teaching or
research at colleges and
universities. In some fields that
percentage is growing as
opportunities in government and
industry tighten. (Between 1958
and 1966, the percentage of
doctoral recipients in physical
sciences going to universities rose
from 39 percent to 48 percent.)
This trend can be expected to
continue as the government cuts
back research and development
programs.
4—Until very recently, the
annual production of Ph.D.'s was
less than the need for college
teachers. This trend now is
reversing itself. The current
production rate of Ph.D.'s will
result in an oversupply in the near
future. It is forecast that by 1980
there will be a supply of 350,000
science Ph. D.'sand a utilization
level of somewhere from 275,000
to 300,000. A year ago the
Modern Language Association
listed 595 college vacancies in
English; in December, 1969, there
were 387.
New Directions
Universities are being urged to
study and teach in areas of social
urgency that don't fit neatly into
the established programs. Among
these are transportation, urban
development, population control,
and racial issues.
According to Dean Moses, the
production of Ph.D.'s will have to
be brought in line quickly with
the needs of the academic
environment. Otherwise, "if the
present projections continue, we
will have serious problems," he
said.
Dean Moses expressed
confidence that "the market place
works," and a natural adjustment
is possible among institutions,
applications for graduate study,
and the job market.
