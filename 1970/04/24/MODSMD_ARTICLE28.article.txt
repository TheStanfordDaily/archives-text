# Track Finale: Huskies
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Arise all you Stanford
pseudo-intellects who have been
burying your heads in a book
every Saturday afternoon. Pull
yourself away from the world of
printed matter tomorrow and get
out and enjoy some sun and one
of the greatest shows on earth.
While you've been busy with
your Mao, Faulkner and
Off-ROTC handbook many of
you have probably missed the
spectacle and glamour of a
Stanford track meet.
The tracksters have already
performed twice in Stanford
Stadium's open air theater and
tomorrow will be their third and
final appearance of the year.
Imagine! Only one more chance
to see the 1970 edition of the
renowned Stanford track and field
team under the direction and
production of Payton Jordan, the
Ingmar Bergman of track and
field.
Payton will not be expecting
any roses on the farewell
appearance of this year's troupe,
but he sure would like a victory.
In case you usually fall asleep
before getting to the Daily sports
page, the Tribe is winless in five
dual meets this season.
Stage Fright?
Providing the opposition in
tomorrow afternoon's drama will
be the Washington Huskies. The
Huskies only brush with the
theatric this year was an early
season dramatic presentation by a
British team member who claimed
that his teammates were smoking
dope and not acting like athletes.
Well the grass has turned
greener, so to speak, and the
Huskies haven't had such a bad
season after all. Their biggest
moment of euphoria came two
weeks ago when they tied the
mighty USC Trojans 77-77. For
those of you who forgot, never
knew, or don't care, these are the
same Trojans who beat Stanford
last Saturday 96-58.
Earlier in the week the meet
seemed as if it might be very close
and be decided in the relays. But a
couple of developments have
swung the favorite's role to
Washington. The injuries which
have plagued Stanford all year are
still occurring and a couple of key
performers will be at less than full

strength. Sprinter A 1 Dyson (9.9,
21.6) has been declared out of
tomorrow's meet and his loss will
once again greatly handicap the
Indians in the sprints and 440
Relay.
Quarter-miler and long jumper
Jim Kauffman has been bothered
by a knee injury which will
require surgery in May, and
although he will compete
tomorrow he will also be below
par. Hurdler-sprinter Rick Tipton
(14.3, 9.5 ('69) and pole-vaulter
Casey Carrigan (16-0) are also
hurt, but will compete.
J oh iison Returns
The big difference in the meet
may be the ret' rn of sprinter Ben
Johnson (9.6, 21.4) to the
Washington lineup. Although he
probably won't be in the best of
shape, Johnson's presence will
give the Huskies a big boost in the
sprints and relays.
In an attempt to pick up the
all-important doubtful points in
tomorrow's meet, both Jordan
and coach Ken Shannon of
Washington are expected to do a
lot of shuffling in their entry lists.
Jordan will probably split up his
strong distance group and enter
Duncan Macdonald (1:52.4) in
the 880, Don Kardong (4:08.1) in
the mile and Greg Brock
(14:03.6) in the three mile.
In the field events, the closest
competition will probably be in
the long jump where Stanford's
Tom Anderson (23-10) will take
on the Huskie's Reed Parsley
(23-11). Otherwise the Cards will
be favored in the pole vault,

discus and triple jump; while
Washington should win the
javelin, high jump and shot put.
In the sprints Johnson will be
favored, especially since Dyson
won't run. Both hurdle races will
be close and crucial. In the lows
Stanford's Bill Griffith (14.2) and
Tipton will duel Washington's Jim
Seymour (14.2) and Mike
Fairleigh (14.4). In the
intermediate hurdles Stanford's
Randy White (52.4) and Greg
Ford (53.1) will oppose Seymour
(52.0) and Kim Hoelting (53.1).
Battle for Kardong
There should be some great
contests in the distance events. In
the 880 each team has two
runners under 1:53. In the mile
Kardong will have his work cut
out for him against the Huskies'
Bill Smart (4:03.5 and Jim
Johnson (4'07.6). The three mile
should also be quick with three
Washington runners all under
fourteen minutes. The
steeplechase will feature
Washignton's Johnson (8:51.1)
and Bill Koss (9:04.6), who rank
first and fourth in the conference
in this event.
With both teams having such
outstanding distance aces, both
Shannon and Jordan will be doing
a lot of thinking about how to
shuffle their personnel to their
best advantage. Anyway, there
will be a lot of close races and
perhaps even a close meet. The
festivities get underway tomorrow
at 1:15 with the first running
event at 1:45.
