# The 						Distance Men Lead Card Spikers
## 
### FRED LEESON 
It hasn't been, come to think
of it, a stellar year for Stanford
track. The Indians have yet to win
a dual meet, and perhaps they
won't.
"The effect of a season like
this one hurts a team," says
distance runner Greg Brock. "I
feel it's just because everybody's
better—we're in a tough
conference—but you just can't
keep getting beaten without
wondering about yourself."
But nobody's really wondering
about Stanford distance runners,
who have been the team's most
consistent point-getters all season.
The mainstays, with help from
Brook Thomas and Chuck Menz,
have been Brock, Don Kardong
and Duncan Macdonald.
"We may have a chance against
Washington, although a small
one," Kardong says, looking to
Saturday's home finale against the
Huskies.
"This is the only team besides
Oregon that could out-score us in
the distances," Brock added.
But then, they'll tell you,
running the actual races isn't
really the most enjoyable part of
distance running, except for the
thrill of surging past another
runner, which has been common
for all three this season.
"Workouts are more fun than
races," Kardong claims. "There's a
real joy in running in the morning
and being able to do something
tops. It's a real genuine thing you
get out of it. It's hard to say what
it is—maybe discipline—but
discipline is a mis-used word
nowadatys."
"When somebody says you get
discipline from athletics it can
mean many different things."
Also, he adds, "You also learn
what is irrelevant to it," referring
to a number of externals.
Macdonald, who has run the
mile most of the season but who
will be pushed up to the 880
tomorrow, was less serious about
why he runs. "I do it for the
money, girls and prestige. It's
great sublimation."

A junior, his immediate
; aspirations are a four minute mile
I and a 1:50 half. His best time so
i far has been 4:06.6. "My chances
' are good," he says of the four
minute effort, "If I don't get hurt.
: I don't know if it will be this year
> or next."
[ His favorite distance?
3 "When I'm running the mile, I
l like the half, and when I run the
t half, I like the mile." Concerning
t the arduous hours of practice
common to distance men, Duncan
* says, "I'm building up slowly to a
, typical workout." Laughter.
Though he graduates this year,
• "I'll keep running a couple more
1 years," Brock says. "I'd definitely
» like to go to the Olympics, but
I competition will be pretty stiff.
That's a pretty long shot. But the
t value is in striving to make it, not
1 just making it."
> The three mile is presently his
- favorite distance, but he says, "I'll
probably have to adjust for the
5 six, though, since I lack speed for
1 the shorter distances."
He isn't new to the six,
I exactly ... he placed ninth in the
112 NCAA cross country finals this
5 year, which is a six mile effort.
112 Kardong will drop down to the
! mile tomorrow, and Brock will go
in the three as Coach Payton
! Jordon will need all the points he
t can get in the distances. In the
j season's first meet, those two
i finished a dead-heat two mile in a
i record Stanford time of 8:45.2.
t Kardong has been under the
t old two mile record four times so
J far, and his fastest mile has been
4:08.1.
t The season climax will come
i against Oregon's excellent
freshman runner Steve
i Prefontaine, who has had a two
? mile time under 8:40. Last week,
in wind and rain and saving
i himself for a double in the mile he
) clocked an 8:46.
) "I guess I'll get him," Kardong
t said with a grin. "I'll be there,
; too," Brock added." An 8:46
s might just be a trial time for
him . . . that's what's scary."

But nobody's really wondering
about Stanford distance runners,
who have been the team's most
consistent point-getters all season.
The mainstays, with help from
Brook Thomas and Chuck Menz,
have been Brock, Don Kardong
and Duncan Macdonald.
"We may have a chance against
Washington, although a small
one," Kardong says, looking to
Saturday's home finale against the
Huskies.
"This is the only team besides
Oregon that could out-score us in
the distances," Brock added.
But then, they'll tell you,
running the actual races isn't
really the most enjoyable part of
distance running, except for the
thrill of surging past another
runner, which has been common
for all three this season.
"Workouts are more fun than
races," Kardong claims. "There's a
real joy in running in the morning
and being able to do something
tops. It's a real genuine thing you
get out of it. It's hard to say what
it is—maybe discipline—but
discipline is a mis-used word
nowadatys."
"When somebody says you get
discipline from athletics it can
mean many different things."
Also, he adds, "You also learn
what is irrelevant to it," referring
to a number of externals.
Macdonald, who has run the
mile most of the season but who
will be pushed up to the 880
tomorrow, was less serious about
why he runs. "I do it for the
money, girls and prestige. It's
great sublimation."

A junior, his immediate
; aspirations are a four minute mile
I and a 1:50 half. His best time so
i far has been 4:06.6. "My chances
