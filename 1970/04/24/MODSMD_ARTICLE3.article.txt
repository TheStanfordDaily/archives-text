# Minor Damage
## Firebombs Hit 'Free Market' 
### 
The Free Market, headquarters
of the Free Campus Movement
(FCM), was the victim last night
of a fire bomb attack.
Three Molotov cocktails, made
of kerosene and brandy bottles,
were thrown at the small building
at 547 Lane B, about 9:15 p.m.
Part of one wall of the building
was scorched and another stained
with kerosene. The third bomb
failed to go off and was recovered
by firemen.
About 20 members of the
libertarian organization were
meeting in the building at the
time.
Police arriving on the scene had
no immediate clue as to the
identity of the bombers.
Harvey Hukari, Jr., leader of
the FCM, declined to give a
statement to the DAILY. He did
request that the DAILY not
mention FCM members present
by name since it "could be
dangerous."
KZSU received a bomb threat
at 11:45 p.m. last night. The
studio in the basement of
Memorial Auditorium was
evacuated, but the student station
switched to a remote unit and
thus was able to stay on the air.


FCM-Members the Fret- Campus Movement were in evidence throughout the day. Here they are rfiown as they blocked
the entranee to the Old Union. Several members reported minor injuries and one Nikon camera was reported smashed.
Later on last night the Free Market, FCM meeting place was fire-bombed, but little damage resulted.
