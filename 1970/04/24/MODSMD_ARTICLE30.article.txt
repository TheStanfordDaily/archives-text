# Operation Bootstrap In LA Rematch
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
One of the more crucial
weekends of the 1970 Pacific-8
baseball race begins today in Los
Angeles.
Stanford and Cal travel south
for a series of games with USC
and UCLA. The Indians will face
the Trojans today and UCLA in a
doubleheader tomorrow. For both
the Bruins and Stanford, currently
tied for last place in the Pac-B's
southern division, a winning
weekend is a must.
The Indians, who rode a
17-strikeout spree by Steve
Dunning to victory over USC here
last Saturday, had the tables
turned on them Tuesday night at
Santa Clara.
Bronco sophomore Rich
Troedson, who lost a 1-0 decision
to the Indians on Feb. 27, came
back to fan 16 Stanford batters as
Santa Clara defeated the Cards,
3-0.

Aside from tournament
competition, it was the only
scheduled night game for coach
Ray Young's aggregation, and it
saw both teams hampered by less
than ideal lighting conditions and
frigid temperatures.
Stanford collected no runs,
two hits and 3.5 cases of frostbite.
Viewing the game as a (pardon
the expression) warm up for this
weekend's Los Angeles action
against USC and UCLA, Young
and his staff were buoyed
considerably by some fine
pitching performances.
Soph Bob Kammeyer started
and relinquished only one earned
run over five innings. Then Jim
Coate, the lefthander who's
effective presence will be vital to
any Indian hopes for a pennant,
came in for a couple of scoreless
frames.
Bruce Schoen, the junior who
went 12 innings last Friday

against UCLA, pitched the ninth
and overcame slight stiffness to
strike out the side.
Pleasedwith the performance of
his mound corps, Young says he
plans to go with Dunning Friday
at USC, then Coate or Schoen in
the first game against UCLA
Saturday. Phil Keller will hurl the
nine-inning nightcap.
In varsity statistics released

before the Santa Clara game, Mike
Ewing leads all regulars with a
.288 batting average, with
Dunning right behind at .283.
Dunning also leads in homers (6),
hits (34), triples (5), and runs
batted in (32).
On the mound, the powerful
junior leads the team with ten
wins, 111 strikeouts and a 1.27
earned-run-average.

moved into coach Ray Young's starting lineup with a healthy batting average and good range in the infield. Stanford plays UCLA again tomorrow, in a
doubleheader in Los Angeles after a single contest at USC this afternoon.
