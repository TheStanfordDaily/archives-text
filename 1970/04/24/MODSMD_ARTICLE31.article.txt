# Stanford Sea Scene
## 
### 
The varsity crew heads for San
Diego today for two big races
there this weekend. Coming off a
loss last weekend to Washington
by ten seconds, coach Will
Condon has done some realigning
in the varsity and JV shells. John
Raines has been moved from JV
stroke to that position on the
varsity.
Stanford will race UCLA and
USC in the Harbach Cup this
afternoon, then compete with
seven other schools at the
Newport Regatta tomorrow.
In SAILING, Stanford finished
a disappointing sixth at the
Kennedy Cup Regatta, held last
weekend in Annapolis, Md.
Tulane won the event.

On the SURFING scene, the
Tribe, hampered by small waves
and strong onshore winds, was
beaten by Santa Clara for the
Northern California Collegiate
Surfing Championship at Four
Mile Beach, near Santa Cruz, last
weekend.
â€¢Tom Martinez earned top
points for the Cards with a 144
point effort. The Stanford Surf
Club will meet the Broncos again
next month, along with surfers
from UC Santa Cruz, in the
second annual Northern California
Tri-invitational Tournament, an
end of season event between the
top three teams in the league.
Stanford won last year.
