# Pitzer Attacks Demonstration
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
"Disciplinary actions" should be applied at a later date to
individuals "on both sides" of today's sit-in, President Kenneth Pitzer
told the faculty Senate yesterday.
Individual actions—blocking doors, fighting, and stopping
photographers from taking pictures were "improper" although the
main body of the demonstrators didn't cross the line to being a
disruption—until last night—Pitzer said.
He said that there would be proceedings against "both sides"
evidently referring to the demonstrators disturbing photographers,
and to a group of counter-protestors who blocked the entrance to the
Old Union.
The main body of the demonstrators, Pitzer said, "seems to be just
on the borderline of harrassmentand intimidation."
He said that at the time of the Senate's afternoon meeting most of
the offices in the Union were open and the group hadn't crossed the
line to being a disruption. However, he added that it would not be
acceptable to let the building be occupied overnight.
Disruption Criteria
A memorandum to the staff of University offices delivered
yesterday listed four situations that spelled out what would be
considered a disruption of a building. Pitzer said that those guidelines
were developed with the knowledge that there were intentions to keep
the Old Union sit-in non-disruptive.
The last of these, declaring that: "Unauthorized entry into any area
of the building nor ordinarily open to the public for the conduct of
business," was later to declare the building closed.
Pitzer said that to let the demonstrators stay in the building after
closing hours would be a disruption because extra personnel would be
required to protect the confidential records located in the Old Union.
These records must be secure and to hire the substantial protective
personnel that would be required, would be a disruption of normal
University functions.
Contempt of Process
Regardless of the tactics that were used by the protestors, Pitzer
said, "they do constitute ... a contempt of the decision making
process," which included student input.
In answering the questions of the faculty, Pitzer said that there has
been no specific progress with respect to the punitive clause in ROTC
contracts with Stanford. However, the clause is being more actively
discussed between the Army and other universities at this time. He
said that he had communicated earlier in the week about those
negotiations.
Pitzer added, he would be ready to contact the Army more
explicitly regarding what Stanford wants done about the punitive
clause depending on what the President's committee on ROTC
recommends.
