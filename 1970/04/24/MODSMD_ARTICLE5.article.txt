## Student Deferments May Go 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon asked Congress for
authority to abolish future
student deferments yesterday.
The President eliminated
occupational and fatherhood
deferments as of next Thursday,
and urged an eventual end to the
draft itself.
Nixon issued an executive order
permitting men who now hold or
have applied for occupational,
agricultural or fatherhood
deferments to keep or obtain
them. But the order bars the
granting of such deferments in the
future to men who were not
qualified for them before
yesterday.
The President also sent a

message to Congress, seeking
authority to impose a similar ban,
under similar conditions, on
deferments for students above the
high school level.
The message strongly endorsed
the unanimous conclusion of a
commission headed by former
Secretary of Defense Thomas S.
Gates favoring a transition to an
all-volunteer army.
But also said that the draft
"cannot be ended all at once" and
that it would probably be
necessary for Congress to extend
authority for the draft beyond the
present expiration date of July 1,
1971. A spokesman said an
extension of at least two years
would be needed.
Chairman L. Mendel Rivers,
D-S.C., said he does not plan to
have his House Armed Services
Committee consider any draft
legislation this year.

Police used tear gas to break up
mobs of rampaging students on
the Indiana State University
campus last night as fighting
erupted between Negro and white
students.
Police estimated 500 persons
were involved in the disorders that
left windows shattered in several
dormitories and cars. They said
several persons were taken to the
university infirmary with injuries
and there were arrests. Some
youths reportedly carried tire
irons and chains, while others

used towel rack bars to break
windows.
The outbreak subsided as a
heavy rain poured on the campus.

WASHINGTON (AP) - South
Vietnam has secretly delivered
about 1,500 automatic rifles to
Cambodia in an apparent move to
buy time for President Nixon's
delayed decision on Cambodia's
request for U.S. military
assistance.
The action was announced by

the White House and State
Department Thursday only after a
report published by the New York
Times disclosed an assurance had
been given to the government of
Cambodia last Friday that it
would receive a supply of
captured Soviet-designed AD47
rifles.
Indications were that the
United States instigated the South
Vietnamese delivery of the Soviet
AD47's to avoid taking direct
action itself pending

to deal with the dilemma

been given to the government of
Cambodia last Friday that it

captured Soviet-designed AD47
rifles.

Vietnamese delivery of the Soviet

determination by Nixon of how
to deal with the dilemma
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon asked Congress for
authority to abolish future
student deferments yesterday.
The President eliminated
occupational and fatherhood
deferments as of next Thursday,
and urged an eventual end to the
draft itself.
Nixon issued an executive order
permitting men who now hold or
have applied for occupational,
agricultural or fatherhood
deferments to keep or obtain
them. But the order bars the
granting of such deferments in the
future to men who were not
qualified for them before
yesterday.
The President also sent a

message to Congress, seeking
authority to impose a similar ban,
under similar conditions, on
deferments for students above the
high school level.
The message strongly endorsed
the unanimous conclusion of a
commission headed by former
Secretary of Defense Thomas S.
Gates favoring a transition to an
all-volunteer army.
But also said that the draft
"cannot be ended all at once" and
that it would probably be
necessary for Congress to extend
authority for the draft beyond the
present expiration date of July 1,
1971. A spokesman said an
extension of at least two years
would be needed.
Chairman L. Mendel Rivers,
D-S.C., said he does not plan to
have his House Armed Services
Committee consider any draft
legislation this year.
Indiana U. Clash
TERRA HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -
Police used tear gas to break up
mobs of rampaging students on
the Indiana State University
campus last night as fighting
erupted between Negro and white
students.
Police estimated 500 persons
were involved in the disorders that
left windows shattered in several
dormitories and cars. They said
several persons were taken to the
university infirmary with injuries
and there were arrests. Some
youths reportedly carried tire
irons and chains, while others

used towel rack bars to break
windows.
The outbreak subsided as a
heavy rain poured on the campus.
S. Vietnam Rifles
WASHINGTON (AP) - South
Vietnam has secretly delivered
about 1,500 automatic rifles to
Cambodia in an apparent move to
buy time for President Nixon's
delayed decision on Cambodia's
request for U.S. military
assistance.
The action was announced by

the White House and State
Department Thursday only after a
report published by the New York
Times disclosed an assurance had
been given to the government of
Cambodia last Friday that it
would receive a supply of
captured Soviet-designed AD47
rifles.
