# Pitzer Discusses Speech Dept. Cuts
## 
### 
President Kenneth Pitzer last
night told the student Senate
what he felt were the proper
means for students to protest the
de facto elimination of the Speech
department. He didn't include the
student referendum.
The two methods he suggested
in response to a question by
Frank Philpot were talking to the
students on the budget
adjustment committee or to a
dean in the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences division.
One of the questions on
yesterday's ballot urged the
University to reconsider its speech
department cutbacks.
Pitzer was appearing before the
Senate in his monthly question
,and answer session. Also present
were faculty Senate Chairman
William Clebsch, and steering
committee members J. Merrill
Carlsmith and G.L. Bach.
Prof. Clebsch explained the
faculty's ROTC decision this way:
"For academic credit, the faculty
is the primary grantor of credit,
the students are the primary
grantee. We have been faced with
a question in recent times not of
whom will get credit, but whom
shall be denied credit. The right of
ROTC as a department to grant
credit was categorically denied in
the February 1970 decisions."
He further explained that
departments have a general right

to grant credit for courses, but
that ROTC does not.
He said that last year's decision
was still in effect for Navy and Air
Force ROTC: they are being
phased out by not allowing
subsequent classes to take courses
for credit.
Pitzer speculated that students
would not make gains in certain
areas he considered primarily to
be of faculty responsibility:
appointments and tenure. He
claimed, though, that he has at
times returned requests for
tenured appointments asking
further clarification of the
individual's teaching ability.
Prof. Carlsmith disagreed
saying that "numerous"
departments are already getting
student input on tenure decisions.
Under questioning from Paul
Witt, President Pitzer sharply
defended his opposition to violent
tactics and the War: "Having had
different positions on this
question during my life, I don't
think I can say we can safely
abandon all military activity." On
his opposition to the war in
Vietnam: "I tend to design my
procedures and methods in the
best way of getting a result—not
necessarily getting publicity."
The Senate by a unanimous
vote ratified the election results
from both this week's and last
week's ballots.

Prof. Clebsch explained the
faculty's ROTC decision this way:
"For academic credit, the faculty
is the primary grantor of credit,
the students are the primary
grantee. We have been faced with
a question in recent times not of
whom will get credit, but whom
shall be denied credit. The right of
ROTC as a department to grant
credit was categorically denied in
the February 1970 decisions."
He further explained that
departments have a general right

to grant credit for courses, but
that ROTC does not.
He said that last year's decision
was still in effect for Navy and Air
Force ROTC: they are being
phased out by not allowing
subsequent classes to take courses
for credit.
Pitzer speculated that students
would not make gains in certain
areas he considered primarily to
be of faculty responsibility:
appointments and tenure. He
claimed, though, that he has at
times returned requests for
tenured appointments asking
further clarification of the
individual's teaching ability.
Prof. Carlsmith disagreed
saying that "numerous"
departments are already getting
student input on tenure decisions.
Under questioning from Paul
Witt, President Pitzer sharply
defended his opposition to violent
tactics and the War: "Having had
different positions on this
question during my life, I don't
think I can say we can safely
abandon all military activity." On
his opposition to the war in
Vietnam: "I tend to design my
procedures and methods in the
best way of getting a result—not
necessarily getting publicity."
The Senate by a unanimous
vote ratified the election results
from both this week's and last
week's ballots.
