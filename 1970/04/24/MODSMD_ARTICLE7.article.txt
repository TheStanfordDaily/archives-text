### 
A noon rally at the Stanford i
Linear Accelerator to protest
the firing of a black employee
will be held today. The United 1
Stanford Employees are i
sponsoring the case of Anne
McCombs, who was fired from '
her job as a scanner for <
"excessive absenteeism." (
The case led to the first .
(froup protest in SLAC's '
history when two-thirds of the {
scanners called in sick, partially j
shutting down operations.
