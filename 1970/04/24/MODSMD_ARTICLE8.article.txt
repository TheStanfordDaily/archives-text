# Old Union Sit-In
## 
### 
Last night police invaded the Old Union.
On Wednesday the Daily editorialized against
an anti-ROTC sit-in at this time, and called on
faculty and administrators to recognize that new
information and new student sentiments justified a
re-consideration of their ROTC arrangements.
Today we must grapple with the occupation of
the Old Union, and the fact that the Faculty
Senate, meeting yesterday, ignored the clouds that
shroud their ROTC decision in doubt. And finally,
we must grapple with the unprecedented use of
police on campus in an unannounced sweep
destined to capture, not disperse protestors.
Following on the heels of a history of "things
that shouldn't have been,"the sit-in was extremely
difficult to evaluate. On moral grounds it was
justifiable. For those of us who feel ROTC is an
integral part of an immoral American military
machine, revolt against the present
accommodation to ROTC seems a courageous way
to follow one's conscience.
Cries of our disregard for democratic
decision-making processes ring hollow, when we
know those cries refer to a decision-making
process filled with false premises. Wednesday we
pointed out that the faculty ROTC vote had been
based on two tenets-1) the Stanford
administration had gotten the best deal it could in
relation tothe decision last spring to eliminate
ROTC credit, and 2) the students, as polled last
spring, supported credit tor ROTC. We also
pointed out that student opinion has changed
markedly, and grave doubts exist over whether the
present arrangements come close to the original
goal.
President Nixon's recommendation to eliminate
future student deferments adds a new immediacy
to the ROTC question, for next year, the best
guarantee by which non-deferred students may
remain in school may be an ROTC contract. What
is supposed to be a dying ROTC may be reborn.
In addition, the format of the sit-in was
justifiable. It was designed to be non-violent, and
to offer a maximum communication and
education for those who dropped by. The
atmosphere stood in sharp contrast to the first
ugly moments when right-wing vigilantes clashed
with protestors who would rather face a fight than
circle to an open side entrance.
The University decision-making process has

been perverted and the only means available for
relatively swift redress is through direct action.
Our only question is whether this action can
succeed, and it is our pessimism that restrains us
from wholeheartedly supporting yesterday's sit-in.
Arrest is no small price to pay for futility.
Whjle the value of a sit-in is questionable; the
way police were used against it was extremely
unwise.
The tragedy of the police sweep was the naive
ineptness of the University administration rather
than its calculated malevolence. To be sure, the
University was eager to clear the building and
punish the demonstrators, but they took a
calculated risk and lost when they called on the
police to help. Administrators wanted to use the
police lightly, but the cops were tired of dealing
carefully with radicals they have battled since late
March. As a result, the police moved to trap, not
scatter demonstrators.
We might be willing to encourage a rejection of
the sit-in if we had faith in those who will set the
temporary status of ROTC next year and its
permanent place in years to come. However,
neither administrators or faculty have made more
than veiled references to plans to cut credit or
eliminate the activity from campus. We learned as
last year's no credit decision was compromised
that inferences are not good enough.
Police on campus cannot answer the challenges
the Off-ROTC movement will continue to raise at
Stanford. The only resolution of the conflict lies
in reasoned examination of the problems and
decisions of both sides which led to this collision
course.
Wednesday we called for three steps to avoid a
show-down. Today we call for those same three
steps to de-fuse an explosive situation: first, the
Faculty Senate, in light of new information, must
reconsider its ROTC arrangements; second, the
administration must promise that if the punitive
clause is not eliminated from ROTC contracts, it
will recommend that officers' training programs be
eliminated; third, the administration and faculty
must call a two-day moratorium on classes for
discussion with students.
Now is not the time for righteous statements of
deep concern but instead resolve to confront the
issue directly.

March. As a result, the police moved to trap, not
scatter demonstrators.
We might be willing to encourage a rejection of
the sit-in if we had faith in those who will set the
temporary status of ROTC next year and its
permanent place in years to come. However,
neither administrators or faculty have made more
than veiled references to plans to cut credit or
eliminate the activity from campus. We learned as
last year's no credit decision was compromised
that inferences are not good enough.
Police on campus cannot answer the challenges
the Off-ROTC movement will continue to raise at
Stanford. The only resolution of the conflict lies
in reasoned examination of the problems and
decisions of both sides which led to this collision
course.
Wednesday we called for three steps to avoid a
show-down. Today we call for those same three
steps to de-fuse an explosive situation: first, the
Faculty Senate, in light of new information, must
reconsider its ROTC arrangements; second, the
administration must promise that if the punitive
clause is not eliminated from ROTC contracts, it
will recommend that officers' training programs be
eliminated; third, the administration and faculty
must call a two-day moratorium on classes for
discussion with students.
Now is not the time for righteous statements of
deep concern but instead resolve to confront the
issue directly.
Last night police invaded the Old Union.
On Wednesday the Daily editorialized against
an anti-ROTC sit-in at this time, and called on
faculty and administrators to recognize that new
information and new student sentiments justified a
re-consideration of their ROTC arrangements.
Today we must grapple with the occupation of
the Old Union, and the fact that the Faculty
Senate, meeting yesterday, ignored the clouds that
shroud their ROTC decision in doubt. And finally,
we must grapple with the unprecedented use of
police on campus in an unannounced sweep
destined to capture, not disperse protestors.
Following on the heels of a history of "things
that shouldn't have been,"the sit-in was extremely
difficult to evaluate. On moral grounds it was
justifiable. For those of us who feel ROTC is an
integral part of an immoral American military
machine, revolt against the present
accommodation to ROTC seems a courageous way
to follow one's conscience.
Cries of our disregard for democratic
decision-making processes ring hollow, when we
know those cries refer to a decision-making
process filled with false premises. Wednesday we
pointed out that the faculty ROTC vote had been
based on two tenets-1) the Stanford
administration had gotten the best deal it could in
relation tothe decision last spring to eliminate
ROTC credit, and 2) the students, as polled last
spring, supported credit tor ROTC. We also
pointed out that student opinion has changed
markedly, and grave doubts exist over whether the
present arrangements come close to the original
goal.
President Nixon's recommendation to eliminate
future student deferments adds a new immediacy
to the ROTC question, for next year, the best
guarantee by which non-deferred students may
remain in school may be an ROTC contract. What
is supposed to be a dying ROTC may be reborn.
In addition, the format of the sit-in was
justifiable. It was designed to be non-violent, and
to offer a maximum communication and
education for those who dropped by. The
atmosphere stood in sharp contrast to the first
ugly moments when right-wing vigilantes clashed
with protestors who would rather face a fight than
circle to an open side entrance.
The University decision-making process has

been perverted and the only means available for
relatively swift redress is through direct action.
Our only question is whether this action can
succeed, and it is our pessimism that restrains us
from wholeheartedly supporting yesterday's sit-in.
Arrest is no small price to pay for futility.
Whjle the value of a sit-in is questionable; the
way police were used against it was extremely
unwise.
The tragedy of the police sweep was the naive
ineptness of the University administration rather
than its calculated malevolence. To be sure, the
University was eager to clear the building and
punish the demonstrators, but they took a
calculated risk and lost when they called on the
police to help. Administrators wanted to use the
police lightly, but the cops were tired of dealing
carefully with radicals they have battled since late
March. As a result, the police moved to trap, not
scatter demonstrators.
