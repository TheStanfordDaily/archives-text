# Swift Hacks Off
## Story Behind Arena's Kidnap 
### Argo 
I am Argo; I am therefore a
confessed Arena baiter. The
parody Arena was the brain child
of David Swift, student financial
manager, who has been heartily
stung by the barbs of Harvey
Hukari's brain child.
David Swift disappeared
Tuesday with nearly the entire
first press run of the parody, and
therein lies the mystery. I Argo
have no answer except that there
is probably no real conclusion to
this tale.
Swift was to have met Yale
Braunstein at 8:00 a.m. Tuesday
to distribute the Arena's stashed
in his trunk. He never showed.
Braunstein immediately feared a
kidnapping. By the end of the day
he had changed his mind: if Swift
didn't appear with the Arena's in
24 hours we would swear out a
complaint for grand larceny.
Swift did show within the
perscribed hours: he had been
kidnapped he said and the
lampoons stolen from his car.
Motel Hideout
In the meanwhile, rumors
circulated: Swift had been hiding,
probably in a motel, in whose
closets he had secreted the Arena.
Why should the originator of
the idea suddenly destroy his
child, born of someone else's hard
work and money? Simply because
he had wanted an obvious parody,
satirizing the Arena's journalism
and "extremist" politics.
Unfortunately the bogus Arena
was too realistic: few readers
realized quickly that it was a
phony.
I Argo say unfortunately
because we goofed: we had done
our job to well, turning out
pablum so authentic that the
average student, unsophisticated
about right-wing Stanford politics,
couldn't rapidly distinguish
between authentic and ersatz.

The satire was there and once
people realized it was a parody
the amusement was general.
Supporters of the Pat C. Shea
ticket claim that the satire was
too subtle and that the editorial
advocating write-in votes for
Hukari-Rael was a thoroughly
illegal and immoral (Hukari voters
are much more likely to vote Shea
than Shoch) move.
I Argo do swear and aver
however that anyone who takes
that editorial seriously was
mistakenly admitted to Stanford:
any student who believes that an
edit which closes with an
endorsement for the GM
referendum "to support the move
to bring General Motors into the
18th century of Adam Smith,
where we of the Arena already
are," is sadly naive.
Who can believe that any
Stanford student who has read the
Arena more than once that it
would carry a cartoon opposing
ROTC and American intervention
in S.E. Asia?
Possible Misreading
Shea- Grant- Levin- Mickelson
people apparantly are convinced
that certain of their potential
voters could misread the parody.
Personally I think it shows you
what they think of their
supporters.
Certain members of the Free
Campus Movement were
obviously embarrassed by the
parody, and for good reasons.
Articles critical of right wing
Stanford politics and political
organizations can be extremely
rubbing to an active dedicated
minority group.
At this point I Argo am
confused and for me the mystery
begins. One person and two
groups logically have motives for
stopping publication of a

counterfeit Arena. But the facts I
know and reasonable suspicions I
have do not allow me to infer
anything else. What happened to
the first press run is a mystery to
me. The only thing I do know is
that this University should
conduct an inquiry into the
situation. A student has stated
that he was kidnapped; a critical
and humorous publication was
initially surpressed. Both of those
acts indicate a supression of
freedom of speech. Is there
anything we here hold more
sacred?
(Argo is roughly what he
appears to be.)
