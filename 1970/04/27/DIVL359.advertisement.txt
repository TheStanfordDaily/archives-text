Mark Twain's
The WAR PRAYER
To Pan Beard, iuHo dropped in to see him,
Clemens read the "War Prayer,"stating that
he had read it to his daughter Jean,
and others, who had told him he must not
print it, for it would be regarded as sacrilege.
"Still, you are going to publish it,are you not?"
Clemens, pacing up and down the room
in his dressing-gown and slippers,
shook his head.
"No," he said, "I have told the whole truth
in that, and only dead men can tell the truth
in this world.
"It can be published after I am dead."
