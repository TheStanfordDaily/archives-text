# Behavioral Sciences Fire
## 75 Years' Work Destroyed 
### ED KOHN 
In an apparent act of arson,
more than 75 years of
irreplaceable research were
destroyed Friday in an early
morning fire at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences.
Several scholars searched
through the wreckage of their
offices and left the scene in tears.
Others worked throughout the
day to save smoke-and
water-damaged files and papers.
The fire completely destroyed
ten offices and left most of the
others in the complex damaged by
smoke and water. Center officials
estimated damages to the wooden
building at between $50,000 and
$100,000.
Flames destroyed manuscripts,
papers and books that were the
products of some of the world's
leading scholars. The exact loss to
each of the scientists could not
immediately be determined.
Three Fires
Fire department officials
reported that arsonists attempted
to set fires in four locations. They
succeeded in demolishing two
opposite wings of the building
about 50 yards apart. Two
firebombs thrown into the
administrative section of the
complex failed to ignite.
In addition, a motorcycle that
belonged to one of the student
caretakers living near the center
was set afire in the middle of the
access road leading to the
building. Some brush near the
flaming motorcycle was also set
afire.
The center was established in
1956 with Ford Foundation
grant. Located in the foothills
near the golf course, it has no
direct connection with the
University other than the fact that
it was built on Stanford land. The
center is supported entirely
through private donations. The
complex had not been the target
of previous attacks.
No Direct ROTC Link
The center attracts about 50 of
the world's leading scholars each
year for long periods of study and
research on different aspects of
human behavior. Work destroyed
Friday included studies in deviant
behavior, moral philosophy,
psychology, student unrest and
welfare economics.
Police and fire department
officials found no direct
connection between the
continuing ROTC demonstrations
and the dawn fire. However, they
did not discount such a link. A
Santa Clara deputy fire marshall
said yesterday that an
investigation was continuing into
blaze.
Police discontinued their search
for four men on two motorcycles,
saying that such efforts were
irrelevant to the case. "Nothing
has really turned up," Paul
Andrade, a deputy fire marshall,
said. He said that tests might be
run today on some evidence
found at the scene.
Life's Work Destroyed
Prof. M.N. Srinivas - considered
to be India's leading social
scientist - suffered the greatest
loss. He had spent 22 years
studying the casts system in South
India, and had obtained a year's
leave from the University of New
Delhi to complete his work.
"His entire life's work has been
destroyed," said University of
Chicago anthropologist Sol Tax,
who also lost part of his study on
the American Indian.
"His collection of original notes
has been burned. What is lost is
the irreplaceable product of a
great scientist from India where
his science is sorely needed.
Senseless Destruction
"It was a senseless act of
destruction. What it does to a
human being is one thing; what it
does to a society to destroy this

product of learning, to the people
of India, is another," Tax said.
Srinivas, whose mother died
last week, left the smouldering
wreckage of his office in tears.
He said that his study of the
caste system "is of fundamental
interest to all sociologists."
Center's Value
"...This is my field study:
more and more I feel that I should
finish the study of the village. Of
course the center has been
magnificent to me. People outside
don't know how people can be
harassed. Without an institution
like that I don't think that there
will be development in the
behavioral sciences.
"We should try to understand
human beings more and more. If
they do not have places they can
go to and do some thinking, I
don't see any reason to continue.
"... People interested in
human society would be
interested in the kind of work I
was doing. We pay too much
attention to technology and too
little to human behavior. Those
people who want to change
society can't be estimated at all in
monetary terms," he said.
Vicious, Immoral Act
O. Meridith Wilson, president
of the University of Michigan
from 1960-67 and director of the
center, said, "What was burned
was a life. An entire life, totally
destroyed by people bent on
blind, mindless destruction. This
man has done nothing but good to
anyone and now he is ruined
because of a childish tantrum."
Prof. John Bunzel, chairman of
the department of political
science at San Francisco State,
also suffered a total loss. Last
year, Bunzel was subject to
constant harassment by radicals,
including a bomb threat, a threat
on his life, and tire slashings.
Bunzel diescribed the fire as "a
vicious act, an immoral act,
deserving nothing but the greatest
contempt . . . perpetrated by
people who have no apprecation
of the fundamental values of
western civilization "
Tragic Irony
"I wanted this year of research
and tranquility in these beautiful
surroundings," he said. "I think
that it is a tragic irony that such a
place as a behavioral center, which
is a symbol of the most cherished
values, stability and scholarship

combined, should be chosen as a
target for attack."
Howard S. Becker, a
Northwestern University
sociologist, also suffered what
officials termed a "total loss." He
was completing books and articles
on the effects of environment on
education, training and
socialization, as well as the effects

of drugs on the social structure.
Other scholars who suffered a
loss of works include: Richard B.
Brandt, philosophy, University of
Michigan; Steven Dedijer, docent
in sociology, University of
London; Prof, and Mrs. Howard
Kendler, psychologists at
University of California, Santa
Barbara: Edmuno S. Phelps.

SMOULDERING WRECKAGEâ€”This was the scene at the Outer lor Advanced Study ot the Behavioral Sciences alter two wings were gutted in a firebombing early
Friday morning. Seventy-five years worth of irreplaceable research were destroyed in the blaze which also caused $50,000 to $100,000 worth ol damage to the
building itself.
In an apparent act of arson,
more than 75 years of
irreplaceable research were
destroyed Friday in an early
morning fire at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences.
Several scholars searched
through the wreckage of their
offices and left the scene in tears.
Others worked throughout the
day to save smoke-and
water-damaged files and papers.
The fire completely destroyed
ten offices and left most of the
others in the complex damaged by
smoke and water. Center officials
estimated damages to the wooden
building at between $50,000 and
$100,000.
Flames destroyed manuscripts,
papers and books that were the
products of some of the world's
leading scholars. The exact loss to
each of the scientists could not
immediately be determined.
Three Fires
Fire department officials
reported that arsonists attempted
to set fires in four locations. They
succeeded in demolishing two
opposite wings of the building
about 50 yards apart. Two
firebombs thrown into the
administrative section of the
complex failed to ignite.
In addition, a motorcycle that
belonged to one of the student
caretakers living near the center
was set afire in the middle of the
access road leading to the
building. Some brush near the
flaming motorcycle was also set
afire.
The center was established in
1956 with Ford Foundation
grant. Located in the foothills
near the golf course, it has no
direct connection with the
University other than the fact that
it was built on Stanford land. The
center is supported entirely
through private donations. The
complex had not been the target
of previous attacks.
No Direct ROTC Link
The center attracts about 50 of
the world's leading scholars each
year for long periods of study and
research on different aspects of
human behavior. Work destroyed
Friday included studies in deviant
behavior, moral philosophy,
psychology, student unrest and
welfare economics.
Police and fire department
officials found no direct
connection between the
continuing ROTC demonstrations
and the dawn fire. However, they
did not discount such a link. A
Santa Clara deputy fire marshall
said yesterday that an
investigation was continuing into
blaze.
Police discontinued their search
for four men on two motorcycles,
saying that such efforts were
irrelevant to the case. "Nothing
has really turned up," Paul
Andrade, a deputy fire marshall,
said. He said that tests might be
run today on some evidence
found at the scene.
Life's Work Destroyed
Prof. M.N. Srinivas - considered
to be India's leading social
scientist - suffered the greatest
loss. He had spent 22 years
studying the casts system in South
India, and had obtained a year's
leave from the University of New
Delhi to complete his work.
"His entire life's work has been
destroyed," said University of
Chicago anthropologist Sol Tax,
who also lost part of his study on
the American Indian.
"His collection of original notes
has been burned. What is lost is
the irreplaceable product of a
great scientist from India where
his science is sorely needed.
Senseless Destruction
"It was a senseless act of
destruction. What it does to a
human being is one thing; what it
does to a society to destroy this

product of learning, to the people
of India, is another," Tax said.
Srinivas, whose mother died
last week, left the smouldering
wreckage of his office in tears.
He said that his study of the
caste system "is of fundamental
interest to all sociologists."
Center's Value
"...This is my field study:
more and more I feel that I should
finish the study of the village. Of
course the center has been
magnificent to me. People outside
don't know how people can be
harassed. Without an institution
like that I don't think that there
will be development in the
behavioral sciences.
"We should try to understand
human beings more and more. If
they do not have places they can
go to and do some thinking, I
don't see any reason to continue.
"... People interested in
human society would be
interested in the kind of work I
was doing. We pay too much
attention to technology and too
little to human behavior. Those
people who want to change
society can't be estimated at all in
monetary terms," he said.
Vicious, Immoral Act
O. Meridith Wilson, president
of the University of Michigan
from 1960-67 and director of the
center, said, "What was burned
was a life. An entire life, totally
destroyed by people bent on
blind, mindless destruction. This
man has done nothing but good to
anyone and now he is ruined
because of a childish tantrum."
Prof. John Bunzel, chairman of
the department of political
science at San Francisco State,
also suffered a total loss. Last
year, Bunzel was subject to
constant harassment by radicals,
including a bomb threat, a threat
on his life, and tire slashings.
Bunzel diescribed the fire as "a
vicious act, an immoral act,
deserving nothing but the greatest
contempt . . . perpetrated by
people who have no apprecation
of the fundamental values of
western civilization "
Tragic Irony
"I wanted this year of research
and tranquility in these beautiful
surroundings," he said. "I think
that it is a tragic irony that such a
place as a behavioral center, which
is a symbol of the most cherished
values, stability and scholarship

combined, should be chosen as a
target for attack."
Howard S. Becker, a
Northwestern University
sociologist, also suffered what
officials termed a "total loss." He
was completing books and articles
on the effects of environment on
education, training and
socialization, as well as the effects

of drugs on the social structure.
Other scholars who suffered a
loss of works include: Richard B.
Brandt, philosophy, University of
Michigan; Steven Dedijer, docent
in sociology, University of
London; Prof, and Mrs. Howard
Kendler, psychologists at

SMOULDERING WRECKAGEâ€”This was the scene at the Outer lor Advanced Study ot the Behavioral Sciences alter two wings were gutted in a firebombing early
Friday morning. Seventy-five years worth of irreplaceable research were destroyed in the blaze which also caused $50,000 to $100,000 worth ol damage to the
building itself.
In an apparent act of arson,
more than 75 years of
irreplaceable research were
destroyed Friday in an early
morning fire at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences.
Several scholars searched
through the wreckage of their
offices and left the scene in tears.
Others worked throughout the
day to save smoke-and
water-damaged files and papers.
The fire completely destroyed
ten offices and left most of the
others in the complex damaged by
smoke and water. Center officials
estimated damages to the wooden
building at between $50,000 and
$100,000.
Flames destroyed manuscripts,
papers and books that were the
products of some of the world's
leading scholars. The exact loss to
each of the scientists could not
immediately be determined.
Three Fires
Fire department officials
reported that arsonists attempted
to set fires in four locations. They
succeeded in demolishing two
opposite wings of the building
about 50 yards apart. Two
firebombs thrown into the
administrative section of the
complex failed to ignite.
In addition, a motorcycle that
belonged to one of the student
caretakers living near the center
was set afire in the middle of the
access road leading to the
building. Some brush near the
flaming motorcycle was also set
afire.
The center was established in
1956 with Ford Foundation
grant. Located in the foothills
near the golf course, it has no
direct connection with the
University other than the fact that
it was built on Stanford land. The
center is supported entirely
through private donations. The
complex had not been the target
of previous attacks.
No Direct ROTC Link
The center attracts about 50 of
the world's leading scholars each
year for long periods of study and
research on different aspects of
human behavior. Work destroyed
Friday included studies in deviant
behavior, moral philosophy,
psychology, student unrest and
welfare economics.
Police and fire department
officials found no direct
connection between the
continuing ROTC demonstrations
and the dawn fire. However, they
did not discount such a link. A
Santa Clara deputy fire marshall
said yesterday that an
investigation was continuing into
blaze.
Police discontinued their search
for four men on two motorcycles,
saying that such efforts were
irrelevant to the case. "Nothing
has really turned up," Paul
Andrade, a deputy fire marshall,
said. He said that tests might be
run today on some evidence
found at the scene.
Life's Work Destroyed
Prof. M.N. Srinivas - considered
to be India's leading social
scientist - suffered the greatest
loss. He had spent 22 years
studying the casts system in South
India, and had obtained a year's
leave from the University of New
Delhi to complete his work.
"His entire life's work has been
destroyed," said University of
Chicago anthropologist Sol Tax,
who also lost part of his study on
the American Indian.
"His collection of original notes
has been burned. What is lost is
the irreplaceable product of a
great scientist from India where
his science is sorely needed.
Senseless Destruction
"It was a senseless act of
destruction. What it does to a
human being is one thing; what it
does to a society to destroy this

product of learning, to the people
of India, is another," Tax said.
Srinivas, whose mother died
last week, left the smouldering
wreckage of his office in tears.
He said that his study of the
caste system "is of fundamental
interest to all sociologists."
Center's Value
"...This is my field study:
more and more I feel that I should
finish the study of the village. Of
course the center has been
magnificent to me. People outside
don't know how people can be
harassed. Without an institution
like that I don't think that there
will be development in the
behavioral sciences.
"We should try to understand
human beings more and more. If
they do not have places they can
go to and do some thinking, I
don't see any reason to continue.
"... People interested in
human society would be
interested in the kind of work I
was doing. We pay too much
attention to technology and too
little to human behavior. Those
people who want to change
society can't be estimated at all in
monetary terms," he said.
Vicious, Immoral Act
O. Meridith Wilson, president
of the University of Michigan
from 1960-67 and director of the
center, said, "What was burned
was a life. An entire life, totally
destroyed by people bent on
blind, mindless destruction. This
man has done nothing but good to
anyone and now he is ruined
because of a childish tantrum."
Prof. John Bunzel, chairman of
the department of political
science at San Francisco State,
also suffered a total loss. Last
year, Bunzel was subject to
constant harassment by radicals,
including a bomb threat, a threat
on his life, and tire slashings.
Bunzel diescribed the fire as "a
vicious act, an immoral act,
deserving nothing but the greatest
contempt . . . perpetrated by
people who have no apprecation
of the fundamental values of
western civilization "
Tragic Irony
"I wanted this year of research
and tranquility in these beautiful
