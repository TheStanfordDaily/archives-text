# An Administration View
## We Must Protect 'The Idea' 
### Robert Rosenzweig 
I spent four hours on Friday as
the central attraction of a public
forum sponsored by the
Committee of Fifteen, on which I
serve as a representative of the
President. The ostensible purpose
of the meeting was to provide the
committee with information on
the events of the previous night. I
agreed to answer questions on the
actions taken by the
Administration and the police.
There was hardly a question in
a carload, if the word question
still means more than a speech
that ends on a rising inflection.
There was a good measure of
vilification in the customary
language of the revolution—those
repeated obscenities that bespeak
an arid mind and an impoverished
imagination. There was the
encouraging and moving
experience of having a student
with whom I have had sharp
political differences speak in
defense of my integrity without
yielding for a moment on the
issues which divide us. And to
observers of the revolution, I need
hardly add that the air was filled
with that odd blend of self-pity and
self-dramatization that marks the
rhetoric of the children of the rich
trying to act as the vanguard of
the poor.
But there was more. Mixed
with all of this was a question

which I take very seriously. How
could I justify a police action
against a sit-in that was by its own
definition, at least, peaceful and
non-violent? I want to address
that question at greater length
than was possible in that forum.
I believe that there are few
more distressing spectacles in a
university than the sight of large
numbers of police. I know that
mass arrests—perhaps especially in
a university—tend to catch those
whose innocence makes them
vulnerable and fail to catch those
whose sophistication makes them
wary. It was chiefly for this
reason that I was unhappy at the
prospect of arrests. I know, too,
that the presence of police on
other campuses has meant
violence, sometimes generated by
them, as often initiated or
provoked by others. Yet, I
favored calling the police on
Thursday night.
Possible Dangers Acceptable
I was willing to accept the
dangers that I knew to be possible
and the adverse consequences that
I knew to be certain because I
believe in the university. I do not
mean by that the red-tile roofs of
Stanford, or the sun setting on the
foothills, or whatever other
nostalgia binds people to a
particular place. Rather, I mean
by it the university as the place of
openness, of reason, of
persuasion, of the sharpened
mind, and the free imagination. I
believe the continued strength of
the university to be more
important to the future of man
than ROTC, low-income housing,
student power, faculty tenure,
trustee responsibility, or any
particular issue or set of issues
that confronts us now.
I know of no university that
fully meets my ideal, nor do I ever
expect to see one. I do know,
however, that events of the last
month at Stanford have moved
this University in the wrong
direction, and the direction of
that movement had to be
changed. The movement to which
I refer does not have to do with
ideology—which should stand or
fall on its merits —but with
behavior. Most people at Stanford
presumably agree that a mob
raging across the campus at night
and breaking windows should not
be tolerated. Many
people—unhappily fewer—also
agree that a "mill-in" which
disrupts classes and other
university work is also
inadmissible.
It is clear to me, and I must
hope to many others, that the Old
Union sit-in of Thursday night,
which continued in violation of a
regulation passed by the
student-faculty legislative body
and in defiance of a warning from

the police that the conduct was
illegal, is also inadmissible in a
university. 1 insist on this even
though the building was not
destroyed and people were not
maimed in the course of the sit-in.
I insist on it because a university
has an obligation, not just a right,
to protect the fragile processes
which keep it open and protective
of that most fragile human
product, the idea. It was in
fulfillment of that obligation that
I participated in an act that was in
so many other ways an act of
sadness.
Reason untempered by feeling
is a clear and present danger to
man; reason routed by feeling is
an unmitigated disaster. I have
heard two analogies in recent days
that suggest to me that we are
nearer to the latter than the
former. Several people at the
Friday meeting argued that the
Thursday sit-in was in the
tradition of Martin Luther King
and Ghandi. That analogy can
only be described as an abdication
of intellect. To compare the
spectacle of 150 or so people
running from the police and then
rampaging across the campus to
the actions of King and Ghandi is
an obscenity on the lives and
memories of those great men. To
hear it cheered in a university
audience is cause for genuine
despair. To see it pass
unchallenged by faculty and
students alike is, in the jargon,
mind-blowing.
The second revealing analogy
was made by several speakers at
the Old Union on Thursday. The
situation there, they suggested,
was very much like the sit-down
strikes at General Motors during
the 1930'5. Hold its machinery
hostage, they said, and the
University, like GM, would be
brought to its knees. It would be
easy to pass this off as just
another example of adolescent
self-glorification. That it may be,
but it is more. It is so profound a
failure of understanding about the
unique nature of a university and
its singular and irreplaceable
importance, that it must cause
anybody who purports to be
either teacher or student to come
to a halt. If large numbers of
people truly believe that the
university is merely another
corporation and the students its
peculiar kind of labor union, then
the university is dead. If, however,
as I deeply believe, the idea of the
university is still alive and can be
saved, let us please get on with the
job of education that, alone, can
save it.
