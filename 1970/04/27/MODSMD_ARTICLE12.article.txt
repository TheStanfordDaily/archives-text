Editor, THK DAILY:
The demonstrators
participating in the sit-in at the
Old Union decided at a meeting
(around 6 p m. on Thursday) to
leave the building when the police
arrived in numbers. Members of
the University administration (and
the community at large) were
fully aware of this decision.
Nevertheless, the administration,
knowing well in advance that the
police would arrive at
approximately 1 a.m., prevented

that information from reaching
the demonstrators —apparently to
allow the police to make as many
arrests as possible. This sequence
of events suggests a tactic of
deliberate confrontation with the
demonstrators.
We are opposed to ItOTC, «'md
believe that the administration's
tactic, by encouraging
polarization, has minimized the
likelihood of legitimate
no n-disruptive protest at
Stanford, and has diminished the
potential effectiveness of a

powerful, orderly, and
broad-based opposition to ROTC.

The purposes of this
community are ill-served by the
process of action and reaction
that has led us in a downward
spiral these last few weeks,
culminating in the events of
Thursday evening and Friday
morning both on campus and at
the Behavioral Sciences Center.
This is equally true whether any
specific event had its origins in the
lino nninl.s <>r Inu/ Ol- in mrtrnl

outrage. I, for one, call upon all
reasonable members of the
Stanford community, students,
faculty, and administrators alike,
to use every opportunity Monday
and Tuesday, in and out of class,
in living groups, offices, and
homes, for earnest conversation
about our present attitudes so
that we may determine that
course which will serve not any
one group or constituency on or
off campus but the university and
education itself.

Sit-In Like Adults
Kditor, TIIK DAILY:
One of the most persistent
demands of students today is that
they be treated like adults. They

want increased authority over
affairs within the universities
which they attend and increased
power to deal with issues in the
world at large.
In view of this fact, it is
distressing to see some of those
involved in the recent sit-in refuse
to assume one of the essential
attributes of adulthood: the
necessity of accepting the legal
consequences of one's actions.
Demands for amnesty, pleas that
they should be dispersed rather
than arrested for an illegal act,
and insistence that they be tipped
off immediately prior to police
action amount to demands that
they be treated not as adults
capable of acting responsibly in
the world at large but as children
protected from harsh reality by
the benevolent indulgence of an
intervening university.
Those who openly perform acts
of civil disobedience with a full
willingness to accept the
consequences have my highest
respect even when I disagree with
their goals. Those who seek to
perform such acts anonymously
and then complain when they are
brought to account have neither

my respect nor my sympathy.

As of Friday morning, the
non-violent sit-in is a dead tactic
at Stanford. We thought we could
expect time to disperse before
arrests were made. You and the
sheriff proved that we can expect
nothing.
You play a subtle political
game here at Stanford, hut don't
expect the Off-ROTC movement

to play by your rules again. Your
insistence on violent dispersion of
a peaceful demonstration has
made it necessary for us to make
our own rules.

As of Friday morning, the
non-violent sit-in is a dead tactic
at Stanford. We thought we could
expect time to disperse before
arrests were made. You and the
sheriff proved that we can expect
nothing.
You play a subtle political
game here at Stanford, hut don't
expect the Off-ROTC movement

to play by your rules again. Your
insistence on violent dispersion of
a peaceful demonstration has
made it necessary for us to make
our own rules.

The demonstrators
participating in the sit-in at the
Old Union decided at a meeting
(around 6 p m. on Thursday) to
leave the building when the police
arrived in numbers. Members of
the University administration (and
the community at large) were
fully aware of this decision.
Nevertheless, the administration,
knowing well in advance that the
police would arrive at
approximately 1 a.m., prevented

that information from reaching
the demonstrators —apparently to
allow the police to make as many
arrests as possible. This sequence
of events suggests a tactic of
deliberate confrontation with the
demonstrators.
We are opposed to ItOTC, «'md
believe that the administration's
tactic, by encouraging
polarization, has minimized the
likelihood of legitimate
no n-disruptive protest at
Stanford, and has diminished the
potential effectiveness of a

powerful, orderly, and
broad-based opposition to ROTC.

One of the most persistent
demands of students today is that
they be treated like adults. They

want increased authority over
affairs within the universities
which they attend and increased
power to deal with issues in the
world at large.
In view of this fact, it is
distressing to see some of those
involved in the recent sit-in refuse
to assume one of the essential
attributes of adulthood: the
necessity of accepting the legal
consequences of one's actions.
Demands for amnesty, pleas that
they should be dispersed rather
than arrested for an illegal act,
and insistence that they be tipped
off immediately prior to police
action amount to demands that
they be treated not as adults
capable of acting responsibly in
the world at large but as children
protected from harsh reality by
the benevolent indulgence of an

homes, for earnest conversation
about our present attitudes so
that we may determine that
course which will serve not any
one group or constituency on or
off campus but the university and
education itself.

Kditor, TIIK DAILY:
It's a case where violence
against property is real violence
against people. Unnecessary
political violence is not morally
neutral. Get rid of ItOTC and the
arsonist.

Sit-In Like Adults
Kditor, TIIK DAILY:
One of the most persistent
demands of students today is that
they be treated like adults. They

want increased authority over
affairs within the universities
which they attend and increased
power to deal with issues in the
world at large.
In view of this fact, it is
distressing to see some of those
involved in the recent sit-in refuse
to assume one of the essential
attributes of adulthood: the
necessity of accepting the legal
consequences of one's actions.
Demands for amnesty, pleas that
they should be dispersed rather
than arrested for an illegal act,
and insistence that they be tipped
off immediately prior to police
action amount to demands that
they be treated not as adults
capable of acting responsibly in
the world at large but as children
protected from harsh reality by
the benevolent indulgence of an
intervening university.
Those who openly perform acts
of civil disobedience with a full
willingness to accept the
consequences have my highest
respect even when I disagree with
their goals. Those who seek to
perform such acts anonymously
and then complain when they are
brought to account have neither

my respect nor my sympathy.

General I'il/.er:
As of Friday morning, the
non-violent sit-in is a dead tactic
at Stanford. We thought we could
expect time to disperse before
arrests were made. You and the
sheriff proved that we can expect
nothing.
You play a subtle political
game here at Stanford, hut don't
expect the Off-ROTC movement

to play by your rules again. Your
insistence on violent dispersion of
a peaceful demonstration has
made it necessary for us to make
our own rules.
