# Some Thoughts On C-15
## Discussion On Administrations Terms 
### Drekmeiers 
The Committee of Fifteen,
acting as a fact-finding body, met
in open session Friday afternoon
to hear testimony concerning the
arrests made early that morning.
One member of the
Administration, a representative
of the Dean of Students, two
faculty representatives (one of
whom left within fifteen
minutes), and four students were
present. There can not have been
more than ten or a dozen faculty
members in the Tresidder lounge,
although we are certain that many
times that number believe that the
stage has been set for another
Columbia.
The meeting was useful, at
times very revealing, and those
attending must have come away
with impressions of the events,
and decisions leading up to them,
very different from those of the
readers of Saturday's Chronicle.
We learned that Administration
officials and designated faculty
observers knew well in advance of
the arrests that the Sheriff's
Office was intent on maximizing
the number of arrests and that to
achieve this a blitz operation was
necessary. No Stanford
representative with that
knowledge, and the knowledge
that the students in the Old Union
were prepared to leave the
building when the police arrived,
moved to inform the sit-in that

the intent of the sheriff was
entrapment rather than clearing
the building.
It is clear why the sheriff, after
a number of cat and mouse games
on the campus and with county
taxpayers to answer to, should
choose such a strategy and tactics.
It is not clear to us why
representatives of the University
chose to abdicate responsibility or
should this be a misreading of the
situation, what they thought was
to be gained by actions which a
massive collection of evidence and
experience shows can only further
aggravate problems, polarize
opinion to the point where every
issue is elevated into a principle
and resists attempts at any form
of intelligent analysis - Ist alone
compromise, and delight the very
persons who are viewed as most
destructive of the purposes of the
University. We write critically of
recent Stanford decisions because,
as members of the faculty we
stand implicated if we do not
speak up.
Stanford officials tell us that
they will not respond to pressure,
but they themselves have exerted
types of pressure in the campaign
to alter last year's decision on the
ROTC. They call for rational
discourse but their actions define
the conditions for "rational
discourse" within precisely the
context that is subject to attack

by an increasing number of
students and faculty. Rational
discourse can take place only
where the fundamental
assumptions from which men
speak are themselves clarified and
subject to analysis. When we
despair of the possibilities of such
rational discourse, violence may
be the only alternative. "You have
to ... do something violent, in
order to get any attention at all,
however good your cause or your
causes, however patient you have
been, however well you have put
your case. There is an absolute
stone wall of indifference."
Fund am en tal Difference
It should be clear to all that
there is a fundamental difference
in the positions from which
almost any significant issue - at
present ROTC - is viewed by those
who find themselves in conflict.
For example, whereas ROTC was
also an issue in the 1950'5, at that
time there were very few young
men or women who questioned
and challenged the whole
structure of the American
economic system, values, and way
of life. Today many young
people, most of them among the
most intellectual in our
Universities, question our system,
its current functioning, its values
and its ends. This critical
enterprise has a legitimacy
reaching back to the beginnings of

Western philosophy â€¢ Plato's
Republic representing only one
example of the challenge.
To others, for whom the basic
workings of this system remain
both unanalyzed and
unchallenged, each issue is
atomized and viewed from one or
another of the conventional,
perfectly "respectable" positions
within the system (whether that
of the highly articulate lawyer
who knows what works why, or
the professor who pursues his
research with assurance that it
remains"pure"). Until this
fundamental difference is clearly
recognized and itself becomes an
issue for focal discussion,
references to "rational discourse''
are invariably defense mechanisms
or those who fail to grasp the
seriousness of what it means "to
think" in 1970.
Decisions, we are told, must be
made through channels, but the
spirit of those decisions has on
occasion been countermanded.
Student and faculty are criticized
for simplifying issues, but
administrators and their
spokesmen take refuge in
complexification. They claim to
represent the university, but, as
one member of the faculty noted
at the Friday session, there is little
to indicate that the President is
advised by men who differ with
him on significant issues. They

bemoan destructive violence, but
a criminal charge is brought
against those participating in what
we and others observed to be a
non-violent expression of protest
and they defend agencies and
research that serves international
violence. They call for increased
student responsibility, but the
assignment of students to a
passive consumer status can only
encourage irresponsibility. They
speak righteously of the idea of a
university and then deny the
elements of the critical and moral
tradition that provides its
justification.
There is a crisis in the
university. Us name is cynicism.
Faculty who spend weeks away
from the university on projects of
their own condemn colleagues
who use class time to discuss
issues that are important to
students and to the nation. We
busy ourselves with reasons for
not taking a stand. We speak at
length on the importance of value
neutrality, but we all know that
knowledge is itself a normative
word. We demand "realism" from
our students and are not
completely surprised when they
suggest that this is a demand for
limited aspiration; the possibility
is attainable only if enough men
believe in that possibility. We
spoke of institutional loyalty and
then felt like suckers when the
salary figures were published and
everyone learned that a man's
value to the university is, in terms
of hard cash, exactly what the '
market dictates. (Of course the
universities do not allow the
relation of student and professor
Whereas it is clear that the
university has critical as well as
training functions, the
relationship between these is not
at all clear. The university is seen
as a preparation for the
acceptance of citizenship, but it is
not always understood that
responsibility is not the same as
loyalty. Standing in a peculiar
position between family and
society, the ambiguity of the
university's position is
compounded by the increasing
variety of constituencies that have
become involved in the processes
of higher education. Because these
demand different sets of reasons
for university policies there is also
an increasing tendency to avoid
giving underlying reasons, because
these reasons increasingly expose
authorities to criticism. But
reason is the basis of modern
authority; silence and obfuscation
eventually dissolve legitimacy.
Function of Audience
Argumentation is always a
, function of the audience to which
it is addressed. Today the variety
of audiences threatens the
university to the extent that it
relies on rational argumentation.
The trustees, once functional,
now compound the difficulty.
Research contracts likewise. And
because universities tend to see all
proof as demonstrative proof,
argumentation, which does not
allow for the clear separation of
thought and action, is easily
misunderstood and sometimes
banned and often regulated.
Administrators, as they become
more closely associated with other
institutions of society begin to
think like other managers more
concerned with the suppression
and control of conflict than with
the creation of responsible
citizenship, attempting to hide
elements of conflict behind a
facade of routine and order. Their
dream is a context that maximizes
predictability. The capacity to
control overshadows the purposes
to which power is put. The
objectives of American foreign
policy are not so different from
t those of college administrators.
And in such a view of order all
disruption is immediately seen as
crime.
From the point of view of
many students even bare
recognition of the issues doesn't
appear to take place until after
disruptions. Lacking a common
experience, which is the basis of
non-dominative discourse,
communication must fabricate a
.shared affect by inducing anxiety.
While there is still a potential basis
for trust, we whose university this
is must expose the double-bind
that is turning us into characters
in an Albee drama and must
decide what we're doing here. No
business as usual until we have
begun the restoration of this
university. The possibilities are
here for men of good faith.
