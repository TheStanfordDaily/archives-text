## Old Union: Sit-In Or Pig-In? 
### George Powell 
I have just come from observing
the remnants of the "non-violent"
sit-in at the Old Union. From
these remnants, I can only
conclude that the term pig-in
would be more appropriate.
For almost the entire academic
year, I have not commented on
the Stanford scene, feeling that
with just a year here, I did not
fully grasp the Stanford ethos; but
I can see from the senseless,
useless and downright worthless
tactics of the off-ROTC messies,
no reason for any of the amnesty
that they have been crying for.
From what I know of the
"tradition of David Harris" he has
been willing to accept punishment
for the breaking of what may be
an unjust law. These pig-iners,
with their chocolate creme
sandwiches and Red Mountain
gallons, want all the benefits of
their moral imperative with none
of the responsibilities that taking
a stand engenders.
"We want ROTC removed
immediately, and to be patted on
the back for breaking thousands
of dollars worth of windows", is
in the same league with President
Nixon's desire to be patted on the
back for withdrawing troops from
Vietnam while escalating conflicts
in Cambodia and Laos.
Since the national
administration practices senseless
violence, then the pig-iners feel
that they too should wallow in
the trough of violence, although
all off-ROTC protesters are still
far morally superior to Richard
Nixon.
And if the Daily thinks, as was
implicit in their coverage of the
sit-in, that the demonstrators

should have been warned again at
1 a.m. after being warned earlier
of possible arrest at 5:45 p.m.,
then the reporters who wrote the
story must think the
demonstrators are children, and
not adults. One warning of
impending action is usually
enough for most adults, and any
subsequent action could hardly be
classified as a blitzkreig.

Finally an informal comment of
John Shoch's informal comment.
It was gratifying to see a defeated
candidate use the same
rationalization as Goldwater
supporters did in 1964, which
showed that conservative radical
strength is increasing and
27,000,000 Americans (2000
Stanfordites)can't be wrong. And
to equate only their movement

with "real" politics smacks of
marvelous political elitism. "No
matter what we do, our position is
right."
"No matter what anyone else
says, our position is right."
I condemn the off-ROTC
movement for being essentially
authoritarian and anti-intellectual.

the Stanford scene, feeling that
with just a year here, I did not
fully grasp the Stanford ethos; but
I can see from the senseless,
useless and downright worthless
tactics of the off-ROTC messies,
no reason for any of the amnesty
that they have been crying for.
From what I know of the
"tradition of David Harris" he has
been willing to accept punishment
for the breaking of what may be
an unjust law. These pig-iners,
with their chocolate creme
sandwiches and Red Mountain
gallons, want all the benefits of
their moral imperative with none
of the responsibilities that taking
a stand engenders.
"We want ROTC removed
immediately, and to be patted on
the back for breaking thousands
of dollars worth of windows", is
in the same league with President
Nixon's desire to be patted on the
back for withdrawing troops from
Vietnam while escalating conflicts
in Cambodia and Laos.
Since the national
administration practices senseless
violence, then the pig-iners feel
that they too should wallow in
the trough of violence, although
all off-ROTC protesters are still
far morally superior to Richard
Nixon.
And if the Daily thinks, as was
implicit in their coverage of the
sit-in, that the demonstrators

should have been warned again at
1 a.m. after being warned earlier
of possible arrest at 5:45 p.m.,
then the reporters who wrote the
story must think the
demonstrators are children, and
not adults. One warning of
impending action is usually
enough for most adults, and any
subsequent action could hardly be
classified as a blitzkreig.

Finally an informal comment of
John Shoch's informal comment.
It was gratifying to see a defeated
candidate use the same
rationalization as Goldwater
supporters did in 1964, which
showed that conservative radical
strength is increasing and
27,000,000 Americans (2000
Stanfordites)can't be wrong. And
to equate only their movement

with "real" politics smacks of
marvelous political elitism. "No
matter what we do, our position is
right."
"No matter what anyone else
says, our position is right."
I condemn the off-ROTC
movement for being essentially
authoritarian and anti-intellectual.

I have just come from observing
the remnants of the "non-violent"
sit-in at the Old Union. From
these remnants, I can only
conclude that the term pig-in
would be more appropriate.
For almost the entire academic
year, I have not commented on
