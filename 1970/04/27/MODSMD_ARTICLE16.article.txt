# Inconsistent Stands
## A 						Hard Look At The Protestors 
### Prof. Philip Rhinelander 
The most important single fact
about the events at the Old Union
last week was the status of those
taken into custody by the police.
Almost half—ll out of 23
according to published
accounts—were not Stanford
students. Of the twelve Stanford
students arrested, six were
freshmen and four were
sophomores. None of the
Stanford students who were
leaders in the activist movement
stayed to face arrest with their
cohorts.
Several conclusions follow:
1. The involvement of
non-students destroys the
argument that the University
should have relied solely upon its
own internal judicial system, since
the University's judicial system
does not and cannot apply to
outsiders. As long as outsiders are
involved in campus activism, the

University must necessarily rely
on external agencies to deal with
disruption.
2. The involvement of
substantial numbers of outsiders
also discredits the claim that the
University should have given
immediate warning of the police
intervention. To claim that the
University had such a duty
presupposes that the University
was dealing solely with its own
students, which was not the case.
It also presupposes that with
respect to its own students, the
University stands in loco parentis,
a doctrine which the activists
themselves have consistently
rejected.
3. Student activist leaders have
often talked about the need to
"put one's body on the line" in
support of one's moral ideals. This
is a good moral principle,

provided one is willing to live by
it, as men like Gandhi, Thoreau
and Martin Luther King did. But
today's activist leaders do not
seem to practice what they
preach; they avoid putting their
bodies on the line as far as
possible and leave their followers
to take the rap.
I would add, on the basis of my
own experience as one of the
faculty observers, that the police
tactics of surprise succeded in one
of the main objectives, namely
minimizing violence. If advance
warning had been given, it is
almost certain that the police
would have been met initially
with missiles and that there would
have been more arrests on more
serious charges than actually took
place.
