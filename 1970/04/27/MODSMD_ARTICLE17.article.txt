# Insurance Costs
## Premium Increase 
### 
Stanford insurance coverage has
been drastically cut back because
of the demand by insurance
companies for far higher
premiums for much less coverage.
The plan, approved by the
Board of Trustees, calls for
coverage of damage by fire,
vandalism, and malicious mischief
as well as extended coverage with
a $500,000 deductible per
occurrance. Previous coverage
included only a $25,000
deductible per occurrance.
Also, the new policy provides
no earthquake coverage while last
year's insurance policy provided
for coverage with a $300,000
deductible. Previous coverage had
a premium of $203,957 while the
new policy will cost about the
same—s2oo,ooo.
In addition, the University is
budgeting $400,000 annually into
a reserve to cover deductible
losses to help meet damages in the
event of an earthquake.
Stanford's experience parallels
that of many universities and
public school systems across the
country, many of which have had
no major loss experience
whatsoever.
Insurance companies blame the
increase on campus disruptions
and fires. Critics say the firms
have panicked unnecessarily, and
criticize the entry of
conglomerate firms into this
market. One result has been a
trend toward self-insurance.
Stanford's fire losses were
$337,000 in 1968 and $125,000
in 1969. Window breakage and
other vandalism, not including
Friday's fire, has totaled well over
$50,000 as far this quarter.
The American Insurance
Association has reported that,
during the first eight months of
1969, campus disorders accounted
for more than half of all losses
from civil disorders; in 1968,
proportion was less than two
percent. Loss payments as of
September were nearly $9 million,
compared to less than $1 million
at the same time in 1968.
Last year, the Pacific Fire
Rating Bureau, which sets the
standard rate for member
insurance companies, announced a
40 percent increase in fire
insurance costs for all schools and
universities in California, because
of increased arson. (Rates were
increased 35 percent in 1966.)
From 1963 to 1967, the Bureau
said, insurers paid out an average
of $124.50 in school fire losses
and company operating costs for
every $100 collected in premiums.
Big Rale Increases
"But all schools and colleges
are paying big rate increases even
if they suffered no losses," says
Robert H. Beth, Stanford
University insurance manager.
"A major midwestern
university, with no student unrest
or arson, had its deductible
increased from $10,000 to
$25,000 and its premium by 33
percent."
The premium at a major
Southern California institution,
with no trouble of any kind, went
from $250 to $2500, and the
premium was expected to jump
40 percent on renewal.
"Another peaceful campus in
the Rockies had its deductible
increased from $1000 to
$100,000, and its premium from
$41,000 to $115,000—and it was
having a hard time buying any
insurance. At another big
midwestern university, again with
no major losses, the deductible
went from $1000 to $100,000,
and the premium from $37,000 to
$85,000.
"While insurance companies
have found their rates inadequate,
there are other factors. One of
them is that conglomerates have
purchased many insurance
companies and created a great
deal of pressure on them to 'make
ASSU Difficulties
The ASSU has run into the
same problem. Last Year's general
liability policy cost $300 for
bodily injury up to $1 million,
propertydamage to $100,000, and
personal injury (i.e., libel) up to
$100,000.
When it expired, the company
quoted a premium of $250,000,
an increase of about 85,000
percent. Of 50 other companies
contacted, only one would insure
ASSU, and only for bodily injury
up to $500,000 and property
damage up to $100,000. The
premium is $10,000.
"Earthquake insurance is very
difficult to obtain and
prohibitively expensive," says
Beth. "Most universities in the
state, including the University of
California, do not have any
earthquake coverage.
"If there were a major quake
elsewhere in the state, I wouldn't
be surprised if all earthquake
coverage were cancelled, and all of
the premiums Stanford would
have paid to protect against a
future catastrophe would be lost.
There is no rhyme or reason to
it."

After a recent survey of campus
insurance problems, Curtis B.

Lilly, president of a New Jersey
corporate insurance management
and advisory concern, charged
that the insurance industry is
"panicking" over student unrest.
Campus losses in 1968, Lilly
said, were almost exactly the same
as the annual average during the
previous five years. Insurance
spokesmen denied it, and said the
loss ratio for 1967, the latest
figures available, was half again as
high as the 1962-66 period.
Beth commented that
underwriters in many
cases—particularly involving
earthquake insurance—have
"increased their rates to such an
extent that it is economically
unsound" to buy.
Oscar H. Serbein, professor of
insurance at the Graduate School
of Business, says that insurance
companies, faced with mounting
losses, either "may raise rates or
dry up the market by not offering
some coverages or by being very
selective.

world need insurance, and if
private companies cannot answer

Insurance companies blame the
increase on campus disruptions
and fires. Critics say the firms
have panicked unnecessarily, and
criticize the entry of
conglomerate firms into this

trend toward self-insurance.
Stanford's fire losses were
$337,000 in 1968 and $125,000
in 1969. Window breakage and
other vandalism, not including
Friday's fire, has totaled well over
$50,000 as far this quarter.
The American Insurance
Association has reported that,
during the first eight months of
1969, campus disorders accounted
for more than half of all losses
from civil disorders; in 1968,
proportion was less than two
percent. Loss payments as of
September were nearly $9 million,
compared to less than $1 million
at the same time in 1968.
Last year, the Pacific Fire
Rating Bureau, which sets the
standard rate for member
insurance companies, announced a
40 percent increase in fire
insurance costs for all schools and
universities in California, because
of increased arson. (Rates were
increased 35 percent in 1966.)
From 1963 to 1967, the Bureau
said, insurers paid out an average
of $124.50 in school fire losses
and company operating costs for
every $100 collected in premiums.

"But all schools and colleges
are paying big rate increases even
if they suffered no losses," says
Robert H. Beth, Stanford
University insurance manager.
"A major midwestern
university, with no student unrest
or arson, had its deductible
increased from $10,000 to
$25,000 and its premium by 33
percent."
The premium at a major
Southern California institution,
with no trouble of any kind, went
from $250 to $2500, and the
premium was expected to jump
40 percent on renewal.
"Another peaceful campus in
the Rockies had its deductible
increased from $1000 to
$100,000, and its premium from
$41,000 to $115,000—and it was
having a hard time buying any
insurance. At another big
midwestern university, again with
no major losses, the deductible
went from $1000 to $100,000,
and the premium from $37,000 to
$85,000.

there are other factors. One of

ASSU Difficulties
The ASSU has run into the
same problem. Last Year's general
liability policy cost $300 for
bodily injury up to $1 million,
propertydamage to $100,000, and
personal injury (i.e., libel) up to
$100,000.
When it expired, the company
quoted a premium of $250,000,
an increase of about 85,000
percent. Of 50 other companies
contacted, only one would insure
ASSU, and only for bodily injury
up to $500,000 and property
damage up to $100,000. The
premium is $10,000.
"Earthquake insurance is very
difficult to obtain and
prohibitively expensive," says
Beth. "Most universities in the
state, including the University of
California, do not have any
earthquake coverage.
"If there were a major quake
elsewhere in the state, I wouldn't
be surprised if all earthquake
coverage were cancelled, and all of
the premiums Stanford would
have paid to protect against a
future catastrophe would be lost.
There is no rhyme or reason to

After a recent survey of campus
insurance problems, Curtis B.

Lilly, president of a New Jersey
corporate insurance management
and advisory concern, charged
that the insurance industry is
"panicking" over student unrest.
Campus losses in 1968, Lilly
said, were almost exactly the same
as the annual average during the
previous five years. Insurance
spokesmen denied it, and said the
loss ratio for 1967, the latest
figures available, was half again as
high as the 1962-66 period.
Beth commented that
underwriters in many
cases—particularly involving
earthquake insurance—have
"increased their rates to such an
extent that it is economically
unsound" to buy.
Oscar H. Serbein, professor of
insurance at the Graduate School
of Business, says that insurance
companies, faced with mounting
losses, either "may raise rates or
dry up the market by not offering
some coverages or by being very
selective.
"But the public and business
world need insurance, and if
private companies cannot answer
that need, the government may
have to step in."
Stanford insurance coverage has
been drastically cut back because
of the demand by insurance
companies for far higher
premiums for much less coverage.
The plan, approved by the
Board of Trustees, calls for
coverage of damage by fire,
vandalism, and malicious mischief
as well as extended coverage with
a $500,000 deductible per
occurrance. Previous coverage
included only a $25,000
deductible per occurrance.
Also, the new policy provides
no earthquake coverage while last
year's insurance policy provided
for coverage with a $300,000
deductible. Previous coverage had
a premium of $203,957 while the
new policy will cost about the
same—s2oo,ooo.
In addition, the University is
budgeting $400,000 annually into
a reserve to cover deductible
losses to help meet damages in the
event of an earthquake.

40 percent increase in fire
insurance costs for all schools and
universities in California, because
of increased arson. (Rates were
increased 35 percent in 1966.)
From 1963 to 1967, the Bureau
said, insurers paid out an average
of $124.50 in school fire losses
and company operating costs for
every $100 collected in premiums.
Big Rale Increases
"But all schools and colleges
are paying big rate increases even
if they suffered no losses," says
Robert H. Beth, Stanford
University insurance manager.
"A major midwestern
university, with no student unrest
or arson, had its deductible
increased from $10,000 to
$25,000 and its premium by 33
percent."
The premium at a major
Southern California institution,
with no trouble of any kind, went
from $250 to $2500, and the
premium was expected to jump
40 percent on renewal.
"Another peaceful campus in
the Rockies had its deductible
increased from $1000 to
$100,000, and its premium from
$41,000 to $115,000—and it was
having a hard time buying any
insurance. At another big
midwestern university, again with
no major losses, the deductible
went from $1000 to $100,000,
and the premium from $37,000 to
$85,000.
"While insurance companies
have found their rates inadequate,
there are other factors. One of
them is that conglomerates have
purchased many insurance
companies and created a great
deal of pressure on them to 'make
ASSU Difficulties
The ASSU has run into the
same problem. Last Year's general
liability policy cost $300 for
bodily injury up to $1 million,
propertydamage to $100,000, and
personal injury (i.e., libel) up to
$100,000.
When it expired, the company
quoted a premium of $250,000,
an increase of about 85,000
percent. Of 50 other companies
contacted, only one would insure
ASSU, and only for bodily injury
up to $500,000 and property
damage up to $100,000. The
premium is $10,000.
"Earthquake insurance is very
difficult to obtain and
prohibitively expensive," says
Beth. "Most universities in the
state, including the University of
California, do not have any
earthquake coverage.
"If there were a major quake
elsewhere in the state, I wouldn't
be surprised if all earthquake
coverage were cancelled, and all of
the premiums Stanford would
have paid to protect against a
future catastrophe would be lost.
There is no rhyme or reason to
it."

After a recent survey of campus
insurance problems, Curtis B.

Lilly, president of a New Jersey
corporate insurance management
and advisory concern, charged
that the insurance industry is
"panicking" over student unrest.
Campus losses in 1968, Lilly
said, were almost exactly the same
as the annual average during the
previous five years. Insurance
spokesmen denied it, and said the
loss ratio for 1967, the latest
figures available, was half again as
high as the 1962-66 period.
Beth commented that
underwriters in many
cases—particularly involving
earthquake insurance—have
"increased their rates to such an
extent that it is economically
unsound" to buy.
Oscar H. Serbein, professor of
insurance at the Graduate School
of Business, says that insurance
companies, faced with mounting
losses, either "may raise rates or
dry up the market by not offering
some coverages or by being very
selective.
"But the public and business
world need insurance, and if
private companies cannot answer
that need, the government may
have to step in."
Stanford insurance coverage has
been drastically cut back because
of the demand by insurance
companies for far higher
premiums for much less coverage.
The plan, approved by the
Board of Trustees, calls for
coverage of damage by fire,
vandalism, and malicious mischief
as well as extended coverage with
a $500,000 deductible per
occurrance. Previous coverage
included only a $25,000
deductible per occurrance.
Also, the new policy provides
no earthquake coverage while last
year's insurance policy provided
for coverage with a $300,000
deductible. Previous coverage had
a premium of $203,957 while the
new policy will cost about the
same—s2oo,ooo.
In addition, the University is
budgeting $400,000 annually into
a reserve to cover deductible
losses to help meet damages in the
event of an earthquake.
Stanford's experience parallels
that of many universities and
public school systems across the
country, many of which have had
no major loss experience
whatsoever.
Insurance companies blame the
increase on campus disruptions
and fires. Critics say the firms
have panicked unnecessarily, and
criticize the entry of
conglomerate firms into this
market. One result has been a
trend toward self-insurance.
Stanford's fire losses were
$337,000 in 1968 and $125,000
in 1969. Window breakage and
other vandalism, not including
Friday's fire, has totaled well over
$50,000 as far this quarter.
The American Insurance
Association has reported that,
during the first eight months of
1969, campus disorders accounted
for more than half of all losses
from civil disorders; in 1968,
proportion was less than two
percent. Loss payments as of
September were nearly $9 million,
compared to less than $1 million
at the same time in 1968.
