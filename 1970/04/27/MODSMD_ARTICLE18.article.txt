# Non-Violent Group Urges Positive Acts
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Following the violent events of
the sit-in last week, two
dormitory groups united to form
what they call "The Non-Violent
Group," which has committed
itself to positive peaceful action in
an effort to resolve political
conflicts.
The Non-Violent Group is an
outgrowth of a group in Toyon
who were circulating a petition
urging non-violent action and
discovered a similar group at work
at Twain House.
The groups got together and
have co-authored a new
document, and a petition now in
circulation.
The petition reads "We do not
condone violence on the part of
individuals of the University, the
police, the student body, or the
community. We particularly
oppose violence by any side in
connection with the off-ROTC
conflict. Wo believe that violence
can be ended only by each
individual's commitment to
non-violence."
The purpose of the petition is
two fold, to get people to commit
themselves to a course of
non-violent action and to get
signatures which will be printed in
a full page statement in the Daily
to indicate community support of
non-violence as a means to
positive political goals.
Active N oil-Violence
The g>*oup feels that
"non-violence when it is non
active is useless" according to its
statement of policy. Although it
feels that a course of action must
be decided by the general
membership of the group to
decide long-range policies, it has
drafted some proposals for
immediate action including a
"mobilization of non-violent
people through talk, statements in
the Daily, meetings so that we
can see how many non-violent
persons there are; reducing

tensions among all groups on
campus by offering food and
songs in an atmosphere of love, to
spread feelings of humanity ; and a
forum on ROTC in which all
people can come and express their
views."
The forum will include all
major interests such as the
off-ROTC movement, the
administration, trustees, and FCM
and will attempt to be free from
coercoin. A mass meeting is
planned for early this week to
decide on further action.
Aside from the immediate issue
of ROTC on campus, the
non -violent group plans to
dedicate itself to the elimination
of institutionalized violence
through non-violent tactics. The
University structure, the
Department of Defense, the
government, and other groups
which conduct active and hidden
violence against man and his
environment are targets for
long-range consideration.
Deeper Causes
The group realizes that the
violence stemming from the
off-ROTC conflict is only a
manifestation of the deeper
institutionalized violence in this
country. The members of the
group feel that it will be the
individual's committment to
non-violence which will serve as
the essential tool in reforming this
country's institutionalized
violence.
Petitions are being circulated in
dorms and classes to allow people
to show their support, and
collections are being taken in an
attempt to finance a Daily ad. The
group emphasizes its openess to
students, faculty, and
administrators who believe that
non-violence is the path to
breaking down the violence,
dehumanization, and fear that
exists at Stanford, and invites all
members of the community to
their meeting to be held later this
week.

administration, trustees, and FCM
and will attempt to be free from
coercoin. A mass meeting is
planned for early this week to
decide on further action.
Aside from the immediate issue
of ROTC on campus, the
non -violent group plans to
dedicate itself to the elimination
of institutionalized violence
through non-violent tactics. The
University structure, the
Department of Defense, the
government, and other groups
which conduct active and hidden
violence against man and his
environment are targets for
long-range consideration.
Deeper Causes
The group realizes that the
violence stemming from the
off-ROTC conflict is only a
manifestation of the deeper
institutionalized violence in this
country. The members of the
group feel that it will be the
individual's committment to
non-violence which will serve as
the essential tool in reforming this
country's institutionalized
violence.
Petitions are being circulated in
dorms and classes to allow people
to show their support, and
collections are being taken in an
attempt to finance a Daily ad. The
group emphasizes its openess to
students, faculty, and
administrators who believe that
non-violence is the path to
breaking down the violence,
dehumanization, and fear that
exists at Stanford, and invites all
members of the community to
their meeting to be held later this
week.
Following the violent events of
the sit-in last week, two
dormitory groups united to form
what they call "The Non-Violent
Group," which has committed
itself to positive peaceful action in
an effort to resolve political
conflicts.
The Non-Violent Group is an
outgrowth of a group in Toyon
who were circulating a petition
urging non-violent action and
discovered a similar group at work
at Twain House.
The groups got together and
have co-authored a new
document, and a petition now in
circulation.
The petition reads "We do not
condone violence on the part of
individuals of the University, the
police, the student body, or the
community. We particularly
oppose violence by any side in
connection with the off-ROTC
conflict. Wo believe that violence
can be ended only by each
individual's commitment to
non-violence."
The purpose of the petition is
two fold, to get people to commit
themselves to a course of
non-violent action and to get
signatures which will be printed in
a full page statement in the Daily
to indicate community support of
non-violence as a means to
positive political goals.
Active N oil-Violence
The g>*oup feels that
"non-violence when it is non
active is useless" according to its
statement of policy. Although it
feels that a course of action must
be decided by the general
membership of the group to
decide long-range policies, it has
drafted some proposals for
immediate action including a
"mobilization of non-violent
people through talk, statements in
the Daily, meetings so that we
can see how many non-violent
persons there are; reducing

tensions among all groups on
campus by offering food and
songs in an atmosphere of love, to
spread feelings of humanity ; and a
forum on ROTC in which all
people can come and express their
views."
The forum will include all
major interests such as the
off-ROTC movement, the
administration, trustees, and FCM
and will attempt to be free from
coercoin. A mass meeting is

decide on further action.
