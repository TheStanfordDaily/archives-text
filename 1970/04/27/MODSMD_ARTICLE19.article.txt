# Afterwards
## Abandoned Party 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
The Old Union early Saturday
morning had the look of a
slumber party abruptly
abandoned.
Sleeping bags were scattered
through the main lobby in a
variety of wrinkled
configurations. Wine bottles, most
only half emptied, rested in nooks
and crannies on all three floors of
the building.
A full, unopened bottle of Red
Mountain "Vin Rose" stood in
the middle of a cluster of sleeping
bags and notebooks.
A reporter surveying the
abandoned scene had attempted
to walk out with the bottle, only

Yet the building was not empty of
people. There were still the police.
Deputies of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff rested in a coffee
room next to the back entrance of
the Old Union, where they had
come charging through only an
hour or two before. Their riot
visors pulled back over their
heads, they sipped hot coffee with
apparent relief and talked things
over.
In the halls, more deputies (one
with a three foot night stick
dangling from his side) milled
about, surveying the situation.
Aside from the litter and
Off-ROTC posters lying in the
halls, missing doorknobs were also
taken note of by the police.
