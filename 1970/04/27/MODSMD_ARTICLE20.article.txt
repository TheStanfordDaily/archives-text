to be warned by a Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputy that the
police were responsible for
everything in the building, and
nothing was to leave.
Quite plainly, nothing did
leave. The participants in the sit-in
left almost everything behind;not
only their booze, but their
notebooks, books, letters, trash,
posters, and a host of other
personal belongings which they
had no time to carry away or
throw away in the face of the
police blitzkreig.
The lightning speed and
surprise of the police bust was
evidenced by a half-finished post
card left behind; an unfinished
sentence was left hanging by some
interrupted writer. And some of
the more serious students had
apparently not even had time to
close their textbooks.
At 2:30 a.m., it seemed that
almost everything remained from
the sit-in except those who sat in.

It was a pleasure to leave the
Old Union that morning, for it
reminded one of both a ghost
town and an occupied fort. The
sheriffs surrounded Ihe building,
with a heavy presence at the main
entrance. There, hands on their
belt buckles, they stood chatting
amongst themselves with
satisfaction, pausing now and then
to shine their flashlights into the
faces and press cards and driver's
licenses of reporters who wanted
to enter the building.
They stood there with relief
that rocks and broken bottles
were no longer flying at them.
One deputy gazed silently out
at the courtyard, where a few
angry Off-ROTC supporters still
remained, and a KPIX cameraman
looked around foolishly like a
joker who had run out of tricks.
Rut the excitement was gone, and
the police wÂ»>re mostly what
remained. For the time being, the
building was t heirs.
