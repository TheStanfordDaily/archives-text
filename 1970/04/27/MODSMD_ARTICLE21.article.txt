# Yale Students Support Seale; Brewster Doubts 'Fair Trial'
## 
### 
Concern over the Connecticut
murder trial of Bobby Seale has
been demonstrated both by Yale
students and the University's
president, Kingman Brewster.
Half the student body has been
on strike since Wednesday in
protest of injustices in pretrial
proceedings against seven
members of the Black Panther
Party and the University's in
difference to local problems.
Two hundred students
canvassed New Haven Friday in a
"teach out" to explain the strike
and the trial, and to collect
signatures asking for a guaranteed
fair trial. The petition addresses
itself to Senator Abraham√üibicoff
and Connecticut Chief Supreme
Court Justice Louis Shapiro.
Student plans also call for a
huge demonstration on the New
Haven Town Green next weekend

at the time of the trial.
On Thursday, President
Brewster told a special faculty
meeting that he was "skeptical of
the ability of black revolutionaries
to achieve a fair trial anywhere in
the United States." Brewster
stated he believed the condition
"has been created in large part by
police actions and prosecutions
against the Panthers in many parts
of the country."
A Connecticut Superior Court
judge, Herbert Mac Donald, has
charged that through its actions
the University community has
itself caused the difficulty in
conducting a fair trial.
Several groups at Yale have
demanded the immediate release
of the Panthers as a condition of
the strike. Students are making
preparations for a continued
strike, and are providing food,

shelter and first aid for
out-of-towners.
A week ago, Yale Chaplain
William Sloane Coffin stated he
believed that "it was legally right
but morally wrong for this trial to
go forward."



MORE "TRASHING"- Vandals shattered 15 to
18 murr windows in the Durand Building
(Aeronautics and Astronautics) late Saturday
night. Large tinted windows and doors were
broken by thrown rocks and ketchup type bottles
tilled with red paint.
The red paint splattered the windows and
laboratory equipment and student work inside the
building, according to Professor Daniel Bershader,
associate head of Aero-Astro.

"The students' stuff was really disturbed and
damaged," Bershader said. He estimated damage at
between $3000 and $4000. The building has been
the target for rock-throwing related to anti-ROTC
demonstrations in the past few weeks.
Although the building has been patroled by a
night watchman for the last week, the vandals
were not identified. A graduate student heard the
rock-throwing between 12:00 and 1:00 a.m.
Sunday morning and reported it to police.
