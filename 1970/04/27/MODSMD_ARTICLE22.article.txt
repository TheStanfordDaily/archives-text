# View Of Sit-In
## Pitzer Tells Chronology

Chronology of Procedures Followed
April 23 - 24. 1970
1. The sit-in began at approximately 12:45 P.M.
after a short rally in White Memorial Plaza.
Throughout the afternoon, earnest attempts were
made, both on the part of the university and
certain leaders of the sit-in, to keep it as much as
possible non-disruptive and non-violent.
Alternatives were discussed carefully with
members of the Sheriff's office, the faculty
consultative group, and administrators involved.
As a part of this effort, the limits of non-disruptive
activities were defined in writing. This document
was distribued to employees of the Old Union and
to persons involved in the sit-in at about 2 o'clock.

2. Despite these attempts, the situation during
the afternoon teetered on the edge of what could
reasonably be called disruptive action. It was
impossible, for example, for the Office of Student
Accounts to be open and to function normally.
Because of this, because of the presence in the
crowd of a large number of non-students,
including many juveniles, and because of a sizeable
number of persons wearing masks to hide their
identity, it was decided late in the afternoon that
the building would have to be closed at five
o'clock to protect valuable student and financial
records and other property. (Photographers by
formal vote of the demonstrators were barred
from the building, although it was never clear why
such a restriction was needed for a truly
non-violent event.) This was done under the new
interim policy adopted by the SCLC, April 19.
* * *
3. Accordingly, an order was prepared and
distributed closing the building until 8 A.M. the
next morning. It should be noted that the closing
was for the night only, in contrast to the closing of
the ROTC building for 30 days. The possibility of
non-violent, non-disruptive activity the next day
was therefore left open.
* * *
4. Despite this warning, most of the
demonstrators, including a sizeable number of
non-students, remained in the building. As a
consequence, the matter was turned over to the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's office and a second
warning was issued at about 6 P.M. by officers of
that agency. This time it was accompanied by a
clear statement that those who did not leave the
building were violating the law and would be
arrested. The four officers - three uniformed and
one in plainclothes â€” identified themselves and
spoke over the public address system to all of
those in the lobby, then warned students on the
second and third floors.

TO THE STANFORD COMMUNITY:
Because of the rumor and misunderstanding of certain aspects of the
Old Union sit-in which exist on the campus, the following chronology
of procedures has been prepared by my office. I appeal to all members
of the Stanford community to maintain calm in the difficult situation
which we face and to assess the facts carefully and rationally.
K.S. Pitzer, President
April 24, 1970

5. At this point, the decision on how to deal
with these unlawful activities became one for the
responsible police authorities who acted in close
consultation with officers and faculty members of
the University. In part to provide an opportunity
for those who wished to leave to do so, including
many of the juveniles in the group, and in part
because of requirements of mobilizing the
necessary manpower, the Sheriff's office decided
to begin clearing the building at one o'clock.
Arrangements were made accordingly for faculty
and staff observers and for security once the
building was cleared.
* * *
6. During this period, there was a steady
deterioration in the climate of non-violence.
Unknown persons interrupted power service to the
building for approximately 90 minutes, firebombs
were hurled at a building housing several students,
high schoolers scrawled obscenities on numerous
walls and doors with fisticuffs ensuing, and locks
were removed from several doors in the Old
Union.
* * *
7. Many of those who received the previous
warnings were among those who attended a
midnight session at the Old Union at which the
protestors made explicit their plans to leave the
building promptly whenever their scouts informed
them that police were coming, hoping thus to
avoid possible arrest. They also discussed plans to
return and occupy the Old Union early Friday
morning.
* * *
8. During this time, and in view of various kinds
of unlawful activity over three previous weeks, the
Sheriff's office decided not to give any further
notice because of a strong likelihood of more
fruitless games of pursuing fleeing vandals
throughout the campus. The University was
informed of this decision, but once the police are
summoned decisions on how their forces are
deployed and on what time schedule as well as the
issuance of any further warning are entirely in the
hands of Officers of the Sheriff's Department.
* * *
9. At approximately one A.M. Friday, the
Sheriff's detail moved onto the campus for the
purpose of enforcing the law, in their judgment
bringing in the minimum force necessary to make
arrests. No injuries were reported and no one was
known to have been treated at the Stanford
Hospital or at Cowell Student Health Center.
Members of the faculty present inquired of every
person arrested as to personal injury and also
accompanied those arrested to the piaces where
they were officially booked.
