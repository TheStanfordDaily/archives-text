# Liquor License Denied
## 
### 
The Alcoholic Beverage Control
(ABC) hoard last week denied a
request for a faculty club liquor
license but the decision can be
appealed.
"We had anticipated it (the
denial)," Forrest Tregea, manager
of the Faculty Club explained. A
public hearing will probably be
held in the next week or two on
the appeal of the initial decision.
"The appeal hearing is the more
critical thing," Tregea said.
A licensing supervisor in the
ABC San Jose office told the Pnlo
Alio Times the "initial
depart ment decision is made prior
to the public hearing fin the issue,
which hasn't heen set vet. The

decision can be appealed all the
way to the State Supreme Court."
The Faculty Club up until last
fall had kept a room with private
lockers which held liquor supplies.
The ABC ruled in October that
the room was a "public nuisance"
unless the "persons or premises
are licensed."
Therefore the club applied for
the liquor license.
The ABC denied the license
because the Faculty Club doesn't
qualify as a club as the term is
defined under regulations of the
business code of California and
because "the premises are within
the immediate vicinity of a
school."
Peter Sexton, a deputy

director, also wrote that the
selling of alcoholic beverages to
faculty members during teaching
hours "will interfere with and
limit the academic effectiveness of
the said faculty members."
Tregea explained that if the
license had been granted there
probably would have been an
appeal made by opponents of the
license. The only difference
between now and before the
license was issued, he continued,
is that now "the burden of .the
appeal is on us."
"Unless we can overcome the
objections we will not get the
license" but "we feel we have a
case and we will present it,"
TVepea concluded.
