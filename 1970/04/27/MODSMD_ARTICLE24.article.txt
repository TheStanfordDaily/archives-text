# Films In Preview
## Bogart, Chaplin In Movie Classics 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
The film that caused Shirley
Temple Black to resign from the
board of directors of the San
Francisco Film Festival, Mai
Zetterling's 'bold and bizarre'
"Night Games" will be shown
Tuesday evening at 7, 9, and 1 1 in
Memorial Auditorium by Beta
Chi.
Perenniel Problems
Miss Zetterling, who appeared
in Bergman's "Smiles of a
Summer Night" and employed
Bergman's cameraman Rune
Ericson in "Night Games," chose
the timeless topics of decadence
and impotence for her third
directorial effort.
Jan (Keve Hjelm) returns to the
castle of his youth to reflect on
the problems that prevent him
Irom having a normal sexual
relationship with his wife. In
flashback, he sees "his mother
Irene (Ingrid Thulin) at anorgiastic
party giving birth to a dead child
to the accompaniment of a jazz
ensemble and a recitation on the
birth of Christ.
Among other things, he
remembers the "unhealthy"
relationship which developed
between him and his mother. Jan
returns to the castle to literally
vomit up his past and blow up the
building that contained his
childhood memories and
presumably was the block to his
potency. "Night Games" is a sick
Freudian joke that Mrs. Black
took too seriously.
If you don't find any
redeeming social value in "Night
Games," Clive Miller will be
showing "Across the Pacific" at 8
and at 10 in Geology 320 the
same evening. Directed by John
Huston, this 1942 war film stars
Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor,
Sydney Greenstreet and Charles
Halton.
The Committee for Art at
Stanford will present
"Civilisation," a film series
narrated by Lord Kenneth Clark.
The history of Western man, his
art, architecture, music, poetry,
and philosophy during the High
Renaissance will be revealed at

1:30 this Tuesday in the lecture
room of the Art Building.
Wednesday, the Contemporary
Cinema Society will present a
special revival of Charlie Chaplin's
classic film "The Great Dictator"
at 7:30 and 9:30 in Cubberley.
The first program of the second

Kinetic Art series did not arrive
on time last week, so it will be
shown this Wednesday at 7:30
and 9:30 in Bishop Auditorium,
located on the ground level of the
Business School. Among the eight
short experimental films being
shown are Cocteau's "Egypte, O

Egypte," Stan Vanderbeek's
computer-made film "Poem Field
Number 1," and Len Glaser's
"The Joint."
Drab Truth
The International Student
Association will show Pier Paolo
Pasolini's "Gospel According to

St. Matthew" at 7:45 in
Cubberley. Pasoli, the
controversial Communist poet and
film director ("Accatone," "The
Hawks and the Sparrows,"
"Teorema") dedicated his film to
"the dear and familiar memory of
John XXIII." "Gospel According
to St. Matthew" has been
described as powerful, static and
criticized for mistaking drabness
for purity and truth.
Also on Thursday, the Stanford
Community Against War and
Fascism will present Robert
Rossen's "All the Kings Men"
starring Broderick Crawford at 8
in Bishop Auditorium. Rossen,
always trying to say more than his
technique can express, includes
among his efforts "Body and
Soul," "The Hustler," and
"Lilith."
As part of the program "Off
the Pigs" will be shown, a short
distributed by News Reel Films,
an organization which, "through a
common bond with political
organizations throughout the
world, is working to expand the
awareness of events and situations
relevant to shaping the future of
the (revolutionary) movement.
Our films try to analyze, not just
cover, and they explore realities
that the media, as part of the
system, always ignores." See
reality as the revolutionaries
would have you perceive it, every
Thursday and Friday when
SCAWF present the Noonreel
Series at 12 p.m. in Tresidder
Union.
"All propaganda has to be
popular and has to adapt its
spiritual level to the perception of
the least intelligent of those
towards whom it intends to direct
itself. "â€”Adolph Hitler.
