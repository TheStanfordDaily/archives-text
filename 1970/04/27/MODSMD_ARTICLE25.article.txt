# Cuckoo's Nest' Now On Stage
## 
### NEIL ARNET 
Last Wednesday night Ken
Kesey's "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" opened at the
Little Fox Theatre in San
Francisco. The play, which was
written by Dale Wasserman who
also wrote "Man of La Mancha,"
brings to the stage much of both
the humor and sadness of Kesey's
book. More importantly, the play
works by itself.
Unfortunately, the worst part
of the play is the first fifteen
minutes which drag terribly. Chief
Bromden, the huge deaf and
dumb indian, enters first. Through
the use of slides shown upon the
back wall of the room of the
mental hospital and his voice
coming out of speakers at the
back and sides of the theatre, the
audience gets inside the mind of
the Chief. The three aides enter
and rough up the Chief. Then
Nurse Ratched, that is, Big Nurse,

enters. She calls for the entrance
of the other patients. Next Randle
Patrick McMurphy gets admitted,
and the play at this point seems
ready to start moving. However,
not until after a rather contrived
group meeting of Nurse Ratched,
Dr. Spivey, and the patients does
the play quicken its pace.
In Motion
But once the play begins to
move, it does so rapidly.
McMurphy determines to beat
Nurse Ratched —to "stick a burr
up her bloomers"—and the fun
has started.
McMurphy gambles. He jokes
and he teases all the way to the
end of the first act. At one point
he comes out of the shower
wearing only a towel, an action
which is against the rules. So he
whips off the towel to reveal his
black undershorts with the two
big, white whales.
At another point he discovers

that Chief Bromden isn't deaf.
Finally, at the end of this act,
Mc Murphy confronts Nurse
Ratched concerning the right to
watch the World Series games in
the afternoon.
The second and final act
continues the pace which ended
the first. McMurphy discovers that
Nurse Ratched has the power to
keep him committed for "years."
But, because of his growing
friendship with Chief Bromden,
he continues his battle with the
woman. There's an excellent scene
in which Chief Bromden begins to
talk to McMurphy, describing his
father and mother and how his
father sold the land of his tribe.
And then there's the party.
Two of McMurphy's old
girlfriends, one of whom has come
to break the cherry of Billy
"Club" Bibbit, sneak into the
hospital carrying several bottles of
booze. The party wails until Nurse

Ratched walks in. Her cruel
treatment of Billy Bibbit sets up
the end of the play.
Roles
In general "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" is quite good and
the acting is well done. For the
actors there exists the problem of
playing "types" and bringing
them to life, but they do it well,
particularly the patients. Drew
Eshelman as the intellectual and
effeminant Dale Harding who
feels inferior because of his wife's
"big knockers" gives an excellent
performance.
Billy Bibbit, the good-looking
young man who stumbles and
stutters, also was very impressive,
especially in his last encounter
with Nurse Ratched. The perhaps
little noticed role of Ruckly, a
chronic patient who essentially
just grunts and spits up, came off
well too.
In fact, the only role which
didn't come off well for me was
that of Nurse Ratched. She had
the cruelty; yet, she didn't seem
the impregnable fortress. Nurse
Ratched didn't act much meaner
than any mean nurse.
Perhaps the greatest objection I
have to Jo DeWinter's portrayal of
Big Nurse is that she didn't look
like Big Nurse. I have to admit
that I had a picture in my mind of
Big Nurse from having read
Kesey's book. And JoDeWinter
was both a little too young and
too attractive to be that person.
Actors Suited
In contrast to Nurse Ratched
who didn't meet my expectations,
Chief Bromden met them
perfectly. John Garber, who plays
the Chief, is a big, powerfully
built man, who manages to appear
a weak, catatonic, broken Indian.
Until he unwittingly reveals to
McMurphy that he can hear and
then that he can speak, the Chief
is seen either standing alone
thinking or sitting low in a chair.
In the two scenes in which he
and McMurphy are alone, Garber
is exactly the Chief Bromden of
the book. His low, quiet, pained
voice seems perfectly suited to the
huge indian who has suffered so
much.
And then there's McMurphy.
I'm not quite sure if Fredric Cook
is the Randle Patrick McMurphy
of the printed page, but it doesn't
matter, for he's great. Enter one
big, rough and tough, smiling,
laughing, gamblin' man into the
war of a state mental hospital and
you've got McMurphy.
Whether he's playing cards with
Harding, Bibbit, and the
hallucinating Martini, or singing
funny songs in the shower, or
even cleaning the windows of the
nurses' station, McMurphy's
deliberately having one helluva
good time just to show everyone
how to have one. More
importantly, he shows the other
patients that they can stand up to
Nurse Ratched.
Summing up, "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest" is a well done,
enjoyable play. Those who have
read Ken Kesey's book will
appreciate how closely the play
follows the book. Those who
haven't read it will like the play
also.

"big knockers" gives an excellent
performance.
Billy Bibbit, the good-looking
young man who stumbles and
stutters, also was very impressive,
especially in his last encounter
with Nurse Ratched. The perhaps
little noticed role of Ruckly, a
chronic patient who essentially
just grunts and spits up, came off
well too.
In fact, the only role which
didn't come off well for me was
that of Nurse Ratched. She had
the cruelty; yet, she didn't seem
the impregnable fortress. Nurse
Ratched didn't act much meaner
than any mean nurse.
Perhaps the greatest objection I
have to Jo DeWinter's portrayal of
Big Nurse is that she didn't look
like Big Nurse. I have to admit
that I had a picture in my mind of
Big Nurse from having read
Kesey's book. And JoDeWinter
was both a little too young and
too attractive to be that person.
Actors Suited
In contrast to Nurse Ratched
who didn't meet my expectations,
Chief Bromden met them
perfectly. John Garber, who plays
the Chief, is a big, powerfully
built man, who manages to appear
a weak, catatonic, broken Indian.
Until he unwittingly reveals to
McMurphy that he can hear and
then that he can speak, the Chief
is seen either standing alone
thinking or sitting low in a chair.
In the two scenes in which he
and McMurphy are alone, Garber
is exactly the Chief Bromden of
the book. His low, quiet, pained
voice seems perfectly suited to the
huge indian who has suffered so
much.
And then there's McMurphy.
I'm not quite sure if Fredric Cook
is the Randle Patrick McMurphy
of the printed page, but it doesn't
matter, for he's great. Enter one
big, rough and tough, smiling,
laughing, gamblin' man into the
war of a state mental hospital and
you've got McMurphy.
Whether he's playing cards with
Harding, Bibbit, and the
hallucinating Martini, or singing
funny songs in the shower, or
even cleaning the windows of the
nurses' station, McMurphy's
deliberately having one helluva
good time just to show everyone
how to have one. More
importantly, he shows the other
patients that they can stand up to
Nurse Ratched.
Summing up, "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest" is a well done,
enjoyable play. Those who have
read Ken Kesey's book will
appreciate how closely the play
follows the book. Those who
haven't read it will like the play
also.
Last Wednesday night Ken
Kesey's "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" opened at the
Little Fox Theatre in San
Francisco. The play, which was
written by Dale Wasserman who
also wrote "Man of La Mancha,"
brings to the stage much of both
the humor and sadness of Kesey's
book. More importantly, the play
works by itself.
Unfortunately, the worst part
of the play is the first fifteen
minutes which drag terribly. Chief
Bromden, the huge deaf and
dumb indian, enters first. Through
the use of slides shown upon the
back wall of the room of the
mental hospital and his voice
coming out of speakers at the
back and sides of the theatre, the
audience gets inside the mind of
the Chief. The three aides enter
and rough up the Chief. Then
Nurse Ratched, that is, Big Nurse,

enters. She calls for the entrance
of the other patients. Next Randle
Patrick McMurphy gets admitted,
and the play at this point seems
ready to start moving. However,
not until after a rather contrived
group meeting of Nurse Ratched,
Dr. Spivey, and the patients does
the play quicken its pace.
In Motion
But once the play begins to
move, it does so rapidly.
McMurphy determines to beat
Nurse Ratched —to "stick a burr
up her bloomers"—and the fun
has started.
McMurphy gambles. He jokes
and he teases all the way to the
end of the first act. At one point
he comes out of the shower
wearing only a towel, an action
which is against the rules. So he
whips off the towel to reveal his
black undershorts with the two
big, white whales.
At another point he discovers

that Chief Bromden isn't deaf.
Finally, at the end of this act,
Mc Murphy confronts Nurse
Ratched concerning the right to
watch the World Series games in
the afternoon.
The second and final act
continues the pace which ended
the first. McMurphy discovers that
Nurse Ratched has the power to
keep him committed for "years."
But, because of his growing
friendship with Chief Bromden,
he continues his battle with the
woman. There's an excellent scene
in which Chief Bromden begins to
talk to McMurphy, describing his
father and mother and how his
father sold the land of his tribe.
And then there's the party.
Two of McMurphy's old
girlfriends, one of whom has come
to break the cherry of Billy
"Club" Bibbit, sneak into the
hospital carrying several bottles of
booze. The party wails until Nurse

Ratched walks in. Her cruel
treatment of Billy Bibbit sets up
the end of the play.
Roles
In general "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" is quite good and
the acting is well done. For the
actors there exists the problem of
playing "types" and bringing
them to life, but they do it well,
particularly the patients. Drew
Eshelman as the intellectual and
effeminant Dale Harding who
feels inferior because of his wife's
"big knockers" gives an excellent

Bromden, the huge deaf and
dumb indian, enters first. Through
the use of slides shown upon the
back wall of the room of the
mental hospital and his voice
coming out of speakers at the
back and sides of the theatre, the
audience gets inside the mind of
the Chief. The three aides enter
and rough up the Chief. Then
Nurse Ratched, that is, Big Nurse,

enters. She calls for the entrance
of the other patients. Next Randle
Patrick McMurphy gets admitted,
and the play at this point seems
ready to start moving. However,
not until after a rather contrived
group meeting of Nurse Ratched,
Dr. Spivey, and the patients does
the play quicken its pace.
In Motion
But once the play begins to
move, it does so rapidly.
McMurphy determines to beat
Nurse Ratched —to "stick a burr
up her bloomers"—and the fun
has started.
McMurphy gambles. He jokes
and he teases all the way to the
end of the first act. At one point
he comes out of the shower
wearing only a towel, an action
which is against the rules. So he
whips off the towel to reveal his
black undershorts with the two
big, white whales.
At another point he discovers

that Chief Bromden isn't deaf.
Finally, at the end of this act,
Mc Murphy confronts Nurse
Ratched concerning the right to
watch the World Series games in
the afternoon.
The second and final act
continues the pace which ended
the first. McMurphy discovers that
Nurse Ratched has the power to
keep him committed for "years."
But, because of his growing
friendship with Chief Bromden,
he continues his battle with the
woman. There's an excellent scene
in which Chief Bromden begins to
talk to McMurphy, describing his
father and mother and how his
father sold the land of his tribe.
And then there's the party.
Two of McMurphy's old
girlfriends, one of whom has come
to break the cherry of Billy
"Club" Bibbit, sneak into the
hospital carrying several bottles of
booze. The party wails until Nurse

Ratched walks in. Her cruel
treatment of Billy Bibbit sets up
the end of the play.
Roles
In general "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" is quite good and
the acting is well done. For the
actors there exists the problem of
playing "types" and bringing
them to life, but they do it well,
particularly the patients. Drew
Eshelman as the intellectual and
effeminant Dale Harding who
feels inferior because of his wife's
"big knockers" gives an excellent
performance.
Billy Bibbit, the good-looking
young man who stumbles and
stutters, also was very impressive,
especially in his last encounter
with Nurse Ratched. The perhaps
little noticed role of Ruckly, a
chronic patient who essentially
just grunts and spits up, came off
well too.
In fact, the only role which
didn't come off well for me was
that of Nurse Ratched. She had
the cruelty; yet, she didn't seem
the impregnable fortress. Nurse
Ratched didn't act much meaner
than any mean nurse.
Perhaps the greatest objection I
have to Jo DeWinter's portrayal of
Big Nurse is that she didn't look
like Big Nurse. I have to admit
that I had a picture in my mind of
Big Nurse from having read
Kesey's book. And JoDeWinter
was both a little too young and
too attractive to be that person.
Actors Suited
In contrast to Nurse Ratched
who didn't meet my expectations,
Chief Bromden met them
perfectly. John Garber, who plays
the Chief, is a big, powerfully
built man, who manages to appear
a weak, catatonic, broken Indian.
Until he unwittingly reveals to
McMurphy that he can hear and
then that he can speak, the Chief
is seen either standing alone
thinking or sitting low in a chair.
In the two scenes in which he
and McMurphy are alone, Garber
is exactly the Chief Bromden of
the book. His low, quiet, pained
voice seems perfectly suited to the
huge indian who has suffered so
much.
And then there's McMurphy.
I'm not quite sure if Fredric Cook
is the Randle Patrick McMurphy
of the printed page, but it doesn't
matter, for he's great. Enter one
big, rough and tough, smiling,
laughing, gamblin' man into the
war of a state mental hospital and
you've got McMurphy.
Whether he's playing cards with
Harding, Bibbit, and the
hallucinating Martini, or singing
funny songs in the shower, or
even cleaning the windows of the
nurses' station, McMurphy's
deliberately having one helluva
good time just to show everyone
how to have one. More
importantly, he shows the other
patients that they can stand up to
Nurse Ratched.
Summing up, "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest" is a well done,
enjoyable play. Those who have
read Ken Kesey's book will
appreciate how closely the play
follows the book. Those who
haven't read it will like the play
also.
Last Wednesday night Ken
Kesey's "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" opened at the
Little Fox Theatre in San
Francisco. The play, which was
written by Dale Wasserman who
also wrote "Man of La Mancha,"
brings to the stage much of both
the humor and sadness of Kesey's
book. More importantly, the play
works by itself.
