# 'Fortune' Revisited
## Prison Play In Poor Revival 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
"Fortune and Men's Eyes" which opened last
week at the Committee Theater in San Francisco is
a mediocre production of a better than average
play. Sal Mineo, one-time teen-age movie idol, has
taken John Herbert's play about the degrading life
of the Canadian prison system, moved the setting
to a "Boys' Prison," presumably in New York,
changed the ending, played up the more obvious
and vulgar aspects of the original, and passed it off
as something new and exciting in the theater.
According to Mr. Mineo's credits in the
program, this is apparently his first professional
venture in live theater, and that may explain a lot
of the problems in this production.
The play is about a boy who is sent to prison
for six months and finds that he has been
incarcerated in a homosexual hell hole. His first
night he is raped by another prisoner, a not
uncommon occurrance. The prison authorities are
brutal, arbitrary and corrupt; the prisoners are
desparately clinging to their sanity, trying not to
be reduced to the level of animals. My reaction to
seeing the original production of this play several
years ago was that, whatever else may happen to
me, I would never allow myself to be sent to
prison.
Irony
Mr. Mineo has managed to dilute the punch of
the original production. What is ironic is that he
has done this through a misguided attempt to
make the play more realistic and more powerful.
But Mr. Mineo took the Hollywood approach to
realism: He has left little to the imagination, and
what was truly horrible by implication is now
merely true by observation.
The play is no longer realistic—it is literal. The
set is a representation of a cell in a prison
(probably the roomiest cell in any prison in the
world). It has real beds with real bedsprings, real
bars and real doors that open and close (so far so
good!); it also has a real toilet, a real shower room
with real working showers, presumably with hot
and cold running water so that the actors aren't
frozen or scalded at a critical moment. Mr. Mineo's
characters curse, scratch, retch, masterbate,
shower, fondle and bleed, all before your very
eyes.
This works fine in the movies, but the stage is
something else again. You can't really get away
with literalness on stage, simply because it is a
stage. The audience is always aware that they are
watching actors portraying real people. The ability
to suspend disbelief is not unlimited, and
literalness can extend it just so far.

When Mr. Mineo stages a homosexual rape in
the shower room, full stage, with naked actors, it
admittedly has a certain power and shock value;
but you and I and everyone else in the theater
knows that no one is really being raped, and since
for dramatic purposes the whole thing can't take
more than fifteen or twenty seconds, Mr. Mineo is
forced to compromise his literalness, and the
effect is diluted and a trifle dishonest.
Technically the production is quite impressive.
The cast is well rehearsed, the staging is exciting,
the acting is excellent. James Wigfall has the
tlashiest role as Queenie, the queer who describes
herself (!) as "one tough bitch." He preens and
primps, unashamed of his homosexuality,
apparently enjoying being trapped in a building
with all those men, endlessly playing the politician
to get what he wants. Mr. Wigfall has a fine comic
sense, and succeeds beautifully in making Queenie
both charming and frightening at the same time.
Robert Curtin plays Rocky, the prisoner who
makes his living as a 42nd Street pimp when he's
out ol the jig, he is tough, brutal, and stupid; his
hobby is chess. He hates fags and faggotry, but like
everyone else in the prison, he is actively engaged
in homosexual activity. Mr. Curtin's performance
is hard and uncompromising and very effective.
Dignity
Eric Pierce makes his professional stage debut as
Mona, the sensitive boy who is the punk for the
cell block. Mona is not a homosexual, but he is
frail and effeminate, so he is raped, beaten and
abused incessently by the other prisoners. The
cure for Mona's problem would be for him to find
an Old Man who would claim him as exclusive
property and protect him from the others. But
Mona is too proud; he prefers to sacrifice the
dignity of his body to preserve the dignity of his
mind. Mr. Pierce has made a very impressive first
showing, and should go on to better things.
Tom Reese plays the guard, a marine-sergeant
type who provides a sharp contrast for the other
characters. He is quiet, deliberate and tough.
Courtney Burr plays Smitty, the central
character, the star as it. were, lie has the most
trying acting job because Smitty must
mctamporphose from innocent kid to tough queer,
and Mr. Burr must, make us believe in him as a
character. He does, sort of, but it's a much
shallower character than we would have liked to
see. Blame t his on Mr. Mineo's staging—Smit ty was
a lot more interesting before Mr. Mineo tampered
with the script.
In fact, so was the rest of the play.

The play is no longer realistic—it is literal. The
set is a representation of a cell in a prison
(probably the roomiest cell in any prison in the
world). It has real beds with real bedsprings, real
bars and real doors that open and close (so far so
good!); it also has a real toilet, a real shower room
with real working showers, presumably with hot
and cold running water so that the actors aren't
frozen or scalded at a critical moment. Mr. Mineo's
characters curse, scratch, retch, masterbate,
shower, fondle and bleed, all before your very
eyes.
This works fine in the movies, but the stage is
something else again. You can't really get away
with literalness on stage, simply because it is a
stage. The audience is always aware that they are
watching actors portraying real people. The ability
to suspend disbelief is not unlimited, and
literalness can extend it just so far.

When Mr. Mineo stages a homosexual rape in
the shower room, full stage, with naked actors, it
admittedly has a certain power and shock value;
but you and I and everyone else in the theater
knows that no one is really being raped, and since
for dramatic purposes the whole thing can't take
more than fifteen or twenty seconds, Mr. Mineo is
forced to compromise his literalness, and the
effect is diluted and a trifle dishonest.
Technically the production is quite impressive.
The cast is well rehearsed, the staging is exciting,
the acting is excellent. James Wigfall has the
tlashiest role as Queenie, the queer who describes
herself (!) as "one tough bitch." He preens and
primps, unashamed of his homosexuality,
apparently enjoying being trapped in a building
with all those men, endlessly playing the politician
to get what he wants. Mr. Wigfall has a fine comic
sense, and succeeds beautifully in making Queenie
both charming and frightening at the same time.
Robert Curtin plays Rocky, the prisoner who
makes his living as a 42nd Street pimp when he's
out ol the jig, he is tough, brutal, and stupid; his
hobby is chess. He hates fags and faggotry, but like
everyone else in the prison, he is actively engaged
in homosexual activity. Mr. Curtin's performance
is hard and uncompromising and very effective.
Dignity
Eric Pierce makes his professional stage debut as
Mona, the sensitive boy who is the punk for the
cell block. Mona is not a homosexual, but he is
frail and effeminate, so he is raped, beaten and
abused incessently by the other prisoners. The
cure for Mona's problem would be for him to find
an Old Man who would claim him as exclusive
property and protect him from the others. But
Mona is too proud; he prefers to sacrifice the
dignity of his body to preserve the dignity of his
mind. Mr. Pierce has made a very impressive first
showing, and should go on to better things.
Tom Reese plays the guard, a marine-sergeant
type who provides a sharp contrast for the other
characters. He is quiet, deliberate and tough.
Courtney Burr plays Smitty, the central
character, the star as it. were, lie has the most
trying acting job because Smitty must
mctamporphose from innocent kid to tough queer,
and Mr. Burr must, make us believe in him as a
character. He does, sort of, but it's a much
shallower character than we would have liked to
see. Blame t his on Mr. Mineo's staging—Smit ty was
a lot more interesting before Mr. Mineo tampered
with the script.
In fact, so was the rest of the play.
"Fortune and Men's Eyes" which opened last
week at the Committee Theater in San Francisco is
a mediocre production of a better than average
play. Sal Mineo, one-time teen-age movie idol, has
taken John Herbert's play about the degrading life
of the Canadian prison system, moved the setting
to a "Boys' Prison," presumably in New York,
changed the ending, played up the more obvious
and vulgar aspects of the original, and passed it off
as something new and exciting in the theater.
According to Mr. Mineo's credits in the
program, this is apparently his first professional
venture in live theater, and that may explain a lot
of the problems in this production.
The play is about a boy who is sent to prison
for six months and finds that he has been
incarcerated in a homosexual hell hole. His first
night he is raped by another prisoner, a not
uncommon occurrance. The prison authorities are
brutal, arbitrary and corrupt; the prisoners are
desparately clinging to their sanity, trying not to
be reduced to the level of animals. My reaction to
seeing the original production of this play several
years ago was that, whatever else may happen to
me, I would never allow myself to be sent to
prison.
Irony
Mr. Mineo has managed to dilute the punch of
the original production. What is ironic is that he
has done this through a misguided attempt to
make the play more realistic and more powerful.
But Mr. Mineo took the Hollywood approach to
realism: He has left little to the imagination, and
what was truly horrible by implication is now
merely true by observation.

herself (!) as "one tough bitch." He preens and
primps, unashamed of his homosexuality,
apparently enjoying being trapped in a building
with all those men, endlessly playing the politician
to get what he wants. Mr. Wigfall has a fine comic
sense, and succeeds beautifully in making Queenie
both charming and frightening at the same time.
Robert Curtin plays Rocky, the prisoner who
makes his living as a 42nd Street pimp when he's
out ol the jig, he is tough, brutal, and stupid; his
hobby is chess. He hates fags and faggotry, but like
everyone else in the prison, he is actively engaged
in homosexual activity. Mr. Curtin's performance
is hard and uncompromising and very effective.
Dignity
Eric Pierce makes his professional stage debut as
Mona, the sensitive boy who is the punk for the
cell block. Mona is not a homosexual, but he is
frail and effeminate, so he is raped, beaten and
abused incessently by the other prisoners. The
cure for Mona's problem would be for him to find
an Old Man who would claim him as exclusive
property and protect him from the others. But
Mona is too proud; he prefers to sacrifice the
dignity of his body to preserve the dignity of his
mind. Mr. Pierce has made a very impressive first
showing, and should go on to better things.
Tom Reese plays the guard, a marine-sergeant
type who provides a sharp contrast for the other
characters. He is quiet, deliberate and tough.
Courtney Burr plays Smitty, the central
character, the star as it. were, lie has the most
trying acting job because Smitty must
mctamporphose from innocent kid to tough queer,
and Mr. Burr must, make us believe in him as a
character. He does, sort of, but it's a much
shallower character than we would have liked to
see. Blame t his on Mr. Mineo's staging—Smit ty was
a lot more interesting before Mr. Mineo tampered
with the script.
In fact, so was the rest of the play.
"Fortune and Men's Eyes" which opened last
week at the Committee Theater in San Francisco is
a mediocre production of a better than average
play. Sal Mineo, one-time teen-age movie idol, has
taken John Herbert's play about the degrading life
of the Canadian prison system, moved the setting
to a "Boys' Prison," presumably in New York,
changed the ending, played up the more obvious
and vulgar aspects of the original, and passed it off
as something new and exciting in the theater.
According to Mr. Mineo's credits in the
program, this is apparently his first professional
venture in live theater, and that may explain a lot
of the problems in this production.
The play is about a boy who is sent to prison
for six months and finds that he has been
incarcerated in a homosexual hell hole. His first
night he is raped by another prisoner, a not
uncommon occurrance. The prison authorities are
brutal, arbitrary and corrupt; the prisoners are
desparately clinging to their sanity, trying not to
be reduced to the level of animals. My reaction to
seeing the original production of this play several
years ago was that, whatever else may happen to
me, I would never allow myself to be sent to
prison.
Irony
Mr. Mineo has managed to dilute the punch of
the original production. What is ironic is that he
has done this through a misguided attempt to
make the play more realistic and more powerful.
But Mr. Mineo took the Hollywood approach to
realism: He has left little to the imagination, and
what was truly horrible by implication is now
merely true by observation.
The play is no longer realistic—it is literal. The
set is a representation of a cell in a prison
(probably the roomiest cell in any prison in the
world). It has real beds with real bedsprings, real
bars and real doors that open and close (so far so
good!); it also has a real toilet, a real shower room
with real working showers, presumably with hot
and cold running water so that the actors aren't
frozen or scalded at a critical moment. Mr. Mineo's
characters curse, scratch, retch, masterbate,
shower, fondle and bleed, all before your very
eyes.
This works fine in the movies, but the stage is
something else again. You can't really get away
with literalness on stage, simply because it is a
stage. The audience is always aware that they are
watching actors portraying real people. The ability
to suspend disbelief is not unlimited, and
literalness can extend it just so far.

When Mr. Mineo stages a homosexual rape in
the shower room, full stage, with naked actors, it
admittedly has a certain power and shock value;
but you and I and everyone else in the theater
knows that no one is really being raped, and since
for dramatic purposes the whole thing can't take
more than fifteen or twenty seconds, Mr. Mineo is
forced to compromise his literalness, and the
effect is diluted and a trifle dishonest.
Technically the production is quite impressive.
The cast is well rehearsed, the staging is exciting,
the acting is excellent. James Wigfall has the
tlashiest role as Queenie, the queer who describes
herself (!) as "one tough bitch." He preens and
primps, unashamed of his homosexuality,
apparently enjoying being trapped in a building
with all those men, endlessly playing the politician
to get what he wants. Mr. Wigfall has a fine comic
