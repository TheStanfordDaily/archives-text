# Krips Baton Back
## 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Maestro Josel Krips returned to the Opera House Wednesday
evening, back from a highly lauded guest conducting tour which took
him around the world, to lead the Symphony in a remarkably
successful program of three Beethoven works. Leaving his Prussian
baton at home, Maestro Krips delivered relaxed introspections of the
"Overture to Corialanus," the "Symphony No. 6" and the "Piano
Concerto No. 3."
Capitulation
Corialanus is based on the tragic story of how that Roman
general was dissuaded from justified wrath upon a city by the kneeling
pleas of his mother. Although the concept of motherhood has lost
some of its lustre in recent overpopulated years, the story wa.j quite
popular in earlier times.
Beethoven identified with the burdener soldier, and wrote the
overture for a play by von Collins. The music was intended to
represent the anguish of decision-making, a torture Beethoven was all
too familiar with.
Maestro Krips did some spring cleaning, and moved the string
sections around for these pieces. The violas occupied the front of the
stage across from the first violins, while the celli moved back into the
orchestra. This was a wise decision, for the evening at least, since these
works have essential viola lines which tend to get muffled in the
morass of musicians. The deep string line came through clearly, and
we all got a better view of Mary Claudio in addition.
Eden Anthem
The long-awaited "Pastorale" followed the overture. This dnunatic
piece was written by Beethoven simultaneously with the highly
charged "Fifth Symphony," perhaps as a calming release for the
passions built up while composing. Beethoven would tend to work on
one symphony and then the other as temperament and tension
dictated.
The Symphony No. 6 attempts to incorporate the nineteenth
century s attraction to nature-imitating works into a more valid
musical frame. Composers were painting Andrew Wyeths while
Beethoven was working on Rembrandts. Although the feeling for
fields and fauns is present in the "Sixth," it does not overwhelm the
musicality of the piece. In Beethoven's hands, even Pan's pipe plays
masterpieces.
Maestro Krips version ol the "Pastorale" this year was a lush,
graceful one, fully in the spirit in which it was composed. The verdant
setting was interrupted only occasionally by the expectation of an
error by the horn section, which thankfully was an infrequent
occurrence.
Flam boyance
Gary Graffman has an impressive flair at the piano. In Beethoven's
"Piano Concerto No. 3," Mr. Graffman showed that there is
considerable musicianship behind his showmanship. Sensitive and
delicate in the Mozartian cadenzas, Mr. Graffman could explode into
the full-keyboard single-hand arpeggios or tease out the humorous
dissonances. Beautifully coordinated with the conductor, Mr.
Graffman's timing was impeccable. He and Maestro Krips were
perfectly together, and the orchestra was never far behind.
