## ROTC Sit-Ins, Strikes 
### 
Oregon Sit-In
A strike Friday demanding the
removal of ROTC at the
University of Oregon resulted in
attendance ranging from normal
to one third.
The strike was declared and
supported by the University's
student senate following 61
arrests Thursday in an
administration building sit-in. The
two day sit-in was broken up on
order of university president
Robert Clark. Clark appeared on
campus closed-circuit television,
and making no mention of
student demands, he offered to
discuss the issues with students.
Clark referred to the sit-in
tactic as "the determination of a

small number of students to settle
the issues by violence and force."
Beyond the elimination of
ROTC, demands included repeal
of a law allowing the governor to
call the National Guard on
campus, the creation of a
faculty-student senate with
complete control of the
University, and amnesty for
arrested protestors.
Penn State
A strike of Pennsylvania State
University's 48,000 students has
been proposed in response to
summary suspension powers
granted to administrators.
President Eric Walker and his
deputies were granted power by
the trustees to "summarily

suspend any student who, in their
judgment, engages in disruptive or
destructive activity."
The strike will be the first
centralized action since mobile,
decentralized militant protests
began April 15.
Suspended students at Penn
State may not enter the campus
until after their hearing, which
could result in expulsion.
Hawaii ROTC
Two hundred students and
faculty occupied the Air Force
ROTC building Friday to
reinforce the demand for the
removal of ROTC at the
University of Hawaii. Although
President Harlan Cleveland
warned the protestors they faced
arrest on charges of criminal
trespass, sixty people remained
inside the building.
Before police action can be
taken, however, the Honolulu
magistrate's court must rule
whether to issue arrest warrants or
penal summonses.
The occupation occurred
shortly after a public discussion of
the Chicago conspiracy trial by
Jerry Rubin and David Dellinger.
Ohio State
Demands including the end of
ROTC were presented by 400
protestors to the administration
of Ohio State in a peaceful march
Friday.
The list of ten demands also
included the end of war research
on campus, recruitment of black
students until they constitute 23
percent of the student body,
equal faculty-student
representation on departmental
committees, the dismissal of three
administrators, and"the repeal of
all University rules which have a
'chilling' effect on free speech."
Ten fires have been reported on
the University of Pennsylvania
campus since Wednesday night.
Nine of them are believed to be
arson, although they are not
connected with any protest.
In addition, the campus has
been plagued with bomb scares;
four of them occurred Thursday
night.
I*etm Fires
The latest fire occurred
Saturday morning and was
believed to have been started by a
firebomb tossed through a second
floor window into an office.
Another blaze Saturday was
discovered in an administration
building storage closet.
Police have seized two suspects,
whose identities have not yet been
made available.
