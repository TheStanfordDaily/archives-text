# Center Sponsors Student Programs
## 
### LAURIE HORN 
Interested in doing research on
how to set up an FM radio
station? Want to do fieldwork but
don't know where to go?
The new Student Center for
Innovation and Research has
pulled itself out of a puddle of
winter confusion and is now at
work on programs with the
student in mind.
The center has as its goal the
promotion of greater student
initiative in course design and
creation of independent projects.
Six students and five faculty
members have been nominated by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies to serve as the Center's
Policy Board.
The Board has already begun
considering giving credit for such
varied student-initiated projects as
cancer research and the History of
the Telephone Utilities in
California.
This week the board will
announce the name of its new
director—chosen from among 22
students who applied. The
director will move as soon as
possible into the old offices of the
department of Art and
Architecture: basement, Men's
Clubhouse.
The purpose of the Center for
Innovation is double, according to
Joyce Kobayashi, member of the
past year's ASSU Council of
Presidents. At the institutional
level, the Center will help
interested students to design new
curricula and/or to create
extra-departmental courses. For
example, it will probably become
a clearing house for new courses
in Urban Studies and
Asian-American Studies.
On the individual level, it will
direct students to sympathetic
faculty members or interested
outside people who would be
willing to sponsor projects such as
the FM radio research, or directed
reading in a non-departmental
area. Once the sponsor is found,
the Center is authorized by the
CUS to grant Undergraduate
Special credit (Pass-Fail, no
recognition for major).
Independent Work
This kind of "matching-up"
service will be a principal
responsibility of the new director.
At present, few students other
than honors students or students

with appropriate faculty contacts
have an opportunity to do
independent work. Since a
permanent or temporary faculty
member must sponsor a project
before credit can be granted,
individuals without faculty
contacts lose out.
The director will make it his
business to cultivate a group of
"Friends of the Student
Center"—both inside and outside
the campus. When a student
comes to the center, the director
will be able to refer him to a
potential sponsor with similar
interests.
This same awareness of who is
interested in what will be able to
ensure that projects are not
dropped because seniors graduate.
"Too often the continuing life of
a student project depends on the
passion of the student involved"
says Joyce Kobayashi.
The director hopefully will
serve as a "continuity factor" by
keeping graduate students or even
undergraduates in touch with
others who might be willing to
carry on the research. He would
also know when to bring
individuals of similar interest
together, when to expand a
one-man project into a group
effort.
New Majors
Finally, the Center's Policy
Board, in its capacity as an official
subcommittee of the CUS, would
be able to influence the
Committee's decisions concerning
larger projects. For instance, it is
possible that a large group effort
could consolidate new courses in
Urban Studies into a curriculum
cohesive enough to become a
major.
The Center for Innovation is
sponsored through a $7000 grant
from the Ford Foundation, and so
it can offer limited funding for
some projects. In addition, three
of the Policy Board Members are
University Follows, and would
have access to larger funds.
It is not too late to propose
individual projects for next
summer, or to design entire
courses for nt'xl fall. Members of
the Policy Board encourage
students to come in and talk with
them. They can be contacted by
calling the ASSU offices, ext.
4331.

past year's ASSU Council of
Presidents. At the institutional
level, the Center will help
interested students to design new
curricula and/or to create
extra-departmental courses. For
example, it will probably become
a clearing house for new courses
in Urban Studies and
Asian-American Studies.
On the individual level, it will
direct students to sympathetic
faculty members or interested
outside people who would be
willing to sponsor projects such as
the FM radio research, or directed
reading in a non-departmental
area. Once the sponsor is found,
the Center is authorized by the
CUS to grant Undergraduate
Special credit (Pass-Fail, no
recognition for major).
Independent Work
This kind of "matching-up"
service will be a principal
responsibility of the new director.
At present, few students other
than honors students or students

with appropriate faculty contacts
have an opportunity to do
independent work. Since a
permanent or temporary faculty
member must sponsor a project
before credit can be granted,
individuals without faculty
contacts lose out.
The director will make it his
business to cultivate a group of
"Friends of the Student
Center"—both inside and outside
the campus. When a student
comes to the center, the director
will be able to refer him to a
potential sponsor with similar
interests.
This same awareness of who is
interested in what will be able to
ensure that projects are not
dropped because seniors graduate.
"Too often the continuing life of
a student project depends on the
passion of the student involved"
says Joyce Kobayashi.
The director hopefully will
serve as a "continuity factor" by
keeping graduate students or even
undergraduates in touch with
others who might be willing to
carry on the research. He would
also know when to bring
individuals of similar interest
together, when to expand a
one-man project into a group
effort.
New Majors
Finally, the Center's Policy
Board, in its capacity as an official
subcommittee of the CUS, would
be able to influence the
Committee's decisions concerning
larger projects. For instance, it is
possible that a large group effort
could consolidate new courses in
Urban Studies into a curriculum
cohesive enough to become a
major.
The Center for Innovation is
sponsored through a $7000 grant
from the Ford Foundation, and so
it can offer limited funding for
some projects. In addition, three
of the Policy Board Members are
University Follows, and would
have access to larger funds.
It is not too late to propose
individual projects for next
summer, or to design entire
courses for nt'xl fall. Members of
the Policy Board encourage
students to come in and talk with
them. They can be contacted by
calling the ASSU offices, ext.
4331.
Interested in doing research on
how to set up an FM radio
station? Want to do fieldwork but
don't know where to go?
The new Student Center for
Innovation and Research has
pulled itself out of a puddle of
winter confusion and is now at
work on programs with the
student in mind.
The center has as its goal the
promotion of greater student
initiative in course design and
creation of independent projects.
Six students and five faculty
members have been nominated by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies to serve as the Center's
Policy Board.
The Board has already begun
considering giving credit for such
varied student-initiated projects as
cancer research and the History of
the Telephone Utilities in
California.
This week the board will
announce the name of its new
director—chosen from among 22
students who applied. The
director will move as soon as
possible into the old offices of the
department of Art and
Architecture: basement, Men's
Clubhouse.
