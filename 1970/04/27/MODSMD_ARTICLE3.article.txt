# Sit-In Aftermath
## Anger Follows Arrests 
### PAUL GRUSHFIN 
The aftermath of the Thursday
night anti-ROTC sit-in at the Old
Union reveals over $40,000 worth
of "trashed" windows, widespread
student and faculty outrage
against the police tactics used to
clear the building of
demonstrators, and at least one
group calling for an anti-violence
stand from the campus
community.
At 1:10 Friday morning, 50
Santa Clara County deputies
swept through the Old Union,
cleared it of 125 demonstrators
who had been there since 12:30
Thursday afternoon, and arrested
23 persons—l 3 men, 9 women,
and one juveile—on charges of
criminal trespass. Twelve are
Stanford students.
Angry Reaction
Reaction against the absence of
immediate warning before the
"bust" was often harsh, angry,
and frustrated in Friday's meeting
of the Committee of Fifteen, the
night meeting of the Off-ROTC
movement, and in leaflets
distributed on campus.
The most extreme view was
stated by the "Madera Affinity
Group" of the Off-ROTC
movement, which bitterly
attacked the "violent dispersion
of a peaceful demonstration" in a
Saturday leaflet directed to
President Pitzer. "As of Friday
morning, the non-violent sit-in is a
dead tactic at Stanford. We
thought we could expect time to
disperse before arrests were made.
"Don't expect the Off-ROTC
movement to play by your rules
again. Your insistence on violent
dispersion . . . has made it
necessary for us to make our own
rules."
A statement issued Sunday by
the recently elected ASSU
Presidential Council of Pat C.
Shea, Robert Grant, Hal
Mickelson, and Adam Levin,
further declared: "The.Old Union
sit-in was a peaceful, sincere, but
mis-directed attempt to change
the ROTC decision. The group
had agreed to leave the building if
the police arrived. The police,
once they were on campus,
determined their own tactics, and
rushed the demonstrators without
allowing them the opportunity to
leave."
Most Old Union demonstrators
claim police were not interested in
dispersing them, but instead
entered the building with the
intention of making arrests.
Owen Blank of Radio KZSU
testified at the Committee of 1 5
open hearings that faculty

observers arrived several minutes
after police. Professor St. Clair
Drake then commented, "Next
time let's see if we can provide
some other form of transportation
for the observers other than police
cars." Associate Provost Robert
Rosensweig noted at that same
meeting that "there was a meeting
at about 7 p.m. between the
deputies and faculty, where the
police outlined what they were
going to do. The only thing that
happened differently was that the
faculty observer arrangements
didn't come off as planned."
Rosensweig, who took the
brunt of the attack on the
administration, also declared "the
decision to clear the building was
made around 7 p.m. The police
were informed that a trespass was
occurring and were left to their
own discretion as to the tactics
they wished to use to clear the
building. The police were the ones
who decided to give no warning."
No More Games
In a statement distributed
Friday, Pitzer commented on
police intervention: "During this
time, and in view of various kinds
of unlawful activity over three
previous weeks, the Sheriff's
office decided not to give any
further notice because of a strong
likelihood of more fruitless games
of pursuing fleeing vandals
throughout the campus. The
University was informed of this
decision, but once the police are
summoned, decisions on how
their forces are deployed and on
what time schedule as well as the
issuance of any further warning
are entirely in the hands of
officers of the Sheriff's
department."
According to Pitzer,
Thursday's sit-in was not
non-disruptive and not
non-violent. "The situation during
the afternoon teetered on the
edge of what could reasonably be
called disruptive ae'.ion.
Office Disrupted
"If was impossible, for
example, for the Office oi"
Student Accounts to be open and
to function normally. Because of
this, because of the presence in
the crowd of a large number of
non-students, including many
juveniles, and because of a
sizeable number of persons
wearing masks to hide their
identity, it was decided late in the
afternoon that the building would
have to be closed at fivr o'clock
to protect valuable student and
financial records and other
property. This was done under the

new interim policy adopted by
the SCLC April 19.
"Accordingly, an order was
prepared and distributed closing
the building until 8 a.m. the next
morning. It should be noted that
the closing was for the night only,
in contrast to the closing of the
ROTC building for 30 days. The
possibility of non-violent,
non-disruptive activity the next
day was therefore left open."
$40,000 Damage
After the arrests were made on
Friday morning, angry
demonstrators smashed $40,000
worth of windows in the Business
School, the President's Office,
Tresidder Union, the Police
Station, the Post Office, Lou
Henry Hoover Library, and
Encina.
At least one group opposing
violence is circulating petitions.

One, calling itself the
"Non-Violent Group," asks
students to sign the statement:
"We do not condone violence on
the part of individuals of the
university, the police, the student
body, or the community. We
particularly oppose violence by
any side in connection with the
Off-ROTC conflict."
While the group states in a
leaflet that "their non-violence
could no longer remain merely
observant and passive," it has
taken no active stand on the
ROTC issue. "We are attempting
to find answers to the ROTC
question and to other questions of
institutional violence originating
in the University." The group
hopes to organize a forum to
discuss ROTC, and reduce tension
among all groups on campus "by
offering them food and songs and
love."

night meeting of the Off-ROTC
movement, and in leaflets
distributed on campus.
The most extreme view was
stated by the "Madera Affinity
Group" of the Off-ROTC
movement, which bitterly
attacked the "violent dispersion
of a peaceful demonstration" in a
Saturday leaflet directed to
President Pitzer. "As of Friday
morning, the non-violent sit-in is a
dead tactic at Stanford. We
thought we could expect time to
disperse before arrests were made.
"Don't expect the Off-ROTC
movement to play by your rules
again. Your insistence on violent
dispersion . . . has made it
necessary for us to make our own
rules."
A statement issued Sunday by
the recently elected ASSU
Presidential Council of Pat C.
Shea, Robert Grant, Hal
Mickelson, and Adam Levin,
further declared: "The.Old Union
sit-in was a peaceful, sincere, but
mis-directed attempt to change
the ROTC decision. The group
had agreed to leave the building if
the police arrived. The police,
once they were on campus,
determined their own tactics, and
rushed the demonstrators without
allowing them the opportunity to
leave."
Most Old Union demonstrators
claim police were not interested in
dispersing them, but instead
entered the building with the
intention of making arrests.
Owen Blank of Radio KZSU
testified at the Committee of 1 5
open hearings that faculty

observers arrived several minutes
after police. Professor St. Clair
Drake then commented, "Next
time let's see if we can provide
some other form of transportation
for the observers other than police
cars." Associate Provost Robert
Rosensweig noted at that same
meeting that "there was a meeting
at about 7 p.m. between the
deputies and faculty, where the
police outlined what they were
going to do. The only thing that
happened differently was that the
faculty observer arrangements
didn't come off as planned."
Rosensweig, who took the
brunt of the attack on the
administration, also declared "the
decision to clear the building was
made around 7 p.m. The police
were informed that a trespass was
occurring and were left to their
own discretion as to the tactics
they wished to use to clear the
building. The police were the ones
who decided to give no warning."
No More Games
In a statement distributed
Friday, Pitzer commented on
police intervention: "During this
time, and in view of various kinds
of unlawful activity over three
previous weeks, the Sheriff's
office decided not to give any
further notice because of a strong
likelihood of more fruitless games
of pursuing fleeing vandals
throughout the campus. The
University was informed of this
decision, but once the police are
summoned, decisions on how
their forces are deployed and on
what time schedule as well as the
issuance of any further warning
are entirely in the hands of
officers of the Sheriff's
department."
According to Pitzer,
Thursday's sit-in was not
non-disruptive and not
non-violent. "The situation during
the afternoon teetered on the
edge of what could reasonably be
called disruptive ae'.ion.
Office Disrupted
"If was impossible, for
example, for the Office oi"
Student Accounts to be open and
to function normally. Because of
this, because of the presence in
the crowd of a large number of
non-students, including many
juveniles, and because of a
sizeable number of persons
wearing masks to hide their
identity, it was decided late in the
afternoon that the building would
have to be closed at fivr o'clock
to protect valuable student and
financial records and other
property. This was done under the

new interim policy adopted by
the SCLC April 19.
"Accordingly, an order was
prepared and distributed closing
the building until 8 a.m. the next
morning. It should be noted that
the closing was for the night only,
in contrast to the closing of the
ROTC building for 30 days. The
possibility of non-violent,
non-disruptive activity the next
day was therefore left open."
$40,000 Damage
After the arrests were made on
Friday morning, angry
demonstrators smashed $40,000
worth of windows in the Business
School, the President's Office,
Tresidder Union, the Police
Station, the Post Office, Lou
Henry Hoover Library, and
Encina.
At least one group opposing
violence is circulating petitions.

One, calling itself the
"Non-Violent Group," asks
students to sign the statement:
"We do not condone violence on
the part of individuals of the
university, the police, the student
body, or the community. We
particularly oppose violence by
any side in connection with the
Off-ROTC conflict."
While the group states in a
leaflet that "their non-violence
could no longer remain merely
observant and passive," it has
taken no active stand on the
ROTC issue. "We are attempting
to find answers to the ROTC
question and to other questions of
institutional violence originating
in the University." The group
hopes to organize a forum to
discuss ROTC, and reduce tension
among all groups on campus "by
offering them food and songs and
love."
The aftermath of the Thursday
night anti-ROTC sit-in at the Old
Union reveals over $40,000 worth
of "trashed" windows, widespread
student and faculty outrage
against the police tactics used to
clear the building of
demonstrators, and at least one
group calling for an anti-violence
stand from the campus
community.
At 1:10 Friday morning, 50
Santa Clara County deputies
swept through the Old Union,
cleared it of 125 demonstrators
who had been there since 12:30
Thursday afternoon, and arrested
23 persons—l 3 men, 9 women,
and one juveile—on charges of
criminal trespass. Twelve are
Stanford students.

mis-directed attempt to change
the ROTC decision. The group
had agreed to leave the building if
the police arrived. The police,
once they were on campus,
determined their own tactics, and
rushed the demonstrators without
allowing them the opportunity to
leave."
Most Old Union demonstrators
claim police were not interested in
dispersing them, but instead
entered the building with the
intention of making arrests.
Owen Blank of Radio KZSU
testified at the Committee of 1 5
open hearings that faculty

observers arrived several minutes
after police. Professor St. Clair
Drake then commented, "Next
time let's see if we can provide
some other form of transportation
for the observers other than police
cars." Associate Provost Robert
Rosensweig noted at that same
meeting that "there was a meeting
at about 7 p.m. between the
deputies and faculty, where the
police outlined what they were
going to do. The only thing that
happened differently was that the
faculty observer arrangements
didn't come off as planned."
Rosensweig, who took the
brunt of the attack on the
administration, also declared "the
decision to clear the building was
made around 7 p.m. The police
were informed that a trespass was
occurring and were left to their
own discretion as to the tactics
they wished to use to clear the
building. The police were the ones
who decided to give no warning."
No More Games
In a statement distributed
Friday, Pitzer commented on
police intervention: "During this
time, and in view of various kinds
of unlawful activity over three
previous weeks, the Sheriff's
office decided not to give any
further notice because of a strong
likelihood of more fruitless games
of pursuing fleeing vandals
throughout the campus. The
University was informed of this
decision, but once the police are
summoned, decisions on how
their forces are deployed and on
what time schedule as well as the
issuance of any further warning
are entirely in the hands of
officers of the Sheriff's
department."
According to Pitzer,
Thursday's sit-in was not
non-disruptive and not
non-violent. "The situation during
the afternoon teetered on the
edge of what could reasonably be
called disruptive ae'.ion.
Office Disrupted
"If was impossible, for
example, for the Office oi"
Student Accounts to be open and
to function normally. Because of
this, because of the presence in
the crowd of a large number of
non-students, including many
juveniles, and because of a
sizeable number of persons
wearing masks to hide their
identity, it was decided late in the
afternoon that the building would
have to be closed at fivr o'clock
to protect valuable student and
financial records and other
property. This was done under the

new interim policy adopted by
the SCLC April 19.
"Accordingly, an order was
prepared and distributed closing
the building until 8 a.m. the next
morning. It should be noted that
the closing was for the night only,
in contrast to the closing of the
ROTC building for 30 days. The
possibility of non-violent,
non-disruptive activity the next
day was therefore left open."
$40,000 Damage
After the arrests were made on
Friday morning, angry
demonstrators smashed $40,000
worth of windows in the Business
School, the President's Office,
Tresidder Union, the Police
Station, the Post Office, Lou
Henry Hoover Library, and
Encina.
At least one group opposing
violence is circulating petitions.

One, calling itself the
"Non-Violent Group," asks
students to sign the statement:
"We do not condone violence on
the part of individuals of the
university, the police, the student
body, or the community. We
particularly oppose violence by
any side in connection with the
Off-ROTC conflict."
While the group states in a
leaflet that "their non-violence
could no longer remain merely
observant and passive," it has
taken no active stand on the
ROTC issue. "We are attempting
to find answers to the ROTC
question and to other questions of
institutional violence originating
in the University." The group
hopes to organize a forum to
discuss ROTC, and reduce tension
among all groups on campus "by
offering them food and songs and
love."
The aftermath of the Thursday
night anti-ROTC sit-in at the Old
Union reveals over $40,000 worth
of "trashed" windows, widespread
student and faculty outrage
against the police tactics used to
clear the building of
demonstrators, and at least one
group calling for an anti-violence
stand from the campus
community.
At 1:10 Friday morning, 50
Santa Clara County deputies
swept through the Old Union,
cleared it of 125 demonstrators
who had been there since 12:30
Thursday afternoon, and arrested
23 persons—l 3 men, 9 women,
and one juveile—on charges of
criminal trespass. Twelve are
Stanford students.
Angry Reaction
Reaction against the absence of
immediate warning before the
"bust" was often harsh, angry,
and frustrated in Friday's meeting
of the Committee of Fifteen, the
night meeting of the Off-ROTC
movement, and in leaflets
distributed on campus.
The most extreme view was
stated by the "Madera Affinity
Group" of the Off-ROTC
movement, which bitterly
attacked the "violent dispersion
of a peaceful demonstration" in a
Saturday leaflet directed to
President Pitzer. "As of Friday
morning, the non-violent sit-in is a
dead tactic at Stanford. We
thought we could expect time to
disperse before arrests were made.
"Don't expect the Off-ROTC
movement to play by your rules
again. Your insistence on violent
dispersion . . . has made it
necessary for us to make our own
rules."
A statement issued Sunday by
the recently elected ASSU
Presidential Council of Pat C.
Shea, Robert Grant, Hal
Mickelson, and Adam Levin,
further declared: "The.Old Union
