# Spikers Lose
## Close, But No Cigar 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
No one knew where the
Stanford band was going alter
leaving the Stanford-Washington
track meet Saturday in the early
going, but they probably had a
better time than a lot of the brave
fans who remained only to see the
inevitable: another Stanford loss.
The Cards came closer than in any
dual meet this year but still fell
short of Washington, 84-70.
Following a sterling rendition
of the William Tell Overture
during the mile, the band picked
up their gear and left. Washington
wins in the steeplechase, 440 relay
and mile, all crucial events, may
have convinced them that their
further presence would make little
difference.
The main problem for Stanford
was not that the band missed
most of the meet, but that a
couple of key performers
including hurdler Rick Tipton and
sprinter A 1 Dyson were also
absent. Without the two, the
Indians picked up only nine
points out of a possible 32 in the
100, 220, 440, and 440 relay.
Leading the Washington attack in
these events was Steve Berge, who
won t.Jie 100 ( 9.9) and 220 (22.1 )
and anchored the winning relay
team (41.9).
Discus Sweep
The field events went pretty
much as expected with Stanford
sweeping the discus, and winning
the pole vault and triple jump and
Washington taking the javelin,
shot put and high jump. The best
effort of the field events came in
the long jump when Stanford
freshman Tom Anderson won
with a jump of 24-s'/2 and in the
process set a new meet and
Stanford frosh record.
Four other meet records were
established in the field. For
Washington, John Hubbell in the
shot put (59-9'/2), Cary Feldmann

in the javelin (237-6), and Don
Shields in the high jump (6-9) all
set new meet standards. For
Stanford, Allen Meredith's fifty
foot leap in the triple jump
established yet another record.
Carrigan Wins
In the pole vault, the Tribe's
Casey Carrigan came near to still
another record but missed on
three attempts at 16-6. He seemed
to have cleared the height on his
second attempt, but hit the bar on
the way down. Carrigan still won
the event at 15-6.
For the most part, the running
events turned out to be
unbelievably close contests. No
less than seven out of eleven
events were decided by three
tenths of a second or less.
In fact in two events, the first
two finishers were awarded
identical times. In the high
hurdles the Indian's Bill Griffith
nosed out Jim Seymour (both
14.8) while in the 440
Washington's Scott Christensen
took Jim Kauffman down the
stretch and both were clocked in
48.7.
Three meet records were
recorded in the track events.
Washington picked up two with

Jim Johnson in the steeplechase
(8:53.2), while Jim Seymour in
the intermediate hurdles (52.3)
tied the existing meet record.
Greg Brock got one lor the Tribe
with a 13:49 three-mile. In the
steeplechase Stanford's Brook
Thomas (9:02.2) and Chuck Men/.
(9:19.2) ran lifetime bests but
coule finish no better than second
and fourth. In the steeplechase
and three-mile, records were
automatic since both wore new
events.
Next week the Cards, now 0-6,
travel to California for the Big
Meet. Berkeley has now replaced
San Jose as the speed capital of
the Bay area, and it will probably
be a long afternoon for Stanford.

and mile, all crucial events, may
have convinced them that their
further presence would make little
difference.
The main problem for Stanford
was not that the band missed
most of the meet, but that a
couple of key performers
including hurdler Rick Tipton and
sprinter A 1 Dyson were also
absent. Without the two, the
Indians picked up only nine
points out of a possible 32 in the
100, 220, 440, and 440 relay.
Leading the Washington attack in
these events was Steve Berge, who
won t.Jie 100 ( 9.9) and 220 (22.1 )
and anchored the winning relay
team (41.9).
Discus Sweep
The field events went pretty
much as expected with Stanford
sweeping the discus, and winning
the pole vault and triple jump and
Washington taking the javelin,
shot put and high jump. The best
effort of the field events came in
the long jump when Stanford
freshman Tom Anderson won
with a jump of 24-s'/2 and in the
process set a new meet and
Stanford frosh record.
Four other meet records were
established in the field. For
Washington, John Hubbell in the
shot put (59-9'/2), Cary Feldmann

in the javelin (237-6), and Don
Shields in the high jump (6-9) all
set new meet standards. For
Stanford, Allen Meredith's fifty
foot leap in the triple jump
established yet another record.
Carrigan Wins
In the pole vault, the Tribe's
Casey Carrigan came near to still
another record but missed on
three attempts at 16-6. He seemed
to have cleared the height on his
second attempt, but hit the bar on
the way down. Carrigan still won
the event at 15-6.
For the most part, the running
events turned out to be
unbelievably close contests. No
less than seven out of eleven
events were decided by three
tenths of a second or less.
In fact in two events, the first
two finishers were awarded
identical times. In the high
hurdles the Indian's Bill Griffith
nosed out Jim Seymour (both
14.8) while in the 440
Washington's Scott Christensen
took Jim Kauffman down the
stretch and both were clocked in
48.7.
Three meet records were
recorded in the track events.
Washington picked up two with

Jim Johnson in the steeplechase
(8:53.2), while Jim Seymour in
the intermediate hurdles (52.3)
tied the existing meet record.
Greg Brock got one lor the Tribe
with a 13:49 three-mile. In the
steeplechase Stanford's Brook
Thomas (9:02.2) and Chuck Men/.
(9:19.2) ran lifetime bests but
coule finish no better than second
and fourth. In the steeplechase
and three-mile, records were
automatic since both wore new
events.
Next week the Cards, now 0-6,
travel to California for the Big
Meet. Berkeley has now replaced
San Jose as the speed capital of
the Bay area, and it will probably
be a long afternoon for Stanford.

DO IT! Stanford freshman record holder extends himself fully in Saturday's
action against Washington. Tom Anderson leaped 24-5 V4 to set both a Stanford
Frosh and new meet record.
No one knew where the
Stanford band was going alter
leaving the Stanford-Washington
track meet Saturday in the early

fans who remained only to see the

dual meet this year but still fell

won t.Jie 100 ( 9.9) and 220 (22.1 )
and anchored the winning relay
team (41.9).
Discus Sweep
The field events went pretty
much as expected with Stanford
sweeping the discus, and winning
the pole vault and triple jump and
Washington taking the javelin,
shot put and high jump. The best
effort of the field events came in
the long jump when Stanford
freshman Tom Anderson won
with a jump of 24-s'/2 and in the
process set a new meet and
Stanford frosh record.
Four other meet records were
established in the field. For
Washington, John Hubbell in the
shot put (59-9'/2), Cary Feldmann

in the javelin (237-6), and Don
Shields in the high jump (6-9) all
set new meet standards. For
Stanford, Allen Meredith's fifty
foot leap in the triple jump
established yet another record.
Carrigan Wins
In the pole vault, the Tribe's
Casey Carrigan came near to still
another record but missed on
three attempts at 16-6. He seemed
to have cleared the height on his
second attempt, but hit the bar on
the way down. Carrigan still won
the event at 15-6.
For the most part, the running
events turned out to be
unbelievably close contests. No
less than seven out of eleven
events were decided by three
tenths of a second or less.
In fact in two events, the first
two finishers were awarded
identical times. In the high
hurdles the Indian's Bill Griffith
nosed out Jim Seymour (both
14.8) while in the 440
Washington's Scott Christensen
took Jim Kauffman down the
stretch and both were clocked in
48.7.
Three meet records were
recorded in the track events.
Washington picked up two with

Jim Johnson in the steeplechase
(8:53.2), while Jim Seymour in
the intermediate hurdles (52.3)
tied the existing meet record.
Greg Brock got one lor the Tribe
with a 13:49 three-mile. In the
steeplechase Stanford's Brook
Thomas (9:02.2) and Chuck Men/.
(9:19.2) ran lifetime bests but
coule finish no better than second
and fourth. In the steeplechase
and three-mile, records were
automatic since both wore new
events.
Next week the Cards, now 0-6,
travel to California for the Big
Meet. Berkeley has now replaced
San Jose as the speed capital of
the Bay area, and it will probably
be a long afternoon for Stanford.

DO IT! Stanford freshman record holder extends himself fully in Saturday's
action against Washington. Tom Anderson leaped 24-5 V4 to set both a Stanford
Frosh and new meet record.
No one knew where the
Stanford band was going alter
leaving the Stanford-Washington
track meet Saturday in the early
going, but they probably had a
better time than a lot of the brave
fans who remained only to see the
inevitable: another Stanford loss.
The Cards came closer than in any
dual meet this year but still fell
short of Washington, 84-70.
Following a sterling rendition
of the William Tell Overture
during the mile, the band picked
up their gear and left. Washington
wins in the steeplechase, 440 relay
and mile, all crucial events, may
have convinced them that their
further presence would make little
difference.
The main problem for Stanford
was not that the band missed
most of the meet, but that a
couple of key performers
including hurdler Rick Tipton and
sprinter A 1 Dyson were also
absent. Without the two, the
Indians picked up only nine
points out of a possible 32 in the
100, 220, 440, and 440 relay.
Leading the Washington attack in
these events was Steve Berge, who
won t.Jie 100 ( 9.9) and 220 (22.1 )
and anchored the winning relay
team (41.9).
