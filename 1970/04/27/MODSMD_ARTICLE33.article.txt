# Pac-8's Brand New Ball Game
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
If nothing else, the weekend's
action in Pacific-8 baseball proved
that there are no overwhelming
favorites in the Southern Division.
USC, tabbed by some as
virtually invincible, has now lost
three of seven conference games,
and is tied with Cal for the league
lead. Stanford and UCLA are a
game back with 3-4 marks.
The weekend opened in rousing
style for the Indians with a
convincing 7-2 triumph over
number-one ranked USC. Playing
the kind of baseball that, as coach
Ray Young put it, "Could have
beaten any team in the country,"
the Tribe put together another
flawless effort by Steve Dunning
on the mound with a 13 hit attack
to stun the angry Trojans.
Phil Keller's single scored Dick

Borchers to put the Tribe up 1-0
in the first, but a homer by TVojan
Russ Bennett tied the score half
an inning later.
The following hitter, catcher
Craig Perkins, went down with a
broken nose after an errant
Dunning toss, and the game was
on in earnest. Dan Stoligrosz led
off the SC second, but the Cards
regained the lead with two in the
fourth with the help of a leadoff
double by Dunning, a walk, a
single by Glen Johnson and a
double by Dave Edson.
Nelson's First Clout
The Indians made it 6-2 with a
three-run fifth. After a walk to
Don Schellenberg and a Dunning
single, first baseman Mike Nelson
crashed a three-run homer over
the fence in right.
Trojan Cal Meier, reaching on
an error in the bottom of the

fifth, took out his frustrations on
second baseman Phil Kelber on a
double play ball. SC's shortstop
went out of the basepath to dump
Kelber and did so. As Kelber came
down he cut open the skin behind
his ear in a gash that later required
15 stitches. He flew home Friday
night.
Dunning, not as sharp as he'd
been against USC here last week,
nevertheless struck out 15. But
Stanford left 14 runners on base.
Young sent Bruce Schoen
against UCLA in Saturday's first
game, but neither he nor Jim
Coate nor Bob Marshall could
contain the Bruins, who ran up
eight runs against Stanford's four.
Two home runs, by outfielders
Bob Petretta and Steve Price, gave
the Uclans three runs in the first,
and Stanford wasn't in it
thereafter. Lefthander Coate

wasn't able to retire the side in
the third as UCLA scored three
more times, so Marshall came in
to put out the fire. He eventually
gave up two more runs in the
sixth.
Dark Shadows
At the plate the Indians were
mere shadows of their Friday
selves. The highlights were fourth
inning homers by Nelson and left
fielder Bob Wilhelm which
narrowed the gap to 6-3. Nelson
got another RBI in the fifth to
continue his productive weekend,
but it wasn't enough. Rmners
stranded hurt again as the Indians
left seven in as many innings.
Nelson's seventh homer of the
year and a six-hit pitching
performance by senior Phil Keller
helped the Cards to a 6-0 win over
the Bruins in the nightcap. Keller
stretched his record to 6-4 and
was never in serious trouble.
The righthander also drove in
the first run, in the second, to give
the good guys a 1-0 edge. That
lasted until the fifth when the
Bruins' Gary Robson put two
ducks on the pond for the ever
cooperative Nelson, who emptied
the bases with a fence-clearing
shot to right. Catcher Bob Reece's
single and an Edson fielders'
choice put two more on the board
for Stanford in the sixth.
Despite the win, the Tribe
collected only four hits, a
development which might not
bode well for some of the Indians'
sluggers. On tap this week is a
Tuesday contest at USF, then
more Pac-8 action over the
weekend. Oregon and Oregon
State visit Sunken Diamond for
doubleheaders on Friday and
Saturday as the north meets the
south for the first time.
