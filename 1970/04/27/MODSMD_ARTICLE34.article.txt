# Stanford Wins
## Vanier Takes College Golf 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
Gary Vanier stalked teammate
Tom Watson for 36 holes before
catching him in the final round
Saturday to capture the individual

title in the Third Annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational Golf
Tournament.
Vanier surrounded par on each
of the three days with a 70-72-73
to card a 54 total of 215, edging
Watson and Jim Brady of Seattle
University who each reported to
the clubhouse with 216's.
Vanier'sand Watson's 1-2 finish
along with freshman John Beers'
impressive third place paced the
hosting Indians to a convincing
win over top challenger San Jose
to regain the team title lost last
year to USC.
San Jose led at the end of the
first round, but Stanford picked
up 11 stroked on Friday to surge
ahead by three and then widened
the gap on Saturday to 17,
872-889.
Beers, a promising golfer,
finished ahead of Alameda
Commuters winner, Kelley Moser
of San Jose, and Bob Allard, 1969
Pac-8 Champ from Oregon State.
Beers turned in a 70 on Friday,
one of two second round sub-par
scores. Brady carded the
tournament low of 67 on the
same day as he blazed across the
challenging Stanford course.
Watson had a 68 on his opening
round.
Watson was three strokes up
going into Saturday's final round,
ahead of both Vanier and Brady

who were deadlocked in the
number two position with a pair
of 132's.
An errant tee shot that sailed
out of bounds on the 16th Friday
probably cost Watson the
tournament.
Watson skied to a six over par
77 on the last day, and suddenly
found himself chasing Vanier,
who was already in and awaiting
the outcome.
Both Watson and Brady, who
finished with a 74, needed birdies
on the 18th to regain a tie for the
lead, but Watson left a wedge a
little short and Brady watched as
his putt curled past the hole and
failed to drop.
Vanier, a sophomore transfer
student, put it all together in
playing the most consistent golf
of his Stanford career. He had
been bothered early in the season
by atemperamentalputter.
An aggressive competitor,
Vanier is one of the longest hitters
on the Stanford team. He is
extremely powerful for his size
with strong, quick, hands and
wrists.
In fact, the winner of the 1969
Oakland City title and former San
Francisco Junior Champ,
sharpened up this year by
spending the Fall quarter decking
any and all comers in one of Ray
Lunny's boxing classes.
