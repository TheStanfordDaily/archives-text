# Struggle Stressed At Ecology Panels
## 
### NAN SELEY 
END Day, celebrated
nation-wide last Wednesday as
Earth Day, continued at Stanford
on Saturday. Workshops stressing
various aspects of the struggle for
a better environment were
scheduled.
Logging and land use, air
pollution, pesticides, and public
school curricula, and even that old
favorite the War in Viet Nam, all
were ecologically tackled by those
publicly and privately concerned.
Panelists for each workshop
were brought together from a
wide range of backgrounds, each
to present his field's view of the
problems involved and the
solutions needed. Out of all the
gloomy prophesies came a more
well-rounded understanding. Paul
Rupert requested as closing
statements from his workshop's

panelists not summaries of their
own words, but rather any new
perspectives they had gained from
their co-participants.
The largest and best publicized
of the workshops—"America and
the Environment: A Conflict of
Interests?" —drew nearly 150
people. Five panelists discussed
pullution in America, the
attitudes perpetuating it, and how
to deal with both.
Dt;. Perry McCarty stressed our
need for less waste. Industry
could benefit both themselves and
the public by learning to recycle
present • Cans, bottles
and old cars only do damage on
trash heaps (Americans throw
away 48 billion cans a year). Dow
Chemical Company could re-use
the 200 pounds of mercury it
discharges each day into Lake St.
Clair rather than destroying the

fishing industry with this
dangerous effluent.
John Rutherford, a candidate
for California state Senate,
explained that direct political
action rather than moral suasion
must combat pollution. Offers of
campaign money and votes will
buy pro-environmental legislation.
The courts must then use the new
laws to force both private citizens
and the government to abide by a
cleaner America.
Finally, Dr. Robert North, a
professor of political science, said
that the attitudes of industrialized
society threaten to destroy us all
through greed.
