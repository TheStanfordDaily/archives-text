# Class Boycott Set, Teach-In Planned
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT BOB LITTERMAN 
The Off-ROTC movement has
asked all students and faculty to
boycott their classes today and
tomorrow. At their Friday night
open meeting the movement
voted 128 to 108 for the boycott
as opposed to "mobile militant
action."
Instead of normal classes a full
schedule of counter classes is
being offered in a "Liberation
College" located in the Old Union
Courtyard. [The class schedule is
printed below with a list of other
related activities. ]
Support for the teach-in has
come from 30 professors,
including Nobel Laureate Linus
Pauling, and the new ASSU
Council of Presidents.
According to Provost Richard
Lyman, "a highly successful
boycott would be influential in
changing peoples'
opinions . . . but I don't see that a
boycott is at all possible of
success in changing the ROTC
decision."
Pitzer On K ZSU
President Pitzer will speak
tonight with Lyman on a .special
KZSU broadcast at 7:15 tonight.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
has arranged the program in order
to help clarify the issue of ROTC
and campus events of the past few
days.
The purpose of the boycott,
according to the Movement is "to
involve and inform the Stanford
community about a whole range
of issues which demand our
concern, attention, and action."
Any collective violent action has
been postponed, at least until
after the boycott. There will be a
meeting Tuesday evening to
discuss proposals for action
generated by the classes and
discussions during the boycott.
The boycott action resulted
from efforts of several speakers,
including Fred Cohen and Tom
Forstenzer, to call for non-violent
tactics. Cohen advocated trying a
boycott to see if most students

"who are usually with us" still
are.
Immediate Action Call
Earlier Jim Shoch, referred to
as "Hymie" throughout the
meeting, led a call for immediate
action. He suggested "a riot"
which would "bring Watts home."
He described his plan as a
long-range strategy "calculated to
win."
Shoch said students should use
a capitalist's "cost-benefit
analysis," making the cost of
keeping ROTC outweigh its
benefits to the administration. He
suggested bringing "Berkeley
home" by creating "an
unfavorable academic
environment" with tear gas and
police on every corner.
Shoch's speech became the
evening's keynote, as speakers
both for and against immediate
violence repeatedly referred to
"Hymie's strategy."
Response to Repression
Cohen called for the boycott
saying it may not succeed in
eliminating ROTC, but it is the
necessary response to repression
on campus. An even stronger call
for non-violence came from
Forstenzer, who argued, "The
notion of trashing windows when
we haven't even tried the
educational process is juvenile and
premature. Trashing windows is a
sign that we can't educate
people." Condemning the fire at
the Behavioral Science Center, he
added, The burning of research
papers is a trapic event "
One girl said the Movement is
"self-indulgent" and on an "ego
trip" because it uses violence
instead of seeking broad student
support.
Black Student Union leader
Leo Bazile told the Movement
"You've got a bunch of bullshit
leaders." He added, "If I was one
of those people arrested, I'd be
pissed. They sacrificed for your
jive-ass movement and you
haven't mentioned them yet."
Bazile said that mass support
should have been organized "the

day before yesterday" so that
police would not have found it
easy to arrest 23 demonstrators.
Several speakers asked the
group to take a stand against the
firebombing early Friday morning
which damaged the Center for
Advanced Studies in the
Behavioral Sciences and destroyed
research of several professors. One
student referred to the Indian
scholar whose lifetime work was
destroyed.
Money was collected for the
Legal Defense Fund, and Siegal
urged witnesses of the Friday
morning "bust" to give
confidential testimony to the
Legal Defense Committee.
Police Push?
Former Stanford history
instructor Peter Stern, one of the
23 arrested, said he had been
outside the building because he
was not in firm support of the
sit-in but "was made to trespass
by four Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputies" who pushed
him into the Old Union and up
against a wall. He said the same
was true of others who were
arrested and asked any witnesses
to the incident to contact him.
Stern claimed police harassed
those arrested by intentionally
drawing out the booking process.
Lenny Siegel said loudspeakers
used in the sit-in and left inside
the Old Union were slashed
between 4:30 and 8:30 Friday
morning.
