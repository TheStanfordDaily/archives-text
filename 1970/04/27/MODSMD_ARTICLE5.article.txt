# Pat A. Shea Meets Press; May Be 'Part Of Problem'
## 
### 
Patrick A. Shea has told a
nationwide television audience
that he may become "part of the
problem instead of part of the
solution" if the U.S. gets heavily
involved in the Cambodian war.
Shea, outgoing member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
appeared yesterday on NBC's
"Meet the Press". He was there to
answer questions about the
recently released report of the
Special Committee on Campus
Tensions, a group formed last
summer to look into the causes of
conflict on American campuses.
Appearing with Shea was the
head of the committee, Saul
Linowitz, a Cornell Trustee and
former ambassador to the
Organization of American States,
and Robin Fleming, President of
the University of Michigan.
Shea, one of the few students
on the committee, was posed a
number of questions by the panel
of newsmen. His most outspoken
reply was to a question given all
three committee member* about
what, would happen on campuses
if America did get involved in
Cambodia.
Becoming A Problem
Fleming and Linowitz said that
it would be a bad thing, but Shea
went one step further by saying
he might become "part of the
problem"—that is, that he would
become militant-

"People are going to become
increasingly militant and people
like myself who are regarded as
old-line liberals are going to have
to take action which is presently
called militant".
Shea also said he was "very
pessimistic as to the next four or
five years and the destruction you
will see on campuses." He thinks
that student dis-illusionment with
society is a "direction away from
idealism towards nihilism."
Law And Order Shea
Though emphasizing that
violence was not "justifiable at
any time", Shea asked that it be
looked at in the contest "of what
the Eisenhower Committee says
about our violent society." Shea
made the point that Americans
could be so deeply concerned
about the Apollo 13 astronauts
but shrug off reports of massacres
in Vietnam. He is "repulsed and
concerned" about the recent fire
which destroyed part of the
Center for Advanced Studies in
the Behavioral Sciences.
Asked about what he does to
solve campus tensions, Shea said
"you keep talking—that's all you
can really do." About local
campus radicals he believes "as
individuals I think we can
communicate, but as a group 1
have an increasingly harder time,
especially since I've come to be

knows as Law-and-Order Shea"
around campus.
He criticized those people at
Stanford "who announced
proudly we're out of the
non-violent sixties and into the
violent seventies" though he
admitted that "there is change
when there is violence and
confrontation." He thinks radicals
are able to mobilize large number
of students because of "the basic
tone of alienation ... of every
student . . . and because of
polarizing statements from
politicians."

Shea agree with Linowitz and
Fleming that unless problems such
as Vietnam, race, pollution, etc.,
are solved, the situation on
campus will stay bad.
Some of the newsmen criticized
the report because it is just that, a
report which may be promptly
disregarded as so many others
have been. Shea was also
pessimistic about the ultimate
chances of the report to ease
campus turmoil.
When asked if he was satisfied
with the report, Shea replied "It's
a great deal of pablum, without as
much meat as I had hoped . . . but
it's the type of report th.?t will he
read by legislators . . . one with a
lot of rhetoric wouldn't hav>
gotten very far."

tone of alienation ... of every
student . . . and because of

Shea agree with Linowitz and
Fleming that unless problems such
as Vietnam, race, pollution, etc.,
are solved, the situation on
campus will stay bad.
Some of the newsmen criticized
the report because it is just that, a
report which may be promptly
disregarded as so many others
have been. Shea was also
pessimistic about the ultimate
chances of the report to ease
campus turmoil.
When asked if he was satisfied
with the report, Shea replied "It's
a great deal of pablum, without as
much meat as I had hoped . . . but
it's the type of report th.?t will he
read by legislators . . . one with a
lot of rhetoric wouldn't hav>
gotten very far."
Patrick A. Shea has told a
nationwide television audience
that he may become "part of the
problem instead of part of the
solution" if the U.S. gets heavily
involved in the Cambodian war.
Shea, outgoing member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
appeared yesterday on NBC's
"Meet the Press". He was there to
answer questions about the
recently released report of the
Special Committee on Campus
Tensions, a group formed last
summer to look into the causes of
conflict on American campuses.
Appearing with Shea was the
head of the committee, Saul
Linowitz, a Cornell Trustee and
former ambassador to the
Organization of American States,
and Robin Fleming, President of
the University of Michigan.
Shea, one of the few students
on the committee, was posed a
number of questions by the panel
of newsmen. His most outspoken
reply was to a question given all
three committee member* about
what, would happen on campuses
if America did get involved in
Cambodia.
Becoming A Problem
Fleming and Linowitz said that
it would be a bad thing, but Shea
went one step further by saying
he might become "part of the
problem"—that is, that he would
become militant-

"People are going to become
increasingly militant and people
like myself who are regarded as
old-line liberals are going to have
to take action which is presently
called militant".
Shea also said he was "very
pessimistic as to the next four or
five years and the destruction you
will see on campuses." He thinks
that student dis-illusionment with
society is a "direction away from
idealism towards nihilism."
Law And Order Shea
Though emphasizing that
violence was not "justifiable at
any time", Shea asked that it be
looked at in the contest "of what
the Eisenhower Committee says
about our violent society." Shea
made the point that Americans
could be so deeply concerned
about the Apollo 13 astronauts
but shrug off reports of massacres
in Vietnam. He is "repulsed and
concerned" about the recent fire
which destroyed part of the
Center for Advanced Studies in
the Behavioral Sciences.
Asked about what he does to
solve campus tensions, Shea said
"you keep talking—that's all you
can really do." About local
campus radicals he believes "as
individuals I think we can
communicate, but as a group 1
have an increasingly harder time,
especially since I've come to be

knows as Law-and-Order Shea"
around campus.
He criticized those people at
Stanford "who announced
proudly we're out of the
non-violent sixties and into the
violent seventies" though he
admitted that "there is change
when there is violence and
confrontation." He thinks radicals
are able to mobilize large number
of students because of "the basic
tone of alienation ... of every
student . . . and because of
polarizing statements from
politicians."
