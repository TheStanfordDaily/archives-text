# Boycott

### 
We hope you are not on your way to class.
For the next two days, there are more important things
to talk about, more important places to make your presence
known. The future of ROTC at Stanford and the future
nature of political tactics on this campus may well be
determined by how much support the Off-ROTC class
boycott and teach-in attracts.
The activities may be viewed in a number of different
lights - as a last concession by radicals to the tactics o(
non-violence; as an attempt to catch administrators and
faculty refusing to join in open discussion; as a chance to
educate students about ROTC; and more.
We view the boycott-teach-in primarily as a means for
students to peacefully press for the demands of the
Off-ROTC movement and for recognition of the student
vote against credit for ROTC.
In a sense, the boycott can also take the place of a
campus-wide moratorium on classes which we have
repeatedly requested from the Administration. It can bring
administrators anil faculty into contact with students to
re-evaluate the ROTC decision.
As we have pointed out before, serious doubts have been
raised over two elements which helped form that decision.
First, statements by the national head of ROTC make us
question whether Stanford's arrangements for ROTC next
year come as close as possible to the faculty's original
intention. We think that when the faculty voted this spring,
it did not realize the Army would accept a ROTC program
without credit. Second, the attitude of one important
constituency in the University the students has changed
markedly over the past year.
The most sensible way to resolve the controversy is to
recognize these problems and reconsider ROTC plans in the
light of new information. Administrators and faculty have
thus far refused to take that course. Massive student support
of the boycott is perhaps the only way they can be
influenced.
A number of faculty members will never reconsider their
vote for fear of "compromising" the democratic
decision-making process in the face of threats. We teel the
process has already been invalidated. However, certain steps
short of total reconsideration might be taken to reconcile
student concern over ROTC. We hope these steps might also
be outlined during the next two days.
For example, faculty and administrators can promise to
lobby with the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
against credit for ROTC classes. Or they can pledge
opposition to the existence of ROTC on campus if punitive
clauses are left in its contracts.
President Pitzer maintains the ROTC question has been
decided, and there is plenty of time for discussion before it
comes to a vote again next year. But students are intensely
concerned now, and fear what will happen if ROTC is once
again relinquished to long-term anonymity.
The time to clear up the ROTC question is now. If
students, faculty and administrators recognize their
opportunity, the next two days can provide the means.

be outlined during the next two days.
For example, faculty and administrators can promise to
lobby with the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
against credit for ROTC classes. Or they can pledge
opposition to the existence of ROTC on campus if punitive
clauses are left in its contracts.
President Pitzer maintains the ROTC question has been
decided, and there is plenty of time for discussion before it
comes to a vote again next year. But students are intensely
concerned now, and fear what will happen if ROTC is once
again relinquished to long-term anonymity.
The time to clear up the ROTC question is now. If
students, faculty and administrators recognize their
opportunity, the next two days can provide the means.

We hope you are not on your way to class.
For the next two days, there are more important things
to talk about, more important places to make your presence
known. The future of ROTC at Stanford and the future
nature of political tactics on this campus may well be
determined by how much support the Off-ROTC class
boycott and teach-in attracts.
The activities may be viewed in a number of different
lights - as a last concession by radicals to the tactics o(
non-violence; as an attempt to catch administrators and
faculty refusing to join in open discussion; as a chance to
educate students about ROTC; and more.
We view the boycott-teach-in primarily as a means for
students to peacefully press for the demands of the
Off-ROTC movement and for recognition of the student
vote against credit for ROTC.
In a sense, the boycott can also take the place of a
campus-wide moratorium on classes which we have
repeatedly requested from the Administration. It can bring
administrators anil faculty into contact with students to
re-evaluate the ROTC decision.
As we have pointed out before, serious doubts have been
raised over two elements which helped form that decision.
First, statements by the national head of ROTC make us
question whether Stanford's arrangements for ROTC next
year come as close as possible to the faculty's original
intention. We think that when the faculty voted this spring,
it did not realize the Army would accept a ROTC program
without credit. Second, the attitude of one important
constituency in the University the students has changed
markedly over the past year.
The most sensible way to resolve the controversy is to
recognize these problems and reconsider ROTC plans in the
light of new information. Administrators and faculty have
thus far refused to take that course. Massive student support
of the boycott is perhaps the only way they can be
influenced.
A number of faculty members will never reconsider their
vote for fear of "compromising" the democratic
decision-making process in the face of threats. We teel the
process has already been invalidated. However, certain steps
short of total reconsideration might be taken to reconcile
student concern over ROTC. We hope these steps might also
be outlined during the next two days.
