that currently divide the campus community.
On Monday and Tuesday alternative educational activities related
to the events of the past month will take place on the campus. These
activities will include seminars, discussion groups, guerilla theater, an
educational carnival, and an open microphone.
In support of the boycott we urge all students and
employees —including faculty —to participate in all boycott activities.
