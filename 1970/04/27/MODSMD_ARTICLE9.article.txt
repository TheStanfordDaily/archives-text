# Revolutionary View
## The 						University Serves Whom? 
### Diarmuid Mcguire 
The pig press has frequently
pointed out that most
Weathermen come from privileged
backgrounds. Their parents are
the dukes and earls of the
Midwest, the town-house gentry
of New York.
This is taken as a contradiction
or a case of perversity. Why do
those who could own the system
come so quickly to the point
where all they want to do is blow
it up?
In fact the political position of
the Weathernation is quite logical,
given the upper class origins of
most members of that faction.
Weathermen assume that most
Americans benefit directly from
the murder and systematic
robbery of Third World peoples.
They believe that, since most
Americans have a material interest
in imperialism, there is no sense in
trying to organize a mass
movement against imperialism in
this country. The thing to do is
weaken the monster as much as
possible from within so that the
oppressed people of the world can
finish it off from the outside.
Of course this is suicidal. But
personal extinction seems like a
small price to pay when you begin
to understand the crimes that are
being committed by your
country, perhaps by your parents,
in your name.
Honest But Wrong
Most American revolutionaries
have come to see that the
Weathermen are honest but
wrong. Imperialism is not in the
interests of most Americans. It is
in the interests of the minority
which controls and benefits from
the economic empire—the
American bourgeoisie. Since many
revolutionaries have been born
and raised in the homes of a
corrupt class, and since their
experiences outside that class have
been brief and discouraging, it is
easy for them to assume that all
Americans are corrupt.
At Stanford we are victims of
the same cultural isolation that
has misled the Weathermen.
Stanford is owned and controlled
by the ruling class, it serves the

ruling class and many of the
people who teach or are taught
here are members of the ruling
class.
It would be easy to be a
Weatherman at Stanford—to
attack and destroy as much of this
ruling class institution as possible
before we are destroyed. It would
have been particularly easy to
take this road last Thursday night
when we realized that most
members of the community were
not going to join us no matter
what we could show them about
the university and the system
University Liberals
It is frustrating to know that
liberals will criticize the university
only as long as the system that the
university serves is not seriously
threatened. It is disturbing to
realize that these people are
interested only in smoothing out
the more troublesome
contradictions so that they can
keep the thing running and
increase their own influence. It is
frightening to understand many of
these liberals will attempt to
destroy us if we seriously
challenge the ability of their class
to dominate the university and
the society.
But in spite of the frustration
we feel, we must not forget that
Stanford serves the class interests
of a minority. Most Americans are
oppressed by imperialism in the
same way that the people of the
Third World are oppressed. This
includes white American workers
as well as the black and brown
internal colonies. One does not
have to be outside this bourgeois
environment very long to see that
the relative privileges that have
been awarded to some oppressed
Americans do not outweigh the
fact of their oppression.
But whether or not we see
ourselves in this perspective, we
are still at Stanford. What can we
do expect give material expression
to our rage?
Class Interests
First of all, we can understand
our own impulses and the actions
of those around us in terms of

class interests and class
conditioning.
Take a slimey individual like
Professor Philip Dawson for
example. One night he puts on a
green armband and leads a band
of pigs to the Old Union,
expressing the liberal hope that,
although the movement is being
smashed, none of the kids will get
hurt. The next day he is horrified
because the pigs were so ROUGH,
and he joins a call for a class
boycott.
Phil wants to make it. He
probably does not like the war.
But as soon as the movement
seriously challenges the system
behind the war, Phil will help
smash the movement. Because the
system behind the war is the same
system that he wants to make it
in.
Poor Man's Agony
This poor man is probably in
agony. Somewhere in the back of
his mind, he realizes that his
career is being built on the lives of
Vietnamese and other oppressed
people. But as long as he acts to
maintain the system, he will be a
Pig-
The same kind of
understanding can be applied to
other people, from the trustees to
those so-called movement leaders
who consistantly try to hold
militancy to the lowest possible
level. Some "left" intellectuals
have as strong a vested interest in
the status quo as the men who
own things.
For those of us who have
decided that our long-range
interests lie with another class,
there are several obligations. We
must persuade as many people as
possible to join us. And we must
inhibit as much as possible the
ability of Stanford to serve
imperialism.
No 'Mass' Movement
In the past, we have thought
mainly in terms of building a
"mass" movement at Stanford. In
view of the nature of the situation
as we now understand it, we may
have to accept the fact that the
movement will never include the
majority of students and

professors. But that is not to say
that Stanford will no longer feel
our presence.
We are in for a long fight, and
the fight is much larger than we
can see from our present position.
We must remember that as we
organize and act.
We will win. Stanford will
either serve the people or be
obliterated.

served with the Peace Corps in
Africa for two years before
enrolling in the Stanford
communication department in
1967. While working as a summer
intern with NEWSWEEK, he was
arrested during the 196H Chicago
convention. He met Jerry Rubin
in jail. McGuire dropped out of
school the next year, turned in his
draft card, and began to work
with the Resistance in Palo Alto.
He edited the Resistance
newspaper PLAIN RAPPER until
October, 1969, when it folded for
lack of funds. McGuire has been
active in the struggle to eliminate
ROTC from Stanford.)

The pig press has frequently
pointed out that most
Weathermen come from privileged
backgrounds. Their parents are
the dukes and earls of the
Midwest, the town-house gentry
of New York.
This is taken as a contradiction
or a case of perversity. Why do
those who could own the system
come so quickly to the point
where all they want to do is blow
it up?
In fact the political position of
the Weathernation is quite logical,
given the upper class origins of
most members of that faction.
Weathermen assume that most
Americans benefit directly from
the murder and systematic
robbery of Third World peoples.
They believe that, since most
Americans have a material interest
in imperialism, there is no sense in
trying to organize a mass
movement against imperialism in
this country. The thing to do is
weaken the monster as much as
possible from within so that the
oppressed people of the world can
finish it off from the outside.
Of course this is suicidal. But
personal extinction seems like a
small price to pay when you begin
to understand the crimes that are
being committed by your
country, perhaps by your parents,
in your name.
Honest But Wrong
Most American revolutionaries
have come to see that the
Weathermen are honest but
wrong. Imperialism is not in the
interests of most Americans. It is
in the interests of the minority
which controls and benefits from
the economic empire—the
American bourgeoisie. Since many
revolutionaries have been born
and raised in the homes of a
corrupt class, and since their
experiences outside that class have
been brief and discouraging, it is
easy for them to assume that all
Americans are corrupt.
At Stanford we are victims of
the same cultural isolation that
has misled the Weathermen.
Stanford is owned and controlled
by the ruling class, it serves the

ruling class and many of the
people who teach or are taught
here are members of the ruling
class.
It would be easy to be a
Weatherman at Stanford—to
attack and destroy as much of this
ruling class institution as possible
before we are destroyed. It would
have been particularly easy to
take this road last Thursday night
when we realized that most
members of the community were
not going to join us no matter
what we could show them about
the university and the system
University Liberals
It is frustrating to know that
liberals will criticize the university
only as long as the system that the
university serves is not seriously
threatened. It is disturbing to
realize that these people are
interested only in smoothing out
the more troublesome
contradictions so that they can
keep the thing running and
increase their own influence. It is
frightening to understand many of
these liberals will attempt to
destroy us if we seriously
challenge the ability of their class
to dominate the university and
the society.
But in spite of the frustration
we feel, we must not forget that
Stanford serves the class interests
of a minority. Most Americans are
oppressed by imperialism in the
same way that the people of the
Third World are oppressed. This
includes white American workers
as well as the black and brown
internal colonies. One does not
have to be outside this bourgeois
environment very long to see that
the relative privileges that have
been awarded to some oppressed
Americans do not outweigh the
fact of their oppression.
But whether or not we see
ourselves in this perspective, we
are still at Stanford. What can we
do expect give material expression
to our rage?
Class Interests
First of all, we can understand
our own impulses and the actions
of those around us in terms of

class interests and class
conditioning.
Take a slimey individual like
Professor Philip Dawson for
example. One night he puts on a
green armband and leads a band
of pigs to the Old Union,
expressing the liberal hope that,
although the movement is being
smashed, none of the kids will get
hurt. The next day he is horrified
because the pigs were so ROUGH,
and he joins a call for a class
boycott.
Phil wants to make it. He
probably does not like the war.
But as soon as the movement
seriously challenges the system
behind the war, Phil will help
smash the movement. Because the
system behind the war is the same
system that he wants to make it
in.
Poor Man's Agony
This poor man is probably in
agony. Somewhere in the back of
his mind, he realizes that his
career is being built on the lives of
Vietnamese and other oppressed
people. But as long as he acts to
maintain the system, he will be a
Pig-
The same kind of
understanding can be applied to
other people, from the trustees to
those so-called movement leaders
who consistantly try to hold
militancy to the lowest possible
level. Some "left" intellectuals
have as strong a vested interest in
the status quo as the men who
own things.
For those of us who have
decided that our long-range
interests lie with another class,
there are several obligations. We
must persuade as many people as
possible to join us. And we must
inhibit as much as possible the
ability of Stanford to serve
imperialism.
No 'Mass' Movement
In the past, we have thought
mainly in terms of building a
"mass" movement at Stanford. In
view of the nature of the situation
as we now understand it, we may
have to accept the fact that the
movement will never include the
majority of students and

professors. But that is not to say
that Stanford will no longer feel
our presence.
We are in for a long fight, and
the fight is much larger than we
can see from our present position.
We must remember that as we
organize and act.
We will win. Stanford will
either serve the people or be
obliterated.

draft card, and began to work

The pig press has frequently
pointed out that most
Weathermen come from privileged
backgrounds. Their parents are
the dukes and earls of the
Midwest, the town-house gentry
of New York.
This is taken as a contradiction
or a case of perversity. Why do
those who could own the system
come so quickly to the point
where all they want to do is blow
it up?
In fact the political position of
the Weathernation is quite logical,
given the upper class origins of
most members of that faction.
Weathermen assume that most
Americans benefit directly from
the murder and systematic
robbery of Third World peoples.
They believe that, since most
Americans have a material interest
in imperialism, there is no sense in
trying to organize a mass
movement against imperialism in
this country. The thing to do is
weaken the monster as much as
possible from within so that the
oppressed people of the world can
finish it off from the outside.
Of course this is suicidal. But
personal extinction seems like a
small price to pay when you begin
to understand the crimes that are
being committed by your
country, perhaps by your parents,
in your name.
Honest But Wrong
Most American revolutionaries
have come to see that the
Weathermen are honest but
wrong. Imperialism is not in the
interests of most Americans. It is
in the interests of the minority
which controls and benefits from
the economic empire—the
American bourgeoisie. Since many
revolutionaries have been born
and raised in the homes of a
corrupt class, and since their
experiences outside that class have
been brief and discouraging, it is
easy for them to assume that all
Americans are corrupt.
At Stanford we are victims of
the same cultural isolation that
has misled the Weathermen.
Stanford is owned and controlled
by the ruling class, it serves the

ruling class and many of the
people who teach or are taught
here are members of the ruling
class.
It would be easy to be a
Weatherman at Stanford—to
attack and destroy as much of this
ruling class institution as possible
before we are destroyed. It would
have been particularly easy to
take this road last Thursday night
when we realized that most
members of the community were
not going to join us no matter
what we could show them about
the university and the system
University Liberals
It is frustrating to know that
liberals will criticize the university
only as long as the system that the
university serves is not seriously
threatened. It is disturbing to
realize that these people are
interested only in smoothing out
the more troublesome
contradictions so that they can
keep the thing running and
increase their own influence. It is
frightening to understand many of
these liberals will attempt to
destroy us if we seriously
challenge the ability of their class
to dominate the university and
the society.
But in spite of the frustration
we feel, we must not forget that
Stanford serves the class interests
of a minority. Most Americans are
oppressed by imperialism in the
same way that the people of the
Third World are oppressed. This
includes white American workers
as well as the black and brown
internal colonies. One does not
have to be outside this bourgeois
environment very long to see that
the relative privileges that have
been awarded to some oppressed
Americans do not outweigh the
fact of their oppression.
But whether or not we see
ourselves in this perspective, we
are still at Stanford. What can we
do expect give material expression
to our rage?
Class Interests
First of all, we can understand
our own impulses and the actions
of those around us in terms of

class interests and class
conditioning.
Take a slimey individual like
Professor Philip Dawson for
example. One night he puts on a
green armband and leads a band
of pigs to the Old Union,
expressing the liberal hope that,
although the movement is being
smashed, none of the kids will get
hurt. The next day he is horrified
because the pigs were so ROUGH,
and he joins a call for a class
boycott.
Phil wants to make it. He
probably does not like the war.
But as soon as the movement
seriously challenges the system
behind the war, Phil will help
smash the movement. Because the
system behind the war is the same
system that he wants to make it
in.
Poor Man's Agony
This poor man is probably in
agony. Somewhere in the back of
his mind, he realizes that his
career is being built on the lives of
Vietnamese and other oppressed
people. But as long as he acts to
maintain the system, he will be a
Pig-
The same kind of
understanding can be applied to
other people, from the trustees to
those so-called movement leaders
who consistantly try to hold
militancy to the lowest possible
level. Some "left" intellectuals
have as strong a vested interest in
the status quo as the men who
own things.
For those of us who have
decided that our long-range
interests lie with another class,
there are several obligations. We
must persuade as many people as
possible to join us. And we must
inhibit as much as possible the
ability of Stanford to serve
imperialism.
No 'Mass' Movement
In the past, we have thought
mainly in terms of building a
"mass" movement at Stanford. In
view of the nature of the situation
as we now understand it, we may
have to accept the fact that the
movement will never include the
majority of students and

professors. But that is not to say
that Stanford will no longer feel
our presence.
We are in for a long fight, and
the fight is much larger than we
can see from our present position.
We must remember that as we
organize and act.
We will win. Stanford will
either serve the people or be
obliterated.
