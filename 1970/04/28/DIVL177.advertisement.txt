Today is a red-letter day for revolution buffs
everywhere. On this day in I945, Benito Mussolini - you
remember him, he made the trains run on time - was
strung up in Milan like so much pepperoni. Some 15ft
years earlier, another liberal figure of note. Captain Bligh,
was overthrown in the Mutiny on the Bounty. He, of
course, made the fatal mistake of setting sail without an
injunction.
If your dormitory is hijacked to Cuba, please call the
editorial desk collect at x4632.
If you have some Italian war bonds to unload, try the
Business Office at 327-4150.
