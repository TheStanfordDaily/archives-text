Give your
contact lenses
a bath P p ~â„¢
In order to keep your contact lenses as
comfortable and convenient as they were
meant to be, you have to take care of
them. But until now you needed two or
more separate solutions to properly
prepare and maintain your contacts. Not
with Lensine. Lensine is the one lens
solution for complete contact lens care.
Cleaning your contacts with Lensine
retards the buildup of foreign deposits on
the lenses. And soaking your contacts in
Lensine overnight assures you of proper
lens hygiene. You get a free soaking case
on the bottom of every bottle of Lensine
It has been demonstrated that improper
storage between weanngs may result in
the growth of bacteria on the lenses.
This is a sure cause of eye irritation and
in some cases can endanger your vision.
Bacteria cannot grow in Lensine which is
sterile, self-sanitizing, and antiseptic.
Just a drop or two of Lensine, before you
insert your lens, coats and lubricates it
allowing the lens to float more freely in
A I im the eye's fluids. That's because
|j| Lensine is an "isotonic" solution,
which means that it blends with
the natural fluids of the eye.
Let your contacts be the
convenience they were
meant to be. Get
some Lensine, from the
mm Mu rine Company, Inc.
