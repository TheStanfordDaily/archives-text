# ASSU Council Looks Back
## 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
"John, in answer to the unposed question: tell
them the thing I'm most tired of is WORDS.
—Joyce."
John Grube, a member of the outgoing ASSU
Council of Presidents commented on the above
note, hastily scribbled out and fastened to his door
by co-President Joyce Kobayashi: "In looking
back over the year, I guess that's true for me too.
I'm tired of so much talk when what is needed is a
great deal of hard work over time on an
issue-oriented basis."
Patrick A. Shea, John Grube, and Joyce
Kobayashi were busy clearing out their old office
this past weekend to make way for the new
Council, and it was a time for looking back over
the past year.
"What I think we accomplished ..." mused
Shea, "Well, when you're in a position of
responsibility or quasi-leadership as we were, you
first have to know where the institution you're
representing is at. With the increased degree of
polarization this year, with insults being
exchanged at all levels, we found ourselves first
with the goal of trying to get people to talk to
each other."
Personal Contact
All three thought that they had been less
successful in communicating with the student
body than they had hoped. Joyce remarked that
one thing they might have done differently would
have been in making "much more personal contact
with students, a perennial problem."
But last year's Council of Presidents goes out of
office leaving a significant number of innovations

withdrawal is exactly what this campus doesn't
need at this point."
Students' Power
The implication was clear that students were
left to pick up the slack. "The real power of the
students, and I think that this is something not
enough people realize," Shea observed, "lies in the
ability of the students to bring about real changes
in the academic structure."
Shea commented on his increased political
unpopularity toward the end of this year. "It
almost seems better that people took it out on me
rather than on someone outside campus, or among
themselves," he remarked.
But he said that all three were very close, and
their ability to work together and keep one
another "as a constant reference was a source of
stability for the Council."
Smooth Transition
They looked forward to a smooth transition to
the next Council of Presidents, whom they had
endorsed before the run-off election. Grube noted
that the new Council was committed to seeing
through many of the programs which originated
with their Council.
Shea observed that a "different segment of the
community will be involved in student government
next year—more traditionally oriented."
"I'm wondering whether they're going to be
able to handle some of the problems on campus
here next year, as race relations. Some of the
members have a perspective on the problem, and
perhaps some do not," commented Shea.
But he said that he, John, and Joyce had been
requested to stay around the office and help
smooth out the change over.

in student government behind them. The concept
of Council of Presidents, the SWOPSI program, the
broader scheme of student representation on
administrative committees, the Student Center,
and the SUN program are all new to the University
this year.
The SWOPSI program, largely the work of
Joyce Kobayashi, has been "quite successful; 450
to 600 students participated in the 48 total
workshops," she noted.
"I am a little disappointed however. We haven't
had as many interested in the central organization
of courses. We expected students to see the
potential and put together their own courses, but
it didn't work as well as we would have liked."
Down on Faculty
John Grube characterized his quiet,
behind-the-scenes role as one dedicated to
"sustained effort and follow through," and he
voiced criticism of a faculty which needed
constant prodding.
Regarding his own special area of work, the
revamping of the committee structure, Grube said
he was "singularly unimpressed by faculty
participation in committees, with the exception of
the SCLC. The allegiance of the faculty is
misdirected; they don't think in terms of the
institution, but in terms of their own ends and
careers."
"The faculty fails to take steps in a crisis," he
remarked.
Kobayashi concurred, "I've been very
disappointed. It's understandable; they're tired
and would prefer to do research, but that kind of
