Daily Criticism
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's news coverage of
the tragedy at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences is prominent and well
done. But why is there no
editorial comment on this outrage
perpetrated against individual
scholars and the whole cause of
scholarship by this senseless
arson? One would expect an
academic community—and the
student newspaper as part of that
community—to feel profound
shock and disgust at such an
event.
Amidst the hue and cry over
damage to the supposed right of
individuals to commit illegal acts
without suffering legal
consequences, where is some sign
of revulsion at this senseless act of
desecration? Perhaps the horrors
of the Twentieth Century are
truly dulling our senses to the
point where outrage is only
feasible against trivial annoyances
or tragedies at a distance —it can
no longer be mustered against
genuine and significant evils in our
own community. Perhaps also the
fashionable doctrine that violence
against property is acceptable has
made it difficult for some people
to understand the meaning of an
act of violence that destroys, not
a man, it is true, but the better
part of a man's life's work.

Editor, ilie Daily:
I am one of the twenty-three
persons arrested in the Old Union
sit-in. My main purpose, here, is a
personal condemnation of the
violence and destruction which
have both preceeded and followed
the arrests. Handling of the
situation by the administration
and police, student apathy, or our
arrests —none of these can
legitimately be used as excuses for
violence and destruction.
Accordingly, I am very much
disturbed by the assumption
which many seem to be making
that all who took part in the sit-in
are synonomous with those
responsible for the violence. I
would like to think that there were
people there different from those
burning buildings and breaking
windows—people who do not
condone violence.
I, for one, am such a person.
And if, as it will probably be
claimed, there were none of these
"different" people there, then
they should have been there. The
3600 people who voted that
ROTC should not be given credit
on this campus should have been
there, for the sit-in was, despite
what President Pitzer might say,
both non-violent and
non-disruptive (or, at least, if it
was disruptive, it was disruptive to
a very tolerable degree).

If those 3600 who were not
there had been there (or even, to
be "legal," had been in the
courtyard) we would not be
where we are now. The apathetic
must be condemned as well as the
violent. They, also, are a
significant part of the problem.
And, as long as I am
condemning, I should not let the
administration and the police
action go by. The way the
situation was handled was, in my
opinion, unwise and wrong. The
sit-in was non-violent and
non-disruptive. Those involved
had voted to leave peacefully. The
police "sneak attack" could have
had no other effect than to add
significantly to the problems of
violence which already existed on
campus. I don't know what they
had in mind—but it could not
have been justice, or even order.

We of the Madera Affinity
Group are very disturbed over The
Chronicle's tragic distortion of the
leaflet we posted Saturday. The
leaflet stated, as The Daily
pointed out, that "the non-violent
sit-in is a dead tactic at Stanford."
There is a world of difference
between that statement and The
Chronicle's interpretation that we
reject ALL non-violent tactics at
Stanford. We believe that
non-violent tactics are the most
desirable, and we will continue to
support non-violence as long as
possible. Due to the violent
University response to Thursday's
non-violent sit-in at the Old
Union, we feel that this tactic is
no longer a viable method for
obtaining rational University
response, but by no means have
we rejected boycotts, teach-ins,
strikes, and other forms of
non-violent protest.
It must also be made clear that
the leaflet represents only the
response of the Madera Affinity
Group, presenting our response to
the University's repressive
reaction to the protest. Our
ultimate object is not violent
conquest of the University, but
instead penetration of the
administration's studied
indifference to the real issue—the
violence perpetrated overseas by
ROTC and the United States
military.
The Madera Affinity Group
Stan And Mc
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to clarify my
position regarding the cartoon
which I co-authored with Stan
Krute for Friday's DAILY. Stan
and I discussed the idea that the
sit-in (at that time expected to
run all weekend) would be
analogous to the many frat, parties
running at the same time, so I

drafted the invitation to join the
demonstrators in the form of a
rush invitation.
I don't feel that Stan's
illustrations of my invitation
which caricature administrators,
press, and student leaders bring us
any closer to a solution to the
conflict but rather through
ridicule serve to allienate many
sides of the community. While a
spirit of humor can and should
exist between various factions, I
feel that my work served to
provoke animosity rather than
provide comic relief.

I would like to clarify my
position regarding the cartoon
which I co-authored with Stan
Krute for Friday's DAILY. Stan
and I discussed the idea that the
sit-in (at that time expected to
run all weekend) would be
analogous to the many frat, parties
running at the same time, so I

drafted the invitation to join the
demonstrators in the form of a
rush invitation.
I don't feel that Stan's
illustrations of my invitation
which caricature administrators,
press, and student leaders bring us
any closer to a solution to the
conflict but rather through
ridicule serve to allienate many
sides of the community. While a
spirit of humor can and should
exist between various factions, I
feel that my work served to
provoke animosity rather than
provide comic relief.

The Daily's news coverage of
the tragedy at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences is prominent and well
done. But why is there no
editorial comment on this outrage
perpetrated against individual
scholars and the whole cause of
scholarship by this senseless
arson? One would expect an
academic community—and the
student newspaper as part of that
community—to feel profound
shock and disgust at such an
event.
Amidst the hue and cry over
damage to the supposed right of
individuals to commit illegal acts
without suffering legal
consequences, where is some sign
of revulsion at this senseless act of
desecration? Perhaps the horrors
of the Twentieth Century are
truly dulling our senses to the
point where outrage is only
feasible against trivial annoyances
or tragedies at a distance —it can
no longer be mustered against
genuine and significant evils in our
own community. Perhaps also the
fashionable doctrine that violence
against property is acceptable has
made it difficult for some people
to understand the meaning of an
act of violence that destroys, not
a man, it is true, but the better
part of a man's life's work.

I am one of the twenty-three
persons arrested in the Old Union
sit-in. My main purpose, here, is a
personal condemnation of the
violence and destruction which
have both preceeded and followed
the arrests. Handling of the
situation by the administration
and police, student apathy, or our
arrests —none of these can
legitimately be used as excuses for
violence and destruction.
Accordingly, I am very much
disturbed by the assumption
which many seem to be making
that all who took part in the sit-in
are synonomous with those
responsible for the violence. I
would like to think that there were
people there different from those
burning buildings and breaking
windows—people who do not
condone violence.
I, for one, am such a person.
And if, as it will probably be
claimed, there were none of these
"different" people there, then
they should have been there. The
3600 people who voted that
ROTC should not be given credit
on this campus should have been
there, for the sit-in was, despite
what President Pitzer might say,
both non-violent and
non-disruptive (or, at least, if it
was disruptive, it was disruptive to
a very tolerable degree).

If those 3600 who were not
there had been there (or even, to
be "legal," had been in the
courtyard) we would not be
where we are now. The apathetic
must be condemned as well as the
violent. They, also, are a
significant part of the problem.
And, as long as I am
condemning, I should not let the
administration and the police
action go by. The way the
situation was handled was, in my
opinion, unwise and wrong. The
sit-in was non-violent and
non-disruptive. Those involved
had voted to leave peacefully. The
police "sneak attack" could have
had no other effect than to add
significantly to the problems of
violence which already existed on
campus. I don't know what they
had in mind—but it could not
have been justice, or even order.

was disruptive, it was disruptive to
a very tolerable degree).

If those 3600 who were not
there had been there (or even, to
be "legal," had been in the
courtyard) we would not be
where we are now. The apathetic
must be condemned as well as the
violent. They, also, are a
significant part of the problem.
And, as long as I am
condemning, I should not let the
administration and the police
action go by. The way the
situation was handled was, in my
opinion, unwise and wrong. The
sit-in was non-violent and
non-disruptive. Those involved
had voted to leave peacefully. The
police "sneak attack" could have
had no other effect than to add
significantly to the problems of
violence which already existed on
campus. I don't know what they
had in mind—but it could not
have been justice, or even order.

We of the Madera Affinity
Group are very disturbed over The
Chronicle's tragic distortion of the
leaflet we posted Saturday. The
leaflet stated, as The Daily
pointed out, that "the non-violent
sit-in is a dead tactic at Stanford."
There is a world of difference
between that statement and The
Chronicle's interpretation that we
reject ALL non-violent tactics at
Stanford. We believe that
non-violent tactics are the most
desirable, and we will continue to
support non-violence as long as
possible. Due to the violent
University response to Thursday's
non-violent sit-in at the Old
Union, we feel that this tactic is
no longer a viable method for
obtaining rational University
response, but by no means have
we rejected boycotts, teach-ins,
strikes, and other forms of
non-violent protest.
It must also be made clear that
the leaflet represents only the
response of the Madera Affinity
Group, presenting our response to
the University's repressive
reaction to the protest. Our
ultimate object is not violent
conquest of the University, but
instead penetration of the
administration's studied
indifference to the real issue—the
violence perpetrated overseas by
ROTC and the United States
military.

I would like to clarify my
position regarding the cartoon
which I co-authored with Stan
Krute for Friday's DAILY. Stan
and I discussed the idea that the
sit-in (at that time expected to
run all weekend) would be
analogous to the many frat, parties
running at the same time, so I

drafted the invitation to join the
demonstrators in the form of a
rush invitation.
I don't feel that Stan's
illustrations of my invitation
which caricature administrators,
press, and student leaders bring us
any closer to a solution to the
conflict but rather through
ridicule serve to allienate many
sides of the community. While a
spirit of humor can and should
exist between various factions, I
feel that my work served to
provoke animosity rather than
provide comic relief.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily's news coverage of
the tragedy at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences is prominent and well
done. But why is there no
editorial comment on this outrage
perpetrated against individual
scholars and the whole cause of
scholarship by this senseless
arson? One would expect an
academic community—and the
student newspaper as part of that
community—to feel profound
shock and disgust at such an
event.
Amidst the hue and cry over
damage to the supposed right of
individuals to commit illegal acts
without suffering legal
consequences, where is some sign
of revulsion at this senseless act of
desecration? Perhaps the horrors
of the Twentieth Century are
truly dulling our senses to the
point where outrage is only
feasible against trivial annoyances
or tragedies at a distance —it can
no longer be mustered against
genuine and significant evils in our
own community. Perhaps also the
fashionable doctrine that violence
against property is acceptable has
made it difficult for some people
to understand the meaning of an
act of violence that destroys, not
a man, it is true, but the better
part of a man's life's work.

Editor, ilie Daily:
I am one of the twenty-three
persons arrested in the Old Union
sit-in. My main purpose, here, is a
personal condemnation of the
violence and destruction which
have both preceeded and followed
the arrests. Handling of the
situation by the administration
and police, student apathy, or our
arrests —none of these can
legitimately be used as excuses for
violence and destruction.
Accordingly, I am very much
disturbed by the assumption
which many seem to be making
that all who took part in the sit-in
are synonomous with those
responsible for the violence. I
would like to think that there were
people there different from those
burning buildings and breaking
windows—people who do not
condone violence.
I, for one, am such a person.
And if, as it will probably be
claimed, there were none of these
"different" people there, then
they should have been there. The
3600 people who voted that
ROTC should not be given credit
on this campus should have been
there, for the sit-in was, despite
what President Pitzer might say,
both non-violent and
non-disruptive (or, at least, if it
was disruptive, it was disruptive to
a very tolerable degree).

If those 3600 who were not
there had been there (or even, to
be "legal," had been in the
