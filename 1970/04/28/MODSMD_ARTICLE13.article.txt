## Violence In America 
### 
Television censors who
eliminate the ugly consequences
of violence from news and
factional presentations are doing
more harm than good, according
to a study published by a
committee of psychiatrists at
Stanford University School ol
Medicine.
Without its gory aspects,
violence is depicted as a good,
often quick way to get things
done, says the committee on
violence of the Department of
Psychiatry.
"Ironically, the viewer is
deprived of the one aspect ol
violence that might discourage
violence," the committee states.
"The censor cuts out the ugly
consequences, the victim's pain
and agony, and the wanton
destruction of life.
"This restricts the viewer from
determining the value of violent
acts, since the full impact and
range of consequences are not
presented for appraisal."
Report Out
These findings appear in a new
book, VIOLENCE AND THE
STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.
The 451-page book resulted from
an estensive examination of
violence and its roots following
the assassination of Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy. Edited by Drs. David
N. Daniels, Marshall F. Gilula, and
Frank Ochberg, the book
examines biological,
psychodynamic, and
environmental bases of violence to
relationships of violence to mental
illness, drugs and lack of gun
controls.
"Nowhere is violence as a
sanctioned coping strategy more
evident than in mass media
portrayals of violence, expecially
on television," the psychiatrists
write. "The media foster the
image of the Violent American

armed with gun, ignorance, and
frustration, ruthlessly pursuing
good and evil alike.
"Television, radio, and
newspapers project a repetitive,
staccato beat of violence, showing
us that violence is valued,
necessary, wanted, and even
enjoyed,"
One report indicates that one
TV station showed 334 completed
or attempted killings in one week.
About 50 per cent of prime time
programs feature violence and
crime.
Television's Influence
What of the effect of this
violent fare on viewers and
readers?
"Although all mass media have
appeal and impact, television has
the most powerful impact," the
psychiatrists said. "It effortlessly
teaches pupils where they are, in
the way humans learn best:
through simultaneous
presentations to the visual and
auditory senses.
"For the young in particular
learning involves observing,
imitating, and then observing once
again. Furthermore, television by
virtue of its nearly real simulation
of life, its inherent authenticity,
blurs the line between reality and
fantasy..
"The television industry knows
this and so do advertisers. If TV
can teach people to buy things,
that is to alter their behavior, it
also can teach people violence."
Specific Proposals
Another aspect of the report
identifies specific proposals for
individual action to end the era of
violence:
Stop being inconsistent about
standards of behavior surrounding
violence. A society that condemns
some forms of violence but
encourages others—war, capital
punishment, and other

collectively sanctioned violent
behaviors—is breeding confusion.
Learn about the potential
hazards of overpopulation and its
contribution to violent behavior,
consider the merits of family
planning, and limit the size of
American families.
Eliminate excessively punitive
discipline for children and
substitute nonviolent discipline
and positive rewards. Parents who
punish children by violent means
teach them violence.
Urge schools to develop
curricula in the nonviolent
resolution of conflict. Most books
present the past as the procession
of wars. Are students guided to
draw the appropriate conclusions
from the facts? Is their meaning
for the present isolated and
elaborated?
Write to professions in the
mass media urging them to
emphasize that violence is
destructive rather than flamorous,
and to sponsor educational
programs that teach nonviolent
means of solving problems.
Open channels of
communication among members
of different groups having
different views and needs.
Encourage legislators to enact
strong firearms control laws and
to establish a more effective legal
machinery for the expression of
grievances.
Urge legislators, law
enforcement officials, and judges
to eliminate cruel social controls
and penalties and to emphasize
rehabilitation.
The Stanford report says
"these recommendations are only
a portion of the possible
individual actions that can and
must be taken. The essential point
is that individual citizens are not
helpless to act—eact of us can take
part in decreasing violence."
