Robert Freelen 35, has been
named to the newly created
position of director of student
services, effective immediately,

Formerly associate dean of
students, Freelen will now be

his A.B. at Stanford in 1957 and
his M.B.A. in 1959. He returned
to the University in 1 961.
He has directed the Stanforc

The Freelens have done
extensive work with voluntary
student organizations at Stanford,
especially those concerned with
Mexican-American high school
students in Mountain View.
Freelen recently returned from a
trip to Alaska with students
seeking American Indian
applicants for the University.
The new position was
recommended by the
student-faculty search committee
which selected Bulkeley last year.
