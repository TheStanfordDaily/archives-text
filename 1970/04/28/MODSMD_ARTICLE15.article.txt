# Suicidal Man Fights Police At Med Center
## 
### 
After failing four times to take
his own life, an incoming patient,
aided by a dozen girl friends,
attempted to escape from police
at the Stanford hospital last
Sunday.
Jimmie Lee Carey, 29, of East
Palo Alto, was waiting to be
examined by a psychiatrist when
his girl friend, Betty Moore, 21,
tried to force her way into the
room where he was strapped to a
gurney. Ten to 15 other women
waited outside in the corridor.
Sheriff's Deputy James Van
Pelt gave this account of what
happened next:
Carey started yelling,
unhooked his straps and jumped
off the gurney. Van Pelt and two
other deputies charged into the
room. Carey swung at one of
them and broke into the hallway,
knocking over trays and shattering
glass.
The deputies tackled Carey,
but Miss Moore then fell on one
of the officers yelling, "Keep your
hands off of him."
The other women moved in.
Van Pelt was kicked in the back
and Miss Moore elbowed him in
the stomach. He hit Miss Moore in
the back, knocked her down and
ripped her jacket.
Another woman grabbed for
Van Pelt's gun, and when he
grabbed for it, she shouted "Look
out, he's going to pull his gun and
shoot."
Finally a doctor shot thorazene
into Carey's arm. When the drug
took effect Carey was handcuffed.
After a "code 20" (assist
officer—urgent) was answered by
Palo Alto Police, order was
restored.
An account of Carey's suicide
attempts Sunday afternoon was
given by a friend, Larry Young:
—Carey first tried to stab
himself by putting a screwdriver
to his belly and running into a
wall.
—He then ran into Miss
Moore's back bedroom, smashed a

window and tried to cut his
wrists.
—Young threw Carey on the
bed, but Carey got away and again
tried to cut his wrists on the glass
still in the window frame.
—Running outside, Carey
jumped in front of a car. The car
screeched to a halt without hitting
him, so he jumped against it,
landing on the grille.
—Getting up, Carey said,
"Damn, that didn't work either."
He went to the other side of the
road and ran in front of another
car. The car stopped and he again
threw himself onto the grille.
It was at this time that two
CHP patrolmen arrived at the
scene and took him to the
hospital.
Carey has since been
transferred to Agnew State
Hospital, the motive for his
suicide attempts still unknown.


POLLUTION SOLUTION—No longer must students pedal their way around
engineering corner to cause a collision, the electric bicycle pictured above will
do it by itself. The brainstorm of a Stanford alumnus, Roy Kaylor of Menlo
Park, the bike runs on a 24 volt, 25 ampere hour nickel-cadmium battery. It has
a top speed of 25 mph and a range of 1 2 miles.
Kaylor modestly said, "It's an idea I've had in my mind for a long time." But
he had harsh words alioiit Stanford bicycle paths—"rough, bumpy, antiquated."
No wonder, he added, "all the bicyclists ride in the street."
For all the do-it-yourselfers, Kaylor recommends an ordinary car battery for
the bike. "It would work the best of anything for the money involved," he said.

ripped her jacket.
Another woman grabbed for
Van Pelt's gun, and when he
grabbed for it, she shouted "Look
out, he's going to pull his gun and
shoot."
Finally a doctor shot thorazene
into Carey's arm. When the drug
took effect Carey was handcuffed.
After a "code 20" (assist
officer—urgent) was answered by
Palo Alto Police, order was
restored.
An account of Carey's suicide
attempts Sunday afternoon was
given by a friend, Larry Young:
—Carey first tried to stab
himself by putting a screwdriver
to his belly and running into a
wall.
—He then ran into Miss
Moore's back bedroom, smashed a

window and tried to cut his
wrists.
—Young threw Carey on the
bed, but Carey got away and again
tried to cut his wrists on the glass
still in the window frame.
—Running outside, Carey
jumped in front of a car. The car
screeched to a halt without hitting
him, so he jumped against it,
landing on the grille.
—Getting up, Carey said,
"Damn, that didn't work either."
He went to the other side of the
road and ran in front of another
car. The car stopped and he again
threw himself onto the grille.
It was at this time that two
CHP patrolmen arrived at the
scene and took him to the
hospital.
Carey has since been
transferred to Agnew State
Hospital, the motive for his
suicide attempts still unknown.


POLLUTION SOLUTION—No longer must students pedal their way around
engineering corner to cause a collision, the electric bicycle pictured above will
do it by itself. The brainstorm of a Stanford alumnus, Roy Kaylor of Menlo
Park, the bike runs on a 24 volt, 25 ampere hour nickel-cadmium battery. It has
a top speed of 25 mph and a range of 1 2 miles.
Kaylor modestly said, "It's an idea I've had in my mind for a long time." But
he had harsh words alioiit Stanford bicycle paths—"rough, bumpy, antiquated."
No wonder, he added, "all the bicyclists ride in the street."
For all the do-it-yourselfers, Kaylor recommends an ordinary car battery for
the bike. "It would work the best of anything for the money involved," he said.
After failing four times to take
his own life, an incoming patient,
aided by a dozen girl friends,
attempted to escape from police
at the Stanford hospital last
Sunday.
Jimmie Lee Carey, 29, of East
Palo Alto, was waiting to be
examined by a psychiatrist when
his girl friend, Betty Moore, 21,
tried to force her way into the
room where he was strapped to a
gurney. Ten to 15 other women
waited outside in the corridor.
Sheriff's Deputy James Van
Pelt gave this account of what
happened next:
Carey started yelling,
unhooked his straps and jumped
off the gurney. Van Pelt and two
other deputies charged into the
room. Carey swung at one of
them and broke into the hallway,
knocking over trays and shattering
glass.
The deputies tackled Carey,
but Miss Moore then fell on one
of the officers yelling, "Keep your
hands off of him."
The other women moved in.
Van Pelt was kicked in the back
and Miss Moore elbowed him in
the stomach. He hit Miss Moore in
the back, knocked her down and
ripped her jacket.
Another woman grabbed for
Van Pelt's gun, and when he
grabbed for it, she shouted "Look
