# Horses Trial

### 
Disgusted with movie
criminals? This Thursday
Serjeants at Law, the Law School
mock trial organization, will try
Michael Sarrazin for shooting Jane
Fonda in "They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?" The trial is at 7:30
p.m. in the Moot Court Room of
the Law School.
For those who haven't seen the
movie, the basic plot shows Jane
and Michael participating in a
dance marathon during The Great
Depression. After 65 straight days
of dancing, with only ten minutes
of sleep every two hours, Jane
discovers that the contest is rigged
and asks Michael to shoot her.
Sarrazin obliges and will be
charged with first-degree murder
as two second-year law students
prosecute and two defend him.
Sarrazin's defense is a legal
concept called diminished
responsibility in which he will
state that the effects of The
Depression, and the inhuman
conditions of the marathon, as
well as his lack of sleep,
contributed to his diminished
responsibility and thus he is not
guilty of the murder charge.
Testifying on Sarrazin's behalf
will be Dr. William Dement,
Stanford professor of psychiatry
and the nation's number one
researcher into the effects of sleep
deprivation. Also testifying will be
a psychology professor on behalf
of the prosecution, and the
characters played by Gig Young
and Susannah York.
Students interested in serving
on mock-trial juries may call the
Serjeants at Law at x 3621.
