# Little Success For Boycott; Mass Meeting Slated Tonight
## 
### 
With class attendance near
normal, a little over 200 students
attended the "Liberation College"
at any one time yesterday in the
first afternoon of a two day
boycott called by the anti-ROTC
movement.
The Off-ROTC movement
boycott continues today with
another schedule of classes at the
"Liberation College" concluding
with a mass meeting tonight at
7:30 at a place to be announced
at the teach-in. This meeting will
decide on further movement
strategy for trying to force ROTC
to leave campus.
Yesterday, students
participated in classes in the Old
Union courtyard all morning and
afternoon. The crowd size varied
but never exceeded 250.
A phone survey of
departmental officials revealed
that attendance at classes was
normal for a Monday. A few
classes were down about 10 per
cent, including Psychology I. One
mathematics class reported that
only about half the class attended,
but the teacher explained that it
was an 8 o'clock class and that
students may have used the

boycott as an excuse for not
attending class.
The Palo Alto Times reported
as their lead story yesterday that a
faculty member distributed an
open letter to the Stanford
community calling the violence of
the "Stanford Revolutionary
group" a "hate filled animal."
Fed Up
In the letter, Robert J. Moffat,
associate professor of mechanical
engineering, said: "I feel
threatened by the potential for
violence which this group has
brought to our campus . . . I'm
through being detached and
intellectual about violence at
Stanford. I'm fed up with the
revolutionary egotist."
Moffat dismissed any sit-in
saying, "I hear an implied support
for burning the ROTC buildings"
(the Navy ROTC building was
burned two years ago).
He told the Palo Alio Times
that he was taking his stand to
attempt to create an atmosphere
on campus that will not tolerate
biolence. He also said that
"people who don't agree (with the
violence) have got to speak up."

At the boycott today classes
ranged from "Violence and
non-violence" to "Rap about
anything." The total attendance
for the day may have reached
500-600.
During the day, H. Bruce
Franklin, English associate
professor, explained his
experience with the Santa Clara
workers—a ladies' union—to
about 100 people.
Other topics of discussion
ranged from ROTC, South
Vietnam and Cambodia to the
University and the police.
Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling
highlights today's schedule. He
will speak at noon in White Plaza
and anyone will be allowed to
speak after him at an open mike.
Classes scheduled for today
include: the Arab-Israeli Conflict;
The High School Revolution;
Bobby Seale; and the Rebellion in
the U.S. Military,
Pig Drill
At today's boycott a panel
discussion on the White Plaza on
The War in Southeast Asia at 1
p.m. is also planned.
About 3:30 p.m. yesterday, 30
people, emulated a sit-in and

gathered in groups on the second
and third floors of the Old Union.
The drill (called a "Pig Drill") was
billed as a "civil defense
protective measure to help
prepare in the eventuality of a
future bust of a future sit-in."
It took 23 seconds to clear the
building with a clogging of the
main front stair-well in efforts to
escape. Sponsors said they were
worried and disappointed with the
times calculated, feeling that it
was too slow considering the
realness of past police actions in a
similar situation.
Counter Chronology
The teach-in was supported by
30 professors, including Pauling.
The Off-ROTC movement
yesterday issued a "White Paper
on the Old Union Sit-In," in
response to the chronology issued
by President Pitzer and printed in
yesterday's Daily.
The document claimed that
Pitzer violated the terms of the
SCLC legislation under which he
closed the Old Union by failing to
place guards at all doors. It
accused Pitzer of avoiding the
chance of clearing the building in
a non-violent manner by failing to
inform the protestors that they
were subject to immediate arrest.
