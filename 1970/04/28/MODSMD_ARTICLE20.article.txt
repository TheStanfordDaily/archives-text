# Earth House Theme
## 
### 
An ecology theme house,
intended to bring together
students interested in
environmental problems, is being
planned for next year.
The house, to be called Earth
House, would carry out a variety
of projects, from clean-ups to
political campaigning. Within the
house seminars would be offered
on population problems,
environmental law, pollution
control, and other environmental
topics. These courses would be
taught by resident and
non-resident assistants.
The house is intended for
students of all fields of study who
are interested in environmental
issues, not just those in the
natural sciences. Earth House
would be located in Serra House,
Stern Hall and would be an

all-class co-ed dorm with 90
people. It is hoped that these
students will represent a variety of
interests and educational
backgrounds.
Earth House should not be
confused with the Adelfa House,
which will be centered on a
out-door activities theme,
including conservation projects
though it is planned for the
houses to carry out some joint
projects.
The final decision on Earth
House depends on getting at least
60 students to indicate that they
would be willing to participate in
Earth House. If you are
interested, please call x 3047 or
sign the list in the Undergraduate
Housing Office on the third floor
of the Old Union by Tuesday
afternoon.
