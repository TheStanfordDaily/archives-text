## US May Arm Cambodia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary
of State William P. Rogers was
quoted as telling the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
Monday that Cambodia is seeking
enough U.S. military assistance to
equip a large army with
everything from trucks to planes.
Chairman J.W. Fulbright,
D-Ark., said it appeared from
Roger's testimony at a 2Vi hour
closed session that the
administration has not made a
decision on whether to give the
Asian nation assistance. Fulbright
said Rogers was told that the
committee is firmly against
sending any aid to Cambodia.

A White House spokesman
emphasized meanwhile that the
United States has an overriding
interest in Cambodia.
No one was saying definitely
that this foreshadowed a favorable
presidential decision on the
embattled Asian nation's bid for
U.S. arms. But that possibility was
not definitely foreclosed, either.
Press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler was asked whether
President Nixon regards the
Cambodian situation as a crisis.
Ziegler said he was not going to
characterize it beyond saying that
the chief executive of course is
concerned about the course of
events and is meeting with his
advisers regarding them.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas
excused himself Monday from
two obscenity cases and a libel
dispute. He gave no reason.
Rep. Gerald R. Ford, R-Mich.,
said that by ruling himself out of
the obscenity cases Douglas
tacitly admitted he should have
disqualified himself in a case Ford
cited in calling for impeachment
of the 71-year-old justice.
"The Douglas disqualifications
announced Monday," Ford said,
"also indicate the extent to which
Justice Douglas' off-the-bench
activities have diminished his
usefulness on the Supreme
Court."
Douglas disqualified himself
from cases in which Barney
Rossett, president of Evergreen
Review and Grove Press, seeks to
prevent banning of the erotic
Swedish film "I am Curious
Yellow" in Maryland and
Massachusetts.

The libel case from which
Douglas withdrew Monday
involves a $12.5 million action
against the publisher of Look
magazine by Mayor Joseph L.
Alioto of San Francisco.
Fast
BERKELEY (AP) - Eleven
University of California students
who said they are against the
ROTC but also against violence
started a fast and vigil Monday at
a spot calculated to put them in
the way of more belligerent
demonstrators Tuesday.
The People's Coalition of
campus area radicials has
announced plans for a march on
Callaghan Hall, a Navy ROTC
building, at noon.
That's where the 11 fasters,
calling themselves the Peace
Brigade, took up station Monday.
In cold, windy weather,
spokesman David Lumsdaine, 21,
a mathematics senior, said "we are
here to protest campus militancy,
ROTC, war research and violent
confrontation politics."
He said they plan to pass out
bread and sing peace songs when
the other faction shows up.
