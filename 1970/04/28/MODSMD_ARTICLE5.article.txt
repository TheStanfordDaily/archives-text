## Pitzer Backs Campus ROTC 
### DAVE BRENNER 
President Kenneth Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman justified
the presence of ROTC and the use
of outside police on campus last
night.
Speaking in separate KZSU
radio interviews the two men
fielded questions from reporters
and answered those phoned in by
listeners. The program will be
rebroadcast tonight at 6 p.m. on
KZSU. Live coverage of the
anti-ROTC meeting will follow.
Pitzer, speaking first, stated
that "as long as programs are
academically feasible and
economically reasonable they
should be made available even if

only a minority want them. "
When asked to define academic
acceptability Pitzer stated that
"there is much knowledge that we
wish didn't exist. But as long as
there is a body of knowledge it's
difficult to throw it out because it
is obnoxious to a certain
percentage of the community."
ROTC Distinct
He reaffirmed his opposition to
the War and the draft by calling
for withdrawal from Vietnam and
further efforts to create a
volunteer army. He considered
ROTC to be distinct from both
the war and the draft, saying that
since we have a military that

KDTC should remain on campus
to provide a civilian impact on the
army.
Lyman dealt primarily with last
Thursday's sit-in and clarified
chronological and decision-making
details. He explained the rationale
for calling outside authorities on
campus to handle disruptions. He
questioned how much the
university can divorce itself from
society at large.
"Is there is to be one law for
campus and another for the rest
of society? If you agree that there
should, then you must tell why."
He explained that students wish
to be different from other law
breakers and receive advantages
denied to most citizens. He was
referring to student demands for
warning before facing arrest and
amnesty for those busted in
demonstrations.
Stanfordocentric
Lyman commended the Santa
Clara Police for showing restraint
in handling the Old Union sit-in.
He said that it would be hard to
find more restraint shown
anywhere in the country.
Lyman belittled the national
impact of the Stanford ROTC
struggle. He stated that some
students have a "Stanfordocentric
view of the world and our relation
to the pentagon. The army wants
to keep it (ROTC) on as many
good campuses as possible. But I
don't think they're losing any
sleep over us."
Both men emphasized their
desire for an end to the turmoil
presently dividing the campus.
Lyman expressed his desire to
become less of a policeman and
return to more academic pursuits.
Pitzer firmly stated his opposition
to violence both in Vietnam and
at Stanford. He also denounced
the use of coercive tactics by
interest groups to force their will
on the campus.

He explained that students wish
to be different from other law
breakers and receive advantages
denied to most citizens. He was
referring to student demands for
warning before facing arrest and
amnesty for those busted in
demonstrations.
Stanfordocentric
Lyman commended the Santa
Clara Police for showing restraint
in handling the Old Union sit-in.
He said that it would be hard to
find more restraint shown
anywhere in the country.
Lyman belittled the national
impact of the Stanford ROTC
struggle. He stated that some
students have a "Stanfordocentric
view of the world and our relation
to the pentagon. The army wants
to keep it (ROTC) on as many
good campuses as possible. But I
don't think they're losing any
sleep over us."
Both men emphasized their
desire for an end to the turmoil
presently dividing the campus.
Lyman expressed his desire to
become less of a policeman and
return to more academic pursuits.
Pitzer firmly stated his opposition
to violence both in Vietnam and
at Stanford. He also denounced
the use of coercive tactics by
interest groups to force their will
on the campus.
President Kenneth Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman justified
the presence of ROTC and the use
of outside police on campus last
night.
Speaking in separate KZSU
radio interviews the two men
fielded questions from reporters
and answered those phoned in by
listeners. The program will be
rebroadcast tonight at 6 p.m. on
KZSU. Live coverage of the
anti-ROTC meeting will follow.
Pitzer, speaking first, stated
that "as long as programs are
academically feasible and
economically reasonable they
should be made available even if

only a minority want them. "
When asked to define academic
acceptability Pitzer stated that
"there is much knowledge that we
wish didn't exist. But as long as
there is a body of knowledge it's
difficult to throw it out because it
is obnoxious to a certain
percentage of the community."
ROTC Distinct
He reaffirmed his opposition to
the War and the draft by calling
for withdrawal from Vietnam and
further efforts to create a
volunteer army. He considered
ROTC to be distinct from both
the war and the draft, saying that
since we have a military that

KDTC should remain on campus
to provide a civilian impact on the
army.
Lyman dealt primarily with last
Thursday's sit-in and clarified
chronological and decision-making
details. He explained the rationale
for calling outside authorities on
campus to handle disruptions. He
questioned how much the
university can divorce itself from
society at large.
"Is there is to be one law for
campus and another for the rest
of society? If you agree that there
should, then you must tell why."
He explained that students wish
to be different from other law
breakers and receive advantages
denied to most citizens. He was
referring to student demands for
warning before facing arrest and
amnesty for those busted in
demonstrations.
