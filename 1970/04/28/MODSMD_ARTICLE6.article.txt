# Pitzer's Statement
## 
### 
President Pitzer released the
following statement Monday:
A number of people in the
University have asked in the last
several days about the way in
which decisions involving the
police are made and the sources of
advice which I seek and receive on
the matter. I believe it is
worthwhile to address these
questions in some detail.
The decision to ask for police
assistance in handling a disruption
is made by the President, or the
Acting President in my absence.
There is no acceptable alternative
to this final responsibility. The
President of the University is
charged inescapably with
protecting the safety of persons
and property on the campus. In
matters of major significance,
such as the situation last Thursday
night, I cannot delegate that
responsibility to any other person
or group.
In reaching decisions of this
kind I have sought and will
continue to seek advice from a

variety of sources. In addition to
the Provost and members of our
staffs, the most important
continuing source of advice for
the past two years has been the
Faculty Consultative Group on
Campus Disruptions. The
members of this group are
designated by the Committee on
Committees of the Faculty
Senate. This group meets
frequently in times of trouble.
Their advice to me is
confidential and is given by each
person as an individual member of
the faculty. No votes are taken
and no reports are made. I believe
that this arrangement has served
the President, the faculty, and the
University well.
Student opinion is also
welcomed and sought. In the last
week, for example, both the
Provost and I have spoken with
many students, some at their
request and some at ours. Their
number has included elected
student body officers and
students with no official

responsibility. I believe it is fair to
say that in advance of Thursday's
decision, I had before me a wide
range of student opinion, much of
which was opposed to the action
which was finally taken.
I shall continue to do my best
to become informed of student
opinion as far as possible before
major decisions are taken.
Included in this, certainly, is
consultation, when and
circumstance permit, with elected
officers of the student body, the
Council of Presidents. I shall
continue, also, to make full use of
the Faculty Consultative Group,
whose value has been proved
many times.
When the present disorder is
ended and there is both the time
and the atmosphere for detached
reflection, I hope that members of
the faculty, student body, and
administration can glean whatever
is to be learned from the
experience of this spring and
recommend such changes in the
machinery of advising as would
appear to be useful.

advice which I seek and receive on
the matter. I believe it is
worthwhile to address these
questions in some detail.
The decision to ask for police
assistance in handling a disruption
is made by the President, or the
Acting President in my absence.
There is no acceptable alternative
to this final responsibility. The
President of the University is
charged inescapably with
protecting the safety of persons
and property on the campus. In
matters of major significance,
such as the situation last Thursday
night, I cannot delegate that
responsibility to any other person
or group.
In reaching decisions of this
kind I have sought and will
continue to seek advice from a

variety of sources. In addition to
the Provost and members of our
staffs, the most important
continuing source of advice for
the past two years has been the
Faculty Consultative Group on
Campus Disruptions. The
members of this group are
designated by the Committee on
Committees of the Faculty
Senate. This group meets
frequently in times of trouble.
Their advice to me is
confidential and is given by each
person as an individual member of
the faculty. No votes are taken
and no reports are made. I believe
that this arrangement has served
the President, the faculty, and the
University well.
Student opinion is also
welcomed and sought. In the last
week, for example, both the
Provost and I have spoken with
many students, some at their
request and some at ours. Their
number has included elected
student body officers and
students with no official

responsibility. I believe it is fair to
say that in advance of Thursday's
decision, I had before me a wide
range of student opinion, much of
which was opposed to the action
which was finally taken.
I shall continue to do my best
to become informed of student
opinion as far as possible before
major decisions are taken.
Included in this, certainly, is
consultation, when and
circumstance permit, with elected
officers of the student body, the
Council of Presidents. I shall
continue, also, to make full use of
the Faculty Consultative Group,
whose value has been proved
many times.
When the present disorder is
ended and there is both the time
and the atmosphere for detached
reflection, I hope that members of
the faculty, student body, and
administration can glean whatever
is to be learned from the
experience of this spring and
recommend such changes in the
machinery of advising as would
appear to be useful.
President Pitzer released the
following statement Monday:
A number of people in the
University have asked in the last
several days about the way in
which decisions involving the
police are made and the sources of
advice which I seek and receive on
the matter. I believe it is
worthwhile to address these
questions in some detail.
