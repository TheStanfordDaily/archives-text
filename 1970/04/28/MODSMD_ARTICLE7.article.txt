AN OPEN LETTER TO THE
STANFORD COMMUNITY:
Let Us Change The Climate
of Violence
In the pre-dawn hours of
Friday, April 24, 1970, a fire
set by as yet unknown
arsonists destroyed or damaged
ten offices of the Center for
Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at
Stanford. The life work of
Prof. M.N. Srinivas, a
distinguished Indian
anthropologist who is spending
a year at the Center on leave
from the University of Delhi,
was destroyed: research notes
embodying the work of over
twenty years were ravaged.
Professor Srinivas' magnum
opus was to have been a study
of the Indian caste system
Manuscripts and research
notes of several other scholars
were lost or damaged,
including some materials
belonging to Professor Sol Tax
of the University of Chicago, a
noted champion of the rights
of American Indians in
contemporary U.S. society.
The lives of two student
caretakers sleeping in a
building which narrowly
escaped being engulfed in the
flames were jeopardized.
Physical damage to the Center
is estimated at close to
$100,000.
We are deeply concerned
that this fire may have been
related to the escalating
climate of violence on campus
in recent weeks. We
unequivocally support peaceful
protest. However, we believe
that recent protest activities on
campus have passed these
bounds into dangerous levels of
violence and threats of further
violence. We are deeply
worried that an occasional
violence-prone person may
interpret the advocacy of
"mobile militant tactics" in
such ways as to include cruel
acts like the burning of the
* Center.
We hope that the Off-ROTC
Movement shares the sorrow
and outrage of the Stanford
* community at this tragic
occurrence and we call upon
them to express themselves at
this time.

'Very Up - Tight'
To Whom It May Concern:
You will find me very up-tight
about the Stanford Revolutionary

group and their posturing. As best
I can understand myself, here is
why.
I feel threatened by the
potential for violence which this
group has brought to our campus.
There is an animal here. A hate
filled animal. A crazed animal that
gets its kicks from screaming foul
language, from smearing buildings
with paint, from breaking
windows, from burning.
I feel helpless before the
anonymity of this night-animal.
Its larger ravages are impossible to
prevent. We cannot guard against
it. Who can tell which twisted
lunatic set the fire which burned
the Behavioral Sciences Building?
Who burned President Sterling's
office? Who burned the ROTC
building?
I want this animal removed
from the Stanford campus. I want
it pursued and hounded by every
legal means. I want it isolated. I
want it starved of support.
To this end I begrudge every
scrap of legitimacy and every
morsel of support it receives, from
any source. I oppose every person
who defends it.
I'm through being detached
and intellectual about violence at
Stanford. I'm fed up with the
revolutionary egotist.
So - Don't talk to me about the
legitimacy of the sit-in. I HEAR
AN IMPLIED SUPPORT FOR
BURNING THE ROTC
BUILDINGS.
So - Don't talk to me about the
police using "unnecessary force."
I HEAR SUPPORT FOR THE
ANIMAL THAT BURNED
STERLING'S OFFICE.
So - Don't talk to me about
amnesty. I HEAR SUPPORT FOR
THE INSANE VIOLENCE THAT
SMASHED AND BURNED THE
BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
BUILDING.
If you want me to listen to
grievances that you feel are just,
then get rid of the lunatic addicts
of arson and vandalism. As long as
the stench of burning and the
threat of further violence hangs
over this campus I'm not
interested in your cute little, hair
splitting arguments.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The Off-ROTC movement loses
credibility when that group
becomes a party to campus
pollution resulting from vandalism
such as rock throwing, paint
spattering or fire bombing. If it is
not a party to such repulsive acts,
let it say so for all to hear. Several
of the sit-in persons with whom I
talked on April 23 shrugged off
the destructive nature of such
actions as being trivial compared
to the violent events in Vietnam.
Clearly, a similar argument could
be used to support damage to any
kind of property, e.g., such
personal items as original
manuscripts.
The destruction which we have
seen at Stanford reflects, I believe,
the underlying modus operandi of
some hard-core leaders whose aim

is to radicalize as many people as
possible. It would appear that
they wish to destroy the fabric of
our present society, making
generous use of violence as a
technique. The ROTC issue just
happens to be a suitable current
vehicle for their missionary
purpose. Others can be introduced
as needed, no doubt. Their
pronouncements also show a
contempt for basic democratic
processes of our political system,
and they have, evidently, little
patience for the discipline of
systematic intense study which is
a necessary base for the
intellectual freedom enjoyed by
the mature scholar.
Although its destructive acts on
campus have tainted the
Off-ROTC movement, there must
be within that organization a
substantial sub-group opposed to
vandalism and violence. The best
way for those people to serve
their cause would be to dissociate
themselves in a loud and positive
fashion from the destroyers, and
from those who incite others to
perform violent acts. The
destructive types include several
who have violated existing laws,
and who should be called to task
for their actions in accordance
with due process of law. Their
separation from the movement
would allow the latter to continue
in a more effective manner on a
law-abiding basis. There is no
reason why the group could not
pursue a spectrum of legal
educational and political activities
associated with the ROTC issue,
including meaningful dialogue
between persons of differing
persuasions.
Freedom in a democratic
society is a delicate treasure.
Academic freedom is no less
fragile and must never be taken
for granted. The Stanford
community cannot pursue its
basic educational and scholarly
functions successfully without it.
The many changes which the
University has made and must
continue to make in a changing
world require a full measure of
freedom as well. Disruption and
vandalism are coercive in nature,
and therefore are completely
unacceptable. Violent acts cannot
be allowed to serve as an outlet
for the frustrations of the
Off-ROTC movement or any
other group. It matters not
whether the frustrations are
caused by disagreement with
government policies or by
unhappiness with results of recent
Stanford votes on the ROTC
issue. There can be no
compromise on the matter of
freedom on campus. OFF
VIOLENCE!

'Very Up - Tight'
To Whom It May Concern:
You will find me very up-tight
about the Stanford Revolutionary

group and their posturing. As best
I can understand myself, here is
why.
I feel threatened by the
potential for violence which this
group has brought to our campus.
There is an animal here. A hate
filled animal. A crazed animal that
gets its kicks from screaming foul
language, from smearing buildings
with paint, from breaking
windows, from burning.
I feel helpless before the
anonymity of this night-animal.
Its larger ravages are impossible to
prevent. We cannot guard against
it. Who can tell which twisted
lunatic set the fire which burned
the Behavioral Sciences Building?
Who burned President Sterling's
office? Who burned the ROTC
building?
I want this animal removed
from the Stanford campus. I want
it pursued and hounded by every
legal means. I want it isolated. I
want it starved of support.
To this end I begrudge every
scrap of legitimacy and every
morsel of support it receives, from
any source. I oppose every person
who defends it.
I'm through being detached
and intellectual about violence at
Stanford. I'm fed up with the
revolutionary egotist.
So - Don't talk to me about the
legitimacy of the sit-in. I HEAR
AN IMPLIED SUPPORT FOR
BURNING THE ROTC
BUILDINGS.
So - Don't talk to me about the
police using "unnecessary force."
I HEAR SUPPORT FOR THE
ANIMAL THAT BURNED
STERLING'S OFFICE.
So - Don't talk to me about
amnesty. I HEAR SUPPORT FOR
THE INSANE VIOLENCE THAT
SMASHED AND BURNED THE
BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
BUILDING.
If you want me to listen to
grievances that you feel are just,
then get rid of the lunatic addicts
of arson and vandalism. As long as
the stench of burning and the
threat of further violence hangs
over this campus I'm not
interested in your cute little, hair
splitting arguments.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The Off-ROTC movement loses
credibility when that group
becomes a party to campus
pollution resulting from vandalism
such as rock throwing, paint
spattering or fire bombing. If it is
not a party to such repulsive acts,
let it say so for all to hear. Several
of the sit-in persons with whom I
talked on April 23 shrugged off
the destructive nature of such
actions as being trivial compared
to the violent events in Vietnam.
Clearly, a similar argument could
be used to support damage to any
kind of property, e.g., such
personal items as original
manuscripts.
The destruction which we have
seen at Stanford reflects, I believe,
the underlying modus operandi of
some hard-core leaders whose aim

is to radicalize as many people as
possible. It would appear that
they wish to destroy the fabric of
our present society, making
generous use of violence as a
technique. The ROTC issue just
happens to be a suitable current
vehicle for their missionary
purpose. Others can be introduced
as needed, no doubt. Their
pronouncements also show a
contempt for basic democratic
processes of our political system,
and they have, evidently, little
patience for the discipline of
systematic intense study which is
a necessary base for the
intellectual freedom enjoyed by
the mature scholar.
Although its destructive acts on
campus have tainted the
Off-ROTC movement, there must
be within that organization a
substantial sub-group opposed to
vandalism and violence. The best
way for those people to serve
their cause would be to dissociate
themselves in a loud and positive
fashion from the destroyers, and
from those who incite others to
perform violent acts. The
destructive types include several
who have violated existing laws,
and who should be called to task
for their actions in accordance
with due process of law. Their
separation from the movement
would allow the latter to continue
in a more effective manner on a
law-abiding basis. There is no
reason why the group could not
pursue a spectrum of legal
educational and political activities
associated with the ROTC issue,
including meaningful dialogue
between persons of differing
persuasions.
Freedom in a democratic
society is a delicate treasure.
Academic freedom is no less
fragile and must never be taken
for granted. The Stanford
community cannot pursue its
basic educational and scholarly
functions successfully without it.
The many changes which the
University has made and must
continue to make in a changing
world require a full measure of
freedom as well. Disruption and
vandalism are coercive in nature,
and therefore are completely
unacceptable. Violent acts cannot
be allowed to serve as an outlet
for the frustrations of the
Off-ROTC movement or any
other group. It matters not
whether the frustrations are
caused by disagreement with
government policies or by
unhappiness with results of recent
Stanford votes on the ROTC
issue. There can be no
compromise on the matter of
freedom on campus. OFF
VIOLENCE!

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE
STANFORD COMMUNITY:
Let Us Change The Climate
of Violence
In the pre-dawn hours of
Friday, April 24, 1970, a fire
set by as yet unknown
arsonists destroyed or damaged
ten offices of the Center for
Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at
Stanford. The life work of
Prof. M.N. Srinivas, a
distinguished Indian
anthropologist who is spending
a year at the Center on leave
from the University of Delhi,
was destroyed: research notes
embodying the work of over
twenty years were ravaged.
Professor Srinivas' magnum
opus was to have been a study
of the Indian caste system
Manuscripts and research
notes of several other scholars
were lost or damaged,
including some materials
belonging to Professor Sol Tax
of the University of Chicago, a
noted champion of the rights
of American Indians in
contemporary U.S. society.
The lives of two student
caretakers sleeping in a
building which narrowly
escaped being engulfed in the
flames were jeopardized.
Physical damage to the Center
is estimated at close to
$100,000.
We are deeply concerned
that this fire may have been
related to the escalating
climate of violence on campus
in recent weeks. We
unequivocally support peaceful
protest. However, we believe
that recent protest activities on
campus have passed these
bounds into dangerous levels of

I can understand myself, here is
why.
I feel threatened by the
potential for violence which this
group has brought to our campus.
There is an animal here. A hate
filled animal. A crazed animal that
gets its kicks from screaming foul
language, from smearing buildings
with paint, from breaking
windows, from burning.
I feel helpless before the
anonymity of this night-animal.
Its larger ravages are impossible to
prevent. We cannot guard against
it. Who can tell which twisted
lunatic set the fire which burned
the Behavioral Sciences Building?
Who burned President Sterling's
office? Who burned the ROTC
building?
I want this animal removed
from the Stanford campus. I want
it pursued and hounded by every
legal means. I want it isolated. I
want it starved of support.
To this end I begrudge every
scrap of legitimacy and every
morsel of support it receives, from
any source. I oppose every person
who defends it.
I'm through being detached
and intellectual about violence at
Stanford. I'm fed up with the
revolutionary egotist.
So - Don't talk to me about the
legitimacy of the sit-in. I HEAR
AN IMPLIED SUPPORT FOR
BURNING THE ROTC
BUILDINGS.
So - Don't talk to me about the
police using "unnecessary force."
I HEAR SUPPORT FOR THE
ANIMAL THAT BURNED
STERLING'S OFFICE.
So - Don't talk to me about
amnesty. I HEAR SUPPORT FOR
THE INSANE VIOLENCE THAT
SMASHED AND BURNED THE
BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
BUILDING.
If you want me to listen to
grievances that you feel are just,
then get rid of the lunatic addicts
of arson and vandalism. As long as
the stench of burning and the
threat of further violence hangs
over this campus I'm not
interested in your cute little, hair
splitting arguments.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The Off-ROTC movement loses
credibility when that group
becomes a party to campus
pollution resulting from vandalism
such as rock throwing, paint
spattering or fire bombing. If it is
not a party to such repulsive acts,
let it say so for all to hear. Several
of the sit-in persons with whom I
talked on April 23 shrugged off
the destructive nature of such
actions as being trivial compared
to the violent events in Vietnam.
Clearly, a similar argument could
be used to support damage to any
kind of property, e.g., such
personal items as original
manuscripts.
The destruction which we have
seen at Stanford reflects, I believe,
the underlying modus operandi of
some hard-core leaders whose aim

is to radicalize as many people as
possible. It would appear that
they wish to destroy the fabric of
our present society, making
generous use of violence as a
technique. The ROTC issue just
happens to be a suitable current
vehicle for their missionary
purpose. Others can be introduced
as needed, no doubt. Their
pronouncements also show a
contempt for basic democratic
processes of our political system,
and they have, evidently, little
patience for the discipline of
systematic intense study which is
a necessary base for the
intellectual freedom enjoyed by
the mature scholar.
Although its destructive acts on
campus have tainted the
Off-ROTC movement, there must
be within that organization a
substantial sub-group opposed to
vandalism and violence. The best
way for those people to serve
their cause would be to dissociate
themselves in a loud and positive
fashion from the destroyers, and
from those who incite others to
perform violent acts. The
destructive types include several
who have violated existing laws,
and who should be called to task
for their actions in accordance
with due process of law. Their
separation from the movement
would allow the latter to continue
in a more effective manner on a
law-abiding basis. There is no
reason why the group could not
pursue a spectrum of legal
educational and political activities
associated with the ROTC issue,
including meaningful dialogue
between persons of differing
persuasions.
Freedom in a democratic
society is a delicate treasure.
Academic freedom is no less
fragile and must never be taken
for granted. The Stanford
community cannot pursue its
basic educational and scholarly
functions successfully without it.
The many changes which the
University has made and must
continue to make in a changing
world require a full measure of
freedom as well. Disruption and
vandalism are coercive in nature,
and therefore are completely
unacceptable. Violent acts cannot
be allowed to serve as an outlet
for the frustrations of the
Off-ROTC movement or any
other group. It matters not
whether the frustrations are
caused by disagreement with
government policies or by
unhappiness with results of recent
Stanford votes on the ROTC
issue. There can be no
compromise on the matter of
freedom on campus. OFF
VIOLENCE!

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE
STANFORD COMMUNITY:
Let Us Change The Climate
of Violence
In the pre-dawn hours of
Friday, April 24, 1970, a fire
set by as yet unknown
arsonists destroyed or damaged
ten offices of the Center for
Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at
Stanford. The life work of
Prof. M.N. Srinivas, a
distinguished Indian
anthropologist who is spending
a year at the Center on leave
from the University of Delhi,
was destroyed: research notes
embodying the work of over
twenty years were ravaged.
Professor Srinivas' magnum
opus was to have been a study
of the Indian caste system
Manuscripts and research
notes of several other scholars
were lost or damaged,
including some materials
belonging to Professor Sol Tax
of the University of Chicago, a
noted champion of the rights
of American Indians in
contemporary U.S. society.
The lives of two student
caretakers sleeping in a
building which narrowly
escaped being engulfed in the
flames were jeopardized.
Physical damage to the Center
is estimated at close to
$100,000.
We are deeply concerned
that this fire may have been
related to the escalating
climate of violence on campus
in recent weeks. We
unequivocally support peaceful
protest. However, we believe
that recent protest activities on
campus have passed these
bounds into dangerous levels of
violence and threats of further
violence. We are deeply
worried that an occasional
violence-prone person may
interpret the advocacy of
"mobile militant tactics" in
such ways as to include cruel
acts like the burning of the
* Center.
We hope that the Off-ROTC
Movement shares the sorrow
and outrage of the Stanford
* community at this tragic
occurrence and we call upon
them to express themselves at
this time.

The Off-ROTC movement loses
credibility when that group
becomes a party to campus
pollution resulting from vandalism
such as rock throwing, paint
spattering or fire bombing. If it is
not a party to such repulsive acts,
let it say so for all to hear. Several
of the sit-in persons with whom I
talked on April 23 shrugged off
the destructive nature of such
actions as being trivial compared
to the violent events in Vietnam.
Clearly, a similar argument could
be used to support damage to any
kind of property, e.g., such
personal items as original
manuscripts.
The destruction which we have
seen at Stanford reflects, I believe,
the underlying modus operandi of
some hard-core leaders whose aim

is to radicalize as many people as
possible. It would appear that
they wish to destroy the fabric of
our present society, making
generous use of violence as a
technique. The ROTC issue just
happens to be a suitable current
vehicle for their missionary
purpose. Others can be introduced
as needed, no doubt. Their
pronouncements also show a
contempt for basic democratic
processes of our political system,
and they have, evidently, little
patience for the discipline of
systematic intense study which is
a necessary base for the
intellectual freedom enjoyed by
the mature scholar.
Although its destructive acts on
campus have tainted the
Off-ROTC movement, there must
be within that organization a
substantial sub-group opposed to
vandalism and violence. The best
way for those people to serve
their cause would be to dissociate
themselves in a loud and positive
fashion from the destroyers, and
from those who incite others to
perform violent acts. The
destructive types include several
who have violated existing laws,
and who should be called to task
for their actions in accordance
with due process of law. Their
separation from the movement
would allow the latter to continue
in a more effective manner on a
law-abiding basis. There is no
reason why the group could not
pursue a spectrum of legal
educational and political activities
associated with the ROTC issue,
including meaningful dialogue
between persons of differing
persuasions.
Freedom in a democratic
society is a delicate treasure.
Academic freedom is no less
fragile and must never be taken
for granted. The Stanford
community cannot pursue its
basic educational and scholarly
functions successfully without it.
The many changes which the
University has made and must
continue to make in a changing
world require a full measure of
freedom as well. Disruption and
vandalism are coercive in nature,
and therefore are completely
unacceptable. Violent acts cannot
be allowed to serve as an outlet
for the frustrations of the
Off-ROTC movement or any
other group. It matters not
whether the frustrations are
caused by disagreement with
government policies or by
unhappiness with results of recent
Stanford votes on the ROTC
issue. There can be no
compromise on the matter of
freedom on campus. OFF
VIOLENCE!

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE
STANFORD COMMUNITY:
Let Us Change The Climate
of Violence
In the pre-dawn hours of
Friday, April 24, 1970, a fire
set by as yet unknown
arsonists destroyed or damaged
ten offices of the Center for
Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at
Stanford. The life work of
Prof. M.N. Srinivas, a
distinguished Indian
anthropologist who is spending
a year at the Center on leave
from the University of Delhi,
was destroyed: research notes
embodying the work of over
twenty years were ravaged.
Professor Srinivas' magnum
opus was to have been a study
of the Indian caste system
Manuscripts and research
notes of several other scholars
were lost or damaged,
including some materials
belonging to Professor Sol Tax
of the University of Chicago, a
noted champion of the rights
of American Indians in
contemporary U.S. society.
The lives of two student
caretakers sleeping in a
building which narrowly
escaped being engulfed in the
flames were jeopardized.
Physical damage to the Center
is estimated at close to
$100,000.
We are deeply concerned
that this fire may have been
related to the escalating
climate of violence on campus
in recent weeks. We
unequivocally support peaceful
protest. However, we believe
that recent protest activities on
campus have passed these
bounds into dangerous levels of
violence and threats of further
violence. We are deeply
worried that an occasional
violence-prone person may
interpret the advocacy of
"mobile militant tactics" in
such ways as to include cruel
acts like the burning of the
* Center.
We hope that the Off-ROTC
Movement shares the sorrow
and outrage of the Stanford
* community at this tragic
occurrence and we call upon
them to express themselves at
this time.

'Very Up - Tight'
To Whom It May Concern:
You will find me very up-tight
about the Stanford Revolutionary

group and their posturing. As best
I can understand myself, here is
why.
I feel threatened by the
potential for violence which this
group has brought to our campus.
There is an animal here. A hate
filled animal. A crazed animal that
gets its kicks from screaming foul
language, from smearing buildings
with paint, from breaking
windows, from burning.
I feel helpless before the
anonymity of this night-animal.
Its larger ravages are impossible to
prevent. We cannot guard against
it. Who can tell which twisted
lunatic set the fire which burned
the Behavioral Sciences Building?
Who burned President Sterling's
office? Who burned the ROTC
building?
I want this animal removed
from the Stanford campus. I want
it pursued and hounded by every
legal means. I want it isolated. I
want it starved of support.
To this end I begrudge every
scrap of legitimacy and every
morsel of support it receives, from
any source. I oppose every person
who defends it.
I'm through being detached
and intellectual about violence at
Stanford. I'm fed up with the
revolutionary egotist.
So - Don't talk to me about the
legitimacy of the sit-in. I HEAR
AN IMPLIED SUPPORT FOR
BURNING THE ROTC
BUILDINGS.
So - Don't talk to me about the
police using "unnecessary force."
I HEAR SUPPORT FOR THE
ANIMAL THAT BURNED
STERLING'S OFFICE.
So - Don't talk to me about
amnesty. I HEAR SUPPORT FOR
THE INSANE VIOLENCE THAT
SMASHED AND BURNED THE
BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
BUILDING.
If you want me to listen to
grievances that you feel are just,
then get rid of the lunatic addicts
of arson and vandalism. As long as
the stench of burning and the
threat of further violence hangs
over this campus I'm not
interested in your cute little, hair
