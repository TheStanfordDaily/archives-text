# One Man's Fantasy
## Tennis Balls & Revolution 
### Nick Selby 
You might be interested to know that I have
put myself "in training" for the Wimbleton tennis
championships. This is no idle fantasy, no court
daydream; I do not joke with you lightly.
Tennis, as you all know, is a very demanding
sport. In order to achieve the success that keeps
one from throwing his racket over the wire
backstop, one needs the indomitable spirit of an
eagle, the keen eyes of a hawk, the lightning speed
of a falcon, and the cagy wariness of an owl.
Lacking all of these prerequisites, it is amazing
to reflect on my remarkable resemblance to a bird.
Trotting about in my white shorts, proudly
wearing a Stanford sweatshirt, I look like
television's "Super Chicken" without his cape.
But I warn you, beware of my seeming
unco-ordination. My ineptitude is a secret weapon.
While you are laughing so hard that you can barely
stand, I may just get one over the net. Then what
would you do?
Getting Better AH the Time
Moreover, I am getting better every day. With
the first glimmer of light over the hills across the
bay, I leap from beneath my electric blanket and
jog on over to the courts. I get so anxious each
night that I sleep in my "sneakers," or, as they are
known on the West coast, my "tennis shoes."
With that "Stanford" emblazoned across my
chest, I hold my head high as I sprint past the
paper boys and milkmen on my way to these
practice session. I have even seen them shake with
fear at my approach as I brandish my racket.
I do not practice against the concrete
backboard along the old basketball pavilion. Far
from it—mine is no easy combat. There to meet
me every crack-of-dawn is fearless Horace, my
coach, my confessor, my spirit-lifter.
Good Old Horace!
I hope you have not forgotten about good old
Horace. Only a week or so ago, I wrote you of his
Promethean efforts to shed the acres of Hab about
his midriff. I am happy to report substantial
progress—twelve pounds! He is now lean and
mean, merciless on the courts, and just about
ready for the Wimbleton affair.
Horace and I will play doubles together in
England—being close friends, we simply could not
bear to face each other in the finals, especially
with the whole world watching via satellite. One of
us would "throw" the match to prevent a useless
marathon contest.
But lacking any foes yet courageous enough to
battle us as a duo, we play against each other in
the morning. Horace's wife Carolyn serves as our
"ballboy," for real pros never lower themselves so

much as to pick up a tennis ball. That would be
too great an assault on our pride.
A Decision to Act
After a few brisk rallies, we are ready to start.
It is "heads-or-tails" as to who will triumph, and
the betting among the groundskeepers is
reportedly very heavy. So far, the tally sheet
records one-and-a-half sets for Horace, and zero
for me.
Never have you seen anything so graceful as
Horace digging into the asphalt to return a low
smash to his backhand! And when I charge to the
net to "powder" one of his lobs, you imagine you
are witnessing the redwoods walk. You see, my
thighs are still a bit soft from the winter lay-off.
Religious scholars have told us that "All things
come to him who waits." A television commercial
states that "They also serve (no pun intended)
who sit and wait." But Horace and I are young
men on the go, impaLient for acclaim and renown.
Unable to sit around the dinner table any
longer, we seized our rackets and decided to act.
Pardon the phrase, but we actually decided to "Do
it!", not "in the road," but on the court.
The Need For Faith
In this age of disbelief and healthy despair,
Horace and I exist solely on faith, curried shrimp,
and tennis balls. Our faith is the traditional type,
the kind that moves mountains and aces a serve.
We shall "keep the faith (baby)" until Queen
Elizabeth awards us our trophies.
How many of you have as strong a faith? Do
you think it will be easy to get rid of Richard
Nixon, to end the war? Do you suppose it will be
easy to kick ROTC off campus? How long will it
take before we see a true change in even our own
values? I can't even give up smoking, even in my
ardent desire to conquer at Wimbleton, so how can
I expect you to sacrifice your stereos and
Mustangs?
Someday, miracles shall be commonplace:
Horace and I will triumph, the "Southern
strategy" will wallow in defeat.
Like a tennis ball, one moment I am on one side
of the net (barricade), another moment I am on
the other. But I am keeping the faith. For, years
from now, writing of this gentle game, historians
shall assert:
"The battle of the streets, the dinosaurs'
Waterloo, was decided on the courts at
Wimbleton." The impossible is possible.
Revolution anyone?
