# Pauling Favors Sit-In At Noon Boycott Rally
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
"Immoral institutions have no
place on campus," said Nobel
Peace Laureate Linus Pauling
addressing a noon-time off-ROTC
rally in White Plaza. "You must
continue your protests against
ROTC on campus."
"Do not be tricked into
violence," he warned. "The
Establishment is glad when there
is violence for it gives them an
excuse for suppression."
"I am in favor of a sit-in," he
added.
A large crowd heard Rmling in
tone, "There is a great evil
rampant in the world today, the
evil of militarism. The
Pentagon-CIA-Defense
Contractor-Politician complex is
getting a stranglehold on the
country. Never before has the
U.S. been in such danger of
dictatorship."
Small Steps
"A small step in the direction
of a better world, a world free of
the stranglehold of militarism, will
be to rid the campus of ROTC."
Pauling continued to urge that
the Movement enter negotiations
with the administration to remove
ROTC. His suggestion of June
1971 as a target date visibly
disappointed his listeners.
The rally was capped by the
appearance of the Stanford
Disruption Theater with a skit
"Alice in ROTC land "
Liberation College
Several dozen people attended
classes at Liberation College
yesterday in the Old Union
courtyard. Only three of the
announced eight morning classes
actually met.

Paul Rupert's class entitled
"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Court,"
was held on the Stanford golf
course, just over the Santa Clara
county line. Rupert has been
banished from Santa Clara county
as part of his sentence for refusing
induction.
The spreading was in South
East Asia was the focus for early
afternoon activities at Liberation
College, as Banning Garrett and
Jim Shoch led a discussion on the
possibilities for greater US
involvement in Cambodia and
Laos. Garrett contended the
reports of a North Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia may well be
a set-up to justify further US
intervention.
Presidential Statements
The newly elected ASSU
council of presidents yesterday
issued a statement rejecting the
off ROTC Movement on the
grounds that it has rejected the
majority decision of the ROTC
referendum, by-passed channels
and threatened the integrity of
academic decision-making groups.
"We reject all groups which
foster disruptive sit-ins smashing
windows, or other forms of
violence. Any person or persons
resorting to these actions must be
subject to arrest and prosecution
if the safety and autonomy of the
University are to be maintained.
We cannot tolerate violence on
campus regardless of the cause."
The council advocated
alternative actions such as
focusing attention on the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies which is to determine
whether ROTC will receive credit
as an Undergraduate Special next

year, or putting pressure on the
Advisory Committee on ROTC.
In its Wednesday meeting, the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs delineated the
four issues which it plans to
investigate: 1) the punitive clause,
2) evaluation criteria for the new
Army plan, 3) other possible
ROTC arrangements for 1971-72
and thereafter, and 4) review of
Navy and Air Force proposals if
submitted.
The committee is anxious to
obtain written opinions of all
groups and persons before
formulating its recommendations
Statements may be addressed to
the committee, P.O. Box 2329.
Those who wish to testify should
submit a summary of their
testimony to the committee by
May 5.

Presidential Statements
The newly elected ASSU
council of presidents yesterday
issued a statement rejecting the
off ROTC Movement on the
grounds that it has rejected the
majority decision of the ROTC
referendum, by-passed channels
and threatened the integrity of
academic decision-making groups.
"We reject all groups which
foster disruptive sit-ins smashing
windows, or other forms of
violence. Any person or persons
resorting to these actions must be
subject to arrest and prosecution
if the safety and autonomy of the
University are to be maintained.
We cannot tolerate violence on
campus regardless of the cause."
The council advocated
alternative actions such as
focusing attention on the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies which is to determine
whether ROTC will receive credit
as an Undergraduate Special next

year, or putting pressure on the
Advisory Committee on ROTC.
In its Wednesday meeting, the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs delineated the
four issues which it plans to
investigate: 1) the punitive clause,
2) evaluation criteria for the new
Army plan, 3) other possible
ROTC arrangements for 1971-72
and thereafter, and 4) review of
Navy and Air Force proposals if
submitted.
The committee is anxious to
obtain written opinions of all
groups and persons before
formulating its recommendations
Statements may be addressed to
the committee, P.O. Box 2329.
Those who wish to testify should
submit a summary of their
testimony to the committee by
May 5.


ALICE IN ROTC-LAND — Members of the Disruptions Theater presented
"Alice in ROTC-Land," their original skit, on White Plaza at lunchtime. It will
also be played tonight after dinner on the Wilbur playing fields.
"Immoral institutions have no
place on campus," said Nobel
Peace Laureate Linus Pauling
addressing a noon-time off-ROTC
rally in White Plaza. "You must
continue your protests against
ROTC on campus."
"Do not be tricked into
violence," he warned. "The
Establishment is glad when there
is violence for it gives them an
excuse for suppression."
"I am in favor of a sit-in," he
added.
A large crowd heard Rmling in
tone, "There is a great evil
rampant in the world today, the
evil of militarism. The
Pentagon-CIA-Defense
Contractor-Politician complex is
getting a stranglehold on the
country. Never before has the
U.S. been in such danger of
dictatorship."
Small Steps
"A small step in the direction
of a better world, a world free of
the stranglehold of militarism, will
be to rid the campus of ROTC."
Pauling continued to urge that
the Movement enter negotiations
with the administration to remove
ROTC. His suggestion of June
1971 as a target date visibly
disappointed his listeners.
The rally was capped by the
appearance of the Stanford
Disruption Theater with a skit
"Alice in ROTC land "
Liberation College
Several dozen people attended
classes at Liberation College
yesterday in the Old Union
courtyard. Only three of the
announced eight morning classes
actually met.

Paul Rupert's class entitled
"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Court,"
was held on the Stanford golf
course, just over the Santa Clara
county line. Rupert has been
banished from Santa Clara county
as part of his sentence for refusing
induction.
The spreading was in South
East Asia was the focus for early
afternoon activities at Liberation
College, as Banning Garrett and
Jim Shoch led a discussion on the
possibilities for greater US
involvement in Cambodia and
Laos. Garrett contended the
reports of a North Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia may well be
a set-up to justify further US
intervention.
