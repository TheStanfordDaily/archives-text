## KZSU Edit And Reply 
### 
(The following KZSU editorial
was delivered on April 23.)
In the KZSU newscasts of the
last two evenings, reports have
been made of the news staff's
investigation into the appearance
Tuesday (April 21), and again
today, of a bogus issue of the
ARENA. We feel that it is now
time, given the facts in hand, to
attempt to draw a few conclusions
from the circumstances
surrounding the appearance of
this paper.
First, it is obvious that in their
treatment of the story the
Stanford Daily was guilty of
extreme journalistic
irresponsibility. In the Daily
stories of yesterday and today
attempts were made to place the
entire blame for the false ARENA
on David Swift. There is no doubt
that Swift is to some degree
responsible for the appearance of
the paper, but, as KZSU has
pointed out, he shares that
responsibility with others,
including Yale Braunstein, who
signed the purchase order for the
printing of the paper, and John
Shoch, who helped in the
photography.
Also participating in the
preparation and distribution of
the paper, as KZSU learned last

night, was Daily managing editor
Jim Perloff. The Daily staff, then,
knew who was involved in the
preparation of the paper, but
chose to limit their assignation of
responsibility to David Swift. Why
was this choice made? John Shoch
was editorially endorsed by the
Daily for the ASSU presidency.
As will be explained shortly,
the contents of the bogus ARENA
are favorable to Shoch's
candidacy; however, the cost of
two runs of the paper would alone
exceed the $200 limit on
expenditures in presidential
campaigns. It is probable that the
Daily did not report Shoch's
participation in the bogus
ARENA to protect him from
charges of over-running his
campaign expenditures—in short,
the Stanford Daily allowed its
editorial opinion to grossly affect
its presentation of an important
news story.
The second question this
editorial addresses itself to is that
of over-run of campaign
expenditures. It is a moot point to
ask how MANY people were
duped into believing the real
ARENA had endorsed write-ins
for Hukari on the run-off, and
attacked the slate of Pat C.
Shea—actions ultimately favorable
to the Shoch candidacy.

The point is that this is a very
plausible interpretation of the
existence of the bogus ARENA,
and is supported by the
documented participation of John
Shoch in its preparation, and the
activity of the Daily is suppressing
this information. Even though
John Shoch has lost the election,
this is not an academic issue.
Violations of campaign
regulations cannot be tacitly
condoned because they occurred
in a losing cause.
The final question concerns the
rights of the ARENA—the real
ARENA, published by
conservative students on campus.
Last quarter, KZSU strongly
criticized the journalistic excesses
of the ARENA. At the same time,
however, the station then
maintained that the ARENA has a
right to exist. We maintain this
today, and add a qualifier—the
ARENA specifically has a right to
exist without various persons
appropriating their logo and
format without permission.
Conservative students are an
unpopular minority at Stanford,
and perhaps deservedly so. Still,
unpopular minorities deserve the
highest level of protection of their
rights. It is also worthy to note
that the complicity of the Daily in
denying the ARENA their right to
unmolested publication is a rather
1 explicit violation of journalistic
ethics.

(The following is a reply to
KZSU's editorial.)
To speak of journalistic
irresponsibility and not to
mention the ARENA is gross
intellectual irresponsibility. It was
the ARENA which has
campaigned for the Free Campus
Movement's 'Liberty' Amendment
since the beginning of the year,
yet we hear few complaints that
the supporters of the referendum
overspent their $35 allowance, as
they surely did. KZSU neglected
to point out that it was the
ARENA which libelously attacked
John Shoch on election day.
It's article on Shoch used
methods which 'are more than
faintly reminiscent of Joe
McCarthy: guilt by association,
the Big Lie, and radical baiting.
But by pointing out well know
facets of the ARENA'S
irresponsibility does not acquit
the Daily of the charges leveled
against it. A simple repetition of
the facts does this well enough.
Fact: Shoch was only
marginally connected with the
publication of the ARENA. Yale
Braunstein and I did most of the
journalistic work.
Fact: it never entered the mind
of anyone working on the parody
that any Stanford student could
be so stupid as to believe that the
editorial was real. It is filled with
not so subtle attacks on the real
ARENA and its paronoid style.
Fact: it has never been a secret
who was involved in it. All of us
have openly admitted our roles.
What kind of coverup is it when
everyone in the Shea camp, the
ASSU executive, and on the
ARENA knows who. is involved?
The bogus ARENA is campaign
literature only to those naive
enough to believe that the
ARENA would attack itself in its
editorial and throughout its
columns. Are Stanford students
that stupid? Only rightwingers
and supporters of Pat C. Shea
think so. We at the Daily don't.

the ARENA which has
campaigned for the Free Campus
Movement's 'Liberty' Amendment
since the beginning of the year,
yet we hear few complaints that
the supporters of the referendum
overspent their $35 allowance, as
they surely did. KZSU neglected
to point out that it was the
ARENA which libelously attacked
John Shoch on election day.
It's article on Shoch used
methods which 'are more than
faintly reminiscent of Joe
McCarthy: guilt by association,
the Big Lie, and radical baiting.
But by pointing out well know
facets of the ARENA'S
irresponsibility does not acquit
the Daily of the charges leveled
against it. A simple repetition of
the facts does this well enough.
Fact: Shoch was only
marginally connected with the
publication of the ARENA. Yale
Braunstein and I did most of the
journalistic work.
Fact: it never entered the mind
of anyone working on the parody
that any Stanford student could
be so stupid as to believe that the
editorial was real. It is filled with
not so subtle attacks on the real
ARENA and its paronoid style.
Fact: it has never been a secret
who was involved in it. All of us
have openly admitted our roles.
What kind of coverup is it when
everyone in the Shea camp, the
ASSU executive, and on the
ARENA knows who. is involved?
The bogus ARENA is campaign
literature only to those naive
enough to believe that the
ARENA would attack itself in its
editorial and throughout its
columns. Are Stanford students
that stupid? Only rightwingers
and supporters of Pat C. Shea
think so. We at the Daily don't.
J.W.P.
(The following KZSU editorial
was delivered on April 23.)
In the KZSU newscasts of the
last two evenings, reports have
been made of the news staff's
investigation into the appearance
Tuesday (April 21), and again
today, of a bogus issue of the
ARENA. We feel that it is now
time, given the facts in hand, to
attempt to draw a few conclusions
from the circumstances
surrounding the appearance of
this paper.
First, it is obvious that in their
treatment of the story the
Stanford Daily was guilty of
extreme journalistic
irresponsibility. In the Daily
stories of yesterday and today
attempts were made to place the
entire blame for the false ARENA
on David Swift. There is no doubt
that Swift is to some degree
responsible for the appearance of
the paper, but, as KZSU has
pointed out, he shares that
responsibility with others,
including Yale Braunstein, who
signed the purchase order for the
printing of the paper, and John
Shoch, who helped in the
photography.
Also participating in the
preparation and distribution of
the paper, as KZSU learned last

night, was Daily managing editor
Jim Perloff. The Daily staff, then,
knew who was involved in the
preparation of the paper, but
chose to limit their assignation of
responsibility to David Swift. Why
was this choice made? John Shoch
was editorially endorsed by the
Daily for the ASSU presidency.
As will be explained shortly,
the contents of the bogus ARENA
are favorable to Shoch's
candidacy; however, the cost of
two runs of the paper would alone
exceed the $200 limit on
expenditures in presidential
campaigns. It is probable that the
Daily did not report Shoch's
participation in the bogus
ARENA to protect him from
charges of over-running his
campaign expenditures—in short,
the Stanford Daily allowed its
editorial opinion to grossly affect
its presentation of an important
news story.
The second question this
editorial addresses itself to is that
of over-run of campaign
expenditures. It is a moot point to
ask how MANY people were
duped into believing the real
ARENA had endorsed write-ins
for Hukari on the run-off, and
attacked the slate of Pat C.
Shea—actions ultimately favorable
to the Shoch candidacy.

The point is that this is a very
plausible interpretation of the
existence of the bogus ARENA,
and is supported by the
documented participation of John
Shoch in its preparation, and the
activity of the Daily is suppressing
this information. Even though
John Shoch has lost the election,
this is not an academic issue.
Violations of campaign
regulations cannot be tacitly
condoned because they occurred
in a losing cause.
The final question concerns the
rights of the ARENA—the real
ARENA, published by
conservative students on campus.
Last quarter, KZSU strongly
criticized the journalistic excesses
of the ARENA. At the same time,
however, the station then
maintained that the ARENA has a
right to exist. We maintain this
today, and add a qualifier—the
ARENA specifically has a right to
exist without various persons
appropriating their logo and
format without permission.
Conservative students are an
unpopular minority at Stanford,
and perhaps deservedly so. Still,
unpopular minorities deserve the
highest level of protection of their
rights. It is also worthy to note
that the complicity of the Daily in
denying the ARENA their right to
unmolested publication is a rather
1 explicit violation of journalistic
ethics.

for Hukari on the run-off, and
attacked the slate of Pat C.
Shea—actions ultimately favorable
to the Shoch candidacy.

The point is that this is a very
plausible interpretation of the
existence of the bogus ARENA,
and is supported by the
documented participation of John
Shoch in its preparation, and the
activity of the Daily is suppressing
this information. Even though
John Shoch has lost the election,
this is not an academic issue.
Violations of campaign
regulations cannot be tacitly
condoned because they occurred
in a losing cause.
The final question concerns the
rights of the ARENA—the real
ARENA, published by
conservative students on campus.
Last quarter, KZSU strongly
criticized the journalistic excesses
of the ARENA. At the same time,
however, the station then
maintained that the ARENA has a
right to exist. We maintain this
today, and add a qualifier—the
ARENA specifically has a right to
exist without various persons
appropriating their logo and
format without permission.
Conservative students are an
unpopular minority at Stanford,
and perhaps deservedly so. Still,
unpopular minorities deserve the
highest level of protection of their
rights. It is also worthy to note
that the complicity of the Daily in
denying the ARENA their right to
unmolested publication is a rather
1 explicit violation of journalistic
ethics.

(The following is a reply to
KZSU's editorial.)
To speak of journalistic
irresponsibility and not to
mention the ARENA is gross
intellectual irresponsibility. It was
the ARENA which has
campaigned for the Free Campus
Movement's 'Liberty' Amendment
since the beginning of the year,
yet we hear few complaints that
the supporters of the referendum
overspent their $35 allowance, as
they surely did. KZSU neglected
to point out that it was the
ARENA which libelously attacked
John Shoch on election day.
It's article on Shoch used
methods which 'are more than
faintly reminiscent of Joe
McCarthy: guilt by association,
the Big Lie, and radical baiting.
But by pointing out well know
facets of the ARENA'S
irresponsibility does not acquit
the Daily of the charges leveled
against it. A simple repetition of
the facts does this well enough.
Fact: Shoch was only
marginally connected with the
publication of the ARENA. Yale
Braunstein and I did most of the
journalistic work.
Fact: it never entered the mind
of anyone working on the parody
that any Stanford student could
be so stupid as to believe that the
editorial was real. It is filled with
not so subtle attacks on the real
ARENA and its paronoid style.
Fact: it has never been a secret
who was involved in it. All of us
have openly admitted our roles.
What kind of coverup is it when
everyone in the Shea camp, the
ASSU executive, and on the
ARENA knows who. is involved?
The bogus ARENA is campaign
literature only to those naive
enough to believe that the
ARENA would attack itself in its
editorial and throughout its
columns. Are Stanford students
that stupid? Only rightwingers
and supporters of Pat C. Shea
think so. We at the Daily don't.

(The following KZSU editorial
was delivered on April 23.)
In the KZSU newscasts of the
last two evenings, reports have
been made of the news staff's
investigation into the appearance
Tuesday (April 21), and again
today, of a bogus issue of the
ARENA. We feel that it is now
time, given the facts in hand, to
attempt to draw a few conclusions
from the circumstances
surrounding the appearance of
this paper.
First, it is obvious that in their
treatment of the story the
Stanford Daily was guilty of
extreme journalistic
irresponsibility. In the Daily
stories of yesterday and today
attempts were made to place the
entire blame for the false ARENA
on David Swift. There is no doubt
that Swift is to some degree
responsible for the appearance of
the paper, but, as KZSU has
pointed out, he shares that
responsibility with others,
including Yale Braunstein, who
signed the purchase order for the
printing of the paper, and John
Shoch, who helped in the
photography.
Also participating in the
preparation and distribution of
the paper, as KZSU learned last

night, was Daily managing editor
Jim Perloff. The Daily staff, then,
knew who was involved in the
preparation of the paper, but
chose to limit their assignation of
responsibility to David Swift. Why
was this choice made? John Shoch
was editorially endorsed by the
Daily for the ASSU presidency.
As will be explained shortly,
the contents of the bogus ARENA
are favorable to Shoch's
candidacy; however, the cost of
two runs of the paper would alone
exceed the $200 limit on
expenditures in presidential
campaigns. It is probable that the
Daily did not report Shoch's
participation in the bogus
ARENA to protect him from
charges of over-running his
campaign expenditures—in short,
the Stanford Daily allowed its
editorial opinion to grossly affect
its presentation of an important
news story.
The second question this
editorial addresses itself to is that
of over-run of campaign
expenditures. It is a moot point to
ask how MANY people were
duped into believing the real
ARENA had endorsed write-ins
for Hukari on the run-off, and
attacked the slate of Pat C.
Shea—actions ultimately favorable
to the Shoch candidacy.

The point is that this is a very
plausible interpretation of the
existence of the bogus ARENA,
and is supported by the
documented participation of John

activity of the Daily is suppressing
