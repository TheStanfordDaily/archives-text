# One Man's Fantasy
## The 						Word Game 
### Nick Selby 
His eyes were bloodshot with fatigue, and you imagined he might
begin crying in his readily-apparent grief. As he leaned against the wall
for support, you could see the taut lines of anger and despair etched
across his worn face.
It was three o'clock in the morning, shortly after the police had
interrupted the "disruption" at the Old Union. The fact that he was
an administrator added a special pathos to his sadness.
"I've lived in fear of these moments for the last two years," special
assistant to the president Willard Wyman confessed. Wyman, a former
associate dean of students, has given some final pointers to faculty
members observing the police, but refused to go with them himself.
"I just can't get involved in these confrontations any more," he
said. More sympathetic to the demonstrators and their concerns than
most administration officials, Wyman always found it a great personal
strain to 'discipline' students whose tactics he understood but
disagreed with. He refused to get involved in the crisis again.
Disgust lor Emotions
Nearby, one prominent radical "leader," flushed with the joy that
the evening's destruction had supplied for him, overheard Wyman's
seeming pleas for understanding. "Watch out," the radical warned me,
"his humanity is showing." Unfortunately, the radical was serious in
this disgust for Wyman's emotions.
It was precisely as if "being humane" had itself become the most
heinous crime in the radical 'penal code.' What a curious 'newspeak!'
A radical, presumably fighting for humanity in attempting to end
ROTC's training of "legal killers" for the military, was mocking an
expression of one man's humanity.
Prolonged involvement in a crisis situation begins to take a strange
toll on everyone close to the confrontation. Most curious of all is the
shift in the meaning of words. Old meanings change to reflect each
individual's personal prejudices, as each attempts to justify his "side."
The New Republic column "TRB" quotes the ancient Greek
historian Thucydides to illustrate this slide into linguistic ambiguity.
After five years of conflict between Athens and Sparta, Thucydides
noticed:
"Words began to change their ordinary meaning, and to take on
that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be
considered the courage of a loyal ally, prudent hesitation, specious
cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability
to see all sides of a question, inaptness to act on any. "
Is this not what has happened to Stanford after three years of
steadily escalating confrontation? Whether you are for ROTC or
against it (as I am), in the radical worldview the call for patience and
working through established channels is known as "cowardice" or
"liberal bullshit." Moderation and the feeling that it would have been
better to leave the Old Union when the building was closed, these are
known as fear and revanchism.
On the other side, the administration submits to the pressure of the
Pentagon, trustees, and alumni (the real outside agitators, to be sure)
while insisting it cannot yield to the wishes of the community here.
The faculty refuses to indicate the slightest interest in reviewing its
decision within the near future.
High school 'outsiders' become more dangerous than David
Packard, the most dangerous outside influence of all, so little does he
understand the true nature of the university. In the administration's
'newspeak,' one form of pressure is "legitimate," the other form
(miniscule compared to the violence of Vietnam) is outrageous
"coercion."
Closer to Chaos
Long ago, it seems, everyone forgot what language and words are
for, namely, the precise expression of feelings and thoughts. Now such
words as "law," "justice," "violence," "humanity," and "patience"
have lost all concrete meaning.
The speaker gives them whatever meaning he desires, whatever
their context permits. This ambiguity in language leads us closer to
chaos everyday, for it permits the insanity of pyromania, for example,
to pass as courage and "solidarity" with the peoples of the third
world.
We can no longer predict the exact consequences of anything we
do or say, for we cannot tell how others perceive our actions and
words. Few bother to take the time to explain themselves. Fewer still
care to listen. Anxiety and despair over the possible meaninglessness
of life, speech, and action grow daily.
Talk is not cheap. Words are not useless. Thought is not outmoded.
Forgive my "liberal" prejudices, but I prefer a war of words to a
conflict of guns.

The New Republic column "TRB" quotes the ancient Greek
historian Thucydides to illustrate this slide into linguistic ambiguity.
After five years of conflict between Athens and Sparta, Thucydides
noticed:
"Words began to change their ordinary meaning, and to take on
that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be
considered the courage of a loyal ally, prudent hesitation, specious
cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability
to see all sides of a question, inaptness to act on any. "
Is this not what has happened to Stanford after three years of
steadily escalating confrontation? Whether you are for ROTC or
against it (as I am), in the radical worldview the call for patience and
working through established channels is known as "cowardice" or
"liberal bullshit." Moderation and the feeling that it would have been
better to leave the Old Union when the building was closed, these are
known as fear and revanchism.
On the other side, the administration submits to the pressure of the
Pentagon, trustees, and alumni (the real outside agitators, to be sure)
while insisting it cannot yield to the wishes of the community here.
The faculty refuses to indicate the slightest interest in reviewing its
decision within the near future.
High school 'outsiders' become more dangerous than David
Packard, the most dangerous outside influence of all, so little does he
understand the true nature of the university. In the administration's
'newspeak,' one form of pressure is "legitimate," the other form
(miniscule compared to the violence of Vietnam) is outrageous
"coercion."
Closer to Chaos
Long ago, it seems, everyone forgot what language and words are
for, namely, the precise expression of feelings and thoughts. Now such
words as "law," "justice," "violence," "humanity," and "patience"
have lost all concrete meaning.
The speaker gives them whatever meaning he desires, whatever
their context permits. This ambiguity in language leads us closer to
chaos everyday, for it permits the insanity of pyromania, for example,
to pass as courage and "solidarity" with the peoples of the third
world.
We can no longer predict the exact consequences of anything we
do or say, for we cannot tell how others perceive our actions and
words. Few bother to take the time to explain themselves. Fewer still
care to listen. Anxiety and despair over the possible meaninglessness
of life, speech, and action grow daily.
Talk is not cheap. Words are not useless. Thought is not outmoded.
Forgive my "liberal" prejudices, but I prefer a war of words to a
conflict of guns.

week in the DAILY.)
His eyes were bloodshot with fatigue, and you imagined he might
begin crying in his readily-apparent grief. As he leaned against the wall
for support, you could see the taut lines of anger and despair etched
across his worn face.
It was three o'clock in the morning, shortly after the police had
interrupted the "disruption" at the Old Union. The fact that he was
an administrator added a special pathos to his sadness.
"I've lived in fear of these moments for the last two years," special
assistant to the president Willard Wyman confessed. Wyman, a former
associate dean of students, has given some final pointers to faculty
members observing the police, but refused to go with them himself.
"I just can't get involved in these confrontations any more," he
said. More sympathetic to the demonstrators and their concerns than
most administration officials, Wyman always found it a great personal
strain to 'discipline' students whose tactics he understood but
disagreed with. He refused to get involved in the crisis again.
Disgust lor Emotions
Nearby, one prominent radical "leader," flushed with the joy that
the evening's destruction had supplied for him, overheard Wyman's
seeming pleas for understanding. "Watch out," the radical warned me,
"his humanity is showing." Unfortunately, the radical was serious in
this disgust for Wyman's emotions.
It was precisely as if "being humane" had itself become the most
heinous crime in the radical 'penal code.' What a curious 'newspeak!'
A radical, presumably fighting for humanity in attempting to end
ROTC's training of "legal killers" for the military, was mocking an
expression of one man's humanity.
Prolonged involvement in a crisis situation begins to take a strange
