## Anti-Radicals Unite! 
### 
We have recently experienced damage to tins university to the tune
of some fifty or sixty thousand dollars which can be directly blamed
on student and non-student radicals. Another fifty to one hundred
thousand dollars worth of damage may be due to radical activity or
may not. This vandalism promises to continue, being temporarily set
aside in favor of less destructive tactics by a vote of 108 to 1 28.
Beyond this, two students have been beaten up unnecessarily by
"peaceful" demonstrators, and a camera has been smashed. I,
personally, have been threatened indirectly by three different people:
Art Busse ("I'll stop you first"), a white panther ("Harvey's boys will
get shot"), and Scott Johnson ("If you stay around here you'll get
your head busted"). In addition a building in which I was calmly
consuming Coors beer was firebombed from two sides at once, the
clear intent being to place flaming missiles through the windows both
upstairs (14 people present) and downstairs (a garage full of back
issues of the Arena).
All of the above demonstrations of peaceful good intent have been
perpetrated by the minority of students who feel that unless the
Stanford community will abide by their decisions that community
must be made to cease functioning. As many of the radicals, and
almost all of their leadership, have stated, ROTC is not the real issue.
As the radical leadership sees it, the university must either be halted
or turned into a training ground for revolutionaries.
Wishy-Wash) Liberals
This intended goal should render it clear to even the dullest of us
(Listen, you damn wishy-washy liberals!) that the real issue is the
integrity of the university itself. Most of the Liberation Conservatives
who make up the Free Campus Movement (FCM) are actively
opposing the destructive tactics of the radical group despite rather
than because of its thrust against ROTC. Most of us favor a voluntary
military with no recourse to the draft at all. We have been opposing
the violence of the extreme left (at some considerable risk to our
persons) because we feel quite deeply that it represents a series of
dagger thrusts at the heart of individual liberty. When the faculty,
administration, and trustees of this university are no longer allowed to
make the decisions governing it; when their rightful control is no
longer sacred, then we all must fear for our own rights to control
whatever it is that we own or hope to own.
More than control of material property, it is control of the
academic lives of faculty and students which the radicals hope to
seize. I don't know how you feel about the likes of Bruce Franklin
and Jim Shoch dictating "academic" policy to all of us in all
departments of the university, but the thought drives me out of my
tree (and into the streets). Of course I may be prejudiced, since Jim
once told me that people like myself would be shot one of these days
soon. It can be reasonably postulated that Jim has designs of that sort
on lots and lots of us. After all, aren't we tools of the imperialist
dinosaur?
Intent of Radicals
The point which I have tried to make above is that it is the
ultimate intent of the radicals to dictate to all of us in the academic
community precisely what our functions in society must be. This
totalitarian arrogance must be put down. It cannot be tolerated in a
company of free men. We cannot allow the terrorism to continue.
Particularly we cannot allow it to continue unhindered.
It is the place, perhaps the duty, of each citizen of this community
to step out of his or her (rightfully) self-serving world to confront the
radicals as they again attempt to ccntrol the decision making
processes of this community by the coercive actions which have so far
caused so much destruction. One cannot be free to conduct one's life
as one wishes when the radicals are dictating policy to all of us. If a
person wishes to retain what freedom there is to retain that person
must take his stand with the university. There is no way that the
terror can continue if the community is strongly against it. Control of
the situation here at Stanford could be easily achieved by fifty or
sixty individuals willing to give up a few evenings and some of their
(temporary) tranquility.
Destructive Cameras
This small number of people, with a few cameras, could, by
unfliching assertion of their rights to be anywhere on this campus
taking pictures, decrease the destruction to a fraction of what it has
been. No one is going to advocate rock throwing, much less do it, if
there are present persons who publicly and adamantly oppose such
behavior. None of the radical "leaders" are willing to accept the legal
consequences for their actions.
At the Old Union, the group made the conscious decision to
remain, in violation of the law after it was read to them by police. At
the same time they decided (by vote) to avoid the legal consequences
by flight should the police come.
What I am asking, then, is that a coalition of anti-radical leftists,
moderates, and rightists be formed for the purpose of confronting the
extremists with the real possibility of legal consequences for illegal
acts to be perpetrated upon the university.
I will establish a phone list for mobilization purposes. The cameras
are available. Call me at 321-2300 x3of>2 during the day and evenings.
Ask for Nomyar.

military with no recourse to the draft at all. We have been opposing
the violence of the extreme left (at some considerable risk to our
persons) because we feel quite deeply that it represents a series of
dagger thrusts at the heart of individual liberty. When the faculty,
administration, and trustees of this university are no longer allowed to
make the decisions governing it; when their rightful control is no
longer sacred, then we all must fear for our own rights to control
whatever it is that we own or hope to own.
More than control of material property, it is control of the
academic lives of faculty and students which the radicals hope to
seize. I don't know how you feel about the likes of Bruce Franklin
and Jim Shoch dictating "academic" policy to all of us in all
departments of the university, but the thought drives me out of my
tree (and into the streets). Of course I may be prejudiced, since Jim
once told me that people like myself would be shot one of these days
soon. It can be reasonably postulated that Jim has designs of that sort
on lots and lots of us. After all, aren't we tools of the imperialist
dinosaur?
Intent of Radicals
The point which I have tried to make above is that it is the
ultimate intent of the radicals to dictate to all of us in the academic
community precisely what our functions in society must be. This
totalitarian arrogance must be put down. It cannot be tolerated in a
company of free men. We cannot allow the terrorism to continue.
Particularly we cannot allow it to continue unhindered.
It is the place, perhaps the duty, of each citizen of this community
to step out of his or her (rightfully) self-serving world to confront the
radicals as they again attempt to ccntrol the decision making
processes of this community by the coercive actions which have so far
caused so much destruction. One cannot be free to conduct one's life
as one wishes when the radicals are dictating policy to all of us. If a
person wishes to retain what freedom there is to retain that person
must take his stand with the university. There is no way that the
terror can continue if the community is strongly against it. Control of
the situation here at Stanford could be easily achieved by fifty or
sixty individuals willing to give up a few evenings and some of their
(temporary) tranquility.
Destructive Cameras
This small number of people, with a few cameras, could, by
unfliching assertion of their rights to be anywhere on this campus
taking pictures, decrease the destruction to a fraction of what it has
been. No one is going to advocate rock throwing, much less do it, if
there are present persons who publicly and adamantly oppose such
behavior. None of the radical "leaders" are willing to accept the legal
consequences for their actions.
At the Old Union, the group made the conscious decision to
remain, in violation of the law after it was read to them by police. At
the same time they decided (by vote) to avoid the legal consequences
by flight should the police come.
What I am asking, then, is that a coalition of anti-radical leftists,
moderates, and rightists be formed for the purpose of confronting the
extremists with the real possibility of legal consequences for illegal
acts to be perpetrated upon the university.
I will establish a phone list for mobilization purposes. The cameras
are available. Call me at 321-2300 x3of>2 during the day and evenings.
Ask for Nomyar.

We have recently experienced damage to tins university to the tune
of some fifty or sixty thousand dollars which can be directly blamed
on student and non-student radicals. Another fifty to one hundred
thousand dollars worth of damage may be due to radical activity or
may not. This vandalism promises to continue, being temporarily set
aside in favor of less destructive tactics by a vote of 108 to 1 28.
Beyond this, two students have been beaten up unnecessarily by
"peaceful" demonstrators, and a camera has been smashed. I,
personally, have been threatened indirectly by three different people:
Art Busse ("I'll stop you first"), a white panther ("Harvey's boys will
get shot"), and Scott Johnson ("If you stay around here you'll get
your head busted"). In addition a building in which I was calmly
consuming Coors beer was firebombed from two sides at once, the
clear intent being to place flaming missiles through the windows both
upstairs (14 people present) and downstairs (a garage full of back
issues of the Arena).
All of the above demonstrations of peaceful good intent have been
perpetrated by the minority of students who feel that unless the
Stanford community will abide by their decisions that community
must be made to cease functioning. As many of the radicals, and
almost all of their leadership, have stated, ROTC is not the real issue.
As the radical leadership sees it, the university must either be halted
or turned into a training ground for revolutionaries.
Wishy-Wash) Liberals
This intended goal should render it clear to even the dullest of us
(Listen, you damn wishy-washy liberals!) that the real issue is the
integrity of the university itself. Most of the Liberation Conservatives
who make up the Free Campus Movement (FCM) are actively
opposing the destructive tactics of the radical group despite rather
than because of its thrust against ROTC. Most of us favor a voluntary
military with no recourse to the draft at all. We have been opposing
the violence of the extreme left (at some considerable risk to our
persons) because we feel quite deeply that it represents a series of

caused so much destruction. One cannot be free to conduct one's life
as one wishes when the radicals are dictating policy to all of us. If a
person wishes to retain what freedom there is to retain that person
must take his stand with the university. There is no way that the
terror can continue if the community is strongly against it. Control of
the situation here at Stanford could be easily achieved by fifty or
sixty individuals willing to give up a few evenings and some of their
(temporary) tranquility.
Destructive Cameras
This small number of people, with a few cameras, could, by
unfliching assertion of their rights to be anywhere on this campus
taking pictures, decrease the destruction to a fraction of what it has
been. No one is going to advocate rock throwing, much less do it, if
there are present persons who publicly and adamantly oppose such
behavior. None of the radical "leaders" are willing to accept the legal
consequences for their actions.
At the Old Union, the group made the conscious decision to
remain, in violation of the law after it was read to them by police. At
the same time they decided (by vote) to avoid the legal consequences
by flight should the police come.
What I am asking, then, is that a coalition of anti-radical leftists,
moderates, and rightists be formed for the purpose of confronting the
extremists with the real possibility of legal consequences for illegal
acts to be perpetrated upon the university.
I will establish a phone list for mobilization purposes. The cameras
are available. Call me at 321-2300 x3of>2 during the day and evenings.
Ask for Nomyar.

We have recently experienced damage to tins university to the tune
of some fifty or sixty thousand dollars which can be directly blamed
on student and non-student radicals. Another fifty to one hundred
thousand dollars worth of damage may be due to radical activity or
may not. This vandalism promises to continue, being temporarily set
aside in favor of less destructive tactics by a vote of 108 to 1 28.
Beyond this, two students have been beaten up unnecessarily by
"peaceful" demonstrators, and a camera has been smashed. I,
personally, have been threatened indirectly by three different people:
Art Busse ("I'll stop you first"), a white panther ("Harvey's boys will
get shot"), and Scott Johnson ("If you stay around here you'll get
your head busted"). In addition a building in which I was calmly
consuming Coors beer was firebombed from two sides at once, the
clear intent being to place flaming missiles through the windows both
upstairs (14 people present) and downstairs (a garage full of back
issues of the Arena).
All of the above demonstrations of peaceful good intent have been
perpetrated by the minority of students who feel that unless the
Stanford community will abide by their decisions that community
must be made to cease functioning. As many of the radicals, and
almost all of their leadership, have stated, ROTC is not the real issue.
As the radical leadership sees it, the university must either be halted
or turned into a training ground for revolutionaries.
Wishy-Wash) Liberals
This intended goal should render it clear to even the dullest of us
(Listen, you damn wishy-washy liberals!) that the real issue is the
integrity of the university itself. Most of the Liberation Conservatives
who make up the Free Campus Movement (FCM) are actively
opposing the destructive tactics of the radical group despite rather
than because of its thrust against ROTC. Most of us favor a voluntary
military with no recourse to the draft at all. We have been opposing
the violence of the extreme left (at some considerable risk to our
persons) because we feel quite deeply that it represents a series of
dagger thrusts at the heart of individual liberty. When the faculty,
administration, and trustees of this university are no longer allowed to
make the decisions governing it; when their rightful control is no
longer sacred, then we all must fear for our own rights to control
whatever it is that we own or hope to own.
More than control of material property, it is control of the
academic lives of faculty and students which the radicals hope to
seize. I don't know how you feel about the likes of Bruce Franklin
and Jim Shoch dictating "academic" policy to all of us in all
departments of the university, but the thought drives me out of my
tree (and into the streets). Of course I may be prejudiced, since Jim
once told me that people like myself would be shot one of these days
soon. It can be reasonably postulated that Jim has designs of that sort
on lots and lots of us. After all, aren't we tools of the imperialist
dinosaur?
Intent of Radicals
The point which I have tried to make above is that it is the
ultimate intent of the radicals to dictate to all of us in the academic
community precisely what our functions in society must be. This
totalitarian arrogance must be put down. It cannot be tolerated in a
company of free men. We cannot allow the terrorism to continue.
Particularly we cannot allow it to continue unhindered.
It is the place, perhaps the duty, of each citizen of this community
to step out of his or her (rightfully) self-serving world to confront the
radicals as they again attempt to ccntrol the decision making
processes of this community by the coercive actions which have so far
caused so much destruction. One cannot be free to conduct one's life
as one wishes when the radicals are dictating policy to all of us. If a
person wishes to retain what freedom there is to retain that person
must take his stand with the university. There is no way that the
terror can continue if the community is strongly against it. Control of
the situation here at Stanford could be easily achieved by fifty or
