## Restores Documents 
### 
An anonymous Palo Alto
woman may rescue the papers
burned in the fire at the Center
for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences last Friday.
O. Meredith Wilson, director of
the center, reported yesterday
that a document survival expert
has volunteered to undertake the
laborious task of recovering the
material nearly destroyed in a fire.
According to Wilson, the woman
has both the technical skill and
the patience needed for the
difficult job. He said that she had
telephoned the center and offered
her services after reading about
the fire.
First Stop
The first obligation of the
document survival expert will be

to help recover the research
material of M.N. Srinivas,
sociologist from the University of
Delhi. Twenty-two years of
Srinivas' research on the caste
system of India were lost in the
fire.
The center is arranging to have
microfilms made of his rough
notes in Delhi to facilitate the
restoration of the charred papers.
In addition, an assistant may be
brought from India by the center
to help Srinivas make up for the
time he has lost.
kendler Papers
The expert will also work on
the papers belonging to Mrs.
Howard S. Kendler, a psychologist
at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, and a specialist in
child psychology and child
development.
The papers recovered from the
scorched offices are in varied
conditions of preservation. Some
are almost completely charred.
Others are burned only around
the edges, but are dried out and
fragile because of the intense heat.
The papers are presently being
stored in cardboard boxes at the
center. The boxes are covered by
a damp blanket to keep them
from drying out further.
Arsonists are believed to have

sot the fires Friday which did
$100,000 damage and completely
destroyed the offices of three
scholars.
No Becker Recovery
The third researcher is Howard
Becker, a sociologist from
Northwestern University.
However, Wilson said that the
material in Becker's office, "was
not an important loss because
there were no unique
documents."
No effort will be made to
recover these papers since Becker
has copies available of all the
material.
Wilson could give no estimate
on the amount of time needed to
restore the research material, but
mentioned that wives of research
fellows at the center arc
volunteering their help to prepare
the papers for the document
specialist. He said, "They have the
necessary combination of concern
and tenderness" needed to handle
the papers.
The women will encase some
of the papers in plastic so the
specialist will be able to handle
them without having them
crumble under her hands.
Cost will not be a factor in the
restoration, as the woman has
volunteered her services.


Ron Wilson and Nancy Freehtling perform in the Studio Watts Workshop Drama
Group production, "The Name of the Game/Mechanical?" Fart of the Studio
Walls community centered activities program, it will be shown in the Little
Theatre April 30, May 1, and 2. The second in a series of four plays financed by a
grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, "The Name of the
Game/Mechanical?" develops a drama method using ideas and experience of the
Studio community in an effort to allow drama to function as an educational
experience as well as an art form.
Free tickets for all three performances are available at the Tresidder Box
Office.

Northwestern University.
However, Wilson said that the
material in Becker's office, "was
not an important loss because
there were no unique
documents."
No effort will be made to
recover these papers since Becker
has copies available of all the
material.
Wilson could give no estimate
on the amount of time needed to
restore the research material, but
mentioned that wives of research
fellows at the center arc
volunteering their help to prepare
the papers for the document
specialist. He said, "They have the
necessary combination of concern
and tenderness" needed to handle
the papers.
The women will encase some
of the papers in plastic so the
specialist will be able to handle
them without having them
crumble under her hands.
Cost will not be a factor in the
restoration, as the woman has
volunteered her services.


Ron Wilson and Nancy Freehtling perform in the Studio Watts Workshop Drama
Group production, "The Name of the Game/Mechanical?" Fart of the Studio
Walls community centered activities program, it will be shown in the Little
Theatre April 30, May 1, and 2. The second in a series of four plays financed by a
grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, "The Name of the
Game/Mechanical?" develops a drama method using ideas and experience of the
Studio community in an effort to allow drama to function as an educational
experience as well as an art form.
Free tickets for all three performances are available at the Tresidder Box
Office.
An anonymous Palo Alto
woman may rescue the papers
burned in the fire at the Center
for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences last Friday.
O. Meredith Wilson, director of
the center, reported yesterday
that a document survival expert
has volunteered to undertake the
laborious task of recovering the
material nearly destroyed in a fire.
According to Wilson, the woman
has both the technical skill and
the patience needed for the
difficult job. He said that she had
telephoned the center and offered
her services after reading about
the fire.
First Stop
The first obligation of the
document survival expert will be

to help recover the research
material of M.N. Srinivas,
sociologist from the University of
Delhi. Twenty-two years of
Srinivas' research on the caste
system of India were lost in the
fire.
The center is arranging to have
microfilms made of his rough
notes in Delhi to facilitate the
restoration of the charred papers.
In addition, an assistant may be
brought from India by the center
to help Srinivas make up for the
time he has lost.
kendler Papers
The expert will also work on
the papers belonging to Mrs.
Howard S. Kendler, a psychologist
at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, and a specialist in
child psychology and child
development.
The papers recovered from the
scorched offices are in varied
conditions of preservation. Some
are almost completely charred.
Others are burned only around
the edges, but are dried out and
fragile because of the intense heat.
The papers are presently being
stored in cardboard boxes at the
center. The boxes are covered by
a damp blanket to keep them
from drying out further.
Arsonists are believed to have

sot the fires Friday which did
$100,000 damage and completely
destroyed the offices of three
scholars.
No Becker Recovery
The third researcher is Howard
Becker, a sociologist from
Northwestern University.
However, Wilson said that the
material in Becker's office, "was
not an important loss because
there were no unique
