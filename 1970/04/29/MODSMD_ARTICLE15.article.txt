# Yale Tension High
## 
### 
The Yale law school Monday
refused to suspend classes as
debate over Bobby Scale's trial
continued in New Haven. In a
second vote, students and
professors approved giving
students and faculty a choice of
continuing their academic work.
As the law students indicated
their sympathy for the
undergraduate strike, which began
eight days ago, tension continued
to rise in New Haven.
A fire, which fire officials
termed arson, destroyed $2,500
worth of books in the basement
of the Law School Library.
Over 400 rifles and shotguns
have been recently stolen in the
area, while 140 pounds of
mercury were stolen from the
university. The mercury might be
used in explosive devices.
Chico State
Fifteen persons, including two
Chico State Professors, were
indicted yesterday by the Butte

County Grand Jury on charges of
conspiring to block a public
street.
They were jailed in lieu of
$2,500 bail each.
Police said the 15 sat down in a
crosswalk at West First Street,
which cuts through the 10,000
student campus for six blocks.
Hunter
Thirteen persons, including one
faculty member, were arrested
during a day of hit-and-run
disruptions Monday at Hunter
College, New York City. The
disruptions followed the
suspension of seven students by
president Jacqueline Wexler.
Students overturned dish racks
in the school cafeteria, overturned
files in the dean of students office
and sprayed them with a fire hose.
In addition, books and papers in
seven departments were thrown
across the floor. Fire alarms were
pulled, and fire hoses turned on,
causing some minor flooding.
