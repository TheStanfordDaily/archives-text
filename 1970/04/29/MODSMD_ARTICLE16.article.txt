# Black Law Students Seek BLSA Recognition
## 
### 
Black law students at Stanford
are in the process of gaining
official recognition from the
Black Law Students Association
(BLSA). Formed to meet the
needs of black law students and
the black community, its
recognition proposal states "as it
presently exists, the white
educational apparatus maims
illiterate blacks and trains literate
blacks to be enemies of their own
people."
In a statement released
Tuesday, the functions of the
organization were outlined as
follows:
"BLSA is dedicated to fighting
the old tradition of black students
receiving degrees and turning their
backs on the black community.
We recognize that our first
responsibility is to return to the
black community, even now
during our education. and
dedicate our skills and resources
to the technical and cultural
development of that community.
Our ultimate responsibility is to
provide the community with a
first-class legal assistance
heretofore absent from its
history."
New Officers
Newly elected President Jim
Ware and Vice President Ed Hayes
are first-year law students. Both
believe the black community has
many needs which the black law
student can fulfill. Ware states
that the major needs are
comprehension of the law, the
effect which it has on their lives
and how to use it to their
advantage.
"The only symbol of law to the
community has been law
enforcement officers," said Ware

"And such contact has been and
continues to be negative."
The group believes the
community needs to be informed
of the more sophisticated areas of
the law's functions: contractual
loopholes to avoid; trusts; taxes;
criminal law and procedure; tort
litigation (injury or damage for
which civil action can be
brought); insurance and
constitutional rights.
SJC Member
Ware, a graduate of California
Lutheran College, is presently
teaching an undergraduate special,
"Understanding Racism and
Prejudice," and serves on the
Stanford Judicial Council.
Hayes is currently a member of
the Black United Front of
Washington, D.C., and a research
assistant for California Rural
Legal Assistance. He is a graduate
of Wesleyan University where he
played a key role in founding the
Wesleyan Afro-American Society
