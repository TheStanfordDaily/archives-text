# 'Information'
## A 						Tricky Game Off The Field 
### FRED LEESON 
As his assistant scurried to
locate a team schedule, Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
peered gravely at a yellow tablet
on his desk and quickly danced
his pen over a statistical
comparison before he stopped to
look up.
"Playboy just picked
Manning."
In the realm of
sport —predicated on having
winners and losers—it appeared to
be a defeat for Bob Murphy, since
he had just learned that Heffner's
magazine had opted to pick
Mississippi's Archie Manning
ahead of Stanford's Jim Plunkett
as the nation's top quarterback.
(But maybe not, after all. Read
on.)
"It's damn disappointing," he
said quietly, running over the
figures a second time and listening
to Mississippi's schedule which
had been dug up somewhere by
the assistant. "All you gotta do is
compare the statistics and the
schedules."
Disappointing too because
Anson Mount, Playboy's chief
prognosticator, told Murphy
months ago that he figured
Plunkett to be the best in the
nation.
Victories
But Murphy has also had his
victories, such as four "national
publications"—all prefering to
remain un-named at this
point—which will feature Plunkett
on their covers.
And a second phone
converstaion with Mount, during
which Murphy had a chance to
counter with all his statistics, may
have convinced the former to
feature both players equally in
Playboy's mid-summer football
issue.
Big time recognition, like big
time football, is not a simple
thing.
Murphy, reflecting on his title,
sees his function as an
information provider, not a
publicist. "My job is to deal
strictly with the media. It
becomes obnoxious if you run a
carnival side show. I refuse to do
that."
But it's common knowledge
that a player's recognition
depends as much on his record as
how much his name and record
get around. It's Murphy's job to
win appropriate acclaim for
Stanford athletes.
"I still think it's the player who
wins the award," he said last
week. "He's in the competition.
The record stands on its own and
you try to give exposure as much
as the record warrants it."
In the case of Plunkett, one of
the best around, achieving
sufficient exposure involves a
number of approaches, from
national magazines to plastic cups.
Lobbying Common
Among regular national
magazines and football
periodicals, Murphy says, "There's
a little amount of honest
lobbying. We initiate a lot of that
ourselves. I call these people all
the time, not just for Plunkett but
for all our All-America candidates,
Bob Moore and John Sande, too."
And though Plunkett figures to
be a prominent figure in balloting
for the New York Athletic Club's
Heisman Trophy allegedly
awarded to the year's outstanding
college player, Murphy declares
that no program has been
specifically designed to emphasize
Jim for that award.
"I feel a great responsibility to
Jim, Stanford, and the whole
athletic program of 750,"he says.
"Anybody who qualifies receives

just as much focus as possible. Jim
is just one amony many when you
look at it that way."
Heisman competition escalated
suddenly three years ago when
UCLA, facing a stiff bid from O.J.
Simpson across town at USC,
distributed nationally a special
four-color pamphlet called "The
Great One" on behalf of Gary
Beban. Beban won.
Last year Stanford likewise
distributed a special pamphlet but
along more modest lines, taking
four pages to cover Plunkett, Don
Parish, Moore, Sande and Bob
Reinhard.
"It's just an updating of
everything we've done," Murphy
says of it."I don't want to be
drawn into a one-upsmanship type
thing with bugles, drums, tin hats
and so on. We don't have the
budget to do that. Besides, it's
beneath the dignity of the job."
As for the Heisman award, "It
makes it unlikely that it could be
won again here," Murphy says,
noting that West Coast players
(Beban, Simpson) have won it two
of the last three years. "A lot of
people will vote geographically
instead of objectively. This makes
it tough for Jim. "
Another factor, Murphy adds,
is that voters (something like
1400 sports writers around the
country) don't necessarily equate
the year's top collegiate player as
the one that the professional
scouts seem to think is best.
So, while Murphy is confident
the pros will be looking at
Plunkett first, that doesn't keep
the voters from concentrating on

imponderable "college"
attributes, and giving the award to
such players as Beban and Terry
Baker as they did in the 60s.
But Murphy's dissemination
work is not limited to national
publications, weekly releases or
hundreds of photographs.
Plunkett's picture will appear on
window placards featuring the
season schedule and on the spring
and fall press books, and stacks of
a special two-page mimeographed
biography of the quarterback have
already been prepared.
Besides that, the sports
information department is also
dealing in pocket schedules with
Plunkett's picture (sponsored by a
local restaurant) and Plunkett
plastic cups (in cooperation with a
local dairy), not to mention a
number of matchbooks.
Two million, to be exact. (Put
out in cooperation with a local
bank.)
The thing to watch out for in
those promotions (which Murphy
feels still fall in the realm of
"information") is that "You have
to be careful not to associate the
player with the product," to avoid
any hint of professionalism.
The latest gimmick, if that
expression is appropriate, was the
release some ten days ago of the
lyrics for a song called "The
Ballad of Jimmy Plunkett."
It was written by the wife of a
former Stanford player as the
result of a record titled "The
Ballad of Archie Who," a song
about quarterback Manning which
was recorded late last fall and
scaled the top of Mississippi pop
charts. It reportedly sold 35,000
copies.
"The Ballad of Jimmy

Plunkett," three rather corny
verses adapted for the tune of
"Davy Crockett," was turned
loose on the local press with a
note from Murphy saying he was
looking for a rock group to record
it.
"That is a tongue-in-cheek type
thing," he says, in case anybody
took it seriously. "A darn good
lyricist went to the trouble to do
it, and we might as well have some
fun with it."
And the target of all this?
"Some of it sounds silly at
times, I suppose," says James
William Plunkett, "but then you
are competing. It might help
somebody remember your name, I
guess."
"Nobody should feel that the
Heisman Trophy will be won or
lost on the Ballad of Jimmy
Plunkett," Murphy says,
reiterating that the individual still
wins the awards.
In fact, it could still be won or
lost on the field, of all places,
next fall.

'It becomes obnoxious if you
run a carnival side show.'


LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD—Quarterback Jim Plunkett (number 16, lest you
forget) is in the running with Mississippi's Archie Manning tor first team
quarterback on the national pre-season team to be selected by Playboy magazine.
There is an indication that die publication may give die pair equal spread in its
summer-time football issue. (Daily sports, however, still has on hint on Playmate
of the Year.)

schedules."
Disappointing too because
Anson Mount, Playboy's chief
prognosticator, told Murphy
months ago that he figured
Plunkett to be the best in the
nation.
Victories
But Murphy has also had his
victories, such as four "national
publications"—all prefering to
remain un-named at this
point—which will feature Plunkett
on their covers.
And a second phone
converstaion with Mount, during
which Murphy had a chance to
counter with all his statistics, may
have convinced the former to
feature both players equally in
Playboy's mid-summer football
issue.
Big time recognition, like big
time football, is not a simple
thing.
Murphy, reflecting on his title,
sees his function as an
information provider, not a
publicist. "My job is to deal
strictly with the media. It
becomes obnoxious if you run a
carnival side show. I refuse to do
that."
But it's common knowledge
that a player's recognition
depends as much on his record as
how much his name and record
get around. It's Murphy's job to
win appropriate acclaim for
Stanford athletes.
"I still think it's the player who
wins the award," he said last
week. "He's in the competition.
The record stands on its own and
you try to give exposure as much
as the record warrants it."
In the case of Plunkett, one of
the best around, achieving
sufficient exposure involves a
number of approaches, from
national magazines to plastic cups.
Lobbying Common
Among regular national
magazines and football
periodicals, Murphy says, "There's
a little amount of honest
lobbying. We initiate a lot of that
ourselves. I call these people all
the time, not just for Plunkett but
for all our All-America candidates,
Bob Moore and John Sande, too."
And though Plunkett figures to
be a prominent figure in balloting
for the New York Athletic Club's
Heisman Trophy allegedly
awarded to the year's outstanding
college player, Murphy declares
that no program has been
specifically designed to emphasize
Jim for that award.
"I feel a great responsibility to
Jim, Stanford, and the whole
athletic program of 750,"he says.
"Anybody who qualifies receives

just as much focus as possible. Jim
is just one amony many when you
look at it that way."
Heisman competition escalated
suddenly three years ago when
UCLA, facing a stiff bid from O.J.
Simpson across town at USC,
distributed nationally a special
four-color pamphlet called "The
Great One" on behalf of Gary
Beban. Beban won.
Last year Stanford likewise
distributed a special pamphlet but
along more modest lines, taking
four pages to cover Plunkett, Don
Parish, Moore, Sande and Bob
Reinhard.
"It's just an updating of
everything we've done," Murphy
says of it."I don't want to be
drawn into a one-upsmanship type
thing with bugles, drums, tin hats
and so on. We don't have the
budget to do that. Besides, it's
beneath the dignity of the job."
As for the Heisman award, "It
makes it unlikely that it could be
won again here," Murphy says,
noting that West Coast players
(Beban, Simpson) have won it two
of the last three years. "A lot of
people will vote geographically
instead of objectively. This makes
it tough for Jim. "
Another factor, Murphy adds,
is that voters (something like
1400 sports writers around the
country) don't necessarily equate
the year's top collegiate player as
the one that the professional
scouts seem to think is best.
So, while Murphy is confident
the pros will be looking at
Plunkett first, that doesn't keep
the voters from concentrating on

imponderable "college"
attributes, and giving the award to
such players as Beban and Terry
Baker as they did in the 60s.
But Murphy's dissemination
work is not limited to national
publications, weekly releases or
hundreds of photographs.
Plunkett's picture will appear on
window placards featuring the
season schedule and on the spring
and fall press books, and stacks of
a special two-page mimeographed
biography of the quarterback have
already been prepared.
Besides that, the sports
information department is also
dealing in pocket schedules with
Plunkett's picture (sponsored by a
local restaurant) and Plunkett
plastic cups (in cooperation with a
local dairy), not to mention a
number of matchbooks.
Two million, to be exact. (Put
out in cooperation with a local
bank.)
The thing to watch out for in
those promotions (which Murphy
feels still fall in the realm of
"information") is that "You have
to be careful not to associate the
player with the product," to avoid
any hint of professionalism.
The latest gimmick, if that
expression is appropriate, was the
release some ten days ago of the
lyrics for a song called "The
Ballad of Jimmy Plunkett."
It was written by the wife of a
former Stanford player as the
result of a record titled "The
Ballad of Archie Who," a song
about quarterback Manning which
was recorded late last fall and
scaled the top of Mississippi pop
charts. It reportedly sold 35,000
copies.
"The Ballad of Jimmy

Plunkett," three rather corny
verses adapted for the tune of
"Davy Crockett," was turned
loose on the local press with a
note from Murphy saying he was
looking for a rock group to record
it.
"That is a tongue-in-cheek type
thing," he says, in case anybody
took it seriously. "A darn good
lyricist went to the trouble to do
it, and we might as well have some
fun with it."
And the target of all this?
"Some of it sounds silly at
times, I suppose," says James
William Plunkett, "but then you
are competing. It might help
somebody remember your name, I
guess."
"Nobody should feel that the
Heisman Trophy will be won or
lost on the Ballad of Jimmy
Plunkett," Murphy says,
reiterating that the individual still
wins the awards.
In fact, it could still be won or
lost on the field, of all places,
next fall.

'It becomes obnoxious if you
run a carnival side show.'


LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD—Quarterback Jim Plunkett (number 16, lest you
forget) is in the running with Mississippi's Archie Manning tor first team
quarterback on the national pre-season team to be selected by Playboy magazine.
There is an indication that die publication may give die pair equal spread in its
summer-time football issue. (Daily sports, however, still has on hint on Playmate
of the Year.)
As his assistant scurried to
locate a team schedule, Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
peered gravely at a yellow tablet
on his desk and quickly danced
his pen over a statistical
comparison before he stopped to
look up.
"Playboy just picked
Manning."
In the realm of
sport —predicated on having
winners and losers—it appeared to
be a defeat for Bob Murphy, since
he had just learned that Heffner's
magazine had opted to pick
Mississippi's Archie Manning
ahead of Stanford's Jim Plunkett
as the nation's top quarterback.
(But maybe not, after all. Read
on.)
"It's damn disappointing," he
said quietly, running over the
figures a second time and listening
to Mississippi's schedule which
had been dug up somewhere by
the assistant. "All you gotta do is
compare the statistics and the
schedules."

carnival side show. I refuse to do
that."
But it's common knowledge
that a player's recognition
depends as much on his record as
how much his name and record
get around. It's Murphy's job to
win appropriate acclaim for
Stanford athletes.
"I still think it's the player who
wins the award," he said last
week. "He's in the competition.
The record stands on its own and
you try to give exposure as much
as the record warrants it."
In the case of Plunkett, one of
the best around, achieving
sufficient exposure involves a
number of approaches, from
national magazines to plastic cups.
Lobbying Common
Among regular national
magazines and football
periodicals, Murphy says, "There's
a little amount of honest
lobbying. We initiate a lot of that
ourselves. I call these people all
the time, not just for Plunkett but
for all our All-America candidates,
Bob Moore and John Sande, too."
And though Plunkett figures to
be a prominent figure in balloting
for the New York Athletic Club's
Heisman Trophy allegedly
awarded to the year's outstanding
college player, Murphy declares
that no program has been
specifically designed to emphasize
Jim for that award.
"I feel a great responsibility to
Jim, Stanford, and the whole
athletic program of 750,"he says.
"Anybody who qualifies receives

just as much focus as possible. Jim
is just one amony many when you
look at it that way."
Heisman competition escalated
suddenly three years ago when
UCLA, facing a stiff bid from O.J.
Simpson across town at USC,
distributed nationally a special
four-color pamphlet called "The
Great One" on behalf of Gary
Beban. Beban won.
Last year Stanford likewise
distributed a special pamphlet but
along more modest lines, taking
four pages to cover Plunkett, Don
Parish, Moore, Sande and Bob
Reinhard.
"It's just an updating of
everything we've done," Murphy
says of it."I don't want to be
drawn into a one-upsmanship type
thing with bugles, drums, tin hats
and so on. We don't have the
budget to do that. Besides, it's
beneath the dignity of the job."
As for the Heisman award, "It
makes it unlikely that it could be
won again here," Murphy says,
noting that West Coast players
(Beban, Simpson) have won it two
of the last three years. "A lot of
people will vote geographically
instead of objectively. This makes
it tough for Jim. "
Another factor, Murphy adds,
is that voters (something like
1400 sports writers around the
country) don't necessarily equate
the year's top collegiate player as
the one that the professional
scouts seem to think is best.
So, while Murphy is confident
the pros will be looking at
Plunkett first, that doesn't keep
the voters from concentrating on

imponderable "college"
attributes, and giving the award to
such players as Beban and Terry
Baker as they did in the 60s.
But Murphy's dissemination
work is not limited to national
publications, weekly releases or
hundreds of photographs.
Plunkett's picture will appear on
window placards featuring the
season schedule and on the spring
and fall press books, and stacks of
a special two-page mimeographed
biography of the quarterback have
already been prepared.
Besides that, the sports
information department is also
dealing in pocket schedules with
Plunkett's picture (sponsored by a
local restaurant) and Plunkett
plastic cups (in cooperation with a
local dairy), not to mention a
number of matchbooks.
Two million, to be exact. (Put
out in cooperation with a local
bank.)
The thing to watch out for in
those promotions (which Murphy
feels still fall in the realm of
"information") is that "You have
to be careful not to associate the
player with the product," to avoid
any hint of professionalism.
The latest gimmick, if that
expression is appropriate, was the
release some ten days ago of the
lyrics for a song called "The
Ballad of Jimmy Plunkett."
It was written by the wife of a
former Stanford player as the
result of a record titled "The
Ballad of Archie Who," a song
about quarterback Manning which
was recorded late last fall and
scaled the top of Mississippi pop
charts. It reportedly sold 35,000
copies.
"The Ballad of Jimmy

Plunkett," three rather corny
verses adapted for the tune of
"Davy Crockett," was turned
loose on the local press with a
note from Murphy saying he was
looking for a rock group to record
it.
"That is a tongue-in-cheek type
thing," he says, in case anybody
took it seriously. "A darn good
lyricist went to the trouble to do
it, and we might as well have some
fun with it."
And the target of all this?
"Some of it sounds silly at
times, I suppose," says James
William Plunkett, "but then you
are competing. It might help
somebody remember your name, I
guess."
"Nobody should feel that the
Heisman Trophy will be won or
lost on the Ballad of Jimmy
Plunkett," Murphy says,
reiterating that the individual still
wins the awards.
In fact, it could still be won or
lost on the field, of all places,
next fall.

LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD—Quarterback Jim Plunkett (number 16, lest you
forget) is in the running with Mississippi's Archie Manning tor first team
quarterback on the national pre-season team to be selected by Playboy magazine.
There is an indication that die publication may give die pair equal spread in its
summer-time football issue. (Daily sports, however, still has on hint on Playmate
of the Year.)
As his assistant scurried to
locate a team schedule, Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
peered gravely at a yellow tablet
on his desk and quickly danced
his pen over a statistical
comparison before he stopped to
look up.
"Playboy just picked
Manning."
In the realm of
sport —predicated on having
winners and losers—it appeared to
be a defeat for Bob Murphy, since
he had just learned that Heffner's
magazine had opted to pick
Mississippi's Archie Manning
ahead of Stanford's Jim Plunkett
as the nation's top quarterback.
(But maybe not, after all. Read
on.)
"It's damn disappointing," he
said quietly, running over the
figures a second time and listening
to Mississippi's schedule which
had been dug up somewhere by
the assistant. "All you gotta do is
compare the statistics and the
schedules."
Disappointing too because
Anson Mount, Playboy's chief
prognosticator, told Murphy
months ago that he figured
Plunkett to be the best in the
nation.
Victories
But Murphy has also had his
victories, such as four "national
publications"—all prefering to
remain un-named at this
point—which will feature Plunkett
on their covers.
And a second phone
converstaion with Mount, during
which Murphy had a chance to
counter with all his statistics, may
have convinced the former to
feature both players equally in
Playboy's mid-summer football
issue.
Big time recognition, like big
time football, is not a simple
thing.

for all our All-America candidates,
Bob Moore and John Sande, too."
And though Plunkett figures to
be a prominent figure in balloting
for the New York Athletic Club's
Heisman Trophy allegedly
awarded to the year's outstanding
college player, Murphy declares
that no program has been
specifically designed to emphasize
Jim for that award.
"I feel a great responsibility to
Jim, Stanford, and the whole
athletic program of 750,"he says.
"Anybody who qualifies receives

just as much focus as possible. Jim
is just one amony many when you
look at it that way."
Heisman competition escalated
suddenly three years ago when
UCLA, facing a stiff bid from O.J.
Simpson across town at USC,
distributed nationally a special
four-color pamphlet called "The
Great One" on behalf of Gary
Beban. Beban won.
Last year Stanford likewise
distributed a special pamphlet but
along more modest lines, taking
four pages to cover Plunkett, Don
Parish, Moore, Sande and Bob
Reinhard.
"It's just an updating of
everything we've done," Murphy
says of it."I don't want to be
drawn into a one-upsmanship type
thing with bugles, drums, tin hats
and so on. We don't have the
budget to do that. Besides, it's
beneath the dignity of the job."
As for the Heisman award, "It
makes it unlikely that it could be
won again here," Murphy says,
noting that West Coast players
(Beban, Simpson) have won it two
of the last three years. "A lot of
people will vote geographically
instead of objectively. This makes
it tough for Jim. "
Another factor, Murphy adds,
is that voters (something like
1400 sports writers around the
country) don't necessarily equate
the year's top collegiate player as
the one that the professional
scouts seem to think is best.
So, while Murphy is confident
the pros will be looking at
Plunkett first, that doesn't keep
the voters from concentrating on

imponderable "college"
attributes, and giving the award to
such players as Beban and Terry
Baker as they did in the 60s.
But Murphy's dissemination
work is not limited to national
publications, weekly releases or
hundreds of photographs.
Plunkett's picture will appear on
window placards featuring the
season schedule and on the spring
and fall press books, and stacks of
a special two-page mimeographed
biography of the quarterback have
already been prepared.
Besides that, the sports
information department is also
dealing in pocket schedules with
Plunkett's picture (sponsored by a
local restaurant) and Plunkett
plastic cups (in cooperation with a
local dairy), not to mention a
number of matchbooks.
Two million, to be exact. (Put
out in cooperation with a local
bank.)
The thing to watch out for in
those promotions (which Murphy
feels still fall in the realm of
"information") is that "You have
to be careful not to associate the
player with the product," to avoid
any hint of professionalism.
The latest gimmick, if that
expression is appropriate, was the
release some ten days ago of the
lyrics for a song called "The
Ballad of Jimmy Plunkett."
It was written by the wife of a
former Stanford player as the
result of a record titled "The
Ballad of Archie Who," a song
about quarterback Manning which
was recorded late last fall and
scaled the top of Mississippi pop
charts. It reportedly sold 35,000
copies.
"The Ballad of Jimmy

Plunkett," three rather corny
verses adapted for the tune of
"Davy Crockett," was turned
loose on the local press with a
note from Murphy saying he was
looking for a rock group to record
it.
"That is a tongue-in-cheek type
thing," he says, in case anybody
took it seriously. "A darn good
lyricist went to the trouble to do
it, and we might as well have some
fun with it."
And the target of all this?
"Some of it sounds silly at
times, I suppose," says James
William Plunkett, "but then you
are competing. It might help
somebody remember your name, I
guess."
"Nobody should feel that the
Heisman Trophy will be won or
lost on the Ballad of Jimmy
Plunkett," Murphy says,
reiterating that the individual still
wins the awards.
In fact, it could still be won or
lost on the field, of all places,
next fall.

'It becomes obnoxious if you
run a carnival side show.'


LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD—Quarterback Jim Plunkett (number 16, lest you
forget) is in the running with Mississippi's Archie Manning tor first team
quarterback on the national pre-season team to be selected by Playboy magazine.
There is an indication that die publication may give die pair equal spread in its
summer-time football issue. (Daily sports, however, still has on hint on Playmate
of the Year.)
As his assistant scurried to
locate a team schedule, Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
peered gravely at a yellow tablet
on his desk and quickly danced
his pen over a statistical
comparison before he stopped to
look up.
"Playboy just picked
Manning."
In the realm of
sport —predicated on having
winners and losers—it appeared to
be a defeat for Bob Murphy, since
he had just learned that Heffner's
magazine had opted to pick
Mississippi's Archie Manning
ahead of Stanford's Jim Plunkett
as the nation's top quarterback.
(But maybe not, after all. Read
on.)
"It's damn disappointing," he
said quietly, running over the
figures a second time and listening
to Mississippi's schedule which
had been dug up somewhere by
the assistant. "All you gotta do is
compare the statistics and the
schedules."
Disappointing too because
Anson Mount, Playboy's chief
prognosticator, told Murphy
months ago that he figured
Plunkett to be the best in the
nation.
Victories
But Murphy has also had his
victories, such as four "national
publications"—all prefering to
remain un-named at this
point—which will feature Plunkett
on their covers.
And a second phone
converstaion with Mount, during
which Murphy had a chance to
counter with all his statistics, may
have convinced the former to
feature both players equally in
Playboy's mid-summer football
issue.
Big time recognition, like big
time football, is not a simple
thing.
Murphy, reflecting on his title,
sees his function as an
information provider, not a
publicist. "My job is to deal
strictly with the media. It
becomes obnoxious if you run a
carnival side show. I refuse to do
that."
But it's common knowledge
that a player's recognition
depends as much on his record as
how much his name and record
get around. It's Murphy's job to
win appropriate acclaim for
Stanford athletes.
"I still think it's the player who
wins the award," he said last
week. "He's in the competition.
The record stands on its own and
you try to give exposure as much
as the record warrants it."
In the case of Plunkett, one of
the best around, achieving
sufficient exposure involves a
number of approaches, from
national magazines to plastic cups.
Lobbying Common
Among regular national
magazines and football
periodicals, Murphy says, "There's
a little amount of honest
lobbying. We initiate a lot of that
ourselves. I call these people all
the time, not just for Plunkett but
for all our All-America candidates,
Bob Moore and John Sande, too."
And though Plunkett figures to
be a prominent figure in balloting
for the New York Athletic Club's
Heisman Trophy allegedly
awarded to the year's outstanding
college player, Murphy declares
that no program has been
specifically designed to emphasize
Jim for that award.
