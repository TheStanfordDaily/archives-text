# Draw To Affect All In Housing System
## 
### MIKE BOYLE DAN KILPATKICK 
Round one of the draw for
next year's university residence
housing will begin next week. All
undergraduates currently in
University housing wishing to
remain in the residence system
should participate in the draw
because it is very unlikely that
any undergraduate who does not
participate will receive a fall
housing assignment.
Only residents of Roble,
Lagunita, Florence Moore, Stern,
Wilbur, Branner, Toyon, The
Row, Lambda Nu, Hoskins,
Manzanita, and students overseas
are eligible to participate.
Students drawing must pick up
the draw cards on which housing
preferences are to be expressed
from residence hall secretaries
during the week. A student fills
out his card by listing in the order
of his preference the draw code
numbers of the residences which
he would like to live in the fall.
Num hers
Each student must list either
'03' (any house appropriate for
my sex) or 100 (off-campus) at
his last choice on the draw card,
so that the assignment procedure
may meet the student's desire
either for any available housing or
for no housing if it is not possible
to honor preferences for specific
houses.
The formal procedure of the
first round will go on from May 1
through May 8, from 8:15 A.M.
to noon and from 1:00 to 4:30
P.M., on the ground floor of the
Old Union. A student drawing will
first have his draw card checked
against a checklist which will be
published in the May \ Daily.
Picks Num her
Alter having his card checked,
each student (or each group) picks
a draw number, which will be
affixed to his (or their) draw card
which will be retained by the
Housing Office. No student will

be allowed to change his draw
preferences for the first round
after picking a number.
Residence hall secretaries will
be given the results of round one
by May 13. By May 20, each
student who participated in round
one should sign a card with his
residence hall secretary indicating
that he either (1) accepts the
space to which he was assigned in
round one, (2) reserves a space in
the house to which he was
assigned in round one and enters

round two in an attempt to
improve his assignment, or (3)
does not desire University housing
for fall quarter. Students who do
not fill out the card by May 20
will be dropped from the draw.
Round Two
Each student will keep the
same draw number for processing
in round two. The second round
will be held because a significant
number of students will drop out
of the draw after the first round;
their dropping out will free spaces

with which some students may
improve their first-round
assignments while other students
unassigned in the first round may
be assigned spaces. Any student
assigned during round one who
opts to participate in round two is
guaranteed that his assignment
will either be improved or remain
the same.
Students may participate in the
first round of the draw without
charge; students assigned spaces
for fall who notify the Housing
Office of a subsequent decision
not to live in University housing
for fall after May 20 (but before
August 1, after which the penalty
increases) will be charged $10.
Students who enter the second
round will be allowed to replace
their first and second preferences
with new preferences, since the
desirability of some residences
may have changed as a function of
the people assigned to them. T'ho
results of the second round of the
draw will be announced by May
25.
Own Residence
Any student eligible for a space
in the housing system during
round one who is residing in a
house to which he is eligible to
return is guaranteed that he will
be reassigned to his present
residence or to a residence listed
as a higher choice. Since some
spaces in integrated dorms must
bo reserved for next year's
freshmen, this policy will lapse in
the unlikely event that more
students elect to return to a given
dorm than there are spaces
available for upperclassmen. A
student who lists his current
residence as a first choice is not
protected from the possibility of
eviction from th- housing system
if there are more students in tlu
draw than there are spaces
available for upperclassmen
Drawing as a group gives the
group members the greatest

probability of being assigned
together while permitting each
individual to realize the highest
preference attainable with his
draw number. Students may draw
in groups of four or less. All draw
cards of a group must be
presented together at the draw
window. Once a person has drawn
a number, he may not recall his
card to draw with a group. All
members of a group must have the
same first choice; all group
choices must precede any
individual choices.
Hoskins-Ma n/.anila
Draw procedures for current
residents of Hoskins and
Manzanita and for students
drawing with them have already
been communicated to current
residents. Students not presently
residing in Hoskins or Manzanita
who are not drawing in with a
current resident must draw in a
group of either four (lor
Manzanita or Manzanita and
Hoskins) or two (for Hoskins) All
members of the group must be
eligible for the draw.
A group drawing for either
Hoskins or Manzanita must list.
Hoskins or Manzanita as its first
choice; a group listing both
Hoskins and Manzanita as choices
must list them as its first two
choices.
Two seniors drawing for
Hoskins eligible for a space in the
housing system will be given
priority for Hoskins after current
residents of Hoskins Seniors
drawing with students from
another class and all other
students will be assigned in draw
number order with no
consideration for class Class
consideration will not be a factor
in any other housing assignments,
lovon and I'lieme Mouses
hating Club members will be
assigned to Toyon before

Own Residence
Any student eligible for a space
in the housing system during
round one who is residing in a
house to which he is eligible to
return is guaranteed that he will
be reassigned to his present
residence or to a residence listed
as a higher choice. Since some
spaces in integrated dorms must
bo reserved for next year's
freshmen, this policy will lapse in
the unlikely event that more
students elect to return to a given
dorm than there are spaces
available for upperclassmen. A
student who lists his current
residence as a first choice is not
protected from the possibility of
eviction from th- housing system
if there are more students in tlu
draw than there are spaces
available for upperclassmen
Drawing as a group gives the
group members the greatest

probability of being assigned
together while permitting each
individual to realize the highest
preference attainable with his
draw number. Students may draw
in groups of four or less. All draw
cards of a group must be
presented together at the draw
window. Once a person has drawn
a number, he may not recall his
card to draw with a group. All
members of a group must have the
same first choice; all group
choices must precede any
individual choices.
Hoskins-Ma n/.anila
Draw procedures for current
residents of Hoskins and
Manzanita and for students
drawing with them have already

residents. Students not presently
residing in Hoskins or Manzanita
who are not drawing in with a
current resident must draw in a
group of either four (lor
Manzanita or Manzanita and

must have joined a club on or
before April 1 7.
The two theme houses in the
draw will be Adelfa (in Lagunita),
with a theme of outdoor sports
and camping, and Grove (on the
Row), which has a variety of
house seminars. To be eligible to
draw into these residences,
students must contact either Val
Brown, 326-2200 x 124 (Adelfa),
or 321-2300 x 4207 (Grove)
before the draw. No special
procedures are necessary for
Otero (in Wilbur) and Eucalypto
(in Lagunita), the two
International Houses.
Students with questions about
the draw may read the procedures
brochure available in the residence
hall offices, or come to the
Housing Office on the third floor
of the Old Union. Assistant Dean
of Students Margaret
Burk-Dietrich, x 3377, is available
to speak to groups about the
draw.
Round one of the draw for
next year's university residence
housing will begin next week. All
undergraduates currently in
University housing wishing to
remain in the residence system
should participate in the draw
because it is very unlikely that
any undergraduate who does not
participate will receive a fall
housing assignment.
Only residents of Roble,
Lagunita, Florence Moore, Stern,
Wilbur, Branner, Toyon, The
Row, Lambda Nu, Hoskins,
Manzanita, and students overseas
are eligible to participate.
Students drawing must pick up
the draw cards on which housing
preferences are to be expressed
from residence hall secretaries
during the week. A student fills
out his card by listing in the order
of his preference the draw code
numbers of the residences which
he would like to live in the fall.

Each student must list either
'03' (any house appropriate for
my sex) or 100 (off-campus) at
his last choice on the draw card,
so that the assignment procedure
may meet the student's desire
either for any available housing or
for no housing if it is not possible
to honor preferences for specific
houses.
The formal procedure of the
first round will go on from May 1

Housing Office. No student will

be allowed to change his draw
preferences for the first round
after picking a number.
Residence hall secretaries will
be given the results of round one
by May 13. By May 20, each
student who participated in round
one should sign a card with his
residence hall secretary indicating
that he either (1) accepts the
space to which he was assigned in
round one, (2) reserves a space in
the house to which he was
assigned in round one and enters

round two in an attempt to
improve his assignment, or (3)
does not desire University housing
for fall quarter. Students who do
not fill out the card by May 20
will be dropped from the draw.
Round Two
Each student will keep the
same draw number for processing
in round two. The second round
will be held because a significant
number of students will drop out
of the draw after the first round;
their dropping out will free spaces

with which some students may
improve their first-round
assignments while other students
unassigned in the first round may
be assigned spaces. Any student
assigned during round one who
opts to participate in round two is
guaranteed that his assignment
will either be improved or remain

house seminars. To be eligible to
draw into these residences,
students must contact either Val
Brown, 326-2200 x 124 (Adelfa),
or 321-2300 x 4207 (Grove)
before the draw. No special
procedures are necessary for
Otero (in Wilbur) and Eucalypto
(in Lagunita), the two
International Houses.
Students with questions about
the draw may read the procedures
brochure available in the residence
hall offices, or come to the
Housing Office on the third floor
of the Old Union. Assistant Dean
of Students Margaret
Burk-Dietrich, x 3377, is available
to speak to groups about the
draw.
Round one of the draw for
next year's university residence
housing will begin next week. All
undergraduates currently in
University housing wishing to
remain in the residence system
should participate in the draw
because it is very unlikely that
any undergraduate who does not
participate will receive a fall
housing assignment.
Only residents of Roble,
Lagunita, Florence Moore, Stern,
Wilbur, Branner, Toyon, The
Row, Lambda Nu, Hoskins,
Manzanita, and students overseas
are eligible to participate.
Students drawing must pick up
the draw cards on which housing
preferences are to be expressed
from residence hall secretaries
during the week. A student fills
out his card by listing in the order
of his preference the draw code
numbers of the residences which
he would like to live in the fall.
Num hers
Each student must list either
'03' (any house appropriate for
my sex) or 100 (off-campus) at
his last choice on the draw card,
so that the assignment procedure
may meet the student's desire
either for any available housing or
for no housing if it is not possible
to honor preferences for specific
houses.
The formal procedure of the
first round will go on from May 1
through May 8, from 8:15 A.M.
to noon and from 1:00 to 4:30
P.M., on the ground floor of the
Old Union. A student drawing will
first have his draw card checked
against a checklist which will be
published in the May \ Daily.
Picks Num her
Alter having his card checked,
each student (or each group) picks
a draw number, which will be
affixed to his (or their) draw card
which will be retained by the
Housing Office. No student will

be allowed to change his draw
preferences for the first round
after picking a number.
Residence hall secretaries will
be given the results of round one
by May 13. By May 20, each
student who participated in round
one should sign a card with his
residence hall secretary indicating
that he either (1) accepts the
space to which he was assigned in
round one, (2) reserves a space in
the house to which he was
assigned in round one and enters

round two in an attempt to
improve his assignment, or (3)
does not desire University housing
for fall quarter. Students who do
not fill out the card by May 20
will be dropped from the draw.
Round Two
Each student will keep the
same draw number for processing
in round two. The second round
will be held because a significant
number of students will drop out
of the draw after the first round;
their dropping out will free spaces

with which some students may
improve their first-round
assignments while other students
unassigned in the first round may
be assigned spaces. Any student
assigned during round one who
opts to participate in round two is
guaranteed that his assignment
will either be improved or remain
the same.
Students may participate in the
first round of the draw without
charge; students assigned spaces
for fall who notify the Housing
Office of a subsequent decision
not to live in University housing
for fall after May 20 (but before
August 1, after which the penalty
increases) will be charged $10.
Students who enter the second
round will be allowed to replace
their first and second preferences
with new preferences, since the
desirability of some residences
may have changed as a function of
the people assigned to them. T'ho
results of the second round of the
draw will be announced by May
25.
Own Residence
Any student eligible for a space
in the housing system during
round one who is residing in a
house to which he is eligible to
return is guaranteed that he will
be reassigned to his present
residence or to a residence listed
as a higher choice. Since some
spaces in integrated dorms must
bo reserved for next year's
freshmen, this policy will lapse in
the unlikely event that more
students elect to return to a given
dorm than there are spaces
available for upperclassmen. A
student who lists his current
residence as a first choice is not
protected from the possibility of
eviction from th- housing system
if there are more students in tlu
draw than there are spaces
available for upperclassmen
Drawing as a group gives the
group members the greatest

probability of being assigned
together while permitting each
individual to realize the highest
preference attainable with his
draw number. Students may draw
in groups of four or less. All draw
cards of a group must be
presented together at the draw
window. Once a person has drawn
a number, he may not recall his
card to draw with a group. All
members of a group must have the
same first choice; all group
choices must precede any
individual choices.

same draw number for processing
in round two. The second round
will be held because a significant
number of students will drop out
of the draw after the first round;
their dropping out will free spaces

with which some students may
improve their first-round
assignments while other students
unassigned in the first round may
be assigned spaces. Any student
assigned during round one who
opts to participate in round two is
guaranteed that his assignment
will either be improved or remain
the same.
Students may participate in the
first round of the draw without
charge; students assigned spaces
for fall who notify the Housing
Office of a subsequent decision
not to live in University housing
for fall after May 20 (but before
August 1, after which the penalty
increases) will be charged $10.
Students who enter the second
round will be allowed to replace
their first and second preferences
with new preferences, since the
desirability of some residences
may have changed as a function of
the people assigned to them. T'ho
results of the second round of the
draw will be announced by May
25.
Own Residence
Any student eligible for a space
in the housing system during
round one who is residing in a
house to which he is eligible to
return is guaranteed that he will
be reassigned to his present
residence or to a residence listed
as a higher choice. Since some
spaces in integrated dorms must
bo reserved for next year's
freshmen, this policy will lapse in
the unlikely event that more
students elect to return to a given
dorm than there are spaces
available for upperclassmen. A
student who lists his current
residence as a first choice is not
protected from the possibility of
eviction from th- housing system
if there are more students in tlu
draw than there are spaces
available for upperclassmen
Drawing as a group gives the
group members the greatest

probability of being assigned
together while permitting each
individual to realize the highest
preference attainable with his
draw number. Students may draw
in groups of four or less. All draw
cards of a group must be
presented together at the draw
window. Once a person has drawn
a number, he may not recall his
card to draw with a group. All
members of a group must have the
same first choice; all group
choices must precede any
individual choices.
Hoskins-Ma n/.anila
Draw procedures for current
residents of Hoskins and
Manzanita and for students
drawing with them have already
been communicated to current
residents. Students not presently
residing in Hoskins or Manzanita
who are not drawing in with a
current resident must draw in a
group of either four (lor
Manzanita or Manzanita and
Hoskins) or two (for Hoskins) All
members of the group must be
eligible for the draw.
A group drawing for either
Hoskins or Manzanita must list.
Hoskins or Manzanita as its first
choice; a group listing both
Hoskins and Manzanita as choices
must list them as its first two
choices.
Two seniors drawing for
Hoskins eligible for a space in the
housing system will be given
priority for Hoskins after current
residents of Hoskins Seniors
