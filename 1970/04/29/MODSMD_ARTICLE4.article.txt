# Sit-in Set For Pitzer's Office, Building Closed For 30 Days
## 
### LARKY DIAMOND JOHN SLOAN 
The Off-ROTC movement
voted last night to sit-in President
Kenneth Pitzer's office today.
Early this morning, administrators
ordered the building closed for 30
days.
Students illegally entering the
building would be brought before
the Stanford Judicial Council and
be liable to arrest. (Text of the
declaration ordering the building
closed is printed below.]
In its meeting last night, the
Movement chose the Old Union,
site of a sit-in last week, as its

secondary target. The site and
tactics for the sit-in were decided
a four-hour meeting
Those at the meeting voted to
keep the sit-in non-violent and
non-destructive, but decided it
should be disruptive.
A University spokesman said
that President Pitzer is now in
Washington, DC. on official
business.
Files Removed
About 1:15 am, today,
University policemen and officials
were observed removing files from
Building 10, which houses the
President's office.
Six windows were smashed at
Bowman Alumni House at about
12:50 a.m. today. At the same
time, students, faculty and a
security guard stood watch over
the Aero and Astro Building to
prevent a repetition of earlier
incidents of window-breaking.
Condem nation
The meeting began shortly alter
7:30, with the crowd at times
ranging up to 500 people and
spilling into courtyards and
doorways of Bishop Auditorium
in the Business School.
It opened with a condemnation
of the American military by two
members of the Movement for a
Democratic Military.
"There is now some basis for
unity between the student and the
GI movements. But that unity has
to be based on militancy. Gl's
don't relate to pacifism. So I say
right on to burning down ROTC."
The militant speech was
interrupted by scattered retorts
from unsympathetic observers in
the audience, which led to the
first of several heated verbal
exchanges that were to
characterize the first half of the
meeting.
The large number of
unsympathetic students in the

audience had apparently
responded to the new ASSU
Presidents' call for a large turnout
to vote against violent tactics at
the meeting.
Breakdown
Their presence prompted
several Off-ROTC members to call
for a liquidation of the open
meeting, and a breakdown into
affinity group meetings, to be
followed by a secret meeting of a
coordinating committee.
Some in the Off-ROTC
movement voiced anger at the
alleged infiltration of their
meeting by those who did not
support their demands. "The first
order of business is for the four
Council of Presidents members to
get the fuck out of here, since
their intentions aren't to help us
from offing ROTC, but to keep us
from making any kind of decision
at all," one declared.
Amidst both angry heckling
and shouts of "let him speak,"
Council of Presidents member
Bob Grant assumed the
microphone. Unable to complete
his comments due to heckling
from the audience, he began, "We
came here for one purpose, to
express the feeling that this
community cannot accept
violence as a tactic of removing
ROTC."
After more bitter comments
from the audience, and an
admission on his part that he did
not favor the removal of ROTC
Grant continued, "We aren't here
to stop you from doing anything
that is non-violent and legal."
Non-Supporters Leave
Amid more jeering, he
concluded, "This meeting is
getting angry. We've made our
point. Thank you for coming."
With that, approximately 100
of his supporters left the
overflowing auditorium, and the
meeting continued with what
appeared to be mostly Off-ROTC
sympathizers. As more supporters
continued to file in from outside
the room, the size of the crowd
rose to more than 450, and never
fell below 300.
But differences, often bitter
and angry, remained. In the
charged atmosphere, divisions
between those advocating violent
tactics and those advocating
non-violence became sharply
focused.
Do It?
Debate swung through the
evening between non-destructive
action and the "Do It-To It"
strategy, which involves breaking
windows and promoting other
property damage to make it too
costly for ROTC to remain on
campus.
Janet Weiss argued that

physical damage to the University
could definitely force ROTC out,
while non-violent tactics carried
no certainty of victory.
Buzz Hamburg, leader of the
"Madera Affinity Group" argued,
"There is no certainty that violent
tactics will work unless we are
prepared to bomb the buildings,
which I don't think we are
prepared to do."
Instead, he argued for a
non-violent mobile sit-in, from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., which would force
on President Pitzer the dilemma
of permitting it to continue, or
calling in the police in broad
daylight.
In support of this, one speaker
commented, "We can't lose. If
they bust an 8 to 5 sit-in the
Administration will totally
de-legitimize their position. If
they don't bust it, it will build a
mass movement in a few days."
Sit-In Boost
The sit-in idea gained a further
boost later in the evening when
Rick Atkins rushed in with an
announcement that 15 professors
were meeting, and had decided
upon support for a statement by
Linus Pauling. The statement,
made at noon, encouraged
peaceful protest.
According to a leader of the
new faculty group, however, the
group never voted formally on the
issue, or on any official statement.
The individual professors
expressed support for Pauling's
remarks yesterday and many
expressed willingness to join a
non-violent, 8 to 5 sit-in in the
Old Union.
Destroy Building
Some at the Off-ROTC meeting
spoke charging that a "passive,
respectable sit-in is exactly what
the university would be happy
with." Those who sat in would
have to make it clear that they
would destroy the building if
there was a bust, these spokesmen
charged.
Still another called for guerilla
tactics, claiming, "The burning of
the Behavioral Science Building,
which none of us did, had more of
an affect on this university than
anything we have done."
Guerillas
D. MeGuire arrested in Friday's
bust, called for organizing the
affinity groups along the lines of
guerilla bands, and publishing a
list of valuable targets for
terrorism on campus.
Tom Forstenzer later
responded to the growing division
in strategy by calling for the
group to split openly, which
Bruce Franklin answered with the
most widely applauded statement
of the evening.
He argued that non-violent
action like sit-in could work with
destructive action to help raise the
price of keeping ROTC on
campus. "People should take
non-violent action if they believe
in that, but they should realize
that there will be other people,
most not in this room, who will
take other action."
Setting the stage for the rest of

the meeting, Franklin urged the
group to get on with the business
of planning the non-violent
action, since any violent action
would clearly be planned in
secret.
Yale Braunstein agreed.
"People who are going to kidnap
Lyman and hold him for ransom
'til we get out of Southeast Asia
aren't going to plan that in an
open meeting, and I say Right
On."
Votes, Votes, Votes
A series of proposals, votes,
counter proposals and counter
votes followed until the final
decisions were reached.
The first vote attempted to
determine where the sit-in would
take place, and at what time.
However this vote was never
completed due to complications
arising from who would vote and
whether the sit-in would start last
night or this morning.
The sites mentioned were
Bishop Auditorium, the Business
School, the Old Union, President
Pitzer's Office, Eneina and the
Computer Center. The time was
either to be continuous from
when the meeting ended or
beginning at 8:00 this morning. A
noon rally was suggested but met
with little support.
The vote was continually
interrupted until it was finally
decided that the most opportune
time to begin the sit-in would be
this morning. Those wanting to
participate were given the right to
decide what time the sit-in would
end.
Throughout the voting the
meeting teatered on the brink of
becoming a shouting match. The
wide variety of proposals seemed
to confuse many of those present.
Those people who have been
enjoined by court order decided
to meet outside the President's
office at 8:00 to help the sit-in in
any way possible without entering
the building.
Pursuant to the authority vested in
me by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council in legislation enacted on April
19, 1970, I find that the presence of
persons in the immediate vicinity of
the Office of the President presents a
danger to the records, equipment and
property therein, and I hereby declare
that building closed for 30 days to all
persons not authorized to be there by
my designees Dan DeVoung, Bruce
Wiggins, Thomas Bell, William
Wullschleger, Donald Lillie, Cart
Gielitz, Herbert Gottschalk, Charles
Rayer, Richard Sanguinetti, Herman
Williams and Wayne Warwick. Persons
eligible for authorization to enter are
University employees normally
employed there, University employees
authorized to be there by any of the
foregoing named persons for the
purpose of maintaining security in the
building, and other persons who have
business to transact with such an
authorized person if that authorized
person consents to their entry.
Any student who enters or remains
in the Office of the President in
violation of this order will be charged
appropriately before the Stanford
Judicial Council.
In addition, any person not
authorized who enters or remains in
the Office of the President—faculty,
students, staff and others —is in
violation of the law and subject to
arrest
