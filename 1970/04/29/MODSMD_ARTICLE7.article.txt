Boycott Mis truth
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a matter of record, it is
essential, I believe, to point out
that the statement about the
boycott that appeared in the
Daily of April 27 did NOT, at the
time I signed it, include the
sentence "We, the undersigned
faculty members, support the
anti-ROTC movement and call for
a boycott on Monday and
Tuesday."
Peter Stansky
ASSU Council and ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
We neither support nor accept
the OFF-ROTC MOVEMENT for
these reasons:
1. They have openly rejected
the majority decision expressed in
the student referendum of April
»15th and 16th.
2. They have bypassed
* legitimate channels of action.
• 3. They have insisted upon
I immediate actions to implement
their goals, actions which would
abrogate the integrity of academic
decision-making groups and the
University's obligations to ROTC
Cadets already enrolled.
We reject all groups which
! foster disruptive sit-ins, smashing
windows or other forms of
violence. Any person or persons
resorting to these actions must be
subject to arrest and prosecution
if the safety of autonomy of the
University are to be maintained.
We cannot tolerate violence on
campus regardless of the cause.
For those who wish to reform
ROTC by non-violent means, we
offer these alternative actions:
1. One focus of effort
concerning the ROTC issue should
be the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. If any
branches of the service submit
requests for academic credit, this
committee will determine whether
ROTC classes should receive it.
The members of this committee
must be presented with the
arguments in support of the
student viewpoint.
2. On Tuesday, the partially
reconstituted Advisory
Committee on ROTC began the
examination of the future status
of ROTC at this University. The
ROTC Committee's previous
recommendations to the President
and to the Academic Senate were
based upon the assumption that
the best possible terms for the
contract had been negotiated. We
now know that other institutions
have negotiated NO CREDIT
contracts. In addition, new
proposals for draft legislation
must be taken into account. The
advisory Committee on ROTC
must be presented with
information on the proper
relationship that ROTC should
have with the University

especially with regard to academic
credit and punitive clauses.
3. The members of the
Academic Senate must be
presented on an individual basis
with the same arguments before
the Senate makes any final
decision on the status of ROTC.

Reason and Windows
Editor, THE DAILY:
Rationality is a tool. It serves
many masters. But let us not be
enslaved by it. Broken windows
equal scarred lives. Occupying a
building equals dropping a bomb.
Violence—that abstract—con
veniently unites the two.
Choose a side and rationally
defend it. Flip a coin, pick a side,
and intellectualize. Heads it's
windows, tails it's lives. And the
sharper you are, the better case
you can make. A better case. And
then pretty soon you forget
you're carrying a case—you get
lost in it and think that it's a total
environment. I guess it's pretty
hard to see out of a shut case.
I am not against rationality.
But I am FOR something
more—for sensitivity, for the
strength to be positive. It's not
hard to criticize. It's much more
difficult to love. It's easy for
Professor Robert Moffat to think
in terms of animals—because
animals are lower beings—right?
Human beings broke those
windows Mr. Moffat—human
beings like you. Human beings
who are confronting a complex
world. Maybe smashing windows
is a simplistic answer. But to
consider the issue at that level—to
spend your time thinking about
broken, windows—is too simple a
response, Mr. Moffat. Think about
it.

Neither side is perfect—but
then, you have a chance to
improve yourself, to grow
sensitive to the complexity; and
that is an exciting task. And the
larger you are, the better for you
and everyone else .Do it in hope (to
apply a rational argument) that
those who break windows will
grow more sensitive themselves.
The important dialogue is not
in rationality. It is in example, in
faith. Here is a fact (Primate
Ethology p. 236): people
watching young monkeys can
almost always tell when the
monkeys are playing. But trained
monkey-watchers can't come
close to isolating the criteria that
distinguish play from non-play
behavior. When monkeys are
playing, you KNOW it. There isn't
any need to cut it up. Think
about it.
When John Shoch says he won,
he doesn't mean that Pat Shea
lost. Think about it—be sensitive
to it.
But it's easier for Prof.
Rhinelander to sketch out a
rational argument supporting the
bust of the sit-in; after all, there

were non-students there.
Non-students of what?
The ROTC movement has—if
you've been sensitive to it—been
asking very basic questions, has
been speaking to basic
assumptions. Stop cluttering up
your minds with images of broken
windows. There are bigger things
to think about.

Speech and Drama
Editor, The Daily:
In the elections of last week,
the Speech and Drama
referendum which "strongly urges
the Administration to reconsider
its pending decision to severely
cut back the Stanford Speech and
Drama Department" passed with
approximately an 80% majority,
3849 to 935. There may be
several reasons why students so
over-whelmingly supported this
proposition.
The best reason for protesting
the outrageous cut back of the
Speech department by 80% is that
Stanford has the responsibility of
providing a liberal education, and
of meeting the curriculum
demands of the undergraduates,
even in the face of a major
financial cirsis.
Mrs. Jane Stanford felt that the
university should be designed for
the betterment of mankind by
making available a liberal
education. Sixty-five years later,
the Study of Education at
Stanford points out that
"Education at Stanford demands
great freedom of choice and

independent decision . . . This
freedom to choose what
knowledge and what disciplines to
learn may be Stanford's greatest
gift to the student."
Off Liberal Education
In 1967-68 969 students
enrolled in Speech classes. The
enrollment for 1968-69 was 1150.
This year 1000 students chose to
enroll in Speech courses. Yet, the
Administration has decided to
eliminate this discipline.
Stanford's priorities are not in
providing an education in the
humanities. We are given
utilitarian, marketable educational
experiences, and not education
for the betterment of our person.
In times of budget crises we
observe that Stanford violates the
tradition of its founders, the will
of the students (even after a 15%
increase in tuition), and the spirit
of liberal education.
Faculty Initiative
Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of
America's greatest thinkers,
believed that, "The secret of
education lies in respecting the
pupil". Now is the time to protest
the disrespect that the
Administration has shown to its
undergraduates by eliminating the
Speech program. The student
body has made its position clear
in the recent referendum. The
hope is that faculty members,
who verbally support the value of
liberal education and the principle
of responding to the educational
needs of undergraduates, will
more to reinstate the Speech
Department.

Rationality is a tool. It serves
many masters. But let us not be
enslaved by it. Broken windows
equal scarred lives. Occupying a
building equals dropping a bomb.
Violence—that abstract—con
veniently unites the two.
Choose a side and rationally
defend it. Flip a coin, pick a side,
and intellectualize. Heads it's
windows, tails it's lives. And the
sharper you are, the better case
you can make. A better case. And
then pretty soon you forget
you're carrying a case—you get
lost in it and think that it's a total
environment. I guess it's pretty
hard to see out of a shut case.
I am not against rationality.
But I am FOR something
more—for sensitivity, for the
strength to be positive. It's not
hard to criticize. It's much more
difficult to love. It's easy for
Professor Robert Moffat to think
in terms of animals—because
animals are lower beings—right?
Human beings broke those
windows Mr. Moffat—human
beings like you. Human beings
who are confronting a complex
world. Maybe smashing windows
is a simplistic answer. But to
consider the issue at that level—to
spend your time thinking about
broken, windows—is too simple a
response, Mr. Moffat. Think about
it.

Neither side is perfect—but
then, you have a chance to
improve yourself, to grow
sensitive to the complexity; and
that is an exciting task. And the
larger you are, the better for you
and everyone else .Do it in hope (to
apply a rational argument) that
those who break windows will
grow more sensitive themselves.
The important dialogue is not
in rationality. It is in example, in
faith. Here is a fact (Primate
Ethology p. 236): people
watching young monkeys can
almost always tell when the
monkeys are playing. But trained
monkey-watchers can't come
close to isolating the criteria that
distinguish play from non-play
behavior. When monkeys are
playing, you KNOW it. There isn't
any need to cut it up. Think
about it.
When John Shoch says he won,
he doesn't mean that Pat Shea
lost. Think about it—be sensitive
to it.
But it's easier for Prof.
Rhinelander to sketch out a
rational argument supporting the
bust of the sit-in; after all, there

were non-students there.
Non-students of what?
The ROTC movement has—if
you've been sensitive to it—been
asking very basic questions, has
been speaking to basic
assumptions. Stop cluttering up
your minds with images of broken
windows. There are bigger things
to think about.

Editor, The Daily:
In the elections of last week,
the Speech and Drama
referendum which "strongly urges
the Administration to reconsider
its pending decision to severely
cut back the Stanford Speech and
Drama Department" passed with
approximately an 80% majority,
3849 to 935. There may be
several reasons why students so
over-whelmingly supported this
proposition.
The best reason for protesting
the outrageous cut back of the
Speech department by 80% is that
Stanford has the responsibility of
providing a liberal education, and
of meeting the curriculum
demands of the undergraduates,
even in the face of a major
financial cirsis.
Mrs. Jane Stanford felt that the
university should be designed for
the betterment of mankind by
making available a liberal
education. Sixty-five years later,
the Study of Education at
Stanford points out that
"Education at Stanford demands
great freedom of choice and

independent decision . . . This
freedom to choose what
knowledge and what disciplines to
learn may be Stanford's greatest
gift to the student."
Off Liberal Education
In 1967-68 969 students
enrolled in Speech classes. The
enrollment for 1968-69 was 1150.
This year 1000 students chose to
enroll in Speech courses. Yet, the
Administration has decided to
eliminate this discipline.
Stanford's priorities are not in
providing an education in the
humanities. We are given
utilitarian, marketable educational
experiences, and not education
for the betterment of our person.
In times of budget crises we
observe that Stanford violates the
tradition of its founders, the will
of the students (even after a 15%
increase in tuition), and the spirit
of liberal education.
Faculty Initiative
Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of
America's greatest thinkers,
believed that, "The secret of
education lies in respecting the
pupil". Now is the time to protest
the disrespect that the
Administration has shown to its
undergraduates by eliminating the
Speech program. The student
body has made its position clear
in the recent referendum. The
hope is that faculty members,
who verbally support the value of
liberal education and the principle
of responding to the educational
needs of undergraduates, will
more to reinstate the Speech
Department.

Rationality is a tool. It serves
many masters. But let us not be
enslaved by it. Broken windows
equal scarred lives. Occupying a
building equals dropping a bomb.
Violence—that abstract—con
veniently unites the two.
Choose a side and rationally
defend it. Flip a coin, pick a side,
and intellectualize. Heads it's
windows, tails it's lives. And the
sharper you are, the better case
you can make. A better case. And
then pretty soon you forget
you're carrying a case—you get
lost in it and think that it's a total
environment. I guess it's pretty
hard to see out of a shut case.
I am not against rationality.
But I am FOR something
more—for sensitivity, for the
strength to be positive. It's not
hard to criticize. It's much more
difficult to love. It's easy for
Professor Robert Moffat to think
in terms of animals—because
animals are lower beings—right?
Human beings broke those
windows Mr. Moffat—human
beings like you. Human beings
who are confronting a complex
world. Maybe smashing windows
is a simplistic answer. But to
consider the issue at that level—to
spend your time thinking about
broken, windows—is too simple a
response, Mr. Moffat. Think about
it.

Neither side is perfect—but
then, you have a chance to
improve yourself, to grow
sensitive to the complexity; and
that is an exciting task. And the
larger you are, the better for you
and everyone else .Do it in hope (to
apply a rational argument) that
those who break windows will
grow more sensitive themselves.
The important dialogue is not
in rationality. It is in example, in
faith. Here is a fact (Primate
Ethology p. 236): people
watching young monkeys can
almost always tell when the
monkeys are playing. But trained
monkey-watchers can't come
close to isolating the criteria that
distinguish play from non-play
behavior. When monkeys are
playing, you KNOW it. There isn't
any need to cut it up. Think
about it.
When John Shoch says he won,
he doesn't mean that Pat Shea
lost. Think about it—be sensitive
to it.
But it's easier for Prof.
Rhinelander to sketch out a
rational argument supporting the
bust of the sit-in; after all, there

were non-students there.
Non-students of what?
The ROTC movement has—if
you've been sensitive to it—been
asking very basic questions, has
been speaking to basic
assumptions. Stop cluttering up
your minds with images of broken
windows. There are bigger things
to think about.

Speech and Drama
Editor, The Daily:
In the elections of last week,
the Speech and Drama
referendum which "strongly urges
the Administration to reconsider
its pending decision to severely
cut back the Stanford Speech and
Drama Department" passed with
approximately an 80% majority,
3849 to 935. There may be
several reasons why students so
over-whelmingly supported this
proposition.
The best reason for protesting
the outrageous cut back of the
Speech department by 80% is that
Stanford has the responsibility of
providing a liberal education, and
of meeting the curriculum
demands of the undergraduates,
even in the face of a major
financial cirsis.
Mrs. Jane Stanford felt that the
university should be designed for
the betterment of mankind by
making available a liberal
education. Sixty-five years later,
the Study of Education at
Stanford points out that
"Education at Stanford demands
great freedom of choice and

independent decision . . . This
freedom to choose what
knowledge and what disciplines to
learn may be Stanford's greatest
gift to the student."
Off Liberal Education
In 1967-68 969 students
enrolled in Speech classes. The
enrollment for 1968-69 was 1150.
This year 1000 students chose to
enroll in Speech courses. Yet, the
Administration has decided to
eliminate this discipline.
Stanford's priorities are not in
providing an education in the
humanities. We are given
utilitarian, marketable educational
experiences, and not education
for the betterment of our person.
In times of budget crises we
observe that Stanford violates the
tradition of its founders, the will
of the students (even after a 15%
increase in tuition), and the spirit
of liberal education.
Faculty Initiative
Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of
America's greatest thinkers,
believed that, "The secret of
education lies in respecting the
pupil". Now is the time to protest
the disrespect that the
Administration has shown to its
undergraduates by eliminating the
Speech program. The student
body has made its position clear
in the recent referendum. The
hope is that faculty members,
who verbally support the value of
liberal education and the principle
of responding to the educational
needs of undergraduates, will
more to reinstate the Speech
Department.

Rationality is a tool. It serves
many masters. But let us not be
enslaved by it. Broken windows
equal scarred lives. Occupying a
building equals dropping a bomb.
Violence—that abstract—con
veniently unites the two.
Choose a side and rationally
defend it. Flip a coin, pick a side,
and intellectualize. Heads it's
windows, tails it's lives. And the
sharper you are, the better case
you can make. A better case. And
then pretty soon you forget
you're carrying a case—you get
lost in it and think that it's a total
environment. I guess it's pretty
hard to see out of a shut case.
I am not against rationality.
But I am FOR something
more—for sensitivity, for the
strength to be positive. It's not
hard to criticize. It's much more
difficult to love. It's easy for
Professor Robert Moffat to think
in terms of animals—because
animals are lower beings—right?
Human beings broke those
windows Mr. Moffat—human
beings like you. Human beings
who are confronting a complex
world. Maybe smashing windows
is a simplistic answer. But to
consider the issue at that level—to
spend your time thinking about
broken, windows—is too simple a
response, Mr. Moffat. Think about
it.

Neither side is perfect—but
then, you have a chance to
improve yourself, to grow
sensitive to the complexity; and
that is an exciting task. And the
larger you are, the better for you
and everyone else .Do it in hope (to
apply a rational argument) that
those who break windows will
grow more sensitive themselves.
The important dialogue is not
in rationality. It is in example, in
faith. Here is a fact (Primate
Ethology p. 236): people
watching young monkeys can
almost always tell when the
monkeys are playing. But trained
monkey-watchers can't come
close to isolating the criteria that
distinguish play from non-play
behavior. When monkeys are
playing, you KNOW it. There isn't
any need to cut it up. Think
about it.
When John Shoch says he won,
he doesn't mean that Pat Shea
lost. Think about it—be sensitive
to it.
But it's easier for Prof.
Rhinelander to sketch out a
rational argument supporting the
bust of the sit-in; after all, there

were non-students there.
Non-students of what?
The ROTC movement has—if
you've been sensitive to it—been
asking very basic questions, has
been speaking to basic
assumptions. Stop cluttering up
your minds with images of broken
windows. There are bigger things
to think about.

Speech and Drama
Editor, The Daily:
In the elections of last week,
the Speech and Drama
referendum which "strongly urges
the Administration to reconsider
its pending decision to severely
cut back the Stanford Speech and
Drama Department" passed with
approximately an 80% majority,
3849 to 935. There may be
several reasons why students so
over-whelmingly supported this
proposition.
The best reason for protesting
the outrageous cut back of the
Speech department by 80% is that
Stanford has the responsibility of
providing a liberal education, and
of meeting the curriculum
demands of the undergraduates,
even in the face of a major
financial cirsis.
Mrs. Jane Stanford felt that the
university should be designed for
the betterment of mankind by
making available a liberal
education. Sixty-five years later,
the Study of Education at
Stanford points out that
"Education at Stanford demands
great freedom of choice and

independent decision . . . This
freedom to choose what
knowledge and what disciplines to
learn may be Stanford's greatest
gift to the student."
Off Liberal Education
In 1967-68 969 students
enrolled in Speech classes. The
enrollment for 1968-69 was 1150.
This year 1000 students chose to
enroll in Speech courses. Yet, the
Administration has decided to
eliminate this discipline.
Stanford's priorities are not in
providing an education in the
humanities. We are given
utilitarian, marketable educational
experiences, and not education
for the betterment of our person.
In times of budget crises we
observe that Stanford violates the
tradition of its founders, the will
of the students (even after a 15%
increase in tuition), and the spirit
of liberal education.
Faculty Initiative
Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of
America's greatest thinkers,
believed that, "The secret of
education lies in respecting the
pupil". Now is the time to protest
the disrespect that the
Administration has shown to its
undergraduates by eliminating the
Speech program. The student
body has made its position clear
in the recent referendum. The
hope is that faculty members,
who verbally support the value of
liberal education and the principle
of responding to the educational
needs of undergraduates, will
more to reinstate the Speech
Department.

Boycott Mis truth
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a matter of record, it is
essential, I believe, to point out
that the statement about the
boycott that appeared in the
Daily of April 27 did NOT, at the
time I signed it, include the
sentence "We, the undersigned
faculty members, support the
anti-ROTC movement and call for
a boycott on Monday and
Tuesday."
Peter Stansky
ASSU Council and ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
We neither support nor accept
the OFF-ROTC MOVEMENT for
these reasons:
1. They have openly rejected
the majority decision expressed in
the student referendum of April
»15th and 16th.
2. They have bypassed
* legitimate channels of action.
• 3. They have insisted upon
I immediate actions to implement
their goals, actions which would
abrogate the integrity of academic
decision-making groups and the
University's obligations to ROTC
Cadets already enrolled.
We reject all groups which
! foster disruptive sit-ins, smashing
windows or other forms of
violence. Any person or persons
resorting to these actions must be
subject to arrest and prosecution
if the safety of autonomy of the
University are to be maintained.
We cannot tolerate violence on
campus regardless of the cause.
For those who wish to reform
ROTC by non-violent means, we
offer these alternative actions:
1. One focus of effort
concerning the ROTC issue should
be the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. If any
branches of the service submit
requests for academic credit, this
committee will determine whether
ROTC classes should receive it.
The members of this committee
must be presented with the
arguments in support of the
student viewpoint.
2. On Tuesday, the partially
reconstituted Advisory
Committee on ROTC began the
examination of the future status
of ROTC at this University. The
ROTC Committee's previous
recommendations to the President
and to the Academic Senate were
based upon the assumption that
the best possible terms for the
contract had been negotiated. We
now know that other institutions
have negotiated NO CREDIT
contracts. In addition, new
proposals for draft legislation
must be taken into account. The
advisory Committee on ROTC
must be presented with
information on the proper
relationship that ROTC should
have with the University

especially with regard to academic
credit and punitive clauses.
3. The members of the
Academic Senate must be
presented on an individual basis
with the same arguments before
the Senate makes any final
decision on the status of ROTC.
