# Costs Of Struggle
## Is ROTC Really Worth It? 
### Michael Sweeney 
Should we continue our
struggle? Is it worth it?
The cost to the Off-ROTC
movement increases. Thirty-one
people face court prosecution.;
dozens more will be penalized by
the campus judicial council.
Thousands of dollars will be taken
from our pockets for fines and
legal defense. The fatigue and
strain are unrelenting. Abuse
from our opponents has reached
the level of death-threats.
The administration is
intransigent. Apparently without
hesitation.it spreads lies to justify
ROTC. The lies are exposed and
Lyman thinks up some new ones.
When we act in protest, he
responds with massive police
over-kill.
Faced with this repression,
most students are unwilling to
join us in any serious protest. We
may have their sympathies, and
we certainly have their rapt
attention, but we cannot expect
to mobilize the uncommitted
students when commitment is the
only sustaining force.
ROTC Leaving?
In face of these problems,

ROTC itself may seem to be
hardly worth the effort. The
program is a decimated skeleton.
Academic credit seems surely
denied. Air Force ROTC is pulling
out, and Navy may follow. Army
ROTC enrollment of Stanford
students has fallen from 99 to 80
during our past three months of
agitation. The cadets go to class in
a locked, guarded building, and
flee to distant military bases to
drill.
Yet the Army hangs on,
doggedly. Colonel Ramey will give
no sign that Army ROTC will pull
out. He hopes to outlast the
movement. He is counting on the
administration and faculty to
accept the costs of the disruptions
we create.
Colonel Ramey can teach us
something. The Army's
determination may be the surest
sign that we must continue to
struggle against ROTC. Not only
does the Pentagon hope to boost
ROTC enrollments in the future,
but it recognizes the strategic
importance of Stanford in the
nationwide conflict over ROTC.

In the last two months, the
brushfire of anti-ROTC protests
has been leaping from campus to
campus. Stanford's movement
directly incited protests at
Berkeley, San Jose State, and
Foothill, according to radicals
there. Oregon, Pennsylvania and
Penn State continue to be in
turmoil, and now a sit-in has
started at the placid University of
Hawaii.
Stanford has become one of
the nationwide symbols of the
anti-ROTC struggle, as evidenced
by the coverage in Time magazine
and other media. This
development was anticipated a
year ago by Howard Brooks, a
local Pentagon consultant. An
interview with Brooks in Campus
Report noted, "the Defense
Department is facing the reality of
the 'domino theory.' Brooks
states that although ROTC
programs at Stanford and Ivy
League schools are expensive,
they represent prestige value.
'Already there are stirrings of
opposition to ROTC at state
institutions,' Brooks explains,
'and if the prestige schools drop
the programs, other schools well
could follow suit."
Brooks is confirming that our
movement has an impact reaching
far past the boundaries of this
campus. The target is not
Stanford ROTC alone, but the
nationwide program as well. Our
victory will be the shared victory
of our brothers and sisters at
many universities. The news that
ROTC is finished at Stanford will
give real assistance to other
anti-ROTC movements.
Sharp Enrollment Drop

The Pentagon is justly worried
about the health of the
nationwide program. ROTC
enrollment at 353 campuses
across the country fell 25 percent
in 1969 alone (at Stanford the
drop was 29 percent). A major
cause, according to Army ROTC
director Melvin Goers, is
"anti-ROTC activities on some
campuses and adverse publicity."
In the March issue of Army
ROTC Newsletter, Lt. Gen. A.O.
Conner noted that ROTC has
produced 65 percent of all new
officers for the Army in the past
five years. The high-cost military
academies like West Point would

have to be expanded 20-fold to
replace ROTC. The only other
alternative is Officer Candidate
School (OCS). The Pentagon's
Benson Committee on ROTC
rejected OCS as a substitute in its
1969 report:
"None of the services. . .
considers that the needs for
officers could be met by
substituting OCS for their ROTC
programs. Officers of all services
find that the extended contact of
ROTC officer instructors with
ROTC cadets on campus for two
or four years makes a real
addition to the depth of the
ROTC product."
ROTC Counteroffensive
Clearly the Pentagon is not
going to allow ROTC to fade
away. A major counteroffensive
has started to boost
enrollments. Scholarships and
stipends to cadets will be greatly
expanded - perhaps doubled. As
the carrot gets larger, so does the
stick. Nixon announced last week
that ROTC will soon by the only
way for a student to get a draft
deferment. A big boost in ROTC
enrollment is expected to follow.
Together, Nixon, the Army
and Pitzer have posed a real test
of our commitment to ending the
war in Southeast Asia. The
government has decided to take
extraordinary measures to bolster
the nationwide ROTC program.
Pitzer (under orders no doubt) has
shown a vicious readiness to
defend ROTC at any cost.
Meanwhile the struggle over
ROTC at Stanford has taken on a
more urgent significance.
ROTC at Stanford will be
weakest and most vulnerable
between now and the end of the
quarter. Next fall it may be firmly
retrenched, - here and at other
campuses. By September, the end
of the student deferment will have
stabilized ROTC enrollments, and
student movements will have lost
much of their vigor over the
summer; Our best chance to off
ROTC is now. We can create the
conditions that will make it
impossible for ROTC to continue.
