PLEASE ASK MILITANT FRIENDS
FOR PEACE.
1000 students every year enroll in the Speech
Department. The recent cut back will eli
minate all but one instructor by the end of
next year. In the recent election 80% of
the voters asked the Administration to re
consider its decision. Now is the time f< r ail
the members of the faculty who have verbal
ly supported the ideal of liberal education
and responsiveness to the educational neids
of undergraduates to
MOVE TO REINSTATE SPEECH.
Off-ROTC people will you destroy the
campus in order to "save" it?
