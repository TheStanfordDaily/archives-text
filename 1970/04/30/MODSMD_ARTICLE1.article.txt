# Violent Fights Erupt After Sit-in; Students Battle Police For 4 Hours
## 
### 
The Stanford campus exploded
in violent street fighting last night
after sheriff's deputies, acting at
the administration's request,
'■nded a non-violent anti-ROTC
sit-in at the Old Union.
Sixteen demonstrators were
arrested and at least 10 injured;

The Off-ROTC movement
slated a 12:30 p.m. rally today on
White Plaza to discuss Cambodia,
what happened last night and
early this morning, and the shape
of the movement in the future.
A meeting was also called for
7:30 p.m. tonight in the Old
Union courtyard to plan further
action. Members of the Movement
were urged to "bring everything
you'll need to the meeting," one
radical who did not want his name
used said.
"We will be out Thursday night
and every night until ROTC is
offed," he added.

police officials reported that 30
deputies were injured by thrown
objects. The Stanford Hospital
reported one demonstrator and 6
police treated, all for minor
lacerations.
About 800 protestors roamed
the campus from the Old Union

to Encina and ROTC to the
Business School and back to the
Old Union in the course of the
evening.
As the demonstrations
intensified late last night,
deputies, numbering 274 at one time,
used tear gas in at least two
instances to disperse large groups
of militant protestors.
Intense Fighting
The most intense fighting broke
out between demonstrators and
police forces on White Plaza
shortly before 10:45 p.m., after
the police forced the
demonstrators out of the Old
Union courtyard following an
intense rock barrage aimed at
police in front of the Old Union.
Several hundred demonstrators
were still fighting with police after
1 a.m.
Wearing riot equipment, the
deputies charged repeatedly
through the mass of people on
White Plaza in what proved to be
a futile attempt to split the crowd
into smaller groups. The
demonstrators reformed after
every pincer movement.
At the height of the open
fighting last night, more than 200
deputies from departments

ranging from San Francisco to San
Jose, including the California
Highway Patrol, were massed
throughout the campus, with
additional forces arriving almost
constantly. One San Jose Captain
was reported knocked out for a
few seconds by a rock.
Near-Riot Stops
The near-riot ground to a halt
shortly after 1 a.m. today when
police dispersed most of the
crowd between Stern Hall and the
Undergraduate Library. Tear gas
was fired in efforts there to break
the demonstrators down into
smaller groups.
Windows were broken at the
Business School, UGLY and the
bookstore in addition to the
heavy damage at the Old Union,
Encina and the ROTC building.
"There is only one word to
describe the events of last night:
tragic," Pitzer said. "The seeds of
this unfortunate and senseless
violence have been sown over the
past several weeks. I urge all
members of the Stanford
community to remain calm and to
seek rational solutions to our
problems through peaceful
means."
ASSU Presidents
The ASSU Council of
Presidents issued the following
statement early this morning:
"This ghastly and horrifying
clash between police and students
plays into the hands of radicals
who have been calling for

continued violence and
destruction. The clash occurred
because of the polarization and
irrationality which has prevailed
on this campus for the past
weeks: it occurred because of
hysteria and hatred at the Old
Union.
"This campus must not panic.
Its problems will not be solved by
hatred or hysteria. We plead with
students to restore a sense of
rationality so that the events of
the past weeks can be sorted out
toward some constructive result."
Yesterday's protests began
shortly before 8 a.m., when a
handful of demonstrators arrived
at President Pitzer's office, which
had been ordered closed for 30
days Tuesday night by Provost
Richard Lyman in President
Pitzer's absence.
To Old Union
Meeting numerous
photographers and plainclothes
policemen, the demonstrators
moved immediately to the Old
Union, which was picked as the
secondary target for the sit-in
during a Tuesday night meeting.
The demonstrators met no
resistance as they entered and
about fifty began a peaceful sit-in.
They met through the morning in
the lobby, and decided shortly
before 11 a.m. to hold a march
through Quad and past some of
the larger dormitories to attract
more people to the sit-in.
The Santa Clara deputy

sheriffs, called to the campus
early in the morning by the threat
to Pitzer's office, left at
approximately 9:30 a.m. Some of
the deputies said that they had
been called at 2:45 a.m., and had
reported for duty in San Jose at 5
a.m.
The students, accompanied by
several faculty members,
continued their token sit-in
through lunch hour, and a crowd
of 350 gathered to watch the
Disruption Theater's production
of "Alice in ROTC-Land" on the
Old Union steps.
Discussion Groups
After the performance ended,
discussion groups met in and
around the building for several
hours. A meeting, beginning at
3:30, determined that the group
would stay in the building past
the normal 5 p.m. closing time.
President Pitzer, his trip to
Washington cut short by the
anti-ROTC protests ordered the
building closed from 5 p.m. to 8
a.m., in the same procedure
followed during the sit-in last
week, in an announcement made
to the meeting by Dean of
Students Peter Bulkeley. fitzer
offered the use of the Nitery for
an all-night vigil and teach-in.
Sergeant Dan Tamm and Captain
Thomas Rosa of the Santa Clara
sheriff's office advised the group
they were trespassing and
remained to talk with
demonstrators for 40 minutes.

objects. The Stanford Hospital
reported one demonstrator and 6
police treated, all for minor
lacerations.
About 800 protestors roamed
the campus from the Old Union

to Encina and ROTC to the
Business School and back to the
Old Union in the course of the
evening.
As the demonstrations
intensified late last night,
deputies, numbering 274 at one time,
used tear gas in at least two
instances to disperse large groups
of militant protestors.
Intense Fighting
The most intense fighting broke
out between demonstrators and
police forces on White Plaza
shortly before 10:45 p.m., after
the police forced the
demonstrators out of the Old
Union courtyard following an
intense rock barrage aimed at
police in front of the Old Union.
Several hundred demonstrators
were still fighting with police after
1 a.m.
Wearing riot equipment, the
deputies charged repeatedly
through the mass of people on
White Plaza in what proved to be
a futile attempt to split the crowd
into smaller groups. The
demonstrators reformed after
every pincer movement.
At the height of the open
fighting last night, more than 200
deputies from departments

ranging from San Francisco to San
Jose, including the California
Highway Patrol, were massed
throughout the campus, with
additional forces arriving almost
constantly. One San Jose Captain
was reported knocked out for a
few seconds by a rock.
Near-Riot Stops
The near-riot ground to a halt
shortly after 1 a.m. today when
police dispersed most of the
crowd between Stern Hall and the
Undergraduate Library. Tear gas
was fired in efforts there to break
the demonstrators down into
smaller groups.
Windows were broken at the
Business School, UGLY and the
bookstore in addition to the
heavy damage at the Old Union,
Encina and the ROTC building.
"There is only one word to
describe the events of last night:
tragic," Pitzer said. "The seeds of
this unfortunate and senseless
violence have been sown over the
past several weeks. I urge all
members of the Stanford
community to remain calm and to
seek rational solutions to our
problems through peaceful
means."
ASSU Presidents
The ASSU Council of
Presidents issued the following
statement early this morning:
"This ghastly and horrifying
clash between police and students
plays into the hands of radicals
who have been calling for

continued violence and
destruction. The clash occurred
because of the polarization and
irrationality which has prevailed
on this campus for the past
weeks: it occurred because of
hysteria and hatred at the Old
Union.
"This campus must not panic.
Its problems will not be solved by
hatred or hysteria. We plead with
students to restore a sense of
rationality so that the events of
the past weeks can be sorted out
toward some constructive result."
Yesterday's protests began
shortly before 8 a.m., when a
handful of demonstrators arrived
at President Pitzer's office, which
had been ordered closed for 30
days Tuesday night by Provost
Richard Lyman in President
Pitzer's absence.
To Old Union
Meeting numerous
photographers and plainclothes
policemen, the demonstrators
moved immediately to the Old
Union, which was picked as the
secondary target for the sit-in
during a Tuesday night meeting.
The demonstrators met no
resistance as they entered and
about fifty began a peaceful sit-in.
They met through the morning in
the lobby, and decided shortly
before 11 a.m. to hold a march
through Quad and past some of
the larger dormitories to attract
more people to the sit-in.
The Santa Clara deputy

sheriffs, called to the campus
early in the morning by the threat
to Pitzer's office, left at
approximately 9:30 a.m. Some of
the deputies said that they had
been called at 2:45 a.m., and had
reported for duty in San Jose at 5
a.m.
The students, accompanied by
several faculty members,
continued their token sit-in
through lunch hour, and a crowd
of 350 gathered to watch the
Disruption Theater's production
of "Alice in ROTC-Land" on the
Old Union steps.
Discussion Groups
After the performance ended,
discussion groups met in and
around the building for several
hours. A meeting, beginning at
3:30, determined that the group
would stay in the building past
the normal 5 p.m. closing time.
President Pitzer, his trip to
Washington cut short by the
anti-ROTC protests ordered the
building closed from 5 p.m. to 8
a.m., in the same procedure
followed during the sit-in last
week, in an announcement made
to the meeting by Dean of
Students Peter Bulkeley. fitzer
offered the use of the Nitery for
an all-night vigil and teach-in.
Sergeant Dan Tamm and Captain
Thomas Rosa of the Santa Clara
sheriff's office advised the group
they were trespassing and
remained to talk with
demonstrators for 40 minutes.

into smaller groups. The
demonstrators reformed after
every pincer movement.
At the height of the open
fighting last night, more than 200
deputies from departments

ranging from San Francisco to San
Jose, including the California
Highway Patrol, were massed
throughout the campus, with
additional forces arriving almost
constantly. One San Jose Captain
was reported knocked out for a
few seconds by a rock.
Near-Riot Stops
The near-riot ground to a halt
shortly after 1 a.m. today when
police dispersed most of the
crowd between Stern Hall and the
Undergraduate Library. Tear gas
was fired in efforts there to break
the demonstrators down into
smaller groups.
Windows were broken at the
Business School, UGLY and the
bookstore in addition to the
heavy damage at the Old Union,
Encina and the ROTC building.
"There is only one word to
describe the events of last night:
tragic," Pitzer said. "The seeds of
this unfortunate and senseless
violence have been sown over the
past several weeks. I urge all
members of the Stanford
community to remain calm and to
seek rational solutions to our
problems through peaceful
means."
ASSU Presidents
The ASSU Council of
Presidents issued the following
statement early this morning:
"This ghastly and horrifying
clash between police and students
plays into the hands of radicals
who have been calling for

continued violence and
destruction. The clash occurred
because of the polarization and
irrationality which has prevailed
on this campus for the past
weeks: it occurred because of
hysteria and hatred at the Old
Union.
"This campus must not panic.
Its problems will not be solved by
hatred or hysteria. We plead with
students to restore a sense of
rationality so that the events of
the past weeks can be sorted out
toward some constructive result."
Yesterday's protests began
shortly before 8 a.m., when a
handful of demonstrators arrived
at President Pitzer's office, which
had been ordered closed for 30
days Tuesday night by Provost
Richard Lyman in President
Pitzer's absence.
To Old Union
Meeting numerous
photographers and plainclothes
policemen, the demonstrators
moved immediately to the Old
Union, which was picked as the
secondary target for the sit-in
during a Tuesday night meeting.
The demonstrators met no
resistance as they entered and
about fifty began a peaceful sit-in.
They met through the morning in
the lobby, and decided shortly
before 11 a.m. to hold a march
through Quad and past some of
the larger dormitories to attract
more people to the sit-in.
The Santa Clara deputy

sheriffs, called to the campus
early in the morning by the threat
to Pitzer's office, left at
approximately 9:30 a.m. Some of
the deputies said that they had
been called at 2:45 a.m., and had
reported for duty in San Jose at 5
a.m.
The students, accompanied by
several faculty members,
continued their token sit-in
through lunch hour, and a crowd
of 350 gathered to watch the
Disruption Theater's production
of "Alice in ROTC-Land" on the
Old Union steps.
Discussion Groups
After the performance ended,
discussion groups met in and
around the building for several
hours. A meeting, beginning at
3:30, determined that the group
would stay in the building past
the normal 5 p.m. closing time.
President Pitzer, his trip to
Washington cut short by the
anti-ROTC protests ordered the
building closed from 5 p.m. to 8
a.m., in the same procedure
followed during the sit-in last
week, in an announcement made
to the meeting by Dean of
Students Peter Bulkeley. fitzer
offered the use of the Nitery for
an all-night vigil and teach-in.
Sergeant Dan Tamm and Captain
Thomas Rosa of the Santa Clara
sheriff's office advised the group
they were trespassing and
remained to talk with
demonstrators for 40 minutes.

C ONFRONTATION —A policeman holds his ground outside the Old Union in
face of hostile students.
The Stanford campus exploded
in violent street fighting last night
after sheriff's deputies, acting at
the administration's request,
'■nded a non-violent anti-ROTC
sit-in at the Old Union.
Sixteen demonstrators were
arrested and at least 10 injured;

The Off-ROTC movement
slated a 12:30 p.m. rally today on
White Plaza to discuss Cambodia,
what happened last night and
early this morning, and the shape
of the movement in the future.
A meeting was also called for
7:30 p.m. tonight in the Old
Union courtyard to plan further
action. Members of the Movement
were urged to "bring everything
you'll need to the meeting," one
radical who did not want his name
used said.
"We will be out Thursday night
and every night until ROTC is
offed," he added.

police officials reported that 30
deputies were injured by thrown
objects. The Stanford Hospital
reported one demonstrator and 6
police treated, all for minor
lacerations.
About 800 protestors roamed
the campus from the Old Union

to Encina and ROTC to the
Business School and back to the
Old Union in the course of the
evening.
As the demonstrations
intensified late last night,
deputies, numbering 274 at one time,
used tear gas in at least two
instances to disperse large groups
of militant protestors.
Intense Fighting
The most intense fighting broke
out between demonstrators and
police forces on White Plaza
shortly before 10:45 p.m., after
the police forced the
demonstrators out of the Old
Union courtyard following an
intense rock barrage aimed at
police in front of the Old Union.
Several hundred demonstrators
were still fighting with police after
1 a.m.
Wearing riot equipment, the
deputies charged repeatedly
through the mass of people on
White Plaza in what proved to be
a futile attempt to split the crowd
into smaller groups. The
demonstrators reformed after
every pincer movement.
