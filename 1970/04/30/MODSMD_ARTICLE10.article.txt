# Dear Mom
## Sit-in Confusion 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom,
I am confused by the sit-in.
What are the issues and how do
you define political positions?
Everyone I know is a "moderate."
What does that mean?
Confused
Dea- Confused,
You've seen the ads, "You may
be a Unitarian and not realize
it . . Well, EVERYONE is a
moderate. A John Bircher is a
"moderate" because he disagreed
with Norman Rockwell.
Rock-throwing affinity groups are
moderately radical because they
don't believe in killing mother.
("Honor thy mother and
what's-h is-name. ") Having
established that everyone is a
moderate, deiinitions become
more ambiguous. For example, a
"wild-eyed lunatic fringe"
moderate is someone who doesn't
agree with my position, regardless
of what it is.
Question: Why so many young
people at the sit-in?
Answer: Mainly because the
newspapers publish your age if
you're arrested. This takes a heavy
toll of middle-aged women from
the fray.
Question: Who are the people
who claim to "lay their bodies on
the line" for the cause?
Answer: They're the masked
heroes who run around in the
dark throwing rocks.
Question: What building will
they take next?

Answer: It's a toss-up between
the Ladies' Latrine, which
provides a hospitable milieu for
the language used, and the
Women's Gym in which the Dance
Room features full-length mirror
so you can look at yourself while
speaking over the microphones.
(In the New Utopia after the
Revolution, EVERYONE will
have his own microphone thus
ending the squabbling for tho
mike we've witnessed here.)
Question: Why do th t
dissidents listen to Bruce Franklin
and cheer him?
Answer: Because he's
FACULTY and therefore a higher
order of being to the rads. "A
faculty member on our side is
worth ten students."
Question: Why are student
leaders walking around with
transistor radios?
Answer: Theoretically, they're
tuned to police channels.
Actually, of course, they're tuned
to Berkeley lest they get the drop
on us in window-breaking or
arrests. (This is one Berkeley-Ca>'
contest in which everyone gets the
axe!)

of what it is.
Question: Why so many young
people at the sit-in?
Answer: Mainly because the
newspapers publish your age if
you're arrested. This takes a heavy
toll of middle-aged women from
the fray.
Question: Who are the people
who claim to "lay their bodies on
the line" for the cause?
Answer: They're the masked
heroes who run around in the
dark throwing rocks.
Question: What building will
they take next?

Answer: It's a toss-up between
the Ladies' Latrine, which
provides a hospitable milieu for
the language used, and the
Women's Gym in which the Dance
Room features full-length mirror
so you can look at yourself while
speaking over the microphones.
(In the New Utopia after the
Revolution, EVERYONE will
have his own microphone thus
ending the squabbling for tho
mike we've witnessed here.)
Question: Why do th t
dissidents listen to Bruce Franklin
and cheer him?
Answer: Because he's
FACULTY and therefore a higher
order of being to the rads. "A
faculty member on our side is
worth ten students."
Question: Why are student
leaders walking around with
transistor radios?
Answer: Theoretically, they're
tuned to police channels.
Actually, of course, they're tuned
to Berkeley lest they get the drop
on us in window-breaking or
arrests. (This is one Berkeley-Ca>'
contest in which everyone gets the
axe!)

Sit-in Humor:
What did the radical say to the
hockey player? ... "I like your
goal but not your tactics."
Dear Mom,
I am confused by the sit-in.
What are the issues and how do
you define political positions?
Everyone I know is a "moderate."
What does that mean?
Confused
Dea- Confused,
You've seen the ads, "You may
be a Unitarian and not realize
it . . Well, EVERYONE is a
moderate. A John Bircher is a
"moderate" because he disagreed
with Norman Rockwell.
Rock-throwing affinity groups are
moderately radical because they
don't believe in killing mother.
("Honor thy mother and
what's-h is-name. ") Having
established that everyone is a
moderate, deiinitions become
more ambiguous. For example, a
"wild-eyed lunatic fringe"
moderate is someone who doesn't
agree with my position, regardless
of what it is.
