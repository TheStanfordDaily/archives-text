Cambodia Protesi
The President The White House
Dear Mr. President:
It has become increasingly
clear that our great universities
have become stages for display of
deeply rooted national discontent.
Our youth, educated in the great
American ideals of freedom,
openness, tolerance, and respect
for individual life, struggle to see
these ideals in national practice.
The frustrations of a brutal and
ambiguous war feed distrust of
our governance, our economics,
our education, and even our rights
and responsibilities.
The strength of the anti-ROTC,
anti-research, anti-technology
movements on our campuses is
evidence of this growing national
distrust. University communities
are becoming deeply split between
those who have begun to lose
faith in the American system and
those who cherish its success in
brighter times. University

administrations struggle to find a
middle ground on which their
institutions can survive. Students
press hard for university reform,
hoping somehow to affect the
war. Faculties normally receptive
to reform often hesitate to act in
this emotional atmosphere.
The extreme leftists openly
advocate violence on our
campuses. They know full well
that escalated violent protest will
bring escalated violent response.
They use this to create an
atmosphere of tension and thus
polarize the community.
Frustrated by their inability to
influence what they regard as a
disastrous national policy,
moderates are supporting the
protests in increasing numbers,
and are beginning to tolerate their
violence. Other moderates,
angered by the violence of recent
demonstrations, are becoming
more violent in their reactions.
The middle ground is being
evacuated, and armed camps are
beginning to take ominous form
on either side.
Deprived of a moderate base,
our universities will be unable to
serve as bastions for rational
discouse. Revolutionary elements
have long recognized that
destruction of our universities is
essential to their plans for
national conquest, and events now
play into their hands.
We recognize the impending
disaster of this situation. It is now
essential that you see the peril
before us. It is essential because
there are suggestions that you
soon may order a deeper
involvement in Cambodia. We
sincerely believe that this act
could be decisive in turning great
numbers of minds away from
moderate positions. The resulting
division of our university
communities would be

irreparable. Violent protest and
violent response could then
escalate beyond the wildest hopes
of the militant revolutionaries,
very likely beyond control. Our
university system could be
shattered, and this we believe
would signal some tragic form of
national collapse.
We ask you to consider these
grave and real concerns in
reaching your decision. No
foreseeable rationalization would
make intervention in Cambodia
acceptable to the people of this
community. Don't permit
inevitable chaos in Asia to bring
about preventable civil conflict in
America

Exploitation ?
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday's Daily a business
student criticized the
"exploitation of innocent
players" young children who
participated in Grass Roots' Earth
Day exhibit, "Resource
Monopoly." As one of those who
orginated the game, I would like
to apologize. The game was
intended for students and other
mature adults— people much closer
to playing the game for real, like
Mr. Van Kuran. We decided, it
would have been very difficult

however, to refuse eager young
kids.
What was scary about OUR
"exploitation" of kids was how
seriously they took the game. It
made me think about all the
games American kids play just as
seriously. In "Monopoly," they
learn to be moneygrubbers. In
"Yankee Trader," they learn how
to conquer the World. Let me
suggest that Mr. Van Kuran
address himselves to the
"exploitation" of millions of
American children by the games
they play every day but Earth
Day.
Leonard Siegei
Under Siege
Editor, The Daily:
It is April 23, 1970. I am inside
a building under seige. I am
amazed and I am angry. I have
been warned to keep away from
glass areas, in case rocks are
thrown. I see human beings with
masks covering their faces milling
about outside the windows. Work
has stopped. We have been
ordered to lock our doors and the
vault.
I have been outside. I saw
Harvey Hukari and friends being
hooted as they walked away.
Apparently they had tried to
protect the building from seige I
overheard the remark: "What a
successful sit-in!" Indeed. Let me
describe the successful sit-in.
The registration office was
carpeted with a mongrel array of
people, dogs, and trash. One
corridor was filled with U.S.E.
people debating about whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to issue a statement to
Stanford employees, telling them
that the sit-in was not meant to
disrupt their comings and goings!
And debating further how the
statement is to be worded. That,
indeed, would pose a problem.
I saw two young men trying in
vain to scale the north side of the
Old Union apparently trying to
reach an open window on the
third floor. I saw a dog swimming
in the fountain, and people
laughing, loitering, and advising
each other in earnest tones about
The Injunction. While attempting
to clean up the trash in the Reg.
hall, I came across the Palo High
rag entitled, "Power to the
Students."
They do not understand that a
student who is indulging in the
activity which the name implies
holds in his hands the greatest
power possible to a human being.
But I have heard it said that
thinking-REASONING- does not
get results. I am back in the
office, and find work still
stopped. I wonder if those sitting
in understand that every moment
they remain in this building we
are unable to issue scholarships,
fellowships, and loans to students
who, without funds, are unable to
continue their education.
What a successful sit-in!
I have listened to and talked
with some students participating
and find a whole gamut of
opinions, motivations, and lame
justifications represented at this
sit-in. Their more presence here,
however, establishes one premise
in common; which is emerging as
the forgotten and repudiated
premise in this whole mess: every
person occupying this building for
the purposes of "offering " ROTC
is willing to either disregard or
deliberately violate private
property rights.

Boycott Protest
Editor, The Daily:
I refused to endorse the
Boycott or to sign the "More
Faculty Protest" letter (DAILY,
April 27) for reasons that I wan
to share with some of my
colleagues. Like many of them, I
am against ROTC and want it
"off," as I am against Vietnam,
pollution, and a dozen other ills
of this sick society. On these
issues I am part of a broad
company. But what is appearing
on this campus is a dangerous split
over what reasonable men can
agree is permissible action.
As a result of this split, we are
faced with nothing less than the
critical problem of keeping this
University together —as a universe
of discourse, and even as a
working physical plant. It seems
to me desperately important that
we bend every effort to seek our
COMMUNITY again, evoking that
good will that makes rational
discourse possible and try to finr*
again—even under the pressures 01
these times—that there is more
holding us together than
separating us.
God knows, that won't be
easy. On Thursday in the Old
Union Courtyard an old friend of
mine (an Engineer) opened up c....
the English Department and the
dangers of teaching literature with
a degree of rage I found
unbelievable. We were teaching
despair, he claimed, not hope, and
for that we must share heavy
blame for the recent disorders. Is
the meaning of a liberal educatio/i
really THAT obscure on this
campus? Has all that contempt
been under the surface all along,
only now to come out? The need
to talk such things out, to
communicate, seems to me
desperate. As Blake (that propho*
of despair?) has it:
I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath
did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did
grow.
And it seems to me that one
place we might begin is to cease
making everybody in the
administration, just because they
are administration, scapegoats. I
think we should read with respect
Robert Rozensweig's piece in
Monday's Daily, for example,
don't agree with all of it, but
surely anyone who has not utterly
despaired of democracy has got to
grant him some major points. I
think, too, that liberals and
radicals should stop making the
provost and president scapegoats
for all their frustrations. I don I
like the way some things were
handled in the sit-in bust, but I
also happen to think that the
provost acted honorably.
Whatever our disagreements, I
think we will look a long way for
a man of Lyman's strength an J
integrity who also possesses his
compassionate historical sense of
the issues that are bugging the
"sit-iners." I would like to hear
some of my colleagues mention
these things once in a while —as I
would like to hear the radical
students deplore the fire at U„<;
behavioral sciences center.
Finally, I hope we have heard
the last of statements like that of
Professor Robert J. Moffat (Daily,
April 2H). Words like that only
polarize things more. One Spiro
Agnrw in this world is enough
and Stanford at the moment is
not in short supply of moral
desperadoes but of reasonable
men who will talk to each other.

movements on our campuses is
evidence of this growing national
distrust. University communities
are becoming deeply split between
those who have begun to lose
faith in the American system and
those who cherish its success in
brighter times. University

administrations struggle to find a
middle ground on which their
institutions can survive. Students
press hard for university reform,
hoping somehow to affect the
war. Faculties normally receptive
to reform often hesitate to act in
this emotional atmosphere.
The extreme leftists openly
advocate violence on our
campuses. They know full well
that escalated violent protest will
bring escalated violent response.
They use this to create an
atmosphere of tension and thus
polarize the community.
Frustrated by their inability to
influence what they regard as a
disastrous national policy,
moderates are supporting the
protests in increasing numbers,
and are beginning to tolerate their
violence. Other moderates,
angered by the violence of recent
demonstrations, are becoming
more violent in their reactions.
The middle ground is being
evacuated, and armed camps are
beginning to take ominous form
on either side.
Deprived of a moderate base,
our universities will be unable to
serve as bastions for rational
discouse. Revolutionary elements
have long recognized that
destruction of our universities is
essential to their plans for
national conquest, and events now
play into their hands.
We recognize the impending
disaster of this situation. It is now
essential that you see the peril
before us. It is essential because
there are suggestions that you
soon may order a deeper
involvement in Cambodia. We
sincerely believe that this act
could be decisive in turning great
numbers of minds away from
moderate positions. The resulting
division of our university
communities would be

irreparable. Violent protest and
violent response could then
escalate beyond the wildest hopes
of the militant revolutionaries,
very likely beyond control. Our
university system could be
shattered, and this we believe
would signal some tragic form of
national collapse.
We ask you to consider these
grave and real concerns in
reaching your decision. No
foreseeable rationalization would
make intervention in Cambodia
acceptable to the people of this
community. Don't permit
inevitable chaos in Asia to bring
about preventable civil conflict in
America

Exploitation ?
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday's Daily a business
student criticized the
"exploitation of innocent
players" young children who
participated in Grass Roots' Earth
Day exhibit, "Resource
Monopoly." As one of those who
orginated the game, I would like
to apologize. The game was
intended for students and other
mature adults— people much closer
to playing the game for real, like
Mr. Van Kuran. We decided, it
would have been very difficult

however, to refuse eager young
kids.
What was scary about OUR
"exploitation" of kids was how
seriously they took the game. It
made me think about all the
games American kids play just as
seriously. In "Monopoly," they
learn to be moneygrubbers. In
"Yankee Trader," they learn how
to conquer the World. Let me
suggest that Mr. Van Kuran
address himselves to the
"exploitation" of millions of
American children by the games
they play every day but Earth
Day.

Under Siege
Editor, The Daily:
It is April 23, 1970. I am inside
a building under seige. I am
amazed and I am angry. I have
been warned to keep away from
glass areas, in case rocks are
thrown. I see human beings with
masks covering their faces milling
about outside the windows. Work
has stopped. We have been
ordered to lock our doors and the
vault.
I have been outside. I saw
Harvey Hukari and friends being
hooted as they walked away.
Apparently they had tried to
protect the building from seige I
overheard the remark: "What a
successful sit-in!" Indeed. Let me
describe the successful sit-in.
The registration office was
carpeted with a mongrel array of
people, dogs, and trash. One
corridor was filled with U.S.E.
people debating about whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to issue a statement to
Stanford employees, telling them
that the sit-in was not meant to
disrupt their comings and goings!
And debating further how the
statement is to be worded. That,
indeed, would pose a problem.
I saw two young men trying in
vain to scale the north side of the
Old Union apparently trying to
reach an open window on the
third floor. I saw a dog swimming
in the fountain, and people
laughing, loitering, and advising
each other in earnest tones about
The Injunction. While attempting
to clean up the trash in the Reg.
hall, I came across the Palo High
rag entitled, "Power to the
Students."
They do not understand that a
student who is indulging in the
activity which the name implies
holds in his hands the greatest
power possible to a human being.
But I have heard it said that
thinking-REASONING- does not
get results. I am back in the
office, and find work still
stopped. I wonder if those sitting
in understand that every moment
they remain in this building we
are unable to issue scholarships,
fellowships, and loans to students
who, without funds, are unable to
continue their education.
What a successful sit-in!
I have listened to and talked
with some students participating
and find a whole gamut of
opinions, motivations, and lame
justifications represented at this
sit-in. Their more presence here,
however, establishes one premise
in common; which is emerging as
the forgotten and repudiated
premise in this whole mess: every
person occupying this building for
the purposes of "offering " ROTC
is willing to either disregard or
deliberately violate private
property rights.

Boycott Protest
Editor, The Daily:
I refused to endorse the
Boycott or to sign the "More
Faculty Protest" letter (DAILY,
April 27) for reasons that I wan
to share with some of my
colleagues. Like many of them, I
am against ROTC and want it
"off," as I am against Vietnam,
pollution, and a dozen other ills
of this sick society. On these
issues I am part of a broad
company. But what is appearing
on this campus is a dangerous split
over what reasonable men can
agree is permissible action.
As a result of this split, we are
faced with nothing less than the
critical problem of keeping this
University together —as a universe
of discourse, and even as a
working physical plant. It seems
to me desperately important that
we bend every effort to seek our
COMMUNITY again, evoking that
good will that makes rational
discourse possible and try to finr*
again—even under the pressures 01
these times—that there is more
holding us together than
separating us.
God knows, that won't be
easy. On Thursday in the Old
Union Courtyard an old friend of
mine (an Engineer) opened up c....
the English Department and the
dangers of teaching literature with
a degree of rage I found
unbelievable. We were teaching
despair, he claimed, not hope, and
for that we must share heavy
blame for the recent disorders. Is
the meaning of a liberal educatio/i
really THAT obscure on this
campus? Has all that contempt
been under the surface all along,
only now to come out? The need
to talk such things out, to
communicate, seems to me
desperate. As Blake (that propho*
of despair?) has it:
I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath
did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did
grow.
And it seems to me that one
place we might begin is to cease
making everybody in the
administration, just because they
are administration, scapegoats. I
think we should read with respect
Robert Rozensweig's piece in
Monday's Daily, for example,
don't agree with all of it, but
surely anyone who has not utterly
despaired of democracy has got to
grant him some major points. I
think, too, that liberals and
radicals should stop making the
provost and president scapegoats
for all their frustrations. I don I
like the way some things were
handled in the sit-in bust, but I
also happen to think that the
provost acted honorably.
Whatever our disagreements, I
think we will look a long way for
a man of Lyman's strength an J
integrity who also possesses his
compassionate historical sense of
the issues that are bugging the
"sit-iners." I would like to hear
some of my colleagues mention
these things once in a while —as I
would like to hear the radical
students deplore the fire at U„<;
behavioral sciences center.
Finally, I hope we have heard
the last of statements like that of
Professor Robert J. Moffat (Daily,
April 2H). Words like that only
polarize things more. One Spiro
Agnrw in this world is enough
and Stanford at the moment is
not in short supply of moral
desperadoes but of reasonable
men who will talk to each other.

Dear Mr. President:
It has become increasingly
clear that our great universities
have become stages for display of
deeply rooted national discontent.
Our youth, educated in the great
American ideals of freedom,
openness, tolerance, and respect
for individual life, struggle to see
these ideals in national practice.
The frustrations of a brutal and
ambiguous war feed distrust of
our governance, our economics,
our education, and even our rights
and responsibilities.

anti-research, anti-technology

that escalated violent protest will
bring escalated violent response.
They use this to create an
atmosphere of tension and thus
polarize the community.
Frustrated by their inability to
influence what they regard as a
disastrous national policy,
moderates are supporting the
protests in increasing numbers,
and are beginning to tolerate their
violence. Other moderates,
angered by the violence of recent
demonstrations, are becoming
more violent in their reactions.
The middle ground is being
evacuated, and armed camps are
beginning to take ominous form
on either side.
Deprived of a moderate base,
our universities will be unable to
serve as bastions for rational
discouse. Revolutionary elements
have long recognized that
destruction of our universities is
essential to their plans for
national conquest, and events now
play into their hands.
We recognize the impending
disaster of this situation. It is now
essential that you see the peril
before us. It is essential because
there are suggestions that you
soon may order a deeper
involvement in Cambodia. We
sincerely believe that this act
could be decisive in turning great
numbers of minds away from
moderate positions. The resulting
division of our university
communities would be

irreparable. Violent protest and
violent response could then
escalate beyond the wildest hopes
of the militant revolutionaries,
very likely beyond control. Our
university system could be
shattered, and this we believe
would signal some tragic form of
national collapse.
We ask you to consider these
grave and real concerns in
reaching your decision. No
foreseeable rationalization would
make intervention in Cambodia
acceptable to the people of this
community. Don't permit
inevitable chaos in Asia to bring
about preventable civil conflict in
America

Exploitation ?
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday's Daily a business
student criticized the
"exploitation of innocent
players" young children who
participated in Grass Roots' Earth
Day exhibit, "Resource
Monopoly." As one of those who
orginated the game, I would like
to apologize. The game was
intended for students and other
mature adults— people much closer
to playing the game for real, like
Mr. Van Kuran. We decided, it
would have been very difficult

however, to refuse eager young
kids.
What was scary about OUR
"exploitation" of kids was how
seriously they took the game. It
made me think about all the
games American kids play just as
seriously. In "Monopoly," they
learn to be moneygrubbers. In
"Yankee Trader," they learn how
to conquer the World. Let me
suggest that Mr. Van Kuran
address himselves to the
"exploitation" of millions of
American children by the games
they play every day but Earth
Day.

Under Siege
Editor, The Daily:
It is April 23, 1970. I am inside
a building under seige. I am
amazed and I am angry. I have
been warned to keep away from
glass areas, in case rocks are
thrown. I see human beings with
masks covering their faces milling
about outside the windows. Work
has stopped. We have been
ordered to lock our doors and the
vault.
I have been outside. I saw
Harvey Hukari and friends being
hooted as they walked away.
Apparently they had tried to
protect the building from seige I
overheard the remark: "What a
successful sit-in!" Indeed. Let me
describe the successful sit-in.
The registration office was
carpeted with a mongrel array of
people, dogs, and trash. One
corridor was filled with U.S.E.
people debating about whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to issue a statement to
Stanford employees, telling them
that the sit-in was not meant to
disrupt their comings and goings!
And debating further how the
statement is to be worded. That,
indeed, would pose a problem.
I saw two young men trying in
vain to scale the north side of the
Old Union apparently trying to
reach an open window on the
third floor. I saw a dog swimming
in the fountain, and people
laughing, loitering, and advising
each other in earnest tones about
The Injunction. While attempting
to clean up the trash in the Reg.
hall, I came across the Palo High
rag entitled, "Power to the
Students."
They do not understand that a
student who is indulging in the
activity which the name implies
holds in his hands the greatest
power possible to a human being.
But I have heard it said that
thinking-REASONING- does not
get results. I am back in the
office, and find work still
stopped. I wonder if those sitting
in understand that every moment
they remain in this building we
are unable to issue scholarships,
fellowships, and loans to students
who, without funds, are unable to
continue their education.
What a successful sit-in!
I have listened to and talked
with some students participating
and find a whole gamut of
opinions, motivations, and lame
justifications represented at this
sit-in. Their more presence here,
however, establishes one premise
in common; which is emerging as
the forgotten and repudiated
premise in this whole mess: every
person occupying this building for
the purposes of "offering " ROTC
is willing to either disregard or
deliberately violate private
property rights.

Boycott Protest
Editor, The Daily:
I refused to endorse the
Boycott or to sign the "More
Faculty Protest" letter (DAILY,
April 27) for reasons that I wan
to share with some of my
colleagues. Like many of them, I
am against ROTC and want it
"off," as I am against Vietnam,
pollution, and a dozen other ills
of this sick society. On these
issues I am part of a broad
company. But what is appearing
on this campus is a dangerous split
over what reasonable men can
agree is permissible action.
As a result of this split, we are
faced with nothing less than the
critical problem of keeping this
University together —as a universe
of discourse, and even as a
working physical plant. It seems
to me desperately important that
we bend every effort to seek our
COMMUNITY again, evoking that
good will that makes rational
discourse possible and try to finr*
again—even under the pressures 01
these times—that there is more
holding us together than
separating us.
God knows, that won't be
easy. On Thursday in the Old
Union Courtyard an old friend of
mine (an Engineer) opened up c....
the English Department and the
dangers of teaching literature with
a degree of rage I found
unbelievable. We were teaching
despair, he claimed, not hope, and
for that we must share heavy
blame for the recent disorders. Is
the meaning of a liberal educatio/i
really THAT obscure on this
campus? Has all that contempt
been under the surface all along,
only now to come out? The need
to talk such things out, to
communicate, seems to me
desperate. As Blake (that propho*
of despair?) has it:
I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath
did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did
grow.
And it seems to me that one
place we might begin is to cease
making everybody in the
administration, just because they
are administration, scapegoats. I
think we should read with respect
Robert Rozensweig's piece in
Monday's Daily, for example,
don't agree with all of it, but
surely anyone who has not utterly
despaired of democracy has got to
grant him some major points. I
think, too, that liberals and
radicals should stop making the
provost and president scapegoats
for all their frustrations. I don I
like the way some things were
handled in the sit-in bust, but I
also happen to think that the
provost acted honorably.
Whatever our disagreements, I
think we will look a long way for
a man of Lyman's strength an J
integrity who also possesses his
compassionate historical sense of
the issues that are bugging the
"sit-iners." I would like to hear
some of my colleagues mention
these things once in a while —as I
would like to hear the radical
students deplore the fire at U„<;
behavioral sciences center.
Finally, I hope we have heard
the last of statements like that of
Professor Robert J. Moffat (Daily,
April 2H). Words like that only
polarize things more. One Spiro
Agnrw in this world is enough
and Stanford at the moment is
not in short supply of moral
desperadoes but of reasonable
men who will talk to each other.

The President The White House
Dear Mr. President:
It has become increasingly
clear that our great universities
have become stages for display of
deeply rooted national discontent.
Our youth, educated in the great
American ideals of freedom,
openness, tolerance, and respect
for individual life, struggle to see
these ideals in national practice.
The frustrations of a brutal and
ambiguous war feed distrust of
our governance, our economics,
our education, and even our rights
and responsibilities.
The strength of the anti-ROTC,
anti-research, anti-technology
movements on our campuses is
evidence of this growing national
distrust. University communities
are becoming deeply split between
those who have begun to lose
faith in the American system and
those who cherish its success in
brighter times. University

administrations struggle to find a
middle ground on which their
institutions can survive. Students
press hard for university reform,
hoping somehow to affect the
war. Faculties normally receptive
to reform often hesitate to act in
this emotional atmosphere.
The extreme leftists openly
advocate violence on our
campuses. They know full well
that escalated violent protest will
bring escalated violent response.
They use this to create an
atmosphere of tension and thus
polarize the community.
Frustrated by their inability to
influence what they regard as a

our universities will be unable to
serve as bastions for rational
discouse. Revolutionary elements
have long recognized that
destruction of our universities is
essential to their plans for
national conquest, and events now
play into their hands.
We recognize the impending
disaster of this situation. It is now
essential that you see the peril
before us. It is essential because
there are suggestions that you
soon may order a deeper
involvement in Cambodia. We
sincerely believe that this act
could be decisive in turning great
numbers of minds away from
moderate positions. The resulting
division of our university
communities would be

irreparable. Violent protest and
violent response could then
escalate beyond the wildest hopes
of the militant revolutionaries,
very likely beyond control. Our
university system could be
shattered, and this we believe
would signal some tragic form of
national collapse.
We ask you to consider these
grave and real concerns in
reaching your decision. No
foreseeable rationalization would
make intervention in Cambodia
acceptable to the people of this
community. Don't permit
inevitable chaos in Asia to bring
about preventable civil conflict in
America

Exploitation ?
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday's Daily a business
student criticized the
"exploitation of innocent
players" young children who
participated in Grass Roots' Earth
Day exhibit, "Resource
Monopoly." As one of those who
orginated the game, I would like
to apologize. The game was
intended for students and other
mature adults— people much closer
to playing the game for real, like
Mr. Van Kuran. We decided, it
would have been very difficult

however, to refuse eager young
kids.
What was scary about OUR
"exploitation" of kids was how
seriously they took the game. It
made me think about all the
games American kids play just as
seriously. In "Monopoly," they
learn to be moneygrubbers. In
"Yankee Trader," they learn how
to conquer the World. Let me
suggest that Mr. Van Kuran
address himselves to the
"exploitation" of millions of
American children by the games
they play every day but Earth
Day.

Under Siege
Editor, The Daily:
It is April 23, 1970. I am inside
a building under seige. I am
amazed and I am angry. I have
been warned to keep away from
glass areas, in case rocks are
thrown. I see human beings with
masks covering their faces milling
about outside the windows. Work
has stopped. We have been
ordered to lock our doors and the
vault.
I have been outside. I saw
Harvey Hukari and friends being
hooted as they walked away.
Apparently they had tried to
protect the building from seige I
overheard the remark: "What a
successful sit-in!" Indeed. Let me
describe the successful sit-in.
The registration office was
carpeted with a mongrel array of
people, dogs, and trash. One
corridor was filled with U.S.E.
people debating about whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to issue a statement to
Stanford employees, telling them
that the sit-in was not meant to
disrupt their comings and goings!
And debating further how the
statement is to be worded. That,
indeed, would pose a problem.
I saw two young men trying in
vain to scale the north side of the
Old Union apparently trying to
reach an open window on the
third floor. I saw a dog swimming
in the fountain, and people
laughing, loitering, and advising
each other in earnest tones about
The Injunction. While attempting
to clean up the trash in the Reg.
hall, I came across the Palo High
rag entitled, "Power to the
Students."
They do not understand that a
student who is indulging in the
activity which the name implies
holds in his hands the greatest
power possible to a human being.
But I have heard it said that
thinking-REASONING- does not
get results. I am back in the
office, and find work still
stopped. I wonder if those sitting
in understand that every moment
they remain in this building we
are unable to issue scholarships,
fellowships, and loans to students
who, without funds, are unable to
continue their education.
What a successful sit-in!
I have listened to and talked
with some students participating
and find a whole gamut of
opinions, motivations, and lame
justifications represented at this
sit-in. Their more presence here,
however, establishes one premise
in common; which is emerging as
the forgotten and repudiated
premise in this whole mess: every
person occupying this building for
the purposes of "offering " ROTC
is willing to either disregard or
deliberately violate private
property rights.

Boycott Protest
Editor, The Daily:
I refused to endorse the
Boycott or to sign the "More
Faculty Protest" letter (DAILY,
April 27) for reasons that I wan
to share with some of my
colleagues. Like many of them, I
am against ROTC and want it
"off," as I am against Vietnam,
pollution, and a dozen other ills
of this sick society. On these
issues I am part of a broad
company. But what is appearing
on this campus is a dangerous split
over what reasonable men can
agree is permissible action.
As a result of this split, we are
faced with nothing less than the
critical problem of keeping this
University together —as a universe
of discourse, and even as a
working physical plant. It seems
to me desperately important that
we bend every effort to seek our
COMMUNITY again, evoking that
good will that makes rational
discourse possible and try to finr*
again—even under the pressures 01
these times—that there is more
holding us together than
separating us.
God knows, that won't be
easy. On Thursday in the Old
Union Courtyard an old friend of
mine (an Engineer) opened up c....
the English Department and the
dangers of teaching literature with
a degree of rage I found
unbelievable. We were teaching
despair, he claimed, not hope, and
for that we must share heavy
blame for the recent disorders. Is
the meaning of a liberal educatio/i
really THAT obscure on this
campus? Has all that contempt
been under the surface all along,
only now to come out? The need
to talk such things out, to
communicate, seems to me
desperate. As Blake (that propho*
of despair?) has it:
I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath
did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did
grow.
And it seems to me that one
place we might begin is to cease
making everybody in the
administration, just because they
are administration, scapegoats. I
think we should read with respect
Robert Rozensweig's piece in
Monday's Daily, for example,
don't agree with all of it, but
surely anyone who has not utterly
despaired of democracy has got to
grant him some major points. I
think, too, that liberals and
radicals should stop making the
provost and president scapegoats
for all their frustrations. I don I
like the way some things were
handled in the sit-in bust, but I
also happen to think that the
provost acted honorably.
Whatever our disagreements, I
think we will look a long way for
a man of Lyman's strength an J
integrity who also possesses his
compassionate historical sense of
the issues that are bugging the
"sit-iners." I would like to hear
some of my colleagues mention
these things once in a while —as I
would like to hear the radical
students deplore the fire at U„<;
behavioral sciences center.
Finally, I hope we have heard
the last of statements like that of
Professor Robert J. Moffat (Daily,
April 2H). Words like that only
polarize things more. One Spiro
Agnrw in this world is enough
and Stanford at the moment is
not in short supply of moral
desperadoes but of reasonable
men who will talk to each other.

The President The White House
Dear Mr. President:
It has become increasingly
clear that our great universities
have become stages for display of
deeply rooted national discontent.
Our youth, educated in the great
American ideals of freedom,
openness, tolerance, and respect
for individual life, struggle to see
these ideals in national practice.
The frustrations of a brutal and
ambiguous war feed distrust of
our governance, our economics,
our education, and even our rights
and responsibilities.
The strength of the anti-ROTC,
anti-research, anti-technology
movements on our campuses is
evidence of this growing national
distrust. University communities
are becoming deeply split between
those who have begun to lose
faith in the American system and
those who cherish its success in
brighter times. University

administrations struggle to find a
middle ground on which their
institutions can survive. Students
press hard for university reform,
hoping somehow to affect the
war. Faculties normally receptive
to reform often hesitate to act in
this emotional atmosphere.
The extreme leftists openly
advocate violence on our
campuses. They know full well
that escalated violent protest will
bring escalated violent response.
They use this to create an
atmosphere of tension and thus
polarize the community.
Frustrated by their inability to
influence what they regard as a
disastrous national policy,
moderates are supporting the
protests in increasing numbers,
and are beginning to tolerate their
violence. Other moderates,
angered by the violence of recent
demonstrations, are becoming
more violent in their reactions.
The middle ground is being
evacuated, and armed camps are
beginning to take ominous form
on either side.
Deprived of a moderate base,
our universities will be unable to
serve as bastions for rational
discouse. Revolutionary elements
have long recognized that
destruction of our universities is
essential to their plans for
national conquest, and events now
play into their hands.

division of our university
communities would be

irreparable. Violent protest and
violent response could then
escalate beyond the wildest hopes
of the militant revolutionaries,
very likely beyond control. Our
university system could be
shattered, and this we believe
would signal some tragic form of
national collapse.
We ask you to consider these
grave and real concerns in
reaching your decision. No
foreseeable rationalization would
make intervention in Cambodia
acceptable to the people of this
community. Don't permit
inevitable chaos in Asia to bring
about preventable civil conflict in
America

Exploitation ?
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday's Daily a business
student criticized the
"exploitation of innocent
players" young children who
participated in Grass Roots' Earth
Day exhibit, "Resource
Monopoly." As one of those who
orginated the game, I would like
to apologize. The game was
intended for students and other
mature adults— people much closer
to playing the game for real, like
Mr. Van Kuran. We decided, it
would have been very difficult

however, to refuse eager young
kids.
What was scary about OUR
"exploitation" of kids was how
seriously they took the game. It
made me think about all the
games American kids play just as
seriously. In "Monopoly," they
learn to be moneygrubbers. In
"Yankee Trader," they learn how
to conquer the World. Let me
suggest that Mr. Van Kuran
address himselves to the
"exploitation" of millions of
American children by the games
they play every day but Earth
Day.

Under Siege
Editor, The Daily:
It is April 23, 1970. I am inside
a building under seige. I am
amazed and I am angry. I have
been warned to keep away from
glass areas, in case rocks are
thrown. I see human beings with
masks covering their faces milling
about outside the windows. Work
has stopped. We have been
ordered to lock our doors and the
vault.
I have been outside. I saw
Harvey Hukari and friends being
hooted as they walked away.
Apparently they had tried to
protect the building from seige I
overheard the remark: "What a
successful sit-in!" Indeed. Let me
describe the successful sit-in.
The registration office was
carpeted with a mongrel array of
people, dogs, and trash. One
corridor was filled with U.S.E.
people debating about whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to pass a proposal to discuss
at the next meeting whether or
not to issue a statement to
Stanford employees, telling them
that the sit-in was not meant to
disrupt their comings and goings!
And debating further how the
statement is to be worded. That,
indeed, would pose a problem.
I saw two young men trying in
vain to scale the north side of the
Old Union apparently trying to
reach an open window on the
third floor. I saw a dog swimming
in the fountain, and people
laughing, loitering, and advising
each other in earnest tones about
The Injunction. While attempting
to clean up the trash in the Reg.
hall, I came across the Palo High
rag entitled, "Power to the
Students."
They do not understand that a
student who is indulging in the
activity which the name implies
holds in his hands the greatest
power possible to a human being.
But I have heard it said that
thinking-REASONING- does not
get results. I am back in the
office, and find work still
stopped. I wonder if those sitting
in understand that every moment
they remain in this building we
are unable to issue scholarships,
fellowships, and loans to students
who, without funds, are unable to
continue their education.
What a successful sit-in!
I have listened to and talked
with some students participating
and find a whole gamut of
opinions, motivations, and lame
justifications represented at this
sit-in. Their more presence here,
however, establishes one premise
in common; which is emerging as
the forgotten and repudiated
premise in this whole mess: every
person occupying this building for
the purposes of "offering " ROTC
is willing to either disregard or
deliberately violate private
property rights.

Boycott Protest
Editor, The Daily:
I refused to endorse the
Boycott or to sign the "More
Faculty Protest" letter (DAILY,
April 27) for reasons that I wan
to share with some of my
colleagues. Like many of them, I
am against ROTC and want it
"off," as I am against Vietnam,
pollution, and a dozen other ills
of this sick society. On these
issues I am part of a broad
company. But what is appearing
on this campus is a dangerous split
over what reasonable men can
agree is permissible action.
As a result of this split, we are
faced with nothing less than the
critical problem of keeping this
University together —as a universe
of discourse, and even as a
working physical plant. It seems
to me desperately important that
we bend every effort to seek our
COMMUNITY again, evoking that
good will that makes rational
discourse possible and try to finr*
again—even under the pressures 01
these times—that there is more
holding us together than
separating us.
God knows, that won't be
easy. On Thursday in the Old
Union Courtyard an old friend of
mine (an Engineer) opened up c....
the English Department and the
dangers of teaching literature with
a degree of rage I found
unbelievable. We were teaching
despair, he claimed, not hope, and
for that we must share heavy
blame for the recent disorders. Is
the meaning of a liberal educatio/i
really THAT obscure on this
campus? Has all that contempt
been under the surface all along,
only now to come out? The need
to talk such things out, to
communicate, seems to me
desperate. As Blake (that propho*
of despair?) has it:
I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath
did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did
grow.
And it seems to me that one
place we might begin is to cease
making everybody in the
administration, just because they
are administration, scapegoats. I
think we should read with respect
Robert Rozensweig's piece in
Monday's Daily, for example,
don't agree with all of it, but
surely anyone who has not utterly
despaired of democracy has got to
grant him some major points. I
think, too, that liberals and
radicals should stop making the
provost and president scapegoats
for all their frustrations. I don I
like the way some things were
handled in the sit-in bust, but I
also happen to think that the
provost acted honorably.
Whatever our disagreements, I
think we will look a long way for
a man of Lyman's strength an J
integrity who also possesses his
compassionate historical sense of
the issues that are bugging the
"sit-iners." I would like to hear
some of my colleagues mention
these things once in a while —as I
would like to hear the radical
students deplore the fire at U„<;
behavioral sciences center.
Finally, I hope we have heard
the last of statements like that of
Professor Robert J. Moffat (Daily,
April 2H). Words like that only
polarize things more. One Spiro
Agnrw in this world is enough
and Stanford at the moment is
not in short supply of moral
desperadoes but of reasonable
men who will talk to each other.

The President The White House
Dear Mr. President:
It has become increasingly
clear that our great universities
have become stages for display of
deeply rooted national discontent.
Our youth, educated in the great
American ideals of freedom,
openness, tolerance, and respect
for individual life, struggle to see
these ideals in national practice.
The frustrations of a brutal and
ambiguous war feed distrust of
our governance, our economics,
our education, and even our rights
and responsibilities.
The strength of the anti-ROTC,
anti-research, anti-technology
movements on our campuses is
evidence of this growing national
distrust. University communities
are becoming deeply split between
those who have begun to lose
faith in the American system and
those who cherish its success in
brighter times. University

administrations struggle to find a
middle ground on which their
institutions can survive. Students
press hard for university reform,
hoping somehow to affect the
war. Faculties normally receptive
to reform often hesitate to act in
this emotional atmosphere.
The extreme leftists openly
advocate violence on our
campuses. They know full well
that escalated violent protest will
bring escalated violent response.
They use this to create an
atmosphere of tension and thus
polarize the community.
Frustrated by their inability to
influence what they regard as a
disastrous national policy,
moderates are supporting the
protests in increasing numbers,
and are beginning to tolerate their
violence. Other moderates,
angered by the violence of recent
demonstrations, are becoming
more violent in their reactions.
The middle ground is being
evacuated, and armed camps are
beginning to take ominous form
on either side.
Deprived of a moderate base,
our universities will be unable to
serve as bastions for rational
discouse. Revolutionary elements
have long recognized that
destruction of our universities is
essential to their plans for
national conquest, and events now
play into their hands.
We recognize the impending
disaster of this situation. It is now
essential that you see the peril
before us. It is essential because
there are suggestions that you
soon may order a deeper
involvement in Cambodia. We
sincerely believe that this act
could be decisive in turning great
numbers of minds away from
moderate positions. The resulting
division of our university
communities would be

irreparable. Violent protest and
violent response could then
escalate beyond the wildest hopes
of the militant revolutionaries,
very likely beyond control. Our
university system could be
shattered, and this we believe
would signal some tragic form of
national collapse.
We ask you to consider these
grave and real concerns in
reaching your decision. No
foreseeable rationalization would
make intervention in Cambodia
acceptable to the people of this
community. Don't permit
inevitable chaos in Asia to bring
about preventable civil conflict in
