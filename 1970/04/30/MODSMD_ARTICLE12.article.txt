## Panthers Play Yale 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTONâ€”"Good afternoon, everybody.
This is Chris Schenkel speaking to you from Yale
University on this beautiful June day. As you
recall, after the tragic events of May when the
students struck the university in sympathy with
the Black Panthers, the authorities agreed to
dispense with normal judicial procedures and hold
the trial of the Panthers in the Yale Bowl with the
students deciding the guilt or innocence of the
Panthers by popular acclaim.
"The idea for the compromise was suggested by
a professor of Roman history, who felt that this
would satisfy both the legal requirements of the
state as well as the complaints by the student body
and faculty that the Panthers could not get a fair
trial.
"At first the Connecticut courts objected to
this type of trial, but when the students said they
would refuse to go back to school unless their
demands were met, the courts had no choice but
to give in. Everyone knows the country cannot run
without Yale.
"And so today I am sitting here in the press
box on the top of Yale Bowl, which is packed with
students and faculty, ready to decide if the Black
Panthers did or did not kill a so-called police
informer.
"If you'll forgive me for saying so, there is a
Roman circus atmosphere here today as well as a
sinse of excitement. The crowd knows that they
are making history, and all I can tell you is that
after this day American jurisprudence will never be
the same. To keep the crowd amused, a few minor
trials have been held already.
"A professor who decided to hold classes
during the student strike was found guilty of
racism and was thrown to a group of hungry lions
which are now tethered at the 40-yard line.
"A judge of the state supreme court who issued
an injunction against holding the trial in the Yale
Bowl was also thrown to the lions.

"And just before I wont on the air the mayor of
New Haven as well as the fire chief were tried as
counter-revolutionaries. All I can tell you, folks, is
that those lions aren't hungry any more.
"Well, we're just about ready for the big trial.
The cheering section across from me is now doing
card tricks. There they go with 'Free Huey
Newton.' Now they're spelling out . . . well, let's
skip that one. . . And here is the final card
stund . . . all I can make out from here is the word
'mother.'
"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! That roar you
just heard from the crowd means.. . Yes, there
they are, coming in at the far corner of the
stadium . . . the Black Panther defendants . . . The
crowd is on its feet waving their BP banners. It is
an unbelievable sight.
"Now they're starting to boo . . . Oh, I see, the
government witnesses are coming out of the other
end of the stadium. The crowd is starting to throw
bottles and cushions at the government
witnesses . . .
"Now there goes Bobby Scale. He's giving the
black power salute . ~. That did it . . . The crowd
is pointing their thumbs up. It's a not guilty
verdict . . . Now the crowd is chanting 'Free them,
free them' .. . The Black Panthers have been
found innocent!
"This is a great day for New Haven, a great day
for the United States and a great day for Yale.
What a magnificent sight . . . Now the students are
pointing their thumbs down . . . I'm not sure what
this means .. . Wait a minute . . They're finding
the government witnesses guilty . . . They want the
witnesses thrown to the lions. . . Yes, there they
go . . . The crowd is on its feet. The witnesses are
being thrown to the lions, and there goes the
prosecutor and the judge . . .
"That about winds up the legal arguments here
al Yale University lor this week."
