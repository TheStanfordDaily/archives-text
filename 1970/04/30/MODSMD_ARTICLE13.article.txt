# Community Power
## Challenge Absolutism 
### Jeff Brooks 
Complicity, enfranchisement,
and power are the issues raised by
the Off-ROTC movement and the
arrest of 23 persons for
trespassing. They are raised at
every challenge to the
cjdministrative absolutism by
which this community is
'overned.
Our complicity in the crimes of
the war and of the American
system seems inherent in our
condition as citizens of this
country. In the particular instance
9 f our complicity in the
participation of this university in
he war, responsibility appears
masked by our disenfranchise
ment. We are not consulted about
how this community is run. We
are not asked how its resources
should be allocated. The decisions
are made without us. Behind our
disinfranchisement therefore is
he real issue of power.
The present power in this
community rests on the fragile
presumption that the land and
buildings of Stanford University
California are the private property
of a group of men called trustees.
They appoint administrators to

manage their property in
accordance with their views.
These administrators consult
and even share power with such
people in t'c- community as
specific sii'.ut ions dictate or as
long term considerations w-gscvi.
Although the transparancy of this
system has long been evident
ther is no authority in the
community with a broad enough
base to permanently challenge it.
There is no reason why it should
not be challenged.
It seems clear that the land and
buildings of Stanford University
are not the private property of
any individuals but are the public
property of the people who live
and work here. All privileges
stemming from the ownership of
this property belong to the
community. The people of this
community can form a body of
representatives to express their
will and oversee their own affairs.
Employees and Students
Those who have until this time
been disinfranchised such as
non-administrative employees and
students have the opportunity to

affirm their rights. Those who
have until now held privileged
power have the opportunity to
surrender it and ,oin with the rest
of us. If :iot then certainly the
maioiity has the power to
eventually establish the legitimacy
ol its representative authority
against all counter claims. The
mere existence of such a body
would give the people of Stanford
a chance to bring together their
various concerns. It could expand
gradually both in numbers and in
actual power while providing a
focus for serious local political
action in the community.
If people are willing to
participate the details of forming
such a body are not a problem. As
a first step people in agreement
could sign a statement to that
effect. When a substantial number
had signed, perhaps 40 or 50
percent of the community, the
choice of representatives could
begin. They could be chosen by
the simple rule of one
representative per one hundred
people. Employees could choose
in their work group (i.e.
secretaries, maintenance workers,
administrators) or as they saw fit;
students in dorms could choose
by dorms, students not in dorms
by departments, students not in
departments as a separate group;
and faculty could choose as
faculty.
Token Basis Objections
Objections are immediately
raised to participation of both
students and employees on any
but a token basis.
Non-administrative employees
have nothing to do with the
academic matter of the university.
Why then include them? First,
like the rest of us they have
legitimate interests in this
community which need to be
expressed. Disenfranchising them
would create the same sort of
imbalance we already have. The
practical side of such imbalance is
decisions made by
non-representative people.
Its moral side is the supposition
that some people do not have to
be considered. Many aspects of
Stanford University are remote
from the experience of the
members of the community. This
includes academic as well as
non-academic people. Remoteness
is a characteristic of the modern
world and not particular to the
operation of this university. Lack
of expertise is not a reason for
disinfranchisement.
On the other hand it is argued
that students are a transient group
without the serious long term
interest in the welfare of the
university which both the trustees
and faculty claim to possess.
Without touching on this claim, it
is well to remember that students
live in this community for four
years, graduate students
somewhat more or less than that,
and that a year is an extreme
residence requirement.
The Transient Faculty
It is not demanded of transient
faculty. More important, students
have a continuing interest in the
community not only as the largest
group and alleged object of the
institution but also as
representatives, at least by proxy,
of the intersts of succeeding
classes of students. With regard to
the parallel objection that to
establish such a body would mean
"student power" it is important
to realize that what is means is
local political power centered in
the community. The absence of
such power has allowed
irresponsible authority to operate
without check.

any individuals but are the public
property of the people who live
and work here. All privileges
stemming from the ownership of
this property belong to the
community. The people of this
community can form a body of
representatives to express their
will and oversee their own affairs.
Employees and Students
Those who have until this time
been disinfranchised such as
non-administrative employees and
students have the opportunity to

affirm their rights. Those who
have until now held privileged
power have the opportunity to
surrender it and ,oin with the rest
of us. If :iot then certainly the
maioiity has the power to
eventually establish the legitimacy
ol its representative authority
against all counter claims. The
mere existence of such a body
would give the people of Stanford
a chance to bring together their
various concerns. It could expand
gradually both in numbers and in
actual power while providing a
focus for serious local political
action in the community.
If people are willing to
participate the details of forming
such a body are not a problem. As
a first step people in agreement
could sign a statement to that
effect. When a substantial number
had signed, perhaps 40 or 50
percent of the community, the
choice of representatives could
begin. They could be chosen by
the simple rule of one
representative per one hundred
people. Employees could choose
in their work group (i.e.
secretaries, maintenance workers,
administrators) or as they saw fit;
students in dorms could choose
by dorms, students not in dorms
by departments, students not in
departments as a separate group;
and faculty could choose as
faculty.
Token Basis Objections
Objections are immediately
raised to participation of both
students and employees on any
but a token basis.
Non-administrative employees
have nothing to do with the
academic matter of the university.
Why then include them? First,
like the rest of us they have
legitimate interests in this
community which need to be
expressed. Disenfranchising them
would create the same sort of
imbalance we already have. The
practical side of such imbalance is
decisions made by
non-representative people.
Its moral side is the supposition
that some people do not have to
be considered. Many aspects of
Stanford University are remote
from the experience of the
members of the community. This
includes academic as well as
non-academic people. Remoteness
is a characteristic of the modern
world and not particular to the
operation of this university. Lack
of expertise is not a reason for
disinfranchisement.
On the other hand it is argued
that students are a transient group
without the serious long term
interest in the welfare of the
university which both the trustees
and faculty claim to possess.
Without touching on this claim, it
is well to remember that students
live in this community for four
years, graduate students
somewhat more or less than that,
and that a year is an extreme
residence requirement.
The Transient Faculty
It is not demanded of transient
faculty. More important, students
have a continuing interest in the
community not only as the largest
group and alleged object of the
institution but also as
representatives, at least by proxy,
of the intersts of succeeding
classes of students. With regard to
the parallel objection that to
establish such a body would mean
"student power" it is important
to realize that what is means is
local political power centered in
the community. The absence of
such power has allowed
irresponsible authority to operate
without check.
(Jeff Brooks is a member of the
Off-ROTC Movement.)
Complicity, enfranchisement,
and power are the issues raised by
the Off-ROTC movement and the
arrest of 23 persons for
trespassing. They are raised at
every challenge to the
cjdministrative absolutism by
which this community is
'overned.
Our complicity in the crimes of
the war and of the American
system seems inherent in our
condition as citizens of this
country. In the particular instance
9 f our complicity in the
participation of this university in
he war, responsibility appears
masked by our disenfranchise
ment. We are not consulted about
how this community is run. We
are not asked how its resources
should be allocated. The decisions
are made without us. Behind our
disinfranchisement therefore is
he real issue of power.
The present power in this
community rests on the fragile
presumption that the land and
buildings of Stanford University
California are the private property
of a group of men called trustees.
They appoint administrators to

manage their property in
accordance with their views.
These administrators consult
and even share power with such
people in t'c- community as
specific sii'.ut ions dictate or as
long term considerations w-gscvi.
Although the transparancy of this
system has long been evident
ther is no authority in the
community with a broad enough
base to permanently challenge it.
There is no reason why it should
not be challenged.

by departments, students not in
departments as a separate group;
and faculty could choose as
faculty.
Token Basis Objections
Objections are immediately
raised to participation of both
students and employees on any
but a token basis.
Non-administrative employees
have nothing to do with the
academic matter of the university.
Why then include them? First,
like the rest of us they have
legitimate interests in this
community which need to be
expressed. Disenfranchising them
would create the same sort of
imbalance we already have. The
practical side of such imbalance is
decisions made by
non-representative people.
Its moral side is the supposition
that some people do not have to
be considered. Many aspects of
Stanford University are remote
from the experience of the
members of the community. This
includes academic as well as
non-academic people. Remoteness
is a characteristic of the modern
world and not particular to the
operation of this university. Lack
of expertise is not a reason for
disinfranchisement.
On the other hand it is argued
that students are a transient group
without the serious long term
interest in the welfare of the
university which both the trustees
and faculty claim to possess.
Without touching on this claim, it
is well to remember that students
live in this community for four
years, graduate students
somewhat more or less than that,
and that a year is an extreme
residence requirement.
The Transient Faculty
It is not demanded of transient
faculty. More important, students
have a continuing interest in the
community not only as the largest
group and alleged object of the
institution but also as
representatives, at least by proxy,
of the intersts of succeeding
classes of students. With regard to
the parallel objection that to
establish such a body would mean
"student power" it is important
to realize that what is means is
local political power centered in
the community. The absence of
such power has allowed
irresponsible authority to operate
without check.

Complicity, enfranchisement,
and power are the issues raised by
the Off-ROTC movement and the
arrest of 23 persons for
trespassing. They are raised at
every challenge to the
cjdministrative absolutism by
which this community is
'overned.
Our complicity in the crimes of
the war and of the American
system seems inherent in our
condition as citizens of this
country. In the particular instance
9 f our complicity in the
participation of this university in
he war, responsibility appears
masked by our disenfranchise
ment. We are not consulted about
how this community is run. We
are not asked how its resources
should be allocated. The decisions
are made without us. Behind our
disinfranchisement therefore is
he real issue of power.
The present power in this
community rests on the fragile
presumption that the land and
buildings of Stanford University
California are the private property
of a group of men called trustees.
They appoint administrators to

manage their property in
accordance with their views.
These administrators consult
and even share power with such
people in t'c- community as
specific sii'.ut ions dictate or as
long term considerations w-gscvi.
Although the transparancy of this
system has long been evident
ther is no authority in the
community with a broad enough
base to permanently challenge it.
There is no reason why it should
not be challenged.
It seems clear that the land and
buildings of Stanford University
are not the private property of
any individuals but are the public
property of the people who live
and work here. All privileges
stemming from the ownership of
this property belong to the
community. The people of this
community can form a body of
representatives to express their
will and oversee their own affairs.
Employees and Students
Those who have until this time
been disinfranchised such as
non-administrative employees and
students have the opportunity to

affirm their rights. Those who
have until now held privileged
power have the opportunity to
surrender it and ,oin with the rest
of us. If :iot then certainly the
maioiity has the power to
eventually establish the legitimacy
ol its representative authority
against all counter claims. The
mere existence of such a body
would give the people of Stanford
a chance to bring together their
various concerns. It could expand
gradually both in numbers and in
actual power while providing a
focus for serious local political
action in the community.
If people are willing to
participate the details of forming
such a body are not a problem. As
a first step people in agreement
could sign a statement to that
effect. When a substantial number
had signed, perhaps 40 or 50
percent of the community, the
choice of representatives could
begin. They could be chosen by
the simple rule of one
representative per one hundred
people. Employees could choose
in their work group (i.e.
secretaries, maintenance workers,
administrators) or as they saw fit;
students in dorms could choose
by dorms, students not in dorms
by departments, students not in
departments as a separate group;
and faculty could choose as
faculty.
