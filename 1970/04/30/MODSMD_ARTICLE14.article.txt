# Inside Out
## Greenie Meanies 
### Jesse Cedarbaum 
Once upon a time there was a peaceful little place in the middle of
somewhere, which was otherwise known as Pepperford Farm. The
inhabitants of Pepperford were, by and large, a happy lot, with few
cares, if any, besetting them. So they chugged along behind their
happy lives, oblivious to the ominous threat looming up over the
not-so-far-out-horizon—"the notorious Greenie Meanies.
Everyone knows who the Greenie Meanies are. They're the big fat
monsters who have one pat remedy for all the world's ills—the dollar
pill. They force it down the throats of all of us because they'll lever be
happy until the whole world is green, the rivers and oceans flow with
black ink, and the sky is silver-grey and coppery-brown with the
pollution of change.
But the people of Pepperford were blissfully possessed with the
innocence of children. To them, the Greenie Meanies were only a
far-off legend and belonged in Washington along with Davy Crockett
and Benedict Arnold. Even if they were for real, what could these
monstrously evil sonofabitches want with the docile domain of
Pepperford?
But one almost-ordinary springtime day, the mind-curdling cry of
"Greeeeeneeeee Meeeeeneeeees!" rang out over Pepperford's red and
sandstone landscape with the shrill terror of a squealing pig busting as
it seems. Because Someone had discovered the actual livid presence of
Greenie Meanies on the Farm in the persons of the Reservedly
Obnoxious Trained Corpses. And what was even more astounding to
most was that the Mayor-Maynot of Pepperford, the renewed
chemunist General Pitz, had turned both cheeks to be licked by all
concerned.
No Credit For Meanies
So a vote was taken in Pepperford in which it was decided that the
Meanies could stay, but no one would give them credit for it.
However, the Pepperford vote was taken with a grain of salt, because
it was soon declared throughout the land by the Head Meanie himself,
President Nix, that the Corpses would not die, because all those who
in the future would want to remain in Pepperford without fear of
being blown into his Armed Farces would have to become corpses
themselves.
This coincided with a pieceful sit-in by the People of Pepperford at
the Old Onion. It was, in typical Pepperford fashion, a festive
occasion, and music resounded in the court late into the night.
Everybody knows that Meanies can't stand the sound of Music, so
while all this was happening General Pitz and his friends sat
fascist-to-fascist around a big green table deliberating what to do.
Finally, early in the morning, the band broke, and everybody knew
that the Nfeanies were coming. And indeed, before you could say
"Reservedly Obnoxious Trained Corpses" the General's green-skinned
troops, otherwise known as the Santa Clausa Country Bumpkins,
made their presents felt upon the heads of those unlucky Farmhands
chasing them out of their beloved Onion, in the process busting 22
victims for "trapsing on unauthorized domain."
A Little Stoning
So the nowhere men of Pepperford took to stoning, either the
Genreal's glasses into fragmentary remnants, or themselves into a
revolutionary apathetic fervor, just like the docile cattle the
Understudies at Pepperford Handbook tells them to be.
And there they remain to this very day, hopelessly stoned under
the yoke of the all-pervading Greenie Meenies, suffering from an acute
auto-paralysis of the will. Will they free themselves, or will it take a
minor miracle like a yellow submarine surfacing in the middle of a
memorialized fountain to bring an antidote to the Meanies'dollar-pill
and change the cents of their heads?
