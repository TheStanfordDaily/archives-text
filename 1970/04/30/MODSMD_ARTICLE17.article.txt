# Civilian Control
## Keep ROTC 
### Rep. McCloskey 
I would hope that Stanford will
permit ROTC to remain on
campus for several reasons.
First, I deem civilian control
over the military establishment to
be perhaps the most important
principle of our time. This control
can only exist if there are
knowledgeable civilians who fully
understand the military mind and
motivation. Unlike most graduates
of the service academies, ROTC
officers generally return shortly to
civilian life and many have
reached high stations in industry
and government where they can
exert a stabilizing influence over
military decision-making.
It has been my experience that
an ex-PFC or 2nd Lieutenant will
carry with him a life-long
skepticism over the accuracy of
opinions of Admirals and
Generals. A case in point was
John F. Kennedy's rejection of
the recommendations of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff for the bombing
and obliteration of the Cuban
missile sites in 1962.
The tragic mistake of massive
American military involvement in
Vietnam might never have
occurred had President Johnson
undergone sufficient military
experience to question the advice
he received from 1965 on that a
few more American troops would
insure victory.
Second, there also would seem
to be a benefit in preserving the
academic community's impact on
military thinking through the
rotation of promising military
instructors through 2 or 3 year
tours of duty on college
campuses. In our present times of
crisis there is danger in having
military men talking only with
themselves and college professors
talking only with their academic
colleagues.
In short, I fear an America
where the only military men are
professionals and where there are
no civilians in high places who
have not received some military
exposure and experience. The
perilous judgments in the years
ahead require cool heads who
understand both the military and
academic worlds.

Finally, I have the reservation
that our hostility and antagonism
towards our Vietnam policy may
distort our judgment somewhat
on peripheral matters connected
with the military. We will need
good professional military officers
in the future and I will feel a good
deal more comfortable if some of
them are Stanford graduates
rather than solely graduates of
West Point, Annapolis and the Air
Force Academy.
I would like to add a personal
hope that the Stanford
community will continue its
forceful expressions of dissent
from our present indefinite
involvement in Vietnam, but that
such dissent will be expressed in
peaceable and lawful ways.

exposure and experience. The
perilous judgments in the years
ahead require cool heads who
understand both the military and
academic worlds.

Finally, I have the reservation
that our hostility and antagonism
towards our Vietnam policy may
distort our judgment somewhat
on peripheral matters connected
with the military. We will need
good professional military officers
in the future and I will feel a good
deal more comfortable if some of
them are Stanford graduates
rather than solely graduates of
West Point, Annapolis and the Air
Force Academy.
I would like to add a personal
hope that the Stanford
community will continue its
forceful expressions of dissent
from our present indefinite
involvement in Vietnam, but that
such dissent will be expressed in
peaceable and lawful ways.

I would hope that Stanford will
permit ROTC to remain on
campus for several reasons.
First, I deem civilian control
over the military establishment to
be perhaps the most important
principle of our time. This control
can only exist if there are
knowledgeable civilians who fully
understand the military mind and
motivation. Unlike most graduates
of the service academies, ROTC
officers generally return shortly to
civilian life and many have
reached high stations in industry
and government where they can
exert a stabilizing influence over
military decision-making.
It has been my experience that
an ex-PFC or 2nd Lieutenant will
carry with him a life-long
skepticism over the accuracy of
opinions of Admirals and
Generals. A case in point was
John F. Kennedy's rejection of
the recommendations of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff for the bombing
and obliteration of the Cuban
missile sites in 1962.
The tragic mistake of massive
American military involvement in
Vietnam might never have
occurred had President Johnson
undergone sufficient military
experience to question the advice
he received from 1965 on that a
few more American troops would
insure victory.
Second, there also would seem
to be a benefit in preserving the
academic community's impact on
military thinking through the
rotation of promising military
instructors through 2 or 3 year
tours of duty on college
campuses. In our present times of
crisis there is danger in having
military men talking only with
themselves and college professors
talking only with their academic
colleagues.
In short, I fear an America
where the only military men are
professionals and where there are
no civilians in high places who
have not received some military
exposure and experience. The
perilous judgments in the years
ahead require cool heads who
understand both the military and
academic worlds.

Finally, I have the reservation
that our hostility and antagonism
towards our Vietnam policy may
distort our judgment somewhat
on peripheral matters connected
with the military. We will need
good professional military officers
in the future and I will feel a good
deal more comfortable if some of
them are Stanford graduates
rather than solely graduates of
West Point, Annapolis and the Air

hope that the Stanford
community will continue its
