# Play Doctor
## Good Old Ermaline 
### Jess Andrus 
Now, I'd been living a fairly
normal life as a white racist before
I came to Stanford and then all of
a sudden all the: coffee cups
were smashing all around and
people were having fireside chats
beside burning buildings and it
was like different from anything I
was ever used to back home.
I got to thinking about people
throwing coffee cups and tried to
figure out what they were like.
Physically they appeared fairly
normal except for the eyes. They
got funny eyes. Have you ever
noticed a fanatic's eyes when he's
screaming at you? If they're
brown they have kind of a
clouded look, somewhat muddy
you might say, and if they're blue
they kind of remind you of
cracked ice. But that's a fairly
minor difference from everybody
else. I got to wondering about
where all these funny eyed people
come from.
Now I don't figure they come
from any hot bed of communism
or any Midwest foundling home
run by some demented monk with
a sense of humor or anything like
that. No, I figure they must come
from common, everyday homes.
You know, have mothers and
fathers and things—maybe a few
of each. If you've moved around
like I have it makes you feel kind
of strange when you think that
somewhere like at Hartnell Junior
College or Stanford or U.C. Santa
Barbara or Yale or Jetma there
might be some coffee cup thrower
running around, bugging
everybody with his funny eyes,
who sat next to you in third
grade—some everyday mother's
gon gone squash rot.
It makes you wonder about all
those guys who went to school
with you—the wierd ones who
used to throw up or win all the
spelling bees or eat bugs. Just
what kind of little kid is the early
coffee cup thrower? What was he
like before he began to wonder
what Pinky Lee was like?
Remember Harold
Do you remember that guy
Harold who used to sit in the back
row of Miss Bradey's class? He
was allergic to hard boiled eggs
and he used to eat hard boiled
eggs about once a week and throw
up during sums in the afternoon
about once a week. He had
translucent skin, so white and
purple blotches used to shine
through his cheeks.
When he got sick the purple
blotches would light up like flares
and somebody would shout,
"There he goes!" and Harold
would run for the door holding
his hand to his mouth and the
custodian would be shoveling
sawdust everywhere and
everybody would be giggling
trying to take his mind off it so he
wouldn't be sick too and when it
was all over Harold would come
back, the purple blotches all
fizzled out, the white ones taking
over and turned a death pale grey.
Ermaline Of Course
"I'm allergic to hard boiled
eggs," he'd say. When he got to
high school they voted him Most
Likely to Succeed because they
knew he was wierd.

Of course there was Ermaline in
first grade. She was kind of a
dichotomy. On the one hand she
used to go to the bathroom in
class, which was uncool, but, on
the other hand, she used to dig
playing doctor which was cool.
Her mother gave her a Golden
Book called Doctor Dan the
Bandage \lan; it had little
band-aids attached to the back
cover. All the guys wanted to go
over to her house and play. "Put
one near her, Ermaline." Her
mother used to call up the stairs,
"Whare are you doing?" and
Ermaline would yell, "Playing,"
and her mother would yell back,
"That's a nice girl!"
Actually, Ermaline wasn't all
that fun to play with after awhile
because she always wanted to be
doctor—never nurse or patient or
anything. She began to loose
friends and when she first went to
the bathroom in class she really
began losing them.
"Teacher, teacher, I've gone
poo-poo." That was really rough
talk to the rest of us: we all said
"number two."
Ermaline was the best student
in the class and the teacher used
to let her pass out the milk and
cookies all the time, so she was
really shocked that her best
student should mess up a seat.
"Why, Ermaline! Why didn't you
say something before?"
Ermaline looked embarrassed
but there was the beginning of a
smile. "I forgot to raise my
hand," she said.
Last I heard, Ermaline had
come to Stanford.
