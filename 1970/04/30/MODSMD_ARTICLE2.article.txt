# Rocks, Curses

### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
At six yesterday evening four Santa Clara policemen were playing
ping pong at the Stanford police station.
"You know," one commented, "I agree with a lot Jerry Rubin says
about American society. But why do these guys want to destroy
Stanford? I just can't understand it."
Four hours later, the deputy and his fifty colleagues were getting a
first hand lesson in the "Do It" philosophy.
At six p.m. none could have predicted the night would end with
street warfare and the most intense violence in Stanford's history.
"I'm getting real tired of coming up here," a deputy complained as
he waited for the arrival of police bussing up t i Stanford from their
headquarters in San Jose.
Vanguard
The advance unit at the campus police station had been on campus
at dawn in anticipation of an early morning sit-in. A two hour nap in
the afternoon was their only rest during the day.
Shortly after six they got the first word that Old Union
demonstrators would be given a five minute warning before arrests

Police Sidelights

began. "We anticipate no resistance," said Captain Tom Rosa, head of
the Santa Clara crowd control squad.
Even as Rosa spoke, he was concerned that a delay in San Jose
would push the police action past daylight. "I wish they'd hurry up
and get here," he commented, "Our supply men are late so we can't
get the buses loaded. One's wife is having a baby."
Rosa's tactical plan called for a police strike about 7:30. As the
minutes passed beyond that hour, ominous reports reached in
Captain. "Roadblocks are goin up," he was told. "The students are
collecting rocks and bottles."
Rosa continued to develop his strategy, drawing a crude map on
the blackboard. Surprise was not to be the key element. "It's going to
be different from last week," promised Rosa. "We'll seal off the
building and let anyone leave for five minutes."
Faculty Observers
Faculty observers arrived at the police station shortly before seven.
Associate Provost Robert Rosenzweig brought a large tub of
Kentucky Fried Chicken.
The wait continued.
President Pitzer and his staff consulted in an office, but they no
longer had much to say about tactics. Conversations with the police
earlier in the day was the moment for prolonged strategic discussion.
Tension built. The ping pong stopped. By eight, police were
intensely serious. A special unit of the riot control group quietly
discussed their plans. It was clear they did not look forward to the
night.
Santa Clara Sheriff Charles Prelsnick arrived with the SU deputies
about 8:20. The final briefing began. Rosa repeated his earlier
instructions about a warning before arrests.
The troops stood in full uniform behind seated faculty members,
Pitzer, in his shirt sleeves, looked depressed. So did Provost Richard
Lyman.
Tear Gas
"No gas will be used except with my order or Mr. Marron's or the
Sheriff's," said Rosa. "Let's keep our cool."
Faculty members were teamed with police units. Suited professors
stood in sharp contrast next to helmeted police. The marriage of gown
and town was uneasy at best.
Units loaded into buses and patrol cars. The convoy began its slow
ride across campus to the Old Union.
It first passed a lookout motorcycle for the sit-in. As the driver saw
the convoy coming, he leaped onto his cycle. It wouldn't start.
As the first police cars pulled in front of Boman Alumni house,
rocks began cracking against the windows. Faculty observers hit the
floor.
"This sure as hell is the wrong place to be," one moaned. Within
seconds the car had stopped and the police were out.
Rocks and curses filled the air. It seemed a long way from the ping
pong table. The night had just begun.
