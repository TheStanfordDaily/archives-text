# Ehrlichs' New Ecology Book
## 
### 
The world can't be saved by
tearing down our institutions, but
only by "bending" them, biology
Prof. Paul Ehrlich and his wife,
Anne, conclude in a new book to
be published April 30 entitled
"Population, Resources,
Environment: Issues in Human
Ecology."
The Ehilichs' new book
explores in detail not only the
explosive growth of human
population, but also examines
closely many of the most
authoritative studies of remedies
proposed to cure our ecological
ills.
"It has been our aim to
produce a reasonably
comprehensive and reliable
sourcebook . . ." say the authors,
"a book that can serve the needs
of teachers and students as well as
the needs of general readers who
may not be enrolled in any formal
courses."
Documentation
"We have tried to make clear,
by providing adequate detail and
documentation, our reasons for
sharing with many well-informed
and concerned citizens of the
world a gloomy prognosis for
mankind," the authors say. "We
have also tried to include many
constructive proposals and
suggestions that offer possible
means of brightening that
prognosis."
Their "gloomy" conclusions
include the belief that the world
already is over-populated and
undernourished, and that our
ability to produce more food by
the usual methods has about
reached its limit. Attempts to
further speed up food production
by such chemical means as DDT
and other harmful methods
threaten to accelerate an
environmental breakdown that is
already well under way.
Eventually a "death rate
solution" by plague or nuclear
catstrophe will end the population
problem if we don't solve it
ourselves. To avoid such an ending
they recommend:
Recommendations
1. Population control to stop
population growth now. Political

pressure, via the ballot box,
should be brought to bear on
elected government officials to
undertake regulation of the birth
rate and stabilize population.
Then a compaign to "de-develop"
the U.S. and restore the
environment should begin.
2. Once these things are
accomplished, the U.S. will be in a
position to urge similar refomis in
other countries, both developed
and underdeveloped.
"It is unfortunate that at the
time of the greatest crisis the U.S.
and the world have ever faced,
many Americans, especially the
young, have given up hope that
the government can be
modernized and changed in
direction through the functioning

of the elective process," the
Ehrlichs write.
"Their despair may have some
foundation, but . . .many
members of Congress and other
government leaders, both
Democrats and Republicans, are
very much aware of the problems
outlined in this book and are
determined to do something
about them."
Facing Uncertainty
The Ehrlichs admit they cannot
guarantee the accuracy of
everything in the book, since in
some areas "it is impossible to
determine exac*ly what has
happened . . . data are often
unreliable or unavailable, and our
understanding of the complexities

of ecological systems and human
behavior is still fragmentary.
"But in dealing with the
pop ulation-re source-environment
crisis, it is important to recognize
that people are going to have to
learn to make decisions in the face
of such uncertainty. Possible
benefits will have to be weighed
against possible risks, and a great
deal of thought given to possible
future events which may seem
unlikely but which will be
catastrophic if they do occur.
"It would be a major step
forward for mankind if all people
could know the general state of
the world and could be informed
as to just what chances are being
taken with their lives and the lives
of future generations."

Democrats and Republicans, are
very much aware of the problems
outlined in this book and are
determined to do something
about them."
Facing Uncertainty
The Ehrlichs admit they cannot
guarantee the accuracy of
everything in the book, since in
some areas "it is impossible to
determine exac*ly what has
happened . . . data are often
unreliable or unavailable, and our
understanding of the complexities

of ecological systems and human
behavior is still fragmentary.
"But in dealing with the
pop ulation-re source-environment
crisis, it is important to recognize
that people are going to have to
learn to make decisions in the face
of such uncertainty. Possible
benefits will have to be weighed
against possible risks, and a great
deal of thought given to possible
future events which may seem
unlikely but which will be
catastrophic if they do occur.
"It would be a major step
forward for mankind if all people
could know the general state of
the world and could be informed
as to just what chances are being
taken with their lives and the lives
of future generations."
The world can't be saved by
tearing down our institutions, but
only by "bending" them, biology
Prof. Paul Ehrlich and his wife,
Anne, conclude in a new book to
be published April 30 entitled
"Population, Resources,
Environment: Issues in Human
Ecology."
The Ehilichs' new book
explores in detail not only the
explosive growth of human
population, but also examines
closely many of the most
authoritative studies of remedies
proposed to cure our ecological
ills.
"It has been our aim to
produce a reasonably
comprehensive and reliable
sourcebook . . ." say the authors,
"a book that can serve the needs
of teachers and students as well as
the needs of general readers who
may not be enrolled in any formal
courses."
Documentation
"We have tried to make clear,
by providing adequate detail and
documentation, our reasons for
sharing with many well-informed
and concerned citizens of the
world a gloomy prognosis for
mankind," the authors say. "We
have also tried to include many
constructive proposals and
suggestions that offer possible
means of brightening that
prognosis."
Their "gloomy" conclusions
include the belief that the world
already is over-populated and
undernourished, and that our
ability to produce more food by
the usual methods has about
reached its limit. Attempts to
further speed up food production
by such chemical means as DDT
and other harmful methods
threaten to accelerate an
environmental breakdown that is
already well under way.
Eventually a "death rate
solution" by plague or nuclear
catstrophe will end the population
problem if we don't solve it
ourselves. To avoid such an ending
they recommend:
Recommendations
1. Population control to stop
population growth now. Political

pressure, via the ballot box,
should be brought to bear on
elected government officials to
undertake regulation of the birth
rate and stabilize population.
Then a compaign to "de-develop"
the U.S. and restore the
environment should begin.
2. Once these things are
accomplished, the U.S. will be in a
position to urge similar refomis in
other countries, both developed
and underdeveloped.
"It is unfortunate that at the
time of the greatest crisis the U.S.
and the world have ever faced,
many Americans, especially the
young, have given up hope that
the government can be
modernized and changed in
direction through the functioning

of the elective process," the
Ehrlichs write.
"Their despair may have some
foundation, but . . .many
members of Congress and other
government leaders, both
Democrats and Republicans, are
very much aware of the problems
outlined in this book and are
determined to do something
about them."
