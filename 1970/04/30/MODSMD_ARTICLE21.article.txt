# 5 Faculty Members Elected To Nat'l. Science Academy
## 
### 
Five Stanford faculty
members—more than from any
other institution—were among the
50 scientists elected to the
National Academy of Sciences
here Tuesday, according to an
academy announcement.
Those named were chemistry
Prof. John I). Baldeschwieler,
biochemistry Prof. A Dale Kaiser,
electrical engineering Prof. Gerald
L. Pearson, physics Prof. Arthur
L. Schawlow, and mathematics
Prof. Menahem M. Schiffer.
The election brings the total
number of Stanford faculty
members in the academy to 42.
The academy has 870 members in
all. Election to its roster is
considered ony of the highest
honors an American scientist can
receive.
Prof. Baldeschwieler is a
member of President Nixon's
Science Advisory Committee and
has received numerous awards for
his contributions to chemistry. He
played a leading role in developing

"nuclear magnetic double
resonance" and ion cyclotron
resonance spectroscopy as tools
for analyzing molecular structure
and the mechanisms of chemical
reactions.
Prof Kaiser was among the first
to investigate the quantitative
genetics of bacterial viruses. His
studies formed the basis for much
of our understanding of hos
viruses interact with their host
cells, and how they may produce
cancer. His detailed biochemical
investigations of viral genes have
clarified their organization in the
chromosomes of viruses and much
of the mechanisms by which they
are often incorporated into the
host chromosome.
Prof. Pearson is a co-inventor of
the solar battery, and joined the
faculty of his alma mater,
Stanford, in 1960 after 31 years
of research in semiconductors and

other fields at Bell Telephone
Laboratories.
Prof. Schawlow, a co-inventor
of the laser and head of Stanford's
Physics Department, has received
many honors recognizing his
contributions to optical and
microwave spectroscopy, nuclear
quadrupole resonance,
superconductivity and lasers.
Prof. Schiffer is considered one
of the world's leading authorities
on complex variables and
conformal mapping. His special
province is the application of
these fields to mathematical
physics, and especially
hydrodynamics.
The National Academy of
Sciences was established by
President Abraham Lincoln in
1863. Its principal role is
providing scientific advice to the
President when requested, and it
is dedicated to the furtherance of
science for the general welfare.
