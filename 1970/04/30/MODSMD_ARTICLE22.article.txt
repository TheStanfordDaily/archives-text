# Fire bombing
## Nixon's Sympathy 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon yesterday wrote what
amounted to a sympathy note to
a visiting scholar from India
whose 22-year study of India's
caste system was destroyed in a
fire bombing last Friday at
Stanford University.
The Indian, M.N. Srinivas, was
among ten visiting scholars at
Stanford's Center for Advanced
Studies in firebombings that
followed an anti-ROTC
demonstration on campus.
"It can be small consolation
for you to know," wrote Nixon,
"that the overwhelming
proportion of the American
people, and of the American
academic community, utterly
reject the tactics of a person or
persons who did this.
"To say that they are
deranged, does not excuse them.
To say, what is more probably the
case, that they are simply evil,
does not make them go away."
To Srinivas, recognized as one
of India's outstanding
anthropologists, Nixon went on:
"I hope that the great insights

of social anthropology that you
have brought to your studies
might serve in this moment to
help you understand this tragedy.
Please at all events know that you
are an honored and welcome
guest."
