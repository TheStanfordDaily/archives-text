# Violence Erupts After Sit-in
## 
### 
Continued from page 1
The demonstrators continued
to meet, many of them standing
on steps leading to the building.
As time passed, many went inside
the building.
Linus Pauling
Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling,
who Tuesday stated his support of
a non-violent sit-in, entered the
building at about 5:25 p.m. to
urge the group to adjourn to the
Nitery. He later left and held a
long discussion with about 75
people in front of the Nitery.
Rumors of imminent police
action grew more frequent as
darkness enveloped the courtyard.
The numbers of the crowd varied
from 60 to 100 inside during this
period. Provost Lyman, on KZSU
at 7, said demonstrators would
have adequate time to leave
before police would move in.
Demonstrators had posted sentries
on entrance routes to campus.
Announcement of the U.S.
invasion into Cambodia yesterday
appeared to trigger a large amount
of resentment felt by the crowd
last night. The demonstrators
repeatedly demanded that the
University publicly denounce the
U.S. presence in Cambodia by
noon tomorrow during their
meetings.
Police Arrive
Finally, at 8:50, 55 Santa Clara
deputies, in three cars and two
buses moved on the Old Union
area. They encountered rocks as
they came and the driver of one
car was hit by a rock. The police
encountered a "blockade" of cars
on Santa Theresa Street as they
approached the rear of the Old
Union building. One police car
pushed the cars blocking the road
out of the way.
As people gathered at the rear
and sides of the building, the
deputies quickly circled to the
front doors of the Old Union.
Demonstrators massed near the
doors of the Union when they
received reports that the police
were coming. When the

demonstrators realized that the
police would enter by the front
door, they left the building and
stood in front of the doors only
to be pushed away by the police.
Police arrested ten people who
had signed a statement earlier that
they would face arrest rather than
leave. No injuries to the four
women and six men arrested were
reported. Faculty observers,
wearing green armbands, moved in
with the police.
Illegal Assembly
The police formed a line in
front of the main doors, and along
the outer walkways, leaving only
the front entrance of the
courtyard open. They withdrew
to the main entrance a short time
later. Tamm declared the
gathering an illegal assembly at
8:55 although his announcement
was largely drowned out by
hooting demonstrators.
Angry demonstrators faced the
police at the doors. Several
demonstrators talked softly at the
impassive officers while many
hurled insults.
Shouting matches ensued
between demonstrators and
conservative students in the
courtyard. Inside the building
police were booking the 4 women
and 6 men.
Group Marches
A group of about 800 left the
courtyard, marching toward
Encina Hall. Fifty to 100
t remained in the courtyard.
Several people reportedly
entered the back of Encina Hall
but quickly left. According to
officials, no records were harmed.
Ten Los Altos policemen, called
under the Mutual Aid agreement,
were in front of the building.
Several windows were broken by
rocks.
The crowd drifted toward the
ROTC building around 9:35.
Amidst cries of "no rocks, no
rocks," a group broke into the
main entrance and urged others to
move into the building. At its
height the p. roup inside numbered

about 30. Windows were broken
and furniture overturned, but no
heavy damage was reported.
Business School
The group then moved towards
the Graduate School of Business.
About a dozen Business students
were in the building and about 8
FCM members joined this group
in patroling. A large number of
windows were broken as the
demonstrators swept by. Some
demonstrators again urged no
rocks be thrown for fear of
harming people inside.
During this time, around ten
o'clock, a fire broke out in a
construction shack between
Maples Pavilion and Manzanita
Park. The fire, of unknown origin,
was quickly put out by the
Stanford Fire Department.
The crowd, still numbering
around 800 went back to the Old
Union courtyard, proceeding
down Lasuen.
Practically filling the courtyard,
the group held a meeting at the
microphone near the Nitery to
explore other possibilities for
action. Several speakers suggested
a student strike emphasising the
need to keep the police on
campus "all night tonight and
every day until this place has to
shut down."
Bazile Speaks
Black Student Union president
Leo Bazile derided the crowd for
not taking meaningful action, and
for a lack of leadership. "If this
were Berkeley, this place would
be in flames; tear gas would "be
everywhere. This is supposed to
be a people's army. Well where are
your generals?" Bazile said. "I
know damn well you won't do
anything. If you want something
interesting to do, then take a walk
through the Old Union right over
there, but I think you may as well
just go home." After several other
speakers, the crowd moved
toward the building. The police
braced, and after a short time
charged, driving the crowd out the
main entrance of the courtyard,
toward the White Plaza fountain.
Members of the newly formed
"Non-Violent Group" say they sat
undisturbed in a circle near the
fountain during these charges.
After this point, police
periodically surged at the crowd,
driving them further toward the
Undergraduate Library with each
charge. Police tried to flank the
crowd repeatedly, eventually
entering the lobby of the
Undergraduate Library around
11:40. Rocks and fragments of
concrete bike stands were hurled
at police. One student was
repeatedly clubbed by a circle of
5 policemen in the lobby.
At midnight, 30 policemen
formed a line between Quad and

the Old Union, facing off with the
crowd.
Tear Gas
At 12:22 they surged and in an
effort to disperse the crowd,
police fired eight cannisters of gas
into a group of people near the
Alavarado Row side of the library.
The gas was reported to be
either smoke bombs or CS tear
gas. Several demonstrators
complained of inflamed eyes and
skin. Sheriffs later claimed it was
a mild tear gas.
The ebb and flow of police and
demonstrators continued another
30 minutes around the library and
adjacent parking lot.
The crowd, now numbering
about 200, then marched down
Galvez Street towards Encina
Hall. While some protestors
watched police stationed at the
west and main entrances, another
group of 75-100 moved on the
East wing of the building,
smashing numerous windows and
throwing rocks at the police.
Police moved in from the front
walkway, and the group retreated
past Toyon to Escondido Road.
By one o'clock many protestors
had gone home, with 75 people
remaining at the corner of Galvez
and Escondido in an effort to
keep the police on campus until
this morning.
Two bomb scares were reported
at Old Union during the protest,
one shortly before tear gas was
thrown near the library.

County Jail. Bijay K. Sharma, 23, a
Graduate student from India in
Electrical Engineering, was also
