### DENNIS MORROW 
Cr cw

The Stanford crew lost 59
shirts last weekend in a
disappointing series of races.
Friday the Indian oarsmen were
swept by UCLA and Saturday a
JV second was the best they could
manage in the San Diego
Invitational Regatta.
The Stanford frosh started off
the Harbach Cup competition on
Friday with a poorly-rowed
20-second loss to the young
Bruins. Stanford was never a
serious threat and only managed
to hold off USC by a four second
margin.
Temporary Brightening
Prospects brightened when the
JV boat, lead by sophomore
stroke Harry Waters, spotted
UCLA more than a length in the
first 500 meters, but then fought
back to within six seats and
almost caught them with a furious
sprint at the end. The final margin
was less than a half-length.
The varsity eight couldn't get it
together however and they
dropped the final race by 14
seconds. This was the worst
varsity loss in coach Will Condon's
seven year reign at Stanford.
Saturday saw revived spirits in
all three boats for the San Diego
Regatta. The freshmen lead for
1800 meters, but lost it all when
they lost an oar in the sprint.
The JV's, hampered by a bad
start and poor steering down the
course, again turned in the best
Stanford effort placing second in
their six boat race. They lost by
four seconds to an Orange Coast
eight that may be a contender for
the sprints trophy
Upset
The varsity boat, showing what
coach Condon hopes was a flash
of future style, was fighting for
the lead in their race all the way
down the course. They were
passed by Long Beach, Loyola,
and Irvine only in the last 300
meters as Friday's race took its
toll, and finished within three
seconds of the Irvine crew which
beat UCLA last week.
In a heavyweight-four event,
STanford's third bout nearly
pulled an upset. Stroked by Larry
Gulberg, they were also in the
lead until the 1500 meter mark
when set problems left them
fighting for fourth.
Both varsity boats are in heavy
training now for the Cal race on
May 9 and the Western Sprint
Championships on May 15 and
16. Condon said he expects there
may be some changes made in the
varsity boat as a result of seat
races this week, but the entire
team is pointing to both Cal and
the Sprints to get some revenge
for this weekend's races.

The Intramural Track and
Field Meet will be held on May 4
and May 6 at Angel Field. The
deadline for sign-ups is April 30.
The track events will be run in the
following order: 70 yd.
Intermediate Hurdles, 100, Mile,
440, 120 Low Hurdles, 220, 880,
and 880 Relay. The broad jump,
triple jump, high jump, pole vault,
and shot put will make up the
field events.
The two mile run final will be
run on Monday May 4 along with
the preliminaries. For those with
very strong bodies and weak
minds, a new event has been
added to this year's meet, the mile
relay. This event will probably be
held at the opposite end of the
track meet from the 880 relay. El
Toro is back to defend its title for
the umpteenth consecutive year.
In softball, the Theta Delts
showed that they are as strong as
ever as they crushed Delta Chi
10-0 in 4 innings. The teams
which might give the Theta Delts
some trouble in their title defense
include Theta Chi, SAE, Phi Kap,
Cro Mem, Phuds, KA, and Alpha
Delt to mention just a few.
In the B team game the KA's
defeated Donner 14-4 in 5 innings
despite an intramural record for
walks given up by the KA pitcher.
This reporter lost track of the
number somewhere in the
neighborhood of 10, but the
strong hitting attack of the KA
team easily overcame their
hurler's ineptness.

with an 87-67 upset. But in
Saturday's contest at Berkeley's
Edwards Stadium, the Bears will
be decided favorites.
Although Cal has lost four

The Stanford crew lost 59
shirts last weekend in a
disappointing series of races.
Friday the Indian oarsmen were
swept by UCLA and Saturday a
JV second was the best they could
manage in the San Diego
Invitational Regatta.
The Stanford frosh started off
the Harbach Cup competition on
Friday with a poorly-rowed
20-second loss to the young
Bruins. Stanford was never a
serious threat and only managed
to hold off USC by a four second
margin.
Temporary Brightening
Prospects brightened when the
JV boat, lead by sophomore
stroke Harry Waters, spotted
UCLA more than a length in the
first 500 meters, but then fought
back to within six seats and
almost caught them with a furious
sprint at the end. The final margin
was less than a half-length.
The varsity eight couldn't get it
together however and they
dropped the final race by 14
seconds. This was the worst
varsity loss in coach Will Condon's
seven year reign at Stanford.
Saturday saw revived spirits in
all three boats for the San Diego
Regatta. The freshmen lead for
1800 meters, but lost it all when
they lost an oar in the sprint.
The JV's, hampered by a bad
start and poor steering down the
course, again turned in the best
Stanford effort placing second in
their six boat race. They lost by
four seconds to an Orange Coast
eight that may be a contender for
the sprints trophy
Upset
The varsity boat, showing what
coach Condon hopes was a flash
of future style, was fighting for
the lead in their race all the way
down the course. They were
passed by Long Beach, Loyola,
and Irvine only in the last 300
meters as Friday's race took its
toll, and finished within three
seconds of the Irvine crew which
beat UCLA last week.
In a heavyweight-four event,
STanford's third bout nearly
pulled an upset. Stroked by Larry
Gulberg, they were also in the
lead until the 1500 meter mark
when set problems left them
fighting for fourth.
Both varsity boats are in heavy
training now for the Cal race on
May 9 and the Western Sprint
Championships on May 15 and
16. Condon said he expects there
may be some changes made in the
varsity boat as a result of seat
races this week, but the entire
team is pointing to both Cal and
the Sprints to get some revenge
for this weekend's races.

The Intramural Track and
Field Meet will be held on May 4

deadline for sign-ups is April 30.
The track events will be run in the
following order: 70 yd.
Intermediate Hurdles, 100, Mile,
440, 120 Low Hurdles, 220, 880,
and 880 Relay. The broad jump,
triple jump, high jump, pole vault,

field events.
The two mile run final will be

the preliminaries. For those with
very strong bodies and weak

added to this year's meet, the mile
relay. This event will probably be
held at the opposite end of the
track meet from the 880 relay. El
Toro is back to defend its title for
the umpteenth consecutive year.
In softball, the Theta Delts
showed that they are as strong as
ever as they crushed Delta Chi
10-0 in 4 innings. The teams
which might give the Theta Delts
some trouble in their title defense
include Theta Chi, SAE, Phi Kap,
Cro Mem, Phuds, KA, and Alpha
Delt to mention just a few.
In the B team game the KA's
defeated Donner 14-4 in 5 innings
despite an intramural record for
walks given up by the KA pitcher.
This reporter lost track of the

The Stanford crew lost 59
shirts last weekend in a
disappointing series of races.
Friday the Indian oarsmen were
swept by UCLA and Saturday a
JV second was the best they could
manage in the San Diego
Invitational Regatta.
The Stanford frosh started off
the Harbach Cup competition on
Friday with a poorly-rowed
20-second loss to the young
Bruins. Stanford was never a
serious threat and only managed
to hold off USC by a four second
margin.
Temporary Brightening
Prospects brightened when the
JV boat, lead by sophomore
stroke Harry Waters, spotted
UCLA more than a length in the
first 500 meters, but then fought
back to within six seats and
almost caught them with a furious
sprint at the end. The final margin
was less than a half-length.
The varsity eight couldn't get it
together however and they
dropped the final race by 14
seconds. This was the worst
varsity loss in coach Will Condon's
seven year reign at Stanford.
Saturday saw revived spirits in
all three boats for the San Diego
Regatta. The freshmen lead for
1800 meters, but lost it all when
they lost an oar in the sprint.
The JV's, hampered by a bad
start and poor steering down the
course, again turned in the best
Stanford effort placing second in
their six boat race. They lost by
four seconds to an Orange Coast
eight that may be a contender for
the sprints trophy
Upset
The varsity boat, showing what
coach Condon hopes was a flash
of future style, was fighting for
the lead in their race all the way
down the course. They were
passed by Long Beach, Loyola,
and Irvine only in the last 300
meters as Friday's race took its
toll, and finished within three
seconds of the Irvine crew which
beat UCLA last week.
In a heavyweight-four event,
STanford's third bout nearly
pulled an upset. Stroked by Larry
Gulberg, they were also in the
lead until the 1500 meter mark
when set problems left them
fighting for fourth.
Both varsity boats are in heavy
training now for the Cal race on
May 9 and the Western Sprint
Championships on May 15 and
16. Condon said he expects there
may be some changes made in the
varsity boat as a result of seat
races this week, but the entire
team is pointing to both Cal and
the Sprints to get some revenge
for this weekend's races.

The varsity eight couldn't get it
together however and they
dropped the final race by 14
seconds. This was the worst
varsity loss in coach Will Condon's
seven year reign at Stanford.
Saturday saw revived spirits in
all three boats for the San Diego
Regatta. The freshmen lead for
1800 meters, but lost it all when
they lost an oar in the sprint.
The JV's, hampered by a bad
start and poor steering down the
course, again turned in the best
Stanford effort placing second in
their six boat race. They lost by
four seconds to an Orange Coast
eight that may be a contender for
the sprints trophy
Upset
The varsity boat, showing what
coach Condon hopes was a flash
of future style, was fighting for
the lead in their race all the way
down the course. They were
passed by Long Beach, Loyola,
and Irvine only in the last 300
meters as Friday's race took its
toll, and finished within three
seconds of the Irvine crew which
beat UCLA last week.
In a heavyweight-four event,
STanford's third bout nearly
pulled an upset. Stroked by Larry
Gulberg, they were also in the
lead until the 1500 meter mark
when set problems left them
fighting for fourth.
Both varsity boats are in heavy
training now for the Cal race on
May 9 and the Western Sprint
Championships on May 15 and
16. Condon said he expects there
may be some changes made in the
varsity boat as a result of seat
races this week, but the entire
team is pointing to both Cal and
the Sprints to get some revenge
for this weekend's races.

The Intramural Track and
Field Meet will be held on May 4
and May 6 at Angel Field. The
deadline for sign-ups is April 30.
The track events will be run in the
following order: 70 yd.
Intermediate Hurdles, 100, Mile,
440, 120 Low Hurdles, 220, 880,
and 880 Relay. The broad jump,
triple jump, high jump, pole vault,
and shot put will make up the
field events.
The two mile run final will be
run on Monday May 4 along with
the preliminaries. For those with
very strong bodies and weak
minds, a new event has been
added to this year's meet, the mile
relay. This event will probably be
held at the opposite end of the
track meet from the 880 relay. El
Toro is back to defend its title for
the umpteenth consecutive year.
In softball, the Theta Delts
showed that they are as strong as
ever as they crushed Delta Chi
10-0 in 4 innings. The teams
which might give the Theta Delts
some trouble in their title defense
include Theta Chi, SAE, Phi Kap,
Cro Mem, Phuds, KA, and Alpha
Delt to mention just a few.
In the B team game the KA's
defeated Donner 14-4 in 5 innings
despite an intramural record for
walks given up by the KA pitcher.
This reporter lost track of the
number somewhere in the

The Stanford crew lost 59
shirts last weekend in a
disappointing series of races.
Friday the Indian oarsmen were
swept by UCLA and Saturday a
JV second was the best they could
manage in the San Diego
Invitational Regatta.
The Stanford frosh started off
the Harbach Cup competition on
Friday with a poorly-rowed
20-second loss to the young
Bruins. Stanford was never a
serious threat and only managed
to hold off USC by a four second
margin.
Temporary Brightening
Prospects brightened when the
JV boat, lead by sophomore
stroke Harry Waters, spotted
UCLA more than a length in the
first 500 meters, but then fought
back to within six seats and
almost caught them with a furious
sprint at the end. The final margin
was less than a half-length.
The varsity eight couldn't get it
together however and they
dropped the final race by 14
seconds. This was the worst
