# Stanford Nine Wins Non-League Decision
## 
### CLIVE HEALY 
Sophomore Tom Williams,
playing the first game of his career
with the varsity, drove in the
decisive runs with a seventh-inning
single Tuesday to give Stanford a
4-2 baseball win over USF.
The Indians, now '29-11-1 this
season, went into the seventh
trailing 1-0, but scored four times
to break open the game.
First baseman Mike Nelson
evened things up with a sole home
run over the right-center field
fence. It was Nelson's fourth
home run in his last four games.
A double by outfielder Steve
Wilhelm and a single by Curt Fant
put runners on first and third,
with Fant then stealing second.
Freshman catcher Bob Reece
singled in the tie-breaking run,
and then pitcher Jim Coate
walked to load the bases. Leadoff
man Dave Edson forced Fant at
the plate, but Williams followed
with his two-run single to give
Stanford a 4-1 bulge.
Coate allowed an unearned run
in the eighth, then got out of a
jam in the ninth to earn his sixth
victory of the year against one
loss. Coate entered the game in
the sixth inning after sophomore
Bob Kammeyer had shut out the
Dons on three hits over the first
five innings.
In addition to his home run,
Nelson collected two other hits to
raise his team-leading batting
average to .282. He also leads the
Indians in home runs (8) and
RBl's (34).
Williams, the leading hitter on
Stanford's frosh team last year,
was one of five players brought up
from the frosh-soph team by
Coach Ray Young for Tuesday's
game. Without a .300 hitter on
the varsity, Young reached down
to the Brave team for some hitting
and came up with outfielders
Williams and Pat Rusco, infielder
Gary Osterhout, and
pitcher-outfielder Rod Boone. In

addition, Young brought up
sophomore pitcher Bobby Scott,
who has notched six straight wins
for the Braves this year.
This weekend the Indians will
host Oregon and Oregon State in
back-to-back double-headers
Friday and Saturday. Still one
game back of Southern Division
co-leaders USC and California,
Stanford will need a sweep or
something similar to make up any
ground.
Young expects to go with Phil
Keller (6-4, 1.57 E.R.A.) and
Steve Dunning (11-1, 1.35
E.R.A.) against Oregon Friday.
Dammeyer, after his strong
five-inning stint Tuesday, earned a
starting shot in one of Saturday's
games, with the second starter still
unannounced.
Meanwhile back at Stanford,
the frosh-soph team, minus the
fine stars called up, still dumped
USF 13-3. John Day picked up
three hits and drove in five runs to
pace the attack. Scott Bush went
six innings to pick up the victory.
The Braves are now 28-5
overall and 15-2 in league play.
But the rest of the season may not
be as easy. In addition to the five
players lost to the varsity, the
Braves also lost the services of
RBL and stolen base leader Andy
Frank who will be out for the rest
of the season with a broken ankle.
The Braves return to action in a
doubleheader at Santa Clara on
Saturday.
