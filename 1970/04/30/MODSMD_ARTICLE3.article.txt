# US Troops Enter Cambodia As Asian War Policy Widens
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) - Thousands of
South Vietnamese troops, with
American advisers and air and
artillery support, thrust into
Cambodia yesterday, smashing
North Vietnamese camps on an
offensive that marked a drastic
change in White House policy.
In a brief communique that
gave virtually no details, the U.S.
Command in Saigon said that
"supplementary support to help

A University-wide strike has
been planned for this Friday in
order to protest the expansion of
the war into Cambodia. The
organizers of the strike called for
a mass meeting this evening in
Frost Ampitheater, immediately
following President Nixon's
speech.
In a statement issued early this
morning the strike-planners said,
"We cannot tolerate the war in
Southeast Asia. We will not
tolerate its expansion. No one
who witnessed the events of last
nights can allow action ten
thousand times more brutal to
begin in Cambodia or to continue
in Vietnam."

save the lives of free world forces
and to help accomplish Republic
of Vietnam armed forces
objectives was requested by the
government of Vietnam from U.S.
sources."
Amid strong congressional
criticism, President Nixon will

address the nation tonight on his
surprise decision to provide major
aid to a South Vietnamese thrust
into Cambodia.
U.S. Senators who have been
pressing for American
disengagement in Southeast Asia
expressed alarm. The Senate
majority leader, Mike Mansfield,
D-Mont., called the move "the
first step in the wrong direction."
South Vietnamese headquarters
said the operation began at 8 a.m.
yesterday in a drive into the
"Parrot's Beak" section of
Cambodia, 34 miles northwest of
Saigon.
Spokesmen said more than
5,000 South Vietnamese infantry
and ranger troops, and more than
100 armored personnel carriers
along with air and artillery strikes,
smashed 160 North Vietnamese
storage huts and 350 bunkers.
Cambodia Vote
In a test of congressional
reaction, the House scheduled a
vote today on an amendment by
Rep. Ogen Reid, R-N.Y.,
prohibiting the United States
from sending ground troops into
Cambodia.
A full-scale airing of the
administration's controversial
move appeared certain when the
Senate—and its Foreign Relations
Committee—came back after a
day's recess.
Nixon set his nationally
televised address for 9 p.m. EDT.
Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said the speech will relate to
Cambodia and U.S. forces in
Vietnam. Ziegler said a
Cambodian request for direct U.S.
arms aid remains under
consideration.
Washington Decisions
Members of both parties joined
in protest yesterday after the
decision was announced first in
Saigon, then in Washington by the
Pentagon, to provide advisers, air
support and other aid for the
South Vietnamese action.
Top Senate Democrats,

including Sens. Mike Mansfield,
Edward M. Kennedy, J.W.
Fulbright, Edmund S. Muskie, and
George S. McGovern, denounced
it as a move to widen the Vietnam
war.
Senior Republican members of
the Foreign Relations Committee
joined in. Sen. George D. Aiken of
Vermont, a veteran GOP leader,
cautioned the action might have
an "extremely bad" effect on
GOP political prospects in the
November elections.
Nixon Support
The chairmen of House and
Senate armed services committees.
Rep. L. Mendel Rivers, D-S.C.,
and Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss.,
backed the move. But Stennis
added he opposes massive military
aid to Cambodia.
Announcement of the new U.S.
move came during the Senate
recess and two days after a
near-unanimous Senate Foreign
Relations Committee strongly
opposed both American aid to the
new Cambodian government or
help for South Vietnamese action
against Communist forces in
Cambodia.
The decision also came ten days
after Nixon announced further
U.S. troop withdrawals from
Vietnam—and predicted, "We
finally have in sight the just peace
we are seeking."
Need For Proof
Noting this, Muskie told
newsmen "the burden is on him
to demonstrate convincingly there
has been such a change" since
then to warrant the new U.S.
action.
Mansfield called the decision to
send U.S. advisers into Cambodia
"the first step in the wrong
direction." Noting that Capitol
Hill was concerned and uneasy,
the Democratic leader added:
"This could now be called the
Indochinese war. What is
happening now is a whole new
ball game."
Senate Republican Leader
Hugh Scott refused to discuss the

action. Sen. Robert P. Griffin,
assistant GOP leader, personally
backed the move but he
acknowledged opposition among
his colleagues.
Foreign Relations Plans
Mansfield, Aiken and two
fellow Foreign Relations
members, Republican John
Sherman Cooper of Kentucky and
Democrat Frank Church of Idaho,
announced plans for an
amendment to pending military
sales legislation to ban aid to
Cambodia. This could come up as
early as next week.
Aiken, asked if he thought
Nixon had received the Foreign
Relations Committee's message,
said, "I think he got a stronger
message from somewhere else.
"I didn't think the President
would do what he is reported to
have done and I've never been so
disappointed in my life."
But the critics doubted whether
anything could be done short of

the unprecedented and unlikely
step of withholding military
appropriations.
McGovern and Sen. Mark O.
Hatfield, R-Ore., nevertheless
announced they will sponsor an
amendment to the military
procurement authorization bill
barring U.S. funds for Southeast
Asia, in the absence of a
declaration of war, except in
relation to withdrawal of U.S.
forces.
"After all the tragic lessons of
Vietnam," McGovern said, "it
seems a nightmare to me that our
leaders are actually committing us
to war in another Southeast Asian
country."
But Rivers said he saw no
reason not to back the move,
saying Cambodia long has been
used as a staging area for Vietnam.
Stennis echoed that statement,
adding "This could be a turning
point in the war to the good for
us."

SAIGON (AP) - Thousands of
South Vietnamese troops, with
American advisers and air and
artillery support, thrust into
Cambodia yesterday, smashing
North Vietnamese camps on an
offensive that marked a drastic
change in White House policy.
In a brief communique that
gave virtually no details, the U.S.
Command in Saigon said that

A University-wide strike has
been planned for this Friday in
order to protest the expansion of
the war into Cambodia. The
organizers of the strike called for
a mass meeting this evening in
Frost Ampitheater, immediately
following President Nixon's
speech.
In a statement issued early this
morning the strike-planners said,
"We cannot tolerate the war in
Southeast Asia. We will not
tolerate its expansion. No one
who witnessed the events of last
nights can allow action ten
thousand times more brutal to
begin in Cambodia or to continue
in Vietnam."

save the lives of free world forces
and to help accomplish Republic
of Vietnam armed forces
objectives was requested by the
government of Vietnam from U.S.
sources."
Amid strong congressional
criticism, President Nixon will

address the nation tonight on his
surprise decision to provide major
aid to a South Vietnamese thrust
into Cambodia.
U.S. Senators who have been
pressing for American
disengagement in Southeast Asia
expressed alarm. The Senate
majority leader, Mike Mansfield,
D-Mont., called the move "the
first step in the wrong direction."
South Vietnamese headquarters
said the operation began at 8 a.m.
yesterday in a drive into the
"Parrot's Beak" section of
Cambodia, 34 miles northwest of
Saigon.
Spokesmen said more than
5,000 South Vietnamese infantry
and ranger troops, and more than
100 armored personnel carriers
along with air and artillery strikes,
smashed 160 North Vietnamese
storage huts and 350 bunkers.
Cambodia Vote
In a test of congressional
reaction, the House scheduled a
vote today on an amendment by
Rep. Ogen Reid, R-N.Y.,
prohibiting the United States
from sending ground troops into
Cambodia.
A full-scale airing of the
administration's controversial
move appeared certain when the
Senate—and its Foreign Relations
Committee—came back after a
day's recess.
Nixon set his nationally
televised address for 9 p.m. EDT.
Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said the speech will relate to
Cambodia and U.S. forces in
Vietnam. Ziegler said a
Cambodian request for direct U.S.
arms aid remains under
consideration.
Washington Decisions
Members of both parties joined
in protest yesterday after the
decision was announced first in
Saigon, then in Washington by the
Pentagon, to provide advisers, air
support and other aid for the
South Vietnamese action.
Top Senate Democrats,

including Sens. Mike Mansfield,
Edward M. Kennedy, J.W.
Fulbright, Edmund S. Muskie, and
George S. McGovern, denounced
it as a move to widen the Vietnam
war.
Senior Republican members of
the Foreign Relations Committee
joined in. Sen. George D. Aiken of
Vermont, a veteran GOP leader,
cautioned the action might have
an "extremely bad" effect on
GOP political prospects in the
November elections.
Nixon Support
The chairmen of House and
Senate armed services committees.
Rep. L. Mendel Rivers, D-S.C.,
and Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss.,
backed the move. But Stennis
added he opposes massive military
aid to Cambodia.
Announcement of the new U.S.
move came during the Senate
recess and two days after a
near-unanimous Senate Foreign
Relations Committee strongly
opposed both American aid to the
new Cambodian government or
help for South Vietnamese action
against Communist forces in
Cambodia.
The decision also came ten days
after Nixon announced further
U.S. troop withdrawals from
Vietnam—and predicted, "We
finally have in sight the just peace
we are seeking."
Need For Proof
Noting this, Muskie told
newsmen "the burden is on him
to demonstrate convincingly there
has been such a change" since
then to warrant the new U.S.
action.
Mansfield called the decision to
send U.S. advisers into Cambodia
"the first step in the wrong
direction." Noting that Capitol
Hill was concerned and uneasy,
the Democratic leader added:
"This could now be called the
Indochinese war. What is
happening now is a whole new
ball game."
Senate Republican Leader
Hugh Scott refused to discuss the

action. Sen. Robert P. Griffin,
assistant GOP leader, personally
backed the move but he
acknowledged opposition among
his colleagues.
Foreign Relations Plans
Mansfield, Aiken and two
fellow Foreign Relations
members, Republican John
Sherman Cooper of Kentucky and
Democrat Frank Church of Idaho,
announced plans for an
amendment to pending military
sales legislation to ban aid to
Cambodia. This could come up as
early as next week.
Aiken, asked if he thought
Nixon had received the Foreign
Relations Committee's message,
said, "I think he got a stronger
message from somewhere else.
"I didn't think the President
would do what he is reported to
have done and I've never been so
disappointed in my life."
But the critics doubted whether
anything could be done short of

the unprecedented and unlikely
step of withholding military
appropriations.
McGovern and Sen. Mark O.
Hatfield, R-Ore., nevertheless
announced they will sponsor an
amendment to the military
procurement authorization bill
barring U.S. funds for Southeast
Asia, in the absence of a
declaration of war, except in
relation to withdrawal of U.S.
forces.
"After all the tragic lessons of
Vietnam," McGovern said, "it
seems a nightmare to me that our
leaders are actually committing us
to war in another Southeast Asian
country."
But Rivers said he saw no
reason not to back the move,
saying Cambodia long has been
used as a staging area for Vietnam.
Stennis echoed that statement,
adding "This could be a turning
point in the war to the good for
us."

"After all the tragic lessons of
Vietnam," McGovern said, "it

But Rivers said he saw no

used as a staging area for Vietnam.
Stennis echoed that statement,
adding "This could be a turning

SAIGON (AP) - Thousands of
South Vietnamese troops, with
American advisers and air and
artillery support, thrust into
Cambodia yesterday, smashing
North Vietnamese camps on an
offensive that marked a drastic
change in White House policy.
In a brief communique that
gave virtually no details, the U.S.
Command in Saigon said that
"supplementary support to help

A University-wide strike has
been planned for this Friday in
order to protest the expansion of
the war into Cambodia. The
organizers of the strike called for
a mass meeting this evening in
Frost Ampitheater, immediately
following President Nixon's
speech.
In a statement issued early this
morning the strike-planners said,
"We cannot tolerate the war in
Southeast Asia. We will not
tolerate its expansion. No one
who witnessed the events of last
nights can allow action ten
thousand times more brutal to
begin in Cambodia or to continue
in Vietnam."

save the lives of free world forces
and to help accomplish Republic
of Vietnam armed forces
objectives was requested by the
government of Vietnam from U.S.
sources."
Amid strong congressional
criticism, President Nixon will

address the nation tonight on his
surprise decision to provide major
aid to a South Vietnamese thrust
into Cambodia.
U.S. Senators who have been
pressing for American
disengagement in Southeast Asia
expressed alarm. The Senate
majority leader, Mike Mansfield,
D-Mont., called the move "the
first step in the wrong direction."
South Vietnamese headquarters
said the operation began at 8 a.m.
yesterday in a drive into the
"Parrot's Beak" section of
Cambodia, 34 miles northwest of
Saigon.
Spokesmen said more than
5,000 South Vietnamese infantry
and ranger troops, and more than
100 armored personnel carriers
along with air and artillery strikes,
smashed 160 North Vietnamese
storage huts and 350 bunkers.
Cambodia Vote
In a test of congressional
reaction, the House scheduled a
vote today on an amendment by
Rep. Ogen Reid, R-N.Y.,
prohibiting the United States
from sending ground troops into
Cambodia.
A full-scale airing of the
administration's controversial
move appeared certain when the
Senate—and its Foreign Relations
Committee—came back after a
day's recess.
Nixon set his nationally
televised address for 9 p.m. EDT.
Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said the speech will relate to
Cambodia and U.S. forces in
Vietnam. Ziegler said a
Cambodian request for direct U.S.
arms aid remains under
consideration.
Washington Decisions
Members of both parties joined
in protest yesterday after the
decision was announced first in
Saigon, then in Washington by the
Pentagon, to provide advisers, air
support and other aid for the
South Vietnamese action.
Top Senate Democrats,

including Sens. Mike Mansfield,
Edward M. Kennedy, J.W.
Fulbright, Edmund S. Muskie, and
George S. McGovern, denounced
it as a move to widen the Vietnam
war.
Senior Republican members of
the Foreign Relations Committee
joined in. Sen. George D. Aiken of
Vermont, a veteran GOP leader,
cautioned the action might have
an "extremely bad" effect on
GOP political prospects in the
November elections.
Nixon Support
The chairmen of House and
Senate armed services committees.
Rep. L. Mendel Rivers, D-S.C.,
and Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss.,
backed the move. But Stennis
added he opposes massive military
aid to Cambodia.
Announcement of the new U.S.
move came during the Senate
recess and two days after a
near-unanimous Senate Foreign
Relations Committee strongly
opposed both American aid to the
new Cambodian government or
help for South Vietnamese action
against Communist forces in
Cambodia.
The decision also came ten days
after Nixon announced further
U.S. troop withdrawals from
Vietnam—and predicted, "We
finally have in sight the just peace
we are seeking."
Need For Proof
Noting this, Muskie told
newsmen "the burden is on him
to demonstrate convincingly there
has been such a change" since
then to warrant the new U.S.
action.
Mansfield called the decision to
send U.S. advisers into Cambodia
"the first step in the wrong
direction." Noting that Capitol
Hill was concerned and uneasy,
the Democratic leader added:
"This could now be called the
Indochinese war. What is
happening now is a whole new
ball game."
Senate Republican Leader
Hugh Scott refused to discuss the

action. Sen. Robert P. Griffin,
assistant GOP leader, personally
backed the move but he
acknowledged opposition among
his colleagues.
Foreign Relations Plans
Mansfield, Aiken and two
fellow Foreign Relations
members, Republican John
Sherman Cooper of Kentucky and
Democrat Frank Church of Idaho,
announced plans for an
amendment to pending military
sales legislation to ban aid to
Cambodia. This could come up as
early as next week.
Aiken, asked if he thought
Nixon had received the Foreign
Relations Committee's message,
said, "I think he got a stronger
message from somewhere else.
"I didn't think the President
would do what he is reported to
have done and I've never been so
disappointed in my life."
But the critics doubted whether
anything could be done short of

the unprecedented and unlikely
step of withholding military
appropriations.
McGovern and Sen. Mark O.
Hatfield, R-Ore., nevertheless
announced they will sponsor an
amendment to the military
procurement authorization bill
barring U.S. funds for Southeast
Asia, in the absence of a
declaration of war, except in
relation to withdrawal of U.S.
forces.
"After all the tragic lessons of
Vietnam," McGovern said, "it
seems a nightmare to me that our
leaders are actually committing us
to war in another Southeast Asian
country."
But Rivers said he saw no
reason not to back the move,
saying Cambodia long has been
