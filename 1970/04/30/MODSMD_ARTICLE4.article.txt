# Pitzer: Cambodia
## 
### 
Emphasizing that his statement
was "purely personal", President
Pitzer last night called Nixon's
decision to send aid to Cambodia"
a mistake of the gravest kind."
The statement reached th>
Daily office at about 9 p.m., after
police had entered the Old Union
Building. It reinforces a similar
statement made by Provost
Lyman earlier yesterday evening
during a news conference on
KZSU. The text reads as follows:
In fairness I think we should
wait until the President's
statement before we make a final
judgment. However, if he
confirms today's report that the
United States is extending its
Southeast Asian involvement to
include Cambodia — and I
fervently hope he does not —
then I personally regard this as a

mistake of the gravest kind. Our
experience in Vietnam has been
disastrous enough; surely we
should not extend it to Cambodia.
No thoughtful American can fail
to realize the severe damage to
our entire national fabric caused
by our continued effort to fight a
war about which the nation is, at
best, ambiguous and which most
college students believe immoral.
This action can only deepen the
already serious gulf between the
Federal Government and many
citizens, especially but not only
the young. An action of this kind,
which I personally find impossible
to support, makes it more
difficult to defend the
Government on other matters of
national policy. I want to
emphasize again that this is a
personal statement, but one which
is sincerely and deeply held.
