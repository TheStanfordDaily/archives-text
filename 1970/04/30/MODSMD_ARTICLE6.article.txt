# Two Wars
## 
### 
In many ways, war came home to Stanford yesterday.
It came in two stages and on two levels. It first crept in
as a great depression, with news that US troops had
crossed into Cambodia, justified by the bureaucratic
fantasy of helping "only Vietnamese." With that
announcement, the last desperate hope of the 1960's
anti-war movement-that at least it wouldn't happen
again—crashed in our minds.
War came again last night-as hatred and frustration
spilled out in rock-throwing and police clubbing. The long
anticipated major confrontation finally broke across
campus, bringing the exhiliration of action for some-for
others, the despair that comes when anger and frustration
turn men against each other. Many were simply afraid and
confused, surging behind the action lines or stumbling
home. The emotions of conflict-of battle-loomed last
night like they never have at Stanford.
At this point, we cannot objectify them or evaluate
them. We can only feel them. We are stunned and repulsed
by the polarization which makes it possible to attack a
man because he wears a uniform, or beat a student who
stands alone amid police. Yet we, like those who threw the
rocks, are overcome with alienation and despair at the
Presidents who never listen and the nation that never
learns.
