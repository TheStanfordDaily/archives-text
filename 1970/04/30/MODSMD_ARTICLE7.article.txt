## ROTC And Rubin 
### 
Pauling Speech
Editor, THE DAILY:
Professor Pauling in his
Tuesday address expressed his
views on the ROTC issue. I was
disappointed at the way the Daily
reported these views. One point of
particular importance to me,
which was treated much too
lightly in the Daily's report, was
Professor Pauling's position with
respect to violence. The quote in
the Daily seems to indicate a
pragmatic approach to the
question of violence, while I think
that Prof. Pauling tried to convey
a much stronger feeling of
non-violence as a basic moral
principle.
As I understood him, while
being in favor of peaceful protest
to express anti-ROTC feelings, he
was emphatic about his position
that if the protest becomes violent
it is defeating its very purpose. I
think that this is a point that has
to be driven home to the members
of the university and outsiders
who participate in the
demonstrations.
1 urge you to publish the full
content of Professor Pauling's
speech. I also urge you to
emphasize in your editorials and
comments that violence and
destruction only clouds the issue,
making the protestors as quilty as
-ihe violence and domination they
want to stop in other parts of the
world.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Every person who physically
OR MENTALLY applauded Jerry
Rubin's demand that books be
burned has, by virtue of his
applause, given support to such an
action as was taken at the Center
for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences.
The law quite properly
distinguishes between acting and
wishful-thinking, but in principle,
every hand that clapped or mind
that cheered in response to the
advocacy of book-burning set fire
to the Center.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I anxiously await next year's
"undergraduate specials" under
President Pitzer's progressive and
enlightened criteria of 'academic
feasibility'; we can now look
forward to such long-awaited
courses as "Construction of
Home-Made Explosives" and
perhaps "The Techniques of
Physical Torture."
And it was nostalgic, Provost
Rosenzweig, to read your article
about the university and"The
Idea," but your concern for the
'fragile processes,' is, I fear, a bit
late. So sad for us all that the pure
and promising virgin was indeed a
reamed-out whore.

Behavioral Sciences.
The law quite properly
distinguishes between acting and
wishful-thinking, but in principle,
every hand that clapped or mind
that cheered in response to the
advocacy of book-burning set fire
to the Center.

Pitzer Progressive?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I anxiously await next year's
"undergraduate specials" under
President Pitzer's progressive and
enlightened criteria of 'academic
feasibility'; we can now look
forward to such long-awaited
courses as "Construction of
Home-Made Explosives" and
perhaps "The Techniques of
Physical Torture."
And it was nostalgic, Provost
Rosenzweig, to read your article
about the university and"The
Idea," but your concern for the
'fragile processes,' is, I fear, a bit
late. So sad for us all that the pure
and promising virgin was indeed a
reamed-out whore.

Pauling Speech
Editor, THE DAILY:
Professor Pauling in his
Tuesday address expressed his
views on the ROTC issue. I was
disappointed at the way the Daily
reported these views. One point of
particular importance to me,
which was treated much too
lightly in the Daily's report, was
Professor Pauling's position with
respect to violence. The quote in
the Daily seems to indicate a
pragmatic approach to the
question of violence, while I think
that Prof. Pauling tried to convey
a much stronger feeling of
non-violence as a basic moral
principle.
As I understood him, while
being in favor of peaceful protest
to express anti-ROTC feelings, he
was emphatic about his position
that if the protest becomes violent
it is defeating its very purpose. I
think that this is a point that has
to be driven home to the members
of the university and outsiders
who participate in the
demonstrations.
1 urge you to publish the full
content of Professor Pauling's
speech. I also urge you to
emphasize in your editorials and
comments that violence and
destruction only clouds the issue,
making the protestors as quilty as
-ihe violence and domination they
want to stop in other parts of the
world.

Every person who physically
OR MENTALLY applauded Jerry
Rubin's demand that books be
burned has, by virtue of his
applause, given support to such an
action as was taken at the Center
for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences.
The law quite properly
distinguishes between acting and
wishful-thinking, but in principle,
every hand that clapped or mind
that cheered in response to the
advocacy of book-burning set fire
