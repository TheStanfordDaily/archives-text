# Horatio Alger
## The 						Slave Economy 
### Barry Wood 
The development of economic
individualism in the past three or
four centruies, contrary to belief,
has not made men free but
enslaved them. Thy mythology of
private enterprise claims that we
can all become a proverbial
Horatio Alger. But, in reality, our
economic system allows us to
become exploiters or, if we are
not so lucky, exploited.
In the middle ages men were
owned, body and soul, by their
feudal lords. When the rising
merchant class allowed men to
become owners of themselves it
was hailed as a new liberation
from slavery. But what
self-ownership means is that we
have to sell ourselves and our
work, meaning that we can be
bought and sold by the financial
captains of industry.
Thus the rich buy and sell the
poor and the rich nations
manipulate the Third World—not
because the Third World is made
up of people, but because it is
made of resources to buy and land
to loot.
The crisis of ecology and
survival is therefore a crisis for the
survival of the poor whites, the
poorer blacks, the uneducated,
the undeveloped, and—most
importantly—our children, who
do not have the capital to fight
back.
Guns And Liberation
Every tax dollar signifies
• ncreased governmental power
which is immediately turned into
American guns and tanks for the
"liberation" of distant lands.
O -"-consuming nations have the
mo ', Southeast Asia has
res-j; *s which we lack. And so
Ae " v out" Vietnam with
money we can loot her of her
goods ' the name of "economic
dicL"
.Aery rally on the stock
market is a signal that someone
somewhere has more power to
exploit. Every new million made
by GM signifies new power to
drain oil out of Peru of the
Mid-East, or steel from some yet
undiscovered vein in the Third
World. Economics rules us all,
democrats and communists alike.
How else can we interpret Russia's
request for help from Ford
motors? Even political differences
must bow before economic
power.

The most unfortunate event in
the past 200 years was the
invention of American democracy
at the same time as the private
enterprise free market economy
was just getting into swing.
Democracy is the greatest political
experiment yet launched by men.
Capitalism is the most exploitive
economic system yet invented.
The two are not the same, but
have been confused in America.
Paeons Of Praise
Thus, in the name of
democracy, we shout paeons of
praise for the right of every man
to make his own fortune, the
right, that is, to consume more
than he can spend and deprive
those who have yet no economic
power. We laud American
democracy because of a huge GNP
whereas in fact our huge capital
resources signify a real end to
democracy.
America is like a huge octopus,
spreading out her economic arms
in a crush that bodes disaster for
the whole world. The only
"freedom" we recognize is the
freedom of buying out someone
else. The only weapon we offer is
that of joining our economic
system to become one of the
exploiters.
Thus environmental problems
fuse with economic exploitation,
and racism is part of the hidden
lie that keeps the Big Spenders on
the top. The ideology of
vandalism is that ideology which
underlies the exploitation of
nature for resources and the
exploitation of other men for the
economic riches their "cheap"
labor can bring.
Man Ahead of Money
If we are to save the world we
must somehow put man ahead of
money, people ahead of political
boundaries, and the riches of the
Good Earth ahead of Wall Street.
To fail in this is to see our
country torn apart by racial strife,
destroyed by the looting of the
whole countryside, and deprived
of a liveable support system.
A counter-culture is growing
up in our midst, a counter-culture
made up of New Left and hippies,
the black militants and the
environmentalists, and fused
together by millions of students
who have nothing to lose by
saving the earth, and everything to

gain. Earth Day is the beginning
of a vast movement in which the
fragmented issues of campus
disorder over the past few years
will find a common theme in the
task of building a New Home for
humanity.

manipulate the Third World—not
because the Third World is made
up of people, but because it is
made of resources to buy and land
to loot.
The crisis of ecology and
survival is therefore a crisis for the
survival of the poor whites, the
poorer blacks, the uneducated,
the undeveloped, and—most
importantly—our children, who
do not have the capital to fight
back.
Guns And Liberation
Every tax dollar signifies
• ncreased governmental power
which is immediately turned into
American guns and tanks for the
"liberation" of distant lands.

.Aery rally on the stock
market is a signal that someone
somewhere has more power to
exploit. Every new million made
by GM signifies new power to
drain oil out of Peru of the
Mid-East, or steel from some yet
undiscovered vein in the Third
World. Economics rules us all,
democrats and communists alike.
How else can we interpret Russia's
request for help from Ford
motors? Even political differences
must bow before economic
power.

The most unfortunate event in
the past 200 years was the
invention of American democracy
at the same time as the private
enterprise free market economy
was just getting into swing.
Democracy is the greatest political
experiment yet launched by men.
Capitalism is the most exploitive
economic system yet invented.
The two are not the same, but
have been confused in America.
Paeons Of Praise
Thus, in the name of
democracy, we shout paeons of
praise for the right of every man
to make his own fortune, the
right, that is, to consume more
than he can spend and deprive
those who have yet no economic
power. We laud American
democracy because of a huge GNP
whereas in fact our huge capital
resources signify a real end to
democracy.
America is like a huge octopus,
spreading out her economic arms
in a crush that bodes disaster for
the whole world. The only
"freedom" we recognize is the
freedom of buying out someone
else. The only weapon we offer is
that of joining our economic
system to become one of the
exploiters.
Thus environmental problems
fuse with economic exploitation,
and racism is part of the hidden
lie that keeps the Big Spenders on
the top. The ideology of
vandalism is that ideology which
underlies the exploitation of
nature for resources and the
exploitation of other men for the
economic riches their "cheap"
labor can bring.
Man Ahead of Money
If we are to save the world we
must somehow put man ahead of
money, people ahead of political
boundaries, and the riches of the
Good Earth ahead of Wall Street.
To fail in this is to see our
country torn apart by racial strife,
destroyed by the looting of the
whole countryside, and deprived
of a liveable support system.
A counter-culture is growing
up in our midst, a counter-culture
made up of New Left and hippies,
the black militants and the
environmentalists, and fused
together by millions of students
who have nothing to lose by
saving the earth, and everything to

gain. Earth Day is the beginning
of a vast movement in which the
fragmented issues of campus
disorder over the past few years
will find a common theme in the
task of building a New Home for
humanity.

The development of economic
individualism in the past three or
four centruies, contrary to belief,
has not made men free but
enslaved them. Thy mythology of
private enterprise claims that we
can all become a proverbial
Horatio Alger. But, in reality, our
economic system allows us to
become exploiters or, if we are
not so lucky, exploited.
In the middle ages men were
owned, body and soul, by their
feudal lords. When the rising
merchant class allowed men to
become owners of themselves it
was hailed as a new liberation
from slavery. But what
self-ownership means is that we
have to sell ourselves and our
work, meaning that we can be
bought and sold by the financial
captains of industry.
Thus the rich buy and sell the
poor and the rich nations
manipulate the Third World—not
