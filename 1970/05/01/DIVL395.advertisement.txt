I â€”
I LAST NIGHT 800 PEOPLE WERE CHASED AROUND WHITE PLAZA BY THE POLICE. I
I NOT MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING IN THE I
I ROCK AND BOTTLE THROWING,. OR APPARENTLY EVEN SYMPATHIZED WITH IT. I
I THE OTHER 500 PEOPLE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE. I
I INNOCENT BYSTANDERS DO NOT EXIST IN THIS SITUATION. EXCEPTING OFFI- I
I CIALLY DESIGNATED OBSERVERS, EVERY PERSON WHO WAS "JUST TAKING A I
I LOOK" LAST NIGHT BOLSTERED THE RANKS OF THOSE WHO ENGAGED IN VIO- I
I LENCE BY HAMPERING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICE. I
I BY "CHECKING OUT THE ACTION," YOU BECOME PART OF THAT ACTION AND I
I EFFECTIVELY LEND YOUR ENDORSEMENT TO EVERY BROKEN WINDOW, EVERY I
I DEMENTED SCRAWL AND EVERY FIRE BOMB. I
I IF YOU ARE NOT A PARTICIPANT, STAY OFF THE BATTLEFIELD. THE FEWER THE I
I PEOPLE PRESENT, THE SMALLER THE CHANCES ARE OF PERSONAL INJURIES, CON- I
I FUSION, AND OTHER UNDESIRABLE EVENTS. I
