That's the liberating thought in this post-
McLuhan bombshell of a book by 29-year
old Stanford instructor Barry Wood. A poetic
synthesis of Eastern mysticism and modern
physics, it points the way to wholeness and
freedom in a philosophy of be-ing, and
celebrates the joyous mystery underlying all
the religions of the world. Barry Wood uses
a theory of linguistics to show how Western
man's thinking has been crippled by his
language structures, and defines reality —
not as a collection of distinct beings and
objects—but as an eternally creative flux,
the go-go dance of all time, a magnificent
frolic. Alan Watts calls the book "ingenious
and delightful."
