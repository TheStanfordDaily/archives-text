# Pitzer Asks ROTC Reappraisal; Violent Street Fighting Continues
## Windows Smashed In Night Rampage 
### 
On the eve of a planned
student strike, anti-ROTC
demonstrators staged a second
round of street fighting with
police.
The battle raged across most of
the central campus for four hours.
Numerous scuffles and
fistfights also occurred as some
students attempted to restrain
demonstrators. Several times,
members of the non-violent group
placed themselves between
demonstrators and police in an
effort to ease tensions.
The demonstrators, whose
numbers raged from 350 to well
over a thousand, were tear gassed
repeatedly by the 225 Peninsula
police.
One person was arrested, and
at least 15 people were injured by
the fusilade of rocks, bricks,
bottles, and clubs.
Medics on the scene cared for
many injured demonstrators,
while 12 students were treated at
Cowell. Two were held overnight
for observation. Another three
persons were admitted to
Stanford Hospital emergency
room, two of them policemen.
Unprecedented Damage
One policeman reportedly
suffered a broken leg when hit by
a rock near Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and was removed in
an ambulance.
Damage to buildings was
unprecedented. At least 15
buildings were hit, with Encina
Hall, the ROTC building, the
Bookstore, the Post Office, and
Engineering Corner suffering
extremely heavy damage.
One car was set afire, and a
number of police cars, including
an ambulance, were stoned.
Streetlights across the campus
were smashed, and at least 20
false fire alarms were turned in.
Nonviolent Rally
Windows were smashed in the
Graduate School of Business as
the Faculty Senate met, and rocks
were thrown at the homes of
Provost Richard Lyman and
Provost Emeritus Fred Terman.
The violence came in the wake
of a rally in Frost Ampitheater,
sponsored by students and faculty
seeking a nonviolent response to
President Nixon's Cambodian
policy. Another meeting of
militant students slated for the
Old Union was cancelled, as most
of the militants joined the
meeting in Frost. [See related
story, this page.)
Leaving the meeting at 10
p.m., over 1000 demonstrators
massed in front of the ROTC

The Non-Violent Group will
meet this afternoon at 3 p.m. in
the Manzanita Park lounge. Plans
to forstall police and student
violence will be discussed. The
Group urges students to go to
either the Aero & Astro, Business
School or ROTC buildings today
to try and stop people from
carrying on normal activities.

building near the ampitheater.
Several windows were broken, and
the crowd moved on to Encina
Hall.

Non-violent Efforts

As demonstrators covered the
lawn in front of Encina, about 20
persons rushed forward, breaking
at least two of the front doors.
Several protestors shouted to
break in and destroy the building,
but before the crowd could move,
police, in squad cars, drove by.
Within two minutes of the first
attack on the building, police
arrived in force. As demonstrators
moved into the street, a group of
non-violent students formed a line
between them and the police.
They eventually sat down on the
front lawn and chanted, "Off
ROTC, No Rocks" and "Strike
tomorrow, Peace tonight."
Sgt. Donald Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department then declared the
crowd an illegal assembly as
rock-throwing protestors smashed
windows at the Lou Henry
Hoover building and Encina.
Rocks aimed at police were
thrown over the non-violent
group.
Police Busses
Several busloads of police
forming a line in front of Encina
told the crowd to disperse and
asked the sitting students to move
across the street.

At this time, the crowd still
numbered about 1000. Of these,
about half watched as rock
throwing continued and the
non-violent group held its ground.
Most of the violent
demonstrators then headed
towards White Plaza. By 10:30
p.m., the police reboarded busses
and proceeded to other parts of
campus, leaving the non-violent
group in front of Encina.
Confrontation
The militant protestors
gathered in front of the
Undergraduate Library. Smaller
militant groups penetrated into
the plaza, and were repulsed by
police.
By 10:45, both the violent and
non-violent groups had regrouped
between the Undergraduate
Library and the Bookstore. Small
teams of the non-violent
demonstrators tried to assemble
between the police and the
militants, but met little success.
The police reformed, moving
on the crowd. Three cannisters of
tear gas were thrown, and the
crowd headed toward Encina once
more.
Observers Harassed
Profs. Foulkes and Lohner,
both from the German dept., were
on campus as faculty observers
and urging students to non-violent
tactics. About 10:50, they were
walking across White Plaza to
their car when confronted by
about 20 police.
They identified themselves as
two of the many faculty observers
present but one policeman told
them to move on then took his
stick and hit them. Lohner caught
"a glancing blow" while Foulkes
was hit hard in the arm and
kidney and pushed in the neck.
They were then forced to run in
the direction of the rock-throwing
action.
At 11 p.m. 200 members of
the non-violent group, with linked
arms, formed a line in front of
Encina, and held off an equal
number of militants. About 20
policemen standing in front

BAD FOR BUSlNESS—Protesting students move around the (Graduate School of Business during last night's
demonstration. Windows were broken in the building, where a Faculty Senate meeting was in progress. The Business
School has Irequently been a target ol the ol'f-ROTC demonstrators and has suffered heavy damage in past weeks.
the ROTC issue." Patrick A. Shea,
former member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, said that
the "deadlock I have seen has
been broken in a very decent
manner." He added that the
Senate "focused on the issue, not
the tactics."
Rational Device
According to the two faculty
members, referring the issue back
to the committee "is a rational
device for getting the issues back
to the Senate in a well-ordered
form." Bach added that the
"Senate was not prepared to solve
one issue"—the continuance or
non-continuance of ROTC at
Stanford because there are a lot of
different issues involved.
They mentioned that such
issues as punitive clause problems,
negotiations between other
universities and the Defense
Department on ROTC, the status
of the Navy and Air Force ROTC
programs, and the student
referendum that will be
considered by the committee.
As mentioned in yesterday's
Daily, the Advisory Committee on
ROTC is holding open hearings on
the punitive clauses, and possibly
other issues, on May 11. Any
interested person who wishes to
contribute testimony can contact
the committee.
Hal Mickelson, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, said
the Senate agreed with Pitzer's
proposal because of the new
information that has become
available since the Senate last met.
Negative Effect
Speaking as an individual, Bach
denied that the anti-ROTC

campus violence of the last few
nights forced him to favor the
President's action. "It had a
negative effect on me but I'm sure
some members (of the Senate)
were in favor of giving in" because
of the violence. Pat A. Shea
added, "If the violence continues,
it will deter any further action (on
ROTC) by the University."
Pitzer also recommended that
any vacancies on the Advisory
Committee bi> filled immediately
and said that any recommen
dations that the committee makes
"will be presented to the Senate
for its consideration before I
make final agreements on behalf
of the University."
The Senate also asked Pitzer to
"act in concert" with other
universities with respect to ROTC
and declared that all decisions by
the CUS regarding course credit
for ROTC will be postponed until
the Advisory Committee reports
back to the Senate.
The "extraordinary action" of
sending a delegation to
Washington, D.C. to talk to
legislators to convey with
"urgency" the University views of
unresolved problems was passed
unanimously. Funds for the trip
will be raised by voluntary
donations; many members of the
Senate indicated privately that if
they were chosen to go they
would pay their own way.
The delegation will be
composed of the President or
Provost, representatives of the
trustees, the vice President for
Financial Affairs, about 20
members of the faculty Senate,
past and present members of the
Council of Presidents of the ASSU
and up to five students chosen by

V—--'
the Student Senate committee on
nominations.
The document authorizing this
delegation declares that issues
"giving rise" to campus
eonfrontations "are largely the
local manifestations of unresolved
problems which face us on the
national level—Vietnam and now
Cambodia, racial tensions, and
mounting problems in our cities."
It also declared that "the
decision-making machinery within
our nation is ceasing to appear
legitimate and voices raised in
urgent appeal seem to be
unheard."
Below are the text of the
resolutions passed by the Senate
and part of Pitzer's statement.
Following are resolutions adopted
by the Faculty Senate at Stanford
ROTC
(passed with scattered dissent)
Several recent developments call for
further consideration of the ROTC
negotiations, here and elsewhere: 1)
President Nixon's recommendations to
Congress for major changes in draft
deferment patterns; 2) the recent
student referendum at Stanford on
continuance of ROTC and credit for
ROTC; and 3) the American entry into
Cambodia. Therefore:
1. The Senate of the Academic
Council wishes to associate itself
with President Pitzer in his
proposals to return the ROTC
question to the Advisory
Committee on ROTC for further
consideration, in the light of the
above developments.
2. The Senate asks President Pitzer
to attempt to act in concern with
the presidents of other universities
with respect to ROTC and related
issues, and to keep the Committee
apprised of the views and actions of
other universities.
3. All decisions by the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies regarding
course credit for ROTC shall be
postponed, pending the report to
the Senate from the Advisory
Committee on ROTC.

the central campus for four hours.
Numerous scuffles and
fistfights also occurred as some
students attempted to restrain
demonstrators. Several times,
members of the non-violent group
placed themselves between
demonstrators and police in an
effort to ease tensions.
The demonstrators, whose
numbers raged from 350 to well
over a thousand, were tear gassed
repeatedly by the 225 Peninsula
police.
One person was arrested, and
at least 15 people were injured by
the fusilade of rocks, bricks,
bottles, and clubs.
Medics on the scene cared for
many injured demonstrators,
while 12 students were treated at
Cowell. Two were held overnight
for observation. Another three
persons were admitted to
Stanford Hospital emergency
room, two of them policemen.
Unprecedented Damage
One policeman reportedly
suffered a broken leg when hit by
a rock near Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and was removed in
an ambulance.
Damage to buildings was
unprecedented. At least 15
buildings were hit, with Encina
Hall, the ROTC building, the
Bookstore, the Post Office, and
Engineering Corner suffering
extremely heavy damage.
One car was set afire, and a
number of police cars, including
an ambulance, were stoned.
Streetlights across the campus
were smashed, and at least 20
false fire alarms were turned in.
Nonviolent Rally
Windows were smashed in the
Graduate School of Business as
the Faculty Senate met, and rocks
were thrown at the homes of
Provost Richard Lyman and
Provost Emeritus Fred Terman.
The violence came in the wake
of a rally in Frost Ampitheater,
sponsored by students and faculty
seeking a nonviolent response to
President Nixon's Cambodian
policy. Another meeting of
militant students slated for the
Old Union was cancelled, as most
of the militants joined the
meeting in Frost. [See related
story, this page.)
Leaving the meeting at 10
p.m., over 1000 demonstrators
massed in front of the ROTC

The Non-Violent Group will
meet this afternoon at 3 p.m. in
the Manzanita Park lounge. Plans
to forstall police and student
violence will be discussed. The
Group urges students to go to
either the Aero & Astro, Business
School or ROTC buildings today
to try and stop people from
carrying on normal activities.

building near the ampitheater.
Several windows were broken, and
the crowd moved on to Encina
Hall.

Non-violent Efforts

As demonstrators covered the
lawn in front of Encina, about 20
persons rushed forward, breaking
at least two of the front doors.
Several protestors shouted to
break in and destroy the building,
but before the crowd could move,
police, in squad cars, drove by.
Within two minutes of the first
attack on the building, police
arrived in force. As demonstrators
moved into the street, a group of
non-violent students formed a line
between them and the police.
They eventually sat down on the
front lawn and chanted, "Off
ROTC, No Rocks" and "Strike
tomorrow, Peace tonight."
Sgt. Donald Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department then declared the
crowd an illegal assembly as
rock-throwing protestors smashed
windows at the Lou Henry
Hoover building and Encina.
Rocks aimed at police were
thrown over the non-violent
group.
Police Busses
Several busloads of police
forming a line in front of Encina
told the crowd to disperse and
asked the sitting students to move
across the street.

At this time, the crowd still
numbered about 1000. Of these,
about half watched as rock
throwing continued and the
non-violent group held its ground.
Most of the violent
demonstrators then headed
towards White Plaza. By 10:30
p.m., the police reboarded busses
and proceeded to other parts of
campus, leaving the non-violent
group in front of Encina.
Confrontation
The militant protestors
gathered in front of the
Undergraduate Library. Smaller
militant groups penetrated into
the plaza, and were repulsed by
police.
By 10:45, both the violent and
non-violent groups had regrouped
between the Undergraduate
Library and the Bookstore. Small
teams of the non-violent
demonstrators tried to assemble
between the police and the
militants, but met little success.
The police reformed, moving
on the crowd. Three cannisters of
tear gas were thrown, and the
crowd headed toward Encina once
more.
Observers Harassed
Profs. Foulkes and Lohner,
both from the German dept., were
on campus as faculty observers
and urging students to non-violent
tactics. About 10:50, they were
walking across White Plaza to
their car when confronted by
about 20 police.
They identified themselves as
two of the many faculty observers
present but one policeman told
them to move on then took his
stick and hit them. Lohner caught
"a glancing blow" while Foulkes
was hit hard in the arm and
kidney and pushed in the neck.
They were then forced to run in
the direction of the rock-throwing
action.
At 11 p.m. 200 members of
the non-violent group, with linked
arms, formed a line in front of
Encina, and held off an equal
number of militants. About 20
policemen standing in front

BAD FOR BUSlNESS—Protesting students move around the (Graduate School of Business during last night's
demonstration. Windows were broken in the building, where a Faculty Senate meeting was in progress. The Business
School has Irequently been a target ol the ol'f-ROTC demonstrators and has suffered heavy damage in past weeks.
the ROTC issue." Patrick A. Shea,
former member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, said that
the "deadlock I have seen has
been broken in a very decent
manner." He added that the
Senate "focused on the issue, not
the tactics."
Rational Device
According to the two faculty
members, referring the issue back
to the committee "is a rational
device for getting the issues back
to the Senate in a well-ordered
form." Bach added that the
"Senate was not prepared to solve
one issue"—the continuance or
non-continuance of ROTC at
Stanford because there are a lot of
different issues involved.
They mentioned that such
issues as punitive clause problems,
negotiations between other
universities and the Defense
Department on ROTC, the status
of the Navy and Air Force ROTC
programs, and the student
referendum that will be
considered by the committee.
As mentioned in yesterday's
Daily, the Advisory Committee on
ROTC is holding open hearings on
the punitive clauses, and possibly
other issues, on May 11. Any
interested person who wishes to
contribute testimony can contact
the committee.
Hal Mickelson, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, said
the Senate agreed with Pitzer's
proposal because of the new
information that has become
available since the Senate last met.
Negative Effect
Speaking as an individual, Bach
denied that the anti-ROTC

campus violence of the last few
nights forced him to favor the
President's action. "It had a
negative effect on me but I'm sure
some members (of the Senate)
were in favor of giving in" because
of the violence. Pat A. Shea
added, "If the violence continues,
it will deter any further action (on
ROTC) by the University."
Pitzer also recommended that
any vacancies on the Advisory
Committee bi> filled immediately
and said that any recommen
dations that the committee makes
"will be presented to the Senate
for its consideration before I
make final agreements on behalf
of the University."
The Senate also asked Pitzer to
"act in concert" with other
universities with respect to ROTC
and declared that all decisions by
the CUS regarding course credit
for ROTC will be postponed until
the Advisory Committee reports
back to the Senate.
The "extraordinary action" of
sending a delegation to
Washington, D.C. to talk to
legislators to convey with
"urgency" the University views of
unresolved problems was passed
unanimously. Funds for the trip
will be raised by voluntary
donations; many members of the
Senate indicated privately that if
they were chosen to go they
would pay their own way.
The delegation will be
composed of the President or
Provost, representatives of the
trustees, the vice President for
Financial Affairs, about 20
members of the faculty Senate,
past and present members of the
Council of Presidents of the ASSU
and up to five students chosen by

V—--'
the Student Senate committee on
nominations.
The document authorizing this
delegation declares that issues
"giving rise" to campus
eonfrontations "are largely the
local manifestations of unresolved
problems which face us on the
national level—Vietnam and now
Cambodia, racial tensions, and
mounting problems in our cities."
It also declared that "the
decision-making machinery within
our nation is ceasing to appear
legitimate and voices raised in
urgent appeal seem to be
unheard."
Below are the text of the
resolutions passed by the Senate
and part of Pitzer's statement.
Following are resolutions adopted
by the Faculty Senate at Stanford
ROTC
(passed with scattered dissent)
Several recent developments call for
further consideration of the ROTC
negotiations, here and elsewhere: 1)
President Nixon's recommendations to
Congress for major changes in draft
deferment patterns; 2) the recent
student referendum at Stanford on
continuance of ROTC and credit for
ROTC; and 3) the American entry into
Cambodia. Therefore:
1. The Senate of the Academic
Council wishes to associate itself
with President Pitzer in his
proposals to return the ROTC
question to the Advisory
Committee on ROTC for further
consideration, in the light of the
above developments.
2. The Senate asks President Pitzer
to attempt to act in concern with
the presidents of other universities
with respect to ROTC and related
issues, and to keep the Committee
apprised of the views and actions of
other universities.
3. All decisions by the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies regarding
course credit for ROTC shall be
postponed, pending the report to
the Senate from the Advisory
Committee on ROTC.
On the eve of a planned
student strike, anti-ROTC
demonstrators staged a second
round of street fighting with
police.

The demonstrators, whose
numbers raged from 350 to well
over a thousand, were tear gassed
repeatedly by the 225 Peninsula
police.
One person was arrested, and
at least 15 people were injured by
the fusilade of rocks, bricks,
bottles, and clubs.
Medics on the scene cared for
many injured demonstrators,
while 12 students were treated at
Cowell. Two were held overnight
for observation. Another three
persons were admitted to
Stanford Hospital emergency
room, two of them policemen.
Unprecedented Damage
One policeman reportedly
suffered a broken leg when hit by
a rock near Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and was removed in
an ambulance.
Damage to buildings was
unprecedented. At least 15
buildings were hit, with Encina
Hall, the ROTC building, the
Bookstore, the Post Office, and
Engineering Corner suffering
extremely heavy damage.
One car was set afire, and a
number of police cars, including
an ambulance, were stoned.
Streetlights across the campus
were smashed, and at least 20
false fire alarms were turned in.
Nonviolent Rally
Windows were smashed in the
Graduate School of Business as
the Faculty Senate met, and rocks
were thrown at the homes of
Provost Richard Lyman and
Provost Emeritus Fred Terman.
The violence came in the wake
of a rally in Frost Ampitheater,
sponsored by students and faculty
seeking a nonviolent response to
President Nixon's Cambodian
policy. Another meeting of
militant students slated for the
Old Union was cancelled, as most
of the militants joined the
meeting in Frost. [See related
story, this page.)
Leaving the meeting at 10
p.m., over 1000 demonstrators
massed in front of the ROTC

The Non-Violent Group will
meet this afternoon at 3 p.m. in
the Manzanita Park lounge. Plans
to forstall police and student
violence will be discussed. The
Group urges students to go to
either the Aero & Astro, Business
School or ROTC buildings today
to try and stop people from
carrying on normal activities.

building near the ampitheater.
Several windows were broken, and
the crowd moved on to Encina
Hall.

Non-violent Efforts

As demonstrators covered the
lawn in front of Encina, about 20
persons rushed forward, breaking
at least two of the front doors.
Several protestors shouted to
break in and destroy the building,
but before the crowd could move,
police, in squad cars, drove by.
Within two minutes of the first
attack on the building, police
arrived in force. As demonstrators
moved into the street, a group of
non-violent students formed a line
between them and the police.
They eventually sat down on the
front lawn and chanted, "Off
ROTC, No Rocks" and "Strike
tomorrow, Peace tonight."
Sgt. Donald Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department then declared the
crowd an illegal assembly as
rock-throwing protestors smashed
windows at the Lou Henry
Hoover building and Encina.
Rocks aimed at police were
thrown over the non-violent
group.
Police Busses
Several busloads of police
forming a line in front of Encina
told the crowd to disperse and
asked the sitting students to move
across the street.

At this time, the crowd still
numbered about 1000. Of these,
about half watched as rock
throwing continued and the
non-violent group held its ground.
Most of the violent
demonstrators then headed
towards White Plaza. By 10:30
p.m., the police reboarded busses
and proceeded to other parts of
campus, leaving the non-violent
group in front of Encina.
Confrontation
The militant protestors
gathered in front of the
Undergraduate Library. Smaller
militant groups penetrated into
the plaza, and were repulsed by
police.
By 10:45, both the violent and
non-violent groups had regrouped
between the Undergraduate
Library and the Bookstore. Small
teams of the non-violent
demonstrators tried to assemble
between the police and the
militants, but met little success.
The police reformed, moving
on the crowd. Three cannisters of
tear gas were thrown, and the
crowd headed toward Encina once
more.
Observers Harassed
Profs. Foulkes and Lohner,
both from the German dept., were
on campus as faculty observers
and urging students to non-violent
tactics. About 10:50, they were
walking across White Plaza to
their car when confronted by
about 20 police.
They identified themselves as
two of the many faculty observers
present but one policeman told
them to move on then took his
stick and hit them. Lohner caught
"a glancing blow" while Foulkes
was hit hard in the arm and
kidney and pushed in the neck.
They were then forced to run in
the direction of the rock-throwing
action.
At 11 p.m. 200 members of
the non-violent group, with linked
arms, formed a line in front of
Encina, and held off an equal
number of militants. About 20
policemen standing in front

BAD FOR BUSlNESS—Protesting students move around the (Graduate School of Business during last night's
demonstration. Windows were broken in the building, where a Faculty Senate meeting was in progress. The Business
School has Irequently been a target ol the ol'f-ROTC demonstrators and has suffered heavy damage in past weeks.
the ROTC issue." Patrick A. Shea,
former member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, said that
the "deadlock I have seen has
been broken in a very decent
manner." He added that the
Senate "focused on the issue, not
the tactics."
Rational Device
According to the two faculty
members, referring the issue back
to the committee "is a rational
device for getting the issues back
to the Senate in a well-ordered
form." Bach added that the
"Senate was not prepared to solve
one issue"—the continuance or
non-continuance of ROTC at
Stanford because there are a lot of
different issues involved.
They mentioned that such
issues as punitive clause problems,
negotiations between other
universities and the Defense
Department on ROTC, the status
of the Navy and Air Force ROTC
programs, and the student
referendum that will be
considered by the committee.
As mentioned in yesterday's
Daily, the Advisory Committee on
ROTC is holding open hearings on
the punitive clauses, and possibly
other issues, on May 11. Any
interested person who wishes to
contribute testimony can contact
the committee.
Hal Mickelson, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, said
the Senate agreed with Pitzer's
proposal because of the new
information that has become
available since the Senate last met.
Negative Effect
Speaking as an individual, Bach
denied that the anti-ROTC

campus violence of the last few
nights forced him to favor the
President's action. "It had a
negative effect on me but I'm sure
some members (of the Senate)
were in favor of giving in" because
of the violence. Pat A. Shea
added, "If the violence continues,
it will deter any further action (on
ROTC) by the University."
Pitzer also recommended that
any vacancies on the Advisory
Committee bi> filled immediately
and said that any recommen
dations that the committee makes
"will be presented to the Senate
for its consideration before I
make final agreements on behalf
of the University."
The Senate also asked Pitzer to
"act in concert" with other
universities with respect to ROTC
and declared that all decisions by
the CUS regarding course credit
for ROTC will be postponed until
the Advisory Committee reports
back to the Senate.
The "extraordinary action" of
sending a delegation to
Washington, D.C. to talk to
legislators to convey with
"urgency" the University views of
unresolved problems was passed
unanimously. Funds for the trip
will be raised by voluntary
donations; many members of the
Senate indicated privately that if
they were chosen to go they
would pay their own way.
The delegation will be
composed of the President or
Provost, representatives of the
trustees, the vice President for
Financial Affairs, about 20
members of the faculty Senate,
past and present members of the
Council of Presidents of the ASSU
and up to five students chosen by

V—--'
the Student Senate committee on
nominations.
The document authorizing this
delegation declares that issues
"giving rise" to campus
eonfrontations "are largely the
local manifestations of unresolved
problems which face us on the
national level—Vietnam and now
Cambodia, racial tensions, and
mounting problems in our cities."
It also declared that "the
decision-making machinery within
our nation is ceasing to appear
legitimate and voices raised in
urgent appeal seem to be
unheard."
Below are the text of the
resolutions passed by the Senate
and part of Pitzer's statement.
Following are resolutions adopted
by the Faculty Senate at Stanford
ROTC
(passed with scattered dissent)
Several recent developments call for
further consideration of the ROTC
negotiations, here and elsewhere: 1)
President Nixon's recommendations to
Congress for major changes in draft
deferment patterns; 2) the recent
student referendum at Stanford on
continuance of ROTC and credit for
ROTC; and 3) the American entry into
Cambodia. Therefore:
1. The Senate of the Academic
Council wishes to associate itself
with President Pitzer in his
proposals to return the ROTC
question to the Advisory
Committee on ROTC for further
consideration, in the light of the
above developments.
2. The Senate asks President Pitzer
to attempt to act in concern with
the presidents of other universities
with respect to ROTC and related
issues, and to keep the Committee
apprised of the views and actions of
other universities.
3. All decisions by the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies regarding
course credit for ROTC shall be
postponed, pending the report to
the Senate from the Advisory
Committee on ROTC.
On the eve of a planned
student strike, anti-ROTC
demonstrators staged a second
round of street fighting with
police.
The battle raged across most of
the central campus for four hours.
Numerous scuffles and
fistfights also occurred as some
students attempted to restrain
demonstrators. Several times,
members of the non-violent group
placed themselves between
demonstrators and police in an
effort to ease tensions.
The demonstrators, whose
numbers raged from 350 to well
over a thousand, were tear gassed
repeatedly by the 225 Peninsula

the fusilade of rocks, bricks,
bottles, and clubs.
Medics on the scene cared for
many injured demonstrators,
while 12 students were treated at
Cowell. Two were held overnight
for observation. Another three
persons were admitted to
Stanford Hospital emergency
room, two of them policemen.
Unprecedented Damage
One policeman reportedly
suffered a broken leg when hit by
a rock near Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and was removed in
an ambulance.
Damage to buildings was
unprecedented. At least 15
buildings were hit, with Encina
Hall, the ROTC building, the
Bookstore, the Post Office, and
Engineering Corner suffering
extremely heavy damage.
One car was set afire, and a
number of police cars, including
an ambulance, were stoned.
Streetlights across the campus
were smashed, and at least 20
false fire alarms were turned in.
Nonviolent Rally
Windows were smashed in the
Graduate School of Business as
the Faculty Senate met, and rocks
were thrown at the homes of
Provost Richard Lyman and
Provost Emeritus Fred Terman.
The violence came in the wake
of a rally in Frost Ampitheater,
sponsored by students and faculty
seeking a nonviolent response to
President Nixon's Cambodian
policy. Another meeting of
militant students slated for the
Old Union was cancelled, as most
of the militants joined the
meeting in Frost. [See related
story, this page.)
Leaving the meeting at 10
p.m., over 1000 demonstrators
massed in front of the ROTC

The Non-Violent Group will
meet this afternoon at 3 p.m. in
the Manzanita Park lounge. Plans
to forstall police and student
violence will be discussed. The
Group urges students to go to
either the Aero & Astro, Business
School or ROTC buildings today
to try and stop people from
carrying on normal activities.

building near the ampitheater.
Several windows were broken, and
the crowd moved on to Encina
Hall.

Non-violent Efforts

As demonstrators covered the
lawn in front of Encina, about 20
persons rushed forward, breaking
at least two of the front doors.
Several protestors shouted to
break in and destroy the building,
but before the crowd could move,
police, in squad cars, drove by.
Within two minutes of the first
attack on the building, police
arrived in force. As demonstrators
moved into the street, a group of
non-violent students formed a line
between them and the police.
They eventually sat down on the
front lawn and chanted, "Off
ROTC, No Rocks" and "Strike
tomorrow, Peace tonight."
Sgt. Donald Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department then declared the
crowd an illegal assembly as
rock-throwing protestors smashed
windows at the Lou Henry
Hoover building and Encina.
Rocks aimed at police were
thrown over the non-violent
group.
Police Busses
Several busloads of police
forming a line in front of Encina
told the crowd to disperse and
asked the sitting students to move
across the street.

At this time, the crowd still
numbered about 1000. Of these,
about half watched as rock
throwing continued and the
non-violent group held its ground.
Most of the violent
demonstrators then headed
towards White Plaza. By 10:30
p.m., the police reboarded busses
and proceeded to other parts of
campus, leaving the non-violent
group in front of Encina.
Confrontation
The militant protestors
gathered in front of the
Undergraduate Library. Smaller
militant groups penetrated into
the plaza, and were repulsed by
police.
By 10:45, both the violent and
non-violent groups had regrouped
between the Undergraduate
Library and the Bookstore. Small
teams of the non-violent
demonstrators tried to assemble
between the police and the
militants, but met little success.
The police reformed, moving
on the crowd. Three cannisters of
tear gas were thrown, and the
crowd headed toward Encina once
more.
Observers Harassed
Profs. Foulkes and Lohner,
both from the German dept., were
on campus as faculty observers
and urging students to non-violent
tactics. About 10:50, they were
walking across White Plaza to
their car when confronted by
about 20 police.
They identified themselves as
two of the many faculty observers
present but one policeman told
them to move on then took his
stick and hit them. Lohner caught
"a glancing blow" while Foulkes
was hit hard in the arm and
kidney and pushed in the neck.
They were then forced to run in
the direction of the rock-throwing
action.
At 11 p.m. 200 members of
the non-violent group, with linked
arms, formed a line in front of
Encina, and held off an equal
number of militants. About 20
policemen standing in front

BAD FOR BUSlNESS—Protesting students move around the (Graduate School of Business during last night's
demonstration. Windows were broken in the building, where a Faculty Senate meeting was in progress. The Business
School has Irequently been a target ol the ol'f-ROTC demonstrators and has suffered heavy damage in past weeks.
the ROTC issue." Patrick A. Shea,
former member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, said that
the "deadlock I have seen has
been broken in a very decent
manner." He added that the
Senate "focused on the issue, not
the tactics."
Rational Device
According to the two faculty
members, referring the issue back
to the committee "is a rational
device for getting the issues back
to the Senate in a well-ordered
form." Bach added that the
"Senate was not prepared to solve
one issue"—the continuance or
non-continuance of ROTC at
Stanford because there are a lot of
different issues involved.
They mentioned that such
issues as punitive clause problems,
negotiations between other
universities and the Defense
Department on ROTC, the status
of the Navy and Air Force ROTC
programs, and the student
referendum that will be
considered by the committee.
As mentioned in yesterday's
Daily, the Advisory Committee on
ROTC is holding open hearings on
the punitive clauses, and possibly
other issues, on May 11. Any
interested person who wishes to
contribute testimony can contact
the committee.
Hal Mickelson, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, said
the Senate agreed with Pitzer's
proposal because of the new
information that has become
available since the Senate last met.
Negative Effect
Speaking as an individual, Bach
denied that the anti-ROTC

campus violence of the last few
nights forced him to favor the
President's action. "It had a
negative effect on me but I'm sure
some members (of the Senate)
were in favor of giving in" because
of the violence. Pat A. Shea
added, "If the violence continues,
it will deter any further action (on
ROTC) by the University."
Pitzer also recommended that
any vacancies on the Advisory
Committee bi> filled immediately
and said that any recommen
dations that the committee makes
"will be presented to the Senate
for its consideration before I
make final agreements on behalf
of the University."
The Senate also asked Pitzer to
"act in concert" with other
universities with respect to ROTC
and declared that all decisions by
the CUS regarding course credit
for ROTC will be postponed until
the Advisory Committee reports
back to the Senate.
The "extraordinary action" of
sending a delegation to
Washington, D.C. to talk to
legislators to convey with
"urgency" the University views of
unresolved problems was passed
unanimously. Funds for the trip
will be raised by voluntary
donations; many members of the
Senate indicated privately that if
they were chosen to go they
would pay their own way.
The delegation will be
composed of the President or
Provost, representatives of the
trustees, the vice President for
Financial Affairs, about 20
members of the faculty Senate,
past and present members of the
Council of Presidents of the ASSU
and up to five students chosen by

V—--'
the Student Senate committee on
nominations.
The document authorizing this
delegation declares that issues
"giving rise" to campus
eonfrontations "are largely the
local manifestations of unresolved
problems which face us on the
national level—Vietnam and now
Cambodia, racial tensions, and
mounting problems in our cities."
It also declared that "the
decision-making machinery within
our nation is ceasing to appear
legitimate and voices raised in
urgent appeal seem to be
unheard."
Below are the text of the
resolutions passed by the Senate
and part of Pitzer's statement.
Following are resolutions adopted
by the Faculty Senate at Stanford
ROTC
(passed with scattered dissent)
Several recent developments call for
further consideration of the ROTC
negotiations, here and elsewhere: 1)
President Nixon's recommendations to
Congress for major changes in draft
deferment patterns; 2) the recent
student referendum at Stanford on
continuance of ROTC and credit for
ROTC; and 3) the American entry into
Cambodia. Therefore:
1. The Senate of the Academic
Council wishes to associate itself
with President Pitzer in his
proposals to return the ROTC
question to the Advisory
Committee on ROTC for further
consideration, in the light of the
above developments.
2. The Senate asks President Pitzer
to attempt to act in concern with
the presidents of other universities
with respect to ROTC and related
issues, and to keep the Committee
apprised of the views and actions of
other universities.
3. All decisions by the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies regarding
course credit for ROTC shall be
postponed, pending the report to
the Senate from the Advisory
Committee on ROTC.
On the eve of a planned
student strike, anti-ROTC
demonstrators staged a second
round of street fighting with
police.
The battle raged across most of
the central campus for four hours.
Numerous scuffles and
fistfights also occurred as some
students attempted to restrain
demonstrators. Several times,
members of the non-violent group
placed themselves between
demonstrators and police in an
effort to ease tensions.
The demonstrators, whose
numbers raged from 350 to well
over a thousand, were tear gassed
repeatedly by the 225 Peninsula
police.
One person was arrested, and
at least 15 people were injured by
the fusilade of rocks, bricks,
bottles, and clubs.

persons were admitted to
Stanford Hospital emergency
room, two of them policemen.
Unprecedented Damage
One policeman reportedly
suffered a broken leg when hit by
a rock near Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and was removed in
an ambulance.
Damage to buildings was
unprecedented. At least 15
buildings were hit, with Encina
Hall, the ROTC building, the
Bookstore, the Post Office, and
Engineering Corner suffering
extremely heavy damage.
One car was set afire, and a
number of police cars, including
an ambulance, were stoned.
Streetlights across the campus
were smashed, and at least 20
false fire alarms were turned in.
Nonviolent Rally
Windows were smashed in the
Graduate School of Business as
the Faculty Senate met, and rocks
were thrown at the homes of
Provost Richard Lyman and
Provost Emeritus Fred Terman.
The violence came in the wake
of a rally in Frost Ampitheater,
sponsored by students and faculty
seeking a nonviolent response to
President Nixon's Cambodian
policy. Another meeting of
militant students slated for the
Old Union was cancelled, as most
of the militants joined the
meeting in Frost. [See related
story, this page.)
Leaving the meeting at 10
p.m., over 1000 demonstrators
massed in front of the ROTC

The Non-Violent Group will
meet this afternoon at 3 p.m. in
the Manzanita Park lounge. Plans
to forstall police and student
violence will be discussed. The
Group urges students to go to
either the Aero & Astro, Business
School or ROTC buildings today
to try and stop people from
carrying on normal activities.

building near the ampitheater.
Several windows were broken, and
the crowd moved on to Encina
Hall.

Non-violent Efforts

As demonstrators covered the
lawn in front of Encina, about 20
persons rushed forward, breaking
at least two of the front doors.
Several protestors shouted to
break in and destroy the building,
but before the crowd could move,
police, in squad cars, drove by.
Within two minutes of the first
attack on the building, police
arrived in force. As demonstrators
moved into the street, a group of
non-violent students formed a line
between them and the police.
They eventually sat down on the
front lawn and chanted, "Off
ROTC, No Rocks" and "Strike
tomorrow, Peace tonight."
Sgt. Donald Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department then declared the
crowd an illegal assembly as
rock-throwing protestors smashed
windows at the Lou Henry
Hoover building and Encina.
Rocks aimed at police were
thrown over the non-violent
group.
Police Busses
Several busloads of police
forming a line in front of Encina
told the crowd to disperse and
asked the sitting students to move
across the street.

At this time, the crowd still
numbered about 1000. Of these,
about half watched as rock
throwing continued and the
non-violent group held its ground.
Most of the violent
demonstrators then headed
towards White Plaza. By 10:30
p.m., the police reboarded busses
and proceeded to other parts of
campus, leaving the non-violent
group in front of Encina.
Confrontation
The militant protestors
gathered in front of the
Undergraduate Library. Smaller
militant groups penetrated into
the plaza, and were repulsed by
police.
By 10:45, both the violent and
non-violent groups had regrouped
between the Undergraduate
Library and the Bookstore. Small
teams of the non-violent
demonstrators tried to assemble
between the police and the
militants, but met little success.
The police reformed, moving
on the crowd. Three cannisters of
tear gas were thrown, and the
crowd headed toward Encina once
more.
Observers Harassed
Profs. Foulkes and Lohner,
both from the German dept., were
on campus as faculty observers
and urging students to non-violent
tactics. About 10:50, they were
walking across White Plaza to
their car when confronted by
about 20 police.
They identified themselves as
two of the many faculty observers
present but one policeman told
them to move on then took his
stick and hit them. Lohner caught
"a glancing blow" while Foulkes
was hit hard in the arm and
kidney and pushed in the neck.
They were then forced to run in
the direction of the rock-throwing
action.
At 11 p.m. 200 members of
the non-violent group, with linked
arms, formed a line in front of
Encina, and held off an equal
number of militants. About 20
policemen standing in front

BAD FOR BUSlNESS—Protesting students move around the (Graduate School of Business during last night's
demonstration. Windows were broken in the building, where a Faculty Senate meeting was in progress. The Business
School has Irequently been a target ol the ol'f-ROTC demonstrators and has suffered heavy damage in past weeks.
the ROTC issue." Patrick A. Shea,
former member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, said that
the "deadlock I have seen has
been broken in a very decent
manner." He added that the
Senate "focused on the issue, not
the tactics."
Rational Device
According to the two faculty
members, referring the issue back
to the committee "is a rational
device for getting the issues back
to the Senate in a well-ordered
form." Bach added that the
"Senate was not prepared to solve
one issue"—the continuance or
non-continuance of ROTC at
Stanford because there are a lot of
different issues involved.
They mentioned that such
issues as punitive clause problems,
negotiations between other
universities and the Defense
Department on ROTC, the status
of the Navy and Air Force ROTC
programs, and the student
referendum that will be
considered by the committee.
As mentioned in yesterday's
Daily, the Advisory Committee on
ROTC is holding open hearings on
the punitive clauses, and possibly
other issues, on May 11. Any
interested person who wishes to
contribute testimony can contact
the committee.
Hal Mickelson, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, said
the Senate agreed with Pitzer's
proposal because of the new
information that has become
available since the Senate last met.
Negative Effect
Speaking as an individual, Bach
denied that the anti-ROTC

campus violence of the last few
nights forced him to favor the
President's action. "It had a
negative effect on me but I'm sure
some members (of the Senate)
were in favor of giving in" because
of the violence. Pat A. Shea
added, "If the violence continues,
it will deter any further action (on
ROTC) by the University."
Pitzer also recommended that
any vacancies on the Advisory
Committee bi> filled immediately
and said that any recommen
dations that the committee makes
"will be presented to the Senate
for its consideration before I
make final agreements on behalf
of the University."
The Senate also asked Pitzer to
"act in concert" with other
universities with respect to ROTC
and declared that all decisions by
the CUS regarding course credit
for ROTC will be postponed until
the Advisory Committee reports
back to the Senate.
The "extraordinary action" of
sending a delegation to
Washington, D.C. to talk to
legislators to convey with
"urgency" the University views of
unresolved problems was passed
unanimously. Funds for the trip
will be raised by voluntary
donations; many members of the
Senate indicated privately that if
they were chosen to go they
would pay their own way.
The delegation will be
composed of the President or
Provost, representatives of the
trustees, the vice President for
Financial Affairs, about 20
members of the faculty Senate,
past and present members of the
Council of Presidents of the ASSU
and up to five students chosen by

V—--'
the Student Senate committee on
nominations.
The document authorizing this
delegation declares that issues
"giving rise" to campus
eonfrontations "are largely the
local manifestations of unresolved
problems which face us on the
national level—Vietnam and now
Cambodia, racial tensions, and
mounting problems in our cities."
It also declared that "the
decision-making machinery within
our nation is ceasing to appear
legitimate and voices raised in
urgent appeal seem to be
unheard."
Below are the text of the
resolutions passed by the Senate
and part of Pitzer's statement.
Following are resolutions adopted
by the Faculty Senate at Stanford
ROTC
(passed with scattered dissent)
Several recent developments call for
further consideration of the ROTC
negotiations, here and elsewhere: 1)
President Nixon's recommendations to
Congress for major changes in draft
deferment patterns; 2) the recent
student referendum at Stanford on
continuance of ROTC and credit for
ROTC; and 3) the American entry into
Cambodia. Therefore:
1. The Senate of the Academic
Council wishes to associate itself
with President Pitzer in his
proposals to return the ROTC
question to the Advisory
Committee on ROTC for further
consideration, in the light of the
above developments.
2. The Senate asks President Pitzer
to attempt to act in concern with
the presidents of other universities
with respect to ROTC and related
issues, and to keep the Committee
apprised of the views and actions of
other universities.
3. All decisions by the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies regarding
course credit for ROTC shall be
postponed, pending the report to
the Senate from the Advisory
Committee on ROTC.
