# The 						Middle Ground
## Is Pitzer Really A Moderate? 
### Diarmuid McGuire 
Many unfortunate people at
Stan ford— President Pitzer, most
professors and members of the
Free Campus Movement to name
a few—see themselves as
moderates. They claim to occupy
some middle ground between
revolutionaries and the unpleasant
forces of repression.
What they will realize at some
point is that there is no middle
ground. In their actions they must
either support the system or fight
it.
It has been shown beyond all
reasonable doubt that Congress
does not have any control over
the South Asian war. The United
States has already sent half a
million men to Vietnam and more
to Laos and Thailand without so
much as a tip of the hat to our
elected representatives. If Nixon
thought Bill Fulbright or Mike
Mansfield had any power, he
would never have decided to
attack Cambodia.
No matter what he says, Pitzer
is giving material support to the
wars in Vietnam, Cambodia and
Laos, as well as future wars of
aggression against the people of
the Third World. And we know he
must. Because Ken's job was given
to him by the same kind of men
decided to fight the war, who
profit from the manufacture of

war materials, and who will
exploit the resources, markets and
labor of South Asia as long
as the U.S. is able to destroy
popular revolutions in that area.
Those Arena Boys
The boys who publish the
Arena oppose the draft on
libertarian grounds. They seem to
see the war as some kind of weird
mistake. The best they can say
about it is that the NLF ALSO
mistreats prisoners, which is not
even true.
Now the draft is' being
manipulated in order to force
these same Ibrtarian
conservatives into ROTC. They
also are going to have to fight that
unmistakable war. Yet they fight
to keep people out of Encina Hall
and constantly threaten to fink on
members of the movement. There
appears to be a contradiction in
this.
University Serves Empire
the university serves
imperialism, both directly with
research and indirectly by
providing the executives and
technicians required by the
empire. So the right wingers are
fighting for imperialism, even
though they can not put together
any intellectual position to justify
this.

Oddly enough, they probably
realize what they are doing. Some
of them are quite happy to be
part of a genocidal system, as long
as they can be on top of it. The
rest just get freakier and freakier.
And when movement members
point out that they are supporting
the system that is murdering
Vietnamese, Laotians and
Cambodians, they twist
themselves up and shout about
violence and glass.
The sad thing is that if these
people would act according to the
values that they profess, they
could eliminate ROTC at Stanford
and do many other useful things
with very little risk to themselves.
With the exception of Ken Pitzer,
who would be sent away to sail
his boat, and Dick Lyman, who
would miss the opportunity to
preside over the decline and fall of
Harvard, no one would suffer.
There is no room in the middle.
The administration, the right wing
students and the liberal faculty
are all going to have to decide
whether they are with the
oppressors or the oppressed. Since
oppressors are doomed, they
might as well join the movement.

popular revolutions in that area.
Those Arena Boys
The boys who publish the
Arena oppose the draft on
libertarian grounds. They seem to
see the war as some kind of weird
mistake. The best they can say
about it is that the NLF ALSO
mistreats prisoners, which is not
even true.
Now the draft is' being
manipulated in order to force
these same Ibrtarian
conservatives into ROTC. They
also are going to have to fight that
unmistakable war. Yet they fight
to keep people out of Encina Hall
and constantly threaten to fink on
members of the movement. There
appears to be a contradiction in
this.
University Serves Empire
the university serves
imperialism, both directly with
research and indirectly by
providing the executives and
technicians required by the
empire. So the right wingers are
fighting for imperialism, even
though they can not put together
any intellectual position to justify
this.

Oddly enough, they probably
realize what they are doing. Some
of them are quite happy to be
part of a genocidal system, as long
as they can be on top of it. The
rest just get freakier and freakier.
And when movement members
point out that they are supporting
the system that is murdering
Vietnamese, Laotians and
Cambodians, they twist
themselves up and shout about
violence and glass.
The sad thing is that if these
people would act according to the
values that they profess, they
could eliminate ROTC at Stanford
and do many other useful things
with very little risk to themselves.
With the exception of Ken Pitzer,
who would be sent away to sail
his boat, and Dick Lyman, who
would miss the opportunity to
preside over the decline and fall of
Harvard, no one would suffer.
There is no room in the middle.
The administration, the right wing
students and the liberal faculty
are all going to have to decide
whether they are with the
oppressors or the oppressed. Since
oppressors are doomed, they
might as well join the movement.
(Diarmuid McGuire is a
member of the Off ROTC
involvement.)
Many unfortunate people at
Stan ford— President Pitzer, most
professors and members of the
Free Campus Movement to name
a few—see themselves as
moderates. They claim to occupy
some middle ground between
revolutionaries and the unpleasant
forces of repression.
What they will realize at some
point is that there is no middle
ground. In their actions they must
either support the system or fight
it.
It has been shown beyond all
reasonable doubt that Congress
does not have any control over
the South Asian war. The United
States has already sent half a
million men to Vietnam and more
to Laos and Thailand without so
much as a tip of the hat to our
elected representatives. If Nixon
thought Bill Fulbright or Mike
Mansfield had any power, he
would never have decided to
attack Cambodia.
No matter what he says, Pitzer
is giving material support to the
wars in Vietnam, Cambodia and
Laos, as well as future wars of
aggression against the people of
the Third World. And we know he
must. Because Ken's job was given
to him by the same kind of men
decided to fight the war, who
profit from the manufacture of

war materials, and who will
exploit the resources, markets and
labor of South Asia as long
as the U.S. is able to destroy
popular revolutions in that area.
