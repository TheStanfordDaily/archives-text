# Armed Camp
## Romance Of Violence 
### Cheryl Ann Tonkin 
Tonight, Stanford University, once Leland
Stanford's placid farm, has taken on the semblance
of an armed camp. A line of helmeted police with
billy clubs stands guard before the shattered glass
doors of the Old Union administrative building
and another line guards the Stanford Bookstore
across the plaza.
Scattered groups of students, remnants from the
evenings activities, stand or sit and talk at a
cautious distance from either police blockade.
Other individuals wander about to survey the
situation, to make some rough estimate of what
has transpired, and appearing somewhat dazed,
they seem to find if very difficult to believe that
this surreal scene can actually be taking place here
in the middle of their campus around the fountain
where on a normal Spring day, people congregate
with friends or pause to sit for a moment in the
sun.
Inside of the Old Union building, the floor is
littered with fragments of shattered glass. More
uniformed police fill the buildings corridors and
lobby, where all day long, a peaceful sit-in took
place to demand the removal of ROTC from
campus.
In the daylight several hours from now, a few
will be pleased by the damage and ruin that awaits
them; they will have succeeded in disrupting the
University for a time. They will have lashed out at
all of the quoted anathemas. The Establishment,
the Military Industrial Complex, Viet Nam and
now Cambodia. But for the most part, the rest of
us, whether active participant or merely observer
in last night's events, will be shocked and
dismayed.
Self-Satisfaction
A small number of people will feel quite pleased
with themselves; for an evening they have
successfully waged war on "The System." But
most of us, whether sympathetic to or in
disagreement with the ROTC Off Campus
demands, will only be able to ask themselves and

each other, "Why?"
At this point, the very issue of ROTC is largely
obscured in reports of arrest and injury to both
demonstrators and police officers as protest went
out of control, and in estimates of thousands of
dollars of damage to University property resulting
from a few individual's militant rock-throwing as
they ranged over the campus.
Eloquence fails us, but the gaping, glassless
windows of many Stanford buildings speak for
themselves. Memories of a peaceful demonstration
that somehow escalated to a situation of mob
hysteria, offer bitter testimony to the outcome of
a philosophy that transgresses rule and flaunts
legal method that is upheld at its outer limits by a
fringe of individuals who are willing and waiting to
perpetrate violence with the justification of moral
concern or simply nihilism.
Classes As Usual
In a few hours classes will begin as usual. None
of us knows if the coming weeks will offer repeat
performances of that which has gone on tonight;
hopefully they will not. Tonight has displayed the
concrete reality of what can happen and of what is
happening on many campuses across the country,
when people succumb to the rhetoric and the
over-idealistic simple answers to tenuous dilimnas.
We have now seen what can happen when the
tension of frustrated peaceful protest, and the
remance of violence and self-righteous martyrdom
seize the imagination. It is neither a pleasant, nor a
comfortable sight.
A fleeting glimpse of this reality at Stanford
tonight reveals that we must now allow it to
continue. In a world that desperately needs so
much change, the answer does not lie in
destruction and violence aimed at the University,
the one institution that has always stood for the
tradition of Truth. The result of more evenings
like this one can only be rule by ignorance, and a
long dark night of chaos, (Cheryl Ann Tonkin
i,s a junior in communications.

this surreal scene can actually be taking place here
in the middle of their campus around the fountain
where on a normal Spring day, people congregate
with friends or pause to sit for a moment in the
sun.
Inside of the Old Union building, the floor is
littered with fragments of shattered glass. More
uniformed police fill the buildings corridors and
lobby, where all day long, a peaceful sit-in took
place to demand the removal of ROTC from
campus.
In the daylight several hours from now, a few
will be pleased by the damage and ruin that awaits
them; they will have succeeded in disrupting the
University for a time. They will have lashed out at
all of the quoted anathemas. The Establishment,
the Military Industrial Complex, Viet Nam and
now Cambodia. But for the most part, the rest of
us, whether active participant or merely observer
in last night's events, will be shocked and
dismayed.
Self-Satisfaction
A small number of people will feel quite pleased
with themselves; for an evening they have
successfully waged war on "The System." But
most of us, whether sympathetic to or in
disagreement with the ROTC Off Campus
demands, will only be able to ask themselves and

each other, "Why?"
At this point, the very issue of ROTC is largely
obscured in reports of arrest and injury to both
demonstrators and police officers as protest went
out of control, and in estimates of thousands of
dollars of damage to University property resulting
from a few individual's militant rock-throwing as
they ranged over the campus.
Eloquence fails us, but the gaping, glassless
windows of many Stanford buildings speak for
themselves. Memories of a peaceful demonstration
that somehow escalated to a situation of mob
hysteria, offer bitter testimony to the outcome of
a philosophy that transgresses rule and flaunts
legal method that is upheld at its outer limits by a
fringe of individuals who are willing and waiting to
perpetrate violence with the justification of moral
concern or simply nihilism.
Classes As Usual
In a few hours classes will begin as usual. None
of us knows if the coming weeks will offer repeat
performances of that which has gone on tonight;
hopefully they will not. Tonight has displayed the
concrete reality of what can happen and of what is
happening on many campuses across the country,
when people succumb to the rhetoric and the
over-idealistic simple answers to tenuous dilimnas.
We have now seen what can happen when the
tension of frustrated peaceful protest, and the
remance of violence and self-righteous martyrdom
seize the imagination. It is neither a pleasant, nor a
comfortable sight.
A fleeting glimpse of this reality at Stanford
tonight reveals that we must now allow it to
continue. In a world that desperately needs so
much change, the answer does not lie in
destruction and violence aimed at the University,
the one institution that has always stood for the
tradition of Truth. The result of more evenings
like this one can only be rule by ignorance, and a
long dark night of chaos, (Cheryl Ann Tonkin
i,s a junior in communications.
Tonight, Stanford University, once Leland
Stanford's placid farm, has taken on the semblance
of an armed camp. A line of helmeted police with
billy clubs stands guard before the shattered glass
doors of the Old Union administrative building
and another line guards the Stanford Bookstore
across the plaza.
Scattered groups of students, remnants from the
evenings activities, stand or sit and talk at a
cautious distance from either police blockade.
Other individuals wander about to survey the
situation, to make some rough estimate of what
has transpired, and appearing somewhat dazed,
they seem to find if very difficult to believe that
