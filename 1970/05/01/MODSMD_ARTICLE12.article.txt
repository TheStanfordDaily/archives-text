# Faculty Witness
## Bust Observations 
### Richard Almond 
(I he following article is u copy of a memorandum sent to President
I'itzer by Richard Almond, a faculty observer at Wednesday's Old
L r nion sit-in.)

I would like you to bo aware of my observations as a faculty
member during last night's demonstration, based on my presence at
the Old Union during the arrival of Santa Clara Sheriff's Department
ollicers, and the events of the hour that followed.
The deputies emerged running from their vehicles and I observed a
group running around the Tresidder side of the Old Union. I
observed at this time a young man shoved into the wall of the Old
Union apparently because he was standing in the way of the running
officers. It did not appear to me that he had deliberately placed
himself in this position, or offered any resistance, but had simply been
in the line of the officers who were seeking to get to the front of the
building quite rapidly.
Following this 1 moved to the front of the Old Union which had
been quickly cleared and where under the arches was a line of
deputies. I identified myself as an observer and a faculty member to
the closest deputy and stepped slightly to one side in order to be in a
better position to see what was going on in the building, which was
impossible from where I was standing. At this time the deputy jabbed
his black billyclub into my abdomen with sufficient force to shove me
backwards and leave a bruise this morning. The deputy making this
assault was not identified by a badge number or nametag. During.the
remaining half hour, 8:45 to 9:15, I did not observe or receive
personally any further assaults and I left the area before other major
confrontations.
Subjective Reactions
These are the facts. I would like to add some subjective reactions.
One is the major alteration in tone that occurred with the arrival of
the police. This outside presence appears to evoke in young people a
personification of the Army, with accusations about involvement in
Cambodia, etc., being directed at these unfortunate officers.
I was also struck at the extremely tense psychological situation of
an officer who, though armed and disciplined, is frequently put in a
position of being surrounded by large groups of taunting or
potentially threatening students. Although I am very sorry I was
attacked, I can understand quite well the tension and impulsive action
on the part of a police officer.
Administrative Rigidity
I sincerely feel that throughout the sequence of administrative,
legislative, and now violent events of the ROTC controversy that the
administration has acted initially unwisely, and recently rigidly. While
there can be absolutely no guarantee that the students occupying a
building non-violently will not. damage property in the building, it is
quite clear that when police are brought on campus, violence will
follow. As a result the university is the only controlling factor in
creating the possibility of other sorts of resolution of conflict.
Frankly, it appears quite likely that the damage that will occur with
a "law and order" approach to the ROTC confrontation will soon
exceed the value of the ROTC program and quite likely the value of
any destruction that might occur out of a demonstration that is not
ended by police action. Therefore, it would seem to me prudent and
morally preferable for the administration to adopt a non-violent
approach itself. It seems to me quite possible for the administration
simply to wait out a non violent demonstration, making it very clear
that violence will have to be controlled.
People and Property
Finally having been physically involved in a confrontation, it occurs
to me that a distinction must be made between violence to individuals
'ind violence to property. Far greater damage could have occurred and
may still occur from confrontations between individuals whether they
be policemen or student demonstrators or bystanding faculty
members like myself, I do not believe that the existence of a
university depends upon its papers, books, records, and offices. Its
existence resides in the individuals who take part in its educational life
and in the particular moral climate that it sustains. When the
university is threatened it is my feeling that we must err on the side of
potential sacrifice of property in order to prevent the sacrifice of
individuals.
Finally, it seems to me that the administration can take affirmative
action in relation to the campus confrontations that would broaden
the involved groups and decrease polarization. Such action naturally
incurs the possibility of disruption by radical students, but again this
is a risk worth taking. I am thinking of a devotion of one or more days
of class time to a discussion of the United States in Cambodia as well
as the ROTC issue, community forums including yourself or other
representatives of the administration, personal acts of non-violent
self-sacrifice on the part of administrators and faculty who are so
moved, and so forth.
