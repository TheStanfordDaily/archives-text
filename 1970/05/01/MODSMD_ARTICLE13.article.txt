# 'Everyone, Go Home!'

charitable, might label it an
asylum.
So listen inmates, go home. I'm
telling everyone, even you: we're
free to go home.
The rock throwing and window
smashing will continue. The police
will increase in numbers. There
will be a disaster — one night a
cop will crack — he'll fire his
buckshot and draw blood.
We can avoid this. We can all go
home. Forget about it all. You
can't stay sane battling the twin
forces of insanity. If we close the
university forever, there will never
be ROTC here again. We don't
have to destroy anything any
more. Just everyone go home.
Well, if you haven't realized i-t
by now, this column is printed
upside down. It symbolized my
world view. Long ago, I lost all
control over my cornea, over my
head. 1 confess: I've gone
completely butterfly nutty. I live
with everything absurdly inverted.
Join me!
"Dear Profs. Simpson and
Davie: I thought I could handle
your English courses this last
quarter of my academic career,
but I was wrong, ever so wrong.
Please understand why I have
asked the shrinks who accompany
me to authorize my retreat home.
It's not your fault.
"Your lectures are wonderful,
the small parts of them I hear. I'm
there every morning, but I only sit
and dream. My consciousness
drifts. I haven't taken notes in
weeks: I doodle in hieroglyphs, in
Chinese characters. Translated
they spell: ROTC off, righty on,
like an electric light bulb switch,
up and down. My felt tip marker
pen carries flourescent ink.
"Listen, I'll do the reading for
your courses at home. I'll mail
you my papers, neatly
double-spaced, as spaced out as
you desire. You mail me the
exams, I'll pay the postage. Oh
Jesus do I want to Graduate! I
gotta get outta this place.

straight geological era, informed
deities reported.
Student militants unleashed a
barrage of snow balls and icicles
after first stampeding a In rd of
longhorn cattle through the police
lines. The snowballs melted on
contact.
Exasperated gorillas broke free
from their spaghetti cages and
started spitting Franco-American
canned meatballs at the police.
Reinforcements arrived rather
slowly. Christ began laughing. The
bullshit was quite impenetrable,
you understand.
Free-falling Tarzans were seen
everywhere. The astronauts
returned. The world prayed. Now
even God was in hysterics. Nixon
sent the space trio on a good-will
mission to Cambodia. Senate
critics hemmed and hawed.
"Preposterous," said one old fart.
A World of Dogs
Dogs were barking. Police were
barking. Demonstrators were
barking. The world became a
cheeseburger, no longer round like
a globe, but flat like an oval
wafer, like Excedrin, with no
special ingredients for fast relief.
"Fast, fast, fast (relief)," said the
Peace Brigade, actually blowing
dope at the police. Smoke rings
vanished into the blood-red moon.
The moon barked like a cancerous
dog.
Students attempting to study
were repulsed at the barricade.
The police couldn't read. The
president went on T.V. Pat wore
an old coat. Checkers slept on the
lecturn. The cameras whirred. The
nation yawned.
Do it, Dicky! See Dick send
troops to Long Nol! See Long Nol
grin! See the troops die! See the
nation yawn! See the university
expire, like a spare tire driven over
thumbtacks camouflaged as
Marlboros! Don't you love it?

Life In An Asylum
Sorry, fans, but this insanity
has gone on long enough. This is
no university, it isn't even a zoo.

straight geological era, informed

Student militants unleashed a
barrage of snow balls and icicles
after first stampeding a In rd of
longhorn cattle through the police
lines. The snowballs melted on
contact.
Exasperated gorillas broke free
from their spaghetti cages and
started spitting Franco-American
canned meatballs at the police.
Reinforcements arrived rather
slowly. Christ began laughing. The
bullshit was quite impenetrable,
you understand.
Free-falling Tarzans were seen

returned. The world prayed. Now
even God was in hysterics. Nixon
sent the space trio on a good-will
mission to Cambodia. Senate

"Preposterous," said one old fart.
A World of Dogs
Dogs were barking. Police were
barking. Demonstrators were
barking. The world became a
cheeseburger, no longer round like
a globe, but flat like an oval
wafer, like Excedrin, with no
special ingredients for fast relief.
"Fast, fast, fast (relief)," said the
Peace Brigade, actually blowing
dope at the police. Smoke rings
vanished into the blood-red moon.
The moon barked like a cancerous
dog.
Students attempting to study
were repulsed at the barricade.
The police couldn't read. The
president went on T.V. Pat wore
an old coat. Checkers slept on the
lecturn. The cameras whirred. The

Do it, Dicky! See Dick send

nation yawn! See the university
expire, like a spare tire driven over
thumbtacks camouflaged as
Marlboros! Don't you love it?

Life In An Asylum
Sorry, fans, but this insanity
has gone on long enough. This is
no university, it isn't even a zoo.
Mental health authorities, being

STANFORD (AP) - Seven
billion police freaks were
bombarded by a hail of meteorites
early this morning as cosmological
disturbances continued on this
troubled campus for the ninth
charitable, might label it an
asylum.
So listen inmates, go home. I'm
telling everyone, even you: we're
free to go home.
The rock throwing and window
smashing will continue. The police
will increase in numbers. There
will be a disaster — one night a
cop will crack — he'll fire his
buckshot and draw blood.
We can avoid this. We can all go
home. Forget about it all. You
can't stay sane battling the twin
forces of insanity. If we close the
university forever, there will never
be ROTC here again. We don't
have to destroy anything any
more. Just everyone go home.
Well, if you haven't realized i-t
