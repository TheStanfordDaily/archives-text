# Inside Out
## Meanies Again 
### Jesse Cedarbaum 
Last time we left our docile
Pepperheads, they were just about
to explode in their incandescent
stoneyness. Let us now return
from our state of suspended
ammunition and reinvasion what's
to follow.
In a frozen blast of revolting
fusion, the radishal Peppermen
decided oncedly to sit in the
orfices at Mayor-Maynot General
Pitz and his side-kicker Proctor
Lyingman with the drawing of the
next morning's class struggle.
Needless to say, it was they who
were shat upon. The Meanie
Country Bumpers got there first.
Not to, be beaten, the
demonstrative emulants promptly
replaced themselves in their
belovedly trashed glass Onion.
There they gazed conten'edly on
the grass and passed tl.o usual
amount of bull.
Daylight savings slowly
renigged on its interest in
Pepperford, and the U.S. Meanie
Corpses marched on in their insult
into Cambodia. Meanwhile, our
local Greenies were scuttling
about their greentopped table,
frenetically planning out their
own mini-evasion of the
peacemeal gathering at the Onion,
until they finally came up with a
plan.

Following the glorious example
of that great Chief Meanie, Richer
the Outhouse Nix, General Pitz
moved his forces, under the
command of the inidgenous
Captain Rosebud, slowly and with
great deliberation to prance once
again upon the hollowed ground
of the good old Onion.
Little did we realize that by
sending in the Army-Pitz would
ignight the fuse that would
entirely obliviate the echoes of
any fountainhead submarines.
Instead of happy music to drive
the Meaniepigs away, the harsh,
glass-cracking high F of
Frustration piercing the air
signalled the prelude to "Street
Fighting Man" and the Stones.
And the Meanies, true to form,
got incited. Charging with all the
frenzied altruition of a frugaling
housewife at an after-Christman-
Bargain-basement sale at a
discount store, they rang up thirty
heads and seven hosts to their ever
growing account.
The vaselining hordes slid back
and forth between fighting back
and running away, as had once
been their custom, and for the
most part they hung in. But
Meanies as everyone knows,
cannot tolerate being confronted.
It makes them doubtful of their
obsanity.
It was then that their true
colors began to show under the
terrific strain of battle, the
Meanies finally resorted to the use
of the absolute weapon — tear
grass. Tear grass as you know is
the greatest downer ever invented
by the agents of CBW, and the
effects of its smoke are 100%
predictable — or are they?
The Natural Guardians are out
in the state of High-O, and the
General's CUSS (at) commttee
continues to debelitate. But we
won't keep score 'til the music's
over.
(Jesse Cedarbaum is mad, and
hopes a lot of other people are
too. Off ROTC!)

There they gazed conten'edly on
the grass and passed tl.o usual
amount of bull.
Daylight savings slowly
renigged on its interest in
Pepperford, and the U.S. Meanie
Corpses marched on in their insult
into Cambodia. Meanwhile, our
local Greenies were scuttling
about their greentopped table,
frenetically planning out their
own mini-evasion of the
peacemeal gathering at the Onion,
until they finally came up with a
plan.

Following the glorious example
of that great Chief Meanie, Richer
the Outhouse Nix, General Pitz
moved his forces, under the
command of the inidgenous
Captain Rosebud, slowly and with
great deliberation to prance once
again upon the hollowed ground
of the good old Onion.
Little did we realize that by
sending in the Army-Pitz would
ignight the fuse that would
entirely obliviate the echoes of
any fountainhead submarines.
Instead of happy music to drive
the Meaniepigs away, the harsh,
glass-cracking high F of
Frustration piercing the air
signalled the prelude to "Street
Fighting Man" and the Stones.
And the Meanies, true to form,
got incited. Charging with all the
frenzied altruition of a frugaling
housewife at an after-Christman-
Bargain-basement sale at a
discount store, they rang up thirty
heads and seven hosts to their ever
growing account.
The vaselining hordes slid back
and forth between fighting back
and running away, as had once
been their custom, and for the
most part they hung in. But
Meanies as everyone knows,
cannot tolerate being confronted.
It makes them doubtful of their
obsanity.
It was then that their true
colors began to show under the
terrific strain of battle, the
Meanies finally resorted to the use
of the absolute weapon — tear
grass. Tear grass as you know is
the greatest downer ever invented
by the agents of CBW, and the
effects of its smoke are 100%
predictable — or are they?
The Natural Guardians are out
in the state of High-O, and the
General's CUSS (at) commttee
continues to debelitate. But we
won't keep score 'til the music's
over.
(Jesse Cedarbaum is mad, and
hopes a lot of other people are
too. Off ROTC!)
Last time we left our docile
Pepperheads, they were just about
to explode in their incandescent
stoneyness. Let us now return
from our state of suspended
ammunition and reinvasion what's
to follow.
In a frozen blast of revolting
fusion, the radishal Peppermen
decided oncedly to sit in the
orfices at Mayor-Maynot General
Pitz and his side-kicker Proctor
Lyingman with the drawing of the
next morning's class struggle.
Needless to say, it was they who
were shat upon. The Meanie
Country Bumpers got there first.
Not to, be beaten, the
demonstrative emulants promptly
replaced themselves in their
belovedly trashed glass Onion.
