President Kenneth S. Pitzer delivered the following statement on
KZSU at 11 :30 a.m. Thursday:
"I know many are deeply concerned about our Government's
action in Cambodia. I have stmt telegrams to President Nixon and to
Senator Fulbright carrying the text of the statement I issued publicly
last night. In addition I urged Senator Fulbright immediately to call
hearings on the impact of the President's reported actions on our
colleges and universities.
"I believe such individual messages to President Nixon and to
members of Congress provide the best means of influencing our
Government's decision at this critical time. I urge those who are so
inclined to send telegrams or letters promptly.
"The violence in Cambodia and the violence on campus make it
impossible for us to continue with our daily round of activities. I am,
therefore, urging all members of the Stanford community to devote
themselves on Friday to intensive discussion of these issues in or out
of classes.
"1 will report upon recent campus events at the faculty Senate
meeting this afternoon.
"In addition I am calling an emergency meeting of the Academic
Council at 1 1 :0() a.m. Friday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium."
