Infiltrate the Crowds
Editor, The Daily :
Wednesday night a large
number of students felt the terror
of police riot tactics. The police
actions were horribly severe and
ineffective to prevent violence.
But the police reacted because a
small number of people were
throwing rocks and other items at
them for the cover of a large
crowd. The police were provoked
to protect themselves and to
prevent the lawlessness of
rock-throwing vandalism against
the Old Union.
Many innocent people suffered
the terror of the police, because it
was impossible or the police to
distinguish between the trashers
and the nonviolent in the jumble
of that crowd. The police
apparently do not have the
capacity to quell the kind of
violence that took place on White
Plaza Wednesday night.
Therefore, it is up to the
nonviolent protesters to do that. I
call on the leaders of the
Movement and its organization of
Affinity Groups to organize their
members to infiltrate the crowds
and be prepared to prevent the
trashers from letting the rocks fly.
If the leaders of the Movement are
not willing to do that, then it is
time for the nonviolent protesters
to disavow these militants and
find their own leadership
Until Pitzer abides by last
week's referendum, the protests
and sit-ins should continue. But
the confrontations must not.
It hurts me like hell to see the
kind of confrontation which
occurred Wendesday night. I want
to see an immediate end to our
military involvement in our
political meanderings in Southeast
Asia. I want to see the Black man
and the Chicano and the
American Indian stand as equals
to the White man in America, and
for them to be able to lead the
kind of life they choose. I want to
see American business remove its
web from the smaller countries
around the world and quit
strangling their peoples and their
resources.
But more confrontations only
provoke greater repression and
less likelihood that any of these
goals can be achieved. And if this
thing spirals on to bring this
country down, most of the people
will starve, and those that don't
will simply face tyranny of a
worse kind.
If you are for peace in
Southeast Aisa, please also work
for peace at home.

Generally speaking (and with
some very notable exceptions),
the faculty has been nowhere to
be in person, in
command, or in declaration of
position in this time of University
crisis. I have the deepest respect
for faculty members I know as
individuals. However, when I
consider the faculty on a
collective basis—say through its
action (or inaction) in the
Academic Senate or Academic
Council, or as a faculty
"presence" at times of stress—l
am less than entranced. In fact, I
am turned off.
Now it could be said that most
of the 1000 members of the
Academic Council are playing it
smart by letting other people
catch the action for them and that
soon everything will be quiet at
Stanford. They can then note that
their aloofness and indirection
paid off. The question I ask is

whether Stanford will be then by
any more than a two-bit school.

Editor, The Daily:
Two weeks ago the President
went on national TV to promise
the nation that, one year from
now, American troops would still
be fighting in Vietnam. Now he
has told us that our involvement
has been extended into Cambodia,
with the use of American
"military advisers" and air and
artillery support in a massive
invasion there.
There is no longer a Vietnam
War. It is now a war for
Indochina, and it cannot be
tolerated any longer.
The President's attempt to
initiate American involvement in
Cambodia must be met with
massive and immediate protest by
the American people. There must
be no business as usual today.
We urge all Stanford students
to suspend going to classes today
■ and devote their time to peaceful
protest and discussion of the
expanding war.
We further urge all those
concerned to wire their
Congressmen and Senators in
angry opposition to this grave
escalation. Letters and telegrams
might include a strong
endorsement of the
Hatfield-McGovern resolution,
which would deny immediately all
funds for military operations in
Cambodia, and deny such funds
for Vietnam and Laos by
December of this year.
In addition, we plan to saturate
the Mid-Peninsula today with
leaflets expressing the above
views. Those wishing to help
leaflet the community should
come to the ASSU office after
10:30 this morning.
The war must be ended, not
expanded. Together, today, we
must call for an end to the killing.

The letter to President Nixon
on Cambodia which I submitted
in behalf of a Faculty/Student/
Staff group and which you
printed in yesterday's edition, was
substantiated by yesterday's
events. Massive support by the
Stanford Community for this
letter might not directly influence

President Nixon but would
certainly be effective support for
members of Congress seeking an
end to the war.
As of noon Thursday of the
order of 1000 faculty, staff, and
student signatures had been
turned in to the collection office,
Room 500 A, and an estimated
1000 more had been obtained
elsewhere on campus but not yet
returned for tally. Faculty

Editor, THE DAII.Y:
At 10 p.m. Wednesday night,
Bijay Sharma, an Indian Graduate
student in Electrical Engineering
called a friend to say he was on
his way home from the labs. He
did not arrive.
Bijay was set upon in the lobby
of the Undergraduate Library and
savagely beaten by about 5
policemen. He was taken to
Cowell Health Center in an
unconscious state. From Cowell
came the report that he was
'uncomfortable' and that his
ankles might have been 'sprained.'
Between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., there
was no news. When a friend
finally saw him, there were
wounds all over his face and neck.
He was almost unrecognizable and
could hardly speak.
Yet, Thursday's Palo Alto
Times showed a photograph of
Bijay being led off under arrest
bleeding only from his nose and
mouth! Bijay said that he was
beaten after his arrest by
plainclothes policemen as well as
uniformed officers. At one point
they took his motorcycle helmet
and beat him with it.
On Thursday we were told that
he had suffered 'facial fractures.'
Up until Thursday evening bail
had not been set, and at 2 p.m.
only we were told that he was

charged with 'failure to disperse'
and 'interference with a police
officer in the performance of his
duties,'
The police attack on Bijay is
just another example of the racist
policies of US imperialism. In
Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Laos, in
fact throughout the Third World,
the ruthless monsters who control
US government are trying to crash
the liberation movements of the
oppressed peoples.
In order to make this appear as
"normal," US rulers attempt to
cover up their motives as simply
an attempt to save the "free
world" (i.e. imperialist world)
from "subhuman" colored
peoples, "gooks" in Vietnam,
"raton" in Algeria, etc. No person
from the Third World can be an
"innocent bystander" in the
struggle against ROTC, a military
agency of US imperialism.
Nor can any person from the
Third World appear innocent to
cops whose job is to defend
imperialism, and who are
constantly drilled with racist
ideas, in order to facilitate their
"services."
We are not impressed with
Pitzer's phoney "concern" about,
say, Cambodia which masks his
clear record of attempts to crush
any anti-imperialist movement on
this campus, and makes it easier
for him to fool people about his
allegiances.
No phoney referendum, no
amount of liberal bellycrawling,
no pious phrases are going to turn
back the anti-imperialist struggles
of the Third World peoples, nor
the determination of the
imperialists to crush these
struggles. It is Pitzer who brought
the cops on Stanford campus.
Now this same Pitzer claims
that he is not responsible for what
happened to Bijay and the other
students. (We note that the only
students hospitalized on that
night were colored.) Pitzer's
pattern is the same as that of the
U.S. government. In light of that
we demand that Pitzer
immediately meet these minimal
demands:
I.—That the University pay all
expenses incurred from legal and
medical services needed by Bijay;
2.—That all charges against
Bijay be dropped;
3.—That any retaliatory actions
by the immigration authorities be
prevented;
4.—That the University
immediately provide permanent
legal defense for the Foreign
students;
s.—'That the University
immediately implement these
demands.

the confrontations must not.
It hurts me like hell to see the
kind of confrontation which
occurred Wendesday night. I want
to see an immediate end to our
military involvement in our
political meanderings in Southeast
Asia. I want to see the Black man
and the Chicano and the
American Indian stand as equals
to the White man in America, and
for them to be able to lead the
kind of life they choose. I want to
see American business remove its
web from the smaller countries
around the world and quit
strangling their peoples and their
resources.
But more confrontations only
provoke greater repression and
less likelihood that any of these
goals can be achieved. And if this
thing spirals on to bring this
country down, most of the people
will starve, and those that don't
will simply face tyranny of a
worse kind.
If you are for peace in

Generally speaking (and with

the faculty has been nowhere to

consider the faculty on a
collective basis—say through its

Now it could be said that most

Two weeks ago the President
went on national TV to promise
the nation that, one year from
now, American troops would still
be fighting in Vietnam. Now he
has told us that our involvement
has been extended into Cambodia,
with the use of American
"military advisers" and air and
artillery support in a massive
invasion there.
There is no longer a Vietnam
War. It is now a war for
Indochina, and it cannot be
tolerated any longer.
The President's attempt to
initiate American involvement in
Cambodia must be met with
massive and immediate protest by
the American people. There must
be no business as usual today.
We urge all Stanford students
to suspend going to classes today
■ and devote their time to peaceful
protest and discussion of the
expanding war.
We further urge all those
concerned to wire their
Congressmen and Senators in
angry opposition to this grave
escalation. Letters and telegrams
might include a strong
endorsement of the
Hatfield-McGovern resolution,
which would deny immediately all
funds for military operations in
Cambodia, and deny such funds
for Vietnam and Laos by
December of this year.
In addition, we plan to saturate
the Mid-Peninsula today with
leaflets expressing the above
views. Those wishing to help

The war must be ended, not

Police Racism ?
Editor, THE DAII.Y:
At 10 p.m. Wednesday night,
Bijay Sharma, an Indian Graduate
student in Electrical Engineering
called a friend to say he was on
his way home from the labs. He
did not arrive.
Bijay was set upon in the lobby
of the Undergraduate Library and
savagely beaten by about 5
policemen. He was taken to
Cowell Health Center in an
unconscious state. From Cowell
came the report that he was
'uncomfortable' and that his
ankles might have been 'sprained.'
Between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., there
was no news. When a friend
finally saw him, there were
wounds all over his face and neck.
He was almost unrecognizable and
could hardly speak.
Yet, Thursday's Palo Alto
Times showed a photograph of
Bijay being led off under arrest
bleeding only from his nose and
mouth! Bijay said that he was
beaten after his arrest by
plainclothes policemen as well as
uniformed officers. At one point
they took his motorcycle helmet
and beat him with it.
On Thursday we were told that
he had suffered 'facial fractures.'
Up until Thursday evening bail
had not been set, and at 2 p.m.
only we were told that he was

charged with 'failure to disperse'
and 'interference with a police
officer in the performance of his
duties,'
The police attack on Bijay is
just another example of the racist
policies of US imperialism. In
Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Laos, in
fact throughout the Third World,
the ruthless monsters who control
US government are trying to crash
the liberation movements of the
oppressed peoples.
In order to make this appear as
"normal," US rulers attempt to
cover up their motives as simply
an attempt to save the "free
world" (i.e. imperialist world)
from "subhuman" colored
peoples, "gooks" in Vietnam,
"raton" in Algeria, etc. No person
from the Third World can be an
"innocent bystander" in the
struggle against ROTC, a military
agency of US imperialism.
Nor can any person from the
Third World appear innocent to
cops whose job is to defend
imperialism, and who are
constantly drilled with racist
ideas, in order to facilitate their
"services."
We are not impressed with
Pitzer's phoney "concern" about,
say, Cambodia which masks his
clear record of attempts to crush
any anti-imperialist movement on
this campus, and makes it easier
for him to fool people about his
allegiances.
No phoney referendum, no
amount of liberal bellycrawling,
no pious phrases are going to turn
back the anti-imperialist struggles
of the Third World peoples, nor
the determination of the
imperialists to crush these
struggles. It is Pitzer who brought
the cops on Stanford campus.
Now this same Pitzer claims
that he is not responsible for what
happened to Bijay and the other
students. (We note that the only
students hospitalized on that
night were colored.) Pitzer's
pattern is the same as that of the
U.S. government. In light of that
we demand that Pitzer
immediately meet these minimal
demands:
I.—That the University pay all
expenses incurred from legal and
medical services needed by Bijay;
2.—That all charges against
Bijay be dropped;
3.—That any retaliatory actions
by the immigration authorities be
prevented;
4.—That the University
immediately provide permanent
legal defense for the Foreign
students;
s.—'That the University
immediately implement these
demands.
Infiltrate the Crowds
Editor, The Daily :
Wednesday night a large
number of students felt the terror
of police riot tactics. The police
actions were horribly severe and
ineffective to prevent violence.
But the police reacted because a
small number of people were
throwing rocks and other items at
them for the cover of a large
crowd. The police were provoked
to protect themselves and to
prevent the lawlessness of
rock-throwing vandalism against
the Old Union.
Many innocent people suffered
the terror of the police, because it
was impossible or the police to
distinguish between the trashers
and the nonviolent in the jumble
of that crowd. The police
apparently do not have the
capacity to quell the kind of
violence that took place on White
Plaza Wednesday night.
Therefore, it is up to the
nonviolent protesters to do that. I
call on the leaders of the
Movement and its organization of
Affinity Groups to organize their
members to infiltrate the crowds
and be prepared to prevent the
trashers from letting the rocks fly.
If the leaders of the Movement are
not willing to do that, then it is
time for the nonviolent protesters
to disavow these militants and
find their own leadership
Until Pitzer abides by last
week's referendum, the protests
and sit-ins should continue. But
the confrontations must not.
It hurts me like hell to see the
kind of confrontation which
occurred Wendesday night. I want
to see an immediate end to our
military involvement in our
political meanderings in Southeast

Two weeks ago the President
went on national TV to promise
the nation that, one year from
now, American troops would still
be fighting in Vietnam. Now he
has told us that our involvement
has been extended into Cambodia,
with the use of American
"military advisers" and air and
artillery support in a massive
invasion there.
There is no longer a Vietnam
War. It is now a war for
Indochina, and it cannot be
tolerated any longer.
The President's attempt to
initiate American involvement in
Cambodia must be met with
massive and immediate protest by
the American people. There must
be no business as usual today.
We urge all Stanford students
to suspend going to classes today
■ and devote their time to peaceful
protest and discussion of the
expanding war.
We further urge all those
concerned to wire their
Congressmen and Senators in
angry opposition to this grave
escalation. Letters and telegrams
might include a strong
endorsement of the
Hatfield-McGovern resolution,
which would deny immediately all
funds for military operations in
Cambodia, and deny such funds
for Vietnam and Laos by
December of this year.
In addition, we plan to saturate
the Mid-Peninsula today with
leaflets expressing the above
views. Those wishing to help
leaflet the community should
come to the ASSU office after

The war must be ended, not
expanded. Together, today, we
must call for an end to the killing.

Police Racism ?
Editor, THE DAII.Y:
At 10 p.m. Wednesday night,
Bijay Sharma, an Indian Graduate
student in Electrical Engineering
called a friend to say he was on
his way home from the labs. He
did not arrive.
Bijay was set upon in the lobby
of the Undergraduate Library and
savagely beaten by about 5
policemen. He was taken to
Cowell Health Center in an
unconscious state. From Cowell
came the report that he was
'uncomfortable' and that his
ankles might have been 'sprained.'
Between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., there
was no news. When a friend
finally saw him, there were
wounds all over his face and neck.
He was almost unrecognizable and
could hardly speak.
Yet, Thursday's Palo Alto
Times showed a photograph of
Bijay being led off under arrest
bleeding only from his nose and
mouth! Bijay said that he was
beaten after his arrest by
plainclothes policemen as well as
uniformed officers. At one point
they took his motorcycle helmet
and beat him with it.
On Thursday we were told that
he had suffered 'facial fractures.'
Up until Thursday evening bail
had not been set, and at 2 p.m.
only we were told that he was

charged with 'failure to disperse'
and 'interference with a police
officer in the performance of his
duties,'
The police attack on Bijay is
just another example of the racist
policies of US imperialism. In
Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Laos, in
fact throughout the Third World,
the ruthless monsters who control
US government are trying to crash
the liberation movements of the
oppressed peoples.
In order to make this appear as
"normal," US rulers attempt to
cover up their motives as simply
an attempt to save the "free
world" (i.e. imperialist world)
from "subhuman" colored
peoples, "gooks" in Vietnam,
"raton" in Algeria, etc. No person
from the Third World can be an
"innocent bystander" in the
struggle against ROTC, a military
agency of US imperialism.
Nor can any person from the
Third World appear innocent to
cops whose job is to defend
imperialism, and who are
constantly drilled with racist
ideas, in order to facilitate their
"services."
We are not impressed with
Pitzer's phoney "concern" about,
say, Cambodia which masks his
clear record of attempts to crush
any anti-imperialist movement on
this campus, and makes it easier
for him to fool people about his
allegiances.
No phoney referendum, no
amount of liberal bellycrawling,
no pious phrases are going to turn
back the anti-imperialist struggles
of the Third World peoples, nor
the determination of the
imperialists to crush these
struggles. It is Pitzer who brought
the cops on Stanford campus.
Now this same Pitzer claims
that he is not responsible for what
happened to Bijay and the other
students. (We note that the only
students hospitalized on that
night were colored.) Pitzer's
pattern is the same as that of the
U.S. government. In light of that
we demand that Pitzer
immediately meet these minimal
demands:
I.—That the University pay all
expenses incurred from legal and
medical services needed by Bijay;
2.—That all charges against
Bijay be dropped;
3.—That any retaliatory actions
by the immigration authorities be
prevented;
4.—That the University
immediately provide permanent
legal defense for the Foreign
students;
s.—'That the University
immediately implement these
demands.
Infiltrate the Crowds
Editor, The Daily :
Wednesday night a large
number of students felt the terror
of police riot tactics. The police
actions were horribly severe and
ineffective to prevent violence.
But the police reacted because a
small number of people were
throwing rocks and other items at
them for the cover of a large
crowd. The police were provoked
to protect themselves and to
prevent the lawlessness of
rock-throwing vandalism against
the Old Union.
Many innocent people suffered
the terror of the police, because it
was impossible or the police to
distinguish between the trashers
and the nonviolent in the jumble
of that crowd. The police
apparently do not have the
capacity to quell the kind of
violence that took place on White
Plaza Wednesday night.
Therefore, it is up to the
nonviolent protesters to do that. I
call on the leaders of the
Movement and its organization of
Affinity Groups to organize their
members to infiltrate the crowds
and be prepared to prevent the
trashers from letting the rocks fly.
If the leaders of the Movement are
not willing to do that, then it is
time for the nonviolent protesters
to disavow these militants and
find their own leadership
Until Pitzer abides by last
week's referendum, the protests
and sit-ins should continue. But
the confrontations must not.
It hurts me like hell to see the
kind of confrontation which
occurred Wendesday night. I want
to see an immediate end to our
military involvement in our
political meanderings in Southeast
Asia. I want to see the Black man
and the Chicano and the
American Indian stand as equals
to the White man in America, and
for them to be able to lead the
kind of life they choose. I want to
see American business remove its
web from the smaller countries
around the world and quit
strangling their peoples and their
resources.
But more confrontations only
provoke greater repression and
less likelihood that any of these
goals can be achieved. And if this
thing spirals on to bring this
country down, most of the people
will starve, and those that don't
will simply face tyranny of a
worse kind.
If you are for peace in
Southeast Aisa, please also work
for peace at home.

The President's attempt to
initiate American involvement in
Cambodia must be met with
massive and immediate protest by
the American people. There must
be no business as usual today.
We urge all Stanford students
to suspend going to classes today
■ and devote their time to peaceful
protest and discussion of the
expanding war.
We further urge all those
concerned to wire their
Congressmen and Senators in
angry opposition to this grave
escalation. Letters and telegrams
might include a strong
endorsement of the
Hatfield-McGovern resolution,
which would deny immediately all
funds for military operations in
Cambodia, and deny such funds
for Vietnam and Laos by
December of this year.
In addition, we plan to saturate
the Mid-Peninsula today with
leaflets expressing the above
views. Those wishing to help
leaflet the community should
come to the ASSU office after

The war must be ended, not
expanded. Together, today, we
must call for an end to the killing.

The letter to President Nixon
on Cambodia which I submitted
in behalf of a Faculty/Student/

printed in yesterday's edition, was
substantiated by yesterday's
events. Massive support by the
Stanford Community for this
letter might not directly influence

President Nixon but would
certainly be effective support for
members of Congress seeking an
end to the war.
As of noon Thursday of the

turned in to the collection office,
Room 500 A, and an estimated
1000 more had been obtained
elsewhere on campus but not yet
returned for tally. Faculty

Police Racism ?
Editor, THE DAII.Y:
At 10 p.m. Wednesday night,
Bijay Sharma, an Indian Graduate
student in Electrical Engineering
called a friend to say he was on
his way home from the labs. He
did not arrive.
Bijay was set upon in the lobby
of the Undergraduate Library and
savagely beaten by about 5
policemen. He was taken to
Cowell Health Center in an
unconscious state. From Cowell
came the report that he was
'uncomfortable' and that his
ankles might have been 'sprained.'
Between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., there
was no news. When a friend
finally saw him, there were
wounds all over his face and neck.
He was almost unrecognizable and
could hardly speak.
Yet, Thursday's Palo Alto
Times showed a photograph of
Bijay being led off under arrest
bleeding only from his nose and
mouth! Bijay said that he was
beaten after his arrest by
plainclothes policemen as well as
uniformed officers. At one point
they took his motorcycle helmet
and beat him with it.
On Thursday we were told that
he had suffered 'facial fractures.'
Up until Thursday evening bail
had not been set, and at 2 p.m.
only we were told that he was

charged with 'failure to disperse'
and 'interference with a police
officer in the performance of his
duties,'
The police attack on Bijay is
just another example of the racist
policies of US imperialism. In
Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Laos, in
fact throughout the Third World,
the ruthless monsters who control
US government are trying to crash
the liberation movements of the
oppressed peoples.
In order to make this appear as
"normal," US rulers attempt to
cover up their motives as simply
an attempt to save the "free
world" (i.e. imperialist world)
from "subhuman" colored
peoples, "gooks" in Vietnam,
"raton" in Algeria, etc. No person
from the Third World can be an
"innocent bystander" in the
struggle against ROTC, a military
agency of US imperialism.
Nor can any person from the
Third World appear innocent to
cops whose job is to defend
imperialism, and who are
constantly drilled with racist
ideas, in order to facilitate their
"services."
We are not impressed with
Pitzer's phoney "concern" about,
say, Cambodia which masks his
clear record of attempts to crush
any anti-imperialist movement on
this campus, and makes it easier
for him to fool people about his
allegiances.
No phoney referendum, no
amount of liberal bellycrawling,
no pious phrases are going to turn
back the anti-imperialist struggles
of the Third World peoples, nor
the determination of the
imperialists to crush these
struggles. It is Pitzer who brought
the cops on Stanford campus.
Now this same Pitzer claims
that he is not responsible for what
happened to Bijay and the other
students. (We note that the only
students hospitalized on that
night were colored.) Pitzer's
pattern is the same as that of the
U.S. government. In light of that
we demand that Pitzer
immediately meet these minimal
demands:
I.—That the University pay all
expenses incurred from legal and
medical services needed by Bijay;
2.—That all charges against
Bijay be dropped;
3.—That any retaliatory actions
by the immigration authorities be
prevented;
4.—That the University
immediately provide permanent
legal defense for the Foreign
students;
s.—'That the University
immediately implement these
demands.
Infiltrate the Crowds
Editor, The Daily :
Wednesday night a large
number of students felt the terror
of police riot tactics. The police
actions were horribly severe and
ineffective to prevent violence.
But the police reacted because a
small number of people were
throwing rocks and other items at
them for the cover of a large
crowd. The police were provoked
to protect themselves and to
prevent the lawlessness of
rock-throwing vandalism against
the Old Union.
Many innocent people suffered
the terror of the police, because it
was impossible or the police to
distinguish between the trashers
and the nonviolent in the jumble
of that crowd. The police
apparently do not have the
capacity to quell the kind of
violence that took place on White
Plaza Wednesday night.
Therefore, it is up to the
nonviolent protesters to do that. I
call on the leaders of the
Movement and its organization of
Affinity Groups to organize their
members to infiltrate the crowds
and be prepared to prevent the
trashers from letting the rocks fly.
If the leaders of the Movement are
not willing to do that, then it is
time for the nonviolent protesters
to disavow these militants and
find their own leadership
Until Pitzer abides by last
week's referendum, the protests
and sit-ins should continue. But
the confrontations must not.
It hurts me like hell to see the
kind of confrontation which
occurred Wendesday night. I want
to see an immediate end to our
military involvement in our
political meanderings in Southeast
Asia. I want to see the Black man
and the Chicano and the
American Indian stand as equals
to the White man in America, and
for them to be able to lead the
kind of life they choose. I want to
see American business remove its
web from the smaller countries
around the world and quit
strangling their peoples and their
resources.
But more confrontations only
provoke greater repression and
less likelihood that any of these
goals can be achieved. And if this
thing spirals on to bring this
country down, most of the people
will starve, and those that don't
will simply face tyranny of a
worse kind.
If you are for peace in
Southeast Aisa, please also work
for peace at home.

Generally speaking (and with

the faculty has been nowhere to

consider the faculty on a

Now it could be said that most

substantiated by yesterday's
events. Massive support by the
Stanford Community for this
letter might not directly influence

President Nixon but would
certainly be effective support for
members of Congress seeking an
end to the war.
As of noon Thursday of the
order of 1000 faculty, staff, and
student signatures had been
turned in to the collection office,
Room 500 A, and an estimated
1000 more had been obtained
elsewhere on campus but not yet
returned for tally. Faculty
signatories include R. W. Lyman,
M. Mancall, R. J. Moffat, R. J.
Glaser, W. M. Kays, S.M.
Dornbusch, K.F. Reinhardt
(Emer.), A. Grommon, J.
Davidson, VV. Carnochan, J.
Chowning, G. Garvy, H. Weiler, B.
Page, P. Z. Bulkeley, L. Tarshis,
A. Starr, J. R. Manning, A.
Manne, R. Eastman, and many
others. Numerous staff and
administrative persons have also
become signatories.
Signature sheets have been sent
to every academic department
office and are also available on
Engineering Corner. Anyone here
who wishes to do something
about the underlying causes of
campus unrest should sign the
letter today.

Police Racism ?
Editor, THE DAII.Y:
At 10 p.m. Wednesday night,
Bijay Sharma, an Indian Graduate
student in Electrical Engineering
called a friend to say he was on
his way home from the labs. He
did not arrive.
Bijay was set upon in the lobby
of the Undergraduate Library and
savagely beaten by about 5
policemen. He was taken to
Cowell Health Center in an
unconscious state. From Cowell
came the report that he was
'uncomfortable' and that his
ankles might have been 'sprained.'
Between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., there
was no news. When a friend
finally saw him, there were
wounds all over his face and neck.
He was almost unrecognizable and
could hardly speak.
Yet, Thursday's Palo Alto
Times showed a photograph of
Bijay being led off under arrest
bleeding only from his nose and
mouth! Bijay said that he was
beaten after his arrest by
plainclothes policemen as well as
uniformed officers. At one point
they took his motorcycle helmet
and beat him with it.
On Thursday we were told that
he had suffered 'facial fractures.'
Up until Thursday evening bail
had not been set, and at 2 p.m.
only we were told that he was

charged with 'failure to disperse'
and 'interference with a police
officer in the performance of his
duties,'
The police attack on Bijay is
just another example of the racist
policies of US imperialism. In
Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Laos, in
fact throughout the Third World,
the ruthless monsters who control
US government are trying to crash
the liberation movements of the
oppressed peoples.
In order to make this appear as
"normal," US rulers attempt to
cover up their motives as simply
an attempt to save the "free
world" (i.e. imperialist world)
from "subhuman" colored
peoples, "gooks" in Vietnam,
"raton" in Algeria, etc. No person
from the Third World can be an
"innocent bystander" in the
struggle against ROTC, a military
agency of US imperialism.
Nor can any person from the
Third World appear innocent to
cops whose job is to defend
imperialism, and who are
constantly drilled with racist
ideas, in order to facilitate their
"services."
We are not impressed with
Pitzer's phoney "concern" about,
say, Cambodia which masks his
clear record of attempts to crush
any anti-imperialist movement on
this campus, and makes it easier
for him to fool people about his
allegiances.
No phoney referendum, no
amount of liberal bellycrawling,
no pious phrases are going to turn
back the anti-imperialist struggles
of the Third World peoples, nor
the determination of the
imperialists to crush these
struggles. It is Pitzer who brought
the cops on Stanford campus.
Now this same Pitzer claims
that he is not responsible for what
happened to Bijay and the other
students. (We note that the only
students hospitalized on that
night were colored.) Pitzer's
pattern is the same as that of the
U.S. government. In light of that
we demand that Pitzer
immediately meet these minimal
demands:
I.—That the University pay all
expenses incurred from legal and
medical services needed by Bijay;
2.—That all charges against
Bijay be dropped;
3.—That any retaliatory actions
by the immigration authorities be
prevented;
4.—That the University
immediately provide permanent
legal defense for the Foreign
students;
s.—'That the University
immediately implement these
demands.
