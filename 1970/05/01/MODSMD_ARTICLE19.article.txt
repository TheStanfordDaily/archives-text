# ROTC Must End

. . . unless department chairmen,
deans, and presidents are receptive
to proposals for change, they
should themselves be chatted.

In response to the movement of
United States combat troops and
logistical support into Cambodia
yesterday, groups on campus have
been calling for the University to
declare publicly its opposition to
the extension of the war in
Vnetnam. Yet the intimate nature
of the University's complicity in
what can now be rightly called the
war in Indochina cannot be
overlooked.
The institution of ROTC on
campus is much more than a
symbolic issue peripheral to the
U.S. imperialistic foreign policy.
Both as an institution and as a
structure within the University,
ROTC is part of the interlocking
structure of government and
corporate enterprise that depends,
for its continued growth, on the
exploitation of Third World
peoples. On the one hand, ROTC
provides a process of socialization,
as well as military training, that
complements the University
production of persons fitted to fill
national leadership roles.
As part of the channeling
process, ROTC training brings
technical skills and obedient
attitudes into top positions in
government and industry. As a
structure within the University,
ROTC is one of the many
contradictions created by
increasing dependence on
government and corporative
financial support. Behind the
persistent ideology of university
autonomy, the University trains
the nation's "leaders of
tomorrow."
In research in engineering and
social science, its departments
subsist on grants for
counterinsurgency and war
abroad, manipulation and
repression at home. Yet the very
dependency on government
funding which has brought about
the University's present fiscal
crisis can only be exacerbated by
bowing to threats to withhold $15
million in Defense Department
grants by maintaining ROTC on
campus. Universities across the
country that find themselves in
similar situations will be forced to
capitulate individually unless, as
.institutions, they oppose such
coercion collectively.
Only Private Opposition
The Administration and the
faculty have, however, continued
to voice merely private opposition
to the war in Indochina while
pleading powerlessness to change
the University's present
complicity in that war. Each
sector of the University, by
refusing to acknowledge political

responsibility for its collective'
actions, accepts the do facto
structure of its present
involvement.
As we saw with the Faculty
Senate, which refused to consider
the manner in which Stanford's
GM Stocks should be voted by the
Trustees, the only relevant
criterion to the evaluation of such
decisions must be the purely
"objective" standard of profit. All
the good intentions of individual
members remain impotent
without the abolition of that very
structure based on violent
exploitation and "justified" by
profit.
The sorts of things the
Administration would have us do
(write letters, take part in
non-disruptive sit-ins) are designed
to be ineffective, easily absorbed
by the system, hence sanctioned
by it. It is only when the system
reacts that we can be sure that we
have begun to effectively attack
it. Only when Pitzer brings on the
pigs and keeps them here can we
know that we are succeeding.
Sit-in Action
The Administration's actions
towards the sit-ins at the Old
Union indicate that it defines
anything left of apathy as violence
and that it will react accordingly.
Clearly, in its view, non-violent
protest cannot exist. Any action
that threatens the status quo will
be declared violent and put down
violently.
These are the rules, it seems; we
must challenge must
fight. If we think that sitting
around chanting peace will end
the violence and racism of this
University, if we think the chants
of Om will stop the research at
the Aero-and-Astro building or
close the business school, we are
crazy.
The non-violent attitude, then,
expressed by many members of
the University community can be
considered no more than moral
posturing unless it begins, as
Gandhi said, with
"non-cooperation with everything
humiliating," an unwillingness to
proceed with "business as usual"
in the face of continuing genocide
in Southeast Asia.
Their cries that property
damage on campus causes the
"alienation" of sympathetic
liberals and the "polarization" of
left and right must be seen as the
surprised reaction of a sector
which suddenly finds itself in the
wayâ€”it responds with the
self-indulgent plea for reasoned
arguments it previously ignored
and the condemnation of tactics
for which it can demonstrate no
alternative.
