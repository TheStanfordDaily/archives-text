# Campus Strike Called Today To Protest Cambodia Action
## 
### 
About 4000 people gathered in
Frosh Amphitheater last night and
shouted approval of a campus
wide strike today to protest U.S.
involvement in Cambodia.
Strike leaders are calling for
"no business as usual," and some
students are expected to picket
classes in an attempt to prevent
attendance.
Other actions include a 10:15
teach-in on ROTC and Southeast
Asia. It will be held on the
Dinkelspiel Auditorium steps and
will coincide with an emergency
meeting of the Academic Council
scheduled for 11 a.m.
Speaking on radio and later
before the faculty Senate
yesterday, President Pitzer urged
students, faculty, and staff in
classes and out, to discuss violence
in Cambodia and on campus.
He indicated it would be up to
professors whether to cancel
classes and up to students whether
to go.
Calls for the general campus
strike were heard in Frost as
speakers denounced President
Nixon's foreign policy in general

and the entry into Cambodia in
particular. The committee which
organized the Frost meeting
announced late last night that a
student strike will begin this
morning at 7:30 with
informational picketing in White
Plaza.
Non-Violence
The large crowd at Frost
showed little solidarity on the
issues of the hour. A contingent
of about 500 Off-ROTC radicals
made their presence known
throughout the evening. The rest
of the gathering showed mixed
reactions to various issues, but
were united in favorable response
to calls for non-violence.
Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
SLAC, dealt with the threat of
nuclear war and tactics for gaining
student demands. He criticized
the demand to "put your body on
the line." He stated, "the power
of man is through his mind, not
his body. If the power of your
body is all you have, then the
future is indeed dim."
Speaking later in the meeting,

Jim Shoch defended violent
action as the only way to achieve
revolution. "To be non-violent
today is to be more profoundly
violent than any other way," he
declared, "because it legitimized
the violence of the ruling class."
Professor John Lewis, speaking
first, attacked Nixon's Cambodia
decision charging it would lead to
an "inevitable bloodbath." He
asked, "Can he (Nixon) really
believe that we can clean out that
border area without response. Can
he believe that this will not lead
to wider war."
The rest of the meeting
revolved around choosing the best
way to bring pressure on leaders
at Stanford and in Washington.
Street Theater
The entire tone of the meeting
changed after a performance of
the acclaimed "Alice in
ROTC-land" street theatre
production, which ends in a call
for violent tactics. From then on,
speeches calling for immediate
and violent action were heard.
Fred Cohen addressed his
remarks to Nixon's speech.
"Anyone who watched that
speech tonight would realize that
the only reasonable thing to do is
riot."
Lenny Siegel went on to
explain the purpose of violent
tactics. "We aren't here to destroy
your education; we're here to
make it relevant. People who feel
that education means action
should go to the ROTC building
now."
During the middle of the
proceedings, Greg Betch called for
a nonviolent group to stymie the
efforts of violent protestors. Their
aim was to place their bodies
between the police and the
demonstrators to minimize the
conflict. Nearly 300 sympathizers
left together after the speeches
concluded.

and the entry into Cambodia in
particular. The committee which
organized the Frost meeting
announced late last night that a
student strike will begin this
morning at 7:30 with
informational picketing in White
Plaza.
Non-Violence
The large crowd at Frost
showed little solidarity on the
issues of the hour. A contingent
of about 500 Off-ROTC radicals
made their presence known
throughout the evening. The rest
of the gathering showed mixed
reactions to various issues, but
were united in favorable response
to calls for non-violence.
Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
SLAC, dealt with the threat of
nuclear war and tactics for gaining
student demands. He criticized
the demand to "put your body on
the line." He stated, "the power
of man is through his mind, not
his body. If the power of your
body is all you have, then the
future is indeed dim."
Speaking later in the meeting,

Jim Shoch defended violent
action as the only way to achieve
revolution. "To be non-violent
today is to be more profoundly
violent than any other way," he
declared, "because it legitimized
the violence of the ruling class."
Professor John Lewis, speaking
first, attacked Nixon's Cambodia
decision charging it would lead to
an "inevitable bloodbath." He
asked, "Can he (Nixon) really
believe that we can clean out that
border area without response. Can
he believe that this will not lead
to wider war."
The rest of the meeting
revolved around choosing the best
way to bring pressure on leaders
at Stanford and in Washington.
Street Theater
The entire tone of the meeting
changed after a performance of
the acclaimed "Alice in
ROTC-land" street theatre
production, which ends in a call
for violent tactics. From then on,
speeches calling for immediate
and violent action were heard.
Fred Cohen addressed his
remarks to Nixon's speech.
"Anyone who watched that
speech tonight would realize that
the only reasonable thing to do is
riot."
Lenny Siegel went on to
explain the purpose of violent
tactics. "We aren't here to destroy
your education; we're here to
make it relevant. People who feel
that education means action
should go to the ROTC building
now."
During the middle of the
proceedings, Greg Betch called for
a nonviolent group to stymie the
efforts of violent protestors. Their
aim was to place their bodies
between the police and the
demonstrators to minimize the
conflict. Nearly 300 sympathizers
left together after the speeches
concluded.

intersection of Campus Drive and Alvarado Row. Tear cas was used to keep
persons away.
About 4000 people gathered in
Frosh Amphitheater last night and
shouted approval of a campus
wide strike today to protest U.S.
involvement in Cambodia.
Strike leaders are calling for
"no business as usual," and some
students are expected to picket
classes in an attempt to prevent
attendance.
Other actions include a 10:15
teach-in on ROTC and Southeast
Asia. It will be held on the
Dinkelspiel Auditorium steps and
will coincide with an emergency
meeting of the Academic Council
scheduled for 11 a.m.
Speaking on radio and later
before the faculty Senate
yesterday, President Pitzer urged
students, faculty, and staff in
classes and out, to discuss violence
in Cambodia and on campus.
He indicated it would be up to
professors whether to cancel
classes and up to students whether
to go.
Calls for the general campus
strike were heard in Frost as
speakers denounced President
Nixon's foreign policy in general

and the entry into Cambodia in
particular. The committee which
organized the Frost meeting
announced late last night that a
student strike will begin this
morning at 7:30 with
