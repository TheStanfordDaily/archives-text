# The 						Life Of Lacrosse

"liules, for lacrossef" a twelve year old fun
responded to an unedified bystander . . "There
aren't any."
Which isn't exactly true, since it is illegal to
swing a stick at a player's head, or to block him
from behind, to mention a couple. Penalties can
range all the way up to three minutes,if you're not
careful.
Lacrosse, if you'll excuse the express■' ' a
goal-oriented activity, and the ten players on each
side can do almost anything to gel the firm rubber
ball into their opponent s net.
Stanford's lacrosse team, m spite of some
admittedly lackluster performances so far,
manages to do it fairly well, as its (i 2 record
would indicate.
Tomorrow the Palo Alto lacrosse club visits
Stanford ut 2:'.W, hoping to avenge an earlier 7 .3
loss to the Indians.
And in this case "Indians" is a particularly
appropriate nickname since lacrosse was originally
their game, apparently started in the Great Lakes
region, nobody-is-sure how many centuries ago. It
was also played with special gusto in the southeast,
where an early white observer filed this report.
"At that instance (the beginning) the struggle
ensued between players, who were six or seven
hundred in numbers, and were mutually
endeavoring to catch the ball in their sticks and
throw it home between their respective goals . . .
"Every mode is used that can be devised to
oppose progress of the foremost who is likely to

get possession of the ball; and these obstruct ions
meet in desperate resistance, which terminate in
violent scuffles and sometimes in fisticuffs, when
their sticks are dropped and the parties are
unmolested whilst settling mutters between
themselves ..."
The Creeks tool; the game so seriously that their
social structure included a division of two moities
among the clans, whose "chief function, at least in
historic times, was to determine sides for
intratown practice games," according to more
modern sources.
And still today the finest sticks that a lacrosse
devotee can buy are handmade by the Iroquois,
although large quantities of fiberglas and plastic
models arc increasingly dominating the market.
Despite its current status as Canada's national
game, lacrosse probably hud its greatest
significance in pre-contact times in the American
southeast, where, umong the Choctaw, for
example. . . games came to relate to the
ceremonial calendar . . . They came to be a part of
the religious complex of world renewal, a part of
the rituals designed to restore order in the universe
and to bring about the continued welfare of man
through another cycle of a year, "to borrow from
our modern experts again.
Hut though we foreigners may think lacrosse is a
lot of fun to watch, we certainly wouldn't want to
go so far as to make some sort of religious thing
out of it.
After all, we have football.

REMATCH: Stanford's lacrosse team gets a second crack at die exact same
identical Palo Alto club pictured here when it lost to the Indians 7-5 a few weeks
hack. Above, Chip Loveman (28) races to beat an unidentified opponent and
Wade Killefer (68), left, tangles widi another Palo Altoan with the help of two
oUier cohorts. Killefer, out for football practice, will not be playing widi the
lacrosse team tomorrow.

Which isn't exactly true, since it is illegal to
swing a stick at a player's head, or to block him
from behind, to mention a couple. Penalties can
range all the way up to three minutes,if you're not
careful.
Lacrosse, if you'll excuse the express■' ' a
goal-oriented activity, and the ten players on each
side can do almost anything to gel the firm rubber
ball into their opponent s net.
Stanford's lacrosse team, m spite of some
admittedly lackluster performances so far,

would indicate.
Tomorrow the Palo Alto lacrosse club visits

loss to the Indians.
And in this case "Indians" is a particularly
appropriate nickname since lacrosse was originally
their game, apparently started in the Great Lakes
region, nobody-is-sure how many centuries ago. It
was also played with special gusto in the southeast,
where an early white observer filed this report.
"At that instance (the beginning) the struggle
ensued between players, who were six or seven
hundred in numbers, and were mutually
endeavoring to catch the ball in their sticks and
throw it home between their respective goals . . .
"Every mode is used that can be devised to
oppose progress of the foremost who is likely to

get possession of the ball; and these obstruct ions
meet in desperate resistance, which terminate in
violent scuffles and sometimes in fisticuffs, when
their sticks are dropped and the parties are
unmolested whilst settling mutters between
themselves ..."

social structure included a division of two moities

historic times, was to determine sides for
intratown practice games," according to more
modern sources.
And still today the finest sticks that a lacrosse
devotee can buy are handmade by the Iroquois,
although large quantities of fiberglas and plastic
models arc increasingly dominating the market.
Despite its current status as Canada's national
game, lacrosse probably hud its greatest
significance in pre-contact times in the American
