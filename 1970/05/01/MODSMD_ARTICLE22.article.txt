# Crew: Hours Long, Rewards Lean

### DOUG WILSON 
Kurt Schoknecht gets up at 5
a.;n. Monday through Friday,
spends from 6-7:30 a.m. rowing a
boat on the waters of Redwood
City Yacht Harbour, and is back
en campus by 8 a.m.

This is somewhat of a change
from fall quarter, when he ran
three times a week and lifted
weights three times a week, in
addition to afternoon rowing
Monday through Friday; it is also
easier than his winter quarter
schedule, when a 6 a.m. Saturday

row was added to the other
masochistic exercises.
Kurt Schoknect, one of eight
freshmen crew members left from
an original group of 44, could not
understand why the other
thirty-six weren't still around.
Kurt and his eight insane
teammates compose the freshman
crew team, and it is unlikely that
anybody else in the class of 1973
will join them in the next three
years on the junior varsity or
varsity crew squads.
"After you're a freshman, you
usually don't join the program
unless you're a transfer,"
Schoknecht said in an afternoon
interview. (Surprising. The eyes
were not yet glazed,and the words
were still spoken in a clear and
lucid manner.)
This Saturday, the freshmen
meet Santa Clara in Redwood
Harbor; the Varsity takes on the
Cal crew in a final dual match on
May 8, a week before the Western
Sprints at Long Beach on May 15.
The national row (isn't that what
you call it?) takes place in
Syracuse, N.Y. in late May, with
teams from such highly-ranked
schools as Harvard, Yale, Fenn
and Washington also competing.
Double Winner
The varsity crew has thus far
won two races (against St. Mary's
and Oregon), and has placed in
three other races, including
matches with the Washington and
southern California schools.
Top oarsmen include Captain
Don Connelley, Bernie Thurber
and Bill Durham. Stroke for the
Stanford crew is Harry Waters.
'"Hie strokeman? Is that the
guy that yells 'Stroke!' 'Stroke!" I
asked. (My eyes are becoming
iglazed, my words tumbling
out unclearly)
Victory Drink
Schoknecht understood. "No,
the strokeman rows at the eight
position and sets the time for the
strokes. The coxswain (Mike

Yoshimura for the varsity) is the
lightweight guy whose main job is
to steer, relay information as to
the position of the other boats,
and tell you when to sprint. If
you win a race, the coxswain gets
thrown into the water."
Crew members have lots of
interesting little traditions. Each
team bets their shirts on the
outcome of a race, and the
ultimate winner gets their
opponents' shirts.
(My eyelids are heavy, and the
urge to subject the conversation
to puns about shirts is irresistable.
Schoknecht sits calmly back and
continues:)
"Getting up at 5 every morning
makes you really sharp for your
nine-o'clock's, but by 2 p.m.,
you're getting pretty dull.
Needless to say, it slaughters your
nights."
Tough Break
The strenuous work schedule
outlined at the beginning of this
article did not let up over spring
vacation. "We had to stay around
all spring break," Schoknecht
said, "and we rowed every day,
three times a day, except for
Good Friday and Easter Sunday.
It got to be a whole way of
life—eat sleep and row."
(My eyes are propped open
with my pen, when I am not
writing; the urge to make this a
religious story is overpowering.)
"Sometimes we row from the
Redwood Harbour salt pile to San
Mateo Bridge and back," he
continued, "which is 16 miles
when the water's nice."
(The pain in my arms is
unbearable; I can no longer lift
the pen to write, and visions of
salt dunes spin in my head.)
"Oh, yeah, the coaches. Will
Condon is a law student, and
although he is the varsity coach, I
don't think he ever made first
boat when he was at Stanford.
The freshman coach, Joe

Bracewell, is a graduate student in
business. He was the stroke of the
Harvard lightweights, and has
never been in a losing shell. Both
coach for free."
(It is no use any longer. I am in
a state of total collapse, and
Schoknecht jogs away.)
Good morning, crew persons.
Welcome back to campus.

position and sets the time for the
strokes. The coxswain (Mike

Yoshimura for the varsity) is the
lightweight guy whose main job is
to steer, relay information as to
the position of the other boats,
and tell you when to sprint. If
you win a race, the coxswain gets
thrown into the water."
Crew members have lots of
interesting little traditions. Each
team bets their shirts on the
outcome of a race, and the
ultimate winner gets their
opponents' shirts.
(My eyelids are heavy, and the
urge to subject the conversation
to puns about shirts is irresistable.
Schoknecht sits calmly back and
continues:)
"Getting up at 5 every morning
makes you really sharp for your
nine-o'clock's, but by 2 p.m.,
you're getting pretty dull.
Needless to say, it slaughters your
nights."
Tough Break
The strenuous work schedule
outlined at the beginning of this
article did not let up over spring
vacation. "We had to stay around
all spring break," Schoknecht
said, "and we rowed every day,
three times a day, except for
Good Friday and Easter Sunday.
It got to be a whole way of
life—eat sleep and row."
(My eyes are propped open
with my pen, when I am not
writing; the urge to make this a
religious story is overpowering.)
"Sometimes we row from the
Redwood Harbour salt pile to San
Mateo Bridge and back," he
continued, "which is 16 miles
when the water's nice."
(The pain in my arms is
unbearable; I can no longer lift
the pen to write, and visions of
salt dunes spin in my head.)
"Oh, yeah, the coaches. Will
Condon is a law student, and
although he is the varsity coach, I
don't think he ever made first
boat when he was at Stanford.
The freshman coach, Joe

Bracewell, is a graduate student in
business. He was the stroke of the
Harvard lightweights, and has
never been in a losing shell. Both
coach for free."
(It is no use any longer. I am in
a state of total collapse, and
Schoknecht jogs away.)
Good morning, crew persons.
Welcome back to campus.

Kurt Schoknecht gets up at 5
a.;n. Monday through Friday,
spends from 6-7:30 a.m. rowing a
boat on the waters of Redwood
City Yacht Harbour, and is back
en campus by 8 a.m.

This is somewhat of a change
from fall quarter, when he ran
three times a week and lifted
weights three times a week, in
addition to afternoon rowing
Monday through Friday; it is also
easier than his winter quarter
schedule, when a 6 a.m. Saturday

row was added to the other
masochistic exercises.
Kurt Schoknect, one of eight
freshmen crew members left from
an original group of 44, could not
understand why the other
thirty-six weren't still around.
Kurt and his eight insane
teammates compose the freshman
crew team, and it is unlikely that
anybody else in the class of 1973
will join them in the next three
years on the junior varsity or
varsity crew squads.
"After you're a freshman, you
usually don't join the program
unless you're a transfer,"
Schoknecht said in an afternoon
interview. (Surprising. The eyes
were not yet glazed,and the words
were still spoken in a clear and
lucid manner.)
This Saturday, the freshmen
meet Santa Clara in Redwood
Harbor; the Varsity takes on the
Cal crew in a final dual match on
May 8, a week before the Western
Sprints at Long Beach on May 15.
The national row (isn't that what
you call it?) takes place in
Syracuse, N.Y. in late May, with
teams from such highly-ranked
schools as Harvard, Yale, Fenn
and Washington also competing.
Double Winner
The varsity crew has thus far
won two races (against St. Mary's
and Oregon), and has placed in
three other races, including
matches with the Washington and
southern California schools.
Top oarsmen include Captain
Don Connelley, Bernie Thurber
and Bill Durham. Stroke for the
Stanford crew is Harry Waters.
'"Hie strokeman? Is that the
guy that yells 'Stroke!' 'Stroke!" I
asked. (My eyes are becoming
iglazed, my words tumbling
out unclearly)
Victory Drink
Schoknecht understood. "No,
the strokeman rows at the eight
position and sets the time for the
strokes. The coxswain (Mike

Yoshimura for the varsity) is the
lightweight guy whose main job is
