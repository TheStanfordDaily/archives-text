# Surprise! Cal Track Choice
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Over the last few weeks some
interesting confrontations have
taken place in the beautiful city
of Berkeley, and the balance of
power between the police and
demonstrators was changed often.
Clearly no one has been too
securely "in the favorite's role,"
so to speak.
Tomorrow, not too far from
the scene of these battles, there
will be another confrontation of
sorts, but this time there will be a
decided favorite when the
Stanford and California track
teams will square off at 1:15 at
Edwards Stadium in the 75th
renewal of the Big Meet.
All year long the Cards have
been plagued by a failure to pick
up points in the sprints. But if
they think they've been in trouble
before, the worst could still be
ahead. The Indians leading
sprinter, A 1 Dyson, will not run
tomorrow and Rick Tipton is also
doubtful. But even if they did run
it's questionable whether they
could dent the Bear's sprint
strength anyway.
Cal's leading sprinter, freshman
Isaac Curtis, isn't expected to run
but he probably won't be needed.
The Bears will be favored to
sweep both the 100 and 220 with
the following contingent of
speedsters: Eddie Hart (9.4, 20.7)
Dave Masters (9.5, 20.9) and Don
Couser (9.6, 21.4).
The 440 should also be swept
by Cal. And, taking these facts
into consideration, it doesn't take
a track expert to figure out who
will be favored in the relays.
Possibly the Cards could pick
up a third in one of these events
and thus trail by maybe only 43
points after the sprints. The
hurdles will give the Tribe a little
better opportunity to score. Cal
has three hurdlers at 14.2 in the
highs, but the Indians' Bill
Griffith has also run a 14.2. In the

intermediates, Randy White
(52.4) will duel with Cal's Roddy
Lee (52.4) and Bob McLennan
(51.7).
Moving into the distances we
find Stanford's biggest hopes.
Jordan is expected to shuffle his
forces as he did against
Washington and he might even
have some of his aces double. He
may be reluctant to double his
stars, though, since a San
Francisco newspaper claims he is
"saving" them for the NCAA's
and "doesn't want to hurt their
conditioning."
The Bears do have some
formidable runners in halfmiler
John Drew (1:51.0), miler Cliff
West (4:07.3) and two miler Bob
Waldon (9.05.6), but the Stanford
contingent of Duncan Macdonald
(1.52.4, 4:05.6), Don Kardong
(4:08.1, 8:45.2) and Greg Brock
(4:09.8, 8:45.2) should pick up a
lot of points. The steeplechase
will also be a Stanford event with
Brook Thomas (9:02.2), a big
favorite.
The field events will also
provide some of the closer
contests of the afternoon.
Stanford will be a decided favorite
in the pole vault, while Cal should
win the high jump and javelin. In
the triple jump, each team's
leading scorers—Cal's Jim Fraser
(51-1%) and Stanford's Allen
Meredith (50-11V4) —will square
off.
The shot put, with T.C. Jones
(S-57.5) and Terry Lewis
(C-56-9Vi); the long jump, with
Tom Anderson (S-24-5V2) and Jim
Fraser (C-25-V2); and the discus,
with steve Davis (S-176-9) and
Jim Penrose (C-184-8) should all
be close events.
All things considered, Cal
should be a 25 to 50 point
favorite tomorrow. The official
Daily prediction is Cal by 32
points.

interesting confrontations have
taken place in the beautiful city
of Berkeley, and the balance of
power between the police and
demonstrators was changed often.
Clearly no one has been too
securely "in the favorite's role,"
so to speak.
Tomorrow, not too far from
the scene of these battles, there
will be another confrontation of
sorts, but this time there will be a
decided favorite when the
Stanford and California track
teams will square off at 1:15 at
Edwards Stadium in the 75th
renewal of the Big Meet.
All year long the Cards have
been plagued by a failure to pick
up points in the sprints. But if
they think they've been in trouble
before, the worst could still be
ahead. The Indians leading
sprinter, A 1 Dyson, will not run
tomorrow and Rick Tipton is also
doubtful. But even if they did run
it's questionable whether they
could dent the Bear's sprint
strength anyway.
Cal's leading sprinter, freshman
Isaac Curtis, isn't expected to run
but he probably won't be needed.
The Bears will be favored to
sweep both the 100 and 220 with
the following contingent of
speedsters: Eddie Hart (9.4, 20.7)
Dave Masters (9.5, 20.9) and Don
Couser (9.6, 21.4).
The 440 should also be swept
by Cal. And, taking these facts
into consideration, it doesn't take
a track expert to figure out who
will be favored in the relays.
Possibly the Cards could pick
up a third in one of these events
and thus trail by maybe only 43
points after the sprints. The
hurdles will give the Tribe a little
better opportunity to score. Cal
has three hurdlers at 14.2 in the
highs, but the Indians' Bill
Griffith has also run a 14.2. In the

intermediates, Randy White
(52.4) will duel with Cal's Roddy
Lee (52.4) and Bob McLennan
(51.7).
Moving into the distances we
find Stanford's biggest hopes.
Jordan is expected to shuffle his
forces as he did against
Washington and he might even
have some of his aces double. He
may be reluctant to double his
stars, though, since a San
Francisco newspaper claims he is
"saving" them for the NCAA's
and "doesn't want to hurt their
conditioning."
The Bears do have some
formidable runners in halfmiler
John Drew (1:51.0), miler Cliff
West (4:07.3) and two miler Bob
Waldon (9.05.6), but the Stanford
contingent of Duncan Macdonald
(1.52.4, 4:05.6), Don Kardong
(4:08.1, 8:45.2) and Greg Brock
(4:09.8, 8:45.2) should pick up a
lot of points. The steeplechase
will also be a Stanford event with
Brook Thomas (9:02.2), a big
favorite.
The field events will also
provide some of the closer
contests of the afternoon.
Stanford will be a decided favorite
in the pole vault, while Cal should
win the high jump and javelin. In
the triple jump, each team's
leading scorers—Cal's Jim Fraser
(51-1%) and Stanford's Allen
Meredith (50-11V4) —will square
off.
The shot put, with T.C. Jones
(S-57.5) and Terry Lewis
(C-56-9Vi); the long jump, with
Tom Anderson (S-24-5V2) and Jim
Fraser (C-25-V2); and the discus,
with steve Davis (S-176-9) and
Jim Penrose (C-184-8) should all
be close events.
All things considered, Cal
should be a 25 to 50 point
favorite tomorrow. The official
Daily prediction is Cal by 32
points.
