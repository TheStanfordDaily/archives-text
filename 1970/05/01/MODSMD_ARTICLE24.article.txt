# To SC, UCLA
## Golfers Southbound 
### 
Having notched a convincing
victory in last week's U.S.
Collegiate Invitational, Stanford's
golf team travels south today and
Saturday to tee off against UCLA
and the always tough USC
Trojans.
The Indians have lost but two
matches this season, both when
number one man, Tom Watson,
was fighting to make the cut at
the Masters in Augusta.
With Watson back, the Tribe
should be tough. Gary Vanier and
John Beers, a freshman, have
proven that Stanford golf is more
than a one man show. Vanier
upset Watson to capture the

Invitational, and Beers finished a
strong third, only three strokes
back.
Larry Cram and Pete Harpster
finished in the money, tieing for
fifth, eight strokes off the pace.
They, along with Tom Keelin are
expected to keep Stanford's team
score down in this weekend's
action with SC and the Bruins.
USC, winners of last year's
Invitational, will host the Tribe
this afternoon on their home
course at the LA Country Club.
Watson and Vanier and Company
will be gunning after last year's
Invitational individual champ,
Gary Sanders.
