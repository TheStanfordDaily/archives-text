# Hoop Merger
## 
### 
NEW YORK(AP) The National
Basketball Association has
agreed to merge with the
American Basketball
Association, the Associated
Press learned Thursday night.
A high official, who
disclosed the agreement, would
not disclose how much the
ABA would pay the older
league, stressing that he could
not elaborate since the NBA
Player's Association is seeking
an injunction in court against
the merger and that officials
were ordered not to talk on the
subject until this was cleared
up.
Terms of the agreement call
for full integration of the
leagues along the lines set up
by the NFL and the AFL over
a three-year span.
