# Job On AAU Europe Team
## 
### 
Brian Job, Stanford freshman
and holder of two collegiate and
two American swimming records,
has been named to the AAU
men's team which will tour
Europe this summer.
Job joins high school distance
freestyler John Kinsella,
backstroker Mike Stamm and
Indiana freshman Gary Hall on
the four-man squad which will
visit Austria and Czechoslovakia
and compete with top swimmers
from those countries.
In his first year of competition
at Stanford, Job was undefeated
in dual meet competition,
climaxing an outstanding season
at the NCAA Championships in
Utah last March with two
record-setting victories in the 100-
and 200-yd breaststroke. He re-set
those records at the AAU
Championships in Cincinnati in
early April; Job's selection to
represent the United States
abroad this summer was based on
his performances in that meet.
