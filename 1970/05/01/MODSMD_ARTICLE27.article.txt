# Oregons Here For Twinbills

### JOHN ARTHUR 
Undaunted by wars, riots and a
less-than nifty Pac-8 record, the
varsity baseball team resumes
league action this weekend with a
pair of doubleheaders against
Oregon and Oregon State at
Sunken Diamond. Both events
start at noon.
For the first time this season
the northern and southern
divisions of the conference meet
for interdivisional play and
although the stakes might not
seem as high as they've been thus
far, Stanford "has nothing to
save," in the words of Coach Ray
Young.
The Cards' two aces, Steve
Dunning and Phil Keller, will go
against Oregon today, with Bob
Kammeyer and Bruce Schoen
scheduled for duty Saturday.
Lefthander Jim Coate, winner
Tuesday over USF, will be the
prime man in relief.
Dunning, who has 126
strikeouts in 86 2/3 innings and a
1.35 ERA, ranks first in the
nation in both wins and
strikeouts.
Seeking to bolster a less than
overwhelming offense, Young this
week brought several players up
to the varsity from the soph-frosh
squad. Tom Williams, who's single
scored the winning runs Tuesday,
will probably face any right
handed hurlers this weekend, and
Pat Rusco will occupy the right
field spot against southpaws, Gary
Osterhout is a possibility at
second base when Dunning
pitches, with Dick Borchers at
third.
The Ducks and the OSU
Beavers are still alive in the north,
but neither are considered a threat
to the south's finest. OSU, 11-9
on the year, has been getting solid
hitting from outfielder Dave
Wiggins (1.346) and catcher Ryan
Goodell. But rain has curtailed
their league schedule to three
games.
Oregon, coming off a
doubleheader sweep over

Washington, got some decent
pitching last week after earlier
problems in that area, and are led
by shortstop Jim Van Wyck at
.393.
