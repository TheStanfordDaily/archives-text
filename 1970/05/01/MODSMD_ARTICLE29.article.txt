Army ROTC plans to submit
courses for credit continued
yesterday despite strong
campus-wide opposition to U.S.
involvement in Cambodia and new
student legal action.
According to Army Colonel
Stanley Ramey, the Army ROTC
will submit three courses to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, seeking three units of
academic credit for each. Today is
the deadline for submitting the
proposals to the committee.
The courses proposed are
World Military History, taught by
Capt. Anderson, Foundations of
National Power, taught by Lt.
Eckart, and Management and
Leadership, taught by Major
Burbery.
Cambodia Telegrams
Signatures were collected
yesterday on a letter to President
Nixon opposing the further U.S.
involvement in Cambodia.
In addition, Stanford's top two
academic officers, acting
independently, wired President
Nixon their strong dissent with
the expansion of U.S. involvement
into Cambodia.
Provost Richard Lyman said,
"Expansion of the war to
Cambodia is a tragic disaster.
Protest American involvement of
any kind in Cambodian war. Peace
at home depends peace in
Southeast Asia."
President Kenneth Pitzer's
telegram to both Nixon and
Senator Fulbright referred to the
war as "a mistake of the gravest
kind." He further urged Fulbright

to initiate hearings on the action
which would involve elements of
university communities.

lacerations and mild head injuries.
Trail Delayed
A hearing for the "Stanford
Five" has been put off until next
Wednesday so that defendants will
have the aid of a public defender.
The plea for a public defender had
been denied earlier but was
granted by the judge yesterday.
When leaving the courthouse

yesterday morning, Janet Weiss,
one of the defendants was served
a warrant and arrested by two
police officers.
She was charged with
interference with a police officer
in a demonstration about a month
ago at the Elma Engineering strike
in East Palo Alto. She was
booked, jailed and released
shortly after 1 p.m. on $250 bail.
Marc Sapir, a medical school
student, was also arrested
yesterday morning. According to
Lt. Phil Ray, press officer for the
Palo Alto Police department, two
plainclothes policemen in an
unmarked car were on regulai
patrol, unaware they were on the
street where Sapir lived.
The driver saw a man with a
shotgun in the rear-view mirror.
The car made a U-turn and the
officers stopped in front of the
house and Sapir pointed a loaded
12-gauge shotgun at them.
The police identified
themselves and Sapir put down his
gun. A third policeman in uniform
was called to the scene and Sapir
was booked for assault with a

deadly weapon. Yesterday
afternoon no formal charge had
been filed, and Sapir was being
held on $5000 bail.
Army ROTC plans to submit
courses for credit continued
yesterday despite strong
campus-wide opposition to U.S.
involvement in Cambodia and new
student legal action.
According to Army Colonel
Stanley Ramey, the Army ROTC
will submit three courses to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, seeking three units of
academic credit for each. Today is
the deadline for submitting the
proposals to the committee.
The courses proposed are
World Military History, taught by
Capt. Anderson, Foundations of
National Power, taught by Lt.
Eckart, and Management and
Leadership, taught by Major
Burbery.
Cambodia Telegrams
Signatures were collected
yesterday on a letter to President
Nixon opposing the further U.S.
involvement in Cambodia.
In addition, Stanford's top two
academic officers, acting
independently, wired President
Nixon their strong dissent with
the expansion of U.S. involvement
into Cambodia.
Provost Richard Lyman said,
"Expansion of the war to
Cambodia is a tragic disaster.
Protest American involvement of
any kind in Cambodian war. Peace
at home depends peace in
Southeast Asia."
President Kenneth Pitzer's
telegram to both Nixon and
Senator Fulbright referred to the
war as "a mistake of the gravest
kind." He further urged Fulbright

to initiate hearings on the action
which would involve elements of
university communities.
Arrests and Injuries
Information available
yesterday afternoon from North
County Jail said three of the 15
people arrested Wednesday night
have been released.
Steven Tipps and Patty Nealy
were released on $125 bail and
Bernard Mack, arrested on charges
of assault with a deadly weapon,
was released on $1,000 bail. Three
of the girls arrested will be
transferred to Elmwood facility
for women in Milpitas.
In addition, two students spent
Wednesday night in Cowell Health
Center suffering from contusions,
lacerations and mild head injuries.
