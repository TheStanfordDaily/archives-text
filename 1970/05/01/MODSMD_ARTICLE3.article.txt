# Nixon Announcement
## Gls Attack Reds In Cambodia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon dramatically announced
Thursday night that American
ground troops have attacked - at
his order - a Communist base
complex extending 20 miles into
Cambodia.
Nixon told a nationwide radio
and television audience that he
would stand by his order even at
the risk of becoming a one-term
President.
'Not An Invasion'
"This is not an invasion of
Cambodia," he asserted. "The
areas in which these attacks will
be launched are completely

occupied and "or.trolled by North
Vietnamese forces. Our purpose is
not to occupy the areas. Once
enemy forces are driven out of
these sanctuaries and their
military supplies destroyed, we
will withdraw."
The attack, commanded by
American officers and augmented
by units of the South Vietnamese
army, began about 4 p.m. PDT -
two hours before Nixon addressed
the nation and one hour before he
met with Democratic and
Republican leaders of Congress to
discuss his decision.
Minutes after Nixon finished
speaking, word came from Saigon

that U.S. B-52 bombers attacked
the Communist high command
headquarters 20 miles inside
Cambodia. The attack, on Friday
morning in Southeast Asia, was
the first reported made by the
Stratofortresses inside Cambodia.
Sources said thousands of
American helicopter-borne air
cavalrymen from the U.S. Ist Air
Cavalry Division and South
Vietnamese troopers penetrated
20 miles inside Cambodia to
attack the headquarters of the
Central Office for South
Vietnam-COSVN-the Communist
high command that directs the
war in South Vietnam.
This headquarters is just above
an area shown on military maps as
the "Fishhook," a key infiltration
corridor leading from Cambodia
about 70 miles northwest of
Saigon.
Attack Desired
The operation was launched at
dawn Friday. There were no
immediate reports of contact.
American field commanders
had long desired to attack the
COSVN headquarters.
A White House source said
several thousand U.S. combat
troops were involved in the
operation, which he said is

expected to last six weeks to two
months.
This official said the new move
would not affect Nixon's April 20
announcement that at least
150,000 American troops will be
withdrawn from South Vietnam
by May 1971.
Nixon said, "I have concluded
the time has come for action"
because he argued, the enemy's
moves "in the last 10 days clearly
endanger the lives of Americans
who are in Vietnam now and
would constitute an unacceptable
risk to those who would be there
after our withdrawal of 150,000.
A Republican senator who has
been a strong backer of Nixon's
policies said the decision will
bi. an adverse public reaction
and a sharp downturn in Nixon's
support.
'Adverse Reaction'
Sen. Robert J. Dole, R-Kan.,
said "There is no doubt in my
mind the public reaction is going
to be adverse.
He and other GOP senators
received a briefing from
administration officials on
Nixon's speech at the Capitol.
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.,
a longtime critic of the war, left
the room shaking his head.
"Unbelievable," he exclaimed.
But Senate Republican Leader
Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, who
had remained silent after initial
announcement Wednesday of U.S.
backed South Vietnamese
operations in Cambodia, said
"There has never been a time
when it is more important to hold
one's emotional fire and to trust
the President whoÂ« alone has all
the facts."
"I'm with the President," said
Sen. Paul Fannin, R-Ariz.
"It was a fine presentation,"
said Sen. J. Caleb Boggs, R-Del.
But Sen. Charles E. Goodell,
R-N.Y., who has called for
withdrawal of all U.S. troops from
Vietnam by Dec. 1, said "It was
pretty ghastly."
