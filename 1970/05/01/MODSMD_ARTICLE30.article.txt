# ROTC Petition
## 
### GREG WHITE 
If 500 signatures of students
can be gathered by Friday, the
question of ROTC credit will be
reconsidered at next week's
faculty Senate meeting.
Students living in Arroyo and
Cedro, dismayed that the
Academic Senate has no current
plans to review the ROTC
situation, are trying to force such
consideration through the use of
petition
According to Senate rules, "A
matter shall be placed on the
regular agenda by the Steering
Committee if a request to do so
is . . . supported by a petition
signed by 500 or more Stanford
students."
Steve Abrahams, a leader of
the drive, said the effort deeloped
when Arroyo-Cedre students met
and realized "a lot of people had
talked about reopening the
Academic Senate but nobody had
really done anything. We decided
that it would be easier to get 500
signatures than to talk to 14
Senate members." Another way
to put items on the Senate agenda
is by a petition of 1 •! Senators.
History professor Philip
Dawson, a member of the Senate
who has been in contact with the
petition group, commented that
"every member of the Senate is
deeply concerned about the
polarization around campus." He
had no predictions on what
Senate action might be taken,
saying "what we would do
depends upon the nature of the
proposition."
Heavy Schedule
Dawson added that the Senate
has a very heavy schedule this

quarter and "will probably bo
meeting every week anyway" so
the matter is sure to be placed on
next week's Thursday session if
the 500 signatures are collected.
Abrahams is confident that
enough students will sign "judging
by the response around Wilbur."
His group is also concerned
about student - 112 acull y
communication, especially as "a
tot of people in the Senate really
want students to come in and
talk." There will be a meeting in
Arroyo tonight with three
Senators to talk about ways to do
this.
However, Abrahams is fearful
that "it would be really hard to
get something through the
Senate ... if there is a lot of
trashing of windows this next
week. A lot of faculty would be
turned off for good," he said.
The text of the petition read:
"We petition the Academic Senate
to re-open the question of ROTC
at Stanford for discussion at the
meeting of May 7. We propose
that the Senate vote on some new
proposals that explicitly work
toward the elimination of the
present system of ROTC.
"We support the following
specific proposals; 1) That a
policy be formulated giving
primary consideration to the
student referendum in all future
decisions concerning ROTC. 2)
That ROTC be taken off campus
if the punitive clause is not
removed by September, 1970.
"We encourage all faculty
members to seriously consider
these proposals and any others
that work toward the
above-mentioned goa 1."

The text of the petition read:
"We petition the Academic Senate
to re-open the question of ROTC
at Stanford for discussion at the
meeting of May 7. We propose
that the Senate vote on some new
proposals that explicitly work
toward the elimination of the
present system of ROTC.
"We support the following
specific proposals; 1) That a
policy be formulated giving
primary consideration to the
student referendum in all future
decisions concerning ROTC. 2)
That ROTC be taken off campus
if the punitive clause is not
removed by September, 1970.
"We encourage all faculty
members to seriously consider
these proposals and any others
that work toward the
above-mentioned goa 1."
If 500 signatures of students
can be gathered by Friday, the
question of ROTC credit will be
reconsidered at next week's
faculty Senate meeting.
Students living in Arroyo and
Cedro, dismayed that the
Academic Senate has no current
plans to review the ROTC
situation, are trying to force such
consideration through the use of
petition
According to Senate rules, "A
matter shall be placed on the
regular agenda by the Steering
Committee if a request to do so
is . . . supported by a petition
signed by 500 or more Stanford
students."
Steve Abrahams, a leader of
the drive, said the effort deeloped
when Arroyo-Cedre students met
and realized "a lot of people had
talked about reopening the
Academic Senate but nobody had
really done anything. We decided
that it would be easier to get 500
signatures than to talk to 14
Senate members." Another way
to put items on the Senate agenda
is by a petition of 1 •! Senators.
History professor Philip
Dawson, a member of the Senate
who has been in contact with the
petition group, commented that
"every member of the Senate is
deeply concerned about the
polarization around campus." He
had no predictions on what
Senate action might be taken,
saying "what we would do
depends upon the nature of the
proposition."
Heavy Schedule
Dawson added that the Senate
has a very heavy schedule this

quarter and "will probably bo
meeting every week anyway" so
the matter is sure to be placed on
next week's Thursday session if
the 500 signatures are collected.
Abrahams is confident that
enough students will sign "judging
by the response around Wilbur."
His group is also concerned
about student - 112 acull y
communication, especially as "a
tot of people in the Senate really
want students to come in and
talk." There will be a meeting in
Arroyo tonight with three
Senators to talk about ways to do
this.
However, Abrahams is fearful
that "it would be really hard to
get something through the
Senate ... if there is a lot of
trashing of windows this next
week. A lot of faculty would be
turned off for good," he said.
