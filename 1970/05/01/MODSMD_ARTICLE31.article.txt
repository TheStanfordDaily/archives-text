# SJC's Role
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
This is the first in a series of two articles on the Stanford Judicial
Council. The second article will appear next week.

"Stanford has perhaps done more than any other university to
strengthen its internal judicial system."—Senator Charles Percy during
1969 Senate hearings on campus unrest.
Most students find it surprising that the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) was discussed in some detail last summer by United States
Senators. Often taken for granted, its successes and failures involve
the prospects for continued university independence from federal
interference in handling campus disruptions.
Hear, for example, the words of Senator Karl Mundt: "American
taxpayers should insist that members of Congress take responsibility
to see that public money spent on education is properly used. Where
standards and guidelines are set properly as you are working it out at
Stanford—with your consultation, with your faculty, with your
judicial council fine." But "where they are not done that way," we
can't just say "it didn't work out right."
This year's SJC will face its major test in upcoming Off-ROTC
demonstration hearings. In addition to 32 students whose names have
already been sent to the SJC for previous Off-ROTC disruptions, the
university will almost certainly prosecute some participants in last
Thursday's Old Union sit-in, according to Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley. "A great many pictures," says Bulkeley, were taken at the
sit-in, but the process of identification is not yet underway. Many of
the demonstrators were wearing masks.
For students and four faculty sit on the SJC. The ninth member, a
chairman chosen from the law school, votes only to break ties. The
council operates under a charter approved in 1968 by both the
Academic Council and student referendum
Past Problems
Last year's council was plagued by charges of unfairness levelled by
defendants in the Encina sit-in cases. Although last year's SJC
Chairman, Law Professor Jack Friedenthal, contends that the
defendants were seeking any excuse to attack the proceedings, he
concurs with the virtually unanimous opinion that the hearings had at
least the appearance of bias. He believes, though, that the hearings
were in substance "eminently fair."
The main complaint last year was the fact that the SJC assumed
the role of prosecuter, judge, and jury. The council recommended last
June that the Judicial Charter be amended to provide for a University
prosecuter, responsible to the president,in all "formal proceedings."
The Committee of 15 studies such changes, but no amendment has
been passed.
In the absence of a formal amendment this year's SJC Chairman,
Law Professor Marc Franklin, told the Administration that he was
unwilling to function as prosecuter in "adversary cases." The
Administration agreed to appoint a prosecuter if necessary. Whether a
case is an "adversary" one is determined primarily by the chairman's
"sixth sense," says Franklin."You would have to be blind" not to so
classify the Off-ROTC hearings."
Prosecuters
Though the council has a heavy schedule of Honor Code and petty
theft cases since January, there have as yet been no adversary
hearings. In non-political cases, says Franklin, the defendant generally
does not consider himself to be in confrontation with the
Administration.
The Administration is now searching for a prosecuter for the
Off-ROTC cases and, according to legal advisor to the president James
Siena, will select one within a few days. Law students are among those
who have been approached. Someone outside the university may
ultimately be chosen, says Siena, although the Administration would
prefer a member of the community.
Since SJC decisions are recommendations to the president, Says
Siena, it would be "inappropriate" to choose someone from the
President's or Provost's office. The Dean of Students is eliminated by
a clause in the Judicial Charter.
Selection of a prosecuter is apparently the only obstacle delaying
the hearings. The Administration has accumulated sufficient evidence
for presentation, according to Siena, and no further investigation will
be conducted unless the prosecuter initiates it.
Double Jeopardy
Whether the new format will eliminate major complaints of
unfairness is not yet clear. At least one defendant has already charged
that students who face both civil court and SJC action are being
placed in double jeopardy.
The Judicial Charter deals specifically with such situations. The
relevant clause provides that: "In instances of conviction understate
or Federal law, the SJC shall not assess penalties if the circumstances
of the case indicate that such penalties would be inequitable to the
defendant when imposed in addition to civil or criminal penalties.
This limitation shall not apply when SJC proceedings are deemed
necessary by the SJC to protect the University community from risk
of harm. Nothing in this paragraph, however, shall be interpreted as
barring or delaying action by the SJC on a case because a similar
charge is pending before a civil court."
An identical paragraph appears in the ASSU Constitution.
Chairman Franklin commented though, that he would be in a
"difficult position" if SJC and civil court cases were proceeding
simultaneously.
Pitzer's Role
SJC decisions are not in themselves binding, but are only
recommendations to the president. In its two years of existence,
however, no SJC decision has been altered by the president, other
than a clarification of a vague probationary sentence. When the SJC
disagreed with that clarification, Pitzer rescinded the objectionable
clause.
SJC member Gene Franklin, an Electrical Engineering professor,
believes that the president does not hold such overruling power "de
facto." If Pitzer overturned an SJC decision. Franklin said last
Monday, "the outcry would be such that the charter would collapse."
"I would resign," he added.
On the other hand SJC member James Ware, a student, feels that
"since Pitzer has ultimate responsibility, he should be the final
arbiter."
SJC member Lynn Karowsky, also a student, says he would be
"greatly offended" if Pitzer overruled the SJC, but would not resign.
Members
The present SJC is composed of faculty members Gene Franklin,
David Halliburton, Leonard Horowitz, and John Schwartz, and
students Fred Dietz, Karowsky, Renton Rolph, and Ware, plus
chairman Marc Franklin. Faculty members are chosen by the
all-faculty Academic Senate. Student members are selected by a joint
student-faculty selection committee. The chairman is appointed by
the president from the law faculty, after consultation with other SJC
members.
At least one faculty SJC member, Gene Granklin, and one student
member voted against ROTC's presence on campus in, respectively,
the Academic Council mail ballot and the student referendum. Four
other members, including Marc Franklin, have declined to make their
votes public. The Uailv was unable to contact the other three
members
Student member Ware has applied for admission to a ROTC
program.
