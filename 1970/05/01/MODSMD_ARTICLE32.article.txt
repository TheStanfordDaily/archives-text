# Text Of CUS Report
## 
### 
The following is the text of a
number of recommendations
made in a report by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) to the faculty
Senate. The Senate has been
considering the report, based on
SES recommendations, for several
weeks.
I. Grading Structure
A. The faculty (permanent or
temporary) member responsible for a
course shall be responsible for the
evaluation of the students' course
work. Where appropriate, the
instructor may delegate his authority
but not his responsibility in this
matter. He is the ultimate arbiter of
grades in his course.
B. For undergraduate work in
graded courses, "A" denotes
exceptional performance, "B" superior
performance, and "C" satisfactory
performance. The only passing and
recorded grades used for course work
are "A", "B", "C", and "pass." In
courses involving extensive term paper
or other work which the student has
completed on time but which the
instructor has not had time to evaluate
adequately, the instructor may report
"pass-letter-grade-to-be-reported." The
sole academic penalty for failure to
complete a course satisfactorily is the
loss of credit toward graduation or
eligibility therefor. Tuition and fees are
not recoverable in such cases.
C. A Letter Grade Indicator (LGI)
will be computed for each student, to
one decimal point only. The LGI will
be released only upon the written
request of the student, for use in
applications for scholarships,
fellowships, entrance to graduate and
professional schools, etc.
D. The Pass option is available to
any course, subject only to the consent
of the instructor and the department
concerned. No limit is placed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
on the number of "pass" courses that a
student may take. The Pass option is
intended to relieve the pressure on
students for achievement in grades in
order to enable them to concentrate
their energies more effectively on their
main courses of study. The Pass option
in no way implies less or different
course requirements than those
required of students who elect
evaluation of their work in a given
course in terms of tne standard grading
structure. A grade of pass indicates
academic achievement of not less than
"C".
E. Students are permitted to drop a
course at any time up to twenty-four
hours before the final examination,
with concurrent loss of credit. When an
instructor determines that a student
needs further time to complete
satisfactorily a 9'ven course, in
accordance with requirements set by
[the) instructor, this may be
temporarily indicated with an "I" on
his transcript. If the course is not
completed within the time specified by
the instructor in consultation with the
student, all reference to it is removed
from the transcript.
F. All grades must be reported
within ninety-six (96) hours after the
time and day reserved for the final
examination. In cases where instructors
report a "pass-letter-grade-to-be
reported" grade, they must report the
letter grade before the start of the next
quarter, and the final grade will appear
on the student's transcript one quarter
later.
G. Continuation courses shall be
reported "N", indicating that the
student's course has not yet reached
completion. Continuation courses need
not continue at the same unit level.
The instructor in a continuation course
shall submit the same grade for each
quarter in which the course has been
taken.
H. The back of the grading sheet
shall carry only information explaining
the significance of the various forms of
entries described herein and a calendar
for required submission of grades. No
description of a "curve" system shall
appear on grading sheets, and
instructors are discouraged from
awarding grades according to any
predetermined distribution system.
11. Examination Structure
A. Examinations are part of the
process of education at the same time
that they are a means to measure the
student's performance in course work.
Their structure, content, frequency,
and length are to be determined in
accordance with the nature of the
course and the material presented in it,
subject only to the limitations
contained herein.
B. Great flexibility is available to
instructors in the choice of types of
examinations. Among these are, for
instance, in-class written essay
examinations, take-home essay
examinations, oral examinations,
objective examinations, papers,
projects. Instructors may use any type
or any combination thereof, guided
only by the appropriateness of the
type of examination for the material
upon which the student is being
examined.
C. Final in-class written
examinations, when they are given, are
governed by the following regulations:
a. A three-hour period is reserved
during eamination week for the
final examination in each course of

more than two units. This period
must be given if an in-class written
examination is given,
b. Examinations in one or two unit
courses must be completed by the
end of the next-to-last week of
classes.
D. In courses where a written
take-home examination is appropriate,
the examination must be assigned at
least one week before it is due. Such
examinations should not exceed six
hours in length.
E. In courses where term papers or
projects are appropriate and are
assigned by the instructor, they should
be assigned well in advance of the due
date.
111. Eligibility, Probation
and Suspension
One hundred and eighty (180) units
are required for graduation. To remain
eligible to continue studying at
Stanford, a student must complete at
least thirty-six (36) units by the end of
his first year, seventy-two (72) by the
end of his second, and one hundred
and eight (108) by the end of the third
year. A student deviating from this
schedule may continue with the
written approval of both his advisor
and the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, obtained after conference with
these people. Such written approval is
termed "academic probation" and it
will state clearly and precisely the
conditions under which a student is
admitted to probationary status. A
student who has been suspended for
academic reasons may be invited to
return to Stanford upon his own
application to the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies who, in concert
with the student's advisor, shall
examine the case, interview the
applicant, and inform the Registrar of
his decision in writing.
I v. Pre-Registration Information

Each department or program will
make available in a public file, before
pre-registration for each quarter, a
detailed course description for each
regular course given under its
sponsorship. These course descriptions
shall also be filed in the library, the
registrar's office, and in the advising
center, so that they may be made as
widely available to students as possible.
Descriptions will be prepared or
verified by the instructor and contain
such information as the reading list,
the number of projected class
meetings, projects, papers, the
examination pattern, essential and
desirable prerequisites, etc., to
whatever extent possible. Instructors
planning to give new courses will be
encouraged to follow this same
procedure.
IV. Implementation
Unless otherwise stated, all measures
adopted by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies and approved
by the Faculty Senate will go into
effect beginning with the Fall Quarter
of the Academic year 1970-71.
Second Senate Report No. 16
The Senate of the Academic Council
held a special meeting on Thursday,
April 23, 1970. A report was received
from President regarding the
present status of arrangements for
ROTC Programs (Army, Navy and Air
Force). The principal agendum was
extended discussion of
recommendations from the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies for major
revision in the grading sturcture of the
University, as contained in a Report
filed by the CUS with the Senate on
April 16. Formal Senate action on
these recommendations is anticipated
at the next regular Senate meeting.
Respectfully submitted,
H. Donald Winbigler
Academic Secretary
