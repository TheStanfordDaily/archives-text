## Adaptation Of 'Women In Love' 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
D.H. Lawrence's "Women in
Love" should never have been
made into a movie—at least not by
Larry Kramer and Ken Russell.
| Fidelity of a screenplay to the
J text of a successful novel doesn't
necessarily result in a successful
film, a fact the adapters of
Lawrence's novel seem to have
been unaware of. The film's
failing is in its lack of cinematic
originality in its attempt to
remain true to the novel.
Lawrence considered "Women
in Love" the most complete
statement of all he felt and
thought, but unfortunately, the
unity of his seven hundred page
statement was destroyed in the
movie. The result is a wordy,
incomplete, and incoherent
sequence of shots filmed in
Deluxe color and entitled "Ken
Russell's film of D.H. Lawrence's
'Women in Love."
The characters stand in all their
nudity, undeveloped, delivering
their monologues, talking at each
other, and proceeding through a
series of physical and emotional
climaxes.
Alan Bates ("Georgy Girl,"
"King of Hearts," "Zorba the
Greek," "The Fixer"), a superb
actor in any role, no matter how
badly written, tries desperately to
make some sense out of
Lawrence's autobiographical
character Birkin.
He expresses a need for
freedom to love more than one
person and searches for this love
in the characters of school teacher
Ursula Brangwen (Jennie Linden)
and industrialist Gerald Crich
(Oliver Reed), alias "the
machine."
For some unknown reason,
apparently in the name of love,
Birkin marries Ursula, the
epitomy of the intellectually
inferior, wishy-washy,
domesticated female who can't
comprehend the fact that she's

not the only person Birkin can
love. He admits to her that she is
all women to # him, but that one
woman's love is not enough.
He seeks to find an emotional,
but not necessarily a sexual love
relationship with Gerald, a man
who has more family and
psychological problems than he
can handle. Birkin loses Gerald to
Gudrun (Glenda Jackson),
Ursula's sister and a candidate for
the Women's Liberation Hall of
Fame. As Gerald's mental and
sexual sparring partner she
succeeds in devouring and
eventually destroying him.
Unfortunately, each character
has a different definition of love
and the film finds it necessary to

attempt to expand on all four
variations. In two hours, "Women
in Love" fails to adapt a coherent
point of view concerning love or
any other topic. If that weren't
enough, miscellaneous characters
appear and disappear throughout
the movie in the form of an insane
mother, two newlyweds, an ugly
but rich lover of Birkin's, and a
homosexual artist.
The novel was decades ahead of
its time, but the photographic
techniques employed in the film
were totally unimaginative,
pre-"Bonnie and Clyde." Special
effects seldom compensate for
lack of creativity. Likewise,
Lawrence's words and characters,
when not fully developed, cannot

compensate for the film's lack of
depth and originality.

showing at the New Royal
Theater at Polk and California in
the City.)

Because of the seriousness of
the recent events on campus, I
hope you will consider where you
are this weekend and why you are
there.
This afternoon the Noonreel
Series sponsored by the Stanford
Community Against War and
Fascism will present two fifteen
minute films. "Wilmington" and
"May Day," which features
Kathleen Cleaver, Bobby Seale
and Charles Garry at the 1969 bail

rally in San Francisco to Free
Huey, will be shown continuously
from 12 noon to 1 :30 in room
274, Tresidder.
Tonight, the Silent Film Series
will feature Douglas Fairbanks in
the 1920 versions of "The Mark
of Zorro," at 7, 8, and 9 in
Tresidder.
Saturday evening, the
Contemporary Cinema Society
will be showing one of Truffautt's
best "Jules and Jim," starring
Jeanne Moreau, Oskar Werner,
and Henri Serre in Bishop
Auditorium at 7:30, 9:30, and
1 1 :30.
Godard's "Pierrot Le Fou,"
starring Jean-Paul Belmondo,
Anna Karina, and Jean-Pierre
Leaud, will be presented by the
Tresidder Saturday Film Series at
7, 8, and 9 in Tresidder. A
gangster story serves as a pretext
for Godard's existential analysis
of two people, the quality of their
lives and the nature of their
relationship.
"La Guerre Est Finie" with
Yves Montand and Genevieve
Bujold will be shown in Cubberley
Saturday at 7, 9:15, and 10:30
with proceeds going to the
Company's production of "King
Lear." Director Alain Resnais
relates the story of a remnant of
the Spanish underground that,
thirty years after Franco,
continues to the Falange
from exile in France. The
Company needs the money, and
this is an opportunity to see an
outstanding film, with Montand
giving the performance of his
career.
The Sunday Flicks will present
the ultimate Carlo Ponti
Production, "Doctor Zhivago,"
directed by David Lean and
starring Omar Sharif, Julie
Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, Tom
Courtney, Alec Guinness, Rita
Tushingham, and Rod Steiger, at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium.


CONTEMPLATION—Sisters Ursula (Jennie Linden) and Gudrun (Clenda Jackson) discuss their attitude towards marriage
in "Women In Love."
