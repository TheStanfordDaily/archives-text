## '1776' Reveals Responsible Revolution 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Although I usually make it a
point to keep politics off the
entertainment page, I am going to
discuss revolution. This decision is
based on the coincidence in time
between the shattered glass at
Stanford and the opening of the
musical "1776" in San Francisco.
I went to "1776" last weekend
expecting a pleasant little
self- con gratula.t\>ry songfest
patriotically lauding the Founding
Fathers and their Declaration.
What I found was not a musical,

but a witty and almost dramatic
scenario with a few songs and
some very heavy thoughts.
Although the music was
somewhat less than mediocre, the
script was terse, witty, and most
of all, to use one of today's three
favorite catchwords (along with
"Meaningful" and "Ecology"), in
was Relevant.
The story follows the efforts of
John Adams, played by Patrick
Bedford, to push a resolution on
independence for the colonies
through the somnambulant
Continental Congress. Through
the Spring of 1776, Adams fails to
convince anyone—his rhetoric is
repetitive, his arguments are
chauvanistic, and most of all, his
manner is repulsive. He is an

Off-ROTC rad with shoes. He
accomplishes nothing, and is
doomed to failure, until he finally
consults Benjamin Franklin (Rex
Everhart).
Franklin, the wise man with the
ready wit—"the inventor of the
stove," as he introduces
himself—had realized the
predicament, and had recognized
that only conservatives can
drastically alter public policy.
Franklin has arranged for a
gentleman of the South, Virginia's
Richard Henry Lee (overplayed
by Gary Oakes), to be the new
sponsor of the independence
resolution. Virginia had previously
stood with the South in opposing
independence; when Lee returns
with Virginia's statement that
"These Colonies are, and of a
Right ought to be Free," the
Congress begins serious debate on
the matter.
Each delegate to the Congress is
wooed individually by Adams'
forces—Colonel Thomas McKean
(Gordon Dilworth), and Franklin.
Thomas Jefferson (Jon Cypher)
dejectedly sits down to compose
the document on independence
he has not seen his wife in six
months, and is understandably
anxious to return to Virginia.
Realizing that "the sooner
Jefferson's problem is solved, the
sooner ours will be," Adams has
Mrs. Jefferson brought to
Philadelphia. He had not expected
the couple to delay so long in the
bedroom, however. "In the
middle of the afternoon?" he asks
Franklin. Ben replies, "Not
everyone is from Boston, John."

The delegates are finally
convinced to vote for
in dependence—all except
Pennsylvania's John Dickerson
(George Hearn). When his
delegation deserts him, he resigns
his seat in the Congress, since his
conscience will not permit him to
sign the document. The
Southerners sign only after the
paragraph condemning slavery is
stricken. There must be
compromise on every phrase in
order to insure unanimity.
Finally, the Declaration of
Independence is adopted.
A Revolution has begun,
launching a new kind of
nation —one where the military is
composed of citizens defending
their own land, where the Army is
controlled by the civilian
government, where grievances can
be adjudicated in a court of law.
This radical new system was
begun by a revolution which arose
through legal and orderly
discussion, and responsible
debate. The time for throwing tea
into the harbor had passed; the
society had been awakened, and if
change was to come, it had to
come through representative
democracy.
Actually, "1776" is worth
seeing even if you don't know
what Off-ROTC means. Although
the songs are poorly tied to the
script as well as being musically
undistinguished, the play is
delightfully witty, occasionally
bawdy, and thoroughly enjoyable.
I recommend it highly, especially
for those who might want to
make a revolution.
