# Hornsby's Highlights
## 
### BISON HORNSBY 
This was slated to be a review
of Small Faces, an English group
best-known for a super-sweet
commercial 45 called "Ichtykoo
Park." Warner Bros. Records is
insisting that these boys are going
back into low-sales, high-integrity
music. As you all know, hacks are
those artists who get too much
AM radio time relative to their
FM airplay. This ratio is widely
known in the music business as
the co-efficient of hacking.
Long a darling in the
underground world for their low
co-efficient of hacking was the
Jeff Beck Group. Their albums are
heavy (spelled u-n-s-u-b-t-l-e by
some) can not be played over a
transistor radio. In fine print,
many manufacturers have placed
the following disclaimer, "Any
implied warranty will be
invalidated by abuse of the
equipment, such as playing Jeff
Beck albums." Beck's guitar is too
violent and Rod Stewart's voice is
too raunchy for the average
speaker. Recently, Beck was in a
car crash which induced Stewart
to do an album on his own. As
this album is one of the finest in
my collection, I was most excited
to hear that he had joined Small
Faces.
After two weeks of listening to
their new album, however, I have
concluded that the new Small
Faces is neither the best possible
vehicle for Stewart nor has it
developed a group identity to
which he might be secondary. So
you get the combination that he is
too submerged, and at the same
time, the sensation that the record
was mostly Rod Stewart with
some session men.
lire album is pleasant, however,
particularly the second side. Rod
Wood, who was the bass player
for Jeff Beck, helped write 6
songs. "Flying," which has a nice
Stewart vocal and builds nicely to
be a driving slow tune, "Pineapple
and the Monkey," which is rich,
