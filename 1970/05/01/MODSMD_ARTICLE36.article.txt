# Studio Watts Takes Mechanical Theme
## 
### 
"The Name of the Game/Mechanical?" will be presented this
weekend on campus by Studio Watts. The show is the second of a
series of original plays being written, produced and performed by the
members of Studio Watts.
The Watts group had its inception in 1965, when it received a grant
from the National Endowment for the Arts. The group's members are
principally from the Los Angeles area, but membership is open to all
those seriously committed to the' arts who are interested in an
educational theatrical experience.
Experimental Method
The Studio's dramatic method is one of creative experimentation.
The plays are written as the director, writer, actors, and friends meet
and discuss a particular theme. The writer works with the thoughts
and experiences which are contributed to these discussions to produce
a script which reflects the feelings and perceptions of those who
developed it, and the script continues to evolve as new ideas are
introduced.
The theme for "The Name of the Game/Mechanical?" is the
concept of the Conglomerateâ€”the overpowering structure of a society
which discovers and meets the needs of individuals only to seduce
them through their exposed desires.
Seduction
The seductive effects of the business conglomerate and its
increasing exploitation of the "minority market" are juxtaposed with
the social seduction which takes place on the street.
Performances of "The Name of the Game/Mechanical?" will be at
8:30 in the Little Theater on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.
Free tickets may be picked up at the TMU box office.
