# Rod Stewart Prowls Itchykoo
## 
### 
lull, and pretty, and "Nobody
Knows," where we find a
harpsichord-like piano, and
delicate, relaxed harmony, are
among Wood's best material.
The album suffers from thin
drumming (except in "Looking
Out the Window," a song written
by the drummer containing the
strongest drumming and the
coolest guitar riffs on the album)
and unexciting guitar playing by
Wood. This is particularly evident
on "Stone" a five-plus minute cut
featuring tiresome bottleneck
guitar, pathetic lyrics, and Stewart
on the banjo.
If your budget is limited buy
something which features Stewart
more, preferably The Rod Stewart
Album or Beck's album Truth.
Enjoyment of either requires a big
stereo and no party-pooping
neighbors. Stewart's own album
features his great voice backed up
by everyone from the Beck Group

except for Beck. It is especially
nice because some of the violence
is toned-down as Stewart
performs more folky and
evocative songs he
wrote/arranged/liked. Behind the
rich yellow album cover, you'll
find two sensual grain
photographs of his great mike
moves, tight pants, and
less-than-perfect posture.
He is a great song-writer with a
sense for what he sings best and a
Dylan-like use of odd metre to
emphasis meaning and phrasing in
his lyrics. We have "Cindy's
Lament," where Rod slyly
suggests a little extortion or
what-have-you:
I watched your friends, Cindy,
laugh in m y face
But I won't apologize for the
way that I am
But if they only knew, baby,
yes if only they knew
That you've already spent one
night with me honey.
The best cut on the album is
"Blind Prayer," where he sings "I
was born and raised the only son
of lawyer until I was
approximately the age of
four ... or perhaps five," and
"Struck down by the time I was
ten by a disease which deprived
me of the sight of the mornin'
sun," and 'The kids of my block
weren't too playful." Oh, it's
great stuff! Other favorite Stewart
vocals include "Shapes" (the old

Yardbirds hit), "I Ain't
Superstitious," and "Old Man
Ribah" from Beck's album, Truth.
"All Shook Up" and the greatest
version of "Jailhouse Rock" ever
done can be found on the
Beck ola, album.
Stewart is a very evocative
performer and kind of a neat guy.
How many people would say, "I
recorded 'Street Fighting Man'
because I wanted somebody to
hear the words. Such fine lyrics. I
wonder why Jagger bothers to
write lyrics like that when he sings
so you can't understand a word."
Hope you made some of the
fine local concerts last weekend.
The Dog featured Quicksilver,
who played hour sets both
nights, and the Robert Savage
Group who featured dirty patter
like 'This song is to let you relax
and zip up your pants," and a
jazzy, Frankie Avalon version of
"I love you, no shit."
At the Fillmore, Joe Cocker's
30-piece group came off well
especially on "The Letter," but
most of Van Morrison's set
sounded like one song. The festive
gathering at Frost was also
pleasant, although both Eric
Burdon and Country Joe come off
better under bright lights in
smoky, sweaty places,Â«and Joe's
haircut is a tragedy. At all the
shows, equipment hassles marred
the performances, but the
strawberries thrown into the

auciience and the sun coming out
just as the Fish started made it
nice to be outside.
As the Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young concert has been
postponed, the Jethro Tull and
Fairport Convention show will be
at Winterland or Fillmore West.
Call 921-0112 or a radio station
to find out for sure. The Matrix
has Sandy Bull, who will also be
appearing with Mike Bloomfield
and many others at the San
Francisco State Folk Festival May
8-10. Friday night at the Odyssey
in San Mateo, you can catch the
fine San Jose jazz/rock group,
Throckmorton. Sunday night at
the Berkeley Community Theatre,
Elvin Bishop will appear.
The Berkeley Community
Theatre hosts Phil Ochs on
Saturday night, and Elvin Bishop
joins the energetic Ike and Turner
Show on Sunday. The good old
Family Dog with the
much-improved Big Brother and
the Holding Company (sans Janis
if you've been under a rock) and
the six-piece Aum.
