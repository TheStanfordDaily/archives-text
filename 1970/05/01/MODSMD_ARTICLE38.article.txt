The Stanford Opera
Association presents Mozart's
"The Magic Flute" at 8 p.m.
May 1, 2 and 3 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. We have heard the
rehearsals, and this promises to
be an excellent production.
The opera will be presented in
the English version of W.H.
Auden and Chester Kallman.
Tickets are available at the
Tresidder Box Office.
The Lamplighters present
Gilbert and Sullivan's
"Patience" this weekend and
next at the Presentation
Theatre in San Francisco at
8:30 p.m. This musical
comedy, satirizing the
aestheticism of Victorian days,
contains some of Sullivan's
best music and many of
Gilbert's finest characters,
including Lady Jane, whose
charm comes from being
"distinctly plain."
