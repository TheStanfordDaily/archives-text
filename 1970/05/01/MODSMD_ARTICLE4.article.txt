# Commission Established
## 
### 
President Pitzer yesterday
established a Commission to
examine the violence at
Stanford. The commission will
seek to explore the appropriate
limits of protest on the
campus, the appropriate
responses of the university, and
the responsibilities of
individual faculty students and
staff at times of disruption.
The statement announcing
the formation of the
commission, read twice over
KZSU and once to the Faculty
Senate by the President, states
that "we must apply our
resources of intelligence, of
reflection, and of freedom to
the search for answers which
command broad agreement and
respect on campus."
The commission will
consider the appropriate limits
of campus protests, but will
not impinge on the rule-making
authority of bodies such as the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council.
Members of the Commission
will be University Ombudsman
Herant Katchadouria n,
Professors Anthony
Amsterdam and Wolfgang
Panofsky, and students John
Grube and Craig Schindler.
The commission will hold
hearings during the next few
weeks and is expected to
report by June 1.
