To Jay is May Day, a
joyful event marked by
dancing and singing. Ten
years ago, Francis Gary
Powers was shot down during
a U-2 reconnaissance mission
over the Soviet Union. His
book on the incident,
Operation Overflight, will be
issued today.
If you see a U-2 shot
down during a Maypole
dance, call the News Desk at

If you have any personal
confessions to sell, call the
