# Pitzer Supported By Faculty Senate

### FRANK MILLER 
President Pitzer yesterday
asked the Advisory Committee on
ROTC "to reconsider, and, if they
desire, to recommend the
renegotiation of the Army
contract" that allowed limited
credit for ROTC courses.
Pitzer also announced that
vice-provost Howard Brooks, who
conducted the Army ROTC
contract negotiations, may be
offered a position in the
Department of the Air Force.
Brooks stopped working on the
negotiations when first contacted
by the Air Force, according to
Pitzer.
The Faculty Senate also
proposed sending a delegation to
Washington, D.C. to explain the
University's concern on national
problems, including U.S.
involvement in Cambodia.
Pitzer's announcement was
made to the Faculty Senate with
Pitzer explaining that he made his
recommendation "in view of the
closeness of student and faculty
votes and the emotional state of
this issue on the campus . . ."

The faculty Senate voiced its
approval of the action "to return
the ROTC question to the
Advisory Committee on ROTC
for further consideration" because
of: President Nixon's
recommendations for changes in
draft deferment patterns; the
recent student referendum on
ROTC; and the American entry
into Cambodia.

The Senate also passed without
dissent a resolution proposing that
a delegation composed largely of
faculty and students meet with
elected governmental officials to
"convey the growing sense of
crisis" and to "try to elicit
constructive responses to our
national emergency" of
unresolved problems.
Marathon Meeting
The Senate action and Pitzer's
statement came during a
marathon six hour meeting
interrupted by a two-hour recess
to hear Nixon's speech on
Cambodia. During parts of the
meeting held in the Business
School, the faculty members
could hear rocks hitting the
building and breaking windows.
Two Senate members were once

driven back into the meeting
room by lingering tear gas when
they went out to confer for a
moment.
One member of the Senate said
after the meeting that referring
the Army contracts back to
committee "says everything is up
for grabs," indicating that even
the issue of keeping ROTC on
campus could be brought up.
However, speculators doubted
that the committee would
recommend this. The committee
was not instructed to phase-out
ROTC.
Pitzer said that he would
"explain to the Army the
exceptional circumstances that
justify this reconsideration." He
added that if the committee
recommended changing the
contract, "We will be in somewhat
bad faith . . . very seriously so but
I'm ready to explain that to the
Defense Department."
Sensitive Situation
Before announcing the referral
back to the committee, Pitzer
released the information that Dr.
Howard Brooks, vice-provost, is
being considered for an executive
position in the Department of the
Air Force. Brooks handled the
negotiations between the
University and the Defense
Department regarding the Army
ROTC contracts. Pitzer released
the information before the Air
Force announcement because "of
the sensitivity of the situation on
the campus."
Pitzer emphasized that Brooks
was not being considered for the
post while negotiating with the
Defense Department. "I have
complete confidence that Dr.
Brooks represented Stanford in
those ROTC matters assigned to
him with the greatest integrity,"
Pitzer said. He added that Brooks
"stepped aside from his
involvement with ROTC promptly
when he was approached about
the Air Force position."
Two Senate members, Philip
Dawson and George L. Bach, told
the Daily after the meeting that
the Senate felt a "real sense of
urgency and the complexity of
