# Pitzer Supported By Faculty Senate
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
President Pitzer yesterday
asked the Advisory Committee on
ROTC "to reconsider, and, if they
desire, to recommend the
renegotiation of the Army
contract" that allowed limited
credit for ROTC courses.
Pitzer also announced that
vice-provost Howard Brooks, who
conducted the Army ROTC
contract negotiations, may be
offered a position in the
Department of the Air Force.
Brooks stopped working on the
negotiations when first contacted
by the Air Force, according to
Pitzer.
The Faculty Senate also
proposed sending a delegation to
Washington, D.C. to explain the
University's concern on national
problems, including U.S.
involvement in Cambodia.
Pitzer's announcement was
made to the Faculty Senate with
Pitzer explaining that he made his
recommendation "in view of the
closeness of student and faculty
votes and the emotional state of
this issue on the campus . . ."

The faculty Senate voiced its
approval of the action "to return
the ROTC question to the
Advisory Committee on ROTC
for further consideration" because
of: President Nixon's
recommendations for changes in
draft deferment patterns; the
recent student referendum on
ROTC; and the American entry
into Cambodia.

The Senate also passed without
dissent a resolution proposing that
a delegation composed largely of
faculty and students meet with
elected governmental officials to
"convey the growing sense of
crisis" and to "try to elicit
constructive responses to our
national emergency" of
unresolved problems.
Marathon Meeting
The Senate action and Pitzer's
statement came during a
marathon six hour meeting
interrupted by a two-hour recess
to hear Nixon's speech on
Cambodia. During parts of the
meeting held in the Business
School, the faculty members
could hear rocks hitting the
building and breaking windows.
Two Senate members were once

driven back into the meeting
room by lingering tear gas when
they went out to confer for a
moment.
One member of the Senate said
after the meeting that referring
the Army contracts back to
committee "says everything is up
for grabs," indicating that even
the issue of keeping ROTC on
campus could be brought up.
However, speculators doubted
that the committee would
recommend this. The committee
was not instructed to phase-out
ROTC.
Pitzer said that he would
"explain to the Army the
exceptional circumstances that
justify this reconsideration." He
added that if the committee
recommended changing the
contract, "We will be in somewhat
bad faith . . . very seriously so but
I'm ready to explain that to the
Defense Department."
Sensitive Situation
Before announcing the referral
back to the committee, Pitzer
released the information that Dr.
Howard Brooks, vice-provost, is
being considered for an executive
position in the Department of the
Air Force. Brooks handled the
negotiations between the
University and the Defense
Department regarding the Army
ROTC contracts. Pitzer released
the information before the Air
Force announcement because "of
the sensitivity of the situation on
the campus."
Pitzer emphasized that Brooks
was not being considered for the
post while negotiating with the
Defense Department. "I have
complete confidence that Dr.
Brooks represented Stanford in
those ROTC matters assigned to
him with the greatest integrity,"
Pitzer said. He added that Brooks
"stepped aside from his
involvement with ROTC promptly
when he was approached about
the Air Force position."
Two Senate members, Philip
Dawson and George L. Bach, told
the Daily after the meeting that
the Senate felt a "real sense of
urgency and the complexity of
became targets of sporadic rock
throwing.
Demonstrators Regroup
Police, moving in from White
Plaza, reformed on Surra Street in
front of the Law School and
marched toward the milling
crowd. As they approached, most
of the group turned down Galvez
Street, toward the ROTC
building. The police ran down
Serra past Galvez Street, and the
crowd regrouped, throwing rocks
at police.
Another busload of police
arrived on Serra, and the
non-violent group again moved
between the police and the
militants, chanting, "No rocks, no
gas." Their efforts were
unsuccessful as missies continued
to fly. At 11:20, the police
charged through the seated group,
throwing more tear gas.
Demonstrators scattered in all
directions, with small bands
heading down Serra St., around
the Business School, and toward
White Plaza. The largest group
moved up Galvez St., stopping in
front of the Undergraduate
Library.
Police Sweeps
They remained relatively quiet
for some time, and after several
announcements, moved back into
White Plaza. At 11:40, the police
formed lines in White Plaza and
slowly moved past the Old Union
and the bookstore. As they
approached, the crowd split into
two groups, one retreating past
the Post Office, and the other
moving between Tresidder Union
and Dinkelspiel.
At this time, rocks were
thrown through windows in the
Post Office, Dinkelspiel, and at
police. Two demonstrators who
had been separated from the
crowd near the Post Office were
sprayed with a chemical irritant.
They claimed counter-protestors
attacked them.
Demonstrators regrouped
between Dinkelspiel and Tresidder
and by midnight, police moved in
with more gas. Police charged past
Tresidder and the 200
demonstrators present retreated
into the Tresidder parking lot.
FCM Members Attacked
Shortly after midnight, a group
carrying wooden planks attacked
a small squad of FCM members in
back of the bookstore. One
member, Walter Schirra 111, was
severely injured. He was kept
overnight at Co well Health Center
and is believed to have sustained a
severe back injury.
At 12:15, more gas was thrown
into the Tresidder parking lot and
protestors marched down Campus
Drive. Two squad cars drove past,
inciting more rock throwing.
About twenty persons pushed
an abandoned car from the Beta

House parking lot into Campus
Drive. The car was quickly turned
on its side and set afire with a
flare. For several minutes the
crowd watched as the flames, fed
by gasoline, burned 20 to 30 feet
high.
Reporter Trapped
Within five minutes, police and
firemen arrived. The lead car
smashed into the burning car,
pushing it across the street and
out of the way of following squad
cars and a fire engine. Tear gas
was thrown from the lead car at
least twice as it sped up Campus
Drive. One grenade hit a KZSU
reporter heading to the scene on
his motor cycle, trapping him in
the fumes for several minutes.
By 1 a.m., about 200
demonstrators had regrouped near
the Undergraduate Library. Six
conservatives met them at the
bookstore, and a brawl almost
broke out. Fifty police, moving
from both sides of the store,
drove the protestors back.
The protestors regrouped, and
the police charged once more,
launching more tear gas in the
face of a heavy barrage of rocks.
The crowd retreated past the
Undergraduate Library, stopping
at the corner of Galvez and
Escondido Streets. A squad car
came down Galvez, past Stern
Hall, then turned around and sped
away. The crowd began to thin
out, and dispersed by 2 a.m.
