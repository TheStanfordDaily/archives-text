For those who don't accept the "do it"
politics of throwing rocks at windows and
police but who oppose ROTC and despise
Nixon's cruel, dishonest rhetoric these are
days that wrankle emotions.
Humanists are faced with a politics of
despair and a crisis in expression. The
cruelty of American war policy invokes an
impatience that demands action, but years
of non-violent protest have so immunized
the country to that form of protest that it
no longer seems effective.
Stanford's proto-revolutionaries think
they have an answer to this inpotence, but
for those who have seen police groan,
grimace and bleed during the last two
nights that answer is hardly less cruel than
the problem it is attacking. We must
condemn it.
Still amid the despair of the last few
days, there was some hope. Yesterday
President Pitzer asked his advisory
committee on ROTC to reconsider the
Army contract which allows limited
academic credit for military training
courses.
The President's action and the faculty
Senate's endorsement of it show
considerable moral courage.
Despite this significant change of heart,
however, the major issue of whether ROTC
should be on campus still remains
untouched, for this reason, we urge the
advisory committee to recommend Senate
adoption of recommendation two of the
1969 Majority Report of the Ad Hoc
committee on ROTC which states:
"Non-credit, required military training and
education should no longer be offered on
the Stanford campus."
Even in yesterday's ROTC decisions,
however, there are discouraging
undercurrents. What caused Pitzer to
reconsider his position? Was it the crisis in
Cambodia, or Vice Provost Brooks' elevation

into the Air Force? Or was it Wednesday
evening's violent demonstration and the
prolonged student struggle against ROTC?
Though all of these factors no doubt
had some effect, we must conclude that the
actions of the Off-ROTC movement played
a large part. The President has always
contended that political factors should not
affect ROTC's status, so it seems unlikely
that the Cambodian crisis has much direct
effect. He also went to great pains in his
statement yesterday to exonerate Brooks
of any conflict of interest so that can
hardly be the basis of his reconsideration.
What is most likely is that Pitzer realized
tha both of these factors would increase
the size and vehemence of Off ROTC
demonstrations and was forced to beat a
swift retreat.
So, we are back again to the dilemma of
effective political expression. Cruel tactics
seem to have accomplished part of what is
a laudable goal. Where then should a person
stand?
Should he heave rocks and bricks
through windows and at police? We must
conclude that such action is innately
wrong. It seems terribly cruel and
hypocritical to watch upper class students
try to maim lower-middle class police in
the name of "the people." The last two
nights' protests have transformed those
participating into incredibly ugly people.
Are we to adopt violent tactics that
succeed in the short run or should we
assume an idealistic, non-violent and often
ineffective stance? As human beings we can
not accept the former alternative. Still we
must continue to pursue our goals
militantly. Today's student strike against
the Cambodia War may have some effect
when seen in concert with action across the
country.
