Today members of the Stanford community will join citizens from the rest
of the Peninsula in a march to protest the American invasion of Cambodia.
Wednesday and Thursday, a delegation from Stanford University will
travel to Washington to take that same protest to the seat of government.
Your support is vital to both these activities.
Please join us in the march, beginning at noon in Lytton Plaza. Please add
your support to the University Delegation, which will be financed by vol
untary contributions. (Donations are being accepted at the ASSU Office in
Tresidder Union.)
The time has come for Stanford to carry its opposition to the war beyond
the campus to the community and the nation.
