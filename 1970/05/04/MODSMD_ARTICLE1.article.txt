### TOM GIVEN 
University strikes against
President Nixon's Cambodian
policy took on national
proportions last night as many of
the country's most prestigious
universities prepared to "end
business as usual."
On over two dozen campuses
students, at times aided by
faculty, were in the process of
organizing the stoppages. In
addition, a number of campuses
are continuing already-existing
strikes.
Ten college newspapers from
both the East and West Coasts
issued a joint editorial calling for a
nationwide strike, "not against
the university . . . but a strike of
the university." (see page two).
Aside from the Daily, the
papers include The Harvard
Crimson, The Daily Princetonian,
The Dairy Californian, The Bryn
Ma wr-Haverford College News,
The Rutgers Targum, The Daily
Bruin (UCLA), the Columbia
Spectator, The Daily
Pennsylvanian, and Ihe Cornell
Daily Campuses preparing to
go on strike include Princeton,
Harvard, Penn, Cornell, Stanford,
Berkeley and other schools in an
unprecedented academic tie-up.
Mass Meetings
The Eastern campuses,
recovering from the "Free
Bobby" rally in New Haven, were
planning a mass meeting of
students and faculty for today.
In the Midwest, only Purdue
called a strike today.Students Ohio

five-day-old strike, and anti-war
protesters clashed for the third

Stanford was the largest effort at
West Coast schools.
