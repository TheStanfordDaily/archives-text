# Strike
## 
### 
President Nixon's unwarranted and illegal decision to
send American combat forces into Cambodia and to resume
the bombing of North Vietnam demands militant,
immediate, and continued opposition from all Americans.
Through his unilateral, executive move, the President has
placed our country in a state of emergency.
He has ignored the constitutional prerogative of Congress,
and has revealed the sham of his policy of Vietnamization, a
policy which, through a tortuous process of innerlogic,
demands that we escalate the war in order to enable
American troops to withdraw.
He has demonstrated that American foreign policy still
dictates the necessity to sacrifice American lives to ravish
independent countries, and to squander our resources and
energies.
The President has tragically misguaged the mood of the
country. The anti-war movement which has marched and
protested for years in a vain effort to reverse the United
States role in Southeast Asia has finally resurfaced in new
and larger numbers.
With Nixon's lies now finally exposed, the immorality
and hypocrisy of our government have been revealed for all
to see.
The need for action has never been so great and so urgent.
We, therefore, call on the entire academic community of
this country to engage in a nationwide university strike. We
must cease business as usual in order to allow the university
to lead and join in a collective strike to protect America's
escalation of the war.
We do not call for a strike of students against the
University but a strike by the entire university-faculty,
students, staff and administrators alike.
The reasons for such a strike are manifest.
First, it is a germanic symbol of our opposition to a
corrupt and immoral war. It demonstrates clearly our
priorities, for the significance of class and examinations
pales before the greater problems outside the classroom.
Moreover, it recognizes the fact that within a society so
permeated with inequality, immorality, and destruction, a
classroom education becomes a hollow, meaningless
exercise.
But the necessity of a strike extends even far beyond
these reasons. The strike is necessary to free the academic
community from activities of secondary importance and to
open it up to the primary task of building renewed
opposition to the War. It is necessary to permit the
academic community to first solidify its own opposition,
and then to ask immediately to extend this opposition
beyond the campuses.
Wc ask the entire academic community to use this
opportunity to go to the people and to bring home to the
entire nation the meaning of the President's action.
We urge that this strike be directed to ward bringing out
the following changes:
-an immediate withdrawal of all American forces from
Southeast Asia.
-passage of the Senate amendment to the Military
Appropriation Act to deny all aid for military and political
adventure in Southeast Asia.
—the end of political repression at home, in particular the
government's systematic attempt to eliminate the Black
Panther Party and other political dissidents.
—a reversal of American priorities for military
involvements abroad to domestic problems, in particular the
problems of our beleaguered cities.
-the mobilization of public support for anri-war
candidates in the upcoming primary and general elections.
-and the building of support for a massive demonstration
in Washington, May 9, to bring to the nation's capital an
unprecedented numbers our opposition.
The stage has been set, the issues clearly drawn, the need
apparent. It is time now to act.

to lead and join in a collective strike to protect America's
escalation of the war.
We do not call for a strike of students against the
University but a strike by the entire university-faculty,
students, staff and administrators alike.
The reasons for such a strike are manifest.
First, it is a germanic symbol of our opposition to a
corrupt and immoral war. It demonstrates clearly our
priorities, for the significance of class and examinations
pales before the greater problems outside the classroom.
Moreover, it recognizes the fact that within a society so
permeated with inequality, immorality, and destruction, a
classroom education becomes a hollow, meaningless
exercise.
But the necessity of a strike extends even far beyond
these reasons. The strike is necessary to free the academic
community from activities of secondary importance and to
open it up to the primary task of building renewed
opposition to the War. It is necessary to permit the
academic community to first solidify its own opposition,
and then to ask immediately to extend this opposition
beyond the campuses.
Wc ask the entire academic community to use this
opportunity to go to the people and to bring home to the
entire nation the meaning of the President's action.
We urge that this strike be directed to ward bringing out
the following changes:
-an immediate withdrawal of all American forces from
Southeast Asia.
-passage of the Senate amendment to the Military
Appropriation Act to deny all aid for military and political
adventure in Southeast Asia.
—the end of political repression at home, in particular the
government's systematic attempt to eliminate the Black
Panther Party and other political dissidents.
—a reversal of American priorities for military
involvements abroad to domestic problems, in particular the
problems of our beleaguered cities.
-the mobilization of public support for anri-war
candidates in the upcoming primary and general elections.
-and the building of support for a massive demonstration
in Washington, May 9, to bring to the nation's capital an
unprecedented numbers our opposition.
The stage has been set, the issues clearly drawn, the need
apparent. It is time now to act.

President Nixon's unwarranted and illegal decision to
send American combat forces into Cambodia and to resume
the bombing of North Vietnam demands militant,
immediate, and continued opposition from all Americans.
Through his unilateral, executive move, the President has
placed our country in a state of emergency.
He has ignored the constitutional prerogative of Congress,
and has revealed the sham of his policy of Vietnamization, a
policy which, through a tortuous process of innerlogic,
demands that we escalate the war in order to enable
American troops to withdraw.
He has demonstrated that American foreign policy still
dictates the necessity to sacrifice American lives to ravish
independent countries, and to squander our resources and
energies.
The President has tragically misguaged the mood of the
country. The anti-war movement which has marched and
protested for years in a vain effort to reverse the United
States role in Southeast Asia has finally resurfaced in new
and larger numbers.
With Nixon's lies now finally exposed, the immorality
and hypocrisy of our government have been revealed for all
to see.
The need for action has never been so great and so urgent.
We, therefore, call on the entire academic community of
this country to engage in a nationwide university strike. We
must cease business as usual in order to allow the university
to lead and join in a collective strike to protect America's
escalation of the war.
