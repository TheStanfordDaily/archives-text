# 'Go To Hell'
## Faculty Green Meanies 
### Jesse Cedarbaum 
Greenie Meanies can go to hell.
Such metaphors can be fun, but
they can become hard to sustain,
and, even more important, at
times events become so crucial
that such descriptions lost their
relevence. Friday's Academic
Council meeting is one instance to
which such an analysis applies.
Never has there been a more
blatant and shabby excuse for
obscuring an issue that
President Pitzer's opening
statement to the Council, in
which he totally ignored the
causes of recent violence on
campus and instead addressed
himself to obliterating student
response to the issues and reaction
to his own poor handling of the
situation. Not only are his
suggestions that a curfew be
imposed and that the campus be
cordoned off to outside persons
extreme and impractical, but
experience has shown such
repressive tactics to be the fuse
which kindles the outbreak of
further violence and "transing."
But President Fitter's statement
was not the only lowlight of the
meeting. The conduct and
response of the faculty members
was, to say the least,
"underwhelming," if not
downright disgusting. These men

are supposedly among the
intellectual elite of the country,
possessed with insight and the
ability and desire to engage in
"rational dialogue." Yet a junior
high school student council could
have conducted itself in a more
exemplary fashion and dealt more
straightforwardly with the issues.
The amount of rhetorical and
precedural bullshit flying around
inside Dinkelspiel that noon hour
far surpassed that of any
Movement meeting. And the
behavior of the faculty members
who objected to the University's
denying them their "right to
teach" as an act of protest against
the recent tragic events in the
world certainly did not merit the
trust and respect of those they
desire to instruct.
Cameras and cameramen were
barred from the meeting. By the
Administration's standards, this
constitutes a violent disruption of
the University's activities, yet no
police were brought in. Does this
not reek of some sort of double
standard?
One brave member of the Math
department got up to the mike
and said that when the University
can address itself to the issues and
take action — end ROTC and
DOD contracts and come out
strongly against the invasion of
Cambodia — there will be no
reason for violence and for rocks
to be thrown. And these
supposedly mature, intelligent
men and women booed and hissed
in an amazingly childish display of
their mettle.
As Professor Zimbardo of
Psychology said a few moments
later, "How can we expect them
to trust us at all?"
The answer to his question is
that the students can't be
expected to trust the
administration and faculty as long
as the narrow perspective they
have exhibited in past weeks
continues to manifest itself.
It is time for President Pitzer,
the Trustees, the Faculty and
everyone else to re-examine their
positions on the crises besetting us
in the light of recent
developments. And one of these
crises is not the recent violence on
campus. The violence is but a
symptom of the deeper ills which
are plaguing us, and the cures
attempted up to now have only
served to aggrivate what was once
a small inflamation.
Bringing in police to "protect"
vital files is but a poor excuse for
taking repressive measures. The
safety of those files could just
have easily been insured against
those who said they had no

intention of touching them by the
stationing of a few guards inside
the building to guarantee their
security. But instead of taking
steps to prevent violence and
promote a peaceful protest at the
Old Union, the Administration
chose to provoke further,
unnecessary violence. Hardly a
responsible decision.
President Pitzer has called
Nixon's Cambodia decision a
"mistake of the gravest kind," and
asked him to reconsider. It takes
pride to admit that one has made
a mistake and to take steps to
rectify it. President Pitzer, if he
means what he said in his message
to Washington, should take the
lead in setting an example for
others to follow and re-evaluate
decisions of recent days as the
new reality of the situation
demands.
This could best be done by:
1. Declaring the University
closed until sucn time as
American forces are withdrawn
from Cambodia;, as a symbolic act
of protest; and
2. Unilaterally declaring an
IMMEDIATE END TO ALL
ROTC PROGRAMS AND DOD
RESEARCH CONTRACTS as a
firm, definite action.
If these steps are
not taken, it will not be necessary
for us to destroy the University,
as President Pitzer and others
claim we are trying to do. The
Administration and faculty will
do it for us, just as President
Nixon is ruining our country.
I don't think conservative
reactionaries throw rocks.
