# Faculty Strike Stands
## 
### 
We, the undersigned faculty
members, regardless of the
decisions of our respective
departments, intend to join the
university-wide strike called by
the Movement for this week. We
support and will actively work to
secure the demands behind the
strike. We will be on the picket
lines, will not cross them, and
urge our colleagues to respect
them.
A strike, we recognize, is a
political act not an academic
gesture. The time demands
precisely that. With a government
that promotes invasion ol a
neutral country in the name of
peace, that cloaks imperialism in
the guise of assistance and advice,
that condones the systematic
destruction and oppression ol
much of the Indochinese
peninsula, and that hides the fact
that such adventures could lead to
nuclear war, the only response
possible is the political one.
Business as usual in such a
situation becomes a political
obscenity.
A strike means a community of
academics and workers
temporarily out of work but not
out of action. A strike means

cessation ol' normal activities and
a profound disgust with such
aspects of normality as university
complicity in a wider war abroad
and the silent war at home; the
training, however voluntary, of
professional militarists on this
campus; the intricate and
widespread involvement of the
university and individual faculty
members in Defense Department
activities.
Finally, a strike means a
recognition that those people in
the Movement who for the past
five years have taken the lead in
the fight against war and
economic and political oppression
deserve our support and thanks.
They have brought political
consciousness to this campus and
are not the target of selective
police and other reprisals. We
cannot take over what has lor
months now been their political
position and tolerate their
systematic repression and
elimination from political life.
