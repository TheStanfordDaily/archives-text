# Music Dept.
## 
### 
We, the students and faculty of
the Department, agree to suspend
voluntarily all regular music major
classes from this time until the
Academic Senate meets on
Thursday, May 7. This suspension
will allow us to work during the
coming days to urge the Academic
Senate to take the following
actions next Thursday:
1. To move without delay
towards the complete lemoval of
the ROTC program from Stanford
University by the end of the
current academic year. We clearly
understand the potential financial
difficulties to the university which
may result from removal of
ROTC, and we therefore indicate
our willingness to share that
burden equitably.
2. To accept the Academic
Council's recommendation
condemning United States
involvement in the expansion of
the Southeast Asian war.
3. To implement immediately
the Senate's decision to send a
Stanford delegation to
Washington, in order to convey
directly to the Administration the
concern of the entire Stanford
community about President
Nixon's actions and their effect
on the University.
The Music Department
supports the following resolution,
passed on May 1 by the Academic
Council:"The Academic Council
requests the Senate to consider a
resolution condemning violence
wherever it occurs, whether on
campus or off, and requests the
Senate to dedicate itself to
seeking out and solving the
problems that trigger violence."
