# German Dept.
## 
### 
On 1 May 1970, we, the
graduate students and faculty of
the Department of German,
declared ourselves in favor of a
strike, that is, a suspension of
normal classes, until such time as

the Academic Senate had met and
discussed the issue of R.OTC and
the Academic Council resolution
concerning U.S. involvement in
Southeast Asia. We also urge that
the Academic Senate move to
terminate all war-oriented
research and to direct the
University and individual
researchers to explore alternative
means of securing financial
support, including re-channeling
of government resources from the
Department of Defense to other
agencies.
We are suspending normal
classes in order to devote our time
and energy to discuss with our
students the issues underlying the
current crisis both in the
University and in the Nation.
Whereas we deplore and
condemn the violence on this
campus, the attacks upon
members of the University
community and their residences,
and the destruction of property,
we are convinced that reliance
upon repressive force will not
solve the problem, but will only
escalate it. We believe that the
mood of violence is largely due to
the rapidly intensifiying
frustration and despair of our
students, shared in ever-increasing
numbers by the faculty.
As teachers and students
working in a department
dedicated to a humanistic
discipline, we feel that we would
be taking our custodianship too
lightly if we failed to take a stand
on matters which have riven the
University and the Nation. As a
department teaching German
language, literature, and
intellectual history, we are
particularly aware of the problem
of quiescence on the part of
intellectuals, scholars, and
teachers in the face of immoral
and illegal acts of their
governments. We know that if
the professors and students at
German universities had spoken
out unambiguously against the
Hitler government, the most
shameful chapter of German
history might not have been
writtenâ€”namely, the prostration
of a country's intellect before the
blandishments and threats of
governmental immorality and
folly.
