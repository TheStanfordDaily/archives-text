"We, as faculty and students in
the School of Engineering,
strongly urge all professors and
students to hold one, or more,
extraordinary discussion sessions
this week, during class hours and
outside. We believe it essential
that these discussion groups be
voluntary, and that they focus on
the relation between the
University, the war, and society.
"Further, we endorse the
Faculty Senate's action of April
30 to send a Stanford delegation
to Washington. We urge that the
entire University community
contribute in support of this
delegation."
