# The 						Pentagon Manager
## Packard-Defense's No. 2 Man 
### Mary Hanson 
David Packard, former president of the Board of
Trustees, had a large, possibly determining, role in
the U.S. invasion of Cambodia.
Deputy Secretary of Defense since 1969,
Packard redesigned the decisionmaking processesof
the Pentagon to "give . . . professional military
people a larger say in the decision," according to
Business Week, March 21, 1970. When J. William
Fulbright and John K. Galbraith say that the
generals are now in power, they are talking about
the new system that Packard organized. Last week,
military and political "chiefs" in Southeast Asia
were apparently the only people who knew what
was up, except for a group of five men in
Washington.
David Packard was also a member of the
"special action group" who met at length with
Nixon on April 23 and 24 to outline scenarios of
American military action in Cambodia.
In Saturday's Chronicle, Don Oberdorfer of the
Times-Post Service described in great detail how
the decision to invade Cambodia was made:
The American March
"Operation Prometheus, the American march
across the Cambodian border was devised by a
Washington Special action group of senior officials
and studied in detail by President Nixon. After the
National Security Council meeting of April 22, Mr.
Nixon activated the Washington special action
group (which) had been formed last spring after
North Korea shot down an American EC-121
reconnaissance plane and U.S. contingency plans
were found to be hopelessly deficient.
"The special action group met in Ihe White
House Thursday morning April 23, again that
evening, and on Friday, April 24, to produce a
series of possible U.S. actions. Its job was ... to
explore what could be done and investigate the
scenario and possible consequences of each course
of action. The members of the group were
Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs U.
Alexis Johnson; Deputy Defense Secretary David
Packard; Earle G. Wheeler, Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff; CIA Director Richard Helms, and
llenrv A. Kissinger, Mr. Nixon's staff advisor on
foreign affairs."
Senate Unaware
The meeting was so secret that even the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee was unaware of it.
Only hours before Nixon decided to send
American ground troops and planes into

Cambodia, the committee was asking Secretary of
State "Rogers not to send military" supplied to
Cambodia ... by Tuesday noon, final orders for
Operation Prometheus —as it is known in the
intelligence community—were dispatched to U.S.
commanders in Vietman,' according to
Oberdorfer. Nixon's military and political chiefs in
Asia were intimately involved, through Packard s
Pentagon communique system, in the whole plan
as it was developed.
As we enter our first Stanford strike, wo should
remember how far we and Packard have come in
the last two years. Two years ago, during our first
sit-in, he stepped up to the microphone and told
us to consider how our actions might hurt
Stanford and ourselves. We are flabergasted into
silence then,and eight months later Time Magazine
praised Packard's strong smooth approach to us,
saying it impressed members of Congress who were
evaluating his qualifications for the No. 2
Pentagon position then.
But his personal manner was a less important
factor to Nixon and the Congress than his
managerial biilliance; in building Hewlett-Packard
into a firm that did $96 million worth of defense
contracts in 1969, and in building Stanford as
head of the PACE program, as well as serving on
the Board of General Dynamics and Chase
Manhattan Bank, [business Week now call Packard
"The most powerful No. 2 man ever to hold the
job in the Pentagon. " His role in putting over the
lottery system, the Safeguard ABM, the new
weapons systems and the change in
decision-making at the Pentagon consistently
greater than Secretary Melvin Laird's role. "Today
he is a frequent visitor to the White House. He
serves on National Security Council committees
that help Nixon strike a balance between defense
and domestic priorities . . . Laird retains the right
to the last word. But Laird was a congressman for
sixteen years ... an d
in areas where lie lacks expertise, he defers to
Packard."
Packard the "expertise" to destroy the lives of
millions of Southeast Asians unless we act, and
unless countless Americans act also. Stanford is
the place where he got that kind of
expertise—think about it and act on it.

David Packard, former president of the Board of
Trustees, had a large, possibly determining, role in
the U.S. invasion of Cambodia.
Deputy Secretary of Defense since 1969,
Packard redesigned the decisionmaking processesof
the Pentagon to "give . . . professional military
people a larger say in the decision," according to
Business Week, March 21, 1970. When J. William
Fulbright and John K. Galbraith say that the
generals are now in power, they are talking about
the new system that Packard organized. Last week,
military and political "chiefs" in Southeast Asia
were apparently the only people who knew what
was up, except for a group of five men in
Washington.
David Packard was also a member of the
"special action group" who met at length with
Nixon on April 23 and 24 to outline scenarios of
American military action in Cambodia.
In Saturday's Chronicle, Don Oberdorfer of the
Times-Post Service described in great detail how
the decision to invade Cambodia was made:
The American March
"Operation Prometheus, the American march
across the Cambodian border was devised by a
Washington Special action group of senior officials
and studied in detail by President Nixon. After the
National Security Council meeting of April 22, Mr.
Nixon activated the Washington special action
