# Radical Nihilism
## Battle Between Good & Evil 
### YR President 
"Then I saw coming from the
mouth of the dragon, the
mouth of the beast, and the
mouth of the false prophet,
three foul spirits like frogs.
These spirits were devils, with
power to work miracles. They
were sent out to muster all the
kings of the world for the great
day of battle of God the
sovereign Lord. "
—Revelation: 16.13-14
We are witnessing the
dissolution of a community. The
day to day relations of
thoughtful, feeling individuals
have been disrupted. An
apocalyptic battle between Good
and Evil has occupied center
stage. It is inhuman, we are told,
to be neutral; if one is not part of
the solution, one is part of the
problem. There is no middle
ground. Peace, Love; Off the Pigs.
In this apocalyptic framework,
all diversity takes on an illusion of
consonance and simplicity.
Premise one is the inevitability of
struggle, and the rejection of
personal responsibility which that
tends to create. And premise two
is the portrayal of that struggle as
one of Good versus Bad, White
versus Black, Truth versus Falsity.
Such a clearcut situation all but
eliminates the problem of human
conscience. Each and every issue
becomes just another facet of the
great question of Right and

Wrong. The sorts of complexities
which have agonized great minds
throughout time have thus, for
some, become immaterial. These
people have achieved the
Understanding.
It is this simple-minded
presumption of Understanding,
rather than any fact of physical
destruction, which is the real
tragedy of Stanford and America
in the Spring of 1970. It is doubly
tragic, for it is a presumption as
common to the Establishment as
to those who seek to destroy that
Establishment.
Nixon's Nihilism
Thursday evening a nervous,
angry president told his people
that American power was being
applied in yet another Asian
nation. His reasoning was nearly
as bad as the worst of radical
nihilism: We must, he said,
expand the war to facilitate our
withdrawal.
Probably, though, he was not
struck by the absurdity of this
statement when he made it. For
with Mr. Nixon, as with so many
of our people today, the world
situation often breaks down to a
simple question of Good and Evil.
He, too, has the Understanding, in
the form of a firm belief in
America's Mission. Democracy,
Freedom, Justice and all the rest
are being challenged by the

Santanic forces of Communism.
That is the motive for deeper
involvement in a war which can't
be won; it is also the only basis on
which middle America could be
rallied to his support.
The complexities of the
argument again pale alongside the
worldwide clash of Right and
Wrong. THEY are testing OUR
will; we dare not fail.
We see around us, on all sides,
people who will no longer be
people. They have assumed the
role of Deliverer, and can no
longer afford the luxury of
self-doubt. They have
appropriated to themselves
powers which no man can execute
and none has a right to claim. In
marching to the cadence of their
"higher law" they have ignored
the basic ideal of human decency.
They have lost their singular
human quality in their failure to
recognize it in others.
Seperation
The police officer becomes a
pig. So, too, does the honest
individual who attends a radical
meeting and says"I believe you
are wrong." Those who
demonstrate their opposition to
government policy are similarly
packaged and dispensed with.
They are "nervous nellies,"
"effete snobs," or "impudent
bums." And they all take their
place on the other side of the wall
which separates the Kingdom of
Light from the Kingdom of
Darkness.
Whether one is Doing It in
Vietnam or at Stanford, the fact
of moral commitment to extreme
action seldom admits of rational
opposition. So long as we, as a
nation or as individuals, pretend
to play the apocalyptic role, we
will respond to our world in a
surrealistic way. And we will not
deal in any useful manner with
any of the problems that we face.
The first prerequisite of any
solution is the maintenance of a
sense of humanity—an
understanding and a respect for
what it means to be a human
being. It will not do to bisect
mankind into two groups, as has
so often been done. No matter
how one draws the line—between
the elect and the damned, the
people and the pigs, or the silent
Americans and the bums—it is a
defense of failure to deal with
one's fellows on a human level.
That failure belongs to every one
of us who has been guilty of such
categorical condemnation of other
people.
It's time to stop Doing It and
start trying to understand why it
has to be done.

Stanford Young Republicans and
a junior in history.)

statement when he made it. For
with Mr. Nixon, as with so many
of our people today, the world
situation often breaks down to a
simple question of Good and Evil.
He, too, has the Understanding, in
the form of a firm belief in
America's Mission. Democracy,
Freedom, Justice and all the rest
are being challenged by the

Santanic forces of Communism.
That is the motive for deeper
involvement in a war which can't
be won; it is also the only basis on
which middle America could be
rallied to his support.
The complexities of the
argument again pale alongside the
worldwide clash of Right and
Wrong. THEY are testing OUR
will; we dare not fail.
We see around us, on all sides,
people who will no longer be
people. They have assumed the
role of Deliverer, and can no
longer afford the luxury of
self-doubt. They have
appropriated to themselves
powers which no man can execute
and none has a right to claim. In
marching to the cadence of their
"higher law" they have ignored
the basic ideal of human decency.
They have lost their singular
human quality in their failure to
recognize it in others.
Seperation
The police officer becomes a
pig. So, too, does the honest
individual who attends a radical
meeting and says"I believe you
are wrong." Those who
demonstrate their opposition to
government policy are similarly
packaged and dispensed with.
They are "nervous nellies,"
"effete snobs," or "impudent
bums." And they all take their
place on the other side of the wall
which separates the Kingdom of
Light from the Kingdom of
Darkness.
Whether one is Doing It in
Vietnam or at Stanford, the fact
of moral commitment to extreme
action seldom admits of rational
opposition. So long as we, as a
nation or as individuals, pretend
to play the apocalyptic role, we
will respond to our world in a
surrealistic way. And we will not
deal in any useful manner with
any of the problems that we face.
The first prerequisite of any
solution is the maintenance of a
sense of humanity—an
understanding and a respect for
what it means to be a human
being. It will not do to bisect
mankind into two groups, as has
so often been done. No matter
how one draws the line—between
the elect and the damned, the
people and the pigs, or the silent
Americans and the bums—it is a
defense of failure to deal with
one's fellows on a human level.
That failure belongs to every one
of us who has been guilty of such
categorical condemnation of other
people.
It's time to stop Doing It and
start trying to understand why it
has to be done.

Stanford Young Republicans and

We are witnessing the
dissolution of a community. The
day to day relations of
thoughtful, feeling individuals
have been disrupted. An
apocalyptic battle between Good
and Evil has occupied center
stage. It is inhuman, we are told,
to be neutral; if one is not part of
the solution, one is part of the
problem. There is no middle
ground. Peace, Love; Off the Pigs.
In this apocalyptic framework,
all diversity takes on an illusion of
consonance and simplicity.
Premise one is the inevitability of
struggle, and the rejection of
personal responsibility which that
tends to create. And premise two
is the portrayal of that struggle as
one of Good versus Bad, White
versus Black, Truth versus Falsity.
Such a clearcut situation all but
eliminates the problem of human
conscience. Each and every issue
becomes just another facet of the
great question of Right and

Wrong. The sorts of complexities
which have agonized great minds
throughout time have thus, for
some, become immaterial. These
people have achieved the
Understanding.
It is this simple-minded
presumption of Understanding,
rather than any fact of physical
destruction, which is the real
tragedy of Stanford and America
in the Spring of 1970. It is doubly
tragic, for it is a presumption as
common to the Establishment as
to those who seek to destroy that
Establishment.
Nixon's Nihilism
Thursday evening a nervous,
angry president told his people
that American power was being
applied in yet another Asian
nation. His reasoning was nearly
as bad as the worst of radical
nihilism: We must, he said,
expand the war to facilitate our
withdrawal.
Probably, though, he was not
struck by the absurdity of this
statement when he made it. For

of our people today, the world

what it means to be a human
being. It will not do to bisect
mankind into two groups, as has
so often been done. No matter
how one draws the line—between
the elect and the damned, the
people and the pigs, or the silent
Americans and the bums—it is a
defense of failure to deal with
one's fellows on a human level.
That failure belongs to every one
of us who has been guilty of such
categorical condemnation of other
people.
It's time to stop Doing It and
start trying to understand why it
has to be done.
