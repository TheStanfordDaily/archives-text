After observing the strained
convolutions of Messrs. Sweeney
and Hukari for some time now, I
can't help but wonder as to
whether or not it is time for new
faces and ideas in the way of
Stanford Political Entertainment.
The occupation of Stanford
buildings, the perennial
"liberation" of White Plaza, let's
face it Mike, have somehow lost
that old spark of spontaneity.
Harvey old friend, the F. 8.1, don't
want any more photographs.
You're both becoming (dare I say
it?) boring.
Time was that the only political
activity on campus was the
Stanford Blacks. Remember
them? You knew where you were
with the Stanford Blacks. They
were solid, dependable. They
came up from middleclass L.A. in
their Buicks and Mustangs,
part-time Panthers and natural
hairdos, muttering darkly about
"ghettoes" and reciting whole
speeches from "Dutchman" at the
drop of an eyelid. They elbowed
lunchtime queues in the Coffee
House, and made it with all the
chicks, and anyone who objected
was a goddam racist.
Ah,.how can we forget those
good old days. The Stanford
Blacks made us feel . . . Guilty. It
was a clean, honest feeling. You
could be ashamed with the best of
them.

Mike and Harvey changed all
that. They brought new life into
what was fast becoming a dying
art. They widened all our
horizons. They "freed" us daily,
with matinee performances on
weekends. They never failed us,
and we are truly grateful.
But now is the time to bow out
gracefully, to make room for
younger, fresher men.
Harvey, some are born to
mediocrity, some achieve
mediocrity, and some have
mediocrity thrust upon them.
Take comfort in the fact that you
really made the grade.
Mike, your ever open mouth
was a constant inspiration to all of
us. In my mind's eye I will always
see you on a stage, alone under a
burning spotlight . . . reciting E.E.
Cummings perhaps . . .
"A politician is an arse that
everyone has sat upon except a
man."

Campus Fascism
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Community
against War and Fascism
condemns the actions of the
Stanford administration and the
police with regard to the recent
protests against ROTC and against
the American invasion of
Cambodia. We see these actions as
evidence of mounting fascism in
the United States, occasioned by
the seven crisis of U.S.
imperialism which has no other
means to perpetuate itself than
savage repression.
Furthermore, we recognize that
this repression is directed most
brutally at Third World people at
home and abroad. The fact that
the only people to be arrested and
sent to the hospital because of
beatings were a black person,
Bernell Mack, and a brown
person, Bijay Sharma, exposes this
racist character of fascism.
We support the concerned
international students in their
demands:
1 - That the University pay all
legal and medical expenses
incurred from Bijay's arrest.
2 - that the charges against
Bijay be dropped.
3 - that no actions be taken by
the immigration authorities
against Bijay arising from this
incident.
4 - that the University retain a
permanent lawyer for foreign
students.

We ask that all members of the
Stanford community support the
international students' demands
by attending a meeting at 8:00
p.m. at the International Center,
at which President Pitzer is
expected to present an adequate
response. Join in solidarity with
the international students tonight
at 8:00 p.m.
Stanford Community Against
War And Fascism
Local Fanatics
Editor, The Daily:
The willful, bigoted band of
fanatics that has been bringing
outrage after outrage to this
campus has got to be stopped.
Pros and cons of the ROTC
question have for the past month
been completely irrelevant. I
supported the petition that
brought the question to the
Academic Council and I still hold
my view. But that view was
defeated by a fair and proper vote
of the faculty, and a vote is a
vote. It passes belief that a small,
arrogant minority of this
community could set out to
overturn that decision by force.
For several weeks most of us
could not take this brazen threat
seriously. The off-ROTC cabal
will be gratified to know that I
now do take it seriously, and I
have some serious proposals:
(1) Henceforth, the entry of
the police onto the campus, in
whatever force is necessary to put
down illegal actions, should not
be a University policy decision. It
should be automatic. Individual
professors and University officers,
as citizens and men of
responsibility, already have the
right (indeed the duty) to call
directly for police protection and
assistance if they need it. They
should use this right. I intend to
do so.
(2) It is evident that for the
duration of the present crisis the
sheriff's office needs more
manpower to keep order, and to
keep the campus properly policed
at night. I propose that the
president arrange with the sheriff
to deputize members of our
community willing to perform
this service. I hereby volunteer.
(3) The ringleaders in acts of
disruption and distruction must
be identified and brought to
justice. If they are students they
should be expelled permanently.
If they are faculty they should be

dismissed permanently. All
responsible persons should assist
in this, even if it means
identifying personal friends. I
shall do so. We cannot let these
acts continue.
These are harsh words, and
they are not easy for me to
pronounce. But those who are
committed to violence have been
allowed too long to assume, in
their utter moral arrogance, that
they, and they only, have the
courage to match beliefs with
actions. (The "courage" of the
rock through a window in the
dark of night!)
There will be howls of anguish
this morning from people who
continue to plead for dialogue and
understanding, from those who
are unwilling to face head-on a
plain threat to this community's
existence. Let them howl. I
commend the president and the
provost for taking the steps that
had to be taken to deal with the
Union sit-ins. The time for
dialogue can come. But it can
come only after we have order.

Don'/ Be Deluded
Editor, The Daily:
Let us not be deluded into
thinking sit-ins are non-violent,
merely because the recent campus
ravages are more violent. Most of
the sit-ins at Stanford have started
with an act of physical violence - a
jimmied window, a sawed-through
door bolt, fisticuffs with
defending students. Every sit-in
has inflicted emotional violence
on the displaced persons concern
over potential loss of student
records, missing data and theses,
theft of personal possessions.
Every sit-in has led to intellectual
violence - selected use of searched
files for propaganda purposes,
seizure of salary records for
attempted blackmail, not to
mention creation of an emotional
atmosphere in which sensible
discussion of basic issues is all but
impossible.
Anyone who thinks these
situations are non-violent is
already developing an insensitivity
to human feelings which in itself
does violence to his better nature.
