# Pitzer Authorizes Police Procedure
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Administrative heads of
different University buildings have
been authorized the call in police
"directly without the President's
order and have been urged to
develop "round-the-clock"
surveillance—for passive defense
and fire protection by President
Pitzer.
"Even more drastic measured
must be considered" to stop the
campus violence that has racked
the campus this quarter Pitzer
told the faculty, Friday.
These could include: a curfew,
the closing of the campus to
unauthorized persons at all time,
immediate temporary suspension
or banishment from campus of
"those arrested for disruption
activities or charged with
substantial evidence for violation
of campus regulations related to
disruptions; and the possible use
of restraining orders and
injunctions.
Pitzer made his remarks in a
speech to the Academic Council
Friday at its emergency meeting
called to discuss campus violence.
"We must recognize the
declared commitment of a small
group to the destruction of the
University. Until the violence has
been stopped, we may have to
forgo other forms of protest,"
Pitzer said.
Committed To Violence
He defended the use of police
on campus and challenged those
who opposed the police here to
suggest "how the absence of
police would prevent further
attacks by the small group that is
openly and obviously committed
to violence."
Pitzer allowed that police
might occasionally "misjudge" an
onlooker for a participant and
that they "aren't going to be
gentle when facing a barrage of

rocks." However, he said they
have generally reacted with
"remarkable restraint." "I see no
possibility of bringing peace to
this campus without their help,"
he concluded.
Pitzer said the building officers
are now authorized "to close
physically the building or
space... if he has substantial
evidence it is threatened and to
call police directly, although if
possible through our security
officer," Mr. DeYoung.
He encouraged anyone with
information about criminal acts to
send the information in writing to
the President's office.
Campaign Of Terror
"A systematic campaign of
terror, designed to 'bring the
University to its knees' was
advocated and undertaken long
before" police were called on
campus, Pitzer said.
The curfew Pitzer said could be
imposed on the campus would be
"either total or only against
non-Stanford people." The curfew
and closing of the campus to
unauthorized persons "would
have to be enforced by police, and
violators . . . would be arrested on
mere presence . . . Such an action
would be harsh indeed—l hope we
aren't forced to it, he added.
Pitzer concluded his speech
with his promise "to defend this
University —to keep its essential
operations going—to fulfill its
responsibilities to students and
others."
Also in the speech, Pitzer listed
a long chronology of the
administration's views on
anti-ROTC movement's actions of
this quarter.
He said that "We face today
both an extreme emergency on
the Stanford campus and an
unprecedented national
constitutional crisis.

onlooker for a participant and
that they "aren't going to be
gentle when facing a barrage of

rocks." However, he said they
have generally reacted with
"remarkable restraint." "I see no
possibility of bringing peace to
this campus without their help,"
he concluded.
Pitzer said the building officers
are now authorized "to close
physically the building or
space... if he has substantial
evidence it is threatened and to
call police directly, although if
possible through our security
officer," Mr. DeYoung.
He encouraged anyone with
information about criminal acts to
send the information in writing to
the President's office.
Campaign Of Terror
"A systematic campaign of
terror, designed to 'bring the
University to its knees' was
advocated and undertaken long
before" police were called on
campus, Pitzer said.
The curfew Pitzer said could be
imposed on the campus would be
"either total or only against
non-Stanford people." The curfew
and closing of the campus to
unauthorized persons "would
have to be enforced by police, and
violators . . . would be arrested on
mere presence . . . Such an action
would be harsh indeed—l hope we
aren't forced to it, he added.
Pitzer concluded his speech
with his promise "to defend this
University —to keep its essential
operations going—to fulfill its
responsibilities to students and
others."
Also in the speech, Pitzer listed
a long chronology of the
administration's views on
anti-ROTC movement's actions of
this quarter.
He said that "We face today
both an extreme emergency on
the Stanford campus and an
unprecedented national
constitutional crisis.
Administrative heads of
different University buildings have
been authorized the call in police
"directly without the President's
order and have been urged to
develop "round-the-clock"
surveillance—for passive defense
and fire protection by President
Pitzer.
"Even more drastic measured
must be considered" to stop the
campus violence that has racked
the campus this quarter Pitzer
told the faculty, Friday.
These could include: a curfew,
the closing of the campus to
unauthorized persons at all time,
immediate temporary suspension
or banishment from campus of
"those arrested for disruption
activities or charged with
substantial evidence for violation
of campus regulations related to
disruptions; and the possible use
of restraining orders and
injunctions.
Pitzer made his remarks in a
speech to the Academic Council
Friday at its emergency meeting
called to discuss campus violence.
"We must recognize the
declared commitment of a small
group to the destruction of the
University. Until the violence has
been stopped, we may have to
forgo other forms of protest,"
Pitzer said.
Committed To Violence
He defended the use of police
on campus and challenged those
who opposed the police here to
suggest "how the absence of
police would prevent further
attacks by the small group that is
openly and obviously committed
to violence."
Pitzer allowed that police
might occasionally "misjudge" an
onlooker for a participant and
that they "aren't going to be
gentle when facing a barrage of

rocks." However, he said they
have generally reacted with
"remarkable restraint." "I see no
possibility of bringing peace to
