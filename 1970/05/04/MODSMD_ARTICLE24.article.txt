# Friday Night Protest Quiet Police Bring In Helicoptor
## 
### 
The campus was relatively quiet
Friday night as the police
introduced a new tactic —a
helicopter equipped with a
carbon-arc spotlight.
Most of the evening's activities
centered around Encina Hall and
the ROTC building. Less than a
dozen windows were broken and
one door was smashed in Encina
and Lou Henry Hoover building
shortly before midnight. No
damage was rcpr-ited Lt the ROTC
headquarters.
Although Mtiicr compared to
previous evenings, the
disturbances marked the third
straight night of anti-ROTC
violence.
In a possibly related incident,
ROTC commander Col. Stanley
Ramey's house in Los Altos was
raked by several shotgun blasts.

The small helicopter was used
twice during the evening, once as
a group of Stanford students
marched to a rally and dance on
Lytton Plaza, and later when
about 100 demonstrators marched
from Stern lawn to Encina and
the ROTC building.
The aircraft carried no
markings but was based on the
Stanford Police Department's
parking lot, where it was guarded
by several riot-equipped officers.
It was reportedly leased by the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
office for the evening. An
administration spokesman said
that the helicopter carried no
teargas.
The demonstrators responded
to the helicopter and its powerful
searchlight by forming a large
spellout in Escondido Street near
Stern Hall. Using football game
tactics, they shouted out their
message on the count of three and
flashed the appropriate hand
signals.
Lytton Plaza Rally
Policemen at the Palo Alto
rally, including the
plainclothesmen, were dressed in

padded flack jackets, helmets, leg
padding, combat boots, and most
were carrying teargas, teargas
masks, and heavy black
nightsticks. In addition, several
fog generators, reportedly
carrying pepper fog, were in
evidence.
One 17-year old youth was
arrested after he threw a bottle at
a police officer in the parking lot
next to the plaza. His
identification was not
immediately released.
Renewed Action
The dance and rally started to
break up shortly before 10 p.m.,
and about half the crowd make its
way back to the Stanford campus.
At Encina, the demonstrators
were met by about 100 members
of the non-violent group who
alternately sat on the Encina lawn
and stood on the sidewalk with
arms linked to prevent a direct
confrontation with the busload of
policemen present.
The demonstrators, including a
large number of what appeared to
be high school students, then
moved down the street towards
the ROTC building, where they
were again kept away from the
building by the non-violent group,
who again blocked the street by
standing with their arms linked.
No damage to the ROTC building
was reported.
Earlier in the evening, one or
more cars were reported to
bycircling the campus, shooting
cars with marbles and a
motorcyclist with a mace-like
substance. Art Busse, whose car
was parked on Palm Drive,
reported that his tires were
slashed, and that as he was
inspecting the damage, someone
drove by and shot marbles at the
car.
Shortly before 11 p.m., a
cyclist on Campus Drive across
from Manzanita Park was forced
to ditch his bike as he was sprayed
in the eyes by a passing car. He
was taken to Stanford Hospital by
ambulance. His condition was not
immediately known.

and Lou Henry Hoover building

damage was rcpr-ited Lt the ROTC
headquarters.

previous evenings, the
disturbances marked the third
straight night of anti-ROTC

The small helicopter was used
twice during the evening, once as
a group of Stanford students
marched to a rally and dance on
Lytton Plaza, and later when
about 100 demonstrators marched
from Stern lawn to Encina and
the ROTC building.
The aircraft carried no
markings but was based on the
Stanford Police Department's
parking lot, where it was guarded
by several riot-equipped officers.
It was reportedly leased by the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
office for the evening. An
administration spokesman said
that the helicopter carried no
teargas.
The demonstrators responded
to the helicopter and its powerful
searchlight by forming a large
spellout in Escondido Street near
Stern Hall. Using football game
tactics, they shouted out their
message on the count of three and
flashed the appropriate hand
signals.
Lytton Plaza Rally
Policemen at the Palo Alto
rally, including the
plainclothesmen, were dressed in

padded flack jackets, helmets, leg
padding, combat boots, and most
were carrying teargas, teargas
masks, and heavy black
nightsticks. In addition, several
fog generators, reportedly
carrying pepper fog, were in
evidence.
One 17-year old youth was
arrested after he threw a bottle at
a police officer in the parking lot
next to the plaza. His
identification was not
immediately released.
Renewed Action
The dance and rally started to
break up shortly before 10 p.m.,
and about half the crowd make its
way back to the Stanford campus.
At Encina, the demonstrators
were met by about 100 members
of the non-violent group who
alternately sat on the Encina lawn
and stood on the sidewalk with
arms linked to prevent a direct
confrontation with the busload of
policemen present.
The demonstrators, including a
large number of what appeared to
be high school students, then
moved down the street towards
the ROTC building, where they
were again kept away from the
building by the non-violent group,
who again blocked the street by
standing with their arms linked.
No damage to the ROTC building
was reported.
Earlier in the evening, one or
more cars were reported to
bycircling the campus, shooting
cars with marbles and a
motorcyclist with a mace-like
substance. Art Busse, whose car
was parked on Palm Drive,
reported that his tires were
slashed, and that as he was
inspecting the damage, someone
drove by and shot marbles at the
car.
Shortly before 11 p.m., a
cyclist on Campus Drive across
from Manzanita Park was forced
to ditch his bike as he was sprayed
in the eyes by a passing car. He
was taken to Stanford Hospital by
ambulance. His condition was not
immediately known.
The campus was relatively quiet
Friday night as the police
introduced a new tactic —a
helicopter equipped with a
carbon-arc spotlight.
Most of the evening's activities
centered around Encina Hall and
the ROTC building. Less than a
dozen windows were broken and
one door was smashed in Encina
and Lou Henry Hoover building
shortly before midnight. No
damage was rcpr-ited Lt the ROTC
headquarters.
