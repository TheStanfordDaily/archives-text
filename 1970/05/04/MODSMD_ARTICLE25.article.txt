# Strike Successful
## 
### 
While 250 anti-ROTC,
anti-Cambodia demonstrators
peacefully blocked entrance to
Encina Hall late Friday afternoon,
40 Santa Clara County deputies
swept across Encina lawn in an
ineffectual attempt to disperse
some 400 other demonstrators.
The student strike was
evidently highly successful as
many classes were cancelled and
many others discussed recent
campus events and the Cambodian
invasion. Faculty attendence at
the extended Academic Council
meeting made it difficult to gauge
the precise effects of the strike.
Strikers sat in classroom doors
from the Medical School, Business
School, Aero-space to
Engineering, Hoover Tower and
the ROTC building. The Business
School suspended classes for the
rest of the day at 10 a.m.
Two Stanford police cars were
called to Engineering corner at
7:40 Friday morning to break up
a scuffle between strikers from
Junipero House and engineering
students accompanied by Civil
Engineering Professor Clarkeson
Ogleby.
Several hundred students
massed outside Dinkelspiel
Auditorium listened to a live
broadcast of the Academic
Council meeting that began inside
at 11:00 (see related story). The
Con Home strawberry brunch on
the grass in front of Tresidder
stood in serene contrast to the
crowd of listening students.
Encina Blocked
Around noon part of the
crowd moved to Encina and took
up positions in the doorways.
Some employees stepped on
demonstrators to gain entrance to
the building while others
remained outside discussing the
strike with the protestors.
The strike action stopped work
in all of Encina's main wing
except for work in the basement.
Daryl Pearson, university General
Secretary, declared that the
students did "shut this place
down." By midafternoon, 70 of
the 100 secretaries in Encina were
sent home. Many in the building
feared that students would stone
the offices.
At about 1:20 a demonstrator
sitting in the main door was
kicked in the back by an unknown
assailant. The demonstrator, John
Kathe, a sophomore, was
reportedly badly bruised in the
lower back and was taken by
ambulance to Cowell Health
Center and later released.
Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley declared that the
University was "aggressively
pursuing the individual
responsible." He stated that
"indications are that the man
responsible was an employee in
Encina's west wing. We are
making every effort to find the
man."

Police were alerted Saturday
morning that some trouble was
anticipated at Encina Hall.
Shortly after 2 p.m Tamm and
Rosa were radioed a report of a
man in distress at Hoover Tower.
No such occurence took place.
They stopped at Encina, where a
crowd of perhaps 300—containing
many Encina employees, mothers
and children, and many
athletes—were gathered, and
inquired whether any employees
were being barred from entering
the building.
Arrests
Bruce L. Wiggins, a University
Security Manager, asked to be
escorted through the front door,
and Tamm and Rosa directly
confronted twenty demonstrators
who blocked the entrance. Tamm
told the demonstrators that they
were in violation of the law and
tha they would all be subject to
arrest.
The demonstrators replied that
they were not directly preventing
employees from entering, because
if people wanted to enter, they
could. They pointed out that
anyone entering would naturally
have to step on those blocking the
entrance—but that the employees
were free to do that. Tamm
declared that Wiggins shouldn't
have to walk over people to get
into the building.
At approximately 2:40 Tamm
and Rosa arrested two
demonstrators, Peter V. Maggio
and Paul Moser, for blocking the
entrance. With the crowd aroused,
they escorted the two to the
patrol car where approximately
150 sat in a ring around the car.
Tamm declared to the
gathering that he alone was
"making all the decisions and
would continue to make all
decisions." Rosa further stated
that "Tamm and I will arrest as
many 'as we can—You can resist if
you want." However, the pair of
officers made only the two
arrests.
With the crowd steadily
growing and many ringing the
patrol car, four more patrol cars
and a paddy wagon arrived.
Twelve police formed a path so
that Moser and Maggio could be
conducted to a Stanford fire
department wagon and were taken
away. The police cars and paddy
wagon then left, with many
demonstrators beating on the
vehicles as they left.
More Forces
At 3:15 the busload of 40
deputies—in full riot gear and
equipped with tear gas
cannisters —arrived along with a
truckload of Milpitas police. They

immediately formed a long line in
front of Encina, while 250
demonstrators sat tightly packed
on the Encina Hall steps. A slow
sweep commenced across the
lawn, driving the 400 other
demonstrators across Galvez
street.
After about five minutes of
inaction, the commanding officer
shouted "Alright men, let's move
back to the bus," and the line
slowly retreated with the crowd in
equally slow pursuit. A hand-held
line of students from the
non-violent group attempted to
encircle the police bus while
keeping the more vocal of the
demonstrators back.
The police bus backed down
Serra Street behind a line of 16
police and the 150 demonstrators
further pursued them down the
street chanting "push 'em back,
push 'em back, way back."
Finally, as students called "let
them go," the police boarded the
bus and left.
When questioned later about
the incident, Captain Rosa said,
"The confrontation this afternoon
at Encina . . . was an error ... A
sit-in is legal as long as it doesn't
violate other people's rights."
Conferences
After the police left Encina,
two separate discussions
developed. The "non-violent
group" (students who sat down
Thursday night between polce and
rock-throwers) held an
inconclusive discussion on
whether to follow the "Off
ROTC" contingent on their
planned march to Lytton Plaza.
The second group of twenty
people still sitting against the
Encina doors decided that the
building had been effectively
closed and that it was pointless to
be arrested—since by 4:00
virtually no work was going on
inside the building. They then
agreed to leave Encina at 5:00 and
spread word that the militant
non-violent strike would continue
at 7:30 a.m. Monday.
They agreed to continue to
support three aims: 1. an
immediate end to ROTC on
campus; 2. "Out of Cambodia,
out of Vietnam" 3. an immediate
end to political trials in this
country.
