# Faculty Group
## 
### 
Liberal to left-wing faculty
members will be meeting tonight
to form a permanent campus
political organization.
According to Associate
Professor of History, Mark
Mancall, "the purpose of this is to
begin to utilize the political
processes to push for reform on
campus in an organized fashion."
The caucus plans to endorse
candidates for future faculty
Senate elections, in addition to
issuing a general platform.
The group plans to probe not
only ROTC, but wider issues of
campus life and of Stanford's
relation to the rest of the world.
Mancall cited the ad hoc
handling of the recent crisis in the
University as a spur for the
group's organization, "The faculty
has avoided its responsibility by
dealing with issues on such a
basis."
Tonight's meeting will be held
at 7:30 in the large lounge of
Tresidder Union.
Organizers of the group include
Mancall; Hal Holman, professor of
medicine; Ronald Rebholz,
professor of English; and Sumner
Kalman, professor of
nharmacologv.
