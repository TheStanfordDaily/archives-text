# Anti-War March In Palo Alto Today
## 
### 
"Well," said one Moratorium
leader after viewing the
President's speech last week,
"Nixon is even deader than we are
now."
Responding with angry
quickness to the President's
escalation of the Southeast Asian
war, the Mid-Peninsula
Moratorium is out to prove that
the President has indeed signed his
political suicide note, and at the
same time breathed new life into
the anti-war movement.
Acting in concert with other
peace groups in Palo Alto, the
Moratorium has planned "a major
anti-war march" for today in Palo
Alto. The march will begin from
Lytton Plaza in Palo Alto at noon,
and culminate in a rally at El
Camino Park, near Alma Street
and El Camino Real, where Nobel
Laureate Linus Pauling,
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos,
and Congressional candidate Stu
McLean will speak.
According to Hal Mickelson,
the ASSU Council of Presidents is
endorsing the march. Hal said the
Council will be in Palo Alto
Monday at noon and urges all
students to join the march.
National Crisis
In a statement released
Saturday, the Moratorium stated,
"President Nixon's announcement
of deeper involvement in
Southeast Asia amounts to a'
national crisis which makes the
need for immediate withdrawal of
all our troops more urgent than
ever before."
In an emergency meeting
Friday night, the Moratorium
Steering Committee adopted the
following proposals for action to
protest the escalation of the war.

—a statement of support for
"any non-violent form of no
business as usual, including the
calls for a student strike on
campuses across the nation;
—a call for a general strike
today in the mid-Peninsula, urging
people to "refrain from
transacting any business, and
attend the non-violent, legal
Moratorium march;
—a call for all Peninsula city
councils to adopt resolutions such
as that passed by the
Massachusetts legislature and now
in the California Assembly, which
forbids any resident to participate
in an undeclared and illegal war
(such a resolution is on the agenda
of the May 11 meeting of the Palo
Alto City Council);and
—a demand that Congress end
all appropriations immediately for
"any military operations in
Indochina, except the withdrawal
of troops."
Delegate to Capitol
To lobby for the latter demand,
and to express "our distress over
this highly provocative escalation
of the war" the Moratorium is
planning to send a delegate to
Washington to talk to members of
Congress.
The Moratorium will also
contribute $200 to help finance
the delegation that Stanford is
sending to Washington to discuss
with Congress the escalating war,
and other national problems that
are excelerating campus tensions.
Students wishing to serve as
monitors for the march are urged
to come to the ASSU office at
10:30 this morning. Leal'letting
will be conducted both before and
after the march.

Congress.
The Moratorium will also
contribute $200 to help finance
the delegation that Stanford is
sending to Washington to discuss
with Congress the escalating war,
and other national problems that
are excelerating campus tensions.
Students wishing to serve as
monitors for the march are urged
to come to the ASSU office at
10:30 this morning. Leal'letting
will be conducted both before and
after the march.
"Well," said one Moratorium
leader after viewing the
President's speech last week,
"Nixon is even deader than we are
now."
Responding with angry
quickness to the President's
escalation of the Southeast Asian
war, the Mid-Peninsula
Moratorium is out to prove that
the President has indeed signed his
political suicide note, and at the
same time breathed new life into
the anti-war movement.
Acting in concert with other
peace groups in Palo Alto, the
Moratorium has planned "a major
anti-war march" for today in Palo
Alto. The march will begin from
Lytton Plaza in Palo Alto at noon,
and culminate in a rally at El
Camino Park, near Alma Street
and El Camino Real, where Nobel
Laureate Linus Pauling,
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos,
and Congressional candidate Stu
McLean will speak.
According to Hal Mickelson,
the ASSU Council of Presidents is
endorsing the march. Hal said the
Council will be in Palo Alto
Monday at noon and urges all
students to join the march.
National Crisis
In a statement released
Saturday, the Moratorium stated,
"President Nixon's announcement
of deeper involvement in
Southeast Asia amounts to a'
national crisis which makes the
need for immediate withdrawal of
all our troops more urgent than
ever before."
In an emergency meeting
Friday night, the Moratorium
Steering Committee adopted the
following proposals for action to
protest the escalation of the war.

—a statement of support for
"any non-violent form of no
business as usual, including the
calls for a student strike on
campuses across the nation;
—a call for a general strike
today in the mid-Peninsula, urging
people to "refrain from
transacting any business, and
attend the non-violent, legal
Moratorium march;
—a call for all Peninsula city
councils to adopt resolutions such
as that passed by the
Massachusetts legislature and now
in the California Assembly, which
forbids any resident to participate
in an undeclared and illegal war
(such a resolution is on the agenda
of the May 11 meeting of the Palo
Alto City Council);and
—a demand that Congress end
all appropriations immediately for
"any military operations in
Indochina, except the withdrawal
of troops."
Delegate to Capitol
To lobby for the latter demand,
and to express "our distress over
this highly provocative escalation
of the war" the Moratorium is
planning to send a delegate to
Washington to talk to members of
Congress.
The Moratorium will also
contribute $200 to help finance
the delegation that Stanford is
sending to Washington to discuss
with Congress the escalating war,
and other national problems that
are excelerating campus tensions.
