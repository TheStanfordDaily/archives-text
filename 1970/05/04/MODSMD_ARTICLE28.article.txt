# Students Arraigned; Sapir Bail $10,000
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Stanford medical student Marc Sapir, arrested Thursday morning
for assault with a deadly weapon, was released yesterday on $10,000
bail.
His arraignment was the most noteworthy of the many Stanford
cases which logjammed North Santa Clara County Courthouse Friday.
In other actions at the courthouse the persons who gave themselves
up to police at the Old Union Wednesday night were arraigned on
charges of criminal trespass. The six men and three women were
released Friday evening, after bails of $125 each were raised by
friends and Legal Defense.
Finally, two of the non-violent demonstrators who sat on the steps
of Encina Hall Friday afternoon were booked on charges of loitering
failure to disperse and failure to give identification. Bail for Peter V.
Maggio and Paul Moser was set at $440 for each.
The circumstances surrounding the arrest of Sapir, a well known
campus radical have been widely questioned. Bill Evers, recent
candidate for the ASSU presidency, has called for an independent
investigation of the incident. Other Stanford radicals claim that police
plotted the arrest.
Lt. Press Ray, information officer for the Palo Alto Police
Department, stated that the officers who arrested Sapir were on
regular patrol and were unaware that they were on the street where
Sapir lived.
According to Ray, two plainclothes policemen in an unmarked car
spotted a man with a shotgun standing on a lawn. The officers
reportedly turned and stopped in front of the house, whereupon Sapir
is alleged to have pointed the 12-guage shotgun at them. The officers
then identified themselves and, after calling a uniformed policeman to
the scene, put Sapir under arrest.
Sapir's preliminary hearing is set for 2 p.m., May 14 at North
County Courthouse. The nine persons released Friday night from San
Jose County Jail and the women's division of the Elmwood
Rehabilitation center at Milpitas were Carol Wilson, Molly Cooke,
Edith Kusnic, David Fidanque, Paul Johnston, Kit Taylor, Szelbelski
Freeman, Stephen Borish and Henry Anderson.
The tenth protestor, Patricia Neely was released Thursday on $125
bail.
Friday afternoon Moser and Maggio joined a crowd of students
which blocked the doors of Encina Hall in an attempt to shut down
routine University operations. Two officers picked them out at
random from the crowd, and arrested them. Captain Tom Rosa of the
Santa Clara Sheriff's office however, told a meeting of non-violent
demonstrators Friday night, "The confrontation this afternoon at
Encina . . . was an error."
When asked if the charges against Moser and Maggio would be
dropped, he said he wished to give no comment.

Encina . . . was an error."
When asked if the charges against Moser and Maggio would be
dropped, he said he wished to give no comment.
