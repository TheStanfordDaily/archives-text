President Pitzer has asked Dr.

interim study group to determine
"the mandate and composition"
of a Commission on Campus
Protest. The Daily Friday
incorrected identified Dr.
Katchadourian's group as the
Commission itself.
In Pitzer's statement read over
KZSU last week, he proposed the
establishment of a Commission to
determine the appropriate limits
of protest on this campus, the
response of the University to
conduct which exceeds these
limits, and the responsibilities of
individual faculty, students, and
staff at times of disruptive
conduct.
Pitzer emphasized that the
Commission should study the
causes of the disruptions here, and
what role the decision-making
institutions play in their response
to student dissent.
The interim study group
headed by Dr. Katchadourian will
seek to define the limits of the
Commission's study, how it
should proceed, and what its
membership should be. Hearings
from all concerned groups will be
held in the next few weeks.
The report of the interim study
group is scheduled to be
completed by .June 1, and
Commission members will then be
appointed as soon as possible to
begin their work.
