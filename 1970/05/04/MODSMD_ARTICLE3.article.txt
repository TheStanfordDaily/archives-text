# ROTC Credit, Cambodia Draw Requests For Senate Review
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Faculty members Friday at an
emergency Academic Council
meeting asked the Faculty Senate
to consider "without delay
terminating academic credit for
ROTC at the end of the current
academic year."
By a similar constitutional
maneuver of asking the Senate to
consider a resolution, the faculty
condemned President Nixon's
actions in Cambodia as "unwise,
immoral, and harmful.' 1
Both actions were worded as
proposals for consideration by the
Senate because the Academic
Council has no power to enact
legislation of its own. However,
the resolutions expressed faculty
members' criticism of the war in
Cambodia and view that credit
should not be given for ROTC
courses.
Without dissent the Council
also asked the Senate to consider
a resolution "condemning
violence wherever it occurs,
whether on campus or off, and

dedicate itself to seeking out and
solving the problems that trigger
violence."
Emergency Meeting
The actions came at a
three-hour emergency meeting of
the Academic Council called by
President Pitzer in the face of
several weeks of campus violence.
About 650 of the slightly more
than 1000 faculty members
attended the meeting, although
only about 400 were present
when the votes on the referrals
were taken.
The vote on terminating credit
for ROTC followed the
announcement by President
Kenneth Pitzer Thursday that he
was referring the entire ROTC
question back to the Advisory
Committee on ROTC and a
faculty Senate statement
endorsing the action. The faculty
evidently expressed its opinion in
a divided voice vote that ROTC
courses should not be granted
credit.
The resolution on Cambodia
"urges members of Congress to
use every legal means to resist the
implementation" of the decision
on Cambodia after citing four
reasons for the Senate to take the
action.
Council's Reasons
These are that the,
committment of "American
ground combat forces to action
on Cambodian territory .
1. was taken without
consultation of Congress, thus
violating the spirit if not the letter
of the Constitution;and
2. will probably result in
widening and complicating a cruel
and immoral war that we wish to
see liquidated;and
3. will further undermine the

confidence of other nations in the
morality and credibility of the
U.S. Government; and
4. is deeply exacerbating the
distrust of Stanford students and
faculty in the U.S. government."
The meeting was delayed for a
few minutes at the beginning
when Pitzer, who chaired the
meeting when it began, asked
unauthorized people present to
leave. About 60 people, mostly
students, left the building to
applause of the faculty members.
About midway through the
meeting, at 12:30, the Council
was interrupted when a group of
foreign students entered
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. A
spokesman for the group said that
they were not going to disrupt the
meeting but that they had had an
appointment with President Pitzer
at noon. Since he was at the
meeting, they had come to
present him with a demand.
Demands To Pitzer
William Clebsch, chairing the
meeting, then asked that only one
member of the group enter the
room. A few came down the steps
and handed the demands to
Pitzer, and left immediately.
The demands arc concerning
Bijay Sharma who is a foreign
student arrested Wednesday and
allegedly beaten. The foreign
students claim that Sharma was an
innocent bystander when arrested.
Earlier in the meeting two
professors presented President
Kenneth Pitzer with a petition
supporting him in using any legal
means necessary to stop the
violence present on the campus
this quarter. It was signed by over
2200 faculty, staff, and students
and was circulated by the CAC
(Coalition for an Academic
Community I
