# Fear Nation's Capitol
## Crime On The Rise In Washington 
### LANG ATWOOD 
WASHINGTON, D C. - Fear has
this city firmly in its grip. It's
mainly a fear of street crime and
its manifested by triple-locked
doors, deserted streets and heavy
police patrols.
Several years ago street
crimes —robberies, beatings,
assaults and car thefts began to
increase dramatically.
Washington is 60 percent black,
the suburbs in nearby Maryland
and Virginia are almost totally
white. In most of the crimes the
assailants and victims were black.
There were also some well
publicized attacks on
congressional staff members on
Capitol Hill, but the police
generally left the residents of the

central city i fenr 1 for
themselves.
About a year ago, mayor Waiter
Washington realized that the
crime situation had gotten out of
hand. Tourists were staying away,
business in the District was
declining, and the numerous
attacks on foreign diplomats were
becoming embarrassing.
Action Promised
He promised action, which
meant simply more police. A
thousand more men were to be
recruited by June 30, to bring the
size of the Metropolitan police
force to 5100. A new
communications system was
organized and heavy emphasis was
put on making the policeman
more visible to the public.

In an effort to get quick,
dramatic results, '200 men were
put on little motorscooters—a
compromise between walking the
beat and riding in a squad car.
Another 600 men were put on
overtime and sent out to walk the
beat.
In statistical terms this plan has
worked. The crime rate in
Washington has been dropping
significantly for the last four
months. Police and city officials
are happy but cautious about the
future. Some believe that more
police will not reduce the crime
rate any further. Others point to
the near-failure of the community
relations program and are
wondering what will happen this
summer.
Atmosphere Unchanged
The atmosphere, however, has
not changed. The downtown area
is deserted after dark, and people
will cross the street to avoid
meeting someone else on the
sidewalk at dusk. The newspapers
still give crime stories big play and
most people refuse to budge from
the houses after work. Census
takers are having problems with
housewives who refuse to open
their doors.
The police can now arrive at a
serious crime in two
minutes —usually about 75
seconds too late to catch anyone.
The White House Police Force is
adding 600 men to protect all the
embassies, while the U.S. Park
Police busy themselves by
arresting kite flyers who violate an
1H92 law.

All of these efforts are doomed,
however, unless the climate of the
city can be restored. You can feel
the tension and fear in the streets.
And it is not really comfortable
living in a mini-police state.
Too Much Money
No one has dared attack the
real causes of crime in
Washington. That would involve
too much money, according to
Congress, which controls the
District's purse strings. The jails
are overcrowded and the courts
are heavily strained.
While unemployment creeps up

across the country, it is leaping in
Washington. Hard core drug
addiction is also a major problem.
No real solutions are in sight.
Only proposals for preventative
detention and no-knock searches.
There is a strong feeling among
young blacks and whites here that
given the mood of the country
and the administration, it will be a
long time before Washington can
become a happy city again. The
Nation's Capitol is far from being
the showcase of America. It may,
however, represent the future of
America's cities—not a pleasant
picture.
