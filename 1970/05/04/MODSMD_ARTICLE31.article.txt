# Bijay Group Lists Demands To Pitzer
## 
### 
Friends of Bijay Sharma, the
Indian Graduate student arrested
and allegedly beaten Wednesday
night, have presented five
demands to President Pitzer.
The group, which will await
Pitzer's reply at 8 p.m. tonight in
the International Center, says that
it is not related to the violent
Off-ROTC movement, but that it
will take "strong actions" if its
demands are not met.
According to a spokesman at
the I-Center, "We felt he (Pitzer)
was concerned, but not serious."
The demands are as follows:
I—That the University pay all
expenses incurred from legal and
medical services needed by Bijay;
2—That all charges against Bijay
be dropped;
3—That any retaliatory actions
by the immigration authorities be
prevented;

4—That the University
immediately provide permanent
legal defense for the Foreign
students; and
s—That the University
implement these demands by 8
p.m. tonight.
Sharma is charged with "failure
to disperse" and "Interference
with a police officer in the
performance of his duties." He
has been released on bail which
was raised by students at the
I-Center. He was operated on
Friday afternoon at Cowell Health
Center for a fracture of his
cheekbone.
According to one foreign
student who prefers to remain
anonymous, "We know that the
district attorney would like to
drop the charges, but he is afraid
that if they admit that Sharma's
arrest was a mistake that he will
sue. W>i now know of at least one
faculty member and students who
witnessed the beating."
According to Bill Wyman,
assistant to the President, the
district attorney has not yet
reviewed the report of one of the
policemen involved in the arrest.
There is no information in that
report concerning the reasons for
the arrest or beating.
"It is one of those terrible
events that happen when this
turmoil and violence occur," says
Wyman. Concerning the demands,
Wyman said, "we intend to
respond to them and do what we
can We can't drop charges since
these are made by the police, not
us."
