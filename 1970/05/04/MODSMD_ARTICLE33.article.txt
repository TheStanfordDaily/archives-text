# Criticize Administration
## Some Police May Not Return 
### 
Some police departments that
have helped quell violent ROTC
demonstrations here during the
last three weeks may not return if
there is more trouble.
San Jose and Sunnyvale police
chiefs announced Friday that
their men would stay at home
because high casualty rates have
depleted their forces.
The law officers' decisions
come at a time when President
Kenneth Pitzer is under heavy
police pressure to take a firmer
stand against demonstrators. Last
Friday the President met with
Santa Clara County Sheriff
Charles Pressnik to discuss the
situation.
Stanford's administrative
handling of the crisis has become
a campaign issue in the race for
Santa Clara County Sheriff. Last
Friday Santa Clara's Undersheriff

James M. Geary who is a leading
candidate for Sheriff said the
deputies hands had been tied
because the Stanford
administration has "taken no
positive stand."
Geary said his men have been
"put through the meat grinder
during Stanford's anti-ROTC
violence." "It's a big, dark
campus," he added, "and deputies
loaded down with tactical
equipment have a hard time
keeping up with demonstrators. It
is physically impossible to chase
after them. They know every
alleyway and darkway."
Geary's comments were at a
community forum at which the
other candidates also appeared.
Most of the other sheriff-hopefuls
directed their criticism at the way
the present sheriff's office has
handled the disruptions.

San Jose patrolman Harold
Ratliff claimed, "Sheriff's action
at Stanford has been one of the
most mismanaged operations in
the history of Santa Clara
County."
He and other sheriff candidates
suggested that the department
begin taking pictures of protesters
and identifying them.
Sheriff's Lieutenant Frank
Howard, citing the 34 injuries
incurred by deputies Thursday
night, called for University and
community support and said, "I
expect expulsion from school
with no opportunity to return for
all students involved in the
violence."
Pitzer had no comment
yesterday on the charges, but in a
statement said he is considering
placing a curfew on the campus.
