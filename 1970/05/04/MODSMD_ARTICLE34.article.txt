# Roundup: Indians Bite Dust
## 
### 
What started out as a pretty good weekend
Friday afternoon at Sunken Diamond turned into
a fairly dismal weekend on all athleiic fronts.
The baseball team which pulled itself back into
title contention with a fine showing last weekend
in Los Angeles finds itself against the wall again.
After defeating Oregon twice on Friday, 8-6 and
13-4, the Indians lost a pair to Oregon State
Saturday, 5-1 and 3-1.
And if that weren't sad enough, outstanding
freshman first baseman Mike Nelson fractured a
leg and will be out for the rest of the season.
Meanwhile, the track- team finished its dual
season with a 95-59 loss to Cal in the Big Meet,
closing out with a 0-7 dual meet record.
And pole vaulter Casey Carrigan suffered a

muscle injury in his leg during warmup which kept
him put of competition against the Bears and
could keep him out of remaining track action.
Down south, the golf team split a pair, defeating
UCLA but losing to USC. After a fine start, the
tennis team slacked off and no Indians reached the
finals of the State Tennis Championships in
Portola Valley. Roscoe Tanner was upset by an
unseeded player on Friday but he and Rob
Rippner reached th' doubles semifinals.
Back on campus, the lacrosse team lost its first
league game in four years, to Palo Alto 5-4.
Gruesome details of the baseball and track
contests appear elsewhere on thr page while
details of the other events will be forthcoming
later in the week.
