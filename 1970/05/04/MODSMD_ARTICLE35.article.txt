# Mayday Strikes Twice
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
The month of May began on
such a deliciously merry note for
the Stanford nine that to have it
continue would probably have
been expecting too much.
And so it was.
On Friday, out at Sunken
Diamond, all was groovy.
Stanford sent its two aces, Phil
Keller and Steve Dunning, against
the visiting Oregon Ducks and
came away with a doubleheader
sweep. Keller won his seventh in
the first game and Dunning was
his customary invincible self in
the second. The Indians
triumphed 8-6 and 8-4.
But on Saturday, all was
gloomy. Oregon State's Beavers,
on the second day of their Bay
Area tour out of the soggy, firgid
northwest, brought a 2-3 record
onto the farm and left with a 4-3
mark. Two pitchers, Mike Keck
and Greg Lebeck, stiffled the
Cards to the tune of 5-1 and 3-1,
which was bad, but what
happened to freshman first
baseman Mike Nelson was worse.
Taking a throw from catcher
Bob Reece in the first inning of
the first game Saturday, Nelson
was drawn into the base line and
the path of runner Dave Wiggins.
The two collided and Nelson,
although hurt in the leg stayed in
the game.
"I thought it was a bruise," the
freshman said later, "I didn't even
fall over."
But in the second inning, when
he had to run out a grounder to
second, Nelson stumbled to the
dirt before he reached first.
Removed from the game and
taken to the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic, the big guy was informed
he had sustained a clean fracture
of the fibula, about four inches
over the ankle. Although not yet
in a cast, Nelson, team leader in

home runs and RBl's will be lost
for the season.
For the 200 or so escapists who
made it out to Sunken Diamond
on Friday, the games were a
delight. Stanford hit with
authority all afternoon and Coach
Ray Young's lineup juggling
looked great. The Indians came
from three behind with four in
the third, one in the fourth and
two in the sixth.
Rightfielder Tom Williams went
two for two with two RBl's and
Reece was two for three with a
pair of ribbies. It was Young's
100 th varsity win over less than
three years, and the gang
celebrated the event with a
between-games cake.
Unfed at the intermission,
Oregon ate it during the nightcap
against Dunning. Performing again
before a large gallery of scouts the
right hander had a perfect game
until the fifth, when he gave up
two walks. With Stanford ahead
7-0, he left the contest with eight

strikeouts so that he'd be available
for relief duty Saturday. The
eventual win pushed his record to
12-1. Bob Marshall gave up four
runs finishing up.
Jumping on a trio of pitching
Ducks, the Tribe pounded out 13
hits. Dave Edson and freshman
sub Pat Rusco, in his varsity
debut, had two hits. Rusco and
third baseman Dick Borchers each
drove in a pair. And Dunning
smashed a 4 20-ft. homer over the
center field fence in the third.
Saturday began with Nelson's
injury and went downhill from
there for the locals and 250 stiflec
fans. The Beavers, coming out of
19 days of Oregon rain and 30
degree heat, winning the opener
handily, 5-1. Stanford got but six
hits as Bob Kammeyer went five
ineffective innings for the loss.
And in the nightcap the Cards
fell to the fastballs and curves of
Lebeck. Bruce Schoen
relinquished three runs (two
earned) over the first seven.

he had to run out a grounder to
second, Nelson stumbled to the
dirt before he reached first.
Removed from the game and
taken to the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic, the big guy was informed
he had sustained a clean fracture
of the fibula, about four inches
over the ankle. Although not yet
in a cast, Nelson, team leader in

home runs and RBl's will be lost
for the season.
For the 200 or so escapists who
made it out to Sunken Diamond
on Friday, the games were a
delight. Stanford hit with
authority all afternoon and Coach
Ray Young's lineup juggling
looked great. The Indians came
from three behind with four in
the third, one in the fourth and
two in the sixth.
Rightfielder Tom Williams went
two for two with two RBl's and
Reece was two for three with a
pair of ribbies. It was Young's
100 th varsity win over less than
three years, and the gang
celebrated the event with a
between-games cake.
Unfed at the intermission,
Oregon ate it during the nightcap
against Dunning. Performing again
before a large gallery of scouts the
right hander had a perfect game
until the fifth, when he gave up
two walks. With Stanford ahead
7-0, he left the contest with eight

strikeouts so that he'd be available
for relief duty Saturday. The
eventual win pushed his record to
12-1. Bob Marshall gave up four
runs finishing up.
Jumping on a trio of pitching
Ducks, the Tribe pounded out 13
hits. Dave Edson and freshman
sub Pat Rusco, in his varsity
debut, had two hits. Rusco and
third baseman Dick Borchers each
drove in a pair. And Dunning
smashed a 4 20-ft. homer over the
center field fence in the third.
Saturday began with Nelson's
injury and went downhill from
there for the locals and 250 stiflec
fans. The Beavers, coming out of
19 days of Oregon rain and 30
degree heat, winning the opener
handily, 5-1. Stanford got but six
hits as Bob Kammeyer went five
ineffective innings for the loss.
And in the nightcap the Cards
fell to the fastballs and curves of
Lebeck. Bruce Schoen
relinquished three runs (two
earned) over the first seven.
The month of May began on
such a deliciously merry note for
the Stanford nine that to have it
continue would probably have
been expecting too much.
And so it was.
On Friday, out at Sunken
Diamond, all was groovy.
Stanford sent its two aces, Phil
Keller and Steve Dunning, against
the visiting Oregon Ducks and
came away with a doubleheader
sweep. Keller won his seventh in
the first game and Dunning was
his customary invincible self in
the second. The Indians
triumphed 8-6 and 8-4.
But on Saturday, all was
gloomy. Oregon State's Beavers,
on the second day of their Bay
Area tour out of the soggy, firgid
northwest, brought a 2-3 record
onto the farm and left with a 4-3
mark. Two pitchers, Mike Keck
and Greg Lebeck, stiffled the
Cards to the tune of 5-1 and 3-1,
which was bad, but what
happened to freshman first
baseman Mike Nelson was worse.
Taking a throw from catcher
Bob Reece in the first inning of
the first game Saturday, Nelson
was drawn into the base line and
the path of runner Dave Wiggins.
The two collided and Nelson,
although hurt in the leg stayed in
the game.
"I thought it was a bruise," the
freshman said later, "I didn't even
fall over."
But in the second inning, when
he had to run out a grounder to
second, Nelson stumbled to the
dirt before he reached first.
Removed from the game and
taken to the Palo Alto Medical
