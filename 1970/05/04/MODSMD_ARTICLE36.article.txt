# Wild Finishes Highlight Loss
## 
### FRED LEESON 
"Hey, where are you takin'
that?" joked one athlete as
assistant track coach Bill Boultrie
loaded the huge John Elliot
Memorial Trophy—which goes to
the winner of the Stanford-Cal
track meet—onto a team bus
Saturday morning.
To the surprise of no one, he
was taking it to Berkeley.
"As a team we had about what
we thought we would," head
coach Payton Jordon said after
the 95-59 Cal win that wrote finis
to his team's winless dual meet
season.
But though the meet was never
close, it was not short of
excitement.
Spectacular finishes in the mile
and 440 brought the suntoasted
crowd of 5,000-plus to its feet
and Stanford came through with
four lifetime bests, four season
bests and one meet record.
Photo Finish
The afternoon's tightest finish
was the 440, where the Indian's
Jim Kauffman and Ed Bonner and
Vince Ansley of Cal were all
clocked in 48.5. Bonner was
declared the winner with
Kauffman second, in a climax so
close that the officials Polaroid
snap at the tape really wasn't
much help.
Kauffman's time was .2 seconds
off his previous quickest this
season.
In the mile, Don Kardong and
Duncan Macdonald led for three
quarters before losing the lead to
Cal's Cliff West, who held off
those two in a desperate finish for
the win in 4:05.6. Macdonald was
a tenth of a second behind, and
Kardong was third in a life-best
time of 4.06. Brian Mittelstaedt's
fourth place 4:12.5 was also a life
best.
Kardong then doubled later in
the two mile, leading a Stanford
sweep there with a 9:00.4 ahead
of Greg Brock and Arvid Kretz
five and six seconds later. It was a
personal best for Kretz.
Bears Blaze
As expected, California's
blistering speedsters swept the
120 high hurdles, the 100 and the
220.
Stanford's Pete Fairchild and
Dave Whiteing placed first and
third in the 880 with marks of
1:52.3 and 1:53.4, both season
bests.
Randy White also reeled of a
season record of 52.3 in the 440
intermediate hurdles, but was
beaten in another of those
photo-finishes by Cal's Roddy Lee
who was clocked at the same
time.

Brook Thomas set a meet
record in the steeplechase in
9:12.4, but that was still ten
seconds off his time last week.
Chuck Menz was second at
9:31.8, and after the third lap or
so Thomas had the race to himself
and was never pushed.
Tom Anderson established a
new Stanford freshman record in
the long jump with a 24-1 OVi leap
good for second place; Alan
Meredith won the triple jump at
50 feet 9 and a quarter inches and
Scott Stillinger, Clint Ostrander
and Steve Flannery swept the pole
vault for the Cards, though a
muscle injury to Casey Carrigan
kept him from competing.
The Stanford JV demolished
the Cal JV, 105-36.
