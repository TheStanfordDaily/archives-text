# Reed Resigns

### 
ROGER REED has resigned as
president of the Young
Republicans. In a letter sent to
club members. Reed cited the
growing liberal orientation of the
group and past lack of
membership participation as the
main reasons for his resignation.
Reed referred specifically to
the incompatibility of his
libertarian- conservative
philosophy with the pro-Lindsay
and McCloskey sentiment within
the club. He stressed his distaste
lor the YR's refusal to associate
with the Free Campus Movement.
Reed called Republican efforts to
appeal to moderate students
"futile," and, praising the FCM
called it "a group actively working
for Freedom on this
campus" . . . com posed of
"people willing to risk bodily
harm . . . for what they believe."
During Reed's term as
president, the YRs began

publication of an expanded
version of the Stanford
Republican, and met with a large
number of Republican candidates,
notably Senator Murphy and
Attorney General primary
opponents Evelle Younger and
George Deukmejian. Reed was
dissatisfied however, with the
club's lack of impact on the
campus, and discouraged by the
growing debt incurred by the
Stanford Republican, and lack of
membership interest in
fund-raising.
The new president Don Ayer,
differs from Reed in personally
favoring an immediate American
withdrawal from Vietnam and in
having opposed both the
Haynsworth and Carswell
nominations. Ayer hopes to go to
Washington as part of the
Stanford delegation lobbying for
an end to American military
involvement in Cambodia.
