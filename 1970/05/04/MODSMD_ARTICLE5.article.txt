# 1200 At Rally Here, Plan Total Shutdown
## 
### 
A rally of 1200 Stanford
students voted overwhelmingly
yesterday afternoon at White
Plaza to join the growing national
college strike. The group endorsed
the demands formulated by Yale
U. and supported by 200 colleges:
1) U.S. withdrawal from
Southeast Asia, 2) justice in
America — free all political
prisoners, 3) Off-ROTC and end
Department of Defense research
on campus.
Two other demands were
added, addressed to Stanford,
asserting that the strike will be
non-violent and insisting that
university employees not be
forced to cross picket lines or
penalized for failing to cross the
lines.
President Pitzer yesterday
urged the Stanford community to
focus on the preservation of the

University in the coming days of
crisis.
"The university, above all must
remain a center for reasoned
discourse. Its influence in society
depends ultimately on the force
of its ideas, not its physical
power," he said.
No Pay
Those who voluntarily don't
work will not be paid, warned the
President. He continued that
strikers must avoid provoking
others. "This means at a
minimum, leaving lanes of access
to University buildings; permitting
those who wish to conduct or
attend classes to do so without
disruption; permitting staff to
reach their places of work and
conduct their business. Those who
are prevented from carrying out
their duties should, according to
Pitzer, identify obstructors as a
basis for judicial action.
The afternoon rally decided
that the first three demands
would be addressed to the nation
at large and not merely to the
university. The group stated that
it would decide later whether to
continue the strike until all of the
demands were met.
Strain Statement
After a lengthy open forum on
strike tactics, Selective Service
Advisor Alan Strain told the
crowd that by assuming that only
small numbers are committed to
the strike that they were
underestimating the Stanford
community. "Rather than shut
down the university we need to
open it up," he said.
Strikers were urged to disrupt
the Navy ROTC close order drill
scheduled for this morning.
A coordination committee for
the strike, meeting in Roble
Sunday night decided that each
strike group would choose its own
level of militancy. A meeting was
announced for Friday morning to
determine strike action in light of
the Academic Senate meeting
Thursday.
Twenty-one members of the
Dean of Students office signed a

statement favoring voluntary
suspension of classes and normal
business to free members of the
community to put their full
resources to bear on urgent
matters, both local and national.
The Dean of Students Office
also announced that it will
operate a coordination center for
all alternative activities during the
strike. All groups sponsoring such
activities are requested to contact
x 2733 so information can be
distributed to the community.
Many departments met
yesterday to discuss possible
strike action. Those deciding to
support the strike included
medical students, the law school,
and the departments of physics,
history, math, German, and
comparative literature. All
computer science classes are
cancelled except for CS 139 and
392 whose professors could not
be reached by the department last
night. The midterm in English 141
scheduled for Tuesday has been
postponed.
