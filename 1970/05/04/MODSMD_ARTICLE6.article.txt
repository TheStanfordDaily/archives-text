## Bombers Hit Cambodia 
### 
SAIGON (AP) - U.S. Air Force
bombers wiped out part of the
Cambodian rubber plantation
town of Mimot on Sunday after
Army helicopters were fired on by
North Vietnamese troops,
informed sources reported.
In another section of

Cambodia's Fishhook, troops of
the U.S. 11th Armored Cavalry
Regiment burned down at least
five villages, each with 30 to 40
houses. Officers said they were
told to burn the villages because
they could be of use to North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops.

The Americans met no resistance.
Villagers fled.
At the same time, a North
Vietnamese-Viet Cong force
seized a key river crossing from
Cambodian forces 37 miles
southeast of Pnom - Penh, the
nation's capital.
The allied task force of 8,000
American and 2,000 South
Vietnamese troops doubled its
area of operations in an attempt
to block an escape northward by
the 3,000-4,000 North
Vietnamese troops believed in the
region.
But the allied task force failed
in the third day of the Cambodian
offensive to find its major
objective, the top command post
for all Communist command
military and political activities in
South Vietnam.
