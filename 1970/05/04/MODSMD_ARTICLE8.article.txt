# Crisis Delegation Heads For Capitol
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
In an extraordinary move to
protest the American invasion of
Cambodia, and other pressing
national issues, Stanford
University is sending a delegation
of 20 faculty members and 13
students to Washington D.C.
The delegation to the Capitol is
an unprecedented action for an
American university.
The delegation, which leaves
tomorrow afternoon, was
authorized by the Faculty Senate
last Thursday to convey to the
federal government "the growing
sense of crisis that we all feel, and

try to elicit constructive responses
to our national emergency." The
resolution cited the Southeast
Asian War, racial tensions, and
urban decay as national issues that
are exacerbating campus crises.
Robert Moulton, Associate
Director of SLAC, is flying to the
Capitol today to make
arrangements for meetings on
Wednesday and Thursday in the
White House, the State
Department, and in a number of
Congressional committees and
policy groups. Faculty members
with personal contacts in
Washington are also assisting in
the arrangement of appointments.
Press Coverage
The delegation plans a national
press conference in Washington,
and has been promised coverage
by CBS TV, TIME Magazine, and
the Stanford DAILY.
Representative Don Edwards
(D-San Jose) has arranged a
breakfast Wednesday morning for
the Stanford delegation to meet
with all of California's
Congressmen and both Senators.
Edwards' office will serve as
headquarters for the Stanford
group, and Representative Allard
Lowenstein (D-N.Y.) has also
volunteered his services to assist
the delegation.
According to Prof. Sandford
Dornbusch, coordinator of the
delegation and sponsor of the
faculty resolution that established
it, instant results are not
expected. Because the work of the

delegation is expected to be a
"long term effort," John Gardner,
a Stanford Trustee and chairman
of the Urban Coaltion, has
volunteered to help organize an
inter-university task force to
encourage other universities to
follow Stanford's lead.
Pitzer Can't Go
Because of Faculty Seante
meeting on Thursday, and the
present situation on campus, the
delegation will not include the
President, the Provost, the Deans,
or members of the Academic
Senate. Prof. Dornbusch, the only
Senate member making the trip,
will attempt to rush back to
Stanford for the Faculty Senate
meeting this Thursday at 3:15.
The faculty members were
chosen by the Committee on
Committees of the Academic
Senate. Five of the students going
will be chosen by the ASSU
committee on nominations. The
old and new Councils of

Presidents will fill the other
eight-student positions.
To raise the $8,000 needed for
the 20 faculty members making
the trip William Clebsch,
Chairman of the Academic
Senate, is asking each faculty
member to contribute voluntarily.
Money, Money
The $4,000 needed to finance
the student delegates wilL be
raised from voluntary
contributions from students and
campus organizations. The
Vietnam Moratorium has voted to
contribute $200 to the students'
expenses, and is urging other
campus groups to do the same.
Students may contribute at the
table at White Plaza today.
After dinner in the dorms
tonight, members of the
delegation will meet with students
to discuss what the basic messages
should be that they bring back to
Washington. A general meeting of
all delegation members will follow
at 9:00 tonight.
Eleven of the 20 faculty
members on the delegation will be
in the dorms tonight. Council of
Presidents member Bob Grant will
be in Toyon. Faculty delegates are
