# Review Of Friday's Events
## Police Again Face Students At Encina 
### 
The following are brief
summaries of events that occurred
Friday and are explained in
greater detail in other stories in
the paper.
Council Meeting
By divided voice vote, the
Stanford Academic Council
requested its Senate to consider a
resolution condemning President
Nixon's action in Cambodia as
"unwise, immoral, and harmful."
In a second divided vote, the
council similarly asked its Senate
to consider "without delay
terminating academic credit for
ROTC at the end of the current
academic year."
Without dissent, it then asked
the Senate to consider a
resolution "condemning violence
wherever it occurs, whether on
campus or off, and dedicate itself
to seeking out and solving the
problems that trigger violence."

Pil/.er's Statemcnl
Warning that the University
faces "an extreme emergency,"
Stanford President Kenneth Pitzer
urged faculty and staff members
to develop procedures for

round-the-clock surveillance of
campus buildings "for passive
defense and fire protection."
Addressing the special meeting
of the Academic Council, Pitzer
said that even more drastic
measures, such as a total or partial
curfew, or closing of the campus
to unauthorized persons at all
times "must be considered and are
being studied." Pitzer urged the
faculty to cooperate with the
police, helping them as much as
possible. (See story on page 4)
Student Strike
The first day of a non-violent
student strike showed signs of
significant student support. Many
classes were cancelled, and, of
those that did meet, most
discussed the entry of American
troops into Cambodia and the
recent campus disturbances over
this and the ROTC issues.
Student pickets clustered in
front of Encina Hall, the Medical
School, physics tank, Durand
aerospace building, and
Engineering corner. Scuffling
between demonstrators and
engineering students was reported
when some groups tried to

obstruct entry to the main
Engineering building. [See story
on pa*ge 4.)
Encina Confrontation
Two students were arrested as
they allegedly blocked entrance to
employees into Encina Hall.
Captain Rosa and Sergeant Don
Tamm of the Santa Clara Sheriff's
Department later called the arrests
"an error ... a sit-in is legal as
long as it doesn't violate other
people's rights."
After threatening to similarly
arrest other demonstrators, Tamm
and Rosa called for
re-enforcements, as the two
arrests precipitated considerable
student agitation. Forty Santa
Clara deputies then staged an
ineffectual dispersal of 400
demonstrators across Encina lawn.
While 250 demonstrators
tightly packed Encina's steps, the
deputies, slowly pursued by the
400, retreated back across the
lawn, backed down Serra Street,
reboarded their bus, and left. (See
story on page 4.|
Nigh t March
Approximately 200 Off-ROTC
demonstrators marched to Palo
Alto Friday night to attend a

street dance at Lytton Plaza.
Though turned back by a line of
Palo Alto police at the El Camino
overpass, most eventually reached
the dance. One arrest was made
there, 'as at least 100
flak-jacketed, trouble-ready police
patrolled the area. They were
assisted by a searchlight from City
Hall and a helicopter.
Later that evening, after a
meeting outside Branner Hall,
about 100 demonstrators marched
on Encina, but were prevented
from breaking more than a few
windows by 30 policemen. I See
story on page 4.|
Shotgun Blasts
Three shotgun blasts ripped
into the Los Altos home of
Stanford's Army ROTC
commander. Col. Stanley Ramey,
at 11 :50 p.m. Friday. No one was
injured.
Ramey said his son, Rufus, 14,
was sitting in the living room
when the pellets smashed through
the picture window. The "B-B"
size shot also struck the garage
door and the front entrance of the
house, passing through the door
and hitting the wall 20 feet away.

Though turned back by a line of
Palo Alto police at the El Camino
overpass, most eventually reached
the dance. One arrest was made
there, 'as at least 100
flak-jacketed, trouble-ready police
patrolled the area. They were
assisted by a searchlight from City
Hall and a helicopter.
Later that evening, after a
meeting outside Branner Hall,
about 100 demonstrators marched
on Encina, but were prevented
from breaking more than a few
windows by 30 policemen. I See
story on page 4.|
Shotgun Blasts
Three shotgun blasts ripped
into the Los Altos home of
Stanford's Army ROTC
commander. Col. Stanley Ramey,
at 11 :50 p.m. Friday. No one was
injured.
Ramey said his son, Rufus, 14,
was sitting in the living room
when the pellets smashed through
the picture window. The "B-B"
size shot also struck the garage
door and the front entrance of the
house, passing through the door
and hitting the wall 20 feet away.

The following are brief
summaries of events that occurred
Friday and are explained in
greater detail in other stories in
the paper.
Council Meeting
By divided voice vote, the
Stanford Academic Council
requested its Senate to consider a
resolution condemning President
Nixon's action in Cambodia as
"unwise, immoral, and harmful."
In a second divided vote, the
council similarly asked its Senate
to consider "without delay
terminating academic credit for
ROTC at the end of the current
academic year."
Without dissent, it then asked
the Senate to consider a
resolution "condemning violence
wherever it occurs, whether on
campus or off, and dedicate itself
to seeking out and solving the
problems that trigger violence."

Pil/.er's Statemcnl
Warning that the University
faces "an extreme emergency,"
Stanford President Kenneth Pitzer
urged faculty and staff members
to develop procedures for

round-the-clock surveillance of
campus buildings "for passive
defense and fire protection."
Addressing the special meeting
of the Academic Council, Pitzer
said that even more drastic
measures, such as a total or partial
curfew, or closing of the campus
to unauthorized persons at all
times "must be considered and are
being studied." Pitzer urged the
faculty to cooperate with the
police, helping them as much as
possible. (See story on page 4)
Student Strike
The first day of a non-violent
student strike showed signs of
significant student support. Many
classes were cancelled, and, of
those that did meet, most
discussed the entry of American
troops into Cambodia and the
recent campus disturbances over
this and the ROTC issues.
Student pickets clustered in
front of Encina Hall, the Medical
School, physics tank, Durand
aerospace building, and
Engineering corner. Scuffling
between demonstrators and
engineering students was reported
when some groups tried to

obstruct entry to the main
Engineering building. [See story
on pa*ge 4.)
Encina Confrontation
Two students were arrested as
they allegedly blocked entrance to
employees into Encina Hall.
Captain Rosa and Sergeant Don
Tamm of the Santa Clara Sheriff's
Department later called the arrests
"an error ... a sit-in is legal as
long as it doesn't violate other
people's rights."
After threatening to similarly
arrest other demonstrators, Tamm
and Rosa called for
re-enforcements, as the two
arrests precipitated considerable
student agitation. Forty Santa
Clara deputies then staged an
ineffectual dispersal of 400
demonstrators across Encina lawn.
While 250 demonstrators
tightly packed Encina's steps, the
deputies, slowly pursued by the
400, retreated back across the
lawn, backed down Serra Street,
reboarded their bus, and left. (See
story on page 4.|
Nigh t March
Approximately 200 Off-ROTC
demonstrators marched to Palo
Alto Friday night to attend a

street dance at Lytton Plaza.
