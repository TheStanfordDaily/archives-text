Today
We hear that John Lindsay
(you rememberâ€”the chap
who spoke hear on April 2
opposing violence) is
mourning today, for it was
344 years ago that a crazy
Dutchman bought Manhatten
from some Indians. A soon
to be published book claims
that the Indians weren't
really paid in trinkets and
beads but in grass. Think of
what they've been hiding
from us all these years.
Our news office will gladly
accept reports of any
Stanford Indians who are
selling out at 321-2300
x4f>32. Bead freaks can
advertise their wares through
our parsimonious business
office at 327-4150.
