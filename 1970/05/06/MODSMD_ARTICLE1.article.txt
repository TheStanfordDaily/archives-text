# Anti-Cambodia Protests Sweep Across Nation
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
Following the wake of the
deaths of four students at Kent
State, the national academic
strike against Cambodia continued
to mushroom yesterday.
According to a national
information center at Brandeis
University, over 160 schools were
heavily hit by students strikes,
ranging from total shutdown to
mass walkouts.
A West Coast information
center, covering Oregon,
Washington, and California has
been set at Stanford to aid the
Brandeis center. Other regional
networks have also been formed.
High school and even junior
high school students are planning
to join the strike on the Peninsula
today. Students from Palo Alto,
Cubberly, and Gunn high schools
last night formed a strike
committee, and students at
Terman Junior High School have
called for a strike.
Ohio Aftermath
In Ohio, the strike and its
aftermath have already
completely closed Kent State
University completely. National
Guard reports blaming sniper fire
for the four deaths Monday have
been withdrawn by Adj. Gen. S.T.
Del Corso, of the Guard. He said
that Guardsmen felt their lives to
be in danger, and shot.
John Kifner, a reporter for the
New York Times, said in a story
yesterday, "thus reporter, who was
with a group of students, did not
see any indication of sniper fire,
nor was the sound of any gunfire
audible before the Guard volley."
The Ohio Highway Patrol has
denied Guard reports that its
helicopter crew spotted a gunman
before the incident.
Nonviolence
The â€¢ tone of the strike was
nonviolent yesterday, although
police clashed with demonstrators
on a number of campuses,
including the University of
California at Berkeley and at
Davis, (see related story, this

Fires were started in ROTC
buildings at Washington
University, Northwestern,
University of Idaho, University of
Tennessee, University of Houston,
Boston University, and the U.C.

Maryland, where classes have been
suspended, and was called into the
University of Wisconsin following
a night of sporadic vandalism.
