# Anti-Cambodia Protests Sweep Across Nation
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
Following the wake of the
deaths of four students at Kent
State, the national academic
strike against Cambodia continued
to mushroom yesterday.
According to a national
information center at Brandeis
University, over 160 schools were
heavily hit by students strikes,
ranging from total shutdown to
mass walkouts.
A West Coast information
center, covering Oregon,
Washington, and California has
been set at Stanford to aid the
Brandeis center. Other regional
networks have also been formed.
High school and even junior
high school students are planning
to join the strike on the Peninsula
today. Students from Palo Alto,
Cubberly, and Gunn high schools
last night formed a strike
committee, and students at
Terman Junior High School have
called for a strike.
Ohio Aftermath
In Ohio, the strike and its
aftermath have already
completely closed Kent State
University completely. National
Guard reports blaming sniper fire
for the four deaths Monday have
been withdrawn by Adj. Gen. S.T.
Del Corso, of the Guard. He said
that Guardsmen felt their lives to
be in danger, and shot.
John Kifner, a reporter for the
New York Times, said in a story
yesterday, "thus reporter, who was
with a group of students, did not
see any indication of sniper fire,
nor was the sound of any gunfire
audible before the Guard volley."
The Ohio Highway Patrol has
denied Guard reports that its
helicopter crew spotted a gunman
before the incident.
Nonviolence
The • tone of the strike was
nonviolent yesterday, although
police clashed with demonstrators
on a number of campuses,
including the University of
California at Berkeley and at
Davis, (see related story, this
page)
Fires were started in ROTC
buildings at Washington
University, Northwestern,
University of Idaho, University of
Tennessee, University of Houston,
Boston University, and the U.C.
(Davis) campus.
The National Guard remained
on duty at the University of

Maryland, where classes have been
suspended, and was called into the
University of Wisconsin following
a night of sporadic vandalism.
East Coast Closing
Colleges on the East Coast are
the most heavily hit, with a large
number of the nation's most
prestigious universities closed
until September.
In the Boston area, Harvard,
Tufts, Boston College and Boston
University are completely closed.
The Wellesely faculty will vote
today on the matter of academic

Eastern campuses which have

The mammoth New York
University and City University of
New York systems are closing
their campuses, amidst fire
bombings that have destroyed or
damaged buildings in Albany,
Stonybrook, Buffalo, and
elsewhere. Rockland
Community College,
and Buffalo State students are to
join with the SUNY and CUNY
students in closing the New York
State Throughway for 20 minutes
this morning.
Following a vote to close until

Poughkeepsie area schools plan to
rally Friday. Nearby, at New Platz
State, 60% of the students have
struck.
