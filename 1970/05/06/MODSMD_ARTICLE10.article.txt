# Questions & Answers
## Defense Dept. Research 
### Judy Strasser Michael Sweeney 
Why does the Strike demand that Defense
Department research end?
The Strike insists that U.S. aggression against
Southeast Asia must halt. We demand that ROTC
disband on the Stanford campus because it is one
way in which Stanford contributes to the war.
Department of Defense (DOD) sponsored research
subordinates Stanford to the military even more
seriously than ROTC. Total contracts and grants
from DOD are $15 million a year. Some of the
research has direct military applications, and some
of it is basic research that DOD thinks it can use in
the future. After July 1, the "Mansfield
Amendment" requires that all DOD research on
campus be for applied military purposes.

Is the "Mansfield Amendment" for real?
Yes. Senator Mansfield pushed it through
Congress because he believes the same thing we
do—that universities should not be kept on a string
by the Pentagon. Mansfield wants legitimate basic
research to be sponsored by other agencies, like
the National Science Foundation. The Pentagon,
however, is lobbying hard for a repeal of the
Mansfield Amendment. Stanford's action to end
DOD funding will give a big boost to the efforts to
preserve this important reform.
* ♦ *
If Stanford stops taking DOD money, won't it
just move somewhere else?
Certainly DOD will try to move some military
work elsewhere. The April 3rd Movement forced
the University to stop classified war contracts,
only to find one electronic war project move to
Stanford Research Institute (SRI), which was then
severed from the University. We must renew our
fight against the war research done at SRI, the
Industrial Park, and in the corporations controlled
by Stanford trustees. But first we have to clean
our own house.
The really basic scientific research now
supported by DOD need not leave Stanford, of
course. It can seek funding from non-military
agencies. This is the intent of the Mansfield
Amendment.
* * *
How can people on DOD grants find new
funding?
Applied research for the Defense Department
must be stopped, not refunded. Universities,
scientists and citizens all over the country must
join in the effort to wrest the control of
government research funds away from the
generals, an«J to find new private sources of
support.

Can the University survive the crisis of
transition?
The Strike holds that the University must shut
down completely until we save ourselves from a
much greater crisis—the berserk militarism of
Nixon, Packard and their cronies. Clearly, the
University cannot emerge from the Strike except
as a radically different institution. Stanford must
set itself in opposition rather than subordination,
to the power elite that runs America. Stanford can
survive this crisis only if it comes to realize that
the University derives its strength from the people
in its campus community, and not from outside
infusions of cold cash. Not only does the

University need to find new ways to earn its
livelihood, but it must also become a community
of equals who will discover their full creative
energies.
* * *
Is objectionable research sponsored by other
agencies besides DOD?
Yes. When we have won the fight against DOD
research, we must begin to define more clearly
what research is actually harmful to the mass of
people in the world. For example, in the 1970'5,
much social science research was directly relevant
to the suppression of insurgent movements.
The review process has already begun. During
the April 3rd Movement, the Research Guidelines
committee proposed preliminary rules by which
the community might judge research projects at
Stanford. The group emphasized the importance
of community review of research at Stanford. This
review should extend to existing contracts with
supposedly "benign" sources like HEW, NIH and
the Ford Foundation.
* * *
Realistically, what effect would an end to
Stanford's DOD research have on national policy?
The shock waves of Stanford's action will reach
every university in the country. No other
university is so closely connected with the
military-industrial complex as Stanford, in terms
of research volume, trustees and industrial clients
and tenants. For Stanford to stop DOD research is
like West Point stopping officer training. The
impact will reach MIT, Johns Hopkins, Cal Tech
and other big research centers. We have learned the
sad truth that Nixon & Co. are deaf to protest
marches, letters and special delegations. They will
respond only to the physical defection of the
universities from their war machine.

Why are you radicals always trying to impose
your own beliefs on other people?
All of us are prisoners of a centralized society
that controls our lives. Much of the control is
indirect, and justified in the sacred name of
"individual freedom." The Defense Department,
for instance, has exercised a harmful control over
Stanford University for years because it has been
the most convenient source of funds for research.
The struggle against the injustice of this society
isn't just a conscientious appeal to individual
people. That's a white upper class myth which
pervades Stanford. The people of the U.S. are
tightly controlled by institutions—corporations,
government, and the military—which are armed
with the coercive power to deny economic
subsistence or imprison a dissenter. These
oppressive institutions include the universities to
the extent that they lend support to the activities
of the military and big business. Change won't
come unless the institutions are attacked. If
individual people choose to side with the
institutions in this struggle, then they probably
will feel that radicals are attacking them as
well—or, "imposing their beliefs on other people."
This is an unfortunate cost to any radical
movement. The strongest message of the Strike
must be, "Join Us!"
