# Both Sides Now
## How To Quit ROTC 
### Known Unsoldier 
I suppose some of you third-year Army ROTC
cadets remember your instructor's comments on
my "Unknown Soldier" columns which attacked
the ROTC's punitive clause and the DMS
branch-choice coercion apparatus.
Your instructor, whose name I will not mention
here, stated, "The cadet who wrote that article,
well, we don't want that type of person
commissioned as a lieutenant in the Army." At
least 33 of you, my former fellow cadets, heard
that statement to the effect that there is no room
for dissent in the Army, be it among officers and
enlisted men alike.
I was released from third-year Army ROTC at
my own request, and the infamous punitive clause,
which hangs over all your heads, was not invoked.
When the 33 of you heard your instructor mention
openly to the class that the punitive clause would
not be invoked on the "Unknown Soldier," but
warned against 33 of you suddenly confessing to
having written "From the Inside," you must have
been outraged to see a fellow cadet set free while
you are all held in ROTC by the punitive clause.
Army Regulation 145-1, Sec. 4, "Disenrollment
and Discharge" states that a contract ROTC cadet
may be removed from the program by the
Professor of Military Science (PMS) for medical
reasons, conscientous objection (CO certification
is determined by the impartial Army, not by your
draft board), extreme hardship, indifference to
training, loss of qualifications for becoming an
effective Army officer (my official reason), and
finally, willful evasion of the terms of your
enlistment contract. When a cadet's membership in
ROTC is open to question, a three-man board of
officers is hand-picked by the PMS to decide the
case. This board may come to three findings:
1. The cadet shall remain in the program
2. The cadet shall be disenrolled from the
program
3. The cadet shall be disenrolled from the
program and may or may not, as decided by Army
ROTC main headquarters in Washington, be
ordered to two (four for scholarship students)
years of active duty as a private in the Army for
reasons interpreted as willful violations of the
contract terms.
Dissent Highly Detrimental
Dissent within the Army, especially at junior
officer levels of command is highly detrimental to
its structure. It was for this reason that after
having confessed lo writing the unsigned cadet's
articles and having requested disenrollment from

ROTC, that I was released so quickly and easily
from it. Once junior officers or officer candidates
openly criticize their "superiors" or attack some
of the military's oppressive features (such as I
attempted to do by exposing the way cadets are
coerced under threat of death in the Infantry if
they do not conform) they can no longer be useful
as officers.
The Army's conduct in Southeast Asia is so
morally unjustifiable that any platoon leader who,
in the Army's estimation, would consider
presenting any dissident view to men under his
command is immediately removed from a
leadership position. In addition it might also be
said that with the campus atmosphere as it is, the
last thing the Army ROTC wants to do now is to
invoke the punitive clause on anyone for fear of
publicly resulting in repercussions of the largest
magnitude.
A third-year scholarship cadet who in three
years received $8000 of financial support from the
Army was recently released from the program and
the punitive clause was not invoked. Had it been
invoked, had this cadet been placed on active
duty, and this action publicized, ROTC's future on
this campus would be so much more in jeopardy
than it is at this moment. To any cadet, on ROTC
scholarship or not, who wants to quit for any
reason whatsoever, now is the time when
Stanford's ROTC is virtually powerless to prevent
you from doing so.
How many of you ROTC cadets condone your
Commander-in-Chief's policy of continued
expansionist intervention in Southeast Asia? And
how many of you will become platoon leaders and
will be intimidated to the extent of being unable
to speak out on the immorality of the policies you
will be carrying out in a few years? Even now,
with the threat of combat branches hovering over
you if you do not become red-hot sycophantic
Distinguished Military Students, you may now be
discouraged and intimidated from speaking out
against imperialistic foreign policies, against
ROTC, as I was when I was still in the program. If
you are strongly opposed to what our armed
forces are doing around thyworld, as I think most
of you are, then there is no place for you in the
Army as a lieutenant.
And if you are also opposed to ROTC's system
of rewards and punishment that keeps you from
speaking out against anything too controversial,
then I know you will feel much better, as I do
now, when you tell ROTC to get fucked.

invoked, had this cadet been placed on active
duty, and this action publicized, ROTC's future on
this campus would be so much more in jeopardy
than it is at this moment. To any cadet, on ROTC
scholarship or not, who wants to quit for any
reason whatsoever, now is the time when
Stanford's ROTC is virtually powerless to prevent
you from doing so.
How many of you ROTC cadets condone your
Commander-in-Chief's policy of continued
expansionist intervention in Southeast Asia? And
how many of you will become platoon leaders and
will be intimidated to the extent of being unable
to speak out on the immorality of the policies you
will be carrying out in a few years? Even now,
with the threat of combat branches hovering over
you if you do not become red-hot sycophantic
Distinguished Military Students, you may now be
discouraged and intimidated from speaking out
against imperialistic foreign policies, against
ROTC, as I was when I was still in the program. If
you are strongly opposed to what our armed
forces are doing around thyworld, as I think most
of you are, then there is no place for you in the
Army as a lieutenant.
And if you are also opposed to ROTC's system
of rewards and punishment that keeps you from
speaking out against anything too controversial,
then I know you will feel much better, as I do
now, when you tell ROTC to get fucked.

I suppose some of you third-year Army ROTC
cadets remember your instructor's comments on
my "Unknown Soldier" columns which attacked
the ROTC's punitive clause and the DMS
branch-choice coercion apparatus.
Your instructor, whose name I will not mention
here, stated, "The cadet who wrote that article,
well, we don't want that type of person
commissioned as a lieutenant in the Army." At
least 33 of you, my former fellow cadets, heard
that statement to the effect that there is no room
for dissent in the Army, be it among officers and
enlisted men alike.
I was released from third-year Army ROTC at
my own request, and the infamous punitive clause,
which hangs over all your heads, was not invoked.
When the 33 of you heard your instructor mention
openly to the class that the punitive clause would
not be invoked on the "Unknown Soldier," but
warned against 33 of you suddenly confessing to
having written "From the Inside," you must have
been outraged to see a fellow cadet set free while
you are all held in ROTC by the punitive clause.
Army Regulation 145-1, Sec. 4, "Disenrollment
and Discharge" states that a contract ROTC cadet
may be removed from the program by the
Professor of Military Science (PMS) for medical
reasons, conscientous objection (CO certification
is determined by the impartial Army, not by your
draft board), extreme hardship, indifference to
training, loss of qualifications for becoming an
effective Army officer (my official reason), and
finally, willful evasion of the terms of your
enlistment contract. When a cadet's membership in
ROTC is open to question, a three-man board of
officers is hand-picked by the PMS to decide the
case. This board may come to three findings:
1. The cadet shall remain in the program
2. The cadet shall be disenrolled from the
program
3. The cadet shall be disenrolled from the
program and may or may not, as decided by Army
ROTC main headquarters in Washington, be
ordered to two (four for scholarship students)
years of active duty as a private in the Army for
reasons interpreted as willful violations of the
contract terms.
Dissent Highly Detrimental
Dissent within the Army, especially at junior
officer levels of command is highly detrimental to
its structure. It was for this reason that after
having confessed lo writing the unsigned cadet's
articles and having requested disenrollment from

ROTC, that I was released so quickly and easily
from it. Once junior officers or officer candidates
openly criticize their "superiors" or attack some
of the military's oppressive features (such as I
attempted to do by exposing the way cadets are
coerced under threat of death in the Infantry if
they do not conform) they can no longer be useful
as officers.
The Army's conduct in Southeast Asia is so
morally unjustifiable that any platoon leader who,
in the Army's estimation, would consider
presenting any dissident view to men under his
command is immediately removed from a
leadership position. In addition it might also be
said that with the campus atmosphere as it is, the
last thing the Army ROTC wants to do now is to
invoke the punitive clause on anyone for fear of
publicly resulting in repercussions of the largest
magnitude.
A third-year scholarship cadet who in three
years received $8000 of financial support from the
Army was recently released from the program and
the punitive clause was not invoked. Had it been
invoked, had this cadet been placed on active
duty, and this action publicized, ROTC's future on
this campus would be so much more in jeopardy
