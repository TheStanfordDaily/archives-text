# One Man's Fantasy
## Blow Up Washington 
### Nick Selby 
They had shared the faint hope,
as they watched the bloodred
sickle moon slicing through the
clouds, that somehow they might
find their way free of the
barbarous wilderness which had
settled around them.
Yet, sitting in bed, smoking
slowly in the darkness, he found
that even the warmth of her arm
thrown across his back could not
relieve the chill which had frosted
the windowpanes beside the quilt.
Even the hootowls outside had
ceased their murmurings in their
dread of this übiquitous cold. The
flowers lay wilted, the once green
blades of grass seemed brown and
lifeless. Not one molecule in the
universe comprehended Richard
Nixon.
At another time, on another
evening, the mere touch of her
fingers to the hair across his neck
and shoulders would have meant
she wanted to make love, would
have forced him to stop whatever
he was doing. Tonight, however,
he studied only the glow of the
cigarette resting in his knuckles.
He sat motionless, silent,
unwilling even to think about
closeness or tenderness. What was
the use?
He brushed the ashes into his
palm and luxuriated in the dull,
searing pain of blistering flesh as
the ashes dimmed and burned
themselves out. The pain kept his
mind from wandering back to the
awful outrage and despair he had
felt during the day. Years before,
he had forced the chipped paint
splinters beneath his fingernails,
had pressed his hands into the old
steam radiators in the same
mindless fashion, to take his mind
off his mother's brutal
punishment "lectures."
Screaming At Televisions
How could he explain, what
words did he know to express the
anger inside him? Four people lay
in their own blood, gunned down
by a row of National Guardsmen,
and the president spoke
threateningly about "dissent
inviting tragedy."
Earlier, he had been screaming,
foaming at the mouth, when he
heard the president's comment on
television. His apoplexy continued
through the newscast —he was
yelling "Fascists! Pigs!
Motherfuckers!" at the television
set, hoping somehow the maniacs
in the White House might hear his
anger. But he knew they would
not. What could he do?
At least twenty children and
civilians had been killed in North
Vietnam in the latest atrocity, the
renewed bombing. The president
echoed strange words about
"bombing them to the negotiation
table" and ho shuddered in sheer
disbelief. "That bastard, that
goddamn bastard liar!" he
screamed.
Blowing Up the White House
"What are you muttering
about?" she asked him. He was
reliving his rage in bed, two days
after the initial outburst, still
angry enough to destroy the
White House if . . . if . . . What
was he waiting for, he asked
himself, why didn't he buy some
dynamite and blow the bastards

off the face of the earth? "I'm
going to blowup Washington,"he
answered, "Go to sleep."
"You're what?" He shook his
head and rolled over to face her.
"I'm going to blow Washington,
Richard Nixon, David Packard,
Laird, Westmoreland, Mitchell,
every last one of them, off the
surface of the globe. It may not
solve the problem, but at least I'll
be doing something. Now, go to
sleep, I'm planning my attack."
The next morning, he sat
half-freezing to death on the cold
stone steps of Encina Hall,
watching the Food Affinity
Group set up tables for coffee and
doughnuts. "When are you going
to blow up Washington, sweetie?"
she asked him.
She doubted whether he had
heard. "Come on, you damn
revolutionary, when are you going
to attack?" He didn't answer
directly.
The First Laughter
"Years ago, my brother and I
went camping on cold mornings
like this," he mused. "We swam
naked in the mountain streams
just before the sun appeared over
the snow-covered peaks; we
rushed into the ice melt to prove

outselves unafraid of the cold,
then shivered over a fire to dry off
before cooking some oatmeal for
breakfast. And I don't suppose I
would object if one of those girls
brought me some oatmeal now."
The employees came and
watched the people sitting in the
boarded doorways. Did they feel
the same rage about Nixon that
they felt toward the students
blocking their entrance? He could
not be sure. Some refused to talk,
even to accept coffee. "How lonj,
will Pitzer put up with this?" he
asked her, "and how about the
Chinese? How can we stop a
holocaust? "
"By blowing up the White
House," they answered together.
It was the first laugh, the first
miraculous laugh, of the last five
days.
Now it was all over. What had
seemed so natural, the years of
achievement in school, the
cotillion dances and the debutante
dinners, the gay waltzes to the
p-ching! of cash registers,
overflowing with bills and coins,
all of the old comforts were gone.
But they felt no loss! They knew
genuine laughter.

he was doing. Tonight, however,
he studied only the glow of the
cigarette resting in his knuckles.
He sat motionless, silent,
unwilling even to think about
closeness or tenderness. What was
the use?
He brushed the ashes into his
palm and luxuriated in the dull,
searing pain of blistering flesh as
the ashes dimmed and burned
themselves out. The pain kept his
mind from wandering back to the
awful outrage and despair he had
felt during the day. Years before,
he had forced the chipped paint
splinters beneath his fingernails,
had pressed his hands into the old
steam radiators in the same
mindless fashion, to take his mind
off his mother's brutal
punishment "lectures."
Screaming At Televisions
How could he explain, what
words did he know to express the
anger inside him? Four people lay
in their own blood, gunned down
by a row of National Guardsmen,
and the president spoke
threateningly about "dissent
inviting tragedy."
Earlier, he had been screaming,
foaming at the mouth, when he
heard the president's comment on
television. His apoplexy continued
through the newscast —he was
yelling "Fascists! Pigs!
Motherfuckers!" at the television
set, hoping somehow the maniacs
in the White House might hear his
anger. But he knew they would
not. What could he do?
At least twenty children and
civilians had been killed in North
Vietnam in the latest atrocity, the
renewed bombing. The president
echoed strange words about
"bombing them to the negotiation
table" and ho shuddered in sheer
disbelief. "That bastard, that
goddamn bastard liar!" he
screamed.
Blowing Up the White House
"What are you muttering
about?" she asked him. He was
reliving his rage in bed, two days
after the initial outburst, still
angry enough to destroy the
White House if . . . if . . . What
was he waiting for, he asked
himself, why didn't he buy some
dynamite and blow the bastards

off the face of the earth? "I'm
going to blowup Washington,"he
answered, "Go to sleep."
"You're what?" He shook his
head and rolled over to face her.
"I'm going to blow Washington,
Richard Nixon, David Packard,
Laird, Westmoreland, Mitchell,
every last one of them, off the
surface of the globe. It may not
solve the problem, but at least I'll
be doing something. Now, go to
sleep, I'm planning my attack."
The next morning, he sat
half-freezing to death on the cold
stone steps of Encina Hall,
watching the Food Affinity
Group set up tables for coffee and
doughnuts. "When are you going
to blow up Washington, sweetie?"
she asked him.
She doubted whether he had
heard. "Come on, you damn
revolutionary, when are you going
to attack?" He didn't answer
directly.
The First Laughter
"Years ago, my brother and I
went camping on cold mornings
like this," he mused. "We swam
naked in the mountain streams
just before the sun appeared over
the snow-covered peaks; we
rushed into the ice melt to prove

outselves unafraid of the cold,
then shivered over a fire to dry off
before cooking some oatmeal for
breakfast. And I don't suppose I
would object if one of those girls
brought me some oatmeal now."
The employees came and
watched the people sitting in the
boarded doorways. Did they feel
the same rage about Nixon that
they felt toward the students
blocking their entrance? He could
not be sure. Some refused to talk,
even to accept coffee. "How lonj,
will Pitzer put up with this?" he
asked her, "and how about the
Chinese? How can we stop a
holocaust? "
"By blowing up the White
House," they answered together.
It was the first laugh, the first
miraculous laugh, of the last five
days.
Now it was all over. What had
seemed so natural, the years of
achievement in school, the
cotillion dances and the debutante
dinners, the gay waltzes to the
p-ching! of cash registers,
overflowing with bills and coins,
all of the old comforts were gone.
But they felt no loss! They knew
genuine laughter.
They had shared the faint hope,
as they watched the bloodred
sickle moon slicing through the
clouds, that somehow they might
find their way free of the
barbarous wilderness which had
settled around them.
Yet, sitting in bed, smoking
slowly in the darkness, he found
that even the warmth of her arm
thrown across his back could not
relieve the chill which had frosted
the windowpanes beside the quilt.
Even the hootowls outside had
ceased their murmurings in their
dread of this übiquitous cold. The
flowers lay wilted, the once green
blades of grass seemed brown and
lifeless. Not one molecule in the
universe comprehended Richard
Nixon.
At another time, on another
evening, the mere touch of her
fingers to the hair across his neck
and shoulders would have meant
she wanted to make love, would
have forced him to stop whatever
he was doing. Tonight, however,
he studied only the glow of the
cigarette resting in his knuckles.

by a row of National Guardsmen,
and the president spoke
threateningly about "dissent
inviting tragedy."
Earlier, he had been screaming,
foaming at the mouth, when he
heard the president's comment on
television. His apoplexy continued
through the newscast —he was
yelling "Fascists! Pigs!
Motherfuckers!" at the television
set, hoping somehow the maniacs
in the White House might hear his
anger. But he knew they would
not. What could he do?
At least twenty children and
civilians had been killed in North
Vietnam in the latest atrocity, the
renewed bombing. The president
echoed strange words about
"bombing them to the negotiation
table" and ho shuddered in sheer
disbelief. "That bastard, that
goddamn bastard liar!" he
screamed.
Blowing Up the White House
"What are you muttering
about?" she asked him. He was
reliving his rage in bed, two days
after the initial outburst, still
angry enough to destroy the
White House if . . . if . . . What
was he waiting for, he asked
himself, why didn't he buy some
dynamite and blow the bastards

off the face of the earth? "I'm
going to blowup Washington,"he
answered, "Go to sleep."
"You're what?" He shook his
head and rolled over to face her.
"I'm going to blow Washington,
Richard Nixon, David Packard,
Laird, Westmoreland, Mitchell,
every last one of them, off the
surface of the globe. It may not
solve the problem, but at least I'll
be doing something. Now, go to
sleep, I'm planning my attack."
The next morning, he sat
half-freezing to death on the cold
stone steps of Encina Hall,
watching the Food Affinity
Group set up tables for coffee and
doughnuts. "When are you going
to blow up Washington, sweetie?"
she asked him.
She doubted whether he had
heard. "Come on, you damn
revolutionary, when are you going
to attack?" He didn't answer
directly.
The First Laughter
"Years ago, my brother and I
went camping on cold mornings
like this," he mused. "We swam
naked in the mountain streams
just before the sun appeared over
the snow-covered peaks; we
rushed into the ice melt to prove

outselves unafraid of the cold,
then shivered over a fire to dry off
before cooking some oatmeal for
breakfast. And I don't suppose I
would object if one of those girls
brought me some oatmeal now."
The employees came and
watched the people sitting in the
boarded doorways. Did they feel
the same rage about Nixon that
they felt toward the students
blocking their entrance? He could
not be sure. Some refused to talk,
even to accept coffee. "How lonj,
will Pitzer put up with this?" he
asked her, "and how about the
Chinese? How can we stop a
holocaust? "
"By blowing up the White
House," they answered together.
It was the first laugh, the first
miraculous laugh, of the last five
days.
Now it was all over. What had
seemed so natural, the years of
achievement in school, the
cotillion dances and the debutante
dinners, the gay waltzes to the
p-ching! of cash registers,
overflowing with bills and coins,
all of the old comforts were gone.
But they felt no loss! They knew
genuine laughter.
