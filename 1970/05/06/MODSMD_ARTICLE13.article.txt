# Psychiatry Dept. For Non-Violence
## 
### 
The Stanford community is in a
period of crisis. Members of the
community are attempting to
solve our problems non-violently.
The members of the academic
faculty of the Department »of
Psychiatry recognize and deeply
respect the widespread
commitment to non-violent at
Stanford. However, tragic
experiences, especially on other
campuses, remind us all how
difficult it can be to persist in a
non-violent approach.
We therefore endorse the
following recommendations of
this department's Committee on
Violence as guidelines for
effective nonviolent action for
constructive change:
1. Make your nonviolent position
clear. Wear a white arm band
or handkerchief signifying
constructive action and
restraint even in the face of
provocation.
2. Rely on persuasion rather than
physical coercion. Effective
nonviolent action demands
courage, planning and
persistence. When practiced
successfully non-violence
attracts adherents to the cause.
By contrast, violence begets
violence; it polarizes and often
is self-defeating.
3. Non-violence focuses on the
issues and attainable goals.
Violence obscures the message.
4. Maintain communication with
your opponent and understand
his position. Scapegoating and
vilifying dehumanize our
opponents and thereby can
become catalysts to violence.

5. Avoid the trap of justifyir
violence in behalf of one cause
while condemning that of
another. Violence
every where—whether on
campus or in South East Asia
by whatever group —is
qualitatively the same.
6. Maintain your individu«„
choice and responsibility in
group situations. Large
meetings require planning.
Without planning they are
susceptible to mob contagion.
7. Initiate constructive
alternatives. Examples are:
Educate and communicate
with parents and
community groups as to
how campus disturbance
reflects current national
policy. Write to your home
community newspaper
explaining your ow.,
position.
Support political action
now and in the future which
represents your view. Most
productive might be a
pre-election recess, two
weeks before the November
election. To allow time fc„
this, the Eall Quarter could
be scheduled to begin two
weeks earlier than planned.
During this time, we at
Stanford could devote
ourselves to working
actively for political
candidates that be,-i
represent us.
