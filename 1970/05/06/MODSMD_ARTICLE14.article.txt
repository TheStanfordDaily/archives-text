'Immoral Social Misifts'
Editor, THE IMILY:
I am disgusted by both the
actions and lack of action at
Stanford this quarter. Immoral
social misfits endanger our lives
and property, attempting to
justify their activities by the
questionable actions of others,
while the President of our
University takes few meaningful
deterrent steps. Not only does he
allow this lawbreaking to occur,
but he shows signs of knuckling
under to the coercion of violence
and threats.
This quarter could conceivably
be lost. Further damage and
hatred could possibly scare
Stanford's decision makers into
further obeisance, and even now,
conscientious students cannot
concentrate on matters which
would deepen their understanding
of life. The administrators of our
school have both the
responsibility and the power to
return and maintain an orderly
atmosphere for the search for
truth in all areas.
Radical leaders claim that the
only way to end lawlessness is to
"off ROTC." I contend that the
only way to end this violence, and
to both minimize and combat
similar outbreaks in the future is
to "off" those who attempt to
impose their will, regardless of
means, upon this campus. These
coercive acts are testing our moral
strength and determination to
oppose assaults upon our liberty.
President Pitzer has the power,
authority, and responsibility to
remove, through court action,
suspensions, and expulsions, this
unwanted element from our
campus. As we all known, he also
has the option of avoiding a direct
stand in the matter by shunting
his responsibility onto a
slowly-acting judicial board which
in fact derives its power from him.
The ultimate responsibility for
actions against lawbreakers is his,
and I earnestly hope that he will
respond to anarchy on our
campus in a firm, consistent,
intolerant manner. Understanding
and tolerance are not
synonymous.
I implore President Pitzer to
set an example for Stanford
students, and boldly oppose
coercion. When confronted by
criminals on campus, toss 'em
out!

Work Through System
Open Letter:
1 am a member of the Silent
Majority and am pleading with
you to hear me out. You have
proved once before that the
"system" or "establishment" can
work. You proved it in the
McCarthy campaigns of
1968—you may say that you lost
because he wasn't nominated at
the convention. That was because
you didn't control the
convention.
You say that is impossible—but
look what the Young Republicans
did at the 1961 convention—they
got Barry Goldwater nominated.
So it can be done. But now you
have an easier task. You need to
win a majority in Congress who
are in agreement with your
policies on Vietnam. Instead of
three obstacles you have only

two. You must now help the
candidates with whom you agree
(and surely thc?re must be some)
to win the June primary and then
the November election.
Concentrate on those
campaigns in which you have a
chance to win. You have wasted
too much time already—the
primary is only a month away.
Get your fellow students in other
states to work for their candidates
too. If you can put a
majority — preferably
two-thirds—in Congress against
the war the President won't have
much choice but to discontinue
his present policies.
BUT THIS IS UP TO YOU.
How much easier it is for you to
have sit-ins and demonstrations
than it is to get out and work for
your candidates. You are
supposed to be very intelligent
people or you wouldn't be
here—why don't you prove it for a
change. This summer I am going
to work foi 1 the candidates I
support—but my candidates will
be in opposition to yours. I
challenge you to work against
me—and do something
constructive for a change.

Violence Doublethink
Editor, THE DAILY:
U.S. violence in support of a
Cambodian military dictatorship
is deplorable. Violence and
intimidation against faculty and
students wishing to attend classes
is also deplorable. In particular,
Len Horowitz's decision to give
the Psychology I exam was
increasing people's options, and
those who attacked him
demonstrated a good example of
Doublethink.

Who Is To Blame?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is directed to the
Stanford faculty and
administration. During the past
few weeks we have seen our
campus torn apart by rioting
resulting in thousands of dollars in
damages. Who is to blame for this
disruption, the militant students?
Yes, to some extent. But the
faculty and administration are
responsible for solving the campus
unrest.
Yet you have failed to meet
this responsibility. You have
failed as leaders. You have failed
to see the problems and issues in
their proper perspective. You have
allowed a small number of
dissident students to lead you.
You have become part of the
problem rather than part of the
solution.
The issue at Stanford isn't
Vietnam or Cambodia. It isn't
ROTC. And it isn't DOD funding
on the campus. The principal issue
is the campus rioting.
You can not solve the problems
of the world or the country if you
can not solve the difficulties on
the campus.

Republican Resolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
Members of the Stanford
Republican Club, comprised of
faculty, staff, and students, passed
the following resolution at a
meeting Sunday evening (May 3):
Whereas, the last two weeks
have witnessed the greatest
destruction of property on the
Stanford University campus in its
history, and
Whereas, the violence has
included personal injury as well as
intimidation to those who wish to
continue the pursuit of learning,
for which this University was
intended,
We urge the Stanford
University administration to act
swiftly, prcmptly, and
courageously to bring to justice
those students and non-students
who have unlawfully destroyed
property, injured persons, and
wilfully regused to recognize the
wishes of the Administration and
of the Stanford community as a
whole. As Americans, we will
defend the right of freedom of
speech within the law.
However, those who have made
a mockery of that right and
persist in trying to force
coercively their views on the
majority in illegal activities should
face the consequences of their
actions. If so many young people,
like themselves, wish the franchise
at age 18, they will convince
legislators that it should be
granted, not by looting, damaging,
or violating others rights, but
rather by proving that they can be
productive members of our
society, contributing lawfully to
the pursuit of a better life for all
Americans.

Behavioral Sciences
Editor, THE DrtLY:
At dawn on Friday, April 24,
1970, a calculated attempt was
made to burn to the ground the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,
California. Fires were set at four
different sites; had they all taken
hold, most of the Center would
have disappeared, along with the
lives of two college students
asleep in a caretaker's cottage.
Good fortune, timely discovery,
and expert fire-fighting prevented
the worst.
But the actuality was bad
enough: to speak only of
measurable losses, ten studies
were completely burned —one-
fifth of the total—with varying
destruction to the work of as
many Fellows. The worst losses
were suffered by a distinguished
Indian scholar; a major portion of
his anthropological field notes,
accumulated over a professional
lifetime, was destroyed.
The Center is both a place and
an idea. As a place, it sits on a
hillside, overlooking the campus
of Stanford University. It is built
on Stanford land, but has no
other connection with Stanford or
any other institution. As an idea,
it has had a vital and enduring
impact on the work of more than
700 scholars from the United
States and places in all parts of
the world who have had the
opportunity to spend a year there,
45 at a time, in independent study
and research.
Established in 1954 with the
aid of a Ford Foundation grant,
the Center has offered
Fellowships to social scientists
and bu ma nists—sociologists,
psychologists, anthropologists,
philosophers, political scientists,
students of history, of literature
and of language, to name just a
few—who are concerned, each in
his own way, with the behavior of
man and society. The Center
enables each scholar to pursue his
chosen field of study, in the
company of colleagues, without
constraints of any kind. The
Center, indeed, has come to

epitomize the free search for truth
in the study of man, the best
traditions of scholarly
community, interchange and
dialogue.
We do not know whose hands
set these fires; we do not know
whether the Center was a singular
target, or a symbolic one, or
merely a target of opportunity.
What is clear is that the
destruction at the Center took
place in an atmosphere where
physical violence, with cumulative
effects, has increasingly become
an accepted instrument of
political and social action. The
burned-out studies and charred
remains of books and papers at
the Center bear witness that the
consequences of violence are
perverse, uncontrollable, and
destructive of the life of the mind.

Opposing The Strike
What do you do when your
society takes action you regard as
immoral? In the United States
there are more options than
elsewhere and you must seek the
path most likely to correct the
defect. The traditional paths for
change were subverted before the
last election by our political
parties but that does not mean
that the time has come for
revolution, nor does it mean that
power politics by the intellectuals
has any hope of success. The sad
fact appears to be that the
majority of society supports the
government policy in Southeast
Asia. What we regard as immoral
action is a defect of society rather
than of Mr. Nixon.
If this be true the idea of
pressuring Nixon by closing the
universities is preposterous. The
universities provide the one ray of
hope for reorienting our country
towards mankind rather than
national "honor." To close the
university or even to seek
unanimity by coercion defeats
that goal. It also alienates the
society we must transform and
surrenders the possibility of
solution by adopting instead
self-satisfying action. We must

continue to learn and we must
continue to teach. We must be the
vanguard of the future and not
abdicate that responsibility in the
cause of futile protest which does
not serve the ends of morality as
we see it.
This is not a battle to be won
this week or this year. If "business
as usual" has i not included
political activity we may consider
ourselves delinquent. For us to
now stop business and demand an
immediate reorientation of
society is ludicrous and
irresponsible.

Shattered Glass
b.ditor, THE DAILY:
Something more than glass is
being shattered when a radical

minority says, in effect, "Accept
our determination of what is
moral, or we will destroy you."
The totalitarian implications,
both of mob rule and the police
state response required to
suppress it, are chilling. When one
ends, will the other remain?
If only history could spell out
its lessons in slogans . . .

Times of Stress
Editor, THE DAILY:
The police-student
confrontations on campus these
last several days has demonstrated
that in times of stress, many
policemen lose their self control.
This is inexcusable. The most
common reaction to this which I
have heard is "Pigs Off Campus."
The most sensible reaction to me
is that we should demand better
training programs and higher

qualifications for policemen.
Presently wages are too low to
attract many men who would be
good public servants in the
"British Bobby" sense. I believe
that a concerted effort to upgrade
the police departments would
contribute more to building the
society we want—especially in
race or student conflicts—than
riots at night.

'Failure To Communicate'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two recent letters to the Daily,
one from Martti Vailila and a
second from Dr. Wilfred Stone
(April 29 and 30, respectively)
have brought into focus some
vague notions that have been
bothering me during the chaotic

events of the past few weeks.
Both of these writers seemed to
have been dealing (beautifully and
compassionately) with our failures
to communicate among ourselves.
We Americans are notoriously
sloppy with our language; we are
perfectly willing to use a single
almost meaningless word to
describe a vast array of
experiences (e.g., a word like
"groovy" .) I suspect that this
carelessness of expression is
having disastrous effects on the
very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned
above. It would be, I think, quite
impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their
authors) to be labelled and
catalogued by terms that are
readily available these days. A
simple effort not to use words
that have lost meaning through
overuse would carry us a long way
toward modes of communication
which match the complexity of
the issues we're trying to
understand and the problems with
which we must deal.
Anne Nicol
ROTC Humanizing
Editor, THE DAILY:
The chief asset of ROTC as
stated by its proponents is that it
somehow influses educated
civilians into the military
command structure. I have yet to
read the most obvious objection
to ROTC and its presence on this
or any other campus. That is, that
there is a better, less hypcritical,
and more appropriate method of
placing thinking people in military
command positions, i.e., the
Direct Appointment.
I will use my own personal
experiences as case in point. I was
drafted out of the Peace Corps
and shortly found myself lugging
a machine gun around and saying
"Yes Sir," "No Sir," and all the
rest. Well, I learned that it was
possible to put papers in
requesting a Commission, so, on
the off chance, I did, and one
morning a couple of months later
became an instant Lieutenant.
I had been neither outstanding
nor gung-ho to rate this
promotion, in fact I was bitter
and had a rather poor attitude
about the whole mess. The
incomprehensible wisdom it takes
to drag someone out of the Peace
Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in
than we absolutely have to. The
colleges and universities of this
country and the students,
themselves, should not have to
waste their time, resources, and
energy supporting a Mickey
Mouse and dangerous program
such as ROTC.
Mickey Mouse because much of
it is fun and games and snap
courses, dangerous because the
officers that result are poorly
trained and don't really have any
idea of what the military is all
about. Too often they see only
th«» glitter and phony class status,
without realizing that it's the guys
on the bottom that are holding
the rest up. And, believe me, the

view from the bottom is a lot
different from the view at the
middle or top.
But, the two years of service
after Army ROTC are far superior
to the three involved in OCS. To
go into Army OCS you have to be
absolutely out of your mind or
intend to become so. Nearly one
year, some 50 weeks of being
treated like a mindless, unfeeling
robot, bootlick, and toilet seat is
not conducive to a healthy mental
attitude. The men in the ranks
much preferred an ROTC officer
to an OCS graduate—they may
not know much but at least
they're human.
The Direct Appointment
requires Basic Training and some
service in the ranks. Time wise, it
requires more than ROTC (not
counting time wasted in school, of
course) and less than OCS. But,
for those of us who do not intend
to get drafted and do, it's a way
out; and, for those who think that
ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

Classroom Struggle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I attended an
in-class review session for Dr. Rolf
Eliassen's Civil Engineering 170.
After demanding that two striking
students leave the classroom, he
proceeded to say that "the real
power lies with the vote" and the
courts, and that "other methods
are ineffective." When five other
strikers entered and asked him to
talk about Cambodia and ROTC,
he screamed "No!" When they
would not leave, he turned and
said "Will some of you please get
them out?" As about ten male
students charged down the aisle,
he laughingly called to one on
crutches. "You with the crutch,
hit 'em with it!" The strikers left
the room, and there was a great
deal of shouting. I don't know
what happened outside, but I
hesitate to think what would have
happened inside had the strikers
not left.
The President of Stanford
himself called for discussion of
the issues of Cambodia and ROTC
in classes Friday. Dr. Eli;i n's
behavior demonstrated hi il
belief in the real power o the
voting processes. Such behavior
on the part of a distinguished
government environmental advisor
is unforgivable.

Moffat Support
An Open Letter to Provost
Ly man:
I should like to express my
strong support for the point of
view expressed by Robert J.
Moffat in a recent letter to the
Daily (April *28), proclaiming his
outrage at the level of violence
recently seen on the campus. I
urge you to use every means at
your disposal to identify and
prosecute as vigorously as possible
any individual who committed
any act of violence or disruption
on this campus.
I feel sorry for people like
Steve Scott (letter to the Daily,
April 28) who were duped by the
more militant activists, but he
must accept the fact that he was
clearly in violation of University
regulations, and in fact the part
people like him played (as
"non-violent" protestors) had a
very major role in encouraging
violencyon this campus. He, like
everyone else, must accept
responsibility for his acts. If he
chooses to be a pawn, he must
accept the consequences.

Times of Stress
Editor, THE DAILY:
The police-student
confrontations on campus these
last several days has demonstrated
that in times of stress, many
policemen lose their self control.
This is inexcusable. The most
common reaction to this which I
have heard is "Pigs Off Campus."
The most sensible reaction to me
is that we should demand better
training programs and higher

qualifications for policemen.
Presently wages are too low to
attract many men who would be
good public servants in the
"British Bobby" sense. I believe
that a concerted effort to upgrade
the police departments would
contribute more to building the
society we want—especially in
race or student conflicts—than
riots at night.

'Failure To Communicate'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two recent letters to the Daily,
one from Martti Vailila and a
second from Dr. Wilfred Stone
(April 29 and 30, respectively)
have brought into focus some
vague notions that have been
bothering me during the chaotic

events of the past few weeks.
Both of these writers seemed to
have been dealing (beautifully and
compassionately) with our failures
to communicate among ourselves.
We Americans are notoriously
sloppy with our language; we are
perfectly willing to use a single
almost meaningless word to
describe a vast array of
experiences (e.g., a word like
"groovy" .) I suspect that this
carelessness of expression is
having disastrous effects on the
very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned
above. It would be, I think, quite
impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their
authors) to be labelled and
catalogued by terms that are
readily available these days. A
simple effort not to use words
that have lost meaning through
overuse would carry us a long way
toward modes of communication
which match the complexity of
the issues we're trying to
understand and the problems with
which we must deal.
Anne Nicol
ROTC Humanizing
Editor, THE DAILY:
The chief asset of ROTC as
stated by its proponents is that it
somehow influses educated
civilians into the military
command structure. I have yet to
read the most obvious objection
to ROTC and its presence on this
or any other campus. That is, that
there is a better, less hypcritical,
and more appropriate method of
placing thinking people in military
command positions, i.e., the
Direct Appointment.
I will use my own personal
experiences as case in point. I was
drafted out of the Peace Corps
and shortly found myself lugging
a machine gun around and saying
"Yes Sir," "No Sir," and all the
rest. Well, I learned that it was
possible to put papers in
requesting a Commission, so, on
the off chance, I did, and one
morning a couple of months later
became an instant Lieutenant.
I had been neither outstanding
nor gung-ho to rate this
promotion, in fact I was bitter
and had a rather poor attitude
about the whole mess. The
incomprehensible wisdom it takes
to drag someone out of the Peace
Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in
than we absolutely have to. The
colleges and universities of this
country and the students,
themselves, should not have to
waste their time, resources, and
energy supporting a Mickey
Mouse and dangerous program
such as ROTC.
Mickey Mouse because much of
it is fun and games and snap
courses, dangerous because the
officers that result are poorly
trained and don't really have any
idea of what the military is all
about. Too often they see only
th«» glitter and phony class status,
without realizing that it's the guys
on the bottom that are holding
the rest up. And, believe me, the

view from the bottom is a lot
different from the view at the
middle or top.
But, the two years of service
after Army ROTC are far superior
to the three involved in OCS. To
go into Army OCS you have to be
absolutely out of your mind or
intend to become so. Nearly one
year, some 50 weeks of being
treated like a mindless, unfeeling
robot, bootlick, and toilet seat is
not conducive to a healthy mental
attitude. The men in the ranks
much preferred an ROTC officer
to an OCS graduate—they may
not know much but at least
they're human.
The Direct Appointment
requires Basic Training and some
service in the ranks. Time wise, it
requires more than ROTC (not
counting time wasted in school, of
course) and less than OCS. But,
for those of us who do not intend
to get drafted and do, it's a way
out; and, for those who think that
ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

Classroom Struggle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I attended an
in-class review session for Dr. Rolf
Eliassen's Civil Engineering 170.
After demanding that two striking
students leave the classroom, he
proceeded to say that "the real
power lies with the vote" and the
courts, and that "other methods
are ineffective." When five other
strikers entered and asked him to
talk about Cambodia and ROTC,
he screamed "No!" When they
would not leave, he turned and
said "Will some of you please get
them out?" As about ten male
students charged down the aisle,
he laughingly called to one on
crutches. "You with the crutch,
hit 'em with it!" The strikers left
the room, and there was a great
deal of shouting. I don't know
what happened outside, but I
hesitate to think what would have
happened inside had the strikers
not left.
The President of Stanford
himself called for discussion of
the issues of Cambodia and ROTC
in classes Friday. Dr. Eli;i n's
behavior demonstrated hi il
belief in the real power o the
voting processes. Such behavior
on the part of a distinguished
government environmental advisor
is unforgivable.

Moffat Support
An Open Letter to Provost
Ly man:
I should like to express my
strong support for the point of
view expressed by Robert J.
Moffat in a recent letter to the
Daily (April *28), proclaiming his
outrage at the level of violence
recently seen on the campus. I
urge you to use every means at
your disposal to identify and
prosecute as vigorously as possible
any individual who committed
any act of violence or disruption
on this campus.
I feel sorry for people like
Steve Scott (letter to the Daily,
April 28) who were duped by the
more militant activists, but he
must accept the fact that he was
clearly in violation of University
regulations, and in fact the part
people like him played (as
"non-violent" protestors) had a
very major role in encouraging
violencyon this campus. He, like
everyone else, must accept
responsibility for his acts. If he
chooses to be a pawn, he must
accept the consequences.

'Immoral Social Misifts'
Editor, THE IMILY:
I am disgusted by both the
actions and lack of action at
Stanford this quarter. Immoral
social misfits endanger our lives
and property, attempting to
justify their activities by the
questionable actions of others,
while the President of our
University takes few meaningful
deterrent steps. Not only does he
allow this lawbreaking to occur,
but he shows signs of knuckling
under to the coercion of violence
and threats.
This quarter could conceivably
be lost. Further damage and
hatred could possibly scare
Stanford's decision makers into
further obeisance, and even now,
conscientious students cannot
concentrate on matters which
would deepen their understanding
of life. The administrators of our
school have both the
responsibility and the power to
return and maintain an orderly
atmosphere for the search for
truth in all areas.
Radical leaders claim that the
only way to end lawlessness is to
"off ROTC." I contend that the
only way to end this violence, and
to both minimize and combat
similar outbreaks in the future is
to "off" those who attempt to
impose their will, regardless of
means, upon this campus. These
coercive acts are testing our moral
strength and determination to
oppose assaults upon our liberty.
President Pitzer has the power,
authority, and responsibility to
remove, through court action,
suspensions, and expulsions, this
unwanted element from our
campus. As we all known, he also
has the option of avoiding a direct
stand in the matter by shunting
his responsibility onto a
slowly-acting judicial board which
in fact derives its power from him.
The ultimate responsibility for
actions against lawbreakers is his,
and I earnestly hope that he will
respond to anarchy on our
campus in a firm, consistent,
intolerant manner. Understanding
and tolerance are not
synonymous.
I implore President Pitzer to
set an example for Stanford
students, and boldly oppose
coercion. When confronted by
criminals on campus, toss 'em
out!

Work Through System
Open Letter:
1 am a member of the Silent
Majority and am pleading with
you to hear me out. You have
proved once before that the
"system" or "establishment" can
work. You proved it in the
McCarthy campaigns of
1968—you may say that you lost
because he wasn't nominated at
the convention. That was because
you didn't control the
convention.
You say that is impossible—but
look what the Young Republicans
did at the 1961 convention—they
got Barry Goldwater nominated.
So it can be done. But now you
have an easier task. You need to
win a majority in Congress who
are in agreement with your
policies on Vietnam. Instead of
three obstacles you have only

two. You must now help the
candidates with whom you agree
(and surely thc?re must be some)
to win the June primary and then
the November election.
Concentrate on those
campaigns in which you have a
chance to win. You have wasted
too much time already—the
primary is only a month away.
Get your fellow students in other
states to work for their candidates
too. If you can put a
majority — preferably
two-thirds—in Congress against
the war the President won't have
much choice but to discontinue
his present policies.
BUT THIS IS UP TO YOU.
How much easier it is for you to
have sit-ins and demonstrations
than it is to get out and work for
your candidates. You are
supposed to be very intelligent
people or you wouldn't be
here—why don't you prove it for a
change. This summer I am going
to work foi 1 the candidates I
support—but my candidates will
be in opposition to yours. I
challenge you to work against
me—and do something
constructive for a change.

Violence Doublethink
Editor, THE DAILY:
U.S. violence in support of a
Cambodian military dictatorship
is deplorable. Violence and
intimidation against faculty and
students wishing to attend classes
is also deplorable. In particular,
Len Horowitz's decision to give
the Psychology I exam was
increasing people's options, and
those who attacked him
demonstrated a good example of
Doublethink.

Who Is To Blame?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is directed to the
Stanford faculty and
administration. During the past
few weeks we have seen our
campus torn apart by rioting
resulting in thousands of dollars in
damages. Who is to blame for this
disruption, the militant students?
Yes, to some extent. But the
faculty and administration are
responsible for solving the campus
unrest.
Yet you have failed to meet
this responsibility. You have
failed as leaders. You have failed
to see the problems and issues in
their proper perspective. You have
allowed a small number of
dissident students to lead you.
You have become part of the
problem rather than part of the
solution.
The issue at Stanford isn't
Vietnam or Cambodia. It isn't
ROTC. And it isn't DOD funding
on the campus. The principal issue
is the campus rioting.
You can not solve the problems
of the world or the country if you
can not solve the difficulties on
the campus.

Republican Resolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
Members of the Stanford
Republican Club, comprised of
faculty, staff, and students, passed
the following resolution at a
meeting Sunday evening (May 3):
Whereas, the last two weeks
have witnessed the greatest
destruction of property on the
Stanford University campus in its
history, and
Whereas, the violence has
included personal injury as well as
intimidation to those who wish to
continue the pursuit of learning,
for which this University was
intended,
We urge the Stanford
University administration to act
swiftly, prcmptly, and
courageously to bring to justice
those students and non-students
who have unlawfully destroyed
property, injured persons, and
wilfully regused to recognize the
wishes of the Administration and
of the Stanford community as a
whole. As Americans, we will
defend the right of freedom of
speech within the law.
However, those who have made
a mockery of that right and
persist in trying to force
coercively their views on the
majority in illegal activities should
face the consequences of their
actions. If so many young people,
like themselves, wish the franchise
at age 18, they will convince
legislators that it should be
granted, not by looting, damaging,
or violating others rights, but
rather by proving that they can be
productive members of our
society, contributing lawfully to
the pursuit of a better life for all
Americans.
Stanford Republican Club
Behavioral Sciences
Editor, THE DrtLY:
At dawn on Friday, April 24,
1970, a calculated attempt was
made to burn to the ground the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,
California. Fires were set at four
different sites; had they all taken
hold, most of the Center would
have disappeared, along with the
lives of two college students
asleep in a caretaker's cottage.
Good fortune, timely discovery,
and expert fire-fighting prevented
the worst.
But the actuality was bad
enough: to speak only of
measurable losses, ten studies
were completely burned —one-
fifth of the total—with varying
destruction to the work of as
many Fellows. The worst losses
were suffered by a distinguished
Indian scholar; a major portion of
his anthropological field notes,
accumulated over a professional
lifetime, was destroyed.
The Center is both a place and
an idea. As a place, it sits on a
hillside, overlooking the campus
of Stanford University. It is built
on Stanford land, but has no
other connection with Stanford or
any other institution. As an idea,
it has had a vital and enduring
impact on the work of more than
700 scholars from the United
States and places in all parts of
the world who have had the
opportunity to spend a year there,
45 at a time, in independent study
and research.
Established in 1954 with the
aid of a Ford Foundation grant,
the Center has offered
Fellowships to social scientists
and bu ma nists—sociologists,
psychologists, anthropologists,
philosophers, political scientists,
students of history, of literature
and of language, to name just a
few—who are concerned, each in
his own way, with the behavior of
man and society. The Center
enables each scholar to pursue his
chosen field of study, in the
company of colleagues, without
constraints of any kind. The
Center, indeed, has come to

epitomize the free search for truth
in the study of man, the best
traditions of scholarly
community, interchange and
dialogue.
We do not know whose hands
set these fires; we do not know
whether the Center was a singular
target, or a symbolic one, or
merely a target of opportunity.
What is clear is that the
destruction at the Center took
place in an atmosphere where
physical violence, with cumulative
effects, has increasingly become
an accepted instrument of
political and social action. The
burned-out studies and charred
remains of books and papers at
the Center bear witness that the
consequences of violence are
perverse, uncontrollable, and
destructive of the life of the mind.

F ellows-In-Resldence
Opposing The Strike
What do you do when your
society takes action you regard as
immoral? In the United States
there are more options than
elsewhere and you must seek the
path most likely to correct the
defect. The traditional paths for
change were subverted before the
last election by our political
parties but that does not mean
that the time has come for
revolution, nor does it mean that
power politics by the intellectuals
has any hope of success. The sad
fact appears to be that the
majority of society supports the
government policy in Southeast
Asia. What we regard as immoral
action is a defect of society rather
than of Mr. Nixon.
If this be true the idea of
pressuring Nixon by closing the
universities is preposterous. The
universities provide the one ray of
hope for reorienting our country
towards mankind rather than
national "honor." To close the
university or even to seek
unanimity by coercion defeats
that goal. It also alienates the
society we must transform and
surrenders the possibility of
solution by adopting instead
self-satisfying action. We must

continue to learn and we must
continue to teach. We must be the
vanguard of the future and not
abdicate that responsibility in the
cause of futile protest which does
not serve the ends of morality as
we see it.
This is not a battle to be won
this week or this year. If "business
as usual" has i not included
political activity we may consider
ourselves delinquent. For us to
now stop business and demand an
immediate reorientation of
society is ludicrous and
irresponsible.

Work Through System
Open Letter:
1 am a member of the Silent
Majority and am pleading with
you to hear me out. You have
proved once before that the
"system" or "establishment" can
work. You proved it in the
McCarthy campaigns of
1968—you may say that you lost
because he wasn't nominated at
the convention. That was because
you didn't control the
convention.
You say that is impossible—but
look what the Young Republicans
did at the 1961 convention—they
got Barry Goldwater nominated.
So it can be done. But now you
have an easier task. You need to
win a majority in Congress who
are in agreement with your
policies on Vietnam. Instead of
three obstacles you have only

two. You must now help the
candidates with whom you agree
(and surely thc?re must be some)
to win the June primary and then
the November election.
Concentrate on those
campaigns in which you have a
chance to win. You have wasted
too much time already—the
primary is only a month away.
Get your fellow students in other
states to work for their candidates
too. If you can put a
majority — preferably
two-thirds—in Congress against
the war the President won't have
much choice but to discontinue
his present policies.
BUT THIS IS UP TO YOU.
How much easier it is for you to
have sit-ins and demonstrations
than it is to get out and work for
your candidates. You are
supposed to be very intelligent
people or you wouldn't be
here—why don't you prove it for a
change. This summer I am going
to work foi 1 the candidates I
support—but my candidates will
be in opposition to yours. I
challenge you to work against
me—and do something
constructive for a change.

Violence Doublethink
Editor, THE DAILY:
U.S. violence in support of a

is deplorable. Violence and
intimidation against faculty and

Who Is To Blame?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is directed to the
Stanford faculty and
administration. During the past
few weeks we have seen our
campus torn apart by rioting
resulting in thousands of dollars in
damages. Who is to blame for this
disruption, the militant students?
Yes, to some extent. But the
faculty and administration are
responsible for solving the campus
unrest.
Yet you have failed to meet
this responsibility. You have
failed as leaders. You have failed
to see the problems and issues in
their proper perspective. You have
allowed a small number of
dissident students to lead you.
You have become part of the
problem rather than part of the
solution.
The issue at Stanford isn't
Vietnam or Cambodia. It isn't
ROTC. And it isn't DOD funding
on the campus. The principal issue
is the campus rioting.
You can not solve the problems
of the world or the country if you
can not solve the difficulties on
the campus.

Republican Resolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
Members of the Stanford
Republican Club, comprised of
faculty, staff, and students, passed
the following resolution at a
meeting Sunday evening (May 3):
Whereas, the last two weeks
have witnessed the greatest
destruction of property on the
Stanford University campus in its
history, and
Whereas, the violence has
included personal injury as well as
intimidation to those who wish to
continue the pursuit of learning,
for which this University was
intended,
We urge the Stanford
University administration to act
swiftly, prcmptly, and
courageously to bring to justice
those students and non-students
who have unlawfully destroyed
property, injured persons, and
wilfully regused to recognize the
wishes of the Administration and
of the Stanford community as a
whole. As Americans, we will
defend the right of freedom of
speech within the law.
However, those who have made
a mockery of that right and
persist in trying to force
coercively their views on the
majority in illegal activities should
face the consequences of their
actions. If so many young people,
like themselves, wish the franchise
at age 18, they will convince
legislators that it should be
granted, not by looting, damaging,
or violating others rights, but
rather by proving that they can be
productive members of our
society, contributing lawfully to
the pursuit of a better life for all
Americans.

Behavioral Sciences
Editor, THE DrtLY:
At dawn on Friday, April 24,
1970, a calculated attempt was
made to burn to the ground the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,
California. Fires were set at four
different sites; had they all taken
hold, most of the Center would
have disappeared, along with the
lives of two college students
asleep in a caretaker's cottage.
Good fortune, timely discovery,
and expert fire-fighting prevented
the worst.
But the actuality was bad
enough: to speak only of
measurable losses, ten studies
were completely burned —one-
fifth of the total—with varying
destruction to the work of as
many Fellows. The worst losses
were suffered by a distinguished
Indian scholar; a major portion of
his anthropological field notes,
accumulated over a professional
lifetime, was destroyed.
The Center is both a place and
an idea. As a place, it sits on a
hillside, overlooking the campus
of Stanford University. It is built
on Stanford land, but has no
other connection with Stanford or
any other institution. As an idea,
it has had a vital and enduring
impact on the work of more than
700 scholars from the United
States and places in all parts of
the world who have had the
opportunity to spend a year there,
45 at a time, in independent study
and research.
Established in 1954 with the
aid of a Ford Foundation grant,
the Center has offered
Fellowships to social scientists
and bu ma nists—sociologists,
psychologists, anthropologists,
philosophers, political scientists,
students of history, of literature
and of language, to name just a
few—who are concerned, each in
his own way, with the behavior of
man and society. The Center
enables each scholar to pursue his
chosen field of study, in the
company of colleagues, without
constraints of any kind. The
Center, indeed, has come to

epitomize the free search for truth
in the study of man, the best
traditions of scholarly
community, interchange and
dialogue.
We do not know whose hands
set these fires; we do not know
whether the Center was a singular
target, or a symbolic one, or
merely a target of opportunity.
What is clear is that the
destruction at the Center took
place in an atmosphere where
physical violence, with cumulative
effects, has increasingly become
an accepted instrument of
political and social action. The
burned-out studies and charred
remains of books and papers at
the Center bear witness that the
consequences of violence are
perverse, uncontrollable, and
destructive of the life of the mind.

Opposing The Strike
What do you do when your
society takes action you regard as
immoral? In the United States
there are more options than
elsewhere and you must seek the
path most likely to correct the
defect. The traditional paths for
change were subverted before the
last election by our political
parties but that does not mean
that the time has come for
revolution, nor does it mean that
power politics by the intellectuals
has any hope of success. The sad
fact appears to be that the
majority of society supports the
government policy in Southeast
Asia. What we regard as immoral
action is a defect of society rather
than of Mr. Nixon.
If this be true the idea of
pressuring Nixon by closing the
universities is preposterous. The
universities provide the one ray of
hope for reorienting our country
towards mankind rather than
national "honor." To close the
university or even to seek
unanimity by coercion defeats
that goal. It also alienates the
society we must transform and
surrenders the possibility of
solution by adopting instead
self-satisfying action. We must

continue to learn and we must
continue to teach. We must be the
vanguard of the future and not
abdicate that responsibility in the
cause of futile protest which does
not serve the ends of morality as
we see it.
This is not a battle to be won
this week or this year. If "business
as usual" has i not included
political activity we may consider
ourselves delinquent. For us to
now stop business and demand an
immediate reorientation of
society is ludicrous and
irresponsible.

Times of Stress
Editor, THE DAILY:
The police-student
confrontations on campus these
last several days has demonstrated
that in times of stress, many
policemen lose their self control.
This is inexcusable. The most
common reaction to this which I
have heard is "Pigs Off Campus."
The most sensible reaction to me
is that we should demand better
training programs and higher

qualifications for policemen.
Presently wages are too low to
attract many men who would be
good public servants in the
"British Bobby" sense. I believe
that a concerted effort to upgrade
the police departments would
contribute more to building the
society we want—especially in
race or student conflicts—than
riots at night.

'Failure To Communicate'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two recent letters to the Daily,
one from Martti Vailila and a
second from Dr. Wilfred Stone
(April 29 and 30, respectively)
have brought into focus some
vague notions that have been
bothering me during the chaotic

events of the past few weeks.
Both of these writers seemed to
have been dealing (beautifully and
compassionately) with our failures
to communicate among ourselves.
We Americans are notoriously
sloppy with our language; we are
perfectly willing to use a single
almost meaningless word to
describe a vast array of
experiences (e.g., a word like
"groovy" .) I suspect that this
carelessness of expression is
having disastrous effects on the
very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned
above. It would be, I think, quite
impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their
authors) to be labelled and
catalogued by terms that are
readily available these days. A
simple effort not to use words
that have lost meaning through
overuse would carry us a long way
toward modes of communication
which match the complexity of
the issues we're trying to
understand and the problems with
which we must deal.
Anne Nicol
ROTC Humanizing
Editor, THE DAILY:
The chief asset of ROTC as
stated by its proponents is that it
somehow influses educated
civilians into the military
command structure. I have yet to
read the most obvious objection
to ROTC and its presence on this
or any other campus. That is, that
there is a better, less hypcritical,
and more appropriate method of
placing thinking people in military
command positions, i.e., the
Direct Appointment.
I will use my own personal
experiences as case in point. I was
drafted out of the Peace Corps
and shortly found myself lugging
a machine gun around and saying
"Yes Sir," "No Sir," and all the
rest. Well, I learned that it was
possible to put papers in
requesting a Commission, so, on
the off chance, I did, and one
morning a couple of months later
became an instant Lieutenant.
I had been neither outstanding
nor gung-ho to rate this
promotion, in fact I was bitter
and had a rather poor attitude
about the whole mess. The
incomprehensible wisdom it takes
to drag someone out of the Peace
Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in
than we absolutely have to. The
colleges and universities of this
country and the students,
themselves, should not have to
waste their time, resources, and
energy supporting a Mickey
Mouse and dangerous program
such as ROTC.
Mickey Mouse because much of
it is fun and games and snap
courses, dangerous because the
officers that result are poorly
trained and don't really have any
idea of what the military is all
about. Too often they see only
th«» glitter and phony class status,
without realizing that it's the guys
on the bottom that are holding
the rest up. And, believe me, the

view from the bottom is a lot
different from the view at the
middle or top.
But, the two years of service
after Army ROTC are far superior
to the three involved in OCS. To
go into Army OCS you have to be
absolutely out of your mind or
intend to become so. Nearly one
year, some 50 weeks of being
treated like a mindless, unfeeling
robot, bootlick, and toilet seat is
not conducive to a healthy mental
attitude. The men in the ranks
much preferred an ROTC officer
to an OCS graduate—they may
not know much but at least
they're human.
The Direct Appointment
requires Basic Training and some
service in the ranks. Time wise, it
requires more than ROTC (not
counting time wasted in school, of
course) and less than OCS. But,
for those of us who do not intend
to get drafted and do, it's a way
out; and, for those who think that
ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

Classroom Struggle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I attended an
in-class review session for Dr. Rolf
Eliassen's Civil Engineering 170.
After demanding that two striking
students leave the classroom, he
proceeded to say that "the real
power lies with the vote" and the
courts, and that "other methods
are ineffective." When five other
strikers entered and asked him to
talk about Cambodia and ROTC,
he screamed "No!" When they
would not leave, he turned and
said "Will some of you please get
them out?" As about ten male
students charged down the aisle,
he laughingly called to one on
crutches. "You with the crutch,
hit 'em with it!" The strikers left
the room, and there was a great
deal of shouting. I don't know
what happened outside, but I
hesitate to think what would have
happened inside had the strikers
not left.
The President of Stanford
himself called for discussion of
the issues of Cambodia and ROTC
in classes Friday. Dr. Eli;i n's
behavior demonstrated hi il
belief in the real power o the
voting processes. Such behavior
on the part of a distinguished
government environmental advisor
is unforgivable.

Moffat Support
An Open Letter to Provost
Ly man:
I should like to express my
strong support for the point of
view expressed by Robert J.
Moffat in a recent letter to the
Daily (April *28), proclaiming his
outrage at the level of violence
recently seen on the campus. I
urge you to use every means at
your disposal to identify and
prosecute as vigorously as possible
any individual who committed
any act of violence or disruption
on this campus.
I feel sorry for people like
Steve Scott (letter to the Daily,
April 28) who were duped by the
more militant activists, but he
must accept the fact that he was
clearly in violation of University
regulations, and in fact the part
people like him played (as
"non-violent" protestors) had a
very major role in encouraging
violencyon this campus. He, like
everyone else, must accept
responsibility for his acts. If he
chooses to be a pawn, he must
accept the consequences.

'Immoral Social Misifts'
Editor, THE IMILY:
I am disgusted by both the
actions and lack of action at
Stanford this quarter. Immoral
social misfits endanger our lives
and property, attempting to
justify their activities by the
questionable actions of others,
while the President of our
University takes few meaningful
deterrent steps. Not only does he
allow this lawbreaking to occur,
but he shows signs of knuckling
under to the coercion of violence
and threats.
This quarter could conceivably
be lost. Further damage and
hatred could possibly scare
Stanford's decision makers into
further obeisance, and even now,
conscientious students cannot
concentrate on matters which
would deepen their understanding
of life. The administrators of our
school have both the
responsibility and the power to
return and maintain an orderly
atmosphere for the search for
truth in all areas.
Radical leaders claim that the
only way to end lawlessness is to
"off ROTC." I contend that the
only way to end this violence, and
to both minimize and combat
similar outbreaks in the future is
to "off" those who attempt to
impose their will, regardless of
means, upon this campus. These
coercive acts are testing our moral
strength and determination to
oppose assaults upon our liberty.
President Pitzer has the power,
authority, and responsibility to
remove, through court action,
suspensions, and expulsions, this
unwanted element from our
campus. As we all known, he also
has the option of avoiding a direct
stand in the matter by shunting
his responsibility onto a
slowly-acting judicial board which
in fact derives its power from him.
The ultimate responsibility for
actions against lawbreakers is his,
and I earnestly hope that he will
respond to anarchy on our
campus in a firm, consistent,
intolerant manner. Understanding
and tolerance are not
synonymous.
I implore President Pitzer to
set an example for Stanford
students, and boldly oppose
coercion. When confronted by
criminals on campus, toss 'em
out!

very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned
above. It would be, I think, quite
impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their
authors) to be labelled and
catalogued by terms that are
readily available these days. A
simple effort not to use words
that have lost meaning through
overuse would carry us a long way
toward modes of communication
which match the complexity of
the issues we're trying to
understand and the problems with
which we must deal.
Anne Nicol
ROTC Humanizing
Editor, THE DAILY:
The chief asset of ROTC as
stated by its proponents is that it
somehow influses educated
civilians into the military
command structure. I have yet to
read the most obvious objection
to ROTC and its presence on this
or any other campus. That is, that
there is a better, less hypcritical,
and more appropriate method of
placing thinking people in military
command positions, i.e., the
Direct Appointment.
I will use my own personal
experiences as case in point. I was
drafted out of the Peace Corps
and shortly found myself lugging
a machine gun around and saying
"Yes Sir," "No Sir," and all the
rest. Well, I learned that it was
possible to put papers in
requesting a Commission, so, on
the off chance, I did, and one
morning a couple of months later
became an instant Lieutenant.
I had been neither outstanding
nor gung-ho to rate this
promotion, in fact I was bitter
and had a rather poor attitude
about the whole mess. The
incomprehensible wisdom it takes
to drag someone out of the Peace
Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in
than we absolutely have to. The
colleges and universities of this
country and the students,
themselves, should not have to
waste their time, resources, and
energy supporting a Mickey
Mouse and dangerous program
such as ROTC.
Mickey Mouse because much of
it is fun and games and snap
courses, dangerous because the
officers that result are poorly
trained and don't really have any
idea of what the military is all
about. Too often they see only
th«» glitter and phony class status,
without realizing that it's the guys
on the bottom that are holding
the rest up. And, believe me, the

view from the bottom is a lot
different from the view at the
middle or top.
But, the two years of service
after Army ROTC are far superior
to the three involved in OCS. To
go into Army OCS you have to be
absolutely out of your mind or
intend to become so. Nearly one
year, some 50 weeks of being
treated like a mindless, unfeeling
robot, bootlick, and toilet seat is
not conducive to a healthy mental
attitude. The men in the ranks
much preferred an ROTC officer
to an OCS graduate—they may
not know much but at least
they're human.
The Direct Appointment
requires Basic Training and some
service in the ranks. Time wise, it
requires more than ROTC (not
counting time wasted in school, of
course) and less than OCS. But,
for those of us who do not intend
to get drafted and do, it's a way
out; and, for those who think that
ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

Classroom Struggle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I attended an
in-class review session for Dr. Rolf
Eliassen's Civil Engineering 170.
After demanding that two striking
students leave the classroom, he
proceeded to say that "the real
power lies with the vote" and the
courts, and that "other methods
are ineffective." When five other
strikers entered and asked him to
talk about Cambodia and ROTC,
he screamed "No!" When they
would not leave, he turned and
said "Will some of you please get
them out?" As about ten male
students charged down the aisle,
he laughingly called to one on
crutches. "You with the crutch,
hit 'em with it!" The strikers left
the room, and there was a great
deal of shouting. I don't know
what happened outside, but I
hesitate to think what would have
happened inside had the strikers
not left.
The President of Stanford
himself called for discussion of
the issues of Cambodia and ROTC
in classes Friday. Dr. Eli;i n's
behavior demonstrated hi il
belief in the real power o the
voting processes. Such behavior
on the part of a distinguished
government environmental advisor
is unforgivable.

Moffat Support
An Open Letter to Provost
Ly man:
I should like to express my
strong support for the point of
view expressed by Robert J.
Moffat in a recent letter to the
Daily (April *28), proclaiming his
outrage at the level of violence
recently seen on the campus. I
urge you to use every means at
your disposal to identify and
prosecute as vigorously as possible
any individual who committed
any act of violence or disruption
on this campus.
I feel sorry for people like
Steve Scott (letter to the Daily,
April 28) who were duped by the
more militant activists, but he
must accept the fact that he was
clearly in violation of University
regulations, and in fact the part
people like him played (as
"non-violent" protestors) had a
very major role in encouraging
violencyon this campus. He, like
everyone else, must accept
responsibility for his acts. If he
chooses to be a pawn, he must
accept the consequences.

'Immoral Social Misifts'
Editor, THE IMILY:
I am disgusted by both the
actions and lack of action at
Stanford this quarter. Immoral
social misfits endanger our lives
and property, attempting to
justify their activities by the
questionable actions of others,
while the President of our
University takes few meaningful
deterrent steps. Not only does he
allow this lawbreaking to occur,
but he shows signs of knuckling
under to the coercion of violence
and threats.
This quarter could conceivably
be lost. Further damage and
hatred could possibly scare
Stanford's decision makers into
further obeisance, and even now,
conscientious students cannot
concentrate on matters which
would deepen their understanding
of life. The administrators of our
school have both the
responsibility and the power to
return and maintain an orderly
atmosphere for the search for
truth in all areas.
Radical leaders claim that the
only way to end lawlessness is to
"off ROTC." I contend that the
only way to end this violence, and
to both minimize and combat
similar outbreaks in the future is
to "off" those who attempt to
impose their will, regardless of
means, upon this campus. These
coercive acts are testing our moral
strength and determination to
oppose assaults upon our liberty.
President Pitzer has the power,
authority, and responsibility to
remove, through court action,
suspensions, and expulsions, this
unwanted element from our
campus. As we all known, he also
has the option of avoiding a direct
stand in the matter by shunting
his responsibility onto a
slowly-acting judicial board which
in fact derives its power from him.
The ultimate responsibility for
actions against lawbreakers is his,
and I earnestly hope that he will
respond to anarchy on our
campus in a firm, consistent,
intolerant manner. Understanding
and tolerance are not
synonymous.
I implore President Pitzer to
set an example for Stanford
students, and boldly oppose
coercion. When confronted by
criminals on campus, toss 'em
out!

Work Through System
Open Letter:
1 am a member of the Silent
Majority and am pleading with
you to hear me out. You have
proved once before that the
"system" or "establishment" can
work. You proved it in the
McCarthy campaigns of
1968—you may say that you lost
because he wasn't nominated at
the convention. That was because
you didn't control the
convention.
You say that is impossible—but
look what the Young Republicans
did at the 1961 convention—they
got Barry Goldwater nominated.
So it can be done. But now you
have an easier task. You need to
win a majority in Congress who
are in agreement with your
policies on Vietnam. Instead of
three obstacles you have only

two. You must now help the
candidates with whom you agree
(and surely thc?re must be some)
to win the June primary and then
the November election.
Concentrate on those
campaigns in which you have a
chance to win. You have wasted
too much time already—the
primary is only a month away.
Get your fellow students in other
states to work for their candidates
too. If you can put a
majority — preferably
two-thirds—in Congress against
the war the President won't have
much choice but to discontinue
his present policies.
BUT THIS IS UP TO YOU.
How much easier it is for you to
have sit-ins and demonstrations
than it is to get out and work for
your candidates. You are
supposed to be very intelligent
people or you wouldn't be
here—why don't you prove it for a
change. This summer I am going
to work foi 1 the candidates I
support—but my candidates will
be in opposition to yours. I
challenge you to work against
me—and do something
constructive for a change.

Violence Doublethink
Editor, THE DAILY:
U.S. violence in support of a
Cambodian military dictatorship
is deplorable. Violence and
intimidation against faculty and
students wishing to attend classes
is also deplorable. In particular,
Len Horowitz's decision to give
the Psychology I exam was
increasing people's options, and
those who attacked him
demonstrated a good example of
Doublethink.

Who Is To Blame?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is directed to the
Stanford faculty and
administration. During the past
few weeks we have seen our
campus torn apart by rioting
resulting in thousands of dollars in
damages. Who is to blame for this
disruption, the militant students?
Yes, to some extent. But the
faculty and administration are
responsible for solving the campus
unrest.
Yet you have failed to meet
this responsibility. You have
failed as leaders. You have failed
to see the problems and issues in
their proper perspective. You have
allowed a small number of
dissident students to lead you.
You have become part of the
problem rather than part of the
solution.
The issue at Stanford isn't
Vietnam or Cambodia. It isn't
ROTC. And it isn't DOD funding
on the campus. The principal issue
is the campus rioting.
You can not solve the problems
of the world or the country if you
can not solve the difficulties on
the campus.

Republican Resolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
Members of the Stanford
Republican Club, comprised of
faculty, staff, and students, passed
the following resolution at a
meeting Sunday evening (May 3):
Whereas, the last two weeks
have witnessed the greatest
destruction of property on the
Stanford University campus in its
history, and
Whereas, the violence has
included personal injury as well as
intimidation to those who wish to
continue the pursuit of learning,
for which this University was
intended,
We urge the Stanford
University administration to act
swiftly, prcmptly, and
courageously to bring to justice
those students and non-students
who have unlawfully destroyed
property, injured persons, and
wilfully regused to recognize the
wishes of the Administration and
of the Stanford community as a
whole. As Americans, we will
defend the right of freedom of
speech within the law.
However, those who have made
a mockery of that right and
persist in trying to force
coercively their views on the
majority in illegal activities should
face the consequences of their
actions. If so many young people,
like themselves, wish the franchise
at age 18, they will convince
legislators that it should be
granted, not by looting, damaging,
or violating others rights, but
rather by proving that they can be
productive members of our
society, contributing lawfully to
the pursuit of a better life for all
Americans.

Behavioral Sciences
Editor, THE DrtLY:
At dawn on Friday, April 24,
1970, a calculated attempt was
made to burn to the ground the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,
California. Fires were set at four
different sites; had they all taken
hold, most of the Center would
have disappeared, along with the
lives of two college students
asleep in a caretaker's cottage.
Good fortune, timely discovery,
and expert fire-fighting prevented
the worst.
But the actuality was bad
enough: to speak only of
measurable losses, ten studies
were completely burned —one-
fifth of the total—with varying
destruction to the work of as
many Fellows. The worst losses
were suffered by a distinguished
Indian scholar; a major portion of
his anthropological field notes,
accumulated over a professional
lifetime, was destroyed.
The Center is both a place and
an idea. As a place, it sits on a
hillside, overlooking the campus
of Stanford University. It is built
on Stanford land, but has no
other connection with Stanford or
any other institution. As an idea,
it has had a vital and enduring
impact on the work of more than
700 scholars from the United
States and places in all parts of
the world who have had the
opportunity to spend a year there,
45 at a time, in independent study
and research.
Established in 1954 with the
aid of a Ford Foundation grant,
the Center has offered
Fellowships to social scientists
and bu ma nists—sociologists,
psychologists, anthropologists,
philosophers, political scientists,
students of history, of literature
and of language, to name just a
few—who are concerned, each in
his own way, with the behavior of
man and society. The Center
enables each scholar to pursue his
chosen field of study, in the
company of colleagues, without
constraints of any kind. The
Center, indeed, has come to

epitomize the free search for truth
in the study of man, the best
traditions of scholarly
community, interchange and
dialogue.
We do not know whose hands
set these fires; we do not know
whether the Center was a singular
target, or a symbolic one, or
merely a target of opportunity.
What is clear is that the
destruction at the Center took
place in an atmosphere where
physical violence, with cumulative
effects, has increasingly become
an accepted instrument of
political and social action. The
burned-out studies and charred
remains of books and papers at
the Center bear witness that the
consequences of violence are
perverse, uncontrollable, and
destructive of the life of the mind.

F ellows-In-Resldence
Opposing The Strike
What do you do when your
society takes action you regard as
immoral? In the United States
there are more options than
elsewhere and you must seek the
path most likely to correct the
defect. The traditional paths for
change were subverted before the
last election by our political
parties but that does not mean
that the time has come for
revolution, nor does it mean that
power politics by the intellectuals
has any hope of success. The sad
fact appears to be that the
majority of society supports the
government policy in Southeast
Asia. What we regard as immoral
action is a defect of society rather
than of Mr. Nixon.
If this be true the idea of
pressuring Nixon by closing the
universities is preposterous. The
universities provide the one ray of
hope for reorienting our country
towards mankind rather than
national "honor." To close the
university or even to seek
unanimity by coercion defeats
that goal. It also alienates the
society we must transform and
surrenders the possibility of
solution by adopting instead
self-satisfying action. We must

continue to learn and we must
continue to teach. We must be the
vanguard of the future and not
abdicate that responsibility in the
cause of futile protest which does
not serve the ends of morality as
we see it.
This is not a battle to be won
this week or this year. If "business
as usual" has i not included
political activity we may consider
ourselves delinquent. For us to
now stop business and demand an
immediate reorientation of
society is ludicrous and
irresponsible.

Shattered Glass
b.ditor, THE DAILY:
Something more than glass is
being shattered when a radical

minority says, in effect, "Accept
our determination of what is
moral, or we will destroy you."
The totalitarian implications,
both of mob rule and the police
state response required to
suppress it, are chilling. When one
ends, will the other remain?
If only history could spell out

Times of Stress
Editor, THE DAILY:
The police-student
confrontations on campus these
last several days has demonstrated
that in times of stress, many
policemen lose their self control.
This is inexcusable. The most
common reaction to this which I
have heard is "Pigs Off Campus."
The most sensible reaction to me
is that we should demand better
training programs and higher

qualifications for policemen.
Presently wages are too low to
attract many men who would be
good public servants in the
"British Bobby" sense. I believe
that a concerted effort to upgrade
the police departments would
contribute more to building the
society we want—especially in
race or student conflicts—than
riots at night.

'Failure To Communicate'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two recent letters to the Daily,
one from Martti Vailila and a
second from Dr. Wilfred Stone
(April 29 and 30, respectively)
have brought into focus some
vague notions that have been
bothering me during the chaotic

events of the past few weeks.
Both of these writers seemed to
have been dealing (beautifully and
compassionately) with our failures
to communicate among ourselves.
We Americans are notoriously
sloppy with our language; we are
perfectly willing to use a single
almost meaningless word to
describe a vast array of
experiences (e.g., a word like
"groovy" .) I suspect that this
carelessness of expression is
having disastrous effects on the
very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned

impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their

Violence Doublethink
Editor, THE DAILY:
U.S. violence in support of a
Cambodian military dictatorship
is deplorable. Violence and
intimidation against faculty and
students wishing to attend classes
is also deplorable. In particular,
Len Horowitz's decision to give
the Psychology I exam was
increasing people's options, and
those who attacked him
demonstrated a good example of
Doublethink.

Who Is To Blame?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is directed to the
Stanford faculty and
administration. During the past
few weeks we have seen our
campus torn apart by rioting
resulting in thousands of dollars in
damages. Who is to blame for this
disruption, the militant students?
Yes, to some extent. But the
faculty and administration are
responsible for solving the campus
unrest.
Yet you have failed to meet
this responsibility. You have
failed as leaders. You have failed
to see the problems and issues in
their proper perspective. You have
allowed a small number of
dissident students to lead you.
You have become part of the
problem rather than part of the
solution.
The issue at Stanford isn't
Vietnam or Cambodia. It isn't
ROTC. And it isn't DOD funding
on the campus. The principal issue
is the campus rioting.
You can not solve the problems
of the world or the country if you
can not solve the difficulties on
the campus.

Republican Resolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
Members of the Stanford
Republican Club, comprised of
faculty, staff, and students, passed
the following resolution at a
meeting Sunday evening (May 3):
Whereas, the last two weeks
have witnessed the greatest
destruction of property on the
Stanford University campus in its
history, and
Whereas, the violence has
included personal injury as well as
intimidation to those who wish to
continue the pursuit of learning,
for which this University was
intended,
We urge the Stanford
University administration to act
swiftly, prcmptly, and
courageously to bring to justice
those students and non-students
who have unlawfully destroyed
property, injured persons, and
wilfully regused to recognize the
wishes of the Administration and
of the Stanford community as a
whole. As Americans, we will
defend the right of freedom of
speech within the law.
However, those who have made
a mockery of that right and
persist in trying to force
coercively their views on the
majority in illegal activities should
face the consequences of their
actions. If so many young people,
like themselves, wish the franchise
at age 18, they will convince
legislators that it should be
granted, not by looting, damaging,
or violating others rights, but
rather by proving that they can be
productive members of our
society, contributing lawfully to
the pursuit of a better life for all
Americans.

Behavioral Sciences
Editor, THE DrtLY:
At dawn on Friday, April 24,
1970, a calculated attempt was
made to burn to the ground the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,
California. Fires were set at four
different sites; had they all taken
hold, most of the Center would
have disappeared, along with the
lives of two college students
asleep in a caretaker's cottage.
Good fortune, timely discovery,
and expert fire-fighting prevented
the worst.
But the actuality was bad
enough: to speak only of
measurable losses, ten studies
were completely burned —one-
fifth of the total—with varying
destruction to the work of as
many Fellows. The worst losses
were suffered by a distinguished
Indian scholar; a major portion of
his anthropological field notes,
accumulated over a professional
lifetime, was destroyed.
The Center is both a place and
an idea. As a place, it sits on a
hillside, overlooking the campus
of Stanford University. It is built
on Stanford land, but has no
other connection with Stanford or
any other institution. As an idea,
it has had a vital and enduring
impact on the work of more than
700 scholars from the United
States and places in all parts of
the world who have had the
opportunity to spend a year there,
45 at a time, in independent study
and research.
Established in 1954 with the
aid of a Ford Foundation grant,
the Center has offered
Fellowships to social scientists
and bu ma nists—sociologists,
psychologists, anthropologists,
philosophers, political scientists,
students of history, of literature
and of language, to name just a
few—who are concerned, each in
his own way, with the behavior of
man and society. The Center
enables each scholar to pursue his
chosen field of study, in the
company of colleagues, without
constraints of any kind. The
Center, indeed, has come to

epitomize the free search for truth
in the study of man, the best
traditions of scholarly
community, interchange and
dialogue.
We do not know whose hands
set these fires; we do not know
whether the Center was a singular
target, or a symbolic one, or
merely a target of opportunity.
What is clear is that the
destruction at the Center took
place in an atmosphere where
physical violence, with cumulative
effects, has increasingly become
an accepted instrument of
political and social action. The
burned-out studies and charred
remains of books and papers at
the Center bear witness that the
consequences of violence are
perverse, uncontrollable, and
destructive of the life of the mind.

Opposing The Strike
What do you do when your
society takes action you regard as
immoral? In the United States
there are more options than
elsewhere and you must seek the
path most likely to correct the
defect. The traditional paths for
change were subverted before the
last election by our political
parties but that does not mean
that the time has come for
revolution, nor does it mean that
power politics by the intellectuals
has any hope of success. The sad
fact appears to be that the
majority of society supports the
government policy in Southeast
Asia. What we regard as immoral
action is a defect of society rather
than of Mr. Nixon.
If this be true the idea of
pressuring Nixon by closing the
universities is preposterous. The
universities provide the one ray of
hope for reorienting our country
towards mankind rather than
national "honor." To close the
university or even to seek
unanimity by coercion defeats
that goal. It also alienates the
society we must transform and
surrenders the possibility of
solution by adopting instead
self-satisfying action. We must

continue to learn and we must
continue to teach. We must be the
vanguard of the future and not
abdicate that responsibility in the
cause of futile protest which does
not serve the ends of morality as
we see it.
This is not a battle to be won
this week or this year. If "business
as usual" has i not included
political activity we may consider
ourselves delinquent. For us to
now stop business and demand an
immediate reorientation of
society is ludicrous and
irresponsible.

Times of Stress
Editor, THE DAILY:
The police-student
confrontations on campus these
last several days has demonstrated
that in times of stress, many
policemen lose their self control.
This is inexcusable. The most
common reaction to this which I
have heard is "Pigs Off Campus."
The most sensible reaction to me
is that we should demand better
training programs and higher

qualifications for policemen.
Presently wages are too low to
attract many men who would be
good public servants in the
"British Bobby" sense. I believe
that a concerted effort to upgrade
the police departments would
contribute more to building the
society we want—especially in
race or student conflicts—than
riots at night.

'Failure To Communicate'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two recent letters to the Daily,
one from Martti Vailila and a
second from Dr. Wilfred Stone
(April 29 and 30, respectively)
have brought into focus some
vague notions that have been
bothering me during the chaotic

events of the past few weeks.
Both of these writers seemed to
have been dealing (beautifully and
compassionately) with our failures
to communicate among ourselves.
We Americans are notoriously
sloppy with our language; we are
perfectly willing to use a single
almost meaningless word to
describe a vast array of
experiences (e.g., a word like
"groovy" .) I suspect that this
carelessness of expression is
having disastrous effects on the
very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned
above. It would be, I think, quite
impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their
authors) to be labelled and
catalogued by terms that are
readily available these days. A
simple effort not to use words
that have lost meaning through
overuse would carry us a long way
toward modes of communication
which match the complexity of
the issues we're trying to
understand and the problems with
which we must deal.
Anne Nicol
ROTC Humanizing
Editor, THE DAILY:
The chief asset of ROTC as
stated by its proponents is that it
somehow influses educated
civilians into the military
command structure. I have yet to
read the most obvious objection
to ROTC and its presence on this
or any other campus. That is, that
there is a better, less hypcritical,
and more appropriate method of
placing thinking people in military
command positions, i.e., the
Direct Appointment.
I will use my own personal
experiences as case in point. I was
drafted out of the Peace Corps
and shortly found myself lugging
a machine gun around and saying
"Yes Sir," "No Sir," and all the
rest. Well, I learned that it was
possible to put papers in
requesting a Commission, so, on
the off chance, I did, and one
morning a couple of months later
became an instant Lieutenant.
I had been neither outstanding
nor gung-ho to rate this
promotion, in fact I was bitter
and had a rather poor attitude
about the whole mess. The
incomprehensible wisdom it takes
to drag someone out of the Peace
Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in
than we absolutely have to. The
colleges and universities of this
country and the students,
themselves, should not have to
waste their time, resources, and
energy supporting a Mickey
Mouse and dangerous program
such as ROTC.
Mickey Mouse because much of
it is fun and games and snap
courses, dangerous because the
officers that result are poorly
trained and don't really have any
idea of what the military is all
about. Too often they see only
th«» glitter and phony class status,
without realizing that it's the guys
on the bottom that are holding
the rest up. And, believe me, the

view from the bottom is a lot
different from the view at the
middle or top.
But, the two years of service
after Army ROTC are far superior
to the three involved in OCS. To
go into Army OCS you have to be
absolutely out of your mind or
intend to become so. Nearly one
year, some 50 weeks of being
treated like a mindless, unfeeling
robot, bootlick, and toilet seat is
not conducive to a healthy mental
attitude. The men in the ranks
much preferred an ROTC officer
to an OCS graduate—they may
not know much but at least
they're human.
The Direct Appointment
requires Basic Training and some
service in the ranks. Time wise, it
requires more than ROTC (not
counting time wasted in school, of
course) and less than OCS. But,
for those of us who do not intend
to get drafted and do, it's a way
out; and, for those who think that
ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

Classroom Struggle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I attended an
in-class review session for Dr. Rolf
Eliassen's Civil Engineering 170.
After demanding that two striking
students leave the classroom, he
proceeded to say that "the real
power lies with the vote" and the
courts, and that "other methods
are ineffective." When five other
strikers entered and asked him to
talk about Cambodia and ROTC,
he screamed "No!" When they
would not leave, he turned and
said "Will some of you please get
them out?" As about ten male
students charged down the aisle,
he laughingly called to one on
crutches. "You with the crutch,
hit 'em with it!" The strikers left
the room, and there was a great
deal of shouting. I don't know
what happened outside, but I
hesitate to think what would have
happened inside had the strikers
not left.
The President of Stanford
himself called for discussion of
the issues of Cambodia and ROTC
in classes Friday. Dr. Eli;i n's
behavior demonstrated hi il
belief in the real power o the
voting processes. Such behavior
on the part of a distinguished
government environmental advisor
is unforgivable.

Moffat Support
An Open Letter to Provost
Ly man:
I should like to express my
strong support for the point of
view expressed by Robert J.
Moffat in a recent letter to the
Daily (April *28), proclaiming his
outrage at the level of violence
recently seen on the campus. I
urge you to use every means at
your disposal to identify and
prosecute as vigorously as possible
any individual who committed
any act of violence or disruption
on this campus.
I feel sorry for people like
Steve Scott (letter to the Daily,
April 28) who were duped by the
more militant activists, but he
must accept the fact that he was
clearly in violation of University
regulations, and in fact the part
people like him played (as
"non-violent" protestors) had a
very major role in encouraging
violencyon this campus. He, like
everyone else, must accept
responsibility for his acts. If he
chooses to be a pawn, he must
accept the consequences.

'Immoral Social Misifts'
Editor, THE IMILY:
I am disgusted by both the
actions and lack of action at
Stanford this quarter. Immoral
social misfits endanger our lives
and property, attempting to
justify their activities by the
questionable actions of others,
while the President of our
University takes few meaningful
deterrent steps. Not only does he
allow this lawbreaking to occur,
but he shows signs of knuckling
under to the coercion of violence
and threats.
This quarter could conceivably
be lost. Further damage and
hatred could possibly scare
Stanford's decision makers into
further obeisance, and even now,
conscientious students cannot
concentrate on matters which
would deepen their understanding
of life. The administrators of our
school have both the
responsibility and the power to
return and maintain an orderly
atmosphere for the search for
truth in all areas.
Radical leaders claim that the
only way to end lawlessness is to
"off ROTC." I contend that the
only way to end this violence, and
to both minimize and combat
similar outbreaks in the future is
to "off" those who attempt to
impose their will, regardless of
means, upon this campus. These
coercive acts are testing our moral
strength and determination to
oppose assaults upon our liberty.
President Pitzer has the power,
authority, and responsibility to
remove, through court action,
suspensions, and expulsions, this
unwanted element from our
campus. As we all known, he also
has the option of avoiding a direct
stand in the matter by shunting
his responsibility onto a
slowly-acting judicial board which
in fact derives its power from him.
The ultimate responsibility for
actions against lawbreakers is his,
and I earnestly hope that he will
respond to anarchy on our
campus in a firm, consistent,
intolerant manner. Understanding
and tolerance are not
synonymous.
I implore President Pitzer to
set an example for Stanford
students, and boldly oppose
coercion. When confronted by
criminals on campus, toss 'em
out!

Work Through System
Open Letter:
1 am a member of the Silent
Majority and am pleading with
you to hear me out. You have
proved once before that the
"system" or "establishment" can
work. You proved it in the
McCarthy campaigns of
1968—you may say that you lost
because he wasn't nominated at
the convention. That was because
you didn't control the
convention.
You say that is impossible—but
look what the Young Republicans
did at the 1961 convention—they
got Barry Goldwater nominated.
So it can be done. But now you
have an easier task. You need to
win a majority in Congress who
are in agreement with your
policies on Vietnam. Instead of
three obstacles you have only

two. You must now help the
candidates with whom you agree
(and surely thc?re must be some)
to win the June primary and then
the November election.
Concentrate on those
campaigns in which you have a
chance to win. You have wasted
too much time already—the
primary is only a month away.
Get your fellow students in other
states to work for their candidates
too. If you can put a
majority — preferably
two-thirds—in Congress against
the war the President won't have
much choice but to discontinue
his present policies.
BUT THIS IS UP TO YOU.
How much easier it is for you to
have sit-ins and demonstrations
than it is to get out and work for
your candidates. You are
supposed to be very intelligent
people or you wouldn't be
here—why don't you prove it for a
change. This summer I am going
to work foi 1 the candidates I
support—but my candidates will
be in opposition to yours. I
challenge you to work against
me—and do something
constructive for a change.

Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in
than we absolutely have to. The
colleges and universities of this
country and the students,
themselves, should not have to
waste their time, resources, and
energy supporting a Mickey
Mouse and dangerous program
such as ROTC.
Mickey Mouse because much of
it is fun and games and snap
courses, dangerous because the
officers that result are poorly
trained and don't really have any
idea of what the military is all
about. Too often they see only
th«» glitter and phony class status,
without realizing that it's the guys
on the bottom that are holding
the rest up. And, believe me, the

view from the bottom is a lot
different from the view at the
middle or top.
But, the two years of service
after Army ROTC are far superior
to the three involved in OCS. To
go into Army OCS you have to be
absolutely out of your mind or
intend to become so. Nearly one
year, some 50 weeks of being
treated like a mindless, unfeeling
robot, bootlick, and toilet seat is
not conducive to a healthy mental
attitude. The men in the ranks
much preferred an ROTC officer
to an OCS graduate—they may
not know much but at least
they're human.
The Direct Appointment
requires Basic Training and some
service in the ranks. Time wise, it
requires more than ROTC (not
counting time wasted in school, of
course) and less than OCS. But,
for those of us who do not intend
to get drafted and do, it's a way
out; and, for those who think that
ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

Classroom Struggle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I attended an
in-class review session for Dr. Rolf
Eliassen's Civil Engineering 170.
After demanding that two striking
students leave the classroom, he
proceeded to say that "the real
power lies with the vote" and the
courts, and that "other methods
are ineffective." When five other
strikers entered and asked him to
talk about Cambodia and ROTC,
he screamed "No!" When they
would not leave, he turned and
said "Will some of you please get
them out?" As about ten male
students charged down the aisle,
he laughingly called to one on
crutches. "You with the crutch,
hit 'em with it!" The strikers left
the room, and there was a great
deal of shouting. I don't know
what happened outside, but I
hesitate to think what would have
happened inside had the strikers
not left.
The President of Stanford
himself called for discussion of
the issues of Cambodia and ROTC
in classes Friday. Dr. Eli;i n's
behavior demonstrated hi il
belief in the real power o the
voting processes. Such behavior
on the part of a distinguished
government environmental advisor
is unforgivable.

Moffat Support
An Open Letter to Provost
Ly man:
I should like to express my
strong support for the point of
view expressed by Robert J.
Moffat in a recent letter to the
Daily (April *28), proclaiming his
outrage at the level of violence
recently seen on the campus. I
urge you to use every means at
your disposal to identify and
prosecute as vigorously as possible
any individual who committed
any act of violence or disruption
on this campus.
I feel sorry for people like
Steve Scott (letter to the Daily,
April 28) who were duped by the
more militant activists, but he
must accept the fact that he was
clearly in violation of University
regulations, and in fact the part
people like him played (as
"non-violent" protestors) had a
very major role in encouraging
violencyon this campus. He, like
everyone else, must accept
responsibility for his acts. If he
chooses to be a pawn, he must
accept the consequences.

'Immoral Social Misifts'
Editor, THE IMILY:
I am disgusted by both the
actions and lack of action at
Stanford this quarter. Immoral
social misfits endanger our lives
and property, attempting to
justify their activities by the
questionable actions of others,
while the President of our
University takes few meaningful
deterrent steps. Not only does he
allow this lawbreaking to occur,
but he shows signs of knuckling
under to the coercion of violence
and threats.
This quarter could conceivably
be lost. Further damage and
hatred could possibly scare
Stanford's decision makers into
further obeisance, and even now,
conscientious students cannot
concentrate on matters which
would deepen their understanding
of life. The administrators of our
school have both the
responsibility and the power to
return and maintain an orderly
atmosphere for the search for
truth in all areas.
Radical leaders claim that the
only way to end lawlessness is to
"off ROTC." I contend that the
only way to end this violence, and
to both minimize and combat
similar outbreaks in the future is
to "off" those who attempt to
impose their will, regardless of
means, upon this campus. These
coercive acts are testing our moral
strength and determination to
oppose assaults upon our liberty.
President Pitzer has the power,
authority, and responsibility to
remove, through court action,
suspensions, and expulsions, this
unwanted element from our
campus. As we all known, he also
has the option of avoiding a direct
stand in the matter by shunting
his responsibility onto a
slowly-acting judicial board which
in fact derives its power from him.
The ultimate responsibility for
actions against lawbreakers is his,
and I earnestly hope that he will
respond to anarchy on our
campus in a firm, consistent,
intolerant manner. Understanding
and tolerance are not
synonymous.
I implore President Pitzer to
set an example for Stanford
students, and boldly oppose
coercion. When confronted by
criminals on campus, toss 'em
out!

Work Through System
Open Letter:
1 am a member of the Silent
Majority and am pleading with
you to hear me out. You have
proved once before that the
"system" or "establishment" can
work. You proved it in the
McCarthy campaigns of
1968—you may say that you lost
because he wasn't nominated at
the convention. That was because
you didn't control the
convention.
You say that is impossible—but
look what the Young Republicans
did at the 1961 convention—they
got Barry Goldwater nominated.
So it can be done. But now you
have an easier task. You need to
win a majority in Congress who
are in agreement with your
policies on Vietnam. Instead of
three obstacles you have only

two. You must now help the
candidates with whom you agree
(and surely thc?re must be some)
to win the June primary and then
the November election.
Concentrate on those
campaigns in which you have a
chance to win. You have wasted
too much time already—the
primary is only a month away.
Get your fellow students in other
states to work for their candidates
too. If you can put a
majority — preferably
two-thirds—in Congress against
the war the President won't have
much choice but to discontinue
his present policies.
BUT THIS IS UP TO YOU.
How much easier it is for you to
have sit-ins and demonstrations
than it is to get out and work for
your candidates. You are
supposed to be very intelligent
people or you wouldn't be
here—why don't you prove it for a
change. This summer I am going
to work foi 1 the candidates I
support—but my candidates will
be in opposition to yours. I
challenge you to work against
me—and do something
constructive for a change.

Who Is To Blame?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is directed to the
Stanford faculty and
administration. During the past
few weeks we have seen our
campus torn apart by rioting
resulting in thousands of dollars in
damages. Who is to blame for this
disruption, the militant students?
Yes, to some extent. But the
faculty and administration are
responsible for solving the campus
unrest.
Yet you have failed to meet
this responsibility. You have
failed as leaders. You have failed
to see the problems and issues in
their proper perspective. You have
allowed a small number of
dissident students to lead you.
You have become part of the
problem rather than part of the
solution.
The issue at Stanford isn't
Vietnam or Cambodia. It isn't
ROTC. And it isn't DOD funding
on the campus. The principal issue
is the campus rioting.
You can not solve the problems
of the world or the country if you
can not solve the difficulties on
the campus.

Republican Resolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
Members of the Stanford
Republican Club, comprised of
faculty, staff, and students, passed
the following resolution at a
meeting Sunday evening (May 3):
Whereas, the last two weeks
have witnessed the greatest
destruction of property on the
Stanford University campus in its
history, and
Whereas, the violence has
included personal injury as well as
intimidation to those who wish to
continue the pursuit of learning,
for which this University was
intended,
We urge the Stanford
University administration to act
swiftly, prcmptly, and
courageously to bring to justice
those students and non-students
who have unlawfully destroyed
property, injured persons, and
wilfully regused to recognize the
wishes of the Administration and
of the Stanford community as a
whole. As Americans, we will
defend the right of freedom of
speech within the law.
However, those who have made
a mockery of that right and
persist in trying to force
coercively their views on the
majority in illegal activities should
face the consequences of their
actions. If so many young people,
like themselves, wish the franchise
at age 18, they will convince
legislators that it should be
granted, not by looting, damaging,
or violating others rights, but
rather by proving that they can be
productive members of our
society, contributing lawfully to
the pursuit of a better life for all
Americans.
Stanford Republican Club
Behavioral Sciences
Editor, THE DrtLY:
At dawn on Friday, April 24,
1970, a calculated attempt was
made to burn to the ground the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,
California. Fires were set at four
different sites; had they all taken
hold, most of the Center would
have disappeared, along with the
lives of two college students
asleep in a caretaker's cottage.
Good fortune, timely discovery,
and expert fire-fighting prevented
the worst.
But the actuality was bad
enough: to speak only of
measurable losses, ten studies
were completely burned —one-
fifth of the total—with varying
destruction to the work of as
many Fellows. The worst losses
were suffered by a distinguished
Indian scholar; a major portion of
his anthropological field notes,
accumulated over a professional
lifetime, was destroyed.
The Center is both a place and
an idea. As a place, it sits on a
hillside, overlooking the campus
of Stanford University. It is built
on Stanford land, but has no
other connection with Stanford or
any other institution. As an idea,
it has had a vital and enduring
impact on the work of more than
700 scholars from the United
States and places in all parts of
the world who have had the
opportunity to spend a year there,
45 at a time, in independent study
and research.
Established in 1954 with the
aid of a Ford Foundation grant,
the Center has offered
Fellowships to social scientists
and bu ma nists—sociologists,
psychologists, anthropologists,
philosophers, political scientists,
students of history, of literature
and of language, to name just a
few—who are concerned, each in
his own way, with the behavior of
man and society. The Center
enables each scholar to pursue his
chosen field of study, in the
company of colleagues, without
constraints of any kind. The
Center, indeed, has come to

epitomize the free search for truth
in the study of man, the best
traditions of scholarly
community, interchange and
dialogue.
We do not know whose hands
set these fires; we do not know
whether the Center was a singular
target, or a symbolic one, or
merely a target of opportunity.
What is clear is that the
destruction at the Center took
place in an atmosphere where
physical violence, with cumulative
effects, has increasingly become
an accepted instrument of
political and social action. The
burned-out studies and charred
remains of books and papers at
the Center bear witness that the
consequences of violence are
perverse, uncontrollable, and
destructive of the life of the mind.

F ellows-In-Resldence
Opposing The Strike
What do you do when your
society takes action you regard as
immoral? In the United States
there are more options than
elsewhere and you must seek the
path most likely to correct the
defect. The traditional paths for
change were subverted before the
last election by our political
parties but that does not mean
that the time has come for
revolution, nor does it mean that
power politics by the intellectuals
has any hope of success. The sad
fact appears to be that the
majority of society supports the
government policy in Southeast
Asia. What we regard as immoral
action is a defect of society rather
than of Mr. Nixon.
If this be true the idea of
pressuring Nixon by closing the
universities is preposterous. The
universities provide the one ray of
hope for reorienting our country
towards mankind rather than
national "honor." To close the
university or even to seek
unanimity by coercion defeats
that goal. It also alienates the
society we must transform and
surrenders the possibility of
solution by adopting instead
self-satisfying action. We must

continue to learn and we must
continue to teach. We must be the
vanguard of the future and not
abdicate that responsibility in the
cause of futile protest which does
not serve the ends of morality as
we see it.
This is not a battle to be won
this week or this year. If "business
as usual" has i not included
political activity we may consider
ourselves delinquent. For us to
now stop business and demand an
immediate reorientation of
society is ludicrous and
irresponsible.

Shattered Glass
b.ditor, THE DAILY:
Something more than glass is
being shattered when a radical

minority says, in effect, "Accept
our determination of what is
moral, or we will destroy you."
The totalitarian implications,
both of mob rule and the police
state response required to
suppress it, are chilling. When one
ends, will the other remain?
If only history could spell out
its lessons in slogans . . .

Times of Stress
Editor, THE DAILY:
The police-student
confrontations on campus these
last several days has demonstrated
that in times of stress, many
policemen lose their self control.
This is inexcusable. The most
common reaction to this which I
have heard is "Pigs Off Campus."
The most sensible reaction to me
is that we should demand better
training programs and higher

qualifications for policemen.
Presently wages are too low to
attract many men who would be
good public servants in the
"British Bobby" sense. I believe
that a concerted effort to upgrade
the police departments would
contribute more to building the
society we want—especially in
race or student conflicts—than
riots at night.

'Failure To Communicate'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two recent letters to the Daily,
one from Martti Vailila and a
second from Dr. Wilfred Stone
(April 29 and 30, respectively)
have brought into focus some
vague notions that have been
bothering me during the chaotic

events of the past few weeks.
Both of these writers seemed to
have been dealing (beautifully and
compassionately) with our failures
to communicate among ourselves.
We Americans are notoriously
sloppy with our language; we are
perfectly willing to use a single
almost meaningless word to
describe a vast array of
experiences (e.g., a word like
"groovy" .) I suspect that this
carelessness of expression is
having disastrous effects on the
very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned
above. It would be, I think, quite
impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their
authors) to be labelled and
catalogued by terms that are
readily available these days. A
simple effort not to use words
that have lost meaning through
overuse would carry us a long way
toward modes of communication
which match the complexity of
the issues we're trying to
understand and the problems with
which we must deal.
Anne Nicol
ROTC Humanizing
Editor, THE DAILY:
The chief asset of ROTC as
stated by its proponents is that it
somehow influses educated
civilians into the military
command structure. I have yet to
read the most obvious objection
to ROTC and its presence on this
or any other campus. That is, that
there is a better, less hypcritical,
and more appropriate method of
placing thinking people in military
command positions, i.e., the
Direct Appointment.
I will use my own personal
experiences as case in point. I was
drafted out of the Peace Corps
and shortly found myself lugging
a machine gun around and saying
"Yes Sir," "No Sir," and all the
rest. Well, I learned that it was
possible to put papers in
requesting a Commission, so, on
the off chance, I did, and one
morning a couple of months later
became an instant Lieutenant.
I had been neither outstanding
nor gung-ho to rate this
promotion, in fact I was bitter
and had a rather poor attitude
about the whole mess. The
incomprehensible wisdom it takes
to drag someone out of the Peace
Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in

who have unlawfully destroyed

defend the right of freedom of

However, those who have made
a mockery of that right and
persist in trying to force
coercively their views on the

face the consequences of their

Behavioral Sciences
Editor, THE DrtLY:
At dawn on Friday, April 24,
1970, a calculated attempt was
made to burn to the ground the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,
California. Fires were set at four
different sites; had they all taken
hold, most of the Center would
have disappeared, along with the
lives of two college students
asleep in a caretaker's cottage.
Good fortune, timely discovery,
and expert fire-fighting prevented
the worst.
But the actuality was bad
enough: to speak only of
measurable losses, ten studies
were completely burned —one-
fifth of the total—with varying
destruction to the work of as
many Fellows. The worst losses
were suffered by a distinguished
Indian scholar; a major portion of
his anthropological field notes,
accumulated over a professional
lifetime, was destroyed.
The Center is both a place and
an idea. As a place, it sits on a
hillside, overlooking the campus
of Stanford University. It is built
on Stanford land, but has no
other connection with Stanford or
any other institution. As an idea,
it has had a vital and enduring
impact on the work of more than
700 scholars from the United
States and places in all parts of
the world who have had the
opportunity to spend a year there,
45 at a time, in independent study
and research.
Established in 1954 with the
aid of a Ford Foundation grant,
the Center has offered
Fellowships to social scientists
and bu ma nists—sociologists,
psychologists, anthropologists,
philosophers, political scientists,
students of history, of literature
and of language, to name just a
few—who are concerned, each in
his own way, with the behavior of
man and society. The Center
enables each scholar to pursue his
chosen field of study, in the
company of colleagues, without
constraints of any kind. The
Center, indeed, has come to

epitomize the free search for truth
in the study of man, the best
traditions of scholarly
community, interchange and
dialogue.
We do not know whose hands
set these fires; we do not know
whether the Center was a singular
target, or a symbolic one, or
merely a target of opportunity.
What is clear is that the
destruction at the Center took
place in an atmosphere where
physical violence, with cumulative
effects, has increasingly become
an accepted instrument of
political and social action. The
burned-out studies and charred
remains of books and papers at
the Center bear witness that the
consequences of violence are
perverse, uncontrollable, and
destructive of the life of the mind.

Opposing The Strike
What do you do when your
society takes action you regard as
immoral? In the United States
there are more options than
elsewhere and you must seek the
path most likely to correct the
defect. The traditional paths for
change were subverted before the
last election by our political
parties but that does not mean
that the time has come for
revolution, nor does it mean that
power politics by the intellectuals
has any hope of success. The sad
fact appears to be that the
majority of society supports the
government policy in Southeast
Asia. What we regard as immoral
action is a defect of society rather
than of Mr. Nixon.
If this be true the idea of
pressuring Nixon by closing the
universities is preposterous. The
universities provide the one ray of
hope for reorienting our country
towards mankind rather than
national "honor." To close the
university or even to seek
unanimity by coercion defeats
that goal. It also alienates the
society we must transform and
surrenders the possibility of
solution by adopting instead
self-satisfying action. We must

continue to learn and we must
continue to teach. We must be the
vanguard of the future and not
abdicate that responsibility in the
cause of futile protest which does
not serve the ends of morality as
we see it.
This is not a battle to be won
this week or this year. If "business
as usual" has i not included
political activity we may consider
ourselves delinquent. For us to
now stop business and demand an
immediate reorientation of
society is ludicrous and
irresponsible.

Times of Stress
Editor, THE DAILY:
The police-student
confrontations on campus these
last several days has demonstrated
that in times of stress, many
policemen lose their self control.
This is inexcusable. The most
common reaction to this which I
have heard is "Pigs Off Campus."
The most sensible reaction to me
is that we should demand better
training programs and higher

qualifications for policemen.
Presently wages are too low to
attract many men who would be
good public servants in the
"British Bobby" sense. I believe
that a concerted effort to upgrade
the police departments would
contribute more to building the
society we want—especially in
race or student conflicts—than
riots at night.

'Failure To Communicate'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two recent letters to the Daily,
one from Martti Vailila and a
second from Dr. Wilfred Stone
(April 29 and 30, respectively)
have brought into focus some
vague notions that have been
bothering me during the chaotic

events of the past few weeks.
Both of these writers seemed to
have been dealing (beautifully and
compassionately) with our failures
to communicate among ourselves.
We Americans are notoriously
sloppy with our language; we are
perfectly willing to use a single
almost meaningless word to
describe a vast array of
experiences (e.g., a word like
"groovy" .) I suspect that this
carelessness of expression is
having disastrous effects on the
very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned
above. It would be, I think, quite
impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their
authors) to be labelled and
catalogued by terms that are
readily available these days. A
simple effort not to use words
that have lost meaning through
overuse would carry us a long way
toward modes of communication
which match the complexity of
the issues we're trying to
understand and the problems with
which we must deal.
Anne Nicol
ROTC Humanizing
Editor, THE DAILY:
The chief asset of ROTC as
stated by its proponents is that it
somehow influses educated
civilians into the military
command structure. I have yet to
read the most obvious objection
to ROTC and its presence on this
or any other campus. That is, that
there is a better, less hypcritical,
and more appropriate method of
placing thinking people in military
command positions, i.e., the
Direct Appointment.
I will use my own personal
experiences as case in point. I was
drafted out of the Peace Corps
and shortly found myself lugging
a machine gun around and saying
"Yes Sir," "No Sir," and all the
rest. Well, I learned that it was
possible to put papers in
requesting a Commission, so, on
the off chance, I did, and one
morning a couple of months later
became an instant Lieutenant.
I had been neither outstanding
nor gung-ho to rate this
promotion, in fact I was bitter
and had a rather poor attitude
about the whole mess. The
incomprehensible wisdom it takes
to drag someone out of the Peace
Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in
than we absolutely have to. The
colleges and universities of this
country and the students,
themselves, should not have to
waste their time, resources, and
energy supporting a Mickey
Mouse and dangerous program
such as ROTC.
Mickey Mouse because much of
it is fun and games and snap
courses, dangerous because the
officers that result are poorly
trained and don't really have any
idea of what the military is all
about. Too often they see only
th«» glitter and phony class status,
without realizing that it's the guys
on the bottom that are holding
the rest up. And, believe me, the

view from the bottom is a lot
different from the view at the
middle or top.
But, the two years of service
after Army ROTC are far superior
to the three involved in OCS. To
go into Army OCS you have to be
absolutely out of your mind or
intend to become so. Nearly one
year, some 50 weeks of being
treated like a mindless, unfeeling
robot, bootlick, and toilet seat is
not conducive to a healthy mental
attitude. The men in the ranks
much preferred an ROTC officer
to an OCS graduate—they may
not know much but at least
they're human.
The Direct Appointment
requires Basic Training and some
service in the ranks. Time wise, it
requires more than ROTC (not
counting time wasted in school, of
course) and less than OCS. But,
for those of us who do not intend
to get drafted and do, it's a way
out; and, for those who think that
ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

Classroom Struggle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I attended an
in-class review session for Dr. Rolf
Eliassen's Civil Engineering 170.
After demanding that two striking
students leave the classroom, he
proceeded to say that "the real
power lies with the vote" and the
courts, and that "other methods
are ineffective." When five other
strikers entered and asked him to
talk about Cambodia and ROTC,
he screamed "No!" When they
would not leave, he turned and
said "Will some of you please get
them out?" As about ten male
students charged down the aisle,
he laughingly called to one on
crutches. "You with the crutch,
hit 'em with it!" The strikers left
the room, and there was a great
deal of shouting. I don't know
what happened outside, but I
hesitate to think what would have
happened inside had the strikers
not left.
The President of Stanford
himself called for discussion of
the issues of Cambodia and ROTC
in classes Friday. Dr. Eli;i n's
behavior demonstrated hi il
belief in the real power o the
voting processes. Such behavior
on the part of a distinguished
government environmental advisor
is unforgivable.

Moffat Support
An Open Letter to Provost
Ly man:
I should like to express my
strong support for the point of
view expressed by Robert J.
Moffat in a recent letter to the
Daily (April *28), proclaiming his
outrage at the level of violence
recently seen on the campus. I
urge you to use every means at
your disposal to identify and
prosecute as vigorously as possible
any individual who committed
any act of violence or disruption
on this campus.
I feel sorry for people like
Steve Scott (letter to the Daily,
April 28) who were duped by the
more militant activists, but he
must accept the fact that he was
clearly in violation of University
regulations, and in fact the part
people like him played (as
"non-violent" protestors) had a
very major role in encouraging
violencyon this campus. He, like
everyone else, must accept
responsibility for his acts. If he
chooses to be a pawn, he must
accept the consequences.

'Immoral Social Misifts'
Editor, THE IMILY:
I am disgusted by both the
actions and lack of action at
Stanford this quarter. Immoral
social misfits endanger our lives
and property, attempting to
justify their activities by the
questionable actions of others,
while the President of our
University takes few meaningful
deterrent steps. Not only does he
allow this lawbreaking to occur,
but he shows signs of knuckling
under to the coercion of violence
and threats.
This quarter could conceivably
be lost. Further damage and
hatred could possibly scare
Stanford's decision makers into
further obeisance, and even now,
conscientious students cannot
concentrate on matters which
would deepen their understanding
of life. The administrators of our
school have both the
responsibility and the power to
return and maintain an orderly
atmosphere for the search for
truth in all areas.
Radical leaders claim that the
only way to end lawlessness is to
"off ROTC." I contend that the
only way to end this violence, and
to both minimize and combat
similar outbreaks in the future is
to "off" those who attempt to
impose their will, regardless of
means, upon this campus. These
coercive acts are testing our moral
strength and determination to
oppose assaults upon our liberty.
President Pitzer has the power,
authority, and responsibility to
remove, through court action,
suspensions, and expulsions, this
unwanted element from our
campus. As we all known, he also
has the option of avoiding a direct
stand in the matter by shunting
his responsibility onto a
slowly-acting judicial board which
in fact derives its power from him.
The ultimate responsibility for
actions against lawbreakers is his,
and I earnestly hope that he will
respond to anarchy on our
campus in a firm, consistent,
intolerant manner. Understanding
and tolerance are not
synonymous.
I implore President Pitzer to
set an example for Stanford
students, and boldly oppose
coercion. When confronted by
criminals on campus, toss 'em
out!

Work Through System
Open Letter:
1 am a member of the Silent
Majority and am pleading with
you to hear me out. You have
proved once before that the
"system" or "establishment" can
work. You proved it in the
McCarthy campaigns of
1968—you may say that you lost
because he wasn't nominated at
the convention. That was because
you didn't control the
convention.
You say that is impossible—but
look what the Young Republicans
did at the 1961 convention—they
got Barry Goldwater nominated.
So it can be done. But now you
have an easier task. You need to
win a majority in Congress who
are in agreement with your
policies on Vietnam. Instead of
three obstacles you have only

two. You must now help the
candidates with whom you agree
(and surely thc?re must be some)
to win the June primary and then
the November election.
Concentrate on those
campaigns in which you have a
chance to win. You have wasted
too much time already—the
primary is only a month away.
Get your fellow students in other
states to work for their candidates
too. If you can put a
majority — preferably
two-thirds—in Congress against
the war the President won't have
much choice but to discontinue
his present policies.
BUT THIS IS UP TO YOU.
How much easier it is for you to
have sit-ins and demonstrations
than it is to get out and work for
your candidates. You are
supposed to be very intelligent
people or you wouldn't be
here—why don't you prove it for a
change. This summer I am going
to work foi 1 the candidates I
support—but my candidates will
be in opposition to yours. I
challenge you to work against
me—and do something
constructive for a change.

Violence Doublethink
Editor, THE DAILY:
U.S. violence in support of a
Cambodian military dictatorship
is deplorable. Violence and
intimidation against faculty and
students wishing to attend classes

those who attacked him
demonstrated a good example of
Doublethink.

Who Is To Blame?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is directed to the
Stanford faculty and
administration. During the past
few weeks we have seen our
campus torn apart by rioting
resulting in thousands of dollars in
damages. Who is to blame for this
disruption, the militant students?
Yes, to some extent. But the
faculty and administration are
responsible for solving the campus
unrest.
Yet you have failed to meet
this responsibility. You have
failed as leaders. You have failed
to see the problems and issues in
their proper perspective. You have
allowed a small number of
dissident students to lead you.
You have become part of the
problem rather than part of the
solution.
The issue at Stanford isn't
Vietnam or Cambodia. It isn't
ROTC. And it isn't DOD funding
on the campus. The principal issue
is the campus rioting.
You can not solve the problems
of the world or the country if you
can not solve the difficulties on
the campus.

ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

Classroom Struggle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I attended an
in-class review session for Dr. Rolf
Eliassen's Civil Engineering 170.
After demanding that two striking
students leave the classroom, he
proceeded to say that "the real
power lies with the vote" and the
courts, and that "other methods
are ineffective." When five other
strikers entered and asked him to
talk about Cambodia and ROTC,
he screamed "No!" When they
would not leave, he turned and
said "Will some of you please get
them out?" As about ten male
students charged down the aisle,
he laughingly called to one on
crutches. "You with the crutch,
hit 'em with it!" The strikers left
the room, and there was a great
deal of shouting. I don't know
what happened outside, but I
hesitate to think what would have
happened inside had the strikers
not left.
The President of Stanford
himself called for discussion of
the issues of Cambodia and ROTC
in classes Friday. Dr. Eli;i n's
behavior demonstrated hi il
belief in the real power o the
voting processes. Such behavior
on the part of a distinguished
government environmental advisor
is unforgivable.

Moffat Support
An Open Letter to Provost
Ly man:
I should like to express my
strong support for the point of
view expressed by Robert J.
Moffat in a recent letter to the
Daily (April *28), proclaiming his
outrage at the level of violence
recently seen on the campus. I
urge you to use every means at
your disposal to identify and
prosecute as vigorously as possible
any individual who committed
any act of violence or disruption
on this campus.
I feel sorry for people like
Steve Scott (letter to the Daily,
April 28) who were duped by the
more militant activists, but he
must accept the fact that he was
clearly in violation of University
regulations, and in fact the part
people like him played (as
"non-violent" protestors) had a
very major role in encouraging
violencyon this campus. He, like
everyone else, must accept
responsibility for his acts. If he
chooses to be a pawn, he must
accept the consequences.

'Immoral Social Misifts'
Editor, THE IMILY:
I am disgusted by both the
actions and lack of action at
Stanford this quarter. Immoral
social misfits endanger our lives
and property, attempting to
justify their activities by the
questionable actions of others,
while the President of our
University takes few meaningful
deterrent steps. Not only does he
allow this lawbreaking to occur,
but he shows signs of knuckling
under to the coercion of violence
and threats.
This quarter could conceivably
be lost. Further damage and
hatred could possibly scare
Stanford's decision makers into
further obeisance, and even now,
conscientious students cannot
concentrate on matters which
would deepen their understanding
of life. The administrators of our
school have both the
responsibility and the power to
return and maintain an orderly
atmosphere for the search for
truth in all areas.
Radical leaders claim that the
only way to end lawlessness is to
"off ROTC." I contend that the
only way to end this violence, and
to both minimize and combat
similar outbreaks in the future is
to "off" those who attempt to
impose their will, regardless of
means, upon this campus. These
coercive acts are testing our moral
strength and determination to
oppose assaults upon our liberty.
President Pitzer has the power,
authority, and responsibility to
remove, through court action,
suspensions, and expulsions, this
unwanted element from our
campus. As we all known, he also
has the option of avoiding a direct
stand in the matter by shunting
his responsibility onto a
slowly-acting judicial board which
in fact derives its power from him.
The ultimate responsibility for
actions against lawbreakers is his,
and I earnestly hope that he will
respond to anarchy on our
campus in a firm, consistent,
intolerant manner. Understanding
and tolerance are not
synonymous.
I implore President Pitzer to
set an example for Stanford
students, and boldly oppose
coercion. When confronted by
criminals on campus, toss 'em
out!

Work Through System
Open Letter:
1 am a member of the Silent
Majority and am pleading with
you to hear me out. You have
proved once before that the
"system" or "establishment" can
work. You proved it in the
McCarthy campaigns of
1968—you may say that you lost
because he wasn't nominated at
the convention. That was because
you didn't control the
convention.
You say that is impossible—but
look what the Young Republicans
did at the 1961 convention—they
got Barry Goldwater nominated.
So it can be done. But now you
have an easier task. You need to
win a majority in Congress who
are in agreement with your
policies on Vietnam. Instead of
three obstacles you have only

two. You must now help the
candidates with whom you agree
(and surely thc?re must be some)
to win the June primary and then
the November election.
Concentrate on those
campaigns in which you have a
chance to win. You have wasted
too much time already—the
primary is only a month away.
Get your fellow students in other
states to work for their candidates
too. If you can put a
majority — preferably
two-thirds—in Congress against
the war the President won't have
much choice but to discontinue
his present policies.
BUT THIS IS UP TO YOU.
How much easier it is for you to
have sit-ins and demonstrations
than it is to get out and work for
your candidates. You are
supposed to be very intelligent
people or you wouldn't be
here—why don't you prove it for a
change. This summer I am going
to work foi 1 the candidates I
support—but my candidates will
be in opposition to yours. I
challenge you to work against
me—and do something
constructive for a change.

Who Is To Blame?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter is directed to the
Stanford faculty and
administration. During the past
few weeks we have seen our
campus torn apart by rioting
resulting in thousands of dollars in
damages. Who is to blame for this
disruption, the militant students?
Yes, to some extent. But the
faculty and administration are
responsible for solving the campus
unrest.
Yet you have failed to meet
this responsibility. You have
failed as leaders. You have failed
to see the problems and issues in
their proper perspective. You have
allowed a small number of
dissident students to lead you.
You have become part of the
problem rather than part of the
solution.
The issue at Stanford isn't
Vietnam or Cambodia. It isn't
ROTC. And it isn't DOD funding
on the campus. The principal issue
is the campus rioting.
You can not solve the problems
of the world or the country if you
can not solve the difficulties on
the campus.

Republican Resolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
Members of the Stanford
Republican Club, comprised of
faculty, staff, and students, passed
the following resolution at a
meeting Sunday evening (May 3):
Whereas, the last two weeks
have witnessed the greatest
destruction of property on the
Stanford University campus in its
history, and
Whereas, the violence has
included personal injury as well as
intimidation to those who wish to
continue the pursuit of learning,
for which this University was
intended,
We urge the Stanford
University administration to act
swiftly, prcmptly, and
courageously to bring to justice
those students and non-students
who have unlawfully destroyed
property, injured persons, and
wilfully regused to recognize the
wishes of the Administration and
of the Stanford community as a
whole. As Americans, we will
defend the right of freedom of
speech within the law.
However, those who have made
a mockery of that right and
persist in trying to force
coercively their views on the
majority in illegal activities should
face the consequences of their
actions. If so many young people,
like themselves, wish the franchise
at age 18, they will convince
legislators that it should be
granted, not by looting, damaging,
or violating others rights, but
rather by proving that they can be
productive members of our
society, contributing lawfully to
the pursuit of a better life for all
Americans.
Stanford Republican Club
Behavioral Sciences
Editor, THE DrtLY:
At dawn on Friday, April 24,
1970, a calculated attempt was
made to burn to the ground the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,
California. Fires were set at four
different sites; had they all taken
hold, most of the Center would
have disappeared, along with the
lives of two college students
asleep in a caretaker's cottage.
Good fortune, timely discovery,
and expert fire-fighting prevented
the worst.
But the actuality was bad
enough: to speak only of
measurable losses, ten studies
were completely burned —one-
fifth of the total—with varying
destruction to the work of as
many Fellows. The worst losses
were suffered by a distinguished
Indian scholar; a major portion of
his anthropological field notes,
accumulated over a professional
lifetime, was destroyed.
The Center is both a place and
an idea. As a place, it sits on a
hillside, overlooking the campus
of Stanford University. It is built
on Stanford land, but has no
other connection with Stanford or
any other institution. As an idea,
it has had a vital and enduring
impact on the work of more than
700 scholars from the United
States and places in all parts of
the world who have had the
opportunity to spend a year there,
45 at a time, in independent study
and research.
Established in 1954 with the
aid of a Ford Foundation grant,
the Center has offered
Fellowships to social scientists
and bu ma nists—sociologists,
psychologists, anthropologists,
philosophers, political scientists,
students of history, of literature
and of language, to name just a
few—who are concerned, each in
his own way, with the behavior of
man and society. The Center
enables each scholar to pursue his
chosen field of study, in the
company of colleagues, without
constraints of any kind. The
Center, indeed, has come to

epitomize the free search for truth
in the study of man, the best
traditions of scholarly
community, interchange and
dialogue.
We do not know whose hands
set these fires; we do not know
whether the Center was a singular
target, or a symbolic one, or
merely a target of opportunity.
What is clear is that the
destruction at the Center took
place in an atmosphere where
physical violence, with cumulative
effects, has increasingly become
an accepted instrument of
political and social action. The
burned-out studies and charred
remains of books and papers at
the Center bear witness that the
consequences of violence are
perverse, uncontrollable, and
destructive of the life of the mind.

F ellows-In-Resldence
Opposing The Strike
What do you do when your
society takes action you regard as
immoral? In the United States
there are more options than
elsewhere and you must seek the
path most likely to correct the
defect. The traditional paths for
change were subverted before the
last election by our political
parties but that does not mean
that the time has come for
revolution, nor does it mean that
power politics by the intellectuals
has any hope of success. The sad
fact appears to be that the
majority of society supports the
government policy in Southeast
Asia. What we regard as immoral
action is a defect of society rather
than of Mr. Nixon.
If this be true the idea of
pressuring Nixon by closing the
universities is preposterous. The
universities provide the one ray of
hope for reorienting our country
towards mankind rather than
national "honor." To close the
university or even to seek
unanimity by coercion defeats
that goal. It also alienates the
society we must transform and
surrenders the possibility of
solution by adopting instead
self-satisfying action. We must

continue to learn and we must
continue to teach. We must be the
vanguard of the future and not
abdicate that responsibility in the
cause of futile protest which does
not serve the ends of morality as
we see it.
This is not a battle to be won
this week or this year. If "business
as usual" has i not included
political activity we may consider
ourselves delinquent. For us to
now stop business and demand an
immediate reorientation of
society is ludicrous and
irresponsible.

Shattered Glass
b.ditor, THE DAILY:
Something more than glass is
being shattered when a radical

minority says, in effect, "Accept
our determination of what is
moral, or we will destroy you."
The totalitarian implications,
both of mob rule and the police
state response required to
suppress it, are chilling. When one
ends, will the other remain?
If only history could spell out

Times of Stress
Editor, THE DAILY:
The police-student
confrontations on campus these
last several days has demonstrated
that in times of stress, many
policemen lose their self control.
This is inexcusable. The most
common reaction to this which I
have heard is "Pigs Off Campus."
The most sensible reaction to me
is that we should demand better
training programs and higher

qualifications for policemen.
Presently wages are too low to
attract many men who would be
good public servants in the
"British Bobby" sense. I believe
that a concerted effort to upgrade
the police departments would
contribute more to building the
society we want—especially in
race or student conflicts—than
riots at night.

'Failure To Communicate'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two recent letters to the Daily,
one from Martti Vailila and a
second from Dr. Wilfred Stone
(April 29 and 30, respectively)
have brought into focus some
vague notions that have been
bothering me during the chaotic

events of the past few weeks.
Both of these writers seemed to
have been dealing (beautifully and
compassionately) with our failures
to communicate among ourselves.
We Americans are notoriously
sloppy with our language; we are
perfectly willing to use a single
almost meaningless word to
describe a vast array of
experiences (e.g., a word like
"groovy" .) I suspect that this
carelessness of expression is
having disastrous effects on the
very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned
above. It would be, I think, quite
impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their
authors) to be labelled and
catalogued by terms that are
readily available these days. A
simple effort not to use words
that have lost meaning through
overuse would carry us a long way
toward modes of communication
which match the complexity of
the issues we're trying to
understand and the problems with
which we must deal.
Anne Nicol
ROTC Humanizing
Editor, THE DAILY:
The chief asset of ROTC as
stated by its proponents is that it
somehow influses educated
civilians into the military
command structure. I have yet to
read the most obvious objection
to ROTC and its presence on this
or any other campus. That is, that
there is a better, less hypcritical,
and more appropriate method of
placing thinking people in military
command positions, i.e., the
Direct Appointment.
I will use my own personal
experiences as case in point. I was
drafted out of the Peace Corps
and shortly found myself lugging
a machine gun around and saying
"Yes Sir," "No Sir," and all the
rest. Well, I learned that it was
possible to put papers in
requesting a Commission, so, on
the off chance, I did, and one
morning a couple of months later
became an instant Lieutenant.
I had been neither outstanding
nor gung-ho to rate this
promotion, in fact I was bitter
and had a rather poor attitude
about the whole mess. The
incomprehensible wisdom it takes
to drag someone out of the Peace
Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in
than we absolutely have to. The
colleges and universities of this
country and the students,
themselves, should not have to
waste their time, resources, and
energy supporting a Mickey
Mouse and dangerous program
such as ROTC.
Mickey Mouse because much of
it is fun and games and snap
courses, dangerous because the
officers that result are poorly
trained and don't really have any
idea of what the military is all
about. Too often they see only
th«» glitter and phony class status,
without realizing that it's the guys
on the bottom that are holding
the rest up. And, believe me, the

view from the bottom is a lot
different from the view at the
middle or top.
But, the two years of service
after Army ROTC are far superior
to the three involved in OCS. To
go into Army OCS you have to be
absolutely out of your mind or
intend to become so. Nearly one
year, some 50 weeks of being
treated like a mindless, unfeeling
robot, bootlick, and toilet seat is
not conducive to a healthy mental
attitude. The men in the ranks
much preferred an ROTC officer
to an OCS graduate—they may
not know much but at least
they're human.
The Direct Appointment
requires Basic Training and some
service in the ranks. Time wise, it
requires more than ROTC (not
counting time wasted in school, of
course) and less than OCS. But,
for those of us who do not intend
to get drafted and do, it's a way
out; and, for those who think that
ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

700 scholars from the United
States and places in all parts of
the world who have had the
opportunity to spend a year there,
45 at a time, in independent study
and research.
Established in 1954 with the
aid of a Ford Foundation grant,
the Center has offered
Fellowships to social scientists
and bu ma nists—sociologists,
psychologists, anthropologists,
philosophers, political scientists,
students of history, of literature
and of language, to name just a
few—who are concerned, each in
his own way, with the behavior of
man and society. The Center
enables each scholar to pursue his
chosen field of study, in the
company of colleagues, without
constraints of any kind. The
Center, indeed, has come to

epitomize the free search for truth
in the study of man, the best
traditions of scholarly
community, interchange and
dialogue.
We do not know whose hands
set these fires; we do not know
whether the Center was a singular
target, or a symbolic one, or
merely a target of opportunity.
What is clear is that the
destruction at the Center took
place in an atmosphere where
physical violence, with cumulative
effects, has increasingly become
an accepted instrument of
political and social action. The
burned-out studies and charred
remains of books and papers at
the Center bear witness that the
consequences of violence are
perverse, uncontrollable, and
destructive of the life of the mind.

Opposing The Strike
What do you do when your
society takes action you regard as
immoral? In the United States
there are more options than
elsewhere and you must seek the
path most likely to correct the
defect. The traditional paths for
change were subverted before the
last election by our political
parties but that does not mean
that the time has come for
revolution, nor does it mean that
power politics by the intellectuals
has any hope of success. The sad
fact appears to be that the
majority of society supports the
government policy in Southeast
Asia. What we regard as immoral
action is a defect of society rather
than of Mr. Nixon.
If this be true the idea of
pressuring Nixon by closing the
universities is preposterous. The
universities provide the one ray of
hope for reorienting our country
towards mankind rather than
national "honor." To close the
university or even to seek
unanimity by coercion defeats
that goal. It also alienates the
society we must transform and
surrenders the possibility of
solution by adopting instead
self-satisfying action. We must

continue to learn and we must
continue to teach. We must be the
vanguard of the future and not
abdicate that responsibility in the
cause of futile protest which does
not serve the ends of morality as
we see it.
This is not a battle to be won
this week or this year. If "business
as usual" has i not included
political activity we may consider
ourselves delinquent. For us to
now stop business and demand an
immediate reorientation of
society is ludicrous and
irresponsible.

Shattered Glass
b.ditor, THE DAILY:
Something more than glass is
being shattered when a radical

minority says, in effect, "Accept
our determination of what is
moral, or we will destroy you."
The totalitarian implications,
both of mob rule and the police
state response required to
suppress it, are chilling. When one
ends, will the other remain?
If only history could spell out
its lessons in slogans . . .

Times of Stress
Editor, THE DAILY:
The police-student
confrontations on campus these
last several days has demonstrated
that in times of stress, many
policemen lose their self control.
This is inexcusable. The most
common reaction to this which I
have heard is "Pigs Off Campus."
The most sensible reaction to me
is that we should demand better
training programs and higher

qualifications for policemen.
Presently wages are too low to
attract many men who would be
good public servants in the
"British Bobby" sense. I believe
that a concerted effort to upgrade
the police departments would
contribute more to building the
society we want—especially in
race or student conflicts—than
riots at night.

'Failure To Communicate'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two recent letters to the Daily,
one from Martti Vailila and a
second from Dr. Wilfred Stone
(April 29 and 30, respectively)
have brought into focus some
vague notions that have been
bothering me during the chaotic

events of the past few weeks.
Both of these writers seemed to
have been dealing (beautifully and
compassionately) with our failures
to communicate among ourselves.
We Americans are notoriously
sloppy with our language; we are
perfectly willing to use a single
almost meaningless word to
describe a vast array of
experiences (e.g., a word like
"groovy" .) I suspect that this
carelessness of expression is
having disastrous effects on the
very ways that we think about
what's happening around us.
There may be a definite
parallelism between the language
we use and the kinds of mental
structures we have available for
understanding and
conceptualizing experiences.
When we do not make linguistic
distinctions among various
phenomena, we are less likely to
conceptualize them differently.
Simplistic language leads to
simplistic thinking.
A good beginning towards the
goal of achieving communication
among polarized sections of the
campus would be the appearance
and discussion of more letters and
articles like the two mentioned
above. It would be, I think, quite
impossible for either of these
letters (or, consequently their
authors) to be labelled and
catalogued by terms that are
readily available these days. A
simple effort not to use words
that have lost meaning through
overuse would carry us a long way
toward modes of communication
which match the complexity of
the issues we're trying to
understand and the problems with
which we must deal.

ROTC Humanizing
Editor, THE DAILY:
The chief asset of ROTC as
stated by its proponents is that it
somehow influses educated
civilians into the military
command structure. I have yet to
read the most obvious objection
to ROTC and its presence on this
or any other campus. That is, that
there is a better, less hypcritical,
and more appropriate method of
placing thinking people in military
command positions, i.e., the
Direct Appointment.
I will use my own personal
experiences as case in point. I was
drafted out of the Peace Corps
and shortly found myself lugging
a machine gun around and saying
"Yes Sir," "No Sir," and all the
rest. Well, I learned that it was
possible to put papers in
requesting a Commission, so, on
the off chance, I did, and one
morning a couple of months later
became an instant Lieutenant.
I had been neither outstanding
nor gung-ho to rate this
promotion, in fact I was bitter
and had a rather poor attitude
about the whole mess. The
incomprehensible wisdom it takes
to drag someone out of the Peace
Corps to put them in the Army
weighed heavy on me. But the
fact was they needed engineer
officers (my BA was in
Architecture) so I was given a
commission. The point is, that it
happens, you can become an
officer without ROTC or OCS.
ROTC can be eliminated.
The advantages of the Direct
Appointments are several, but
stem mostly from the
disadvantages of ROTC and OCS.
The time factor is one
consideration. Most of us don't
want to spend any more time in
than we absolutely have to. The
colleges and universities of this
country and the students,
themselves, should not have to
waste their time, resources, and
energy supporting a Mickey
Mouse and dangerous program
such as ROTC.
Mickey Mouse because much of
it is fun and games and snap
courses, dangerous because the
officers that result are poorly
trained and don't really have any
idea of what the military is all
about. Too often they see only
th«» glitter and phony class status,
without realizing that it's the guys
on the bottom that are holding
the rest up. And, believe me, the

view from the bottom is a lot
different from the view at the
middle or top.
But, the two years of service
after Army ROTC are far superior
to the three involved in OCS. To
go into Army OCS you have to be
absolutely out of your mind or
intend to become so. Nearly one
year, some 50 weeks of being
treated like a mindless, unfeeling
robot, bootlick, and toilet seat is
not conducive to a healthy mental
attitude. The men in the ranks
much preferred an ROTC officer
to an OCS graduate—they may
not know much but at least
they're human.
The Direct Appointment
requires Basic Training and some
service in the ranks. Time wise, it
requires more than ROTC (not
counting time wasted in school, of
course) and less than OCS. But,
for those of us who do not intend
to get drafted and do, it's a way
out; and, for those who think that
ROTC is an anachronism on a
university campus, it's an
alternative. I, personally, don't
believe that there is any good way
to turn a man into a military
machine, but, if it must be, this
Direct Appointment seems to be
the method closest to a happy
medium between the controversy
and ineptness of ROTC and the
gung-ho and inhumanity of OCS.
The ultimate solution, of
course, is for all of us to have the
courage of men like Dave Harris
and flatly refuse to do that which
we know is wrong.

Classroom Struggle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I attended an
in-class review session for Dr. Rolf
Eliassen's Civil Engineering 170.
After demanding that two striking
students leave the classroom, he
proceeded to say that "the real
power lies with the vote" and the
courts, and that "other methods
are ineffective." When five other
strikers entered and asked him to
talk about Cambodia and ROTC,
he screamed "No!" When they
would not leave, he turned and
said "Will some of you please get
them out?" As about ten male
students charged down the aisle,
he laughingly called to one on
crutches. "You with the crutch,
hit 'em with it!" The strikers left
the room, and there was a great
deal of shouting. I don't know
what happened outside, but I
hesitate to think what would have
happened inside had the strikers
not left.
The President of Stanford
himself called for discussion of
the issues of Cambodia and ROTC
in classes Friday. Dr. Eli;i n's
behavior demonstrated hi il
belief in the real power o the
voting processes. Such behavior
on the part of a distinguished
government environmental advisor
is unforgivable.

Moffat Support
An Open Letter to Provost
Ly man:
I should like to express my
strong support for the point of
view expressed by Robert J.
Moffat in a recent letter to the
Daily (April *28), proclaiming his
outrage at the level of violence
recently seen on the campus. I
urge you to use every means at
your disposal to identify and
prosecute as vigorously as possible
any individual who committed
any act of violence or disruption
on this campus.
I feel sorry for people like
Steve Scott (letter to the Daily,
April 28) who were duped by the
more militant activists, but he
must accept the fact that he was
clearly in violation of University
regulations, and in fact the part
people like him played (as
"non-violent" protestors) had a
very major role in encouraging
violencyon this campus. He, like
everyone else, must accept
responsibility for his acts. If he
chooses to be a pawn, he must
accept the consequences.
