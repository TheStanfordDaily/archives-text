# Ode to the War Dead

### 
The SHOT RANG OUT-piercing,
) splintering bones and flesh; I
i Life had left—today. (
1 Life—that proteineous, bone marrow force. )
But Spirit was there—hovering over, )
moving, looking for a new (
i place to spring up—in the (
bone marrow, bloodstream force j
of man. /
Spirit—neither created nor destroyed but limitless, (
boundless—ever ready to spring (
j up into YOU and ME. j
ANOTHER SHOT and another will ring out with that )
I vast vanity of greed; pretentious
I stature of finite man's mind— (
bone marrow, proteineous being— |
( Ne'er acknowledging the vastness of you 0 Spirit
| of whom our substance is really |
made—indestructible force
which will mock the last shot
of the last finite man.
