## Impressions Of The New Cuba 
### John Spiegel 
Six weeks of cane cutting and two weeks of touring have somehow
slipped by; today we are packing to leave on the boat tomorrow for
Canada. , . . , ~
I am foolish enough to try to write something about the
experiences I have had living in a Cuban cane camp with 700 hundred
other American radicals. A cryptic line in my notebook, written the
third day in camp, says all there is to say: "All one needs to
appreciate life is a good case of dysentery." Yet I have written many
pages since then, and have many more unwritten in my head —
recollections of evenings filled with documentaries on Vietnam, with
fiestas mixing Aretha Franklin and Cuban drums, and with panel
discussions on universities and the military or U.S. policy toward
Latin America.
Of course I will never forget the days either which left me on many
of those evenings sould asleep in my work clothes right after dinner.
Six weeks of days, in which we steadily cleared the fields in every
direction until now we can see the sugar mill a mile away across the
level ground.
There were ups and downs in those days, times when we left half an
hour early in the morning and stayed late to pile, and other times
when "merienda" (the snack in the middle of each work shift) lasted
forty minutes as we hid out from the sun and chatted. However, we
reached our goal of three million arrobas of cane cut (75 million
pounds), in a little under six weeks, and suddenly we were eating
dinner at the Havana Libre (Nee Havana Hilton) and looking forward
to two weeks of soft living.
Local Life
We were delighted at being able to see more of Cuba than the small
area to which we had been limited during the work; at the same time,
I think we may have learned more about the country and its
revolution from our life in the camp and exposure to the surrounding
area.
As in many areas of Cuba, life in our part of Habana province
revolved around sugar production which in turn centered around the
mill appropriately called the "Central." The camp was one of several
located around the Central Reuben Martinez Villenas, a sugar mill
formerly the property of Hershey Company, then of Cuban
millionaire Julio Lobos, and now of the Cuban people; it now bears
the name of one of the martyrs in the struggle for independence.
Built in mid-nineteenth century, it was rebuilt around 1910 and has
had no major overhaul since. It appeared extremely complicated, a
maze of huge gears, conveyor belts, pipes, and tanks which somehow
have produced the mountain of sugar crystals in the warehouse (a
seven thousand metric ton mountain.)
American History
Evidences of the former owners are everywhere: Trumbull Electric
Company has contributed its "buildog" safety switches, and in fact
every electric fixture runs on 110 volt A.C. Across the road from the
mill was the villa of the former American manager; weeds were
growing in the garden and no-one lives there now. Several rooms of
large office of the mill are no longer used. When I dropped in one
evening there were only two administrators in building; the wife of
one was also there with a child who was receiving more attention than
the books of production statistics on the desks.
A chart on the wall diagrammed the "rendimientos", or pounds of
sugar obtained from 100 pounds of cane; despite the addition of new

equipment, the mill was still one of the lowest in sugar yield in the
province, (a fact which Fidel did not hesitate to point out to us, when
he visited the camp.)
The Nightly Roar
The mill itself made a formidable impression, especially at night,
when the roar of the grinding, pounding machinery combined with
the garish illumination of bare light bulbs to produce an image ot the
life of the mill workers before the Revolution not far from that ot
the European proletariat in the horrible years of the nineteenth
century.
Now many changes had taken place in the lives of the workers,
although many still lived in the old shabby wooden barracks next to
the mill — a painful reminder of the old company town. But now
there is a nursery school in the barracks, and a brand new primary
school down the road. The workers are paid between a hundred fifty
and two hundred pesos a month, and some of the worst-housed
families have moved into new concrete houses and apartments.
But the lives of the workers are still hard, and the Revolution has
much to do. Two teenagers who are working ten hours a day, six days
a week, and studying at night to become locomotive engineers,
admitted that many of the older workers have not been able to adjust
to the changes the Revolution has made in their lives.
A New Factory
Up the railroad tracks a bit is a Cuban addition to the sugar
grinding process: the cane conditioning center, which separates out
leaves from cane stalks and thus eliminates the need for the cutters to
clean the cane as they cut it. The center is manned by a brigade of
voluntary workers from the Cuban Petroleum Institute who are in the
cane for the entire harvest while receiving the same salary as at their
regular office work.
I spoke with one of the workers at lunchtime (noticing with pride
that they were eating the same food as we were getting in the camp);
he was incidentally, one of the few Cubans I saw with long hair. He
told me that since he was from a very poor family he not been able to
go to school, but that after the Revolution he had gone to mechanic s
school,for two years and now took care of the vehicles at the
Petroleum Institute.
I was going to pose my standard auestion, "What do you think of
the Revolution?", but the answer was so obvious that the question
would have seemed ridiculous; and so I just listened to him explain
how important it was for his little daughter to learn about the
revolutionary struggle in school in order that she be as dedicated to
building a new Cuba as his generation which had lived through the
fight.
Leaving the mill, it seemed impossible not to feel great respect for
the Cuban workers struggling to add their small part of the ten million
ton harvest. Some of them working ten-hour night shifts, others
putting in seven-day weeks and studying at night as well, still others
perhaps a little reluctantly spending their last able years bent over
cauldrons of boiling sugar solution — a great change had taken place in
their lives.
They were still working very hard, eating rationed food, and maybe
living in the same shack, but they felt they were working for the
people, to bring their country out of underdevelopment.
