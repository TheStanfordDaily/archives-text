# Response To Cambodia
## Some Comments On Nixon Letters To The Editor 
### 
Dilemma Solved
Editor, THE DAILY:
Thank you Mr. President. You
have enabled me to resolve a
moral dilemma. As sole provider
for six persons, I have, these past
several years, been loath to risk
my livelihood by assuming my
obligations as a concerned citizen,
in helping our country through a
time of grave crisis.
Your decision to further your
declared goal of lessening the
American commitment in
Southeast Asia by increasing the
American commitment in
Southeast Asia, has made
apparent the fact that my real
duties, to family and country, are
not contradictory but are truly
one and the same.
From this time on I shall have
no qualms about any act, on my
part, including non-violent civil
disobedience, that will frustrate
you, and your administration, in
your ill-advised ventures.

An 'Age Old Argument'
In attempting to justify the
invasion of Cambodia, Nixon used
the age old argument that the men
there are fighting so that their
younger brothers and sons would
not have to. He claimed they are
"fighting for freedom." The
fallacy of this argument has been
adequately demonstrated by the
wars and growth of the military
industrial establishment since WW
II (the war to end wars?). In order
to overcome Fascism, the U.S.
became more centralized and
trained more citizens in military
technique. In short, the U.S.
became more fascist and the
means lead to unexpected ends.
Our necessity to become
involved in WW II was created by
a lack of appropriate measures
before the war. Similarly, the
likelihood of WW 111 is increased
by our efforts to insure against it.
Each country which arms itself
(just in case . . . ) arouses fear in

rival nations. The vicious cycle
leads to development of deterrent
weapons or preventive wars and
therefore to war instead of peace.
People say that a war in
Cambodia is illegal. This implies
that there is a law, but the nature
of law is that there is a power to
enforce it. The logical
requirement for World law is a
World Authority, i.e., World
Government. With a world
government, countries which now
waste much human energy in war
preparation could work instead to
improve the quality of life.
The advantages of such a
system are manifest, and in this
light—U.S. military activity in
Indochina is further polarizing
nations at a time when they must
join together. The price of WW 111
is the price of nuclear war. The
reasonable course of actions is to
begin in the United Nations to
build the international links to
forge a world government.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The Republican National
Committee organized a massive
chain letter-writing campaign in
support of Nixon's unauthorized
invasion of Cambodia. As a result,
the first large influx of mail to
Congress favored Nixon's action 8
to 1. We, the Stanford
Community, can use the same
tactic to protest the expansion of
U.S. involvement in Indochina.
Ask your parents to join you in
public protest by encouraging five
of their friends (especially
influential and respected
community leaders) first to write
their Congressmen and second to
contact five of their own friends.
Each of their friends will in turn
write Congress and contact five
more people. Think of the
numbers we can reach if the chain
holds!
Even if your parents (and their
friends) do not agree completely

with your position against the
war, you can probably find
certain areas of agreement, e.g.,
that President Nixon's order to
invade Cambodia is
unconstitutional because he did
not seek the approval of Congress.
Encourage your parents to make
the strongest protest they can.
Tell your parents that Senator
George McGovern has appealed to
the Stanford community for
support of his amendment to the
Military Authorization bill which
will, in effect, force every Senator
and Representative to vote for or
against continued funding of the
war.
Let's encourage some of the
"silent majority" to voice their
real doubts about the wisdom of a
continued war in Southeast Asia.

We said, "The government
knows best" when a few hundred
American advisers were sent to
Vietnam years ago. We hardly
paid any attention when a few
thousand American troops were
sent to protect the advisers and
their equipment. "We can't let our
allies down," we said, when
several thousand more troops
were sent.
Today the billions we are
spending in Vietnam have caused
skyrocketing inflation at home.
41,000 of our men are dead and
nearly 300,000 wounded, in a war
we should never have entered.
And the casualties continue to
mount, day by day.
In 1968 President Nixon
pledged, "The time to end the war
is now." But the war has

continued. And now he has
expanded that war at the very
time he claims to be "winding it
down."
Although the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee voted
unanimously last week against
sending military aid to Cambodia,
the President has ordered a full
scale invasion, using American
equipment, American pilots,
and—once again—American
"advisers." It is no longer the
Vietnam War but the War for
Indochina.
President Nixon said the
invasion was "to save free world
lives," but there is no sensible
explanation as to why Americans
must be involved at all in a land of
such ancient and complex
rivalries. Yet among Peninsula
high school graduating classes this
June there are young men who
may be destined to die next year
in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.
We must demand an end to the
killing. We must demonstrate to
the President that we will not
stand for a continuation of the
War for Indochina. The Peninsula
Vietnam Moratorium urges you to
send a public service telegram
NOW protesting our deepening
involvement in this war. Send
your wire (or letter or postcard)

Dilemma Solved
Editor, THE DAILY:
Thank you Mr. President. You
have enabled me to resolve a
moral dilemma. As sole provider
for six persons, I have, these past
several years, been loath to risk
my livelihood by assuming my
obligations as a concerned citizen,
in helping our country through a
time of grave crisis.
Your decision to further your
declared goal of lessening the
American commitment in
Southeast Asia by increasing the
American commitment in
Southeast Asia, has made
apparent the fact that my real
duties, to family and country, are
not contradictory but are truly
one and the same.
From this time on I shall have
no qualms about any act, on my
part, including non-violent civil
disobedience, that will frustrate
you, and your administration, in
your ill-advised ventures.

An 'Age Old Argument'
In attempting to justify the
invasion of Cambodia, Nixon used
the age old argument that the men
there are fighting so that their
younger brothers and sons would
not have to. He claimed they are
"fighting for freedom." The
fallacy of this argument has been
adequately demonstrated by the
wars and growth of the military
industrial establishment since WW
II (the war to end wars?). In order
to overcome Fascism, the U.S.
became more centralized and
trained more citizens in military
technique. In short, the U.S.
became more fascist and the
means lead to unexpected ends.
Our necessity to become
involved in WW II was created by
a lack of appropriate measures
before the war. Similarly, the
likelihood of WW 111 is increased
by our efforts to insure against it.
Each country which arms itself
(just in case . . . ) arouses fear in

rival nations. The vicious cycle
leads to development of deterrent
weapons or preventive wars and
therefore to war instead of peace.
People say that a war in
Cambodia is illegal. This implies
that there is a law, but the nature
of law is that there is a power to
enforce it. The logical
requirement for World law is a
World Authority, i.e., World
Government. With a world
government, countries which now
waste much human energy in war
preparation could work instead to
improve the quality of life.
The advantages of such a
system are manifest, and in this
light—U.S. military activity in
Indochina is further polarizing
nations at a time when they must
join together. The price of WW 111
is the price of nuclear war. The
reasonable course of actions is to
begin in the United Nations to
build the international links to
forge a world government.

The Republican National

support of Nixon's unauthorized

the first large influx of mail to
Congress favored Nixon's action 8

U.S. involvement in Indochina.
Ask your parents to join you in
public protest by encouraging five
of their friends (especially
influential and respected
community leaders) first to write
their Congressmen and second to
contact five of their own friends.
Each of their friends will in turn
write Congress and contact five
more people. Think of the
numbers we can reach if the chain
holds!
Even if your parents (and their
friends) do not agree completely

with your position against the
war, you can probably find
certain areas of agreement, e.g.,
that President Nixon's order to
invade Cambodia is
unconstitutional because he did
not seek the approval of Congress.
Encourage your parents to make

We said, "The government

Vietnam years ago. We hardly
paid any attention when a few
thousand American troops were
sent to protect the advisers and
their equipment. "We can't let our

several thousand more troops
were sent.
Today the billions we are
spending in Vietnam have caused
skyrocketing inflation at home.
41,000 of our men are dead and
nearly 300,000 wounded, in a war
we should never have entered.
And the casualties continue to
mount, day by day.
In 1968 President Nixon
pledged, "The time to end the war

continued. And now he has
expanded that war at the very

Although the Senate Foreign

sending military aid to Cambodia,
the President has ordered a full
scale invasion, using American
equipment, American pilots,
and—once again—American
"advisers." It is no longer the
Vietnam War but the War for
Indochina.
President Nixon said the
invasion was "to save free world
lives," but there is no sensible
explanation as to why Americans
must be involved at all in a land of
such ancient and complex
rivalries. Yet among Peninsula

scale invasion, using American
equipment, American pilots,
and—once again—American
"advisers." It is no longer the
Vietnam War but the War for
Indochina.
President Nixon said the
invasion was "to save free world
lives," but there is no sensible
explanation as to why Americans
must be involved at all in a land of
such ancient and complex
rivalries. Yet among Peninsula
high school graduating classes this
June there are young men who
may be destined to die next year
in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.
We must demand an end to the

the President that we will not
stand for a continuation of the
War for Indochina. The Peninsula

send a public service telegram
NOW protesting our deepening

Dilemma Solved
Editor, THE DAILY:
Thank you Mr. President. You
have enabled me to resolve a
moral dilemma. As sole provider
for six persons, I have, these past
several years, been loath to risk
my livelihood by assuming my
obligations as a concerned citizen,
in helping our country through a
time of grave crisis.
Your decision to further your
declared goal of lessening the
American commitment in
Southeast Asia by increasing the
American commitment in
Southeast Asia, has made
apparent the fact that my real
duties, to family and country, are
not contradictory but are truly
one and the same.
From this time on I shall have
no qualms about any act, on my
part, including non-violent civil
disobedience, that will frustrate
you, and your administration, in
your ill-advised ventures.

An 'Age Old Argument'
In attempting to justify the
invasion of Cambodia, Nixon used
the age old argument that the men
there are fighting so that their
younger brothers and sons would
not have to. He claimed they are
"fighting for freedom." The
fallacy of this argument has been
adequately demonstrated by the
wars and growth of the military
industrial establishment since WW
II (the war to end wars?). In order
to overcome Fascism, the U.S.
became more centralized and
trained more citizens in military
technique. In short, the U.S.
became more fascist and the
means lead to unexpected ends.
Our necessity to become
involved in WW II was created by
a lack of appropriate measures
before the war. Similarly, the
likelihood of WW 111 is increased
by our efforts to insure against it.
Each country which arms itself
(just in case . . . ) arouses fear in

rival nations. The vicious cycle
leads to development of deterrent
weapons or preventive wars and
therefore to war instead of peace.
People say that a war in
Cambodia is illegal. This implies
that there is a law, but the nature
of law is that there is a power to
enforce it. The logical
requirement for World law is a
World Authority, i.e., World
Government. With a world
government, countries which now
waste much human energy in war
preparation could work instead to
improve the quality of life.
The advantages of such a
system are manifest, and in this
light—U.S. military activity in
Indochina is further polarizing
nations at a time when they must
join together. The price of WW 111
is the price of nuclear war. The
reasonable course of actions is to
begin in the United Nations to
build the international links to
forge a world government.

Chain Letters
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Republican National
Committee organized a massive
chain letter-writing campaign in
support of Nixon's unauthorized
invasion of Cambodia. As a result,
the first large influx of mail to
Congress favored Nixon's action 8
to 1. We, the Stanford
Community, can use the same
tactic to protest the expansion of
U.S. involvement in Indochina.
Ask your parents to join you in
public protest by encouraging five
of their friends (especially
influential and respected
community leaders) first to write
their Congressmen and second to
contact five of their own friends.
Each of their friends will in turn
write Congress and contact five
more people. Think of the
numbers we can reach if the chain
holds!
Even if your parents (and their
friends) do not agree completely

with your position against the
war, you can probably find
certain areas of agreement, e.g.,
that President Nixon's order to
invade Cambodia is
unconstitutional because he did
not seek the approval of Congress.
Encourage your parents to make
the strongest protest they can.
Tell your parents that Senator
George McGovern has appealed to
the Stanford community for
support of his amendment to the
Military Authorization bill which
will, in effect, force every Senator
and Representative to vote for or
against continued funding of the
war.
Let's encourage some of the
"silent majority" to voice their
real doubts about the wisdom of a
continued war in Southeast Asia.

We said, "The government
knows best" when a few hundred
American advisers were sent to
Vietnam years ago. We hardly
paid any attention when a few
thousand American troops were
sent to protect the advisers and
their equipment. "We can't let our
allies down," we said, when
several thousand more troops
were sent.
Today the billions we are
spending in Vietnam have caused
skyrocketing inflation at home.
41,000 of our men are dead and
nearly 300,000 wounded, in a war
we should never have entered.
And the casualties continue to
mount, day by day.
In 1968 President Nixon
pledged, "The time to end the war
is now." But the war has

continued. And now he has
expanded that war at the very
time he claims to be "winding it
down."
Although the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee voted
unanimously last week against
sending military aid to Cambodia,
the President has ordered a full
