Police clashod with
demonstrators repeatedly on the
Berkeley campus yesterday as
80% of the students boycotted
classes.
The fighting came as
Chancellor Heyns refused to
suspend classes tomorrow. A
convocation is scheduled for 10
a.m. tomorrow, sponsored by the
Academic Senate and the
Associated Students of U.C.
A noon rally in Sproul Plaza
drew 5,000 demonstrators before
turning into an impromptu march
on Callaghan Hall, the Naval
ROTC building. The crowd was
turned back by a handful of
police with tear gas.
It then moved to Le Conte
Hall, center of the physics
department. A squad of California
Highway Patrolmen charged the
crowd, now numbering 1,000.
They were surrounded by
students and pelted with rocks. A
number of the patrolmen put
their hands on their guns, but
were dissauded from drawing
them by reporters yelling, "take
that hand off the gun."
They retreated into the
building, and a group of thirty
Alameda County Sheriff's
deputies arrived, using tear gas in
an attempt to disperse the crowd.
They, too, fled into the building,
and the crowd moved back into
Sproul Plaza.
The campus was then
enveloped in tear gas, at times so
thick that visibility was cut to a
few feet. Confrontations between
the police and demonstrators
continued in sporadic episodes
across the central campus.
