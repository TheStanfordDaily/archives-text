# Varied Moods Mark Campus Strike

### LAURIE HORN 
What's the mood on campus?
By 6 a.m., in Soto Lounge, the
strike still seemed as placid as
sugar doughnuts and scrambled
eggs.
"I finally found out what I was
doing wrong in Hebrew," said one
student cheerfully as she sipped
instant coffee. "Now," she
continued, "I can't take the
midterm."
"It's my second cut in
lifesaving," stated another. "That
makes the third time I'm going to
flunk SLS."
The strikers ambling toward
Encina yesterday could have been
in the bleachers at the San
Jose-Stanford football game. At
worst, they felt hope. At wildest,
joy. The difference between the
stadium and Encina, though, was
that one was a place to "win," the

other a place to be "together."
Even as five "disruptive" students
ramrodded against the front
doors, fifteen "non -coercive"
strikers smiled amicably in front.
'Letting People In?'
"It's together today," someone
said. "There are no hassles."
(Monday, conflicts had broken
out between those who wanted to
let workers in and those who
didn't.)
"Are you letting people in?"
questioned a new arrival.
"No," thundered the twenty
sitting in front of the door.
"Wow, I bless you all," he
answered, pivoting on one heel.
"Yesterday we came over here
and there were all these people
letting people in."
As clear alto voices sent out a
rain of good feeling, an Encina

employee munched calmly on her
doughnut.
"I really respect that you cared
enough to get up this early," she
said.
Yesterday, the persuasive side
of "shut-it-down" really worked.
Stanford Unity
Many students on campus used
their sitting time to talk about the
ethnic of non-violence.
"I'm finally discovering what
it's all about," said a student
striking in front of Hoover Tower.
"I mean, all these people come up
and say 'You're using force.'Then
you start a conversation with
them, and right away you're not
using force anymore .. . One
guy —he's sitting on the steps
now —was sent to Siberia in the
1930'5. He was telling us about
prison camps . . . has been there
all afternoon."

All over campus students were
amazed at the amount of talking
they were able to do.
"If it weren't for the strike,
there wouldn't be any
communication .. . It's amazing
how much I've learned about the
Hoover Institute.
Towards midday, it became
increasingly clear that channels of
communication were opening, and
that Stanford was feeling its unity
as a community for the first time
in years. Concern began to grow
about the direction that the strike
would now take.
Preserve Good Feeling
"I feel it's going well and I sure
hope it's nonviolent, but it's got
to get out into the community,"
said one.
"We're forgetting that the issue
isn't just the strike itself," said
another .. . "we have to start

thinking about the world."
Most students think that the
"build-it-up" end of the strike
needs far more emphasis ... and
organization.
The major question in
everybody's mind, though, is how
and when the administration will
respond. The consensus is that the
University must respond
positively .. . that it must take
drastic and radical action to
preserve the unity and good
feeling generated by the strike:
"I think it's important that we
redefine what the University is,"
said a chemical engineer on strike
at the Engineering corner. "Some
people say that we're killing the
University. By their definition I
think perhaps that's true . . . but 1
think we need a new definition to
meet this crisis. I'd like to find
out what the University can be."
