# Med Students Urged To Take Stands
## 
### 
Doctors must take a serious
interest in political and social
questions—including the Vietnam
war—because their lives are
increasingly in danger of
becoming "a mere mockery," a
noted Stanford University cancer
researcher said Monday night.
Speaking before a convocation
of 1,000 persons in the Stanford
Medical School courtyard, Dr.
Henry S. Kaplan cited what he
termed "the ultimate irony of the
position of the physician
today—more people killed in
Vietnam in one week than he
would hope to cure in a lifetime."
Dr. Kaplan, chairman of the
Department of Radiology,
reminded his audience that the
five-year survival rate for patients
with Hodgkin's disease has been
raised from 12 percent to 73
percent over the last 40 years.
"In another era that would
have been the most heartening
achievement," Dr. Kaplan
commented. "A man would have
been proud of it and feel a sense
of accomplishment.
"And yet today I am
confronted with the irony that
more people are being killed in
Vietnam in a week that I can ever
hope to save in a lifetime."
Population Explosion
"Today the population
explosion is upon us," he added.
"We as doctors who are concerned
about saving lives are increasingly
being forced to wonder whether
our actions in so doing are not
actually anti-social. This is an
ironic twist, indeed."
He said that many physicians
are facing with an increasing sense
of despair the knowledge that in
ghettos there are health problems,
poor sanitation, malnutrition, and
other social conditions.
"These problems are preventing
even the most rudimentary
application of things we knew
about medicine 25 years ago," Dr.
Kaplan said.
Irrelevance
He continued: "These are a fe*"
of the reasons why I feel a sense
of irrelevance—a sense that we as
physicians are not able to

contribute through our life's work
that which we had hoped to
contribute.
"We feel increasingly that our
entire lives are being made
meaningless by all that is
transpiring around us and it is for
this reason that physicians,
medical students, and staff must
take a serious, continuing, and
meaningful interest in political
and social questions in the world
that surrounds us.
"Because without political
involvement on our part, our
entire lives today are increasingly
in danger of becoming a mere
mockery."
Policies Condemned
Dr. Kaplan's talk was preceded
by other speakers who
condemned the Vietnam war and
the government policy to expand
the war into Cambodia.
Dr. Robert B. Textor, professor
of education and anthropology,
who lived in Southeast Asia for
several years, said that he "sees no
reason for President Nixon's
gamble to succeed."
Citing that four years ago, on
May 4, he held his first Stanford
"teach-in" on Vietnam, Dr.
Textor explained: "At that point
we thought we could win. There
was light at the end of the tunnel.
The years went by, the bombs
were dropped, and today there is
no more hope of winning a
military solution than there was
then."
General Strike
Later in the evening, an ad hoc
group of students, faculty and
others passed a resolution to work
for a general strike to emphasize
their concern over events in
Southeast Asia.
In addition, the resolution
called for educational efforts to
reach the public and government
for the purpose of changing U.S.
policy in Southeast Asia. The
statement said that Medical
School activities related to the
care of patients or those
considered necessary by each
individual will not be affected.
Tuesday's classes in the Medical
School were held as usual, with 25
percent attendance.
