# Vietnam Is No 'Mistake'
## The 						Economic Causes of the War 
### Jim Shoch Pacific Studies Center 
In a statement issued on March 11, 1969, the
Stanford Board of Trustees outlined its position on
ROTC. The resolution said
ROTC is vital to the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military services, and it is of
crucial importance that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their strength to the task
. . . this board of trustees urges the president of
the university to continue his consulting with the
Department of Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and vitalize this pro
gram.
Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United
States has emerged as the world's dominant eco
nomic power. Accompanying this growth has been
a concentration and centralisation of capital. In
1947, the 200 largest industrial firms controlled 33
per cent of the nation's industrial assets; by 1965
the top 200 corporations controlled 55 per cent of
the assets.
In recent years, in order to keep production and
profits up, these great firms have been forced to
scour the globe in search of vital raw materials,
markets, and outlets for investment capital. Amer
ican business has gone "multinational." U.S. private
foreign investment jumped from $7.2 billion in
1946 to $65 billion by the end of 1968. Investment
banker Leo Model noted in Foreign Affairs in July,
1967, that
The role of U.S. direct investment in the world
economy is staggering. According to the U.S.
Council of the International Chamber of Com
merce, the gross value of production by Ameri
can companies abroad is well in excess of $100
billion a year. That is to say, on the basis of the
gross value of their output, U.S. enterprises
abroad in the aggregate comprise the third
largest country (if such a term can be used to
designate these companies) in the world — with
a gross product greater than any country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.
stake abroad, then, is substantial. U.S. foreign
policy is designed to defend and extend these busi
ness interests.
U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of
campaign funding and their positions on quasi
public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In
cluded are investment guarantees against losses due
to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme
diate and future export markets. Foreign aid is also
used to build part of the infrastructure — roads,
ports, power stations, etc. — needed by foreign in
vestors. In addition, foreign aid is designed to orient
the economies of the recipient countries toward cap
italist "free enterprise" which will welcome foreign
(especially American) investment. As Secretary of
State Dean Rusk (formerly head of the Rockefeller
Foundation) explained in 1962, the U.S. govern
ment wants underdeveloped nations
to create conditions which will be attractive to
the international investor, the private investor.
So our influence is used whenever it can be and
persistently, through our Embassies on a day-to
day basis, in our aid discussions and in direct
aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng
ed by national reformist and revolutionary move
ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right
wing government, no matter bow reactionary. The
so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and
capital.
Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain
power and begin to threaten U.S. business interests
by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern
ment can respond in several ways. It can cut off aid
via the Hickenlooper Amendment. Or it can sus
pend import quotas — as was done with Cuban
sugar in 1961. Or it can try to subvert the govern
ment in question. This is usually the task of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
After Iran nationalized its oil in 1951, the CIA
toppled the government in 1953. Guatemala na
tionalized uncultivated United Fruit Co. land in
1952 and the CIA engineered a coup in 1954. When
American oil interests in Indonesia were threatened
in 1958, in went the CIA. When Cuba nationalized
American-owned plantations and oil refineries in
1959 and 1960, the CIA trained Cuban exiles for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. When American copper
and cobalt interests were endangered in the Congo
in 1961, the CIA helped engineer a Tightest coup.
When a self-proclaimed Marxist seemed certain to
be re-elected president in British Guiana in 1963,
the CIA prevented this by working through the
AFL-CIO and Guianian labor unions. Although
there is no concrete proof, it seems likely that the
CIA engineering the overthrow of the anti-imperial
ist Sukarno regime in Indonesia in 1965. And no one
would be surprised to find that the CIA planned the
recent coup in Cambodia.
When American business interests are threatened
by revolutionary movements, the U.S. government
can send arms and advisors to help the local govern
ments repress the insurgency. If this proves unsuc
cessful, the Marines are landed. This occurred in
Lebandon in 1958, when 14,000 marines were sent
to ensure the safety of U.S. oil interests in the
Middle East. This step was taken to guard against
growing Arab nationalism sparked by the seizure of
power in Iraq by what seemed to be a revolutionary
military regime.
In 1965, when revolutionary forces were fighting
in the Dominican Republic to reinstall Juan Bosch
as president, fear for the safety of U.S. sugar and
other interests resulted in the landing of 24,000
troops.
The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight
Eisenhower expressed concern for the strategic
natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be
gan to bolster the regime with arms and advisors.
Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to
repress all dissident elements.
The continuing poverty and repression led to
guerrilla fighting in the countryside and the forma
tion in December, 1960, of the National Liberation
front (NLF). As the NLF grew in strength in the
early sixties, President Kennedy stepped up the
How of U.S. arms and "advisors" who increasingly
joined South Vietnamese troops in combat opera
tions. By 1964, 16,000 U.S. troops were stationed
in South Vietnam.
Then, in early 1965, using the attack on the U.S.
airbase at Pleiku as a pretext, President Johnson
ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the Philippines and Formosa
to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee
described the American corporate stake in South
east Asia in less specific but more chilling terms:
That empire in Southeast Asia is the last major
resource area outside the control of any one of
the major powers on the globe. ... I believe that
the condition of the Vietnamese people, and the
direction in which their future may be going,
are at this stage secondary, not primary.
Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor
ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that
In the past, foreign investors have been some
what wary of the overall political prospect for
the Southeast Asian region. I must say, though,
that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con
tinue to give effective protection to the free no
tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom
ise for fast growth. American businessmen are
becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are
over-extended, it is hard to find anyone in South
east Asia who believes that the U.S. will relin
quish a major role in the area.
Ihe American ruling class will never willingly
give up its investments in Southeast Asia. The de
fense of these interests requires a strong military,
and the maintenance of a strong military requires
a highly-trained officer corps. This is why ROTC"
which provides 50 pe r cent of the Army's new
officers each year — is so important to America's
rulers.
Is Vietnam A Mistake?
It is often argued by liberal apologists for the
Establishment that we should blame the Vietnam
War 011 the military, not the corporations. They
claim that it cannot be argued that the war is being
fought for economic reasons because it has put such
great strains 011 the domestic U.S. economy. They
point to inflation, the decline in the stock market,
and public statements by corporate directors. The
chairman of the Bank of America, for instance, said
recently that the war in Vietnam is "a tragic mis
take."
Is Vietnam a mistake? This article has presented
evidence that U.S. corporations are responsible for
the design and execution of U.S. foreign policy.
Business applauded when Lyndon Johnson moved
into \ ietnam. To the corporations, Vietnam is a mis
take only because we have not won an easy victory.
As long as the peoples of the Third World continue
to resist, these corporations will lead us into two,
three, many Vietnams.
In a statement issued on March 11, 1969, the
Stanford Board of Trustees outlined its position on
ROTC. The resolution said
ROTC is vital to the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military services, and it is of
crucial importance that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their strength to the task
. . . this board of trustees urges the president of
the university to continue his consulting with the
Department of Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and vitalize this pro
gram.
Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United
States has emerged as the world's dominant eco
nomic power. Accompanying this growth has been
a concentration and centralisation of capital. In

The role of U.S. direct investment in the world

abroad in the aggregate comprise the third

the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.
stake abroad, then, is substantial. U.S. foreign
policy is designed to defend and extend these busi
ness interests.
U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of
campaign funding and their positions on quasi
public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In

to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme

So our influence is used whenever it can be and

U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re

Brimmer remarked in 1965 that

In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right

Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain

by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern

The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight

natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet

concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po

In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas

Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor

Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that
In the past, foreign investors have been some
what wary of the overall political prospect for
the Southeast Asian region. I must say, though,
that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con
tinue to give effective protection to the free no
tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom
ise for fast growth. American businessmen are
becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are
over-extended, it is hard to find anyone in South
east Asia who believes that the U.S. will relin
quish a major role in the area.
Ihe American ruling class will never willingly
give up its investments in Southeast Asia. The de
fense of these interests requires a strong military,
and the maintenance of a strong military requires
a highly-trained officer corps. This is why ROTC"
which provides 50 pe r cent of the Army's new
officers each year — is so important to America's
rulers.
Is Vietnam A Mistake?
It is often argued by liberal apologists for the
Establishment that we should blame the Vietnam
War 011 the military, not the corporations. They
claim that it cannot be argued that the war is being
fought for economic reasons because it has put such
great strains 011 the domestic U.S. economy. They
point to inflation, the decline in the stock market,
and public statements by corporate directors. The
chairman of the Bank of America, for instance, said
recently that the war in Vietnam is "a tragic mis
take."
Is Vietnam a mistake? This article has presented
evidence that U.S. corporations are responsible for
the design and execution of U.S. foreign policy.
Business applauded when Lyndon Johnson moved
into \ ietnam. To the corporations, Vietnam is a mis
take only because we have not won an easy victory.
As long as the peoples of the Third World continue
to resist, these corporations will lead us into two,
three, many Vietnams.
In a statement issued on March 11, 1969, the
Stanford Board of Trustees outlined its position on
ROTC. The resolution said
ROTC is vital to the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military services, and it is of
crucial importance that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their strength to the task
. . . this board of trustees urges the president of
the university to continue his consulting with the
Department of Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and vitalize this pro
gram.
Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United
States has emerged as the world's dominant eco
nomic power. Accompanying this growth has been
a concentration and centralisation of capital. In
1947, the 200 largest industrial firms controlled 33
per cent of the nation's industrial assets; by 1965
the top 200 corporations controlled 55 per cent of
the assets.
In recent years, in order to keep production and
profits up, these great firms have been forced to
scour the globe in search of vital raw materials,
markets, and outlets for investment capital. Amer
ican business has gone "multinational." U.S. private
foreign investment jumped from $7.2 billion in
1946 to $65 billion by the end of 1968. Investment
banker Leo Model noted in Foreign Affairs in July,
1967, that
The role of U.S. direct investment in the world
economy is staggering. According to the U.S.
Council of the International Chamber of Com
merce, the gross value of production by Ameri
can companies abroad is well in excess of $100
billion a year. That is to say, on the basis of the
gross value of their output, U.S. enterprises
abroad in the aggregate comprise the third
largest country (if such a term can be used to
designate these companies) in the world — with
a gross product greater than any country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.
stake abroad, then, is substantial. U.S. foreign
policy is designed to defend and extend these busi
ness interests.
U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of
campaign funding and their positions on quasi
public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In
cluded are investment guarantees against losses due
to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme
diate and future export markets. Foreign aid is also
used to build part of the infrastructure — roads,
ports, power stations, etc. — needed by foreign in
vestors. In addition, foreign aid is designed to orient
the economies of the recipient countries toward cap
italist "free enterprise" which will welcome foreign
(especially American) investment. As Secretary of
State Dean Rusk (formerly head of the Rockefeller
Foundation) explained in 1962, the U.S. govern
ment wants underdeveloped nations
to create conditions which will be attractive to
the international investor, the private investor.
So our influence is used whenever it can be and
persistently, through our Embassies on a day-to
day basis, in our aid discussions and in direct
aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng
ed by national reformist and revolutionary move
ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right
wing government, no matter bow reactionary. The
so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and
capital.
Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain
power and begin to threaten U.S. business interests
by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern
ment can respond in several ways. It can cut off aid
via the Hickenlooper Amendment. Or it can sus
pend import quotas — as was done with Cuban
sugar in 1961. Or it can try to subvert the govern
ment in question. This is usually the task of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
After Iran nationalized its oil in 1951, the CIA
toppled the government in 1953. Guatemala na
tionalized uncultivated United Fruit Co. land in
1952 and the CIA engineered a coup in 1954. When
American oil interests in Indonesia were threatened
in 1958, in went the CIA. When Cuba nationalized
American-owned plantations and oil refineries in
1959 and 1960, the CIA trained Cuban exiles for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. When American copper
and cobalt interests were endangered in the Congo
in 1961, the CIA helped engineer a Tightest coup.
When a self-proclaimed Marxist seemed certain to
be re-elected president in British Guiana in 1963,
the CIA prevented this by working through the
AFL-CIO and Guianian labor unions. Although
there is no concrete proof, it seems likely that the
CIA engineering the overthrow of the anti-imperial
ist Sukarno regime in Indonesia in 1965. And no one
would be surprised to find that the CIA planned the
recent coup in Cambodia.
When American business interests are threatened
by revolutionary movements, the U.S. government
can send arms and advisors to help the local govern
ments repress the insurgency. If this proves unsuc
cessful, the Marines are landed. This occurred in
Lebandon in 1958, when 14,000 marines were sent
to ensure the safety of U.S. oil interests in the
Middle East. This step was taken to guard against
growing Arab nationalism sparked by the seizure of
power in Iraq by what seemed to be a revolutionary
military regime.
In 1965, when revolutionary forces were fighting
in the Dominican Republic to reinstall Juan Bosch
as president, fear for the safety of U.S. sugar and
other interests resulted in the landing of 24,000
troops.
The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight
Eisenhower expressed concern for the strategic
natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be
gan to bolster the regime with arms and advisors.
Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to
repress all dissident elements.
The continuing poverty and repression led to
guerrilla fighting in the countryside and the forma
tion in December, 1960, of the National Liberation
front (NLF). As the NLF grew in strength in the
early sixties, President Kennedy stepped up the
How of U.S. arms and "advisors" who increasingly
joined South Vietnamese troops in combat opera
tions. By 1964, 16,000 U.S. troops were stationed
in South Vietnam.
Then, in early 1965, using the attack on the U.S.
airbase at Pleiku as a pretext, President Johnson
ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the Philippines and Formosa
to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee
described the American corporate stake in South
east Asia in less specific but more chilling terms:
That empire in Southeast Asia is the last major
resource area outside the control of any one of
the major powers on the globe. ... I believe that
the condition of the Vietnamese people, and the
direction in which their future may be going,
are at this stage secondary, not primary.
Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor
ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that
In the past, foreign investors have been some
what wary of the overall political prospect for
the Southeast Asian region. I must say, though,
that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con
tinue to give effective protection to the free no
tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom

becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether

The answer to this question requires a brief

U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United

a concentration and centralisation of capital. In

high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak

So our influence is used whenever it can be and
persistently, through our Embassies on a day-to
day basis, in our aid discussions and in direct
aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng
ed by national reformist and revolutionary move
ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right
wing government, no matter bow reactionary. The
so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and
capital.
Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain
power and begin to threaten U.S. business interests
by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern
ment can respond in several ways. It can cut off aid
via the Hickenlooper Amendment. Or it can sus
pend import quotas — as was done with Cuban
sugar in 1961. Or it can try to subvert the govern
ment in question. This is usually the task of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
After Iran nationalized its oil in 1951, the CIA
toppled the government in 1953. Guatemala na
tionalized uncultivated United Fruit Co. land in
1952 and the CIA engineered a coup in 1954. When
American oil interests in Indonesia were threatened
in 1958, in went the CIA. When Cuba nationalized
American-owned plantations and oil refineries in
1959 and 1960, the CIA trained Cuban exiles for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. When American copper
and cobalt interests were endangered in the Congo
in 1961, the CIA helped engineer a Tightest coup.
When a self-proclaimed Marxist seemed certain to
be re-elected president in British Guiana in 1963,
the CIA prevented this by working through the
AFL-CIO and Guianian labor unions. Although
there is no concrete proof, it seems likely that the
CIA engineering the overthrow of the anti-imperial
ist Sukarno regime in Indonesia in 1965. And no one
would be surprised to find that the CIA planned the
recent coup in Cambodia.
When American business interests are threatened
by revolutionary movements, the U.S. government
can send arms and advisors to help the local govern
ments repress the insurgency. If this proves unsuc
cessful, the Marines are landed. This occurred in
Lebandon in 1958, when 14,000 marines were sent
to ensure the safety of U.S. oil interests in the
Middle East. This step was taken to guard against
growing Arab nationalism sparked by the seizure of
power in Iraq by what seemed to be a revolutionary
military regime.
In 1965, when revolutionary forces were fighting
in the Dominican Republic to reinstall Juan Bosch
as president, fear for the safety of U.S. sugar and
other interests resulted in the landing of 24,000
troops.
The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight
Eisenhower expressed concern for the strategic
natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be
gan to bolster the regime with arms and advisors.
Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to
repress all dissident elements.
The continuing poverty and repression led to
guerrilla fighting in the countryside and the forma
tion in December, 1960, of the National Liberation
front (NLF). As the NLF grew in strength in the
early sixties, President Kennedy stepped up the
How of U.S. arms and "advisors" who increasingly
joined South Vietnamese troops in combat opera
tions. By 1964, 16,000 U.S. troops were stationed
in South Vietnam.
Then, in early 1965, using the attack on the U.S.
airbase at Pleiku as a pretext, President Johnson
ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the Philippines and Formosa
to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee
described the American corporate stake in South
east Asia in less specific but more chilling terms:
That empire in Southeast Asia is the last major
resource area outside the control of any one of
the major powers on the globe. ... I believe that
the condition of the Vietnamese people, and the
direction in which their future may be going,
are at this stage secondary, not primary.
Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor
ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that
In the past, foreign investors have been some
what wary of the overall political prospect for
the Southeast Asian region. I must say, though,
that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con
tinue to give effective protection to the free no
tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom
ise for fast growth. American businessmen are
becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are
over-extended, it is hard to find anyone in South
east Asia who believes that the U.S. will relin
quish a major role in the area.
Ihe American ruling class will never willingly
give up its investments in Southeast Asia. The de
fense of these interests requires a strong military,
and the maintenance of a strong military requires
a highly-trained officer corps. This is why ROTC"
which provides 50 pe r cent of the Army's new
officers each year — is so important to America's
rulers.
Is Vietnam A Mistake?
It is often argued by liberal apologists for the
Establishment that we should blame the Vietnam
War 011 the military, not the corporations. They
claim that it cannot be argued that the war is being
fought for economic reasons because it has put such
great strains 011 the domestic U.S. economy. They
point to inflation, the decline in the stock market,
and public statements by corporate directors. The
chairman of the Bank of America, for instance, said
recently that the war in Vietnam is "a tragic mis
take."
Is Vietnam a mistake? This article has presented
evidence that U.S. corporations are responsible for
the design and execution of U.S. foreign policy.
Business applauded when Lyndon Johnson moved
into \ ietnam. To the corporations, Vietnam is a mis
take only because we have not won an easy victory.
As long as the peoples of the Third World continue
to resist, these corporations will lead us into two,
three, many Vietnams.
In a statement issued on March 11, 1969, the
Stanford Board of Trustees outlined its position on
ROTC. The resolution said
ROTC is vital to the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military services, and it is of
crucial importance that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their strength to the task
. . . this board of trustees urges the president of
the university to continue his consulting with the
Department of Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and vitalize this pro
gram.
Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United
States has emerged as the world's dominant eco
nomic power. Accompanying this growth has been
a concentration and centralisation of capital. In
1947, the 200 largest industrial firms controlled 33
per cent of the nation's industrial assets; by 1965
the top 200 corporations controlled 55 per cent of
the assets.
In recent years, in order to keep production and
profits up, these great firms have been forced to
scour the globe in search of vital raw materials,
markets, and outlets for investment capital. Amer
ican business has gone "multinational." U.S. private
foreign investment jumped from $7.2 billion in
1946 to $65 billion by the end of 1968. Investment
banker Leo Model noted in Foreign Affairs in July,
1967, that
The role of U.S. direct investment in the world
economy is staggering. According to the U.S.
Council of the International Chamber of Com
merce, the gross value of production by Ameri
can companies abroad is well in excess of $100
billion a year. That is to say, on the basis of the
gross value of their output, U.S. enterprises
abroad in the aggregate comprise the third
largest country (if such a term can be used to
designate these companies) in the world — with
a gross product greater than any country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.
stake abroad, then, is substantial. U.S. foreign
policy is designed to defend and extend these busi
ness interests.
U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of
campaign funding and their positions on quasi
public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In
cluded are investment guarantees against losses due
to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme
diate and future export markets. Foreign aid is also
used to build part of the infrastructure — roads,
ports, power stations, etc. — needed by foreign in
vestors. In addition, foreign aid is designed to orient
the economies of the recipient countries toward cap
italist "free enterprise" which will welcome foreign
(especially American) investment. As Secretary of
State Dean Rusk (formerly head of the Rockefeller
Foundation) explained in 1962, the U.S. govern
ment wants underdeveloped nations
to create conditions which will be attractive to
the international investor, the private investor.
So our influence is used whenever it can be and
persistently, through our Embassies on a day-to
day basis, in our aid discussions and in direct
aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng
ed by national reformist and revolutionary move
ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right
wing government, no matter bow reactionary. The
so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and
capital.
Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain
power and begin to threaten U.S. business interests
by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern
ment can respond in several ways. It can cut off aid
via the Hickenlooper Amendment. Or it can sus
pend import quotas — as was done with Cuban
sugar in 1961. Or it can try to subvert the govern
ment in question. This is usually the task of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
After Iran nationalized its oil in 1951, the CIA
toppled the government in 1953. Guatemala na

1952 and the CIA engineered a coup in 1954. When
American oil interests in Indonesia were threatened

American-owned plantations and oil refineries in
1959 and 1960, the CIA trained Cuban exiles for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. When American copper

recent coup in Cambodia.
When American business interests are threatened

military regime.
In 1965, when revolutionary forces were fighting
in the Dominican Republic to reinstall Juan Bosch
as president, fear for the safety of U.S. sugar and
other interests resulted in the landing of 24,000
troops.
The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight

natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be

Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to

The continuing poverty and repression led to

ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv

He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can

Profits before people — this is imperialism in a

Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that

that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con

tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom
ise for fast growth. American businessmen are
becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are
over-extended, it is hard to find anyone in South
east Asia who believes that the U.S. will relin
quish a major role in the area.
Ihe American ruling class will never willingly
give up its investments in Southeast Asia. The de
fense of these interests requires a strong military,
and the maintenance of a strong military requires
a highly-trained officer corps. This is why ROTC"
which provides 50 pe r cent of the Army's new
officers each year — is so important to America's
rulers.
Is Vietnam A Mistake?
It is often argued by liberal apologists for the
Establishment that we should blame the Vietnam
War 011 the military, not the corporations. They
claim that it cannot be argued that the war is being
fought for economic reasons because it has put such
great strains 011 the domestic U.S. economy. They
point to inflation, the decline in the stock market,
and public statements by corporate directors. The
chairman of the Bank of America, for instance, said
recently that the war in Vietnam is "a tragic mis
take."
Is Vietnam a mistake? This article has presented
evidence that U.S. corporations are responsible for
the design and execution of U.S. foreign policy.
Business applauded when Lyndon Johnson moved
into \ ietnam. To the corporations, Vietnam is a mis
take only because we have not won an easy victory.
As long as the peoples of the Third World continue
to resist, these corporations will lead us into two,
three, many Vietnams.
In a statement issued on March 11, 1969, the
Stanford Board of Trustees outlined its position on
ROTC. The resolution said
ROTC is vital to the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military services, and it is of
crucial importance that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their strength to the task
. . . this board of trustees urges the president of
the university to continue his consulting with the
Department of Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and vitalize this pro
gram.
Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United
States has emerged as the world's dominant eco
nomic power. Accompanying this growth has been
a concentration and centralisation of capital. In
1947, the 200 largest industrial firms controlled 33
per cent of the nation's industrial assets; by 1965
the top 200 corporations controlled 55 per cent of
the assets.
In recent years, in order to keep production and
profits up, these great firms have been forced to
scour the globe in search of vital raw materials,
markets, and outlets for investment capital. Amer
ican business has gone "multinational." U.S. private
foreign investment jumped from $7.2 billion in
1946 to $65 billion by the end of 1968. Investment
banker Leo Model noted in Foreign Affairs in July,
1967, that
The role of U.S. direct investment in the world
economy is staggering. According to the U.S.
Council of the International Chamber of Com
merce, the gross value of production by Ameri
can companies abroad is well in excess of $100
billion a year. That is to say, on the basis of the
gross value of their output, U.S. enterprises
abroad in the aggregate comprise the third
largest country (if such a term can be used to
designate these companies) in the world — with
a gross product greater than any country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.
stake abroad, then, is substantial. U.S. foreign
policy is designed to defend and extend these busi
ness interests.
U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of
campaign funding and their positions on quasi
public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In
cluded are investment guarantees against losses due
to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme
diate and future export markets. Foreign aid is also
used to build part of the infrastructure — roads,
ports, power stations, etc. — needed by foreign in
vestors. In addition, foreign aid is designed to orient
the economies of the recipient countries toward cap
italist "free enterprise" which will welcome foreign
(especially American) investment. As Secretary of
State Dean Rusk (formerly head of the Rockefeller
Foundation) explained in 1962, the U.S. govern
ment wants underdeveloped nations
to create conditions which will be attractive to
the international investor, the private investor.
So our influence is used whenever it can be and
persistently, through our Embassies on a day-to
day basis, in our aid discussions and in direct
aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng
ed by national reformist and revolutionary move
ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right
wing government, no matter bow reactionary. The
so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and
capital.
Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain
power and begin to threaten U.S. business interests
by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern
ment can respond in several ways. It can cut off aid
via the Hickenlooper Amendment. Or it can sus
pend import quotas — as was done with Cuban
sugar in 1961. Or it can try to subvert the govern
ment in question. This is usually the task of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
After Iran nationalized its oil in 1951, the CIA
toppled the government in 1953. Guatemala na
tionalized uncultivated United Fruit Co. land in
1952 and the CIA engineered a coup in 1954. When
American oil interests in Indonesia were threatened
in 1958, in went the CIA. When Cuba nationalized
American-owned plantations and oil refineries in
1959 and 1960, the CIA trained Cuban exiles for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. When American copper
and cobalt interests were endangered in the Congo
in 1961, the CIA helped engineer a Tightest coup.
When a self-proclaimed Marxist seemed certain to
be re-elected president in British Guiana in 1963,
the CIA prevented this by working through the
AFL-CIO and Guianian labor unions. Although
there is no concrete proof, it seems likely that the
CIA engineering the overthrow of the anti-imperial
ist Sukarno regime in Indonesia in 1965. And no one
would be surprised to find that the CIA planned the
recent coup in Cambodia.
When American business interests are threatened
by revolutionary movements, the U.S. government
can send arms and advisors to help the local govern
ments repress the insurgency. If this proves unsuc
cessful, the Marines are landed. This occurred in
Lebandon in 1958, when 14,000 marines were sent
to ensure the safety of U.S. oil interests in the
Middle East. This step was taken to guard against
growing Arab nationalism sparked by the seizure of
power in Iraq by what seemed to be a revolutionary
military regime.
In 1965, when revolutionary forces were fighting
in the Dominican Republic to reinstall Juan Bosch
as president, fear for the safety of U.S. sugar and
other interests resulted in the landing of 24,000
troops.
The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight
Eisenhower expressed concern for the strategic
natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be
gan to bolster the regime with arms and advisors.
Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to
repress all dissident elements.
The continuing poverty and repression led to
guerrilla fighting in the countryside and the forma
tion in December, 1960, of the National Liberation
front (NLF). As the NLF grew in strength in the
early sixties, President Kennedy stepped up the
How of U.S. arms and "advisors" who increasingly
joined South Vietnamese troops in combat opera
tions. By 1964, 16,000 U.S. troops were stationed
in South Vietnam.
Then, in early 1965, using the attack on the U.S.
airbase at Pleiku as a pretext, President Johnson
ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the Philippines and Formosa
to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee
described the American corporate stake in South
east Asia in less specific but more chilling terms:
That empire in Southeast Asia is the last major
resource area outside the control of any one of
the major powers on the globe. ... I believe that
the condition of the Vietnamese people, and the
direction in which their future may be going,
are at this stage secondary, not primary.
Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor
ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that
In the past, foreign investors have been some
what wary of the overall political prospect for
the Southeast Asian region. I must say, though,
that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con
tinue to give effective protection to the free no
tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom
ise for fast growth. American businessmen are
becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are
over-extended, it is hard to find anyone in South
east Asia who believes that the U.S. will relin
quish a major role in the area.
Ihe American ruling class will never willingly
give up its investments in Southeast Asia. The de
fense of these interests requires a strong military,
and the maintenance of a strong military requires
a highly-trained officer corps. This is why ROTC"
which provides 50 pe r cent of the Army's new

rulers.

claim that it cannot be argued that the war is being
fought for economic reasons because it has put such
great strains 011 the domestic U.S. economy. They
point to inflation, the decline in the stock market,
and public statements by corporate directors. The
chairman of the Bank of America, for instance, said
recently that the war in Vietnam is "a tragic mis

Business applauded when Lyndon Johnson moved

As long as the peoples of the Third World continue

. . . this board of trustees urges the president of

Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United

a concentration and centralisation of capital. In

The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.

U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of

public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak

less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In

The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is

to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the

nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the Philippines and Formosa
to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee
described the American corporate stake in South
east Asia in less specific but more chilling terms:
That empire in Southeast Asia is the last major
resource area outside the control of any one of
the major powers on the globe. ... I believe that
the condition of the Vietnamese people, and the
direction in which their future may be going,
are at this stage secondary, not primary.
Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor
ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that
In the past, foreign investors have been some
what wary of the overall political prospect for
the Southeast Asian region. I must say, though,
that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con
tinue to give effective protection to the free no
tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom
ise for fast growth. American businessmen are
becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are
over-extended, it is hard to find anyone in South
east Asia who believes that the U.S. will relin
quish a major role in the area.
Ihe American ruling class will never willingly
give up its investments in Southeast Asia. The de
fense of these interests requires a strong military,
and the maintenance of a strong military requires
a highly-trained officer corps. This is why ROTC"
which provides 50 pe r cent of the Army's new
officers each year — is so important to America's
rulers.
Is Vietnam A Mistake?
It is often argued by liberal apologists for the
Establishment that we should blame the Vietnam
War 011 the military, not the corporations. They
claim that it cannot be argued that the war is being
fought for economic reasons because it has put such
great strains 011 the domestic U.S. economy. They
point to inflation, the decline in the stock market,
and public statements by corporate directors. The
chairman of the Bank of America, for instance, said
recently that the war in Vietnam is "a tragic mis
take."
Is Vietnam a mistake? This article has presented
evidence that U.S. corporations are responsible for
the design and execution of U.S. foreign policy.
Business applauded when Lyndon Johnson moved
into \ ietnam. To the corporations, Vietnam is a mis
take only because we have not won an easy victory.
As long as the peoples of the Third World continue
to resist, these corporations will lead us into two,
three, many Vietnams.
In a statement issued on March 11, 1969, the
Stanford Board of Trustees outlined its position on
ROTC. The resolution said
ROTC is vital to the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military services, and it is of
crucial importance that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their strength to the task
. . . this board of trustees urges the president of
the university to continue his consulting with the
Department of Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and vitalize this pro
gram.
Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United
States has emerged as the world's dominant eco
nomic power. Accompanying this growth has been
a concentration and centralisation of capital. In
1947, the 200 largest industrial firms controlled 33
per cent of the nation's industrial assets; by 1965
the top 200 corporations controlled 55 per cent of
the assets.
In recent years, in order to keep production and
profits up, these great firms have been forced to
scour the globe in search of vital raw materials,
markets, and outlets for investment capital. Amer
ican business has gone "multinational." U.S. private
foreign investment jumped from $7.2 billion in
1946 to $65 billion by the end of 1968. Investment
banker Leo Model noted in Foreign Affairs in July,
1967, that
The role of U.S. direct investment in the world
economy is staggering. According to the U.S.
Council of the International Chamber of Com
merce, the gross value of production by Ameri
can companies abroad is well in excess of $100
billion a year. That is to say, on the basis of the
gross value of their output, U.S. enterprises
abroad in the aggregate comprise the third
largest country (if such a term can be used to
designate these companies) in the world — with
a gross product greater than any country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.
stake abroad, then, is substantial. U.S. foreign
policy is designed to defend and extend these busi
ness interests.
U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of
campaign funding and their positions on quasi
public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In
cluded are investment guarantees against losses due
to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme
diate and future export markets. Foreign aid is also
used to build part of the infrastructure — roads,
ports, power stations, etc. — needed by foreign in
vestors. In addition, foreign aid is designed to orient
the economies of the recipient countries toward cap
italist "free enterprise" which will welcome foreign
(especially American) investment. As Secretary of
State Dean Rusk (formerly head of the Rockefeller
Foundation) explained in 1962, the U.S. govern
ment wants underdeveloped nations
to create conditions which will be attractive to
the international investor, the private investor.
So our influence is used whenever it can be and
persistently, through our Embassies on a day-to
day basis, in our aid discussions and in direct
aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng
ed by national reformist and revolutionary move
ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right
wing government, no matter bow reactionary. The
so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and
capital.
Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain
power and begin to threaten U.S. business interests
by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern
ment can respond in several ways. It can cut off aid
via the Hickenlooper Amendment. Or it can sus
pend import quotas — as was done with Cuban
sugar in 1961. Or it can try to subvert the govern
ment in question. This is usually the task of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
After Iran nationalized its oil in 1951, the CIA
toppled the government in 1953. Guatemala na
tionalized uncultivated United Fruit Co. land in
1952 and the CIA engineered a coup in 1954. When
American oil interests in Indonesia were threatened
in 1958, in went the CIA. When Cuba nationalized
American-owned plantations and oil refineries in
1959 and 1960, the CIA trained Cuban exiles for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. When American copper
and cobalt interests were endangered in the Congo
in 1961, the CIA helped engineer a Tightest coup.
When a self-proclaimed Marxist seemed certain to
be re-elected president in British Guiana in 1963,
the CIA prevented this by working through the
AFL-CIO and Guianian labor unions. Although
there is no concrete proof, it seems likely that the
CIA engineering the overthrow of the anti-imperial
ist Sukarno regime in Indonesia in 1965. And no one
would be surprised to find that the CIA planned the
recent coup in Cambodia.
When American business interests are threatened
by revolutionary movements, the U.S. government
can send arms and advisors to help the local govern
ments repress the insurgency. If this proves unsuc
cessful, the Marines are landed. This occurred in
Lebandon in 1958, when 14,000 marines were sent
to ensure the safety of U.S. oil interests in the
Middle East. This step was taken to guard against
growing Arab nationalism sparked by the seizure of
power in Iraq by what seemed to be a revolutionary
military regime.
In 1965, when revolutionary forces were fighting
in the Dominican Republic to reinstall Juan Bosch
as president, fear for the safety of U.S. sugar and
other interests resulted in the landing of 24,000
troops.
The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight
Eisenhower expressed concern for the strategic
natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be
gan to bolster the regime with arms and advisors.
Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to
repress all dissident elements.
The continuing poverty and repression led to
guerrilla fighting in the countryside and the forma
tion in December, 1960, of the National Liberation
front (NLF). As the NLF grew in strength in the
early sixties, President Kennedy stepped up the
How of U.S. arms and "advisors" who increasingly
joined South Vietnamese troops in combat opera
tions. By 1964, 16,000 U.S. troops were stationed
in South Vietnam.
Then, in early 1965, using the attack on the U.S.
airbase at Pleiku as a pretext, President Johnson
ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the Philippines and Formosa
to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee
described the American corporate stake in South
east Asia in less specific but more chilling terms:
That empire in Southeast Asia is the last major
resource area outside the control of any one of
the major powers on the globe. ... I believe that
the condition of the Vietnamese people, and the
direction in which their future may be going,
are at this stage secondary, not primary.
Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor
ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that

that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —

Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom

becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding

ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether

The answer to this question requires a brief

U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United

a concentration and centralisation of capital. In

The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.

U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and

public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In
cluded are investment guarantees against losses due
to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme
diate and future export markets. Foreign aid is also
used to build part of the infrastructure — roads,
ports, power stations, etc. — needed by foreign in
vestors. In addition, foreign aid is designed to orient
the economies of the recipient countries toward cap
italist "free enterprise" which will welcome foreign
(especially American) investment. As Secretary of
State Dean Rusk (formerly head of the Rockefeller
Foundation) explained in 1962, the U.S. govern
ment wants underdeveloped nations
to create conditions which will be attractive to
the international investor, the private investor.
So our influence is used whenever it can be and
persistently, through our Embassies on a day-to
day basis, in our aid discussions and in direct
aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng
ed by national reformist and revolutionary move
ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right
wing government, no matter bow reactionary. The
so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and
capital.
Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain
power and begin to threaten U.S. business interests
by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern
ment can respond in several ways. It can cut off aid
via the Hickenlooper Amendment. Or it can sus
pend import quotas — as was done with Cuban
sugar in 1961. Or it can try to subvert the govern
ment in question. This is usually the task of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
After Iran nationalized its oil in 1951, the CIA
toppled the government in 1953. Guatemala na
tionalized uncultivated United Fruit Co. land in
1952 and the CIA engineered a coup in 1954. When
American oil interests in Indonesia were threatened
in 1958, in went the CIA. When Cuba nationalized
American-owned plantations and oil refineries in
1959 and 1960, the CIA trained Cuban exiles for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. When American copper
and cobalt interests were endangered in the Congo
in 1961, the CIA helped engineer a Tightest coup.
When a self-proclaimed Marxist seemed certain to
be re-elected president in British Guiana in 1963,
the CIA prevented this by working through the
AFL-CIO and Guianian labor unions. Although
there is no concrete proof, it seems likely that the
CIA engineering the overthrow of the anti-imperial
ist Sukarno regime in Indonesia in 1965. And no one
would be surprised to find that the CIA planned the
recent coup in Cambodia.
When American business interests are threatened
by revolutionary movements, the U.S. government
can send arms and advisors to help the local govern
ments repress the insurgency. If this proves unsuc
cessful, the Marines are landed. This occurred in
Lebandon in 1958, when 14,000 marines were sent
to ensure the safety of U.S. oil interests in the
Middle East. This step was taken to guard against
growing Arab nationalism sparked by the seizure of
power in Iraq by what seemed to be a revolutionary
military regime.
In 1965, when revolutionary forces were fighting
in the Dominican Republic to reinstall Juan Bosch
as president, fear for the safety of U.S. sugar and
other interests resulted in the landing of 24,000
troops.
The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight
Eisenhower expressed concern for the strategic
natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be
gan to bolster the regime with arms and advisors.
Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to
repress all dissident elements.
The continuing poverty and repression led to
guerrilla fighting in the countryside and the forma
tion in December, 1960, of the National Liberation
front (NLF). As the NLF grew in strength in the
early sixties, President Kennedy stepped up the
How of U.S. arms and "advisors" who increasingly
joined South Vietnamese troops in combat opera
tions. By 1964, 16,000 U.S. troops were stationed
in South Vietnam.
Then, in early 1965, using the attack on the U.S.
airbase at Pleiku as a pretext, President Johnson
ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the Philippines and Formosa
to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee
described the American corporate stake in South
east Asia in less specific but more chilling terms:
That empire in Southeast Asia is the last major
resource area outside the control of any one of
the major powers on the globe. ... I believe that
the condition of the Vietnamese people, and the
direction in which their future may be going,
are at this stage secondary, not primary.
Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor
ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that
In the past, foreign investors have been some
what wary of the overall political prospect for
the Southeast Asian region. I must say, though,
that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con
tinue to give effective protection to the free no
tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom
ise for fast growth. American businessmen are
becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are
over-extended, it is hard to find anyone in South
east Asia who believes that the U.S. will relin
quish a major role in the area.
Ihe American ruling class will never willingly
give up its investments in Southeast Asia. The de
fense of these interests requires a strong military,
and the maintenance of a strong military requires
a highly-trained officer corps. This is why ROTC"
which provides 50 pe r cent of the Army's new
officers each year — is so important to America's
rulers.
Is Vietnam A Mistake?
It is often argued by liberal apologists for the
Establishment that we should blame the Vietnam
War 011 the military, not the corporations. They
claim that it cannot be argued that the war is being
fought for economic reasons because it has put such
great strains 011 the domestic U.S. economy. They
point to inflation, the decline in the stock market,
and public statements by corporate directors. The
chairman of the Bank of America, for instance, said
recently that the war in Vietnam is "a tragic mis
take."
Is Vietnam a mistake? This article has presented
evidence that U.S. corporations are responsible for
the design and execution of U.S. foreign policy.
Business applauded when Lyndon Johnson moved
into \ ietnam. To the corporations, Vietnam is a mis
take only because we have not won an easy victory.
As long as the peoples of the Third World continue
to resist, these corporations will lead us into two,
three, many Vietnams.
In a statement issued on March 11, 1969, the
Stanford Board of Trustees outlined its position on
ROTC. The resolution said
ROTC is vital to the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military services, and it is of
crucial importance that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their strength to the task
. . . this board of trustees urges the president of
the university to continue his consulting with the
Department of Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and vitalize this pro
gram.
Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United
States has emerged as the world's dominant eco
nomic power. Accompanying this growth has been
a concentration and centralisation of capital. In
1947, the 200 largest industrial firms controlled 33
per cent of the nation's industrial assets; by 1965
the top 200 corporations controlled 55 per cent of
the assets.
In recent years, in order to keep production and
profits up, these great firms have been forced to
scour the globe in search of vital raw materials,
markets, and outlets for investment capital. Amer
ican business has gone "multinational." U.S. private
foreign investment jumped from $7.2 billion in
1946 to $65 billion by the end of 1968. Investment
banker Leo Model noted in Foreign Affairs in July,
1967, that
The role of U.S. direct investment in the world
economy is staggering. According to the U.S.
Council of the International Chamber of Com
merce, the gross value of production by Ameri
can companies abroad is well in excess of $100
billion a year. That is to say, on the basis of the
gross value of their output, U.S. enterprises
abroad in the aggregate comprise the third
largest country (if such a term can be used to
designate these companies) in the world — with
a gross product greater than any country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.
stake abroad, then, is substantial. U.S. foreign
policy is designed to defend and extend these busi
ness interests.
U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of
campaign funding and their positions on quasi
public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In
cluded are investment guarantees against losses due
to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme
diate and future export markets. Foreign aid is also
used to build part of the infrastructure — roads,
ports, power stations, etc. — needed by foreign in
vestors. In addition, foreign aid is designed to orient
the economies of the recipient countries toward cap
italist "free enterprise" which will welcome foreign
(especially American) investment. As Secretary of
State Dean Rusk (formerly head of the Rockefeller

to create conditions which will be attractive to
the international investor, the private investor.
So our influence is used whenever it can be and

aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng

ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right

so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and

Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain

by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern

The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo

natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .

posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop

The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet

concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po

U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur

The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar

Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as

which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are
over-extended, it is hard to find anyone in South
east Asia who believes that the U.S. will relin
quish a major role in the area.
Ihe American ruling class will never willingly
give up its investments in Southeast Asia. The de
fense of these interests requires a strong military,
and the maintenance of a strong military requires
a highly-trained officer corps. This is why ROTC"
which provides 50 pe r cent of the Army's new
officers each year — is so important to America's
rulers.
Is Vietnam A Mistake?
It is often argued by liberal apologists for the
Establishment that we should blame the Vietnam
War 011 the military, not the corporations. They
claim that it cannot be argued that the war is being
fought for economic reasons because it has put such
great strains 011 the domestic U.S. economy. They
point to inflation, the decline in the stock market,
and public statements by corporate directors. The
chairman of the Bank of America, for instance, said
recently that the war in Vietnam is "a tragic mis
take."
Is Vietnam a mistake? This article has presented
evidence that U.S. corporations are responsible for
the design and execution of U.S. foreign policy.
Business applauded when Lyndon Johnson moved
into \ ietnam. To the corporations, Vietnam is a mis
take only because we have not won an easy victory.
As long as the peoples of the Third World continue
to resist, these corporations will lead us into two,
three, many Vietnams.
In a statement issued on March 11, 1969, the
Stanford Board of Trustees outlined its position on
ROTC. The resolution said
ROTC is vital to the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military services, and it is of
crucial importance that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their strength to the task
. . . this board of trustees urges the president of
the university to continue his consulting with the
Department of Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and vitalize this pro
gram.
Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United
States has emerged as the world's dominant eco
nomic power. Accompanying this growth has been
a concentration and centralisation of capital. In
1947, the 200 largest industrial firms controlled 33
per cent of the nation's industrial assets; by 1965
the top 200 corporations controlled 55 per cent of
the assets.
In recent years, in order to keep production and
profits up, these great firms have been forced to
scour the globe in search of vital raw materials,
markets, and outlets for investment capital. Amer
ican business has gone "multinational." U.S. private
foreign investment jumped from $7.2 billion in
1946 to $65 billion by the end of 1968. Investment
banker Leo Model noted in Foreign Affairs in July,
1967, that
The role of U.S. direct investment in the world
economy is staggering. According to the U.S.
Council of the International Chamber of Com
merce, the gross value of production by Ameri
can companies abroad is well in excess of $100
billion a year. That is to say, on the basis of the
gross value of their output, U.S. enterprises
abroad in the aggregate comprise the third
largest country (if such a term can be used to
designate these companies) in the world — with
a gross product greater than any country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.
stake abroad, then, is substantial. U.S. foreign
policy is designed to defend and extend these busi
ness interests.
U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of
campaign funding and their positions on quasi
public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In
cluded are investment guarantees against losses due
to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme
diate and future export markets. Foreign aid is also
used to build part of the infrastructure — roads,
ports, power stations, etc. — needed by foreign in
vestors. In addition, foreign aid is designed to orient
the economies of the recipient countries toward cap
italist "free enterprise" which will welcome foreign
(especially American) investment. As Secretary of
State Dean Rusk (formerly head of the Rockefeller
Foundation) explained in 1962, the U.S. govern
ment wants underdeveloped nations
to create conditions which will be attractive to
the international investor, the private investor.
So our influence is used whenever it can be and
persistently, through our Embassies on a day-to
day basis, in our aid discussions and in direct
aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng
ed by national reformist and revolutionary move
ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right
wing government, no matter bow reactionary. The
so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and
capital.
Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain
power and begin to threaten U.S. business interests
by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern
ment can respond in several ways. It can cut off aid
via the Hickenlooper Amendment. Or it can sus
pend import quotas — as was done with Cuban
sugar in 1961. Or it can try to subvert the govern
ment in question. This is usually the task of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
After Iran nationalized its oil in 1951, the CIA
toppled the government in 1953. Guatemala na
tionalized uncultivated United Fruit Co. land in
1952 and the CIA engineered a coup in 1954. When
American oil interests in Indonesia were threatened
in 1958, in went the CIA. When Cuba nationalized
American-owned plantations and oil refineries in
1959 and 1960, the CIA trained Cuban exiles for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. When American copper
and cobalt interests were endangered in the Congo
in 1961, the CIA helped engineer a Tightest coup.
When a self-proclaimed Marxist seemed certain to
be re-elected president in British Guiana in 1963,
the CIA prevented this by working through the
AFL-CIO and Guianian labor unions. Although
there is no concrete proof, it seems likely that the
CIA engineering the overthrow of the anti-imperial
ist Sukarno regime in Indonesia in 1965. And no one
would be surprised to find that the CIA planned the
recent coup in Cambodia.
When American business interests are threatened
by revolutionary movements, the U.S. government
can send arms and advisors to help the local govern
ments repress the insurgency. If this proves unsuc
cessful, the Marines are landed. This occurred in
Lebandon in 1958, when 14,000 marines were sent
to ensure the safety of U.S. oil interests in the
Middle East. This step was taken to guard against
growing Arab nationalism sparked by the seizure of
power in Iraq by what seemed to be a revolutionary
military regime.
In 1965, when revolutionary forces were fighting
in the Dominican Republic to reinstall Juan Bosch
as president, fear for the safety of U.S. sugar and
other interests resulted in the landing of 24,000
troops.
The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight
Eisenhower expressed concern for the strategic
natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be
gan to bolster the regime with arms and advisors.
Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to
repress all dissident elements.
The continuing poverty and repression led to
guerrilla fighting in the countryside and the forma
tion in December, 1960, of the National Liberation
front (NLF). As the NLF grew in strength in the
early sixties, President Kennedy stepped up the
How of U.S. arms and "advisors" who increasingly
joined South Vietnamese troops in combat opera
tions. By 1964, 16,000 U.S. troops were stationed
in South Vietnam.
Then, in early 1965, using the attack on the U.S.
airbase at Pleiku as a pretext, President Johnson
ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the Philippines and Formosa
to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee
described the American corporate stake in South
east Asia in less specific but more chilling terms:
That empire in Southeast Asia is the last major
resource area outside the control of any one of
the major powers on the globe. ... I believe that
the condition of the Vietnamese people, and the
direction in which their future may be going,
are at this stage secondary, not primary.
Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor
ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that
In the past, foreign investors have been some
what wary of the overall political prospect for
the Southeast Asian region. I must say, though,
that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con
tinue to give effective protection to the free no
tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom
ise for fast growth. American businessmen are
becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are

. . . this board of trustees urges the president of

"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American

U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad

the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.

U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control

major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and

or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak

economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business

would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be
gan to bolster the regime with arms and advisors.
Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to
repress all dissident elements.
The continuing poverty and repression led to
guerrilla fighting in the countryside and the forma
tion in December, 1960, of the National Liberation
front (NLF). As the NLF grew in strength in the
early sixties, President Kennedy stepped up the
How of U.S. arms and "advisors" who increasingly
joined South Vietnamese troops in combat opera
tions. By 1964, 16,000 U.S. troops were stationed
in South Vietnam.
Then, in early 1965, using the attack on the U.S.
airbase at Pleiku as a pretext, President Johnson
ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the Philippines and Formosa
to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee
described the American corporate stake in South
east Asia in less specific but more chilling terms:
That empire in Southeast Asia is the last major
resource area outside the control of any one of
the major powers on the globe. ... I believe that
the condition of the Vietnamese people, and the
direction in which their future may be going,
are at this stage secondary, not primary.
Profits before people — this is imperialism in a
nutshell. Vietnamese die so that American corpor
ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend
their existing and potential interests. In that year,
Alfred Wentworth, vice-president in charge of Far
Eastern Oeprations for the Chase Manhattan Bank,
explained that
In the past, foreign investors have been some
what wary of the overall political prospect for
the Southeast Asian region. I must say, though,
that the U.S. actions in Vietnam this year —
which have demonstrated that the U.S. will con
tinue to give effective protection to the free no
tions of the region — have considerably reassur
ed both Asian and Western investors.
Since the 1965 escalation, American investors
have been flocking to Southeast Asia. Business
Week observed recently that
Among the world's developing regions, South
east Asia with its 260-million people and its
natural wealth probably holds the greatest prom
ise for fast growth. American businessmen are
becoming aware of the area's potential and are
moving in to sell and invest, to tap expanding
markets, utilize pools of low-cost labor for man
ufacturing, develop tourism, cut timber, search
for oil, and dig for metals.
U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

fomia, represented on the Stanford board by its
chairman, Arthur Stewart, has concessions in Indo
nesia and off the coast of Thailand in the Gulf of
Siani. Union has also conducted seismic test for oil
in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur
rent Thai insurgency. Tenneeo, whose president
and chairman, Gardiner Symonds, is a trustee, also
lias concessions in Indonesia and in the Gulf of
Siam. Standard Oil of Indiana, whose vice-presi
dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
ROIC And The Empire
The American empire is rapidly expanding into
Southeast Asia, The U.S. war effort in Vietnam can
only be understood as an attempt to permit this
imeprial growth to continue. Business Week ob
served recently that
Despite the debate in the U.S. about whether
the American strength and commitments are
over-extended, it is hard to find anyone in South
east Asia who believes that the U.S. will relin
quish a major role in the area.
Ihe American ruling class will never willingly
give up its investments in Southeast Asia. The de
fense of these interests requires a strong military,
and the maintenance of a strong military requires
a highly-trained officer corps. This is why ROTC"
which provides 50 pe r cent of the Army's new
officers each year — is so important to America's
rulers.
Is Vietnam A Mistake?
It is often argued by liberal apologists for the
Establishment that we should blame the Vietnam
War 011 the military, not the corporations. They
claim that it cannot be argued that the war is being
fought for economic reasons because it has put such
great strains 011 the domestic U.S. economy. They
point to inflation, the decline in the stock market,
and public statements by corporate directors. The
chairman of the Bank of America, for instance, said
recently that the war in Vietnam is "a tragic mis
take."
Is Vietnam a mistake? This article has presented
evidence that U.S. corporations are responsible for
the design and execution of U.S. foreign policy.
Business applauded when Lyndon Johnson moved
into \ ietnam. To the corporations, Vietnam is a mis
take only because we have not won an easy victory.
As long as the peoples of the Third World continue
to resist, these corporations will lead us into two,
three, many Vietnams.
In a statement issued on March 11, 1969, the
Stanford Board of Trustees outlined its position on
ROTC. The resolution said
ROTC is vital to the continued supply of civilian
leadership for the military services, and it is of
crucial importance that first-ranking institutions,
such as Stanford, lend their strength to the task
. . . this board of trustees urges the president of
the university to continue his consulting with the
Department of Defense, leading to appropriate
actions which will improve and vitalize this pro
gram.
Why do the trustees consider ROTC to be of such
"crucial importance," arid why would they want
to "improve and vitalize" the program? Or, to
phrase the question more appropriately, what trus
tee interests does ROTC as an institution help to
defend?
The answer to this question requires a brief
analysis of the aggressively expanding American
economy — with specific reference to the growing
U.S. corporate penetration of Southeast Asia. The
war in Vietnam can only be understood as a logical
continuation of a foreign policy designed to make
the world safe for American capitalism. As will be
shown, the Stanford trustees are in the vanguard
of the U.S. business drive into Southeast Asia. Their
enthusiasm for ROTC is a logical consequence.
Business Moves Abroad
Since the end of the war in 1945, the United
States has emerged as the world's dominant eco
nomic power. Accompanying this growth has been
a concentration and centralisation of capital. In
1947, the 200 largest industrial firms controlled 33
per cent of the nation's industrial assets; by 1965
the top 200 corporations controlled 55 per cent of
the assets.
In recent years, in order to keep production and
profits up, these great firms have been forced to
scour the globe in search of vital raw materials,
markets, and outlets for investment capital. Amer
ican business has gone "multinational." U.S. private
foreign investment jumped from $7.2 billion in
1946 to $65 billion by the end of 1968. Investment
banker Leo Model noted in Foreign Affairs in July,
1967, that
The role of U.S. direct investment in the world
economy is staggering. According to the U.S.
Council of the International Chamber of Com
merce, the gross value of production by Ameri
can companies abroad is well in excess of $100
billion a year. That is to say, on the basis of the
gross value of their output, U.S. enterprises
abroad in the aggregate comprise the third
largest country (if such a term can be used to
designate these companies) in the world — with
a gross product greater than any country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
The "third largest country in the world!" The U.S.
stake abroad, then, is substantial. U.S. foreign
policy is designed to defend and extend these busi
ness interests.
U.S. foreign assets are even more concentrated
than domestic holdings; seventy companies control
half of all American foreign investment. It is the
major stockholders, directors, and executives of
these largest multinational corporations, along with
the nation s leading bankers, insurance brokers, and
lawyers, who comprise the upper levels of the
American ruling class. Through their control of
campaign funding and their positions on quasi
public bodies like the Council on F | ; <*n ReW'ons,
or presidential commissions and task forces, and in
high-level posts in the government — especially in
the Departments of State, Defense, and the Trea
sury — these men shape American foreign policy
in the interests of their corporations and banks. As
Calvin Coolidge once said, "The business of Amer
ica is business" — both at home and abroad.
Into The Third World
Increasingly, U.S. business is moving into the
under-developed nations of the Third World — at
tracted by the rich natural resources, markets, and
cheap labor — spelling huge profits for American
firms. Close to 40 per cent of all U.S. foreign invest
ment is located in the developing nations of Latin
America, Asia, and Africa.
Business's representatives in government recog
nize the importance of the Third World to American
capitalism. In 1958, Undersecretary of State C.
Douglas Dillon (formerly with the influential in
vestment house of Dillon, Reed, and Co. and later
Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy and
Johnson), remarked,
I am an investment banker by trade, and I speak
as an investment banker when I say that today's
less developed nations are tomorrow's richest
economic and political assets.
The U.S. government supports American business
interests in the Third World in many ways. In
cluded are investment guarantees against losses due
to monetary inconvertibility, expropriation, riot, in

surrection, revolution and war. Foreign aid, tied to
the purchase of U.S. goods, is used to create imme
diate and future export markets. Foreign aid is also
used to build part of the infrastructure — roads,
ports, power stations, etc. — needed by foreign in
vestors. In addition, foreign aid is designed to orient
the economies of the recipient countries toward cap
italist "free enterprise" which will welcome foreign
(especially American) investment. As Secretary of
State Dean Rusk (formerly head of the Rockefeller
Foundation) explained in 1962, the U.S. govern
ment wants underdeveloped nations
to create conditions which will be attractive to
the international investor, the private investor.
So our influence is used whenever it can be and
persistently, through our Embassies on a day-to
day basis, in our aid discussions and in direct
aid negotiations to underline the importance of
private investment.
U.S. aid is often used to keep shaky, military re
gimes in power — regimes that are being challeng
ed by national reformist and revolutionary move
ments. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Andrew
Brimmer remarked in 1965 that
If these military and economic aid programs
were discontinued, private investments might be
a waste, because it would not be safe enough
for you to make them.
In reality, the U.S. will support almost any right
wing government, no matter bow reactionary. The
so-called "Free World" is free in one sense only —
it allows unimpeded access to American goods and
capital.
Defending The Empire
When reformist governments do manage to gain
power and begin to threaten U.S. business interests
by raising taxes, limiting remitted profits, or even
exprorpiating U.S. holdings, the American govern
ment can respond in several ways. It can cut off aid
via the Hickenlooper Amendment. Or it can sus
pend import quotas — as was done with Cuban
sugar in 1961. Or it can try to subvert the govern
ment in question. This is usually the task of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
After Iran nationalized its oil in 1951, the CIA
toppled the government in 1953. Guatemala na
tionalized uncultivated United Fruit Co. land in
1952 and the CIA engineered a coup in 1954. When
American oil interests in Indonesia were threatened
in 1958, in went the CIA. When Cuba nationalized
American-owned plantations and oil refineries in
1959 and 1960, the CIA trained Cuban exiles for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. When American copper
and cobalt interests were endangered in the Congo
in 1961, the CIA helped engineer a Tightest coup.
When a self-proclaimed Marxist seemed certain to
be re-elected president in British Guiana in 1963,
the CIA prevented this by working through the
AFL-CIO and Guianian labor unions. Although
there is no concrete proof, it seems likely that the
CIA engineering the overthrow of the anti-imperial
ist Sukarno regime in Indonesia in 1965. And no one
would be surprised to find that the CIA planned the
recent coup in Cambodia.
When American business interests are threatened
by revolutionary movements, the U.S. government
can send arms and advisors to help the local govern
ments repress the insurgency. If this proves unsuc
cessful, the Marines are landed. This occurred in
Lebandon in 1958, when 14,000 marines were sent
to ensure the safety of U.S. oil interests in the
Middle East. This step was taken to guard against
growing Arab nationalism sparked by the seizure of
power in Iraq by what seemed to be a revolutionary
military regime.
In 1965, when revolutionary forces were fighting
in the Dominican Republic to reinstall Juan Bosch
as president, fear for the safety of U.S. sugar and
other interests resulted in the landing of 24,000
troops.
The continuing U.S. aggression in Indochina is
only the latest in a series of interventions designed
to keep the underdeveloped world open to American
business.
Vietnam
U.S. involvement in Vietnam dates back to the
early 1950's when the Vietminh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, were fighting for liberation from the French.
By the siege of Dien Bien Phu in April, 1954, the
United States was paying for 80 per cent of the
French war effort and was on the brink of open
military intervention. Looking back on the Indo
chinese conflict in his memoirs in 1963, Dwight
Eisenhower expressed concern for the strategic
natural resources of Southeast Asia. Eisenhower
wrote that
The loss of all Vietnam, together with Laos on
the west and Cambodia on the southwest . . .
would have spelled the loss of invaluable de
posits of tin and prodigious supplies of rubber
and rice.
Southeast Asia alone supplied (and still supplies)
more than 90 per cent of the world's natural rubber
and over 60 per cent of the world s tin.
At Geneva, in July, 1954, Vietnam was tempor
arily divided pending elections to reunify the conn

try in July, 1959. The United States installed Ngo
Dinh Diem as head of a puppet government in the
south and, in violation of the Geneva Accords, be
gan to bolster the regime with arms and advisors.
Diem, of course, refused to hold the elections, and
in the next few years, he undertook a campaign to
repress all dissident elements.
The continuing poverty and repression led to
guerrilla fighting in the countryside and the forma
tion in December, 1960, of the National Liberation
front (NLF). As the NLF grew in strength in the
early sixties, President Kennedy stepped up the
How of U.S. arms and "advisors" who increasingly

Then, in early 1965, using the attack on the U.S.
airbase at Pleiku as a pretext, President Johnson
ordered the systematic bombing of North Vietnam.
The escalation had begun, and by 1968, U.S. troop
strength had been increased to 550,000 men.
The American counterrevolutionary effort in Viet
nam in the 1960's has been prompted by the same
concerns that almost led this country into war in
1954 — Southeast Asia's vast natural resources,
and, to a lesser extent, the region's existing and po
tential markets.
In 1965, Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S. ambas
sador to South Vietnam and more recently, Amer
ican representative to the Paris peace talks, ex
plained the nature of American interests in Soudv
east Asia. Lodge observed that
He who holds or has influence in Vietnam can

to the east, Thailand and Burma with their huge
rice surpluses to the west, and Malaysia and In
donesia with their rubber, ore, and tin to the
south. Vietnam thus does not exist in a geo
graphical vacuum — from it large storehouses
of wealth and population can be influenced and
undermined.
In the same year, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee

Profits before people — this is imperialism in a

ations may prosper.
Cashing In On A "Good" Thing
American businessmen understood that the U.S.
military escalation of 1965 was designed to defend

U.S. investment in East Asia (including South
Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Hong Kong but
excluding Japan) stood at roughly $1.5 billion in
1968. This figure will grow rapidly in the next few
years.
Enter The Trustee
U.S. firms are investing in every sector in East
Asia — oil, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and manufacturing. Much of this activity
is being undertaken by companies with which the
Stanford trustees are affiliated. There can be no mis
take about it — these corporations are some of the
world's biggest, and the Stanford board is a micro
cosm of the American ruling class.
Oil is the "Cinderella" industry of Southeast
Asia — particularly in Indonesia, since the coup
and massacre of 1965-66. Close to 25 American
firms have received concession rights in the last
three years. And Stanford's trustees have been in
the forefront of this oil rush.
Shell Oil, whose president, Richard McCurdy,
sits on the Stanford board, has recently returned to
Indonesia. Shell is also drilling oil the coasts of
Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Brunei (also on
Borneo). In addition, Shell runs the largest refinery
in Southeast Asia in Singapore. Union Oil of Cali-

in northeastern Thailand — the center of the cur

dent, Lawrence Kimpton, sits on the board at Stan
ford, also has a concession in the Gulf of Siam.
The trustee's firms are active in other industries,
as well. Castle & Cooke, whose director, Ernest Ar
buckle, is 011 the Stanford board, is planning to set
up a banana plantation in the Philippines. Castle &
Cooke also own 55 per cent of the Thai-American
Steel Works in Bangkok.
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, whose director,
J. E. Wallace Sterling, is Stanford's Chancellor as
well as a trustee, owns 34 per cent of Thai Metal
which makes aluminum implements. Kaiser, in part
nership with a Japanese firm, was recently outbid
for an Indonesian nickel concession.
U.S. Steel, whose recently-resigned director,
David Packard, was also a Stanford trustee before
his elevation to the Pentagon, is part of a consor
tium which will mine nickel in Indonesia.
Hewlett-Packard, whose chairman, David Pack
ard, was a trustee until last year and whose presi
dent, William Hewlett, and directors, Ernest Ar
buckle, Robert Minge Brown, and Thomas Pike,
are still trustees, has its Far Eastern marketing
headquarters in Singapore.
General Electric, represented on the Stanford
board until last year by its director, Edmund Little
field, assembles electronic appliances in South
Korea and Hong Kong.
Finally, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the world's
second largest commercial bank, on whose board
sits trustee William Hewlett, has branches in
Manila, Djakarta, Bangkok, Saigon, and elsewhere.
Truly an imperial portrait.
Thailand
As can be seen, Stanford's trustees have an es
pecially important stake in Thailand, where five
guerrilla fronts are now active. Chase Manhattan
Bank observed last year that
Thailand promises to be an excellent investment
and sales area for Americans if the rebel insur
gency can be contained.
The need to contain" this "rebel insurgency" for
the sake of U.S. business interests explains why the
Kaiser Engineers and Utah Construction and Min
ing (represented on Stanford's board by its direc
tor, Ernest Arbuckle, and until last year, by its pres
ident, Edmund Littlefield) are building B-52 bases
in Thailand. This explains why the Stanford Re
search Institute maintains a 43-man staff at the
U.S.-Thailand Military Research and Development
Center in Bangkok conducting counterinsurgency
research. This also explains why Stanford education
professor Frank Moore is a member of the Academic
Advisory Committee for Thailand (AACT), whose
so-called "social science" research is in reality used
by the U.S. military to develop effective ways to
repress the Thai insurgencies. And this, in part, ex
plains ROTC.
