# Panthers Keep It Cool; Seale Rally Peaceful
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
NEW HAVEN—Except for the police shooting
off several hundred tear gas grenades, the great
Mayday riot failed to materialize at Yale Friday
and Saturday.
The national press, led by the New York Times,
had predicted for the proceeding week that the
two day convocation aupporting the Panther's
demand to free Bobby Seale would be one of the
most violent riots in American history. Seale and
eight other Panthers are being tried for murder
here.
They exagerated rumors of white hooligans
coming to tear down Yale, the black community
trying to liberate Seale, and report* of white
radicals coming for action.
However, they forgot the Panther's
determination to have a peaceful demonstration
now: to give the Establishment a chance to free
Bobby Seale before they have to spring him.
Crowds Calmed
Time and again it was Panthers, led by Doug
Miranda and David Hilliard who calmed crowds
anxious for a confrontation with police and the
4000 troop* in the area.
The two peaceful afternoon rallies, attended by
15,000 each, were filled with revolutionary
rhetoric by speakers such as Jerry Rubin, Abbie
Hoffman, Tom Hayden, David Dellinger, Robert
Scheer, Hilliard Miranda, Ken Mills (a black Yale
professor,) Jean Genet, and Big Man (editor of the
Panther paper.)
The police and National Guards used tear gas
without direct provocation to clear potential
crowds during the two evenings. The first night
they claimed they had been stoned by
demonstrators, but most observors on the scene
discounted this as an excuse.
Strike
Yale had been on strike the eight days previous
to the demonstrations in support of five demands
including a fair trial for Seale and the eight others,
a day care center, and the end to plans for building

a social science research institute, roughly
analagous to SRI.
By opening up their dorms to all and providing
free meala, the university hoped to keep the
demonstrations peaceful.
It was largely peaceful, hut it was the Panthers
arguments which kept it so. TVey asked the
demonstrators simply to 6hew thair concern, not
engage in fruitless battles with troops armed with
"16's, 14's and Garrards" (M-16, M-14, and M-l
rifles.)
Choose Targets
They argued that revolutionaries instead of
using rocks and bottles should arm themselves and
choose their targets carefully. They also pleaded
for unified organization and plans before going
into "the final struggle against fascism. "
A talk by Jerry Rubin Priday night at one of
the residential colleges was interupted by a black
claiming to be a Panther who said that two
Panther's had been arrested on the New Haven
Green for shouting "Off the Pigs" and being on
the Green after dark.
Responding to shouts of "to the Green", Rubin
reminded the crowd of about 200 of the lawk
forbidding crossing state lines to incite riot, and
said "I recommend that you don't go. See you
later."
Gas Attack
The crowd immediately descended on the Green
and was dispersed by the first of many tear gas
attacks that night.
The next day, Miranda said that no Panthers
had been arrested and that he sustpected that the
unidentified black was an agent-provocoteur sent
by the police.
Saturday night, the police started by trying to
gas a crowd which had gathered to watch a fire.
However, they couldnt throw their grenades far
enough to reach the crowd and the wind was
blowing the gas back at them. Resorting to
canisters, they did better clearing the green after
firing about 10 canisters.

two day convocation aupporting the Panther's
demand to free Bobby Seale would be one of the
most violent riots in American history. Seale and
eight other Panthers are being tried for murder
here.
They exagerated rumors of white hooligans
coming to tear down Yale, the black community
trying to liberate Seale, and report* of white
radicals coming for action.
However, they forgot the Panther's
determination to have a peaceful demonstration
now: to give the Establishment a chance to free
Bobby Seale before they have to spring him.
Crowds Calmed
Time and again it was Panthers, led by Doug
Miranda and David Hilliard who calmed crowds
anxious for a confrontation with police and the
4000 troop* in the area.
The two peaceful afternoon rallies, attended by
15,000 each, were filled with revolutionary
rhetoric by speakers such as Jerry Rubin, Abbie
Hoffman, Tom Hayden, David Dellinger, Robert
Scheer, Hilliard Miranda, Ken Mills (a black Yale
professor,) Jean Genet, and Big Man (editor of the
Panther paper.)
The police and National Guards used tear gas
without direct provocation to clear potential
crowds during the two evenings. The first night
they claimed they had been stoned by
demonstrators, but most observors on the scene
discounted this as an excuse.
Strike
Yale had been on strike the eight days previous
to the demonstrations in support of five demands
including a fair trial for Seale and the eight others,
a day care center, and the end to plans for building

a social science research institute, roughly
analagous to SRI.
By opening up their dorms to all and providing
free meala, the university hoped to keep the
demonstrations peaceful.
It was largely peaceful, hut it was the Panthers
arguments which kept it so. TVey asked the
demonstrators simply to 6hew thair concern, not
engage in fruitless battles with troops armed with
"16's, 14's and Garrards" (M-16, M-14, and M-l
rifles.)
Choose Targets
They argued that revolutionaries instead of
using rocks and bottles should arm themselves and
choose their targets carefully. They also pleaded
for unified organization and plans before going
into "the final struggle against fascism. "
A talk by Jerry Rubin Priday night at one of
the residential colleges was interupted by a black
claiming to be a Panther who said that two
Panther's had been arrested on the New Haven
Green for shouting "Off the Pigs" and being on
the Green after dark.
Responding to shouts of "to the Green", Rubin
reminded the crowd of about 200 of the lawk
forbidding crossing state lines to incite riot, and
said "I recommend that you don't go. See you
later."
Gas Attack
The crowd immediately descended on the Green
and was dispersed by the first of many tear gas
attacks that night.
The next day, Miranda said that no Panthers
had been arrested and that he sustpected that the
unidentified black was an agent-provocoteur sent
by the police.
Saturday night, the police started by trying to
gas a crowd which had gathered to watch a fire.
However, they couldnt throw their grenades far
enough to reach the crowd and the wind was
blowing the gas back at them. Resorting to
canisters, they did better clearing the green after
firing about 10 canisters.
NEW HAVEN—Except for the police shooting
off several hundred tear gas grenades, the great
Mayday riot failed to materialize at Yale Friday
and Saturday.
The national press, led by the New York Times,
had predicted for the proceeding week that the
two day convocation aupporting the Panther's
demand to free Bobby Seale would be one of the
most violent riots in American history. Seale and
