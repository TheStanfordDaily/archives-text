# Attendance Still Low
## Students, Departments Strike 
### 
The strike-boycott of classes
remained effective today, despite
the lower number of students
engaged in picketing and blocking
of classrooms. Many of the
sciences report lower attendance
than yesterday while most
humanities classes were cancelled
or were sparsely attended.

An estimated 6,000 students
stayed away from classes Monday
and Tuesday.
Those schools reporting lower than
normal attendance for classes are:
Anthropology (14% attendance),
Business School (19% Chemical
Engineering (85%), Classics (15%),
Economics (35%), Education School,
Electrical Engineering, English,
History, Industrial Engineering, Law
School (50%), Mechanical Engineering,
Political Science (5-50%), and Statistics
(72% at an exam.)
Normal attendance was reported at
Aeronautics and Astronautics, Applied
Mechanics, Applied Physics,
Chemistry, Civil Engineering, School of
Nur«ing. and Physics.
Cancellations at the discretion
of the individual professor,
occured in many department*. No
department that has not endorsed
cancellation will penalize student*
more than his lost class time.
Those departments that had at
least one or two cancelled classes
are: Anthropology (all but one),
Art & Architecture (all), Business
School, Classics, Communication (all),
Computer Science, Education School,
Engish, Histoy, Industrial
Engineering, Law School, Mathematics
(all), Mechanical Engineering, Medical
School, Political Science, and
Psychology (all).
Students are advised to check
with their professor about exams.
A number of department*,
most in the sciences-engineering,
but also History and
Anthropology, reported blocking
and/or picketing. However, the
incidence of this seemed much
lower than on Monday and
Friday, and no actual disruptions
or scuffles occurred.

Moat of Hie University's
Department* and Schools have
met and pawwd reeolutions. Many
support a non violent strike; most,
but not all, close Qntil the Senate
meets. However, no professor can
be stopped from holding a class if
he wishes. These groups (the
DAILY has received) are:
Anthropology, Architecture, Asian
Languages, Biology, Business School,
12 Chemistry T.A.'s, 29 Chemical
Engineering students and faculty,
Communications, Computer Science,
Economics, Electrical Engineering

Electrical Engineering, and Operations
Research and majorities voting down a

A number of groups voted to
ask ROTC off-campus or no
credit. They are: Anthropology,

Education, English, Music, Operations

Psychology, S»OEC, Speech 4 Drama,

groups voted to retain ROTC credit

Students are advised to check
with their professor about exams.
A number of department*,
most in the sciences-engineering,
but also History and
Anthropology, reported blocking
and/or picketing. However, the
incidence of this seemed much
lower than on Monday and
Friday, and no actual disruptions
or scuffles occurred.

Moat of Hie University's
Department* and Schools have
met and pawwd reeolutions. Many
support a non violent strike; most,
but not all, close Qntil the Senate
meets. However, no professor can
be stopped from holding a class if
he wishes. These groups (the
DAILY has received) are:
Anthropology, Architecture, Asian
Languages, Biology, Business School,
12 Chemistry T.A.'s, 29 Chemical
Engineering students and faculty,
Communications, Computer Science,
Economics, Electrical Engineering
Thermo sciences (class discussion),
Engineering and Design, 60% of
Industrial Engineering, bchooi of
Education, English, Food Research
Institute, Law School, Medical School,
Music, Philosophy, 7 Of 22 Political
Science profs and most students,
Psychology, Religious Studies, SI DEC,
Sociology, Spanish and Portuguese,
German, French and Italian, Speech It
Drama, Statistics, and 23 of the Dean
of Students Staff. Materials Science,
Electrical Engineering, and Operations
Research and majorities voting down a
strike proposal.
A number of groups voted to
ask ROTC off-campus or no
credit. They are: Anthropology,
Architecture, Asian Languages,
Biology, Chemistry (end punitive
clause), Communications,
Thermo sciences (credit), School of
Education, English, Music, Operations
Research (credit), Philosophy,
Psychology, S»OEC, Speech 4 Drama,
and Statistics (close vote). Only 4
groups voted to retain ROTC credit
under supervision of Undergraduate
Studies Committee. Many groups,
noticeably Business, Law, and
Medicine did not consider the ROTC
Issue.
The strike-boycott of classes
remained effective today, despite
the lower number of students
engaged in picketing and blocking
of classrooms. Many of the
sciences report lower attendance
than yesterday while most
humanities classes were cancelled
or were sparsely attended.

An estimated 6,000 students
stayed away from classes Monday
and Tuesday.
Those schools reporting lower than
normal attendance for classes are:
Anthropology (14% attendance),
Business School (19% Chemical
Engineering (85%), Classics (15%),
Economics (35%), Education School,
Electrical Engineering, English,
History, Industrial Engineering, Law
School (50%), Mechanical Engineering,
Political Science (5-50%), and Statistics
(72% at an exam.)
Normal attendance was reported at
Aeronautics and Astronautics, Applied
Mechanics, Applied Physics,
Chemistry, Civil Engineering, School of
Nur«ing. and Physics.
Cancellations at the discretion
of the individual professor,
occured in many department*. No
department that has not endorsed
cancellation will penalize student*
more than his lost class time.
Those departments that had at
least one or two cancelled classes
are: Anthropology (all but one),
Art & Architecture (all), Business
School, Classics, Communication (all),
Computer Science, Education School,
Engish, Histoy, Industrial
Engineering, Law School, Mathematics
(all), Mechanical Engineering, Medical
School, Political Science, and
