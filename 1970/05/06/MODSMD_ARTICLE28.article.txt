# Pitzer's Statement
## 
### 
Events of tl*e post month have made clear to the great
majority of our community that the University has an
obligation to make certain that the conduct of Its
members remains within lawful bounds. Failure to accept
this responsibility can only result in the eventual loss of
any effective University participation in decisions of when
and how law enforcement authority win be brought to
bear on the campus.
Recent violent and disruptive acts on campus
constitute serious grounds both for disciplinary action
through the University's internal processes and for action
In format court proceedings. Criminal acts and violations
of University rules can be dealt with effectively only if
accurate information is available. Identification is a major
difficulty for the police and for the University. Perhaps
the greatest need is for witnesses to specific acts of illegal
behavior.
On Thursday, May 1, I requested such Information
from all members of the Academic Council. I now make
the request to the entire Stanford community, and ask
your support. I stated to the Council, and repeat now,

that if anyone feels he cannot testify, h s stipulation will
be honored, but I hope people will serve as witnesses
when needed.
Written statements may be sent to any of the
following: Dean of Students, Stanford Police Station,
P.O. Box H, Stanford, 94305.
Along with the information which is furnished, a
statement should be included of whether it is available for
use in court proceedings outside the University as well as
before the Stanford Judicial Council.
I make this request because I believe it essential to the
survival of a community such as ours that we be willing to
distinguish between orderly and legitimate dissent—which
we have encouraged and continue to encourage—and
violent and unlawful activities.
This responsibility cannot be discharged by the central
administration alone, but must be shared by every
member of our community. I ask your help, believing that
you hold, as I do, that the welfare of the University and
its members is a fundamental concern to us all.
