# Card Nine Tolls St. Mary's Bells, 7-1
## 
### 
Seventeen Stanford players got
into the act yesterday as the
varsity nine chuckled their way to
a 7-1 win over St. Mary's at
Sunken Diamond.
Loose after two days off and
unburdened by the pressures of
the Pacific-8 race, the Cards
breezed by the hapless Gaels, who
looked like the WCAC contenders
they aren't.
Stanford scored four times in
the fourth on three singles, a walk
and a sacrifice. Dave Edson's
single up the middle drove in two
runs. Continuing his consistent
hitting, Edson was the only
Stanford batter to collect two
safeties, also getting two RBl's.
In the eighth a doyble by Mike
Ewing, a single by Bob Reece and
a single by Jim Coate helped bring
three runs across.
Bob Scott, a sophomore
recently brought up to the varsity,
started and pitched five hitless
innings to get the win, his first for
the big club. Coate came on for
four scoreless frames at the end.
Stanford has two

doubleheaders in Washington this
weekend, and Coach Ray Young
can only take 19 players. He
looked at most of the candidates
yesterday, including Gary
Osterhout at second, Rod Boone
in right, Pat Rusco at first, Sandy
Swanson in left, and Don
Schellenberg behind the plate.
This week's statistics show
catcher Reece leading all regulars
with a .571 league average. Tom
Williams is at .375 and Phil Keller,
Bob Wilhelm and Phil Kelber all at
.333. Kelber, injured ten days ago
in UCLA, won't be back before
the season finales against Cal in
two weeks.
