# Air Force ROTC Unit To Be Disestablished
## 
### 
Air Force ROTC will be
discontinued on campus by June
30, 1971, President Kenneth
Pitzer announced yesterday.
Declining enrollment was cited
as the major re?ison for the move,
which was not unexpected.
A review in which the number
of officers commissioned
"indicates the program is not
viable," was cited in a telegram by
Brig. Gen. Benjamin Cassidy, the
Air Force ROTC commandant.
"Recent recruiting efforts
which would result in production
(of officers) for 1972 are falling
far short," Cassidy said. The
Stanford program has averaged 1 1
commissioned officers annually in
recent years, and less than seven
are expected for this year and
next.
In a wire to Cassidy, Pitzer said,
"I concur in your judgement that
both present and prospective
enrollments are too small to

justify continuation of the unit
here. Consequently I accept your
proposal that the unit be
disestablished not later than June
30, 1971.
"Col. Heinle assures me that all
commitments to presently
enrolled students can be fulfilled
by that time, and possibly earlier,
in which case the disestablishment
date could be advanced."
Lt. Col. Leon Heinle is
commanding officer of the
Stanford Air Force ROTC unit.
There is speculation that Navy
ROTC might also leave the
Stanford campus. Col. Robert L.
Thomas, director of Stanford
Navy ROTC, has said that if all
credit is denied to ROTC classes,
Navy will leave Stanford.
The Academic Council
recommended last Friday that the
Faculty Senate consider tomorrow
denying all credit for ROTC
classes effective next year.
