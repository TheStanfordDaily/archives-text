# Strike Slows Athletics
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Activities on the playing fields
of Stanford were curtailed sharply
by the University strike Monday,
but were beginning to return to
normal yesterday. An informal
Daily survey revealed the strike's
varying impact on the athletic
establishment.
At the Department of Athletics
Building, which also houses ROTC
offices, a group of twenty to
thirty demonstrators impeded
entrance Monday to all without
official business in the
department. In addition, several
athletice, including Wade Killefer
and Pete Seymour, were on hand
to help recognize those with
legitimate business inside.
Secretaries Split
Many of the secretaries who
work within the building
experienced difficulty entering
Monday morning and most were
sent home at noon. But Robert
Young, assistant director of
athletics, said that "As long as
they don't keep us out, we will
maintain our regular services."
At a Monday noon meeting of
coaches the feeling was not to

close down, Young said.
Nevertheless, the curtailment of
activities will be up to individual
coaches and team members.
Office activities had returned to
normal by Tuesday.
No changes were anticipated in
the week's slim sports schedule,
which included a baseball game
here yesterday and tennis matches
set for Thursday.
At the gym store, business was
reported to be considerably
slower than normal. Other
facilities, such as the pools and
golf course, remain open.
The intramural office reported
that there would be no changes in
the week's schedule. But
participation at the annual IM
track meet Monday was about
half of normal, a spokesman said.
Classes Cut
Tennis coach Dick Gould
reported attendance only about a
third of normal in a physical
education class.
There was no formal varsity or
JV baseball practice Monday as
most team members took a
previously scheduled day off.

Attendance at a varsity game
yesterday was extremely slim.
At 3 p.m. Monday only two
athletes were to be found in
Stanford's vast Stadium. "This is
part of my daily routine," said
hurdler John Anderson, "I'm
working out for myself." Runner
Chuck Francis concurred, saying
that the Monday workouts, in
preparation lor Saturday s
Pacific-8 Relays in Los Angeles,
were voluntary anyway. Some
other track members worked out
on Angell Field.
Gridders Continue
Spring football practice is
proceeding as usual, five days a
week for two and a hali hours.
Tight end Ron Kadziel pointed
out that many football players
"Can't get involved because we
don't have the time. It's a sad
thing. I'm really for the strike."
The athletic department has
never requested athletes to avoid
protests, Kadziel said.
Five varsity tennis players were
competing in the Central
California Championships in
Sacramento, and several others
were practicing on the Stanford
courts Monday. Tennis Coach
Gould said that the team had been
given Monday and yesterday off.
Most athletes interviewed
expressed the opinion that
practice was out of place in the
current situation but that it would
probably go on anyway.
