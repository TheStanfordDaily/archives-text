# Allies Launch New Attack
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — American
armored columns slashed across
the Cambodian border Wednesday
in the fourth major foray into
Cambodia under the go-ahead
declared by President Nixon last
week.
A vanguard of 3,000 soldiers
plunged into the Parrot's Beak
area 45 miles west-northwest of
Saigon.
A U.S. Command spokesman
said the new attack was "a
continuation of the previously
announced action ... to deny the
enemy use of supply and training
bases in the Parrot's Beak area of
Cambodia."
In Washington, President
Nixon, meeting with senators and
congressmen, told them all
American troops would be out of
Cambodia by June 30. He also
assured them the troops would go
no deeper than 21.7 miles into
Cambodia.
Jet fighter-bombers paved the
way for the new assault by troops
of the U.S. 25th Infantry division
who cracked across the frontier at
dawn.
The new thrust was into the
heart of the area between two
other massive allied forces that
crossed into Cambodia last
Thursday and Friday.
Yesterday, U.S. troops opened
another front in Cambodia,
moving across the frontier in the
central highlands 230 miles north
of Saigon. About 6,000 allied
troops were posted for that joint
operation but bad weather and
heavy ground fire restricted the
initial helpcopter assault force to
500 American soldiers.
If they are all committed, it

will place nearly 35,000 allied
troops in Cambodia along the
frontier from the Parrot's Beak to
the highlands.
The first heavy enemy
resistance since American troops
poured into Cambodia Friday
came at Snuol, in the Fishhook
operation being conducted by
8,000 U.S. and 2,000 South
Vietnamese troops.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Pentagon disclosed Tuesday that
U.S. warplanes carried out
four-not three as previously
reported-large-scale air strikes
against North Vietnamese
anti-aircraft gun and missile
positions over the weekend.
Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird and other top Pentagon
officials had no knowledge of the
fourth raid until Tuesday,
according to Asst. Secretary
Daniel Z. Henkin.
Henkin said he didn't know
why information on the fourth
raid was not available Monday
when he announced that the series
of attacks on North Vietnam
targets ended with only three "I
erred ... I apologize to you for
my mistake," he told reporters.
Meanwhile, Pentagon sources said
efforts were being made to find
out why this information was not
available.
The fourth strike was by
between 75 and 90 planes in the
Mu Gia Pass area around midnight
Saturday, Washington time. It was
at the same general time and of
the same general magnitude as the

three other raids reported Monday
against targets just north of the
Demilitarized Zone and in the
areas of the Barthelemy and Ban
Karai passes, according to the
Pentagon.
Primaries
Republican Ohio Gov. James A.
Rhodes fashioned a sizable lead
last night in his race for
nomination to the Senate, and
John H. Glenn, the former
astronaut, was ahead in a contest
for the Democratic spot on the
ballot.
George C. Wallace faced a
temporary standoff in his
campaign to reclaim the
governor's office in Alabama —a
vital step if he is to lead another
third party presidential challenge
in 1972.
Wallace was the leader, but his
contest with Gov. Albert Brewer
was so close that neither man
could claim the majority
necessary for victory.
That means Wallace and Brewer
will meet again, headon, in a
runoff June 2. No man who led in
the first primary ever has lot an
Alabama runoff.
In Ohio, Rhodes led Rep.
Robert Taft Jr. in balloting
clouded by election eve turmoil
on the campus. Four Kent State
University students were shot to
death Monday by National
Guardsmen.
Glenn was leading Howard
Metzenbaum, a wealthy Cleveland
attorney and industrialist who
staged an intensive radio and
television campaign in his bid to
overtake the astronaut.

fourth raid until Tuesday,
according to Asst. Secretary
Daniel Z. Henkin.
Henkin said he didn't know
why information on the fourth
raid was not available Monday
when he announced that the series
of attacks on North Vietnam
targets ended with only three "I
erred ... I apologize to you for
my mistake," he told reporters.
Meanwhile, Pentagon sources said
efforts were being made to find
out why this information was not
available.
The fourth strike was by
between 75 and 90 planes in the
Mu Gia Pass area around midnight
Saturday, Washington time. It was
at the same general time and of
the same general magnitude as the

three other raids reported Monday
against targets just north of the
Demilitarized Zone and in the
areas of the Barthelemy and Ban
Karai passes, according to the
Pentagon.
Primaries
Republican Ohio Gov. James A.
Rhodes fashioned a sizable lead
last night in his race for
nomination to the Senate, and
John H. Glenn, the former
astronaut, was ahead in a contest
for the Democratic spot on the
ballot.
George C. Wallace faced a
temporary standoff in his
campaign to reclaim the
governor's office in Alabama —a
vital step if he is to lead another
third party presidential challenge
in 1972.
Wallace was the leader, but his
contest with Gov. Albert Brewer
was so close that neither man
could claim the majority
necessary for victory.
That means Wallace and Brewer
will meet again, headon, in a
runoff June 2. No man who led in
the first primary ever has lot an
Alabama runoff.
In Ohio, Rhodes led Rep.
Robert Taft Jr. in balloting
clouded by election eve turmoil
on the campus. Four Kent State
University students were shot to
death Monday by National
Guardsmen.
Glenn was leading Howard
Metzenbaum, a wealthy Cleveland
attorney and industrialist who
staged an intensive radio and
television campaign in his bid to
overtake the astronaut.
SAIGON (AP) — American
armored columns slashed across
the Cambodian border Wednesday
in the fourth major foray into
Cambodia under the go-ahead
declared by President Nixon last
week.
A vanguard of 3,000 soldiers
plunged into the Parrot's Beak
area 45 miles west-northwest of
Saigon.
A U.S. Command spokesman
said the new attack was "a
continuation of the previously
announced action ... to deny the
enemy use of supply and training
bases in the Parrot's Beak area of
Cambodia."
In Washington, President
Nixon, meeting with senators and
congressmen, told them all
American troops would be out of
Cambodia by June 30. He also
assured them the troops would go
no deeper than 21.7 miles into
Cambodia.
Jet fighter-bombers paved the
way for the new assault by troops
of the U.S. 25th Infantry division
who cracked across the frontier at
dawn.
The new thrust was into the
heart of the area between two
other massive allied forces that
crossed into Cambodia last
Thursday and Friday.
Yesterday, U.S. troops opened
another front in Cambodia,
moving across the frontier in the
central highlands 230 miles north
of Saigon. About 6,000 allied
troops were posted for that joint
operation but bad weather and
heavy ground fire restricted the
initial helpcopter assault force to
500 American soldiers.
If they are all committed, it

will place nearly 35,000 allied
troops in Cambodia along the
frontier from the Parrot's Beak to
the highlands.
The first heavy enemy
resistance since American troops
poured into Cambodia Friday
came at Snuol, in the Fishhook
operation being conducted by
8,000 U.S. and 2,000 South
Vietnamese troops.
