# University At Near Standstill As Strike Action Continues
## 
### ED KOHN 
Stanford remained almost
totally closed yesterday as
students and faculty boycotted
classes, manned picket lines, sat in
doorways and conducted teach-ins
to protest U.S. involvement in
Cambodia and the presence of
ROTC on campus.
Strike leaders indicated that
the shutdown would continue
today. They called on students to
block the entrances to Encina Hall
beginning at 6 a.m. today.
In a meeting last night, the
coordinating committee voted to
tighten the clamp around the
science buildings and to escalate
the general level of the strike.
They also called for a mass
meeting tonight at 7:30 on White
Plaza.

The group also voted to shut
down the News and Publications
Office, effective this morning.
They also mapped plans to
establish a Strike Press Service in
the CHAPARRAL offices to issue
press releases.
Late last night, President Pitzer
issued a statement asking that
identification and information
from all members of the
community regarding illegal acts
be sent to the administration so
that it can be channeled to the
SJC. [See text, page B.|
Low Attendance
Class attendance was low
throughout school. In the School
of Humanities and Sciences, about
20 percent of the scheduled
classes were held. In classes that
were held, attendance was about

Graduate School of Business
reported attendance less than 20
percent of normal in most classes.
Picketing continued in many
places throughout the campus.
Despite fewer persons actually
engaged in picketing and blocking
entrances, the strike was at least
as successful as yesterday. Few
instances of strike breaking were
reported, as most students and
staff members appeared to be
reluctant to cross through lines of
demonstrators.
Teach-ins were held
throughout the day and evening as
students, staff and faculty met to
discuss ways of actively working
against the Indochina War. Groups
ranging from the Physics
Department to the Psychology
Department conducted sessions
on governmental research
contracts, dealing with the
government, and working with the
public at large.
Encina First Target
As was the case Monday,
Encina was the first target of the
demonstrators. By 6:40 a.m., all
doors to the administration
building had been successfully
blocked by striking students.
About 30 employees—mostly
secretaries—managed to enter the
building ahead of the students'
arrival. About half a dozen
employees spent the night in the
building. Overall, less than 100
employees worked in the building
throughout the day.
Demonstrators voted to allow
only three departments—the
credit union, the payroll office
and the minority employment
office —to remain open. They
allowed about 35 employees of
the payroll office to cross the
picket lines. Normally about 100
persons work in that office.
The strikers agreed to permit
the passage of mail in and out of

the building, thus permitting a
return to normal procedures for
distributing employee paychecks.
Rod Adams, of the Controller's
Office, said those who had been
denied entrance to the building
would not suffer any financial
loss. "We understand the
situation," he said.
Barbara Hyland, who worked
to coordinate the entrance of
employees into the building, said
that members of the staff at
Encina were "frightened, even
terrified, of the students." Dwight
Adams, the University's Business
Manager, said, "Not much work
of any sort is being done here
now. We're going to have to keep
all those here focused on the
payroll."
Most demonstrators appeared
sympathetic to the plight of the
employees, but all were
determined to keep the building
shut down. Several students
thought it "educational" that
employees be kept from their
regular jobs. One striker declared,
"By having to confront us and the
issues we are protesting, this
whole lousy war is being brought
home to many citizens that never
even thought about all this. They
simply can't evade us."
ROTC Building Closed
The ROTC building was also
closed by demonstrators very
early in the morning. No ROTC
cadets were allowed to pass into
the building; 50 strikers blocked
front and back entrances. Athletic
department personnel were
allowed to enter the building on a
nearly normal basis.
According to the strikers, only
one person tried to break through
the picket lines. They identified
him as Roger Reed, an FCM
member who resigned earlier this
week as president of the Stanford
Young Republicans. He made
only one attempt to break
through the strikers lines.
Wade Killifer, a three-sport
athlete, and Malcolm Snider, an
offensive guard for the- Atlanta
Falcons, were on hand to
recognize Athletic Department
personnel. Both said that they
supported the strike.
Well Equipped
"Physically, we're the best
equipped to slow things down and
make people think rather than
fight when they tried to enter the
building," Snider said.
For the most part, Old Union
was free of pickets, and the
situation there was reported to be
normal. The Dean of Students
Office continued to operate a
full-time strike information
bureau. A few strikers appeared
early in the morning, but they
said that there were not enough
strikers on hand to block work at
both Encina and the Union.
At the Main Library, more
than 20 striking employees sat
outside the building for the
second day. The strikers said their
absense would not curtail library
services to the general public.
They said they were losing pay
but that their supervisors were not
critical of their actions. While
they were not blocking any of the
library's entrances, they reported
that few people were using the
facilities.
Library Strike
The library strike will probably
spread today, as many employees
who cannot afford to lose more
than one day's pay plan to stay
off their jobs today. In addition,
strike leaders have announced that
they intend to shut down the
Undergraduate Library by placing
picket lines around it by 7:30
a.m. They report that Meyer
employees have instructions not
to cross student picket lines.
