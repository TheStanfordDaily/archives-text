# More Third World Students Join Washington Delegation
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
Forty-one Stanford students
and faculty flew to Washington
D.C. yesterday to meet with
government officials including
Henry Kissinger, David Packard
and Sen. Edward Kennedy.
The student contingent was
enlarged from 13 to 21 at the last
minute as Third World students
threatened to boycott the
delegation unless they were
allotted 10 tickets instead of the
four originally aportioned to
blacks and Chicanos.
At a 10 o'clock press
conference, Third World students
announced "we refuse to join
them [the Stanford delegation]
and refuse to allow the white
moderates to use us as a basis for
legitimizing their efforts to co-opt
the struggle for self determination
of Third World people."

The possibility that the group
would lack Third World
representation was forestalled
when Professor Sanford
Dornbusch and Special
Presidential Assistant Willard
Wyman invited enough Third
World students to satisfy the
demands for three blacks, three
Chicanos, three Asians and an
American Indian.
Delegate Carl Vasquez of
Mecha stated that the Third World
delegates "will be there to speak
for ourselves, even though we are
going to represent Stanford."
The Third World groups made
their demands for increased
representation Monday night to a
meeting of the delegation in
Bowman Alumni House, citing the
total lack of Asians on the
delegation, and the fear that a
white moderate group would

return to Stanford as apologists
for Nixon's Southeast Asian
policy.
When the two sides were unable
to reach a compromise, the Third
World groups called the press
conference to denounce racism
and disassociate themselves from
the Washington trip. They called
for unity among all Third. World
people in their fight for self
determination and urged all Third
World people to support the
National Liberation Front.
Rally Held
After their demands were met,
the Third World group held a rally
in White Plaza to draw the campus
to their cause.
Dornbusch said that the trip
was prompted by agreement on
the "need to approach Congress
with the sense of crisis and need
for constructive rather than
repressive response.
"Millions—and I emphasize
millions—of Americans have a
feeling of collective impotence.
Their loss of participation in
American government increases
the difficulties we face
throughout society," he said.
Professor Paul Ehrlich added,
"We hope to persuade people that
there are others besides students
who share concerns about racism
and Vietnam, not just the small
group. The University has to take
a lead in solving problems. It is
the job of universities to see that
the American people pay
attention to what goes on in
Washington."
Leo Bazile, outgoing chairman
of the BSU, said he was going
because "we have a unique
perspective. Priorities are all
screwed up. Racism is not being
dealt with because of Vietnam
and now Cambodia."
Strike An Asset
Hal Mickelson of the ASSU
Council of Presidents reported
from Washington that the
strongest asset of the Stanford
delegation was the fact that a
non-violent, non-coercive strike
was now going on at Stanford.
The Stanford representatives
are scheduled to meet today with
the California Congressional
delegation, Senators Muskie,
McGovern, Percy, and Kennedy,
as well as officials from the
Department of Defense and the
Selective Service office.
Student members of the official
delegation are: D. Ayer, J. Grube,
B. Askinas, J. Kobayashi, J. Speas,
M. Wolfe, L. Bazile, R. Davis, H.
Mickelson, A. Levin, P.C. Shea,
P. A. Shea, J. Silvester, D.
McHenry, J. Peralez, C. Vasquez,
L. Islas, N. Nagi, N. Okayabashi,

the Washington trip. They called
for unity among all Third. World
people in their fight for self
determination and urged all Third
World people to support the
National Liberation Front.
Rally Held
After their demands were met,
the Third World group held a rally
in White Plaza to draw the campus
to their cause.
Dornbusch said that the trip
was prompted by agreement on
the "need to approach Congress
with the sense of crisis and need
for constructive rather than
repressive response.
"Millions—and I emphasize
millions—of Americans have a
feeling of collective impotence.
Their loss of participation in
American government increases
the difficulties we face
throughout society," he said.
Professor Paul Ehrlich added,
"We hope to persuade people that
there are others besides students
who share concerns about racism
and Vietnam, not just the small
group. The University has to take
a lead in solving problems. It is
the job of universities to see that
the American people pay
attention to what goes on in
Washington."
Leo Bazile, outgoing chairman
of the BSU, said he was going
because "we have a unique
perspective. Priorities are all
screwed up. Racism is not being
dealt with because of Vietnam
and now Cambodia."
Strike An Asset
Hal Mickelson of the ASSU
Council of Presidents reported
from Washington that the
strongest asset of the Stanford
delegation was the fact that a
non-violent, non-coercive strike
was now going on at Stanford.
The Stanford representatives
are scheduled to meet today with
the California Congressional
delegation, Senators Muskie,
McGovern, Percy, and Kennedy,
as well as officials from the
Department of Defense and the
Selective Service office.
Student members of the official
delegation are: D. Ayer, J. Grube,
B. Askinas, J. Kobayashi, J. Speas,
M. Wolfe, L. Bazile, R. Davis, H.
Mickelson, A. Levin, P.C. Shea,
P. A. Shea, J. Silvester, D.
McHenry, J. Peralez, C. Vasquez,
L. Islas, N. Nagi, N. Okayabashi,
B. lice, R. Cross.
Forty-one Stanford students
and faculty flew to Washington
D.C. yesterday to meet with
government officials including
Henry Kissinger, David Packard
and Sen. Edward Kennedy.
The student contingent was
enlarged from 13 to 21 at the last
minute as Third World students
threatened to boycott the
delegation unless they were
allotted 10 tickets instead of the
four originally aportioned to
blacks and Chicanos.
At a 10 o'clock press
conference, Third World students
announced "we refuse to join
them [the Stanford delegation]
and refuse to allow the white
moderates to use us as a basis for
legitimizing their efforts to co-opt
the struggle for self determination
of Third World people."

The possibility that the group
would lack Third World
representation was forestalled
when Professor Sanford
Dornbusch and Special
Presidential Assistant Willard
Wyman invited enough Third
World students to satisfy the
demands for three blacks, three
Chicanos, three Asians and an
American Indian.
Delegate Carl Vasquez of
Mecha stated that the Third World
delegates "will be there to speak
for ourselves, even though we are
going to represent Stanford."
The Third World groups made
their demands for increased
representation Monday night to a
meeting of the delegation in
Bowman Alumni House, citing the
total lack of Asians on the
delegation, and the fear that a
white moderate group would

return to Stanford as apologists
for Nixon's Southeast Asian
policy.
When the two sides were unable
to reach a compromise, the Third
World groups called the press
conference to denounce racism
and disassociate themselves from
the Washington trip. They called
for unity among all Third. World
people in their fight for self
determination and urged all Third
World people to support the
National Liberation Front.
