# Cambodian Non-War
## The 						Pentagon's Myth Of Victory 
### Barry Wood 
To those people who make up
the so-called Silent Majority,
winning a war still means reducing
the opposition to a state of
military surrender. This idea of
"victory" makes sense if you are
either protecting your own
territory or taking over someone
else's—that is, where there is
something real and concrete to
lose or gain. It made sense a
generation ago when "defeat"
would have meant a global
takeover by the allied forces of
Germany, Japan, and Italy.
But a new kind of war has
appeared with Vietnam. We have
no territory in Southeast Asia to
"win" or "lose." Thus the
Administration has had to resort
to pseudo-logic by saying that we
must invade Cambodia to
"protect" our troops in Vietnam.
Johnson used to say the same
thing about the bombing of the
north, and Nixon justified the
recent bombing raids over the
north as protection for our
reconnaissance planes being shot
down over their land.

By this kind of logic we should
perhaps parachute a few
planeloads of troops into central
China and declare war on that
nation as a means of "protecting"
our forces. The kind of thinking
now coming out of the Pentagon
strikes me as foolish in the
extreme. How can any intelligent
President say to North Vietnam
that if there is any retaliation for
the Cambodian invasion, he will
take whatever action is
appropriate?
Nixon is squirming of course.
He is trying to figure out how to
launch the last raft of marines off
south Vietnam without having it
riddled with VC bullets. This, of
course, would amount to "defeat"
by VC and American standards.
North Vietnam would claim they
drove the "U.S. imperialists" out
of Southeast Asia and would
chalk up a "victory," which they
will do in any case. And it will be
a real victory for them, since it
will be the recovery of something
real—territory.

There is, in other words, no
way for the U.S. to gain a victory,
since this is a kind of Non-War
fought for abstract principles like
"containing communism." We all
suspect that communism cannot
be contained in that part of the
world and so saving face while we
pull out becomes an exercise in
the non-logic of the political ploy.
This non-logic abroad is
matched at home by another kind
of non-logic which scores points
by phrases like Agnew's
latest — ' 'tomentose
exhibitionists." Tomentose means
covered with densely matted hair,
so that war protestors are
effectively put-down by giving
them the status of a prancing
sheep dog in heat.
There is another way to "win"
a war and that is by leaving the
enemy no one to fight. One way
to prove our (first rate) "power"
is to have the strength to live by
moral principles rather than
military ones. One way to win is
to win in America by using our
resources for real things—more

housing units, reduced pollution
levels, fewer street riots—rather
than abstract issues like tonnages
of dropped bombs or thousands
of dead VC.
Immediate Victory
Immediate withdrawal would
constitute a victory of the highest
sort. It would mean that we have
risen above bestiality. It would
mean that we refuse to sacrifice
our humanity by putting it behind
a gun. It would mean that we are
intent on building the earth while
we still have an earth to build. It
would be an affirmation that
people are what matter, and that
there must be, somewhere, a
stronghold—not of military might
but of moral strength.
Let the North Vietnamese
claim what they like. Let them
say we ran, let them say we lost,
let them say we were humiliated.
Beneath the facade we can be sure
they will know better. The might
that grows out of a gun barrel is
worth fighting against, but it is
not worth fighting for.
Some will say this
neo-isolationist thinking, a return
to the thirties. But our present
policy of involvement around the
world, while it may be
idealistically well-founded, has
turned out to be a military
impossibility. Our landscape and
our cities are in dangerous
disrepair.
Third World Needs
Some will think that this is
selfishness on the part of America,
a withdrawal from the pressing
needs of the Third World peoples.
On the contrary, the ultimate
selfishness is found in a nation
which exploits a civil war around
the world to test out the latest in
the military arsenal. Here the
U.S.S.R. stands condemned too.
The most dangerous myths that
men have lived by have been the
Myths of Power and Victory, the
logic that says we are better
people when we have obliterated
someone else, the argument that
missiles constitute might. It may
be that we have to resort to the
gun when our lives are at stake,
but in Vietnam they are not.
To continue this war is to prove
that we have not risen above the
law of the jungle. It is to prove
that we are bestial and stupid. It is
to prove that we are blind to real
issues and willing to fight for
abstractions, that we are enslaved
by false rhetoric and our own
egoism. And, in the long run, it is
to prove that we deserve little
more than the descent down the
long staircase into the darkness of
our own folly.
