I W hat do you £S\
■ want from a
I stereo system?
Good music, of course. Realism that makes
you think it's good as live — or better!
But, besides that good music, you want as-
I surance of two things when you buy:
One, that you didn't get taken — that you paid
a fair price for your equipment, with all the dis
■ counts anyone else could get, anywhere.
And two, that you bought from a reliable dealer
I who will stand back of the equipment if anything
I should go wrong — who will put himself out to
I make sure you get the satisfaction you paid for.
That's why more and more people buy from
I Lafayette — where the VALUES (what you get for
I what you pay) are best and the after-sales service
I is everything you could wish.
