## DOD Q & A 
### Skip Harris 
How much money does
Stanford get from the DOD?
Last year on the order of 15
million dollars. This year
researchers at Stanford have been
awarded 9.8 million dollars. In
other words the amount of DOD
funding is decreasing.
When the Mansfield
Amendment takes effect will
Stanford only have "applied"
research from the DOD?
The Mansfield Amendment
took effect LAST year. It did not
change the nature of research at
Stanford and expires June 30.
(Section 203 of the Defense
Appropriations Act for FY 1970
reads that DOD research should
have "a direct and obvious
relationship to a specific military
function or operation.") For fiscal
1971 Section 203 has been
deleted from the authorization
bill by the House Armed Services
Committee headed by (of all
people) Mendel Rivers.
Does the DOD only support
war oriented research?
It does support a lot of it. More
than 90 percent of the DOD
research budget goes to defense
contractors. If you want to hurt
the war effort shut down
Lockheed. The DOD also supports
basic, non war-oriented research
for several reasons. One of these is
historical. The DOD supported
some basic research after World
War I. Since it was one of the
largest government agencies and
since it had quite a few civilian
theoreticians as advisors after
World War 11, the DOD followed
the lead of the Office of Naval
Research and began to seriously
fund university research in the
late 1940'5. A few years later
government agencies for funding
basic research came into being but
they did not have anything near
approaching the financial support
of the DOD.
Aside from the history of the
situation, there are also political
reasons why DOD has funded
basic research. Some congressmen
feel that since the
mission-oriented agencies may
someday benefit from basic
research they should do their
share to fund it.
What kind of DOD research
does Stanford do?
There is no question that the
DOD does not need Stanford's
pitifully small addition to its store
of information. Furthermore,
Stanford has decided that
classified research, certainly the
research most clearly related to
the "defense mission," should not
be done on campus. The last
classified contract expires August
31, 1970. Stanford's DOD
sponsored research is basic, non
war-oriented, and, in many cases,
socially useful. The army, for
instance, sponsors research in the
medical school on the health
effects of air pollution. All DOD
research sponsored on campus is
freely publishable and, therefore,
available to anybody who wants
to use it.
Realistically what effect would
an end to Stanford's DOD
research have on national policy?
If all universities were to stop
their DOD contracts tomorrow
the Defense Department would
feel no scientific pinch. Any
research the DOD wants done it
can get done in industry.
Furthermore, those professors
who want to continue their work
can go elsewhere without the
burden of students or having to
pay university overhead. It is
nothing but egotism to suppose
that the Defense Department
relies on information pouring in
from Stanford.
Politically speaking the action
might have some effect. It would
further serve to demonstrate to an

already angry Congress that the
universities are upset with the
usurption of power by the
executive branch. Whether it
would do more than restate an
already well-known point is
questionable.
Are there other ways of
funding basic research?
There seem to be some on the
horizon. The Vice President for
research has made plans to help
anyone who is interested find new
sources of funding for new or old
projects. Government agencies
have begun to move in the right
direction. Next year, for instance,
funding for the High Energy
Physics Lab will be carried by the
National Science Foundation
whereas in 1968 it was supported
by the Office of Naval Research.
The years in between have been
spent making the change from one
agency to another.
Congressional appropriations
are the problem. It looks like the
NSF budget for 1971 will be
increased but HEW will, at best,
stay the same.

approaching the financial support
of the DOD.
Aside from the history of the
situation, there are also political
reasons why DOD has funded
basic research. Some congressmen
feel that since the
mission-oriented agencies may
someday benefit from basic
research they should do their
share to fund it.
What kind of DOD research
does Stanford do?
There is no question that the
DOD does not need Stanford's
pitifully small addition to its store
of information. Furthermore,
Stanford has decided that
classified research, certainly the
research most clearly related to
the "defense mission," should not
be done on campus. The last
classified contract expires August
31, 1970. Stanford's DOD
sponsored research is basic, non
war-oriented, and, in many cases,
socially useful. The army, for
instance, sponsors research in the
medical school on the health
effects of air pollution. All DOD
research sponsored on campus is
freely publishable and, therefore,
available to anybody who wants
to use it.
Realistically what effect would
an end to Stanford's DOD
research have on national policy?
If all universities were to stop
their DOD contracts tomorrow
the Defense Department would
feel no scientific pinch. Any
research the DOD wants done it
can get done in industry.
Furthermore, those professors
who want to continue their work
can go elsewhere without the
burden of students or having to
pay university overhead. It is
nothing but egotism to suppose
that the Defense Department
relies on information pouring in
from Stanford.
Politically speaking the action
might have some effect. It would
further serve to demonstrate to an

already angry Congress that the
universities are upset with the
usurption of power by the
executive branch. Whether it
would do more than restate an
already well-known point is
questionable.
Are there other ways of
funding basic research?
There seem to be some on the
horizon. The Vice President for
research has made plans to help
anyone who is interested find new
sources of funding for new or old
projects. Government agencies
have begun to move in the right
direction. Next year, for instance,
funding for the High Energy
Physics Lab will be carried by the
National Science Foundation
whereas in 1968 it was supported
by the Office of Naval Research.
The years in between have been
spent making the change from one
agency to another.
Congressional appropriations
are the problem. It looks like the
NSF budget for 1971 will be
increased but HEW will, at best,
stay the same.
(Skip Harris is a senior in
biology and a member of the
Committee on Research of the
Academic Senate.)
How much money does
Stanford get from the DOD?
Last year on the order of 15
million dollars. This year
researchers at Stanford have been
awarded 9.8 million dollars. In
other words the amount of DOD
funding is decreasing.
When the Mansfield
Amendment takes effect will
Stanford only have "applied"
research from the DOD?
The Mansfield Amendment
took effect LAST year. It did not
change the nature of research at
Stanford and expires June 30.
(Section 203 of the Defense
Appropriations Act for FY 1970
reads that DOD research should
have "a direct and obvious
relationship to a specific military
function or operation.") For fiscal
1971 Section 203 has been
deleted from the authorization
bill by the House Armed Services
Committee headed by (of all
people) Mendel Rivers.
Does the DOD only support
war oriented research?
It does support a lot of it. More
than 90 percent of the DOD
research budget goes to defense
contractors. If you want to hurt
the war effort shut down
Lockheed. The DOD also supports
basic, non war-oriented research
for several reasons. One of these is
historical. The DOD supported
some basic research after World
War I. Since it was one of the
largest government agencies and
since it had quite a few civilian
theoreticians as advisors after
World War 11, the DOD followed
the lead of the Office of Naval
Research and began to seriously
fund university research in the
late 1940'5. A few years later
government agencies for funding
basic research came into being but
they did not have anything near
approaching the financial support
of the DOD.
Aside from the history of the
situation, there are also political
reasons why DOD has funded
basic research. Some congressmen
feel that since the
mission-oriented agencies may
