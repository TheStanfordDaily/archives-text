Wyman Correction
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to make a small
but important correction in the
remarks attributed to me in your
May 6th report of the current
strike. While I have always been
puzzled about whom students
expect to deprive by withholding
their scholarly labor, I admit that
student strikes across the country
have considerable symbolic
impact.
I feel strongly, however, that
students and faculty would be
much more effective if they found
a way to project their feeling and
knowledge about American
foreign policy to those outside
our academic community. Provost
Lyman made precisely that point
when he said over KZSU that
what was needed now was a
"teach out" not a "teach in." The
idea that I expressed to DAILY
reporter Dave Brenner was that
the energy used in carrying on the
strike would serve us far better if
it was employed to move
influential parents, alumni and
friends to action. Their political
leverage is essential if we are truly
to change national priorities, and
they must be put to work, not
asked to join us in our immobility
as Brenner reports I suggested.

United We Stand
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is possible that what will be
learned from the nation wide
university strikes is the rather
sordid fact that the students and
the intellectuals are politically
impotent. Nixon needs students
only in so far as they are minds to
be programmed to kill and bodies
to serve as Viet Cong targets. He
does not need student dissent;
yet, because he does not heed it,
it does him little harm.
It is possible that, at best, we
can be nominally effective; we
must rationally consider the most
expedient means of maximizing
whatever limited power wo have.
If, indeed, the United States is
still a democracy, we must focus
our attention on numbers.
Unaesthetic .is it sounds to the
intellectual, quantity is more
valuable than quality. Five
hundred postcards to your senator
are more impressive than one
eloquent missive. Send postcards.
And got people. The effect ot a
university strike is more likely to
alienate the non-academic world
than to ally it. Students have been
striking for years; the public is
jaded to that technique, and, also,
censures same. Window breakage,
police on campus, class
suspension . . . very few law
abiding, Protestant Ethic
capitalists condone any of the
above. Quantity not quality. We
need the support of law abiding
capitalists; we must havo faith
that they are rational, and, thus,
prone to condemnation of
Nixon's irrational action.
We must not close down the
university. That gesture would be
nothing but misinterpreted (i.e.,
interpreted as irresponsible and
destructive). It would help Nixon.
Whatever strength wo havo, it is in
union, it is in dignity, and it is in
rational appreciation of the type
of tactics that appeal to the
majority of the people. The kind
of self righteous pride being
displayed by strikers and
non-strikers alike on this campus
is blatantly analogous to the

uncompromising Nixonian pride
which is determined to win the
war, not to end it.
Tonight the Academic Senate
will prove that it, too, is
impotent; if the frustration in the
face of the inevitable discovery
flares into violence, the university
will be closed, our power
dissipated, and our cause lost.
This is a plea for non-violence, for
rational consideration of the
means of behavior most
appropriate for yielding the
results we want. We must stay
open, because we need
community support; we must not
destroy the university, because it's
all we have. Whoever said,
"United we stand ..." was
probably right.

On ROTC- Clarification
Editor, THE DAILY:
The purpose of this letter is to
clarify an article and
announcement which appeared in
the Daily, yesterday, concerning
the ON ROTC Coalition. We are
not a right wing extremist
organization, nor do we support
the U.S. involvement in S.E. Asia.
The initial concept of the group
was to supply a rallying point and
alternative for those students who
want ROTC on campus, yet at the
same time cannot accept the war
in Cambodia and Vietnam. Some
of us feel this position allows us
to participate in the strike, others
do not. For the more than 2600
students who voted ON ROTC,
we exist.
Terry Fotre
chairman, ON ROTC Coalition
Nationalism
Editor, THE DAILY:
Frustration, already so
conspicuous has spread and
deepened with President Nixon's
decision on Cambodia. Should we
take the familiar cop-out of
attributing his motives to
self-interest and assert that the
only solution is revolution?
Should we attack the problem
without really trying to
understand it? I think not.
Nixon's stated position in
essence is that one fundamental
basis for moral decision is

nationalism: our glorious country
will NOT lose its first war under
his administration. This feeling
may be sincere though misguided
and a major portion of our
populus may have this same
feeling whether or not they
support the particular policy.
The underlying nationalism,
not the detailed strategy, is the
more fundamental problem. Blind
support of a nation, or a
movement, has been the source of
much of the evil, as well as much
of the progress, of mankind. The
same self-perpetuating dogmatism
which escalates the war in
Southeast Asia has polarized our
University and reduced the
resources and the viability needed
if we are to help our society out
of the mire.
The Movement believes that it
has learned violence from society
in order to deal with society. Does
it realize that it has a massive
infection of the same disease it
seeks to fight? The self-righteous
justification of aggression against
our local society is immoral just as
is aggression against a distant
society. It is likely that neither
can succeed but it is certain that
in either case a success is a much
greater disservice to mankind than
a failure.
Nor can we dismiss the local
evil by comparison with the larger
since we must scale it by our
greater influence on its
promulgation. As moral
individuals we must work toward
what we believe is a moral
orientation of society. It is not
enough to select an obvious evil
and reek havoc in the name of
protest. That.can seem fulfilling
to the individual and it avoids the
difficult problems of effectively
moving a sluggish system, but in
terms of mankind it is
irresponsible.
Whatever our individual
polarization, we see great
resemblance of the opposition to
Fascism. Could each of us
compare our own position and
activities with such a despised
system? If your first thought after
that question is that it would be
good therapy for the opposition,
you too many be infected.
