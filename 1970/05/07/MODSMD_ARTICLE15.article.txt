# National Strike Considered
## Med Profs Condemn Nixon 
### 
The Faculty Senate of the
Stanford School of Medicine
yesterday condemned President
Nixon's decision to move combat
troops into Cambodia in a
resolution which called the action
"unwise, immoral, and harmful."
The resolution has been sent to
the representative governing
bodies of all American medical
schools.
The resolution urged "the use
of every legal means to resist the
implementation of this decision"
and stated "we . . . commit
ourselves to pursuing non-violent
means of rescinding this
decision."
The Senate's action was
unprecedented because some
senators believe the faculty body

should be apolitical. In the past,
medical school faculties have, in
general, been conservative about
taking political action.
An ad hoc group of 350
faculty, students, and staff
members of the Stanford School
of Medicine have organized the
"Stanford Medical Community
for Peace" and have begun to act
after the medical center voted
three to one on Monday, May 4,
to suspend "all non-essential
business" in order to devote their
time to "an organized effort to
change national policy."
Purpose Statement
In a statement of purpose
about the strike, the medical

community emphasized:
"The purpose of our actions is
ultimately to influence the actions
of the government. This must be
accomplished by means of a
broad, popular base. If all else
fails, the goal of a national strike
against the government is not
infeasible. The exact form which
this strike would take is unknown
and its necessity is not even
certain. But the need
for—immediate action —is
critical."
A smaller committee has been
formed by the medical
community and has adopted a
goal of "making people aware of
the feasibility, appropriateness,
and potency of a general strike "
National Contacts
The strike committee has made
some preliminary contacts with
labor unions and is working to
secure their support for a general
strike.
The medical community is
also planning to contact the
American Medical Association and
to form a lobby in Washington to
press for charges in national
policy. The medical center hopes
to send its own delegation to
Washington in addition to the
delegation already sent by
Stanford.
The Stanford Medical
Community for Peace passed a
resolution yesterday declaring:
"We, the assembled staff, faculty,
workers, and students of the
Stanford Medical Center strongly
urge the administration of both
the hospital and medical school to
assure all members of the medical
center community that they may
participate in these matters of
personal concern during this time
of national crisis without jeopardy
to their jobs or their pay. We
reaffirm the resolution of
Monday, May 4, that all activities
related to patient care continue."
Letter Explains Strike
The community has also sent a
letter to all medical schools
explaining why the Medical
Center has suspended all
non-essential business.
The letter outlines a program
in which the Stanford medical
community will talk about the
war to local doctors, place
advertisements in local papers, try
to get its feelings expressed in
medical publications and send
letters and telegrams to Congress.
The letter urges the other medical
schools to take similar action
Another committee, the
Speakers Committee, is working
out plans for members of the
medical community to speak to
the academic and lay
communities. At present, this
committee educating possible

speakers through attendance at
the Southeast Asia teach-in,
speakers to the group, and
distillation of appropriate books
and articles.
All of the Medical Center's
activities are being coordinated in
a "Nerve Center," room M 127 at
the medical school. The nerve
center is publishing a daily
newsletter, The Axon, with news
of the progress of all of the
committees.

policy. The medical center hopes
to send its own delegation to
Washington in addition to the
delegation already sent by
Stanford.
The Stanford Medical
Community for Peace passed a
resolution yesterday declaring:
"We, the assembled staff, faculty,
workers, and students of the
Stanford Medical Center strongly
urge the administration of both
the hospital and medical school to
assure all members of the medical
center community that they may
participate in these matters of
personal concern during this time
of national crisis without jeopardy
to their jobs or their pay. We
reaffirm the resolution of
Monday, May 4, that all activities
related to patient care continue."
Letter Explains Strike
The community has also sent a
letter to all medical schools
explaining why the Medical
Center has suspended all
non-essential business.
The letter outlines a program
in which the Stanford medical
community will talk about the
war to local doctors, place
advertisements in local papers, try
to get its feelings expressed in
medical publications and send
letters and telegrams to Congress.
The letter urges the other medical
schools to take similar action
Another committee, the
Speakers Committee, is working
out plans for members of the
medical community to speak to
the academic and lay
communities. At present, this
committee educating possible

speakers through attendance at
the Southeast Asia teach-in,
speakers to the group, and
distillation of appropriate books
and articles.
All of the Medical Center's
activities are being coordinated in
a "Nerve Center," room M 127 at
the medical school. The nerve
center is publishing a daily
newsletter, The Axon, with news
of the progress of all of the
committees.
The Faculty Senate of the
Stanford School of Medicine
yesterday condemned President
Nixon's decision to move combat
troops into Cambodia in a
resolution which called the action
"unwise, immoral, and harmful."
The resolution has been sent to
the representative governing
bodies of all American medical
schools.
The resolution urged "the use
of every legal means to resist the
implementation of this decision"
and stated "we . . . commit
ourselves to pursuing non-violent
means of rescinding this
decision."
The Senate's action was
unprecedented because some
senators believe the faculty body

should be apolitical. In the past,
medical school faculties have, in
general, been conservative about
taking political action.
An ad hoc group of 350
faculty, students, and staff
members of the Stanford School
of Medicine have organized the
"Stanford Medical Community
for Peace" and have begun to act
after the medical center voted
three to one on Monday, May 4,
to suspend "all non-essential
business" in order to devote their
time to "an organized effort to
change national policy."
Purpose Statement
In a statement of purpose
about the strike, the medical

community emphasized:
"The purpose of our actions is
ultimately to influence the actions
of the government. This must be
accomplished by means of a
broad, popular base. If all else
fails, the goal of a national strike
against the government is not
infeasible. The exact form which
this strike would take is unknown
and its necessity is not even
certain. But the need
for—immediate action —is
critical."
A smaller committee has been
formed by the medical
community and has adopted a
goal of "making people aware of
the feasibility, appropriateness,
and potency of a general strike "
National Contacts
The strike committee has made
some preliminary contacts with
labor unions and is working to
secure their support for a general
strike.
The medical community is
also planning to contact the
American Medical Association and
to form a lobby in Washington to
press for charges in national
policy. The medical center hopes
to send its own delegation to
Washington in addition to the
delegation already sent by
Stanford.
