# Court Trial Today For Stanford 5
## 
### 
Five radical activists go on trial
thus morning on contempt of
court charges brought by the
University for non-violent protests
against ROTC.
The five—Janet Weiss, Art
Busse, Michael Sweeney, Leonard
Siegel and John Shoch—face
maximum penalties of 15 days in
jail and $1500 fines. They have
been denied a jury trial.
The University claims that the
five deliberately violated a court
injunction from last spring which
prohibited disruption of
scheduled university activities.
Siegel, Busse and Shoch are
named on the old injunction, and
Weiss and Sweeney are charged
with "aiding and abetting" them
in violating it.
The incidents were visits to
ROTC classes on April 2 and April
7, a demonstration at the
Academic Council meeting April
3, and a mill-in at the ROTC
building April 7.
President Pitzer has been
subpoenaed to appear as a witness
during the trial. ROTC officers
and cadets will also testify. The
trial begins at 9:30 today in
department two of Superior
Court, 270 Orant Avenue, and
will continue for several days.
One of the five defendants has
discouraged interested students
from attending the trial as
spectators. "People should be out
picketing and sitting in doorways
instead," said Michael Sweeney.
"That's how we will win the
demands."
