# Strike Coordination New Groups Handle
## 
### GREG WHITE 
A remarkable number of action
groups have sprung up since
Monday and two groups of
undergraduates and law students
are trying to sort out and organize
each of them.
The most important of the two
coordinating groups is the
Political Action Coordinating
Committee (PACC). Formed out
of a mass meeting held by
Professor Philip Zimbardo and
many graduate students of the
psychology department, PACC
has moved into the role of
organizing all information on
organization , actions,
departments, and other
community moves.
PACC is located in the former
psychology grad student lounge in
the basement of Cubberley amid
Freudian wall graffitti,
psychedelic colors, and a constant
stream of people and telephone
calls. It is in communication with
other coordinating centers of the
Communications and political
science departments, Law,
Business, and Medical schools,
Concerned Asian Scholars, ASSU,
the Strike Press and Coordinating
Committee, and the Brandeis
national communication system.
PACC (ex. 2394) is also

coordinating some 4 8 political
{iction groups that have been
formed since Monday. Students,
faculty, or staff may join any
group.
A sampling of some of the
groups:
—Sell your U.S. Government
bonds. This group is trying to get
people throughout the Peninsula
to sell their bonds as a display of
no confidence in the government,
ex. 2280.
— Telegram campaign.
According to one group leader,
Coleen Rand, "We have got about
400 form letters sent today and
over 100 telegrams. Also, students
went to the San Francisco Airport
and reported some people took
form letters and telegrams to fill
out while traveling."
-Research on Comparison to
Hitler. This group will compare
the present U.S. situation to the
rise of Hitler. It is holding a
meeting of local high school
German teachers Friday in
Tresidder.
—Nationwide strike. Professors
in the pharmacology department,
along with others in the Medical
school, are looking into how to
organize and sustain a general
strike throughout the country of
workers and students.
—Back the Doves. This group
will canvass for and support peace
candidates.
—Stanford ROTC and
Cambodia. This group is headed
by this year's top-ranked ROTC
student. They have made up a
questionnaire to be given to all
members of the three ROTC
programs. It asks 27 questions
dealing with the role of ROTC on
campus, attitudes toward the
strike, and the role of American
military forces in Southeast Asia.
—Public opinion poll. The
group has so far made two
random phone polls in the area
from Palo Alto to San Jose. One
found that 44 percent were for
and 56 percent against Nixon's
Cambodian plan. Another tested
the credibility of CBS news, the
White House, Stanford News
Service, and students. Apparently,
in the minds of most people,
students are least credible.
-Big Money. This group will
concentrate on getting wealthy
men to oppose the war, especially
since many students have direct or
indirect influence on these people.
LAW SCHOOL
There also exists several groups
coordinated by the Law School
Action Committee. Their bulletin
reads "if your way is picketing the
building, get down here and do it;
if that's not your way . . . here are
the ways to translate conviction
into action." The bulletin
suggests:
Congressional action groups
such as mailing notices and letters
to all senators and congressmen;
Education group preparing a
series of studies dealing with the
history of the Vietnam war, the
context of American military
involvement in Cambodia, the
domestic and international legal
issues involved in the war, and
others that students may suggest;
Faculty Action including law
professors researching Congress's
power to control troop
deployment by statue or
budgetary power, and are drawing
up a proposed Federal statute to
implement this;
Lawyers outreach group that
has members speaking to various
law associations and is setting up
meetings with individual lawyers
and local civic organizations.

indirect influence on these people.
LAW SCHOOL
There also exists several groups
coordinated by the Law School
Action Committee. Their bulletin
reads "if your way is picketing the
building, get down here and do it;
if that's not your way . . . here are
the ways to translate conviction
into action." The bulletin
suggests:
Congressional action groups
such as mailing notices and letters
to all senators and congressmen;
Education group preparing a
series of studies dealing with the
history of the Vietnam war, the
context of American military
involvement in Cambodia, the
domestic and international legal
issues involved in the war, and
others that students may suggest;
Faculty Action including law
professors researching Congress's
power to control troop
deployment by statue or
budgetary power, and are drawing
up a proposed Federal statute to
implement this;
Lawyers outreach group that
has members speaking to various
law associations and is setting up
meetings with individual lawyers
and local civic organizations.
A remarkable number of action
groups have sprung up since
Monday and two groups of
undergraduates and law students
are trying to sort out and organize
each of them.
The most important of the two
coordinating groups is the
Political Action Coordinating
Committee (PACC). Formed out
of a mass meeting held by
Professor Philip Zimbardo and
many graduate students of the
psychology department, PACC
has moved into the role of
organizing all information on
organization , actions,
departments, and other
community moves.
PACC is located in the former
psychology grad student lounge in
the basement of Cubberley amid
Freudian wall graffitti,
psychedelic colors, and a constant
stream of people and telephone
calls. It is in communication with
other coordinating centers of the
Communications and political
science departments, Law,
Business, and Medical schools,
Concerned Asian Scholars, ASSU,
the Strike Press and Coordinating
Committee, and the Brandeis
national communication system.
PACC (ex. 2394) is also

coordinating some 4 8 political
{iction groups that have been
formed since Monday. Students,
faculty, or staff may join any
group.
A sampling of some of the
groups:
—Sell your U.S. Government
bonds. This group is trying to get
people throughout the Peninsula
to sell their bonds as a display of
no confidence in the government,
ex. 2280.
— Telegram campaign.
According to one group leader,
Coleen Rand, "We have got about
400 form letters sent today and
over 100 telegrams. Also, students
went to the San Francisco Airport
and reported some people took
form letters and telegrams to fill
out while traveling."
-Research on Comparison to
Hitler. This group will compare
the present U.S. situation to the
rise of Hitler. It is holding a
meeting of local high school
German teachers Friday in
Tresidder.
—Nationwide strike. Professors
in the pharmacology department,
along with others in the Medical
school, are looking into how to
organize and sustain a general
strike throughout the country of
workers and students.
—Back the Doves. This group
will canvass for and support peace
candidates.
—Stanford ROTC and
Cambodia. This group is headed
by this year's top-ranked ROTC
student. They have made up a
questionnaire to be given to all
members of the three ROTC
programs. It asks 27 questions
dealing with the role of ROTC on
campus, attitudes toward the
strike, and the role of American
military forces in Southeast Asia.
—Public opinion poll. The
group has so far made two
random phone polls in the area
from Palo Alto to San Jose. One
found that 44 percent were for
and 56 percent against Nixon's
Cambodian plan. Another tested
the credibility of CBS news, the
White House, Stanford News
Service, and students. Apparently,
in the minds of most people,
students are least credible.
-Big Money. This group will
concentrate on getting wealthy
men to oppose the war, especially
since many students have direct or
indirect influence on these people.
