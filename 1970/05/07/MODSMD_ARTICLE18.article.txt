# House Supports War, Nixon
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” In a surprise turnabout, the House voted
down all efforts Wednesday to restrict use of U.S. troops in Cambodia
thus taking no stand for or against President Nixon's military
penetration into that country.
A administration favored proposal by Rep. Paul Findley, R-111.,
backing the President's decision to send troops into Cambodia to
protect lives of U.S. troops in South Vietnam was approved 171 to
141 and then immediately voted down in a parliamentary switch, 221
to 32.
The approval of his amendment and then its immediate defeat
brought a look of open astonishment from Findley, cheers Irom
House members who had argued Congress should take no act ion on
the Cambodia drive and a stunned silence from the packed House
gallery.
The Findley amendment was a substitute for one by Rep. Ogden
R. Reid, R-N.Y., to prohibit use of combat troops in Cambodia, Laos
and Thailand with no exception.
The object of approving the Findley amendment at all was to
prevent a vote on the Reid amendment. That done, the Findley
amendment was killed as well.
