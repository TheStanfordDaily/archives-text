# Indochina Workshop Blames Bad Policies On Ignorance
## 
### 
Over 800 students jammed
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Tuesday
afternoon for the second session
of the Indochina Policy
Workshops. Two more workshops
will be held today and tomorrow
(see Campus Roundup.)
Many more are believed to
have listened to the KZSU
broadcast of the program which is
sponsored by the Center for East
Asian Studies and by Concerned
Asian Scholars.
Professor John Lewis of
Political Science emphasized the
theme of ignorance on the part of
policy makers in his presentation.
"We don't understand the people
and the political conditions of
Southeast Asia," Lewis explained,
"and consequently the policies we
have formulated with regards to
that area have frequently been
unworkable."
The example Lewis gave was
the Central Office for South
Vietnam (COSVN), the declared
objective of the American troops
now in Cambodia. COSVN is the
political and military coordinating

center for National Liberation
Front and North Vietnamese
activities in the South.
In June and July of 1969,
COSVN prepared major policy
document. Several copies of the
98-page report, entitled COSVN
IX fell into the hands of U.S.
troops and were studied by
American policy makers.
COSVN IX states that the NLF
and North Vietnamese had
obtained the two objectives they
had set for the first stage of the
war-an end to the bombing of
North Vietnam and freedom of
movement over much of South
Vietnam.
The report noted, however,
that these goals had been achieved
at terrible costs. COSVN IX
therefore expected President
Nixon to sense an American
advantage and to sue for
immediate peace. COSVN
believed they had no choice but
to accept the American peace
offer under the best conditions
that they could possibly obtain.
The American government did

not sue for peace.
Lewis believes the Nixon
Administration decided to move
to destroy the enemy forces while
it had them at a disadvantage. The
so-called "Vietnamization Policy"
was formulated.
In adopting this outlook, the
Administration ignored another
section of COSVN, Lewis
concluded. This part declared that
the NLF and North Vietnam
would never allow the South
Vietnamese army (ARVN) to
succeed where American troops
had failed.
Two copies of the COSVN IX
are now available on the second
floor of Meyer Undergraduate
Library.
