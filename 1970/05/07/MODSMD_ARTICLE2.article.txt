# D.C. Group Sees Officials
## 
### 
In its first day, Stanford's
Washington delegation met with
many Congressmen, Senators, and
administrators, and found a mixed
reception.
The Washington delegation
talked with Senators Cranston,
Kennedy, Pack wood, and Percy,
Representatives Edwards, Gubser
and David Packard, Henry
Kissinger, John Erlichman, and
Robert Finch among others.
Reporting back by phone to
KZSU, Daily editor Margie Wolf
said that Kissinger told 15
Stanford representatives that si.nce
he was a former professor, he was
aware of the concern about
Cambodia on the campuses. But
he added that President Nixon
comes from a different
background.
Assistant Secretary of Defense
David Packard, a former Stanford
trustee, told another group that
"The Cambodian involvement
caused more of a ruckus than we
expected."
Kissinger was also reported as
saying that "it is too bad that the
U.S. should fall apart on this
issue."
Only Tactical Questions
According to Wolf, neither
Packard nor Kissinger discussed
the assumptions of the
Cambodian invasion, only the
tactical military reasons for it.
Former Council of Presidents
member Barry Askinas described
Robert Finch, who attended the
Kissinger meeting, as having a
look of "grief, despair, and
exhaustion," during the
discussions. Finch later invited
members of the delegation to
speak with him today.
Members of the Third World
delegation met privately with
Sen. Edward Kennedy. Other
members of the delegation met
with their local Congressmen and
others they knew.

Askinas reported that the group
met "a lot of brickwallism." Wolf
described Rep. Charles Gubser,
who represents Stanford, "not
overly friendly."
Sen. Cranston and Rep. Don
Edwards of San Jose met with
part of the delegation for
breakfast and urged the group to
work for congressional votes on
Vietnam and Cambodia so that
congressmen will be forced to
speak out.
Wolf said that Rep. McCloskey
and five other 'Young Turk'
Republicans "emphasized getting
dead wood out of Congress by
electing those who are responsive
to the will of the people. They
emphasized the 'conspiracy of
silence,' not speaking out on the
issues and being reelected by not
speaking out."
Favorable Response
Wolf and Hal Mickelson
reported that the group saw an
unexpected large number of
important people and was
frequently surprised by the
favorable response.
Askinas said that there were
some who "were aware of the
depths of reaction on campus."
Scheduled for tomorrow are
talks with Sens. Muskie,
McGovern, Javits, and Bayh and
Secretary Finch and Elliot
Richardson of the State
Department. Prof. John Lewis will
talk to a Congressional
committee; other members of the
group with expertise in the area
will talk wiih their counterparts in
the State Department.
The highlight will probably be
the two press conferences. One
with Sen. Hatfield will be taped
by NBC; the other will be with
eight Democratic and eight
Republican Congressmen
announcing a bill which would
immediately cut off all funds for
Cambodia and for Vietnam in
1971.
