# For Winter Quarter
## Summary Of SJC Actions 
### 
The Stanfor 5 Jideial Council,
composed o' 4 students and 4
faculty, plus a faculty chairmen, is
the group responsible, under the
Judicial C* arter, for hearing all
cases of University violations and
recommending suitable
punishment to the President.
To acquaint students with this
important decision making group,
The Daily prints below abstracts
of all decisions made by the SJC
during Winter Quarter.
DISRUPTION: The Council heard
one case left over from the Faculty
Club incident of January, 1969, and
two cases involving the Encina incident
of May, 1969. In the Faculty Club case
the Council unanimously imposed the
same penalty comparable defendants
had received last year.
In one Encina case the Council
voted to impose the same penalty as
had been imposed on comparable

defendants last year — including a
one-quarter suspension. Two members
dissented on the ground that the
suspension was too severe because of
the defendant's special situation since
last Spring.
In the other Encina case the Council
unanimously imposed the same penalty
given to comparable defendants last
year except that it suspended the
payment of a $75 fine because of the
defendant's special circumstances. The
fine becomes payable if the defendant
is convicted of another violation of the
disruption policy—in addition to the
penalty for that subsequent disruption
itself.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD:
Without authorization a group of
persons moved a tractor from a
construction site to a residence cluster
at 2 a.m. one morning. One defendant
was fined $50, but because he acted
responsibly in subsequent aspects of
the episode, $40 of the fine was
suspended on condition that he engage
in no further misbehavior during tho

remainder of his stay at Stanford.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD:
Two defendants, after substantial
drinking, were seeking to enter a
dormitory to meet some friends. They
bent back a screen, opened an
unlocked window and gained access to
the kitchen of the dormitory where
they were apprehended. The Council
directed that each defendant receive a
formal letter of censure from the
President of the University. One
member dissented on the ground that
the behavior was too insignificant to
amount to a violation of the
Fundamental Standard.
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD:
Two defendants, after an evening of
drinking, visited a girls' residence in the
early morning. One defendant kicked a
hole in a girl's bedroom This was
followed by dama 3 staircase in
another residence and the breaking of
windows in three residences. Each
defendant was fined $50 and received a
formal letter of censure. The defendant
who did all the damage was ordered to
make restitution in the sum of $100
and was warned that a repetition of
such behavior during the remainder of
his stay at Stanford would result in
much more serious punishment.
HONOR CODE: Defendant copied
part of his final exam from a student
sitting in front of him, who was
unaware of the situation. After initially
denying involvement, the defendant
admitted his misbehavior and
exonerated the other student. The
Council recommended that the
defendant be suspended. He received a
formal letter of censure and was
warned that if he committed another

Honor Code violation during the
remainder of his stay at Stanford he
might be expelled immediately. Two
members dissented on the ground that
the one-quarter suspension should have
been out into effect.
HONOR CODE and THEFT:
Defendant took another student's
Physics problem set, erased the name,
wrote in his own name and submitted
it as his own. The exercise counted 1%
of the final grade. Defendant received a
formal letter of censure and was
warned that another violation of the
Honor Code might lead to his
immediate suspension.
NON-COOPERATION: One
defendant failed to appear for his
scheduled hearing. A hold was placed
on his registration for Spring quarter
until a new hearing could be arranged.
STUDENT STATUS: In one of the
foregoing cases the Council
unanimously concluded that it had
jurisidiction over an offense committed
by a person who had matriculated at
the University and who was eligible to
re-register at his option but who had
failed to register for the quarter during
which the offense occurred. The
Council also approved a ruling of last
year's Council that it could hold
hearing were not registered. In cases in
which such hearings are inappropriate,
holds will be placed on registration
until the defendant announces his
desire to return to registered status and
agrees to cooperate in the processing of
his case.
THEFT: Defendant was
apprehended stealing $5.00 worth of
paperback books from the campus
bookstore. He was fined $35.
