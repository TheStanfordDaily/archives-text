# Nonviolent Group Moves To Avoid Explosive Situation
## 
### 
A group of Stanford students
issued the following statement
yesterday after confering with Ira
Sandperl of the Institute for the
Study of Non-violence:
President Pitzer and the
Academic Senate:
We feel an urgent need for

communication between the
student body and the
administration before tomorrow's
meeting of the Academic Senate.
Recent .developments at
Stanford and in Southeast Asia
have created a potentially
explosive situation on this campus
and throughout the world. The
present mood on campus is such
the University must respond
positively and immediately to the
present University and national
crisis.
All evidence indicates that
failure to take positive action may
well result in increased violence
and destruction. Therefore, we
make the following specific
proposals:
I. That outside armed police
not be called bnto campus.
11. That ROTC be completely
removed from campus by the end
of this academic year.
111. That present DOD funded
research contracts be allowed to
expire or be renegotiated so that
funding is transferred to other
Depts., That no new DOD
contracts be signed.
The present crisis has made it
clear that continuation of DOD
funded and other war-related and
secret research legitimizes the
activities of the Department of
Defense in S.E. Asia.
For the first time in recent
history, the entire University
community has recognized its

responsibility to the Bay Area and
to the nation. For students,
faculty, and staff, this has been an
experience in real education. The
University has finally been
redefined in terms of political and
social action. It is imperative that
this action continue.
Therefore, we propose that:
1. Normal classroom activities
be suspended. 2. No teacher or
student should be penalized for
not attending his regular classes;
Students may continue
community action for full
academic credit. Faculty and staff
should also be permitted to
continue their community action.
3. Individual arrangements may
be made between students and
faculty for those students who
wish to continue their original
course work.
4. The University be extremely
flexible in order to deal with
individual situations. Therefore,
a.) any student should be
allowed incompletes.
b.) any student may elect to
take a course Pass/Fail, the units
of credit not being included in the
allowable twenty-seven units.
c.) any student may obtain
credit for community action, the
number of units being comparable
to that for which he is presently
registered.
d.) final examinations should
be optional.
The letter is signed by: Bob
Zeiss, Ralph Kostant, Fred Dice,
Marti Leicester, Tamara Hoier,
Betsy Davis, Bill Mahone, John C.
Sloan, Ira J. Sandperl, Bob Tearse,
Chris Flegal, Laurie Jane Horn,
Jessica Feldman, and Stephen
Savitzky.

secret research legitimizes the
activities of the Department of
Defense in S.E. Asia.
For the first time in recent
history, the entire University
community has recognized its

responsibility to the Bay Area and
to the nation. For students,
faculty, and staff, this has been an
experience in real education. The
University has finally been
redefined in terms of political and
social action. It is imperative that
this action continue.
Therefore, we propose that:
1. Normal classroom activities
be suspended. 2. No teacher or
student should be penalized for
not attending his regular classes;
Students may continue
community action for full
academic credit. Faculty and staff
should also be permitted to
continue their community action.
3. Individual arrangements may
be made between students and
faculty for those students who
wish to continue their original
course work.
4. The University be extremely
flexible in order to deal with
individual situations. Therefore,
a.) any student should be
allowed incompletes.
b.) any student may elect to
take a course Pass/Fail, the units
of credit not being included in the
allowable twenty-seven units.
c.) any student may obtain
credit for community action, the
number of units being comparable
to that for which he is presently
registered.
d.) final examinations should
be optional.

PAINT ON!-Stanford artists decorated some of our institutions hallowed walls yesterday. The brightly colored mural,

A group of Stanford students
issued the following statement
yesterday after confering with Ira
Sandperl of the Institute for the
Study of Non-violence:
President Pitzer and the
Academic Senate:
We feel an urgent need for

communication between the
student body and the
administration before tomorrow's
meeting of the Academic Senate.
Recent .developments at
Stanford and in Southeast Asia
have created a potentially
explosive situation on this campus
and throughout the world. The
present mood on campus is such
the University must respond
positively and immediately to the
present University and national
crisis.
All evidence indicates that
failure to take positive action may
well result in increased violence
and destruction. Therefore, we
make the following specific
proposals:
I. That outside armed police
not be called bnto campus.
11. That ROTC be completely
removed from campus by the end
of this academic year.
111. That present DOD funded
research contracts be allowed to
expire or be renegotiated so that
funding is transferred to other
Depts., That no new DOD
contracts be signed.
The present crisis has made it
clear that continuation of DOD
funded and other war-related and
secret research legitimizes the
activities of the Department of
Defense in S.E. Asia.
For the first time in recent
history, the entire University
community has recognized its

responsibility to the Bay Area and
to the nation. For students,
