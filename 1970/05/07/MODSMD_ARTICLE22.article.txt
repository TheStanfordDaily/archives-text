# Strike Information Centers Established

The strike has given birth to
two news agencies, the Strike
Press Service and the West Coast
Information Center, to serve the
need for news of the student
strike both at Stanford and
nationwide.
Charges of managing the strike
news have been leveled at the
national news services by staffers
of the Daily and the Strike Press
Service. "We're fairly certain that
somebody on top is censoring the
news," charged Henry Sayre, an
English major, working for SPS.
Certain important stories like the
burnings in New York are not
going over the wires, he said.
Similar assertions that the
University News and Publications
Office was slanting the news were
among the reasons for establishing
SPS. Sayre stated that with the
SPS, the strike is "trying to get
our bias represented."
Harry Press of University News
and Publication said the
allegations that his office was
reviewing and editing the news
available to outside newsmen was
"absurd." We believe that the
record will show that we are
covering the news as throughly as
humanly possible. We are eager
for news inputs from striking
students. We have in the past few
days been directing newsmen to
the various strike news
organizations and clearing
houses."
The West Coast Information
Center is coordinating strike news
from the three West Coast states
from its office in the ASSU loft.
News of western colleges is
phoned twice a day to Brandeis
University where students are
operating a clearinghouse for
eastern strike information.
The University News and
Publications, based in Encina, was
a special target of strikers as they
attempted fo shut down the
service yesterday. Some observers
think the effort was made because
the head of the service, Bob
Byers, testified against students
involved in the disruption of a

trustees meeting last year. "They
don't like him and they don't like
the news he puts out," said one
student.
The Strike Press Service denied
that it was set up in opposition to
Byers. "A concerted effort to shut
down the University News Service
damages our creditability," noted
Sayre.
