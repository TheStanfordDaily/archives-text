# Bijay Freed

### 
Charges against Bijay Sharma,
Indian student arrested and
reportedly beaten last Thursday
night, have been dropped, the
DAILY has learned.
Concerned Foreign Students
are asking foreign students to sign
a statement at the I-Center or the
table on White Plaza today, in
support of the Yale demands,
expressing outrage at the events at
Kent State, and urging foreign
students to participate in ongoing
strikes, "without jeopardizing
their status in this country."
As a result of the Bijay case,
foreign students have formed a
committee to improve legal aid
for foreign students. The
committee will report its findings
by mail to all foreign students on
or before May 22. The committee
urges foreign students to report to
the I-Center any incidents which
would help specify the needs of
foreign students.
