# The 						Hows And Whys
## The 						Great Recruiting Process 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
(Editor's note: In a two part series beginning today, DAILY sports
presents an informational essay concerning athletic recruiting at
Stanford. Part one is u general overview of the mechanics of the
recruiting process, and part two, appearing tomorrow, will consider
financial aspects of the operation.)

In a little more than five months, on October 10, about 90,000
people will gather in Stanford Stadium to witness a titanic football
struggle between USC and Stanford which will probably determine
the Pac-B's representative to the Rose Bowl. The bands, hot dogs and
fans will all be there but the game will be in the hands of ninety
young athletes. AM eyes of the local sporting world will be on these
young men.
But how did they get where they are? With few exceptions all these
athletes are products of the great recruiting program which is the
nucleus of any major intercollegiate athletic program.
Stanford has almost 750 athletes competing in 13 intercollegiate
sports. Many were sought after by other schools but chose Stanford.
And the basis for many of their decisions was Stanford's recruiting
program. Many people have often wondered how a college recruits
high school athletes and this article will explore the nature of
recruiting at Stanford.
Why Recruit?
The question of why recruiting goes on is fairly self-evident.
Stanford is a member of the Pacific-8 conference, possibly the
strongest overall athletic conference in the nation. Every school in the
conference recruits widely and offers aid to athletes and unless
Stanford did so, they would be unable to compete in this league.
Before looking at the financial nature of Stanford's recruiting
position, the actual mechanics of recruiting will be explored, in this
case for Stanford's basketball program. Although the scope of
recruiting differs from sport to sport, Stanford's basketball program is
fairly indicative of all sports here.
During an athlete's junior year in high school, recommendations of
alumni, friends and coaches are compiled and a list is made of possible
recruits for each sport. For basketball the preliminary list will usually
contain around two hundred names. During the summer preceding
their senior year letters requesting a transcript are sent to each athlete.
The transcripts are then sent to the admissions office where those who
could not be admitted are weeded out. According to assistant
basketball coach Bud Bowling, this will usually cut the preliminary list
in half.
Six-Cent Recruiting
Those who are still possible candidates are then mailed applications.
In basketball, from ten to fifteen of the remaining prospects will be
chosen as blue-chip recruits. These people are given the full recruiting
treatment, including extensive correspondence, telephone calls and
visits to the campus. But unlike at most other Pac-8 schools, the other
80 to 90 are not forgotten.
Although they are not offered athletic aid they are still urged to
apply and advised as to other possible sources of financial aid.
Correspondence also continues with these other athletes. And
surprisingly, this "six-cent recruiting" sometimes pays off when an
unknown comes to Stanford without a scholarship and then
distinguishes himself athletically. Two of the starters on this past
season's basketball team were recruited without athletic aid.
The blue-chip prospects are phoned and corresponded with heavily.
They usually make at least one trip to the Stanford campus. While on
campus, the recruits attend classes and sporting events and are usually
guided around by an athlete in their sport. Sometimes pom pon girls
are called upon to take the recruits around school. The best prospects
are offered whatever aid is available for that particular sport. Each
coach submits requests to the athletic director who decides allocation
of scholarships on the basis of the sport's returning personnel, past
season success and the sport's position in the overall athletic program.
Letters of In ten t
The recruiting culminates in the spring when letters of intent are
signed. These are usually Pac-8 letters which say that an athlete
intends to go to whichever Pac-8 school is designated in the letter. He
can still compete at a non-conference school but he cannot compete
at another school in the Pac-8 without penalty once he has signed a
letter at one Pac-8 university. The real purpose of the letter is to free
the recruits from the great amount of pressure they are under by
schools which are trying to recruit them.
So, what started a year earlier and included a lot of
correspondence, scouting, time and money is ended when the athlete
signs a simple piece of paper in the spring of his senior year.
Stanford's campus is a big point in recruiting and the coaches try to
use it to sway athletes their way. Many coaches claim that the campus

helps a lot in recruiting. Physical plants, including the beautiful new
Maples Pavilion and the outstanding collegiate baseball diamond, are
also big points of any recruit's campus tour.
Academic Reputation
Still, one of the biggest points Stanford uses in recruiting athletes
has to be its academic reputation. Most of the athletes Stanford goes
after are by necessity fairly intelligent or they won't be admitted, and
thus the academic reputation is a big help. Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy says, "Stanford is one of a very few schools like
Cal and Michigan which can offer both academic and athletic
excellence."
But no matter how good a reputation a school has it can't attract
athletes without financial aid, and this is the next area to look at. It
will cost approximately $15,000 to put a student through Stanford
ior the next four years. And since tuition is never waived for an
athlete at Stanford, the money needed for scholarships is quite large.
This year 158 athletes are receiving financial aid, which entails quite a
lot of money.

Stanford has almost 750 athletes competing in 13 intercollegiate
sports. Many were sought after by other schools but chose Stanford.
And the basis for many of their decisions was Stanford's recruiting
program. Many people have often wondered how a college recruits
high school athletes and this article will explore the nature of
recruiting at Stanford.
Why Recruit?
The question of why recruiting goes on is fairly self-evident.
Stanford is a member of the Pacific-8 conference, possibly the
strongest overall athletic conference in the nation. Every school in the
conference recruits widely and offers aid to athletes and unless
Stanford did so, they would be unable to compete in this league.
Before looking at the financial nature of Stanford's recruiting
position, the actual mechanics of recruiting will be explored, in this
case for Stanford's basketball program. Although the scope of
recruiting differs from sport to sport, Stanford's basketball program is
fairly indicative of all sports here.
During an athlete's junior year in high school, recommendations of
alumni, friends and coaches are compiled and a list is made of possible
recruits for each sport. For basketball the preliminary list will usually
contain around two hundred names. During the summer preceding
their senior year letters requesting a transcript are sent to each athlete.
The transcripts are then sent to the admissions office where those who
could not be admitted are weeded out. According to assistant
basketball coach Bud Bowling, this will usually cut the preliminary list
in half.
Six-Cent Recruiting
Those who are still possible candidates are then mailed applications.
In basketball, from ten to fifteen of the remaining prospects will be
chosen as blue-chip recruits. These people are given the full recruiting
treatment, including extensive correspondence, telephone calls and
visits to the campus. But unlike at most other Pac-8 schools, the other
80 to 90 are not forgotten.
Although they are not offered athletic aid they are still urged to
apply and advised as to other possible sources of financial aid.
Correspondence also continues with these other athletes. And
surprisingly, this "six-cent recruiting" sometimes pays off when an
unknown comes to Stanford without a scholarship and then
distinguishes himself athletically. Two of the starters on this past
season's basketball team were recruited without athletic aid.
The blue-chip prospects are phoned and corresponded with heavily.
They usually make at least one trip to the Stanford campus. While on
campus, the recruits attend classes and sporting events and are usually
guided around by an athlete in their sport. Sometimes pom pon girls
are called upon to take the recruits around school. The best prospects
are offered whatever aid is available for that particular sport. Each
coach submits requests to the athletic director who decides allocation
of scholarships on the basis of the sport's returning personnel, past
season success and the sport's position in the overall athletic program.
Letters of In ten t
The recruiting culminates in the spring when letters of intent are
signed. These are usually Pac-8 letters which say that an athlete
intends to go to whichever Pac-8 school is designated in the letter. He
can still compete at a non-conference school but he cannot compete
at another school in the Pac-8 without penalty once he has signed a
letter at one Pac-8 university. The real purpose of the letter is to free
the recruits from the great amount of pressure they are under by
schools which are trying to recruit them.
So, what started a year earlier and included a lot of
correspondence, scouting, time and money is ended when the athlete
signs a simple piece of paper in the spring of his senior year.
Stanford's campus is a big point in recruiting and the coaches try to
use it to sway athletes their way. Many coaches claim that the campus

helps a lot in recruiting. Physical plants, including the beautiful new
Maples Pavilion and the outstanding collegiate baseball diamond, are
also big points of any recruit's campus tour.
Academic Reputation
Still, one of the biggest points Stanford uses in recruiting athletes
has to be its academic reputation. Most of the athletes Stanford goes
after are by necessity fairly intelligent or they won't be admitted, and
thus the academic reputation is a big help. Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy says, "Stanford is one of a very few schools like
Cal and Michigan which can offer both academic and athletic
excellence."
But no matter how good a reputation a school has it can't attract
athletes without financial aid, and this is the next area to look at. It
will cost approximately $15,000 to put a student through Stanford
ior the next four years. And since tuition is never waived for an
athlete at Stanford, the money needed for scholarships is quite large.
This year 158 athletes are receiving financial aid, which entails quite a
lot of money.

In a little more than five months, on October 10, about 90,000
people will gather in Stanford Stadium to witness a titanic football
struggle between USC and Stanford which will probably determine
the Pac-B's representative to the Rose Bowl. The bands, hot dogs and
fans will all be there but the game will be in the hands of ninety
young athletes. AM eyes of the local sporting world will be on these
young men.
But how did they get where they are? With few exceptions all these
athletes are products of the great recruiting program which is the

During an athlete's junior year in high school, recommendations of
alumni, friends and coaches are compiled and a list is made of possible
recruits for each sport. For basketball the preliminary list will usually
contain around two hundred names. During the summer preceding
their senior year letters requesting a transcript are sent to each athlete.
The transcripts are then sent to the admissions office where those who
could not be admitted are weeded out. According to assistant
basketball coach Bud Bowling, this will usually cut the preliminary list
in half.
Six-Cent Recruiting
Those who are still possible candidates are then mailed applications.
In basketball, from ten to fifteen of the remaining prospects will be
chosen as blue-chip recruits. These people are given the full recruiting
treatment, including extensive correspondence, telephone calls and
visits to the campus. But unlike at most other Pac-8 schools, the other
80 to 90 are not forgotten.
Although they are not offered athletic aid they are still urged to
apply and advised as to other possible sources of financial aid.
Correspondence also continues with these other athletes. And
surprisingly, this "six-cent recruiting" sometimes pays off when an
unknown comes to Stanford without a scholarship and then
distinguishes himself athletically. Two of the starters on this past
season's basketball team were recruited without athletic aid.
The blue-chip prospects are phoned and corresponded with heavily.
They usually make at least one trip to the Stanford campus. While on
campus, the recruits attend classes and sporting events and are usually
guided around by an athlete in their sport. Sometimes pom pon girls
are called upon to take the recruits around school. The best prospects
are offered whatever aid is available for that particular sport. Each
coach submits requests to the athletic director who decides allocation
of scholarships on the basis of the sport's returning personnel, past
season success and the sport's position in the overall athletic program.
Letters of In ten t
The recruiting culminates in the spring when letters of intent are
signed. These are usually Pac-8 letters which say that an athlete
intends to go to whichever Pac-8 school is designated in the letter. He
can still compete at a non-conference school but he cannot compete
at another school in the Pac-8 without penalty once he has signed a
letter at one Pac-8 university. The real purpose of the letter is to free
the recruits from the great amount of pressure they are under by
schools which are trying to recruit them.
So, what started a year earlier and included a lot of
correspondence, scouting, time and money is ended when the athlete
signs a simple piece of paper in the spring of his senior year.
Stanford's campus is a big point in recruiting and the coaches try to
use it to sway athletes their way. Many coaches claim that the campus

helps a lot in recruiting. Physical plants, including the beautiful new
Maples Pavilion and the outstanding collegiate baseball diamond, are
also big points of any recruit's campus tour.
Academic Reputation
Still, one of the biggest points Stanford uses in recruiting athletes
has to be its academic reputation. Most of the athletes Stanford goes
after are by necessity fairly intelligent or they won't be admitted, and
thus the academic reputation is a big help. Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy says, "Stanford is one of a very few schools like
Cal and Michigan which can offer both academic and athletic
excellence."
But no matter how good a reputation a school has it can't attract
athletes without financial aid, and this is the next area to look at. It
will cost approximately $15,000 to put a student through Stanford
ior the next four years. And since tuition is never waived for an
athlete at Stanford, the money needed for scholarships is quite large.
This year 158 athletes are receiving financial aid, which entails quite a
lot of money.
