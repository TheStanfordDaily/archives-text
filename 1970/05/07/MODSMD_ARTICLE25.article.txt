# Golfers Face SJS Prepare For Bears
## 
### 
The tear gas never drifts as far
as the rolling hills of the Stanford
golf course. It would take a
nuclear holocaust to disturb the
pastoral setting of spreading oak
trees and glistening sand traps.
Last week, in the wildest surge
of political activity ever to strike
the challenging course, crowds of
squirrels looked on thoughtfully
as exile Paul Rupert led a
Libertarian College class on the
far side of the Sa ita Clara County
line which cuts across the first
fairway.
This week, the Stanford course
reverts from classroom to golf
links as the Tribe hosts San Jose
State before the Big Match with
Cal next Tuesday. Tee-off with
the Spartans is slated for noon
Saturday.
A win over Cal would put the
Indians in a three way tie for first
place in the Southern Division of
the Pac-8 along with Berkeley and
USC.
The Indians lost to USC last
Friday to open their southern
road trip, but knocked over
UCLA Saturday to extend their
season record to 7-3.
Stanford's number one man,
Tom Watson bowed to SC's Gary
Sanders 70-71, but bounced back
to defeat UCLA's ace, Don Truitt
by two, 69-71.
Tom Keelin carded an
impressive 72 on Friday and tied

with John Beers and Larry Cram
at 76 in Saturday's contest.
Stanford defeated Cal in an
earlier meeting this season, 17-10
on the Stanford course, and the
Indians looked sharp in a practice
round at Mira Vista Tuesday.
The Bears will pit Dave Bosley
against Watson in the number one
position Tuesday. Bosley was
defeated last time around as he
succumbed to Keelin 74-78. Cram
took medalist honors in that
meeting with a one over par 72.
Cal will also host the Pac-8
Conference Championships and
the NCAA Championships on
their home course at Mira Vista
the weekend of May 15-16
