# Senate May End ROTC Credit
## 
### 
Amid growing pressure to deny
credit to ROTC classes, the
faculty Senate meets today in its
regularly scheduled meeting.
It will consider a resolution
from the Academic Council
meeting of last Friday asking the
Senate to consider "without delay
terminating ROTC credit at the
end of the current academic
year."
The Senate will also consider
resolutions condemning President
Nixon's action in Cambodia as
"unwise, immoral, and harmful"
and condemning "violence
wherever it occurs."
In February, 1969 the faculty
voted to deny credit for ROTC
courses beginning with next year's
freshman class. It left the details
up to a President's Advisory
Committee on ROTC.
However, in January of this
year the Senate reversed itself,
according to many observors, and
approved a contract with the
Army allowing limited credit for
Army ROTC courses. The plan
approved on a one-year trial basis,
provided that a maximum of nine

units of credit would be allowed
for courses approved by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
The Council resolution asks
that the Senate reverse itself once
again. There is speculation that
there will be some opposition to
doing this largely for fear of
appearing to have acted under the
pressure exerted by the Off-ROTC
movement.
Sixteen university
organizations representing groups
from various departments have
expressed their wish that credit be
denied to ROTC classes or that
ROTC be eliminated from the
campus. Only four have voted to
retain ROTC credit under
supervision of the CUS.
The anti-ROTC movement has
also demanded that the Senate
eliminate ROTC from campus.
Some individuals have hinted thpt
if the fails to respond to
the Ur â€¢-.cil . request and perhaps
the off-ROTC demand, that there
might be violence similar to that
of last week on the Stanford
campus.

However, the Senate does not
have the sole power to eliminate
ROTC from campus. Its powers in
such administrative matters as
extra-curricular activities are
primarily advisory. Professor H.
Donald Winbigler, academic
secretary said the President
"would be strongly influenced by
a consensus" of the faculty.
However, most observers think is
unlikely that there will be such a
consensus on the issue of ROTC.
The three resolutions from the
Academic Council are actually
listed last under new business on
the published agenda for the 3:15
p.m. meeting (it meets in GSB
75). However, all observers of the
Senate agree that there will be a
move to suspend the rules and
consider the resolutions early in
the meeting.
Other items on the agenda for
the meeting include: discussion of
the delegation to Washington
D.C., a report fromCUS, a report
from the Ad Hoc Committee on
Memberships and Privileges, and a
proposed resolution on Trustees'
Shareholders Voting Policy.
