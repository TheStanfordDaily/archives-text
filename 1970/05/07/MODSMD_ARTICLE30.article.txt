# Trustees Move Meeting To SF
## 
### 
The Board of 'IVustees'
regularly scheduled meeting set
for next Monday and Tuesday
(May 11 and 12) has been moved
from campus to the Board's
headquarters in California St. in
San Francisco.
"The meeting is moving to San
Francisco because of conditions
on campus," said Fred Glover,
executive assistant to the
President. He added that this was

clearly the reason and there was
no need denying it.
A final decision on the General
Motors proxy question is
scheduled for this month. In
addition other scheduled business
will include the hospital budget
approval, approval of various
appointments including those of
members chosen to the science
policy committee to SLAC.
Several committee reports are also
scheduled.
