# Sweeney Fined $28
## 
### 
On May 1 the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) found Michael
Sweeney guilty of deliberate
damage to university property and
imposed a fine of $28.
Sweeney painted the word
"Vietnam" on a sign in front of
ROTC Headquarters. He
publically contested the charge
brought against him by the
University, saying the act was part
of a morally justified effort to
remove ROTC from the Stanford
campus. The SJC report on his
case, too long to be reprinted at

this time, explained that
Sweeney's defense did not justify
property damage and found him
guilty of violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The
Council recommended the
following punishment: that
Sweeney make an $18 restitution
for the restoration of the sign, that
he be fined $10 to be paid to the
Dean of Students for use as
emergency funds by needy
students, and that both amounts
be paid before the defendant be
permitted to obtain his degree.
