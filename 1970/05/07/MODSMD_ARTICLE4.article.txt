# Pitzer Cancels Friday Classes As Effective Strike Continues
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Nearly two-thirds of Stanford's
11,500 students stayed away from
classes yesterday as the
student-faculty strike continued
through its fourth day. Late in the
afternoon, President Kenneth
Pitzer announced that the
University had been officially
placed "on weekend status" for
Friday.
According to Pitzer's
statement, his decision to
officially suspend classes, "was
taken to provide a period of
reflection on the extensive
activities and discussions of the
past week and to alleviate the
emotional fatigue which has
become prevalent." Pitzer also
stated that his decision was made
prior to the announcement about
the closing of California's state
colleges and universities.
It appeared that while the
strike was at least as successful as
in the previous three days, fewer
students actively blocked
entrances to major buildings.
After a decision by the Strike
Coordinating Committee Tuesday,
much heavier picketing was seen
around science buildings. Many
students also went into the
surrounding communities to
leaflet and discuss Cambodia with
citizens and various departments
actively participated in strike
activities.
For the third successive day
Encina Hall, Hoover Tower, the
Lou Henry Hoover Building,
ROTC, AEL, ERL, Durand

Aerospace, and Engineering
corner continued to be picketed
and blocked. There were no major
incidents, but a few scuffles were
reported.
Engineering classes and
departments were reported to be
generally in normal session, as
v/ere some of the hard sciences.
Chemistry and physics classes
appeared to meet normally—and
with high attendance, while
biology and geography classes
voluntarily suspended classes and
discussed the events in Cambodia
and on campus.
Most In Social Sciences
As expected, the School of
Humanities and Sciences was
again the largest strike group. At
least five departments were
completely closed down, with all
others having limited programs.
Preceeding his statement about
Friday's shut-down, Pitzer noted
that he has joined 40 other college
and university presidents in
requesting a meeting with
President Nixon concerning the
impact of Cambodia on campus.
The petition was organized by
Harverford University President
John Coleman.
Encina employees arriving at
6:00 a.m. yesterday morning
found student strikers firmly
entrenched in doorways,
windows, and ledges of the
administration building. Once
again, only employees in the
Credit Union, payroll, minority
employment, and campus mail
offices were admitted into the
building.
Employees Stay Overnight
Some employees spent the
night in Gncina, but many
supervisors told their workers to
stay home until notified. Most
employees were urged to attend
the many teach-ins on campus.
Demonstrators were generally
cheerful and courteous to
employees as they denied them
entrance.
For the second day only 35
employees were allowed to enter
Encina. However, many
administrators are concerned that
further disruption of the
administration building by
permitting such a limited number
of workers to enter will preclude
issuance of the next payroll, two
weeks hence. The Daily estimated
that no more than 60 employees
worked in Encina Wednesday; the
administration claims that at least
200 will be needed to get out the
next payroll and handle vital
employee services.
Kenneth Creighton, Controller,
declared, "I have a responsibility
to charge those I can identify with
disruption. This sit-in at Encina
has been counter productive since
the attention of the employees
has been focused on their inability
to get to their jobs rather than on
the issue of the war."
Misdirected?
Many Encina staffers argued
with demonstrators that their
shutting down of Encina was
directly endangering the existence
of the University. One demanded,
"If students don't go to class and
professors don't teach then the
strike is not effective. Why do you
care what happens here at
Encina?"
Approximately 40 students
blockaded the ROTC building
again, with all Athletic
Department personel allowed to
pass through the students. No
incidents were reported between
ROTC cadets and striking
students; no ROTC personel were
permitted to enter.
Discussions also took place
at the Lou Henry Hoover Library
where librarians asked the
strikers why they felt they must
close down the library. The
strikers insisted that the library
contained classified
information—with the librarians
denying this claim.
Pickets At AEL
By 9:00 a.m. more than 100
demonstrators had joined the
picket lines in front of the ten
entrances to the Applied
Electronics Laboratory (AEL),
the scene of last spring's sit-in. As
barricades went up at many
doorways, all access to that lab
and the nearby Electronics
Research Laboratory (ERL) was
shut off.
While many electrical
engineering faculty stated earlier,

that they would not teach class
during the week, many
demonstrators claim, they have
made no moves to stop research
work. Later in the morning, the
McCullough Electrical Engineering
building was partially closed
down.
Most engineering researchers
and graduate students did not try
to enter the closed buildings, but
instead talked with the pickets.
Several incidents, occurred,
however. One bearded engineer
tried to push and kick two pickets
away from a rear entrance to
ERL. He was restrained and later
succeeded in slipping past pickets
at another door.
Rambo Angry
Later in the morning, the head
of Stanford's electronics research,
Professor William Rambo,
demanded that pickets open the
entrance to the "Hewlett-Packard
Electronics Instruction" wing of
ERL. When refused, Rambo said
he \vould report the blockade to
Pitzer and threatened to obtain a
court injunction. Soon afterwards
both AEL and ERL were closed
by Rambo.
Michael J. Spear, a graduate
student in electrical engineering,
received cuts on his fingers and
forearm when he apparently
broke a window while taking
photographs of demonstrators
from inside the McCullough
building. According to witnesses
Spear was attempting to attract
the attention of pickets outside
by banging on the window.
Demonstrators declared that
they will resume the shut-down of
the Electronics Laboratories at
7:00 a.m. today.
Non-Violent Groups
Two groups who continue to
oppose violence on campus, while
actively participating in the strike,
are currently organizing to
prevent an outbreak of violence
arising from possible
dissatisfaction with the Academic
Senate's decisions today. They are
particularly concerned that the
National Guard might be called
into Stanford.
The avowed object of one
group—calling itself the Twain
Coordinating Committee—is to
prevent the National Guard from
coming on campus by organizing a
violence-prevention organization
from within the student
community, and to forestall
University action to close
Stanford and send students home
in the event of violence.
The other group, of students in
the Biology department stated;
"We are prepared to attempt, by
our physical presence, to prevent
fresh outbreaks of violence at
Stanford and to organize or join
with others to this end. If the
university is to continue its
business of elaborating and
disseminating understanding, it
must establish the primacy of
persuasion over coercion within
its own society. It must also stand

for this principle in society at
large.
Statement
"For the latter reason we
support the general campus strike
condemning President Nixon's
actions in IndoChina. For the
former reason we support the call
for the removal of ROTC from
this campus as a training program
fundamentally inconsistent with
our ideals."
In other developments today,
striking students and departments
urged the community to such
varied activity as selling United
States Government Bonds,
sending telegrams to Senators and
Congressmen, and organizing
public opinion polls.
Professor Cohen of the
Sociology department initiated a
drive to buy a full-page ad in the
Los Angeles Times and San
Francisco Chronicle.
Newspaper Ad
The ad, in part reads: "Who is
President Nixon calling 'campus
bums?' They are our children,
yours and mine. Students all over
the country are protesting the
war. A handful are being driven to
desperate acts. The vast majority
are against violence—on campus
and in the world. Calling them
names does not help the
situation—it serves the nation
poorly and intensifies the crisis.
Urge President Nixon to stop
dividing the nation and stop the
war by ending it, not expanding
it."
The Stanford Business School,
during their self-declared optional,
non-coercive strike, was active in
strike organization and
participation; a delegation of 40
students spoke with students and
businessmen at the Association of
American Business Schools'
Convention in San Francisco
They also talked with workers in
many brokerage firms and banks,
while many more involved
themselves in community work
and conducting well attended
teach-ins.
