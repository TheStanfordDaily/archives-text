# Pitzer Cancels Friday Classes As Effective Strike Continues
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Nearly two-thirds of Stanford's
11,500 students stayed away from
classes yesterday as the
student-faculty strike continued
through its fourth day. Late in the
afternoon, President Kenneth
Pitzer announced that the
University had been officially
placed "on weekend status" for
Friday.
According to Pitzer's
statement, his decision to
officially suspend classes, "was
taken to provide a period of
reflection on the extensive
activities and discussions of the
past week and to alleviate the
emotional fatigue which has
become prevalent." Pitzer also
stated that his decision was made
prior to the announcement about
the closing of California's state
colleges and universities.
It appeared that while the
strike was at least as successful as
in the previous three days, fewer
students actively blocked
entrances to major buildings.
After a decision by the Strike
Coordinating Committee Tuesday,
much heavier picketing was seen
around science buildings. Many
students also went into the
surrounding communities to
leaflet and discuss Cambodia with
citizens and various departments
actively participated in strike
activities.
For the third successive day
Encina Hall, Hoover Tower, the
Lou Henry Hoover Building,
ROTC, AEL, ERL, Durand

Aerospace, and Engineering
corner continued to be picketed
and blocked. There were no major
incidents, but a few scuffles were
reported.
Engineering classes and
departments were reported to be
generally in normal session, as
v/ere some of the hard sciences.
Chemistry and physics classes
appeared to meet normally—and
with high attendance, while
biology and geography classes
voluntarily suspended classes and
discussed the events in Cambodia
and on campus.
Most In Social Sciences
As expected, the School of
Humanities and Sciences was
again the largest strike group. At
least five departments were
completely closed down, with all
others having limited programs.
Preceeding his statement about
Friday's shut-down, Pitzer noted
that he has joined 40 other college
and university presidents in
requesting a meeting with
President Nixon concerning the
impact of Cambodia on campus.
The petition was organized by
Harverford University President
John Coleman.
Encina employees arriving at
6:00 a.m. yesterday morning
found student strikers firmly
entrenched in doorways,
windows, and ledges of the
administration building. Once
again, only employees in the
Credit Union, payroll, minority
employment, and campus mail
