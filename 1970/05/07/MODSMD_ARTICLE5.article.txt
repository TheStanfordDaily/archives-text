# 2000 Adopt Additional Demands At Meeting
## 
### 
In a two-fold resolution
adopted last night, 2,000
members of the Stanford
Community voted approval of a
detailed proposal to attempt to
implement the initial three strike
demands, by forcing students to
work.
The adopted resolution added
several demands, requesting: that
the university terminate all
academic obligations, grant
incompletes on request, and give
pass grades to graduating seniors;

and that University residences
remain open and University
resources be made available for
community anti-war activities for
the remainder of the spring
quarter and throughout the
summer.
The group also voted to
demand the termination of ROTC
by the end of the quarter, that all
defense-related research be
stopped, until reviewed by a
committee; and that all
Department of Defense contracts
be allowed to expire and not be
renewed, with the provision that
non-war related research receive
other funding.
The group also voted to secede
from the United States, by a three
to one margin.
The group also passed a
resolution stating "Starting
tomorrow at 6 o'clock, the strike
will ensure that all Department of
Defense research halts at Stanford
until we win our demand for a
committment to end such
research. We urge all engineering
labs to close. If they do not, we
will close them by peaceful sit-ins
at all entrances and other
non-violent disruption.
The group discussed, but never
voted on a resolution calling for
the ban of armed police from
campus.
The group also voted down a
resolution "inviting" students
from neighboring schools to come
to Stanford to join in anti-war
work. A "radical causus" of about
50, which met after the meeting
adjourned, said "since Gov.
Reagan had closed the state
college campuses there would be a
need for a place for people to
organize and implement their
right to assembly. Therefore the
caucus has invited any concerned
person to use our open campus in
our common strucffle."

Lengthy discussion, leading to
adoption of the above proposals,
followed. By the end of the
meeting, only about 500 people
remained.


LET ME TALK TOO: A few of the 2000 strikers who attended last night's anti-war, anti-ROTC meeting in Mem Aud seek
recognition.
