A number of faculty members
contend that admissions
procedures at Stanford have been
affected significantly by Naval
ROTC scholarship awards. ROTC
and admissions staff have denied
the validity of the contentions.
Prof. William A. Clebsch
examined the admissions process
lor both the Humanities and
Sciences faculty and the Study of
Education at Stanford. He told
the Daily, "There is no question
that in the past, ROTC
scholarship status was a
consideration which affected
admission to the University. This
was, however, always a subsidiary
element which affected only a
limited number of individuals."
Prof. Bernard Cohen, who was
a member of the Humanities and
Sciences Ad Hoc Committee on
Admissions which authored a
full-scale study of the freshman
class which matriculated in 1965,
outlined a way in which influence
was felt in the admissions process.
Certain external awards, such as
California State scholarships and
Naval ROTC scholarships, had in
some cases moved applicants from
the borderline "judgment area"
into the admit category.
Douglas Walker, director of
freshman admissions, maintained
that on the contrary, the

University's decisions on
admissions and financial aid
questions were decided separately.
He said that the Navy's "pink
card," indicating that the
candidate for admission to the
University had preliminarily
qualified for a Naval ROTC
scholarship and had chosen
Stanford as his first choice was
attached to admissions applicants'
folders. But, according to Walker
it has not been a factor considered
in the admissions process.
Prof. Merrill Carlsmith, who
worked on the Study of
Education at Stanford report on
admissions and financial aid,
asserted that he had learned in
informal conversations with the
admissions staff that Naval ROTC
scholarship awards were known
when applicants were being
considered and that this
knowledge had entered into
admissions considerations.
Carlsmith felt there was no way of
pinpointing any particular case
where this had happened.
Fred A. Hargadon, Stanford's
new dean of admissions, said that
in processing this year's financial
aid considerations including Naval
ROTC scholarship awards had
definitely not been a
consideration in admissions
decisions.

A recent case, however, shows
that the ROTC program possibly
affects admissions decisions. Last
year, an individual who had
received a Naval ROTC
scholarship was admitted to an
Ivy League college, but rejected
by Stanford. When the faculty of
the college which had accepted
him decided to phase out ROTC,
the Navy notified him that he
should use his scholarship at his
second choice (which was
Stanford).
On learning that this was the
situation, the individual in
question sought through his high
school counselor to find out if
admission to Stanford was
permanently foreclosed, while the
Navy also sought to have him
considered for late admission to
Stanford.
This individual is now a Naval
ROTC cadet at Stanford. His high
school counselor told him that his
initial rejection by Stanford had
been the result of interview
records being lost in the Slafiford
admissions office.
Col. Robert Thomas, chairman
of Stanford's Naval Science
department, said he knew of no
instance of Naval ROTC awards
influencing the admissions
process. He did however recall the
particular cast 1 of the student
mentioned above.

him decided to phase out ROTC,
the Navy notified him that he
should use his scholarship at his
second choice (which was
Stanford).
On learning that this was the
situation, the individual in
question sought through his high
school counselor to find out if
admission to Stanford was
permanently foreclosed, while the
Navy also sought to have him
considered for late admission to
Stanford.
This individual is now a Naval
ROTC cadet at Stanford. His high
school counselor told him that his
initial rejection by Stanford had
been the result of interview
records being lost in the Slafiford
admissions office.
Col. Robert Thomas, chairman
of Stanford's Naval Science
department, said he knew of no
instance of Naval ROTC awards
influencing the admissions
process. He did however recall the
particular cast 1 of the student
mentioned above.
A number of faculty members
contend that admissions
procedures at Stanford have been
affected significantly by Naval
ROTC scholarship awards. ROTC
and admissions staff have denied
the validity of the contentions.
Prof. William A. Clebsch
examined the admissions process
lor both the Humanities and
Sciences faculty and the Study of
Education at Stanford. He told
the Daily, "There is no question
that in the past, ROTC
scholarship status was a
consideration which affected
admission to the University. This
was, however, always a subsidiary
element which affected only a
limited number of individuals."
Prof. Bernard Cohen, who was
a member of the Humanities and
Sciences Ad Hoc Committee on
Admissions which authored a
full-scale study of the freshman
class which matriculated in 1965,
outlined a way in which influence
was felt in the admissions process.
Certain external awards, such as
California State scholarships and
Naval ROTC scholarships, had in
some cases moved applicants from
the borderline "judgment area"
into the admit category.
Douglas Walker, director of
freshman admissions, maintained
that on the contrary, the

University's decisions on
admissions and financial aid
questions were decided separately.
He said that the Navy's "pink
card," indicating that the
candidate for admission to the
University had preliminarily
qualified for a Naval ROTC
scholarship and had chosen
Stanford as his first choice was
attached to admissions applicants'
folders. But, according to Walker
it has not been a factor considered
in the admissions process.
Prof. Merrill Carlsmith, who
worked on the Study of
Education at Stanford report on
admissions and financial aid,
asserted that he had learned in
informal conversations with the
admissions staff that Naval ROTC
scholarship awards were known
when applicants were being
considered and that this
knowledge had entered into
admissions considerations.
Carlsmith felt there was no way of
pinpointing any particular case
where this had happened.
Fred A. Hargadon, Stanford's
new dean of admissions, said that
in processing this year's financial
aid considerations including Naval
ROTC scholarship awards had
definitely not been a
consideration in admissions
decisions.

A recent case, however, shows
that the ROTC program possibly
affects admissions decisions. Last
year, an individual who had
received a Naval ROTC
scholarship was admitted to an
Ivy League college, but rejected
by Stanford. When the faculty of
the college which had accepted
him decided to phase out ROTC,
the Navy notified him that he
should use his scholarship at his
second choice (which was
Stanford).
