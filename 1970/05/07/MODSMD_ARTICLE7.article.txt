Students and faculty must continue and expand their
strike-boycott of the University. But of even greater
importance, this academic community must begin to strike
WITH the school.
Stanford, for all intents and purposes, is shut down, and
rightly so. The school should now serve as a "liberated
teach-in area," at least through the end of the academic
year.
Students are striking at more than 250 schools from coast
to coast. Closer to home, Gov. Reagan announced yesterday
that he was temporarily shutting down the California State
college and university system to "encourage all to disavow
violence and mob action." Horsefeathers.
At Stanford, the strike's focus should shift from the
campus to the surrounding municipalities. Door to door
canvassing, signature gathering, and related activities,
developed last year through the Moratorium, must continue.
We would urge additional, non-violent activities. Over
41,000 Americans are dead, yet the President insists
increased combat will reduce casualties. At the same time,
he has ignored peaceful expressions of concern. Obviously,
more militant opposition is a prerequisite to reversing
Nixon's policies.
The administration, like the students, should be prepared
to take unusual steps. Presidential Assistant Willard Wyman,
touring the campus Tuesday with President Pitzer, said that
he felt that most major universities are finished serious
academic teaching for the year. We agree. But teaching
efforts can be redirected to influence parents and alumni,
even legislators, possibly by inviting them to Stanford.
Many students will devote much of their time and energy
to political actions this quarter. Therefore, we propose that
the University adopt a general system of pass-fail grading, or
one incorporating incompletes and optional exams.
Programs such as these are now in effect at the University of
Pennsylvania and Yale University.
Neither of these proposals would encourage
irresponsibility; rather, they would make provision for
intelligent, meaningful political activities through expanded
use of University facilities.
We should conclude with a word on the question of
ROTC. The Faculty Senate, which meets this afternoon,
cannot immediately "Off ROTC." But it can end credit and
can strongly urge Pitzer to terminate all ROTC contracts by
June.
We feel it should adopt the recommendation of the
Academic Council condemning the U.S. presence in
Southeast Asia.
These actions may not be enough to stop the momentum
built into the "politics of confrontation" which have
disrupted this campus. A failure to adopt these
recommendations, however, will almost certainly lead to
further violence and a total shutdown of the University. It is
probable that Pitzer would close Stanford entirely before
risking the deployment of poorly-trained National Guard
troops and another Kent State massacre.
Courageous and intelligent men are never afraid to change
their minds as circumstances warrant. Recent national and
international developments demand such a reexamination.
The faculty Senate has a unique opportunity to prevent
tragedy.
The University's fate rests with the vote of each Senator.
No action today means disaster tonight.

teach-in area," at least through the end of the academic
year.
Students are striking at more than 250 schools from coast
to coast. Closer to home, Gov. Reagan announced yesterday
that he was temporarily shutting down the California State
college and university system to "encourage all to disavow
violence and mob action." Horsefeathers.
At Stanford, the strike's focus should shift from the
campus to the surrounding municipalities. Door to door
canvassing, signature gathering, and related activities,
developed last year through the Moratorium, must continue.
We would urge additional, non-violent activities. Over
41,000 Americans are dead, yet the President insists
increased combat will reduce casualties. At the same time,
he has ignored peaceful expressions of concern. Obviously,
more militant opposition is a prerequisite to reversing
Nixon's policies.
The administration, like the students, should be prepared
to take unusual steps. Presidential Assistant Willard Wyman,
touring the campus Tuesday with President Pitzer, said that
he felt that most major universities are finished serious
academic teaching for the year. We agree. But teaching
efforts can be redirected to influence parents and alumni,
even legislators, possibly by inviting them to Stanford.
Many students will devote much of their time and energy
to political actions this quarter. Therefore, we propose that
the University adopt a general system of pass-fail grading, or
one incorporating incompletes and optional exams.
Programs such as these are now in effect at the University of
Pennsylvania and Yale University.
Neither of these proposals would encourage
irresponsibility; rather, they would make provision for
intelligent, meaningful political activities through expanded
use of University facilities.
We should conclude with a word on the question of
ROTC. The Faculty Senate, which meets this afternoon,
cannot immediately "Off ROTC." But it can end credit and
can strongly urge Pitzer to terminate all ROTC contracts by
June.
We feel it should adopt the recommendation of the
Academic Council condemning the U.S. presence in
Southeast Asia.
These actions may not be enough to stop the momentum
built into the "politics of confrontation" which have
disrupted this campus. A failure to adopt these
recommendations, however, will almost certainly lead to
further violence and a total shutdown of the University. It is
probable that Pitzer would close Stanford entirely before
risking the deployment of poorly-trained National Guard
troops and another Kent State massacre.
Courageous and intelligent men are never afraid to change
their minds as circumstances warrant. Recent national and
international developments demand such a reexamination.
The faculty Senate has a unique opportunity to prevent
tragedy.
The University's fate rests with the vote of each Senator.
No action today means disaster tonight.

Students and faculty must continue and expand their
strike-boycott of the University. But of even greater
importance, this academic community must begin to strike
WITH the school.
Stanford, for all intents and purposes, is shut down, and
rightly so. The school should now serve as a "liberated
teach-in area," at least through the end of the academic
year.
