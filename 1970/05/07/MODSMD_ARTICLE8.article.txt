## Political Prisoners 
### Miriam Cherry 
There has been some confusion
at Stanford about why the
demand to free political prisoners
is included with the call for the
U.S. to get out of Cambodia now
and to off ROTC at Stanford
now. These three demands are
related.
People are saying about
Cambodia, "How did it happen?
How did we get into this mess?
Why is it that we have no power
to stop Nixon from this kind of
terrorism?" As people see the
insanity of overkill at Kent State
and the Asian massacres, they're
beginning to understand the vast
irresponsibility in this country.
There are political prisoners in
the U.S. today who years ago
tried to tell us that Americans
have invested in senseless
destruction (like tax money).
These prisoners did not wait until
hundreds poured out at mass
rallies before they began to act.
But like people at Stanford this
week, they refused to be
intimidated by authorities in high
places. What we're doing at
Stanford in this strike is no
different from what political
prisoners have attempted: we're
uniting our strengths, putting
aside individual privileges, to
forcefully effect an end to greedy
U.S. expansion and merciless
invasions.
Enough's Enough
U.S. jails are protecting us from
those insidious people who
maintained there has been
something wrong with the system
all along. Like people across this
country this week, these prisoners
said, "Now wait a minute. We're
not taking any more." In a
number of ways these political
non-conformists resisted lies
about this being their country,
(heir constitutional rights, and
their elected representatives.
Some believed they had no
right to criticize the system.
Nevertheless, they went on
making speeches (inciting to riot),
fighting the courts, exposing the
exploitation of big business,
trying to stop police brutality,
refusing to kill Asians in an
undeclared war, and some even
went so far as to smoke dope.
Some of these leaders have
t en persuasive in breaking down
the sickness of isolation bv

bringing masses of people together
to struggle for a common cause.
Like Black Panthers and Los Siete
de La Raza. Besides serving basic
needs of their communities
(feeding, clothing and healing),
they took a stand against
imperialism and assumed it was
their task to help create a new
destiny for their people. Because
they were a colony, the mother
country couldn't let them rise up
from their squalor . . . just as the
U.S. cannot permit a liberation
front to exist in areas of the
world; Cambodia, Laos, and
Vietnam, to name a few places.

Vietnam, to name a few places.

There has been some confusion
at Stanford about why the
demand to free political prisoners
is included with the call for the
U.S. to get out of Cambodia now
and to off ROTC at Stanford
now. These three demands are
related.
People are saying about
Cambodia, "How did it happen?
How did we get into this mess?
Why is it that we have no power
to stop Nixon from this kind of
terrorism?" As people see the
insanity of overkill at Kent State
and the Asian massacres, they're
beginning to understand the vast
irresponsibility in this country.
There are political prisoners in
the U.S. today who years ago
tried to tell us that Americans
have invested in senseless
destruction (like tax money).
These prisoners did not wait until
hundreds poured out at mass
rallies before they began to act.
But like people at Stanford this
week, they refused to be
intimidated by authorities in high
places. What we're doing at
Stanford in this strike is no
different from what political
prisoners have attempted: we're
uniting our strengths, putting
aside individual privileges, to
forcefully effect an end to greedy
U.S. expansion and merciless
invasions.
Enough's Enough
U.S. jails are protecting us from
those insidious people who
maintained there has been
something wrong with the system
all along. Like people across this
country this week, these prisoners
said, "Now wait a minute. We're
not taking any more." In a
number of ways these political
non-conformists resisted lies
about this being their country,
(heir constitutional rights, and
their elected representatives.
Some believed they had no
right to criticize the system.
Nevertheless, they went on
making speeches (inciting to riot),
fighting the courts, exposing the
exploitation of big business,
trying to stop police brutality,
refusing to kill Asians in an
undeclared war, and some even
went so far as to smoke dope.
Some of these leaders have
t en persuasive in breaking down
the sickness of isolation bv

bringing masses of people together
to struggle for a common cause.
Like Black Panthers and Los Siete
de La Raza. Besides serving basic
needs of their communities
(feeding, clothing and healing),
they took a stand against
imperialism and assumed it was
their task to help create a new
destiny for their people. Because
they were a colony, the mother
country couldn't let them rise up
from their squalor . . . just as the
U.S. cannot permit a liberation
front to exist in areas of the
world; Cambodia, Laos, and
Vietnam, to name a few places.
