Today is Saturday, or so decreed K.S. Pitzer, President and
Professor of Chemistry. Therefore yesterday was Harry S. Truman's
86th birthday and the 12th anniversary of Richard Nixon's being
stoned in Lima Peru. Tomorrow, Sunday May 10 will be the 101th
anniversary of Leland's pounding the Golden Spike.
If you have any more news of arbitrary changes in the calendar,
why not call our news office at 321 2300 x4632. If you want to get
rid of the calendars President Pitzer made obsolete, plrasf call our
business office at 327-4150 and place an ad offering them to the
public.
