# Committee To Consider Status
## Senate Terminates ROTC Credit 
### FRANK MILLER PHIL REVZIN 
The faculty Senate voted
yesterday 36 to 8 with 4
abstentions to terminate credit for
ROTC courses effective August
31, 1970, while referring the issue
of retention or termination of the
ROTC program at Stanford to the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC.
The Advisory Committee was
instructed to report back to the
Senate as soon as possible but not
later than June 1, 1970 "its
recommendations as to
termination or retention and, if
retained, future conduct of any
ROTC programs at Stanford,
including in particular such
objectionable features as the
punitive clauses presently
employed."
In another action, termed
''extraordinary and
unprecedented" by many
Senators, the faculty condemned
by a vote of 40 to 7 the "war in

Southeast Asia and our entrance
into Cambodia as acts having
profoundly damaging effects on
the lives of our students and on
the work of this and other
educational institutions."
Without dissent the Senate also
called "for an end to the acts and
threats of violence and physical
coercion here at Stanford" after
unreservedly endorsing the
Academic Council's request to
condemn violence wherever it
occurs, on the campus or off, and
to dedicate itself to seeking out
the problems which trigger the
violence.
All three actions were taken in
response to requests by the
Academic Council meeting of last
Friday that the Senate consider
resolutions dealing with those
issues. Yesterday's meeting lasted
over five hours.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of
Stanford Army ROTC, told the
Senate as it was considering
denying credit, "I had thought we

had worked out an agreement"
that the University and the Army
felt would be viable. "I'm very
pessimistic" as to the outcome of
the contract if this is passed, he
continued.
"If ROTC is going to continue
here it must continue as an
integral part of the University,"
he said. And, he added he didn't
think that would be possible
without credit.
Col. Robert L. Thomas, head
of Stanford Navy ROTC, told the
Daily that it is his supposition as
an individual that without credit,
"the Navy program may have to
be phased out." He added, "The
University must come to an early
decision on its own on whether it
does or doesn't want ROTC. This
is the central issue right now."
The resolution denying credit
for ROTC courses referred to the
Advisory Committee the
consideration of "any transitional
arrangements needed for credit by
those students presently enrolled
in ROTC programs."
It seemed clear that the Senate
wished to allow those students
already in ROTC to continue with
credit but to deny credit for all
future classes.
The referral to the
reconstituted Advisory
Committee on ROTC of the
ROTC issue was evidently an
attempt to let things cool off and
to gather more information before
the Senate actually considers the
issue and to await the results of a

new student referendum on
ROTC.
Several Senators mentioned
that a petition asking for the
referendum had the necessary
signatures and that the
referendum would probably be
held next week. Bob Grant of the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
however, indicated that the
wording of the referendum is very
confusing.
At least two Senators indicated
that they had changed their minds
on the ROTC issue since the entry
of American troops into
Cambodia and that similar
sentiment might reverse the recent
student referendum that narrowly
approved retaining ROTC on
campus.
Prof. Philip Dawson, history,
said at the meeting: "Until the
invasion of Cambodia I thought
the option of becoming a military
officer should be open for the
students. I no longer feel so."
The Senate defeated substitute
motions, one of which, if
adopted, would have eliminated
ROTC from the campus by
making it a "voluntary student
organization." The Senate, by a
vote of 24 to 21, voted not to
substitute for consideration that
motion. The Senate also defeated
a substitute motion that would
have recommended to the
President that ROTC be retained
on campus.
All resolutions on keeping or
eliminating ROTC from tie

campus were worded merely as
recommendations to the
President. The faculty has control
only over credit but its
recommendation on ROTC would
carry great weight with the
President and the Board of
Trustees.
Making ROTC a "voluntary

student organization" would, in
effect, eliminate ROTC, according
to Provost Lyman (as he said
during the meeting).
The ASSU Council of
Presidents, according to Bob
Grant, if they could have gotten
the floor would have supported
making ROTC a voluntary student

organization. Grant said, "If the
Defense Department is unwilling
to accept this, then we don't
think it is appropriate for the
University to make special
arrangements for ROTC.
"The Senate has missed tonight
the opportunity to resolve the
issue," Grant continued. "The
focus of the attention is now on
the Advisory Committee which
has a meeting on Monday. The
Council will testify that the
punitive clause must be eliminated
before any further ROTC
contracts would be signed. ROTC
should exist as a voluntary
student organization."
While the Senate issued a
statement on Cambodia because
of its influences on students and
universities, two resolutions were
circulated and signed by
individual Senate members
condemning in much stronger

language the U.S. position in
Cambodia.
One of these, signed by 52
members of the Senate including
Pitzer and Lyman, condemned
Nixon's action in Cambodia as
"an unwise gamble, a needless
extension of human suffering and
loss of life, and destructive of our
social fabric as an open society."
It urged the "prompt withdrawal
of all American combat and
non-combat military personnel
from Southeast Asia."
The attitude of many
supporting the proposal to make
ROTC a voluntary student
organization appeared to be that
no special arrangements should be
made for ROTC.
However, Arthur E. Bryson,
Jr., professor of applied
mechanics, said: "I think it is
worthwhile to make unusual
arrangements in defense of the
country." And History Professor
David M. Potter said, "I think the
ROTC has served a very useful
function ... It has had the
misfortune of being the whipping
boy of the Vietnam War."
The faculty Senate voted
yesterday 36 to 8 with 4

of retention or termination of the

abstentions to terminate credit for
ROTC courses effective August
31, 1970, while referring the issue
of retention or termination of the
ROTC program at Stanford to the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC.
The Advisory Committee was
instructed to report back to the
Senate as soon as possible but not
later than June 1, 1970 "its
recommendations as to
termination or retention and, if
retained, future conduct of any
ROTC programs at Stanford,
including in particular such
objectionable features as the
punitive clauses presently
employed."
In another action, termed
''extraordinary and
unprecedented" by many
Senators, the faculty condemned
by a vote of 40 to 7 the "war in

Southeast Asia and our entrance
into Cambodia as acts having
profoundly damaging effects on
the lives of our students and on
the work of this and other
educational institutions."
Without dissent the Senate also
called "for an end to the acts and
threats of violence and physical
coercion here at Stanford" after
unreservedly endorsing the
Academic Council's request to
condemn violence wherever it
occurs, on the campus or off, and
to dedicate itself to seeking out
the problems which trigger the
violence.
All three actions were taken in
response to requests by the
Academic Council meeting of last
Friday that the Senate consider
resolutions dealing with those
issues. Yesterday's meeting lasted
over five hours.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of
Stanford Army ROTC, told the
Senate as it was considering
denying credit, "I had thought we

had worked out an agreement"
that the University and the Army
felt would be viable. "I'm very
pessimistic" as to the outcome of
the contract if this is passed, he
continued.
"If ROTC is going to continue
here it must continue as an
integral part of the University,"
he said. And, he added he didn't
think that would be possible
without credit.
Col. Robert L. Thomas, head
of Stanford Navy ROTC, told the
Daily that it is his supposition as
an individual that without credit,
"the Navy program may have to
be phased out." He added, "The
University must come to an early
decision on its own on whether it
does or doesn't want ROTC. This
is the central issue right now."
The resolution denying credit
for ROTC courses referred to the
Advisory Committee the
consideration of "any transitional
arrangements needed for credit by
those students presently enrolled
in ROTC programs."
It seemed clear that the Senate
wished to allow those students
already in ROTC to continue with
credit but to deny credit for all
future classes.
The referral to the
reconstituted Advisory
Committee on ROTC of the
ROTC issue was evidently an
attempt to let things cool off and
to gather more information before
the Senate actually considers the
issue and to await the results of a

new student referendum on
ROTC.
Several Senators mentioned
that a petition asking for the
referendum had the necessary
signatures and that the
referendum would probably be
held next week. Bob Grant of the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
however, indicated that the
wording of the referendum is very
confusing.
At least two Senators indicated
that they had changed their minds
on the ROTC issue since the entry
of American troops into
Cambodia and that similar
sentiment might reverse the recent
student referendum that narrowly
approved retaining ROTC on
campus.
Prof. Philip Dawson, history,
said at the meeting: "Until the
invasion of Cambodia I thought
the option of becoming a military
officer should be open for the
students. I no longer feel so."
The Senate defeated substitute
motions, one of which, if
adopted, would have eliminated
ROTC from the campus by
making it a "voluntary student
organization." The Senate, by a
vote of 24 to 21, voted not to
substitute for consideration that
motion. The Senate also defeated
a substitute motion that would
have recommended to the
President that ROTC be retained
on campus.
All resolutions on keeping or
eliminating ROTC from tie

campus were worded merely as
recommendations to the
President. The faculty has control
only over credit but its
recommendation on ROTC would
carry great weight with the
President and the Board of
Trustees.
Making ROTC a "voluntary

student organization" would, in
effect, eliminate ROTC, according
to Provost Lyman (as he said
during the meeting).
The ASSU Council of
Presidents, according to Bob
Grant, if they could have gotten
the floor would have supported
making ROTC a voluntary student

organization. Grant said, "If the
Defense Department is unwilling
to accept this, then we don't
think it is appropriate for the
University to make special
arrangements for ROTC.
"The Senate has missed tonight
the opportunity to resolve the
issue," Grant continued. "The
focus of the attention is now on
the Advisory Committee which
has a meeting on Monday. The
Council will testify that the
punitive clause must be eliminated
before any further ROTC
contracts would be signed. ROTC
should exist as a voluntary
student organization."
While the Senate issued a
statement on Cambodia because
of its influences on students and
universities, two resolutions were
circulated and signed by
individual Senate members
condemning in much stronger

language the U.S. position in
Cambodia.
One of these, signed by 52
members of the Senate including
Pitzer and Lyman, condemned
Nixon's action in Cambodia as
"an unwise gamble, a needless
extension of human suffering and
loss of life, and destructive of our
social fabric as an open society."
It urged the "prompt withdrawal
of all American combat and
non-combat military personnel
from Southeast Asia."
The attitude of many
supporting the proposal to make
ROTC a voluntary student
organization appeared to be that
no special arrangements should be
made for ROTC.
However, Arthur E. Bryson,
Jr., professor of applied
mechanics, said: "I think it is
worthwhile to make unusual
arrangements in defense of the
country." And History Professor
David M. Potter said, "I think the
ROTC has served a very useful
function ... It has had the
misfortune of being the whipping
boy of the Vietnam War."
The faculty Senate voted
yesterday 36 to 8 with 4

31, 1970, while referring the issue
of retention or termination of the
ROTC program at Stanford to the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC.
The Advisory Committee was
instructed to report back to the
Senate as soon as possible but not
later than June 1, 1970 "its
recommendations as to
termination or retention and, if
retained, future conduct of any
ROTC programs at Stanford,
including in particular such
objectionable features as the
punitive clauses presently
employed."
In another action, termed
''extraordinary and
unprecedented" by many
Senators, the faculty condemned
by a vote of 40 to 7 the "war in

Southeast Asia and our entrance
into Cambodia as acts having
profoundly damaging effects on
the lives of our students and on
the work of this and other
educational institutions."
Without dissent the Senate also
called "for an end to the acts and
threats of violence and physical
coercion here at Stanford" after
unreservedly endorsing the
Academic Council's request to
condemn violence wherever it
occurs, on the campus or off, and
to dedicate itself to seeking out
the problems which trigger the
violence.
All three actions were taken in
response to requests by the
Academic Council meeting of last
Friday that the Senate consider
resolutions dealing with those
issues. Yesterday's meeting lasted
over five hours.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of
Stanford Army ROTC, told the
Senate as it was considering
denying credit, "I had thought we

had worked out an agreement"
that the University and the Army
felt would be viable. "I'm very
pessimistic" as to the outcome of
the contract if this is passed, he
continued.
"If ROTC is going to continue
here it must continue as an
integral part of the University,"
he said. And, he added he didn't
think that would be possible
without credit.
Col. Robert L. Thomas, head
of Stanford Navy ROTC, told the
Daily that it is his supposition as
an individual that without credit,
"the Navy program may have to
be phased out." He added, "The
University must come to an early
decision on its own on whether it
does or doesn't want ROTC. This
is the central issue right now."
The resolution denying credit
for ROTC courses referred to the
Advisory Committee the
consideration of "any transitional
arrangements needed for credit by
those students presently enrolled
in ROTC programs."
It seemed clear that the Senate
wished to allow those students
already in ROTC to continue with
credit but to deny credit for all
future classes.
The referral to the
reconstituted Advisory
Committee on ROTC of the
ROTC issue was evidently an
attempt to let things cool off and
to gather more information before
the Senate actually considers the
issue and to await the results of a

new student referendum on
ROTC.
Several Senators mentioned
that a petition asking for the
referendum had the necessary
signatures and that the
referendum would probably be
held next week. Bob Grant of the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
however, indicated that the
wording of the referendum is very
confusing.
At least two Senators indicated
that they had changed their minds
on the ROTC issue since the entry
of American troops into
Cambodia and that similar
sentiment might reverse the recent
student referendum that narrowly
approved retaining ROTC on
campus.
Prof. Philip Dawson, history,
said at the meeting: "Until the
invasion of Cambodia I thought
the option of becoming a military
officer should be open for the
students. I no longer feel so."
The Senate defeated substitute
motions, one of which, if
adopted, would have eliminated
ROTC from the campus by
making it a "voluntary student
organization." The Senate, by a
vote of 24 to 21, voted not to
substitute for consideration that
motion. The Senate also defeated
a substitute motion that would
have recommended to the
President that ROTC be retained
on campus.
All resolutions on keeping or
eliminating ROTC from tie

campus were worded merely as
recommendations to the
President. The faculty has control
only over credit but its
recommendation on ROTC would
carry great weight with the
President and the Board of
Trustees.
Making ROTC a "voluntary

student organization" would, in
effect, eliminate ROTC, according
to Provost Lyman (as he said
during the meeting).
The ASSU Council of
Presidents, according to Bob
Grant, if they could have gotten
the floor would have supported
making ROTC a voluntary student

organization. Grant said, "If the
Defense Department is unwilling
to accept this, then we don't
think it is appropriate for the
University to make special
arrangements for ROTC.
"The Senate has missed tonight
the opportunity to resolve the
issue," Grant continued. "The
focus of the attention is now on
the Advisory Committee which
has a meeting on Monday. The
Council will testify that the
punitive clause must be eliminated
before any further ROTC
contracts would be signed. ROTC
should exist as a voluntary
student organization."
While the Senate issued a
statement on Cambodia because
of its influences on students and
universities, two resolutions were
circulated and signed by
individual Senate members
condemning in much stronger

language the U.S. position in
Cambodia.
One of these, signed by 52
members of the Senate including
Pitzer and Lyman, condemned
Nixon's action in Cambodia as
"an unwise gamble, a needless
extension of human suffering and
loss of life, and destructive of our
social fabric as an open society."
It urged the "prompt withdrawal
of all American combat and
non-combat military personnel
from Southeast Asia."
The attitude of many
supporting the proposal to make
ROTC a voluntary student
organization appeared to be that
no special arrangements should be
made for ROTC.
However, Arthur E. Bryson,
Jr., professor of applied
mechanics, said: "I think it is
worthwhile to make unusual
arrangements in defense of the
country." And History Professor
David M. Potter said, "I think the
ROTC has served a very useful
function ... It has had the
misfortune of being the whipping
boy of the Vietnam War."
The faculty Senate voted
yesterday 36 to 8 with 4
abstentions to terminate credit for
ROTC courses effective August
31, 1970, while referring the issue
of retention or termination of the
ROTC program at Stanford to the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC.
