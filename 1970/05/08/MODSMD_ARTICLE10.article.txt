# ROTC And Cambodia
## Political Stands Inappropriate 
### Raymond White 
In the past week we have seen
an alarming transformation of
opinion within the Stanford
Community. There have been
meetings held by virtually all of
the departments, with the
presupposition that it is
appropriate for each of these
departments to take a stand on
and lobby for certain political
issues. In almost every case the
departmental votes have
supported a strike of some sort
aimed at two objectives: getting
ROTC off campus and objecting
to Nixon's invasion of Cambodia.
The first of these has been
settled by student and faculty
vote often enough. It is my
opinion that as long as the draft is
in force ROTC must be available
to students as an alternative. Be
that as it may, the faculty vote
should have settled the question.
The second objective I also
disagree with, but by this time I
am quite used to the fact that
most people in the academic
community abhor the war. What
bothers me far more at this point
is the way in which departmental
policy was made, and the fact that
such policy was quite clearly
political in nature.
A mass meeting is not the best
tool of democracy. Inevitably
there are those who do not

become informed of rapidly
scheduled meetings. These people
are totally disenfranchised. Then
there are those who have things
that must be done during the
hours of the meeting. They have
no opportunity to vote. Beyond
this, it is always true that those
interested in change will be more
likely to attend than those who
accept the status quo, or who
believe that the policy in question
should be determined in another
body.
Participatory Democracy Stacked
Thus the mass meeting
("participatory democracy") form
of decision making is always
somewhat stacked. My political
sense tells me that any form of
balloting procedure here at
Stanford would have given similar,
if less lopsided, results.
Nonetheless, I still feel that mass
meetings are too prejudicial of the
democratic processes which they
are supposed to facilitate.
The fact here at Stanford is
now that we are ALL about to be
represented in Washington by a
number of lobbyists who have
bren selected in some non elective
manner. None of them was
elected to represent any of us on
foreign policy matters. Supposing
that they had been (just for a

moment, mind you), who among
them can accurately represent the
thousand students who voted for
Harvey Hukari?
More important than the
selection of the lobbying body is
the fact that Stanford University
is sending such a body to
Washington. It has never been the
place of universities to act as
political units. I find it both sad
and alarming that people are now
starting to use them as such. It is
sad because it is the beginning of
the end of political freedom
within the universities.
Minority Overrides Majority
Regardless of the issue there
will be a minority which the
majority must override in order to
lobby effectively. Only the
majority view will be presented in
Washington. My tuition is
supporting professors who will
misrepresent me in whatever way
they "represent" the university
politically. This is a violation of
my political rights. I have no
choice in my association with the
university: it is my livelihood and
my career. If this organization is
not free of political efforts of its
own, then I am its political
prisoner.
•Just as a labor union is not
supposed to engage in political

activities of a general sort, the
university should not. Often a
man must belong to a particular
union in order to be able to work
(therefore to live). The same is
true of professional association
with a university. The political
minorities within unions and
within universities must be
protected, no matter how large or
how convinced the majorities
within these units may be.
The only appropriate bodies for
political lobbying remain free
associations formed for the
purpose of promoting certain
political views or policies.
Since it is apparent that
Stanford (and perhaps many other
universities) have taken the first
step into the political arena and
since it is obvious that it will be
under more pressure in the future
to lobby on other political issues,
I have to ask myself a very serious
question: Knowing that my
political rights will be increasingly
subverted and repressed, how
much longer can I remain a
member of an institution which
once boasted that its members
were politically more free than
the members of all other
institutions of society? Where am
I to go if I am to be free?

ROTC off campus and objecting
to Nixon's invasion of Cambodia.
The first of these has been
settled by student and faculty
vote often enough. It is my
opinion that as long as the draft is
in force ROTC must be available
to students as an alternative. Be
that as it may, the faculty vote
should have settled the question.
The second objective I also
disagree with, but by this time I
am quite used to the fact that
most people in the academic
community abhor the war. What
bothers me far more at this point
is the way in which departmental
policy was made, and the fact that
such policy was quite clearly
political in nature.
A mass meeting is not the best
tool of democracy. Inevitably
there are those who do not

become informed of rapidly
scheduled meetings. These people
are totally disenfranchised. Then
there are those who have things
that must be done during the
hours of the meeting. They have
no opportunity to vote. Beyond
this, it is always true that those
interested in change will be more
likely to attend than those who
accept the status quo, or who
believe that the policy in question
should be determined in another
body.
Participatory Democracy Stacked
Thus the mass meeting
("participatory democracy") form
of decision making is always
somewhat stacked. My political
sense tells me that any form of
balloting procedure here at
Stanford would have given similar,
if less lopsided, results.
Nonetheless, I still feel that mass
meetings are too prejudicial of the
democratic processes which they
are supposed to facilitate.
The fact here at Stanford is
now that we are ALL about to be
represented in Washington by a
number of lobbyists who have
bren selected in some non elective
manner. None of them was
elected to represent any of us on
foreign policy matters. Supposing
that they had been (just for a

moment, mind you), who among
them can accurately represent the
thousand students who voted for
Harvey Hukari?
More important than the
selection of the lobbying body is
the fact that Stanford University
is sending such a body to
Washington. It has never been the
place of universities to act as
political units. I find it both sad
and alarming that people are now
starting to use them as such. It is
sad because it is the beginning of
the end of political freedom
within the universities.
Minority Overrides Majority
Regardless of the issue there
will be a minority which the
majority must override in order to
lobby effectively. Only the
majority view will be presented in
Washington. My tuition is
supporting professors who will
misrepresent me in whatever way
they "represent" the university
politically. This is a violation of
my political rights. I have no
choice in my association with the
university: it is my livelihood and
my career. If this organization is
not free of political efforts of its
own, then I am its political
prisoner.
•Just as a labor union is not
supposed to engage in political

activities of a general sort, the
university should not. Often a
man must belong to a particular
union in order to be able to work
(therefore to live). The same is
true of professional association
with a university. The political
minorities within unions and
within universities must be
protected, no matter how large or
how convinced the majorities
within these units may be.
The only appropriate bodies for
political lobbying remain free
associations formed for the
purpose of promoting certain
political views or policies.
Since it is apparent that
Stanford (and perhaps many other
universities) have taken the first
step into the political arena and
since it is obvious that it will be
under more pressure in the future
to lobby on other political issues,
I have to ask myself a very serious
question: Knowing that my
political rights will be increasingly
subverted and repressed, how
much longer can I remain a
member of an institution which
once boasted that its members
were politically more free than
the members of all other
institutions of society? Where am
I to go if I am to be free?

In the past week we have seen
an alarming transformation of
opinion within the Stanford
Community. There have been
meetings held by virtually all of
the departments, with the
presupposition that it is
appropriate for each of these
departments to take a stand on
and lobby for certain political
issues. In almost every case the
departmental votes have
supported a strike of some sort
aimed at two objectives: getting
ROTC off campus and objecting
to Nixon's invasion of Cambodia.
