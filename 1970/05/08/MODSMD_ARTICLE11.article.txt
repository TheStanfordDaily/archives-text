# US Foreign Policy
## Vietnam War â€˜Quite Defensible' 
### Dwight Kelsey 
Recent discussion and action pertaining to SE Asia has produced a
paucity of support for the US involvement there. I think our foreign
policy is quite defensible and that defense desperately needs to be
heard.
First, we have taken it upon ourselves to defend the sovereignty of
South Vietnam overtly, and that of Laos and Cambodia covertly.
These states were created in 1954 with the unfortunate inability to
assert themselves from the threats that faced them. The Pathet Lao in
Laos, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and the Viet Cong in South
Vietnam are remains of the Viet Minh of the French-Indochina War and
still represent a very real extension of a totalitarian communist
offensive. It is of utmost importance that their totalitarian objectives
be realized.
It may have been tempered in recent years so as not to include the
United States as a short term objective; but the ethnic background,
socio-economic level, political naivety, and the physical proximity of
Southeast Asian countries when assessed in toto represent too ripe a
plum for Communist forces to resist. It is so natural an extension that
it seems totally incongrous that the United States located halfway
around the world with such a totally different cultural and ethnic
makeup, should be remotely involved.
Well, it is not incongenous. The real fact is that it is only the United
States that has the the resources to mount enough force to ensure
Cambodia, Laos, and S. Vietnam the ability to assert their
sovereignty. >
The Strategic Question
For the second aspect I want to consider the strategic question. The
effect of a total withdrawal of the United States would produce a
Communist takeover of Laos and Cambodia initially. Government
military forces are relatively weak in these two countries and the
political machinery is so unstable as not to have strong popular
popular support.
South Vietnam would then become totally outflanked and would
face a bitter, bloody military struggle which would inevitably prove
futile in the face of overwhelming odds. Next comes Thailand and
Burma. Thailand is relatively strong. Given the strategic advantage of
flanking Thailand to the east and north, The Communists would push
in and gain strongholds because Thailand does not have the military
force to adequately protect itself against Communist tactics. Likewise
with Burma.
Having conceded Southeast Asia what happens next? Where do
we draw the line? Taiwan, Japan, Korea, India, Australia? I am saying
that the more we drop back the stronger and more motivated we are
allowing the Communists to become, and the weaker and more
procrastinating be become. Commitment to Southeast Asia is a moral
cause. It is defending the right of sovereign states to determine their
own destiny. It is protecting the free world from the very real danger
of a much wider war in the not too distant years ahead.
The People's Welfare
The third aspect I wish to address myself to is the welfare of the
people of Southeast Asia. To give up our fight now would still mean
massive bloodshed as the Communists begin to assert themselves
against a large amoung of resistance that still must be overcome even
without any American support. In addition, we must also consider
what after effects a Communist government would have on the people
versus what a non-Communist government would have.
The non-Communist government would in all likelihood allow the
people to return to their farms and villages to take up their lives in the
same way that they had lived before the war; but the Communist
government would not allow the people to own their own land and
probably more important would not allow them to practice their
religious beliefs.
A fourth issue is the effects of Southeast Asia on American foreign
policy. One might say that our policy in SEA has produced nothing
but antipathy toward the US from countries abroad. There is a large
element of truth in this statement. However, if we withdrew from
SEA we would be creating an earth-shaking change in the balance of
world power. First of all, we would be creating a power void in
Southeast Asia that would create that kind of dynamics which I have
outlined earlier under strategic aspects. Secondly, it tells the World

that we are beginning to disengage ourselves at least at a certain level
in foreign affairs.
It also says that the United States cannot be trusted in its
committments to other countries. Japan, Europe, Israel, and other
countries that have so inextricably depended on U.S. support now
would find themselves jeopardized in several respects. World economy
and world security would suffer drastically because such a withdrawal
action is really that severe.
Finally, at home I forsee a parallel situation to that abroad. We face
a troubled and badly polarized country today, and Southeast ASia is
undoubtedly a strong contributor to the strife in our country.
However. I contend that we wou'd still have the same king of
conflicts even without the war. To withdraw from Southeast Asia, to
sell that whole area of the world down the drain would seem like a
giant albatross to us in ten years because then we would be able to see
that we could have saved many people's lives and several countries
lives. We would have to live with that guilt, and there is a distinct
possibility we would be faced with a much wider war in Indian or
Australia or Japan. Otherwise, we would remain in our snug North
American cocoon and think of when we were alive.
In closing, I want to make abundantly clear that I do not
unequivocally support the United States conduct of itself in SEA. I
believe there is a philosophical and applied political difference
between the kind of moral action I have espoused and the oft
imperialistic actions taken by our government and its forces. We have
too often showed a blatant disregard for the sovereignty of these
countries and for the welfare of the populace.
Pacification was a concept that became popular under former
Ambassador Lodge. It is one that needs to be revived and on a much
greater scale if we are to truly establish our presence as a moral one as
I strongly believe we must take the responsibility to do.

Australia or Japan. Otherwise, we would remain in our snug North
American cocoon and think of when we were alive.
In closing, I want to make abundantly clear that I do not
unequivocally support the United States conduct of itself in SEA. I
believe there is a philosophical and applied political difference
between the kind of moral action I have espoused and the oft
imperialistic actions taken by our government and its forces. We have
too often showed a blatant disregard for the sovereignty of these
countries and for the welfare of the populace.
Pacification was a concept that became popular under former
Ambassador Lodge. It is one that needs to be revived and on a much
greater scale if we are to truly establish our presence as a moral one as
I strongly believe we must take the responsibility to do.
fDwight Kelsey is a grad student in physical therapy.)
Recent discussion and action pertaining to SE Asia has produced a
paucity of support for the US involvement there. I think our foreign
policy is quite defensible and that defense desperately needs to be
heard.
First, we have taken it upon ourselves to defend the sovereignty of
South Vietnam overtly, and that of Laos and Cambodia covertly.
These states were created in 1954 with the unfortunate inability to
assert themselves from the threats that faced them. The Pathet Lao in
Laos, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and the Viet Cong in South
Vietnam are remains of the Viet Minh of the French-Indochina War and
still represent a very real extension of a totalitarian communist
offensive. It is of utmost importance that their totalitarian objectives
be realized.
It may have been tempered in recent years so as not to include the
United States as a short term objective; but the ethnic background,
socio-economic level, political naivety, and the physical proximity of
Southeast Asian countries when assessed in toto represent too ripe a
plum for Communist forces to resist. It is so natural an extension that
it seems totally incongrous that the United States located halfway
around the world with such a totally different cultural and ethnic
makeup, should be remotely involved.
Well, it is not incongenous. The real fact is that it is only the United
States that has the the resources to mount enough force to ensure
Cambodia, Laos, and S. Vietnam the ability to assert their
sovereignty. >
The Strategic Question
For the second aspect I want to consider the strategic question. The
effect of a total withdrawal of the United States would produce a
Communist takeover of Laos and Cambodia initially. Government
military forces are relatively weak in these two countries and the
political machinery is so unstable as not to have strong popular
popular support.
South Vietnam would then become totally outflanked and would
face a bitter, bloody military struggle which would inevitably prove
futile in the face of overwhelming odds. Next comes Thailand and
Burma. Thailand is relatively strong. Given the strategic advantage of
flanking Thailand to the east and north, The Communists would push
in and gain strongholds because Thailand does not have the military
force to adequately protect itself against Communist tactics. Likewise
with Burma.
Having conceded Southeast Asia what happens next? Where do
we draw the line? Taiwan, Japan, Korea, India, Australia? I am saying
that the more we drop back the stronger and more motivated we are
allowing the Communists to become, and the weaker and more
procrastinating be become. Commitment to Southeast Asia is a moral
cause. It is defending the right of sovereign states to determine their
own destiny. It is protecting the free world from the very real danger
of a much wider war in the not too distant years ahead.
The People's Welfare
The third aspect I wish to address myself to is the welfare of the
people of Southeast Asia. To give up our fight now would still mean
massive bloodshed as the Communists begin to assert themselves
against a large amoung of resistance that still must be overcome even
without any American support. In addition, we must also consider
what after effects a Communist government would have on the people
versus what a non-Communist government would have.
The non-Communist government would in all likelihood allow the
people to return to their farms and villages to take up their lives in the
same way that they had lived before the war; but the Communist
government would not allow the people to own their own land and
probably more important would not allow them to practice their
religious beliefs.
A fourth issue is the effects of Southeast Asia on American foreign
policy. One might say that our policy in SEA has produced nothing
but antipathy toward the US from countries abroad. There is a large
element of truth in this statement. However, if we withdrew from
SEA we would be creating an earth-shaking change in the balance of
world power. First of all, we would be creating a power void in
Southeast Asia that would create that kind of dynamics which I have
outlined earlier under strategic aspects. Secondly, it tells the World

that we are beginning to disengage ourselves at least at a certain level
in foreign affairs.
It also says that the United States cannot be trusted in its
committments to other countries. Japan, Europe, Israel, and other
countries that have so inextricably depended on U.S. support now
would find themselves jeopardized in several respects. World economy
and world security would suffer drastically because such a withdrawal
action is really that severe.
Finally, at home I forsee a parallel situation to that abroad. We face
a troubled and badly polarized country today, and Southeast ASia is
undoubtedly a strong contributor to the strife in our country.
However. I contend that we wou'd still have the same king of
conflicts even without the war. To withdraw from Southeast Asia, to
sell that whole area of the world down the drain would seem like a
giant albatross to us in ten years because then we would be able to see
that we could have saved many people's lives and several countries
lives. We would have to live with that guilt, and there is a distinct
possibility we would be faced with a much wider war in Indian or
Australia or Japan. Otherwise, we would remain in our snug North
American cocoon and think of when we were alive.

countries that have so inextricably depended on U.S. support now
would find themselves jeopardized in several respects. World economy
and world security would suffer drastically because such a withdrawal
action is really that severe.
Finally, at home I forsee a parallel situation to that abroad. We face
a troubled and badly polarized country today, and Southeast ASia is
undoubtedly a strong contributor to the strife in our country.
However. I contend that we wou'd still have the same king of
conflicts even without the war. To withdraw from Southeast Asia, to
sell that whole area of the world down the drain would seem like a
giant albatross to us in ten years because then we would be able to see
that we could have saved many people's lives and several countries
lives. We would have to live with that guilt, and there is a distinct
possibility we would be faced with a much wider war in Indian or
Australia or Japan. Otherwise, we would remain in our snug North
American cocoon and think of when we were alive.
In closing, I want to make abundantly clear that I do not
unequivocally support the United States conduct of itself in SEA. I
believe there is a philosophical and applied political difference
between the kind of moral action I have espoused and the oft
imperialistic actions taken by our government and its forces. We have
too often showed a blatant disregard for the sovereignty of these
countries and for the welfare of the populace.
Pacification was a concept that became popular under former
Ambassador Lodge. It is one that needs to be revived and on a much
greater scale if we are to truly establish our presence as a moral one as
I strongly believe we must take the responsibility to do.

Recent discussion and action pertaining to SE Asia has produced a
paucity of support for the US involvement there. I think our foreign
policy is quite defensible and that defense desperately needs to be
heard.
First, we have taken it upon ourselves to defend the sovereignty of
South Vietnam overtly, and that of Laos and Cambodia covertly.
These states were created in 1954 with the unfortunate inability to
assert themselves from the threats that faced them. The Pathet Lao in
Laos, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and the Viet Cong in South
Vietnam are remains of the Viet Minh of the French-Indochina War and
still represent a very real extension of a totalitarian communist
offensive. It is of utmost importance that their totalitarian objectives
be realized.
It may have been tempered in recent years so as not to include the
United States as a short term objective; but the ethnic background,
socio-economic level, political naivety, and the physical proximity of
Southeast Asian countries when assessed in toto represent too ripe a
plum for Communist forces to resist. It is so natural an extension that
it seems totally incongrous that the United States located halfway
around the world with such a totally different cultural and ethnic
makeup, should be remotely involved.
Well, it is not incongenous. The real fact is that it is only the United
States that has the the resources to mount enough force to ensure
Cambodia, Laos, and S. Vietnam the ability to assert their
sovereignty. >
The Strategic Question
For the second aspect I want to consider the strategic question. The
effect of a total withdrawal of the United States would produce a
Communist takeover of Laos and Cambodia initially. Government
military forces are relatively weak in these two countries and the
political machinery is so unstable as not to have strong popular
popular support.
South Vietnam would then become totally outflanked and would
face a bitter, bloody military struggle which would inevitably prove
futile in the face of overwhelming odds. Next comes Thailand and
Burma. Thailand is relatively strong. Given the strategic advantage of
flanking Thailand to the east and north, The Communists would push
in and gain strongholds because Thailand does not have the military
force to adequately protect itself against Communist tactics. Likewise
with Burma.
Having conceded Southeast Asia what happens next? Where do
we draw the line? Taiwan, Japan, Korea, India, Australia? I am saying
that the more we drop back the stronger and more motivated we are
allowing the Communists to become, and the weaker and more
procrastinating be become. Commitment to Southeast Asia is a moral
cause. It is defending the right of sovereign states to determine their
own destiny. It is protecting the free world from the very real danger
of a much wider war in the not too distant years ahead.
The People's Welfare
The third aspect I wish to address myself to is the welfare of the
people of Southeast Asia. To give up our fight now would still mean
massive bloodshed as the Communists begin to assert themselves
against a large amoung of resistance that still must be overcome even
without any American support. In addition, we must also consider
what after effects a Communist government would have on the people
versus what a non-Communist government would have.
The non-Communist government would in all likelihood allow the
people to return to their farms and villages to take up their lives in the
same way that they had lived before the war; but the Communist
government would not allow the people to own their own land and
probably more important would not allow them to practice their
religious beliefs.
A fourth issue is the effects of Southeast Asia on American foreign
policy. One might say that our policy in SEA has produced nothing
but antipathy toward the US from countries abroad. There is a large
element of truth in this statement. However, if we withdrew from
SEA we would be creating an earth-shaking change in the balance of
world power. First of all, we would be creating a power void in
Southeast Asia that would create that kind of dynamics which I have
outlined earlier under strategic aspects. Secondly, it tells the World

that we are beginning to disengage ourselves at least at a certain level
in foreign affairs.
It also says that the United States cannot be trusted in its
committments to other countries. Japan, Europe, Israel, and other
countries that have so inextricably depended on U.S. support now
would find themselves jeopardized in several respects. World economy
and world security would suffer drastically because such a withdrawal
action is really that severe.
Finally, at home I forsee a parallel situation to that abroad. We face
a troubled and badly polarized country today, and Southeast ASia is
undoubtedly a strong contributor to the strife in our country.
