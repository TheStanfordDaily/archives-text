# Tut-tut
## Behind Non-Violent Talk 
### George Cuttermole 
Last week we saw again the
faculty and good students of
Stanford agreeing gravel that
"Campus Violence" is to be
condemned. I sympathize
whole-mindedly but I wonder
why it is that those who are either
silent or academically tut-tut and
"bad-show" about daily murder
and rape in Southeast Asia are
now — and only now raging
Reagan-like about Violence to
Property amd Community.
Why is it that consciences
suddenly begin accumulating
callouses when a small piece of
the war comes home? (Why are
we so provincial about property
and so fucking cosmopolitan
about killing?)
The only half reasonable
answer I've found to questions
along these lines is that the
University needs to be preserved
as a sanctuary (traditionally a safe
and/or scared place) from which
we can criticize the wicked ways
of government and society.

Student strikes are likened to
self-immolation; Nixon and
Agnew would like nothing better
than to see the Universities shut
down.
But hopefully it is clear now
that Universities are safe only if
they are silent and cooperative.
They have largely gone on with
businesses as usual since Vietnam
began and by so doing have done
just as much to keep the war
going as to stop it. And we must
see that they have done this not
only by housing ROTC and war
research but also by becoming a
source of those maxims of
moderation and head-in-the-sand
sayings which have made
education in the midst of war a
brilliantly effective novocaine job.
Hopefully we can also see that
the strike is a first step from
self-conscious apologetics to
action. People are already ceasing
to talk of roles and function and
beginning to do things. And yet it
is said that we are carried away
with the moment - that the
University have not struck like
this before against war and racism
and facism and that it is on pain
of moral inconsistency that they
strike now - for by doing so they
are saying that the schools should
stay shut "until all the worlds
problems are solved."
In other words, Nixon and
Cambodia are no different, they
should be incorporated into the
status quo - the unfortunate but
acceptable reality called "the real
world." But many feel there is
something special about the
present crisis - perhaps because of
the sheer intensity of its
perverseness, perhaps because it is
more of the same after many
years and lives spent learning how
wrong we've been. Further, if the
strike should prove at all
successful in stopping the killing
then it should certainly be
considered as a tactic to take
against "other social ills" such as
racism and political repression.
And above all this we are again
hearing the age-old saw about
means and ends. We are told that
those who are committing the
cardinal sin of campus violence
are alienating with their means
people who would, could, or
might otherwise sympathize with
their ends. There are still people
to be taught and won we are told,
"behave yourself and end the
war."
But if suspected moral
inconsistency and the destruction
of property are enough to turn-off
those who are still deliberating
about whether or not the
destruction of peoples lives (they
own them if you must) is A)
NECESSARY, B) JUST, C) EVIL,
D) UNAVOIDABLE, E)
UNFORTUNATE, F) NONE OF
THESE, then such people are not
wooable to the cause of peace.
The time has come for the end
of dialogue about the need for
dialogue. The time has come to
stop killing. There is left only one
reasonable and effective way to
do this: If the government and the
money people see that ROTC and
Vietnam and war related research
etc. etc. are not only "somewhat
uppopular" but also very
expensive to maintain, then they
might, albeit for the wrong
reasons, stop killing people.
If killing can be made to cost
property and education and
business as usual at home then
maybe the price can be made
prohibitive. It is the only way left
for those who feel that lives are
more sacred than property and
institutions.

people who would, could, or
might otherwise sympathize with
their ends. There are still people
to be taught and won we are told,
"behave yourself and end the
war."
But if suspected moral
inconsistency and the destruction
of property are enough to turn-off
those who are still deliberating
about whether or not the
destruction of peoples lives (they
own them if you must) is A)
NECESSARY, B) JUST, C) EVIL,
D) UNAVOIDABLE, E)
UNFORTUNATE, F) NONE OF
THESE, then such people are not
wooable to the cause of peace.
The time has come for the end
of dialogue about the need for
dialogue. The time has come to
stop killing. There is left only one
reasonable and effective way to
do this: If the government and the
money people see that ROTC and
Vietnam and war related research
etc. etc. are not only "somewhat
uppopular" but also very
expensive to maintain, then they
might, albeit for the wrong
reasons, stop killing people.
If killing can be made to cost
property and education and
business as usual at home then
maybe the price can be made
prohibitive. It is the only way left
for those who feel that lives are
more sacred than property and
institutions.
Last week we saw again the
faculty and good students of
Stanford agreeing gravel that
"Campus Violence" is to be
condemned. I sympathize
whole-mindedly but I wonder
why it is that those who are either
silent or academically tut-tut and
"bad-show" about daily murder
and rape in Southeast Asia are
now — and only now raging
Reagan-like about Violence to
Property amd Community.
Why is it that consciences
suddenly begin accumulating
callouses when a small piece of
the war comes home? (Why are
we so provincial about property
and so fucking cosmopolitan
about killing?)
The only half reasonable
answer I've found to questions
along these lines is that the
University needs to be preserved
as a sanctuary (traditionally a safe
and/or scared place) from which
we can criticize the wicked ways
of government and society.

Student strikes are likened to
self-immolation; Nixon and
Agnew would like nothing better
than to see the Universities shut
down.
But hopefully it is clear now
that Universities are safe only if
they are silent and cooperative.
They have largely gone on with
businesses as usual since Vietnam
began and by so doing have done
just as much to keep the war
going as to stop it. And we must
see that they have done this not
only by housing ROTC and war
research but also by becoming a
source of those maxims of
moderation and head-in-the-sand
sayings which have made
education in the midst of war a
brilliantly effective novocaine job.
Hopefully we can also see that
the strike is a first step from
self-conscious apologetics to
action. People are already ceasing
to talk of roles and function and
beginning to do things. And yet it
is said that we are carried away
with the moment - that the
University have not struck like
this before against war and racism
and facism and that it is on pain
of moral inconsistency that they
strike now - for by doing so they
are saying that the schools should
stay shut "until all the worlds
problems are solved."
In other words, Nixon and
Cambodia are no different, they
should be incorporated into the
status quo - the unfortunate but
acceptable reality called "the real
world." But many feel there is
something special about the
present crisis - perhaps because of
the sheer intensity of its
perverseness, perhaps because it is
more of the same after many
years and lives spent learning how
wrong we've been. Further, if the
strike should prove at all
successful in stopping the killing
then it should certainly be
considered as a tactic to take
against "other social ills" such as
racism and political repression.
And above all this we are again
hearing the age-old saw about
means and ends. We are told that
those who are committing the
cardinal sin of campus violence
are alienating with their means
people who would, could, or
might otherwise sympathize with
their ends. There are still people
to be taught and won we are told,
"behave yourself and end the
war."
