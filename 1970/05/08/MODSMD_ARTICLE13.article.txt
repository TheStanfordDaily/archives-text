# The 						Movement's Future
## A 						Course For Action 
### Marc Weiss 
The anti-war movement is now
at a crucial stage in its history.
President Nixon has just
undertaken the most serious
escalation of the war since 1965.
The domino theory has been
realized —the American
establishment now finds itself
arrayed against all the people of
Southeast Asia. The Pathet Lao,
Khmer Rouge, and Viet Cong are
now the only legitimate and
popular political forces in their
respective countries.
We must work to win support
from the American people for
these Communist liberation
forces, because our troop
withdrawals will inevitably be
coupled by their hard-earned

victory. The only alternative is to
maintain that we will not give
Indochina to its own people, even
if that means the total destruction
through saturation bombing of
the entire region (including the
cities)and possibly even the use of
nuclear weapons on China. This is
the Nixon strategy. Our task is to
create a powerful opposition to it.
What To Do?
The one thing that we should
be clear about is that putting our
energy into electoral politics is a
complete waste of time. First of
all, the Congress has absolutely no
power over the determination of
foreign policy. Recent statements
by Senator Fulbright confirm this
fact. And secondly, as long as
politicians accept the basic
assumptions, goals, and operating
procedures of the American
corporate political economy then
they must work to continue the
current policies. Congressmen
may lament the Kennedy-John
son-Nixon war escalations as being
mishandled and divisive, but they
offer absolutely no concrete
alternatives to these escalations
because they support the basic
military objectives.
"Anti-war" businessmen and
politicians are absolutely abhorred
at the thought that to end the war
they must recognize the
indigerous Communist
governments in Southeast Asia,
because that is an "irresponsible"
revolutionary position. Thus the
only real substantive challenge to
the status quo is not "liberal" but
radical. Our political opposition
must be extra-parliamentary to be
truly effective.
Shut It Down
Our first action must be a
decisive and immediate attempt to
withdraw basic social resources
from the military-economic
machine and disrupt business as
usual. This university serves as a
center for the planning of future
American Imperial expansion and
as a training ground for its
leadership, from ROTC officers to
corporate executives to atomic
scientists. Stanford's long-run
health is vital to the capitalist
teehnostructure, and our current
system is an extremely radical
step. The first demands to be
made are the immediate offing of
ROTC and of all Defense research.
An equally important step
toward both changing the
university and stopping the war is
the demand that the university's
resources (students, buildings)

between now and September be
devoted exclusively to the task of
organizing the West Coast actions
against the war. The precedent is
now set as the University of
Pennsylvania has established itself
as the East Coast Anti-War Center.
We must be prepared to fight
for the right to stay in the dorms
(illegally if necessary) after school
closes and devote our energies to
community organizing around
mass actions in the Bay Area in
the months ahead. I think an
excellent beginning would be for
us to shut down part of the San
Francisco financial district next
Monday and Tuesday when the
Stanford Trustees meet in their
California St. office building.
After that we could attempt to
shut down the Industrial Park, or
at least Hewlett-Packard. Regional
Actions should follow, like
shutting down Lockheed in
Sunnyvale or the Oakland Army
and Navy Bases.
Off ROTC
With regard to ROTC, the
decision of the faculty to end
credit is complete bullshit. The
recent Cambodian escalation
combined with the abolition of
new student deferments means
that freshmen are going to be
fighting to get into ROTC next
year as the only way to stay in
school and avoid the draft.
Already 34 freshmen are enrolled
in next year's ROTC as opposed
to only 6 this year. Besides, the
experience of MIT shows that
where the students have
well-disciplined technical minds
and upper-class leanings the
Pentagon wants them so badly
that it will accept a no-credit
on-campus ROTC program. This is
true at Stanford as well.
When ROTC is OFF this
campus we can celebrate a great
victory. But no-credit is nothing
to cheer about. Even if the
sympathies of the faculty are with
us on ROTC, the pressures on
them from the Trustees and the
Pentagon overpower their moral
concern. By disrupting the
university and radicalizing the
students we have the power to
counter these pressures. Only
when the faculty is certain that
they CANNOT restore order on
the campus without meeting the
demands will they meet the
demands. Until they do, it is the
student body's responsibility to
maintain disorder.

from the military-economic
machine and disrupt business as
usual. This university serves as a
center for the planning of future
American Imperial expansion and
as a training ground for its
leadership, from ROTC officers to
corporate executives to atomic
scientists. Stanford's long-run
health is vital to the capitalist
teehnostructure, and our current
system is an extremely radical
step. The first demands to be
made are the immediate offing of
ROTC and of all Defense research.
An equally important step
toward both changing the
university and stopping the war is
the demand that the university's
resources (students, buildings)

between now and September be
devoted exclusively to the task of
organizing the West Coast actions
against the war. The precedent is
now set as the University of
Pennsylvania has established itself
as the East Coast Anti-War Center.
We must be prepared to fight
for the right to stay in the dorms
(illegally if necessary) after school
closes and devote our energies to
community organizing around
mass actions in the Bay Area in
the months ahead. I think an
excellent beginning would be for
us to shut down part of the San
Francisco financial district next
Monday and Tuesday when the
Stanford Trustees meet in their
California St. office building.
After that we could attempt to
shut down the Industrial Park, or
at least Hewlett-Packard. Regional
Actions should follow, like
shutting down Lockheed in
Sunnyvale or the Oakland Army
and Navy Bases.
Off ROTC
With regard to ROTC, the
decision of the faculty to end
credit is complete bullshit. The
recent Cambodian escalation
combined with the abolition of
new student deferments means
that freshmen are going to be
fighting to get into ROTC next
year as the only way to stay in
school and avoid the draft.
Already 34 freshmen are enrolled
in next year's ROTC as opposed
to only 6 this year. Besides, the
experience of MIT shows that
where the students have
well-disciplined technical minds
and upper-class leanings the
Pentagon wants them so badly
that it will accept a no-credit
on-campus ROTC program. This is
true at Stanford as well.
When ROTC is OFF this
campus we can celebrate a great
victory. But no-credit is nothing
to cheer about. Even if the
sympathies of the faculty are with
us on ROTC, the pressures on
them from the Trustees and the
Pentagon overpower their moral
concern. By disrupting the
university and radicalizing the
students we have the power to
counter these pressures. Only
when the faculty is certain that
they CANNOT restore order on
the campus without meeting the
demands will they meet the
demands. Until they do, it is the
student body's responsibility to
maintain disorder.

The anti-war movement is now
at a crucial stage in its history.
President Nixon has just
undertaken the most serious
escalation of the war since 1965.
The domino theory has been
realized —the American
establishment now finds itself
arrayed against all the people of
Southeast Asia. The Pathet Lao,
Khmer Rouge, and Viet Cong are
now the only legitimate and
popular political forces in their
respective countries.
We must work to win support
from the American people for
these Communist liberation
forces, because our troop
withdrawals will inevitably be
coupled by their hard-earned

victory. The only alternative is to
maintain that we will not give
Indochina to its own people, even
if that means the total destruction
through saturation bombing of
the entire region (including the
cities)and possibly even the use of
nuclear weapons on China. This is
the Nixon strategy. Our task is to
create a powerful opposition to it.
What To Do?
The one thing that we should
be clear about is that putting our
energy into electoral politics is a
complete waste of time. First of
all, the Congress has absolutely no
power over the determination of
foreign policy. Recent statements
by Senator Fulbright confirm this
fact. And secondly, as long as
politicians accept the basic
assumptions, goals, and operating
procedures of the American
corporate political economy then
they must work to continue the
current policies. Congressmen
may lament the Kennedy-John
son-Nixon war escalations as being
mishandled and divisive, but they
offer absolutely no concrete
alternatives to these escalations
because they support the basic
military objectives.
"Anti-war" businessmen and
politicians are absolutely abhorred
at the thought that to end the war
they must recognize the
indigerous Communist
governments in Southeast Asia,
because that is an "irresponsible"
revolutionary position. Thus the
only real substantive challenge to
the status quo is not "liberal" but
radical. Our political opposition
must be extra-parliamentary to be
truly effective.
Shut It Down
Our first action must be a

When ROTC is OFF this
campus we can celebrate a great
victory. But no-credit is nothing
to cheer about. Even if the
sympathies of the faculty are with
us on ROTC, the pressures on
them from the Trustees and the
Pentagon overpower their moral
concern. By disrupting the
university and radicalizing the
students we have the power to
counter these pressures. Only
when the faculty is certain that
they CANNOT restore order on
the campus without meeting the
demands will they meet the
demands. Until they do, it is the
student body's responsibility to
maintain disorder.
