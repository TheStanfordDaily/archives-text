## The

Monday morning Provost
Richard Lyman approached a
student-filled doorway at History
Corner and offered both support
for our concern and criticism of
our tactics. The litany of
criticisms was familiar-mse proper
channels, don't provoke
right-wing backlash, offer
constructive alternatives, avoid
violence. I'm really scared, he
said. Lethal objects, large rocks,
have been thrown through the
windows of my home and I have a
wife and kids to worry about.
I, too, have a wife and two
small children. I, too, am afraid
that they may be injured by the
violence on our campus, in our
society. Recently some students
have considered "giving the
radicals a dose of their own
medicine," by throwing rocks
through their windows and seeing
how they like it.
But do these attitudes really
comprehend the roots of violence
in our society? I think not. There
is violence against men and their
families throughout Indochina,
there is violence striking children
in our urban ghettos, there is
subtle violence in the oppression
of our children by
conforming-demanding suburban
white schools and other social
institutions. Can it be that we are
only against violence when it
strikes us? Is war at home the
only form of war we are against?
The ruling class is always
opposed to violence when it is
directed at its institutions and
prerogatives. But violence and the
threat of violence are the principal
means by which the ruling class
maintains itself in power.
The Credible Threat
of Violence
It is through violence and the
credible threat of violence that
the U.S. ruling class maintains its
enterprises and troops around the
world. We all profit from this

violence against man and nature,
for our tiny fraction of the
world's population consumes
nearly half of the resources which
are extracted from this planet
every year.
This is why Nixon knows he
must win in Indochina. If we are
defeated there, we will be refused
of forced to pay a fair price for oil
in the Middle East, copper in
Chile, uranium in Canada, coffee
and rubber in Brazil and on down
the line.
The imperialist-capitalist
machine which supports the
world's highest standard of living
for the white American middle
class, which keeps the Third
World in peonage, is maintained
through violence and the threat of
violence.
Violence And Crazier
How does violence at Stanford
figure in this world-wide scheme?
There are, of course, those few
anarchists and enragees who
throw rocks and set fires for
personal gratification.
Self-maddened and isolated, they
lash out indiscriminately and,
ultimately, ineffectually.
There is other violence,
however, which centers around
ROTC and DOD research, those
things which signify the
complicity of Stanford in the
imperialist exploitation of the
Third World. This violence is a
result of the alliance of
petit bourgeois intellectuals with
the exploited elements at home
and abroad in confronting the
ruling class in this country.
Theoretically, there is no
absolute necessity for the use of
physical violence in the
expropriation of the ruling class.
History shows, however, that
those who hold power only rarely
give up that power without a
struggle.

In the present conditions of
sharpening class conflict
throughout the world, those of us
who adhere to the principles of
non-violence must recognize these
forces which are at work if we are
to deal with them. It is not
enough to stand between the
police and demonstrating
students, although that may have
some symbolic value. That type of
action merely puts off the
inevitable confrontation, for the
issue is not one of violence but of
state power.
We who believe in non-violence
must exert every effort, must
struggle constantly, to educate
our associates, to expose
anti-working class bias and racism
in our institutions and leadership.
We must work to build political
consciousness and
internationalism among our fellow
intellectuals on campus and must
share and discuss our positions
with all militant forces
throughout our larger community.
State power is passing on a
world-wide scale from the hands
of a few to the hands of millions.
The reactionary unwillingness of
the capitalists to yield state
power, to cease exploiting the
peoples and resources of this
planet is the source of violence in
our society.
If all non-violence means is stay
calm, don't act, it is not only
ineffectual as the class conflict
grows ever sharper, but is also
morally corrupt, for its premise
then is that it is worse to throw
rocks than to allow the
imperialist-capitalists to continue
wielding state power. True
non-violence directs itself at the
source of violence in this world,
the exploitation of one man by
another.
