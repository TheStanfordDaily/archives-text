# One Man's Fantasy
## To Be Or Not To Be 
### Nick Selby 
Will someone tell me what in hell going on here?
Rational dialoggers beware: I about to lay another
"zany" on you.
It about 2:12 yesterday afternoon, and I sitting
in the Daily office thinking that although the sun
shining, absolutely nothing clear in my mind. The
bubbles of Bireley's orange drink gurgling through
my esophagus with ease of stars arranging
themselves in constellations cons ago. My stomach
slightly nauseous.
Many folk ask me what these columns about.
The columns not so much attempt to illuminate
the world scene or even to edify the reader as
attempt to chronicle one man's ceaseless struggle
to maintain his sanity. Only a few trillion things
bothering me right now. Let me tell you them.
Lon Nol vs. Lon Nol
Not only that, but Nixon deny he making an
invasion of Cambodia. This exactly the same as
Mexico crossing 30,000 troops twenty miles into
Texas, burning houses, looting corn cribs and
cellars, capturing Americans, and Diaz not calling
it an invasion.
Or exactly the same as Canada installing hockey
player Gordy Howe as U.S. president to applaud
the presence of Canadian troops on U.S. soil. This
not make very good sense either. Why do the
nation yawn so oftenly?
O.TV. Number
Forty Three!
Next, 1 beginning to realize that not only do we
have Operation Total Victory, but Operation Total
Victories numbers forty two and forty three. This
mean we had forty one previous Operation Total
Victories.
Nixon think we won so many time before, why
not win again. Or, if forty two fail, then we got
forty th.-oe. I think this what known in military
orbits as "planning ahead." But I not too sure.
Fourth, I listening to the Governor of the proud
190 years of California history, who tell me he
closing the campuses of colleges and universities.

For last four years now, he claim that radicals
,wa/it to shut university down. Then he go and shut
university down himself.
I think that there an analogue somewhere, like
Germany, or even the day before, like some
distant loony called Thieu, who close school and
university of South Vietnam. I think Reagan also
insane, but again, I not too sure of anything by
this point.
Aha! He keeping university open by closing it
down for a few days. I bet he promise to open
universities again by, say, the end of June. "If
universities not open by July 1," Reagan say.
"then I make a hippie president of Berkeley."
Nixon say he'll make an ensign Chief of Staff. We
in for some good ones, folks.
Invitations or Not?
Wednesday night, I listening on KZSU to Bruce
Franklin. Bruce on another ego flight, that for
sure, he so insistent on being heard. Although the
meeting vote not to invite radical brothers and
sisters from other schools to Stanford, Bruce go
ahead and invite them anyway.
Only last year, I remembering, Bruce scream at
motherfucking bourgeois to abide by group
decision (to sit-in at Encina) or not to vote. By all
processes of logic, this mean one abide by decision
by not abiding by decision. Maybe my memory
weak, maybe 1 try too hard to remember. Who
know?
And at same time, same meeting, radicals vote
to allow students to go to class or to not go to
class. They also insist continuing total strike
against university. Students to go to class by not
going to class. Does you think things starting to
make sense?
Yes, finally things starting to make sense. They
makes sense by not making sense. I enjoying going
insane very much. Is you, or Isn't you?
(By all trustworthy rumor, Nich Selby was a
senior in English. His columns, when he is able to
escape from the agnew State Hospital, appear
twice each week in the DAILY.)
