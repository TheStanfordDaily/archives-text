War Outrage
Editor, The Daily:
We share the sense of outrage
which you and other Americans
feel over the war in Southeast
Asia. The recent invasion of
Cambodia and the resumption of
bombing of North Vietnam are
only the latest in a long series of
actions that mean more anguish
and destruction on all sides.
We also share your sense of
frustration in seeking to halt this
endless war and senseless policy.
We believe it is time Congress
played the role assigned it by the
Constitution in determining our
involvement in military
adventures abroad. This leadership
role is admittedly long overdue.
This absence of leadership has
had tragic results. We are shocked
and grieved by the tragedy that
occurred at Kent State on
Monday. We share a sense of guilt
because of the lack of alternatives
provided by the Congress of the

United States thus far. We hope
our present effort will provide a
meaningful alternative.
We urge you to direct your
efforts to supporting
Congressional action to cut off
further funds for Southeast Asia
except for the purpose of
withdrawing troops safely and
systematically, the exchange of
prisoners, and asylum for
Vietnamese who might feel
threatened by our withdrawal.
This will come to a vote,
probably within 30 days, when
there will be an official roll call on
this amendment requiring every
Senator to go on record for or
against continued funding of the
war. Similar efforts are underway
in the House of Representatives.
Will you do all in your power
to generate public support for a
victorious roll call to end the war?
Your letters, phone calls, petitions
and personal visits to your
senators and congressmen are
urgently needed now and during
the next three or four crucial
weeks.
Above all, please make it
known that acts of violence will
be manipulated to the detriment
of our cause, and will sabotage
this initiative for peace. (Sens.

Hatfield, Charles Guodell, Alan
Cranston, and Harold Hughes.)
Recall The Hydras
Editor, The Daily:
Several of us have given very
serious consideration to the
following proposal:
"Petition for Recall: We
petition for the recall of the
ASSU Council of Presidents
(Levin, Mickelson, Shea and
Grant) for the following reason:
failure to take any official stand
either in support of or in
opposition to the Stanford strike.

The immediate objective of this
petition is to secure student
leadership - or what is constituted
as student leadership on this
campus - which is responsive to
the people and to the issues."
There are several reasons for
such a move. The strike can well
be said to be the most critical
issue for the Stanford University
community in many months, yet
where is the ASSU leadership on
it? Secondly, how can the Council
of Presidents go trotting off to
Washington, D.C. as Stanford
representatives without letting
this community know what it
feels in some clear and definitive
way? There are real arguments
against a recall, however. It could
conceivably create dissension
among students at a time when
solidarity is necessary and is being
evidenced. A recall effort might,
in effect, be using the strike
organization in such a way as to
divert attention from central
issues. There may well exist
selective, but not total disapproval
of the ASSU Presidents, i.e.,
sentiment exists to recall most but
not all of them. In particular, Bob
Grant stands out among the ASSU
Council in the past two weeks for
his concern and efforts; a recall
might needlessly involve him.
In addition, there are
procedural problems to recall.
Fifteen percent of the student
body, according to the ASSU
Constitution, must petition for
the recall. The student Senate
must accept and certify such
petitions. If time is tight toward
the end of the quarter, the new
election may be postponed until
the beginning of the fall quarter.
Furthermore, selective recall is
not defined in the Constitution,
and therefore might not be
possible as an alternative.
A good number of people have

said, moreover, why even bother.
Student government is so inane -
this one in particular - that its
leadership is no necessary
quantity. The strike has been
organized in spite of the ASSU
Council. A recall is just wasting
good effort.
Obviously, however, we do
care. We want responsive student
government on this campus. If
Pitzer really means what he says
about his willingness to consult
student leaders before plunging
into major things like police on
campus or shutting down the
University, then the ASSU
Presidents must become a more
significant commodity - if only to
test Pitzer's veracity. This means
taking stands.
We invite the Stanford
community to express their
thoughts on the proposal of a
recall. Such expressions, we
believe, are necessary to decide
upon action steps, if any, that we
take.
Where the hell are you, Council
of Presidents?

Conditional Support
Editor, The Daily:
I intend to support the strike,
provided it remains non-violent,
and provided no demands are
made that would seriously cripple
the effectiveness of the university
in the long run.
What would seriously cripple
the university? Removal of ROTC
will not do so. Support of the
Cambodia resolution will not do
so. I shall be happy to join my
colleagues in the Senate in talking
with U.S. Congressmen. I will, if
necessary, pay my own travel
expenses to do so. I believe I may
be able to contribute special

expertise in this endeavor because
I have a long and varied
experience with research funding
including some DOD supported
work.
How about DOD research
support? I believe the system does
need change. The priorities are
wrong. More money needs to be
funneled to the great social
problems such as: poverty, race,
ecology, and pollution; less should
go to defense. However, I cannot
agree to immediate cessation of
DOD research. There are two
reasons. First, the shift must be
gradual if important university
operations are not to be
destroyed. DOD now provides
30% of Stanford's income. This is
not 30% of engineering, but 30%
of all departments. To cut off so
much without replacement would
cause so large a retrenchment
within the university that it
probably would be unable to
provide the leadership for change
and in the planning that are
needed for the great social
problems that face us.
Second, DOD research, as now
carried out at Stanford, involves
no more complicity in the war
than the work of the Medical
School, the Food Research
Institute, the English Department,
the East Asian Studies program,
and many other functions of the
university. The facts on which this
view is based are not simple, but I
will be glad to discuss them with
any members of the Stanford
community publicly or privately.
I will also supply on request a
memorandum outlining the nature
and purpose of engineering
research prepared last year for the
Academic Senate.

Lop-Sided Daily
Editor, THE DAILY:
If your editorial page is going
to continue to be so lop-sidedly
filled with articles by
non-students, suspended former
students, and known leaders of
the violent radical group whom
most of us would like to see
barred from the campus, how
about a factual article explaining
exactly what is the nature of the
"Pacific Studies Center"â€”its
purposes, funding, etc.?

Punitive Clause
Editor, The Daily:
I am the military counselor in
the Special Services Office of the
Dean of Students. I counsel
students having trouble with
ROTC and the Reserves. The
article in last Wednesday's DAILY
by David Brown entitled The
Unknown Soldier is factually
accurate as to regulations but
dangerously sanguine about the
ease of getting out of the Senior
Program of ROTC. The penalty
clause is NOT a dead letter, it
HAS been used in the past, and it
IS being applied at this moment.
ROTC students considering
dropping ROTC should see me
and an attorney BEFORE they
start any disenrollment
procedures. Even with ROTC
under fire, involuntary activation
for willful evasion is still a real
possibility. ROTC students should
proceed carefully, while the
Stanford Community should lend
all support possible to those
students wishing to get out
