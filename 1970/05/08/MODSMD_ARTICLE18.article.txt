# Stanford Free State
## Secede From Amerika 
### Jesse Cedarbaum 
Wednesday night, 2,000
Stanford students gleefully
approved a motion that Stanford
secede from the United States of
Amerika. Very few of those
gathered in Mem Aud that fateful
evening realized the'gravity of the
action they had taken so
flippantly; the whole idea was
taken more as a joke than as a
scenario for action.
Most of those who did take the
idea seriously were appalled at its
ramifications. One girl, after the
proposition had been passed over
and forgotten, stood up to the
microphone and launched a
Jewish-mother tirade at the
throng, pleading that the motion
be rescinded. "How can we do
this thing;" she asked. "We're here
to build kp our country and make
it better, not to leave it when we
don't like what's going on."
Several others raised trivial legal
points, such as what right do we
have to do this. How do we set up
a new currency system, what are
our trade relations with the
outside world to be, etc., etc.,
etc?
I think they missed the point.
Secession doesn't have to be as
serious as all that. But what we
can do by "seceding" from the
Union and setting up a new
"country" here at Stanford, is to
give ourselves a new frame of
reference in our struggle against
the evils in our society.
Amerika's Written History
Amerika's Declaration of
Independence states, that "We
hold these truths to be
self-evident . . . That, whenever
any Government becomes
destructive of these ends (to
preserve Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of Happiness), it is the

Right of the People to abolish it,
and to institute new Government,
laying its foundations upon these
principles."
The Government of the United
States (and that of Stanford
University, is destructive of these
ends. Young people are dying in
Viet Nam, Cambodia and at Kent
State as we continue to crush
Liberty in the name of Freedom
and Self-Determination. And who
can pursue Happiness in times like
these? This is what our secession
should say to President Nixon and
the rest of his country, not "We
don't like it, so we quit."
So you might ask, just what
does this "secession" mean, and
what can we do?
We Can Start Over
By setting up a new,
independent "country" we can, in
a manner of speaking, start over,
and set an example for others. We
can begin by setting up a new
government, in which students,
faculty and staff would be
equitably represented.
Contrary to ex-President
Pitzer's allegations, our purpose
would not be destructive to the
educational process. The life of
our country would be education
— educating ourselves and others
on how to stop the atrocious
crimes being committed around
the world in the name of the
Amerikan dream. Stanford would
become the year-'round teach-in
and teach-out center of the
Freedom Revolution.
Looking at ourselves as an
independent country: among
the first things we would find in
our self-education is that DOD
research money constitutes an
uninvited imperialist investment,
and that the presence of ROTC on

campus represents the threat of
foreign troops sent in to protect
that investment. In other words,
when combat-ready troops of the
Santa Clara Sheriff's Army invade
us, we are engaged in a war under
the same circumstances as Viet
Nam and Cambodia.
Non-Violent Guerillas
We must fight back. This can be
done in a non-violent guerilla
manner that cannot be coped with
by the other side.
Roving bands armed with those
most dangerous of weapons, the
printed word and the logical,
undefeatable argument, should be
sent out in a counter-offensive
against the surrounding
community with the intent of
educating people so that Amerika
can be shut down in protest. And
full-scale sabotage actions such as
blocking the vehicular approaches
to San Francisco or shutting down
the airport should be undertaken
to show others that so-called
"intellectual" college people are
capable of action. There's no limit
to what we could do. Abbie
Hoffman would call it
"Revolution for the Hell of It."
But it's more like Revolution
against the Hell of it.

preserve Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of Happiness), it is the

Right of the People to abolish it,
and to institute new Government,
laying its foundations upon these
principles."
The Government of the United
States (and that of Stanford
University, is destructive of these
ends. Young people are dying in
Viet Nam, Cambodia and at Kent
State as we continue to crush
Liberty in the name of Freedom
and Self-Determination. And who
can pursue Happiness in times like
these? This is what our secession
should say to President Nixon and
the rest of his country, not "We
don't like it, so we quit."
So you might ask, just what
does this "secession" mean, and
what can we do?
We Can Start Over
By setting up a new,
independent "country" we can, in
a manner of speaking, start over,
and set an example for others. We
can begin by setting up a new
government, in which students,
faculty and staff would be
equitably represented.
Contrary to ex-President
Pitzer's allegations, our purpose
would not be destructive to the
educational process. The life of
our country would be education
— educating ourselves and others
on how to stop the atrocious
crimes being committed around
the world in the name of the
Amerikan dream. Stanford would
become the year-'round teach-in
and teach-out center of the
Freedom Revolution.
Looking at ourselves as an
independent country: among
the first things we would find in
our self-education is that DOD
research money constitutes an
uninvited imperialist investment,
and that the presence of ROTC on

campus represents the threat of
foreign troops sent in to protect
that investment. In other words,
when combat-ready troops of the
Santa Clara Sheriff's Army invade
us, we are engaged in a war under
the same circumstances as Viet
Nam and Cambodia.
Non-Violent Guerillas
We must fight back. This can be
done in a non-violent guerilla
manner that cannot be coped with
by the other side.
Roving bands armed with those
most dangerous of weapons, the
printed word and the logical,
undefeatable argument, should be
sent out in a counter-offensive
against the surrounding
community with the intent of
educating people so that Amerika
can be shut down in protest. And
full-scale sabotage actions such as
blocking the vehicular approaches
to San Francisco or shutting down
the airport should be undertaken
to show others that so-called
"intellectual" college people are
capable of action. There's no limit
to what we could do. Abbie
Hoffman would call it
"Revolution for the Hell of It."
But it's more like Revolution
against the Hell of it.
Wednesday night, 2,000
Stanford students gleefully
approved a motion that Stanford
secede from the United States of
Amerika. Very few of those
gathered in Mem Aud that fateful
evening realized the'gravity of the
action they had taken so
flippantly; the whole idea was
taken more as a joke than as a
scenario for action.
Most of those who did take the
idea seriously were appalled at its
ramifications. One girl, after the
proposition had been passed over
and forgotten, stood up to the
microphone and launched a
Jewish-mother tirade at the
throng, pleading that the motion
be rescinded. "How can we do
this thing;" she asked. "We're here
to build kp our country and make
it better, not to leave it when we
don't like what's going on."
Several others raised trivial legal
points, such as what right do we
have to do this. How do we set up
a new currency system, what are
our trade relations with the
outside world to be, etc., etc.,
etc?
I think they missed the point.
Secession doesn't have to be as
serious as all that. But what we
can do by "seceding" from the
Union and setting up a new
"country" here at Stanford, is to
give ourselves a new frame of
reference in our struggle against
the evils in our society.
Amerika's Written History
Amerika's Declaration of
Independence states, that "We
hold these truths to be
self-evident . . . That, whenever
any Government becomes

pursuit of Happiness), it is the

Right of the People to abolish it,
and to institute new Government,
laying its foundations upon these
principles."
The Government of the United
