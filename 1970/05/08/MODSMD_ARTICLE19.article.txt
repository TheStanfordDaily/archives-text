# On-ROTC Coalition Position Explained
## 
### 
In the rational void of the past
few weeks, an intense propaganda
campaign has obscured the logical
arguments concerning the status
of ROTC as Stanford. In light of
the following, the On-ROTC
Coalition strongly urges
continuation of the ROTC
program:
1. ROTC courses should be
offered for those students who
wish to take them. The expulsion
of ROTC from campus for
"moral" reasons would set an
undesirable precedent for the
elimination of other controversial
courses
2. ROTC is an important
liberalizing influence within the
armed forces. The continued
presence of substantial numbers
of officers from a wide variety of
civilian educational institutions
and backgrounds is one of the
best guarantees against the
establishment of a military caste
in this country.
3. In return for $25,000 of
indirect university subsidy, ROTC
supplied $150,000 in scholarship
funds, the burden of which
Stanford would have to absorb
should in ROTC program be
abolished.
4. The voluntary character of
ROTC makes it a possible
alternative to the selective .service
system and a first step towards an
all-volunteer army.
5. The ROTC issue is distinct
from foreign policy-making. The
destruction of is a
poorly-focused and
counterproductive means of
opposing an unpopular war. The

United States armed forces all
continue to be essential; we
cannot accept their dissolut nas
a desirable goal. In an;
ending ROTC would leaa to
recruitment of officers through
less acceptable means, eliminating
the humanizing influence of
college trained officers.
6. Specific unpopular aspects of
the ROTC program have served as
arguments for the elimination of
the entire program. Yet even
objections to these relatively
minor points are not valid. The
much maligned "punitive clause"
is rarely exercised and when
exercised is a justified legal
execution of a contract. College
juniors should be mature enough
to sign this binding contract.
The possibility of academic
credit for ROTC courses should
be left open. A categorical denial
of credit regardless of content is
unreasonable. It is the
responsibility of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies to
determine the academic merit of
courses and award credit on that
basis. The university retains
control over selection of military
science instructors and there is
neither official nor actual control
over course content of class
discussion by an instructor's
superior.
We strongly urge the Senate of
the Academic Council to consider
these arguments. We trust that
decisions will be made on the
basis of rational arguments and
not be influenced by violent
coercion.

In the rational void of the past
few weeks, an intense propaganda
campaign has obscured the logical
arguments concerning the status
of ROTC as Stanford. In light of
the following, the On-ROTC
Coalition strongly urges
continuation of the ROTC
program:
1. ROTC courses should be
offered for those students who
wish to take them. The expulsion
of ROTC from campus for
"moral" reasons would set an
undesirable precedent for the
elimination of other controversial
courses
2. ROTC is an important
liberalizing influence within the
armed forces. The continued
presence of substantial numbers
of officers from a wide variety of
civilian educational institutions
and backgrounds is one of the
best guarantees against the
establishment of a military caste
in this country.
3. In return for $25,000 of
indirect university subsidy, ROTC
supplied $150,000 in scholarship
funds, the burden of which
Stanford would have to absorb
should in ROTC program be
abolished.
4. The voluntary character of
ROTC makes it a possible
alternative to the selective .service
system and a first step towards an
all-volunteer army.
5. The ROTC issue is distinct
from foreign policy-making. The
destruction of is a
poorly-focused and
counterproductive means of
opposing an unpopular war. The

United States armed forces all
continue to be essential; we
cannot accept their dissolut nas
a desirable goal. In an;
ending ROTC would leaa to
recruitment of officers through
less acceptable means, eliminating
the humanizing influence of
college trained officers.
6. Specific unpopular aspects of
the ROTC program have served as
arguments for the elimination of
the entire program. Yet even
objections to these relatively
minor points are not valid. The
much maligned "punitive clause"
is rarely exercised and when
exercised is a justified legal
execution of a contract. College
juniors should be mature enough
to sign this binding contract.
The possibility of academic
credit for ROTC courses should
be left open. A categorical denial
of credit regardless of content is
unreasonable. It is the
responsibility of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies to
determine the academic merit of
courses and award credit on that
basis. The university retains
control over selection of military
science instructors and there is
neither official nor actual control
over course content of class
discussion by an instructor's
superior.
We strongly urge the Senate of
the Academic Council to consider
these arguments. We trust that
decisions will be made on the
basis of rational arguments and
not be influenced by violent
coercion.
