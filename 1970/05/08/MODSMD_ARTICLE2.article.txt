# Academic Changes
## 
### 
In an unprecedented move President Kenneth
Pitzer yesterday initiated "special opportunities
and flexibility for students and faculty ..." who
wish to respond to the Cambodian crisis.
The President suggested that faculty members
by "free to make new arrangements as to
schedules and requirements" and that instructors
grant incompletes "... without requiring the
customary individual justification."
In addition, Pitzer advanced the date for
dropping courses or units to the first day of final
exams.
The President emphasized, however, that
" . . . all academic personnel at Stanford remain
under obligation to fulfill their academic
responsibilities ..."
The statement was endorsed by a unanimous
resolution of the faculty Senate at their afternoon
meeting.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Albert
Hastorf raised the question of extending the
pass-fail option at the Senate Meeting in line with
these recommendations.
Pitzer answered, "I would urge departments
and schools to be as flexible with regard to this as
possible."
The Senate in the resolution offered by history

Professor David Potter, stated it "enthusiastically
supports the policy of President Pitzer to
encourage broad options during the remainder of
the Spring Quarter.
"The Senate affirms its readiness to allow the
latitude necessary for such innovative responses to
the central issues now current," the resolution
concluded.
Both the statement and the Senate resolution
seemed to leave final decisions on implementation
of the options to the discretion of individual
departments.
Questioned on how liberal departments could
be in interpreting the Potter resolution, Hastorf
said, "I hope they will be as flexible as possible."
Pitzer last night stated, "I think the faculty
members in all ordinary circumstances are going to
grant an incomplete just upon the student's
asking."
The newly elected ASSU Council of Presidents
also issued a short statement in response to Pitzer's
proposals. It read, "We urge all departments to
meet Monday to develop plans to accomodate
students who wish to continue work on the strike
under any options approved by the faculty Senate
yesterday.
The text of Pitzer's statement is on p.4.
