# Press Conference
## Professors Stress Strike’s Positive Aspects 
### CATHY COOPER 
Newsmen attended a press
conference yesterday with
representatives of academic
departments involved in political
action in opposition to the war in
Southeast Asia.
Math Department chairman
Ralph Phillips directed the
conference which was called
because of feelings that the media
coverage of the strike has failed to
convey to the public the depth
and significance of the Stanford
protest.
Phillip Zimbardo, professor of
social psychology, told the
newsmen that the Political Action
Coordinating Committee was
working to prevent Stanford from
closing. "Instead," he said, "we
must use the University as a
power base against the common
enemy—those who would divide
the country, those who have given
us hypocrisy instead of dialogue."
The Indo-China Political Action
Group composed of 400 faculty
and students said they were
working to show that American
policy can be changed through
established political channels. "We

hope for successful political
action because the patience of the
American people is exhausted,"
explained Ben Page, political
science instructor. "The
individuals in the department of
political science are united to a
man in opposition to Nixon's
policy in Southeast Asia," he said.
Page noted that Congress has
shown only minimal opposition to
the Cambodian invasion. "Yet the
House of Representatives has
come a long way in a short time.
Congressional offices now indicate
that the Hatfield-McGovern
amendment to limit
appropriations for the war has a
substantial chance of gaining
support."
Representatives of departments
including math, chemistry,
psychology, computer science,
communications, German,
political science and law told
newsmen about faculty and
student activities.
Local Surveys
Professor Henry Breitrose of
the communications department
reported that a survey of Santa
Clara and San Mateo county

residents showed that only 7
percent of those called perceive
Stanford students as "very
reliable" sources of news about
the war in Cambodia. A
communication department poll
revealed, that while the majority
of those polled in the two
counties don't support the war, a
very high percentage refused to
respond to questions. Breitrose
explained that these were
confused people, caught between
conflicting currents of
information. "It is clear that we
have spent entirely too much time
talking to ourselves and not nearly
enough time in the surrounding
communities."
The problem of communication
was again highlighted by other
survey results showing that only 1
percent of those contacted believe
that most of the people at
Stanford are participating in the
strike.
Communications students are
also involved in studying the
content of media coverage of the
strike, aiding visiting TV crews to
cover strike activities and
preparing a newsreel on the strike

for viewing in the community.
PACC Efforts
Nearly 2000 students are
engaged in concrete political
action through the Political
Action Coordinating Committee.
Operating out of the basement of
Cubberly, PACC is running a
clearing house for all strike
information as well as
coordinating the efforts of some
50 different small groups involved
in projects ranging from letter
campaigns, canvassing, and alumni
relations to calling a national
work stoppage in protest of the
Cambodian invasion.
The Indo-China Workshop
based in the East Asian Studies
Center has mobilized 250 people
over the past two weeks to
assemble and distribute
background information on
Southeast Asia. Other activities of
the workshop include operating a
speakers bureau, and doing
research for the Stanford
delegation in Washington.
"We must get to the
technocracy with our concern,"
asserted Alan Kay, graduate
student in the computer science

department, and in response,
members of that department have
been visiting local industrial
corporations. Chemistry
department has focused on the
upcoming meeting of industrial
affiliates of the department who
are normally interested only in
research in chemistry.
Woody Guernsey, a third year
law student, outlined the efforts
of the law school to effect
members of the legal community
all over the country. Law students
are also doing research on legal
manoevers against the Cambodian
war and the consequences of
refusing to pay federal income
taxes as a protest measure.
The math department has
undertaken to contact other math
departments across the country to
explain the Stanford action and
elict support for the peace
movement. Several hundred
dollars have been raised for a
campaign of newspaper
advertisements in local and
national papers in opposition to
the invasion of Cambodia.
