# Navy Plans Mekong River Assault
## 
### 
(AP) â€” The Navy plans to send
boats up a 60-mile stretch of the
Mekong River tomorrow in an
amphitious assault on the
Cambodian capital of Phnom
Penh, official sources said today.
President Nixon had said he
would not send American forces
beyond 21.7 miles into Cambodia
without seeking Congressional
approval.
The Navy boats will be in for
some sharp fighting. North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces
are dotted along most of the

waterway and control the ferry
crossing at Neak Luong, 37 miles
South west of Phnom Penh.
The operation will take half of
the 500 Americans involved all
the way to Phnom Penh. The
sources said there will be 40 U.S.
boats and 60 South Vietnamese
craft.
The South Vietnamese part of
the operation was first disclosed
by the foreign ministry in an
unprecedented public
announcement of a future
operation.
There also were reports that
U.S. Seventh Fleet air-craft
carriers were maneuvering in the
Gulf of Tonkin off North
Vietnam but the intention was
not clear.
In announcing the operation,
the Foreign Ministry said air cover

would be provided for the flotilla.
Assault on Port
In a related development, it was
learned that the government is
considering an amphibious assault
at the Big port of Kimpong Som,
formerly Sihanoukville, and the
Cambodian base of Ream,
reported to be threatened by
North Vietnamese troops only 20
miles away. Ream is 15 miles
southeast of Kompong Som.
Sources said the American part
of the task force in the Phnom,
Penh operation on the Mekong
will include 38 gunboats armed
with .50-caliber machine guns and
two 350-foot long landing ships to
be used as command posts The
landing ships also will help carry
back any of the 200,000
Vietnamese living in Phnom Penh
who want to return to their

homeland.
All the Way
The 60 South Vietnamese navy
gunboats will have mixed
American and Vietnamese crews.
Informants said some of the
American boats will go all the way
up the river, the other only half
way.
The Foreign Ministry said the
flotilla also will be protected by
South Vietnamese troops,
presumably riding in attack boats
along with their U.S. infantry
advisers.
Meanwhile, a 10,000 man
South Vietnamese task force and
its American advisers were pulled
out of Cambodia. But a fresh
ground force prepared to cross the
border against an untouched
enemy base camp in the western
Mekong Delta, and some 40,000
other allied troops continued their

drives in six other areas of
Cambodia.
Allied Claims
Allied headquarters claimed the
operations in Cambodia, now in
their eight day, have killed more
than 3000 North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong and netted hundreds ot
tons of war materials and
foodstuffs used to support North
Vietnamese attacks in South
Vietnam.
The war materials seized or
destroyed include nearly 6000
weapons, 100 supply trucks and
788 tons of rice, the allied
commands said.
According to incomplete
reports, 30 Americans and 176
South Vietnamese troops have
been killed in the Cambodian
operations, and 79 U.S. and 840
South Vietnamese troops have
been wounded.
