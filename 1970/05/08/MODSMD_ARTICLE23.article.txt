# Text Of Pitzer's Statement
## 
### 
In my statement last Sunday, I
encouraged schools and departments to
guide various activities discussing
national and international issues which
concern all of us and about which we
have deeply held beliefs. I listened over
KZSU to some of the teach-ins and
other discussions and was greatly
impressed by the sincere interest in and
penetrating discussion of important
problems. There has been a lot of
extraordinary education this week.
We now face the question of how
the University can combine the
completion of this year's academic
obligations with due attention to the
national and international crisis that
now weighs upon us all so heavily.
Somehow we must accommodate and
reconcile the interests of students who
wish to study and take degrees, of
faculty who wish to pursue important
educational objectives, and of all those
who, out of conscience and concern
for the future of mankind, feel that
they must suspend as much as possible
their normal activities until the crisis is
resolved.
Individual schools and departments
must work out arrangements that suit
their particular circumstances. But
some basic principles should be
observed that will help preserve
Stanford as a genuine university. To
this end we must remain heedful of
individual rights of faculty and
students to teach, learn, and do
research.
I propose that, for the remainder of
this term, we follow an expanded
pattern of activitiesâ€”a "period of extra
commitment." This will require extra
time and effort on the part of the
faculty. The exact pattern will vary
from school to school and from
department to department. The
essential features include fulfillment of
our basic educational responsibilities
together with special opportunities and
flexibility for students and faculty to
deal with the current crisis. More
particularly, I suggest:

First, all academic personnel at
Stanford remain under obligation to
fulfill their academic responsibilities
for the remainder of this quarter; in
the discharge of their teaching
responsibilities, however, they are free
to make new arrangements as to
schedules and requirements, consistent
with their obligations to those students
who wish to carry on their academic
pursuits.
Second, I encourage all teachers at
Stanford to carry on additional
activities, such as special seminars,
discussions, and the kinds of teach-ins
that have proven so successful this
week. Let us emphasize the need to
teach out; perhaps the best example we
have of this so far is our Washington
delegation. The many primary
campaigns now underway across the
country provide other opportunities to
translate belief into action.
Third, where students request
incompletes this term, I urge that the
faculty grant them without requiring
the customary individual justification.
Fourth, in order to make it possible
for students ot make new
arrangements, the date for dropping
courses or units in this quarter is
advanced from May 13 to the first day
of final examinations.
It should be clear to all that neither
these nor any other constructive
arrangements can be made effective for
the remainder of this quarter so long as
faculty, students, and staff are
physically prevented from pursuing
their responsibilities. Therefore, I ask
all in the Stanford community to join
me in the commitment I have
described here and to dedicate
themselves to opposing force and
coercion as means of achieving goals at
Stanford.
These arrangements should make
possible fulfillment of the many goals
held by so many different people at
Stanford. Furthermore, I believe these
goals can be reached in ways that are

compatible with the University's
essential commitment to the pursuit of
knowledge. We must search, we must

learn, and we must all, as individuals,
put our knowledge to the service of
action.
