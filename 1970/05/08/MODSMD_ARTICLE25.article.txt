# Committee Urges Sale Of US Bonds

### 
A National Redemption Day
for Americans to cash in their
U.S. Savings Bonds as a positive
portest against President Nixon's
Cambodian policy has been called
for May 15 by a student-faculty
group.
The action is billed as a
"non-violent, legal and effective"
expression of disagreement and a
"financial vote" against the
Administration's conduct of the
war in Woutheast Asia.
"By redeeming your bonds you
are depriving the federal
government of an inexpensive
source of funds," the group
declared. "You can support a
peaceful America if you reinvest
your money in more constructive
alternatives."
There are $51.1 billion invested
in U.S. Savings Bonds throughout
the nation.
The idea for the national bond
redemption campaign originated
after Fortney Stark Jr., president
of the Security National Bank in
Oakland, Calif., urged his
depositers to sell their bonds and
invest in more porfitable
securities.
Within a week of his statement,
the U.S. Treasury Department
cancelled the Oakland Bank's
right to sell or redeem U.S.
Savings Bonds.'

"The Treasury ballyhoos the
notion that savings bonds are a
good investment," Stark stated in
an open letter to holders of U.S.
Savings Bonds. "They are not.
They pay only 5 percent, which
looks pretty anemic when you
consider that the 1969 rate of
inflation was 6 percent."
The Stanford group, led by
Psychology Professor Philip
Zimbardo, was organized during
the campus-wide student strike
which began last week to protest
the Cambodian invasion.
Students from the Law School,
the Departments of Psychology
and Communication, and the
Graduate School of Business are
among those participating in the
campaign.
The group suggests that citizens
who cash in Savings Bonds should
invest the money in areas which
promote social interests.
For example, Savings and Loan
Association deposits, which earn
from 5 to 6 percent interest and
are often "Compounded daily, will
expand the supply of funds
available to the mortgage market.
This will lead to an increase in
much-needed home building.
Other suggestions include:
—Tax-Exempt Municipal
Bonds, which give 4.5 percent
interest for l-to-2-year maturities
and 6.5 percent for 18-to-20-year
maturities.
—Public Utility Bonds, which
yield about 8.75 percent and may
be sold at any time.
"This can be a symbolic act to
commit yourself against the war,"
said Prof. Zimbardo. "We are
loyal Americans working for a
peaceful America."
