# NROTC Defended In Panel Discussion
## 
### 
The Navy ROTC program
stated the case for its presence on
campus yesterday morning at a
discussion meeting in the Arroyo
Lounge. The officers and
midshipmen present based their
arguments on the practical
realities of national security and
the continuing need for a military
in the United States.
In a brief opening statement,
Midshipman Chris Rafferty of
Stanford's NROTC cited ROTC as
a humanizing influence within the
Armed Forces. As one of the
other midshipmen commented
later, "If I have to be in the
military and follow an officer, I'd
rather follow an officer who is a
Stanford graduate than one from
one of the military academies."
In addition, Rafferty felt that
ROTC programs would become
more desirable in the future
because of the change in the
student deferment classifications.
Colonel Robert Thomas,
chairman of the NROTC program,
had much to say in favor of the
program. He feels that graduates
of ROTC programs provide a
means for the military to get in
touch with the outside world, in
contrast with the rather cloistered
atmosphere of the military
academies.
Advantages
ROTC also has advantages over
the Officer Candidate Schools,
according to Col. Thomas. The
OCS program is "a one-shot
affair," a fairly brief training
session providing no practical
experience, as opposed to ROTC,
which continues throughout a
student's college career and
includes training cruises during
the summer, providing the navy
with "more committed" officers.
Col. Thomas answered

questions concerning the
"coercive" nature of the punitive
clause by presenting the issue as
one of contractual agreement.
When a young man signs up for
ROTC and signs his contract
during his junior year, he is in
effect enlisting, and he is required
to fulfill his enlistment
requirements whether he does so
as a ROTC-trained officer or an
enlisted man.
Rafferty raised an objection
concerning the term "punitive
clause" itself. "It is a misnomer.

Service in the Navy is not
considered to be a form of
punishment. Rather, it is an
honorable endeavor."
He also stressed the need to
make the distinction between
ROTC programs and the larger
goals of the Off-ROTC movement.
"NROTC has nothing to do with
national policy, nothing to do
with Indochina, nothing to do
with what is going on in Asia. You
must clear away emotion and ask
yourself how this country is really
run, where the power lies."
