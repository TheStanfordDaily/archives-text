# Wednesday Night Decision
## Strike Demands Added 
### 
A meeting of 2000 Stanford strikers Wednesday
night passed almost unanimously a two-fold
resolution designed to implement the three
national demands of the strike and to free
students, faculty, and staff to work toward their
realization.
The resolution stated, "We feel that at this time
in history it is imperative that the University
community remain unintimidated by threats of
repression, and that is suspend its normal activities

the war. To achieve these goals we feel that the
University must be reconstituted to serve as an
educational base and a power base where people
here and in the area can work together to end the
imperialist destruction of Southeast Asia."

campus by the end of this academic year.

determine the content and purpose of present
