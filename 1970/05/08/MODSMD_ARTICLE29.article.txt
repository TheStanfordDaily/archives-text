# Advisor Rips Nixon's Policy

### 
WASHINGTON - The Nixon
Administration's attacks on young
dissenters have been denounced as
"inflammatory rhetoric" by the
President's own youth advisor.
Anthony J. Moffett, whose
rumored resignation as director of
the Office of Students and Youth
became official today, issued a
strongly worded statement on the
administration's attitudes toward
youth.
Moffett said Nixon "has shown
that he does not understand
young people, nor does he wish to
communicate with them."
Nixon 'Bums'
He described the President's
characterization of rioting
students as "bums" and his
statement that the death of four
Kent State University students by
National Guard bullets should

"remind us once again that when
dissent turns to violence it invites
tragedy."
Moffett's blast followed a letter
to Nixon from Interior Secretary
Walter Hickel suggesting the
administration has shown a lack
of concern for young people.
"A tone has been set by this
administration that has tended to
increase polarization," Moffett
said. "The inflammatory rhetoric
in the air by administration
officials did not help the situation
there (Kent State)."
Moffett, 26, a graduate of
Syracuse University accused the
administration of taking a
repressive stand against youth. He
charged this policy "has served to
divide the country, not bring the
country together."
Moffett was named head of the
office of Students and Youth in

the Office of Education when the
post was created last fall. His job
was to lobby for youth causes and
to provide better communication
with students in high school and
college.
His office did not make policy
but was supposed to help student
groups find government money
for projects.
Moffett, a native of Suffield,
Conn., said he made his decision
to quit after the President's move
into Cambodia, and after Nixon's
statement calling student
protesters "bums."
"We're in a very tough position
now in this country and the
polarization, if it continues, is
going to become even more
dangerous than any of us have
imagined," he said.
"What we need is some courage
on the part of everyone to begin

to solve these problems. I am
somewhat skeptical about the
leadership of this administration
giving us that courage ..."
