Elections commissioner Jan Westfall announced last night that
she has received sufficient petitions to schedule a special
referendum on Monday and Tuesday on the Strike demands.
Voters will be asked to approve or disapprove of four
statements concerning freeing all political prisoners, offing
ROTC, DOD contracts, and the Indochina war. The text of the
questions which are not available at this time will be published in
Monday's Daily.
