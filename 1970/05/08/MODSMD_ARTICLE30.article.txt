# Strike Cripples More Events
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Widespread college and
university shutdowns, in
conjunction with the nationwide
anti-war strike, are crippling
amateur athletic programs across
the nation this weekend. And at
Stanford, a petition condemning
U.S. war expansion in Southeast
Asia has been signed by nearly
100 varsity athletes.
The Pacific-B's Southern
Division Relays, scheduled for
UCLA tomorrow, have been
cancelled, as have all Pac-8 events
scheduled for the UC Berkeley
campus.
The 44th annual West Coast
Relays, set for Fresno, have also
been called off and not
rescheduled.
The Stanford crew race with
Cal, Saturday morning at
Redwood City, is still scheduled,
as are Stanford lacrosse games
against Oregon, at 2 p.m.
Saturday and at the East Bay
Lacrosse Club Sunday.
Elsewhere, according to
Pacific-8 director Tom Hamilton,
there have been no schedule
changes. All baseball games in
Washington and Oregon (with
Stanford, Cal, USC, and UCLA)
"are on," Hamilton said yesterday
afternoon. So too is the Pac-8
Northern Division track meet,
scheduled Saturday for Seattle.
A Stanford-Cal tennis match,
set for Berkeley Saturday,will be
rescheduled if possible, according
to a source at Cal.
Stanford's first football
intrasquad game will be played in
Stanford Stadium at 3 p.m.
Saturday.
In the East, weekend events are
being cancelled as athletes join in
the protest. A boycott of the
Heptagonal track championships
in New Haven is being urged by
Princeton's track captain, Herman
Stevenson. Individual teams at
four schools - Princeton,
Columbia, Williams and
Dartmouth - have withdrawn from
competition.
TTie Stanford petition was
initiated by Wade Killefer and
received the signatures of nearly
100 Stanford athletes, including
virtually the entire swim team and
almost half of the football team.
Text of Athletes' Statement:
We, the undersigned varsity athletes
at Stanford University, in response to
the tragic events of the one past week,
are hereby resolved to:
A) Condemn the continuation of the
war in Southeast Asia and its recent
expansion into Cambodia.
B) Condemn the act of bombing by
American Forces in North Vietnam.
C) Condemn the reactionary
response to student dissent resulting in
the death of four Kent State University
Students.
D) Assert and urge the validity and
necessity for the continuation of
responsible dissent and rational
discourse within our democratic
society.
E) Support the national student
strike in its opposition to current
United States policy in Southeast Asia.

been called off and not
rescheduled.
The Stanford crew race with
Cal, Saturday morning at
Redwood City, is still scheduled,
as are Stanford lacrosse games
against Oregon, at 2 p.m.
Saturday and at the East Bay
Lacrosse Club Sunday.
Elsewhere, according to
Pacific-8 director Tom Hamilton,
there have been no schedule
changes. All baseball games in
Washington and Oregon (with
Stanford, Cal, USC, and UCLA)
"are on," Hamilton said yesterday
afternoon. So too is the Pac-8
Northern Division track meet,
scheduled Saturday for Seattle.
A Stanford-Cal tennis match,
set for Berkeley Saturday,will be
rescheduled if possible, according
to a source at Cal.
Stanford's first football
intrasquad game will be played in
Stanford Stadium at 3 p.m.
Saturday.
In the East, weekend events are
being cancelled as athletes join in
the protest. A boycott of the
Heptagonal track championships
in New Haven is being urged by
Princeton's track captain, Herman
Stevenson. Individual teams at
four schools - Princeton,
Columbia, Williams and
Dartmouth - have withdrawn from
competition.
TTie Stanford petition was
initiated by Wade Killefer and
received the signatures of nearly
100 Stanford athletes, including
virtually the entire swim team and
almost half of the football team.
Text of Athletes' Statement:
We, the undersigned varsity athletes
at Stanford University, in response to
the tragic events of the one past week,
are hereby resolved to:
A) Condemn the continuation of the
war in Southeast Asia and its recent
expansion into Cambodia.
B) Condemn the act of bombing by
American Forces in North Vietnam.
C) Condemn the reactionary
response to student dissent resulting in
the death of four Kent State University
Students.
D) Assert and urge the validity and
necessity for the continuation of
responsible dissent and rational
discourse within our democratic
society.
E) Support the national student
strike in its opposition to current
United States policy in Southeast Asia.
