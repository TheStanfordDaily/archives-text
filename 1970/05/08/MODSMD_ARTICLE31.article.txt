# Free Grid Show Tomorrow
## 
### FRED LEESON 
With some of its top players
overseas and a few others out for
medical reasons, Stanford's
football varsity makes its 1970
debut in the Stadium tomorrow
afternoon in an intrasquad game
starting at 3.
The session is open to the
public at no charge.
Which, considering the
spiralling cost of living, is even a
bigger bargain than a year ago.
The "red and white" game,
pitting the first team offense and
second team defense versus the
second team offense and the first
team defense, marks the three
quarter point of spring practice.
Standing in a frosty breeze at
the end of Wednesday's session
Coach John Ralston reflected on
the first three weeks and said,
"All in all we're doing all right.
"We're coming along fine and
I'm real pleased. The general
attitude has been good and we've

operations for torn cartilage;
Dennis Moore, who injured his
knee last fall is not working out

But the rest of the big guns will
all be there, and the teams have
been constructed so that the first

The three weeks of spring ball
have also begun to answer some of

year with a broken leg, finished at .282

36 runs batted in through 41 games.
The Indians are presently in last place
in the southern division of the l'ac-8

one game away from their league title

league ledger. Wednesday they dumped
second place Santa Clara, 5-4, with
Tom Changnon picking up the victory
on the mound. A game scheduled for

Ron Kadziel has been moved
from tight end and will probably
start as one outside linebacker,
and Jeff 1 Siemon has been
switched from a defensive back to
middle linebacker. Mike Simone, a
transfer from Golden West JC and
Tom Sones are key contenders for
the third slot, with Simone
currently having the edge.
The offensive line—which let
quarterback Plunkett get dropped
only ten times all last season—has
four openings as center Sande,
one of the best in the country, is
the only returning starter.
It appears now that Steve Jubb,
who has added 15 pounds to get
up to 250, and Dan Lightfoot will
probably be starting on one side
at tackle and guard.
The other side is still quite wide
open, with prime prospects
including Bill Meyers (a redshirt
last year), Younger Klippert (who
has been off to a slow start with
back problems), Art Smiley (a
converted tight end), Terrell

All-American candidate —
sophomores Bob Berry and Bill
Scott figure to be the back-up

Another interesting back-up
scramble is underway at
quarterback where four players,
Jesse Freitas, Mike Boryla, Ted
Bleymaier and Ted Cordial, seek
the opportunity to play behind
Jim Plunkett.
Boryla and Freitas have gotten
most of the work so far, Ralston
notes, but says that "Bleymaier
and Cordial are still in it."
Ralston also had praise for
running backs Jim Kehl, Eric
Cross and Barr Curry, who shoulc
give Stanford good depth behind
Jackie Brown--who has been
particularly impressive—and
Hillary Shockley in the offensive
backfield.

A second stadium scrimmage
has been set for May 16 at 2 p.m.
which will mark the end of the
month-long spring drills.

With some of its top players
overseas and a few others out for
medical reasons, Stanford's
football varsity makes its 1970
debut in the Stadium tomorrow
afternoon in an intrasquad game
starting at 3.
The session is open to the
public at no charge.
Which, considering the
spiralling cost of living, is even a
bigger bargain than a year ago.
The "red and white" game,
pitting the first team offense and
second team defense versus the
second team offense and the first
team defense, marks the three
quarter point of spring practice.

the end of Wednesday's session
Coach John Ralston reflected on
the first three weeks and said,
"All in all we're doing all right.
"We're coming along fine and
I'm real pleased. The general
attitude has been good and we've

with douhleheaders slated against
Washington State today and

have no batters in the league's lop ten,

Eight potential starters on next

Saturday as John Sande, Tim
McClure, Bill Alexander, and
Demea Washington are overseas;
Jim Kauffman and Bob Moore
have recently undergone knee
operations for torn cartilage;
Dennis Moore, who injured his
knee last fall is not working out
yet; and Mike Ewing is playing
baseball.
But the rest of the big guns will
all be there, and the teams have
been constructed so that the first
offense will be facing the first
defense.
The three weeks of spring ball
have also begun to answer some of
the problems of graduation, filling
holes at linebacker and on the
offensive line.
The Cards have switched their
defense to a 4-3-4 configuration,
meaning that they will operate
with three linebackers instead of
the two used last year.

.333 mark. Mike Nelson, cm I for the
year with a broken leg, finished at .282
with five doubles, eight home runs and
36 runs batted in through 41 games.
The Indians are presently in last place
in the southern division of the l'ac-8
with a 5-6 league record.
Meanwhile, the soph-frosh were just
one game away from their league title
Thursday, having compiled a 17-4
league ledger. Wednesday they dumped
second place Santa Clara, 5-4, with
Tom Changnon picking up the victory
on the mound. A game scheduled for
tomorrow in Herkeley has been

Ron Kadziel has been moved
from tight end and will probably
start as one outside linebacker,
and Jeff 1 Siemon has been
switched from a defensive back to
middle linebacker. Mike Simone, a
transfer from Golden West JC and
Tom Sones are key contenders for
the third slot, with Simone
currently having the edge.
The offensive line—which let
quarterback Plunkett get dropped
only ten times all last season—has
four openings as center Sande,
one of the best in the country, is
the only returning starter.
It appears now that Steve Jubb,
who has added 15 pounds to get
up to 250, and Dan Lightfoot will
probably be starting on one side
at tackle and guard.
The other side is still quite wide
open, with prime prospects
including Bill Meyers (a redshirt
last year), Younger Klippert (who
has been off to a slow start with
back problems), Art Smiley (a
converted tight end), Terrell

sophomores Bob Berry and Bill
Scott figure to be the back-up
candidates there.
Another interesting back-up
scramble is underway at
quarterback where four players,
Jesse Freitas, Mike Boryla, Ted
Bleymaier and Ted Cordial, seek
the opportunity to play behind
Jim Plunkett.
Boryla and Freitas have gotten
most of the work so far, Ralston
notes, but says that "Bleymaier
and Cordial are still in it."
Ralston also had praise for
running backs Jim Kehl, Eric
Cross and Barr Curry, who shoulc
give Stanford good depth behind
Jackie Brown--who has been
particularly impressive—and
Hillary Shockley in the offensive
backfield.
