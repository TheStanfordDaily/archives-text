# Playing The Money Game

(Editor's note The following is
the second of a two part series on
athletic recruiting at Stanford
This installment explains the
financial background to the
recruiting process here.)

Scholarships are concentrated
in the five biggest sports —football,
basketball, baseball, track and
swimming. Naturally football is
the biggest recepient with an
average of 80 players receiving
athletic connected aid each year.
Track has been next, averaging 21
athletes, then comes basketball
with 15 and baseball with 14.
Swimming has made the biggest
jump in aid offered, going from
two athletes on aid in both 1960
and 1961 to an average of 12 over
each of the last five years.
A lot of people are mistaken in
thinking that the big gates of
football games should greatly help
Stanford's athletic aid program.
But to begin with, Stanford does
not get all of the receipts. The
money is divided between
Stanford the and other schools in
the league, in part to help defray
expenses at a couple of schools
whose football programs are in
the red. And what football
receipts Stanford does get have to
support the other 12 spoils and
the operating expenses of the
athletic department. There is
absolutely no revenue left over for
student aid.
3,500 Members
So where does the money come
from? The major source is a 3500
member organization made up of
Stanford alumni and friends called
the Buck Club. The expressed
purpose of the Buck Club "is to

USC, waives tuition for a number
of athletes. But Kmetovic does
not see the other schools as having
that good financial situations. He
claims that other schools are
experiencing financial difficulties
and may have to also cut back aid.
Thus, the argument often raised
for USC and UCLA's athletic
superiority, that they can offer so
many scholarships, is not that
valid. More likely, the real reason
that USC and UCLA are so

each school in the conference
could offer 12 Pac-8 Achievement
Awards, which gave full rides with
no work provisions. According to
the new ruling other schools can
now offer unlimited grants of this
nature but Stanford does not have
the money to be able to do this.
So many Stanford athletes will
continue to work as part of their
aid.
Most athletes have jobs as
either hashers or workers in the
corporation yard. They work for
$2.50 an hour, and the hashers are
paid by the food service for two
out of their three quarters. Since
athletes travel often during the
quarter their sport falls in, the
athletic department subsidizes
their salary for this one quarter.
Still, with the financial
problems Stanford may run into,
most people in the athletic
department do not forsee
Stanford falling downward rapidly
in athletics. As Kmetovic pointed
out, the other schools are also
having problems. Both Kmetovic
and other people agree, though,
that changes may be needed in the
entire recruitinc svstem to
