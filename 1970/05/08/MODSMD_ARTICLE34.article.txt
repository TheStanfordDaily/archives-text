provide financial aid to worthy
student-athletes who quality
academically for admission to
Stanford. Contributions for this
purpose are received by the
University and controlled by the
University Committee on
Financial Awards. Students who
receive such aid are required to
maintain satisfactory academic
standing or forfeit the assistance."
Last year the club raised over a
quarter of a million dollars which
was combined with about
$50,000 in endowed scholarships
to constitute all athletic aid. This
year the goal of the Buck Club is
$339,000. Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor attributes the
increased goal mainly to the
continuing tuition hikes. He says
that with the projected rises ol
tuition by 1974-75, "Unless we
strengthen our funding programs
we will have to cut back aid to
only 100 athletes, varsity and
frosh combined."
With around 160 athletes
currently receiving aid annually,
Stanford already ranks last in the
Pac-8 in number of scholarships
offered. But no school is able to
grant unlimited aid, according to
Manager of Operations and
Student Affairs, Pete Kmetovic.
Kmetovic says that other schools
can afford to offer more
scholarships since they have lower
tuition costs.
Cutbacks
Six out of the seven other Pac-8
schools are state institutions with
small tuitions and the seventh,

successful year in and year out is
not because of the aid they offer,
but because of their great athletic
reputations and their geographic
locations.
The Southern California area is
one of the biggest pools of
athletic talent in the nation and it
is only logical that a great number
of these athletes attend the local
schools, USC and UCLA in
