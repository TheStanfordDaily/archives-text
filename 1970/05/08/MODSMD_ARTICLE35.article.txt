particular. So even though they
do offer more aid than Stanford
does, the number of athletes they
have on their doorstep makes
their recruiting easier arid their
athletic program more successful.
In fact, unofficial figures from a
recent year show that the
northern schools in the
conference, which are overall the
least successful, offer more aid
than either USC or UCLA. But
according to Kmetovic, a couple
of the northern schools are
suffering from financial
difficulties because of their
overexpenditures on athletics.
New Ruling Hurts
As far as scholarship aid goes,
one thing that may hurt Stanford
is a recent Pac-8 ruling. Formerly

alleviate these problems. Things
such as a "need criterion" for
athletic aid has been suggested.
Other suggestions, such as a
ceiling on aid, have also been
raised, but no action on these
matters is forthcoming in the near
future.
For the immediate future,
Stanford will concentrate on
keeping their aid comparable to
other Pac-8 schools. According to
Taylor, the immediate goals
include: 1) increasing Buck Club
annual giving substantially; 2)
developing a two million dollar
athletic-student and endowment
program; and 3) fulfilling a master
plan building program. If these
goals are reached, Taylor sees a
continuing bright future for
Stanford athletics.
