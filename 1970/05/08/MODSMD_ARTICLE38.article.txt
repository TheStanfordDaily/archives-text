# Paul And Ego Do It Alone
## 
### 
arrow, Paul asks himself why he
did all the instruments himself.
The answer is simple and direct:
"I think I'm pretty good."Paul is
just warming up at this point in
the interview, as further examples
of this remarkable repartee
demonstrate:
Q: Will Paul and Linda become
a John and Yoko?
A: No, they will become Paul
and Linda.
Q: Did you miss the other
Beatles and George Martin? Was
there a moment, e.g., when you
thought: "Wish Ringo was here
for this break"?
A: No.
Q: Assuming this is a very big
hit album, will you do another?
A: Even if it isn't, -I will
continue to do what I want—when
I want to.
To hell with John, Yoko,
George, Ringo, and Allen Klein.
"I have a better time with my
family," Paul announces. But just
to show that there is nothing like
home and hearth when it comes
to mellowing a man, Paul
comments on his affection for
John: "I love John, and respect
what he does—it doesn't give ME
any pleasure" (Paul's emphasis).
Now there's a compliment if I
ever heard one.
To his everlasting credit,
though, John Lennon appears to
have accepted this comment in
the spirit in which it was made,
judging from John's recent
description of Paul's
well-publicized departure from
the Beatles: "You know, it's like
this, when we read all this shit in
the paper, Yoko and I were
laughing, because the cartoon is
this: four guys on a stage with a
spotlight on them; second picture,
three guys on stage breezing out
of the spotlight; third picture, one
guy standing there, shouting, 'I'm
leaving."
Should Ve Known Better
Obviously, the Beatles'personal
relationships are a bit strained. To
admit such feelings is one thing,
but to flog them in public is
another. Paul's motives including
the "information sheets" in the
album are somewhat obscure, to
say the least. Perhaps the writing
can best be interpreted as a sort of
personal declaration of
independence made in the heat of
the moment. At any rate, the
written material adds absolutely
nothing to the album except hard
feelings, and Allen Klein's
exclusion of the sheets, although
done in part to protect himself
from some unflattering assertions,
was also fortunate for Paul.
The music can stand quite well
on its own. It needs no apologies
or explanations. The question as
to whether or not it would benefit
from the participation of the
other three Beatles is more or less

moot. Paul claims that he
approached this album exactly "as
I would if I were playing with the
Beatles," but the music
contradicts him. First of all, there
are five instrumental on the
record. Instrumental, with the
exception of "Flying," have been
anathema to the Beatles, whose
consistently fine lyrics made an
instrumental a wasted
opportunity.
Second, the songs on
McCartney strive for simplicity.
The typically intricate McCartney
bass lines heard on albums such as
Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road are
conspicuously absent on the solo
album. Paul is content to overdub
several simple riffs in many of the
songs, giving a loose, relaxed
feeling to the music. The
technique is effective in general,
slightly monotonous (when
reinforced with a repeated
one-phrase lyric) in a song like
'That Would Be Something," and
definitely a departure from the
tightly structured format of
Beatle songs such as "Ticket to
R>de"and "Lady Madonna."One
reason for the emphasis on
simplicity must have been the fact
that Paul recorded much of the
album in his four-track home
studio, which had no V.U. meters,
no mixer, and, thank God, no
vocal echo chamber.
Score
As long as I've strained your
credulity this far, I'll make one
more rash statement: Paul
McCartney could write very
effective movie scores. This is
meant only partially as a
compliment. I devoutly hope he
doesn't, but it scares me when he
is willing to put five instrumentals
on a 14 cut album. By the way, to
give Paul his due, there's a great

line in "Junk" which should put
even Hal David on his mettle:
"Buy, buy, says the sign in the
shop window./ Why? Why? says
the junk in the yard."
"Man We Was Lonely" is a song
written in what I would call Paul's
"cute" style. Paul has been
developing this type of song for
several albums now, starting with
"When I'm 64" in Sgt. Pepper.
"Your Mother Should Know"and
"Rocky Raccoon" followed in
succession, and then Paul
entered the rococo phase of his
"cute" style with "Maxwell's
Silver Hammer." Every time I
listen to Paul and Linda duetting
in "Man We Was Lonely," with its
theme of "at last we've found us"
and its Frank Yakovitch polka
bass line, I get an awful vision of
the vaudeville team of McCartney
and McCartney doing their act,

complete with softshoe break and
a touch of theatrical hillbilly
twang for the closing vocal lines.
I've been saving the best song
until last. "Maybe I'm Amazed" is
an incredibly good song. It is
beautifully arranged, with some
strong piano and the best lead
guitar work on the album. Paul's
voice is hard, soft, and very, very
alive. The lyrics are equal to the
power of the music: "Baby, I'm
amazed at the way you're with me
all the time,/ Maybe I'm afraid of
the way I leave you./ Baby, I'm
amazed at the way you help me
sing my song, right me when I'm
wrong,/ Baby, I'm amazed at the
way I really need you."
This is a really great McCartney
song. It makes the album
worthwhile all by itself. However,
McCartney is definitely not a
one-song album. It's a good album
on the whole, and it grows on you
with repeated listening. Because
the album is intended to be, and
succeeds in being, relaxed, even
the instrumentals are surprisingly
appropriate. Paul McCartney once
again proves himself to be a very
competent musician, and his voice
is truly unique.
The quality of the album makes
the written comments which Paul
wished to include all the more
regrettable. Paul had better look
to the competition, now that he is
the first Beatle to make a solo
album. George Harrison starts
recording on May 20th, John has
written all the material for his
own album, and Ringo Starr's first
album, Sentimental Journey, is
even now in the record racks.
And don't pass up Paul's album
just because of a few unfortunate
comments he chose to make.
There are indications that Paul is
trying to improve. As the last
question in his self-interview, Paul
asks what his plans are now and
replies, "My plan is to grow up."
