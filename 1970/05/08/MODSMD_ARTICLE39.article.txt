# A 						Magical ‘Flute’
## 
### STEVE MOE 
At a time when the inspirational is in short supply, the Stanford
Opera Workshop's production of Mozart's The Magic Flute provided it
in abundance last weekend. The Workshop has scheduled a special
extra performance this Sunday, May 10 at 7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium with all proceeds to benefit the Stanford delegation's trip
to Washington to protest Cambodia policy.
In the past several years the Opera Workshop has mounted
increasingly ambitious productions—Gianni Schicchi, Falstai'f, and
Cosi fan tutte to name three—with great success. Their current
offering more than justifies this ambitiousness. The Magic Flute,
Mozart's last opera, written in 1791, presents tremendous problems
both in staging and casting, even for major professional companies.
This production, staged by John Olon-Scrymgeour, succeeds
admirably on both counts.
As the program notes, this is a "non-illusionary Flute." The sets are
minimal, and the entire cast, with a few important exceptions, is on
stage throughout the opera. This is not simply a concert version,
though; the opera is acted, and acted quite well. In keeping with the
moralistic and universalistic tone of the story, the cast wears simple
black and white non-period costumes. The English translation by W.H.
Auden and Chester Kallman is clear and often witty, and the generally
clear diction of the singers projects it well.
Musical Masterpiece
But as in the case of any Mozart opera, and particularly The Magic
Flute, the music is the prime element. The story of the opera, is
notoriously complicated and confused; but Mozart's music, with a
simplicity which is beyond complexity, lends the whole opera a
sublimity which is difficult to convey in words. The highest
compliment I can pay this performance is that it did justice to this
masterpiece.
The Stanford Chamber Orchestra, led by Sandor Salgo, played well,
producing a crisp overture and seeming to tire, understandably, only
near the end of the opera. Salgo clearly had everything under control,
and his pacing was admirable. Above all, the singing was an almost
unmitigated joy.
The major roles are all taxing ones even for the most experienced
singers. Don Andrews' Tamino was beautifully sung; the role suits his
smooth lyric tenor voice perfectly. Susan Conant who sang Pamina on
Sunday night (Rosemary Morrison sang the role Saturday) projected
her beautiful voice and her really touching characterization
effectively. Her second act aria was one of the high points of the
evening.
But the dominating force in this Magi '•"'ute was Marc Clemens'
Papageno. The jolly birdcatcher is suppaiv., to steal the show, but
Clemens did it with an elegance and with that enhanced the total
effect of the opera. He unfolded a witty, thoroughly human
characterization, and his beautiful voice only made one wish that
Mozart had given his favorite character even more than the three arias
he did. '
Performances of The Magic Flute don't happen every day,
especially not like this one. Don't miss the benefit performance this
Sunday.

Sunday.
At a time when the inspirational is in short supply, the Stanford
Opera Workshop's production of Mozart's The Magic Flute provided it
in abundance last weekend. The Workshop has scheduled a special
extra performance this Sunday, May 10 at 7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium with all proceeds to benefit the Stanford delegation's trip
to Washington to protest Cambodia policy.
In the past several years the Opera Workshop has mounted
increasingly ambitious productions—Gianni Schicchi, Falstai'f, and
Cosi fan tutte to name three—with great success. Their current
offering more than justifies this ambitiousness. The Magic Flute,
Mozart's last opera, written in 1791, presents tremendous problems
both in staging and casting, even for major professional companies.
This production, staged by John Olon-Scrymgeour, succeeds
admirably on both counts.
As the program notes, this is a "non-illusionary Flute." The sets are
minimal, and the entire cast, with a few important exceptions, is on
stage throughout the opera. This is not simply a concert version,
though; the opera is acted, and acted quite well. In keeping with the
moralistic and universalistic tone of the story, the cast wears simple
black and white non-period costumes. The English translation by W.H.
Auden and Chester Kallman is clear and often witty, and the generally
clear diction of the singers projects it well.
Musical Masterpiece
But as in the case of any Mozart opera, and particularly The Magic
Flute, the music is the prime element. The story of the opera, is
notoriously complicated and confused; but Mozart's music, with a
simplicity which is beyond complexity, lends the whole opera a
sublimity which is difficult to convey in words. The highest
compliment I can pay this performance is that it did justice to this
masterpiece.
The Stanford Chamber Orchestra, led by Sandor Salgo, played well,
producing a crisp overture and seeming to tire, understandably, only
near the end of the opera. Salgo clearly had everything under control,
and his pacing was admirable. Above all, the singing was an almost
unmitigated joy.
The major roles are all taxing ones even for the most experienced
singers. Don Andrews' Tamino was beautifully sung; the role suits his
smooth lyric tenor voice perfectly. Susan Conant who sang Pamina on
Sunday night (Rosemary Morrison sang the role Saturday) projected
her beautiful voice and her really touching characterization
effectively. Her second act aria was one of the high points of the
evening.
But the dominating force in this Magi '•"'ute was Marc Clemens'
Papageno. The jolly birdcatcher is suppaiv., to steal the show, but
Clemens did it with an elegance and with that enhanced the total
effect of the opera. He unfolded a witty, thoroughly human
characterization, and his beautiful voice only made one wish that
Mozart had given his favorite character even more than the three arias
he did. '
Performances of The Magic Flute don't happen every day,
especially not like this one. Don't miss the benefit performance this
Sunday.
