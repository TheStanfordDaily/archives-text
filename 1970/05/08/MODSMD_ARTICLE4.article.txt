## 
### TOM GIVEN 
The national student strike
enters its fifth day today, with
almost 1 0 percent of the nation's
universities and colleges officially
closed, and even more schools
facing strikes of varying
effectiveness.
National strike information
headquarters at Brandeis
University said last night that 366
schools were striking, of which
114 have been officially closed.
Of these, 69 were closed for
periods of 2 to 7 days.
A similar survey conducted by
the National Education
Association in Washington, D.C.
reported 136 colleges and
universities officially shut down/
A count by the Associated
Press says that 224 schools have
closed, with others hit by strikes.
Cal Schools Quiet
By far the largest single group
of these were the California state
schools closed yesterday by
Governor Reagan. The nine
university and 18 state college
branches were joined in the
shutdown by 29 junior colleges
across the state. Another 25
junior colleges were operating on
skeleton crews.
Using the slogan, "on strike,
open it up," the Associated
Students of the University of
California at Berkeley were
organizing for a quarter-long
strike yesterday.
Most of the departments and
schools of the campus held

meetings, despite Governor
Reagan's plea that students go
home for the four-day weekend.
A number of departments in the
Letters and Sciences School, as
well as other schools in the
university, have voted to strike
until June.
Mobilizing
The emphasis at Berkeley is
now directed towards moving into
various communities to mobilize
anti-war sentiment.
The UCLA campus was quiet
last night, as Los Angeles police
continued to ring the Westwood
school. About 1,000 students met
yesterday in the only building
open on campus, the student
union, to discuss plans for future
action.
The student newspaper, The
Daily Bruin, was closed as
advertisers withdrew ads for the
Friday issue.
A UCLA professor was injured
in a hit-and-run accident on the
campus yesterday morning. A
university spokesman said he
identified one of the car's
passengers as a student of his,
Harry Kosac. Kosac was identified
by the spokesman as an
undercover policeman posing as a
student on the campus.
Most of the state college
campuses were deserted, as an
attempted sleep-in of Cal State
Long Beach students was broken
up by police
Sporadic Violence
Despite the nonviolent tenor of

the strike nationwide, violence
flared on a number of campuses
yesterday.
On the East Coast, a three
alarm blaze heavily damaged a
student building at Fordham
University. Militants at New York
University who had been holding
a computer for ransom failed in
destroying it as student marshalls
put out a firebomb.
A three alarm blaze at Harvard
caused undetermined damage to a
campus building.
Students at Albany State
blocked the New York State
thruway late Wednesday night,
and yesterday morning Queens
College students blocked the Long
Island Expressway for a short
period.
Boston University, officially
closed at 5 p.m. yesterday,
became a "community college" as
faculty members stayed with
students in university dorms.
Strikes at Northeastern and
Massachusetts Universities were
met by police on the campus.
Police used tear gas to disperse a
rally of 2,000 students at
American University in the
nation's capital.
Midwest Fire
Violence was also sporadic in
the Midwest. Students burned the
ROTC building at Case-Western
Reserve, and a sit-in at the
University of Missouri was
dispersed with tear gas. The
National Guard remains on duty
at the University of Kentucky and

the University of Illinois. Both
campuses remained calm.
Conference Cancelled
Repercussions of the strike
have been felt across the nation.
In Santa Fe, the spring national
Republican Governors'
Conference was cancelled.
Conference chairman
Raymond P. Shafer of
Pennsylvania said the move was
due to conditions across the
country. Only 12 governors came
to the New Mexico capital for the
meeting.
Students at the National
University in Mexico City had
planned to demonstrate at the
affair.
