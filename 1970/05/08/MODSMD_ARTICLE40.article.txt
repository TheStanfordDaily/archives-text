# Stanford’s Political Art
## 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
In a meeting this week the
Stanford Art Department joined
he long history of revolutionary
irtists by deciding it could make
ts best contribution to the
mti-war movement by leaving its
'{•"ilities open, and encouraging,
ather than stopping, the work of
ts individual artists.
The normal teaching schedule
las been suspended to allow
.tudents, faculty and staff to
.•hannel their energies more
lirectly into anti-war related
). >jects.
Specific projects have taken
nany forms so far, and others are
n the planning stages. Students
ire painting posters for White
Plaza, Meyer Library—to explain its
special services of the week,
jrganizing to paint all the
y istruction boards and boards
over windows on campus,
planning a special sale of student
irt work to profit the Washington
Delegation, and designing specific
inti-war cards and posters to be
iold directly and distributed in
the community. An arm band
j. k-screening project is also being
planned.
All these projects support the
"open up and do something
positive" policy rather than the
"shut it down" theory. Respect
for the power and integrity of the
individual is evident.
"As artists we are
revolutionaries anyway, why stop
our work now? By the very act of
painting we are defying society,"
stated an undergraduate in
painting, reflecting the views of
most of her fellow students.
Prof. Kahn, Stanford designer
n w in Italy, worked for the

Moratorium this fall by designing
the posters, cards, buttons and
bumper stickers that were sold.
Kahn explained that he could best
express his political consciousness
through art. His statement at that
time reflects the present mood of
the art department: "As a
designer I have methods that are
applicable ... I feel that this is
the best way that I can contribute
to the anti-war movement."
Speaking of individuals he said,
" . . . each should respond to the
need as best he can."
Protest Tradition
The tradition reaches as" far
back in the graphic media as the
15th century. Above, an engraved
alphabet manuscript page of 1467
ironically illustrates (as described
in The Indigant Kye, Beacon
Press, 1969) "two heavily
armored knights slashing at one
another while two unfortunate
peasants are trampled beneath
their horses. The knights are
completely indifferent to the fate
of these two literally
downtrodden people."
Hieronymous Bosch (c.
1450-1516) became a profound
critic of time through his satirical
engravings commenting on and
ridiculing society. He often
focused on the "ship of fools"
theme of mankind, as have many
artists since his time.
The graphic media, particularly
the poster, have been used
extensively in this century for
social protest. Contemporary
giv.phic artists Leonard Baskin and
Ben Shahn make strong emotional
appeals possible beyond the
photograph. Shahn's Hiroshima
and McCarthy poster illustrating a
dove are familiar to the American

public.
He has commented "... I
think by his nature the artist is
sensitive to time and place . . . the
natural reaction of the artist will
be strongly toward bringing man
back into focus as the center of
importance."
Stanford Opinions
Prof. Olivera of the Stanford
Art Department stated: "The
artist's voice is a powerful voice
when it takes the form of an
artistic statement, and there is no
better time for him to make that
statement than right now." He
continued, "The nature of artists'
work is a protest. By his nature he
is a revolutionary. He is in the
minority—there isn't a place for
him in society."
Prof. Johnson, another studio
professor of the Art Department
spoke of his feelings when asked
what an artist does in political
crisis. "... he perhaps becomes
more self-protective in crisis to
preserve his own sanity, in order
to be able to re-evaluate the
happenings, to order them
someway into visual tools." He
discussed the universal appeal of
great art sighting Breugal, Goya,
and Grosz as artists "in the past
who have left visual statements
about disasters of their time."
Johnson spoke of the more
powerful statements that come
from the artists' feelings being
distilled for a long time. He spoke
of the artists' work as "an attempt
to find out why this cruelty still
exists."
For the artist "the important
thing is what is left over" in his
heart, the sense of tradegy,
helplessness, the artist must deal
with. We are living a series of

scars ... it takes awhile for each
to show up in the media." He
continued, "It is important for
the artist not to become stoic in
these situations ... he must
attempt to maintain sanity in a
surreal situation."
Talking of specific positive
action each individual can take,
one art professor commented,
" it is hard to find something

you can put your hand to . . ."
but we all must—now.
