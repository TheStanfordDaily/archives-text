# Films In Preview
## Films To Help Strikefund 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Wednesday and Thursday
evening, all film series were
cancelled, but as yet plans have
not been made to prevent the
scheduled weekend films from
being shown. Associate Provost
Robert Rosenzweig said the
Provost's office had requested
that groups cancel mass meetings
at night, maintaining that the
request was primarily aimed at
Discouraging people not from
Stanford from coming on campus
and being caught as "innocent
bystanders" in night violence.
Rosenzweig explained, "We can't
prevent people from meeting, and
we don't want to. What we want
do is encourage people not to
have large meetings at night."
Benefit Series
However, the Communications
Department will sponsor a
showing of student films tonight
in Cubberley at 7 and 9 with
Proceeds going to the Legal
befense Fund, Stanford's
delegation to Washington, and the
special strike projects of the
Department of Communication,
which include a student produced
TV show and newsreel. The films
are mostly recent efforts by
Stanford students, but in
addition, several shorts by James
Broughton* poet and a leader in
West Coast underground
filmmaking for twenty years, will
be featured.
Student films in the program
include Brian Kahin's "Barbara
L iby," a thirty minute offering in
that most fantastic of genres, the
college musical. Original songs

include "Until Love Comes Along
(Lust Will Have to Do)." In
addition to this self-aware musical
shot last year while Kahin was an
undergraduate at Harvard, two of
his most recent films will be
shown.
"Great Themes of the Western
World" (IV2 minutes) is an
economical statement starring
glamourous Sigourney Weaver of
Stanford. "The Afternoon," a
film concerning four personalities
caught in a vicious circle, is
hard-hitting and features the local
talents of Steve Rosenfield, Sheila
Mahoney, Gail Hoffman, and Paul
Willis.
"Reckoning," Stanford senior
Leslie Hill's much-praised first
effort, is a dramatization of a
poem by Will Hobbs, a graduate
student in English who also
appears in the film. It concerns a
man with today's consciousness
trying to cope with life in the
wilderness. Other student films on
the program were not yet definite
as of this writing.
Strike Films
Because it takes several weeks
for a film to be put together after
it is shot, it will be the end of the
quarter before the numerous
strike films now in production
will be completed. Meanwhile, I
suggest you attend the benefit
program tonight because it
promises to be entertaining and
besides, the $1 admission is
probably tax deductible. (Try to
explain that one on your tax
form.)
If you still feel that you haven't
done enough for the strike, the
Celluloid Syndicate will take your

money and donate it to Legal
Defense. Hopefully, they will be
showing "Casanova 70" with
Marcello Mastroianni and Virni
Lisi, Saturday at 7, 9 and 11 in
Cubberley.
Marcello plays a man who can
only make love when his life is in
danger. Miss Lisi provides tension
relief.
The Tresidder Saturday Film
Series has scheduled "Nazarin" by
Luis Bunuel at 7, 8 and 9 in
Tresidder. Nazarin is a character
brutally treated at the hands of an
unjust society (?) that fails to be
moved bv his unexpected
and unwanted example of pure
Christian love.
The Sunday flicks plans to
show "Last Summer" at 7:30 in

Memorial Auditorium. Four
affluent teen-agers spending the
summer smoking dope,
experimenting with sex and
playing other assorted games at a
beach house on Long Island form
the basis for this fine film. The
end is strange but worth waiting
for.
Again, all films might possibly
be cancelled if violence resumes
on campus, but as of yesterday at
6:00 p.m., films listed in the
column will be shown as planned.
