# Lear Opens Tonight
## 
### 
The Company opens its
production of Shakespeare's
"King Lear," with a preview
showing tonight in the Branner
Dining Hall. The show will be
running in Branner until May 23
at Branner, and admission is free
to all members of the Stanford
community.
"Lear" represents the
culmination of the Company's
drama experience at Stanford,
according to the show's director,
Mark Griffiths. The group is
composed of Stanford
undergraduates, and is the
off-shoot of a drama group
formed in the freshman year of
the group members who are now
seniors.
"We've always wanted to do
Shakespeare, and we're not trying
o hype the play up. We started
jff with the idea of a workshop
out in the hills, but we've learned
a lot from working with the play
as a reality."
The idea of a workshop has
been retained, however. The play
has been in rehearsal since
February, with cast member"
working with video tapes to
improve technique and frequent
meetings to discuss the
interpretation of the play. The
educational process will continue
throughout the performances,
with adjustments made as ideas
and feelings change.
Larry Friedlander of the
English Department, who plays
the Fool, is the only
non-undergraduate in the cast. He
feels that the selection of
Shakespeare's complex and
often-produced classic was a wise
one.
"We deliberately chose the
most difficult play because that's
the best way to learn about the
theater—to take the biggest risk
possible. And it's worth it,
because if you fail, you at leas'
fail in interesting ways."
