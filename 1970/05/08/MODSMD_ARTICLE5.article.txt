## Rise In Jobless Rate 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Labor Department will report
today the sharpest rise in the
nation's unemployment in 10
years, up from 4.4 to 4.8 percent
of the civilian labor force in April,
informed sources said Thursday.
The steep rise of some 300,000
more unemployed workers last
month pushed the nation's jobless
total to around 4 million, highest
level in five years, the sources
said.
The report came amid warnings
from organized labor that
President Nixon's economic
policies designed to curb inflation
threaten the nation with an
economic recession without
slowing the price rise.
The reported April jump of
four-tenths of one percent in the
unemployment rate was the
largest since the 1960 economic
recession.
The April figure of 4.8 percent
was confirmed by numerous high
level Washington sources, as the
Nixon administration tipped off
key figures to brace themselves
for further bad economic news.
The stringent White House

economic policies of tight money,
high interest and federal spending
cuts have been designed to curb
the nation's worst inflation in 20
years but have only barely slowed
the annual rise of more than 6
percent.
The administration has slightly
eased some of the policies,
contending the price rise will soon
slow to a more moderate rise.
Tricia Miffed
WASHINGTON (AP) - Two
anti-war demonstration leaders
from Finch College had an
hour-long meeting at the White
House Thursday with Finch
alumnus Tricia Nixon and
reported she "seemed shocked"
when told millions of American
students don't trust their
government.
The two girls, like other college
students delegations who have
visited the White House in recent
days, said the talk was about
student unrest. One reported: '*1
think it can be said we disagreed."
Miss Ann Holmes, president of
the Finch student body, said
"She, Tricia, suggested we write

to congressmen and senators and
tell them how we felt. We told her
we've been doing that for five
years." And one senator wrote
back "thank you for your
attitude" after being written a
scathing letter.
Tricia further suggested,
according to Miss Holmes, that
there was "a personality gap"
rather than a generation gap and
suggested that "any student in the
United States who has any idea of
how to bridge the gap between
students and the administration
should write those ideas to the
White House."
