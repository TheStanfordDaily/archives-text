# Meetings Set Today
## Strike Momentum Maintained 
### 
Students and faculty remained
on strike yesterday as the
University was effectively shut
down for the fifth consecutive
day.
Few major activities are
planned today, as the University
will operate on a Saturday
schedule. However, a 9 a.m.
meeting for students and faculty
is slated for Frost Amphitheater,
and a noon rally on White Plaza is
planned to allow students to sign
complicity statements and turn in
their draft cards.
Yesterday's shutdown did not
differ much from that of previous
days. The main differences were
additional picketing near partially
closed science buildings and a
lessening of it at Encina.
The Medical School, which is
helping to organize a nationwide
labor strike, said it had received
some support from the Teamsters
and the Longshoremens unions. It
distributed 15,000 leaflets at local
industrial plants yesterday
morning,
Shortly before noon, about 175
members of the Stanford Workers
Against the War, a newly-formed
ad hoc group, met with President
Pitzer. The workers demanded
that, as members of the Stanford
community, they be given time
off to participate in strike-related
activities, and that the workers
not lose part of their salaries if
they were "involuntarily" kept
off their jobs.

Pitzer replied that employees
could take off between one and
two hours a day for political
activities and that they will not be
penalized if they are prevented
from working by striking
students.
Fewer students than
Wednesday were reported on the
picket lines. However, Encina and
the ROTC building continued to
be effectively blocked, as the
strikers, permitted only
accounting, minority
employment, and credit union
employees to pass through the
lines.
Brief scuffling broke out as
students tried to prevent Hanson
Laboratory employees from
entering the building. One of the

strikers, a pregnant woman, was
reportedly struck several times by
employees seeking to enter the
building. The strike near the
building dissipated as the day
progressed.
At the Business School,
someone opened a telephone line
to the White House. For about
half an hour, individual students
reported their feelings on
President Nixon's Cambodian
policies to an unidentified person
on the other end of the circuit.
Later in the day, about 400
people gathered in White Plaza to
listen to the faculty Senate
meeting over a public address
system.
A communications poll released

yesterday indicated that more
than 75 percent of Stanford
students favor the current strike
on this campus, according to a
recent telephone survey
conducted by the Institute for
Communication Research. [See

The Committee of Violence of
the Psychiatry Department
announced last night that it had
succeeded in setting up a rumor
verification center at 329-0220,
for people to check out rumors
they have heard. The center will
start operating at 8 a.m. this
morning and be manned 24 hours
a day by volunteers.
The Indo-China Workshop has
been postponed to 2:30 p.m.
today.
