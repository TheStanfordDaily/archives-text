# Third World Delegates Voice Discontent With Washington
## 
### 
Four Third World members of
the Stanford delegation to
Washington returned to San
Francisco six hours early
yesterday to express their
dissatisfaction and disgust with
the mission.
Spokesman Carlos Vasquez
from MECHA, and Neal
Okaboyashi of the
Asian- American Students
Alliance, voiced the frustration
felt by black, Chicano, and
Oriental students in dealing with
government leaders. Vasquez
stated at a press conference that,
"the last place one goes to change
things is Washington."
They condemned the white
members of the delegation for
devoting too much time to
speaking with those who were

already sympathetic to student
grievance. Okaboyashi belittled
the whites' concern for curing
campus unrest, saying, "we're not
interested in saving the great
universities. We're concerned with
saving Third World people."
Henry Kissinger was attacked
by both men for merely justifying
U.S. Asian policy and not
listening to the students.
Okaboyashi noted that there had
been little dialogue with Kissinger,
just a monologue by the
Presidential Assistant. They
compared him to Dr. Strangelove,
and a "mechanized robot that
makes foreign policy for the
United States."
They did emphasize that men
like Ted Kennedy, Alan Cranston,
and Robert Finch were

sympathetic to student and
minority causes. However, few
concrete proposals were agreed
upon in any conferences with
these men.
They stated that racism is a
fundamental cause for the war in
Southeast Asia. Vasquez noted
that Radio Free Europe is used to
fight communism in the Western
World, while napalm is used in the
Far East. Extending this racism
analysis, he went on to say that if
minority delegates had tried to see
anyone in Washington without
joining the whites they could
never have spoken to anyone.
Okaboyashi expressed his
delight at leaving the capital,
indicating that tension and
confusion have gripped that city
as a result of foreign and domestic
crises.
