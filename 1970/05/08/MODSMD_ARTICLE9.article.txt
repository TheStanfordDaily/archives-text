# Military Scapegoat
## Defense Research Evil? 
### Prof. Alan Waterman 
As the cry "Off DOD research" grows louder,
hose who are seriously concerned about this
university would do well to decide whether they
,/ish merely to follow a slogan which provides
hem with a scapegoat, or whether they truly wish
) make a constructive change for the better. How
luch of our feeling is governed by our associating
the Department of "Defense" with the horrors of
/ar, and how much is based on a knowledge of
vhat research it does support and how the results
ire used?
We hear arguments that the Mansfield
mendment insures that all DOD research must
iave a potential military application. The twofold
ict is that many things not supported by DOD, or
ven by a government agency, have potential
military use, and that most basic research,
egardless of how supported, has potential
pplication outside the military sphere. Any
Indies of the meteorological conditions affecting
■ir pollution have a possible use in chemical
warfare; conversely techniques of large-scale
information processing and communications are of
utmost importance not only to the military but to
our grossly overcrowded urban communities. We
should distinguish carefully between objecting to
undesirably military applications, and stifling the
research itself or its source of support.
No Hasty Decisions
Let us not be stampeded into hasty decisions
before each of us, in forming our opinion, has
some factual understanding on which to base his
opinion. If we are to cease all DOD supported
work, let us be convinced that five Departments in
the Medical School are acting immorally in using
three hundred thousand dollars worth of support
for such investigations as the effect of carbon
monoxide on human behavior, molecular
mechanisms of allergy, and improved methods for
treating patients rescued from drowning; that
seven Engineering Departments would help
humanity more without six million dollars of
support to study the generation of water waves by
wind, to explore radio emissions from
extra-galactic sources, or to develop an electronic
reading aid for the blind; or that nine Departments
in the School of Humanities and Sciences would
be better off without two million dollars for
research in such areas as a gyro test of Einstein's
general theory of relativity, distribution of socially
significant rewards, and statistical analyses of time
series with application to economics, medicine and
geophysics.

It is also important to consider whether
research funds, or any educationally used funds,
can be contaminated by their source. If that is the
case, many of the gift funds supporting professors'
salaries and students' scholarships should be
scrutinized, Nobel laureates should return their
munitions—derived prize money, and Rhodes
scholars should refuse the support which stems
from British imperialism in Africa's diamond
mines.
In point of fact, the money used for
government support of research is money which
comes from the people, collected in the form of
taxes. At no point does it "belong to" the Defense
Department, or whatever agency it is channelled
through.What is important is that the agency
through which the money passes should not overly
restrict the research itself, nor control or conceal
the output, so that the long-range benefits will
accrue to the people.
Purrified Soul
It is admittedly very tempting for a university
to wish to wash its hands of the military, and
thereby hope that it has purified its soul. However,
a university should be judged, and should judge
itself, by its acts, not by its associations. Progress
in the free search for new truths and in the
dissemination and teaching of these truths is the
university's proper role. The mechanisms for
financing this role are a secondary consideration.
While we are searching for alternate and improved
financing mechanisms it is better to keep the role
operating, in spite of imperfections in these
mechanisms, than to cripple university research
merely because its source of funds keeps bad
company.
It would be a strange irony indeed if we in our
academic environment turned out to be less
far-sighted than the military services themselves
were twenty years ago when they set up the Office
of Naval Research (later followed by the Air Force
Office of Scientific Research and the Army
Research Office) as agencies to support long-range
basic studies without regard to specific
application.
Their philosophy was that the establishment of
a solid base for research would provide a
foundation on which many applications could
build, including their own. Let us not be so
myoptic as to think only in terms of applications.'
We are the ones who should be defending the
search for new fundamental truths.

reading aid for the blind; or that nine Departments
in the School of Humanities and Sciences would
be better off without two million dollars for
research in such areas as a gyro test of Einstein's
general theory of relativity, distribution of socially
significant rewards, and statistical analyses of time
series with application to economics, medicine and
geophysics.

It is also important to consider whether
research funds, or any educationally used funds,
can be contaminated by their source. If that is the
case, many of the gift funds supporting professors'
salaries and students' scholarships should be
scrutinized, Nobel laureates should return their
munitions—derived prize money, and Rhodes
scholars should refuse the support which stems
from British imperialism in Africa's diamond
mines.
In point of fact, the money used for
government support of research is money which
comes from the people, collected in the form of
taxes. At no point does it "belong to" the Defense
Department, or whatever agency it is channelled
through.What is important is that the agency
through which the money passes should not overly
restrict the research itself, nor control or conceal
the output, so that the long-range benefits will
accrue to the people.
Purrified Soul
It is admittedly very tempting for a university
to wish to wash its hands of the military, and
thereby hope that it has purified its soul. However,
a university should be judged, and should judge
itself, by its acts, not by its associations. Progress
in the free search for new truths and in the
dissemination and teaching of these truths is the
university's proper role. The mechanisms for
financing this role are a secondary consideration.
While we are searching for alternate and improved
financing mechanisms it is better to keep the role
operating, in spite of imperfections in these
mechanisms, than to cripple university research
merely because its source of funds keeps bad
company.
It would be a strange irony indeed if we in our
academic environment turned out to be less
far-sighted than the military services themselves
were twenty years ago when they set up the Office
of Naval Research (later followed by the Air Force
Office of Scientific Research and the Army
Research Office) as agencies to support long-range
basic studies without regard to specific
application.
Their philosophy was that the establishment of
a solid base for research would provide a
foundation on which many applications could
build, including their own. Let us not be so
myoptic as to think only in terms of applications.'
We are the ones who should be defending the
search for new fundamental truths.
(Alan T. Waterman, Jr., is a professor of
electrical engineering.)
As the cry "Off DOD research" grows louder,
hose who are seriously concerned about this
university would do well to decide whether they
,/ish merely to follow a slogan which provides
hem with a scapegoat, or whether they truly wish
) make a constructive change for the better. How
luch of our feeling is governed by our associating
the Department of "Defense" with the horrors of
/ar, and how much is based on a knowledge of
vhat research it does support and how the results
ire used?
We hear arguments that the Mansfield
mendment insures that all DOD research must
iave a potential military application. The twofold
ict is that many things not supported by DOD, or
ven by a government agency, have potential
military use, and that most basic research,
egardless of how supported, has potential
pplication outside the military sphere. Any
Indies of the meteorological conditions affecting
■ir pollution have a possible use in chemical
warfare; conversely techniques of large-scale
information processing and communications are of
utmost importance not only to the military but to
our grossly overcrowded urban communities. We
should distinguish carefully between objecting to
undesirably military applications, and stifling the
research itself or its source of support.
No Hasty Decisions
Let us not be stampeded into hasty decisions
before each of us, in forming our opinion, has
some factual understanding on which to base his
opinion. If we are to cease all DOD supported
work, let us be convinced that five Departments in
the Medical School are acting immorally in using
three hundred thousand dollars worth of support
for such investigations as the effect of carbon
monoxide on human behavior, molecular
mechanisms of allergy, and improved methods for
treating patients rescued from drowning; that
seven Engineering Departments would help
humanity more without six million dollars of
support to study the generation of water waves by
wind, to explore radio emissions from
extra-galactic sources, or to develop an electronic
reading aid for the blind; or that nine Departments
in the School of Humanities and Sciences would
be better off without two million dollars for
research in such areas as a gyro test of Einstein's
general theory of relativity, distribution of socially
significant rewards, and statistical analyses of time
series with application to economics, medicine and
geophysics.
