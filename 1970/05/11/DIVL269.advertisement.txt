HELP GEORGE BROWN!
WOULD YOU BELIEVE REPRESENTATIVE GEORGE BROWN HAS BEEN AGAINST THE
WAR SINCE 1964 AND HASN'T VOTED A DOLLAR FOR IT SINCE 1965?
The politics of conscience must be shown to be practical and its proponents elect
able. A Geo. Brown victory therefore is essential. If Geo. Brown can get his mes
sage to enough California voters he can be elected to the Senate. But without the
millions of $$$ needed to wage a mass media campaign he must rely on volunteers.
To win he needs the same massive student effort that worked so effectively in the
Kennedy-McCarthy campaigns. Good intentions won't elect George Brown—Hard
work will.
We can have a new senator if slogans are converted into effective political action.
IF YOU WANT TO HELP, CALL OR STOP BY:
216 No. First St., San Jose — 289-8280
2024 Manhattan Ave., East Palo Alto — 323-1351
For canvassing call Sarah Doniach — 325-1 217
