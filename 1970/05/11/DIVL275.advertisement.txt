We need immediate contributions and signatures of Stanford parents and friends for a
FULL-PAGE ad in the L.A. TIMES and the S.F. CHRONICLE. The ad would read:
WHO IS PRESIDENT NIXON CALLING "CAMPUS BUMS?"
They are our children, yours and mine. Students all over the country are
protesting the war. They are not being heard. A handful have been
driven to desperate acts. The vast majority are against violence—on
campus and in the world. Calling them names does not hp'-*
tion—it serves the nation poorly and intensifies the crisis. Their dissent,
and ours, must be heard.
Write or wire President Nixon urging him to STOP DIVIDING THE NATION
AND STOP THE WAR BY ENDING IT, NOT EXPANDING IT.
Sponsored by the undersigned parents and friends
of Stanford University Students:
