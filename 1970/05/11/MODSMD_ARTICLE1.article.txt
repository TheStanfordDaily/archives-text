# Will Colleges Stay Closed?
## 
### 
The national academic strike
entered its second week today
amidst confusion on many
campuses.
While a large number of Eastern
schools have closed for the
; mester, in the Midwest and on
the West Coast, groups seeking to
either prolong or end the strike
appeared uncertain of the future.
At stake are the academic
records of thousands of students,
and the research of hundreds of
professors.
The uncertainty over exams,
papers, strikes, and boycotts was
most acute in California. Students
at UC branches from San Diego to
Berkeley plan to strike tomorrow
in defiance of Governor Reagan's
pre-emptive closing of the state
schools.
Many of the private universities
were also preparing for long-run
strikes.
USC Coalition
At the University of Southern
California, a coalition of student,
faculty, and administrative groups
nroposed a plan to resume
academic work without penalizing
political activists.
The move, sanctioned by
University president Norman
Topping, allows student activists
one of three methods to put
academic affairs in order.
A student not attending classes
inay take a final grade based on
course work to date; receive an
incomplete as a final grade,
without charge for the make up
work; or by agreement of a
professor, substitute an
out-of-class project for course
requirements.
The program is an expansion of
similar guidelines suggested last
week by President Pitzer.
Berkeley Program
At UC Berkeley, Chancellor
Heyns has proposed a similar
program, though less explicit. He
aces stiff opposition from the
strike coordinating committee
which has demanded no regular
classes be scheduled for the rest of
the quarter; passing grades and
lull credit for all students; and
non-penalization of any university
employees.
A rally at noon today will vote
on these demands. Other strike
activities slated include
informational picketing, and a
march through the campus.
At UCLA, students are also
planning to extend the walkout.
The Ackerman Student Union
building has become a strike
headquarters, as students canvass
communities, prepare leaflets,
pring signs, and train medics.
Elsewhere, the University of
Wisconsin, all its branches, and
other Wisconsin State Universities
were closed for the rest of the
quarter.
Bayonets Used
In New Mexico, five persons
were stabbed by bayonet-wielding
National Guardsmen following a
sit-in at the University of New
Mexico administration building.

Among the wounded was as
Albuquerque television newsman.
Commander of the force, Brig.
Gen. D.L. Doane said his men had
carried the bayonets because it
was, "standard operating
procedure."
Right or wrong," he continued,
"that's the way the book is
written."
National Guardsmen were also
on alert in Vermont, as Students
rallied at the State capitol in
Montpelier. Earlier, Lt. Governor
Thomas I. Hayes had cancelled a
memorial service for the four
Kent State students, acting "in
the interest of public safety."
South Vietnam Schools
Schools were closed
indefinitely throughout South
Vietnam, following violent
confrontations between students
and police. A curfew was called
on Wednesday, and students
violating a ban on assemblies were
dispersed with tear gas on
Saturday.
Seventy-six of the students
were arrested.

Friday's rally at the Old Union. As students turned in their draft cards, she and
Ira Sandperl urged non-violence and said that buildings should not be blocked.
