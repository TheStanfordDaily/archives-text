# No Business As Usual
## Strikers Blast Lyman 'Distortions' 
### Steering Committee 
As the Stanford strike moves
into its second active week, the
strike community is faced with
several critical problems. These
problems stem mainly from the
administration's unwillingness to
deal substantively with the
demands of the strike. They have
chosen instead to raise financial
arguments which threaten to
forcibly undermine the valid
foundations of the strike by
imposing severe sanctions on both
student and working groups
within the Stanford community.
Sunday morning, eight
members of the Strike Steering
Committee met with three
university administrators to
discuss these issues. At that
meeting it was clear that the
administration is unwilling to
operate in anything but a
business-as-usual atmosphere.
Particularly disturbing is their
critically false assumption that
existing university financial
processes set absolute limits on
the options of both the strike and
the university. The
administration's failure to adopt
extraordinary new financial
arrangements at this time
constitutes a refusal to recognize
that both the university and the
nation itself are facing an extreme
crisis situation.
We have called upon the
university to disengage itself from
the Department of Defense, to
cease functioning as an arm of the
federal government and the
military, and to take up its
responsibility to serve as an
effective center for social
criticism. The administration has
countered by insisting that
business-as-usual is its top
priority, and by suggesting that
the university may be closed in
the wake of further protest. The
administration has yet to
demonstrate even the slightest
intention of working toward
satisfying the strike demands.
More importantly, it is making a
clear effort to drive a wedge
between students and workers on
this campus by asserting that the
strike, if continued, will force
layoffs or loss of pay for workers,
especially those who are paid
hourly wages. It is certain that
minority workers will be hit first
and hardest by this policy.
Provost Lyman suggested on
KZSU Sunday evening that while
most of the non-violent strike
community is acting on morally
sound though naive assumptions,
they are playing into the hands of

a "small, vocal group of radicals"
who are intent on shutting down
the university as a demonstration
of their revolutionary power. This
is an outright lie. The strike
community is united in its desire
to keep the university open while
redirecting its priorities.
The administration's intent is
clear: destroy the strike by
turning various strike groups
against each other. The workers of
this university will suffer most
from this tactic, while the
students will be made to feel
responsible for shutting the
university down and depriving the
workers of their right to work.
The strike community can no
longer afford to tolerate these
distortions and coercive policies
put forward by the
administration. Based on a large
amount of information gathered
from financial reports and
personal interviews, we make the
following observations:
1) We are told that the
university will be denied money
by the federal government for the
research time lost during the
strike, and that because some of
this money is used to pay salaries,
the administration argues that the
strike is depriving the university
of critical funds. But in reality the
government payments to the
university for grants and contracts
do not arrive after proof of work
done. Moneys arrive quarterly or
monthly, and the offices in
Encina that dispurse this money
to workers have been left open by
the strike. There is of course the
possibility of audit, either internal
or by the Defense Contract Audit
Agency, to see that the money is
not misspent. But we must
remember that the nine-day sit-in
at AEL last spring, followed by
Pitzer's week-long closure of that
lab, did not stop payments on its
contracts.
2) If the university has trouble
keeping its financial commitments
to minority workers or any other
employees or vendors, it could
temporarily use portions of the
$4.5 million in cash that it keeps
in the bank or portions of the $6
million of bonds the university
itself labels as working assets.
3) Another major form of
income which the strike will not
stop is corporate giving. Just as
with federal funds, this money
does not arrive in daily or weekly
installments.
4) In the past fiscal year,
Stanford also earned over $6.5

million from unrestricted general
division endowment funds. This
sum ma> be used for any purpose
the administration desires. Even
with the projected deficit for this
year there is about $4 million to
be reallocated if necessary.
Decisions to increase or decrease
the drawing of funds out of the
endowment investment pool or to
change the nature of the
investments are made by the
Trustees and their Investment
Committee. (No students are
permitted on this committee.)
The Trustees are meeting Monday
and Tuesday of this week and
could work to guarantee that
workers will be paid if they wish
to consider that problem.
So we now see how much
money is really being lost due to
the strike—very little—how much
money is available to alleviate the
crisis—a great deal—and who is
really responsible for penalizing
the workers—the administration
and Trustees. True, without DOD
funds, Stanford would cease to
function in its present manner.
But we can count on the
administration to cloud the issue
by charging that a "small, vocal
group of radicals" is responsible
for the university's financial crisis,
when in truth the crisis stems
entirely from the university's
dependence on the Pentagon.

We have called upon the
university to disengage itself from
the Department of Defense, to
cease functioning as an arm of the
federal government and the
military, and to take up its
responsibility to serve as an
effective center for social
criticism. The administration has
countered by insisting that
business-as-usual is its top
priority, and by suggesting that
the university may be closed in
the wake of further protest. The
administration has yet to
demonstrate even the slightest
intention of working toward
satisfying the strike demands.
More importantly, it is making a
clear effort to drive a wedge
between students and workers on
this campus by asserting that the
strike, if continued, will force
layoffs or loss of pay for workers,
especially those who are paid
hourly wages. It is certain that
minority workers will be hit first
and hardest by this policy.
Provost Lyman suggested on
KZSU Sunday evening that while
most of the non-violent strike
community is acting on morally
sound though naive assumptions,
they are playing into the hands of

a "small, vocal group of radicals"
who are intent on shutting down
the university as a demonstration
of their revolutionary power. This
is an outright lie. The strike
community is united in its desire
to keep the university open while
redirecting its priorities.
The administration's intent is
clear: destroy the strike by
turning various strike groups
against each other. The workers of
this university will suffer most
from this tactic, while the
students will be made to feel
responsible for shutting the
university down and depriving the
workers of their right to work.
The strike community can no
longer afford to tolerate these
distortions and coercive policies
put forward by the
administration. Based on a large
amount of information gathered
from financial reports and
personal interviews, we make the
following observations:
1) We are told that the
university will be denied money
by the federal government for the
research time lost during the
strike, and that because some of
this money is used to pay salaries,
the administration argues that the
strike is depriving the university
of critical funds. But in reality the
government payments to the
university for grants and contracts
do not arrive after proof of work
done. Moneys arrive quarterly or
monthly, and the offices in
Encina that dispurse this money
to workers have been left open by
the strike. There is of course the
possibility of audit, either internal
or by the Defense Contract Audit
Agency, to see that the money is
not misspent. But we must
remember that the nine-day sit-in
at AEL last spring, followed by
Pitzer's week-long closure of that
lab, did not stop payments on its
contracts.
2) If the university has trouble
keeping its financial commitments
to minority workers or any other
employees or vendors, it could
temporarily use portions of the
$4.5 million in cash that it keeps
in the bank or portions of the $6
million of bonds the university
itself labels as working assets.
3) Another major form of
income which the strike will not
stop is corporate giving. Just as
with federal funds, this money
does not arrive in daily or weekly
installments.
4) In the past fiscal year,
Stanford also earned over $6.5

million from unrestricted general
division endowment funds. This
sum ma> be used for any purpose
the administration desires. Even
with the projected deficit for this
year there is about $4 million to
be reallocated if necessary.
Decisions to increase or decrease
the drawing of funds out of the
endowment investment pool or to
change the nature of the
investments are made by the
Trustees and their Investment
Committee. (No students are
permitted on this committee.)
The Trustees are meeting Monday
and Tuesday of this week and
could work to guarantee that
workers will be paid if they wish
to consider that problem.
So we now see how much
money is really being lost due to
the strike—very little—how much
money is available to alleviate the
crisis—a great deal—and who is
really responsible for penalizing
the workers—the administration
and Trustees. True, without DOD
funds, Stanford would cease to
function in its present manner.
But we can count on the
administration to cloud the issue
by charging that a "small, vocal
group of radicals" is responsible
for the university's financial crisis,
when in truth the crisis stems
entirely from the university's
dependence on the Pentagon.

As the Stanford strike moves

a "small, vocal group of radicals"
who are intent on shutting down
the university as a demonstration
of their revolutionary power. This
is an outright lie. The strike
community is united in its desire
to keep the university open while
redirecting its priorities.
The administration's intent is
clear: destroy the strike by
turning various strike groups
against each other. The workers of
this university will suffer most
from this tactic, while the
students will be made to feel
responsible for shutting the
university down and depriving the
workers of their right to work.
The strike community can no
longer afford to tolerate these
distortions and coercive policies
put forward by the
administration. Based on a large
amount of information gathered
from financial reports and
personal interviews, we make the
following observations:
1) We are told that the
university will be denied money
by the federal government for the
research time lost during the
strike, and that because some of
this money is used to pay salaries,
the administration argues that the
strike is depriving the university
of critical funds. But in reality the
government payments to the
university for grants and contracts
do not arrive after proof of work
done. Moneys arrive quarterly or
monthly, and the offices in
Encina that dispurse this money
to workers have been left open by
the strike. There is of course the
possibility of audit, either internal
or by the Defense Contract Audit
Agency, to see that the money is
not misspent. But we must
remember that the nine-day sit-in
at AEL last spring, followed by
Pitzer's week-long closure of that
lab, did not stop payments on its
contracts.
2) If the university has trouble
keeping its financial commitments
to minority workers or any other
employees or vendors, it could
temporarily use portions of the
$4.5 million in cash that it keeps
in the bank or portions of the $6
million of bonds the university
itself labels as working assets.
3) Another major form of
income which the strike will not
stop is corporate giving. Just as
with federal funds, this money
does not arrive in daily or weekly
installments.
4) In the past fiscal year,
Stanford also earned over $6.5

million from unrestricted general
division endowment funds. This
sum ma> be used for any purpose
the administration desires. Even
with the projected deficit for this
year there is about $4 million to
be reallocated if necessary.
Decisions to increase or decrease
the drawing of funds out of the
endowment investment pool or to
change the nature of the
investments are made by the
Trustees and their Investment
Committee. (No students are
permitted on this committee.)
The Trustees are meeting Monday
and Tuesday of this week and
could work to guarantee that
workers will be paid if they wish
to consider that problem.
So we now see how much
money is really being lost due to
the strike—very little—how much
money is available to alleviate the
crisis—a great deal—and who is
really responsible for penalizing
the workers—the administration
and Trustees. True, without DOD
funds, Stanford would cease to
function in its present manner.
But we can count on the
administration to cloud the issue
by charging that a "small, vocal
group of radicals" is responsible
for the university's financial crisis,
when in truth the crisis stems
entirely from the university's
dependence on the Pentagon.

As the Stanford strike moves
into its second active week, the
strike community is faced with
several critical problems. These
problems stem mainly from the
administration's unwillingness to
deal substantively with the
demands of the strike. They have
chosen instead to raise financial
arguments which threaten to
forcibly undermine the valid
foundations of the strike by
imposing severe sanctions on both
student and working groups
within the Stanford community.
Sunday morning, eight
members of the Strike Steering
Committee met with three
university administrators to
discuss these issues. At that
meeting it was clear that the
administration is unwilling to
operate in anything but a
business-as-usual atmosphere.
Particularly disturbing is their
critically false assumption that
existing university financial
processes set absolute limits on
the options of both the strike and
the university. The
administration's failure to adopt
extraordinary new financial
arrangements at this time
constitutes a refusal to recognize
that both the university and the
nation itself are facing an extreme
crisis situation.
We have called upon the
university to disengage itself from
the Department of Defense, to
cease functioning as an arm of the
federal government and the
military, and to take up its
responsibility to serve as an
effective center for social
criticism. The administration has
countered by insisting that
business-as-usual is its top
priority, and by suggesting that
the university may be closed in
the wake of further protest. The
administration has yet to
demonstrate even the slightest
intention of working toward
satisfying the strike demands.
More importantly, it is making a
clear effort to drive a wedge
between students and workers on
this campus by asserting that the
strike, if continued, will force
layoffs or loss of pay for workers,
especially those who are paid
hourly wages. It is certain that
minority workers will be hit first
and hardest by this policy.
Provost Lyman suggested on
KZSU Sunday evening that while
most of the non-violent strike
community is acting on morally
sound though naive assumptions,
they are playing into the hands of

a "small, vocal group of radicals"
who are intent on shutting down
the university as a demonstration
of their revolutionary power. This
is an outright lie. The strike
