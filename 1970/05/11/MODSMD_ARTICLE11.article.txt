# ASSU Council
## Leadership? 
### 
On Friday a letter was
published in the Daily which
questioned what leadership the
Council of Presidents had shown
this week. 1 wonder what sort of
leadership the writer meant. We
haven't harangued crowds from a
microphone or stuffed more
position papers under doors. That
is not the sort of leadership which
Stanford needs now and it is not
the kind I intend to provide.
The strike for peace which has
unified this campus has been
successful because hundreds of
people decided individually that a
dramatic statement had to be
made to Nixon. It is their
decisions which have given this
strike its strength and will
determine its future direction.
I have my own beliefs about
the strike and have worked during
the last week in ways which I
believed would be most effective
in achieving the goals of the
strike.
First, I believe the strike must
be supported by the good
conscience of individuals and,
therefore, should not be coercive.
It is by appealing to the moral
conscience of people that
adherents are gained, not by
physical confrontation.
Peace Activities
It is because of this belief that I
have not sat in doorways or
walked picket lines. And it was to
assure each individual the chance
to participate in peace activities in
any manner he chose that I
supported and worked for the
changes in academic regulations
approved by the Academic Senate
last Thursday. Students may now
apply for:
1) unlimited pass fails 2)
unlimited incompletes 3)
dropping of exams until the
day before finals
If anyone has difficulties
obtaining these changes in their
program, they should cann the
ASSU Council of Presidents at
Ext. 4333 or the Omsbudsman,
Mr. Herant Katchadourian.
Second, I believe the strike
should keep the University open
in order to use its resources to
work for peace. Stanford should
be open as a rallying point for
opposition to the war this spring,
this summer, and for as long as it
takes to end the Viet Nam war. If
the University is forced to close
for the year because of violence,
the threat of violence, or the
inability of the school to
function, the students will go
home and the work now being

done will to a large extent
collapse.
Anti-war Work Space
It is because of this belief that I
am working to arrange for
working space for anti-war
activities. Until such space is
available the ASSU loft and
bullpen are open for use.
It is because an open University
is such a potent influence on
men's minds that the members of
the Council spent virtually all of
last Sunday, Monday and Tuesday
helping to organize the delegation
to Washington. That delegation
had a tremendous impact on the
people in Washington and set a
precedent which many schools
have followed.
Third, I believe the strike is a
political act to gain support for
peace throughout the country. To
be effective it must be fairly
presented to the nation and its
purpose clearly explained.
Student Address
It is this belief that led me to
support and work for the proposal
for equal time on the major
networks for a Student Address to
the Nation. News coverage alone
is not enough. Students must
speak to the nation to explain
why they have refused to go on
with business as usual. In this way
the strike can be made
understandable to the country
and the anti-war feeling united
against Nixon's decision.
Stanford does not need heavy
leadership to tell it what to do.
People throughout the
community are doing what is
necessary - canvassing, mailing, or
coordinating. Each of us has to
work in his own way. The Council
has been working on projects we
believe to be important and
essential to a successful strike for
peace.
Finally, for those who still care
about public stances and think of
them as the essence of leadership,
the following statement was made
by the Council of Presidents on
Sunday, May 3rd, but was not
printed in the Daily for lack of
space. By the time space became
available publication was
superfluous:
"We support a nonviolent,
non-coercive strike to protest the
further escalation of the Viet Nam
war throughout Cambodia."
Why don't we stop worrying
about who has the microphone
and who is making what
statement and begin asking who is
working for and obtaining
constructive change. That is my
conception of leadership and that
is how I intend to function as a
member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.

constructive change. That is my
conception of leadership and that
is how I intend to function as a
member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
(Robert N. Grant is a member
of the ASSU Council of Presidents
and a prad student in business.)
On Friday a letter was
published in the Daily which
questioned what leadership the
Council of Presidents had shown
this week. 1 wonder what sort of
leadership the writer meant. We
haven't harangued crowds from a
microphone or stuffed more
position papers under doors. That
is not the sort of leadership which
Stanford needs now and it is not
the kind I intend to provide.
The strike for peace which has
unified this campus has been
successful because hundreds of
people decided individually that a
dramatic statement had to be
made to Nixon. It is their
decisions which have given this
strike its strength and will
determine its future direction.
I have my own beliefs about
the strike and have worked during
the last week in ways which I
believed would be most effective
in achieving the goals of the
strike.
First, I believe the strike must
be supported by the good
conscience of individuals and,
therefore, should not be coercive.
It is by appealing to the moral
conscience of people that
adherents are gained, not by
physical confrontation.
Peace Activities
It is because of this belief that I
have not sat in doorways or
walked picket lines. And it was to
assure each individual the chance
to participate in peace activities in
any manner he chose that I
supported and worked for the
changes in academic regulations
approved by the Academic Senate
last Thursday. Students may now
apply for:
1) unlimited pass fails 2)
unlimited incompletes 3)
dropping of exams until the
day before finals
If anyone has difficulties
obtaining these changes in their
program, they should cann the
ASSU Council of Presidents at
Ext. 4333 or the Omsbudsman,
Mr. Herant Katchadourian.
Second, I believe the strike
should keep the University open
in order to use its resources to
work for peace. Stanford should
be open as a rallying point for
opposition to the war this spring,
this summer, and for as long as it
takes to end the Viet Nam war. If
the University is forced to close
for the year because of violence,
the threat of violence, or the
inability of the school to
function, the students will go
home and the work now being

done will to a large extent
collapse.
Anti-war Work Space
It is because of this belief that I
am working to arrange for
working space for anti-war
activities. Until such space is
available the ASSU loft and
bullpen are open for use.
It is because an open University
is such a potent influence on
men's minds that the members of
the Council spent virtually all of
last Sunday, Monday and Tuesday
helping to organize the delegation
to Washington. That delegation
had a tremendous impact on the
people in Washington and set a
precedent which many schools
have followed.
Third, I believe the strike is a
political act to gain support for
peace throughout the country. To
be effective it must be fairly
presented to the nation and its
purpose clearly explained.
Student Address
It is this belief that led me to
support and work for the proposal
for equal time on the major
networks for a Student Address to
the Nation. News coverage alone
is not enough. Students must
speak to the nation to explain
why they have refused to go on
with business as usual. In this way
the strike can be made
understandable to the country
and the anti-war feeling united
against Nixon's decision.
Stanford does not need heavy
leadership to tell it what to do.
People throughout the
community are doing what is
necessary - canvassing, mailing, or
coordinating. Each of us has to
work in his own way. The Council
has been working on projects we
believe to be important and
essential to a successful strike for
peace.
Finally, for those who still care
about public stances and think of
them as the essence of leadership,
the following statement was made
by the Council of Presidents on
Sunday, May 3rd, but was not
printed in the Daily for lack of
space. By the time space became
available publication was
superfluous:
"We support a nonviolent,
non-coercive strike to protest the
further escalation of the Viet Nam
war throughout Cambodia."
Why don't we stop worrying
about who has the microphone
and who is making what
statement and begin asking who is
working for and obtaining
constructive change. That is my
conception of leadership and that
is how I intend to function as a
member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
