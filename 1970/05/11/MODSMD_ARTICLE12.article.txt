# The 						Washington Delegation
## Back From The Devil's Den 
### Don Ayer 
The Stanford delegation to Washington has returned and over the
next few days there will be a flood of comment on what we did and
did not accomplish. Radical elements will be preaching the utter
pointlessness of the trip, as an adjunct of their commitment to make
the democratic process fail. Some members of the delegation, in fact,
left mid-way through the trip, and came home to declare the
pilgrimage a failure.
Success and failure, of course, are relative to the goal which one
seeks. And while revolutionaries might characterize the trip as futile,
those of a less extreme outlook found it quite rewarding. Three
specific developments can be cited.
First, we were given a new respect for government leaders as human
beings; they are subject to the same weaknesses and strengths as the
rest of us. Though we disagree with their policies, it is clear from
talking with men like Kissenger and Packard that they believe they are
acting in the best interests of the country. Most of the men whom we
confronted met with us for upwards of an hour, and were genuinely
concerned with what we had to say.
They were rehumanized. And for committed revolutionaries, this is
enough to make the trip a failure. Nothing is more damaging to the
radical scenario than concrete evidence that the government is not run
by the devil and his henchmen. Inhuman actions are only justifiable
against an opposition which is even more inhuman.
A Viable Alternative
Second, we were presented with an immediate and viable channel
for our concern and frustration. We found a new solidarity, an alliance
of purpose with the anti-war leaders in Congress. The Pete
McCloskey's and Allard Lowenstein's desperately need our help in
their bids for re-election. And new men must be elected.
Recalcitrants in Congress can and must be made to respond to the
rising tide of opposition. Letters, petitions, and personal visits carry
the implicit threat of defeat; they will have an effect if the numbers
are sufficient. Both Houses are organizing to force record votes on the
question of a hasty withdrawal. We must support that move.
Finally, in addition to this direction of our own efforts, the
urgency of the campus climate was communicated again and again.
The fact of our journey, coupled with the visits of college students
from throughout the East, brought home to the administration the

crisis of faith which the country is experiencing.
Agnew Meeting
In way of example, ASSU President Pat C. Shea and I spent almost
two hours talking with Spiro Agnew's legislative assistant. The focus
of the conversation was campus unrest and its relation to Cambodia
and other administration action. The point was made repeatedly that
Agnew's rhetorical idiocy only aggravates the problem; he must bear a
share of the blame for the alienation of American youth.
The discussion was terminated (somewhat apologetically) when our
host left for a meeting at the White House on the very topic we had
been discussing. He admitted that the administration was partly to
blame, and said that they were coming to realize that the campus
situation had changed qualitatively since the Cambodia decision.
The next morning, newspapers headlined a new effort by the
administration to listen and talk with dissenters. The rumor was
leaked that Agnew would be toned down, and though it was routinely
denied, the Vice President has since issued a statement critical of the
Kent State National Guardsmen, and departed from one prepared text
to avoid a line which might be taken as inflammatory.
A New Effort
The government is making a new effort at reconciliation. Though
they have not yet gotten to the crux of the problem, the Southeast
Asian policy, they have clearly advanced in their appreciation of the
domestic situation. It is only through efforts like this delegation's, to
break through the bureaucratic coccoon, that this has been possible.
The comment has often been made that the government is out of
touch with the horror of Vietnam and the disillusionment of its own
constituents. It is called unresponsive and unquestionably this is true.
But we must not fail to see that this lack of response is a part of
our age, apparent as well in the lack of communication throughout
society. We must also recognize that the problem is as much a failure
of our own efforts as of any official's disposition to ignore us.
Richard Nixon is not the Anti-Christ. Creating a black-hatted villain
won't solve the problem. He and the other leaders must be regarded as
people, albeit misguided ones in our view. It is only from this
perspective that we can channel our dissent into useful efforts.

share of the blame for the alienation of American youth.
The discussion was terminated (somewhat apologetically) when our
host left for a meeting at the White House on the very topic we had
been discussing. He admitted that the administration was partly to
blame, and said that they were coming to realize that the campus
situation had changed qualitatively since the Cambodia decision.
The next morning, newspapers headlined a new effort by the
administration to listen and talk with dissenters. The rumor was
leaked that Agnew would be toned down, and though it was routinely
denied, the Vice President has since issued a statement critical of the
Kent State National Guardsmen, and departed from one prepared text
to avoid a line which might be taken as inflammatory.
A New Effort
The government is making a new effort at reconciliation. Though
they have not yet gotten to the crux of the problem, the Southeast
Asian policy, they have clearly advanced in their appreciation of the
domestic situation. It is only through efforts like this delegation's, to
break through the bureaucratic coccoon, that this has been possible.
The comment has often been made that the government is out of
touch with the horror of Vietnam and the disillusionment of its own
constituents. It is called unresponsive and unquestionably this is true.
But we must not fail to see that this lack of response is a part of
our age, apparent as well in the lack of communication throughout
society. We must also recognize that the problem is as much a failure
of our own efforts as of any official's disposition to ignore us.
Richard Nixon is not the Anti-Christ. Creating a black-hatted villain
won't solve the problem. He and the other leaders must be regarded as
people, albeit misguided ones in our view. It is only from this
perspective that we can channel our dissent into useful efforts.
(Don Ayer is a junior in history and president of the Young
Republicans.)
The Stanford delegation to Washington has returned and over the
next few days there will be a flood of comment on what we did and
did not accomplish. Radical elements will be preaching the utter
pointlessness of the trip, as an adjunct of their commitment to make
the democratic process fail. Some members of the delegation, in fact,
left mid-way through the trip, and came home to declare the
pilgrimage a failure.
Success and failure, of course, are relative to the goal which one
seeks. And while revolutionaries might characterize the trip as futile,
those of a less extreme outlook found it quite rewarding. Three
specific developments can be cited.
First, we were given a new respect for government leaders as human
beings; they are subject to the same weaknesses and strengths as the
rest of us. Though we disagree with their policies, it is clear from
talking with men like Kissenger and Packard that they believe they are
acting in the best interests of the country. Most of the men whom we
confronted met with us for upwards of an hour, and were genuinely
concerned with what we had to say.
They were rehumanized. And for committed revolutionaries, this is
enough to make the trip a failure. Nothing is more damaging to the
radical scenario than concrete evidence that the government is not run
by the devil and his henchmen. Inhuman actions are only justifiable
against an opposition which is even more inhuman.
A Viable Alternative
Second, we were presented with an immediate and viable channel
for our concern and frustration. We found a new solidarity, an alliance
of purpose with the anti-war leaders in Congress. The Pete
McCloskey's and Allard Lowenstein's desperately need our help in
their bids for re-election. And new men must be elected.
Recalcitrants in Congress can and must be made to respond to the
rising tide of opposition. Letters, petitions, and personal visits carry
the implicit threat of defeat; they will have an effect if the numbers
are sufficient. Both Houses are organizing to force record votes on the
question of a hasty withdrawal. We must support that move.
Finally, in addition to this direction of our own efforts, the
urgency of the campus climate was communicated again and again.
The fact of our journey, coupled with the visits of college students
from throughout the East, brought home to the administration the

crisis of faith which the country is experiencing.
Agnew Meeting
In way of example, ASSU President Pat C. Shea and I spent almost
two hours talking with Spiro Agnew's legislative assistant. The focus
of the conversation was campus unrest and its relation to Cambodia
and other administration action. The point was made repeatedly that
Agnew's rhetorical idiocy only aggravates the problem; he must bear a
share of the blame for the alienation of American youth.
The discussion was terminated (somewhat apologetically) when our
