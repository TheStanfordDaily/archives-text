# Two Days In Washington
## 
### Sanford Dornbusch 
I'll try to make this report as
general and objective as possible,
since I am writing as Coordinator
of the Stanford delegation to
Washington. I believe it important
for each member of the delegation
to have an opportunity to give hs
personal impressions and
evaluations.
1. As the first University
delegation to Washington, we
helped stimulate other schools to
action. Yale, Dartmouth, Harvard
Law, and Haverford are among
those following us. The
cumulative impact will not be
known for several weeks.
2. With only 24 hours notice,
we got to major decision-makers
in the White House (Kissinger for
foreign affairs and Ehrlichman for
domestic affairs), Defense
Department (Deputy Secretary
Packard), and State Department
(Undersecretary Richardson,
number two man). The Wall
Street Journal and NBC-TV both
marveled at our ability to open
doors usually closed even to high
government officials.
3. These decision-makers gave
us plenty of time to present our
sense of collective impotence and
our perception that national
decisions are increasingly viewed
as illegitimate. Our group
presentations provided new
information for these isolated
men. Kissinger asked us to return
in the fall.
4. The members of our
delegation ranged from
conservative Republican to radical
left. This made our general
consensus more surprising to men
previously disposed to dismiss our
statements as minority views. It's
impressive when the crisis of
confidence is expressed by the
head of the Stanford Young
Republicans.
5. Robert Finch, Secretary of
HEW, listened to our White House
presentation and asked that we
visit him the next day. He seemed
particularly moved by our sense
of urgency and our anger at
Vice-President Agnew's slurs upon
m in ority-admission practices.
Finch's public comments since

then have reflected his new
awareness of youth's sense of
outrage.
6. Over 3800 Stanford students
signed a petition to President
Nixon protesting our policy in
Southeast Asia. Henry Kissinger
was given the petition to deliver as
he left for a meeting with the
President.
7. The House and Senate
seemed to share a sense of
impotence as we arrived. As we
left one day later, the situation
was changing. The head of the
New York Times Washington
bureau said that this past week
has seen an unprecedented
expression of public views.
8. At least one Republican
Senator was pushed off the fence
by our delegation's visit,
according to the San Francisco
Chronicle, and we may have
affected others.
9. We brought back from a
Congressional source a list of 103
Congressmen who are not
completely committed to either
side. This list has been given to
PACC for distribution to national
and regional centers.
10. Friday night, one member
of our delegation was asked by
ABC-TV to appear with Howard
K. Smith as the only student in
the panel following President
Nixon's press conference.
1 1 . Senator Fulbright,
impressed by the success of
university delegations, intends to
ask representatives of more than
20 colleges to a conference in
Washington.
12. Prof. John Lewis met with
Asian experts in the White House,
C.1.A., State Department, and
Defense Department. He learned
that none were consulted as the
Cambodian invasion was
launched
13. The members of our Third
World delegation emphasized to
legislators and news media their
view that this is a racist war. They
also stated their concern about
Vice-President Agnew's
stigmatizing of minority students.
14. Those who favored
President Nixon's decision on

Cambodia were startled by the
force of the negative public
response. Our delegation sought
to emphasize the scope of this
reaction. Simultaneously we
attempted to help those who are
opposed to our Southeast Asia
policy to coalesce in their
legislative efforts.
May I close with a personal
impression of cautious optimism.
The situation in Washington is

even worse than I expected, with
poor communication among
decision-makers, isolation from
public opinion, and a harried and
ineffective Congress. But the rage
of the moderates has given new
life to the anti-war forces in
Congress and startled the
Administration. The peace
movement now has a slight chance
to win.

as illegitimate. Our group
presentations provided new
information for these isolated
men. Kissinger asked us to return
in the fall.
4. The members of our
delegation ranged from
conservative Republican to radical
left. This made our general
consensus more surprising to men
previously disposed to dismiss our
statements as minority views. It's
impressive when the crisis of
confidence is expressed by the
head of the Stanford Young
Republicans.
5. Robert Finch, Secretary of
HEW, listened to our White House
presentation and asked that we
visit him the next day. He seemed
particularly moved by our sense
of urgency and our anger at
Vice-President Agnew's slurs upon
m in ority-admission practices.
Finch's public comments since

then have reflected his new
awareness of youth's sense of
outrage.
6. Over 3800 Stanford students
signed a petition to President
Nixon protesting our policy in
Southeast Asia. Henry Kissinger
was given the petition to deliver as
he left for a meeting with the
President.
7. The House and Senate
seemed to share a sense of
impotence as we arrived. As we
left one day later, the situation
was changing. The head of the
New York Times Washington
bureau said that this past week
has seen an unprecedented
expression of public views.
8. At least one Republican
Senator was pushed off the fence
by our delegation's visit,
according to the San Francisco
Chronicle, and we may have
affected others.
9. We brought back from a
Congressional source a list of 103
Congressmen who are not
completely committed to either
side. This list has been given to
PACC for distribution to national
and regional centers.
10. Friday night, one member
of our delegation was asked by
ABC-TV to appear with Howard
K. Smith as the only student in
the panel following President
Nixon's press conference.
1 1 . Senator Fulbright,
impressed by the success of
university delegations, intends to
ask representatives of more than
20 colleges to a conference in
Washington.
12. Prof. John Lewis met with
Asian experts in the White House,
C.1.A., State Department, and
Defense Department. He learned
that none were consulted as the
Cambodian invasion was
launched
13. The members of our Third
World delegation emphasized to
legislators and news media their
view that this is a racist war. They
also stated their concern about
Vice-President Agnew's
stigmatizing of minority students.
14. Those who favored
President Nixon's decision on

Cambodia were startled by the
force of the negative public
response. Our delegation sought
to emphasize the scope of this
reaction. Simultaneously we
attempted to help those who are
opposed to our Southeast Asia
policy to coalesce in their
legislative efforts.
May I close with a personal
impression of cautious optimism.
The situation in Washington is

even worse than I expected, with
poor communication among
decision-makers, isolation from
public opinion, and a harried and
ineffective Congress. But the rage
of the moderates has given new
life to the anti-war forces in
Congress and startled the
Administration. The peace
movement now has a slight chance
to win.
(Sanford Dornbusch is a
professor of sociology.)
I'll try to make this report as
general and objective as possible,
since I am writing as Coordinator
of the Stanford delegation to
Washington. I believe it important
for each member of the delegation
to have an opportunity to give hs
personal impressions and
evaluations.
1. As the first University
delegation to Washington, we
helped stimulate other schools to
action. Yale, Dartmouth, Harvard
Law, and Haverford are among
those following us. The
cumulative impact will not be
known for several weeks.
2. With only 24 hours notice,
we got to major decision-makers
in the White House (Kissinger for
foreign affairs and Ehrlichman for
domestic affairs), Defense
Department (Deputy Secretary
Packard), and State Department
(Undersecretary Richardson,
number two man). The Wall
Street Journal and NBC-TV both
marveled at our ability to open
doors usually closed even to high
government officials.
3. These decision-makers gave
us plenty of time to present our
sense of collective impotence and
our perception that national
decisions are increasingly viewed
as illegitimate. Our group
presentations provided new
information for these isolated
men. Kissinger asked us to return
in the fall.
