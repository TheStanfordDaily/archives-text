# BSU Charges Arrest Racism
## 
### 
Open Letter To
President Pitzer
On April 29th 1970, two
students were beaten so badly by
the police that they had to be
given medical treatment. We are
not protesting that there were
only two who were beaten, but
that the only two were men of
color. The one most seriously
injured, Bijay Sharma, an Indian
student of very dark complexion,
was freed, and the charges against
him were dropped because it was
so obvious that his beating and
arrest were so unjust and
unwarranted. The other was
Burnell Mack, an African
-American brother also of dark
complexion. Burnell was beaten
so badly that he could not walk,
and Bijay Sharma had to help him
through the doors of the hospital.
Based on these two incidents
and the one in which there was a
confrontation between the Santa
Clara deputies and leaders of the
Black Students Union, we can
only come to the conclusion that
the frustrated and wounded
"people's protestors" were on a
Nigger Hunt. In a letter to Bijay
Sharma the police have admitted
to racial discrimination in their
arrest and beating. In a meeting
with you and a representative of
the Sheriff's office on April 30th,
BSU officers accepted the
apologies of the Sheriff's office
for his men attacking us and
allowing white students to sit

untouched in the middle of White
Plaza while smoking weed.
Since it has been admitted that
they acted in a racist manner in
their attack on Sharma and the
BSU leaders, why is it being left
unassumed that the vicious attack
upon Burnell Mack was the result
of similar motivations? We ask
you to assume, but we know for
sure that the attack upon Burnell
was a result of the fact that the
deputies were not being allowed
to retaliate against rich white boys
and girls who were showering
them with stones and missiles.
Burnell was grabbed out of the
crowd because he stood out in
that great mass of whiteness that
was running like rabbits when
confronted by the army of the
Establishment.
We therefore demand that the
university, as owners of Palo Alto
and Santa Clara County, to have
the trumped up charges against
Burnell Mack dropped, or pay all
legal fees arising out of his trial.
We do not wish to polarize this
campus further, but we can not
and will not allow one of our
brothers to be ripped off to
justify the racist over-reaction of
the Sheriff's department. We also
demand that any medical
expenses incurred as a result of
this beating by payed by the
Sheriff or the University.
We are holding a rally at 12:00
today in White Plaza to further
explain our position.
