# Business As Usual For Campus Films
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Campus film series will
continue as scheduled, with some
program changes due to
circumstances beyond everyone's
control.
Monday evening, the Kinetic
Art program, cancelled last week,
will be shown at 7:30 and 9:30 in
the Art Auditorium. Among the
experimental short films to be
screened are Jan Svankmajer's
"Historia Natura," pop artist Fred
Mogubgub's "Unknown
Reasons's," Stan Vanderbeek's
"See Saw Seems," Yoji Kuri's
animated abstract film "Au Fou"
and "Vaucherin," considered by
some to be the most important
short film of 1970.
Check this week's Daily for the
time and date of the sixth
program of the Kinetic Art Series,
originally scheduled for
Wednesday evening.
Clive Miller has a great program
lined up for Tuesday's Freshman
Film Series at 7:45 in Geology
320. Last week the series was
cancelled, but "The More the
Merrier" has been rescheduled for
this Tuesday. It replaces
"Possessed."
W.C. Field's 1933 comedy,
"The Fatal Glass of Beer," will be
shown at 8, followed at 8:30 by
"Confidential Agent" starring
Charles Boyer, Lauren Bacall
(Mrs. Humphrey Bogart), and
Peter Lorre. "The More the
Merrier," a 1943 comedy directed
by George Stevens and starring
Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea and
Charles Coburn will be shown at
10:30.
Neorealist Classic
Thursday, "Bicycle Thief" will
be presented by the Stanford
Community Against War and
Fascism at 8 p.m. in Bishop
Auditorium. Vittoria de Sica
("Umberto D," "Yesterday,
Today, and Tomorrow,"
'Marriage Italian Style") made an
honest attempt to create a classic
neorealist film that reflects
unstaged reality.
Superficially, the film relates
the story of a destitute man who
needs a bicycle in order to get a
job. His bicycle is stolen and we
watch him and his son in their
desperate attempt to find it
before he has to return to work
on Monday. For what it's worth,
in 1958, an international poll of
117 film historians chose "Bicycle
Thief" as one of the twelve best
films ever made.
Along with "Bicycle Thief,"
SCAWF will show "Isle of
Youth," a film that "deals with an
experiment in pure communism in
progress on a small Cuban island
where money and private
property are becoming irrelevant.
This exciting view of young
people living and working
together demonstrates the
potential of real communism and
begins to construct a working
model for the future. In English."
(Attention Spiro Agnew.)
Also on Thursday, "Barren
Lives" will be shown at 8 in
Cubberley by the International
Association. One of the most
important films to emerge from
Cinema Novo, "Barren Lives,"
filmed in Brazil in 1963, is a
memorable and historic portrait
of a family of destitute peasants.
Silent Series
The Silent Film Series will
feature Rene Clair's "Italian Straw
Hat" (1927), and"Day Dreams"
at 7, 8 and 9 in Tresidder. Pauline
Kael, who either loves a movie or
hates it with equal passion, wrote,
" 'The Italian Straw Hat' is very
.imply one of the funniest films
ever made and one of the most
elegant as well. A silent satire on
the pretensions of the middle
classes, it is so expertly timed and
choreographed that farce becomes
ballet."
"Day Dreams," directed by
vor Montagu in 1928, is based on
H.G. Wells' satire of a servant girl
(Elsa Lanchester) who "fantasizes
herself in the throes of aristocratic
passions as a great actress, as a
leader of fashion, et cetera." A
"pudgy young Charles Laughton"
is the mock villain and Harold
Vitrrender is the mock hero in this
inventive slapstick comedy.
Bergman Comedy
Ingrnar Bergman's "Magician"
will also be shown on Friday night

at 7, 9 and 11 in Cubberley. I
consider Bergman to be one of the
greatest film directors of all time.
His masterpieces include "The
Seventh Seal," "Smiles of a
Summer Night," "Wild
Strawberries," "Hour of the
Wolf," "Persona," and most
recently "Shame." He made "The
Magician" (British title: "The
Face") in 1958 and won the
Special Prize at the Venice Film
Festival that year for "the best
directing, poetic originality and
style," and the Italian film critics
award for best foreign film of
1959.
Max Von Sydow portrays a
mysterious mesmerist, Vogler, in
Sweden a hundred years ago who
arrives with his troupe in a small
town, is brought to a rich man's
house and ordered to give a
performance. It is revealed that
the mesmerist is a charlatan, and
his "male" assistant Aman (Ingrid
Thulin), is really his wife.
Bergman labels "The Magician"
a comedy, but you can never look
at his films in terms of their

surface value. His characters and
the situations he creates for them
are most ambiguous, and"The
Magician" is no exception to his
style.

Pauline Kael, the nation's
resident film critic, author of I
Lost it at the Movies and Kiss Kiss
Bang Bang is scheduled to give a

week.
The Beatles' new film, "Let It
Be," described as "an intimate
view of the Beatles as musical
creators and performers," will
open this week at Town and
Country Cinema in Sunnyvale,
The Garden in San Jose, and The
Empire and Alhambra Theaters in
San Francisco.
. "2001 Gpace Odyssey" is back
at the Varsity in Palo Alto.
"Woodstock" is well worth a
trip to the City, but I'm not so
sure about the $4 admission. It's
three hours of The Who, Jimi
Hendrix, Ten Years After,
Santana, Crosby, Stills, Nash,
Richie Havens ... so go prepared.

The Garden in San Jose, and The
Empire and Alhambra Theaters in
San Francisco.
. "2001 Gpace Odyssey" is back
at the Varsity in Palo Alto.
"Woodstock" is well worth a

sure about the $4 admission. It's
three hours of The Who, Jimi
Hendrix, Ten Years After,
Santana, Crosby, Stills, Nash,
Richie Havens ... so go prepared.

Campus film series will
continue as scheduled, with some
program changes due to
circumstances beyond everyone's
control.
Monday evening, the Kinetic
Art program, cancelled last week,
will be shown at 7:30 and 9:30 in
the Art Auditorium. Among the
experimental short films to be
screened are Jan Svankmajer's
"Historia Natura," pop artist Fred
Mogubgub's "Unknown
Reasons's," Stan Vanderbeek's
"See Saw Seems," Yoji Kuri's
animated abstract film "Au Fou"
and "Vaucherin," considered by
some to be the most important
short film of 1970.
Check this week's Daily for the
time and date of the sixth
program of the Kinetic Art Series,
originally scheduled for
Wednesday evening.
Clive Miller has a great program
lined up for Tuesday's Freshman
Film Series at 7:45 in Geology
320. Last week the series was
cancelled, but "The More the
Merrier" has been rescheduled for
this Tuesday. It replaces
"Possessed."
W.C. Field's 1933 comedy,
"The Fatal Glass of Beer," will be
shown at 8, followed at 8:30 by
"Confidential Agent" starring
Charles Boyer, Lauren Bacall
(Mrs. Humphrey Bogart), and
Peter Lorre. "The More the
Merrier," a 1943 comedy directed
by George Stevens and starring
Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea and
Charles Coburn will be shown at
10:30.
Neorealist Classic
Thursday, "Bicycle Thief" will
be presented by the Stanford
Community Against War and
Fascism at 8 p.m. in Bishop
Auditorium. Vittoria de Sica
("Umberto D," "Yesterday,
Today, and Tomorrow,"
'Marriage Italian Style") made an
honest attempt to create a classic
neorealist film that reflects
unstaged reality.
Superficially, the film relates
the story of a destitute man who
needs a bicycle in order to get a
job. His bicycle is stolen and we
watch him and his son in their
desperate attempt to find it
before he has to return to work
on Monday. For what it's worth,
in 1958, an international poll of
117 film historians chose "Bicycle
Thief" as one of the twelve best
films ever made.
Along with "Bicycle Thief,"
SCAWF will show "Isle of
Youth," a film that "deals with an
experiment in pure communism in
progress on a small Cuban island
where money and private
property are becoming irrelevant.
This exciting view of young
people living and working
together demonstrates the
potential of real communism and
begins to construct a working
model for the future. In English."
(Attention Spiro Agnew.)
Also on Thursday, "Barren
Lives" will be shown at 8 in
Cubberley by the International
Association. One of the most
important films to emerge from
Cinema Novo, "Barren Lives,"
filmed in Brazil in 1963, is a
memorable and historic portrait
of a family of destitute peasants.
Silent Series
The Silent Film Series will
feature Rene Clair's "Italian Straw
Hat" (1927), and"Day Dreams"
at 7, 8 and 9 in Tresidder. Pauline
Kael, who either loves a movie or
hates it with equal passion, wrote,
" 'The Italian Straw Hat' is very
.imply one of the funniest films
ever made and one of the most
elegant as well. A silent satire on
the pretensions of the middle
classes, it is so expertly timed and
choreographed that farce becomes
ballet."
"Day Dreams," directed by
vor Montagu in 1928, is based on
H.G. Wells' satire of a servant girl
(Elsa Lanchester) who "fantasizes
herself in the throes of aristocratic
passions as a great actress, as a
leader of fashion, et cetera." A
"pudgy young Charles Laughton"
is the mock villain and Harold
Vitrrender is the mock hero in this
inventive slapstick comedy.
Bergman Comedy
Ingrnar Bergman's "Magician"
will also be shown on Friday night

at 7, 9 and 11 in Cubberley. I
consider Bergman to be one of the
greatest film directors of all time.
His masterpieces include "The
Seventh Seal," "Smiles of a
Summer Night," "Wild
Strawberries," "Hour of the
Wolf," "Persona," and most
recently "Shame." He made "The
Magician" (British title: "The
Face") in 1958 and won the
Special Prize at the Venice Film
Festival that year for "the best
directing, poetic originality and
style," and the Italian film critics
award for best foreign film of
1959.
Max Von Sydow portrays a
mysterious mesmerist, Vogler, in
Sweden a hundred years ago who
arrives with his troupe in a small
town, is brought to a rich man's
house and ordered to give a
performance. It is revealed that
the mesmerist is a charlatan, and
his "male" assistant Aman (Ingrid
Thulin), is really his wife.
Bergman labels "The Magician"
a comedy, but you can never look
at his films in terms of their

surface value. His characters and
the situations he creates for them
are most ambiguous, and"The
Magician" is no exception to his
style.

at his films in terms of their

surface value. His characters and
the situations he creates for them
are most ambiguous, and"The
Magician" is no exception to his

Bang Bang is scheduled to give a

The Beatles' new film, "Let It

view of the Beatles as musical
creators and performers," will
open this week at Town and
Country Cinema in Sunnyvale,
The Garden in San Jose, and The
Empire and Alhambra Theaters in
San Francisco.
. "2001 Gpace Odyssey" is back
at the Varsity in Palo Alto.
"Woodstock" is well worth a
trip to the City, but I'm not so
sure about the $4 admission. It's
three hours of The Who, Jimi
Hendrix, Ten Years After,
Santana, Crosby, Stills, Nash,
Richie Havens ... so go prepared.

Campus film series will
continue as scheduled, with some
program changes due to
circumstances beyond everyone's
control.
Monday evening, the Kinetic
Art program, cancelled last week,
will be shown at 7:30 and 9:30 in
the Art Auditorium. Among the
experimental short films to be
screened are Jan Svankmajer's
"Historia Natura," pop artist Fred
Mogubgub's "Unknown
Reasons's," Stan Vanderbeek's
"See Saw Seems," Yoji Kuri's
animated abstract film "Au Fou"
and "Vaucherin," considered by
some to be the most important
short film of 1970.
Check this week's Daily for the
time and date of the sixth
program of the Kinetic Art Series,
originally scheduled for
Wednesday evening.
Clive Miller has a great program
lined up for Tuesday's Freshman
Film Series at 7:45 in Geology
320. Last week the series was
cancelled, but "The More the
Merrier" has been rescheduled for
this Tuesday. It replaces
"Possessed."
W.C. Field's 1933 comedy,
"The Fatal Glass of Beer," will be
shown at 8, followed at 8:30 by
"Confidential Agent" starring
Charles Boyer, Lauren Bacall
(Mrs. Humphrey Bogart), and
Peter Lorre. "The More the
Merrier," a 1943 comedy directed
by George Stevens and starring
Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea and
Charles Coburn will be shown at
10:30.
Neorealist Classic
Thursday, "Bicycle Thief" will
be presented by the Stanford
Community Against War and
Fascism at 8 p.m. in Bishop
Auditorium. Vittoria de Sica
("Umberto D," "Yesterday,
Today, and Tomorrow,"
'Marriage Italian Style") made an
honest attempt to create a classic
neorealist film that reflects
unstaged reality.
Superficially, the film relates
the story of a destitute man who
needs a bicycle in order to get a
job. His bicycle is stolen and we
watch him and his son in their
desperate attempt to find it
before he has to return to work
on Monday. For what it's worth,
in 1958, an international poll of
117 film historians chose "Bicycle
Thief" as one of the twelve best
films ever made.
Along with "Bicycle Thief,"
SCAWF will show "Isle of
Youth," a film that "deals with an
experiment in pure communism in
progress on a small Cuban island
where money and private
property are becoming irrelevant.
This exciting view of young
people living and working
together demonstrates the
potential of real communism and
begins to construct a working
model for the future. In English."
(Attention Spiro Agnew.)
Also on Thursday, "Barren
Lives" will be shown at 8 in
Cubberley by the International
Association. One of the most
important films to emerge from
Cinema Novo, "Barren Lives,"
filmed in Brazil in 1963, is a
memorable and historic portrait
of a family of destitute peasants.
Silent Series
The Silent Film Series will
feature Rene Clair's "Italian Straw
Hat" (1927), and"Day Dreams"
at 7, 8 and 9 in Tresidder. Pauline
Kael, who either loves a movie or
hates it with equal passion, wrote,
" 'The Italian Straw Hat' is very
.imply one of the funniest films
ever made and one of the most
elegant as well. A silent satire on
the pretensions of the middle
classes, it is so expertly timed and
choreographed that farce becomes
ballet."
"Day Dreams," directed by
vor Montagu in 1928, is based on
H.G. Wells' satire of a servant girl
(Elsa Lanchester) who "fantasizes
herself in the throes of aristocratic
passions as a great actress, as a
leader of fashion, et cetera." A
"pudgy young Charles Laughton"
is the mock villain and Harold
Vitrrender is the mock hero in this
inventive slapstick comedy.
Bergman Comedy
Ingrnar Bergman's "Magician"
will also be shown on Friday night

at 7, 9 and 11 in Cubberley. I
consider Bergman to be one of the
greatest film directors of all time.
His masterpieces include "The
Seventh Seal," "Smiles of a
Summer Night," "Wild
Strawberries," "Hour of the
Wolf," "Persona," and most
recently "Shame." He made "The
Magician" (British title: "The
Face") in 1958 and won the
Special Prize at the Venice Film
Festival that year for "the best
directing, poetic originality and
style," and the Italian film critics
award for best foreign film of
1959.
Max Von Sydow portrays a
mysterious mesmerist, Vogler, in
Sweden a hundred years ago who
arrives with his troupe in a small
town, is brought to a rich man's
house and ordered to give a
performance. It is revealed that
the mesmerist is a charlatan, and
his "male" assistant Aman (Ingrid
Thulin), is really his wife.
Bergman labels "The Magician"
a comedy, but you can never look
at his films in terms of their

surface value. His characters and
the situations he creates for them
are most ambiguous, and"The
Magician" is no exception to his
