# Little Remains Of D.C. Rally
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The tens
of thousands of demonstrators
were gone, their litter had
vanished, and around the White
House Sunday was the usual crop
of summer tourists photographing
one another in front of its familiar
facade.
All that remained as a reminder
that Saturday there had been
60,000 to 100,000 on the Ellipse
back of the south lawn of the
executive mansion, were an
unusual number of police, secret
service, and a few soldiers.
The day before, bitter, angry
and often socially unacceptable
words blared across at President
Nixon for the U.S. involvement in
Vietnam, Cambodia and
Laos—but the crowd had seemed
little stirred by the speeches and
applauded hardly at all. It was as
if the demonstrators felt their
numbers were enough expression
of dissent.
Size Surprising
The size of the gathering,
hurriedly organized after the
shooting of four Kent State
University students Monday,
surprised even its sponsors, the
New Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam. It was
far less, though than the 250,000
here for the Moratorium last
November and seemed to have far
less focus.
The conciliatory attitude of the
Nixon administration—lacking
previously —and its willingness to
meet with the demonstrators in
sundry groupings, appeared to
contribute to the peacefulness.
The President himself made a 5
a.m. appearance at the Lincoln
Memorial and started the dialogue
that was continued by others in
various government offices
throughout the day. White House
staffers even went into the crowd
to invite demonstrators in for a
chat.
Nixon's press secretary said the
President could see and hear the
demonstrators. It was in sharp
contrast to November when the
White House said the President
watched a football game while the
gathering took place.
The debiliatating, 90-degree
heat, it was agreed, also helped to
defuse potential violence. At one
point, 3,000 left the speeches to

watch a group cavoting in the
shallow Washington Monument
reflecting pool—some stripped to
the buff.
"It's too beautiful a day for
anything ugly to happen," said
one girl.
There were reminders Sunday
that not all had gone well:
workmen repaired the glass
broken at two banks and a drug
store in the DuPont Circle area a
mile away that is a favorite
lounging place for the college-age
group; a police blotter that
totaled 264 male and 82 female
misdemeanor bookings that
mostly were wiped clean with $10
collateral and no court
appearances; a handful of jeeps
parked here and there with
soldiers; a policeman hospitalized
with a head injury.
Cleanup Made
On the Ellipse, workmen were
taking down the loudspeaker
stands erected with presidential
permission; green-clad government
employees were picking up bits of
paper and soft-drink cans —and
there weren't a large number at
that.
The sporadic incidents that
caused police to fire tear gas after
the three-hour rally on the Ellipse
also ceased after midnight.
Gone from the White House
area were the 60 city buses that
provided a totally impenetrable
barrier—eventhough one almost
was tipped over. In Lafayette
Park, an off-limits area Saturday,
fewer than 100 people were
gathered in a circle praying for a
cessation of the war.
As the President and his family
participated in a Mother's Day
prayer service in the East Room,
there were dozens of young
people headed out of town
carrying bedrolls and blankets and
waring signs to designate their
hitch hiking destinations: Miami,
New Haven, Syracuse, Philly.
They carried with them the
message that emerged from the
speeches on the Ellipse: to
continue the pressure to get
United States troops out of
Southeast Asia through political
action and tactics like the strike
that closed hundreds of colleges
through the nation last week.

that Saturday there had been
60,000 to 100,000 on the Ellipse
back of the south lawn of the
executive mansion, were an
unusual number of police, secret
service, and a few soldiers.
The day before, bitter, angry
and often socially unacceptable
words blared across at President
Nixon for the U.S. involvement in
Vietnam, Cambodia and
Laos—but the crowd had seemed
little stirred by the speeches and
applauded hardly at all. It was as
if the demonstrators felt their
numbers were enough expression
of dissent.
Size Surprising
The size of the gathering,
hurriedly organized after the
shooting of four Kent State
University students Monday,
surprised even its sponsors, the
New Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam. It was
far less, though than the 250,000
here for the Moratorium last
November and seemed to have far
less focus.
The conciliatory attitude of the
Nixon administration—lacking
previously —and its willingness to
meet with the demonstrators in
sundry groupings, appeared to
contribute to the peacefulness.
The President himself made a 5
a.m. appearance at the Lincoln
Memorial and started the dialogue
that was continued by others in
various government offices
throughout the day. White House
staffers even went into the crowd
to invite demonstrators in for a
chat.
Nixon's press secretary said the
President could see and hear the
demonstrators. It was in sharp
contrast to November when the
White House said the President
watched a football game while the
gathering took place.
The debiliatating, 90-degree
heat, it was agreed, also helped to
defuse potential violence. At one
point, 3,000 left the speeches to

watch a group cavoting in the
shallow Washington Monument
reflecting pool—some stripped to
the buff.
"It's too beautiful a day for
anything ugly to happen," said
one girl.
There were reminders Sunday
that not all had gone well:
workmen repaired the glass
broken at two banks and a drug
store in the DuPont Circle area a
mile away that is a favorite
lounging place for the college-age
group; a police blotter that
totaled 264 male and 82 female
misdemeanor bookings that
mostly were wiped clean with $10
collateral and no court
appearances; a handful of jeeps
parked here and there with
soldiers; a policeman hospitalized
with a head injury.
Cleanup Made
On the Ellipse, workmen were
taking down the loudspeaker
stands erected with presidential
permission; green-clad government
employees were picking up bits of
paper and soft-drink cans —and
there weren't a large number at
that.
The sporadic incidents that
caused police to fire tear gas after
the three-hour rally on the Ellipse
also ceased after midnight.
Gone from the White House
area were the 60 city buses that
provided a totally impenetrable
barrier—eventhough one almost
was tipped over. In Lafayette
Park, an off-limits area Saturday,
fewer than 100 people were
gathered in a circle praying for a
cessation of the war.
As the President and his family
participated in a Mother's Day
prayer service in the East Room,
there were dozens of young
people headed out of town
carrying bedrolls and blankets and
waring signs to designate their
hitch hiking destinations: Miami,
New Haven, Syracuse, Philly.
They carried with them the
message that emerged from the
speeches on the Ellipse: to
continue the pressure to get
United States troops out of
Southeast Asia through political
action and tactics like the strike
that closed hundreds of colleges
through the nation last week.
WASHINGTON (AP) - The tens
of thousands of demonstrators
were gone, their litter had
vanished, and around the White
House Sunday was the usual crop
of summer tourists photographing
one another in front of its familiar
facade.
