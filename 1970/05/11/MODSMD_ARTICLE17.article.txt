research, teaching or resident
assistant, if he was informed prior
to accepting that position—either
directly or by public notice—that
holding such position is contingent
upon status as a student.
b. In the sole discretion of the
Dean of Students, where otherwise
undue hardship would result, a
student, although under suspension,
may nevertheless be permitted to
enjoy certain benefits of a student,
such as being permitted to remain in

than one academic quarter except
that a student may be suspended
solely for the remainder of a quarter

primarily on a semester basis, the
word "Quarter" shall be read as
"Semester" insofar as suspension is
concerned.
c. No student who has been
suspended or who has been ordered
suspended in a future quarter shall
be eligible to receive a University
degree until the period of
suspension has terminated.

to pay a fine, he shall be informed
in writing of the time or times by

amounts.
b. Every order to pay a fine shall
be conditioned as follows: The
Dean of Students shall, upon
application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any fine when
in the Dean's judgment it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial
hardship. In no event, however,
shall a University degree be awarded
to any defendant until he has paid
the full amount due.
c. A student who has failed to
pay as ordered shall be treated as if
he had been suspended and shall be
subject to all the disabilities of
Section C until such time as he does
pay.
3. a. Except as provided in
paragraph b. below, fines shall be
paid to the Dean of Students for use
in assisting students who are in need
of financial help.

the Dean of Students for use in
defraying the actual financial losses
of any individual or organization
which losses were directly caused by
the offense for which the fine is
imposed.
E. Payment of a fine by work for an
on-campus facility or organization
1. a. Prior to the imposition of
such a penalty, the judicial body
shall inquire of the defendant
whether or not he has any objection
in principle to penalties requiring
involuntary imposition of work. If
so, an alternative penalty shall be
imposed.
b. No student may obtain a
degree from the University prior to
successful completion of any work
fine imposed upon him.
2. a. Any work fine shall specify
the number of hours to be worked
and set a deadline or deadlines
before which said work is to be
satisfactorily completed.

b. Every work deadline shall be
conditioned as follows: The Dean of
Students shall, upon application by
a defendant, postpone the time that
the work must be completed when,
in the Dean's judgment, it appears
necessary to avoid undue hardship.
In no event, however, shall a
University degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has successfully
completed the work.

meet a deadline shall thereupon be
treated as if he had been suspended
and shall be subject to all the
disabilities of Section C until such
time as he does satisfactorily
complete the work.

imposed without prior agreement of
the person in charge of the facility
where the work is to take place.
b. A written statement from the
person in charge of such facility
that work done by a student was
satisfactorily completed will be
conclusive.
c. In the absence of the
statement in paragraph b. above, the
Dean of Students shall determine if
and when the work has been

student who has contracted with
the University to provide personal
services and who has entered into
performances of the services, shall
not have his contract terminated
unless prior to or at the time he was
formally notified of his
appointment, he was also notified,
either directly or by general
publication of which he had reason
to be aware, that the judicial body
having jurisdiction over him could
impose termination of employment
as a penalty.
3. Under Article I, section F, 3., a
student may be deprived of such
rights and privileges as living in
University housing, using University
machinery, driving a motor vehicle
on campus, and other rights and
privileges of this type.
4. The right or privilege of serving
on any committee shall not be
subject to restriction under Article
I, section F.
G. Probation for a specified period of
time
1. Imposition of a penalty or any
part of a penalty may be postponed
for a specified period of time,
during which a student shall be
placed on probation.
2. A violation of this probation shall

consist of conviction for an offense
which was committed during the
period of probation, unless the
judicial body hearing said offense
specifically deems it to be either
trivial or non-related to the type of
offense for which probation was
granted.
3. A postponed penalty shall be
imposed following a determination
that a probation violation has
occurred.
4. Should no violation of probation
be determined to have occurred
during the period of probation, the
probation shall be terminated and
the postponed penalty shall
automatically be cancelled.
5. The judicial body may impose an
independent penalty for the
subsequent offense itself. In
determining the penalty for the
subsequent offense the judicial
body shall consider the reinstated
penalty for the first offense and its
severity, and may allow the initial
penalty, as reinstated, to suffice for
both offenses, or it may impose
additional penalties.
H. Formal censure
Formal censure shall consist of a
letter of reprimand from the judicial
body to the student, and it shall
explain the reasons for the censure.
The judicial body may request that
the President of the University sign
the letter of censure.
I. Academic penalties in Honor Code
violations
1. An academic penalty may consist
of the whole or partial withdrawal
of credit for a course or an
examination, or the determination
of a grade for a course or an
examination, including the awarding
of a failing grade, or it may consist
of a combination of these penalties.
These penalties may be imposed
only with respect to the course in
which the violation took place.
2. An academic penalty may be
applied only in the case of an Honor
Code violation and only with the
consent of the instructor.
J. Combination of penalties
The judicial body may impose a
sentence combining various
penalties, when it deems such action
appropriate. For example, a penalty
could consist of suspension for a
quarter, plus probation (with
postponement of a penalty of
indefinite suspension) for a
two-year period thereafter, during
which time the student would not
be permitted to live in University
housing.
111. Notification of Penalties
All penalties must be specified in
writing. No penalty becomes effective
until reasonable efforts have been
made to notify the student. In those
instances when a delay in imposition of
the penalty would, in the mind of the
student, be detrimental to him, he may
waive the right to written notice by so
indicating in vr it in g to the judicial
body.

research, teaching or resident
assistant, if he was informed prior
to accepting that position—either
directly or by public notice—that
holding such position is contingent
upon status as a student.
b. In the sole discretion of the
Dean of Students, where otherwise
undue hardship would result, a
student, although under suspension,
may nevertheless be permitted to
enjoy certain benefits of a student,
such as being permitted to remain in

than one academic quarter except
that a student may be suspended
solely for the remainder of a quarter

primarily on a semester basis, the
word "Quarter" shall be read as
"Semester" insofar as suspension is
concerned.
c. No student who has been
suspended or who has been ordered
suspended in a future quarter shall
be eligible to receive a University
degree until the period of
suspension has terminated.

amounts.
b. Every order to pay a fine shall
be conditioned as follows: The
Dean of Students shall, upon
application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any fine when
in the Dean's judgment it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial
hardship. In no event, however,
shall a University degree be awarded
to any defendant until he has paid
the full amount due.
c. A student who has failed to
pay as ordered shall be treated as if
he had been suspended and shall be
subject to all the disabilities of
Section C until such time as he does
pay.
3. a. Except as provided in
paragraph b. below, fines shall be
paid to the Dean of Students for use
in assisting students who are in need
of financial help.

the Dean of Students for use in
defraying the actual financial losses
of any individual or organization
which losses were directly caused by
the offense for which the fine is
imposed.
E. Payment of a fine by work for an
on-campus facility or organization
1. a. Prior to the imposition of
such a penalty, the judicial body
shall inquire of the defendant
whether or not he has any objection
in principle to penalties requiring
involuntary imposition of work. If
so, an alternative penalty shall be
imposed.
b. No student may obtain a
degree from the University prior to
successful completion of any work
fine imposed upon him.
2. a. Any work fine shall specify
the number of hours to be worked
and set a deadline or deadlines
before which said work is to be
satisfactorily completed.

b. Every work deadline shall be
conditioned as follows: The Dean of
Students shall, upon application by
a defendant, postpone the time that
the work must be completed when,
in the Dean's judgment, it appears
necessary to avoid undue hardship.
In no event, however, shall a
University degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has successfully
completed the work.

meet a deadline shall thereupon be
treated as if he had been suspended
and shall be subject to all the
disabilities of Section C until such
time as he does satisfactorily
complete the work.
3. a. No work fine shall be
imposed without prior agreement of
the person in charge of the facility
where the work is to take place.

person in charge of such facility
that work done by a student was
satisfactorily completed will be
conclusive.
c. In the absence of the
statement in paragraph b. above, the
Dean of Students shall determine if
and when the work has been

and privileges
1. Whenever a student is deprived of
a right or privilege, both the specific
right or privilege lost and the period
of such loss must be stated in
writing.
2. Under Article I, section F, 2., a
student who has contracted with
the University to provide personal
services and who has entered into
performances of the services, shall
not have his contract terminated
unless prior to or at the time he was
formally notified of his
appointment, he was also notified,
either directly or by general
publication of which he had reason
to be aware, that the judicial body
having jurisdiction over him could
impose termination of employment
as a penalty.
3. Under Article I, section F, 3., a
student may be deprived of such
rights and privileges as living in
University housing, using University
machinery, driving a motor vehicle
on campus, and other rights and
privileges of this type.
4. The right or privilege of serving
on any committee shall not be
subject to restriction under Article
I, section F.
G. Probation for a specified period of
time
1. Imposition of a penalty or any
part of a penalty may be postponed
for a specified period of time,
during which a student shall be
placed on probation.
2. A violation of this probation shall

consist of conviction for an offense
which was committed during the
period of probation, unless the
judicial body hearing said offense
specifically deems it to be either
trivial or non-related to the type of
offense for which probation was
granted.
3. A postponed penalty shall be
imposed following a determination
that a probation violation has
occurred.
4. Should no violation of probation
be determined to have occurred
during the period of probation, the
probation shall be terminated and
the postponed penalty shall
automatically be cancelled.
5. The judicial body may impose an
independent penalty for the
subsequent offense itself. In
determining the penalty for the
subsequent offense the judicial
body shall consider the reinstated
penalty for the first offense and its
severity, and may allow the initial
penalty, as reinstated, to suffice for
both offenses, or it may impose
additional penalties.
H. Formal censure
Formal censure shall consist of a
letter of reprimand from the judicial
body to the student, and it shall
explain the reasons for the censure.
The judicial body may request that
the President of the University sign
the letter of censure.
I. Academic penalties in Honor Code
violations
1. An academic penalty may consist
of the whole or partial withdrawal
of credit for a course or an
examination, or the determination
of a grade for a course or an
examination, including the awarding
of a failing grade, or it may consist
of a combination of these penalties.
These penalties may be imposed
only with respect to the course in
which the violation took place.
2. An academic penalty may be
applied only in the case of an Honor
Code violation and only with the
consent of the instructor.
J. Combination of penalties
The judicial body may impose a
sentence combining various
penalties, when it deems such action
appropriate. For example, a penalty
could consist of suspension for a
quarter, plus probation (with
postponement of a penalty of
indefinite suspension) for a
two-year period thereafter, during
which time the student would not
be permitted to live in University
housing.
111. Notification of Penalties
All penalties must be specified in
writing. No penalty becomes effective
until reasonable efforts have been
made to notify the student. In those
instances when a delay in imposition of
the penalty would, in the mind of the
student, be detrimental to him, he may
waive the right to written notice by so
indicating in vr it in g to the judicial
body.

A. Expulsion from the University
Expulsion is the permanent
termination of an individual's status
as a student, with the loss of all
rights and privileges appurtenant
thereto.
B. Indefinite suspension from the

appellate body, a subordinate
council, or the Dean of Students)
which originally imposed the
penalty is the only body which may
terminate the suspension; provided,
however, that if the agency which
imposed the penalty no longer
exists, then jurisdiction shall reside
in the SJC; and provided further
that if the penalty is imposed by an
overseas council, the SJC, and only
the SJC, may terminate the
suspension.
4. If the appropriate judicial body
wishes to consider the possible
termination of a suspension, the
Judicial Aide shall investigate and
report the facts.
5. In no event shall an indefinite
suspension be terminated within
two calendar years from the date
the suspension began.
C. Suspension from the University
until a specified date

right to attend classes, utilize library
facilities, utilize any other facilities
of the University except those open
to the general public, obtain credit
for any academic work, engage in

any activities, including holding any
positions whatsoever on any
University committees or in student
organizations whether appointive or
elective, live in student housing, or
in any way represent himself as or
being entitled to the privileges of a
student of Stanford University.
While he is suspended, the student
shall not hold or continue to hold
any position such as, but not
limited to, sponsor, tutor, or
research, teaching or resident
assistant, if he was informed prior
to accepting that position—either
directly or by public notice—that
holding such position is contingent
upon status as a student.
b. In the sole discretion of the
Dean of Students, where otherwise
undue hardship would result, a
student, although under suspension,
may nevertheless be permitted to
enjoy certain benefits of a student,
such as being permitted to remain in
University housing when his
suspension is only for a short period
of ti me.
2. a. No suspension shall be for less
than one academic quarter except
that a student may be suspended
solely for the remainder of a quarter

regularly enrolled in the University
under a program run totally or
primarily on a semester basis, the
word "Quarter" shall be read as
"Semester" insofar as suspension is
concerned.
c. No student who has been
suspended or who has been ordered
suspended in a future quarter shall
be eligible to receive a University
degree until the period of
suspension has terminated.
3. A person under suspension or

amounts.
b. Every order to pay a fine shall
be conditioned as follows: The
Dean of Students shall, upon
application by a defendant,
postpone payment of any fine when
in the Dean's judgment it appears
necessary to avoid undue financial
hardship. In no event, however,
shall a University degree be awarded
to any defendant until he has paid
the full amount due.
c. A student who has failed to
pay as ordered shall be treated as if
he had been suspended and shall be
subject to all the disabilities of
Section C until such time as he does
pay.
3. a. Except as provided in
paragraph b. below, fines shall be
paid to the Dean of Students for use
in assisting students who are in need
of financial help.

the Dean of Students for use in
defraying the actual financial losses
of any individual or organization
which losses were directly caused by
the offense for which the fine is
imposed.
E. Payment of a fine by work for an
on-campus facility or organization
1. a. Prior to the imposition of
such a penalty, the judicial body
shall inquire of the defendant
whether or not he has any objection
in principle to penalties requiring
involuntary imposition of work. If
so, an alternative penalty shall be
imposed.
b. No student may obtain a
degree from the University prior to
successful completion of any work
fine imposed upon him.
2. a. Any work fine shall specify
the number of hours to be worked
and set a deadline or deadlines

satisfactorily completed.

b. Every work deadline shall be
conditioned as follows: The Dean of
Students shall, upon application by
a defendant, postpone the time that
the work must be completed when,
in the Dean's judgment, it appears
necessary to avoid undue hardship.
In no event, however, shall a
University degree be awarded to any
defendant until he has successfully
completed the work.

meet a deadline shall thereupon be
treated as if he had been suspended
and shall be subject to all the
disabilities of Section C until such
time as he does satisfactorily
complete the work.
3. a. No work fine shall be
imposed without prior agreement of
the person in charge of the facility
where the work is to take place.

person in charge of such facility
that work done by a student was

conclusive.
c. In the absence of the
statement in paragraph b. above, the
