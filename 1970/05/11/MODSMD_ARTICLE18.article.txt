# Decrease Seen For DOD Research
## 
### DICK BUXTON 
Direct financial support at
many universities for research and
for higher education including
Department of Defense (DOD)
contracted research will probably
continue decreasing during the
next fev- years according to the
office of the Vice-President of
Research.
William Miller, Vice-president
for Research, says that forces are
at work to try and reverse the
trend but that future decisions are
uncertain. Miller indicates that
money going directly into basic
scientific research at universities is
decreasing in primarily three
ways. Fellowship programs
supporting graduate researchers
are decreasing, various direct
support programs to universities
and individuals have decreased

and the NASA university
-sustaining support is to be
eliminated.
DOD Research
According to Research
Administrator Earl Cilley, the
DOD budget last year for research
and development projects was $8
billion of which about $350
million was allocated nationally to
universities.
Department of Defense
sponsored projects awarded at
Stanford last year were for $9.8
million, down $3 million from
1968. A total of $15 million was
reimbursed to the University in
1969, including money for the
new projects any payment for
research on carry over projects
contracted in previous years.
Miller says that elimination of
DOD research would cause a
heavy impact on individuals. He

estimates that there are 97
principal investigators, 445
associate faculty and students and
260 staff personnel presently
associated with 134 DOD
contracts who would suffer.
Amendment Effects
The frequently discussed
Mansfield Amendment relating to
DOD spending was passed last
December to cover DOD research
spending in fiscal year 1970 but
does not appear 011 bills relating
to DOD research spending for
fiscal year 1971. The amendment,
however, required that the DOD
not authorize funds for research
appropriations unless those funds
had a direct relationship to a
specific military function or
operation.
Though some projects such as
study in high-energy physics
which can be funded through

agencies like the AEC were
withdrawn from DOD
consideration, Cilley says that
war-related research is difficult to
define and that DOD argued that
all the research it was sponsoring
was related to defense missions.
Basic research is investigation
which seeks to explore problems
but without the intention of
finding specific results, whereas
applied research seeks to explore
specific questions seeking specific
answers.
Classified And Unclassified
In April 1969 there were 13
research contracts at Stanford
considered classified and now two
classified contracts are formally
still on the books. Miller reports
that though not formally expired,
the work on one contract has
been completed and the other
contract terminates on August 31,
1970. Otherwise, all research at
Stanford is unclassified according
to the university research policy
approved last year. This means
that all research and results are
available *0 the public with no
restrictions.
Commenting on DOD contracts
at Stanford Cilley says, "In my
view because it (DOD research) is
pretty fundamental stuff" it
doesn't have an effect on the war
in Southeast Asia.
In addition, he says the $15
million reimbursed to DOD but
last year is small money to the
Stanford large money to the
university.
Opinion Affects Research
Miller says that public and
congressional opinion has had an
effect on the allocation of
research funds in that many
people are opposed to government
money going to institutions which
they see as sheltering "dissidents."
Cilley adds that there is an
increasing antipathy for research
and for supporting higher
education.
President Nixon's message on
higher education this year stressed

moving toward loans by
government to finance graduate
study. Miller syas that NDEA
(National Defense Education Act)
fellowships which are supporting
about 3000 graduate students
nationally this year will aid half
that number next year and
according to present proposals
there will be no new NDEA
fellowships the following year.
New Research Areas
Despite the trend in basic
science research cutbacks, Miller
says that new research directions
are opening up where money will
be appropriated. Such developing
areas include studies on the
environment, earthquake studies
health care education, and urban
affairs research in areas such as
community government and
housing.
This trend, Miller says, reflects
the combining of research
techniques of the basic sciences to
specific problems in order to seek
practical answers which can be
implemented.
Fiscal year 1971 is the first
year the Nixon administration has
had a real impact on the budget
since major portions of the U.S.
budget are designated as far as
two years in advance of their use.
In the current fiscal year 1970
the national budget for academic
research went down by four
percent over the previous year.
Next year (1971) this research
budget will go up eight percent.
This is a two percent a year
increase which, Miller says,
doesn't meet the cost of living rise
and consequently does not meet
the rise in the cost of research.
Thus, an actual decrease in federal
funds available to support
research has resulted.
