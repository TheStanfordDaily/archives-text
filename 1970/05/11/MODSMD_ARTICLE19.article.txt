# Four Hearings To Examine Dissent Comission Role
## 
### 
The following is a statement by
Dr. Herant Katchadourian
concerning the nature and
procedure of the university's
commission on campus dissent, of
which he is chairman. Subsequent
statements and announcements
concerning the commission's
activities will be printed in the
Daily.
To members of the Stanford
community:
On April 28, at President
Pitzer's request, I convened a
study group to consider the
creation of a Commission that
might conduct a full examination
of the subject of dissent on the
Stanford campus. On May 1, I
announced the membership of the
study group, and invited all
members of the University
community to aid us in our work.
I also announced that, in order to
receive the views of all interested
persons, we would hold four
public meetings between May 11
and May 22; and that the study
group, and each of its members,
would welcome private, written or
oral communications from any
member of the campus
community at any time during the
first three weeks of May.
We recognize that these are
trying and distracting times, and
that other matters of grave and
immediate concern are pressing
for everyone's attention.
However, we do hope that
members of the community will
find time to give us the benefit of
their views on the subject of our
task. As we see it, this involves the
resolution of four questions:
(1) Should a Commission be
established to study the questions
raised by campus protest,
including its possible causes,
appropriate limits, and the
appropriate response of the
University to conduct that
exceeds these limits?
(2* If such a Commission

should be established, what
should be its precise mandate?
What subjects should be on its
agenda? What should be the scope
of its concerns?
(3) What should be the
composition of such a
Commission? How should its
members be selected?
(4) What, in broad outline,
should be the Commission's
method of procedure? Within
what period of time would it
complete its work? To what
bodies within the University
-should it turn for the
implementation of its
recommendations?
We invite the views of all
interested persons on each of
these questions. During the
coming two weeks, members of
our study group will continue to
solicit ideas and reactions from
persons on campus. In addition,
we want to hear from anyone who
has anything he wants to say to us
concerning these subjects. Written
communications may be
addressed to the University
Ombudsman, Building 600 T. The
members of the study group may
be visited in person or phoned at
the Following numbers:
Professor Anthony Amsterdam:
Ext. 3553/3554
Professor Wolfgang Panofsky:
854-3300 Ext. 2601
Mr. John Grube: Ext.
4331/2291
Mr. Craig Schindler: Ext. 3628
Dr. Herant Katchadourian: Ext.
3628
We have scheduled four public
meetings, as follows:
1) Wednesday, May 13: to
consider whether a Commission
should be established. Forum
Room, Meyer Undergrad, Library.
2) Friday, May 15: to consider
the mandate of such a
Commission. Tresidder Large
Lounge.
3) Wednesday", May 20: to
consider the composition and
membership of such a
Commission Forum Room, Meyer
Undergrad. Library.
4) Friday, May 22: to consider
the methods of proceeding of
such a Commission, including its
timetable and problems of
implementation of its work
Forum Room, Meyer Undergrad.
Library.
Each meeting will be held
between 8 :00 and 10:30 p.m. The
first two hours of each will be
devoted to presentations by
persons who have reserved a spot
on the agenda by the methods
described in the following
paragraph. The last half hour of
each meeting will be open for
general discussion. The purpose of
these meetings is to inform the
study group of the views of all

persons who would want to
present them in the format of an
open meeting. The study group
will not, itself, deliberate the
issues or reach any conclusions
concerning them during the
course of the meetings. At this
stage, our only object is to
become as well informed as
possible.
Each person who wishes to
speak at a meeting can request ten
minutes on the agenda by
submitting in writing, by 3:00
p.m. on the date of that meeting,
a request to speak together with a
written summary, outline, or text
of his remarks. This should be
submitted to the University
Ombudsman, Building 600 T.
Speakers should plan to limit their
presentations to six or seven
minutes, so as to leave a few
minutes for questions bv members
of the study group. If there are
more requests for speaking time
than can be accommodated within
a period of two hours, speakers
will be placed on the agenda by
the study group, in light of their
written submissions, so as to
permit the presentation of a range
of views; and the study group will
consider the holding of additional
public meetings to accommodate
additional speakers.
In order to focus the attention
of all persons in the University
community who may wish to
communicate their views to us
privately or at the four scheduled
public meetings, we have
formulated a tentative conception
of the role of the Commission
whose establishment we are
considering. This is the product of
our initial thoughtsâ€”a mere first
sketch of the possible mandate of
the Commission. One of our
major tasks, as we said above, is to
define the Commission's mandate,
if we conclude that the
establishment of such a
Commission is warranted. That
final job of definition must await
your suggestions and our further
reflection. What we offer at this
time is designed to stimulate, and
not to limit, the views of all
persons in the University
community concerning the
Commission and its role.
Our tentative description,
captioned "Preliminary Statement
About the Possible Role of the
Commission," will appear in
tomorrow's DAILY. In its light,
we earnestly invite all interested
persons to make known to us
their views concerning any of the
questions described above, either
by private communications to
individual members of our study
group or by attendance at its four
public meetings.
