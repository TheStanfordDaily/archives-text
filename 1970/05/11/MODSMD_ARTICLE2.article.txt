# Several Departments Agree To New Course Suggestions
## 
### 
Initial departmental response to
President Kenneth Pitzer's request
for "flexibility" in dealing with
academics this quarter varies
although all departments
contacted have agreed to his
initial requests.
Some departments held
meetings over the weekend and
others have scheduled meetings
today. Most departments have
encouraged students to attend the
first class meeting of this week or
to contact the individual teacher
to make arrangements for
completing class work.
On Thursday Pitzer suggested
that faculty members be "free to
make new arrangements as to
schedules and requirements" and
that incompletes be granted
automatically, that the pass-fail
option be applied more liberally,
and that the date for dropping
courses be changed to the first
day of finals.
The faculty Senate backed
Pitzer in encouraging "broad
options during the remainder of
the Spring Quarter."
Pass-Fail Question
The biggest question remaining
seems to be the question of
pass-fail grades. Some
departments have said that they
would allow unlimited pass-fail
grading this quarter with courses
taken pass-fail counting toward
fulfillment of major requirements.
Other departments have made no
announcement.
The Classics Department
Coordinating Committee has

called for a meeting tomorrow
afternoon in the Classics
Department building of
representatives from all
departments in the University.
They hope to devise a
University-wide coordination of
different proposals for cotninuing
academic work.
Bob Grant, of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, said
yesterday that "Students may
now apply for: 1. unlimited
pass-fails, unlimited incompletes,
and the dropping of courses until
the day before finals." He added,
"If anyone has difficulties
obtaining these changes in their
program, they should call the
ASSU Council of Presidents of the
Omsbudsman, Mr. Herant
Katchadourian."
