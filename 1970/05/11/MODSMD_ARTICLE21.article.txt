# Roundup: Strike Slows Down Sports
## 
### 
What was scheduled to be one
of the busier weekends for
Stanford athletics didn't coma off
that way as the student strike
forced a number of cancellations.
The tennis team didn't play
Washington and California and a
sometimes reliable source reports
that the Indians forfeited that
Washington match, but that fact
hasn't been confirmed.
The golf team didn't face San
Jose State and the Pac-8 track
relays were cancelled.
A few events went on anyway.
The baseball team travelled to
Washington and split four games,
beating the Huskies twice after
losing a pair to Washington State.
Stanford's crew won the annual
"Big Race"—and the Jim
Reynolds Cup—as the varsity shell
wiped out an early Cal lead and
won by three lengths, 6:49
compared to the Bears* 7:01.
Cal came back to win the JV
race by half a second, but
Stanford was declared winner of
the Reynolds Cup—which goes to
the victor of two of three
races—when the Cal frosh refused
to row out of sympathy for the
Cambodian war protest and
student strike.
And while the lacrosse team
destroyed Oregon 19-5 on this
campus, the football team was
holding the first of two intrasquad
scrimmages in the Stadium. In
front of a less than capacity
crowd the White team bested the
Reds 26-19 as 400 high school
coaches looked on enviously.
