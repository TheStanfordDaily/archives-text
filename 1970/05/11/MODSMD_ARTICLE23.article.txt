## Playoff Hopes Fade 
### 
Once upon a time there was a
great myth about how the
California schools in the Pac-8
baseball league were so superior to
the four Northern schools. The
followers of the myth were
greatly dismayed before this
season started because of the new
league alignment and round-robin
playoff system which meant that
the "inferior" Northern teams
would be in the playoffs instead
of the last two finishers among
the California teams.

But alas out of nowhere come
the mighty Stanford Indians to
destroy the nasty myth.
Yes, those very same Indians
that were ranked second
nationally earlier this year in the
past two weekends have done a
lot to build up the image of
Northwest baseball. The Cards
started their eight game series
against the Northern Division still
in the middle of the title race. But
after dumping Oregon twice on
May Day, Stanford started a slide

which all but ends any playoff
hopes.
Just a week ago Oregon State
visited Sunken Diamond and
walked off with two victories over
the shocked Cards. And then last
Friday the Cards extended their
league losing streak to four
straight with two shutout losses to
Washington State, 3-0 and 7-0.
As the Cards' batsmen were
being baffled by three WSU
pitchers, the Cougars were
pounding Stanford's two aces,
Steve Dunning and Phil Keller. In
the first game Steve Evert and
Manny Perez hit home runs off
Dunning.
Then in the rain-shortened
nightcap the Cougars pounded out
seven consecutive hits in the fifth
and final inning to win handily.
Saturday Stanford finally got
back on the winning trail by
besting hapless Washington twice,
7-0 and 8-4. The victories were
convincing, but just a bit late. The
Tribe will return home with a 7-8
league record with only two
games remaining, both against
California.
The Indians are not
mathematically eliminated yet
from finishing second and gaining
a playoff berth, but the chances
are slim indeed.
