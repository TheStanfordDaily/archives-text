The Stanford Committee for
Community Action, which has
organized canvassing activities in
the local area in response to
Nixon's ordering troops into
Cambodia, reports that
community support has been
overwhelming.
The activities of the Committee
have resulted in the sending of
over 500 telegrams, 1000
postcards and 1500 letters to
senators, congressmen and the
President. In addition, over 8000
signatures have been collected on
a petition to be sent to President
Nixon, through Senator
McGovern.
The Community activities
continue to be effective as more
people become interested in
stopping the war and changing
Nixon's policies.
The Committee was formed last
Monday afternoon, after a
conversation in the Business
School lounge. Other activities
besides canvassing include the
organization of a speaker's forum
and the promotion of better
relations between the citizens in

the surrounding area and the
students at Stanford.

include distributing information
about Southeast Asia, and
changing the opinions in the
community of how Stanford
students express dissent. The
Committee has organized an
office in Barrister's Eating Club
and all operations are directed
from this headquarters.
Lines of communication have
been set up between the
Committee and various: other
organizations, including the
Political Science Department, the
East Asian Studies Department,

as possible, eventually entrusting

organizations in the community.

forum will certainly continue on a
permanent basis, as the response
has been so encouraging.
