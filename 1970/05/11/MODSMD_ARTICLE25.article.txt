# A 						Sharp Football Scrimage
## 
### 
With an unspring-like breeze
persistently blowing through some
86,000 empty seats, Stanford's
"white" football squad scored a
26-19 victory over its "red"
adversary in the season's first
full-dress intrasquad scrimmage
Saturday afternoon.
What that means is that the
first string offense scored one
more touchdown against the
first team defense than the second
string offense scored against the
second string defense.
And if that doesn't make any

sense to you, don't worry about
it.
But the handful of students and
the 400-odd northern California
high school coaches (each replete
with golf slacks, cardigan and
wingtips) who bothered to show
up saw some impressive football.
Jim Plunkett, looking as good
or perhaps better than usual,
connected on 13 of 19 passes for
215 yards—all in one half—and
moved his team 80 yards for a
score the first time out.
He also provided the
afternoon's major moment of

concern when, on a broken play
that ended the first half, he got
belted solidly after releasing a pass
and had the wind bumped out of
him.
But nothing more serious than
that.
Jack Lasater and Randy Vataha
were Plunkett's main targets. Each
receiver pulled in five catches, and
Vataha was particularly adept at
coming out of crowds of
defenders to make his receptions.
Lasater sat out almost all the
second half, as a shoulder he
injured in rugby snapped out of
joint and spent the remainder of
the afternoon in a sling.
But Jack reports that it isn't
serious—he'll. be playing again in
the second full scrimmage next
Saturday—and that a minor
operation will solve the problem.
But even with Plunkett sitting
out the second half the
quarterbacking was still pretty
good. Jesse Freitas, Ted

Bieymaier, Mike Boryla and Tim
Cordial all got their chances, and
all came out throwing.
Bieymaier pulled off the
afternoon's longest play with a 71
yard touchdown pass to Reggie
Sanderson who was wide open all
the way; Boryla went nine for 23
and Cordial hit three of five.
Sophomore back Barr Curry
was the leading ground gainer
with 56 yards, and Jackie Brown
contributed some expert running.
Eric Cross picked his way through
flying bodies for 22 yards on a
nifty draw play, but, with a total
of 56 passes thrown, Stanford's
offense is clearly aerially oriented.
The afternoon was also graced
by a surprise visit of 18 rag-tag
band members and two stray
dollies.
"Wow, this is almost as boring
as a track meet—but not quite,"
said a trombonist. The music,
using that term loosely, wasn't
much help.

nothing to do with the scrimmage held Saturday, but rather with a practice held

unforseen last minute conflict prevented its publication.

persistently blowing through some
86,000 empty seats, Stanford's
"white" football squad scored a
26-19 victory over its "red"
adversary in the season's first
full-dress intrasquad scrimmage
Saturday afternoon.
What that means is that the
first string offense scored one
more touchdown against the
first team defense than the second
string offense scored against the
second string defense.
And if that doesn't make any

sense to you, don't worry about
it.
But the handful of students and
the 400-odd northern California
high school coaches (each replete
with golf slacks, cardigan and
wingtips) who bothered to show
up saw some impressive football.
Jim Plunkett, looking as good
or perhaps better than usual,
connected on 13 of 19 passes for
215 yards—all in one half—and
moved his team 80 yards for a
score the first time out.
He also provided the
afternoon's major moment of

concern when, on a broken play
that ended the first half, he got
belted solidly after releasing a pass
and had the wind bumped out of
him.
But nothing more serious than
that.
Jack Lasater and Randy Vataha
were Plunkett's main targets. Each
receiver pulled in five catches, and
Vataha was particularly adept at
coming out of crowds of
defenders to make his receptions.
Lasater sat out almost all the
second half, as a shoulder he
injured in rugby snapped out of
joint and spent the remainder of
the afternoon in a sling.
But Jack reports that it isn't
serious—he'll. be playing again in
the second full scrimmage next
Saturday—and that a minor
operation will solve the problem.
But even with Plunkett sitting
out the second half the
quarterbacking was still pretty
good. Jesse Freitas, Ted

Bieymaier, Mike Boryla and Tim
Cordial all got their chances, and
all came out throwing.
Bieymaier pulled off the
afternoon's longest play with a 71
yard touchdown pass to Reggie
Sanderson who was wide open all
the way; Boryla went nine for 23
and Cordial hit three of five.
Sophomore back Barr Curry
was the leading ground gainer
with 56 yards, and Jackie Brown
contributed some expert running.
Eric Cross picked his way through
flying bodies for 22 yards on a
nifty draw play, but, with a total
of 56 passes thrown, Stanford's
offense is clearly aerially oriented.
The afternoon was also graced
by a surprise visit of 18 rag-tag
band members and two stray
dollies.
"Wow, this is almost as boring
as a track meet—but not quite,"
said a trombonist. The music,
using that term loosely, wasn't
much help.


PICTURE—'Hiis particular genuine, bona-fide, authentic football picture has
nothing to do with the scrimmage held Saturday, but rather with a practice held

last week. We had intended to run a picture off Saturday's game, but an
unforseen last minute conflict prevented its publication.
