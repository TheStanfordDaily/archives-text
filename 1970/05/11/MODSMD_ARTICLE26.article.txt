Adam Levin, ASSU Council of
Presidents member, appeared
Friday night on ABC television to
comment on President Nixon's
Cambodian policy address last
week. Appearing on the same
program was Sen. Harold E.
Hughes (D-Ala.).
An ex-Council of Presidents
member, Barry Askinas, appeared
last night on NBC's "House
Divided" to discuss the current
campus situation.
Levin's appearance marked the
first time that a student has
commented on a Presidential
speech on nationwide television.
"Nixon's speech is not any
conciliation," Levin, a political
moderate, said. "What's going on
in the country today is not a
reaction to the universities.
Moderates, students, people on
the right and left are getting
together and have reached a point
of maximum frustration."
Sen. Hughes, a co-sponsor of
the H a t 112 ie 1 d - M cG overn

amendment to limit funds
supporting troops in Southeast
Asia, supported Levin's analysis of
the situation.
In a nationwide hookup, 15
students, academic and
government leaders discussed
aspects of today's crisis on the
university and throughout the
nation.
"Youth has lost its confidence
in the Establishment and in
government," Askinas said.
They're looking for something
constructive to do, but the kids
want to do something now. If
they can't find anything
constructive to do, they 11 do
something destructive."
"I'm frightened of [Vice
President Sprio T.] Agnew,"
Askinas said. He referred to him as
a "demagogue."
