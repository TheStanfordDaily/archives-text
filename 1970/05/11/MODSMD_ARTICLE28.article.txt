# Draft Card Turn-In
## 
### 
A national group to organize
draft card turn-ins has developed
I as an outgrowth of last week's
student strike.
The Union for National Draft
Opposition (UNDO) is working
out of Princeton, where massive
plans are being developed for the
weeks ahead. To date, almost
10,000 cards have been turned in
across the country.
Stanford's group, working with
the Institute for Non-Violence,
has scheduled a noon meeting
today to collect cards and explain
the consequences of that act. At
Friday's rally in White Plaza, more
than 30 registration cards and 30
classification cards were turned in
by Stanford protesters.
Draft age men, women with a
stake in those men, and any
interested students are urged to
attend. Booths will be set up
elsewhere on campus where men
can turn in their cards.

Universities throughout the
state are organizing to collect
unwanted draft cards. Berkeley,
the regional co-ordinating center,
has received over 2000 cards since
last Wednesday. Schools like USC,
UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz, and
Humboldt State have fledgling
groups on their campuses.
The draft card turn-in is not
connected with petitions
circulating last week in which the
signees declared their intent to
refuse induction if the United
States becomes militarily involved
in a Cambodian Civil war.
Those petitions garnered over
400 signatures in a 48-hour period
last Tuesday and Wednesday.
An organizer of this particular
movement noted that 400 was a
large number especially
considering the loose organization
of the group and haphazard
method of spreading the petitions.

Both the petitions and the draft
cards will probably be sent tc
Washington. An organizer made it
clear that turning in a draft card is
tantamount to sending it directly
back to a local draft board.
So some men may be
prosecuted for failing to comply
with the federal drift laws.
