# Conveys â€˜Sense Of Urgency'
## Delegation Meets Leaders 
### LESLIE CAMPBELL RALPH KOSTANT 
Members of the Stanford
Student-faculty delegation to
Washington feel, with some
exceptions, that they succeeded in
communicating a sense of urgency
to the nation's political leaders.
But evaluating the
accomplishments of the
delegation will be difficult; for, as
University Ombudsman Herant
Katchadourian said, "any effect
you actually made on any of these
men was invisible."
The entourage, the first such
delegation to arrive at thecapitol,
sought to convey the campus

reaction to the Cambodian
invasion. Members spoke with
Congressmen and officials in the
Nixon Administration during their
hectic two-day stay.
Among others, they consulted
with Henry Kissinger', the
president's chief advisor on
foreign affairs; Paul Erlichman,
Kissinger's counterpart on
domestic matters; Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare
Robert Finch, and Senators
Edward ' Kennedy, George
McGovern, Alan Cranston and
Charles Percy.
Members of the delegation
entertain few hopes of influencing
foreign policy. Professor St. Clair

Drake said of Kissinger, "I had the
feeling that he was listening, but
that his mind was made up about
the correctness of his policy."
Nevertheless, there were some
indications of success. Senator
Alan Cranston reported a visit by
a delegation of students did
wonders in "stiffening the
backbone" of a Republican
senator who had been wavering on
the Cambodia issue.
Finch's comment on
Vice-President Agnew's attack on
minority admissions led some to
believe that the Third World
contingent convinced the
Secretary of the injustice of
Agnew's words.
An Important Note
Drake added, "I felt that the
presence of the Third World group
interjected a note that was
important and tends to be
obscured, namely the racist
implications of the war."
John Grube, member of last
year's ASSU Council of Presidents
pointed out the value of having
Young Republican leader Don
Ayer speak out against the
President's policy. "Don was
probably one of the most
effective members of our
delegation," he said.
"Engineering faculty, who are
expected to be conservative, had
the same advantage," Grube
added. "I think it really impressed
the listener when they mentioned
that their school was shut down."
Commenting on the overall
importance of the trip, Drake said

"I think the significance of the
whole event lies in the willingness
of officials to accept us, listen to
us, and discuss matters that
concerned us.
Wanted To Listen
Ayer stated, "I got the
impression that they wanted to
listen to us."
Dave Edwards, of the Black
Student Union, had a more
pessimistic response. He said the
Third World contingent came
back "demoralized and
discouraged." He explained, "I
think this trip did absolutely
nothing. It was fundamentally a
white boy's trip."
Before they left, Carl Vasquez
from MECHA stated that the
Third World delegates would "be
there to speak for ourselves, even
though we are going to represent
Stanford." Representatives
explained the Third World group
didn't go to Washington to change
any minds, but to present a Third
World perspective on the war to
the Administration, Congressmen,
Senators and the press.
"The Washington trip was news
and a good chance for publicity,"
said Neal Okabayashi, who was
also impressed with the great
sense of brotherhood and
solidarity among the Third World
delegates.
Faith In The System
"The white students were
opposing the war on the grounds
that people are losing faith in the
American system and that their
universities are being burned
down," blazed Okayabashi.
Louis Islas insisted that "we're
worried about saving lives, not
universities" and that it is
ridiculous to worry about
restoring faith "because faith is
already gone completely . . . this
system is corrupt."
He described Kennedy and
Cranston as sympathetic; but
"behind their tears they were
merely saying vote for me and
other like me," "They just didn't
understand that we've been
fucked over for too long and that
the whole voting system won't
work for us," Islas said.
"People in Washington operate
in a vacuum," said Okayabashi, "I

had an overwhelming feeling that
this world is being run by a few
isolated, rational, intellignet mad
men."
The delegation was composed
of faculty members chosen by the
faculty Committee on
Committees,members of the
present and past ASSU councils of
presidents, students chosen by the
ASSU Committee on
Nominations, and representatives
of the BSU, MECHA, the
Asian-American Student Alliance
and one of the four native
American students on campus.
A meeting of all the members
of the Stanford delegation has
been set for 9:30 tonight in Grove
lounge.

any minds, but to present a Third
World perspective on the war to
the Administration, Congressmen,
Senators and the press.
"The Washington trip was news
and a good chance for publicity,"
said Neal Okabayashi, who was
also impressed with the great
sense of brotherhood and
solidarity among the Third World
delegates.
Faith In The System
"The white students were
opposing the war on the grounds
that people are losing faith in the
American system and that their
universities are being burned
down," blazed Okayabashi.
Louis Islas insisted that "we're
worried about saving lives, not
universities" and that it is
ridiculous to worry about
restoring faith "because faith is
already gone completely . . . this
system is corrupt."
He described Kennedy and
Cranston as sympathetic; but
"behind their tears they were
merely saying vote for me and
other like me," "They just didn't
understand that we've been
fucked over for too long and that
the whole voting system won't
work for us," Islas said.
"People in Washington operate
in a vacuum," said Okayabashi, "I

had an overwhelming feeling that
this world is being run by a few
isolated, rational, intellignet mad
men."
The delegation was composed
of faculty members chosen by the
faculty Committee on
Committees,members of the
present and past ASSU councils of
presidents, students chosen by the
ASSU Committee on
Nominations, and representatives
of the BSU, MECHA, the
Asian-American Student Alliance
and one of the four native
American students on campus.
A meeting of all the members
of the Stanford delegation has
been set for 9:30 tonight in Grove
lounge.
Members of the Stanford
Student-faculty delegation to
Washington feel, with some
exceptions, that they succeeded in
communicating a sense of urgency
to the nation's political leaders.
But evaluating the
accomplishments of the
delegation will be difficult; for, as
University Ombudsman Herant
Katchadourian said, "any effect
you actually made on any of these
men was invisible."
The entourage, the first such
delegation to arrive at thecapitol,
sought to convey the campus

reaction to the Cambodian
invasion. Members spoke with
Congressmen and officials in the
Nixon Administration during their
hectic two-day stay.
Among others, they consulted
with Henry Kissinger', the
president's chief advisor on
foreign affairs; Paul Erlichman,
Kissinger's counterpart on
domestic matters; Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare
Robert Finch, and Senators
Edward ' Kennedy, George
McGovern, Alan Cranston and
Charles Percy.
Members of the delegation
entertain few hopes of influencing
foreign policy. Professor St. Clair

Drake said of Kissinger, "I had the
feeling that he was listening, but
that his mind was made up about
the correctness of his policy."
Nevertheless, there were some
indications of success. Senator
Alan Cranston reported a visit by
a delegation of students did
wonders in "stiffening the
backbone" of a Republican
senator who had been wavering on
the Cambodia issue.
Finch's comment on
Vice-President Agnew's attack on
minority admissions led some to
believe that the Third World
contingent convinced the
Secretary of the injustice of
Agnew's words.
An Important Note
Drake added, "I felt that the
presence of the Third World group
interjected a note that was
important and tends to be
obscured, namely the racist
implications of the war."
John Grube, member of last
year's ASSU Council of Presidents
pointed out the value of having
Young Republican leader Don
Ayer speak out against the
President's policy. "Don was
probably one of the most
effective members of our
delegation," he said.
"Engineering faculty, who are
expected to be conservative, had
the same advantage," Grube
added. "I think it really impressed
the listener when they mentioned
that their school was shut down."
Commenting on the overall
importance of the trip, Drake said

"I think the significance of the
whole event lies in the willingness
of officials to accept us, listen to
us, and discuss matters that
concerned us.
Wanted To Listen
Ayer stated, "I got the
impression that they wanted to
listen to us."
Dave Edwards, of the Black
Student Union, had a more
pessimistic response. He said the
Third World contingent came
back "demoralized and
discouraged." He explained, "I
think this trip did absolutely
nothing. It was fundamentally a
white boy's trip."
Before they left, Carl Vasquez
from MECHA stated that the
Third World delegates would "be
there to speak for ourselves, even
though we are going to represent
Stanford." Representatives
explained the Third World group
didn't go to Washington to change
any minds, but to present a Third
World perspective on the war to
the Administration, Congressmen,
Senators and the press.
