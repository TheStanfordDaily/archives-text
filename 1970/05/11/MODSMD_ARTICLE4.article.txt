# Strike Continues After Quiet Days
## 
### 
All was quiet this weekend as
the campus took advantage of the
three-day break declared by
President Pitzer to recuperate
from the effects of a week of
strike activities and to make plans
for future actions.
The highlight of the extended
weekend was a noon rally Friday
in White Plaza, at which a large
majority of the 1000 persons
present voted to continue the
strike because "the demands have
not been met."
The meeting began as the
crowd listened dispassionately as

Ira Sandperl and Joan Baez, wife
of former Stanford Student Body
President David Harris, spoke
briefly on non-violence and urged
the male members of the crowd to
turn in their draft cards. About 33
actual draft cards were collected,
along with assorted bits of
Selective Service System
paraphernalia.
The vote to continue the strike
came after an impassioned speech
by an Oriental research fellow at
the medical school. "Heart disease
is a number one killer in our
country," he said, "but it kills

nowhere near the number of
people killed and disabled in
Southeast Asia!"
The doctor got a standing
ovation when he added, "To say
my research is so important it
should not be set aside at a time
like this is bullshit."
In addition to voting to
continue the strike, the meeting
also voted to move all future
teach-ins outdoors to re-inforce
the picket lines.
Further implementation of the
strike for this week was left for
Sunday's co-ordinating committee
meeting, and, when the chairman
announced that it was raining
(which it wasn't) most of those
remaining left.
The Sunday meeting heard
reports from the various
departments and from a group of
students who had spoken to
university financial officers (See
related story on page 4).
It was then decided that
today's strike actions should focus
on the Electronics and
Engineering labs, and a call was
sent out for strike groups to meet
at the lab complex behind the
physics tank at 6:00 this morning.
Groups will also meet at the same
time at Encina and the ROTC
building.
Tentative plans were also laid
for a demonstration at Tuesday's
Board of Trustees meeting in San
Francisco, and for a campaign to
get as many people as possible at
Saturday's Armed Forces Day
celebration at Fort Ord.
