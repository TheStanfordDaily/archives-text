# Trustees Meet Today
## 
### 
The Trustees meet in San
Francisco today and tomorrow in
their regularly scheduled meeting.
The meeting was moved from
campus to San Francisco because
of recent events on campus.
The Academic Affairs and
Finance Committees met in joint
session to consider the voting of
General Motors stock proxies for
a series of Ralph Nader
consumer-orientated proposals.
A special subcommittee meets
tomorrow morning to consider a
recommendation on the general
policy on stock proxies and the
University voting them in a way
considering social concerns and
the specific proposal about the
GM proposals.
The Trustees are expected to
quiz University administrators
about recent events on campus.
Last week the Palo Alto Times
reported a rumor that the
Trustees might try to fire
President Pitzer. No Trustees
contacted would confirm or deny
the rumor.

William F. Miller, Vice
President for Research, will meet
with interested students and
faculty tonight at 7:30 in
Tresidder to discuss University
research.
Miller will especially be
concerned with opportunities for
funding to support research
efforts in new directions and the
University's response to these
potential funding resources.
