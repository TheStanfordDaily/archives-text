# Lyman Says Offices Must Be Kept Open

### BILL FREIVOGEL 
"Stanford in all its branches
cannot remain open at all if it is
partially shut at . . . crucial
places," Provost Richard Lyman
told a KZSU radio audience last
night.
The Provost emphasized that
the University is financially
vulnerable to the kind of coercive
pickets that have closed Encina
Hall, the ROTC building and some
of the electronics laboratories
during the past week.
A large portion of his remarks
were addressed to more moderate
strikers. He said: "Let everyone
understand that if we do nothing
it lies within the power of a small
number to close the University
entirely ... It lies within the
power of the great majority to
prevent any such drastic result."
The Provost maintained that
the difference between last week's
coercive and non-coercive
picketing "reflects the differences
in purpose among those
supporting the strike."
Vocal Minority
"A small but need I say vocal
minority," he continued, "wishes to
shut the University down
completely, as a demonstration of
power and as the prelude to a
revolutionary upheaval in tl e
United States. They are perfectly
content to have others in the

movement dream of a partial
closure or redirection of the
University's activities," he added.
Shortly after Lyman
completed his speech last night,
the strike steering committee
issued a statement condemning as
an "outright lie" the Provost's
accusation that some in the
movement want to shut the
University. (See page 2 for the
committee's statement.)
The strike leaders claimed,
"The strike community is united
in its desire to keep the university
open while re-directing its
priorities. The administration's
intent is clear: destroy the strike
by turning various strike groups
against each other."
Financial Consequences
Much of Lyman's speech
detailed the extent and
consequences of University
dependence on governmental and
Department of Defense (DOD)
research funds.
Lyman noted that nearly half
of the University's daily payroll of
$265,000 is funded either directly
or indirectly by the government.
He also said that $35,000 of this
governmental funding results from
DOD contracts.
"A few moments of reflection
upon those figures," he
concluded, "should show how
vital to the University's
continuing to function is the
continued functioning of the
Applied Electronics and Hansen
labs. The government money
simply stops coming in if the
work stops."
Strikers' Statement
The strikers' statement
complained that Lyman's
description of the University's
financial dependence ignored the
fact that "moneys arrive quarterly
or monthly, and the offices in
Encina that disburse this money
to workers have been left open by
the strike."
Still, Lyman claimed, "If
Encina is partially closed, other,
(non-governmental) sources of
funds are cut off. Therefore, in
order to find the funds with
which to pay salaries and wages
and fellowships and scholarships,
Stanford would have to carry out
such drastic economies as to make
impossible its continuing
operation."
