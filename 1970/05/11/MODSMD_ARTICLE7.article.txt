## Crash Kills Reuther 
### 
PELLSTON, Mich. - Walter P.
Reuther, one of the most
powerful figures in organized
labor who served as president of
the United Auto Workers, was
killed late Saturday night in the
crash of a leased executive jet near
here.
A Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman

spokesman said five other persons,
including Reuther's wife, were
killed when the leased Lear
executive jet missed the funway
of Emmet County airport and
crashed about three miles away.
The area, near the western tip
of Michigan's lower peninsula, is
noted for affluent summer homes,
particularly along Like Michigan
beaches, and a number of
prominent persons from Chicago
and Detroit have cottages in the
area.
Reuther recently won
reelection to a 13th term as
president of the UAW at Atlantic
City, N.J. The labor leader was
preparing for negotiations with
Detroit's major automakers this
fall.
Reuther, 62, spent 45 years on
the U.S. labor scene and is
credited with being the first labor
leader to seek a profitsharing plan
as part of a contract, the first to
fight for a cost-of-living escalator,
and the first to win a contract
with a guaranteed minimum wage.
