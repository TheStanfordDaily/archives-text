# Fall Break
## 
### 
A proposal to give college
students time off to participate in
political campaigns next fall
received support yesterday from
major officials at Princeton, Yale,
and Notre Dame.
In addition, Chancellor Albert
Bowker of New York City's Board
of Higher Education said he will
recommend a two-week period of
free time before next November's
elections so the students can play
an active role.
