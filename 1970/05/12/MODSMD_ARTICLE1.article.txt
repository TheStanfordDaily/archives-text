## Four Shot In Riots 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - Police
reported four persons were shot
to death and more than 20 were
wounded here early Tuesday in
widespread racial violence marked
by burning and looting.
Police said all four of the dead
were shot as roving bands of
Negroes looted stores and burned
businesses in an area covering an
estimated 130 square blocks on
the fringe of the downtown
business section.
There was no immediate
information, however, on whether
the dead, all Negro males, were
shot by police or by sniper fire.
Police Chief Broadus Bequest
declined to speculate.
According to authorities at
least 50 fires had been reported,
half of them described as major.
Some still burned out of control
in the early morning hours.
Gov. Lester Maddox ordered
200 National Guardsmen and 1 40
state troopers to duty Monday
night.
Maddox said he acted after
receiving a formal request from
Augusta Mayor Millard Beckum.
The disturbance erupted after
several hundred Negroes,
protesting the beating death of a

black youth in Richmond County
jail, staged a march through the
downtown area.
The city's main ambulance
service company was refusing to
answer calls because of sniper fire.
News vehicles and police cars also
were being fired upon.
Shortly before midnight the
first contingent of state troopers,
ordered into the city by Gov.
Lester Maddox, began arriving.
Mayor Millard Beckum ordered a
citywide curfew in effect from
midnight until 8 a.m.
Maddox has ordered 200
National Guardsmen and 140
state troopers into Augusta to
help police contain the violence
away from the main business
section.
Kent State
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
photograph copyrighted by Life
Magazine taken about the time
Ohio National Guardsmen fired
on Kent State University students
May 4 shows one guardsman,
apparently an officer, aiming a
pistol toward the students.
An Ohio National Guard
official in Columbus said Monday

that there is no indication that
any weapons but the Ml rifles
carried by enlisted men were fired
in the incident which killed four
students and wounded nine
others.
The man aiming the pistol is in
front of the guard units which did
the firing. It could not be
determined from the photograph
whether the pistol also was fired.
'The guardsman, of medium build,
is holding the weapon in his left
hand and is in a crouched
position.
Only National Guard officers
carried pistols at Kent. The pistols
were .45 caliber.
"No 45s were fired there to
our knowledge," Lt. Col. John
Spain, public information officer
in the guard's Columbus
headquarters, said in a telephone
interview. "But only the officers
had those weapons."
Pro-US Rally
NEW YORK (AP) â€” An estimated
2,000 workmen left docks and
derricks Monday for another
demonstration in downtown
Manhattan, scene of a bitter clash
last week with antiwar protesters.
This time there were almost as
many police as marchers, and
violence was sharply curtailed.
Police reported four arrests,
three dor disorderly conduct and
one for assault on a detective.
"USA all the way," cried
construction workers in hard hats
and longshoremen from the piers
as they marched beneath
American flags. A number of men
and women from the white collar
community joined them.
Ticker tape drifted down on a
rally of the counterdemonstrators
at Wall Street, and they were
cheered and applauded.
Others concentrated on City
Hall, shouting, "Impeach
Lindsay ..." Lindsay has voiced
antiwar seniments.
Lindsay had ordered an
investigation into reports that
police made little or no attempt
to control construction workers
during last Friday's rampage at
Wall Street and City Hall.
Antiwar demonstrators were
set upon outside the New York
Stock Exchange.
