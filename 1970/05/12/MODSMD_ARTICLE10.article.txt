# Staff Ostracism
## Workers Blast University Strike Stand 
### Connie Hill 
Last week, the Administration
granted at least tacit assent to
students and v faculty choosing to
normal classes and
participate in the strike. Its
attitude toward the working staff,
however, has been noncommittal
and has reinforced the Staff's
[feeling of ostracism from the
[ "Stanford community."
On Wednesday, May 6, Robert
SNelson, Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations, addressed a
memo to staff members, many of
whom were confused about the
.risks they would run by
{participating in the strike.
Nelson's memo did nothing to
their confusion. He
"suggested only that each staff
-member and his supervisor agree
' to a "reasonable" amount of time
.during which the worker, if he
I * wished, could participate in
teach-ins and other strike
activities. In practice, this policy
left the worker subject to the will
•of his supervisor: a lenient
.supervisor might allow his workers
-to participate as much as they

wished with impunity; a
supervisor who opposed the strike
could effectively prevent or
penalize a worker who chose to
participate.
Because this situation was
intolerable to most employees, a
group called "Stanford Workers
Against the War" met Wednesday
and drafted a set of demands:
"that the Administration make a
clear statement to the effect that
employees may participate in
political and educational action
without loss of pay, sick-leave,
vacation time, or threat of
dismissal" and "that the payroll
of workers paid on an hourly basis
be given priority for processing to
that those who are most in need
[i.e., those filling the lowest paid
jobs: gardeners, custodians, etc.,
many of whom are black, chicano,
oriental or Portuguese J will not
be penalized." These demands
were presented to students and
faculty at the mass meeting
Wednesday night and were
incorporated into the resolution
of that body.

On Thursday, the Stanford
Workers Against the War and its
student supporters marched twice
to President Pitzer's office. At
10:00 Mr. Nelson met them
promising that Pitzer would speak
with the people at 12:00.
At noon the President and his
advisers did appear before a group
of approximately 200 people in a
session which was about as
productive as the 10:00 meeting.
Pitzer merely repeated Mr.
Nelson's "solution" to the
problem of worker participation
in the strike.
One of his statements, however,
did clarify the Administration's
attitude toward the strike and
toward the employees. Pitzer
assured the group that an
employee who wishes to work but
is prevented from entering his job
by strikers blocking the entrance
will receive his normal pay
anyway. However, a worker who
voluntarily absents himself from
his job to participate in the strike
will not be paid. That is to say
that whether one performs his

normal working activities is not
the decisive factor: the worker's
volition is.
Paychecks Docked
Workers who oppose the strike
by continuing business as usual
will not be penalized; workers
who support the strike will have
their paychecks docked. Pitzer
w.s asked more than once if
faculty members who do not hold
normal classes during the strike
will suffer economic sanctions; he
refused to give a clear answer.
If in fact the faculty can
participate without loss of pay
and students without immediate
loss of units, it is obvious that the
employees are being discriminated
against. It would seem that the
Administration does not credit
the working people with political
consciousness. At the 12:00
meeting, in fact, Pitzer alluded to
his fear that if workers were
allowed to absent themselves from
their jobs with out suffering
economic penalties, everyone
would take off for the beach.
It is equally obvious that what
Pitzer is really afraid of is the
potential power of the employees.
They are the only people who
could literally close down the
university. Without the librarians,
secretaries in administrative
offices, mail deliverers, cooks,
custodians and the others,
Stanford could not function. At
this date, there is no wide-based
labor union at Stanford.
White Collar Union
The Union of Stanford
Employees with 300 members
(out of 7000 employees total at
Stanford), is made up mostly of
white collar workers. This is true
also of Stanford Workers Against
the War. Because the Staff is not a
unified force at this university but
a body divided between white
collar and manual workers, it has
been unable to utilize its potential
power to defend itself from
discriminations that exclude it
from the "Stanford community."
On Thursday afternoon, Robert
Nelson met with eight elected
representatives from Stanford
Workers Against the War to revise
a i» new memo directed to
department heads and supervisors.
They new memo does not meet
the employees' demand for a clear
statement of administration
policy. It only suggests that
"reasonable" time off during the
strike might be from 1-2 hours per

day, but that this is a question
which must be decided by the
supervisor and staff member.
The statement is insufficient
also in that it affects only those
employees paid directly by the
university: it does not apply to
workers paid through research
contracts and grants. Thus it fails
to offer any guidance to a large
number of employees, including
those custodians supplied by
American Building Maintenance,
workers at the Bookstore, at
SLAC, and at the hospital. w
