# 'Mismanaging The Newsâ€™
## Radicals Demand Daily Shift 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
During these recent weeks of
crisis the Stanford Daily has been
mismanaging the news. The Daily,
like Pitzer and Nixon seems to be
hoping to ride out the rebellion
rather than trying to change itself
to meet the needs of the people
(Stanford community and others).
Why the Daily continues with
business as usual, printing news
off the AP teletype in a little box
marked for national news can best
be understood by noting that the
Daily and many other elements of
the community think that we are
striking with the university rather
than against it.
As radicals we have time and
again pointed out how and why
Stanford is ruled by the all
powerful Board of Trustees,
representatives of the ruling class
of big industrialists. These men
need Stanford to perpetuate the
war and the war machine. It is
they who are supporting the war
effort and who have said ROTC
will stav at any cost. It is they
who the WALL STREET
JOURNAL is referring to as the
inner core of the government with
more power than the cabinet or
Congress. This strike by Stanford
students and faculty (without the
vast majority of workers who have
been intimidated by their bosses
into continuing work) is for and
with the community but it is
against the Stanford owners, the
Trustees; it is against their right to
govern the U.S. and against their
right to govern our community.
We must shut Stanford down tight
so that the workers at Stanford,
who are not even free to unionize,
will be liberated from the yoke of
the Trustees. Then we must go
out into the larger community of
workers.
In order to make this possible
we make the following demands
of the Stanford Daily :

1. That the Daily change its
format into one compatible with a
community strike newspaper,
covering international and
national news not to be found in
the censored AP releases. It
should for example include full
coverage of the national rising
strike. Liberation News Service,
College Press Service, Strike
Central, etc.
2. That the Daily print enough
copies so that students may go
out into the community and
distribute the truth in
competition with the fanaticisms
of the P. A. Times.
3. That the Daily print
prominently the position paper or
article submitted by the Stanford
Workers against the War. (which
has apparently been censored up
or neglected to this time).
4. That the Daily publicly
support the right of all workers,
university or otherwise, to
unionize and strike for decent
wages and conditions.
5. That the Daily print the
article on local police terrorism
which was submitted last week by
members of the radical caucus.
The radical caucus intends to
serve the needs of the people and
therefore we intend to see these
reasonable democratic demands
met.
The Radical Caucus

In response to these demands,
the Daily staff would like to point
out several of the more salient
errors in the radical argument.
First, the Daily has run no AP
coverage of the strike except for a
short note on Tricia Nixon's
dismay that most students don't
trust the government. We chose to
rely on the Brandeis national
information center, the local
strike committee's own sources,
help from erstwhile liberals at the
Pacific Studies Center, and

countless phone calls made on our
own. Our strike stories may lack
the polemics and fervor that the
radical critics demand, but we
think that the facts of the
national strike speak out much
more clearly any change in
format.
Second, the Daily would like
nothing better than to compete
with the I'alo Alto Tinier, but
obviously our resources don't
permit us to "distribute the
truth" on an equal footing with
Bodi. In addition the Daily is
$8000 in debt from costs incurred
last year. Our business manager
has refused to allow expanded
press-runs in an attempt to break
even this year.
Third, the only article
submitted by the "Stanford
Workers Against the War" appears
elsewhere on this page. This
article came in too late for
Monday's edition and was thus
scheduled for today's paper. The
Daily staff wishes to assure the
radicals that any alleged earlier
articles were probably mislaid out
of innate incompetence rather
than conscious censorship.
Four, the Daily has covered the
attempts by the University staff
to organize in a number of stories
printed during the fall and winter.
We support the right of anyone to
join freely such an association. To
militate against the increasing
cooptation of student radicalism
by "stomach question" trade
unionism, may we recommend the
Industrial Workers of the World as
a union with a consistently radical
past and present.
Fifth, the article on police
terrorism was received late last
week, and due to its length has
been held until more space is
available on the editorial page.
Incidently the story appeared
yesterday in the Free You's
special strike edition.

In response to these demands,
the Daily staff would like to point
out several of the more salient
errors in the radical argument.
First, the Daily has run no AP
coverage of the strike except for a
short note on Tricia Nixon's
dismay that most students don't
trust the government. We chose to
rely on the Brandeis national
information center, the local
strike committee's own sources,
help from erstwhile liberals at the
Pacific Studies Center, and

countless phone calls made on our
own. Our strike stories may lack
the polemics and fervor that the
radical critics demand, but we
think that the facts of the
national strike speak out much
more clearly any change in
format.
Second, the Daily would like
nothing better than to compete
with the I'alo Alto Tinier, but
obviously our resources don't
permit us to "distribute the
truth" on an equal footing with
Bodi. In addition the Daily is
$8000 in debt from costs incurred
last year. Our business manager
has refused to allow expanded
press-runs in an attempt to break
even this year.
Third, the only article
submitted by the "Stanford
Workers Against the War" appears
elsewhere on this page. This
article came in too late for
Monday's edition and was thus
scheduled for today's paper. The
Daily staff wishes to assure the
radicals that any alleged earlier
articles were probably mislaid out
of innate incompetence rather
than conscious censorship.
Four, the Daily has covered the
attempts by the University staff
to organize in a number of stories
printed during the fall and winter.
We support the right of anyone to
join freely such an association. To
militate against the increasing
cooptation of student radicalism
by "stomach question" trade
unionism, may we recommend the
Industrial Workers of the World as
a union with a consistently radical
past and present.
Fifth, the article on police
terrorism was received late last
week, and due to its length has
been held until more space is
available on the editorial page.
Incidently the story appeared
yesterday in the Free You's
special strike edition.
Editor, The Daily:
During these recent weeks of
crisis the Stanford Daily has been
mismanaging the news. The Daily,
like Pitzer and Nixon seems to be
hoping to ride out the rebellion
rather than trying to change itself
to meet the needs of the people
(Stanford community and others).
Why the Daily continues with
business as usual, printing news
off the AP teletype in a little box
marked for national news can best
be understood by noting that the
Daily and many other elements of
the community think that we are
striking with the university rather
than against it.
As radicals we have time and
again pointed out how and why
Stanford is ruled by the all
powerful Board of Trustees,
representatives of the ruling class
of big industrialists. These men
need Stanford to perpetuate the
war and the war machine. It is
they who are supporting the war
effort and who have said ROTC
will stav at any cost. It is they
who the WALL STREET
JOURNAL is referring to as the
inner core of the government with
more power than the cabinet or
Congress. This strike by Stanford
students and faculty (without the
vast majority of workers who have
been intimidated by their bosses
into continuing work) is for and
with the community but it is
against the Stanford owners, the
Trustees; it is against their right to
govern the U.S. and against their
right to govern our community.
We must shut Stanford down tight
so that the workers at Stanford,
who are not even free to unionize,
will be liberated from the yoke of
the Trustees. Then we must go
out into the larger community of
workers.
In order to make this possible
we make the following demands
of the Stanford Daily :

1. That the Daily change its
format into one compatible with a
community strike newspaper,
covering international and
national news not to be found in
the censored AP releases. It
should for example include full
coverage of the national rising
strike. Liberation News Service,
College Press Service, Strike
Central, etc.
2. That the Daily print enough
copies so that students may go
out into the community and
distribute the truth in
competition with the fanaticisms
of the P. A. Times.
3. That the Daily print
prominently the position paper or

Daily staff wishes to assure the
radicals that any alleged earlier
articles were probably mislaid out
of innate incompetence rather

Four, the Daily has covered the
attempts by the University staff
to organize in a number of stories

We support the right of anyone to
join freely such an association. To
militate against the increasing
cooptation of student radicalism
by "stomach question" trade
unionism, may we recommend the
Industrial Workers of the World as
a union with a consistently radical
past and present.
Fifth, the article on police
terrorism was received late last
week, and due to its length has
been held until more space is
available on the editorial page.
Incidently the story appeared
yesterday in the Free You's
special strike edition.
