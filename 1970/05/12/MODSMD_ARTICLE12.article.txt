# Radicals Smothered
## Strike Cooptation 
### 
~ BSI I'osilioii

We recognize the strike as
having revolutionary potential.
But we also see that this
revolutionary potential has been
coopted by liberals and moderates
who have succeeded in ending
confrontation. We as black people
learned after the 1963 march on
Washington that such vehicles are
of limited political value. But it
appears that after two
Moratoriums, and the most recent
march on Washington in response
to the American invasion of
Cambodia, young whites have not
yet progressed to the same
conclusion.
We must point out here that
the moderates and liberals were
unwilling to join until Pitzer,
through Professor Zimbardo,
coopted the movement by
legitimizing the strike. His so
doing is a clear indication that he
saw it as the lesser of two evils
and more in line with his interests.
When however, he decides it is in
his interests to open the school,
will you take it upon yourself to
continue and build the strike, not
only in the University, but in the
community? Will you try to
convince white working people to
forget their racism and join you in
fighting against a racist
government? You must remember
that it was violence that made
even this strike possible, because
only when the moderates saw
their school being torn down did
they rise up and smother the
actions of the radicals with a
non-violent 'strike'. (Ronald
Reagan is for this kind of strike.)
This movement based on
outrage at being left out by the
President of the United States, as
though he ever included you in his
decision-making process. The
intense reaction to Nixon's
invasion of Cambodia indicates
that the anti-war movement had
faith that Nixon was "coming
around". The logic of invading
Cambodia is the same logic used
to invade Vietnam, Cuba, and
Congo, and the Dominican
Republic. And the same logic that
will be used to invade Laos,
Thailand, Trinidad or wherever
non-white people are struggling
for national liberation. Having
been victimized by this society for
400 years, we as black people
were not surprised to find that the
great white father speaks with a '
forked tongue.
During the Civil War 186,000 '
black men fought because they !
had been convinced that a victory !
for the North meant liberation for :
black people. As this country j
enters a civil war of a different j
nature, history tells us to be j
extremely cautious in casting our
lot. We as black people must begin r
beyond the romantic ideologies of
the so-called white radical. You
speak of solidarity, but we saw
the news from New York last

Friday. That was the white
proletariat revealing itself for
what we have always known it
was, the most racist and fascistic
force in this country. What are
you prepared to do about
that?— You did nothing in Chicago
last summer when construction
workers attacked blacks who were
demanding to be admitted to the
union.
Many have wondered why
black and other non-white peoples
in North America have not arisen
with you to protest this latest
outrage against humanity. We
view your so-called voluntary
strike as a family squabble
between you, your fathers, and
the patriarch of the white
american family Richard
Mealymouth Nixon. You have
responded to the napalming of
100's of 1000's of non-white
Asians by throwing a temper
tantrum as if suddenly discovering
that your father was a liar, a
racist, and a murderer; after he
had told you that he represented
the best humanity had to offer.
And so as is your habit when
denied a promise previously made,
when tricked by the biggest
trickster white culture has ever
produced, you have decided to
throw a tantrum
Never mind that it is
imperialism, the greed of United
States big business and abject
racism which is at fault. You are
outraged and therefore throwing a
rock at a window should

somehow cause Rockefeller to
have a sudden heart attack and
fall dead. You are outraged and
therefore to really do the system
in you seek to turn the slaves and
niggers loose on a trembling white
society. Never mind that our
people have been dying before
Vietnam and continue to walk the
streets of America numb and
disfigured by oppression. Never
mind that whether we go to
Vietnam or greet the troops at the
city gates, we are the ones whose
deaths do not seem to outrage
you in the manner which you
demonstrate today. You marched
in outrage when four crackers
died at the hands of some Ohio
plough boys defending their
country against the red attack.
But where was your outrage when
the South Carolina Highway
Patrol brutally shot-gunned black
students of Orangeburg for trying
to integrate a bowling alley? Four
deaths. But there was no talk of
stopping "business as usual".
When troops came home, how
many of you will rise up in arms
to guarantee housing, jobs, and
power for black people.
Yet when the shit starts to fly
we are always the ones called
upon to "save the republic". Well,
fuck the republic, and the people
for which it stands. And until you
decide to do that, black people
can only say: FUCK YOU.

We recognize the strike as
having revolutionary potential.
But we also see that this
revolutionary potential has been
coopted by liberals and moderates
who have succeeded in ending
confrontation. We as black people
learned after the 1963 march on
Washington that such vehicles are
of limited political value. But it
appears that after two
Moratoriums, and the most recent
march on Washington in response
to the American invasion of
Cambodia, young whites have not
yet progressed to the same
conclusion.
We must point out here that
the moderates and liberals were
unwilling to join until Pitzer,
through Professor Zimbardo,
coopted the movement by
legitimizing the strike. His so
doing is a clear indication that he
saw it as the lesser of two evils
and more in line with his interests.
When however, he decides it is in
his interests to open the school,
will you take it upon yourself to
continue and build the strike, not
only in the University, but in the
community? Will you try to
convince white working people to
forget their racism and join you in
fighting against a racist
government? You must remember
that it was violence that made
even this strike possible, because
only when the moderates saw
their school being torn down did
they rise up and smother the
actions of the radicals with a
non-violent 'strike'. (Ronald
Reagan is for this kind of strike.)
This movement based on
outrage at being left out by the
President of the United States, as
though he ever included you in his
decision-making process. The
intense reaction to Nixon's
invasion of Cambodia indicates
that the anti-war movement had
faith that Nixon was "coming
around". The logic of invading
Cambodia is the same logic used
to invade Vietnam, Cuba, and
Congo, and the Dominican
Republic. And the same logic that
will be used to invade Laos,
Thailand, Trinidad or wherever
non-white people are struggling
for national liberation. Having
been victimized by this society for
400 years, we as black people
were not surprised to find that the
great white father speaks with a '
forked tongue.
During the Civil War 186,000 '
black men fought because they !
had been convinced that a victory !
for the North meant liberation for :
black people. As this country j
enters a civil war of a different j
nature, history tells us to be j
extremely cautious in casting our
lot. We as black people must begin r
beyond the romantic ideologies of
the so-called white radical. You
speak of solidarity, but we saw
the news from New York last

Friday. That was the white
proletariat revealing itself for
what we have always known it
was, the most racist and fascistic
force in this country. What are
you prepared to do about
that?— You did nothing in Chicago
last summer when construction
workers attacked blacks who were
demanding to be admitted to the
union.
Many have wondered why
black and other non-white peoples
in North America have not arisen
with you to protest this latest
outrage against humanity. We
view your so-called voluntary
strike as a family squabble
between you, your fathers, and
the patriarch of the white
american family Richard
Mealymouth Nixon. You have
responded to the napalming of
100's of 1000's of non-white
Asians by throwing a temper
tantrum as if suddenly discovering
that your father was a liar, a
racist, and a murderer; after he
had told you that he represented
the best humanity had to offer.
And so as is your habit when
denied a promise previously made,
when tricked by the biggest
trickster white culture has ever
produced, you have decided to
throw a tantrum
Never mind that it is
imperialism, the greed of United
States big business and abject
racism which is at fault. You are
outraged and therefore throwing a
rock at a window should

somehow cause Rockefeller to
have a sudden heart attack and
fall dead. You are outraged and
therefore to really do the system
in you seek to turn the slaves and
niggers loose on a trembling white
society. Never mind that our
people have been dying before
Vietnam and continue to walk the
streets of America numb and
disfigured by oppression. Never
mind that whether we go to
Vietnam or greet the troops at the
city gates, we are the ones whose
deaths do not seem to outrage
you in the manner which you
demonstrate today. You marched
in outrage when four crackers
died at the hands of some Ohio
plough boys defending their
country against the red attack.
But where was your outrage when
the South Carolina Highway
Patrol brutally shot-gunned black
students of Orangeburg for trying
to integrate a bowling alley? Four
deaths. But there was no talk of
stopping "business as usual".
When troops came home, how
many of you will rise up in arms
to guarantee housing, jobs, and
power for black people.
Yet when the shit starts to fly
we are always the ones called
upon to "save the republic". Well,
fuck the republic, and the people
for which it stands. And until you
decide to do that, black people
can only say: FUCK YOU.

We recognize the strike as
having revolutionary potential.
But we also see that this
revolutionary potential has been
coopted by liberals and moderates
who have succeeded in ending
confrontation. We as black people
learned after the 1963 march on
Washington that such vehicles are
of limited political value. But it
appears that after two
Moratoriums, and the most recent
march on Washington in response
to the American invasion of
Cambodia, young whites have not
yet progressed to the same
conclusion.
We must point out here that
the moderates and liberals were
unwilling to join until Pitzer,
through Professor Zimbardo,
coopted the movement by
legitimizing the strike. His so
doing is a clear indication that he
saw it as the lesser of two evils
and more in line with his interests.
When however, he decides it is in
his interests to open the school,
will you take it upon yourself to
continue and build the strike, not
only in the University, but in the
community? Will you try to
convince white working people to
forget their racism and join you in
fighting against a racist
government? You must remember
that it was violence that made
even this strike possible, because
only when the moderates saw
their school being torn down did
they rise up and smother the
actions of the radicals with a
non-violent 'strike'. (Ronald
Reagan is for this kind of strike.)
This movement based on
outrage at being left out by the
President of the United States, as
though he ever included you in his
decision-making process. The
intense reaction to Nixon's
invasion of Cambodia indicates
that the anti-war movement had
faith that Nixon was "coming
around". The logic of invading
Cambodia is the same logic used
to invade Vietnam, Cuba, and
Congo, and the Dominican
Republic. And the same logic that
will be used to invade Laos,
Thailand, Trinidad or wherever
non-white people are struggling
for national liberation. Having
been victimized by this society for
400 years, we as black people
were not surprised to find that the
great white father speaks with a '
forked tongue.
During the Civil War 186,000 '
black men fought because they !
had been convinced that a victory !
for the North meant liberation for :
black people. As this country j
enters a civil war of a different j
nature, history tells us to be j
extremely cautious in casting our
lot. We as black people must begin r
beyond the romantic ideologies of
the so-called white radical. You
speak of solidarity, but we saw
the news from New York last

Friday. That was the white
proletariat revealing itself for
what we have always known it
was, the most racist and fascistic
force in this country. What are
you prepared to do about
that?— You did nothing in Chicago
last summer when construction
workers attacked blacks who were
demanding to be admitted to the
union.
Many have wondered why
black and other non-white peoples
in North America have not arisen
with you to protest this latest
outrage against humanity. We
view your so-called voluntary
strike as a family squabble
between you, your fathers, and
the patriarch of the white
american family Richard
Mealymouth Nixon. You have
responded to the napalming of
100's of 1000's of non-white
Asians by throwing a temper
tantrum as if suddenly discovering
that your father was a liar, a
racist, and a murderer; after he
had told you that he represented
the best humanity had to offer.
And so as is your habit when
denied a promise previously made,
when tricked by the biggest
trickster white culture has ever
produced, you have decided to
throw a tantrum
Never mind that it is
imperialism, the greed of United
States big business and abject
racism which is at fault. You are
outraged and therefore throwing a
rock at a window should

somehow cause Rockefeller to
have a sudden heart attack and
fall dead. You are outraged and
therefore to really do the system
in you seek to turn the slaves and
niggers loose on a trembling white
society. Never mind that our
people have been dying before
Vietnam and continue to walk the
streets of America numb and
disfigured by oppression. Never
mind that whether we go to
Vietnam or greet the troops at the
city gates, we are the ones whose
deaths do not seem to outrage
you in the manner which you
demonstrate today. You marched
in outrage when four crackers
died at the hands of some Ohio
plough boys defending their
country against the red attack.
But where was your outrage when
the South Carolina Highway
Patrol brutally shot-gunned black
students of Orangeburg for trying
to integrate a bowling alley? Four
deaths. But there was no talk of
stopping "business as usual".
When troops came home, how
many of you will rise up in arms
to guarantee housing, jobs, and
power for black people.
Yet when the shit starts to fly
we are always the ones called
upon to "save the republic". Well,
fuck the republic, and the people
for which it stands. And until you
decide to do that, black people
can only say: FUCK YOU.
