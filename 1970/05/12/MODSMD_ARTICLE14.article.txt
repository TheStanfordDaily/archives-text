## Students Talk To Alums 
### TOM GIVEN 
"I'm not sending my son to
that fucking, fucking war," yelled
the actress.
It may have been the alcohol
talking, but then again, maybe
not. Even in the plush precincts of
Pacific Palisades, people were
debating the war in Indochina.
Most of the guests at the party
were rich, white, and liberal; in a
sense, they were a preview of the
Stanford student body years from
now.
Alumni React
Indeed, four or five were
Stanford alumni. Two had just
hosted another party, not to make
merry, but to discuss the war on
campus and the war abroad.
The guests of honor were
Stanford students, in Los Angeles
under the auspices of the Stanford
Alumni Association. In calm,
quiet tones, they had discussed
the reorientation of the schools
and the redirection of the war to a
group of alumni and friends.
Headed by Josh Cooperman,

the group of student alumni
associates was one of many that
have fanned out across the
country to talk with alumni.
According to Sarah Norton of the
Alumni Association, "people have
already gone as far as
Chicago . . . close to 180 people,
including regular students, are
planning to contact alumni
groups."
Impressions
The alumni appeared
impressed. One, Mr. John Stern,
president-elect of the Westside
Alumni Club, said, "those kids
were great. They can trust some
of us older people, and I'm glad
they tried."
His wife echoed the sentiments,
"We're going to give some more
issue-oriented parties this summer,
and I hope the students will be
able to come again. They were
really great."
Another alumnus had just
returned from Palo Alto. "I took
my son up to see the
campus . . . so, someone broke a

few windows there, it's not all
that bad. I've seen worse, believe
me."
Taking Stands
All the alumns respected
students willing to take a stand.
Said one, "I thought I was a
heroine in 1945, when someone
called and asked about 'our
colored problem' and I told her
'we have no colored problem
madam' .. . then hung up the
phone. You kids are doing what
we should have done, you've
opened all our eyes to what's
going on in the world."
Open or not, all eyes were on
the two students at the evening
party. Most of the adults present
were eager to talk, to find out
how the Cambodian intervention
touched off a national strike.
Whether their alma mater was
Stanford or Texas A & M, most of
the adults at the evening party
were eager to talk with a student.
"I just don't know what's going
on," said an Angeleno
businessman. "You read the
TIMES, and they don't seem to be
covering the whole thing . . . boy,
this has been the most critical
week I think I've ever seen."
This Is Something'
Said another, "I didn't think
this was anything in particular
until I called my daughter Ann in
Berkeley and she said, 'Daddy,
I'm on strike.' She hasn't ever
been involved in anything, not
even People's Park, so I know this
is REALLY something."
Several reflected with pride
that their sons and daughters were
leafletting, picketing, or
obstructing traffic at schools such
as Santa Cruz, University of
Arizona, or UCLA.
Others weren't so enthused.
"My daughter just barely got out
of the administration building in
time, out at Santa Barbara," said a
lawyer, "and I told her, if she gets
arrested, I won't help her. It's her
own business, none of mine."
Fears
Behind the confident faces, a
number of persons expressed their
fears.


STUDENT HANDS have played a prominent part in many off ROTC-strike demonstrations the last few weeks. Here a band j
plays for politics in front of the Old Union.
"It's the anarchists, the ones
who want to destroy the whole
system, that frighten me," noted a
bearded doctor. Others agreed
with him, for they did have
something to lose. The swimming
pools, Porsches, and charge
accounts may be in danger, and
some of the more conservative
partygoers were tninking of them
as well as of their children and the
kids killed at Kent State.
As one liberal housewife aptly
put it, "I'm caught in the middle.
People tell me to write my
congressman, but he's too
conservative. Who can I work for
this year? I worked for Kennedy,
but I won't work for Brown or
Unruh. I'll vote for both of them,
but that's it. When Yorty wins, I'll
have to choose between him and
Reagan, and you know who 111
vote for—Reagan. What a
screwed-up state this is."
She's planning some anti-war
coffees in Brentwood with the aid
of the UCLA speaker's bureau,
but doesn't know what it will
accomplish.
Like the rest of Middle
America, she's caught in the
middle, and as the crisis deepens,
she remains confused.

were rich, white, and liberal; in a
sense, they were a preview of the
Stanford student body years from
now.
Alumni React
Indeed, four or five were
Stanford alumni. Two had just
hosted another party, not to make
merry, but to discuss the war on
campus and the war abroad.
The guests of honor were
Stanford students, in Los Angeles
under the auspices of the Stanford
Alumni Association. In calm,
quiet tones, they had discussed
the reorientation of the schools
and the redirection of the war to a
group of alumni and friends.
Headed by Josh Cooperman,

the group of student alumni
associates was one of many that
have fanned out across the
country to talk with alumni.
According to Sarah Norton of the
Alumni Association, "people have
already gone as far as
Chicago . . . close to 180 people,
including regular students, are
planning to contact alumni
groups."
Impressions
The alumni appeared
impressed. One, Mr. John Stern,
president-elect of the Westside
Alumni Club, said, "those kids
were great. They can trust some
of us older people, and I'm glad
they tried."
His wife echoed the sentiments,
"We're going to give some more
issue-oriented parties this summer,
and I hope the students will be
able to come again. They were
really great."
Another alumnus had just
returned from Palo Alto. "I took
my son up to see the
campus . . . so, someone broke a

few windows there, it's not all
that bad. I've seen worse, believe
me."
Taking Stands
All the alumns respected
students willing to take a stand.
Said one, "I thought I was a
heroine in 1945, when someone
called and asked about 'our
colored problem' and I told her
'we have no colored problem
madam' .. . then hung up the
phone. You kids are doing what
we should have done, you've
opened all our eyes to what's
going on in the world."
Open or not, all eyes were on
the two students at the evening
party. Most of the adults present
were eager to talk, to find out
how the Cambodian intervention
touched off a national strike.
Whether their alma mater was
Stanford or Texas A & M, most of
the adults at the evening party
were eager to talk with a student.
"I just don't know what's going
on," said an Angeleno
businessman. "You read the
TIMES, and they don't seem to be
covering the whole thing . . . boy,
this has been the most critical
week I think I've ever seen."
This Is Something'
Said another, "I didn't think
this was anything in particular
until I called my daughter Ann in
Berkeley and she said, 'Daddy,
I'm on strike.' She hasn't ever
been involved in anything, not
even People's Park, so I know this
is REALLY something."
Several reflected with pride
that their sons and daughters were
leafletting, picketing, or
obstructing traffic at schools such
as Santa Cruz, University of
Arizona, or UCLA.
Others weren't so enthused.
"My daughter just barely got out
of the administration building in
time, out at Santa Barbara," said a
lawyer, "and I told her, if she gets
arrested, I won't help her. It's her
own business, none of mine."
Fears
Behind the confident faces, a
number of persons expressed their
fears.


STUDENT HANDS have played a prominent part in many off ROTC-strike demonstrations the last few weeks. Here a band j
plays for politics in front of the Old Union.
"It's the anarchists, the ones
who want to destroy the whole
system, that frighten me," noted a
bearded doctor. Others agreed
with him, for they did have
something to lose. The swimming
pools, Porsches, and charge
accounts may be in danger, and
some of the more conservative
partygoers were tninking of them
as well as of their children and the
kids killed at Kent State.
As one liberal housewife aptly
put it, "I'm caught in the middle.
People tell me to write my
congressman, but he's too
conservative. Who can I work for
this year? I worked for Kennedy,
but I won't work for Brown or
Unruh. I'll vote for both of them,
but that's it. When Yorty wins, I'll
have to choose between him and
Reagan, and you know who 111
vote for—Reagan. What a
screwed-up state this is."
She's planning some anti-war
coffees in Brentwood with the aid
of the UCLA speaker's bureau,
but doesn't know what it will
accomplish.
Like the rest of Middle
America, she's caught in the
middle, and as the crisis deepens,
she remains confused.
"I'm not sending my son to
that fucking, fucking war," yelled
the actress.
It may have been the alcohol
talking, but then again, maybe
not. Even in the plush precincts of
Pacific Palisades, people were
debating the war in Indochina.

Stanford students, in Los Angeles
under the auspices of the Stanford
Alumni Association. In calm,
quiet tones, they had discussed
the reorientation of the schools
and the redirection of the war to a
group of alumni and friends.
Headed by Josh Cooperman,

the group of student alumni
associates was one of many that
have fanned out across the
country to talk with alumni.
According to Sarah Norton of the
Alumni Association, "people have
already gone as far as
Chicago . . . close to 180 people,
including regular students, are
planning to contact alumni
groups."
Impressions
The alumni appeared
impressed. One, Mr. John Stern,
president-elect of the Westside
Alumni Club, said, "those kids
were great. They can trust some
of us older people, and I'm glad
they tried."
His wife echoed the sentiments,
"We're going to give some more
issue-oriented parties this summer,
and I hope the students will be
able to come again. They were
really great."
Another alumnus had just
returned from Palo Alto. "I took
my son up to see the
campus . . . so, someone broke a

few windows there, it's not all
that bad. I've seen worse, believe
me."
Taking Stands
All the alumns respected
students willing to take a stand.
Said one, "I thought I was a
heroine in 1945, when someone
called and asked about 'our
colored problem' and I told her
'we have no colored problem
madam' .. . then hung up the
phone. You kids are doing what
we should have done, you've
opened all our eyes to what's
going on in the world."
Open or not, all eyes were on
the two students at the evening
party. Most of the adults present
were eager to talk, to find out
how the Cambodian intervention
touched off a national strike.
Whether their alma mater was
Stanford or Texas A & M, most of
the adults at the evening party
were eager to talk with a student.
"I just don't know what's going
on," said an Angeleno
businessman. "You read the
TIMES, and they don't seem to be
covering the whole thing . . . boy,
this has been the most critical
week I think I've ever seen."
This Is Something'
Said another, "I didn't think
this was anything in particular
until I called my daughter Ann in
Berkeley and she said, 'Daddy,
I'm on strike.' She hasn't ever
been involved in anything, not
even People's Park, so I know this
is REALLY something."
Several reflected with pride
that their sons and daughters were
leafletting, picketing, or
obstructing traffic at schools such
as Santa Cruz, University of
Arizona, or UCLA.
Others weren't so enthused.
"My daughter just barely got out
of the administration building in
time, out at Santa Barbara," said a
lawyer, "and I told her, if she gets
arrested, I won't help her. It's her
own business, none of mine."
Fears
Behind the confident faces, a
number of persons expressed their
fears.


STUDENT HANDS have played a prominent part in many off ROTC-strike demonstrations the last few weeks. Here a band j
plays for politics in front of the Old Union.
"It's the anarchists, the ones
who want to destroy the whole
system, that frighten me," noted a
bearded doctor. Others agreed
with him, for they did have
something to lose. The swimming
pools, Porsches, and charge
accounts may be in danger, and
some of the more conservative
partygoers were tninking of them
as well as of their children and the
kids killed at Kent State.
As one liberal housewife aptly
put it, "I'm caught in the middle.
People tell me to write my
congressman, but he's too
conservative. Who can I work for
this year? I worked for Kennedy,
but I won't work for Brown or
Unruh. I'll vote for both of them,
but that's it. When Yorty wins, I'll
have to choose between him and
Reagan, and you know who 111
vote for—Reagan. What a
screwed-up state this is."
She's planning some anti-war
coffees in Brentwood with the aid
of the UCLA speaker's bureau,
but doesn't know what it will
accomplish.
Like the rest of Middle
America, she's caught in the
middle, and as the crisis deepens,
she remains confused.
