PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ROLE
OF THE COMMISSION.
(The first part of this statement
was printed in yesterday's
DAILY-ed.)
As the study group tentatively
sees it, the proposed Commission
on Stanford protest has two
related functions.
The first is to examine the
subject of campus protest in such
a fashion that, both by the
processes of its consideration of
the subject (including the pro
vision of a forum for the
expression and debate of views on
the subject by interested persons)
and by its product (which will

probably assume the form of a
report), the Commission can
provide the basis for a broad,
informed consensus on the
campus concerning the answers to
the following questions:
1) What is the legitimate range
of forms of protest and of the
expression of dissent on the
Stanford campus? What kinds of
conduct fall outside this range,
and hence exceed the permissible
bounds of protest?
2) What is the appropriate form
of response of the University
community to conduct that
exceeds the permissible bounds of
protest? What sanctions should be
permitted or required in cases of
such conduct, and how should

responsibility be assigned tor the
making of decisions to apply such
sanctions? What are the
responsibilities of the various
members of the campus
community in the face of conduct
going beyond the permissible
bounds of legitimate protest.
In identifying this aspect of the
Commission's task, we have in
mind the conclusion of the Cox
Commission that the Columbia
disorders were the result, in part,
of "the failure of the academic
community to think out the
implication of many current
forms of political demonstration
and to build a firm consensus of
moral opinion concerning the
limits upon morally acceptable
methods of expressing dissent."
We see the Stanford Commission's
work as the provision of a basis
for this kind of consensus with
regard to the legitimacy of proper
forms of dissent, the boundaries
of legitimate dissent, and the
legitimacy of the University's
response to conduct that
oversteps the boundaries.
The Commission's second task
is intimately related to the first.
For we take it to be true that any
definition of the appropriate
range of conduct expressive of
dissent and protest in a
community must take account of
the extent to which the
decision-making procedures of
that community allow for the free
and open expression and the
serious consideration of the views
of all its members in the processes
by which the community's major
decisions are made. For this
reason, the Commission must also
inquire:
1) Whether the processes by
which decisions are presently
made at Stanford University allow
adequate opportunity for
participation in the decisional
process by all interested persons?
If not, whether and what specific
changes in its decision-making
procedures are called for?
2) Whether processes now
available for broad-based
participation by the community
in decision-making are being
adequately used? If not, what is
obstructing their use, and how can
the obstructions best be
overcome? Whether the University
has a positive obligation to
provide facilities and assistance
for the expression of dissent
within boundaries deemed
permissible by the university
community?

subject of campus protest in such
a fashion that, both by the
processes of its consideration of
the subject (including the pro
vision of a forum for the
expression and debate of views on
the subject by interested persons)
and by its product (which will

probably assume the form of a
report), the Commission can
provide the basis for a broad,
informed consensus on the
campus concerning the answers to
the following questions:
1) What is the legitimate range
of forms of protest and of the
expression of dissent on the
Stanford campus? What kinds of
conduct fall outside this range,
and hence exceed the permissible
bounds of protest?
2) What is the appropriate form
of response of the University
community to conduct that
exceeds the permissible bounds of
protest? What sanctions should be
permitted or required in cases of
such conduct, and how should

responsibility be assigned tor the
making of decisions to apply such
sanctions? What are the
responsibilities of the various
members of the campus
community in the face of conduct
going beyond the permissible
bounds of legitimate protest.
In identifying this aspect of the
Commission's task, we have in
mind the conclusion of the Cox
Commission that the Columbia
disorders were the result, in part,
of "the failure of the academic
community to think out the
implication of many current
forms of political demonstration
and to build a firm consensus of
moral opinion concerning the
limits upon morally acceptable
methods of expressing dissent."
We see the Stanford Commission's
work as the provision of a basis
for this kind of consensus with
regard to the legitimacy of proper
forms of dissent, the boundaries
of legitimate dissent, and the
legitimacy of the University's
response to conduct that
oversteps the boundaries.
The Commission's second task
is intimately related to the first.
For we take it to be true that any
definition of the appropriate
range of conduct expressive of
dissent and protest in a
community must take account of
the extent to which the
decision-making procedures of
that community allow for the free
and open expression and the
serious consideration of the views
of all its members in the processes
by which the community's major
decisions are made. For this
reason, the Commission must also
inquire:
1) Whether the processes by
which decisions are presently
made at Stanford University allow
adequate opportunity for
participation in the decisional
process by all interested persons?
If not, whether and what specific
changes in its decision-making
procedures are called for?
2) Whether processes now
available for broad-based
participation by the community
in decision-making are being
adequately used? If not, what is
obstructing their use, and how can
the obstructions best be
overcome? Whether the University
has a positive obligation to
provide facilities and assistance
for the expression of dissent
within boundaries deemed
permissible by the university
community?
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ROLE
OF THE COMMISSION.
(The first part of this statement
was printed in yesterday's
DAILY-ed.)
As the study group tentatively
sees it, the proposed Commission
on Stanford protest has two
related functions.
The first is to examine the
subject of campus protest in such
a fashion that, both by the
processes of its consideration of
the subject (including the pro
vision of a forum for the
expression and debate of views on
the subject by interested persons)
and by its product (which will
