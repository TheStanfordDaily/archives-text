# FCM Files Suit Over GE Clash
## 
### 
Conservative activists of the
Free Campus Movement, Young
Republicans and the
yesterday filed a $1,050,000 suit
against the University. Details of
the suit are expected to be
announced at a press conference
the FCM has called for 10 a.m.
today in room 271 of Tresidder.
The suit stems from the alleged
lack of protection afforded the
conservative students during a
clash on December 4. ARENA
photographers were taking
pictures of a protest against
General Electric recruiting on
campus and were reportedly
surrounded by high school
radicals. Efforts were made to
confiscate their film and disable
their photographic equipment.
Later explanations of the
incident came from both sides.
Radicals cited the conservatives'
contribution of photographs to

the police the previous spring at
the time of the Hanover Street
demonstrations against the
Stanford Research Institute. The
conservatives acknowledged that
photographs like those taken at
the GE protest were used to
identify parties who later
participated in illegal acts. They
stated that the radicals' actions
infringed on conservatives'
freedom to walk around an open
campus and take photographs,
some of which would later be
used for their newspaper, the
ARENA.
The complaint, filed in North
Santa Clara County Superior
Court, accuses the University of
"willfully, recklessly or
negligently" controlling the
premises, and contends that the
six plaintiffs were "severely
injured" by 20 John Doe
assailants.
Speculation has arisen that the
language chosen for the suit is
intended to place pressure on the
University to keep its facilities
open and protected by Stanford
police during the current student
strike.
The suit asks $300,000 general
damages and $750,000 punitive
damages. The action was filed by
Roger L. Mosher of Wilson,
Mosher and Martin, a Palo Alto
law firm, and was discovered by
the University's corporation
counsel who checks daily court
records for matters which affect
the University.
The complaintants in the action
were Harvey H. Hukari, Jr.,
graduate student in
communications; Chris Hocker,
freshman ; Ernesto Rael, freshman;
Craig Ostfeld, graduate student in
physics; Roger Reed, senior in
political science; and Edward R.
Jagels, junior in history. One
student earlier associated with the
plans for the suit withdrew from
the enterprise.
Suits naming the Regents or
Trustees of colleges and
universities has been a nation-wide
conservative tactic beginning with
the Columbia University events of
1968 and has been endorsed by
the Young Americans for
Freedom, a national conservative
organization, from which the
FCM split last fall.
