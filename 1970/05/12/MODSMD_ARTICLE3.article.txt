# ROTC Group Poll Slated
## 
### 
A poll of student opinion
on ROTC will be taken next
week by the President's
Committee on ROTC Affairs.
The poll is being designed by a
subcommittee headed by
Professor Baldridge, according
to a committee decision
announced yesterday.
The Advisory Committee
yesterday held hearings to
investigate community opinion
on the punitive clause, and will
conduct further hearings on
other aspects of the ROTC
issue later this month.
The Advisory Committee
will report its findings and
recommendations to President
Pitzer on or before June 1.
Among other witnesses
yesterday was Prof. James
Gibbons, who presented a
proposal calling for radical
changes in the punitive clause,
including the postponment of
signing commissioning papers
until six months before
crrnduntion.
