# Charges Filed With SJC For Sit-Ins At Old Union
## 
### FRANK MILLER BILL FREIVOGEL 
University officials announced
yesterday afternoon that 55
charges have been brought against
participants in recent Old Union
sit-ins. And, Provost Richard
Lyman said later that the
Administration intends to invoke
"campus judicial mechanisms as
far as possible" to open buildings
currently shut by protests.
Thirty-three of the new charges
stem from the April 23 sit-in and
the rest from the April 29 sit in.
Seventeen students have already
been charged with disrupting the
Academic Council meeting in
early April. The new SJC action
brings the total number of SJC
cases stemming from this quarter's
protests to 72.
Lyman's speech, which raised
the probability of further campus
judicial action, did not specify
when and how campus regulations
would be used to open closed
buildings. And, the Provost
refused to elaborate on his speech
when contacted later in the
evening.
Marc Franklin, chairman of the
SJC did say, however, that he has
been informed that "he will get
some kind of document this
morning that will be invoked"
today.
Administration officials refused
to clarify what this document
might be.
Lyman did say, however, that
this should be clear "in light of
past procedures." Administration
attempts to deal with protests
have, in the past, ranged from
prolonged SJC hearings to the
"immediate interim suspensions"
used last spring.
Letters Sent Soon
The Daily also learned last
night that letters will be sent to
the students involved in the 55
new SJC cases announced today
as soon as the charges can be

processed. They should be sent by
mid-week.
Letters were sent out last
Friday to 17 students who have
been charged with disrupting the
Academic Council meeting of
April 3. Their hearing before the
SJC is scheduled for May 21.
In his speech over KZSU, the
Provost stressed that campus
judicial procedures were necessary
even though "no one who has the
slgithest understanding of what is
happening IN or TO our country
today can think seriously about
mere 'business as usual."
Disastrous Division
Lyman said he foresaw
"potentially disastrous division
developing, whereby one section
of Stanford (by all indications the
larger section) may soon be back
at the same old routine . . . and
another section of Stanford, even
more frustrated than before at the
u nresponsiveness of most
Americans is driven to irrational,
destructive, and in the end
self-destructive acts ..."
The Provost added that while
he did not "relish the possibility
of having to turn to tougher
means of enforcement,"
everyone's liberty had to be
protected.

"To protect that liberty," he
continued, "and to make possible
the continued operation of the
University this quarter, both for
regular academic purposes and for
the new and broader educational
purposes of which I have spoken,
we must demonstrate our capacity
for self-government."
Academic Flexibility
Lyman pointed to last
Thursday's statement by President
Kenneth Pitzer advocating
academic flexibility as a model
allowing students to combine
progress towards their degree with
progress towards bringing moral
weight to bear in the cause of
peace, freedom and justice."
Lyman also applauded "faculty
members who have redesigned
their teaching" to bring their
"courses more directly to bear on
contemporary problems." When
interviewed last evening after his
speech he said he hoped that more
students would work through the
political processes.
On Sunday night Lyman gave
another speech over KZSU
detailing the costs to the
University of the continued
forced closings of Encina Hall, the

ROTC buildings, and the
electronics laboratories.
Members of the strike
coordinating committee criticized
much of that speech as a "lie,"
and Lyman alloted part of his
time last night to contradicting
charges they made.
More Cases Possible
Paul Valentine, newly
appointed special counsel to the
University, is currently reviewing
more cases for possible hearings
before the Council, including 15
cases which were originally sent to
the SJC but which are evidently
still under investigation. These 15
possible charges include the
mill-in at the ROTC building and
disruptions of ROTC classes.
In addition to the campus
judicial action, 4 5 arrests have
been made this quarter through
civil court processes, and five
protesters have been asked to
"show cause" why they are not in
contempt of a permanent
injunction against disruptions.
Campus authorities are also
investigating 50 other cases
stemming from various incidents
for possible prosecution before
the SJC.

peace, freedom and justice."
Lyman also applauded "faculty
members who have redesigned
their teaching" to bring their
"courses more directly to bear on
contemporary problems." When
interviewed last evening after his
speech he said he hoped that more
students would work through the
political processes.
On Sunday night Lyman gave
another speech over KZSU
detailing the costs to the
University of the continued
forced closings of Encina Hall, the

ROTC buildings, and the
electronics laboratories.
Members of the strike
coordinating committee criticized
much of that speech as a "lie,"
and Lyman alloted part of his
time last night to contradicting
charges they made.
More Cases Possible
Paul Valentine, newly
appointed special counsel to the
University, is currently reviewing
more cases for possible hearings
before the Council, including 15
cases which were originally sent to
the SJC but which are evidently
still under investigation. These 15
possible charges include the
mill-in at the ROTC building and
disruptions of ROTC classes.
In addition to the campus
judicial action, 4 5 arrests have
been made this quarter through
civil court processes, and five
protesters have been asked to
"show cause" why they are not in
contempt of a permanent
injunction against disruptions.
Campus authorities are also
investigating 50 other cases
stemming from various incidents
for possible prosecution before
the SJC.

LIBERATION COLLEGE—Students gathered at Liberation College, located on the Old Union side ot White Plaza,
yesterday to consider the seven day old strike and to plan future action. Earlier, a BSU rally drew several hundred
onlookers.
University officials announced
yesterday afternoon that 55
charges have been brought against
participants in recent Old Union
sit-ins. And, Provost Richard
Lyman said later that the
Administration intends to invoke
"campus judicial mechanisms as
far as possible" to open buildings
currently shut by protests.
Thirty-three of the new charges
stem from the April 23 sit-in and
the rest from the April 29 sit in.
Seventeen students have already
been charged with disrupting the
Academic Council meeting in
early April. The new SJC action
brings the total number of SJC
cases stemming from this quarter's
protests to 72.
Lyman's speech, which raised
the probability of further campus
judicial action, did not specify
when and how campus regulations
would be used to open closed
buildings. And, the Provost
refused to elaborate on his speech
when contacted later in the
evening.
Marc Franklin, chairman of the
SJC did say, however, that he has
been informed that "he will get
some kind of document this
morning that will be invoked"
today.
Administration officials refused
to clarify what this document
might be.
Lyman did say, however, that
this should be clear "in light of
past procedures." Administration
attempts to deal with protests
have, in the past, ranged from
prolonged SJC hearings to the
"immediate interim suspensions"
used last spring.
Letters Sent Soon
The Daily also learned last
night that letters will be sent to
the students involved in the 55
new SJC cases announced today
as soon as the charges can be

processed. They should be sent by
mid-week.
Letters were sent out last
Friday to 17 students who have
been charged with disrupting the
Academic Council meeting of
April 3. Their hearing before the
SJC is scheduled for May 21.
In his speech over KZSU, the
Provost stressed that campus
judicial procedures were necessary
even though "no one who has the
slgithest understanding of what is
happening IN or TO our country
today can think seriously about
mere 'business as usual."
Disastrous Division
Lyman said he foresaw
"potentially disastrous division
developing, whereby one section
of Stanford (by all indications the
larger section) may soon be back
at the same old routine . . . and
another section of Stanford, even
more frustrated than before at the
u nresponsiveness of most
Americans is driven to irrational,
destructive, and in the end
self-destructive acts ..."
The Provost added that while
he did not "relish the possibility
of having to turn to tougher
means of enforcement,"
everyone's liberty had to be
protected.

"To protect that liberty," he
continued, "and to make possible
the continued operation of the
University this quarter, both for
regular academic purposes and for
the new and broader educational
purposes of which I have spoken,
we must demonstrate our capacity
for self-government."
Academic Flexibility
Lyman pointed to last
Thursday's statement by President
Kenneth Pitzer advocating
academic flexibility as a model
allowing students to combine
progress towards their degree with
progress towards bringing moral
weight to bear in the cause of
peace, freedom and justice."
Lyman also applauded "faculty
members who have redesigned
their teaching" to bring their
"courses more directly to bear on
contemporary problems." When
