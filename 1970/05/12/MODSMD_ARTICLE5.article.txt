# At Noon Rally
## Bazile Blasts Strike 
### Ralph Kostant 
Leo Bazile lashed out at white
moderates, conservatives and
radicals at a Black Students Union
noon rally yesterday.
Calling the student strike a
"temper tantrum" and a "family
squabble" the BSU chairman
issued a warning to strikers
taunting black workers who must
cross picket lines to feed their
families.
"Why don't you stop your
parents from going to work" he
challenged. "They're earning 18
or 20 thousand a year!
"When you shut this place
down completely, those black
workers will walk off with you,"
he added.
Bazile called upon the
"so-called white radicals to make
this strike work" and for
moderates and conservatives who
could not accept the tactics of the
radicals to "shut this place down
non-violently."
Position Paper
The BSU Position Paper on the
Strike is reprinted on page two of

today's Daily.
An earlier speaker at the rally
pointed out, as did Bazile, the
disparity between the reaction to
the Kent State killings and the
commonplace murders of people
of color.
"No coffins were paraded for
Fred Hampton and the other
nameless victims of white racism,"
he said.
The speaker, an unidentified
foreign student condemned
advocates of non-violent tactics,
saying that those who practice
either oppression or collusion
with the ruling class are enemies
of the people of the Third World.
Mack Incident
References were repeatedly
made to Burnell Mack, the black
student who was arrested and
allegedly beaten by Santa Clara
County Deputies on Wednesday,
April 29. The incident occurred
during the rioting which followed
the police break-up of an Old
Union sit-in.
Bijay Sharma, an Indian
graduate student, was also

arrested and beaten that evening.
Charges were never filed against
him and Craig Brown of the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office said yesterday that no
complaint is expected.
Claiming that the Santa Clara
Sheriff's Office had acknowledged
that the Sharma arrest was a racist
act, and that an official apology
had also been obtained for police
harrassment of BSU leaders,
Bazile concluded that the Mack
arrest was part of a police "nigger
hunt. Over-Reaction
"We do not wish to further
polarize this campus, Bazile
stated, "But we will not sit down
to racist over-reaction by Sheriff's
deputies."
Don Tamm, public relations
officer of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office, acknowledged
yesterday that a confrontation
had occured between deputies and
BSU members on the night of
April 29.
The deputies, while trying to
clear White Plaza, ordered the
blacks to disperse, Tamm said.
Bazile pointed out that a white
peace group had not been told to
leave. The deputies, according to
Tamm, had decided the white
group was too numerous to force
out of the plaza.
Not Racist
Tamm explained that he
subsequently had received a call
from President Pitzer's office
asking him to discuss the incident
with BSU representatives.
"We certainly regret it when
any people who are out of the
action get involved," said Tamm.
"I can see where Leo's group
might easily construe it to bo a
racial incident, but 1 am certain
that racism wasn't involved."
About 400 people attended the
noon rally in front of Old Union.
The crowd was largely white.
