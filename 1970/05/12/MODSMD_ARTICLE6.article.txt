## Group Asks Fall Break 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
A proposal to put the
"Princoton Plan" into effect here
at STanford, which would mean a
two-week recess prior to the
November general elections, will
be brought before the Faculty
Senate at its meeting Thursday.
Proponents of the plan stress
the "practical relevance of having
students getting involved in local
politics," and state that
scheduling such a recess now
would give "added leverage to a
national work stoppage,"
according to Ron Rosen of the
Political Recess Action Group
(PR AG).
Rosen stresses that to gain a
maximum effect the plan should
be approved during the current
crisis; it would thus have a bigger
impact on politicians who might
be willing to support, a work
stoppage and come out strongly
against the War in return for
student support next fall.
A tentative calendar for the fall
drawn up by PRAG would allow a
complete recess from October 21
to November 3. In order not to

shorten the quarter by more than
one day, students would return a
week early (tentatively,
September 21 ), and work through
the scheduled Thursday-Friday
Thanksgiving vacation.
Resolution
The resolution to be brought
before the Faculty Senate reads as
follows:
WHEREAS, Education in the
exercise of practical political
action is a necessary and valuable
component of the learning process
and is essential to the ideals of a
liberal education;and
WHEREAS, Student and
faculty participation in the
legitimate governmental process is
to be encouraged; and
WHEREAS, The use of
non-violent methods of political
expression is to be encouraged;
and
WHEREAS, The two-week
period prior to the November
elections is a lime during which
citizens can most effectively
influence the governmental
process; Therefore,
RE IT RESOLVED, that
Stanford University reorganize the

academic calendar to provide for a
class recess during the two-week
period prior to the November
elections.

Although momentum for the
recess is no more than a few days
old, the Political Action Recess
(•roup together with Dr. Green
berg of the Medical School, who is
the principal sponsor of the
proposal, anticipate considerable
faculty support.
Steps are already being taken
to spread the "Princeton Plan"
concept to other colleges, with
Stanford as the West-Coast
co-ordinating center.
The proposal at Princeton,
passed on May 5 with the
overwhelming support of students
and faculty, resolved that:
"The 1070-71 academic
calendar be rearranged to provide
a Iwo-week recess immediately
prior to the November elections
to allow members of the
University Community to
contribute their time and efforts
to local and congressional
campaigns in which they are
interested."

process; Therefore,
RE IT RESOLVED, that
Stanford University reorganize the

academic calendar to provide for a
class recess during the two-week
period prior to the November
elections.

Although momentum for the
recess is no more than a few days
old, the Political Action Recess
(•roup together with Dr. Green
berg of the Medical School, who is
the principal sponsor of the
proposal, anticipate considerable
faculty support.
Steps are already being taken
to spread the "Princeton Plan"
concept to other colleges, with
Stanford as the West-Coast
co-ordinating center.
The proposal at Princeton,
passed on May 5 with the
overwhelming support of students
and faculty, resolved that:
"The 1070-71 academic
calendar be rearranged to provide
a Iwo-week recess immediately
prior to the November elections
to allow members of the
University Community to
contribute their time and efforts
to local and congressional
campaigns in which they are
interested."
A proposal to put the
"Princoton Plan" into effect here
at STanford, which would mean a
two-week recess prior to the
November general elections, will
be brought before the Faculty
Senate at its meeting Thursday.
Proponents of the plan stress
the "practical relevance of having
students getting involved in local
politics," and state that
scheduling such a recess now
would give "added leverage to a
national work stoppage,"
according to Ron Rosen of the
Political Recess Action Group
(PR AG).
Rosen stresses that to gain a
maximum effect the plan should
be approved during the current
crisis; it would thus have a bigger
impact on politicians who might
be willing to support, a work
stoppage and come out strongly
against the War in return for
student support next fall.
A tentative calendar for the fall
drawn up by PRAG would allow a
complete recess from October 21
to November 3. In order not to

shorten the quarter by more than
one day, students would return a
week early (tentatively,
September 21 ), and work through
the scheduled Thursday-Friday
Thanksgiving vacation.
Resolution
The resolution to be brought
before the Faculty Senate reads as

WHEREAS, Education in the
exercise of practical political
action is a necessary and valuable
component of the learning process
and is essential to the ideals of a
liberal education;and
WHEREAS, Student and
faculty participation in the
legitimate governmental process is
to be encouraged; and
WHEREAS, The use of
non-violent methods of political
expression is to be encouraged;
and
WHEREAS, The two-week
period prior to the November
elections is a lime during which
citizens can most effectively
influence the governmental

RE IT RESOLVED, that
Stanford University reorganize the

academic calendar to provide for a
class recess during the two-week
period prior to the November
elections.
