# Strike Direction Uncertain

### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
As hundreds of Stanford
students returned to class
yesterday—the majority to discuss
the newly relaxed academic
requirements—considerable debate
focused on the course the campus
anti-war movement will take in
the second week of the strike
Departments and professors
were reported to be "riost
flexible" as classes met—many for
the first time in a week—to discuss

the options of unlimited pass-fails,
incompletes, and the ruling that
students can now drop classes
immediately before finals.
Individual professors, in lieu of
determined departmental policy,
generally explained how students
could exercise the new academic
options while completing the
academic requirements of the
class. Some professors announced
that normal class sessions would
be limited, others that normal

class activity would continue until
the end of the quarter.
Departments contacted by the
Daily late yesterday reported class
attendance between one-half to
"near normal." Most classes met
only to discuss the academic
options, but some professors
began normal lectures at the close
of discussion.
The Strike Coordinating
Committee, meeting last night,
encouraged students to go to San
Francisco today and non-violently
confront the Trustees.
Meeting Tonight
The Committee also voted to
hold a mass meeting at Memorial
Auditorium at 9 tonight to discuss
further strike activity
On the national level, last
week's wave of campus closings
subsided yesterday as students
across the country concentrated
on mobilizing the public from
coast to coast.
Five hundred students
convened at San Jose State
College to unify their opposition
to the Indochina War and
coordinate future activities.
Student Congress
Representing over 200
campuses, the delegates formed a
National Student Congress to
press for community action
against the war. They air to halt
business as usual while keeping
schools open as anti-war bases of
operation.
The same non-violent theme
appeared across the country.
Quiet prevailed on most
campuses, with isolated incidents
of traffic-blocking and marches.
Most students appeared concerned
with the practical problems posed
by canvassing, leafletting, and
informational picketing.
At Stanford, new efforts were
made to effectively coordinate
community education and
involvement in the anti-war
protest. Eight "community action
centers" were determined, which
will operate under the existing
Political Action Coordinating
Committee (PACC).
Local Centers
The centers include: basic
research, public relations, a
speakers forum, political
campaigning, coordinating for the
national work-stoppage
movement, community
canvassing, office work to assist
the community movement, and
coordination in sending telegrams
and letters to Congress.
According to spokesmen, this
new coordination will insure that
groups and departments do not
canvass the same area, send
