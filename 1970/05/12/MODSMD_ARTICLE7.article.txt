# Strike Direction Uncertain
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
As hundreds of Stanford
students returned to class
yesterday—the majority to discuss
the newly relaxed academic
requirements—considerable debate
focused on the course the campus
anti-war movement will take in
the second week of the strike
Departments and professors
were reported to be "riost
flexible" as classes met—many for
the first time in a week—to discuss

the options of unlimited pass-fails,
incompletes, and the ruling that
students can now drop classes
immediately before finals.
Individual professors, in lieu of
determined departmental policy,
generally explained how students
could exercise the new academic
options while completing the
academic requirements of the
class. Some professors announced
that normal class sessions would
be limited, others that normal

class activity would continue until
the end of the quarter.
Departments contacted by the
Daily late yesterday reported class
attendance between one-half to
"near normal." Most classes met
only to discuss the academic
options, but some professors
began normal lectures at the close
of discussion.
The Strike Coordinating
Committee, meeting last night,
encouraged students to go to San
Francisco today and non-violently
confront the Trustees.
Meeting Tonight
The Committee also voted to
hold a mass meeting at Memorial
Auditorium at 9 tonight to discuss
further strike activity
On the national level, last
week's wave of campus closings
subsided yesterday as students
across the country concentrated
on mobilizing the public from
coast to coast.
Five hundred students
convened at San Jose State
College to unify their opposition
to the Indochina War and
coordinate future activities.
Student Congress
Representing over 200
campuses, the delegates formed a
National Student Congress to
press for community action
against the war. They air to halt
business as usual while keeping
schools open as anti-war bases of
operation.
The same non-violent theme
appeared across the country.
Quiet prevailed on most
campuses, with isolated incidents
of traffic-blocking and marches.
Most students appeared concerned
with the practical problems posed
by canvassing, leafletting, and
informational picketing.
At Stanford, new efforts were
made to effectively coordinate
community education and
involvement in the anti-war
protest. Eight "community action
centers" were determined, which
will operate under the existing
Political Action Coordinating
Committee (PACC).
Local Centers
The centers include: basic
research, public relations, a
speakers forum, political
campaigning, coordinating for the
national work-stoppage
movement, community
canvassing, office work to assist
the community movement, and
coordination in sending telegrams
and letters to Congress.
According to spokesmen, this
new coordination will insure that
groups and departments do not
canvass the same area, send
speakers to the same places, or
duplicate research. "If we don't
coordinate all our efforts now,"
warned one student, "this strike
will collapse."
For the seventh day, Stanford
strikers blocked entrances to
Encina Hall, two Stanford
Electronics Laboratories (AEL
and ERL), and the ROTC
building. No incidents were
reported, although students
verbally clashed on the purpose of
denying entrance to employees
and researchers.
200 Inside Encina
At Encina, 75 protestors who
began their blockade at 6:30 a.m.
greeted workers arriving at 7:30.
Continuing their policy of
allowing only "essential business"
to function, the demonstrators
allowed staff in the controllers'
office, Credit Union, and Minority
Hiring to enter. Approximately
200 employees worked inside
Encina yesterday.

At the front door, where
employees were identified, both
students and workers voiced
dissatisfaction with the situation.
One demonstrator complained,
"This is absurd. We shut down the
building and allow everyone
inside. This is insane." However,
not all employees were allowed
inside, and one worker angrily
retorted, "You've got a lot of
nerve telling me how I should
protest."
Approximately 150 students
blocked all entrances to the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and the Electronics Research
Laboratory. The blockade passed
without incident, but nearly 50
researchers stood outside for some
time, angry and frustrated at once
again being prevented from
entering.
High School Students
Close to 300 high school
students, from Palo Alto, Gunn,
and Cubberley, marched up Palm
Drive into White Plaza in the early

afternoon chanting "On strike,
Shut it down!" Later 100
surrounded the Durand Aerospace
Building for a short time and
attempted to prevent employees
from entering.
One high school student
commented to the Daily after
seeing few students actively
blocking the electronics
laboratories that "we came here
because something was supposed
to be happening. We were pretty
damn disappointed," he
continued. "We expected to help
close this place down, and ail we
got was fifteen minutes of talk."
Most Stanford students seemed
particularly concerned with the
direction and spirit behind the
week-old strike. Many are worried
that students resuming nearly
normal academic activity this
week will not participate in
community ■ anti-war activity.
Howpyer, one leader, commented,
"A lot of those people going back
to class are doing three hours of
community work a day."
The question most generally
posed was: how is going back to
class going to affect strike activity
this week? Leaders throughout
the day pointed to the almost
total elimination of classwork in
some classes, and the subsequent
"freeing" of students to work in
strike activity.
One student, working with the
Political Science department's
strike activities in the community,
questioned the community work
as a "show of power." "I just
don't see much being done out
there to challenge Nixon."
