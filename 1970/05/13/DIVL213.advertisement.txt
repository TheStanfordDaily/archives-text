Today
Students at SUNY Stony
Brook arc ruefully recalling
today that two years ago it
was Great Pot Bust Time.
Armed police used the old
middle-of-the-night trick to
bust a whole hunch of our
fellow students who had
been spied upon by their
fr i e n d ly neighborhood
narcs.
If you want to expose a
narc, call our editorial
office at 321-2300 ext.
4632. Advertise your wares
through our business office,
327-4150.
