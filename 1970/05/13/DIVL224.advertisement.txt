CONGESSMAN PETE McCLOSKEY
has fought U.S. involvement in Vietnam
since entering politics in 1967.
Since the invasion of Cambodia, he has: sponsored with Rep. Allard Low
enstein (D.-N.Y.) — under "threats" from GOP leaders — amend
ments to the arms procurement bill to deny use of ANY military equip
ment and assistance in Cambodia. And he is working to limitthe larger
defense appropriations and defense construction bills in thesame way.
Beginning in March of this year he has worked with Rep. Don
Riegle (R.-Mich.) to limit fiscal 1971 defense appropriations to provide
only those funds required for the orderly withdrawal of all combat
and support troops from Vietnam and Laos by June 30,1971. McCloskey
began this lonely effort — the first of its kind in the House — and as
of last week, had won the support of 132 other Congressmen.
He has led the House effort to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin reso
lution.
McCLOSKEY IS FACING A WELL-FINANCED CONSERVATIVE LAWYER
IN THE JUNE 2nd PRIMARY. HIS OPPONENT HAS STATED FLATLY THAT HE:
supports President N'xon's policies in Cambodia, Laos, and
Vietnam, and thinks "we can win if only we start thinking positvely
about winning in Vietnam."
thinks ordinary citizens ought to leave military spending and
military war policy to the "experts."
IF PETE McCLOSKEY REMAINS IN CONGRESS, IT WILL ONLY BE
THROUGH THE SAME MASSIVE PUBLIC SUPPORT HE RECEIVED IN THE
ELECTION THAT SENT HIM TO CONGRESS — THE VICTORY OVER SHIRLEY
TEMPLE BLACK.
