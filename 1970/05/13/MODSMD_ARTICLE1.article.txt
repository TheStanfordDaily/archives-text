# Doors Blocked Again; SJC Charges Brought
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
Attempts by 50 strikers to
blockade the Electronics
Research Laboratory yesterday
failed as university officials
declared that those blocking the
door were in violation of campus
distruption policy.
Provost Richard Lyman issued
emergency regulations stating that
students who appear in clear
violation of the disruption policy
will be charged immediately
before the SJC under threat of
suspension. Students suspended
under these provisions could
remain suspended beyond the end
of the quarter if the SJC finds
that they fail to cooperate in
disposing of their cases.
Those strikers sitting in ERL
doorways refused to identify
themselves and thus became liable
to immediate suspension when
identified from the pictures taken
yesterday morning.
Shortly after the reading of
Lyman's statement,
demonstrators abandoned a door
of the Gil-Fillan Electronics
Laboratory and employees
entered the building. The
demonstrators then vacated from
the entrance to ERL.
Group Fails
Mary Hanson, a leader of the
strikers, announced, We failed to
hold the building because not
enough people came out. This is
the end of a non-violent strike."
The group then moved to the
ROTC building to consult with
demonstrators there.
Sixteen strikers obstructing the
entrance to the ROTC building

wore also ordered to present
themselves before the SJC for
scheduling of a hearing.
They identified themselves to
Col. Stanley Ramey who read the
emergency regulations.
In a statement to be printed
tomorrow by the Daily the ROTC
16 stated, "It is not our intent to
destroy this university. It is our
intent to reverse the momentum
of militarism which seems bound
to destroy us all, creating and
implementing policies which we
utterly condemn and have no
control over. ROTC does not
civilize the military, but is merely
a subservient tool to it. It is a vital
cog in that mindless machine, and
we are determined to end it."
The group from ERL met on
the lawn of the ROTC building
and, failing to find anything they
deemed worthy of harassment,
dissipated.
Encina Open
For the first time since the
beginning of the strike, the
doorways to Encina were open to
all employees. Demonstrators did
block entrances to the Durand
Building.
W.F. Miller, University
Vice-President for research,
revealed on KZSU yesterday that
he is soliciting a statement from
department heads reviewing
impact and importance of
Department of Defense research
to their departments. Miller
warned, that "We must not vent
our frustrations with the direction
of national domestic and foreign
policies on our colleagues because
they are close at hand."

He noted that both the
percentage and absolute amount
of DOD research at Stanford is
declining. DOD awards constitute
approximately 16% of federal
grants while 46% is received from
HEW, he said.
Mike Fehling, coordinator of
the Political Action Coordinating
Committee (PACC), charged
yesterday that the university
administration has left no course
of action open to the strike but
escalation. "The administration
verbally supports political
activities by students in this crisis,
but its actions don't take
cognizance of the time which
must be freed for such activity.
The administration has failed to
realize the intimidating nature of
its actions."
National Protest
Striking students at many
universities around the nation
continued to return to class,
although protests -in a few cases
violent-continued on most
campuses against the Indo-China
War and the deaths of four Kent
State students. The student strike
information center at Brandeis
University reported that 286
schools were on strike
indefinately.
More than 1,000 anti-war
demonstrators blocked entrances
to the federal building in Albany,
N.Y., virtually cutting off mail
service for about six hours in the
state capital.
State and city policy, backed
by the National Guard, swept
through the University of South
Carolina campus last night in the
second straight night of student
disorders.
At least 45 arrests were made
as over 1,000 students continued
to protest the arrest last week of
antiwar demonstrators. 83 arrests
were made by police in Ypsilanti,
Michigan, following disturbances
at Eastern Michigan University.
Max Rafferty yesterday
accused several Stanford
professors of trying to close
California public schools.
According to a UPI story,
Professor Thomas James informed
Rafferty of the alleged plans
which apparently arose during an
Education Department strike
meeting.
Representatives of hitherto
autonomous anti-war political
action groups decided to
coordinate their activities under
their PACC. Various departments
and functional groups assumed
responsibility for collating
information on activities.
Spokesmen for all on-going
political action groups are urged
to attend a meeting today at 4
p.m. in room 62 of the Business
School for further coordination
and cooperation of community
action efforts.
Engineering Dept.
In an action endorsed by Dean
Joseph Pettit, the School of
Engineering moved to set up an
Engineering Community Action
Program and redirect all business
on Thursday and Friday toward
this end. Engineers are moving to
discuss the war and related issues
with upper management and
technicians of surrounding
industries.
The engineering professors
were urged to limit the work load
and be lenient with incompletes.
A senior in engineering said this
was the first incident of

mobilization and concern in the
department. "The department is
considering questions that were
not discussed last week in the face
of perceived threats. The channels
are opening."
Phil Jackson, head of the
Savings Bond Redemption Drive,
announced that $23,000 worth of
bonds were turned in Monday.
The community responded to a
few leaflets that were distributed
door to door with $11,000 in
bonds.
"This was a test case," said
Jackson. "We encourage people to
exercise this opportunity for
peaceful, legal, non-violent protest
against the war. We urge that
money be reinvested in
peace-related areas such as
municiple bonds or banks." A
National Bond Redemption Day
is slated for May 28.
One hundred-fifty Stanford
students leafletted
Hewlett-Packard, reportedly
generating a favorable response
from employees. The students
intend to return and work toward
a company teach-in or strike.
Employees mentioned there seems
to be a peace movement
developing within the plant.
Political activity is expanding
at the Indo-China Political Action
Group, centered in the Institute
for Political Studies. Over 500
individuals are engaged in
contacting Bay Area political
elties to discuss the war, running a
speakers bureau and organizing
support for peace candidates.
Asserting that the Strike
should continue, Ben Page, of the
Indo-China group, said that the
group's efforts would not only
continue beyond the end of the
quarter but would extend into the
November elections.
New Courses
The Sociology Department
announced the following courses
to be offered with open
enrollment for the remainder of
the quarter. Those interested
should contact the appropriate
professors as soon as possible.
Alternative Forms of National
and Local Decision Making, Sandy
Dornbusch and Dick Scott;
Action Seminar on Organizing a
Nationwide Strike, Francie
Cancian; Seminar on the Political
Responsibility of the Social
Scientist, Mike Hannan and Steve
Olsen; Seminar and Training
Sessions of Precinct Wrok and
Political Convassing, Berner
Cohen and Buzz Zelditch;
Individual Work, Paul Wallin.
