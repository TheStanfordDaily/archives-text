# ‘Rational Dialogue?’
## Need For Dissent 
### Bill Cohan 
The following inquiry is addressed to those who feel that recent 1
events has been contrary to the principles of "democracy"-
specifically to the lack of "rational dialogue" as the mechanism for
formulating political decisions. 1
"Rational dialogue" would be a process of discussion producing
consensual statements which compel and constrain the truth ; when
one interlocutor claims access to "privileged information" which
renders his judgment beyond the reproach of dissenters denied
such information, "rational dialogue" becomes nothing more than
impudent manipulation of attitudes. Those who disagree with
President Nixon's decisions are forced to accept them on faith,
since he is not constrained by opposition; his censorship is
"legitimated" by "strategic considerations", "national security",
"the safety of our soldiers" (whom Nixon is killing) etc.

Information is manipulated in two ways: 1) by exposing the I
public to the images of dissent which are most likely to discredit 1
such dissent (e.g. the fact that active participants are a minority, J
the incidental destruction of property, etc.) and 2) by witholding ,
images of the massacre and mutilation which is constantly I
occurring. Those of you who feel justified in postponing judgment 1
and/or action should consider this point of law: "one cannot stand J
by and see his land improved by another without objecting and ,
then escape paying for it, for his silence is an implied assent, and he i
is stopped from alleging that he did not order or contract for the 1
improvement; "that is, all who do not actively oppose the policies J
of the Nixon Regime—including the slaughter of tens of thousands (
of peoples-are legally suporting those policies according to the laws i
of the land. I
The mirage of "classified information" is an exemplary J
sophism—the consistent inaccuracy of reports and predictions of (
the Southeast Asian situation is obviously deliberate. It seems i
reasonable to argue that the military command will always tend to i
misrepresent reality in order to maximize the apparent need for 1
initiating or escalating violence. Naturally investors in Southeast |
Asia will tend to falsify the picture of the situation with the intent i
to convince the public that our cherished way of life is threatened
by Communist "aggressors"; the right of U.S. investors to exploit
foreign countries is identified with our freedom and the
public-obediently finances the armed intervention and sacrifices its
sons to protect the wealth of a few imperialists.
Selective Manipulation
It must be posited that, as an animal at the mercy of Language,
man's behavior can often by manipulated by selective exposure to
certain images and stereotypes. President Nixon employs the image
of the U.S. as a "helpless giant" to evoke a visceral response from
the "silent majority", who take great pride in our ability to deal
death and destruction to non-white, non-capitalist nations.
Individuals who identify with the coercive power of the U.S.
constantly dwell on the theme of "victimization" and emphasize
"affronts to the dignity of the U.S." in order to justify the
suppression and exploitation of the rest of the planet. It is crucial
to the continued prosecution of the war that the public be denied
the images of the havoc we are wreaking. Broken windows and
rock throwing elicit outraged cries of violence; if campus
demonstrations merit the term violence, how are we to convey the
magnitude of the atrocities which are occurring even now as you
read this?
President Nixon has asserted that he has a plan for "peace"; he
has also sworn to uphold the Constitution. It has become clear that
Mr. Nixon does not always feel bound by his word. While our
country is torn apart by racial strife and opposition to the rape of
Southeast Asia, by poverty, by an all-pervasive cynicism and
distrust, while my family and friends are beaten, gassed, and
gunned down by police and guardsmen enforcing martial law, while
our soldiers lie rotting in rainforests and their buddies massacre
people just as the Gestapo did, while nuclear weapons stockpile
and the ABM is assembled and our environment is ruined, while
everything we could have been proud of is rent asunder and
astronauts journey to the moon in quest of illusory truths, I can
still hear Mr. Nixon steadfastly intoning, "I have a plan for Peace."
In the same breath my nostrils are assailed by the stench of
rotting skulls and putrefying intestines glittering in the subtropical
sunshine; my eyes are confronted with the haggard faces and
emaciated bodies of pleading men and women and crying children
(can you hear them shrieking and groaning?) and I see their bodies
undulate gracefully and pirouette as they are ripped open by the
M-16 slugs which are being pumped into them "under orders,
according to Mr. Nixon's plan." I see in slow motion a bullet
penetrating the left eye of a small child and bursting it open like a
raw egg; the bullet burrows relentlessly through the child's brain,
scattering bits and chunks of it along with the hopes and ideas it
once contained, emerging dutifully from the gaping jaw it just left
in what was once human head. A "lasting and honorable peace"
has been achieved by those whose mutilated bodies are scattered in
polls of their own blood.
My Lai Nausea
The wave of nausea and disbelief which spread across the
country in the wake of the exposure of the My Lai massacre
illustrates the fact that the public is unaware that this slaughter is
constantly occurring and could be roused to action if continuously
confronted with the truth. Many Vietnam veterans claim they have
difficulty sleeping, perhaps because they still hear echoes of the
screaming and moaning of those who realized that they were to be
slaughtered by protectors who have gone mad with the fear of an
ideology they do not even try to comprehend.
If you do not actively oppose Mr. Nixon's plan and policies,
fellow citizen, understand that you are supporting the murder of
NLF and North Vietnamese soldiers along with the murder of
human beings who prostrated themselves, who huddled and
begged, who quivered in terror and clutched their children to them
as they meekly donated their blood and their bones, their muscles
and their nerves, their feelings, every hope, every recollection of
joy, every memory of happiness, of loving, of being loved.
Mr. Nixon and his advisers have sought to discredit and suppress
dissent; the war continues to escalate; the power of the military
and the polarization of our society are greater than ever and
ever-increasing. The time to act has arrived and no one can deny his
responsibility to declare one's position and move — this means
YOU!

Selective Manipulation
It must be posited that, as an animal at the mercy of Language,
man's behavior can often by manipulated by selective exposure to
certain images and stereotypes. President Nixon employs the image
of the U.S. as a "helpless giant" to evoke a visceral response from
the "silent majority", who take great pride in our ability to deal
death and destruction to non-white, non-capitalist nations.
Individuals who identify with the coercive power of the U.S.
constantly dwell on the theme of "victimization" and emphasize
"affronts to the dignity of the U.S." in order to justify the
suppression and exploitation of the rest of the planet. It is crucial
to the continued prosecution of the war that the public be denied
the images of the havoc we are wreaking. Broken windows and
rock throwing elicit outraged cries of violence; if campus
demonstrations merit the term violence, how are we to convey the
magnitude of the atrocities which are occurring even now as you
read this?
President Nixon has asserted that he has a plan for "peace"; he
has also sworn to uphold the Constitution. It has become clear that
Mr. Nixon does not always feel bound by his word. While our
country is torn apart by racial strife and opposition to the rape of
Southeast Asia, by poverty, by an all-pervasive cynicism and
distrust, while my family and friends are beaten, gassed, and
gunned down by police and guardsmen enforcing martial law, while
our soldiers lie rotting in rainforests and their buddies massacre
people just as the Gestapo did, while nuclear weapons stockpile
and the ABM is assembled and our environment is ruined, while
everything we could have been proud of is rent asunder and
astronauts journey to the moon in quest of illusory truths, I can
still hear Mr. Nixon steadfastly intoning, "I have a plan for Peace."
In the same breath my nostrils are assailed by the stench of
rotting skulls and putrefying intestines glittering in the subtropical
sunshine; my eyes are confronted with the haggard faces and
emaciated bodies of pleading men and women and crying children
(can you hear them shrieking and groaning?) and I see their bodies
undulate gracefully and pirouette as they are ripped open by the
M-16 slugs which are being pumped into them "under orders,
according to Mr. Nixon's plan." I see in slow motion a bullet
penetrating the left eye of a small child and bursting it open like a
raw egg; the bullet burrows relentlessly through the child's brain,
scattering bits and chunks of it along with the hopes and ideas it
once contained, emerging dutifully from the gaping jaw it just left
in what was once human head. A "lasting and honorable peace"
has been achieved by those whose mutilated bodies are scattered in
polls of their own blood.
My Lai Nausea
The wave of nausea and disbelief which spread across the
country in the wake of the exposure of the My Lai massacre
illustrates the fact that the public is unaware that this slaughter is
constantly occurring and could be roused to action if continuously
confronted with the truth. Many Vietnam veterans claim they have
difficulty sleeping, perhaps because they still hear echoes of the
screaming and moaning of those who realized that they were to be
slaughtered by protectors who have gone mad with the fear of an
ideology they do not even try to comprehend.
If you do not actively oppose Mr. Nixon's plan and policies,
fellow citizen, understand that you are supporting the murder of
NLF and North Vietnamese soldiers along with the murder of
human beings who prostrated themselves, who huddled and
begged, who quivered in terror and clutched their children to them
as they meekly donated their blood and their bones, their muscles
and their nerves, their feelings, every hope, every recollection of
joy, every memory of happiness, of loving, of being loved.
Mr. Nixon and his advisers have sought to discredit and suppress

sons to protect the wealth of a few imperialists.
Selective Manipulation
It must be posited that, as an animal at the mercy of Language,
man's behavior can often by manipulated by selective exposure to
certain images and stereotypes. President Nixon employs the image
of the U.S. as a "helpless giant" to evoke a visceral response from
the "silent majority", who take great pride in our ability to deal
death and destruction to non-white, non-capitalist nations.
Individuals who identify with the coercive power of the U.S.
constantly dwell on the theme of "victimization" and emphasize
"affronts to the dignity of the U.S." in order to justify the
suppression and exploitation of the rest of the planet. It is crucial
to the continued prosecution of the war that the public be denied
the images of the havoc we are wreaking. Broken windows and
rock throwing elicit outraged cries of violence; if campus
demonstrations merit the term violence, how are we to convey the
magnitude of the atrocities which are occurring even now as you
read this?
President Nixon has asserted that he has a plan for "peace"; he
has also sworn to uphold the Constitution. It has become clear that
Mr. Nixon does not always feel bound by his word. While our
country is torn apart by racial strife and opposition to the rape of
Southeast Asia, by poverty, by an all-pervasive cynicism and
distrust, while my family and friends are beaten, gassed, and
gunned down by police and guardsmen enforcing martial law, while
our soldiers lie rotting in rainforests and their buddies massacre
people just as the Gestapo did, while nuclear weapons stockpile
and the ABM is assembled and our environment is ruined, while
everything we could have been proud of is rent asunder and
astronauts journey to the moon in quest of illusory truths, I can
still hear Mr. Nixon steadfastly intoning, "I have a plan for Peace."
In the same breath my nostrils are assailed by the stench of
rotting skulls and putrefying intestines glittering in the subtropical
sunshine; my eyes are confronted with the haggard faces and
emaciated bodies of pleading men and women and crying children
(can you hear them shrieking and groaning?) and I see their bodies
undulate gracefully and pirouette as they are ripped open by the
M-16 slugs which are being pumped into them "under orders,
according to Mr. Nixon's plan." I see in slow motion a bullet
penetrating the left eye of a small child and bursting it open like a
raw egg; the bullet burrows relentlessly through the child's brain,
scattering bits and chunks of it along with the hopes and ideas it
once contained, emerging dutifully from the gaping jaw it just left
in what was once human head. A "lasting and honorable peace"
has been achieved by those whose mutilated bodies are scattered in
polls of their own blood.
My Lai Nausea
The wave of nausea and disbelief which spread across the
country in the wake of the exposure of the My Lai massacre
illustrates the fact that the public is unaware that this slaughter is
constantly occurring and could be roused to action if continuously
confronted with the truth. Many Vietnam veterans claim they have
difficulty sleeping, perhaps because they still hear echoes of the
screaming and moaning of those who realized that they were to be
slaughtered by protectors who have gone mad with the fear of an
ideology they do not even try to comprehend.
If you do not actively oppose Mr. Nixon's plan and policies,
fellow citizen, understand that you are supporting the murder of
NLF and North Vietnamese soldiers along with the murder of
human beings who prostrated themselves, who huddled and
begged, who quivered in terror and clutched their children to them
as they meekly donated their blood and their bones, their muscles
and their nerves, their feelings, every hope, every recollection of
joy, every memory of happiness, of loving, of being loved.
Mr. Nixon and his advisers have sought to discredit and suppress
dissent; the war continues to escalate; the power of the military
and the polarization of our society are greater than ever and
ever-increasing. The time to act has arrived and no one can deny his
responsibility to declare one's position and move — this means
YOU!

The following inquiry is addressed to those who feel that recent 1
events has been contrary to the principles of "democracy"-
specifically to the lack of "rational dialogue" as the mechanism for
formulating political decisions. 1
"Rational dialogue" would be a process of discussion producing
consensual statements which compel and constrain the truth ; when
one interlocutor claims access to "privileged information" which
renders his judgment beyond the reproach of dissenters denied
such information, "rational dialogue" becomes nothing more than
impudent manipulation of attitudes. Those who disagree with
President Nixon's decisions are forced to accept them on faith,
since he is not constrained by opposition; his censorship is
"legitimated" by "strategic considerations", "national security",
"the safety of our soldiers" (whom Nixon is killing) etc.

public to the images of dissent which are most likely to discredit 1
such dissent (e.g. the fact that active participants are a minority, J
the incidental destruction of property, etc.) and 2) by witholding ,
images of the massacre and mutilation which is constantly I
occurring. Those of you who feel justified in postponing judgment 1
and/or action should consider this point of law: "one cannot stand J
by and see his land improved by another without objecting and ,
