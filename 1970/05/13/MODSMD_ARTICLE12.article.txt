# Student Assaulted, Robbed Near Union
## 
### 
A 19-year-old Stanford coed
was held at gunpoint, robbed and
raped shortly after leaving her
work at the Tresidder Memorial
Union coffee house at 2 a.m.
yesterday.
Following examination at
Cowell Health Center, she
returned to her residence in Palo
Alto. She was the third rape
victim at Stanford in the past six
months.
Monday morning at 2:30
another girl was raped in her room
in Wilbur Hall. In a note to all
Wilbur residents, director Jim
Glen said that the girl was
attacked while her roommate was
taking a shower.
Sheriff's Deputies Keenan
Kirby and Louis Keeling said the
coed attacked yesterday was
approached by two men as she
went to her car in the Tresidder
parking lot. One brandished a
pistol and asked her for her
money. She gave him $48, all she
had.
He then told her to get into her
car and joined her while his
accomplice left in a second
vehicle. They drove to the Medical
Center parking lot where the
assault took place. He kept the
revolver on her constantly,
cocking it at one point.
He then ordered her to drive
him to the corner of University
and El Camino, where he said
"my friend is watching, so just
continue on." He took a package
and a large flowery handbag of
hers before leaving. She returned
to her Palo Alto residence and had
a friend call police.
She described her assailant as

17 to 25 years old, six feet tall,
slender, black, wearing a black
beret, sun glasses, and dark pants
and coat. She described his
campanion as short and black.
Neither discription matched those
in the previous rape.
The attacker said he needed
money to bail out a friend who
had been jailed for possession of
drugs.
