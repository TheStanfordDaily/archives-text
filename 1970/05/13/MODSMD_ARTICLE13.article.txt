# The 						Halls Of Encina
## 
### LESLIE CAMPBELL 
Seven of the workers in
not-closed-but-restricted Encina
Hall, had different ideas about the
students obstructing the entrances
to their building. None expressed
appreciation or even approval.
The degree of negativity ranged
from"I agree, but" on the third
floor, to "it's a nuisance" on the
second floor, to "they're just
foolish kids" and"I have nothing
to say" on the first floor.
The third floor was ionely. One
man, the General Secretary, sat in
a large office by himself; a
contemporary version of the
stripe-shirted, garter-armed
Western Union dispatcher straight
out of the old west. "I agree with
redirecting the university to
anti-war efforts but the university
still needs money whatever it's
doing," he explained.
He is in charge of securing
funding for the university from
alumni and foundations on the
east coast.Working w/out secretary

appeared to be an exhausting
business. He has ten things to do
at once and he doesn't even know
how to operate the forever
flashing switchboard in his office.
Secretaries
An elderly lady on the second
floor has worked as a secretary to
the Director of Finance for
twenty-five years. Her first
reaction was, "I think it's a
terrific nuisance and I don't think
it's doing any good." She felt that
students should continue their
classes and get their education and
that "canvassing should be an
extra-curricular activity."
Although she admitted that the
students were polite, "firm but
courteous," she insisted that
students all over the nation had
made their point last week. "I
don't think Nixon is going to
listen," said the friendly pessimist,
joining ranks with thousands.
The sixty year old secretary at
the next desk, who had been

typing diligently to this point,
remarked "if we just put the old
men and the politicians in the
front line, there wouldn't be any
war at all." Both secretaries, a row
of broken windows behind thorn,
decided that they telt sorry for
"the kids out there." One
preached, "They're not having
any fun. You're only young for
such a short time. You're getting
serious too quickly and you're
wasting your youth."
The secretaries smiled and said,
"We wish you could have had the
fun we hid. The United States
wasn't in a war when we were
young." The new aware
generation sudd?nly became the
unlucky.
Accountants
Two young female accountants
creted a rather ironic situation on
the first floor. As one shouted,
"They're just foolish, young kids.
They don't even know what they
are doing!," the other quietly
asked, "What are they sitting out
there for? What is this thing about
anyway?"
They both looked like
twenty-five year old gum chewers
from high school and were ready
to go out for lunch. They proudly
confessed that they don't like
working at Encina and would
gladly take plenty of days off if
they could, "but it's the principle
of the thing."
Two secretaries taking refuge
in the first floor bathroom were
less loquacious. One said between
her teeth, "I have nothing to say."
The other was more articulate. "I
don't think you want to hear
what I have to say."
The communication gap
appears virtually unbridgeable in
the halls and offices of Encina.

from"I agree, but" on the third
floor, to "it's a nuisance" on the
second floor, to "they're just
foolish kids" and"I have nothing
to say" on the first floor.
The third floor was ionely. One
man, the General Secretary, sat in
a large office by himself; a
contemporary version of the
stripe-shirted, garter-armed
Western Union dispatcher straight
out of the old west. "I agree with
redirecting the university to
anti-war efforts but the university
still needs money whatever it's
doing," he explained.
He is in charge of securing
funding for the university from
alumni and foundations on the
east coast.Working w/out secretary

appeared to be an exhausting
business. He has ten things to do
at once and he doesn't even know
how to operate the forever
flashing switchboard in his office.
Secretaries
An elderly lady on the second
floor has worked as a secretary to
the Director of Finance for
twenty-five years. Her first
reaction was, "I think it's a
terrific nuisance and I don't think
it's doing any good." She felt that
students should continue their
classes and get their education and
that "canvassing should be an
extra-curricular activity."
Although she admitted that the
students were polite, "firm but
courteous," she insisted that
students all over the nation had
made their point last week. "I
don't think Nixon is going to
listen," said the friendly pessimist,
joining ranks with thousands.
The sixty year old secretary at
the next desk, who had been

typing diligently to this point,
remarked "if we just put the old
men and the politicians in the
front line, there wouldn't be any
war at all." Both secretaries, a row
of broken windows behind thorn,
decided that they telt sorry for
"the kids out there." One
preached, "They're not having
any fun. You're only young for
such a short time. You're getting
serious too quickly and you're
wasting your youth."
The secretaries smiled and said,
"We wish you could have had the
fun we hid. The United States
wasn't in a war when we were
young." The new aware
generation sudd?nly became the
unlucky.
Accountants
Two young female accountants
creted a rather ironic situation on
the first floor. As one shouted,
"They're just foolish, young kids.
They don't even know what they
are doing!," the other quietly
asked, "What are they sitting out
there for? What is this thing about
anyway?"
They both looked like
twenty-five year old gum chewers
from high school and were ready
to go out for lunch. They proudly
confessed that they don't like
working at Encina and would
gladly take plenty of days off if
they could, "but it's the principle
of the thing."
Two secretaries taking refuge
in the first floor bathroom were
less loquacious. One said between
her teeth, "I have nothing to say."
The other was more articulate. "I
don't think you want to hear
what I have to say."
The communication gap
appears virtually unbridgeable in
the halls and offices of Encina.
Seven of the workers in
not-closed-but-restricted Encina
Hall, had different ideas about the
students obstructing the entrances
to their building. None expressed
appreciation or even approval.
The degree of negativity ranged
from"I agree, but" on the third
floor, to "it's a nuisance" on the
second floor, to "they're just
foolish kids" and"I have nothing
to say" on the first floor.
