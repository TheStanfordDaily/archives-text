cancelled—the show will go on, as
Ram's Head Spring Show opens
tonight with Eugene lonesco's
"The Bald Soprano." Show time
is 8:30 p.m. tonight and
tomorrow, and 7:30 and 10:00
p.m. on Friday and Saturday.
Half the proceeds will benefit
the Legal Defense Fund. Due to
the strike in the Speech and
Drama department, "A 'United'
Family," originally the second
half of the show, will not be
performed.
The dialogue of "The Bald
Soprano" is composed of simple
sentences taken from a Teach
Yourself English textbook.
lonesco saw these sentences as
essential truths, which he then
wanted to communicate to his
contemporaries.
Somehow, though, when
strung together, the simple truths
go mad. The language becomes
distorted, and words, now absurd,
are emptied of their content.
"The Bald Soprano" is a painted
verbal commentary on today's
society.
