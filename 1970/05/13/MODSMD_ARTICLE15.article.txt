# Blackmun Approved

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate, which rejected President
Nixon's first two choices to fill a
year-old vacancy on the Supreme
Court, unanimously confirmed
yesterday his nomination of Judge
Harry A. Blackmun of Rochester,
Minn.
There was little debate before
the 94-0 vote, but Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C., and other
Southern senators said that in
Blackmun's case the Senate was
applying a different standard of
judicial ethics than it did in
rejecting Judge Clement F.

"Apparently if a judge is from
South Carolina a higher standard
of ethics is required than if a
judge is from Minnesota," said
Hollings.
No one rose to dispute him, but
senators who fought
Haynsworth's nomination
contended that, unlike Blackmun,
he failed to take steps to avoid an
appearance of conflicts-of-inter
est.
In his Rochester, Minn, office,
Blackmun took the news in
typically low-keyed fashion.
