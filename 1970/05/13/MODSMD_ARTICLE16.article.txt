# Armed Farces Day
## 
### 
Saturday, May 16, is Armed
Forces day at Fort Ord.
Traditionally, civilians are invited
to the base each spring to watch
parades and examine exhibits, but
this year the principle activities
planned for visitors are a march
and rally sponsored by the
Movement for a Democratic
Military. (MDM)
The MDM is a growing
anti-war, anti-racist movement
composed principally of enlisted
men and servicewomen. It has
recently organized nationally,
with a twelve point program
which centers around the demand
to end the denial of basic human

and legal rights of enlisted
military personnel.
MDM provides off-base
meeting places where G.l.'s can
discuss political issues in a free
atmosphere, and in addition
publishes newspapers and
pamphlets designed to inform
military personnel of political
developments both on and off
base.
Support of the MDM has
grown rapidly among active duty
servicemen, although such support
has not been without its hazards.
Movement headquarters,
coffeehouses, and publications
have been subjected to
harrassment by military and civil
authorities, and on one occasion a
movement office was attacked by
snipers.
Armed Farces Day will
hopefully provide an indication of
civilian support for MDM and an
opportunity for civilians to talk to
G.l.'s on a personal level. There
will be cars and buses leaving from
the Tresidder parking lot between
8 and 8:30 Saturday morning. For
further information, especially
concerning transportation, call
322-3089 or stop at the MDM
table in front of the Old Union.
