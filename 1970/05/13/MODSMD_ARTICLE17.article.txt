# Flying Club Takes Off
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
The airlines are right - flying is
fun.
It's even more fun without a
gig jet and the "coffee, tea, or
punch?" pitch somewhere
between the "fasten your seat
belts" and the "see our friendly
travel magazine."
The Stanford Flying Club has a
better idea - going up in small
craft, playing around, and without
a tie to a schedule, or a board of
directors.
The only hard and fast rule is
to keep the plane off the ground.
The one hundred twenty
members of the club operate out
of San Carlos Airport, down the
road from San Francisco
International and north of San
Jose Municipal. They rent their
planes from a flight school at a
discount.
It has a runway, a couple of
hangars, and a number of flight
services. For a small craft airport,
it's not at all bad - and if you
don't look too hard at the sewage
plant across the street, it's not bad
at all.
No Worries
The club members rent their
planes from one of the flight
services. They get a discount, and
a relief from the mundane chores
of maintenance and checkups.
The renting also allows for a
choice of planes, from four

passenger Beechcrafts to a
two-passenger Citabria, just
perfect for aerial acrobatics. Also
ready and waiting are three
trainers - two Cessna 150's
designed for in-flight instruction.
Getting a license poses a few
problems for the erstwhile pilot.
He needs a number of hours of
classroom instruction, at least 20
hours of in-flight instruction, and
another 20 hours of solo
experience. This includes 10
hours of cross-country travel -
from one airport to another, for a
distance of at least twenty-five
miles.
Costly To Learn
It doesn't come cheap, either.
The flying time and instructors'
fee amount to over $600 - though
working through the club saves
the student flyer a considerable
sum.
The club rate saves $3 an hour
on the plane rental according to
Baughn. The plane rentals range
from $12 an hour for the trainer
to over $30 for a four seater craft.
A clock on the dashboard runs
while the engine is running; thus,
the pilot pays only for the time
spent in the air or on the runway
The reasons members give for
flying vary from the practical to
the "because it's there."
"I started flying because of
business," notes Baughn. "I was

hooked by the time I got back
here to finish my doctorate."
Another member, returning
from a weekend in Las Vegas,
noted his use of planes for
inexpensive travel.
Above And Beyond
All agreed that flying had its
rewards above a.id beyond the
practical. It's hard to dispute that.
There's something very special
about flying that beats driving,
walking, or riding the train. The
openness of the air allows a
freedom that even the air traffic
controllers can't deny. Flying over
mountains, marshes and the Bay
makes one feel more stirs an
individual spirit hard to recognize
as one fights freeway traffic, looks
for an apartment, or fight the
telephone company. Freedom
may be an elusive spirit, but with
a plane and some gasoline it can
be a real experience.
