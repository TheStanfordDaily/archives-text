# Med School Sends Delegates To D.C
## 
### 
Three delegates from the
Stanford Medical School are going
to Washington, D.C. to discuss
with "conspicuously popular
political and labor officials" a
National Work Stoppage Day.
The delegation will represent
the Medical School's National
Work Stoppage Committee which
was formed during last week's
strike activities and is under the
direction of pharmacology
professor Lewis Aronow. This
committee is one of several action
groups formed last week and is
the western states central
headquarters for the National
Work Stoppage Movement. One
student left yesterday and two
will leave today.
The committee says that "a
nation-wide work stoppage will
show the Administration that the
vast majority of workers in this
country are fed up with killing,
that they are tired of paychecks
that lag behind the inflation
cuased by the war.
The length of the work
stoppage has not been
determined. According to the
committee the initial goal may be
one day, with an extension "if the
politicians do not listen."
Other regional headquarters for
the stoppage movement are at
Williams, Franklin & Marshall and
Case-Western Reserve, and
telephone communication has
been set up in over 200 schools.

Ron Rosen, committee
member and Medical School
student said that the movement
needs "support at home" because
support gives the movement and
its delegation bargaining power.
Stanford medical people have
been in contact to discuss work
stoppage with members of Bay
Area chapters of various national
unions including the International
Longshoremen and Warehouse
Union, American Federation of
Teachers, International Ladies
Garment Workers Union, United
Auto Workers, boilermakers,
steel workers, and local labor
councils.
Normal research and classroom
activities have been at a near
standstill at the Medical Center
since last week and about 500
workers, students and faculty of
the Center have been mobilized
into active groups besides the
Work Stoppage Committee. Some
volunteers have been organized
into groups which are mailing
letters to Washington from local
citizens, while others are seeking
to mobilize the medical
community across the nation.
Offices for the National Work
Stoppage Committee are at the
Medical Center in Room S-207,
telephone 329-8130. General
information can be obtained at
the Nerve Center Room M-127 or
321-1200x6209 or 6210.
