# Release Of Mack Asked By Blacks
## 
### 
About 40 members of the
Black Student Union met behind
President Pitzer's office yesterday
afternoon to receive the
administration's reply to their
demands to free Burnell Mack.
Presidential Assistant Willard
Wyman came out and spoke to
the students. He said that the
district attorney's office felt that
it had substantive evidence for a
case against Mack, evidence they
did not have in Bijay Sharma's
case. He also said that the district
attorney and not the university
has power to drop the charges.
In last night's mass meeting
BSU chairman Leo Bazile read a
letter from President Pitzer in
which Pitzer said the University
has no right to demand that police
drop the charges against Mack, a
black junior. Pitzer added that the
University does not give legal
service to every student although
legal help is available through the
International Association and the
Dean of Students.
According to Bazile, the letter
also said that Santa Clara Sherif's
"insured me (Pitzer) there was no
discrimination" in the charging
and arrest of Mack. And Pitzer

said that Mack "might wish to
seek redress" through the legal
system if it is felt that an error
was made by the police.
Alter the short meeting with
Wyman the black students
decided to leave. According to
one, "We know what we have to
do, but this is not the time and
place to do it."
Bazile also told the meeting
that it was the District Attorney
who was prosecuting and not
Pitzer or the University. Mack was
arrested by plainclothes police on
April 29 and charged with assault
with a deadly weapon (throwing a
rock) and resisting arrest. He was
treated at the booking station
(Old Union) and the hospital for
injuries he received. The BSU
alleges these occurred through
beatings by police. The
organization has said that he was
beaten so badly that he couldn't
walk.
The BSU charged that the
police were on a "Nigger Hunt"
that night and cite the arrest and
the later dropping of charges
against the Indian student Bijay
Sharma as an example of this
racial discrimination.
At a noon rally on Monday the
BSU said that the police had
issued a formal apology for
harrassment of BSU leaders the
evening of April 29. On that
evening, police ordered blacks to
disperse on White Plaza while not
bothering a white peace group.
