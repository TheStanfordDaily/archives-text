harmony with non-violent, non-coercive tactics offering each person
in the Stanford community his right to free speech and open dialogue.
Coach Dick Gould clarified the team position and exhibited his
great esteem for his players' attitudes and opinions. "Some of the
guys are for the Vietnam war and others are against. The men just
wanted to voice their support for the student strike on Thursday only
which allowed every individual a free forum for discussion of his
views," Gould explained.
While no records were kept, Coach Gould commented that the
Indians won a majority of the exhibition practice matches against the
Cougars. Stanford racketmen finish the season with a 12-5 log since
last week-end's Cal match was called off by Governor Ronald Reagan.
