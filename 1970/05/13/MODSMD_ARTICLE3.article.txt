## Six Students Announce Suit 
### 
Six libertarian-conservative
students announced yesterday
that they have filed a $1,050,000
damage suit against the
University.
As reported in Yesterday's
Daily, the Free Campus
Movement (FCM) members charge
the university with failure to
protect them from bodily injury
in a clash with demonstrators last
December 4.
Harvey Hukari, .Jr., FCM
president and editor of the Arena,
said at a press conference that one
of the reasons the group filed the
suit is to protest the
unwillingness of the
Administration "to protect the
rights of students to carry on
normal business without
interference and to attend
classes."
He added the suit showed "a
loss of faith" and "diminishing
respect for the University" that
prides itself on being a top
university.
He said "our hope is that this
will in some way prod the

University" into doing something
about the demonstrations
currently going on and those that
will take place in the future.
Two Purposes
Attorney for the group, Roger
Mosher of the Wilson, Mosher and
Martin law firm, said the suit has
two purposes: to recover damages
and to establish a legal precedent
that the University owes a duty to
students for physical protection.
Hukari commented that many
of the students currently involved
in attempts to block entrances to
the ROTC building, Encina Hall
and electronics research
laboratories are the same ones
who attacked the group.
The suit asks for $750,000 in
punitive damages and $.'500,000 in
general damages.
Mosher said that there are
many precedents for the action
that are "way up the appeals
ladder." He said he is optimistic
about winning the suit.
Last December 4, Arena
photographers were taking

pictures of a protest against
General Electric recruiting on
campus and were alledgedly
surrounded by some of those
protesting.
Some of the protestors, many
of them high school students
according to Hukari, attempted to
confiscate film and damage the
cameras.
Tresiddcr Fight
A scuffle ensued as the group
retreated to the Tresidder Union
lobby. A 20-minute fight broke
out there between the protestors
and photographers.
Hukair claims that University
administrators were present and
knowledgeable of the fight and
that calls had been placed to
various police departments.
No police, however, respond to
the call. Hukari maintains the
administration prevented the
police from breaking up the fight
for fear that the appearance of
police would only aggravate the
event further.
