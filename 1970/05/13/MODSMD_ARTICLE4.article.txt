# Strike Meeting
## Black Demands Supported 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
"Free Burnell Mack" demands
were the main concern of a strike
mass meeting in Memorial
Auditorium last night. About
1400 listened to discussion of
felony charges against Mack, a
black student charged with assault
with a deadly weapon and
resisting arrest in March .31
campus disorders.
The meeting adopted Black
Student Union (BSU) demands
that charges be dropped and the
university pay medical costs for
Mack's injuries in alleged police
beatings.
Shortly before midnight, the
meeting adjourned and about 200
people started a slow march to
President Pitzer's house with
chants of "Free Burnell Join Us."
As the marchers passed Crothers,
Stern, Branner and Wilbur, they
picked up additional support.
When the group reached
Pitzer's house, it numbered about
250. President Pitzer did not
appear to talk with the protestors,
and he could not be reached by
telephone by a delegation wishing
to speak with him.
The strikers had marched to
demand that Pitzer take
"affirmative action to have the
charges dropped" by 9 o'clock
this morning, before Mack's 10
o'clock arraignment.
The meeting developed into a
discussion of the aims of the
radical caucus, and broke up
shortly before 1 a.m.
Before the Memorial
Auditorium meeting broke up,
those present voted to continue
their strike of the University. The
strike faltered yesterday morning
when few people showed up to
block doorways to science labs.
March Set
A march to the North County
Courthouse is set for 9 a.m. today
along with a 10 o'clock rally on
the courthouse steps. A small
number of students have indicated
that they will begin a sit-in at the
courthouse after Mack is
arraigned.
The march will leave from the
Oval at the head of Palm Drive.

The group also plans to block
entrances to many buildings,
including ROTC and the science
laboratories. Speakers called for
students advocating non-violent
action to support the sit-ins, and
they have scheduled an early
morning meeting at the ROTC
building to co-ordinate activities
there.
The meeting also voted to
continue the picket lines that
were started yesterday at the
University's shipping and receiving
facilities. An organizational
meeting at the receiving depot is
slated for 7:45 this morning.
Proposals considered before the
march to Pitzer's house included a
morning march to his office, a
militant sit-in, "the sky is the
limit" mobile action, and today's
march on the Palo Alto
courthouse.
As at past meetings, Black
Student Union (BSU) President
Leo Bazile chided the protestors,
saying, "If you're not serious
about any of this stuff, you ought
to stop bullshitting people."
He spoke against a sit-in except
for those "masochistic enough" to
seek arrest. He said sit-ins show
"defiance" only if people are
"ready to fight it out there" when
police arrive.
200 Urge Sit-In
Only about 200 showed
willingness to join a sit-in last
night in a straw vote early in the
meeting.
But Bazile declined to suggest
other proposals because, "If I do,
I'll be in jail for inciting riot and
you'll have me on posters."
He also said power to drop the
charges against Mack lay with the
district attorney rather than Pitzer
and read a letter from Pitzer
saying the university could not
interfere in the matter.
Although speakers were
virtually unanimous in giving the
"free Burnell" charges top priority,
proposals for action were debated
for more than two hours. The
meeting's pace was slower and its
tone quieter than that of most
strike meetings.

Several speakers supported a
"sky-is-the-limit, do-it" tactic,
threatening violent action with no
limit if the demands are not met
this morning.
Alternate Proposals
Before last night's "non-violent
march" was voted, other
proposals for the night had
included suggestions that such a
march would be violent and an
alternative plan for a "late night
guided tour of campus" with
militant, mobile action.
Mary Hanson proposed early in
the meeting that 1,000 students
who signed a strike complicity
statement demand separate,
individual trials before the
Stanford Judicial Council if the
demands are not met before the
arraignment.
She said that would "attack
that bureaucratic bullshit thing
and smash it."
Janet Weiss and others said
Mack's charges and alleged beating
showed discrimination that should
be placed "in the context of the
Augusta killings." Five blacks
were killed during rioting there
Monday night.
She pointed to student anger
over the killing of four white
students at Kent State University
last week and commented, "I
think that we should have an even
stronger response to what
happened in Augusta. I think we
have to rise up in support of our
brothers in Augusta."
Professor Bruce Franklin said
"non-violent" voters at mass
meetings really intend "that
radicals should not do anything
because [the voters] were not
prepared to do anything."
But he said he would support
non-violent action to see if
students advocating it would stay
to participate.
Franklin insisted, however, that
no meeting could have a "binding
vote" preventing radical action.
He said, "No one can vote us out
of our brotherhood with Bernell
Mack."
Franklin added that students
must be prepared to go to jail to
keep Mack out of jail.
