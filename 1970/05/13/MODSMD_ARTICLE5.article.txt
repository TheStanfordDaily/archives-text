# Trustees Abstain On GM Vote
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The Board of Trustees
yesterday decided to abstain from
voting the University's General
Motors stock proxies for the
Ralph Nader's consumer oriented
proposals.
The proposals were to expand
the General Motors board of
directors to allow for consumer
representatives and to create a
shareholders committee for
corporate responsibility.
On all other issues before the
May 22 GM shareholders meeting,
the Stanford proxy will, in
keeping with general practice, be
given to GM management. The
University owns about 24,000
shares of GM stock.
The trustees were met in San
Francisco by about thirty
Stanford students with leaflets
and picket signs.
The students picketed
peacefully as the men filed into
the Pacific Mutual Building at
Kearney and California streets. A
dozen students attempted to
speak with the trustees as they
met but were refused.
Past Policy Cited
An ad hoc committee report
recommended the action noting
that by past policy "the Stanford
Board would give to management
the proxy covering the
University's General Motors stock.
However, the trustees note the
strong Stanford student and
faculty views on these proposals,

and recognize the sincerity with
which they are held."
The report continued, "In the
urgent press of events at Stanford
during the past several weeks, the
current ad hoc committee has
been unable to investigate and
consider adequately the issues
involved in these new problems."
Individuals Opposed
At the committee meeting held
Monday, a number of individual
trustees expressed firm opposition
to the Nader proposals. They felt
that GM management was
adequately pursuing solving
problems of environmental
quality such as air pollution.
However, the majority of the
trustees were persuaded by the
arguments of students and faculty
that the campus felt quite
strongly on the proposals as
evidenced by the student
referendum on them. In that
election, students supported both
of the Nader proposals by margins
of about 5 to 1.
The proposal adopted by the
committee was a compromise that
presumably would show that the
trustees have concern for feelings
on campus but would still not give
the endorsement to the Nader
initiative.
A number of the trustees
thought that the proposals were
fatally flawed in their approach
since they were seen as hostile to
the company. It was felt that this
is not a good wav to get reform.

One trustee was even reported
to have said the proposals are
"morally wrong."
Majority Opposed
It seemed clear that the
majority of the members of the
board were individually opposed
to the initiatives. Although the
committee report said, "Indeed,
trustees individually share the
view that our society needs to
take more effective steps to
protect our evnrionment by
assuring both cleaner air and
clearer water."
According to "The Chronicle of
Higher Education," rin
independent weekly, the
University of Pennsylvania has
given the chairman of its
investment committee "authority
and discretion" to vote their
29,000 share proxy for the Nader
proposals, but did not bind him to
support these measures.
Antioch College, which owns
1,000 shares, is expected to
support the proposals. Governing
boards of the Universities of
California, Michigan and Texas
have rejected the proposals. MIT,
Harvard, and Yale are considering
the initiative.
