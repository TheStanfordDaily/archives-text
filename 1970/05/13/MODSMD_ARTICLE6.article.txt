# Radical 'Bookkeeping’
## Administrator Hits ‘Rhetoric' 
### Kenneth Creighton 
Under the heading "Strikers
Blast Ly~nan Distortions," The
Daily carried a column on May
11, 1970, purporting to discredit
the Provost's remarks of the
previous evening. In those
remarks, he stressed the financial
consequences of the present
strike. Those consequences are
real, the rhetoric of the Strike
Steering Committee cannot undo
or abate them, and the false
statements which the rhetoric
surrounds need to be set straight.
The article suggests that a
rearrangement of bookkeeping,
aided as necessary by
"temporarily" using reserves, can
postpone the need for reducing
expenditures; i.e., the need for
terminating workers. This is not
true for the following reasons:
a. The government and many
foundations make payments
reimbursing the University for
expenses incurred under research
and training grants and contracts;
payment of invoices to secure that
reimbursement depends upon
certifications that the work in fact
has been done. In essence, if the
University is unable to
demonstrate to the sponsor's

satisfaction that the work they are
supporting has been performed
during the time period for which
the grant or contract specifies, the
University must bear the burden
of those costs from its
unrestricted reserves.
b. Contrary to the Strike
Steering Committee's assertion,
the closing of AEL in April, 1969,
did prevent the University from
obtaining reimbursement for the
salaries otherwise chargeable to
AEL contracts and grants,
including some non-DOD projects.
The resulting payroll and staff
benefits, totalling $1 16,000, were
borne by the University general
funds; this figure, of course, does
not include any, of the extra costs
to the University of the sit-in
itself. In addition, by not being
able to charge those payrolls, the
University lost indirect cost
reimbursement to the general
fund of $60,000.
Significantly Less
c. The article suggests that the
University "temporarily" use
portions of the $4.5 million cash
shown as on hand in banks or
"portions" of the $6 million ob

bonds labeled as current assets in
the annual report for the year
ending August 31, 1969. At best
this is a gross oversimplification.
The authors apparently
overlooked $10 million in then
outstanding payables that were in
part to be covered by this $10.5
million in cash and bonds.
Unfortunately, significantly less
than $8.3 million was actually
legally free to be used to pay
these bills.
d. The authors state that
corporate giving will not be
stopped by the strike. To the
extend that the Controller's
Office remains open, checks that
arrive in the 'nail can be
deposited. With the General
Secretary's Office n Rncina Hall
only partly able to function,
however, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to maintain
the solicitation process which
secures these funds.
e. The authors state that the
earnings of $6.5 million from
unrestricted endowment assets is a
sum which may be expended at
the discretion of the
administration. This statement is
totally incorrect. Unrestricted
investment income is one of the
major sources of funds to support
the current operating and
instructional budget just as are
tuition and alumni and corporate
gifts. These funds are expended in
accordance with the University
budget on a daily basis as they are
received. These funds of course
help support the faculty and staff
salaries, just as do our research
and training contracts and grants.
Interest Necessary
Cash now needed for immediate
expenditure is invested in
short-term notes: the interest thus
earned is also used to support the
curr- nt level of University
o tions.

The University's unrestricted
reserve has been programmed for
expenditure over the next seve I
years in conjunction with ,i
Budget Adjustment Prograrr I,d

budget cuts would have h;

the closing of AEL in April, 1969,
did prevent the University from
obtaining reimbursement for the
salaries otherwise chargeable to
AEL contracts and grants,
including some non-DOD projects.
The resulting payroll and staff
benefits, totalling $1 16,000, were
borne by the University general
funds; this figure, of course, does
not include any, of the extra costs

able to charge those payrolls, the
University lost indirect cost
reimbursement to the general
fund of $60,000.

University "temporarily" use
portions of the $4.5 million cash
shown as on hand in banks or
"portions" of the $6 million ob

this is a gross oversimplification.
The authors apparently
overlooked $10 million in then
outstanding payables that were in

these bills.

the solicitation process which

earnings of $6.5 million from
unrestricted endowment assets is a
sum which may be expended at
the discretion of the
administration. This statement is
totally incorrect. Unrestricted
investment income is one of the
major sources of funds to support
the current operating and
instructional budget just as are
tuition and alumni and corporate
gifts. These funds are expended in
accordance with the University
budget on a daily basis as they are
received. These funds of course
help support the faculty and staff
salaries, just as do our research

Under the heading "Strikers
Blast Ly~nan Distortions," The
Daily carried a column on May
11, 1970, purporting to discredit
the Provost's remarks of the
previous evening. In those
remarks, he stressed the financial
consequences of the present
strike. Those consequences are
real, the rhetoric of the Strike
Steering Committee cannot undo
or abate them, and the false
statements which the rhetoric
surrounds need to be set straight.
The article suggests that a
rearrangement of bookkeeping,
aided as necessary by
"temporarily" using reserves, can
postpone the need for reducing
expenditures; i.e., the need for
terminating workers. This is not
true for the following reasons:
a. The government and many
foundations make payments
reimbursing the University for
expenses incurred under research
and training grants and contracts;
payment of invoices to secure that
reimbursement depends upon
certifications that the work in fact
has been done. In essence, if the
University is unable to
demonstrate to the sponsor's

satisfaction that the work they are
supporting has been performed
during the time period for which
the grant or contract specifies, the
University must bear the burden
of those costs from its
unrestricted reserves.

Office remains open, checks that

increasingly difficult to maintain
the solicitation process which
secures these funds.
e. The authors state that the
earnings of $6.5 million from
unrestricted endowment assets is a
sum which may be expended at
the discretion of the
administration. This statement is
totally incorrect. Unrestricted
investment income is one of the
major sources of funds to support
the current operating and
instructional budget just as are
tuition and alumni and corporate
gifts. These funds are expended in
accordance with the University
budget on a daily basis as they are
received. These funds of course
help support the faculty and staff
salaries, just as do our research
and training contracts and grants.
Interest Necessary
Cash now needed for immediate
expenditure is invested in
short-term notes: the interest thus
earned is also used to support the
curr- nt level of University
o tions.

The University's unrestricted
reserve has been programmed for
expenditure over the next seve I
years in conjunction with ,i
