## The 						Myth Of Apolitical Universities 
### Michael Gevers 
As an engineer, I would like to respond to
the article published by Raymond White in
Friday's Daily: "Political Stands
Inappropriate," because it raises a very
important issue, which seems to bother us
engineers and scientists so much more than
the rest of the academic community.
The central question raised seems to be:
"It has never been the place of universities to
act as political units . . . My tuition is
supporting professors who will misrepresent
me in whatever way they "represent" the
university politically. This is a violation of my
political rights ... If this organization is not
free of political efforts of its own, then I am
its political prisoner."
Having lived for more than 6 years amidst
engineers, let me immediately say that I have
heard this argument over and over again, and
for a long time I agreed with it. Indeed I felt
that by taking political stands, the student
association of my university in Louvain,
France overstepped its responsibilities which
were—l felt—to serve the students and to
relate to specific university problems.
I have long lived with the idea—that has
been so constantly instilled in us by the
parents, the media, the authority in
general—that the duty of the students is to
study and not to participate in political
activities. And certainly by studying
electronics, chemistry, biology, etc . . . people
are sincerely convinced that they do not act as
political persons, that they are not responsible
at all for the harm, the crimes, the injustice
that other people commit. IN THEIR
NAMES.
Misunderstandings
Having found myself, as engineer, in
increasing conflict with people in Economy,
History, Sociology, Psychology, Philosophy,
etc ... on this and related questions, having
seen as surely most of you engineers have seen
a gap of misunderstanding grow between
engineers on one side and people from
Humanities and Social Sciences on the other
side, I decided to try to find out what the
reason for this misunderstanding was.
I have come to realize that the idea that by
just doing our professional job, we do not
commit ourselves politically is a great myth.
The idea that the university is an apolitical
institution is an even greater myth.
Before I expand on this point, let me first
answer the question that arises immediately,
namely: "Why do we, pure and applied

scientists particularly, think that a pure
devotion to our technical jobs is an apolitical
act?" The answer is simple: "Because we have
been and are still brought up to think so."
Responsible For World Wars
In the last 60 years, our western society
has been increasingly dominated by the
technology that we, engineers have produced.
At the same time we have had two world wars
and a great number of other wars where the
technology that we have producer has been
responsible for the killing of tens of millions
of human beings. (Almost one million in
Vietnam alone.)
Meanwhile, we continue to do the research
that directly or indirectly produces all these
"wonderful gadgets" with which other people
are killed, and we continue to think that we
are not responsible for the killings because we
do not push the button. Why do we think
this? BECAUSE WE ARE CONDITIONED
TO!
The industry needs us. At the same time
technology was winning its place in the last 60
years, the universities have been changing
from centers of free research and
philosophical thinking to big professional
schools. We are told every day that we should
learn chemistry, electronics, systems, biology,
physics without exercising critical thought on
the world around us, BECAUSE IT WOULD
BE A TRADEGY FOR OUR WHOLE
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEM IF
THE ENGINEERS START THINKING. The
chances are, indeed, that they might think
justly.
Start Thinking
We are told that by demonstrating for
peace we play politics but by keeping silent in
our labs we do not. This is utterly wrong. It is
in the interest of the corporations to keep us
silent, because if we engineers start thinking
and speaking out, we will no longer be that
marvellous technical tool which can be used
for all purposes.
It is very hard for those of us who do not
study behavioral sciences to realize how we
have been conditioned in a very specific way.
Let me give you some examples.
When I was a boy, I read in "Tintin", the
most widely published color magazine for
children in Europe, some fascinating stories
about the CIA agents who uncovered some
guerilla leaders in Brazil and Guatemala and,
after a heroic pu>*uit, killed the leaders and

saved the government from a criminal plot. It
took me many years to realize that these CIA
agents were the "bad guys" working for
military dictatorships.
Hoover's Infantilism
The myth of a communist plot against the
U.S., recently illustrated so well by E
Hoover's infantile statements on the Vietnan
Moratoriums, is another example of t.e
conditioning of our minds.
The idea that the G.l.'s are the"i joci
guys" who protect the people all ov the
world has been so constantly . ■ us in
the European schools that it has t . • • >-
a long time to realize that the j.
Dresden, Hiroshima, and My Lai tax »i
We are constantly told not to and
we are constantly told that by not sj-eakiug
out we and our institutions do not commit
themselves politically. This is a form of moral
slavery that we have long accepted because
lethargy and silence form the easiest response.
Raymond White says that when the University
condemns the invasion in Cambodia, it makes
him -and , with him a minority of
people -political prisoners.
While keeping silent, however, is the
University not an accompolice to
theunconstiti-tional decisions of Mr. Nixon
and does it no* make a majority of its
members political prisoners? Worse still, when
President Nixon warns Hanoi that, the people
of this country are determined to fight this
war in his manner, doesn't he make the many
millions of dissenters political prisoners?
Accomplices
I think every action of our university, our
department and of each of us, be it vocal or
silent, is a political act. We should therefore
all speak out and say where we
stand -majority and minority. And since most
of us agree that the invasion of Cambodia is
immoral and unjustified, it is our
responsibility to act. We should thus use the
non-violent strike that is proposed and devote
all our energies to restore a normal,
democratic decision-making process that
would undoubtedly reverse this tragic
decision. By keeping silent in our labs we
would be an accomplice to that decision.
Instead of going to work, please read,
listen, and lecrn what has really happened in
South East Asia; then spread the word.

and does it no* make a majority of its
members political prisoners? Worse still, when
President Nixon warns Hanoi that, the people
of this country are determined to fight this
war in his manner, doesn't he make the many
millions of dissenters political prisoners?
Accomplices
I think every action of our university, our
department and of each of us, be it vocal or
silent, is a political act. We should therefore
all speak out and say where we
stand -majority and minority. And since most
of us agree that the invasion of Cambodia is
immoral and unjustified, it is our
responsibility to act. We should thus use the
non-violent strike that is proposed and devote
all our energies to restore a normal,
democratic decision-making process that
would undoubtedly reverse this tragic
decision. By keeping silent in our labs we
would be an accomplice to that decision.
Instead of going to work, please read,
listen, and lecrn what has really happened in
South East Asia; then spread the word.

As an engineer, I would like to respond to
the article published by Raymond White in
Friday's Daily: "Political Stands
Inappropriate," because it raises a very
important issue, which seems to bother us
engineers and scientists so much more than
the rest of the academic community.
The central question raised seems to be:
"It has never been the place of universities to
act as political units . . . My tuition is
supporting professors who will misrepresent
me in whatever way they "represent" the
university politically. This is a violation of my
political rights ... If this organization is not
free of political efforts of its own, then I am
its political prisoner."
Having lived for more than 6 years amidst
engineers, let me immediately say that I have
heard this argument over and over again, and
for a long time I agreed with it. Indeed I felt
that by taking political stands, the student
association of my university in Louvain,
France overstepped its responsibilities which
were—l felt—to serve the students and to
relate to specific university problems.
I have long lived with the idea—that has
been so constantly instilled in us by the
parents, the media, the authority in
general—that the duty of the students is to
study and not to participate in political
activities. And certainly by studying
electronics, chemistry, biology, etc . . . people
are sincerely convinced that they do not act as
political persons, that they are not responsible
at all for the harm, the crimes, the injustice
that other people commit. IN THEIR
NAMES.
Misunderstandings
Having found myself, as engineer, in
increasing conflict with people in Economy,
History, Sociology, Psychology, Philosophy,
etc ... on this and related questions, having
seen as surely most of you engineers have seen
a gap of misunderstanding grow between
engineers on one side and people from
Humanities and Social Sciences on the other
side, I decided to try to find out what the
reason for this misunderstanding was.
I have come to realize that the idea that by
just doing our professional job, we do not
commit ourselves politically is a great myth.
The idea that the university is an apolitical
institution is an even greater myth.
Before I expand on this point, let me first
answer the question that arises immediately,
namely: "Why do we, pure and applied

scientists particularly, think that a pure
devotion to our technical jobs is an apolitical
act?" The answer is simple: "Because we have
been and are still brought up to think so."
Responsible For World Wars
In the last 60 years, our western society
has been increasingly dominated by the
technology that we, engineers have produced.
At the same time we have had two world wars
and a great number of other wars where the
technology that we have producer has been
responsible for the killing of tens of millions
of human beings. (Almost one million in
Vietnam alone.)
Meanwhile, we continue to do the research
that directly or indirectly produces all these
"wonderful gadgets" with which other people
are killed, and we continue to think that we
are not responsible for the killings because we
do not push the button. Why do we think
this? BECAUSE WE ARE CONDITIONED
TO!
The industry needs us. At the same time
technology was winning its place in the last 60
years, the universities have been changing
from centers of free research and
philosophical thinking to big professional
schools. We are told every day that we should
learn chemistry, electronics, systems, biology,
physics without exercising critical thought on
the world around us, BECAUSE IT WOULD
BE A TRADEGY FOR OUR WHOLE
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEM IF
THE ENGINEERS START THINKING. The
chances are, indeed, that they might think
justly.
Start Thinking
We are told that by demonstrating for
peace we play politics but by keeping silent in
our labs we do not. This is utterly wrong. It is
in the interest of the corporations to keep us
silent, because if we engineers start thinking
and speaking out, we will no longer be that
marvellous technical tool which can be used
for all purposes.
It is very hard for those of us who do not
study behavioral sciences to realize how we
have been conditioned in a very specific way.
Let me give you some examples.
When I was a boy, I read in "Tintin", the
most widely published color magazine for
children in Europe, some fascinating stories
about the CIA agents who uncovered some
guerilla leaders in Brazil and Guatemala and,
after a heroic pu>*uit, killed the leaders and

saved the government from a criminal plot. It
took me many years to realize that these CIA
agents were the "bad guys" working for
military dictatorships.
Hoover's Infantilism
The myth of a communist plot against the
U.S., recently illustrated so well by E
Hoover's infantile statements on the Vietnan
Moratoriums, is another example of t.e
conditioning of our minds.
The idea that the G.l.'s are the"i joci
guys" who protect the people all ov the
world has been so constantly . ■ us in
the European schools that it has t . • • >-
a long time to realize that the j.
Dresden, Hiroshima, and My Lai tax »i
We are constantly told not to and
we are constantly told that by not sj-eakiug
out we and our institutions do not commit
themselves politically. This is a form of moral
slavery that we have long accepted because
lethargy and silence form the easiest response.
Raymond White says that when the University
condemns the invasion in Cambodia, it makes
him -and , with him a minority of
people -political prisoners.
While keeping silent, however, is the
University not an accompolice to
theunconstiti-tional decisions of Mr. Nixon
and does it no* make a majority of its
members political prisoners? Worse still, when
President Nixon warns Hanoi that, the people
of this country are determined to fight this

The myth of a communist plot against the
U.S., recently illustrated so well by E
Hoover's infantile statements on the Vietnan
Moratoriums, is another example of t.e
conditioning of our minds.
The idea that the G.l.'s are the"i joci
guys" who protect the people all ov the
world has been so constantly . ■ us in
the European schools that it has t . • • >-
a long time to realize that the j.
Dresden, Hiroshima, and My Lai tax »i
We are constantly told not to and
we are constantly told that by not sj-eakiug
out we and our institutions do not commit
themselves politically. This is a form of moral
slavery that we have long accepted because
lethargy and silence form the easiest response.
Raymond White says that when the University
condemns the invasion in Cambodia, it makes
him -and , with him a minority of
people -political prisoners.
While keeping silent, however, is the
University not an accompolice to
theunconstiti-tional decisions of Mr. Nixon
and does it no* make a majority of its
members political prisoners? Worse still, when
President Nixon warns Hanoi that, the people
of this country are determined to fight this
war in his manner, doesn't he make the many
millions of dissenters political prisoners?
Accomplices
I think every action of our university, our
department and of each of us, be it vocal or
silent, is a political act. We should therefore
all speak out and say where we
stand -majority and minority. And since most
of us agree that the invasion of Cambodia is
immoral and unjustified, it is our
responsibility to act. We should thus use the
non-violent strike that is proposed and devote
all our energies to restore a normal,
democratic decision-making process that
would undoubtedly reverse this tragic
decision. By keeping silent in our labs we
would be an accomplice to that decision.
Instead of going to work, please read,
listen, and lecrn what has really happened in
South East Asia; then spread the word.

As an engineer, I would like to respond to
the article published by Raymond White in
Friday's Daily: "Political Stands
Inappropriate," because it raises a very
important issue, which seems to bother us
engineers and scientists so much more than
the rest of the academic community.
The central question raised seems to be:
"It has never been the place of universities to
act as political units . . . My tuition is
supporting professors who will misrepresent
me in whatever way they "represent" the
university politically. This is a violation of my
political rights ... If this organization is not
free of political efforts of its own, then I am
its political prisoner."
Having lived for more than 6 years amidst
engineers, let me immediately say that I have
heard this argument over and over again, and
for a long time I agreed with it. Indeed I felt
that by taking political stands, the student
association of my university in Louvain,
France overstepped its responsibilities which
were—l felt—to serve the students and to
relate to specific university problems.
I have long lived with the idea—that has
been so constantly instilled in us by the
parents, the media, the authority in
general—that the duty of the students is to
study and not to participate in political
activities. And certainly by studying
electronics, chemistry, biology, etc . . . people
are sincerely convinced that they do not act as
political persons, that they are not responsible
at all for the harm, the crimes, the injustice
that other people commit. IN THEIR
NAMES.
Misunderstandings
Having found myself, as engineer, in
increasing conflict with people in Economy,
History, Sociology, Psychology, Philosophy,
etc ... on this and related questions, having
seen as surely most of you engineers have seen
a gap of misunderstanding grow between
engineers on one side and people from
Humanities and Social Sciences on the other
side, I decided to try to find out what the
reason for this misunderstanding was.
I have come to realize that the idea that by
just doing our professional job, we do not
commit ourselves politically is a great myth.
The idea that the university is an apolitical
institution is an even greater myth.
Before I expand on this point, let me first
answer the question that arises immediately,
namely: "Why do we, pure and applied

scientists particularly, think that a pure
devotion to our technical jobs is an apolitical
act?" The answer is simple: "Because we have
been and are still brought up to think so."
Responsible For World Wars
In the last 60 years, our western society
has been increasingly dominated by the
technology that we, engineers have produced.
At the same time we have had two world wars
and a great number of other wars where the
technology that we have producer has been
responsible for the killing of tens of millions
of human beings. (Almost one million in
Vietnam alone.)
Meanwhile, we continue to do the research
that directly or indirectly produces all these
"wonderful gadgets" with which other people
are killed, and we continue to think that we
are not responsible for the killings because we
do not push the button. Why do we think
this? BECAUSE WE ARE CONDITIONED
TO!
The industry needs us. At the same time
technology was winning its place in the last 60
years, the universities have been changing
from centers of free research and
philosophical thinking to big professional
schools. We are told every day that we should
learn chemistry, electronics, systems, biology,
physics without exercising critical thought on
the world around us, BECAUSE IT WOULD
BE A TRADEGY FOR OUR WHOLE
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEM IF
THE ENGINEERS START THINKING. The
chances are, indeed, that they might think
justly.
Start Thinking
We are told that by demonstrating for
peace we play politics but by keeping silent in
our labs we do not. This is utterly wrong. It is
in the interest of the corporations to keep us
silent, because if we engineers start thinking
and speaking out, we will no longer be that
marvellous technical tool which can be used
for all purposes.
It is very hard for those of us who do not
study behavioral sciences to realize how we
have been conditioned in a very specific way.
Let me give you some examples.
When I was a boy, I read in "Tintin", the
most widely published color magazine for
children in Europe, some fascinating stories
about the CIA agents who uncovered some
guerilla leaders in Brazil and Guatemala and,
after a heroic pu>*uit, killed the leaders and

saved the government from a criminal plot. It
took me many years to realize that these CIA
agents were the "bad guys" working for
military dictatorships.
