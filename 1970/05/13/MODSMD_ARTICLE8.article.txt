Students throw rocks,
Guardsmen fire shots.
The kind that kill,
Like in a war.
These shots kill four.
It could've been me,
It could've been you.
Think about it.
What should we do?
Who caused these deaths?
The President
Blames the violence
Of student dissent.
I blame the violence
Of the President
In Cambodia
And in the rest
Of Southeast Asia.
Bullets returned
The rocks they threw.
It could've been me,
It could've been you.
Think about it.
What should we do?
SHUT IT DOWN!

I Want To Cry
Why no tears, why no tears,
Will fall from my eyes?
I saw them out there.
1 was out there.
I saw it all—the people,
The students, the police.
I saw the rocks, the windows,
The windows break.
I saw the glistening sweat
And the wild eyes of the hurlers.
I heard the shouts, the obscenities,
Those words—"pigs," "fuckers," "ass-holes
"Off R.0.T.C., kill the nigs,"
"Kill the mother-fuckers.'
And still I could not cry.
"The pigs are coming!"
The people ran—the leaders,
The sympathizers, the observers.
They all run.
And in the darkness they seemed
All the same. Who could tell those
Who have wanted to burn,
Who have wanted to kill,
From those who merely wanted to watch
The arsons burn, the murderers kill.
Wlio could say which ones were worse?
And still there were no tears.
1 watched the students slowly return.
"Regroup," "stay together and kill the pigs
False alarm.
There were no "pigs." Only a firecracker.
Only a student playing a joke.
And a student smiled. "Wow, that wits groo
"That was great. But, hey, no rocks,
No rocks, ok?"
The answer came in cracking glass.
"To Encina!" "Keep moving!"
And the mass moved like a wave,
A wave of locusts.
In a minute . . . they were gone.
And the night seemed peaceful.
I could not talk. 1 did not want to.
I only stared, blankly.

Into the open spaces of the night.
And still . . . still I could . . . not . . .
Oh GOD! Oh GOD!
My eyes are blurred,
I cannot see!
God help us, lor we know
not what we do . . .

Our leader has made a bad mistake.
Which set so many lives at stake.
He sent us to another war.
People dying more and more.
Young and old, friend and foe.
Pryed, criod, and screamed. "No."
Four young people wanted peace.
And tried to get wars to cease.
But their bodys were bullet fed.
National guardsmen shot them dead.
The newspaper stories people read.
Told of our who cared ana now are dead.

When 'H<'' was elected as the chief,
I threw up my arms in grief;
I still hoped, somehow,
He would keep his campaign premise.
'He' promised a 'Secret Plan',
To end the war in Vietnam,
With peace, honor and grace;
But he jumped into Cambodia;
To escalate the public phobia.
'He'promised 'Black Capitalism',
To abolish ghetto anachronism,
With law, order and force;
Bui he attacked desegregation ism
To feed racial antagonism.
'He' promised to 'Bring Us Together',
With force and whatever rest it takes,
He sure has earned oui applause.
For a job so well done,
'Cause no body has bones, anymore.

"Regroup," "stay together and kill the pigs
False alarm.
There were no "pigs." Only a firecracker.
Only a student playing a joke.

No rocks, ok?"

Our leader has made a bad mistake.
Which set so many lives at stake.
He sent us to another war.
People dying more and more.
Young and old, friend and foe.
Pryed, criod, and screamed. "No."
Four young people wanted peace.
And tried to get wars to cease.
But their bodys were bullet fed.
National guardsmen shot them dead.
The newspaper stories people read.
Told of our who cared ana now are dead.

When 'H<'' was elected as the chief,
I threw up my arms in grief;
I still hoped, somehow,
He would keep his campaign premise.
'He' promised a 'Secret Plan',
To end the war in Vietnam,
With peace, honor and grace;
But he jumped into Cambodia;
To escalate the public phobia.
'He'promised 'Black Capitalism',
To abolish ghetto anachronism,
With law, order and force;
Bui he attacked desegregation ism
To feed racial antagonism.
'He' promised to 'Bring Us Together',
With force and whatever rest it takes,
He sure has earned oui applause.
For a job so well done,
'Cause no body has bones, anymore.

Why no tears, why no tears,
Will fall from my eyes?
I saw them out there.
1 was out there.
I saw it all—the people,
The students, the police.
I saw the rocks, the windows,
The windows break.
I saw the glistening sweat
And the wild eyes of the hurlers.
I heard the shouts, the obscenities,
Those words—"pigs," "fuckers," "ass-holes
"Off R.0.T.C., kill the nigs,"
"Kill the mother-fuckers.'
And still I could not cry.
"The pigs are coming!"
The people ran—the leaders,
The sympathizers, the observers.
They all run.
And in the darkness they seemed
All the same. Who could tell those
Who have wanted to burn,
Who have wanted to kill,
From those who merely wanted to watch
The arsons burn, the murderers kill.
Wlio could say which ones were worse?
And still there were no tears.
