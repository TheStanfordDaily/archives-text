Innuendos
Editor, The Daily :
The most perverse form of
journalism is that which relies on
innuendo, a prime example of
which was the article on NROTC
and admissions, captioned
"Cadets: Lower Standards?" and
written by Bill Evers (DAILY,
May 7). It was a cheap shot and
one entirely without substance.
Each of the thirty-four
students admitted to Stanford this
year who later were awarded
NROTC scholarships is, in fact,
highly qualified academically.
Their records compare very
favorably in all respects with

other members of the class and
with students now enrolled at
Stanford. While such records are
obviously confidential, I would be
very happy to discuss with Mr.
Evers just how his own record
upon entering Stanford stacks up
against each of the NROTC
a w ardrecipients, without
exception, admitted to Stanford
this year.

"A move constructive, and less
ad li online m approach by the
admissions office, might be {if the
allegations of the faculty members
who once studied the admissions
process are without validity) to go
back to find out where the
misapprehensions arose."

Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford A.F.T. approved

the following resolution at its
meeting on May 11:
"The Stanford A.F.T., Local
1816, strongly supports the
National Student Strike. We
endorse the Yale demands: U.S.
out of Southeast Asia; justice in
America-free all political
prisoners; off ROTC:end
Department of Defense contracts.
"The AFT has long recognized
the necessity for a radical
restructuring of university
finances in order for Stanford to
serve the real needs of the
American people. The engineering
laboratories are the most blatant
case of defense department
control of university funding.
"We emphasize the importance
of protecting untenured staff.
These workers should not be the
first to suffer when funds are cut.
We will actively support U.S.E.
and any individual workers who

are penalized because of strike
activity.
"To implement our beliefs, we
are joining the Medical School
committee in its call for a national
work stoppage. We will work with
local labor unions to effect a
national general strike.
"We also call upon all of our
members to join the strike in
closing the engineering labs. The
A.F.T. will be on the picket line,
as a union, from 8 am to noon,
Tuesdays and Thursdays."

your student president tell

there is too much of a

All you need to do is write

How come there was no clamor
heretofore about the North Viets
being in Cambodia. . . long before
our "invasion?"

This evening (May 8) I heard
your student president tell
Howard K. Smith, of ABC, that
there is too much of a
communications gap from
students, faculty, and staff to the
government.
All you need to do is write
letters to your officials with
improvements.

before U.S. troops.

Innuendos
Editor, The Daily :
The most perverse form of
journalism is that which relies on
innuendo, a prime example of
which was the article on NROTC
and admissions, captioned
"Cadets: Lower Standards?" and
written by Bill Evers (DAILY,
May 7). It was a cheap shot and
one entirely without substance.
Each of the thirty-four
students admitted to Stanford this
year who later were awarded
NROTC scholarships is, in fact,
highly qualified academically.
Their records compare very
favorably in all respects with

other members of the class and
with students now enrolled at
Stanford. While such records are
obviously confidential, I would be
very happy to discuss with Mr.
Evers just how his own record
upon entering Stanford stacks up
against each of the NROTC
a w ardrecipients, without
exception, admitted to Stanford
this year.

Evers reply:
"A move constructive, and less
ad li online m approach by the
admissions office, might be {if the
allegations of the faculty members
who once studied the admissions
process are without validity) to go
back to find out where the
misapprehensions arose."
A.h. T. On Strike
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford A.F.T. approved

the following resolution at its
meeting on May 11:
"The Stanford A.F.T., Local
1816, strongly supports the
National Student Strike. We
endorse the Yale demands: U.S.
out of Southeast Asia; justice in
America-free all political
prisoners; off ROTC:end
Department of Defense contracts.
"The AFT has long recognized
the necessity for a radical
restructuring of university
finances in order for Stanford to
serve the real needs of the
American people. The engineering
laboratories are the most blatant
case of defense department
control of university funding.
"We emphasize the importance
of protecting untenured staff.
These workers should not be the
first to suffer when funds are cut.
We will actively support U.S.E.
and any individual workers who

are penalized because of strike
activity.
"To implement our beliefs, we
are joining the Medical School
committee in its call for a national
work stoppage. We will work with
local labor unions to effect a
national general strike.
"We also call upon all of our
members to join the strike in
closing the engineering labs. The
A.F.T. will be on the picket line,
as a union, from 8 am to noon,
Tuesdays and Thursdays."

To the striking students,

repugnance at the obscenities of
