SO THAT HE CAN CONTINUE TO
• Advocate immediate withdrawal of all troops from Vietnam and oppose U.S. involvement in
Cambodia and Laos.
• Lead the conservation and environmental protection movements in Congress.
• Oppose the ABM and unchecked military spending.
PETE'S WELL-FINANCED CONSERVATIVE PRIMARY OPPONENT HAS SAID:
• He supports President Nixon's actions in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
• He believes the Earth Day rallies were "a lot of adolescents out screaming."
• He supports full deployment of the ABM.
