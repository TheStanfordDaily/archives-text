We do nice things for students.
And their pocketbooks.
r------
I We know student travel is important. But expensive. So
■ we're helping to bring down the cost. For example, you |
can have a $21 room at the Conrad Hilton Hotel in _
I Chicago for just $9. And rooms at similar reduced rates '
■ at 60 other Hilton Hotels and Inns from Oregon to |
Florida.
| So, if you're a student, let us know. Fill out this cou- I
pon and send it to Hilton Hotels Corporation, Travel ■
■ Department, National Sales Division, The Palmer House,
| Chicago, Illinois 60690. I
We'll send you a pamphlet listing the hotels and inns ■
I participating in our special rates program, and an offi
■ cial Hilton Student Identification Card to use when you |
register.
