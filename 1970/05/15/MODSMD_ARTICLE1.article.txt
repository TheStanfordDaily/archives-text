### 
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) Two
students were killed and 10 others
were injured, two of thctn
critically, officials reported, when
highway patrolmen and city
police opened fire earl} today on
the campus of all-black -'ackson
State College.
Most of the injured had
gun-shot wounds.
Officers fired at a dormitory
after they said someone had fired
at them.
One highway patrolman was
injured and was taken to the
Hinds County Hospital.
A heavy, concentrated barrage
of gunfire, lasting seven to 10
seconds, was directed at the

building. Students in front of the
building dropped to the ground to
take cover.
Many of the windows of the
â€¢our-story dormitory were shot
out.
Students looked out of the
windows of other dormitories and
screamed at the officers.
Earlier Friday, National Guard
troops moved onto the campus
after rock- and bottle-throwing
erupted for the second straight
night.
In a related development, it was
learned Wednesday that the six
blacks killed in Augusta, Ga.
rioting Monday and Tuesday were
shot in the back.

Dr. Irvine Phinizy, chief
medical examiner for Richmond
county, said that one of the men
was shot at least nine times.
Another suffered eight wounds,
another five, and two more were
shot twice.
Only one of the victims had
been shot once.
Tuesday, the police department
said that five of the six killed were
shot by police while the other had
died of gunshot wounds from an
undetermined origin.
Spokesmen for the university
hospital, where three of the
victims died, said at least two had
received chest wounds. Phinizy
said none of the dead had frontal

wounds except for exit wounds.
"I'm not a ballistics expert," he
said, "but in my judgement those
people were shot from behind and

not from the front ..."
The beating death of a black
youth in jail set off the Augusta
turmoil.
