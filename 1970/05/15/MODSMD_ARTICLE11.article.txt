# What Education Can Be
## Help SWOPSI Do It 
### Sue Block 
Despite rumors to the contrary,
Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues will continue
next year in a temporary alliance
with the Student Center for
Innovation. The Student Center
Policy Board will oversee the
general organization of the
SWOPSI program, will hire a
director for SWOPSI for next
year, and will grant credit to all
SWOPSI courses.
In addition, the Policy Board,
in conjunction with SWOPSI's
director and interested students
and faculty, will formulate a plan
for SWOPSI's continuation
beyond next year, possibly as the
Stanford Institute for the Study
of Political and Social Issues, an
autonomous teaching and research
institute within the University.
A lot of learning has gone on at
Stanford in the past two weeks.
We have attended teach-ins,
engaged in discussions and
debates, and done a great deal of
thinking. It will be very easy,
though, to slip back into the oid
patterns and routines of passive
education. But having caught a
glimpse of what education can,
and should be, we can work to
make that educational ideal a
continuing process, one that will
not end with the strike, or with
this quarter.
SWOPSI is one chance to do
this. SWOPSI offers students an
opportunity to initiate courses
and determine the directions these
courses should take in seeking
solutions to social and political
problems, and provides an
opportunity for students and
faculty and community experts to
work together and learn together,
attacking problems in our society.
No Restraints
Workshops are free enough of
external structure to allow
students and faculty to exercise
imagination and initiative in

solving problems. Virtually all
new approaches and
action-oriented ideas are
encouraged, and are necessary if
SWOPSI is to remain a credible
program for social change.
Some groups may decide to
take action in the form of
published reports directed at
county officials, as did the people
involved in the Pescadero Dam
project; some groups will prefer to
challenge existing state policies, as
did the Logging Policy workshop;
some groups will find that the
establishment of a new, on-going
political or social action group is
the natural culmination of their
workshops, as did the workshop
on Industrialization and Housing
in the Mid-Peninsula, which
worked in liason with the United
Stanford Employees in exploring
the housing situation in the
Mid-Peninsula area; or, the
members of the workshop may
decide to become involved in
some sort of direct political
action, as is the Union Organizing
workshop, which is working to
organize the national student
strike.
SWOPSI provides an
opportunity for us to channel our
common concern, anger, and
energy into seeking solutions to
the human problems which we all
confront. What about a course on
police and student relations? Or a
course on civil disobedience as an
instrument of radical social
change? Or a course that would
research the relationship between
Department of Defense research
being done at Stanford, and the
capacity of the U.S. to make war?
All of these ideas represent the
kind of courses SWOPSI is trying
to encourage.
Student Input Vital
In order for SWOPSI to
continue to be innovative and

challenging and successful, the
involvement, ideas, and criticisms
of students are needed. Sometime
in the next few weeks, there will
be a meeting for students
interested in SWOPSI as a
mechanism for change within the
University. Come help us organize
courses for fall quarter. Bring us
your suggestions on how SWOPSI
might be made more responsive to
the needs of students and the
needs of the community. Help us
find people to teach courses.
Come with ideas of problems you
would like to see SWOPSI tackle.
SWOPSI's entire direction is
dependent on the people involved.
Working and learning together,
there is the possibility that
SWOPSI can be made into a
model for a new kind of
education that will capture the
spirit and energy of the past two
weeks. SWOPSI will continue, but
it is up to us to decide how and
wh ere.
