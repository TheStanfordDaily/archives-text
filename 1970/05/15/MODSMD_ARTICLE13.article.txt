# Basic Vs. Applied
## Research Harmful 
### Forrest Frank 
One of the most controversial
and confusing demands made by
the student strike is an end to
Department of Defense support
for research on campus. This
demand is based on the belief that
all DOD sponsored research is war
related and that DOD funding
entitles the Department of
Defense to unwarranted control
over the faculty member engaged
in such research. Many researchers
including Dr. Walter E. Meyerhof,
Professor of Physics take issue
with these two assumptions.
Scientists are quick to point
out the distinction between
applied and basic research.
Applied research is by its very
nature designed to produce a
predictable, usable result. Applied
research is supported with a
specific goal in sight, and
therefore, in the opinion of many,
the goal and the purpose of the
sponsoring agency or organization
should be carefully examined.
Basic research is significantly
different in qualitative terms.
Basic research is (or should be)
conducted openly, with
unrestricted access to data and
results. More importantly, basic
research leads to results that are

comparatively difficult to predict.
This is distinctly different from
applied research. Regardless of the
sponsorship and regardless of the
nature of research, the Pentagon
chooses to seek a military
application of applied or basic
research.
Why does the Department of
Defense sponsor basic research as
well as applied research if the
results of basic research are
significantly less likely to lead to a
militarily applicable discovery?
The answer to this question is
two-fold. First, there is infinite
hope in the Office of Defense
Research and Engineering that
basic research will yield results
with military applications.
Few Strings Attached
Second, the Department of
Defense is the only agency
authorized by Congress to sponsor
basic research with relatively few
strings attached to that research.
This is no fault of DOD and
Senator McClellan is attempting
to remedy this problem by
tightening the Mansfield
Amendment to make sure that
DOD does not sponsor
superfluous research. In the
meantime, DOD remains the
agency free to fund basic research,
and does so in a manner far more
lenient than other agencies or
foundations according to
Professor Meyerhof.
Professor Meyerhof and others
have been quick to point out that
DOD contracts are not given to
Stanford University but rather to
individual faculty members. There
are presently 134 DOD contracts
on campus involving 97 principal
investigators worth a total of
$14,439,000. In addition to these
contracts, there are some 55
proposed contracts involving 42
principal investigators worth
approximately $7,500,000.
The Research Administration
Office was quick to point out that
these contracts when dispatched
for initial approval by Washington
have been carefully studied to
make sure they comply with the
University's Research Policy and
before the contracts are finally
approved, they are reviewed again
to see that any changes in the
proposals have not violated the
Research Policy. The Research
Administration Office could not
provide a breakdown on number
and value of basic and applied
research contracts.
Moral Consciousness
Clearly, what we are dealing
with in a demand to end DOD
funding of on-campus research is
the sensitive issue of a faculty
member's moral consciousness.
Only each individual principal
investigator can answer why he
chose to seek DOD sponsorship
instead of Ford Foundation or
Health Education and Welfare
sponsorship.

The University derives
numerous financial benefits from
DOD contracts. Each of the DOD
contracts supports one or more
research assistants, and in addition
provides funds for other
universty employees.
Approximately one third of the
value of the contracts or 5 million
dollars are returned to the
University's general fund in
payment of indirect costs, and
these funds are redistributed
among all departments. In short,
DOD funds for contracts with
professors in the natural sciences
support to no small extent
programs in the humanities and
social sciences.
In discussing the demand for
elimination of all DOD sponsored
research on campus with Professor
Meyerhof and others, I have come
to believe that this demand is
inappropriate. It is inappropriate
because it does not guarantee
greater freedom from outside
control by funding organizations.
Foundation grants are not
infrequently tied by thick ropes,
not thin strings. Elimination of
DOD funding for all research
would not eliminate war related
research either, for much of the
war related research on campus is
funded by other agencies.
Funding the University
There are two separate issues
that should be examined. First is
the issue of funding for applied
research. It needs little
clarification to demand an end to
DOD funded applied research for
this research is destined for war
by virtue of the purpose of the
Department of Defense. What is
not as clear as DOD funded
applied research is that research
funded by Health, Education, and
Welfare or Housing and Urban
Development that lends itself very
readily to counter-insurgency
warfare. We must move to rid the
University of this applied research
as well as DOD funded research.
More importantly, we must ask
the Congress to provide better
ways of funding this and all other
universities. It says a great deal
about the funding of Universities
when each must guess as to how
much income it will derive from
research contracts and grants in
planning its budget each year. We
must earnestly answer the
question, what price the
University's soul given American
society today and begin to look
ahead to answering the same
question for the next generation.
Merely eliminating DOD
sponsorship of research on
campus will not eliminate
University complicity in the
present war effort but it will
succeed in leaving the more basic
and pervasive questions
unanswered.
