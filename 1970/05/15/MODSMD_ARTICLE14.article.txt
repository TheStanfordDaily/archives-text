# One Man's Fantasy
## A 						Revolting Engagement 
### Nick Selby 
Patrick A. Shea and I had
always gotten along pretty well. I
acknowledged him as a relatively
harmless bureaucrat, and he
always rubbed his gentle hand
through my dishevelled, curly
locks when he greeted me. We
were occasional good pals.
Tricia M. Nixon and I had
always gotten along pretty well
too. I used to sneak into the
White House after Dick and Pat
had gone to bed, and Tricia
greeted me with some pretzels and
orange drink as we watched
television together. We had some
good clean fun.
But this is the last straw, the
proverbial one that broke the
Cambodia's parrot beak.
My God Pat! did you have to
go and do this to me? Why?
WHY? And as for you Tricia, you
sneaky little two-timing bitch,
you can just forget about me ever
bothering to eat pretzels with you
again.
The Heartburn, The Pain
I can't begin to describe the
heartbreak, the terrible sense of
loss, 1 feel now. As I picked up
the I)ail > yesterday morning, a
terrible anger, an outrageous
jealousy, surged through me. Now
I just feel sort of empty inside,
bewildered and dispirited. Here I
thought I was going to marrv her!
Oh, oh, what a prideful fool I've
been.
You see, under the excuse of
retreating to Wickenburg, Ariz., to
recover my sanity, I was actually
flying to Washington to "make
time" with Tricia. We kept our
activities discreet, never venturing
out of the third floor television
room, except sometimes to go
bowling in the middle of the
night. I bowled and Tricia set up
tho pins.
How was I to know? I imagined
that Tricia was as much in love
with me as I was with her. She
was so sweet, so innocent, that I

was charmed off my feet the first
time we ever talked.
She was waiting in line to buy a
ticket for Walt Disney's "The
Absent-Minded Professor" and, a
bit shy at first, we shared our
Cracker Jacks in silence. "Daddy
wants to know what's happening
on campus," she said, "and I get
to tell the whole Cabinet." Fred
Mac Murray was starring.
Sighs of Delight
During the matinee, Tricia
rested her head against my
shoulder and sighed. It was the
first time a girl had ever done this
to me and I felt my heart
throbbing in nervous anticipation.
This could mean anything. I put
my arm around her and Tricia
sighed with delight. "She's
serious," I felt.
After the show, we made a date
to go see "One Hundred and One
Dalmatians," more wholesome
Disney entertainment. "I think
Daddy wants to see that one,"
Trish whispered softly in my ear,
"Daddy loves dogs. Maybe he'll
come along." I told her I hoped
so, and he did.
But after that second date, we
decided we had better not be seen
in public together. Tricia worried
the newsmen might get some bad
ideas about us. "I hate newsmen,"
Tricia swore, "They're not nice.
They're bums." So we stayed in
the White House and watched the
old movies on the Late Show. Our
love grew with every re-run.
How Shea 'Did If
What I can't understand, then,
is how Shea did it. I really
believed myself to be on the
"inside track," even though I
wasn't able to spend all my time
with her. One night, Tricia even
kissed my shoulder. Where did I
go wrong?
I don't know-maybe Shea
kissed her on the shoulder,
perhaps even some less accessible
portion of her anatomy. Maybe he

set up the pins while Tricia
bowled the balls down the old
alley. Maybe he secreted her away
to watch "The Sound of Music,"
or, the ultimate treat, "Mary
Poppins."
Whatever Shea did, he did it
behind my back, and I resent his
success where my suit failed. This
is the sort of thing that no man
who has ever been in love forgives
easily. I doubt I ever will.
Did you believe the
announcement in the Daily
yesterday. In my extreme grief
and despair, all I can say is no,
neither did I.
(Nick Selby was last seen
entering Buckingham Palace,
where he reports initial good favor
from Princess Anne. His accounts
of an extended courtship of
Caroline K. Onassis appear twice
each week in the DAILY.)
