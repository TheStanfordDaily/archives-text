# DOD Research
## Questions-Answers 
### Seb Doniach 
1. Is DOD research at Stanford connected to the "War Machine?"
I agree that the $15 million a year DOD money at Stanford
represents a considerable involvement with the war machine. However
the statement that after July Ist (as a result of the "Mansfield
Amendment") all DOD research on campus be for applied military
purposes is misleading. Although it was, I believe, Sen. Mansfield's
intention that this would be the case, in practice the DOD and the
Bureau of the Budget seem to be making a wider interpretation which
will not cut out all basic research, but only that in certain areas (e.g.,
high energy, nuclear and astro physics) whose possible applications are
fairly far from future military needs.
2. Should we try and back Senator Mansfield's proposals?
I agree that the military should not be allowed to gain indirect
political control over universities by their support of basic research on
campus. However, if one feels that the growth of science is necessary
for the technology needed to help solve the social problems in the
world brought about by the exponential growth of population (which
one may argue was itself brought about by the progress in industrial,
medical, and agricultural technology) then we should continue to
pursue basic science and the federal government should continue to
support it. The problem then becomes the political one of how the
necessary funds should be channeled through the various agencies of
the government. So our political question should be: if we want to
transfer support of basic research from DOD to non-military agencies,
should we first renounce DOD support and then seek other support,
or should we continue to accept DOD support for basic research while
at the same time seeking to transfer to other agencies of the
government?
3. What happens to Stanford if we renounce DOD support?
We have to face the fact that Stanford relies on DOD money for
basic research not only for the overhead contribution to unrestricted
University funds (in the region of $2-3 million this year) but also for
the support of graduate students, postdoctoral research associates and
for a really sizeable fraction of faculty salaries. (In many departments
half the academic salary and all the summer salary of faculty members
comes from outside contracts.) So the real question we should be
asking is what is the trade-off between continuing to accept DOD
support of basic research while at the same time seeking other
support, renouncing it now and being unable to continue supporting a
very large number of faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral
people.
4. What other sources of money are available?
Because of its basic nature, its very hard to get industry to
contribute directly to support of basic research in the universities.
They are, as capitalist institutions, even more closely tied to profit
than the DOD and even the largest corporations (GM, AT&T, IBM)
would rather do in house research where they have fairly direct
control over the direction than contract out basic research money to
universities. So inevitably universities are very closely tied to the
federal government (and some foundations) in a substantial fraction
of their economic base.
5. Could the university survive an immediate withdrawal from DOD?
It seems clear that, even if we allowed present contracts with DOD
to run out, and accepted no further contracts the universities capacity
as a leading scientific institution would be drastically reduced. Such is
the nature of our involvement with the war machine. The chances of
getting non-military support from congress in the short term seem
poor. Even if all the major universities in the country withdrew from
DOD, the chances of non-military funding increasing at a rate
sufficient to prevent • a really serious breakdown in our science
research capability seem very unlikely. So we really have to decide
whether we want such a breakdown to occur. At the tactical level, one
also has to consider whether the science community faced with such a
breakdown, in what they are after all dedicated to, would be willing
to make such a seemingly suicidal step.
6. What effect would Stanford's end to DOD research have on
national policy?
The analogy with West Point made by Judy Strasser and Mike
Sweeney should really be directed against our training of scientists
and technologists. I think that if Stanford and the other major
universities (such as MIT) stopped training these people, then this
really would have an impact. But science and technology can also be
used for good, in fact are really necessary to help deal with the
problems of the society, and to stop giving young people the
opportunity to use science for the good of humanity seems an awfully
negative approach.
I think withdrawing the research from DOD support would have
some political impact, but much less than suggested in the article. I
don't question the assumption that DOD are providing the support in
order to have some sort of—rather ill defined—political control, but I
do question how strongly they value keeping this control. After all the
total DOD commitment to university research is a pretty small
fraction of the defense budget.
7. What can we do to lessen DOD influence without giving up DOD
money immediately?
We certainly won't remove the symbol of DOD influence until we
get rid of DOD support entirely. However, if we're going to
compromise anyway, we might as well try to do it constructively. This
raises the specter of university control over the rights of individual
researchers to chose who they apply to for support of their research.
However, one does not need to be totalitarian about this. What it
amounts to is that the university as a social institution can put
pressure on people to try and transfer their support. For instance all
proposals up for renewal, or new proposals being submitted to DOD
should first have to pass through a review committee who the
researcher would have to convince that no other support was available
even though he tried very hard. This committee would incidentally
amass evidence on the need for non-DOD money which they could
then use to try and convince Congressmen and Senators to vote to
other agencies.
8. Why should we consider compromise?
The 2-3 million in unrestricted funds does give the university power
to try and implement social change—for instance by providing
scholarships for Blacks and Chicanos. This is tainted money. But by
using it for good ends the taint is lessened a little.

whether we want such a breakdown to occur. At the tactical level, one
also has to consider whether the science community faced with such a
breakdown, in what they are after all dedicated to, would be willing
to make such a seemingly suicidal step.
6. What effect would Stanford's end to DOD research have on
national policy?
The analogy with West Point made by Judy Strasser and Mike
Sweeney should really be directed against our training of scientists
and technologists. I think that if Stanford and the other major
universities (such as MIT) stopped training these people, then this
really would have an impact. But science and technology can also be
used for good, in fact are really necessary to help deal with the
problems of the society, and to stop giving young people the
opportunity to use science for the good of humanity seems an awfully
negative approach.
I think withdrawing the research from DOD support would have
some political impact, but much less than suggested in the article. I
don't question the assumption that DOD are providing the support in
order to have some sort of—rather ill defined—political control, but I
do question how strongly they value keeping this control. After all the
total DOD commitment to university research is a pretty small
fraction of the defense budget.
7. What can we do to lessen DOD influence without giving up DOD
money immediately?
We certainly won't remove the symbol of DOD influence until we
get rid of DOD support entirely. However, if we're going to
compromise anyway, we might as well try to do it constructively. This
raises the specter of university control over the rights of individual
researchers to chose who they apply to for support of their research.
However, one does not need to be totalitarian about this. What it
amounts to is that the university as a social institution can put
pressure on people to try and transfer their support. For instance all
proposals up for renewal, or new proposals being submitted to DOD
should first have to pass through a review committee who the
researcher would have to convince that no other support was available
even though he tried very hard. This committee would incidentally
amass evidence on the need for non-DOD money which they could
then use to try and convince Congressmen and Senators to vote to
other agencies.
8. Why should we consider compromise?
The 2-3 million in unrestricted funds does give the university power
to try and implement social change—for instance by providing
scholarships for Blacks and Chicanos. This is tainted money. But by
using it for good ends the taint is lessened a little.
(Seb Doniach is a professor of Applied Physics.)
1. Is DOD research at Stanford connected to the "War Machine?"
I agree that the $15 million a year DOD money at Stanford
represents a considerable involvement with the war machine. However
the statement that after July Ist (as a result of the "Mansfield
Amendment") all DOD research on campus be for applied military
purposes is misleading. Although it was, I believe, Sen. Mansfield's
intention that this would be the case, in practice the DOD and the
Bureau of the Budget seem to be making a wider interpretation which
will not cut out all basic research, but only that in certain areas (e.g.,
high energy, nuclear and astro physics) whose possible applications are
fairly far from future military needs.
2. Should we try and back Senator Mansfield's proposals?
I agree that the military should not be allowed to gain indirect
political control over universities by their support of basic research on
campus. However, if one feels that the growth of science is necessary
for the technology needed to help solve the social problems in the
world brought about by the exponential growth of population (which
one may argue was itself brought about by the progress in industrial,
medical, and agricultural technology) then we should continue to
pursue basic science and the federal government should continue to
support it. The problem then becomes the political one of how the
necessary funds should be channeled through the various agencies of
the government. So our political question should be: if we want to
transfer support of basic research from DOD to non-military agencies,
should we first renounce DOD support and then seek other support,
or should we continue to accept DOD support for basic research while
at the same time seeking to transfer to other agencies of the
government?
3. What happens to Stanford if we renounce DOD support?
We have to face the fact that Stanford relies on DOD money for
basic research not only for the overhead contribution to unrestricted
University funds (in the region of $2-3 million this year) but also for
the support of graduate students, postdoctoral research associates and
for a really sizeable fraction of faculty salaries. (In many departments
half the academic salary and all the summer salary of faculty members
comes from outside contracts.) So the real question we should be
asking is what is the trade-off between continuing to accept DOD
support of basic research while at the same time seeking other
support, renouncing it now and being unable to continue supporting a
very large number of faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral
people.
4. What other sources of money are available?
Because of its basic nature, its very hard to get industry to
contribute directly to support of basic research in the universities.
They are, as capitalist institutions, even more closely tied to profit
than the DOD and even the largest corporations (GM, AT&T, IBM)
would rather do in house research where they have fairly direct
control over the direction than contract out basic research money to
universities. So inevitably universities are very closely tied to the
federal government (and some foundations) in a substantial fraction
of their economic base.
5. Could the university survive an immediate withdrawal from DOD?
It seems clear that, even if we allowed present contracts with DOD
to run out, and accepted no further contracts the universities capacity
as a leading scientific institution would be drastically reduced. Such is
the nature of our involvement with the war machine. The chances of
getting non-military support from congress in the short term seem
poor. Even if all the major universities in the country withdrew from
DOD, the chances of non-military funding increasing at a rate
sufficient to prevent • a really serious breakdown in our science
research capability seem very unlikely. So we really have to decide
whether we want such a breakdown to occur. At the tactical level, one
also has to consider whether the science community faced with such a
breakdown, in what they are after all dedicated to, would be willing
to make such a seemingly suicidal step.

world brought about by the exponential growth of population (which
one may argue was itself brought about by the progress in industrial,
medical, and agricultural technology) then we should continue to
pursue basic science and the federal government should continue to
support it. The problem then becomes the political one of how the
necessary funds should be channeled through the various agencies of
the government. So our political question should be: if we want to
transfer support of basic research from DOD to non-military agencies,
should we first renounce DOD support and then seek other support,
or should we continue to accept DOD support for basic research while
at the same time seeking to transfer to other agencies of the
government?
3. What happens to Stanford if we renounce DOD support?
We have to face the fact that Stanford relies on DOD money for
basic research not only for the overhead contribution to unrestricted
University funds (in the region of $2-3 million this year) but also for
the support of graduate students, postdoctoral research associates and
for a really sizeable fraction of faculty salaries. (In many departments
half the academic salary and all the summer salary of faculty members
comes from outside contracts.) So the real question we should be
asking is what is the trade-off between continuing to accept DOD
support of basic research while at the same time seeking other
support, renouncing it now and being unable to continue supporting a
very large number of faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral
people.
4. What other sources of money are available?
Because of its basic nature, its very hard to get industry to
contribute directly to support of basic research in the universities.
They are, as capitalist institutions, even more closely tied to profit
than the DOD and even the largest corporations (GM, AT&T, IBM)
would rather do in house research where they have fairly direct
control over the direction than contract out basic research money to
universities. So inevitably universities are very closely tied to the
federal government (and some foundations) in a substantial fraction
of their economic base.
5. Could the university survive an immediate withdrawal from DOD?
It seems clear that, even if we allowed present contracts with DOD
to run out, and accepted no further contracts the universities capacity
as a leading scientific institution would be drastically reduced. Such is
the nature of our involvement with the war machine. The chances of
getting non-military support from congress in the short term seem
poor. Even if all the major universities in the country withdrew from
DOD, the chances of non-military funding increasing at a rate
sufficient to prevent • a really serious breakdown in our science
research capability seem very unlikely. So we really have to decide
whether we want such a breakdown to occur. At the tactical level, one
also has to consider whether the science community faced with such a
breakdown, in what they are after all dedicated to, would be willing
to make such a seemingly suicidal step.
6. What effect would Stanford's end to DOD research have on
national policy?
The analogy with West Point made by Judy Strasser and Mike
Sweeney should really be directed against our training of scientists
and technologists. I think that if Stanford and the other major
universities (such as MIT) stopped training these people, then this
really would have an impact. But science and technology can also be
used for good, in fact are really necessary to help deal with the
problems of the society, and to stop giving young people the
opportunity to use science for the good of humanity seems an awfully
negative approach.
I think withdrawing the research from DOD support would have
some political impact, but much less than suggested in the article. I
don't question the assumption that DOD are providing the support in
order to have some sort of—rather ill defined—political control, but I
do question how strongly they value keeping this control. After all the
total DOD commitment to university research is a pretty small
fraction of the defense budget.
7. What can we do to lessen DOD influence without giving up DOD
money immediately?
We certainly won't remove the symbol of DOD influence until we
get rid of DOD support entirely. However, if we're going to
compromise anyway, we might as well try to do it constructively. This
raises the specter of university control over the rights of individual
researchers to chose who they apply to for support of their research.
However, one does not need to be totalitarian about this. What it
amounts to is that the university as a social institution can put
pressure on people to try and transfer their support. For instance all
proposals up for renewal, or new proposals being submitted to DOD
should first have to pass through a review committee who the
researcher would have to convince that no other support was available
even though he tried very hard. This committee would incidentally
amass evidence on the need for non-DOD money which they could
then use to try and convince Congressmen and Senators to vote to
other agencies.
8. Why should we consider compromise?
The 2-3 million in unrestricted funds does give the university power
to try and implement social change—for instance by providing
scholarships for Blacks and Chicanos. This is tainted money. But by
using it for good ends the taint is lessened a little.

1. Is DOD research at Stanford connected to the "War Machine?"
I agree that the $15 million a year DOD money at Stanford
represents a considerable involvement with the war machine. However
the statement that after July Ist (as a result of the "Mansfield
Amendment") all DOD research on campus be for applied military
purposes is misleading. Although it was, I believe, Sen. Mansfield's
intention that this would be the case, in practice the DOD and the
Bureau of the Budget seem to be making a wider interpretation which
will not cut out all basic research, but only that in certain areas (e.g.,
high energy, nuclear and astro physics) whose possible applications are
fairly far from future military needs.
2. Should we try and back Senator Mansfield's proposals?
I agree that the military should not be allowed to gain indirect
political control over universities by their support of basic research on
campus. However, if one feels that the growth of science is necessary
for the technology needed to help solve the social problems in the
world brought about by the exponential growth of population (which
one may argue was itself brought about by the progress in industrial,
medical, and agricultural technology) then we should continue to
pursue basic science and the federal government should continue to
support it. The problem then becomes the political one of how the
necessary funds should be channeled through the various agencies of
