# Racism In America
## The 						Long Summer Is Here 
### Vic von Schelgell 
Perhaps we cannot create a
world where there are no tortured
children, but perhaps we can
reduce the number of tortured
children . . .
Albert Camus
As if anyone was waiting, the
"long hot summer" arrived early
in Georgia, with six Black men
shot in the back by the
militia—probably emissaries of
Their Royal Pigs Hoover and
Mitchell, they have ceased to be
covert, and have adopted the
uniforms of the standing army.
Not all of this is new (ghettos
have been armed camps for years,
as part of the constant effort for
"law and order"), but the
battlefields have changed slightly
from street to college campus. We
can begin to hold it as self-evident
that repression is blind - to justice
and human rights, and to skin
color. And if Senator Ribicoff
would stop shucking long enough
to listen to himself, he would
realize that this country is in fact

moving toward apartheid, if it's
not already there.
For the last couple of years, we
have come to see racism as
isolated: swastikas on Black
womens' doors, Huey P. Newton
and other Panthers all have melted
together to the poiht that we are
accustomed to seeing Black
people ripped-off, it would
probably take a train-load of
Black corpses to outrage people
sufficiently to act. We have come
to forget that our rights are
defined by the oppressed, and
with brothers and sisters shot in
Georgia, Kent State, Berkeley,
and elsewhere, we are just learning
to see that we are all in this
together. To the extent that we
do not act violently or
non-violently we join with the
oppressor.
Non-Violent Debate
But are we together? We are
still debating non-violence, in the
context of an increasingly-violent
society, forgetting that violence
may be our only means of
self-defense, and that repression is
part of the struggle. We have
allowed ourselves to be shuffled
along by politicians rhetoric about
ecology, while forgetting the
people who must live in the world
we have now. But worst of all, we
have almost lost our sense of
courage our realization that we
can, and must, win.
And that loss of consciousness
is the most important and
greivous of all. Some of us who
are on probation from last spring
have stayed on the outside, largely
afraid, I guess, of a term in jail.
But in doing so, we have left a lot
behind that we have to regain.
And if we can regain the
consciousness of a new society,
we can put aside pettiness and
strung-out ideology, and unite
with those we have largely left.
Some people wonder why the
Blacks, Chicanos and other Third
World people have not been with
us, even though we know that
they are the people who are
affected most by the expanded
war, and by the repression of
domestic and international
imperialism; the answer is a simple
one: we have not shown that we

are willing to go down with them,
to join fully in their struggle and
to accept that struggle as our own.
If we are to work together, the
first order of business is to get
ourselves together, and to face off
violently or non-violently against
the oppressor. When Eldridge
Cleaver spoke here some months
ago, he said, "Black people are
syaing that we've had enough,
that we will no longer take it; so
that we see no alternative but to
organize ourselves to get into a
position to take white people with
us if we have to go." Then he
asked if white people would be
willing to harbor him, and to
stand with him against the
oppressor; we should be willing to
'o that, and more. We should

realize that Cleaver's rights under
oppression and ours are the same.
Stokeley Carmichael said,
"When I say Black Power, 1 know
exactly what I'm talking
about ... If the white man
doesn't know what I'm talking
about, that's his problem, because
black people understand me, and
that's who I'm talking to
anyway." What he has said
applied to integration, the War on
Poverty, and all of the rest of the
political tricks that Nixon and
"We Shall Overcome" Johnson
have perverted. We must join with
others against the oppressor,
avoiding our own definitions and
rules.

"law and order"), but the
battlefields have changed slightly
from street to college campus. We
can begin to hold it as self-evident
that repression is blind - to justice
and human rights, and to skin
color. And if Senator Ribicoff
would stop shucking long enough
to listen to himself, he would
realize that this country is in fact

moving toward apartheid, if it's
not already there.
For the last couple of years, we
have come to see racism as
isolated: swastikas on Black
womens' doors, Huey P. Newton
and other Panthers all have melted
together to the poiht that we are
accustomed to seeing Black
people ripped-off, it would
probably take a train-load of
Black corpses to outrage people
sufficiently to act. We have come
to forget that our rights are
defined by the oppressed, and
with brothers and sisters shot in
Georgia, Kent State, Berkeley,
and elsewhere, we are just learning
to see that we are all in this
together. To the extent that we
do not act violently or
non-violently we join with the
oppressor.
Non-Violent Debate
But are we together? We are
still debating non-violence, in the
context of an increasingly-violent
society, forgetting that violence
may be our only means of
self-defense, and that repression is
part of the struggle. We have
allowed ourselves to be shuffled
along by politicians rhetoric about
ecology, while forgetting the
people who must live in the world
we have now. But worst of all, we
have almost lost our sense of
courage our realization that we
can, and must, win.
And that loss of consciousness
is the most important and
greivous of all. Some of us who
are on probation from last spring
have stayed on the outside, largely
afraid, I guess, of a term in jail.
But in doing so, we have left a lot
behind that we have to regain.
And if we can regain the
consciousness of a new society,
we can put aside pettiness and
strung-out ideology, and unite
with those we have largely left.
Some people wonder why the
Blacks, Chicanos and other Third
World people have not been with
us, even though we know that
they are the people who are
affected most by the expanded
war, and by the repression of
domestic and international
imperialism; the answer is a simple
one: we have not shown that we

are willing to go down with them,
to join fully in their struggle and
to accept that struggle as our own.
If we are to work together, the
first order of business is to get
ourselves together, and to face off
violently or non-violently against
the oppressor. When Eldridge
Cleaver spoke here some months
ago, he said, "Black people are
syaing that we've had enough,
that we will no longer take it; so
that we see no alternative but to
organize ourselves to get into a
position to take white people with
us if we have to go." Then he
asked if white people would be
willing to harbor him, and to
stand with him against the
oppressor; we should be willing to
'o that, and more. We should

realize that Cleaver's rights under
oppression and ours are the same.
Stokeley Carmichael said,
"When I say Black Power, 1 know
exactly what I'm talking
about ... If the white man
doesn't know what I'm talking
about, that's his problem, because
black people understand me, and
that's who I'm talking to
anyway." What he has said
applied to integration, the War on
Poverty, and all of the rest of the
political tricks that Nixon and
"We Shall Overcome" Johnson
have perverted. We must join with
others against the oppressor,
avoiding our own definitions and
rules.

"long hot summer" arrived early
in Georgia, with six Black men

militia—probably emissaries of
Their Royal Pigs Hoover and

uniforms of the standing army.
