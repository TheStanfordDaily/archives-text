# Radical 'Snobbery'
## Revolutionary Repression 
### John Grundman 
As a result of the unenlightened
policies of our government, this
academic community has been
driven en masse into opposition,
and provided with the
opportunity to more clearly
define that opposition and the
positive conceptions of national
policy which are its complement,
to begin concerted political action
for the improvement of those
policies, and, in the process, to
redefine for itself the meaning of
an academic community.
Some of the results of this
process have been extremely l
interesting and hopeful. One
example is the History
Department convocation of May
What is important is that this
issue became the subject of a
wide- ranging constitutional
debate; people's ideas and
attitudes were clarified for
themselves and others, and the
foundations were laid for possible
changes. In short, the result was in
conformity with the finest
traditions of both • education and
politics.
Small Group
Unfortunately, the same praise
cannot be given to some other
things that have happened on this
campus. There is a small group of
self-styled "revolutionaries" who
have opted out of the Stanford
community and of American
society in general. Their anger and
alienation are understandable in
the present situation, and by
means of the crisis and their
strong stand on it, they have
managed to attract support from a
larger group who, in normal
circumstances, would not
associate with them because of
their methods.
The most outstanding
characteristics of this minority are
their attitude of moral superiority
to all those who refuse to adopt
their points of view, their
consequent alienation from the
"unenlightened" majority on this
campus, and their willingness to
trample on the ideas, the
property, and, one suspects in
some cases, the lives of others in
order to attain their goals. They
are never so happy as when
trashing or shouting insults at the
police. In fact their affinity for
the police, some of whom really
are "pigs", is one of the most
interesting things about them.
The police are their mirror
image: both groups depend on
threats, violence and repression to
accomplish their purposes. There
"radicals" do not wish to get rid
of the instruments of repression;
they wish to control them, and
their tactics are well-calculated to
maintain and strengthen these
instruments until they can gain
control. Their differences on
policy with certain members of
the government are trivial,
compared with their agreement on
methods.
Salvation And Sacrifice
If their goals truly represented
salvation, sacrifices would
doubtless be called for in order to
attain them. One is surprised,
therefore, to find that in too
many cases these goals are very

poorly thought out—less
surprising when one considers
their watchword: "Do it!" Most
of them, I suppose, would call for
a just and democratic society,
without realizing that their
methods and attitudes are the
antithesis of democracy and
justice. Another of their favorite
sayings: "If you're not part of the
solution, you are part of the
problem." Still another: "All
power to the people" (us people,
not you people). These are not
ideas but slogans —the antithesis of
ideas.
A revealing example of what I
am talking about occurred at the
meeting last Friday afternoon in
White Plaza. I saw only the last
half hour or so of it, and refer
only to this portion. There were
two or three hundred people in
the plaza, and a number of
motions were made, debated and
voted upon. The whole process,
however, including the ideas and
tactics discussed, was extremely
Superficial. , The only interesting
part of the discussion was an
interjection by someone who
declared that he shared their
goals, but didn't like pushing
people around in order to attain
them.
He was shouted down, the
occasion thus providing an
example of what he was
complaining about. The real
answer to his plea, however, was
the growing indifference with
which the proceeding was viewed
by those present. In the end, all
but a handful of people had
stopped voting, including many of
those who had shouted the
speaker down. (The pretense was
nonetheless maintained that these
votes were accomplishing
something.)
Radicals Bored Themselves
It is not surprising that these
"radicals" eventually bored
themselves. Bored people are
people without insight and
commitment. For too many of
them, "Do it!" is a substitute for
the necessity that the rest of us
feel of thinking about it first. This
is not radicalism, nor are these
attitudes found in the finest
humanistic strains of
revolutionary theory. It is rather,
a particularly malignant form of
snobbery and elitism, founded on
contempt of self and of other
people.
However, we must now ask,
what is the basis of these
attitudes? These are young
people, many of them quite
intelligent, better educated and
more aware than earlier
generations. They have become
totally alienated from themselves
and from the political process.
Their criticisms of traditional
politics as meaningless, and of
those in positions of responsibility
who have stood by and passively
accepted the evils perpetrated in
their name strike too close to the
truth to be ignored. In fact the
truth of their criticisms
constitutes a substantial, if
insufficient, justification for their
attitudes and actions. Their
position must not be accepted,
and society must, if necessary,

defend itself against them.
Such a defense and much an
attempt must rest on a firm
ethical basis, and the only possible
such basis is for the bystanders,
such as myself, to take up and
fulfill those responsibilities that
they have shirked. If many of
these people have contempt for
clear and rigorous thought, it is
because of the context of
impotence in which they have
experienced it—the context that
we have provided. When it
becomes necessary to act, we
must not use thought as a
cop-out. It is time for academics
to stop being "intellectuals," the
one-dimensional men who are the
all-too-understandable target of
activist scorn.

their attitude of moral superiority
to all those who refuse to adopt
their points of view, their
consequent alienation from the
"unenlightened" majority on this
campus, and their willingness to
trample on the ideas, the
property, and, one suspects in
some cases, the lives of others in
order to attain their goals. They
are never so happy as when
trashing or shouting insults at the
police. In fact their affinity for
the police, some of whom really
are "pigs", is one of the most
interesting things about them.
The police are their mirror
image: both groups depend on
threats, violence and repression to
accomplish their purposes. There
"radicals" do not wish to get rid
of the instruments of repression;
they wish to control them, and
their tactics are well-calculated to
maintain and strengthen these
instruments until they can gain
control. Their differences on
policy with certain members of
the government are trivial,
compared with their agreement on
methods.
Salvation And Sacrifice
If their goals truly represented
salvation, sacrifices would
doubtless be called for in order to
attain them. One is surprised,
therefore, to find that in too
many cases these goals are very

poorly thought out—less
surprising when one considers
their watchword: "Do it!" Most
of them, I suppose, would call for
a just and democratic society,
without realizing that their
methods and attitudes are the
antithesis of democracy and
justice. Another of their favorite
sayings: "If you're not part of the
solution, you are part of the
problem." Still another: "All
power to the people" (us people,
not you people). These are not
ideas but slogans —the antithesis of
ideas.
A revealing example of what I
am talking about occurred at the
meeting last Friday afternoon in
White Plaza. I saw only the last
half hour or so of it, and refer
only to this portion. There were
two or three hundred people in
the plaza, and a number of
motions were made, debated and
voted upon. The whole process,
however, including the ideas and
tactics discussed, was extremely
Superficial. , The only interesting
part of the discussion was an
interjection by someone who
declared that he shared their
goals, but didn't like pushing
people around in order to attain
them.
He was shouted down, the
occasion thus providing an
example of what he was
complaining about. The real
answer to his plea, however, was
the growing indifference with
which the proceeding was viewed
by those present. In the end, all
but a handful of people had
stopped voting, including many of
those who had shouted the
speaker down. (The pretense was
nonetheless maintained that these
votes were accomplishing
something.)
Radicals Bored Themselves
It is not surprising that these
"radicals" eventually bored
themselves. Bored people are
people without insight and
commitment. For too many of
them, "Do it!" is a substitute for
the necessity that the rest of us
feel of thinking about it first. This
is not radicalism, nor are these
attitudes found in the finest
humanistic strains of
revolutionary theory. It is rather,
a particularly malignant form of
snobbery and elitism, founded on
contempt of self and of other
people.
However, we must now ask,
what is the basis of these
attitudes? These are young
people, many of them quite
intelligent, better educated and
more aware than earlier
generations. They have become
totally alienated from themselves
and from the political process.
Their criticisms of traditional
politics as meaningless, and of
those in positions of responsibility
who have stood by and passively
accepted the evils perpetrated in
their name strike too close to the
truth to be ignored. In fact the
truth of their criticisms
constitutes a substantial, if
insufficient, justification for their
attitudes and actions. Their
position must not be accepted,
and society must, if necessary,

defend itself against them.
Such a defense and much an
attempt must rest on a firm
ethical basis, and the only possible
such basis is for the bystanders,
such as myself, to take up and
fulfill those responsibilities that
they have shirked. If many of
these people have contempt for
clear and rigorous thought, it is
because of the context of
impotence in which they have
experienced it—the context that
we have provided. When it
becomes necessary to act, we
must not use thought as a
cop-out. It is time for academics
to stop being "intellectuals," the
one-dimensional men who are the
all-too-understandable target of
activist scorn.

As a result of the unenlightened
policies of our government, this
academic community has been
driven en masse into opposition,
and provided with the
opportunity to more clearly
define that opposition and the
positive conceptions of national
policy which are its complement,
to begin concerted political action
for the improvement of those
policies, and, in the process, to
redefine for itself the meaning of
an academic community.
Some of the results of this
process have been extremely l
interesting and hopeful. One
example is the History
Department convocation of May
What is important is that this
issue became the subject of a

Small Group
Unfortunately, the same praise
cannot be given to some other
things that have happened on this
campus. There is a small group of
self-styled "revolutionaries" who
have opted out of the Stanford
community and of American
society in general. Their anger and
alienation are understandable in
the present situation, and by
means of the crisis and their
strong stand on it, they have
managed to attract support from a
larger group who, in normal
circumstances, would not
associate with them because of
their methods.

sayings: "If you're not part of the
solution, you are part of the
problem." Still another: "All
power to the people" (us people,
not you people). These are not
ideas but slogans —the antithesis of
ideas.
A revealing example of what I
am talking about occurred at the
meeting last Friday afternoon in
White Plaza. I saw only the last
half hour or so of it, and refer
only to this portion. There were
two or three hundred people in
the plaza, and a number of
motions were made, debated and
voted upon. The whole process,
however, including the ideas and
tactics discussed, was extremely
Superficial. , The only interesting
part of the discussion was an
interjection by someone who
declared that he shared their
goals, but didn't like pushing
people around in order to attain
them.
He was shouted down, the
occasion thus providing an
example of what he was
complaining about. The real
answer to his plea, however, was
the growing indifference with
which the proceeding was viewed
by those present. In the end, all
but a handful of people had
stopped voting, including many of
those who had shouted the
speaker down. (The pretense was
nonetheless maintained that these
votes were accomplishing
something.)
Radicals Bored Themselves
It is not surprising that these
"radicals" eventually bored
themselves. Bored people are
people without insight and
commitment. For too many of
them, "Do it!" is a substitute for
the necessity that the rest of us
feel of thinking about it first. This
is not radicalism, nor are these
attitudes found in the finest
humanistic strains of
revolutionary theory. It is rather,
a particularly malignant form of
snobbery and elitism, founded on
contempt of self and of other
people.
However, we must now ask,
what is the basis of these
attitudes? These are young
people, many of them quite
intelligent, better educated and
more aware than earlier
generations. They have become
totally alienated from themselves
and from the political process.
Their criticisms of traditional
politics as meaningless, and of
those in positions of responsibility
who have stood by and passively
accepted the evils perpetrated in
their name strike too close to the
truth to be ignored. In fact the
truth of their criticisms
constitutes a substantial, if
insufficient, justification for their
attitudes and actions. Their
position must not be accepted,
and society must, if necessary,

defend itself against them.
Such a defense and much an
attempt must rest on a firm
ethical basis, and the only possible
such basis is for the bystanders,
such as myself, to take up and
fulfill those responsibilities that
they have shirked. If many of
these people have contempt for
clear and rigorous thought, it is
because of the context of
impotence in which they have
experienced it—the context that
we have provided. When it
becomes necessary to act, we
must not use thought as a
cop-out. It is time for academics
to stop being "intellectuals," the
one-dimensional men who are the
all-too-understandable target of
activist scorn.

As a result of the unenlightened
policies of our government, this
academic community has been
driven en masse into opposition,
and provided with the
opportunity to more clearly
define that opposition and the
positive conceptions of national
policy which are its complement,
to begin concerted political action
for the improvement of those
policies, and, in the process, to
redefine for itself the meaning of
an academic community.
Some of the results of this
process have been extremely l
interesting and hopeful. One
example is the History
Department convocation of May
What is important is that this
issue became the subject of a
wide- ranging constitutional
debate; people's ideas and
attitudes were clarified for
themselves and others, and the
foundations were laid for possible
changes. In short, the result was in
conformity with the finest
traditions of both • education and
politics.
Small Group
Unfortunately, the same praise
cannot be given to some other
things that have happened on this
campus. There is a small group of
self-styled "revolutionaries" who
have opted out of the Stanford
community and of American
society in general. Their anger and
alienation are understandable in
the present situation, and by
means of the crisis and their
strong stand on it, they have
managed to attract support from a
larger group who, in normal
circumstances, would not
associate with them because of
their methods.
The most outstanding
characteristics of this minority are
their attitude of moral superiority
to all those who refuse to adopt
their points of view, their
consequent alienation from the
"unenlightened" majority on this
campus, and their willingness to
trample on the ideas, the
property, and, one suspects in
some cases, the lives of others in
order to attain their goals. They
are never so happy as when
trashing or shouting insults at the
police. In fact their affinity for
the police, some of whom really
are "pigs", is one of the most
interesting things about them.
The police are their mirror
image: both groups depend on
threats, violence and repression to
accomplish their purposes. There
"radicals" do not wish to get rid
of the instruments of repression;
they wish to control them, and
their tactics are well-calculated to
maintain and strengthen these
instruments until they can gain
control. Their differences on
policy with certain members of
the government are trivial,
compared with their agreement on
methods.
Salvation And Sacrifice
If their goals truly represented
salvation, sacrifices would
doubtless be called for in order to
attain them. One is surprised,
therefore, to find that in too
many cases these goals are very

poorly thought out—less
surprising when one considers
their watchword: "Do it!" Most
of them, I suppose, would call for
a just and democratic society,
without realizing that their
methods and attitudes are the
antithesis of democracy and
justice. Another of their favorite
sayings: "If you're not part of the
solution, you are part of the
problem." Still another: "All
power to the people" (us people,
not you people). These are not
