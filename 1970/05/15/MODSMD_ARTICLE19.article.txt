# An American Apology

Mother America
I am your history;
I was born out of your decarations,
I was christened with liberty,
and Death,
I was born out of revolution;
I am a man
sitting on an oriental hill,
T am a body
oating down an oriental river;
had youth,
e was shot in Dallas;
had peace,
e was shot in Memphis;
had hope,
e was shot in Los Angeles;
;tm a man,
tting in jail;
im a body
ing in Kent;

I am Black, and Brown,
and Red with Blood;
I am young, and old,
and red with blood;
Only my voice was a ringing bell,
now it is the sound of a rock,
as it shatters a window;
Once my smell was that of
mountains,
now it is the smell of tear gas;
Once my way was lighted by a torch
now it is my buildings that burn;
Mother America
I am your only son,
Do not send me to war,
Here, or there, or anywhere,
for it I die,
you will have no more
