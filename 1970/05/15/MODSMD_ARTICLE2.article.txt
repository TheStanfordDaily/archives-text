(AP) â€” A rapidly spreading wildcat Teamsters strike shut down most
Bay Area trucking yesterday.
Teamsters pickets forced the furlough of non-editorial workers at
the San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle. About 75 pickets showed
up outside the San Francisco Printing Co. plant which prints and
distributes both the Examiner and the Chronicle.
The strikers prevented the circulation of the Examiner yesterday
afternoon. Circulation drivers honored the line, and the presses were
stopped when it became apparent that the papers could not be
delivered.
The pickets carried signs from East Bay local 85, which had been
altered to read "851," a non-existant local. A Superior Court

injunction against Local 85 was obtained by trucking firms last week.
The strike developed last month in Los Angeles and Chicago when
teamsters refused to accept the new tentative national contract.
Locally, the strike had been contined mostly to Alameda and San
Francisco until yesterday. But now the work stoppage is widely
spread through Santa Clara and San Mateo counties.
In San Jose, a business agent for Teamsters Local 287 confirmed
that most drivers were off work yesterday.
If anybody is at work today among our members, it would be just
a drop in the bucket," said the union official, who declined to be
identified.
