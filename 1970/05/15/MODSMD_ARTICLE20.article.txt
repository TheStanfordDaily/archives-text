Depending on how you look at it, it is night and tension runs
high—maybe three feet—in this small western town. As Hank Kinkade
puts it, "Thar's cayotes that needs gettin rid of."
Joe Bradey, blacksmith, barber, doctor, dentist and sheriff, sees it
differently: "Ah jes shoe harses, oh, maybe far, five,time a day. Seem
ta me cayotes got the same rights as harses."
"Shet yor mouth," yells Kinkade.
Kinkade has been over at Kate's place the Chemine de Fer riling up
the town's people. The town's people stand in front of the Sheriff's
Office facing Joe Bradey and his deputies. Kinkade goes back to see
how Kate is getting on by herself.
Scratchy, the affectionate town drunk who drools slightly while
bumming drinks and throws up afterward, lurches among the crowd.
"Kate say she goin ta throw a party after we're done har." Scratchy's
face is gritty with a new three day growth of stubble.
"Golly Damn"
Somehow Scratchy doesn't see the seriousness of the situation. The
crowd is worked up to a fever pitch. "Golly damn "and "Hell's a-fire"
can be heard. The mayor and his council mingle with the crowd and
deputies to see what's going on. "Moonlight like ta blind yor eye
balls," says one of the councilmen. The crowd mumbles.
Oscar, one of the mob, twists a handkerchief in his hands. "This is
so silly. We just walked all over this town to get here. Nearly
everywhere. And my feet hurt. They really do. I hope nothing savage
happens."
Jeb stands next to Oscar. Jeb has no neck and rat' eyes. "Whot's
that hissin?" Goll darn school marm talk. We come har to lunch
cayotes and, Gawd A'mighty, that's whot we're goin ta do! Thems
that ain't is goin to get themselves strung up too. Got no room fer
yella bellies."
"You silly savage."
Jeb is about to hit Oscar but a cry goes up in the crowd. "Look!
It's Rev. Jackson. The Rev. Jackson is goin ta speak!"
Reverend Genesis Deuteronomy Jackson is leader of the Analites
one of the town's fundamentalist sects. "Harken unto me, brethren!
As surely and purely as Ah stand har a low down cayote slinks behind
the walls of that citadel of hell over thar. He who believes surely and
purely will cast those walls a hell down!"
"Amen!"
Gawd Ahmighty
"It's wrote in the book! It's the word of Gawd." The crowd cheers.
"It's the word of his own begot son Jesus!" The crowd cheers again.
"It's the word of his own mother Mary !"
Jeb spits. "Ah don't take ta that Mary bisness." The crowd
mumbles.
Suddenly a wagon draws up. On its side is painted: "Dr. Leo Bogg's
Freak, Theatrical And Medicine Show." Leo jumps down off the seat
and takes two wooden Indians from out of the wagon. Both Indians
hold gilt edged signs. One sign reads, "Leo Bogg, reknown thespian,
presents for one night only readings from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
Tonight: Marc Antony's speech before the citizens of Rome." The
other sign reads, "Dr. Bogg's Snake Oil will clear the ozone in your
blood."
Leo speaks: "Ah ain't goin ta read no lines from the bard tonight,
folks. Ah goin to address myself ta the issue har tonight. Ah come har
ta tell ya not ta hang a low down cayote but to git on home cause ya
ain't doin nothin. Ya jes sittin round."
800
Jeb says, "That quack better shet his mouth or Ah 11 punch him a
new one cross ways." The crowd boos Leo.
"Y'all ain't got the guts ta do nothin cause you ain't done nothin.
What ya done? War's yor leaders? All ya done is walk round a talk a
lot."
"That's certainly true," says Oscar. The crowd is silent. People hang
their heads.
"Go on, git home. You ain't doin nothin." Some people get up to
leave and a slow smile crosses Leo's face. "Course if ya want ta do
somethin on the way home ya might drop by the Sheriff's Office."
Jeb yells out, "By Gawd, Ah knowed that man was right! Let's git
us some stinkin lousy no good cayotes! Let's draw an quarter, tar an
feather ... !"
A Goat?
Suddenly a mysterious masked man appears in the crowd, picks up
one of Leo's wodden Indians and throws it at the Sheriff. A
councilman, who had been telling the Sheriff to use reserve, reminding
the Sheriff that the town's people were voters and a town was only
the sum of its people, nearly misses being hit. Fortunately the
councilman and the Sheriff duck but Scratchy, who had wandered
behind the deputies and passed out, is struck by the Indian and killed.
The councilman asks, "Say, who was that masked may anyway?"
A goat slips out the back way of the Sheriff's Office.

Somehow Scratchy doesn't see the seriousness of the situation. The
crowd is worked up to a fever pitch. "Golly damn "and "Hell's a-fire"
can be heard. The mayor and his council mingle with the crowd and
deputies to see what's going on. "Moonlight like ta blind yor eye
balls," says one of the councilmen. The crowd mumbles.
Oscar, one of the mob, twists a handkerchief in his hands. "This is
so silly. We just walked all over this town to get here. Nearly
everywhere. And my feet hurt. They really do. I hope nothing savage
happens."
Jeb stands next to Oscar. Jeb has no neck and rat' eyes. "Whot's
that hissin?" Goll darn school marm talk. We come har to lunch
cayotes and, Gawd A'mighty, that's whot we're goin ta do! Thems
that ain't is goin to get themselves strung up too. Got no room fer
yella bellies."
"You silly savage."
Jeb is about to hit Oscar but a cry goes up in the crowd. "Look!
It's Rev. Jackson. The Rev. Jackson is goin ta speak!"
Reverend Genesis Deuteronomy Jackson is leader of the Analites
one of the town's fundamentalist sects. "Harken unto me, brethren!
As surely and purely as Ah stand har a low down cayote slinks behind
the walls of that citadel of hell over thar. He who believes surely and
purely will cast those walls a hell down!"
"Amen!"
Gawd Ahmighty
"It's wrote in the book! It's the word of Gawd." The crowd cheers.
"It's the word of his own begot son Jesus!" The crowd cheers again.
"It's the word of his own mother Mary !"
Jeb spits. "Ah don't take ta that Mary bisness." The crowd
mumbles.
Suddenly a wagon draws up. On its side is painted: "Dr. Leo Bogg's
Freak, Theatrical And Medicine Show." Leo jumps down off the seat
and takes two wooden Indians from out of the wagon. Both Indians
hold gilt edged signs. One sign reads, "Leo Bogg, reknown thespian,
presents for one night only readings from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
Tonight: Marc Antony's speech before the citizens of Rome." The
other sign reads, "Dr. Bogg's Snake Oil will clear the ozone in your
blood."
Leo speaks: "Ah ain't goin ta read no lines from the bard tonight,
folks. Ah goin to address myself ta the issue har tonight. Ah come har
ta tell ya not ta hang a low down cayote but to git on home cause ya
ain't doin nothin. Ya jes sittin round."
800
Jeb says, "That quack better shet his mouth or Ah 11 punch him a
new one cross ways." The crowd boos Leo.
"Y'all ain't got the guts ta do nothin cause you ain't done nothin.
What ya done? War's yor leaders? All ya done is walk round a talk a
lot."
"That's certainly true," says Oscar. The crowd is silent. People hang
their heads.
"Go on, git home. You ain't doin nothin." Some people get up to
leave and a slow smile crosses Leo's face. "Course if ya want ta do
somethin on the way home ya might drop by the Sheriff's Office."
Jeb yells out, "By Gawd, Ah knowed that man was right! Let's git
us some stinkin lousy no good cayotes! Let's draw an quarter, tar an
feather ... !"
A Goat?
Suddenly a mysterious masked man appears in the crowd, picks up
one of Leo's wodden Indians and throws it at the Sheriff. A
councilman, who had been telling the Sheriff to use reserve, reminding
the Sheriff that the town's people were voters and a town was only
the sum of its people, nearly misses being hit. Fortunately the
councilman and the Sheriff duck but Scratchy, who had wandered
behind the deputies and passed out, is struck by the Indian and killed.
The councilman asks, "Say, who was that masked may anyway?"
A goat slips out the back way of the Sheriff's Office.

Depending on how you look at it, it is night and tension runs
high—maybe three feet—in this small western town. As Hank Kinkade
puts it, "Thar's cayotes that needs gettin rid of."
Joe Bradey, blacksmith, barber, doctor, dentist and sheriff, sees it
differently: "Ah jes shoe harses, oh, maybe far, five,time a day. Seem
ta me cayotes got the same rights as harses."
"Shet yor mouth," yells Kinkade.
Kinkade has been over at Kate's place the Chemine de Fer riling up
the town's people. The town's people stand in front of the Sheriff's
Office facing Joe Bradey and his deputies. Kinkade goes back to see
how Kate is getting on by herself.
Scratchy, the affectionate town drunk who drools slightly while
bumming drinks and throws up afterward, lurches among the crowd.

It's Rev. Jackson. The Rev. Jackson is goin ta speak!"
Reverend Genesis Deuteronomy Jackson is leader of the Analites
one of the town's fundamentalist sects. "Harken unto me, brethren!
As surely and purely as Ah stand har a low down cayote slinks behind
the walls of that citadel of hell over thar. He who believes surely and
purely will cast those walls a hell down!"
"Amen!"
Gawd Ahmighty
"It's wrote in the book! It's the word of Gawd." The crowd cheers.
"It's the word of his own begot son Jesus!" The crowd cheers again.
"It's the word of his own mother Mary !"
Jeb spits. "Ah don't take ta that Mary bisness." The crowd
mumbles.
Suddenly a wagon draws up. On its side is painted: "Dr. Leo Bogg's
Freak, Theatrical And Medicine Show." Leo jumps down off the seat
and takes two wooden Indians from out of the wagon. Both Indians
hold gilt edged signs. One sign reads, "Leo Bogg, reknown thespian,
presents for one night only readings from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
Tonight: Marc Antony's speech before the citizens of Rome." The
other sign reads, "Dr. Bogg's Snake Oil will clear the ozone in your
blood."
Leo speaks: "Ah ain't goin ta read no lines from the bard tonight,
folks. Ah goin to address myself ta the issue har tonight. Ah come har
ta tell ya not ta hang a low down cayote but to git on home cause ya
ain't doin nothin. Ya jes sittin round."

Jeb says, "That quack better shet his mouth or Ah 11 punch him a
new one cross ways." The crowd boos Leo.
"Y'all ain't got the guts ta do nothin cause you ain't done nothin.
What ya done? War's yor leaders? All ya done is walk round a talk a
lot."
"That's certainly true," says Oscar. The crowd is silent. People hang
their heads.
"Go on, git home. You ain't doin nothin." Some people get up to
leave and a slow smile crosses Leo's face. "Course if ya want ta do
somethin on the way home ya might drop by the Sheriff's Office."
Jeb yells out, "By Gawd, Ah knowed that man was right! Let's git
us some stinkin lousy no good cayotes! Let's draw an quarter, tar an
feather ... !"
A Goat?
Suddenly a mysterious masked man appears in the crowd, picks up
one of Leo's wodden Indians and throws it at the Sheriff. A
councilman, who had been telling the Sheriff to use reserve, reminding
the Sheriff that the town's people were voters and a town was only
the sum of its people, nearly misses being hit. Fortunately the
councilman and the Sheriff duck but Scratchy, who had wandered
behind the deputies and passed out, is struck by the Indian and killed.
The councilman asks, "Say, who was that masked may anyway?"
A goat slips out the back way of the Sheriff's Office.
