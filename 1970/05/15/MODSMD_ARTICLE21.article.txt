On Learning that THE WINTER'S TALE too hud to be
discarded because of urgent political p r obl ;ms
After the cast had all but given us the first night's show,
Word comes that Shakespeare too must go.
By democratic vote the actors and the prop mer.
Elected to put time in on political matters
and who can stop them.
They could not bear to stand upon a stage
To utter well known phrases to attentive gazes
culturally improving, but there's no removing ihe holy rage
To fight the enemy of war with direct action—
But thoughts contraction gives us pause
After so much rehearsing, conversing with the lines
of that fine fable, was there no cause
No meaning, there, no flash of truth
that could be revealed, shared
with hundreds of playgoers
for laughter or for ruth?
Down with Shakespeare—for a whilc-
Humanistic stuff is grass to the mowers'
it's all dross, and painted tile and bourgeois trappings,
When it comes to reawakening Conscience from its nappings.
No meaning in Autolvcus,
No wonder or surmise—
The irrational king, the
pastoral myth
the struggle, the statue come to life—surprise.
No meaning here, no pith
for parties to politicize?
No failure of belief in art
Not that we do not love the play
But that we love more . . .
And all those who teach Posey
Put down their books, leave the glasses rosy.
But one actor or two protesting
believed the world was out of joint before
troops waded further into blood;
one actor's role was curiously part of his questing.
"If all of Asia, love, were to melt with the sun,
I'd be still upon the boards,
acting our play till it was done.
No naive illusion made the play worth doing,
Something there is
that does not like junking what is worth pursuing.
All is corrupt—more so than last week?
TIE WINTER'S TALE is worth no less
because the mighty maul the meek.
Throw all art away wait
until the weather clears?
but some have their fears
Since they heard Feste sing in another play
"the rain it raineth everyday".
