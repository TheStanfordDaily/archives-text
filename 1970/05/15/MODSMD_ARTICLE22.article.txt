# DOD Work

Editor, The Daily:
The defense department
supports basic research at
Stanford. The direct results of
that research cannot be
characterized as "harmful." Such
research only increases the pool of
knowledge available to mankind
from which ideas will be
withdrawn to solve future
problems. The methods used to
solve problems, and indeed the
choice of problem can be
characterized as "good", "bad",
harmful, or not harmful. But the
pool of knowledge is man's
potential for future evolution.
ALL of the DOD supported
research under question is
published in the scientific
literature and available
throughout the world.
I believe that there are, or
could be indirect effects resulting
from DOD supported research at
Stanford that are more difficult to
assess. By their very indirect
nature, these effects are not of the
'crises' -type, and therefore do not
demand hasty action. I urge every
THINKINO member of the
Stanford community to try to
acquaint himself with the
situation before, for example,
asking for a cessation of DOD
sponsored research on campus. In
my opinion the facts (the article
by Skip Harris in the May 7th
l)ail> states some of them quite
well) suggest that a build up of
support from- other agencies
would be beneficial, and that it
will take a lot of hard work plus
time before a significant amount
can be accomplished. Immediate
withdraw! of DOD funds will
harm the Stanford community
much more than the DOD.
