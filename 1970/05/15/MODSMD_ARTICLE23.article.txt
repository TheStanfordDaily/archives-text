Strike Stage Two
Editor, The Daily:
With the arrests of Jim Johnson
and Lenny Siegel this morning, we
are increasingly realizing what we
are doing by not doing hardly
anything. We are permitting
Lyman to arrest many of us in
fairly small numbers to pay for
the gains which this strike has
made for the rest, who believe
that the demands are just but are
too intimidated or depressed to
take further risks. At our last
meeting, Leo Bazile told us not to
take risks unless we had fairly
good chances of being effective.
He realized that taking buildings
or trashing would cost us more
than they would cost the
university—simply because the
university is now willing to isolate
and smash small numbers of
people who are taking any
effective action, whether violent
or non-violent. Our old options
are worn thin, so we have to
realistically reject many of them.
But we have some important
options still open, which can
rebuild not only our strike but
our resistance to repression. Ever
since most of you decided that
the strike was dead, certain
diehards have been doing things
which are keeping some pressure
on the University to meet the
demands. If we have the patience
to figure out how and why their
strategies can re-in force each
other and build our movement
back up, we can decide whether
or not we are willing to take risks
with those people and make
Strike Stage 2 work.
First, the people sitting in at
ROTC have gotten enough
support that this morning the SJC
did not take their names. Some of
them are asking faculty and
teaching staff to come sit-in with
them as well, department by
department, so that the numbers
go up and the departments close
down. People must be willing to
risk SJC harassment and possibly
misdemeanor charges for this—the
latter are seldom very heavy as
long as the group is large. This can
possibly rebuild the pressure
necessary for the university to
give in on the Off-ROTC demand.
The radical caucus and some
supporters are blocking the
entrance to Shipping and
Receiving—the central distribution
place for all materials that keep
the university running. Because
the Stanford drivers do not have a
union, and because some of them
want to join the Teamsters, many
Teamsters are honoring our strike
as long as we help out the
Stanford truckers who want to

unionize. If we can keep up our
line, the Teamsters may decide to
endorse it, after which few if any
supplies will get through, as
almost all the truckers coming in
are Teamsters. A week or more of
this will begirt to put subtle but
effective pre&sure on physical
operations of the University.
In order to raise money for
Stanford truckers who might lose
wages if they have nothing to
transport, we will need to go to
union meetings in the Bay Area
and ask for strike funds. When
we're there, we can invite those
workers to come join us at
Stanford—not just on the
picketline but in discussions on
the Quad and in liberated classes.
We can also invite other people,
but these workers could teach us a
great deal—they're the people who
never had a chance to get into
University's due to their class
backgrounds and consequent
economic limitations. We can
make a real effort to open the
university up, to try to learn from
the people whose needs this
university has generally refused to
serve, and they can learn from us
why we are on strike and what
our demands really mean.
Over 120 people paid for our
rights to incompletes and special
arrangements with time expelled
from school and in jail, as well as
fines. So we should go back to
Quad and really picket—demand
that all who believe that the US
get out of Southeast Asia, that
Stanford cut its ties to DOD, that
ROTC be thrown off campus and
out of this area, and that political
prisoners be defended and finally
freed—that these people not sneak
back to business as usual but build
the strike.
Many other proposals can fit
into the general thrust of this
strategy, but if we pass it we will
be really fucking each other over
unless we are really willing to
work on it.
Mary Hanson
Giant Playpen
Editor, The Daily:
To Leslie Campbell, who
sought out what she wanted to
find in Encina Hall, I offer this
alternative vision of the Strike in
the same exaggerated form: A
giant playpen full of hulking
babies, a Stanford professor
among the most babyish, all
throwing stones. and screaming
dirty words to, get their own way.
How many strikers fit that*
stereotype? There are many
bridges over the communication
gap. Is anyone really interested?
Pat Black
Staff in Encina Mall
Note— it is unfortunate that
my article concerning the
attitudes of some Encina workers
came across to readers as it did.
Although I- understand the
negative reception of my article as
it was written in the DAILY, I
would like to explain that that is

now hov\ I turned it in to the
DAILY. I write articles for the
DAILY. I do not edit them. I see
now that I will have to edit them
also to be sure they are written as
I write them.
I was assigned a news-feature
article on Encina worker
attitudes. I selected seven workers
at random and wrote in my article
just what they said and my
impressions of those particular
people. I found three to very
communicative and would not
judge all Encina workers by the
other four as copy editor of the
DAILY showed me to. do by
writing her own ending.
I am sorry that the article, as
printed, was unjustly offensive. I
am even more sorry for the
DAILY which has often been
unable to handle the truth.
Leslie Campbell
DAILY Staff
Note — as the person who
edited the article, let me respond
to both of the previous
objections. First, to Miss Black,
saying that virtually 'unbridgeable
communication gap' exists does
not cast aspersions on either side
of that gap, but merely points out
what is a regrettable lack of
understanding by both sides.
To Miss Campbell, the sentence
which I added to the end of the
article was not intended as a
distortion, but as a conclusion
which I honestly felt was implied
in your article and one which was
necessitated by brevity caused by
limited space.

Non- Violence
Editor, The Daily:
The Twain Non-Violence
Group is organized to promote
the maintainence of an open
campus as a center for effective
political and educational activity.
To this end we have formed
affinity groups to establish an
atmosphere of non-violence by
our visible presence on campus in
the unlikely event of further
confrontations similar to those of
last week. Though our groups
consist of individuals whose
persuasions range the entire
political spectrum, we are united
in our belief that a repetition of
past violence will only serve to
divide our recently united
campus, invite a possibly
dangerous confrontation, and
precipitate the closing of the
University. In the spirit of last
week's non-violent movements we
are dedicated to persuade, not
police, to convince, not coerce.
The campus must be kept
open —i.e. students living in their
rooms—so that they will have a
base of operations where they can
exchange information, coordinate
their actions in the community,
and affect decisions on urgent
matters of national policy. The

University gathers together people
of intelligence and humanitarian
concern in a concentration not to
be found elsewhere. The voice of
the University community must
not be silenced.

Benefit-cost A nalysis
Editor, The Daily:
Violent protest against the
genocide perpetuated by the U.S.
Army has broken glass on
Stanford campus. Many people
remark bitterly that the cost of
these windows could have been
used to help minority students
(would it have been?) or that it
will be paid by raising tuitions (in
civilized countries higher
education is free). I urge everyone
not to lose sight of the relative
magnitude of things.
The total value of Stanford (all
buildings, land and portfolio) is
250 million dollars (Harvard, 600;
Yale, 450). The current cost of a
Indochina war is 31 billion dollars
a year. Therefore:
Stanford's value is three days
of the war.
Harvard's value is one week of
the war.
Yale's value is five days of the
war.
The total cost of the Vietnam
war since 1965 has been 105
billion dollars. Therefore:
With the cost of this war, one
could have created four hundred
and twenty Stanfords.
The biggest project on campus
is a new computer center for
which 3.5 million dollars are
wanted: this can be found by
having the war stopped one hour
earlier.
The above mentioned costs are
only U.S. military costs. They
come from the U.S. federal
budget and therefore can be
strightforwardly shifted to higher
education. They take into account
only the cost of destroying. They
do not include the cost of what is
destroyed in Indochina, nor that
of defense by the Indochinese,
nor that of American lives, nor, of
course, that of the lives of Asians.

Research Reply
Editor, The Daily:
I was interested and encouraged
to see Phil Goldsmith's opinion
column, University's DOD
Research " appear in yesterday's
April 1 (sic) DAILY. I would like
to comment briefly on some
remarks Phil attributed to me.
Phil suggested that I believed
the DOD was engaged in an
essentially random process of
ripping off projects they have
been supporting in order to build
up a pile of bodies for the
Congress. While there may in fact
be some projects which were
terminated or not renewed for
that reason, it is perhaps more to
the point that Federal budgetary

pressures as a whole, and more
particularly within the DOD, are
primarily responsible for the
accelerated decline in the amount
of DOD support available to
Universities. Further, Stanford
investigators are not submitting
proposals to DOD at the rate
which obtained in earlier years.
The column also suggests I
believe that there is an element of
coercion that may attend DOD
support. As I observed in response
to a question at a SWOPSI
seminar last autumn, in theory at
least such things can occur, but I
lack any personal existence proof
to validate the hypothesis. The
ease with which a number of our
faculty have been able to switch
their research support from DOD
to other agencies would suggest
that the hypothesis may well be
generally invalid.
As points of fact, Dr. Miller, in
concert with the Research
Committee's subcommittee on
New Research Directions, is
working hard to develop new
sources of research support, and
they expect to have some of these
projects on stream by summer's
end. Further, I should observe
that the rate of decline of support
of unclassified research at
Stanford may increase sharply in
the coming months, which will, in
at least one sense, force the
redirection of effort to support
from other sources, although in
the interests of pluralism I would
think it desirable to have support
continue from DOD, on
acceptable terms, in the future.
As a matter of personal
opinion, I would think it
inconsistent with my
understanding of the definition of
freedom of inquiry which obtains
at institutes like Stanford for a
committee to be set up, as Phil
proposes, to apply a sort of moral
litmus test to research projects;
this, it seems to me, no matter
how emotionally appealing, spells
the end of unconstrained or
controversial inquiry in about the
only place I can think of where
that freedom exists.

Surrender
Mr. President:
After years of struggle I
surrender. You alone have the
power to wage war. However, I
would like one last chance to
repurchase my life. Enclosed is a
one dollar check for this purpose.
This sum appears to exceed, by a
substantial margin, the value
placed on my life by your
administration.
If your check is returned you
may infer that the profit to the
President was insufficient. Don't
give up, raise your offer.
