# Alumni To Confer On Educational Meaning
## 
### MARILYN L. MORRIS 
The nostalgia of "old school tie" alumni
reunions will be markedly absent at this Saturday's
Campus Conference, "The University and Society:
Education for What?"
Expanded by a number of ad hoc and
interdepartmental, strike-related convocations, the
Conference will focus on the realignment of the
academic disciplines with national priorities. "This
represents an extension of strike 'teach-outs' to
the greater Stanford community," explains Candy
Beery of Bowman Alumni House. Current
students, their families, and faculty will consult
with alumni and community members on issues of
mutual concern.
