# Special Security Police Hired
## 
### 
Private security police have
been hired recently to protect
several of Stanford's research
laboratories. Those involved
include AEL (Applied Electronics
Laboratory), ERL (Electronics
Research Laboratory), Durand
(Aeronautics and Astronautics),
McCullough (Electrical
Engineering) and Hanson
(Microwave Laboratory).
The labs decided to hire the
outside help because of the strain
on their own staff.
According to Astronautics
Professor Peter Sturrock the

outside help was required because
the strain of trying to protect
their own labs was too great for
the staff. Money to pay for the
police comes from the University.
The extra security is only
temporary and according to
Sturrock, "It isn't terribly
expensive."
David Bacon, director of the
ERL, said that although there has
been no "trashing" thus far, the
general atmosphere and
environment made it necessary to
hire the police.
