Comp. Sci . * Teach-Outs
Over 200 computer systems analysts, programmers, and others
active in data processing and electronics last night issued a statement
calling for an immediate end to the Indochina war. The group, which
has been leading "teach-outs" and distributing leaflets at industrial
firms on the San Francisco Peninsula, next week plans to continue
and intensify its anti-war activity at computer-related firms.
Representatives of IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Stanford Research
Institute, Control Date Corporation, Varian, and many other
corporations attended.
The idea of a "teach-out" is to share with the neighboring
community the knowledge and expertise the university possesses. The
university to clarify to the industrial community the causes
behind the recent widespread university-centered activity opposing
the Indochina war.
The group is also furnishing speakers on the current situation in
Cambodia and Vietnam, as well as on the current campus situation, to
interested parties. Organizations wishing to avail themselves of these
services should call Anne Harrington o- Mark Smith at Stanford
University, 321-2300, extension 3125.
Commmuuity For Peace
Calls for condemnation of oppressive elements within American
domestic policy and at the same time for redoubling efforts to
terminate the Indochinese War now were issued to a general meeting
of the Stanford Medical Community for Peace held Wednesday in the
medical school courtyard with 200 persons present.
To express the group's concern over oppression within American
society, the following resolution was passed: "We, the members of
the Stanford Medical Community for Peace, do hereby voice our rage
and sorrow at the actions leading to the death of six Black men in
Augusta, Georgia. This tragedy, following so closely the events at
Kent State, serves to emphasize our society's increasingly oppressive
and murderous response to dissent. We further believe that the
markedly different public reaction to the Kent and Augusta killings is
a reflection of the profoundly racist nature of our society. As
expressions of our deep concern with these events:
1) We pledge to keep the Medical Center flags at half mast
indefinitely.
2) We will send a letter to Augusta city government requesting
amnesty for all those arrested in the past week.
The resolution passed without objection.
Final action of the meeting was passage of a resolution urging that

the hospital follow the guidelines set forth in President Pitzer's letter
of May 11 and to all university employees. Under those guidelines,
hospital employees would be encouraged to participate in activities
related to the peace movement if they so wished, provided that their
work schedule won 1 ' 1 be arranged not to jeopardize patient care.

and sorrow at the actions leading to the death of six Black men in
Augusta, Georgia. This tragedy, following so closely the events at
Kent State, serves to emphasize our society's increasingly oppressive
and murderous response to dissent. We further believe that the
markedly different public reaction to the Kent and Augusta killings is
a reflection of the profoundly racist nature of our society. As
expressions of our deep concern with these events:
1) We pledge to keep the Medical Center flags at half mast
indefinitely.
2) We will send a letter to Augusta city government requesting
amnesty for all those arrested in the past week.
The resolution passed without objection.
Final action of the meeting was passage of a resolution urging that

the hospital follow the guidelines set forth in President Pitzer's letter
of May 11 and to all university employees. Under those guidelines,
hospital employees would be encouraged to participate in activities
related to the peace movement if they so wished, provided that their
work schedule won 1 ' 1 be arranged not to jeopardize patient care.

Comp. Sci . * Teach-Outs
Over 200 computer systems analysts, programmers, and others
active in data processing and electronics last night issued a statement
calling for an immediate end to the Indochina war. The group, which
has been leading "teach-outs" and distributing leaflets at industrial
firms on the San Francisco Peninsula, next week plans to continue
and intensify its anti-war activity at computer-related firms.
Representatives of IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Stanford Research
Institute, Control Date Corporation, Varian, and many other
corporations attended.
The idea of a "teach-out" is to share with the neighboring
community the knowledge and expertise the university possesses. The
university to clarify to the industrial community the causes
behind the recent widespread university-centered activity opposing
the Indochina war.
The group is also furnishing speakers on the current situation in
Cambodia and Vietnam, as well as on the current campus situation, to
interested parties. Organizations wishing to avail themselves of these
services should call Anne Harrington o- Mark Smith at Stanford
University, 321-2300, extension 3125.

Calls for condemnation of oppressive elements within American
domestic policy and at the same time for redoubling efforts to

To express the group's concern over oppression within American
society, the following resolution was passed: "We, the members of
the Stanford Medical Community for Peace, do hereby voice our rage
and sorrow at the actions leading to the death of six Black men in
Augusta, Georgia. This tragedy, following so closely the events at
