# Summer Anti-War Actions Planned
##

The place for whites to do
political action work is in their
own communities said Stokely
Carmichael. Today Mark Hoglund,
a junior, wants to insure that
Stanford students follow that
advice when they return home
this summer.
He's set up a skeleton program
for organizing communities to
insure that the momentum of the
strike doesn't dissipate over the
vacation. Hoglund, who has the
support of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, wants students to first
write to their friends all over the
nation and encourage them to
take positive action on their
campuses.
More importantly, he is urging
all members of the Stanford
community to coordinate political
action at home. That includes
canvassing neighborhoods,
speaking to any local clubs and

service organizations, leading
discussion groups, writing to local
newspapers on a regular basis, and
urging teachers to raise relevant
issues in their classrooms.
He has only outlined possible
approaches, since he believes that
each community has individual
needs and attitudes that can best
be handled by those who know
the areas.
His concern stems from a fear
that the nation may be ripped
asunder by the deep divisions that
face the country today. Prospects
for prolonged paralysis of the
economy and the disastrous
consequences of that event have
convinced him that students must
relate to their communities, as
soon as possible and with the
greatest possible effect.
"This type of community
action may be the last chance we
have to work within the system,"
Hoglund said.
