# Cranston Finds Petitions Effective
## 
### 
California Senator Alan
Cranston said university petitions
and lobbying in Washington have
been "most effective" in forcing
Congress toward a stand against
the war.
He predicted the Senate would
vote to cut off funds for the
Cambodian war and repeal the
Gulf of Tonkin resolution, but
would not set a fiscal cut-off
point for the Vietnam conflict.
"I believe we're gaining
ground," the dovish Senator told
the Daily in a telephone interview
arranged at his request
Wednesday. He reported "a
couple of Senators had been
visibly swayed" by anti-war
sentiment expressed to them.
The Democratic Senator said a
three-pronged strategy, in the
form of three amendments to the
military appropriations bill, is
being pursued to force a vote to
end the war.
The C o op e r - C h u r c h
amendment to stop funding the
Cambodian war will probably
come to a vote next week,
according to Cranston. He said the
resolution was now supported by
a bare majority - 51 Senators.
Congressional Power
Although the measure would
not speed up President Nixon's
announced withdrawal timetable,
it would force the Chief Executive
to consult Congress before
ordering re-entry of the country,
Cranston said.
Repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin

resolution formerly used as partial
justification for entering Vietnam,
has been recommended
unanimously from committee and
has President Nixon's support.
Cranston predicted the measure
would pass overwhelmingly, but
would not curtail the President's
powers.
The McGovern-Hatfield
amendment to restrict Vietnam
funding except for withdrawal
"has picked up strength" during
the past week, Cranston said. It
now has 22 sponsors and 8 other
firm supporters, according to the
Senator. Cranston expects the
measure to have 35 to 40 votes in
a month when it will probably be
taken up.
First Roll Call
If the amendment passes the
Senate, it will force a roll call vote
in the House. Cranston thinks a
recorded showdown might force
more anti-war votes, and will at
least make the record clear.
"There has never been a roll call
vote before on the war in the
House," Cranston said. "It will be
a real test vote."
If the House defeats the
measure, the Senate might still
prevail "if it is firm enough to
force a deadlock," Cranston
explained.
Cranston cautioned against
violent demonstrations, saying
violence during the November 15
Moratorium "probably helped
enable Nixon to carry on the
war."

would pass overwhelmingly, but
would not curtail the President's
powers.
The McGovern-Hatfield
amendment to restrict Vietnam
funding except for withdrawal
"has picked up strength" during
the past week, Cranston said. It
now has 22 sponsors and 8 other
firm supporters, according to the
Senator. Cranston expects the
measure to have 35 to 40 votes in
a month when it will probably be
taken up.
First Roll Call
If the amendment passes the
Senate, it will force a roll call vote
in the House. Cranston thinks a
recorded showdown might force
more anti-war votes, and will at
least make the record clear.
"There has never been a roll call
vote before on the war in the
House," Cranston said. "It will be
a real test vote."
If the House defeats the
measure, the Senate might still
prevail "if it is firm enough to
force a deadlock," Cranston
explained.
Cranston cautioned against
violent demonstrations, saying
violence during the November 15
Moratorium "probably helped
enable Nixon to carry on the
war."
