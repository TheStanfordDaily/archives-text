# Gardner Speech
## 
### 
The Illinois Constitutional convention refused to let John W.
Gardner deliver a speech he had planned to give critical of President
Nixon's decision to invade Cambodia.
The former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a
Stanford trustee had planned to say that no advantage gained by force
in Southeast Asia could compare with the damage that the war was
inflicting at home. His prepared text also said that "ill-considered
statements from those in high places" could be as destructive as
violence.
In response to a question at a news conference Gardner said that
Vice President Agnew was one of those he had in mind.
His text, which was released belore the scheduled speech was
cancelled, said that virtually all ol us have failed in our duty as
Americans," falling easily into the pattern of blaming others while the
nation "disintegrates."
Gardner, a Republican who is chairman of the National Urban
Coalition dealt in his speech with what many feel is the crisis of
confidence that, alfiicts the nation causing multiple rifts—"between
old and young, between regions, between social classes."
