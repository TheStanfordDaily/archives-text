# Films In Preview
## Weekend Films Lack Taste 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Depending on your sense of
humor, you might find the films
showing on campus this weekend
entertaining.
Saturday at 7, 9 and 11 in
Cubberley, the Celluloid
Syndicate will sponsor 'Wait Until
Dark,' with part of the proceeds
going to Legal Defense. Terence
Young, ('Dr. No,' 'From Russia
With Love,' 'Thunderball,' and
'The Amorous Adventures of Moll
Flanders') faithfully transplanted
Frederick Knott's play onto the
screen and the result is a very
tense, suspenseful, and exciting
movie.
Blind Suspicion
Definitely theatrical, 'Wait
Until Dark' is set in a New York
basement apartment in which a
young wife (Audrey Hepburn),
recently blinded in a car accident,
has an uneventful day turned into
a nightmare when her home is
invaded by Alan Arkin, Richard
Crenna, and Jack Weston, looking
for a doll full of heroin which has
accidently fallen into her
possession.
They implement an elaborate

scheme to trick her into revealing
its whereabouts, but the scheme
only results in crude violence as
she becomes more suspicious and
increasingly stubborn.
When 'Wait Until Dark' was
first released, advertisements
stated that the management
would not allow anyone to enter
during the last five minutes. While
waiting in the lobby to see a
second feature showing with 'Wait
Until Dark,' my interest was
aroused by gasps and screams, not
coming from the screen, but the
audience. Needless to say, I
looked in at precisely the wrong
moment and as a result I didn't
have to stay for the other two
hours.
Saggy-Surreal Saga
The Tresidder Saturday Film
Series will feature Robert
Downey's 'Chafed Elbows' and
James Broughton's 'The Bed' at 7,
8, and 9 in Tresidder.
Downey, best known for his
stupid film 'Putney Swope,'seems
to have a childish fascination for
sick humor and the absurd. His
second feature effort, which cost
$25,000 and took two years to
make, is just as sick and absurd as
all his other films.
It has been described as the
saggy-surreal saga of a Village
idiot who marries his mother, lives
on welfare and hopes to get rich
quick by persuading female
midgets to use contact lenses as
contraceptives.
In an effort not to deviate from
his style, which is nothing more
than a lack of taste, Downey has
decided to make a cinematic
version of 'Comeuppance,' a play
he wrote and appeared in in 1961.
All the actors portray dogs in a

pound waiting to be adopted, or
gassed. There's a greyhound
whose legs have worn out and a
German shepherd who keeps
trying to make it with a French
poodle, who rejects him by
saying, 'Not after what your
country did to mine.' Too much
of a bad thing can be very dull.
In, or on, the second feature,
'The Bed,' a monumental old bed
serves as a kind of world stage
where people enact symbolic
scenes from the human comedy.
Second Rate Social Commentary
The Sunday Flicks will present
'Goodbye Columbus' at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium. Ali
MacGraw and Richard Benjamin
star in this terrible adaptation of
Philip Roth's novella. MacGraw is
literally too much as the Cliffie
who had her nose and psyche
fixed. So is Michael Meyers who
plays older brother Ron, the
super-jock who loves
Mantovanni's music.
Richard Benjamin in no way
resembles Roth's character of
Neil, the academic and social
drop-out librarian. Director Larry
Peerce can't seem to distinguish
between caricatures and comedy.
Besides, after 'The Graduate' any
such film could only be second
rate.

Theatre in San Francisco, on
Beach near Hyde is showing 'The
Scarlet Letter' with Lillian Gish

WAITING—Audrey Hepburn as Suzy Hendrix is blind to Iter late as she "Wait(s)
Until Dark," showing at Cubberlcy this Saturday.


STOP THK WAR—This poster, designed and printed by an undergraduate, was
one of the works sold in the recent art sale, one of the first projects of the
California Art For Peace Committee to be undertaken at Stanford.
Depending on your sense of
humor, you might find the films
showing on campus this weekend
entertaining.
Saturday at 7, 9 and 11 in
Cubberley, the Celluloid
Syndicate will sponsor 'Wait Until
Dark,' with part of the proceeds
going to Legal Defense. Terence
Young, ('Dr. No,' 'From Russia
With Love,' 'Thunderball,' and
'The Amorous Adventures of Moll
Flanders') faithfully transplanted
Frederick Knott's play onto the
screen and the result is a very
tense, suspenseful, and exciting
movie.
Blind Suspicion
Definitely theatrical, 'Wait
Until Dark' is set in a New York
basement apartment in which a
young wife (Audrey Hepburn),
recently blinded in a car accident,
has an uneventful day turned into
a nightmare when her home is
invaded by Alan Arkin, Richard
Crenna, and Jack Weston, looking
for a doll full of heroin which has
accidently fallen into her
possession.
They implement an elaborate

scheme to trick her into revealing
its whereabouts, but the scheme
only results in crude violence as
she becomes more suspicious and
increasingly stubborn.
When 'Wait Until Dark' was
first released, advertisements
stated that the management
would not allow anyone to enter
during the last five minutes. While
waiting in the lobby to see a
second feature showing with 'Wait
Until Dark,' my interest was
aroused by gasps and screams, not
coming from the screen, but the
audience. Needless to say, I
looked in at precisely the wrong
moment and as a result I didn't
have to stay for the other two
hours.
Saggy-Surreal Saga
The Tresidder Saturday Film
Series will feature Robert
Downey's 'Chafed Elbows' and
James Broughton's 'The Bed' at 7,
8, and 9 in Tresidder.
Downey, best known for his
stupid film 'Putney Swope,'seems
to have a childish fascination for
sick humor and the absurd. His
second feature effort, which cost
$25,000 and took two years to
make, is just as sick and absurd as
all his other films.
It has been described as the
saggy-surreal saga of a Village
idiot who marries his mother, lives
on welfare and hopes to get rich
quick by persuading female
midgets to use contact lenses as
contraceptives.
In an effort not to deviate from
his style, which is nothing more
than a lack of taste, Downey has
decided to make a cinematic
version of 'Comeuppance,' a play
he wrote and appeared in in 1961.
All the actors portray dogs in a

pound waiting to be adopted, or
gassed. There's a greyhound
whose legs have worn out and a
German shepherd who keeps
trying to make it with a French
poodle, who rejects him by
saying, 'Not after what your
country did to mine.' Too much
of a bad thing can be very dull.
In, or on, the second feature,
'The Bed,' a monumental old bed
serves as a kind of world stage
where people enact symbolic
scenes from the human comedy.
Second Rate Social Commentary
The Sunday Flicks will present
'Goodbye Columbus' at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium. Ali
MacGraw and Richard Benjamin
star in this terrible adaptation of
Philip Roth's novella. MacGraw is
literally too much as the Cliffie
who had her nose and psyche
fixed. So is Michael Meyers who
plays older brother Ron, the
super-jock who loves
Mantovanni's music.
Richard Benjamin in no way
resembles Roth's character of
Neil, the academic and social
drop-out librarian. Director Larry
Peerce can't seem to distinguish
between caricatures and comedy.
Besides, after 'The Graduate' any
such film could only be second
rate.
