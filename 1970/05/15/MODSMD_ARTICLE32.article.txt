And now, for all of yoo hoo
like the curse, we all (40 of us at

bedroom house in Palo Alto

Stanford, some escapees from the
wars, y'know, at S.F. States, and
others from other stars.

There we all was. (40 of us at

doing their best. Good morning

my body and life.
Then we went to Ashland then
we went to Cotati then we went
to Belmont then we went to Daly
City then we went to San
Francisco then we went to San
Francisco now we live in San

And now, for all of yoo hoo
like the curse, we all (40 of us at
first) lived together in a two
bedroom house in Palo Alto
(that's right, folks! Palo Alto.
Your hometown.) for about two
months. Some refugees from
Stanford, some escapees from the
wars, y'know, at S.F. States, and
others from other stars.
In the Middle of her Toilette
The Gestalt Fool, a communal
theater family, has been living and
working together for over a year,
developing theater technique

related to gestalt, ritual, and
transformation. They will be at
Stanford on May 19th and 21st at
8:00 P.M. in Branner Hall with
Thingie. $2.00 donations are
requested but not demanded.
There we all was. (40 of us at
first) But far outside of the pithy
details, it was swell, to say the
least. All those friends, y'know,
doing their best. Good morning
sun, you beautiful sun, you warm
my body and life.
Then we went to Ashland then
we went to Cotati then we went
to Belmont then we went to Daly
City then we went to San
Francisco then we went to San
Francisco now we live in San
Francisco.
(Tune in again on Monday's
Daily for the second thrill packed
installment on My Dummy
brought to you by the Gestalt
Fool Theater Family.)
(The above is an unpaid-for
political announcement brought
at you by citizens for Thingie.
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!) (20
percent of the donations to
Thingie will go to Legal Defense.)
Crying holy unto the Lord.
Crying holy unto the Lord.
In that day when the bells
don't toll
Crying holy unto the Lord.
Get yourself crazy. In sanity
there is no escape.
Out at last
By the sea and the rock
(gestalt)
through an arch in the cliff
(fool)
we began (theater family)
Yo ho victory!
His other is proudly presenting
itself to you. It's a sandwich. His
brother is at the Branner banner
beside himself. Tuesday and
Thursday don't forget. His mother
at 8. His other brother's mother
is.
We have all been together in
this way (see above) as a
tablecloth and other dishes.
