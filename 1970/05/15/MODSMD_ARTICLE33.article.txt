# Art Sale A Success
## 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
The first day of the 'Doing Our
Tiling' in White Plaza was so
successful that it raised $900 for
Stanford's Washington Delegation.
The sale of art work of Stanford
art students and faculty was the
first of four projects under way
by the newly formed California
Art for Peace Committee. The
organization is a positive response
to the Cambodian and domestic
crisis of the past two weeks.
The Committee headquarters at
Stanford is a voluntary
organization of art students,
faculty and staff. The art sale is
the initial fund raising project -
and now that the funds for the
Washington Delegation have been
raised, money from the
continuation of the art sale will go
for the following purposes of the
Committee:
1 ) To find and support peace
candidates.
2) To work for better
understanding between the
University and the community on
divisive political issues.
3) To support legal and
responsible efforts to end the war
in Southeast Asia.
The most dynamic and exciting
project that the Committee has
jumped into so far is assembling
an exhibit of anti-war protest art
work done by students and

faculty at all the California
colleges in the past two weeks.
The anti-war exhibit will be
showing in Washington, D.C.,
hopefully on June 15th to
counter Nixon's scheduled Youth
Conference.
Eighty-five schools in California
have been contacted so far and
the response has been
'overwhelming.' The exhibit will
be multi-media and include films
made by the Communications
Department, live sound tracks,
lights, and a catalogue that tells
the story of the college protest
movement with photographs of
the exhibit pieces and
commentary.
The purpose of the exhibit is
both documentary and polemic. It
will be shown in various parts of
the country to present 'college
protest through the visual arts' to
people who have not understood
the impact of the college
movement.
Many pieces in the show will be
aesthetically rough but contain a
high voltage impact. Using
graphics, paintings, sculpture,
photographs, films, and sound the
show will create a 'total
environment' for the viewer. Its
power and spontaneity will
convey the sense of urgency of
the protest as if its contents had
been literally 'ripped off the
walls.'
