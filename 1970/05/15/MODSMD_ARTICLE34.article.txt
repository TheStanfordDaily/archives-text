## 'Blood Knot'-A Showcase Of Talent 
### PAT THOMAS 
Plays about race suffer the
•same inherent liability as plays
about prison: there is simply
nothing earth-shattering left to be
said. In spite of this, the American
Conservatory Theater's
production of BLOOD KNOT is
worth seeing.
BLOOD KNOT, by South
African playwright Athol Eugard,
is in this production a showcase
for two fine actors. It deals with
two brothers, one black and one
white, who have the same black
mother. They live together in the
non-white section of a South
African village.
Morris, the white brother, is
played by veteran ACT actor John
Schuck—better known as the
dentist "Painless" in M*A*S*H*.
As Morris, Schuck is always on
the quiet side of frantic—alter
nately domineering and
submissive—always intensely
4 roubled.
He has reason to be troubled.
For many years he lived as a white
man, in constant fear of having his
parentage discovered. Finally
Morris seeks out his black brother
Zachariah (Gilbert Lewis) simply
because he cannot forget his
existence.
The play begins a year after
Morris has moved into Zachariah's
one-room shack. Morris has
separated Zachariah from his
friends and intimidated him into
saving all his earnings to buy a
small farm. Suddenly Zachariah
announces that he wants a woman
instead of endless evenings spent
listening to Morris read the Bible.

Unfortunately this initial
conflict is a confrontation of
racial stereotypes rather than of
believable human beings. Morris is
pseudo-intellectual, sexually
impotent, guilty about being
white, and imprisoned by rigid
rationality. Zachariah is illiterate,
pleasure-oriented, playful, and
easily subjugated.
Morris naively decides that
Zachariah's needs can be satisfied
by a female pen pal. Together
they pick a name from a
newspaper advertisement, and
Zachariah reluctantly dictates a
letter which Morris takes down.
When the answering letter comes,
it includes a picture of Zachariah's
new long distance lover—a white
woman. This is harmless enough,
until Ethel announces that she is
coming to visit her uncle who lives
in the same town as the brothers.
Morris is immobilized by fear,
and the balance of power begins
to change. Gilbert Lewis
effectively changes Zachariah
from a passive, sulking character
to one who is capable of acting in
a potentially dangerous situation.
He convinces Morris to substitute
for him in the meeting with Ethel,
and spends their savings in a
shopping spree for the proper
clothes. ,
The proper clothes are of
course white man's clothes, and
while Morris sleeps Zachariah tries
them on. Lewis has one of his best
moments as he addresses his dead
mother, and voices his resentment
of the preferential treatment
which his lighter brother always

received.
Having chosen to abandon the
white world, Morris finds it
impossible to return even with
high-quality props. He decides to
leave rather than face Ethel. Just
before he does, she writes to say
that she is engaged to someone
else and will not come.
At this point Eugard abandons
his story and makes the meaning
of his play extravangantly
obvious. In case you hadn't
noticed, this is not a play about
two brothers named Morris and
Zachariah. It is a play about all
black men and all white men who
must acknowledge their common
humanity (the blood knot) in
order to live together in the world
(the village by the dead lake).

in a symbol-smothered play
within a play, Morris becomes a
white tourist at the park where
Zachariah is employed.
Zachariah's job is to chase black
children away from the gates, and
he traps the white man in the park
after everyone else has gone. His
first impulse is to strangle his
oppressor, but failing that he
agrees that they continue to
live together by the,, rotting lake.
In spite of this somewhat cheap
allegorical ending, director Gilbert
Moses has staged an engrossing
two-man show. The first few
scenes drag slightly, but fine
performances by Schuck and
Lewis more than compensate for
this.
The South African setting is

largely established by Warner
Jerson's mysterious music. It
sounds somewhat like muted fog
horns and sirens, the soundtrack
from a space adventure, jungle
noises, or music from a
nightmare—and a lot like a flock
of electric seagulls.
The set by Jackson DeGovia
looks as though primary school
children were asked to cut clouds
out of old corrugated tin Coke
and beer signs. These shapes are
suspended above a potpourri of
junk including rusty bedsprings
and deformed packing crates. It's
easy to look at for a couple of
hours.
BLOOD KNOT can be seen at
the Marines Memorial Theater
through June.
