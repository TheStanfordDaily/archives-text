## Experimenting On The Egg 
### CATHY COOPER 
Not infrequently I enter the
kitchen about dinner time to find
that I have nothing WHATEVER
to serve. This usually occurs when
I'm bordering exhaustion and the
markets are closed. In these
situations the egg and I renew oui
acquaintance.
Unfortunately I can seldom get
by with serving poached eggs for
dinner—that would be too easy.
Greater feats are require'.
If your audience is agreeable
you can scramble eggs with the
addition of grated Cheddar
cheese, or sauted green onion, or

ieft over ham, or seafood and a
little sherry. But if circumstances
require something more elaborate,
try these only somewhat more
complicated ideas.
