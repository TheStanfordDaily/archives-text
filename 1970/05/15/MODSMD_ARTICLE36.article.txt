## Lateef In Diverse Moods THE 						DIVERSE YUSEF LATEEF 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Jazz is a music expressing what
some call the soul, others the
essence, of a people, black people.
Jazz is to classical music as rugby
is to the opening at Ascot. Each
has its aficionados, and enjoying
one does not preclude
appreciating the other. But while
concert music can be that thrilling
experience which comes from
watching an exquisite
performance, jazz must be a
commun'ty effort of audience and
performer, a sound expressing the
performer's agonies and pleasures,
not the composer's. Jazz is a total
experience.
The contribution of the
audience makes live jazz records
the best musically, although often
poor technically. Studio
recordings have the advantage of
superior quality, but sometimes
come off as cardboard cutouts.
One outfit that seems to make
studio recordings with live gestalt
is Atlantic Records, which has
some of today's greatest jazzmen
at its mikes. One of the more
remarkable is Yusef Lateef.
DISCO
Yusef has four recent albums
out, expressing different sides of
the man. "The Complete Yusef
Lateef," "The Blue Yusef
Lateef," and "Yusef Lateef's
Detroit" all represent
distinguished offerings, but the
most recent release, "The Diverse
Yusef Lateef," best shows what
he is and what he can do.
"Diverse" is aptly named. It
shows off the man as a composer
as well as a musician, and records
his talents on tenor sax, flute, and
a variety of flute-like instruments.
As opposed to the flute sound of
Herbie Mann, Yusef's varied flute
technique will approach alto sax
style at one point, but can retreat
all the way to the silk sound of

Oriental melody. This is strikingly
illustrated on the album, in the
contrast between the dazzle of
"Eboness" (written by and
featuring drummer Roy Brooks)
to the languor and spiritualism of
"A Long Time Ago," one of
Lateef's own songs.
Funky Fusion
The other two cuts were both
written by Lateef, and feature
some interesting jazz wrinkles.
"Chandra" is described as the
fusion of a fugue and a tone
poem, but the more intriguing
combination is sound rather than
form. The foundation is played by
string quartet, is tonal and
classically based. This is merged
with a flute solo in stark contrast,

for it relies on the atonality of
contemporary music. The
combination is exciting jazz.
"Live Humble" leads off the
album, a track which might be
labeled as "heavy swing." The
instrumentation here is
responsible for the distinctive
sound: tenor, piano, Fender bass,
acoustic bass, conga, and trap set.
The song is fine, but I would
dispute the title. A humble jazz
musician is as rare as a full
weeknight at the Both/And.
Which brings me to a final note.
Freddie Hubbard, another
Atlantic artist, plays the
Both/And, 350 Divisadero,
through Sunday. He blows jazz
trumpet, and is well worth seeing.
Shows start at 9:30 p.m.

performer, a sound expressing the
performer's agonies and pleasures,
not the composer's. Jazz is a total
experience.
The contribution of the
audience makes live jazz records
the best musically, although often
poor technically. Studio
recordings have the advantage of
superior quality, but sometimes
come off as cardboard cutouts.
One outfit that seems to make
studio recordings with live gestalt
is Atlantic Records, which has
some of today's greatest jazzmen
at its mikes. One of the more
remarkable is Yusef Lateef.
DISCO
Yusef has four recent albums
out, expressing different sides of
the man. "The Complete Yusef
Lateef," "The Blue Yusef
Lateef," and "Yusef Lateef's
Detroit" all represent
distinguished offerings, but the
most recent release, "The Diverse
Yusef Lateef," best shows what
he is and what he can do.
"Diverse" is aptly named. It
shows off the man as a composer
as well as a musician, and records
his talents on tenor sax, flute, and
a variety of flute-like instruments.
As opposed to the flute sound of
Herbie Mann, Yusef's varied flute
technique will approach alto sax
style at one point, but can retreat
all the way to the silk sound of

Oriental melody. This is strikingly
illustrated on the album, in the
contrast between the dazzle of
"Eboness" (written by and
featuring drummer Roy Brooks)
to the languor and spiritualism of
"A Long Time Ago," one of
Lateef's own songs.
Funky Fusion
The other two cuts were both
written by Lateef, and feature
some interesting jazz wrinkles.
"Chandra" is described as the
fusion of a fugue and a tone
poem, but the more intriguing
combination is sound rather than
form. The foundation is played by
string quartet, is tonal and
classically based. This is merged
with a flute solo in stark contrast,

for it relies on the atonality of
contemporary music. The
combination is exciting jazz.
"Live Humble" leads off the
album, a track which might be
labeled as "heavy swing." The
instrumentation here is
responsible for the distinctive
sound: tenor, piano, Fender bass,
acoustic bass, conga, and trap set.
The song is fine, but I would
dispute the title. A humble jazz
musician is as rare as a full
weeknight at the Both/And.
Which brings me to a final note.
Freddie Hubbard, another
Atlantic artist, plays the
Both/And, 350 Divisadero,
through Sunday. He blows jazz
trumpet, and is well worth seeing.
Shows start at 9:30 p.m.

Jazz is a music expressing what
some call the soul, others the
essence, of a people, black people.
Jazz is to classical music as rugby
is to the opening at Ascot. Each
has its aficionados, and enjoying
one does not preclude
appreciating the other. But while
concert music can be that thrilling
experience which comes from
watching an exquisite
performance, jazz must be a
commun'ty effort of audience and
performer, a sound expressing the
performer's agonies and pleasures,
not the composer's. Jazz is a total
experience.
