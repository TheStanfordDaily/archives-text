# The 						Armband Games

### DON TOLLEFSON 
Amidst rumors that they plan
some sort of symbolic protest in
support of the student strike, 21
Stanford tracksters are in Los
Angeles this weekend for the
Pacific-8 Conference Track Meet.
There are indications that some
Stanford competitors, deeply
concerned with the current
political scene, would like in some
way to symbolize that protest.
There are also indications that
Coach Payton Jordan will not
allow such action, and that several
athletes will comply with the
coaches' wishes.
But the status of the others was
unclear yesterday. The Cal team,
in addition to wearing armbands,
has said that it will provide them
for the other seven competing

teams, a circumstance which
could put several individuals on
the spot in front of the multitudes
at UCLA's track stadium.
See It!
Sports freaks, track phenoms
and all other politicos will be able
to catch the Saturday action on
KTVU, Channel 2, starting at 2
p.m.
Looking at the dope sheet for
the two day event, Stanford's best
chance for team notoriety might
be found in a protest. The Indians
could finish sixth but a higher
position is extremely doubtful.
There are rio Stanford entries in
the sprints and in the 440, Chuck
Francis (48.5) won't be a real
threat. The Red relay teams both
have the worst times in the league.

In the hurdles there are four Card
entries but none of these are
potential winners either.
In the distances the Tribe will
probably pick up the most points.
Miler Duncan Mac Donald (4:05.6)
has a good chance against a tough
field. In the three mile Don
Kardong (13:43) and Greg Brock
(13:49.0) will be pitted against
Oregon's freshman sensation Steve
Prefontaine (13:12.8) in what
promises to be a great race.
Fielder's Choice
The Indians also have a couple
of field performers who could
pick up valuable points. Long
jumper Tom Anderson (24-10'/2),
triple jumper Allen Meredith
(50-1IV4) and pole vaulter Casey
Carrigan (160) all could place.
Discus thrower Steve Davis
(176-9) might also score.
Five teams have a shot at the
team title in the meet with
defending champs UCLA and
1969 runner-up Oregon favored.
Cal, Washington State and USC all
are darkhorses with Oregon State,
Washington and Stanford bringing
up the rear.
The meet will be held in
UCLA's track and field complex
with its spanking new Tartan
track. The action will start today
at 3 p.m. with finals in the long
jump, javelin, shot put and
steeple-chase as well as trials in
other events. The other finals will
be held tomorrow starting at
1:15.

LAWâ€”Tuesday's Stanford-Santa Clara game got off to a typically rousing start
when Indian centerfielder Mike Ewing and the base umpire disagreed on die
legality of a cateh Ewing either made or did not make. Only the presence of Steve
Dunning (24) seems to be preventing a more serious altercation here.
