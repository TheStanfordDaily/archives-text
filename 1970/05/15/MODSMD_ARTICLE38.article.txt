Coming off a pair of decisive
(to put it mildly) victories last
weekend, Stanford's lacrosse team
ventures to Los Angeles tomorrow
for its second major road trip of
the year, meeting UCLA on
Saturday and the L.A. lacrosse
club on Sunday.
A week ago the Indians
tromped Oregon 19-5, then
traveled to the east bay to whip

the East Bay Lacrosse club 10-5
and clinch first place in the
Northern California Lacrosse
Assn.
Chip Loveman and Butch
Hazlett put in outstanding
performances against the visiting
Ducks, pouring in six goals and
two goals and four assists
respectively.
Oregon, whose spirited play
was simply dominated by
Stanford's superior stick handling
ability, came through with a few
bright moments in the third
period when it managed to score
three goals in two minutes.
But the other pair were few and
far between.
Loveman and Hazlett paced the
Indians again against East Bay,
Loveman scoring three goals and
adding four assists, and Hazlett
tallying two of each.
Coach Hugh West, however,
was less impressed with his
defense, which let each of East
Bay's attackmen score at one time
or another.
The Indians return home and
close out the season with a May
23 fixture with California.
