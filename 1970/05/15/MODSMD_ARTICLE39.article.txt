## Diamond Finales 
### 
A baseball season which has been as promising as it's been
disappointing concludes this weekend for the Stanford nine with a
home and home series with California. The traditional rivals face each
other here today, starting at 3 p.m., then play at 2 p.m. in Berkeley
tomorrow.
Mathematically eliminated from the Pacific-B's Southern Division
playoffs last weekend, Stanford will be nonetheless seeking to avenge
an earlier loss to the Bears. Pitching this afternoon will be Steve
Dunning, the powerful righthander who leads the nation with 137
strikeouts.
Hit by a pitch on his throwing arm in the first inning of last
Friday's game at Washington State, Dunning had the limb tighten up
on him and was able to fan only two batters, a shade below his 13
average. But it was "just a bruise," he says, and he's felt good all week
long.
Soph Bob Kammeyer, who shut out Washington on two hits last
weekend, and senior Phil Keller, who beat Santa Clara Tuesday, are in
the cards for the Saturday start.


AND ORDERâ€”When pitcher Phil Keller had the temerity to dispute the
judgement of the man in blue behind the plate, die latter initiated this dialogue,
the rationality of which was never precisely determined. Luckily, perhaps, both
Ewing (above) and Keller have only two more opportunities to dispute die timps.
They are both seniors.
