# Undergraduate Grading Change Approved By Faculty Senate
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Following more than three
years' study, the faculty Senate
yesterday approved a
comprehensive overhaul of the
grading system for
undergraduates.
Probably starting this fall, the
only penalty for failure to
complete an undergraduate course
satisfactorily will be loss of credit
toward graduation—the "D" and
"F" grades will be eliminated.
The only grades recorded will
be "A" for exceptional
performance, "B" for superior

performance, "C" for satisfactory
performance, and "pass" for
non-letter-graded work equivalent
to a "C" or better.
Yesterday's action eliminated
plus and minus marks and opened
the pass—no credit grading option
to any course, "subject only to
the consent of the instructor and
the department concerned." The
Committee on Undergradiate
Studies (CUS) will also place no
limit on the number of "pass"
courses that a student may take,
although departments and schools
may limit this number.

The committee recommended
that the proposals go into effect
next fall although the Senate has
not yet voted on the time for
implementation of the changes.
No GAP
The Committee on
Undergraduate Studies' report as
it was adopted also eliminated the
computation of a
grade-point-average. Instead, a
"Letter Grade Indicator (LGI)
will be computed for each
student, to one decimal point
only. The LGI will be released
only upon the written request of
the student, for use in
applications for scholarships,
fellowships, entrance to graduate
and professional schools, etc."
The report said "The pass
option is intended to relieve the
pressure on students for
achievement in grades in order to
enable them to concentrate their
energies more effectively on their
main courses of study."
The action also approved a

proposal that will allow students
to drop a course "at any time up
to 24 hours before the final
examination, with concurrent loss
of credit." The only penalty for
failing to finish the work of a
course taken as an incomplete will
also merely be loss of credit.
Flexibility Urged
The report urged great
flexibility in examinations and
mentioned as examples "in-class
written essay examinations,
take-home essay examinations,
oral examinations, objective
examinations, papers, projects."
The Senate ruled that final
in-class written examinations for
courses of more than two units
will be no more than three hours
• in length and that examinations in
"one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the
next-to-last week of classes."
Other changes approved by the
Senate included the elimination of
the so-called grading "curve" and
a strong discouragement of

"awarding grades according to any
predetermined Distribution
system."
The Senate recommended that
the Committee on Graduate
Studies consider similar proposals
for graduate grading. The Senate
has not received a report from
that committee on these issues.

only penalty for failure to
complete an undergraduate course
satisfactorily will be loss of credit
toward graduation—the "D" and
"F" grades will be eliminated.
The only grades recorded will
be "A" for exceptional
performance, "B" for superior

performance, "C" for satisfactory
performance, and "pass" for
non-letter-graded work equivalent
to a "C" or better.
Yesterday's action eliminated
plus and minus marks and opened
the pass—no credit grading option
to any course, "subject only to
the consent of the instructor and
the department concerned." The
Committee on Undergradiate
Studies (CUS) will also place no
limit on the number of "pass"
courses that a student may take,
although departments and schools
may limit this number.

The committee recommended
that the proposals go into effect
next fall although the Senate has
not yet voted on the time for
implementation of the changes.
No GAP
The Committee on
Undergraduate Studies' report as
it was adopted also eliminated the
computation of a
grade-point-average. Instead, a
"Letter Grade Indicator (LGI)
will be computed for each
student, to one decimal point
only. The LGI will be released
only upon the written request of
the student, for use in
applications for scholarships,
fellowships, entrance to graduate
and professional schools, etc."
The report said "The pass
option is intended to relieve the
pressure on students for
achievement in grades in order to
enable them to concentrate their
energies more effectively on their
main courses of study."
The action also approved a

proposal that will allow students
to drop a course "at any time up
to 24 hours before the final
examination, with concurrent loss
of credit." The only penalty for
failing to finish the work of a
course taken as an incomplete will
also merely be loss of credit.
Flexibility Urged
The report urged great
flexibility in examinations and
mentioned as examples "in-class
written essay examinations,
take-home essay examinations,
oral examinations, objective
examinations, papers, projects."
The Senate ruled that final
in-class written examinations for
courses of more than two units
will be no more than three hours
• in length and that examinations in
"one or two-unit courses must be
completed by the end of the
next-to-last week of classes."
Other changes approved by the
Senate included the elimination of
the so-called grading "curve" and
a strong discouragement of

"awarding grades according to any
predetermined Distribution
system."
The Senate recommended that
the Committee on Graduate
Studies consider similar proposals
for graduate grading. The Senate
has not received a report from
that committee on these issues.
Following more than three
years' study, the faculty Senate
yesterday approved a
comprehensive overhaul of the
grading system for
undergraduates.
Probably starting this fall, the
only penalty for failure to
complete an undergraduate course
satisfactorily will be loss of credit
toward graduation—the "D" and
"F" grades will be eliminated.
The only grades recorded will
be "A" for exceptional
performance, "B" for superior

performance, "C" for satisfactory
performance, and "pass" for
non-letter-graded work equivalent
to a "C" or better.
