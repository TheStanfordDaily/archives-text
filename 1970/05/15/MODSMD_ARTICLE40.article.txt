# Meet Attracts Nation's Best
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
Twelve west coast teams,
featuring some of the nation's
finest women swimmers, converge
on the Stanford Women's Pool
tomorrow for the fifth annual
Stanford Invitational Swim Meet.
The Stanford squad, which won
the first meet five years ago, is not
expected to be a team threat to
such powerhouse teams as UCLA
and Santa Clara University, but
Mrs. Marianna Fowler, meet
director and coach of the
Stanford swimmers, is looking
forward to several fine individual
performances.
"We are not as strong as we
have been in the past,"
commented Mrs. Fowler, "and it
doesn't look like, with all the top
times seeded, that we'll be in the
top five."
Mrs. Fowler was undoubtedly
referring to the rash of Olympic
and AAU stars from UCLA, Santa
Clara, and the University of
Washington, most of whom pose a
threat to meet and national
records in several events.
Leading the UCLA contingent
is two-time Olympic participant
Pokey Watson. Miss Watson swam
in both the 1961 and 1968
Olympics, and is one of the
nation's top backstrokers.
Her Tokyo Olympic teammate,
Cathy Cullum (better known as
Cathy Fergusen) was considered
one of the world's best backstroke
competitors until her marriage
two years ago; Mrs. Cullum will,
however, compete in tomorrow's
meet.
Toni Hewitt, who went to
Mexico City in '68 as a butterflier,

is UCLA's best hope to defeat
Lynn Colella, the University of
Washington swimmer who is
considered the foremost
butterflier in the United States
after her victories last month in
the AAU National Championships
at Cincinatti.
The University of Santa Clara is
led by breaststroker Cathy
Jamison, another veteran of the
'68 Olympics. Miss Jamison and
freestyle sprinter Laura Fritz are
considered Santa Clara's biggest
hopes for an upset victory over
UCLA, according to Margie
Schuer, Student Director of
tomorrow's meet and manager of
the Stanford team.
Miss Schuer is among eight
Stanford swimmers competing
tomorrow. The female Indians
(squaws?) are led by long-time
AAU performer Debbie Led ford,
who will swim the backstroke and
individual medley as well as the
medley and freestyle relays. Team
captain Sheila Zelinger, a
backstroker and individual medley
swimmer, and Jennie Lend I, a
freestyle swimmer, are also
expected to place well.
Carol Kim, Clydia Cyukendall,
Kimberly Patterson and Ginny
Fiske compose the rest of the
Stanford squad.
Preliminaries begin tomorrow
morning at 9:30, with entrants
from Cal State Long Beach, Cal
State LA, Humbolt, San Diego
State, San Fernando Valley State,
Stanford, UCLA, UC * Santa
Barbara, Oregon, Santa Clara,
USC and Washington vying for
places in the finals—which begin
at 3 p.m.

full dress scrimmage as defender Efton Hall (81) is about to leap aboard. The
Indians go through their second and final scrimmage tomorrow afternoon at 2
p.m. without the services of Jim Plunkett who will not play due to bruised ribs
suffered last Saturday. The stadium scrimmage is open to the publie without cost;
it's the last grid action until next fall.
Twelve west coast teams,
featuring some of the nation's
finest women swimmers, converge
on the Stanford Women's Pool
tomorrow for the fifth annual
Stanford Invitational Swim Meet.
The Stanford squad, which won
the first meet five years ago, is not
expected to be a team threat to
such powerhouse teams as UCLA
and Santa Clara University, but
Mrs. Marianna Fowler, meet
director and coach of the
Stanford swimmers, is looking
forward to several fine individual
performances.
"We are not as strong as we
have been in the past,"
commented Mrs. Fowler, "and it
doesn't look like, with all the top
times seeded, that we'll be in the
top five."
Mrs. Fowler was undoubtedly
referring to the rash of Olympic
and AAU stars from UCLA, Santa
Clara, and the University of
Washington, most of whom pose a
threat to meet and national
records in several events.
Leading the UCLA contingent
is two-time Olympic participant
Pokey Watson. Miss Watson swam
in both the 1961 and 1968
Olympics, and is one of the
nation's top backstrokers.
Her Tokyo Olympic teammate,
Cathy Cullum (better known as
Cathy Fergusen) was considered
one of the world's best backstroke
competitors until her marriage
two years ago; Mrs. Cullum will,
however, compete in tomorrow's
meet.
Toni Hewitt, who went to
Mexico City in '68 as a butterflier,

is UCLA's best hope to defeat
Lynn Colella, the University of
Washington swimmer who is
considered the foremost
butterflier in the United States
after her victories last month in
the AAU National Championships
at Cincinatti.
The University of Santa Clara is
led by breaststroker Cathy
Jamison, another veteran of the
'68 Olympics. Miss Jamison and
freestyle sprinter Laura Fritz are
considered Santa Clara's biggest
hopes for an upset victory over
UCLA, according to Margie
Schuer, Student Director of
tomorrow's meet and manager of
the Stanford team.
Miss Schuer is among eight
Stanford swimmers competing
tomorrow. The female Indians
(squaws?) are led by long-time
AAU performer Debbie Led ford,
who will swim the backstroke and
individual medley as well as the
medley and freestyle relays. Team
captain Sheila Zelinger, a
backstroker and individual medley
swimmer, and Jennie Lend I, a
freestyle swimmer, are also
expected to place well.
Carol Kim, Clydia Cyukendall,
Kimberly Patterson and Ginny
Fiske compose the rest of the
Stanford squad.
Preliminaries begin tomorrow
morning at 9:30, with entrants

State LA, Humbolt, San Diego
State, San Fernando Valley State,
Stanford, UCLA, UC * Santa
