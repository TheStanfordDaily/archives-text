### 
In an exclusive Daily interview last night, ex-Council of
Presidents member and future Presidential son-in-law Patrick A.
Shea said that he "plans to teach David a few things" in
upcoming months.
"In keeping with Tricia's father's policy of 'bringing us
together again,' I want to invite Prof. Bruce Franklin and Harvey
Hukari to be my best men.
Shea is not worried about the problems many marriages entail.
"She told me she is on the pill," he said. "My proposal is only
a surgical maneuver, as I plan to be out within 30 days.
"She doesn't have a parrot's beak, but her fishhook, watch
out," he said.
Shea indicated that he was not upset by the advance publicity
in yesterday's Daily. "I didn't keep a low profile. And Tricia was
titilated by the publicity."
Now that he is "part of the solution," how does he plan to
effect change in government policies?
"I intend to work from within," he mused.
