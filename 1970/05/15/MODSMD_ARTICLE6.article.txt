# Considers Recess
## 
### 
The faculty Senate yesterday
voted without dissent to support
"the concept of a recess before
the November elections" and
asked a special committee to
study the possibility of altering
the academic schedule of allowing
for the recess.
'Hie Senate also asked the
committee "to seek out and
discuss additional or alternate
means of involving students in the
political process."
According to several members,
most of the Senate is in favor of
some kind of recess before the
election so students could work
for the political candidates of
their choice. However, they are
worried about the logistics of
rearranging the calendar and the
extra costs involved.
The Princeton faculty has asked
that their academic calendar be
arranged for a two week recess
immediately before the November
election. Their tentative calendar
has been rearranged so that the
two weeks will be made up by
starting classes a week earlier in
the fall than originally planned,
eliminating the Thanksgiving
recess, and holding classes three
days into Christmas vacation.
Some people have said that the

Stanford calendar does not allow
for that much flexibility. The
Christmas vacation starts only a
few days before Christmas and
some are unwilling to delay the
start of that break. According to
Provost Richard Lyman, initial
estimates indicate that the cost
for opening the dorms a week
earlier than now scheduled would
be $50,000 to $60,000.
Hal Mickelson of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, said the
Senate is generally in favor of
allowing and encouraging other
political action. Mickelson also
said that several Senators urged
that arrangements for political
action be made for the entire
quarter.
Others urged that the
University establish the recess
before any election as a policy.
Discussion indicated committee
members would be drawn from
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and the Committee on
Graduate Studies.
President Kenneth Pitzer
expressed support for "the general
teach-out concept and more
particularly the desirability of
student involvement in political
campaigns for the candidates of
their choice."
