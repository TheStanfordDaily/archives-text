## Siegel, Johnson Arrested At Home 
### 
Two former Stanford students,
James E. Johnson, 26, and
Leonard M. Siegel, 21, were
arrested late Wednesday night at
their home in East Palo Alto and
charged with possession of
explosive components and
conspiracy.
After their arraignment
yesterday at the San Mateo Court
house, conspiracy charges were
dropped and bail was set at $1 250
for the remaining charge,
possession of destructive devices.
At 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, five
San Mateo deputies surrounded
the East Palo Alto home shared
by Johnson, Siegel, Neal
Okabayashi and Claire
Christenson. The deputies came
with a warrant for the arrest of
Johnson for assault and battery
on a police officer. Johnson is a
former student in chemical
engineering and currently a
switchboard operator at the
University.
According to Sergeant Tamm
o: the Santa Clara Police
Department, the warrant stems
from an incident at the Old Union
sit-in on April 29 at which
Johnson allegedly kicked a police
officer.
San Mateo police reported that
Johnson called himself "Wilson"
when the police arrived, and thus
provoked a search of the house.
Neal Okabayashi, a Stanford
graduate, said, "The police
over-stepped the limits of their
warrant bv searching for other

things in the house besides
Johnson."
Illegal Search
Okabayashi claimed that the
police entered the house without
permission and searched the house
without permission. "Legally, the
police could only search for
Johnson, but they were looking in
trunks and bookcases; Johnson
isn't that small," he said.
According to Okabayashi, after
an initial hour-long search of the
house, four more policemen
arrived along with Lieutenant
Cardoze of the San Mateo Police
Department. "Two of those guys
had shotguns," added Okabayashi.
Police reported that they found
a pistol registered to Johnson,
about thirty rounds of tracer rifle
ammunition, and a flare launcher
in Johnson's bedroom. In the
garage, police said they found an
electronic device made from a
bundle of home-made rectifiers
constructed from strips of
aluminum beer cans, and wired to
a capacitor and a transformer.
According to Santa Clara Sheriff's
criminologist, Paul Doherty, this
combination could be used as a
timing devoce.
Rifle, Bullets Found
In a basement room below the
living room floor, police found a
M-l rifle with two bandoliers of
100/armoi-piercing and tracer
bullets and a bag of potassium
nitrate powder. At the

arraignment yesterday, no
mention was made of any of the
findings except the flare launcher
and tracer bullets.
Judge Robert E. Carey did not
have sufficient information about
the launcher and the charge of
possession of destructive devices
was confined to the tracer bullets,
apparently the only illegal
possession.
Johnson, Siegel, Okabayashi,
and Christiansen, who is an
employee at the Stanford
Bookstore, were originally
arrested and booked for
possession of explosive
components and conspiracy.
Charges on Okabayashi and the
girl were dropped soon after
because of insufficient evidence.
George Kaplan, assistant
professor of psychology told his
audience at a noon forum on
Defense Department research
yesterday, that both Johnson and
Siegel were innocent and that the
arrests were part of a plan to
"hassel" individuals who have
been active in the Stanford radical
movement. He then collected
money for legal aid funds.
Johnson was out on bond by
6:00 p.m. yesterday. James
Wolpman, the defending attorney
for the case, said that there is a
possibility that Siegel will be out
"on recognizance" without need
of bond or bail today.
Lieutenant Cardoza, who
directed the arrests, was not
available for comment last night.

when the police arrived, and thus
provoked a search of the house.
Neal Okabayashi, a Stanford
graduate, said, "The police
over-stepped the limits of their
warrant bv searching for other

things in the house besides
Johnson."
Illegal Search
Okabayashi claimed that the
police entered the house without
permission and searched the house
without permission. "Legally, the
police could only search for
Johnson, but they were looking in
trunks and bookcases; Johnson
isn't that small," he said.
According to Okabayashi, after
an initial hour-long search of the
house, four more policemen
arrived along with Lieutenant
Cardoze of the San Mateo Police
Department. "Two of those guys
had shotguns," added Okabayashi.
Police reported that they found
a pistol registered to Johnson,
about thirty rounds of tracer rifle
ammunition, and a flare launcher
in Johnson's bedroom. In the
garage, police said they found an
electronic device made from a
bundle of home-made rectifiers
constructed from strips of
aluminum beer cans, and wired to
a capacitor and a transformer.
According to Santa Clara Sheriff's
criminologist, Paul Doherty, this
combination could be used as a
timing devoce.
Rifle, Bullets Found
In a basement room below the
living room floor, police found a
M-l rifle with two bandoliers of
100/armoi-piercing and tracer
bullets and a bag of potassium
nitrate powder. At the

arraignment yesterday, no
mention was made of any of the
findings except the flare launcher
and tracer bullets.
Judge Robert E. Carey did not
have sufficient information about
the launcher and the charge of
possession of destructive devices
was confined to the tracer bullets,
apparently the only illegal
possession.
Johnson, Siegel, Okabayashi,
and Christiansen, who is an
employee at the Stanford
Bookstore, were originally
arrested and booked for
possession of explosive
components and conspiracy.
Charges on Okabayashi and the
girl were dropped soon after
because of insufficient evidence.
George Kaplan, assistant
professor of psychology told his
audience at a noon forum on
Defense Department research
yesterday, that both Johnson and
Siegel were innocent and that the
arrests were part of a plan to
"hassel" individuals who have
been active in the Stanford radical
movement. He then collected
money for legal aid funds.
Johnson was out on bond by
6:00 p.m. yesterday. James
Wolpman, the defending attorney
for the case, said that there is a
possibility that Siegel will be out
"on recognizance" without need
of bond or bail today.
Lieutenant Cardoza, who
directed the arrests, was not
available for comment last night.

Two former Stanford students,
James E. Johnson, 26, and
Leonard M. Siegel, 21, were
arrested late Wednesday night at
their home in East Palo Alto and
charged with possession of
explosive components and
conspiracy.
After their arraignment
yesterday at the San Mateo Court
house, conspiracy charges were
dropped and bail was set at $1 250
for the remaining charge,
possession of destructive devices.
At 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, five
San Mateo deputies surrounded
the East Palo Alto home shared
by Johnson, Siegel, Neal
Okabayashi and Claire
Christenson. The deputies came
with a warrant for the arrest of
Johnson for assault and battery
on a police officer. Johnson is a
former student in chemical
engineering and currently a
switchboard operator at the
University.
According to Sergeant Tamm
o: the Santa Clara Police
Department, the warrant stems
from an incident at the Old Union
sit-in on April 29 at which
Johnson allegedly kicked a police
officer.
San Mateo police reported that
Johnson called himself "Wilson"
when the police arrived, and thus
provoked a search of the house.

graduate, said, "The police
over-stepped the limits of their
