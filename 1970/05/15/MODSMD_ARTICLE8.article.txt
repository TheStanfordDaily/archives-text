# Public Invited Here To Confront Students
## 
### CATHY COOPER PAUL PAPANEK 
A blanket invitation has been
sent out to all to come to the
Stanford campus this Sunday "as
guests into our homes to talk to
us, to address us, to discuss with
us."
"Let the Silent Majority come
to us and tell us what the score
is," urged Jacques Delacroix,
French graduate student in
sociology and proponent of a
snowballing plan to open Stanford
up to the surrounding community
and redirect the momentum of
the student strike.
The "open campus" proposal
was first mentioned by Delacroix
at Tuesday night's mass meeting.
Last night 40 representatives from
organizations ranging from the
Radical Caucus to the engineering
department met to organize
Sunday's open house.
A co-ordinating group working
under the auspices of the Political
Action Coordinating Committee
(PACC) is overseeing the planning
and execution of the day's
activities.
"People have been getting the
idea from talking to me that there
may be 10,000 people on this
campus Sunday," said Delacroix.

"An overestimation, perhaps,"
he admitted. But he was still
confident that a huge crowd
would arrive for an operation that
might conceivably spill over onto
the following week.
Visitors to Stanford will be
directed upon arrival to political
forums, exhibits, and
entertainment aimed at sparking
an exchange of views with
students.
Delacroix outlined two points

on which the invitation is based.
He stressed first that what is
needed in the continuing strike is
a "tactic acceptable to all and a
channel for the common good."
Open Campus
"The open campus is that
tactic," he said.
Second, Delacroix observed
that "the anti-war movement is
tired of being called unpatriotic,
indoctrinated, and undemocratic.
So we are responding to the
challenge by offering the Silent
Majority a platform to speak to
US ' "We can even promise them
that they'll be able to talk to a

real live rock-thrower."
Delacroix called the proposal
"revolutionary," and stressed that
it was not a "teach-in."
"We are not asking the public
to come in and learn; that would

be terrible. The very important
aspect of Open Campus is for
labor, workers, conservatives,
DAR (Dauthters of the American
Revolution), and so forth to
present their views, to let the
students be exposed to their
arguments and beliefs.
Dialogue
"They will be addressing us as
much as we are addressing them.
We must avoid the sanctimonious,
pedantic, superior attitude that is
too often characteristic of us
here," he urged.
Delacroix, who was in Paris
during the 1968 student uprising,
admitted that his optimism has
roots in the success of the French
student's strike.
"In France it started very
small, in no national crisis mood.
It turned when the students
opened the Sorbonne to the
people and they came and kept
coming. The whole student strike
was a trigger, that no one could
have predicted two weeks
before."
Other Activities
Another meeting is slated for
tonight at 7 p.m. in the Serra
lounge.
Other activities on campus
yesterday included an afternoon
rally in White Plaza. About 75
people heard proposals on pickets
at the East Bay Teamsters strike,
urging a picket line to turn back
trucks entering the University
physical plant, and the "Open
Campus" program.
At the ROTC building student
pickets formed a human chain to
continue the blockade.
Twenty demonstrators blocked
the main and rear entrances of the
building, allowing entrance only
to students and staff of the
Athletic Department.
Across the street, ten more
pickets stood in front of the doors
to the armory rifle range.
