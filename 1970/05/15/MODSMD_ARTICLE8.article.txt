# Public Invited Here To Confront Students
## 
### CATHY COOPER PAUL PAPANEK 
A blanket invitation has been
sent out to all to come to the
Stanford campus this Sunday "as
guests into our homes to talk to
us, to address us, to discuss with
us."
"Let the Silent Majority come
to us and tell us what the score
is," urged Jacques Delacroix,
French graduate student in
sociology and proponent of a
snowballing plan to open Stanford
up to the surrounding community
and redirect the momentum of
the student strike.
The "open campus" proposal
was first mentioned by Delacroix
at Tuesday night's mass meeting.
Last night 40 representatives from
organizations ranging from the
Radical Caucus to the engineering
department met to organize
Sunday's open house.
A co-ordinating group working
under the auspices of the Political
Action Coordinating Committee
(PACC) is overseeing the planning
and execution of the day's
activities.
"People have been getting the
idea from talking to me that there
may be 10,000 people on this
campus Sunday," said Delacroix.

"An overestimation, perhaps,"
he admitted. But he was still
confident that a huge crowd
would arrive for an operation that
might conceivably spill over onto
the following week.
Visitors to Stanford will be
directed upon arrival to political
forums, exhibits, and
entertainment aimed at sparking
an exchange of views with
students.
Delacroix outlined two points

on which the invitation is based.
He stressed first that what is
needed in the continuing strike is
a "tactic acceptable to all and a
channel for the common good."
Open Campus
"The open campus is that
tactic," he said.
Second, Delacroix observed
that "the anti-war movement is
tired of being called unpatriotic,
indoctrinated, and undemocratic.
