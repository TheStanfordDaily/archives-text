# Senate Restricts Presidents' Powers
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
The student Senate last night
said the ASSU President may not
share his Constitutional duties
with a Council. The sense of the
Senate resolution was passed to
stop Hal Mickelson from serving
as chairman of the Nominations
Committee, a duty
constitutionally reserved for
President Pat C. Shea.
Last year the Legislature
affirmed that Pat A. Shea was the
sole president. This year's Senate
passed a similar resolution winter
quarter.
The Constitution provides only
for the election of a president and
vice-president, making no
provision for councils to share the
duties. This past year Pat A. Shea
and his council divided duties: for
instance, John Grube, elected as
vice-president served as
nominations committee chairman.
Leo Bazile, chairman of the
Black Students Union, opposed
Mickelson, for what he called
"personal reasons." He claimed
that Mickelson in his capacity as
Nominations Committee chairman
had not dealt honestly with the
BSU during the discussions
preceeding the selection of the
Washington delegation.
Mickelson denied the charge.
Most of the debate avoided that
controversy, sticking to
discussions of whether the Senate,
in its capacity as final arbitor of
Constitutional questions, should

interpret the charter literally or
deal with its spirit.
Moderates and conservatives
supported the council concept,
while most liberals and radicals
voted for strict construction. The
final vote on the resolution was
20-9.
By a large majority the Senate
also supported a resolution
recommending that ROTC either
be a voluntary organization or be
abolished. It urged that the
Presidential Committee on
Student Services, which defines
"voluntary organizations,"
recommend to President Pitzer
that "groups whose primary
function is that of organized
military training . . not be
considered for status as voluntary
organizations.
The Council of Presidents
issued this statement in response
to the Senate action:
Tonight, by attempting to limit
participation by the Council of
Presidents on ASSU Boards and
Commissions, the Senate, largely
composed of supporters of our election
opponents, tried to pull the Council of
Presidents apart.
However, this blatant action has
only made us more firm in assertion
that we were elected as four men of
equal authority. We will not surrender
this authority at the whims of our
opposition. Our effectiveness derives
from our strength as a foursome. To
acquiesce to any less would be a loss of
our integrity.
We are a Council of Presidents,
elected as a council, and we shall serve
as a council if the will of the majority
of students is to be respected.
