# Pitzer Urges Continued Aid

### 
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
urged alumni, parents and other
visitors Saturday "not to play into
the hands of the radicals by
-withholding your help" from the
University.
In remarks which drew a
standing ovation from his
audience of 500 at the 1970
Campus Conference, Pitzer said
(he University now faces "one of
the most serious challenges" in its
history,
"There are among the most
violent demonstrators a small
group that would like to destroy,
neutralize, or politicize this
University and all the great
universities of the nation," he
declared.
"They seek to destroy through
the use of fire and disruption, or
through the erosion of public and
private support. They would like
to neutralize by severing all the
ties with the rest of society that
they find objectionable. They
would like to politicize by forcing
the institution to follow their
bidding in opposing all national
policies.
"Here on campus, we are well
aware of those dangers and are
determined to guard against them.
For your part, and the part of all
alumni of all institutions of higher
education, I urge you not to play
into the hands of the radicals by
withholding your help."
Arrests
Pitzer noted that protests since
April 1 have resulted in more than
100 campus judicial cases (the
largest disciplinary action in
campus history), 45 arrests by
civil authorities, and contempt of
court charges against five
individuals covered by a court
injunction last spring.
"We are anxious to maintain
order on this campus, but we
prefer to do so if at all possible
through the use of our own
mechanisms rather than through
the use of massive external force,"
he declared.
Reviewing events of the past

two months, Pitzer said the
number of Stanford students
engaged in nocturnal "trashing"
of buildings "has been very small
and their activities have outraged
the rest of the university."
"Estimates generally agree that
among the small group of rock
throwers probably less than half
were students. The remainder
were young people who came to
campus apparently to protest war
through their own form of
warfare."
While police were called on
campus 13 times during April and
May to deal with this and other
forms of protest, Pitzer noted
"The revulsion of most moderates
to the extremes of the
militants ... is the best insurance
we have against group violence.
"It is a tribute to the training
and leadership of those police that
we escaped without serious injury
to students, even though the
police were severely provoked and
suffered many injuries from the
rocks that were thrown at them,"
Pitzer said. "We are deeply
grateful for the help that they
gave us."
Broad Response
American operations in
Cambodia evoked a broad
response from students and
faculty, "the overwhelming
majority of whom are also
opposed to the use of violence on
the campus," Pitzer maintained.
"A spontaneous urge arose on
their part to set aside classwork
for a time to discuss the event and
to find ways to take constructive
action against a decision they
regarded as unwise and injurious
to the country."
Pitzer praised the Stanford
delegation to Washington for
"making a major contribution to
communication with our
government" May 6 and 7 and
said he hoped the marked increase
in student interest in regular
political processes is maintained.
Attendance at the conference
totalled about 700, less than half
the normal number.
