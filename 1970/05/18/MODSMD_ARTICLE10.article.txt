# Students In Washington
## Working Within The System 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON For years
ow, our congressmen on Capitol
iU have b«'en urging students to
-york within the system." You
•n imagine their surprise and
•>usternation last week when the
Klents took them up on it.
Congressman Halyard Hoakum
* just putting some balls in his
>ff bag when his secretary came
and snid, "Sir, there's a
legation of students outside
>m your district and they want
i see you."
•Congressman Hoakum said,
For heaven's sakes, it's Friday.
1 n't they know we don't work
pFriday?"
" I told them that, but they still
i ted on seeing you. They said
H l y're from Fairweather State,
ur alma mater."
Running Dog Hoakum
All right, show them in,"
' 'cMhgresiunan Hoakum said, "but
h „ sure and interrupt me in 20
m'jiut"s. You can say the White
House is calling."
The secretary showed 10
udents in.
Congressman Hoakum stuck
'lis hand out, "Well, this is a great
honor ... a great honor. How's
' vorything at Fairweather State?"
A young girl said,
"Congressman Hoakum, we've
c( mo to discuss with you what is
going on in Vietnam."
The Pig Press
Congressman Hoakum said,
"Of rourse you have. Say, let's
p(>se for a photo together." He
buT.zrd his press man. "Jack, you
v r>fi* to bring in the camera and

take some shots of me talking to a
group of fine, dedicated
Americans from Fairweather
State? We could air mail it out
there for Monday morning's
papers. Good."
Jack came in with his camera.
Congressman Hoakum said,
"Now gather around the desk here
and pretend like you have
something really serious to say."
"We do have something serious to
say," a boy said. "Congressman
Hoakum, the students at
Fairweather State are concerned
over the way the President has
been ..." "Say, how's the
football team going to be?" the
congressman asked. "Coach Fogel
told me he might get a bowl
invitation this year."
Right On Rhetoric
A girl pursued the subject, "We
are fed up with rhetoric and
pablum. We want our
representatives in Congress to do
something."
"I know exactly how you
feel," Congressman Hoakum said.
"When I was a student I felt the
same way. I said, "Why can't we
change things?' But since I've
been in public life, I've taken a
more realistic view. But you're
too young to know that, and I
envy your idealism. If I were your
age, I'd be doing the same thing
you're doing."
"How can we change things,
Congressman Hoakum?"
"By working through the
system . . . that's the American
way. Our government with its
checks and balances provides for

everyone to have a voice in this
country. And no one believes in
the right of peaceful dissent more
than I do. You getting all this on
tape, Jack?"
By Any Means Necessary
"Congressman Hoakum," the
girl spokesman said, "you have
been a great help to us and have
shown us what we have to do."
"It's wonderful that we can
still communicate. What are you
going to do?"
"We're going to get all the
students at Fairweather State to
work for your defeat in
November."
Congressman Hoakum shouted,
"You can't do that. I've been in
Congress for 20 years."
"We'll see that it's your last
one."
"Get out, you Commies,"
Hoakum yelled.
"You're all a bunch of rotten
bums."
The students marched out
singing. Hoakum, his head in his
hands, said to his press man,
"Jack, call J. Edgar Hoover and
tell him to find the 5.0.8. who's
trying to get the kids to work
within the system."
