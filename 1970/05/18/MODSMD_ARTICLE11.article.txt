1 lie Madmen
clenched fists
rolling hateful eyeballs,
he decides the power
and the puppets
with maniacal drive,
his friends
are his raving henchmen
and we
are his pledged enemy,
oh yes,
he is afraid
is we clench our fists
iirreturn,
but because he is not
afraid enough,

the underground strengthens,
the youth crash forward,
the senseless makes sense,
the radicals become reasonable,
oh—you "adults"
you talk
talk yourselves into your graves,
your support stagnates
with liars,
the liberals of the government,
and your "experienced" opinions
only lie smothering
in the nation's
stinking garbage pit,
a privileged spot, no doubt.
—Pami Djerassi
Only A State Of Mind
you kid yourselves,
can't you see
the game
you play best
is called optimism.
the rules
are idiotic and Jfmple.
look up!
and you don't
have to see
what you're stepping in.
—Pami Djerassi
Prelude To Power
Echoing silence
Listening thru tears
Shattered and fallen
Echoing silence
Listening thru tears
Shattered and fallen
On white house steps
Yielding forms
Aliena ted
Matched only
By forgotten dreams
Reaching, stumbling
Hesitant at first,
Children of warmonger
Heritage,
Breaking forth
Into awareness
