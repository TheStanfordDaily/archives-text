## Resisting The Draft 
### Stewart Burns 
At the present time, over 50% of the young
men who are ordered to report for induction at
the Oakland Induction Center are failing to show
up to be inducted into the Armed Forces.
More than one tenth of those who do report are
openly refusing to submit to induction, an average
of 15-20 every week. Resistance to the draft in
Northern California is growing in numbers and
gaining momentum all the time, and mass
induction refusal has now become a self-propelling
political force in America.
These resisters, whether unsuccessful CO
applicants, total noncooperators with the draft, or
men who are taking a chance on never being
inducted,are refusing to participate in the brutality
and misery of America's sustained invasion of
Vietnam and Indochina. Approximately one fifth
of all draft resisters are presently being prosecuted
by the government, although the new federal
attorney appointed by Nixon seems to have been
speeding up the indictments slightly in the past
few weeks.
Prison Sentence
The average prison sentence given by the
I leral District Court in San Francisco is two
years, and a good many of the resisters and
nonregistrants are given probation if they are
willing to accept two years of alternate service
work in the "national interest." Some resisters are
being acquitted on the basis of recent Supreme
Court decisions and lower court rulings.
Resisters on the West Coast are sent to'one of
three federal prisons, Lompoc, 100 miles north of
Los Angeles, McNeil Island, off the coast of
Washington, and Safford in Southeastern Arizona.
McNeil Island and Lompoc are medium security
prisons and are harder and more restrictive than
Safford, which is a minimum security honor camp
with considerable freedom for the inmates.
However, prisoners are quickly transferred from
Safford to a medium security prison in Texas if
they cause any trouble or begin to organize.
Young resisters are often sent to Lompoc,
sometimes under the Federal Youth Corrections
Act, and without strength and clarity Lompoc can
be a difficult place to do time. Resisters are almost
always paroled after two thirds of their sentence,
but rarely sooner than this. There are close to 100
draft resisters in these three prisons, and several
hundred in federal prisons throughout the
country.
Draft Resistance
Resisting the draft is a felony, and there are
certain kinds of jobs, particularly those requiring
security clearances, that resisters will not be able
to obtain when they get out of jail. It is very likely
that thev will be able to teach in public schools,
colleges and universities, but it seems doubtful
that resisters would be able to become doctors,
lawyers, or government officials. In some states
like California resisters would probably be able to

vote and have driver's licenses.
As more and more people in America come to
realize the insanity and immorality of the war in
Southeast Asia, and as history proves the moral
and political necessity to resist American
militarism, it appears inevitable that our society
will eventually come to honor and respect the
young men who took this action and suffered the
consequences, and these unjust restrictions will
disappear.
It is clear that the men who are in prison for
refusing induction into the Army and refusing to
register for the draft are political prisoners in a
criminal society. They are engaged in a common
revolutionary struggle with Huey Newton, Bobby
Seale, the rest of the political prisoners who have
come out of the ghetto, and the prisoners within
the military.
Legal Terrorism
As is characteristic of all political prisoners in
America, the well known draft resisters are given
long sentences as a technique of scaring those who
might follow, and the government uses the legal
system as a way of getting rid of the most active
political organizers. Because his case was widely
publicized, Eric Whitehorn was given a four year
sentence at Lompoc for non-registration, and he
was quickly released when the pressure became
unbearable and he decided to register.
Draft resister Paul Rupert was forced to leave
Santa Clara County when his liberal judge realized
that Rupert's abilities as an organizer might enable
him to succeed in getting the people and
institutions of Santa Clara County out of the war
in Southeast Asia. The administration of Stanford
University was particularly uptight about Rupert's
efforts to confront Stanford's irresponsible land
use policies, and the administrators used their
influence to persuade the judge to exile this threat
to their power and hegemony. The Selective
Service Law has been used many times in the last
few years by the government to stifle dissent and
to destroy effective political organizing for radical
change in America.
Draft resisters are openly resisting the
devastating power of the American state; they are
refusing to participate in the largest and most
powerful military force in the history of the
world. If this movement of resistance builds
momentum and gains strength all around the
country as it has already done in California, this
might be the most effective way to halt America's
economic and military domination of Southeast
Asia, Latin America, and Africa.
This collective action can only be meaningful if
it is part of a long term process of radical social
change. It is a first step toward transforming the
conditions of the common oppression that we
share with the people of our ghettos and of the
Third World.
