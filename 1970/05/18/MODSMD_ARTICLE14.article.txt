# Government Racism?
## Population Control And Genocide 
### Paul Anne Ehrlich 
Because the sensitive issue of
racism has been raised in
connection with our work on
population problems here, I want
to present our view of the matter.
The accompanying statement,
originally prepared earlier this
spring, covers the subject in a
general way; it has been
submit ted, at their request, to the
newsletter of the New Democratic
Coalition. To it I would add the
following clarifications about the
work we are (or are not) doing
related to the population
problem.
1.) No research on
contraceptives of any kind is or
has been carried on in the
D ep art ment of liiological
Sciences.
2.) No one at Stanford
University is involved in research
on sterilants for use in water
supplies or staple foods. Indeed,
to the best of my knowledge, no
such research is presently being
carried out on this subject
anywhere in the United States.
3.) We are conducting
experiments on the responses of

people in group situations to
different levels of crowding, on
the attitudes of undergraduates
and others to population issues,
and on the dynamics, ecology,
and genetics of natural
populations of various lower
animals. We welcome the interest
of those who would like to talk
with us about this work and its
implications.

Many Americans believe that
the growth of the U.S. population
is mainly due to excessive
reproduction among the poor. In
fact, more than two-thirds of the
babies born each year belong to
the wealthy and the middle class.
The average American still does
not realize that any couple with
more than two children is
contributing to the population
explosion.
Because of their impact on the
environment, population growth
among the affluent in the U.S.
and their counterparts in Europe,
the Soviet Union, and Japan is the
most serious in the world, even
though it is not the most rapid.
These people are the main
consumers of our planet's
non-renewable resources and
polluters of its environment; their
activities threaten to destroy the
Earth's life-support systems. In
terms of degradation of the
environment, the birth of each
American child is 50 times the
disaster for the world as the birth
of a child in India. In terms of the
consumption of non-renewable
resources, an American baby is
some 300 times as dangerous to
our future well-being as an
Indonesian baby.
U.S. Poor People
Similarly, poor people in the
U.S. have far less power to loot
and pollute than does the average
American. Therefore, they have
much less impact upon the
environment, despite their slightly
higher birthrates. In general their
higher birthrates are more of a
liability to themselves than to the
public. Statistically, large families
tend to be poor; moreover they
are more likely to remain poor.
Smaller families have been shown
to have a greater chance of
escaping poverty.
The public, including
non-white minorities themselves,
tends to equate "poor" with
Blacks, Chicanos, and American
Indians, because higher
proportions of these groups are in
low-income groups. Nevertheless,
the majority of the poor are
white, and the majority of
non-white people are not poor.
For instance, only about 30
percent of black families were
classified as poor in 1967.

In view of the tendency of
affluent Americans to blame U.S.
population growth on the poor, it
is unfortunate that the Nixon
administration has chosen to label
the government's new policy of
extending family planning services
to the poor as "population
control." First of all, this served
to reinforce the erroneous beliefs
of much of the public about the
source of American population
growth. More importantly, it
aroused considerable resentment
among minorities, especially
among black leaders, who often
see such policies as a form of
genocide aimed at Blacks.
This point of view is not
entirely unjustified, thanks to the
attitudes of some population
control advocates, who seem
mainly interested in controlling
other people's populations, and
thanks to some abuses in existing
birth control programs for the
poor.
Minorities
Since minorities have had little
to do with generating our
environmental deterioration, the
most obvious symptom of
overpopulation in the U.S., their
leaders can hardly be blamed for a
lack of enthusiasm for birth
control programs. Nevertheless, it
is interesting that minorities are
disproportionately victims of
environmental deterioration. Poor
Blacks are confined to the cores
of cities where air pollution is
heaviest and urban decay and
overcrowding are worst. Black
Americans, for unknown reasons,
have significantly higher average
levels of DDT in their tissues than
are found in the general
population. Chicanos may be
spared the evils of modern urban
life, but they suffer directly from
polluting agricultural practices,
especially the misuse of pesticides.
Reproductive rates in the U.S.,
as elsewhere, are strongly
correlated with such factors as
income and educational levels.
This is true for Blacks and other
minorities as well as whites.
Affluent black couples, for
instance, have on the average
slightly fewer children than do
comparable white couples. When
black Americans are given the
same economic, educational, and
social opportunities as white
Americans have, black birthrates
will almost certainly be
indistinguishable from white.
Subsidized Abortions
Contraception and subsidized
abortions should be available to
all Americans, white, black, or
brown, married, or unmarried. No
one should be subjected to
compulsory pregnancy.
Government support of these

programs through national health
and welfare services is necessary
and long overdue. But these
programs are not, and should not
be considered, population control
programs. Rather, they are a
logical extension ol family
planning, which has been part of
the American social scene for
more than two generations.
Population control, on the other
hand, is the conscious control of
population size and rate of change
by a society. This requires the
determination of an optimum
population size for the society,
and the institution of measures
designed to move the society
toward that goal.
Since the effects of population
growth among affluent white
Americans are the most serious, it

might be hoped that any
governmental population control
program will be designed first to
reduce the birth rates of that
group. American minorities can
hardly be expected to look with
favor on any programs to control
their birth rates imposed by a
white government that has barely
begun to give them their
constitutionally guaranteed
rights. When they have those
rights, their reproductive
responsibilities to society will be
the same as those of any other
group. Meanwhile, it is up to the
rest of us to start exercising our
own responsibilities.
