# A 						Case History
## DOD's Neutrality 
### R.N. Bracewell 
Each day the Radio Astronomy Institute issues a temperature map
of the sun and, as one of the principal uses is for prediction of
interplanetary weather conditions, this Stanford activity has made the
news from time to time. Readers may recall mentions in the press at
the time of the Apollo 11 flight. Other uses for the daily sun map
remain to be established and we get requests for cooperation at the
time of eclipse expeditions when astronomers wish to compare
observations and on occasions when scientists, both in the U.S. and
abroad, succeed in rocketing X-ray or ultraviolet telescopes high
enough into the air to see the sun.
There are conceivable military applications for sun maps (for
example in the fields of navigation and antenna practice) just as there
are military uses for terrestrial weather maps. There is also a
conceivable application in connection with satellite drag forces which
are controlled by solar influences on the upper atmosphere. However,
the main reason for working on the subject is to get a better
understanding of the sun's atmosphere. The field is a good one for
training students in scientific methods.
Now the day to day costs of operation have been met by a contract
with the Environmental Science Services Administration in Boulder,
which was formed by amalgamating a number of agencies concerned
with the environment, such as the old Weather Bureau and the old
Central Radio Propagation Laboratory. This seemed to be a most
appropriate agency. At one time the National Science Foundation had
helped, but NSF felt that the day-to-day repetitive aspect was more in
keeping with the spirit of ESSA.
The trouble with ESSA has been its newness, and its slowness to
develop smooth working relationships with universities. After all, their
principal activities are carried out by themselves. The way in which
the imperfection of the relationship shows up is in an annual tendency
to notify Stanford by telegram on the last day that the contract will
not be renewed. We have patched up such breaks twice but it causes
great anguish to the two staff members whose livelihood is involved.
The end of this story is of interest as regards Department of
Defense funding. Early in 1970 a telephone call came saying that
ESSA could not keep its contract and would have only half the
promised funds for the last quarter. Furthermore, no renewal was in
sight. The two observers, who have been with Stanford an average of 6
years, were immediately given notice that their jobs would terminate
in six weeks.
The Department of Defense was asked for and gave help, so that
for the time being we remain in operation, and perhaps, when
budgetary affairs permit, ESSA will resume support. NSF was
contacted; their problem now is that they are inundated with
proposals from people who have been dumped by DOD and they are
only too happy to see some of the load shouldered by DOD in this
case.
How does the Mansfield amendment affect things? Although it has
been voted out after one year, it has provoked the application by
DOD of strict guidelines to new contracts. Thus, although our
interests here are mainly in solar physics, nevertheless DOD will now
insist that the basis for support is in accord with some military
mission. The clear application of calibration of antennas will afford
their basis in our case.
This case history, which is taken from the School of Engineering,
can undoubtedly be paralleled by others from such Departments as
Communications, Political Science, Psychology, Slavic Languages,
Sociology, which are not normally thought to have any more
connection with the military than does solar physics. Still, it would be
interesting to have some details from other departments in support of
the statements now being voiced regarding the neutral role of DOD
funding for university research.
We need some correct facts to counteract misstatements that can
be heard over the microphone in White Plaza. Then we could dispense
with conversations such as this one that I took part in last Thursday
when my office was blockaded: Q. "Why are you doing weapons
research in the Durand Building?" A. "We're not." Q. "Well, if you're
not, how come the Department of Defense paid for the building?" A.
"It didn't." (NASA did mostly.)
