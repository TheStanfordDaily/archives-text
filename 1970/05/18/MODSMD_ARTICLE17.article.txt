Editor, THE DAILY:
The communications gap in the
halls and offices (not to mention
the restrooms) of Encina Hall will
remain unbridgable as long as
all-wise freshmen exercise literary
v ~ense in categorizing staff as
either elderly secretaries or
25-year-old gum chewers from
high school. Is it really sound
psychology to expect
"appreciation" or "approval"
when civil rights are usurped? The
staff had no vote in the so-called
> rike. The decision was made for
us and enforced not so
non-violently. How is this
different in principle from
Nixon's unilateral decision to go
into Cambodia without a vote by
our represenatives in Congress?
Both are abridgments of
'■onstitutional guarantees.
There were two very distinct
factions surrounding Encina. The
radicals, who were interested only
in monologue—their's, and the
impressive, dedicated, and
idealistic students truly concerned
about the war and interested in
* <i aring what we had to say. These
are the beautiful young people in
whom we place our hope for a
better world, and they are the
ones whose education we support
and service often beyond a mere
pay check. That's why so many of
us, who also oppose the
invasion and support
getting out of Vietnam, crawled
through windows and over broken
glass to keep the University gt)ing,
despite the appalling efforts of the
radicals to destroy it.
Incidentally, it might be
worthwhile to visualize the
impus as Vietnam with the
radicals (Viet Cong?) completely
familiar with the terrain and
indistinguishable in appearance
from the other students
(Vietnamese?) attacking the easily
identified police (U.S. Army?)
then disappearing into the
"mctuary of dorms (Cambodia?).
A wise (elderly) man once said:
"I wish I knew as much now as I
THOUGHT I knew as a freshman
in college."

v aculty Wives
Editor, THE DAILY:
I appeal to all Stanford faculty
wives to shake off apathy and to
actively commit themselves to the
present crisis.
Having devoted the morning to
political telephone calls, I am
appalled by faculty wives' voices
describing themselves as a political
or not yet committed.
What do we want for our
country? Militarism equal to
Japan in 1940? Genocidal
tendencies until we have killed six
million Asians?
June 2nd is very close at hand.
When do we decide for whom to
vote? And why? Now or at the
polls? Do we choose a candidate
who has been consistently against
the war since 1964 and said so on
the floor of Congress or one
whose voice remained silent? Do
/e choose a candidate who has
consistently voted for funds for
the Vietnam war or one who has
just as consistently voted since
1965 against funds for the war?
Do we choose a candidate for his
charisma or for his character? Do
w choose the candidate who can
ouy his way into office or the one
who can call his soul his own?
Or do we remain a-political,
uncommitted, and therefore
charter members of the silent
majority?

lixam Notice
Final Examinations: Published
regulations governing final
examinations are suspended for
this quarter. Individual
departments are urged to establish
any guidelines which they
.consider appropriate in order to
maintain equity and to minimize
conflicts within their
departments, but ultimately
individual instructors must decide
the best way to evaluate the
accomplishments of students
under the conditions which have
existed for the latter part of this
quarter. If a final examination is
given, particularly in a large class,
it should be given at the scheduled
time in order to minimize
conflicts both in students' time
and in the use of facilities. If
take-home finals or additional
papers are to be used, they should
be announced as soon as possible
so that students do not have

pressures from several new
directions at the same time. But
instructors are encouraged to
make whatever arrangements fit
their situations.
Use of Classrooms: It is
important in order to maintain
flexibility and get maximum use
out of facilities to coordinate
requests for meeting space during
daytime hours through the Room
Scheduling Office (ext. 2045).
Most importantly, please let us
know about space for which you
are scheduled that you do not
plan to use; only if you do this
can we allocate the space to
others.

Faculty Trashing?
Editor, The Daily:
In order to be consistent, any
member of the Faculty Senate
who votes to keep ROTC on
campus should be prepared to
pick up rocks and join the people
throwing rocks, so that he can
exert his humanizing influence.

'Young Hoodlums'
Dear Dr. Pitzer:
I, like a majority of the
Stanford University, Palo Alto,
California and United States
community have had enough. We
have had enough of putting up
with spoiled, theoretical, children
who have no sense of history. We
have had enough of their
destruction, their ignorance, and
their obnoxious, violent behavior.
We have had enough of young
hoodlums who believe that they
can get anything they want—if
they yell loud enough or break
enough windows.
You, and men like you, are
really doing this small obnoxious
group of young people a
disservice. You have led them into
believing that somehow there is a
"free lunch." Indeed, how
disillusioned they will be when
they realize that all actions have
costs —and that sooner or later
they will have to pay up.
Let me make clear that my
remarks do not for a moment put
in jeopardy the civil rights: to
protest, to speak freely, or to
share in academic freedom. But
they do suggest that men in your
position must take the initiative
to say "stop—enough." To do so
effectively you must not make
martyrs of these middle class
neorevolutionaries by being heavy
handed. You must constantly
show that they are the "bad guys"
who are preempting our
freedoms —in the name of saving
us.
Act now. Act firmly, yet
subtly. If you can't outflank these
children, you don't deserve your
job.

One Man's Testimony
Editor, The Daily:
Once upon a time there was a
great sickness in the land, and
many were dying.
And some, who saw more
clearly than the rest, perhaps
because their eyes had not yet
been affected by the sickness (for
many of them were younger),
said, "There is evil in the land,
and it is the cause of this
sickness." And they saw that
certain institutions had come to
embody the evil and harbor it
within themselves, and these
institutions used men to oppress
other men, .by forcing their will
on them, and the men died.
And these seers said, "We must
destroy these institutions in order
to save men." And they organized
into groups, like armies, and went
out to destroy the evil institutions
which made men unfree.
And when they got there, they
found that inside the institutions
there were other men, afraid, just
like themselves. For that was what
the sickness was, being afraid.
At this point a man in the
group said, "Perhaps if we destroy
these men we will prevent future
destruction by others." But soon
he saw that this was just what
armies had always said throughout
history, and that they were no
different, and that armies had
always caused suffering and death.
So the crowd remained, still.
And then one man in the
group, who was no less afraid than
any of the others, but he had
forgotten to be afraid because he
was stoned, or something, went

across the line and touched a man
inside, and smiled, and laughed.
And at that place there was a
piece of sunshine.
And they asked the man how
he did it, and he looked them in
the eyes, and spread his arms, and
said, "I looked inside, and saw it
was the same as it is out here."

Tuition Refund?
Editor, The Daily:
The professors' and teachers:
political beliefs were not a
prerequisite when hired by the
University. They have an
obligation to the University and

the STUDENTS to conduct class
whenever they are scheduled. If
they want to practice their
politics they should do it on their
own time and not penalize the
students who are trying to acquire
an education.
The political beliefs of teachers
should not be the determining
factor whether or not a class is
held. Those whose conscience will
not let them teach because of our
government's foreign policy
should resign and those who don't
have the courage to resign should
be dismissed by the
administration.
Furthermore, is there going to
be a refund of tuition to the

students who have paid for value
not received?

Lncina Complaint
Editor, The Daily:
As an Encina Hall employee
and striker, I would like to
express my sadness at the
communications gap between
students and employees. It is
caused only in part by the
tendency of some to see all
students as part of a great
mindless, power-drunk mob
whose political consciousness
waxes and wanes with the
amusement potential of a
particular tactic. The gap is also
caused by people like Leslie
Campbell who bases her

impressions of workers on the
slight acquaintance of 7 out of
400 employees which is not even
a respectable cross section.
Many, many of the people who
work here are every bit as
intelligent, aware and active as
many of the students and faculty.
So put away your preconceived
notions and let's close the gap!
I would also like to mention
that although my decision to join
the strike made it impossible for
my colleagues to work in shifts
rather than continuously, they
each one affirmed my right to
express myself politically. Save
me from the Rads who want to
liberate me!
