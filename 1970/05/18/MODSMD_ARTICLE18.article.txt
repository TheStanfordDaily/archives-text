# Looking Backward
## The 						New Puritans 
### Don Ayer 
It has been said that there is
nothing new under the sun. Our
world is but a combination of the
elements of yesterday, and so was
yesterday a simple regrouping of
the world which preceded it. Our
ideas, so the argument runs, are
only a rehash of a few basic
concepts which have been
bantered about since man was
first able to think. A few of the
words may be new, but the
patterns and the substance are as
old as time.
Such a proposition as this is
clearly open to doubt, and it
would be absurd to try to prove it
in a newspaper column. Modern
psychology, in fact, with its
emphasis on the primary nature of
personal experience, seems to
indicate that it is not valid; as
perception varies from one person
to another, so new worlds are
born with every new child.
And yet it is hard to avoid
seeing striking parallels in pattern,
in argument, even in style, among
diverse elements throughout the
course of history. Some such
parallels are so striking as to give
pause in dismissing the
proposition outlined above.
Radical Puritans
Such a pattern of similarities
exists between the Stanford
Radicals of 1970 and the
Plymouth Rock Puritans of 1620.
TTiree hundred and fifty years
have not prevented anyone from
getting it together in terms of
fanatical elitism and submersion
in their own rhetoric.
To begin with, both groups see
themselves as tools in the
salvation of mankind. For the
Puritans it was a heavenly
salvation, for the radicals it
constitutes the destruction of
worldly evil. But in either case the
key presumption is that one's own
actions will make or break the
salvation scene.
Both, therefore, are elitist.
They see themselves, respectively,
as the Elite and the Enlightened.
They, alone, possess the
understanding of the Big Picture,
and, of course, this puts them in a
position of special trust. The
burden is a heavy one which is

borne at once joyfully and with a
spirit of inner determination and
rigidity. As with Puritans who
won't hear of any other life style,
so with radicals who won't
negotiate: The demands of
salvation, be it earthly or heavily,
are necessarily non-negotiable.
Inner-directed
Both are fiendishly
inner-directed. Around them they
see the enticements and illusions
of daily life set up, trap-like, to
lead them down the prime-rose
path of false consciousness. There
can be no compromise or even
discourse with Satan, and there
most clearly can be none with his
henchmen who are all around us;
they are all the more insidious,
deceitful and dangerous for their
lack of horns and a tail.
There is in both cases an
overwhelming concern with one's
personal destiny, and an obsessive
need to prove one's identity with
the cause by some sort of personal
witness. For the Puritans this
meant ascetism and self-denial, on
the theory that to live as God's
elect is a reasonable indication
that one is, in fact, a member of
that elect.
For the radical this means
taking extreme action of some
kind to prove and cement one's
identity with the Movement. That
rock-throwing and "pig"-baiting
seem actually to be detrimental to
the avowed aims has not proved a
major obstacle. From this fact it
can be existentially argued that
the primary function of the
Movement, as with Puritanism, is
one of self-validation rather than
the achievement of any political
goal.
Xenophobic Attitude
There is, for both, the implicit
fear of contamination by
association. As the Puritans set up
separate communities and
expelled all foreign elements, so
the radicals seek to expel ROTC
as a threat to the purity of their
immediate world. Few, when
confronted, will say that an army
is unnecessary, and the argument
that ending ROTC will end the

army is ridiculous anyway. They
simply say that the military
system has no place here. As one
has so aptly put it, they "find
repugnant the presence of little
soldiers marching around
campus."
Along this same line, there is
the supreme intolerance for which
both groups have gained a
reputation while, at the same
time, giving great lip-service to
human conscience. As the
Puritans burned witches and
expelled Roger Williams, after
emigrating for their own religious
freedom, so the radicals grab the
microphone from anyone who
tries to speak against them, while
screaming of political repression.
When one's identity hangs on a
certain set of thoroughly
questionable beliefs, it will not do
to let them be seriously
challenged within one's own
earshot.
This list could be carried on a
good deal longer, but the point
has been adequately made.
Utterly Powerless
Radicals today, whatever their
avowed goals, are living in a
framework of culture and history
which they are utterly powerless
to escape. In their efforts to
transcend this frame they flail
away in a paranoid style which
only serves to underline their
affinity to their Puritan ancestors,
among others. The cries for a
revolution in the substance of life
are absurd when juxtaposed with
the utterly unrevolutionary
manner in which that cry is sent
out. The radical, in short, is the
Don Quixote of our age.
In fairness to the Puritans one
point of dissimilarity should be
placed along side this list of
parallels. Where the Puritan knew
his beliefs to come from a
supernatural, eternal being, the
radical has no parallel
understanding of the source of his
calling. His movement rather
bubbles up from his guts, and he
simply Does It in a most irrational
and spontaneous manner. His
moral hierarchy is in no way

rationalized, except, for some, by
consultation with the works of
Chairman Mao. He is his own
justification; it is no wonder that
he is frustrated.
