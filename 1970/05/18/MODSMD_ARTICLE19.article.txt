# CRITICS' CHOICE
## Beatles' Film A Disappointment 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
If you've ever listened to a
band rehearse for two hours, you
know how boring it can be, even
if the musicians are Paul, John,
George, and Kingo. Someone
thought he could make money be
filming the Beatles doing what
they always do before they make
an album. Undoubtedly, people
will pay to see the film,
appropriately entitled "Let It
Be," but unfortunately they will
probably be disappointed.
The photography is
uninteresting and dull, the sound
is terrible and even the performers
seem bored. The camera was
nothing more than an intrusion
that hampered the Beatles style
and made them extremely nervous
- the very reason they give for not
appearing in public anymore.
Paul McCartney came across as
a flaming egotist, telling everyone
else what to do and trying so hard
to relate to the audience he knew
was on the other side of the
camera. George Harrison was so
engrossed in his guitar that he
completely ignored what was
going on in the studio. The first
time he came to life was to put
down McCartney for playing
group leader.
Richie Starkley sat on his
platform with his head in the
clouds, oblivious to the beat he
was supposed to keep. However,
he did have a few comic moments
in the old "Hard Days Night"
tradition. Lennon sang and played
guitar with Yoko constantly glued
to his elbow.
The film and the Beatles finally
came to life when they played a
few songs from their new album
on the roof of their Apple office
in downtown London. Comments
from the people on the street
below, when you could
urderstand them, were quite
amusing. The bobbies put on a
good show when they registered a
complaint from the neighboring
offices that the noise was too
loud.
John Lennon concluded their
roof top engagement by saying,
"I'd like to thank you on behalf
of the group. I hope we passed the
audition." Judging from previous
performances, I doubt it.

This week offers an

opportunity to set* two excellent
variations on the themes of fear
and cruelty: Roman Polanski's
" Cul-de-Sac" and Volker
Schlondorff's "Young Torless."
In the meantime, Clive Miller's
Freshman Film Series will present
"My Darling Clementine" aL 7:45
and "Deception" at 10 this
Tuesday in Geology 320.
Director John Ford based his
19<1G Western "My Darling

Clementine" on the Battle of the
O.K. Corral between Wyutt Earp
and the Clanton Gang. Henry
Fonda was Wyatt Earp is the
epitome of restraint as he portrays
the chivalrous lawman on
horseback.
Bette Davis stars as Christine
Radcliffe in Irving Rapper's
"Deception." Karel Novak (Paul
Henreid), a musical genius, returns

from WWII to the arms of
Christine only to learn that
composer-conductor Alexander
Hollius (Claude Rains) has been
keeping her in style while he's
been gone.
In an effort to prove that there
is really nothing between herself
and Alexander, Christine asks
Karel to be her husband.
"Jealousy and fear grip the

characters as irrationality controls
their actions," and as a result, a
small misunderstanding results in
Alexander's death.
Polanski's Favorite
Wednesday, at 7, 9, and 11 and
Cubberley, Beta Chi will .show
Roman Polanski's "Cul-de-Sac. A
gangster and his dying accomplice
on the run forms the basis for this
study of those perversions and
proclivities of the human soul that
emerge under pressure. Pinter and
Beckett were obviously influential
in Polanski's creation of the two
Theater-of the-Absurd characters.
Speaking in his normally
pretentious manner, Polanski,
director of "Knife in the Water,"
and "Repulsion," and
"Rosemary's B;iby," said: "The
film stands exactly as I wanted it
to and it's an addition to the
poetic language of the cinema. It
is my best film. 1 nlways loved it. I
always believed in it. It is real
cinema, done for cinema-like art
for art. It's well in advance of
anything that has been done in
the semantics of cinema. It was
written without any story. It was
what I like to see in the cinema. It
was the utmost fears in the
characters that I care about.
Characters and utmost fear are the
most important thing in cinema."
When asked about the criticism
"Cul-de-Sac" received for being
bizzare and excessively cruel,
Polanski replied: "Yes, I recall the
lady critic who used words like
' necrophilia, homosexuality,
sadism.' That is her problem, not
mine. I am not obsessed by these
things. It was just a film."
Final Kinetic Program
Also on Wednesday, the final
program of the Kinetic Art Series
will be shown at 7:30 and 9:30 in
Geology 320. Included on the
program of short creative films are
Stan Vanderbeek's computer
made film "Poen Field Number
One," Pascal Aubier's "Arthur,
Arthur" which explores the
further reaches of unreality in a
one-dimensional world- "as potent
as any drug," Jordan Belson's
"Momentum" which uses new
techniques of television-generated
color, and"The Chair," an
animated film by George
Dunning, one of the directors of
"Yellow Submarine."
Thursday evening, the
International Association will
present award winning "Young
Torless," the first film by German
director Volker Schloendorff, at
7:45 in Cubberley. Set in a
German boy's boarding school,
the film examines the latent
sadism and confused sexuality
that are the result of a repressive
educational system.
Schlondorff's film could be
seen as a parable about Nazism
and guilt by association, but its
goes beyond that level in its
sensitive and revealing
characterizations of the young
boys grounded from birth in the
idea that life is a power game,
worth nothing unless it is won.

BEATLK FILMâ€”John, George, Paul, and Ringo rehearse the songs for their latest album, "Let It Be" in an unrevealing antl
disappointing documentary film appropriately entitled "Let It Be," currently showing at the Stanford Theater in Palo
/VI to.
If you've ever listened to a
band rehearse for two hours, you
know how boring it can be, even
if the musicians are Paul, John,
George, and Kingo. Someone
thought he could make money be
filming the Beatles doing what
they always do before they make
an album. Undoubtedly, people
will pay to see the film,
appropriately entitled "Let It
Be," but unfortunately they will
probably be disappointed.
The photography is
uninteresting and dull, the sound
is terrible and even the performers
seem bored. The camera was
nothing more than an intrusion
that hampered the Beatles style
and made them extremely nervous
- the very reason they give for not
appearing in public anymore.
Paul McCartney came across as
a flaming egotist, telling everyone
else what to do and trying so hard
to relate to the audience he knew
was on the other side of the
camera. George Harrison was so
engrossed in his guitar that he
completely ignored what was
going on in the studio. The first
time he came to life was to put
down McCartney for playing
group leader.
Richie Starkley sat on his
platform with his head in the
clouds, oblivious to the beat he
was supposed to keep. However,
he did have a few comic moments
in the old "Hard Days Night"
tradition. Lennon sang and played
guitar with Yoko constantly glued
to his elbow.
The film and the Beatles finally
came to life when they played a
few songs from their new album
on the roof of their Apple office
in downtown London. Comments
from the people on the street
below, when you could
urderstand them, were quite
amusing. The bobbies put on a
good show when they registered a
complaint from the neighboring
offices that the noise was too
loud.
John Lennon concluded their
roof top engagement by saying,
"I'd like to thank you on behalf
of the group. I hope we passed the
audition." Judging from previous
performances, I doubt it.

This week offers an

opportunity to set* two excellent
variations on the themes of fear
and cruelty: Roman Polanski's
" Cul-de-Sac" and Volker
Schlondorff's "Young Torless."
In the meantime, Clive Miller's
Freshman Film Series will present
"My Darling Clementine" aL 7:45
and "Deception" at 10 this
Tuesday in Geology 320.
Director John Ford based his
19<1G Western "My Darling

Clementine" on the Battle of the
O.K. Corral between Wyutt Earp
and the Clanton Gang. Henry
Fonda was Wyatt Earp is the
epitome of restraint as he portrays
the chivalrous lawman on
horseback.
Bette Davis stars as Christine
Radcliffe in Irving Rapper's
"Deception." Karel Novak (Paul
Henreid), a musical genius, returns

from WWII to the arms of
Christine only to learn that
composer-conductor Alexander
Hollius (Claude Rains) has been
keeping her in style while he's
been gone.
In an effort to prove that there
is really nothing between herself
and Alexander, Christine asks
Karel to be her husband.
"Jealousy and fear grip the

characters as irrationality controls
their actions," and as a result, a
small misunderstanding results in
Alexander's death.
Polanski's Favorite
Wednesday, at 7, 9, and 11 and
Cubberley, Beta Chi will .show
Roman Polanski's "Cul-de-Sac. A
gangster and his dying accomplice
on the run forms the basis for this
study of those perversions and
proclivities of the human soul that
emerge under pressure. Pinter and
Beckett were obviously influential
in Polanski's creation of the two
Theater-of the-Absurd characters.
Speaking in his normally
pretentious manner, Polanski,
director of "Knife in the Water,"
and "Repulsion," and
"Rosemary's B;iby," said: "The
film stands exactly as I wanted it
to and it's an addition to the
poetic language of the cinema. It
is my best film. 1 nlways loved it. I
always believed in it. It is real
cinema, done for cinema-like art
for art. It's well in advance of
anything that has been done in
the semantics of cinema. It was
written without any story. It was
what I like to see in the cinema. It
was the utmost fears in the
characters that I care about.
Characters and utmost fear are the
most important thing in cinema."
When asked about the criticism
"Cul-de-Sac" received for being
bizzare and excessively cruel,
Polanski replied: "Yes, I recall the
lady critic who used words like
' necrophilia, homosexuality,
sadism.' That is her problem, not
mine. I am not obsessed by these
things. It was just a film."
Final Kinetic Program
Also on Wednesday, the final
program of the Kinetic Art Series
will be shown at 7:30 and 9:30 in
Geology 320. Included on the
program of short creative films are
Stan Vanderbeek's computer
made film "Poen Field Number
One," Pascal Aubier's "Arthur,
Arthur" which explores the
further reaches of unreality in a
one-dimensional world- "as potent
as any drug," Jordan Belson's
"Momentum" which uses new
techniques of television-generated
color, and"The Chair," an
animated film by George
Dunning, one of the directors of
"Yellow Submarine."
Thursday evening, the
International Association will
present award winning "Young
Torless," the first film by German
director Volker Schloendorff, at
7:45 in Cubberley. Set in a
German boy's boarding school,
the film examines the latent
sadism and confused sexuality
that are the result of a repressive
educational system.
Schlondorff's film could be
seen as a parable about Nazism
and guilt by association, but its
goes beyond that level in its
sensitive and revealing
characterizations of the young
boys grounded from birth in the
idea that life is a power game,
worth nothing unless it is won.

that are the result of a repressive
educational system.
Schlondorff's film could be

BEATLK FILMâ€”John, George, Paul, and Ringo rehearse the songs for their latest album, "Let It Be" in an unrevealing antl
disappointing documentary film appropriately entitled "Let It Be," currently showing at the Stanford Theater in Palo
/VI to.
If you've ever listened to a
band rehearse for two hours, you
know how boring it can be, even
if the musicians are Paul, John,
George, and Kingo. Someone
thought he could make money be
filming the Beatles doing what
they always do before they make
an album. Undoubtedly, people
will pay to see the film,
appropriately entitled "Let It
Be," but unfortunately they will
probably be disappointed.
The photography is
uninteresting and dull, the sound
is terrible and even the performers
seem bored. The camera was
nothing more than an intrusion
that hampered the Beatles style
and made them extremely nervous
- the very reason they give for not
appearing in public anymore.
Paul McCartney came across as
a flaming egotist, telling everyone
else what to do and trying so hard
to relate to the audience he knew
was on the other side of the
camera. George Harrison was so
engrossed in his guitar that he
completely ignored what was
going on in the studio. The first
time he came to life was to put
down McCartney for playing
group leader.
Richie Starkley sat on his
platform with his head in the
clouds, oblivious to the beat he
was supposed to keep. However,
he did have a few comic moments
in the old "Hard Days Night"
tradition. Lennon sang and played
guitar with Yoko constantly glued
to his elbow.
The film and the Beatles finally
came to life when they played a
few songs from their new album
on the roof of their Apple office
in downtown London. Comments
from the people on the street
below, when you could
urderstand them, were quite
amusing. The bobbies put on a
good show when they registered a
complaint from the neighboring
offices that the noise was too
loud.
John Lennon concluded their
roof top engagement by saying,
"I'd like to thank you on behalf
of the group. I hope we passed the
audition." Judging from previous
performances, I doubt it.

This week offers an

opportunity to set* two excellent
variations on the themes of fear
and cruelty: Roman Polanski's
" Cul-de-Sac" and Volker
Schlondorff's "Young Torless."
In the meantime, Clive Miller's
Freshman Film Series will present
"My Darling Clementine" aL 7:45
and "Deception" at 10 this
Tuesday in Geology 320.
Director John Ford based his
19<1G Western "My Darling

Clementine" on the Battle of the
O.K. Corral between Wyutt Earp
and the Clanton Gang. Henry
Fonda was Wyatt Earp is the
epitome of restraint as he portrays
the chivalrous lawman on
horseback.
Bette Davis stars as Christine
Radcliffe in Irving Rapper's
"Deception." Karel Novak (Paul
Henreid), a musical genius, returns

from WWII to the arms of
Christine only to learn that
composer-conductor Alexander
Hollius (Claude Rains) has been
keeping her in style while he's
been gone.
In an effort to prove that there
is really nothing between herself
and Alexander, Christine asks
Karel to be her husband.
"Jealousy and fear grip the

characters as irrationality controls
their actions," and as a result, a
small misunderstanding results in
Alexander's death.
Polanski's Favorite
Wednesday, at 7, 9, and 11 and
Cubberley, Beta Chi will .show
Roman Polanski's "Cul-de-Sac. A
gangster and his dying accomplice
on the run forms the basis for this
study of those perversions and
proclivities of the human soul that
emerge under pressure. Pinter and
Beckett were obviously influential
in Polanski's creation of the two
Theater-of the-Absurd characters.
Speaking in his normally
pretentious manner, Polanski,
director of "Knife in the Water,"
and "Repulsion," and
"Rosemary's B;iby," said: "The
film stands exactly as I wanted it
to and it's an addition to the
poetic language of the cinema. It
is my best film. 1 nlways loved it. I
always believed in it. It is real
cinema, done for cinema-like art
for art. It's well in advance of
anything that has been done in
the semantics of cinema. It was
written without any story. It was
what I like to see in the cinema. It
was the utmost fears in the
characters that I care about.
Characters and utmost fear are the
most important thing in cinema."
When asked about the criticism
"Cul-de-Sac" received for being
bizzare and excessively cruel,
Polanski replied: "Yes, I recall the
lady critic who used words like
' necrophilia, homosexuality,
sadism.' That is her problem, not
mine. I am not obsessed by these
things. It was just a film."
Final Kinetic Program
Also on Wednesday, the final
program of the Kinetic Art Series
will be shown at 7:30 and 9:30 in
Geology 320. Included on the
program of short creative films are
Stan Vanderbeek's computer
made film "Poen Field Number
One," Pascal Aubier's "Arthur,
Arthur" which explores the
further reaches of unreality in a
one-dimensional world- "as potent
as any drug," Jordan Belson's
"Momentum" which uses new
techniques of television-generated
color, and"The Chair," an
animated film by George
Dunning, one of the directors of
"Yellow Submarine."
Thursday evening, the
International Association will
present award winning "Young
Torless," the first film by German
director Volker Schloendorff, at
7:45 in Cubberley. Set in a
German boy's boarding school,
the film examines the latent
sadism and confused sexuality
that are the result of a repressive
educational system.
Schlondorff's film could be
seen as a parable about Nazism
and guilt by association, but its
