# Quiet March Outside As Ord Base Closed
## 
### 
Three thousand protesters
marched on the U.S. Army's Fort
Ord near Monterey Saturday, in a
non-violent demonstration against
the military. About 100 of those
present came from Stanford.
The demonstration, dubbed
"Armed Farces Day"and held
concurrently with the Armed
Forces Day holiday, began about
11:00 a.m., as the protesters
moved out from a meeting place
about a mile from the fort's
perimeter.
The group marched four miles
from the meeting point to the
fort's main gate along the side of
Route One. They paused briefly
at the gate chanting anti-war
slogans and urging the soldiers
inside to come out and join them.
The marchers then returned to
their starting point for a rally that
swelled out into the roadway and
blocked traffic for miles in both
directions.
Demonstrators had originally
intended to march onto the base
in the morning to talk to Gl's
before holding an afternoon rally
featuring GI speakers.
These plans had to be
cancelled, however, when military

officials called off the scheduled
Armed Forces Day activities at
the base, closing it to outside
persons. The city of Monterey
also cancelled the permit for the
rally in the face of predictions
that 50 to 100 thousand
demonstrators would show up. As
a further precaution, the base was
placed on alert and barbed wire
barricades were set up at the gates
and at weak points along the
perimeter, to keep civilians out.
The added fortifications were
guarded by a line of Gl's
re-inforced with Military Police.
Three helicopters kept watch over
the crowd, but no confrontations
materialized.
Most of the Gl's were confined
to a field inside the camp, some
distance from the highway; but
occasional loud cheering and
chanting could be heard outside
by the demonstrators, even above
the freeway noise.
A large sign posted at the main
gate warned against any
demonstrations, sit-ins, or
leafletting that had not been
"approved by the commanding
officer of the camp."
