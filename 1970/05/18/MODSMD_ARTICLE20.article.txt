of the Vietnam Moratorium, the
Associated Students, and the
Committee on Public Events. The
two congressmen will each have a
10-minute presentation, followed
by six minutes rebuttal. Audience
questions will follow.

themselves as peace candidates,
but differ somewhat on their
views on ending the war, and on
such issues as the grape strike and
.

abortion. Rep. Brown is to the
left on these .jssttos while Rep.
Tunney is considered a
"moderate."

throughout much of the race, but
the gap is apparently closing.

couple of percentage points
ahead. Brown, who has urged
impeachment of President Nixon
over Cambodia, has picked up

past 10 days."

have organized a fund-raising
barbecue, where people will have
a chance to meet the candidate. It

p.m.
