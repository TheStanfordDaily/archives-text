Stanford ranks third among
all colleges in the number of its
students serving in the Peace,
says Peace Corps Director
Joseph A. Blatchford. Of the
total of 495 Stanford students
who have been volunteers, 147
are now overseas or are in
training.
"The Peace Corps' search for
skilled workers and farmers to
round out its ranks has been
well publicized," Blatchford
said. "But the college-trained
generalist continues to be the
backbone or our international
effort. I don't see that fact
changing "
