# G.M. Stock Vote Set

DETROIT (AP) — General Motors
Corp. faces off formally this week
against a Ralph Nader-backed
group engaged in an effort "to
make GM responsible" through a
proxy fight.
GM's advantage will be proved
on Friday when stockholders are
expected to vote over-whelmingly
against two proposals pushed by
the Washington-based group
which calls itself Campaign GM.
There are 1.35 million
stockholders eligible to vote more
than 285 million shares.
But Philip Moore, 27-year-old
executive director of the
campaign, claims a public opinion
victory, and says the extent of the
group's influence won't be known
for months.
The battle is being waged by a

group of young Washington
lawyers, associated with Nader,
who formed Campaign GM as an
offshoot of their broader Project
on Corporate Responsibility. The
Project is sparring with other
firms over the public
responsibility issue, but primarily
through litigation.
The GM encounter is the
Project's first proxy fight.
Campaign GM succeeded in
forcing the giant automaker to
place two of its nine original
propbsals on the firm's proxy
statement. Without this step,
directed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Campaign
GM would have been left without
a platform. Any attempts to raise
issues at the annual meeting could
have been legally squelched by
Board Chairman James M.
Roche's gavel.
Proposals
But discussion of the
proposals—to add three "public"
members to the board of directors
and establish a committee to
study the corporation's
responsibility to the public-will
be mandatory. This, says Moore,
is an important gain ... "a
tactical victory."
Moore says he hopes to raise
specific issues at the meeting on
GM's responsibility in auto safety,
air pollution, product reliability,
mass transportation and"the
social welfare of the nation."
Moore and his colleagues say
they will be pleasantly shocked if

they received as much as 10
percent of the vote, and very
happy with 5 or 6 percent.
Disappointed
Moore conceded he is
disappointed by the response
from universities, mutual funds,
banks and other institutions
which-—the corporation has
acknowledged—control about 12
percent of the firm's stock.
The $775-million Rockefeller
Foundation announced it will
vote its 195,500 shares against the
Campaign. The foundation, in the
same announcement, criticized
GM's response to the dissident
move and hinted the next year it
might vote differently. The
Carnegie Foundation took similar
action, Moore said.
GM Board Chairman Roche has
stated that the real goal of
Campaign GM is an assault
"against the entire corporate
system of management."
Moore replies:
"It can hardly be called an
assault when we've gone the
traditional shareholder proxy
route."
In describing their goals, the
Campaign GM workers often
paraphrase a brief sentence in
Nader's book published in 1965,
"Unsafe At Any Speed."
"A great problem of
contemporary life now is to
control the power of economic
interests which ignore the harmful
effects of their applied science
and technology."
