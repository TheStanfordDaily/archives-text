## 
### 
In accordance with Article I, section D, l.d. of
the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, as
amended, the Student Conduct Legislative Council
presents below the text of first passage of two
items of proposed legislation. Comments and
suggestions regarding these legislative proposals
should be submitted in writing to Professor Hubert
Marshall, Chairman, SCLC, c/o Department of
Political Science on or before June 1, 1970.
Social Regulations
All current University regulations governing
student conduct in the following social activities
on the Stanford home campus are abolished:
(1) limitations on visiting hours
(2) sign-out procedures
(3) dress regulations
(4) regulations of the use of alcoholic beverages
other than those contained in state and county law
Members of individual living units, voluntary
organizations, and students, staff and faculty of
individual departments on the Stanford home
campus may, at their own discretion, establish
their own social regulations in the above
categories, as long as such regulations are not in
conflict with the laws of the State of California or
Santa Clara County.
Unless approved by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, such social regulations shall
not be enforced by the Stanford Judicial Council.
Closing of Campus Buildings
Whenever the President finds that a building or

any part of a building on the? campus cannot
effectively be used for its authorized operations,
or when the safety and security of persons,
records, equipment, or property therein are
endangered, because of the presence of persons in
the building or in the immediate vicinity of the
building, he may declare to be Closed for a stated
period of time, not to exceed thirty days, to all
persons except his specified designees.
After a closed building has been cleared of all
undesignated personnel, the President may
authorize persons having business therein to enter.
In the latter case, designees of the President, who
shall be stationed at an entrance or entrances to
the building, shall authorize and regulate access to
the building to categories of persons publicly
designated by the President.
Any student who enters or remains in a building
or the clearly defined area surrounding the
building in willful violation of an order closing the
building is guilty of an offense punishable by the
Stanford Judicial Council.
If the President wishes to open a building prior
to the end of the stated period for which it was
closed, he may do so by a formal declaration to
that effect. If a building remains closed until the
end of the stated period, the President may extend
or re-extend the period for a definite time, but no
one extension shall exceed thirty days.
Whenever the President is absent, all his powers
and obligations stated above shall be exercised by
the Acting President.
