### MARILYN L. MORRIS 
Don Ayer, recent returnee from
Washington with the Stanford
delegation, is the president-elect
of the Young Republicans.
Besides its new executive the Y.R.
political posture is new, "more
moderate, compared to its
traditional conservatism." An
official policy statement will be
released later this week.
Contesting Ayer for the
position were Jackson Booth,
Roman Buhler, and Joe Bostic.
Eddie Anderson will assist Ayer as
executive vice-president.
Vice-president in charge of
programs is Ellen May hew, and
Steven Duncan is the new
membership vice-president.

correspondences will be issued by
Debbie Hinze, while Vickie La
Brie assumes the recording
secretaryship. Treasurer Bruce
Hart will guard the clubs funds,
and its publication, The Stanford
Republican, will be edited by Bill
Bell.
Contrary to the dire prospectus
issued by "more liberal" members

of the capitol delegation, Ayer's
outlook is decidedly sanguine. "It
was sort of enlightening. I found
the government to be run by
human beings, rather than by

monster machines designed to
crush people."
Ayer is a junior, majoring in
History, and a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
