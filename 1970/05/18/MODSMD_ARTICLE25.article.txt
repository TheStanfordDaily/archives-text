# Med School Blasts 'Violent Racism'
## 
### 
The executive committee of
the School of Medicine issued a
statement on Friday condemning
what it termed as "violent and
destructive acts against black
people in this country."
The action, taken in the
aftermath of two student killings
on the campus of Jackson State
College, Mississippi, was
unprecedented for the 22-member
committee which has never
spoken out on a political issue as a
group.
"On the basis of news reports
it appears that the deaths of two
black students and the wounding
of 10 more at Jackson State
College, Mississippi, last night is
only the latest in a long history of
violent and destructive acts
against black people in this
country.
"The white community
experiences a little of such tactics
in the tragic deaths of four Kent
State students last week.
However, the Jackson State
deaths occurred not in the heat of
a confrontation, but in a fusillade
pumped into a dormitory. It
recalls the massacre at Orangeburg
State College, South Carolina, two
years ago. We also . learn today
that the six black residents of
Augusta, Georgia, killed two days
ago, were all shot in the back.
"It is idle to demand that our
country get out of Indochina as

long as violent racism flourishes in
this country. Therefore, we the
members of the executive
committee of the Stanford
Medical School faculty,
unanimously extend our profound
sympathy to the black
community and call upon the
President of the United States and
the Attorney General to take
necessary steps for the protection
of all our citizens and to compel
the accountability and
responsibility of all our law
enforcement agencies."
