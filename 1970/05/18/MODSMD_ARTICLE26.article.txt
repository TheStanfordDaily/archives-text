# Panel Today Tells War-Economy Link
## 
### 
A conference to acquaint
businessmen with the effects of
the war on the economy and the
University has been pulled
together by two Stanford
non-business students.
They have gathered a panel of
experts who will discuss the issues
from 8:15 a.m. to 10 a.m. today
in Bishop Auditorium.
On the panel are Prof. John W.
Lewis, director of Stanford's
Center For East Asian Studies; G.
L. Bach, professor of economics
and public policy at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business;
Albert H. Hastorf, professor of
psychology and dean of the
School of Humanities and
Sciences; and Moderator Leonard
Kingsley, partner in the
investment firm of Kingsley,
Schreck, Wells and Co., chairman
of the Harvard Business School
Alumni Club of Northern
California.
The meeting is open to the
public. Invitations have already
been mailed to Stanford Business
School alumni, to the Harvard and

Santa Clara Business School
alumni in the area, as well as to
Midpeninsula businessmen.
Sparkplugs of the program are
Larry Hardin, senior philosophy
major and head hasher at El Tigre
Eating Club, and Hans J. Dankers,
a senior psychology major of Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity.
In addition to concerned
faculty, students, and alumni of
Stanford's Business School,
co-sponsors of the program
include the Northern California
Chapter of Business Executives
Move for Vietnam Peace and Now
National Priorities (BEM for
short).
BEM is a national organization
of some 4000 members.
"The program is designed to
encourage person-to-person
dialogue between the campus and
the members of the business
community," Hardin and Dankers
said. "We hope that instead of a
student strike, we can get this
conference out into the
community
