# Through A Workout, Warmly
## 
### FRED LEESON 
The sweat was everybody's
Saturday as players, coaches and
fans brought spring football
practice to a sweltering conclusion
in an afternoon scrimmage at the
Stadium.
When it was over, Coach John
Ralston cradled a cold soft drink
and announced that "All the
questions we started with in
spring ball have been answered in
part, at least."
And a couple of scouts from
Arkansas who sat high under the
shadow of the press box weren't
exactly sure what they saw. "You
wouldn't happen to have a depth
chart, would you?" joked one,
who was well aware that perhaps
half of next fall's starters saw no
action.
Six are overseas, and Saturday
Dave Tipton sat it out with a bad
ankle, Younger Klippert's back
prevented his participation, Jim
Plunkett watched from the side in
shorts as a bruised sternum kept
him out, and Hillary Shockley
missed the action with a pulled
hamstring.
"You've got some skilled
players," the scout noted,
mentioning Jack Lasater and
Randy Vataha in particular. "And
this guy Boryla looked pretty
good."
Indeed he did, passing 15 for
20 and 207 yards, and leaving
Ralston with a tough decision
between him and Jesse Freitas
(13-24 and 170 yards) for second
quarterback.
"I thought Freitas had the edge
last week, and Mike Boryla this
week," Ralston said. "It's hard to
say. I won't make any choice until
I get a good look at the films."
Reggie Sanderson was voted
the game's outstanding offensive
player and Mike Simone got the
nod as best defender. Sanderson
rushed 105 yards on 13 carries,
the big one being a 71-yarder off
left tackle.

"The linemen did a real good
job," he said afterward. "They
really moved 'em out of there for
me."
The Whites came from behind
in the final minute to edge the
Red 8-7 in a game that had more
flags flying than a labor parade.
And the first quarter looked

like something out of Cambodia,
as the alleged offensivetroops
persistently fled before the alleged
defenders, and the Whites finished
with four yards rushing in the first
half.
But once the offensive squads
got rolling, they were more
impressive than the score

indicates. The Whites had a couple
drives stopped with fumbles in the
endzone and failed to score from
the one on three plays in the third
quarter.
The Reds scored in the second
quarter when Boryla rolled 15
yards to the White one after
Sanderson's 71 yard ramble, and
Reggie then hurtled into a wall of
bodies for the touchdown.
The Whites tallied in the last
minute with a long pass from Ted
Bleymaier to Mike Sobolik, and a
two point conversion toss to Barr
Curry brought the victory.
Eric Cross almost scored a
touchdown late in the third
quarter when he took a Freitas
pass, weaved around a host of
tacklers, and then stumbled over
one of his fallen teammates just as
he evaded the final pursuer. The
gain was 27 yards.
Boryla, a Colorado freshman
who was moved to flanker last fall
during frosh ball, said afterward,
"I think I'm getting my
quarterback skills back. I really
like to throw to Rancy and Jack,

but Vataha's hard to catch on a
streak."
Ralston expressed pleasure
with his team's over-all depth,
saying he needed to be three deep
at each position. He said his main
concerns at the beginning of
practice were at second
quarterback, linebacker, second
tight end and defensive backs.
Bob Berry and Glen Stone
were complimented for their work
at tight end, and with the addition
of Charles McCloud and Tim
Robnett, among others, Ralston
says, "As a total group, it could
be the best group of defensive
backs we've had."
Ralston said that a specialist
would be consulted about
Klippert's recurring back troubles,
and a minor operation in a week
or so would tighten up Lasater's
shoulder which now pops out of
joint occasionally.
"We're impressed with your
facilities and hospitality," that
Arkansas scout said, leaving for
the airport. "We're looking
forward to a good game next
fall."
