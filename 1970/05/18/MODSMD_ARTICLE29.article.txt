# USC Choice In Golf
## 
### 
In a sense, the whole season
has been a warm-up for Stanford's
golfers. Today and tomorrow they
take on the entire Pac-8 in the
11th Annual Conference
Championship and it's every team
for itself in a 72-hole scramble for
the title, regardless of won-loss
record to date.
The Indians figure to be among
the top contenders for the
tournament honors and are the
pick to knock off defending
champ, USC. The Trojans are
undefeated on the year.
USC has won the tournament
six times in the past while

Stanford has finished on top
twice.
This year, Tom Watson and
Gary Vanier are expected to lead
the Tribe's charge, while Gary
Sanders will captain the Trojan
defenders. Watson, Stanford's
leading ace, lost to Sanders by a
single stroke in an earlier meeting
while Vanier has the individual
title in the U.S. Collegiate
Invitational to his credit on the
season.
Each of the golfers from the
West Coast schools will play four
full rounds on host, Cal's, Mira
Vista course over the two day
tournament.
