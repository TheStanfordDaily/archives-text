## Dead Unarmed 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Witnesses say
police fatally shot three unarmed
bystanders during last week's
Augusta, Ga., riots in which six
persons died, the New York Times
reported Sunday.
The Times said two others
were killed in stores that were
being looted after violence
erupted in a Negro neighborhood
Monday night.
The newspaper said three
reporters it sent to the scene were
unable to find any witnesses to
the sixth slaying, although they
questioned scores of Negroes and
whites in Augusta;
The three newsmen reported
that in a four-day inquiry they
learned that: witnesses did not
believe the police fired in self
defense; no weapons were found
on the bodies of the six men; few
members of the 130-man police
department had received riot
control training; the police have
stymied a corner's inquest; none
of the dead were social activists
and none had taken part in
protest demonstrations; the police
did not begin shooting until
Negroes began dragging whites
from their cars and beating them.
The Times said the Augusta
police department has refused
comment on the shootings.
"We are investigating them
ourselves and when we are
finished we will make our reports
public," the paper quoted a police
spokesman as saying.

NEW YORK (AP) — Newsweek
magazine reported Sunday that
Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird
sent a top-secret cable to Gen.
Creighton Abrams urging him to
"impress" the American public
with capture of high-ranking
prisoners, major enemy
headquarters and arms caches in
Cambodia.
It did not say when the cable
was sent.
The magazine quoted the
section of the cable it said it
obtained as, "Dear Abe, In light
of the controversy over the U.S.

move into Cambodia, the
American public would be
impressed by any of the following
evidence of the success of the
operation: 1. high ranking enemy
prisoners; 2. major enemy
headquarters such as COSVN the
Communist Central Office for
South Vietnam; 3. large enemy
caches ..."
