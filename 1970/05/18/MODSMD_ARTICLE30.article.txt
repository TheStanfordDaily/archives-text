# The
						Season's Splitting End
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Like old friends exchanging
nsults over a warm beer, Stanford
ind Cal politely swapped victories
ast weekend to close out the
970 baseball season.
With an outside chance to make
econd place and the league
> yoffs, the Bears watched that
jpportunity disappear early
r riday afternoon in Sunken
3iamond when Stanford quickly
umped to a sizeable lead. The
:ontest eventually lumbered to a
un baked conclusion, with the
ndians, and Steve Dunning, 11-6
'i tors.
Apparently willing to keep the
Berklians out of the playoffs but
eluctant to embarrass them in
ront of the home folks, the Cards
>bliged by blowing several scoring
opportunities at UC Saturday and
osing 7-6 in 11 innings.
The decisions left the Bears
with a 9-8 league record and
Stanford with an 8-9 mark,
:omedowns for both teams from
heir 1969 marks. Hurt by the loss
if several extremely talented
>layers and by a few injuries, the
/oung Indians finished a far cry
V m their 16-5 second place spot
>112 last year.
Not The Best
Neither Dunning, nor Phil
teller, who went all 11 Saturday,
lad their best stuff, so the fact
hat one game was won and the
jlher lost was tied directly to the
l\vbe's offensive output. The
ndians stung the ball for 13 hits
Friday enabling Dunning, the
lation's strikeout leader and a pro
jrospect if there ever was one, to
jet by despite only fair speed and
he oppressive heat.
Steve gave up one in the first
>ui got a firm grip on the lead in
he second when rightfielder Hank
Snider got the first of his three
jits, a single and later scored on a
ingle by catcher Bob Reece.
'"Yeshman centerfielder Rod
bone's homer, followed by a
valk to Dunning, a Snider double
iu>j a Dick Borchers single gave
he Tribe a 5-1 edge after three.
Snider's third hit, another
louble, scored two more as
Stanford tallied four times in the
ourth and a Reece double
ollowed by Dave Edson's single
iroduced run number ten in the
iiv.h.
The Bears stirred up three runs
n the fifth with the help of a two
un single by Gary Reagan, the
enterfielder. Shortstop Jim

Corcoran, entering the series with
a .396 average, homered in the
ninth for Cal's fifth run, and
another score followed, but it was
a case of too little too late.
The day didn't do much for
Dunning's ERA, but like most
good pitchers, he was effective
and lucky enough to win when
not sharp. The triumph put his
season record at 13-2, breaking by
one game the Stanford win record
formerly held by Sandy Vance,
now of the Dodgers. In addition,
Dunning's seven strikeouts gave
him 144 to 108 innings, breaking
by thirty the all time Indian
record established by Jim
Lonborg, now of Boston.
You can almost hear the pros
panting.
Greeting three Cal pitchers, Bill
Schofield, Tony Murray and Neil
Ernst, with equal delight, five
Indians—Tom Williams, Boone,
Bob Wilhelm, Snider and
Reece—collected two or more
hits.
Heat Was On
A small dispute between
umpire Bob Albrecht and the Cal
bench—rightfielder Wayne Burd in
particular—carried over from
Friday to Saturday, getting the
Berkeley contest off to a loud and
nearly pyrotechnic start. By the
end of the first inning Albrecht
had incensed the Californians and
ejected Burd in a futile attempt to
silence the bench after Dave
Edson, who'd led off with a
single, slid high into Corcoran at
second.
The ruckus eventually subsided,
especially after the Indians
silenced the Bears with a five-run
fifth, but Cal had the last laugh
when pitcher Greg Tellis, who'd
fanned in two previous attempts,
looped a run-scoring single over
short to drive home the winning
run in the 11th.
Stanford was plagued all day by
three factors which have been
costly all season: poor
baserunning, sloppy fielding and
runners left on base.
The Cards made five errors
(only three runs off Keller were
earned), and stranded three men
in the fourth and seven in the last
three innings. In the 11th a blown
squeeze play, at least the fourth
of the weekend, cost a chance to
score after the Cards loaded the
bases with none out.
Which is not how games are
won.
Trailing 2-0 going into the fifth,

Stanford sent ten men to the dish
to move ahead 5-2. Bob Marshall
started things off with a double
and scored on a single by the
incredible Reece, who went four
for five with a homer and a
double. When Keller walked and
Edson took a retaliatory pitch on
the hip, starter Ron Wayne gave
way to Cal's Ken Nelson.
Nelson temporarily doused the
fire with two strikeouts but
Dunning came through with a 2-2
single up the middle for two runs.
Pat Rusco, the first baseman,
followed with another single,
good for two more before Nelson
regained control.
A walk to the torrid Corcoran,
followed by two singles, gave Cal
one in the seventh and a blast to
center by Ron Wilcox which
eluded Boone for a triple led to
three and a tie in the home eighth.
From there on in, Keller
appeared to regain some early
game sharpness (he finished with
12 k's), but he was deserted by his
fielders. And at the plate the
Tribe wasn't much better, blowing
chances in the ninth, tenth and
eleventh. Finally, in the bottom
half of the frame, Reagan reached
for Cal when Borchers couldn't
handle his slow hopper, and with
two outs Dave Alderete singled
him to third. And Oski roared as
Tellis' soft single looped over the
hustling and battered legs of
Edson.
