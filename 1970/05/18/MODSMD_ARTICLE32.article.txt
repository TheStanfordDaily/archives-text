# Fun And Games
## Not Quite As Usual 
### John Arthur 
A year ago, when Stanford visited Ca! to finish the Pacific-8
baseball season, Berkeley was in turmoil. The game was just several
days after the most violent of the People's Park disturbances, and
downtown Berkeley was swarming with hordes of street people,
National Guardsmen and Tactical Squad police. The campus was
closed.
Last Saturday, the UC scene was ostensibly different. People's Park
was a fading memory revived only by a peaceful Friday anniversary
march and a huge spread in the Daily Cal. On Sproul Plaza a group of
talented longhairs whipped red frisbees back and forth in the
midsummery air. A Dalmation vied with the players for possession of
the disk, making several spectacular grabs and leading participants in
wild chases across the pavement and over hedges. The patter of bare
feet and a rythmic drumming reverberated through the trees and out
onto a crowded Telegraph Avenue.
It was business as usual.
Against the War
For most California athletes, however, last weekend deviated
slightly from the norm. At a meeting last Tuesday, a committee
representing 200 UC athletes announced its opposition to the
Indochina War and divulged plans for the weekend. Various gestures,
including the wearing of armbands, were considered. The baseball
team, after some indecision, decided to issue a statement, which was
distributed both at Stanford Friday and at Cal Saturday.
Signed by 18 players, the statement affirmed that the signees felt
"morally committed to express our dissent over our government's
continued and expanded involvement in Southeast Asia," stressing
that "this is to be taken as a protest and is not to be constiued as a
strike or boycott, or a protest of organized athletics at the University.
We are instead speaking as individual human beings . . . and feel that
the organized committment of athletes in the area of politics is a
legitimate means of dissent."
Like few other phenomena, the Indochina war protest and the
national student strike are helping erase the outdated stereotype still
held in some quarters, of the dumb campus jock. The actions of the
Cal players, and of the 100 Stanford athletes who signed a petition
last week condemning the war are coming as a surprise to many
people not close to athletics. Some are startled that athletes even have
opinions on such matters, while others take the view that athletics
should be maintained as a world apart, a sort of never-never land
somewhere between reality and the boxscores.
Sports and Society
One of the UC ball players who signed the statement, infielder Gil
Pumar, disputes this view: "Too many people try to make baseball
apart from societyâ€”an outlet. I don't think they should do that. I'm
here both as an athlete and a student and I feel that I can participate
in any legitimate dissent. I don't agree with some players who see this
protest as being unrelated to their activities."
More so than the average student, however, the college athlete will
find himself in a difficult position when the time comes to boycott a
practice or an event. In a team sport, the choice will often be between
the following of one's conscience and the disruption of the team's
long-rehearsed performance. A rower who pulls out of a finely tuned
shell will likeiy destroy that shell's chances of victory. And there's
another element. The individual who hopes to continue competition
as a professional can jeopardize his chances by speaking out against
the establishment. Irv Baker, the Cal captain, told the Daily Cal last
week that "The sentiment was for wearing armbands, but very few
players said they would personally do it. Unlike track and tennis
athletes, baseball players are constantly being watched by scouts, and
a few ballplayers felt they might endanger their chances of signing a
pro contract." This fear is not unfounded. Professional teams have
regularly steered clear of militant athletes.
Finally, many athletes see themselves as particularly able to sway
opinions on matters not directly related to sports. They feel that their
political position in a protest can serve to change not only commonly
held stereotypes of jocks, but also many widely held stereotypes of
protestors, neither of which hold much water these days.
