# First Open Campus Draws 400 Visitors
## 
### 
"The community seems to
have given far more than a
minimal response to our plea for
an open campus," said Jacques
Delacroix, originator of the open
campus plan, as some 400 visitors
came to Stanford to discuss issues
with students.
The open campus will continue
indefinitely, according to
organizers who invited the "silent
majority" to come to Stanford
and air their views. Delacroix
called the unstructured
discussions between generations
the "beginning of a new culture."
Mike Fehling, head of the

Political Action Coordinating
Committee (PACC), noted the
low turnout of students willing to
exchange views with members of
the outside community. "Many
Stanford students seem to be in
training to become the silent
majority," he asserted. "I
question those students who
verbally seek peace and
reconciliation but who failed to
support this effort."
Businessmen, housewives,
retired people, veterans of foreign
wars, Birchers, Communists and
anarchists sat on the grass in the
bright sunshine explaining their

interpretation of the war and
questioning students on their
positions Despite the wide range
of political views represented
yesterday, the atmosphere was
uniformly cordial.
"I was surprised at the amount
of agreement between students
and the community. The dialogue
was tremendous," commented
Fehling. "Perhaps for the first
time, we at Stanford were
listening to these people. Our
visitors were marvelous. They
questioned all the assumptions
that we as students have made and
now employ so readily. It was a
learning experience on both
sides."
Delacroix announced that the
invitation to the community
would be reiterated in the days to
follow. Open invitations were
issued Friday and Saturday
through the newspapers and
broadcast media.
One San Francisco newsman
characterized the day's events as
an attempt by students to reunite
America and to dispel the notion
that college students are engaged
in a conspiracy against the
broader society.
Availing herself of the open
mike set up outside the Old Union
courtyard, a housewife
passionately told the listening
students that although "you are
beautiful, your minds are closed.
Under Communism you would
lose freedoms that mean so much
to you. Just as our parents found
the courage to send my generation
off to die, so you will find the
courage to send your children to
war."
Immediately after her
declaration she was enveloped by
earnest students who politely and
persistently pursued her line of
reasoning. Soon a dozen people
had gathered and the discussion
continued on the Old Union
courtyard grass.
In addition to informal
discussions and an open mike
provided throughout the day,
posters were provided for
do-it-yourself poster making.
Third World students told visitors
of their concerns about racism
and imperialism in a noon
gathering on White Plaza.
