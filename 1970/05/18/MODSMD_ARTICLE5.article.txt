# Caps And Gowns May Go For Peace
## 
### 
Commencement participants
may forego wearing the
traditional cap and gown as part
of national Peace Commencement
next month. Money which would
have been spent on cap and gown
rental will form a national fund to
support peace candidates in
critical November elections.
"All those taking part in
commencement are being asked to
voluntarily forego the cap and
gown as a manifest expression of
their desire to end the war,"
explained Dan Clement, who is
organizing Stanford's
participation in the national effort
begun at Yale.

"The object is not to coerce
people into not wearing their cap
and gown but to provide those
who wish an opportunity for
concrete political action for
peace," he continued. "The
university commencement
committee has said that
individuals will be permitted to
take part in the exercises without
academic garb."
Those who have already rented
a cap and gown can turn in their
receipt to No Cap and Gown, Box
2992, or sign a waiver at the table
in front of the bookstore before
Friday, so that rental fees can be
devoted to the Peace
Commencement Fund. Faculty
members who own their cap and
gown are being asked not to wear
them as a symbolic gesture and to
donate $10 to the peace fund.
Stanford will coordinate
similar moves in colleges in
Oregon, Washington, Utah,
Nevada and northern California.
A committee of students of
participating schools will allocate
the projected one million dollars
with the intent of achieving
maximum impact on the
composition of the next Congress.
Political analysts will be employed
to help determine which
congressional races are most
critical.
