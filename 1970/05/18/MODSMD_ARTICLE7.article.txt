# $500 Damage
## Arsonist Hits Polya 
### 
An early morning fire at Polya
Hall Friday, believed to be set by
an arsonist, was quickly
quenched, and damage to the
building was limited to an
estimated $500.
An outside wooden stairway at
the back of the building was
scorched and cracked, but the
building itself was untouched.
The alarm was turned in at
2:23 a.m. By the time the fire
units arrived, the blaze had been
contained by a security guard and
two workmen using fire
extinguishers.
Stanford's IBM 360/67
computer has often been
mentioned as a likely target for
militant action by demonstrators.
But Polya Hall, which adjoins Pine
Hall where the computer is
located, has only offices and
classrooms.
Workers in Polya Hall
speculated that the back stairwell
had been chosen for the fire
because it is well hidden, and

"perhaps they thought it would
take a long time for people to find
it."
The redwood steps and planks,
despite the fact that they had
been fireproofed, were burning
"really well," according to the
workers.
Stanford Fire Chief Frank
Jurian said three quart cans of
flammable material were
discovered on the scene. One,
half-filled with lighter fluid, was
found at the bottom of the steps.
Two others, which had contained
alcohol shellac, were found empty
a short distance from the building.
Jurian said the flammable
substances apparently had been
poured on the wall by someone
traveling up or down the stairs.
The Santa Clara County Fire
Marshall's Office has the case
under investigation, and is hopeful
of finding the arsonist or arsonists
from clues left near the stairway.
Workmen have been instructed
to begin repairing the damage
immediately.
