# Selection Process Dispute
## Sponsor Complaints Checked 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The office of the ASSU
Council of Presidents is
investigating the procedure used
to select freshman sponsors for
next year.
Hal Mickelson, a member of
the newly-elected Council, said
Saturday, "There have been
complaints made. We don't know
whether there is any substance to
them. That is what we are trying
to find out."
According to Mickelson, the
complaints generally concerned
the configuration of the
committees which interviewed
applicants and the political nature
of the questions asked by the
interviews.
However, head sponsor
Caroline Bixby, a member of the
sponsor selection committee,
stated, "It was a policy never to
inquire about people's political
convictions... I know of only
one incident when a political
question was asked."
Committee Makeup
The selection committee

consisted of eight current
sponsors who were elected by
those now in the sponsor
program, four freshmen selected
at random from committee
applicants and six faculty
residents.
The main committee was
divided into four subcommittees
which interviewed applicants.
Some students hold that people
outside the sponsor program were
not represented on all these
subcommittees, Mickelson said.
Miss Bixby stated that the
interviewing committee she
belonged to included sponsor
Buzz Hamburg, Florence Moore
faculty resident Marsden Blois and
freshman Buzz Toupin.
Similar Subcommittees
Sean Smith, a freshman
member of the selection
committee, said that the smaller
committees generally included
two sponsors, a faculty resident or
dorm director and a freshman.
"On occasion one or two
people could not make it for
personal reasons," he added, "but

all the committees were set up
that way."
Associate Dean of Students
William Leland confirmed that
complaints had been made and
said that his office was . . trying
to establish whether there is any
substance to them."
Miss Bixby said she knew
nothing of the complaints except
that she had heard a rumor that
the Daily was doing a story on the
sponsor selection procedure. "To
my knowledge, no members of
the committee, faculty residents
or dorm directors received any
complaints," she stated.
Group Narrowed
It was agreed that the selection
committee ". . . would narrow
down the original group
considerably," Miss Bixby
explained. "Resident staff had the
opportunity to recommend
students they thought would do
well in their house."
From the recommendations of
the four interviewing committees
and the faculty residents, the list
of prospective sponsors was

trimmed to a group slightly larger
than the 53 existing positions.
"The final selection has not been
made," she emphasized.
According to Miss Bixby, some
faculty residents who had not
made recommendations disagreed
with decisions to reject certain
applicants.
"We are interviewing those
students over again and are
reconsidering," she commented.
She suggested that anyone who
believes that departures were
made from the stated procedure
speak to a member of the
selection committee.
"It is very possible that these
represent isolated incidents or are
not true," Mickelson said of the
complaints.
He also said that not all the
complaints were from students
who were rejected.
Sponsors receive free rooms in
freshman residences. Dean Leland
said that they, like all resident
staff, are intended to be advisors
and counselors and to increase the
intellectual input of the students.

The office of the ASSU
Council of Presidents is
investigating the procedure used
to select freshman sponsors for
next year.
Hal Mickelson, a member of
the newly-elected Council, said
Saturday, "There have been
complaints made. We don't know
whether there is any substance to
them. That is what we are trying
to find out."
According to Mickelson, the
complaints generally concerned
the configuration of the
committees which interviewed
applicants and the political nature
of the questions asked by the
interviews.
However, head sponsor
Caroline Bixby, a member of the
sponsor selection committee,
stated, "It was a policy never to
inquire about people's political
convictions... I know of only
one incident when a political
question was asked."
Committee Makeup
The selection committee

consisted of eight current
sponsors who were elected by
those now in the sponsor
program, four freshmen selected
at random from committee
applicants and six faculty
residents.
The main committee was
divided into four subcommittees
which interviewed applicants.
Some students hold that people
outside the sponsor program were
not represented on all these
subcommittees, Mickelson said.
Miss Bixby stated that the
interviewing committee she
belonged to included sponsor
Buzz Hamburg, Florence Moore
faculty resident Marsden Blois and
freshman Buzz Toupin.
Similar Subcommittees
Sean Smith, a freshman
member of the selection
committee, said that the smaller
committees generally included
two sponsors, a faculty resident or
dorm director and a freshman.
"On occasion one or two
people could not make it for
personal reasons," he added, "but

all the committees were set up
that way."
Associate Dean of Students
William Leland confirmed that
complaints had been made and
said that his office was . . trying
to establish whether there is any
substance to them."
Miss Bixby said she knew
nothing of the complaints except
that she had heard a rumor that
the Daily was doing a story on the
sponsor selection procedure. "To
my knowledge, no members of
the committee, faculty residents
or dorm directors received any
complaints," she stated.
Group Narrowed
It was agreed that the selection
committee ". . . would narrow
down the original group
considerably," Miss Bixby
explained. "Resident staff had the
opportunity to recommend
students they thought would do
well in their house."
From the recommendations of
the four interviewing committees
and the faculty residents, the list
of prospective sponsors was

trimmed to a group slightly larger
than the 53 existing positions.
"The final selection has not been
made," she emphasized.
According to Miss Bixby, some
faculty residents who had not
made recommendations disagreed
with decisions to reject certain
applicants.
"We are interviewing those
students over again and are
reconsidering," she commented.
She suggested that anyone who
believes that departures were
made from the stated procedure
speak to a member of the
selection committee.
"It is very possible that these
represent isolated incidents or are
not true," Mickelson said of the
complaints.
He also said that not all the
complaints were from students
who were rejected.
Sponsors receive free rooms in
freshman residences. Dean Leland
said that they, like all resident
staff, are intended to be advisors
and counselors and to increase the
intellectual input of the students.
