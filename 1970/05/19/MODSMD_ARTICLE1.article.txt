# Radicals Break More Windows; 7 Arrested For Prior Protests
## 
### 
A tightly-organized group of
75 campus and high school
radicals swiftly marched across
campus last night, breaking scores
of windows at numerous targets
including the ROTC, Aero and
Astro, and both Hoover buildings.
Early yesterday morning seven
radicals were arrested, many of
them leaders of the Off ROTC
Movement. The Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office
announced that two more
warrants are outstanding and
more will be issued shortly.
The anti-ROTC band moved
quickly in close ranks from a
Radical Caucus meeting in Roble
Hall and gathered rocks as it
marched through the Quad and
then past the Art Museum. The
demonstrators went directly up to
the ROTC-Athletic building, lined
up along the curb in front, and
pelted windows on both floors
with a minute-long fusillade of
rocks.

The entire march to the ROTC
building took less than 10
minutes, and apparently caught
police off guard. TTie
rock-throwing interrupted a
freshman Army ROTC class being
held on the second floor.
The group then retreated past
the Hoover buildings and broke
windows there. The
demonstrators then ran through
Quad, smashing windows in
President's and Board of Trustees'
offices, and continued past the
Physics Tank, breaking more
there. The group then marched up
Via Crespi, breaking windows at
AEL, Petroleum Engineering, and
the Durand Aero and Astro
Building.
Disbanded
Moving past the Daily office,
the group proceeded to the
parking lot in front of Roble and
disbanded.
A small fire was set in a trash

bin at the machine shop, behind
Old Union, but firemen
extinguished it quickly. A false
alarm was also turned in as the
group left the ROTC building.
Earlier in the day Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies and
Palo Alto police had arrested
seven persons, four of them
students, for their participation in
Off-ROTC demonstrations.
Santa Clara County
Undersheriff James Geary, who
announced the police action at a
morning press conference, noted
that more warrants and arrests
could be expected.
The Associated Press (AP)
reported that as many as 25 more
arrests could be expected, but
that figure was denied by Santa
Clara Sergeant Donald Tamm.
Five of the seven suspects
arrested yesterday were charged
with malicious mischief for
alleged window breaking.

The other two were arrested on
more serious charges. Freshman
Joe Razo, was booked for assault
with a deadly weapon and
battery. Henry Lenox Anderson, a
member of the Resistance who
allowed himself to be arrested
after the second Old Union sit-in
in late April, was booked for
battery.
AP reported that Razo's arrest
stems from the April 30 beating
of astronaut son and Freee
Campus Movement (FCM)
member Wally Schirra 111. FCM
president Harvey Hukari, Jr. said
yesterday, however, that he had
talked to Schirra who had said
Razo was not the person who
attacked him. Schirra could not
be reached.
In preliminary hearings
yesterday afternoon Razo was
denied bail. He will go to court at
10 a.m. today to enter his plea.
The others were released late
yesterday afternoon on bail
ranging from $100 to $150.
Suspects
Those arrested for alleged
window-breaking were: former
students Bruce Pollock and
Diarmuid McGuire, both
prominent leaders of the
Off-ROTC movement; Janet
Weiss, another leader, and an
English graduate student; Lincoln
John Edgar (Malik), an Iraqi
researcher; and John F. Keilch a
graduate history student.
Police said the warrants were
issued on the basis of photographs
and eyewitness accounts of the
incidents, but they refused to say
whether the pictures used were
those taken by the University or
themselves. Sgt. Tamm would
only say that the "University was
involved to some degree" in the
identification process.
In a related development, the
Daily learned yesterday from
University counsel Paul Valentine
that 209 separate incidents
involving 117 students have been

investigated for possible SJC
action. The incidents all stemmed
from the past six weeks'
demonstrations including both
Old Union sit-ins and the blocking
of doors at ROTC, Encina and the
electronics laboratories during the
recent strike.
SJC Postponed
Valentine also said that the
SJC hearings of those students
also facing criminal charges would
be delayed until next fall so that
the campus judicial proceedings
do not prejudice criminal
proceedings.
A group of radicals, including
Paul Rupert, will discuss the most
recent arrests here on K.ZSU
between 7-8 p.m. tonight during a
panel on "Police Repression at
Stanford."

offices, and continued past the
Physics Tank, breaking more
there. The group then marched up
Via Crespi, breaking windows at
AEL, Petroleum Engineering, and
the Durand Aero and Astro
Building.
Disbanded
Moving past the Daily office,
the group proceeded to the
parking lot in front of Roble and
disbanded.
A small fire was set in a trash

bin at the machine shop, behind
Old Union, but firemen
extinguished it quickly. A false
alarm was also turned in as the
group left the ROTC building.
Earlier in the day Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies and
Palo Alto police had arrested
seven persons, four of them
students, for their participation in
Off-ROTC demonstrations.
Santa Clara County
Undersheriff James Geary, who
announced the police action at a
morning press conference, noted
that more warrants and arrests
could be expected.
The Associated Press (AP)
reported that as many as 25 more
arrests could be expected, but
that figure was denied by Santa
Clara Sergeant Donald Tamm.
Five of the seven suspects
arrested yesterday were charged
with malicious mischief for
alleged window breaking.

The other two were arrested on
more serious charges. Freshman
Joe Razo, was booked for assault
with a deadly weapon and
battery. Henry Lenox Anderson, a
member of the Resistance who
allowed himself to be arrested
after the second Old Union sit-in
in late April, was booked for
battery.
AP reported that Razo's arrest
stems from the April 30 beating
of astronaut son and Freee
Campus Movement (FCM)
member Wally Schirra 111. FCM
president Harvey Hukari, Jr. said
yesterday, however, that he had
talked to Schirra who had said
Razo was not the person who
attacked him. Schirra could not
be reached.
In preliminary hearings
yesterday afternoon Razo was
denied bail. He will go to court at
10 a.m. today to enter his plea.
The others were released late
yesterday afternoon on bail
ranging from $100 to $150.
Suspects
Those arrested for alleged
window-breaking were: former
students Bruce Pollock and
Diarmuid McGuire, both
prominent leaders of the
Off-ROTC movement; Janet
Weiss, another leader, and an
English graduate student; Lincoln
John Edgar (Malik), an Iraqi
researcher; and John F. Keilch a
graduate history student.
Police said the warrants were
issued on the basis of photographs
and eyewitness accounts of the
incidents, but they refused to say
whether the pictures used were
those taken by the University or
themselves. Sgt. Tamm would
only say that the "University was
involved to some degree" in the
identification process.
In a related development, the
Daily learned yesterday from
University counsel Paul Valentine
that 209 separate incidents
involving 117 students have been

investigated for possible SJC
action. The incidents all stemmed
from the past six weeks'
demonstrations including both
Old Union sit-ins and the blocking
of doors at ROTC, Encina and the
electronics laboratories during the
recent strike.
SJC Postponed
Valentine also said that the
SJC hearings of those students
also facing criminal charges would
be delayed until next fall so that
the campus judicial proceedings
do not prejudice criminal
proceedings.
A group of radicals, including
Paul Rupert, will discuss the most
recent arrests here on K.ZSU
between 7-8 p.m. tonight during a
panel on "Police Repression at
Stanford."

RKSPONSF-—Two tire trucks turned out to douse au ashcaii fire that was set afire
last night a« about 75 demonstrators raced through campus breaking windows.
A tightly-organized group of
75 campus and high school
radicals swiftly marched across
campus last night, breaking scores
of windows at numerous targets
including the ROTC, Aero and
Astro, and both Hoover buildings.
Early yesterday morning seven
radicals were arrested, many of
them leaders of the Off ROTC
Movement. The Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office
announced that two more
warrants are outstanding and
more will be issued shortly.
The anti-ROTC band moved
quickly in close ranks from a
Radical Caucus meeting in Roble
Hall and gathered rocks as it
marched through the Quad and
then past the Art Museum. The
demonstrators went directly up to
the ROTC-Athletic building, lined
up along the curb in front, and
pelted windows on both floors
with a minute-long fusillade of
rocks.

The entire march to the ROTC
building took less than 10
minutes, and apparently caught
police off guard. TTie
rock-throwing interrupted a
freshman Army ROTC class being
held on the second floor.
The group then retreated past
the Hoover buildings and broke
windows there. The
demonstrators then ran through
Quad, smashing windows in
President's and Board of Trustees'

with a deadly weapon and
battery. Henry Lenox Anderson, a
member of the Resistance who
allowed himself to be arrested
after the second Old Union sit-in
in late April, was booked for
battery.
AP reported that Razo's arrest
stems from the April 30 beating
of astronaut son and Freee
Campus Movement (FCM)
member Wally Schirra 111. FCM
president Harvey Hukari, Jr. said
yesterday, however, that he had
talked to Schirra who had said
Razo was not the person who
attacked him. Schirra could not
be reached.
In preliminary hearings
yesterday afternoon Razo was
denied bail. He will go to court at
10 a.m. today to enter his plea.
The others were released late
yesterday afternoon on bail
ranging from $100 to $150.
Suspects
Those arrested for alleged
window-breaking were: former
students Bruce Pollock and
Diarmuid McGuire, both
prominent leaders of the
Off-ROTC movement; Janet
Weiss, another leader, and an
English graduate student; Lincoln
John Edgar (Malik), an Iraqi
researcher; and John F. Keilch a
graduate history student.
Police said the warrants were
issued on the basis of photographs
and eyewitness accounts of the
incidents, but they refused to say
whether the pictures used were
those taken by the University or
themselves. Sgt. Tamm would
only say that the "University was
involved to some degree" in the
identification process.
In a related development, the
Daily learned yesterday from
University counsel Paul Valentine
that 209 separate incidents
involving 117 students have been

investigated for possible SJC
action. The incidents all stemmed
from the past six weeks'
demonstrations including both
Old Union sit-ins and the blocking
of doors at ROTC, Encina and the
electronics laboratories during the
recent strike.
SJC Postponed
Valentine also said that the
SJC hearings of those students
also facing criminal charges would
be delayed until next fall so that
the campus judicial proceedings
do not prejudice criminal
proceedings.
A group of radicals, including
Paul Rupert, will discuss the most
recent arrests here on K.ZSU
between 7-8 p.m. tonight during a
panel on "Police Repression at
Stanford."
