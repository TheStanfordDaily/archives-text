# A 						'Flexible' ROTC
## The 						Punitive Clause 
### Jam es Gibbons 
The most likely result of
denying academic credit to ROTC
is that the military will
completely remove ROTC from
Stanford. Given this, it is doubtful
whether the military would
seriously consider any
modifications we might suggest in
the punitive clause. However, in
the unlikely event that ROTC
stays and/or future negotiations
materialize, it might be helpful to
develop a position on the punitive
clause. Specifically, can it be
modified to provide cadets with
more flexible choices in case they
want to leave the program?
The proposal below is offered
with this possibility in mind. It
was first developed about three
weeks ago through conversations
with two cadets, and subsequently
presented to most of the members
of two ROTC units for their
consideration. The proposal met
with general approval, though
several changes were suggested by
the cadets (included in the
footnotes). The footnoted
proposal was presented to the
Mann Committee on May 11 and
is being presented now as
background for the questionnaire
they plan to distribute later this
week.
Proposal
We recommend that the
punitive clause in the ROTC
contract be amended to permit a
cadet to leave the program at any
time (1) prior to the date that he
accepts his commission. In return
for increasing the period of
choice, (2) we propose that:
(a) any cadet who chooses to
leave the program should assume
responsibility for repayment of a
student loan, the amount of

which would be determined by a
realistic computation of the
expenditure that the federal
government has made toward his
education, perhaps including even
those outlays that are made
during the first two years; (3) and,
(b) any cadet who chooses to
leave the program should be
placed in the next (4) draft
lottery with the same status he
had at the time he entered the
ROTC program.
The loan referred to in (a)
could be readily handled under
the existing Federal Guaranteed
Student Loan Program.
Footnotes
1. Some cadets felt that the
Ehrase "up to six months" should
e added nere to give the military
sufficient time to plan for the
effective deployment of ROTC
graduates.
2. A delay in the signing of a
binding agreement until six
months prior to the time the
commission is accepted has been
suggested as an alternate to
increasing the period of choice.
3. Some cadets felt that outlays
made during the first two years of
the program should not be
included in computing the student
loan, since the present contract
already guarantees this much
without repayment.
4. The word next was added to
insure that a student does not
"decide to leave" because his
birthdate makes it unlikely for
him to be drafted on the basis of
the lottery that is current.
Comments
(a) Some of the cadets do not feel
that the punitive clause is unjust,
but agree that increased flexibility
would be desirable.

graduates.
2. A delay in the signing of a
binding agreement until six
months prior to the time the
commission is accepted has been
suggested as an alternate to
increasing the period of choice.
3. Some cadets felt that outlays
made during the first two years of
the program should not be
included in computing the student
loan, since the present contract
already guarantees this much
without repayment.
4. The word next was added to
insure that a student does not
"decide to leave" because his
birthdate makes it unlikely for
him to be drafted on the basis of

Comments
(a) Some of the cadets do not feel
that the punitive clause is unjust,
but agree that increased flexibility
would be desirable.

The most likely result of
denying academic credit to ROTC
is that the military will
completely remove ROTC from
Stanford. Given this, it is doubtful
whether the military would
seriously consider any
modifications we might suggest in
the punitive clause. However, in
the unlikely event that ROTC
stays and/or future negotiations
materialize, it might be helpful to
develop a position on the punitive
clause. Specifically, can it be
modified to provide cadets with
more flexible choices in case they
want to leave the program?
The proposal below is offered
with this possibility in mind. It
was first developed about three
weeks ago through conversations
with two cadets, and subsequently
presented to most of the members
of two ROTC units for their
consideration. The proposal met
with general approval, though
several changes were suggested by
the cadets (included in the
footnotes). The footnoted
proposal was presented to the
Mann Committee on May 11 and
is being presented now as
background for the questionnaire
they plan to distribute later this
week.
Proposal
We recommend that the
punitive clause in the ROTC
contract be amended to permit a
cadet to leave the program at any
time (1) prior to the date that he
accepts his commission. In return
for increasing the period of
choice, (2) we propose that:
(a) any cadet who chooses to
leave the program should assume
responsibility for repayment of a
student loan, the amount of

which would be determined by a
realistic computation of the
expenditure that the federal
government has made toward his
education, perhaps including even
those outlays that are made
during the first two years; (3) and,
(b) any cadet who chooses to
leave the program should be
placed in the next (4) draft
lottery with the same status he
had at the time he entered the
ROTC program.
The loan referred to in (a)
could be readily handled under
the existing Federal Guaranteed
Student Loan Program.
