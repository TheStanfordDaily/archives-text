Silent Majority
Students:
Greetings from the "over 30"
silent majority. My wife and I do
make ourselves heard from once
in a while, but because of our
advanced age, we are easily taken
for members of the unheard from
middle class. I'm a senile 36, and
my wife is creaking around at 31.
We are both graduates of the
Farm.
Let there be no mistake about
it, we completely sympathize with
the student movement. We have
long felt that any U.S.
involvement in S.E. Asia is
morally wrong. We support any
movement that demands complete
and immediate withdrawal from
Indochina.
While I know that you don't
particularly like the "middle
class," it would be so enormously
helpful to your cause if they were
on your side. They represent a
very large voting block, and this
voting power will select fateful
choices in September.
You have been highly
successful at getting their
attention—perhaps to the point
that they feel a little banged
around the ears. It might now be
an appropriate time to press
forward attempts to reach their
moral consciousness.

Before you can open a channel
of communication with them,
they must first be able to identify
with you. You must look
believable. Excessive distruction
turns them off. Very extreme
dress that results in a Charles
Manson appearance doesn't help
either. This does not mean buying
a new wardrobe or stopping the
protest. It means that to win you
need a majority. You have their
attention, now get their vote.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I understand that Stanford
University offers the opportunity
to acquire an education. Who
should I talk to and where do I
sign for this acquisition? I have
plenty of money.
