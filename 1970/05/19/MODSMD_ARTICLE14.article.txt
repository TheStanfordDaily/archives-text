# Inter-Departmental Committee Meets
## 
### 
Individual departments of the
university have reacted strongly in
response to the strike movement
at Stanford University.
The resolutions they passed
regarding these issues provide a
unique example of a concerned
Stanford community which has
assumed responsibility.
Lacking central co-ordination,
however, many university
departments have reverted to de
facto "business as usual." With
individual exceptions,
responsibility has slipped from the
hands of a united community.
To reverse this trend, an
Interdepartmental Co-ordinating
Committee has been formed by
many university departments. The
provisional structure and policy
statement of this committee has
been reviewed by a sub-committee
which has proposed that the
Inter-departmental Co-ordinating
Committee adopt the following
proposals:
The committee co-ordinate
departmental decisions in order to
present a consensus of
departmental sentiment on
important issues.
That the Committee
immediately consider
(a) implementation of the
Princeton plan for Fall Quarter
1970
(b) formation of a community
review and control board
addressing itself initially to the
issues of war-related research and
activities on campus
(c) the consequences which the
trend away from humanities will

have on the university.
A vote will be taken on these
proposals during the next general
meeting of the Inter-departmental
Co-ordinating Committee which
will be held May 19, 4 p.m., in the
Art School auditorium. All
departments not yet integrated
into the co-ordinating committee
are encouraged to send two
elected representatives to this
meeting.
