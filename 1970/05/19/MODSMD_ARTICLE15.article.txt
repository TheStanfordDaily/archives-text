# Peace Work Volunteers
## 
### 
A Stanford chapter of the
Movement for a New Congress
was created this weekend to sign
up students willing to work for
peace candidates this summer.
Organizers are convinced that
large numbers of student
volunteers can spell the difference
between victory and defeat for
candidates opposing the war.
Lists of students willing to
work will be sent to the national
headquarters at Princeton, where
the Movement was born two
weeks ago. Volunteers will be
correlated with information about
the crucial Congressional races so
each campaign headquarters can
contact the individual.
Those interested in doing
campaign work can sign up at the
Movement for a New Congress
table in White Plaza or phone
x 4066.
