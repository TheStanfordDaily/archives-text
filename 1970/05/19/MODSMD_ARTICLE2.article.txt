# At ROTC Building
## Blockade Continues 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
"Off-ROTC" has had to share
attention with Cambodia, "Free
Burnell," and other demands
recently. And blocking doorways
ceased to be a campus-wide
controversy when the Encina and
research laboratory blockades
were lifted.
But protestors are still blocking
the ROTC-Athletic Building
doorways for over ten hours every
weekday to protest military
training on campus. After eleven
days of "militant nonviolence"
their policy is unchanged—cour
teously allowing those on Athletic
Department business to pass while
physically blocking people
involved with ROTC.
The big difference from the
blockade's first days is that no
one in ROTC even comes bv any

more. The second floor ROTC
offices and classrooms are locked
and empty.
Army and Navy ROTC officials
confirmed that their classes had
been moved to other classrooms
on campus. Drill activities
reportedly have been moved off
campus. Army ROTC award
ceremonies were held at Moffett
Field yesterday, and Navy awards
are planned there today. Air
Force officials could not be
reached for comment on their
classes.

Col. Robert Thomas, Director
of Naval ROTC, said that
important NROTC administrative
papers had been moved from the
building at night, when it was not
blocked.
He said, "We're conducting our
daily work, but at tremendous
inconvenience to a number of
people."
The Army ROTC chief, Col.
Stanley Ramey, refused to
comment on what administrative
work is continuing.
But at least five "Off-ROTC"
demonstrators still appear before
7 o'clock every morning, just to
be sure ROTC business does not
return to its official headquarters.
Symbolic Blockade
As they sat at the building's
front and back doors, the
protestors yesterday discussed
their continuation of the picket
line. One person believed that
ROTC has definitely given up on
using the building this quarter,
making continued blockading
only "symbolic."
But Jill Joseph, almost 9
months pregnant, sits at the doors
every day. And she answered, "In
my mind, that we're doing a
symbolic thing is not synonomous

with doing an impotent thing."
Mrs. Joseph added, "My doctor
said it was alright for me to be
here, and I say it's important."
Last Wednesday and Thursday,
Standard Judicial Council (SJC)
came by to declare
the protestors in violation of the
campus disruption policy.
Forty-four students gave their
names rather than face immediate
suspension for the rest of the
quarter.
ROTC 44
But some of the "ROTC 44"
are now back on the lines as they
plan their trials, and the SJC has
not returned.
Mrs. Joseph said she gave her
name because she believed her
actions were right and "I'm
willing to face the consequences."
Others had expected the SJC
to come every day. They had
planned to greet its
representatives with a new group
of demonstrators daily, willingly
giving their names in hopes of
overloading the SJC docket.
While ROTC offices upstairs
are empty, first floor Athletic
Department activities were
described by one coach as "just
short of business-as-usual." Ted
Glarrow, Athletic Department
Office and Ticket Manager, said
that off-campus visitors were
hesitant to pass the pickets even
though they were not blocked. He
added it was necessary to set up a
booth across the street from the
building to give information on
season football tickets for next
year.
But Glarrow said Athletic
Department employees were
having no problems in getting past
the seated demonstrators. He
explained, "They say they
recognize our knees."

every day. And she answered, "In
my mind, that we're doing a
symbolic thing is not synonomous

with doing an impotent thing."
Mrs. Joseph added, "My doctor
said it was alright for me to be
here, and I say it's important."
Last Wednesday and Thursday,
Standard Judicial Council (SJC)
came by to declare
the protestors in violation of the
campus disruption policy.
Forty-four students gave their
names rather than face immediate
suspension for the rest of the
quarter.
ROTC 44
But some of the "ROTC 44"
are now back on the lines as they
plan their trials, and the SJC has
not returned.
Mrs. Joseph said she gave her
name because she believed her
actions were right and "I'm
willing to face the consequences."
Others had expected the SJC
to come every day. They had
planned to greet its
representatives with a new group
of demonstrators daily, willingly
giving their names in hopes of
overloading the SJC docket.
While ROTC offices upstairs
are empty, first floor Athletic
Department activities were
described by one coach as "just
short of business-as-usual." Ted
Glarrow, Athletic Department
Office and Ticket Manager, said
that off-campus visitors were
hesitant to pass the pickets even
though they were not blocked. He
added it was necessary to set up a
booth across the street from the
building to give information on
season football tickets for next
year.
But Glarrow said Athletic
Department employees were
having no problems in getting past
the seated demonstrators. He
explained, "They say they
recognize our knees."
"Off-ROTC" has had to share
attention with Cambodia, "Free
Burnell," and other demands
recently. And blocking doorways
ceased to be a campus-wide
controversy when the Encina and
research laboratory blockades
were lifted.
But protestors are still blocking
the ROTC-Athletic Building
doorways for over ten hours every
weekday to protest military
training on campus. After eleven
days of "militant nonviolence"
their policy is unchanged—cour
teously allowing those on Athletic
Department business to pass while
physically blocking people
involved with ROTC.
The big difference from the
blockade's first days is that no
one in ROTC even comes bv any

more. The second floor ROTC
offices and classrooms are locked
and empty.
Army and Navy ROTC officials
confirmed that their classes had
been moved to other classrooms
on campus. Drill activities
reportedly have been moved off
campus. Army ROTC award
ceremonies were held at Moffett
Field yesterday, and Navy awards
are planned there today. Air
Force officials could not be
reached for comment on their
classes.
Papers Removed
Col. Robert Thomas, Director
of Naval ROTC, said that
important NROTC administrative
papers had been moved from the
building at night, when it was not
blocked.
He said, "We're conducting our
daily work, but at tremendous
inconvenience to a number of
people."
The Army ROTC chief, Col.
Stanley Ramey, refused to
comment on what administrative
work is continuing.
But at least five "Off-ROTC"
demonstrators still appear before
7 o'clock every morning, just to
be sure ROTC business does not
return to its official headquarters.
Symbolic Blockade
As they sat at the building's
front and back doors, the
protestors yesterday discussed
their continuation of the picket
line. One person believed that
ROTC has definitely given up on
using the building this quarter,
making continued blockading
only "symbolic."
But Jill Joseph, almost 9
months pregnant, sits at the doors
every day. And she answered, "In
my mind, that we're doing a
symbolic thing is not synonomous

with doing an impotent thing."
Mrs. Joseph added, "My doctor
