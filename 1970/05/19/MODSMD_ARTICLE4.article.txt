# Will Faculty Senate Eliminate ROTC?
## 
### FRANK MILLER PHIL REVZIN 
The faculty Senate could easily vote to
eliminate ROTC from the Stanford campus this
quarter.
Yesterday, the Berkeley faculty Senate
overwhelmingly recommended that ROTC become
an "off-campus extra-curricular activity" and
recommended that its committee on courses
abolish credit for ROTC classes.
A week and a half ago the Stanford faculty
Senate voted to deny credit to ROTC classes. And
before the quarter is over, it will also consider
recommending that it should be a "voluntary
student organization."
According to Provost Richard Lyman, making
ROTC such a voluntary organization would be
tantamount to removing ROTC from campus. On
February 12, 1969, the original student-faculty
committee report on ROTC recommended such a
status for ROTC but the proposal was referred to
the Advisory Committee on ROTC—which has
taken no action on the proposal.
Last year's majority report emphasized that
on-campus activities must be voluntary. Needless
to say, this eliminates much of the ROTC program
as it is now designed.
Not Titled ROTC
The report said, "It is likely that the program
which we recommend would not and should not
be denoted as 'ROTC." It envisioned recruiting
efforts and voluntary on-campus activities with
required off-campus training. It suggested that the
summer ROTC training be expanded to encompass
the training that now takes place on campus.
At that time, the Senate was informed that the
\rmed Forces would not accept the restrictions of
laving ROTC a voluntary extra-curricular activity.
Not wanting to "Off-ROTC," the Senate took
no action on the recommendation. According to
several reports, in the Senate debate few, if any,
Senators even suggested that ROTC should not be
on campus.
A year later, Berkeley faculty has taken an

extraordinary action—especially for a public
institution. And the Stanford faculty may take
similar action. Because the Regents or President of
the University of California can overrule the
faculty, the force of the Berkeley faculty vote was
unclear.
Senate Controls Credit
Here, the faculty Senate can only recommend
that ROTC become a voluntary student
activity—the President and Board of Trustees have
the final power. It does, however, control the
granting of credit for ROTC courses.
Now, the group might favor making ROTC
extra-curricular activity. At their May 7 meeting, it
defeated a motion to consider such action in a
narrow 24 to 21 vote.
Indications are that most of the 21 who wanted
to consider the motion at that time favor making
ROTC a voluntary activity. At least several of

News Analysis

those who voted against considering the motion
merely wanted to put off the decision until they
get new information on ROTC. A motion that
would have put the Senate on record as supporting
ROTC was handily defeated in a voice vote at that
meeting.
Referendum
Many Senators are awaiting the results of a
referendum on ROTC being conducted by the
Advisory Committee. Others want to find out
what is happening at other schools or what can be
done about the punitive clause.
Many Senators think that the situation has
greatly changed in a year and even in recent weeks.
They f ep| that another student referendum might
show tha students now want ROTC off campus.
It is harsh to say that the Senate would vote to
Off ROTC. They ' would be eliminating ROTC
through a maneuver that would make it look like
ROTC could not adapt to the University. Many
Senators sincerely believe that ROTC should have
no favored status—that it should be merely a

voluntary extra-curricular activity. While they
would not say that the military should be singled
out for attack by the University, they will
certainly say that it should not be favored in any
way.
The ASSU Council of Presidents has said, "If
the Defense Department is unwilling to accept
this, then we don't think it is appropriate for the
University to make special arrangements for
ROTC." '
Changes
The Defense Department does not agree with
this reasoning—the Stanford faculty evidently did
not last year; however the Berkeley faculty does
agree.
What has changed in a year? The Berkeley
faculty said it took its action for valid academic
reasons. But the Los Angeles Times reported last
week that the UCLA faculty voted "to eliminate
academic c edit for ROTC until U.S. involvement
ends in Southeast Asia." One has to wonder if the
Berkeley faculty wasn't thinking yesterday along
similar lines.
The large part of Stanford faculty Senate has
changed its mind in a year. Why? The Off-ROTC
movement has had something to do with it.
Senators will say that they will not bow to
violence, but the movement has kept the issue in
the news and in the minds of Senators.
History Professor David Potter has called ROTC
the "whipping boy for the Vietnam War." At a
minimum, the Vietnam War and the American
invasion of Cambodia has made many faculty
members unwilling to support the military.
Several senators have said that after the
invasion of Cambodia has made them feel that
they must now strike out at the closest symbol of
the military—ROTC.
A few years ago ROTC was sale. Most taculty
members felt the University should support the
military in its activities. Now, while some openly
attack the military and say that ROTC should be
"offed" because it is part of that military, many
others are merely now unwilling to favor the
military.

February 12, 1969, the original student-faculty
committee report on ROTC recommended such a
status for ROTC but the proposal was referred to
the Advisory Committee on ROTC—which has
taken no action on the proposal.
Last year's majority report emphasized that
on-campus activities must be voluntary. Needless
to say, this eliminates much of the ROTC program
as it is now designed.
Not Titled ROTC
The report said, "It is likely that the program
which we recommend would not and should not
be denoted as 'ROTC." It envisioned recruiting
efforts and voluntary on-campus activities with
required off-campus training. It suggested that the
summer ROTC training be expanded to encompass
the training that now takes place on campus.
At that time, the Senate was informed that the
\rmed Forces would not accept the restrictions of
laving ROTC a voluntary extra-curricular activity.
Not wanting to "Off-ROTC," the Senate took
no action on the recommendation. According to
several reports, in the Senate debate few, if any,
Senators even suggested that ROTC should not be
on campus.
A year later, Berkeley faculty has taken an

extraordinary action—especially for a public
institution. And the Stanford faculty may take
similar action. Because the Regents or President of
the University of California can overrule the
faculty, the force of the Berkeley faculty vote was
unclear.
Senate Controls Credit
Here, the faculty Senate can only recommend
that ROTC become a voluntary student
activity—the President and Board of Trustees have
the final power. It does, however, control the
granting of credit for ROTC courses.
Now, the group might favor making ROTC
extra-curricular activity. At their May 7 meeting, it
defeated a motion to consider such action in a
narrow 24 to 21 vote.
Indications are that most of the 21 who wanted
to consider the motion at that time favor making
ROTC a voluntary activity. At least several of

News Analysis

those who voted against considering the motion
merely wanted to put off the decision until they
get new information on ROTC. A motion that
would have put the Senate on record as supporting
ROTC was handily defeated in a voice vote at that
meeting.
Referendum
Many Senators are awaiting the results of a
referendum on ROTC being conducted by the
Advisory Committee. Others want to find out
what is happening at other schools or what can be
done about the punitive clause.
Many Senators think that the situation has
greatly changed in a year and even in recent weeks.
They f ep| that another student referendum might
show tha students now want ROTC off campus.
It is harsh to say that the Senate would vote to
Off ROTC. They ' would be eliminating ROTC
through a maneuver that would make it look like
ROTC could not adapt to the University. Many
Senators sincerely believe that ROTC should have
no favored status—that it should be merely a

voluntary extra-curricular activity. While they
would not say that the military should be singled
out for attack by the University, they will
certainly say that it should not be favored in any
way.
The ASSU Council of Presidents has said, "If
the Defense Department is unwilling to accept
this, then we don't think it is appropriate for the
University to make special arrangements for
ROTC." '
Changes
The Defense Department does not agree with
this reasoning—the Stanford faculty evidently did
not last year; however the Berkeley faculty does
agree.
What has changed in a year? The Berkeley
faculty said it took its action for valid academic
reasons. But the Los Angeles Times reported last
week that the UCLA faculty voted "to eliminate
academic c edit for ROTC until U.S. involvement
ends in Southeast Asia." One has to wonder if the
Berkeley faculty wasn't thinking yesterday along
similar lines.
The large part of Stanford faculty Senate has
changed its mind in a year. Why? The Off-ROTC
movement has had something to do with it.
Senators will say that they will not bow to
violence, but the movement has kept the issue in
the news and in the minds of Senators.
History Professor David Potter has called ROTC
the "whipping boy for the Vietnam War." At a
minimum, the Vietnam War and the American
invasion of Cambodia has made many faculty
members unwilling to support the military.
Several senators have said that after the
invasion of Cambodia has made them feel that
they must now strike out at the closest symbol of
the military—ROTC.
A few years ago ROTC was sale. Most taculty
members felt the University should support the
military in its activities. Now, while some openly
attack the military and say that ROTC should be
"offed" because it is part of that military, many
others are merely now unwilling to favor the
military.
The faculty Senate could easily vote to
eliminate ROTC from the Stanford campus this
quarter.
Yesterday, the Berkeley faculty Senate
overwhelmingly recommended that ROTC become
an "off-campus extra-curricular activity" and
recommended that its committee on courses
abolish credit for ROTC classes.
A week and a half ago the Stanford faculty
Senate voted to deny credit to ROTC classes. And
before the quarter is over, it will also consider
recommending that it should be a "voluntary
student organization."

required off-campus training. It suggested that the
summer ROTC training be expanded to encompass
the training that now takes place on campus.
At that time, the Senate was informed that the
\rmed Forces would not accept the restrictions of
laving ROTC a voluntary extra-curricular activity.
Not wanting to "Off-ROTC," the Senate took
no action on the recommendation. According to
several reports, in the Senate debate few, if any,
Senators even suggested that ROTC should not be
on campus.
A year later, Berkeley faculty has taken an

extraordinary action—especially for a public
institution. And the Stanford faculty may take
similar action. Because the Regents or President of
the University of California can overrule the
faculty, the force of the Berkeley faculty vote was
unclear.
Senate Controls Credit
Here, the faculty Senate can only recommend
that ROTC become a voluntary student
activity—the President and Board of Trustees have
the final power. It does, however, control the
granting of credit for ROTC courses.
Now, the group might favor making ROTC
extra-curricular activity. At their May 7 meeting, it
defeated a motion to consider such action in a
narrow 24 to 21 vote.
Indications are that most of the 21 who wanted
to consider the motion at that time favor making
ROTC a voluntary activity. At least several of

those who voted against considering the motion
merely wanted to put off the decision until they
get new information on ROTC. A motion that
would have put the Senate on record as supporting
ROTC was handily defeated in a voice vote at that
meeting.
Referendum
Many Senators are awaiting the results of a
referendum on ROTC being conducted by the
Advisory Committee. Others want to find out
what is happening at other schools or what can be
done about the punitive clause.
Many Senators think that the situation has
greatly changed in a year and even in recent weeks.
They f ep| that another student referendum might
show tha students now want ROTC off campus.
It is harsh to say that the Senate would vote to
Off ROTC. They ' would be eliminating ROTC
through a maneuver that would make it look like
ROTC could not adapt to the University. Many
Senators sincerely believe that ROTC should have
no favored status—that it should be merely a

voluntary extra-curricular activity. While they
would not say that the military should be singled
out for attack by the University, they will
certainly say that it should not be favored in any
way.
The ASSU Council of Presidents has said, "If
the Defense Department is unwilling to accept
this, then we don't think it is appropriate for the
University to make special arrangements for
ROTC." '
Changes
The Defense Department does not agree with
this reasoning—the Stanford faculty evidently did
not last year; however the Berkeley faculty does
agree.
What has changed in a year? The Berkeley
faculty said it took its action for valid academic
reasons. But the Los Angeles Times reported last
week that the UCLA faculty voted "to eliminate
academic c edit for ROTC until U.S. involvement
ends in Southeast Asia." One has to wonder if the
Berkeley faculty wasn't thinking yesterday along
similar lines.
The large part of Stanford faculty Senate has
changed its mind in a year. Why? The Off-ROTC
movement has had something to do with it.
Senators will say that they will not bow to
violence, but the movement has kept the issue in
the news and in the minds of Senators.
History Professor David Potter has called ROTC
the "whipping boy for the Vietnam War." At a
minimum, the Vietnam War and the American
invasion of Cambodia has made many faculty
members unwilling to support the military.
Several senators have said that after the
invasion of Cambodia has made them feel that
they must now strike out at the closest symbol of
the military—ROTC.
A few years ago ROTC was sale. Most taculty
members felt the University should support the
military in its activities. Now, while some openly
attack the military and say that ROTC should be
"offed" because it is part of that military, many
others are merely now unwilling to favor the
military.
