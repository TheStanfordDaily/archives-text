# Nixon Ignored Asian Experts, Lewis Tells Business Group
## 
### SUSAN MAAS 
"Not a single specialist had any
input into the decision to invade
Cambodia," East Asian expert
John Lewis told a business school
conference in Bishop Auditorium
yesterday.
"The Asian War is being fought
without any relation to the Asian
context," said Lewis, who
travelled to Washington with the
Stanford delegation and discussed
Cambodia with government
officials. Lewis is chairman of the
Stanford East Asian Studies
Center.
About 180 businessmen joined
students and faculty for the one
day conference to discuss critical
contemporary -events and let
businessmen know what students
are doing.
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Albert Hastorf,
economics professor G. Lee Bach
and graduate student Mike
Fehling, head of the political
Action Coordinating Committee
(PACC) discussed effects of the
war on the campus and the
country. The panel was
moderated by Leonard Kingsley,

chairman of the Harvard Business
School Alumni Club of Northern
California.
Not A Necessity
Lewis said that the invasion of
Cambodia was not a necessity in
the technical sense, because the
Viet Cong were moving west into
Cambodia, rather than east into
Vietnam. It was viewed by
supporters as an "opportunity" to
crush opposition in Cambodia,
thus focusing on the long range
issue of Vietnamization, he said.
Yet, Lewis added, "continuing
the fighting is a violation of
Vietnamization."
Lewis commented that the
Communists are willing to stop
the fighting and move into the
political sphere, if the U.S. moves
out of Vietnam.
"Withdrawal at a date certain,"
is the best way, Lewis said.
Society's Nerve
Hastorf and psychology
graduate student Fehling spoke on
"The War and the University."
"The University is the exposed
nerve of society," Hastorf said.
"When we cry out in pain, society

has to take a close look at its
health."
Hastorf spoke of four "moral
pains" in society today: war,
violence, and militarism;
ecological pain; the pain of racism
and poverty; and the nature of
influence and decision-making.
Student Reaction
How students react to this
"pain" was explained by Mike
Fehling. He covered the history of
PACC, discussing some of the
activities that developed at
Stanford, such as Savings Bond
Redemption Day, meetings of
students with policemen, and
Open Campus, designed to make
the University less isolated from
the community.
Bach discussed the economic
problems ending the war might
bring, emphasizing that "we do
not need the Vietnam War to keep
this country prosperous."
If the war were ended, the
country would have some $30-40
billion dollars which it would have
to spend elsewhere- such as on
poverty or pollution-mse to
finance a tax cut, or pay off part
of the national debt, he said.
