## No 21 â€“ Mile Air Limit 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary
of Defense Melvin R. Laird said
Monday U.S. airpower in
Cambodia may not be bound by
the 21-mile limit of American
troop penetration set by President
Nixon.
But he said U.S. troops
probably would not take part in
further incursions of allied forces.

"Are you contemplating going
into any other country with U.S.
Forces?" Sen. J. W. Fulbright,
D-Ark., asked Laird. The secretary
answered no.
In a 4V2 hour session of the
Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Laird and Chairman
Fulbright disputed whether
clearance for "protective
reaction" missions across the
Laotian border violated legislation
which bars spending to put U.S.
troops into Laos or Thailand.
"We are living under the terms
of that amendment," Laird said.
But he said U.S. forces do have
authority to cross briefly into
Laos in a running battle, or on a
rescue mission.
Throughout the session,
Fulbright and other senators
criticized the Cambodian
operation, its effect on the U.S.
economy, campuses, and public
opinion. At one point Fulbright
said to Laird, "You are a master
of obfuscation."

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
Long-haul truck terminals in the
Bay Area and city deliveries
remained shut down Monday due
to picketing by Teamsters Union
members seeking to put pressure
on their Los Angeles employers.
The San Francisco waterfront
was also idle due to lack of trucks
for pickups and deliveries.
San Francisco police got orders
from the mayor's office not to
allow the wildcat pickets to block
private driveways or take any
other illegal action.

A City Hall spokesman said the
situation "has escalated from a
civil issue to a matter concerning
law and order."

CHICAGO (AP) - Herbert G.
Klein, director of communications

military operations in Cambodia a
"story of success" today and said
this would enhance President
Nixon's credibility.
Klein said a report of two
weeks' activities in Cambodia
indicates that U.S. forces have
captured some 8.5 million rounds
of ammunition at enemy bases.
