# Truck Strike Slows 'Daily'
## 
### 
Because of the Teamsters'
wildcat strikes, The I)ail>'s
printers are running short of
paper. For a limited time, the
paper must be printed in page
numbers divisible by four.
Today's paper is a "tight" one
because of advertising
commitments made in advance.
If the strike continues, the
Daily will be able to pring only
for the rest of the week. The Palo
Alto Times has sufficent paper for
two more issues, while the
Chronicle has sufficient supplies
for four more days of publication.
