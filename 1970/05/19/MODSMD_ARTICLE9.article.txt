# ASSU Council Proposal
## A 						University-Wide Senate 
### Barry Askinas Adam Levin 
In this time of crisis and community when at last (why did it have
to take a cataclysm?) students, faculty, administration, staff and
alumni are all talking to one another and occasionally even listening,
we should seriously consider the establishment of a University Senate.
Students have long felt outrage at being excluded from any real
role in decision-making in the University, and this outrage has given
those bent on destroying the University, a much larger audience than
they deserve.
More recently the alumni and now the staff (and we don't mean
the Provost's staff) have been asking for some voice in
decision-making. The time has come for institutionalizing the
Community of (he University and transferring to a University Senate
all the powers of the Academic and Student Senates.
Another lesson of these past weeks and as well from the longer
experience of Academic Senate and Presidential committees, is that
people may differ in their assessment of what is a problem and what
needs to be done about it, but rarely on the basis of membership in
the faculty, student body, or administration. We are simply not all
that different.
We propose the immediate establishment of a Committee of Nine
to study and report back to the President, the Academic Senate, and
the Student Senate on the feasibility, structure, method of
implementation, and powers of a University Senate. The Committee
of Nine should consist of three faculty appointed by the Academic
Senate's Committee on Committees three students appointed by the
ASSU Committee on Nominations, one member appointed by the
President to represent him, one member appointed by the University
Ombudsman from the staff to represent the staff, and one member
appointed by the President of the Alumni Association to represent
alumni. The President's legal advisor should serve as an ex-officio
member to advise on the many legal and procedural subtleties
involved in implementation.
There are many structures which might prove reasonable and
adequate. To be effective, the University Senate must be small. It
must start from the assumption that in largest measure, the faculty
and the students are the University. Yet it must also give voice to the

other segments of the University that have a legitimate claim to be
heard.
We would like to sugfst as a point of departure the following
structure for a University Senate consisting of 62 members:
A. 26 faculty elected by the faculty in their constituencies;
B. 19 students elected by the students in their constituencies;
C. 3 administrators appointed by the President to represent him;
D. 4 administrative staff elected in their constituencies;
E. 5 non-administrative staff elected in their constituencies;
F. 4 alumni elected by the alumni;
G. 1 trustee elected by the trustees.
All University Committees: Academic Senate and Council, ASSU,
Presidential, University, and Ad-hoc Committees would be
restructured and be Committees of and report to the University
Senate. Membership representation by various constituencies would
vary by the area of concern. The experience of the Committee on
Committees of the Academic Senate in rewriting virtually all charges
to committees, this past year, would serve as guidelines for
determining membership on the new University Senate Committees.
