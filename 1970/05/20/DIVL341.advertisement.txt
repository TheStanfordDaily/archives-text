Today s anniversaries are milestones in aviation history.
Forty-three years ago today Charles Lindberg took off from
New York on the first solo flight to Paris. A year ago the
National Guard sprayed the Berkeley campus with tear gas
from a helicopter, another aviation first.
If you should see any mysterious helicopters floating over
campus, why not call our news office at 321-2300 x 4632. If
you want to sell a helicopter (or tear gas, for that matter)
please call our business office at 327-4150 and place an ad.
