The four students arrested
Sunday night for charges resulting
Irom campus disturbances have
been released on bail.
The Legal Defense Fund
reported that one more student
iad been arrested on charges of
battery. They were unable to
provide the name, however, so
this could not be confirmed by
the North County Court House.
Joe Razo, freshman, was
released on $1000 bail. He is
harged with assault with a deadly
weapon and battery.
John Keilch, graduate student
in history, was released on $150
bail. He was booked for malicious
mischief.
Lincoln Edgar was released on
bail. He will be arraigned
May '29 on charges of malicious

mischief.
Janet Weiss, graduate student in
English, was also released. Her
bail, also stemming from a
malicious mischief charge, was
$250. She will be arraigned
Thursday.
Miss Weiss reported that no
dates or details were given to the
defendants beyond the fact that
their arrests were a result of
various actions which have
occurred in the past few weeks at
the Stanford campus. She has
been told that her own arrest was
for breaking a window.
The defendants believe that
most of the arrests result from
charges filed by members of the
Free Campus Movement (FCM).
Miss Weiss reported that she
must also plead on Thursday to

the charge of interfering with a
police officer. This charge results
from the arrest of Mike Sweeney
for painting the word Viet Nam
on a sign. She was served this
warrant two months after the
event, while picketing in a strike
line in Palo Alto.
