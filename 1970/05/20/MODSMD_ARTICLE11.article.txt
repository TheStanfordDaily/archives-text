# America's 'Feudal Castle'
## The 						Myth Of Power 
### Barry Wood 
The advent of civilization
according to informed sources is
supposed to have occurred some
thousands of years ago with the
invention of agriculture, stock
raising, metallurgy, writing, and
settled urban life. This may be so,
but the settled cities have grown
into states and nations who now
preserve their "national identity"
by resorting to the most
uncivilized of human
activities —war. And the Tightness
of war is now rationalized by
resorting to the Myth of Power.
"We are the most powerful
nation in the world "and "we will
not be humiliated," says the
President, looking for all the
world like a Mafia thug who has
crept within camera range. The
Myth of Power is that myth which
Nixon is palming off on the Silent
Majority with such euphemistic
phrases as "we must protect our
brave men in Vietnam." When all
the men are always "brave," of
course, the word means nothing,
and it means nothing anyway
•since they are draftees, not
volunteers.
The Myth of Power boils down
to the Feudal Castle kind of
thinking. Here we sit behind our
moated American walls shouting
"powerful nation," and
conducting little forays among the
jungle peasants to prove it. This
power is backed up by Polaris
subs patrolling the moats,and a
host of ICBM's attackers, cruisers,
supporters, destroyers, and
tactical gadgets, and a growing
arsenal which now runs to many
tons of TNT for every human
being on the planet.
Wearing Thin
The Feudal Castle of America is
not really much different from its
medieval counterpart, except that
it is equipped with loudspeakers
which daily proclaim its power
throughout the surrounding
countryside. The Myth is now
wearing thin, however, since it has
been used by hundreds of
fortified nations in the past, all of
those firepower has been lost
amid the ruins.
But take a close look at the
Castle and the Myth explicates
itself rather well. The floor of the
Castle is steadily rising due to one
million tons of daily garbage
which the tractors can barely
manage to bury. The estuaries are
poisoned, the life support system
is failing, fish and birds are dying,
and reports of isolated deaths by
radioactive exposure and pesticide
poisoning are pouring in. This is
spiced with rising crime and
suicide rates, and mental illness
unparalleled in human history.
Students
Moreover, the educated
students are slowly chipping away
at the walls of the Castle on the
inside—a process that is not
effective in a long run because the

Administration adds a foot or so
of concrete on the outside for
every inch chipped off within.
Moreover, the students cannot
chip too hard because some of the
guns are now pointing inward to
quell the rising tide of unrest and
dissent. Periodic forays are now
almost a daily necessity within the
Castle as campus militants howl
down the Administration.
So the cost of "power" is a
nation which has hypnotized itself
into being the policeman of the
world and can only maintain this
position by becoming a police
state. This, I contend, is a most
insidious procedure for proving
we are the most powerful nation
on earth. But the cost to
humanity, and especially
ourselves, is horrendous. Can we
believe that the Feudal Castle
kind of thinking accomplishes
anything more than the
brutalization of the castle
dwellers? A reading of Machiavelli
makes all this come very clear.
Poor Peasants
The trouble with conducting
forays in Vietnam, Laos, and
Cambodia is that we are failing to
raise a lot of the poor peasants
over which we trample daily.
Moreover, the nagnets embedded
in the Castle walls are pulling in
the base metal resources of the
whole planet at breakneck speed,
along with pipelines which are
drawing off the world's oil and
gasoline. Inside, all this is turning
to garbage and pollution as soon
as we lay our hands on it.
I have often thought we could
end the war in Vietnam most
efficiently if we converted all our
munitions factories into basic
goods plants, and then proceeded
to parachute prefabricated houses,
refrigerators, stoves, and television
sets into the Vietnam countryside,
along with an army of
technologists to put in the roads
and wiring. This would be a vast
improvement over our present
policy of filling the Vietnam
topsoil with spent bullets and
downed aircraft.
Mythical Power
The trouble with such a plan in
the eyes of the Administration is
that it would destroy the Myth of
Power, and most myths, as
religious history shows, refuse to
die. Moreover, it would violate
our economic system which
claims that you can't give away
houses and refrigerators without
economic chaos. Better to have
war chaos somewhere else.
But surely it is clear that the
war is now raging inside the castle
as well as outside. Centers for
Advanced Study are being burned,
windows in our universities are
being broken, and police and
students are alike being brutalized
in mindless attempts to maintain
or smash the Castle walls. Surely

it is clear that this is not
"civilization."
It is obvious that the so-called
power of this nation is a glaze
over the eyes of the
military-industrial technocrats and
it will not last the flames. When
this nation has turned to a dust
heap the greatest civilization will
probably still be ancient Greece
which, for a time, produces a
culture unrivalled anywhere,
certainly not by the plastic and
tinfoil culture which is now beinp
thrown to the Silent Majority as a
sop to rationalize the Myth of
Power.

I have often thought we could
end the war in Vietnam most
efficiently if we converted all our
munitions factories into basic
goods plants, and then proceeded
to parachute prefabricated houses,
refrigerators, stoves, and television
sets into the Vietnam countryside,
along with an army of
technologists to put in the roads
and wiring. This would be a vast
improvement over our present
policy of filling the Vietnam
topsoil with spent bullets and
downed aircraft.
Mythical Power
The trouble with such a plan in
the eyes of the Administration is
that it would destroy the Myth of
Power, and most myths, as
religious history shows, refuse to
die. Moreover, it would violate
our economic system which
claims that you can't give away
houses and refrigerators without
economic chaos. Better to have
war chaos somewhere else.
But surely it is clear that the
war is now raging inside the castle
as well as outside. Centers for
Advanced Study are being burned,
windows in our universities are
being broken, and police and
students are alike being brutalized
in mindless attempts to maintain
or smash the Castle walls. Surely

it is clear that this is not
"civilization."
It is obvious that the so-called
power of this nation is a glaze
over the eyes of the
military-industrial technocrats and
it will not last the flames. When
this nation has turned to a dust
heap the greatest civilization will
probably still be ancient Greece
which, for a time, produces a
culture unrivalled anywhere,
certainly not by the plastic and
tinfoil culture which is now beinp
thrown to the Silent Majority as a
sop to rationalize the Myth of
Power.
(Barry Wood is a graduate
student in English.)
The advent of civilization
according to informed sources is
supposed to have occurred some
thousands of years ago with the
invention of agriculture, stock
raising, metallurgy, writing, and
settled urban life. This may be so,
but the settled cities have grown
into states and nations who now
preserve their "national identity"
by resorting to the most
uncivilized of human
activities —war. And the Tightness
of war is now rationalized by
resorting to the Myth of Power.
"We are the most powerful
nation in the world "and "we will
not be humiliated," says the
President, looking for all the
world like a Mafia thug who has
crept within camera range. The
Myth of Power is that myth which
Nixon is palming off on the Silent
Majority with such euphemistic
phrases as "we must protect our
brave men in Vietnam." When all
the men are always "brave," of
course, the word means nothing,
and it means nothing anyway
•since they are draftees, not
volunteers.
The Myth of Power boils down
to the Feudal Castle kind of
thinking. Here we sit behind our
moated American walls shouting
"powerful nation," and
conducting little forays among the
jungle peasants to prove it. This
power is backed up by Polaris
subs patrolling the moats,and a
host of ICBM's attackers, cruisers,
supporters, destroyers, and
tactical gadgets, and a growing
arsenal which now runs to many
tons of TNT for every human
being on the planet.
Wearing Thin
The Feudal Castle of America is
not really much different from its
medieval counterpart, except that
it is equipped with loudspeakers
which daily proclaim its power
throughout the surrounding
countryside. The Myth is now
wearing thin, however, since it has
been used by hundreds of
fortified nations in the past, all of
those firepower has been lost
amid the ruins.
But take a close look at the
Castle and the Myth explicates
itself rather well. The floor of the
Castle is steadily rising due to one
million tons of daily garbage
which the tractors can barely
manage to bury. The estuaries are
poisoned, the life support system
is failing, fish and birds are dying,
and reports of isolated deaths by
radioactive exposure and pesticide
poisoning are pouring in. This is
spiced with rising crime and
suicide rates, and mental illness
unparalleled in human history.
Students
Moreover, the educated
students are slowly chipping away
at the walls of the Castle on the
inside—a process that is not
effective in a long run because the

Administration adds a foot or so
of concrete on the outside for
every inch chipped off within.
Moreover, the students cannot
chip too hard because some of the
guns are now pointing inward to
quell the rising tide of unrest and
dissent. Periodic forays are now
almost a daily necessity within the
Castle as campus militants howl
down the Administration.
So the cost of "power" is a
nation which has hypnotized itself
into being the policeman of the
world and can only maintain this
position by becoming a police
state. This, I contend, is a most
insidious procedure for proving
we are the most powerful nation
on earth. But the cost to
humanity, and especially
ourselves, is horrendous. Can we
believe that the Feudal Castle
kind of thinking accomplishes
anything more than the
brutalization of the castle
dwellers? A reading of Machiavelli
makes all this come very clear.
Poor Peasants
The trouble with conducting
forays in Vietnam, Laos, and
Cambodia is that we are failing to
raise a lot of the poor peasants
over which we trample daily.
Moreover, the nagnets embedded
in the Castle walls are pulling in
the base metal resources of the
whole planet at breakneck speed,
along with pipelines which are
drawing off the world's oil and
gasoline. Inside, all this is turning
to garbage and pollution as soon
as we lay our hands on it.
I have often thought we could

poisoning are pouring in. This is
spiced with rising crime and
suicide rates, and mental illness
unparalleled in human history.
Students
Moreover, the educated
students are slowly chipping away
at the walls of the Castle on the
inside—a process that is not
effective in a long run because the

Administration adds a foot or so
of concrete on the outside for
every inch chipped off within.
Moreover, the students cannot
chip too hard because some of the
guns are now pointing inward to
quell the rising tide of unrest and
dissent. Periodic forays are now
almost a daily necessity within the
Castle as campus militants howl
down the Administration.
So the cost of "power" is a
nation which has hypnotized itself
into being the policeman of the
world and can only maintain this
position by becoming a police
state. This, I contend, is a most
insidious procedure for proving
we are the most powerful nation
on earth. But the cost to
humanity, and especially
ourselves, is horrendous. Can we
believe that the Feudal Castle
kind of thinking accomplishes
anything more than the
brutalization of the castle
dwellers? A reading of Machiavelli
makes all this come very clear.
Poor Peasants
The trouble with conducting
forays in Vietnam, Laos, and
Cambodia is that we are failing to
raise a lot of the poor peasants
over which we trample daily.
Moreover, the nagnets embedded
in the Castle walls are pulling in
the base metal resources of the
whole planet at breakneck speed,
along with pipelines which are
drawing off the world's oil and
gasoline. Inside, all this is turning
to garbage and pollution as soon
as we lay our hands on it.
I have often thought we could
end the war in Vietnam most
efficiently if we converted all our
munitions factories into basic
goods plants, and then proceeded
to parachute prefabricated houses,
refrigerators, stoves, and television
sets into the Vietnam countryside,
along with an army of
technologists to put in the roads
and wiring. This would be a vast
improvement over our present
policy of filling the Vietnam
topsoil with spent bullets and
downed aircraft.
Mythical Power
The trouble with such a plan in
the eyes of the Administration is
that it would destroy the Myth of
Power, and most myths, as
religious history shows, refuse to
die. Moreover, it would violate
our economic system which
claims that you can't give away
houses and refrigerators without
economic chaos. Better to have
war chaos somewhere else.
But surely it is clear that the
war is now raging inside the castle
as well as outside. Centers for
Advanced Study are being burned,
windows in our universities are
being broken, and police and
students are alike being brutalized
in mindless attempts to maintain
or smash the Castle walls. Surely

it is clear that this is not
"civilization."
It is obvious that the so-called
power of this nation is a glaze
over the eyes of the
military-industrial technocrats and
it will not last the flames. When
this nation has turned to a dust
heap the greatest civilization will
probably still be ancient Greece
which, for a time, produces a
culture unrivalled anywhere,
certainly not by the plastic and
tinfoil culture which is now beinp
thrown to the Silent Majority as a
sop to rationalize the Myth of
Power.
(Barry Wood is a graduate
student in English.)
The advent of civilization
according to informed sources is
supposed to have occurred some
thousands of years ago with the
invention of agriculture, stock
raising, metallurgy, writing, and
settled urban life. This may be so,
but the settled cities have grown
into states and nations who now
preserve their "national identity"
by resorting to the most
uncivilized of human
activities —war. And the Tightness
of war is now rationalized by
resorting to the Myth of Power.
"We are the most powerful
nation in the world "and "we will
not be humiliated," says the
President, looking for all the
world like a Mafia thug who has
crept within camera range. The
Myth of Power is that myth which
Nixon is palming off on the Silent
Majority with such euphemistic
phrases as "we must protect our
brave men in Vietnam." When all
the men are always "brave," of
course, the word means nothing,
and it means nothing anyway
•since they are draftees, not
volunteers.
The Myth of Power boils down
to the Feudal Castle kind of
thinking. Here we sit behind our
moated American walls shouting
"powerful nation," and
conducting little forays among the
jungle peasants to prove it. This
power is backed up by Polaris
subs patrolling the moats,and a
host of ICBM's attackers, cruisers,
supporters, destroyers, and
tactical gadgets, and a growing
arsenal which now runs to many
tons of TNT for every human
being on the planet.
Wearing Thin
The Feudal Castle of America is
not really much different from its
medieval counterpart, except that
it is equipped with loudspeakers
which daily proclaim its power
throughout the surrounding
countryside. The Myth is now
wearing thin, however, since it has
been used by hundreds of
fortified nations in the past, all of
those firepower has been lost
amid the ruins.
But take a close look at the
Castle and the Myth explicates
itself rather well. The floor of the
Castle is steadily rising due to one
million tons of daily garbage
which the tractors can barely
manage to bury. The estuaries are
poisoned, the life support system
is failing, fish and birds are dying,
and reports of isolated deaths by
radioactive exposure and pesticide
poisoning are pouring in. This is
spiced with rising crime and
suicide rates, and mental illness
unparalleled in human history.
