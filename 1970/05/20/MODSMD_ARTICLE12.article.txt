# One Man's Fantasy
## A 						'Shoe' Gets Drunk

Could it have been the sudden revelation that Sherwin-Williams
"covered the earth" with paint approximating the color of blood, and
that the FCM poured the paint?
Or was it the new-found joy of the White Plains, who sang "My
baby loves lovin', my baby loves lovin', she's got what it takes an'she
knows how to use it" until the FCM collapsed in orgasmic delight,
foaming at the mouth?
Disneyland Rip-Off
For $5.75, you can buy a book of fifteen tickets for rides at
Disneyland. There are "A" tickets, "B" tickets, "C" tickets, "D"
tickets, and "E" tickets. The Bank of America has sponsored a ride at
Disneyland. It's called the "It's a Small World" ride You need an "E"
ticket and you don't have to wait. Small wonder: the FCM patrols the
ride with cameras.
My friend Horace went on the "Small World" ride this last
weekend. Little girls sang "It's a Small World" in all the tongues of
the globe â€” translated, the song spelled "Coin," no matter how you
pronounce it, one syllable or two. It was a bad trip for Horace: the
FCMers were singing.
While waiting in line to get into Fantasy-land, i.e., the Los Angeles
outside of Anaheim, Horace and friends were playing monopoly.
Horace chose a little shoe as his board-walker charm, then scooped up
Ventnor Avenues like second hand banana republics.
So last night, after Horace nearly flashed from guzzling too much
Grand Marnier, we all laughed "Hah! the Little Shoe is shit-faced.
Horace awoke with a prodigious hangover.
Earlier, the beef fondue pot burst into flames and nearly blew up
the kitchen. Everything smelled like peanut oil. We flooded the sink
with Lavoris to no avail.
But the man who most need a good mouthwash of carbolic acid,
however, was Walter M. Schirra 111. This junior birdman, son of the
astronaut (wow!), has said nothing publicly about the arrest of Joe
Razo, whom Schirra privately admitted (to none less than Harvey
Hukari) had NOTHING to do with the alleged April 30 assault.
Meanwhile, Razo has $5,000 bail facing him. Schirra was responsible
for the arrest.
Another case of FCM justice: the FCM has sent notices to parents
of students arrested for the sit-in, but uses newspaper clippings to say
that those sitting-in were responsible for the FCM fire. Wonderful
character assassination, Harv, just wonderful.
Well, these are only a few of the many beautiful tortilla chips of
crisp wisdom floating through my mind. I thought you ought to
know.
