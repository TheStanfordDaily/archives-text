Lyman Comment
Editor, The Daily:
In his column on May 18
headed "Resisting the Draft,"
Stewart Burns repeats the charge
made earlier in the quarter that
Stanford administrators "used
their influence to persuade the
judge to exile" Paul Rupert from
Santa Clara County. If Mr. Burns
has any evidence to support this
charge he should bring it forward.
I repeat that to the best of my
knowledge no member of the
Stanford administration had any
contact with the judge in this
case, and no attempt whatever
was made to influence his
decision. My own first intimation
that the "exile" was even a
possibility came when Mr. Rupert
himself came to see me after his
sentencing and informed me of
the sentence.

MECHA Outrage
Editor, The Daily:
We the Chicanos in MECHA
(Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Atzlan) at Stanford are
outraged at the unconcerned,
non-action attitude of "aware"
white people towards the
massacre of six black brothers in
Augusta, Georgia and four
brothers in Jackson, Mississippi.
The combined injury count
numbers near one hundred - one
third the black population in this
Stanford white ghetto. We
recognize this as the white
"business as usual" attitude when
people of color die in the world
struggle for peace. But at Kent
State, with the death of four
white students, the white world
falls apart questioning the
atmosphere of violence that
caused such occurrences. It is the
violent white world that causes
these atrocities and allows them
to continue. It all must stop!
We endorse any action the
black people deem necessary to
alleviate, educate, and/or
annihilate such 'problems.'
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!
The Students of MFC HA
BSU Strike Stand
Editor, The Daily:
The National Association of
Black Students supports the
strike, however, we must realize
that this extension of the war into
Cambodia is only a logical
progression of Americas insane
foreign policy. The peace
movement now has its casualties
just as the civil rights movement
had its casualties. It is clear to us
that when you are for the cause of
humanity and survival this
country strikes back with troops,
guns, tanks, and bombs.
We do not necessarily urge
black students at this time to join
in with white students because the
two groups relate to this country
from different perspectives.
However, on a local level where
there are similar .analyses, that
decision should rest with the
respective black student base.
We encourage black students in
their own way, to strike and take
those actions which will halt the
atrocities and the genocide of
peoples of color.
What is transpiring is indeed an
educational experience.

Congratulations
Editor, The Daily:
At a time when most letters to
the editor are bitter and full ol

hatred, I would like to offer a
letter of congratulations and
praise. I feel that Mr. Dutch
Fehring and his Intramural Staff
(John Ritchey, Gary Garland,
Dave. Schaeffer, Dave Mantooth,
Jay Carrasco, Marc Wilson, and
others) should be highly
congratulated for a job well done
in serving the students of this
university. Few people realize
how hard everyone on the IM
Staff works to assure Stanford
students, who are unable to
participate in varsity sports, of a
chance for good, competitive
participated in extracurricular
activity at Stanford. I am finishing
up my fifth year at Stanford and
have seen the program develop
into a great, well-organized and
well-liked programâ€”these people
are the reasons behind it and
therefore should be
congratulated!

Day of Mourning
Editor, The Daily:
Less than two weeks ago four
students were assassinated on the
campus of Kent State University.
This act caused a spontaneous
outpouring of anger and remorse
from most of the nation's
campuses. These feelings were no
doubt increased by the ability of
students to identify with the
situation in which the killings
took place. The four deaths,
coming upon the President's
decision to spread his radius of
death to new areas turned the rage
of students towards broader issues
of national policy and society's
goals.
This past week two more
students were assassinated on a
campus: this time at Jackson
State. The situation lacked the
broad sunlight and anti-war nature
of the protest at Kent State, but
the deaths should be just as close
to students across this country.
The University is nothing if it is
not its students, and it has
become clear in the past years
that there is a community of
students that transcends college,
local, and state lines. Each student
is a part of the whole and "any
death should diminish each of us
because we are part of mankind."
Therefore, it is fitting and just
that this university take some
action to recogrize the death of
two of the members of its
community. This action must take
the form of a stride towards a new
society, as well as a sign of grief.
Since the President is the titular
head of this community, I call on
him to set aside this Friday
afternoon as a period of

mourning, in which the everyday
activities of the university will
cease, to allow us the opportunity
to stop such crimes from
happening again.

White Revolution?
Editor, The Daily:
The murder of four white
students at Kent State University
is perhaps most significant to
white revolutionaries who hope a
sensitivity to oppression will lead
to revolution.
Whites ought to have a
sensitivity to oppression.
In Augusta and Jackson now,
but also always in Cincinnati,
which I know, where off-duty
policemen have shot to kill black
citizens in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
I don't know whether
revolution can come from shame.
We whites have more right to that
than to a paranoid newfound
feeling of oppression.

Daily Untrustworthy
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to complain about the
presentation of my article on
campus radicalism in the Daily of
May 15th. What was printed was,
with a couple of minor errors,
what I wrote. However,
heavy-handed editing cut the
article in such a way as to
introduce confusion
and inconsistency, change the
meaning of the first part, and
distort the balance of the
argument. Noting a similar
complaint by Leslie Campbell in
the letters section of that same
issue, I conclude that it is
irrational to place much trust in
what one reads in the Daily.

Lewis Jealous
Editor, The Daily:
So-called East Asian expert,
John Lewis, in accusing President
Nixon of ignoring Asian experts
seems merely to be expressing
dissatisfaction because he himself
has not been consulted. If the
statements attributed to him in
yesterday's Daily are accurate, it
is easy to understand why.
Anyone who comments that
the communists are willing to stop
the fighting and move into the
political sphere if the U.S. moves
out of Vietnam is, at best, guilty
of the incredible naivete
demonstrated so often by Linus
Pauling and the late Bertrand
Russell.
Such an individual should not
even qualify as a student in the
East Asian Studies Center, let
alone chairman of it.

Shoch Wrong
Editor, The Dailv :
I feel compelled to reply to
statements about the "economic
causes" of the war made in a full
page advertisement by Jim Shoch
published in the DAILY May 6.
The use of misleading statistics in
that advertisement may otherwise
lead the unwary into unjustified
conclusions.
First, while Mr. Shoch
correctly represents the
magnitude of U.S. private foreign
investment overseas as some $60
billion in recent years, a more
detailed breakdown bv areas

(using date from the Statistical
Abstract of the U.S., 1969)
reveals the true size of business
involvement in the Far East. Of
the $59.2 billion direct U.S.
private investment overseas for
1967, $35.8 billion or 60.4% was
in Europe and Canada. Only $2.5
billion or 4.3% was invested in the
Far East, a geographic area
consisting of far more than
Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos
alone. This figure does represent
an increase over the $2.2 billion
of 1966, but the amount is still
small in relation to investments in
more developed regions.
Second, while it is true that
Southeast Asia supplies large
amounts of the world's natural
rubber and tin, U.S. industry's
consumption patterns do not
indicate dependence on these
sources. Imports of tin ore to the
U.S. in 1968 (as found in the

1969 Commodity Yearbook) were
2,808 long tons, 2,791 tons of
which were supplied by Bolivia.
Imports of processed metal
show that 41,325 of the 57,358
long tons were supplied from
Malaysia. U.S. consumption of
natural rubber in 1968 was 575
thousand long tons while 1,893
thousand tons were synthetic
rubber. Of the 2.5 million loi.g
tons of natural rubber produced
in 1968, 1.8 million tons were
produced in Malaysia and
Indoesia, two Southeast Asian
countries not generally considered
part of the war zone.
Mr. Shoch's statistics, while
true as far as they go, do not,
upon more detailed analysis,
support the contention of an
Imperialist war in Southeast Asia.
