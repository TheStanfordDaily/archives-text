## How To Bodycount 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTONâ€”One of the things that constantly impresses
people in Washington is the accuracy of the body counts in Indochina.
No part of the war has been handled with as much scientific accuracy
as enemy body counting, and we know to the last Commie aggressor
how many Viet Cong have been killed each day.
The Office of Enemy Body Counts is located at the Pentagon and
has a staff of 23,678 people. The director of OEBC is a civilian named
Hammersmith Moody, who could safely be called the "father of
enemy body counting."
"When the war first started," Moody said, "body counting was a hit
or miss proposition. Our boys would go into an area, shoot up the
place, burn down the village and then phone in a figure of enemy
killed to Saigon. This figure was arrived at by questioning each GI
who was in on the operation and asking him, 'How many gooks did
you get?'

"Now, almost every outfit in Vietnam had soldiers from Texas in it,
and no matter what the other Gl's said, the Texans would insist they
got more. So everyone kept escalating the figures and pretty soon
there was some question as to how accurate the count was. To further
complicate matters, the South Vietnamese troops found out the
easiest way to please the American high command in Saigon was to
hand in high enemy body counts.
"The more enemy the ARVN commander could report dead, the
more equipment, medals and promotions he could get for himself and
his outfit, and pretty soon South Vietnamese officers were flooding
Saigon with exaggerated body count statistics."
"There doesn't seem anything wrong with that," I said. "After all,
no one got hurt."
Pentagon Figures
"True," Moody said. "The complication arose, though, when these
figures were reported to the Pentagon and released to the public. At
the rate we were reporting enemy deaths, we would have run out of
anyone to kill in the first 16 months of the war. How could we justify
our staying in Vietnam after we had reported that everyone in North
Vietnam was already dead?"
"It isn't easy," I admitted.
"So I was asked to develop a new body count system which would
make it possible to prove that we are beating the Communists, at the
same time guaranteeing there were enough left to make us keep our
commitment."
"How did you do it?"
Divide The Counts
"We took all the counts submitted by the various units and divided
by six.
"But even this figure was too high to announce every day, so we set
up what could be called an enemy body count bank. Now when things
are going bad and the press and public are getting restless, we release
figures from the bank which will prove how well we're doing in
Vietnam."
"Are you doing the same thing in Cambodia?" I asked.
"The emphasis in Cambodia has been on supplies rather than
bodies, but we're still getting very high reports from the field. If we
can report 10 enemy dead for every ton of rice seized, well be very
satisfied."
"Don't you have a recognition problem in Cambodia? How do you
know when you see a Cambodian or North Vietnamese body that it
belonged to the enemy?"
Moody replied, "Through dental charts."
