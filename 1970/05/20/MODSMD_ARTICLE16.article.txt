# Cal Votes No Credit
## 
### 
The Academic Senate of the
University of California in
Berkeley voted Monday to remove
all credit from ROTC. However,
the Senate also passed a resolution
permitting ROTC to remain on
campus as an extra-curricular
activity.
Despite warnings from some
professors that a confrontation
with the Board of Regents might
result in the Senate losing its
traditional power to withhold
credit from any given course, the
motion to deny ROTC credit was
passed 335-76. There were eight
abstentions.
The adopted resolution
declared: "These (ROTC
departments) have no programs
leading to degrees and do not
foster scholarly research.
Less Freedom
"These departments have less
freedom from external control in
determining the structure,
content, and supervision of their
courses and curricula than is
tolerable in a university. The
contracts required of students
subject them to potential
intimidation in ways which are

inconsistent with the freedom of
choice indispensable to a
university."
The Senate then approved a
second resolution, 236-31, which
declared that ROTC should
remain on the Berkeley campus as
an extra-curricular activity.
However, it also recommended
that military training for students,
such as drill, would be held
off-campus.
Clash Feared
Fear of a clash between the
Senate and the Board of Regents
was heightened by remarks make
by Berkeley Chancellor Roger W.
Heyns after the meeting. "This is
finally a Regents' decision,"
Heyns stated, noting that only the
Board of Regents possesses the
power to make or terminate
contracts with the Armed Forces.
Earlier in the day, more than
300 persons, mostly students,
deliberately paraded to an illegal
microphone at a rally, and risked
disciplinary action by implicating
themselves with five students
cited by UC for anti-war activity.
The Daily Californian revealed
that Black Students Union

members Jim Nabors and Jon
Turner; Dan Siegel, suspended
student body president; and
activists Conn Hallinan, of the
teaching assistants' union, and
Reese Erlich were cited for rallies
staged luring the past two weeks.

A legal rally ended at about
1:00 p.m. with UC police sergeant
Patrick Casey ordering the
university sound system turned
off in accordance with UC
regulations. But the Associated
Students and the Strike
Committee quicklv set up an
alternative system and urged
persons to take the microphone to
show their support of the five
students, cited for violating time,
place, and manner regulations.
At the legal noon rally, Jerry
Barenholtz of the Strike
Committee accused the
administration of "attempting to
end the days of peaceful and
constructive activity."

Students and the Strike
Committee quicklv set up an

show their support of the five
students, cited for violating time,

The Academic Senate of the
University of California in
Berkeley voted Monday to remove
all credit from ROTC. However,
the Senate also passed a resolution
permitting ROTC to remain on
campus as an extra-curricular
activity.
Despite warnings from some
professors that a confrontation
with the Board of Regents might
result in the Senate losing its
traditional power to withhold
credit from any given course, the
motion to deny ROTC credit was
passed 335-76. There were eight
abstentions.
The adopted resolution
declared: "These (ROTC
departments) have no programs
leading to degrees and do not
foster scholarly research.
Less Freedom
"These departments have less
freedom from external control in
determining the structure,
content, and supervision of their
courses and curricula than is
tolerable in a university. The
contracts required of students
subject them to potential
intimidation in ways which are

inconsistent with the freedom of
choice indispensable to a
university."
The Senate then approved a
second resolution, 236-31, which
declared that ROTC should
remain on the Berkeley campus as
an extra-curricular activity.
However, it also recommended
that military training for students,
such as drill, would be held
off-campus.
Clash Feared
Fear of a clash between the
Senate and the Board of Regents
was heightened by remarks make
by Berkeley Chancellor Roger W.
Heyns after the meeting. "This is
finally a Regents' decision,"
Heyns stated, noting that only the
Board of Regents possesses the
power to make or terminate
contracts with the Armed Forces.
Earlier in the day, more than
300 persons, mostly students,
deliberately paraded to an illegal
microphone at a rally, and risked
disciplinary action by implicating
themselves with five students
cited by UC for anti-war activity.
The Daily Californian revealed
that Black Students Union

members Jim Nabors and Jon
Turner; Dan Siegel, suspended
student body president; and
activists Conn Hallinan, of the
teaching assistants' union, and
Reese Erlich were cited for rallies
staged luring the past two weeks.
Open Mike
A legal rally ended at about
1:00 p.m. with UC police sergeant
Patrick Casey ordering the
university sound system turned
