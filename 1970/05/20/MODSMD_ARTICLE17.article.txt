# SLAC Head Blasts Safeguard System

### 
Nuclear weapons expert
Wolfgang Panofsky told the
Senate Armed Services Committee
yesterday that even the Defense
Department (DOD) is beginning
to realize its multi-billion-dollar
Safeguard ABM system offers
only dubious protection against
Soviet or Chinese missiles.
Prof. Panofsky, who directs the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center '(SLAC) is a former
nuclear testban negotiator. He has
long been an outspoken foe of
President Nixon's plan to go
ahead with Safeguard ABM
expansion. His testimony was
presented as as individual.
"Downward revisions by DOD
witnesses of Safeguard
effectiveness and the requests for
new development programs are an
admission of the validity of the
technical criticisms voiced last
year," Panofsky told the
committee.
"Witnesses opposing Safeguard
deployment maintained that a
more effective and less expensive
way to defend Minuteman (ABM)
silos) would clearly be a system
which employed smaller radars
rather than a large, vulnerable
one."
(They had testified, he said,
that Safeguard defense of
Minuteman depends on a single,
very expensive radar costing
around $200 million for each
Minuteman complex, and on a
very small, still classified number
of Spring missiles to protect the
Minuteman silos and the radar. If
the radar malfunctioned or was
destroyed, the whole system
would collapse.)
"The Defense Department now
recognizes belatedly that any
hope of a reasonable effective of
Minuteman would require the
development and deployment of a
system of defense against
incoming missiles which is
specifically 'dedicated' to defense
of hardened Minuteman silos,
rather than being general purpose
development such as the
Safeguard adaptation of the
former Sentinel and NIKE-S
system which were primarily
designed as city defense ABM
systems.
"Even if Safeguard functions
perfectly it offers significant
protection to Minuteman only
over narrow band of threats. If
the threat continues to grow as
rapidly as it is at present,
Safeguard is obsolete before
deployed. If the threat levels off,
Safeguard is not needed."
Selective Declassification
Panofsky sharply criticised
DOD for "selective
declassification of information
about old Soviet military systems
to make it appear to the American
public that we are suddenly facing
new Soviet threats.

"Why should the Safeguard
decision be influenced by 'new'
information on a Soviet radar
system which has been known for
many years, which is undefended
and is by its very nature
extremely, vulnerable to attack?
"Why should we be persuaded
to expand Safeguard deployment
by recently released old
photographs of 'streaks in the sky'
of Soviet SS-9 missiles when there
is now general agreement among
recent technicail reviewers that
Safeguard is much less effective
and more costly than other
methods of protecting our
deterremt (missiles) which might
be threatened by the SS-9?
Persistant Pressure
"What disturbs me most,"
Panofsky continued, "is the
persistent pressure exerted to
expand Safeguard by raising
increased fears of new Soviet
moves and threats, without in any
way demonstrating that the
Safeguard system as designed is
effective against, or even related
to, these threats.
"Estimates of a Chinese ICBM
threat have been slipping further
into the future. Recently the
Chinese launched a small satellite,
as the Japanese, who do not have
a s bstantial military
establishment, have done before
them.
"The power to launch this
satellite is well below that
required for an ICBM to carry a
thermonuclear warhead to the
U.S.; therefore this event bears no
relation to a prediction for a
likely date for the emergence of a
Chinese ICBM capability.
China 'Minor Threat'
"Why then does anyone
maintain that we need defense of
our cities against a very minor
ICBM threat perhaps 10 years
from now, when the President and
DOD witnesses have stated
explicitly that defense of our
cities against the superior ICBM
power of the Soviet Union should
not be pursued?
"Technology does not permit
creating an ABM system which
can provide a reliable umbrella
over the U.S. against even the
light Chinese ICBM attacks which
might appear possible in the late
70's," he said flatly.
"In the long run agreed
limitation of arms rather than
continued striving for military
superiority has to be our hope for
preserving the real security of this
country and the world," asserted
the Stanford physicist.
Hurts Research
Panofsky also referred to the
possibility of Safeguard expansion
causing further cutbacks in
research funds. He reminded the
senators of recent remarks by
John Foster, the Pentagon's chief
scientist, who "raised the spectre
of a threat to U.S. technological
superiority" and urged more
active research and development
programs.
"I share some of Dr. Foster's
concerns in this respect," said
Panofsky, "although I am highly
critical of some of the recent
cutbacks in basic and applied
research spending. I believe such
shortsighted actions will do more
damage to the long-range
creativity of this country, and in a
broader sense to its security, than
some of the claimed deficiencies
in weapons,
