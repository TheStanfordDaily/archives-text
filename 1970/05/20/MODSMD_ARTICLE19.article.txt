# Anonymous Letters Link Old Union Busts To Fire
## 
### 
Several of the students arrested
during the night of the first Old
Union sit-in report that their
parents have received anonymous
crank letters.
These letters consist of a single
xeroxed sheet paper on which two
newspaper articles have been run
together to appear as one. The top
of the "article" is a description of
the burning of the Behavioral
Sciences building; the bottom
consists of a list of those people
arrested at the Old Union. It thus
appears that these people were
arrested for arson.
The name of the son or
daughter has been circled in red.
Written on the margin is the
comment, "Is this why you send
your son (daughter) to college?
$500,000 in fire damage;
$100,000 in broken windows!"
The letters do not carry a
return address, but they do bear a
Stanford post-mark. The
handwriting was described by one
defendant as "feminine."
The students involved are both
angered and upset by the letters.
"This was malicious and
misleading," commented Anne
Denton, one of those arrested.
The defendants all seem to
believe that the letters were sent
by members of the Free Campus
Movement. "Who else would do
it?" asked one.
However, Chris Hocker,
member of the FCM, stated,
"Frankly, I can't think of anyone
in our organization who would
bother to take the time to mail it
to all those people."

Several law students contacted
said they thought that perhaps a
suit could be filed on grounds of
slander and defamation of
character. The sender of the letter
would, however, first have to be
identified.
