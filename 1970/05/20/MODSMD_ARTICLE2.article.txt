# ROTC Poll Draws Attack
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Questionnaires concerning
ROTC's future are being mailed to
every registered student and
teaching staff member by the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs.
But the "ROTC 44," those
charged by the SJC in the ROTC
Building blockade, have already
launched an attack on the survey's
wording as "incredibly biased."
They claim hypothetical options
for ROTC's futures will confuse
voters and have urged a write-in
vote for wording they approve.
The Academic Senate's May 7
meeting had asked the ROTC
committee to study campus
opinion on ROTC in preparing a
June 1 report on the military
training program's future.
The 13-question survey was
scheduled to be mailed out by
midnight last night. The
committee will first tabulate those
results postmarked by midnight,
Monday, May 25. But no final
deadline has been set for returning
the surveys, and results will
probably be held until the June 1
report to the Senate.
Survey questions were prepared
by a subcommittee consulting
with Prof. J. Victor Bladridge, an
Assistant Professor of Education
and Sociology, and were revised
and approved by the entire ROTC
advisory committee.
Choices Offered
The "Role of ROTC" question,
number VIII, poses what
Baldridge emphasized were four
"hypothetical" choices. They are:
A) keeping ROTC with credit; B)
allowing ROTC to remain, but
without academic credit; C) not
allowing ROTC "EXCEPT as a
'voluntary student organization';"
and E) no opinion.
Respondents were asked to
check the option "which most
nearly represents your view." But
the "ROTC 44" claim
explanatory "comments" under
each option are slanted and leave
no acceptable choice for those
opposed to any formal ROTC
activities on campus.
They have asked students and
faculty to write in a vote in the
left-hand margin of the survey:
"(F) No organized military
training at Stanford." (Their
arguments appear on page 2 of
today's DAILY.)
Prof. Baldridge confirmed the
write-in votes would be tabulated.
In addition to the major
question on ROTC's future, the
survey asks for demographic facts
such as the respondent's sex;
military, and draft status; and the

student's class or whether the
responding teacher is a member of
the Academic Council.
Other questions include: what
should be done about current
ROTC cadets if ROTC course
credit is ended, what stand the
university should take on the
ROTC "punitive clause," and a
page for general comments.
The controversy over Question
VIII centers on the option of
ROTC as a "voluntary
organization." The explanatory
note hypothesizes a situation in
which "ROTC would only have
the same unofficial status as other
voluntary groups, such as the
SDS, the Young Republicans, and
the DAILY."
Prof. Baldridge suggested
respondents should vote for that
option only if they would actually
approve of continuing ROTC
under that hypothetical situation.
Political Motives
But the "ROTC 44" fear
people will support that option as
a political maneuver with the
hidden motive of completely
eliminating ROTC. Provost
Richard Lyman said he believes it
is "99 and 44/100 percent"
certain that ROTC would decide
to leave campus if only allowed as
a "voluntary organization."
Lyman commented, "I have to
think that anyone who votes in
favor of maintaining ROTC as a
student voluntary organization is
really voting not to maintain
ROTC at all."
But the protestors object that
ROTC might instead decide to
stay on campus under a
"voluntary organization" option.
One administrator conceded there
is a very slight possibility ROTC
may make such an unprecedented
move in order to stay involved in
"prestige universities" such as
Stanford.
Thus, it may not be clear
whether those voting for the
"voluntary organization" option
will have the motive of " offing
ROTC" or keeping it as a
voluntary activity.
The "ROTC 44" also object to
the wording of the questionnaire
option completely eliminating
ROTC. It is followed by the
comment: "Many people believe
that this could set a precedent for
the removal of other 'voluntary
organizations.' Other people insist
no suh precedent wruld be such
Even with the emark that
there are two sides io the issue,
"Off ROTC" supporters say the
comment is biased by the
"insidious and irresponsible
innuendo" that "offing ROTC"
could set a dangerous precedent.

Provost Lyman agreed that, "If
you want to vote to off ROTC, I
don't see what you can vote for,
because if one votes for "D", one
is (being warned) one might be
violating the rights of other
student organizations; and if you
vote for "C", it is not made clear
that you'll probably be voting for
an end to ROTC on campus."
The "ROTC 44", in urging
write-in wording, insists ROTC
can be completely eliminated as a
formal organization without any
risk of setting a precedent for
future banning of SDS, FCM, or
other groups.
They say ROTC can be
eliminated under current
definitions of a "voluntary
organization" which demand that
any such group have "purposes
and procedures not inconsistent
with the goals of the university."
They argue military training
violates such goals.
The Dean of Students office
evaluates all voluntary
organization applications. Other
current requirements which might
be difficult for ROTC to meet
include depositing funds with the
ASSU treasury and membership
open to all of the Stanford
community.
New Policy Possible
To compound the confusion,
President Pitzer's Committee on
Student Services is now debating a
new general policy on "voluntary
organizations" to submit for
Pitzer's approval. Committee
members said that anti-ROTC
student members are advocating
new requirements which would
insure that ROTC operation
would be impossible as a
"voluntary organization," while
pro-ROTC committee members
are pushing for a policy
facilitating ROTC operation.
In spite of the controversy over
the questionnaire, Prof. Baldridge
believes the results will provide
valid information on community
opinion.
He said that both left and
right-jwing students "were
attacking technical points (of the
survey) to gain political ends."
"We simply cannot respond to
every criticism," he added. "Our
Law Professor Keith Mann,
chairman of the ROTC advisory
committee, issued this statement:
"Given the difficulties of
constructing a poll and the time
constraints under which the
sub-committee and the committee
have had to work, I view this poll
something like Johnson's analogy
to 'a dog's walking on his hinder
legs. It is not done well; but you
are surprised to find it done at
all."

move in order to stay involved in
"prestige universities" such as
Stanford.
Thus, it may not be clear
whether those voting for the
"voluntary organization" option
will have the motive of " offing
ROTC" or keeping it as a
voluntary activity.
The "ROTC 44" also object to
the wording of the questionnaire
option completely eliminating
ROTC. It is followed by the
comment: "Many people believe
that this could set a precedent for
the removal of other 'voluntary
organizations.' Other people insist
no suh precedent wruld be such
Even with the emark that
there are two sides io the issue,
"Off ROTC" supporters say the
comment is biased by the
"insidious and irresponsible
innuendo" that "offing ROTC"
could set a dangerous precedent.

Provost Lyman agreed that, "If
you want to vote to off ROTC, I
don't see what you can vote for,
because if one votes for "D", one
is (being warned) one might be
violating the rights of other
student organizations; and if you
vote for "C", it is not made clear
that you'll probably be voting for
an end to ROTC on campus."
The "ROTC 44", in urging
write-in wording, insists ROTC
can be completely eliminated as a
formal organization without any
risk of setting a precedent for
future banning of SDS, FCM, or
other groups.
They say ROTC can be
eliminated under current
definitions of a "voluntary
organization" which demand that
any such group have "purposes
and procedures not inconsistent
with the goals of the university."
They argue military training
violates such goals.
The Dean of Students office
evaluates all voluntary
organization applications. Other
current requirements which might
be difficult for ROTC to meet
include depositing funds with the
ASSU treasury and membership
open to all of the Stanford
community.
New Policy Possible
To compound the confusion,
President Pitzer's Committee on
Student Services is now debating a
new general policy on "voluntary
organizations" to submit for
Pitzer's approval. Committee
members said that anti-ROTC
student members are advocating
new requirements which would
insure that ROTC operation
would be impossible as a
"voluntary organization," while
pro-ROTC committee members
are pushing for a policy
facilitating ROTC operation.
In spite of the controversy over
the questionnaire, Prof. Baldridge
believes the results will provide
valid information on community
opinion.
He said that both left and
right-jwing students "were
attacking technical points (of the
survey) to gain political ends."
"We simply cannot respond to
every criticism," he added. "Our
Law Professor Keith Mann,
chairman of the ROTC advisory
committee, issued this statement:
"Given the difficulties of
constructing a poll and the time
constraints under which the
sub-committee and the committee
have had to work, I view this poll
something like Johnson's analogy
to 'a dog's walking on his hinder
legs. It is not done well; but you
are surprised to find it done at
all."
Questionnaires concerning
ROTC's future are being mailed to
every registered student and
teaching staff member by the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs.
But the "ROTC 44," those
charged by the SJC in the ROTC
Building blockade, have already
launched an attack on the survey's
wording as "incredibly biased."
They claim hypothetical options
for ROTC's futures will confuse
voters and have urged a write-in
vote for wording they approve.
The Academic Senate's May 7
meeting had asked the ROTC
committee to study campus
opinion on ROTC in preparing a
June 1 report on the military
training program's future.
The 13-question survey was
scheduled to be mailed out by
midnight last night. The
committee will first tabulate those
results postmarked by midnight,
Monday, May 25. But no final
deadline has been set for returning
the surveys, and results will
probably be held until the June 1
report to the Senate.
Survey questions were prepared
by a subcommittee consulting
with Prof. J. Victor Bladridge, an
Assistant Professor of Education
and Sociology, and were revised
and approved by the entire ROTC
advisory committee.
Choices Offered
The "Role of ROTC" question,
number VIII, poses what
Baldridge emphasized were four
"hypothetical" choices. They are:
A) keeping ROTC with credit; B)
allowing ROTC to remain, but
without academic credit; C) not
allowing ROTC "EXCEPT as a
'voluntary student organization';"
and E) no opinion.
Respondents were asked to
check the option "which most
nearly represents your view." But
the "ROTC 44" claim
explanatory "comments" under
each option are slanted and leave
no acceptable choice for those
opposed to any formal ROTC
activities on campus.
They have asked students and
faculty to write in a vote in the
left-hand margin of the survey:
"(F) No organized military
training at Stanford." (Their
arguments appear on page 2 of
today's DAILY.)
Prof. Baldridge confirmed the
write-in votes would be tabulated.
In addition to the major
question on ROTC's future, the
survey asks for demographic facts
such as the respondent's sex;
military, and draft status; and the

student's class or whether the
responding teacher is a member of
the Academic Council.
Other questions include: what
should be done about current
ROTC cadets if ROTC course
credit is ended, what stand the
university should take on the
ROTC "punitive clause," and a
page for general comments.
The controversy over Question
VIII centers on the option of
ROTC as a "voluntary
organization." The explanatory
note hypothesizes a situation in
which "ROTC would only have
the same unofficial status as other
voluntary groups, such as the
SDS, the Young Republicans, and
the DAILY."
Prof. Baldridge suggested
respondents should vote for that
option only if they would actually
approve of continuing ROTC
under that hypothetical situation.
Political Motives
But the "ROTC 44" fear
people will support that option as
a political maneuver with the
hidden motive of completely
eliminating ROTC. Provost
Richard Lyman said he believes it
is "99 and 44/100 percent"
certain that ROTC would decide
to leave campus if only allowed as
a "voluntary organization."
Lyman commented, "I have to
think that anyone who votes in
favor of maintaining ROTC as a
student voluntary organization is
really voting not to maintain
ROTC at all."
But the protestors object that
ROTC might instead decide to
stay on campus under a
"voluntary organization" option.
One administrator conceded there
is a very slight possibility ROTC
may make such an unprecedented
move in order to stay involved in
"prestige universities" such as

scheduled to be mailed out by
midnight last night. The
committee will first tabulate those
results postmarked by midnight,
Monday, May 25. But no final
deadline has been set for returning
the surveys, and results will
probably be held until the June 1
report to the Senate.
Survey questions were prepared
by a subcommittee consulting
with Prof. J. Victor Bladridge, an
Assistant Professor of Education
and Sociology, and were revised
and approved by the entire ROTC
advisory committee.
Choices Offered
The "Role of ROTC" question,
number VIII, poses what
Baldridge emphasized were four
"hypothetical" choices. They are:
A) keeping ROTC with credit; B)
allowing ROTC to remain, but
without academic credit; C) not
allowing ROTC "EXCEPT as a
'voluntary student organization';"
and E) no opinion.
Respondents were asked to
check the option "which most
nearly represents your view." But
the "ROTC 44" claim
explanatory "comments" under
each option are slanted and leave
no acceptable choice for those
opposed to any formal ROTC
activities on campus.
They have asked students and
faculty to write in a vote in the
left-hand margin of the survey:
"(F) No organized military
training at Stanford." (Their
arguments appear on page 2 of
today's DAILY.)
Prof. Baldridge confirmed the
write-in votes would be tabulated.
In addition to the major
question on ROTC's future, the
survey asks for demographic facts
such as the respondent's sex;
military, and draft status; and the

student's class or whether the
responding teacher is a member of
the Academic Council.
Other questions include: what
should be done about current
ROTC cadets if ROTC course
credit is ended, what stand the
university should take on the
ROTC "punitive clause," and a
page for general comments.
The controversy over Question
VIII centers on the option of
ROTC as a "voluntary
organization." The explanatory
note hypothesizes a situation in
which "ROTC would only have
the same unofficial status as other
voluntary groups, such as the
SDS, the Young Republicans, and
the DAILY."
Prof. Baldridge suggested
respondents should vote for that
option only if they would actually
approve of continuing ROTC
under that hypothetical situation.
Political Motives
But the "ROTC 44" fear
people will support that option as
a political maneuver with the
hidden motive of completely
eliminating ROTC. Provost
Richard Lyman said he believes it
is "99 and 44/100 percent"
certain that ROTC would decide
to leave campus if only allowed as
a "voluntary organization."
Lyman commented, "I have to
think that anyone who votes in
favor of maintaining ROTC as a
student voluntary organization is
really voting not to maintain
ROTC at all."
But the protestors object that
ROTC might instead decide to
stay on campus under a
"voluntary organization" option.
One administrator conceded there
is a very slight possibility ROTC
may make such an unprecedented
move in order to stay involved in
"prestige universities" such as
Stanford.
Thus, it may not be clear
whether those voting for the
"voluntary organization" option
will have the motive of " offing
ROTC" or keeping it as a
voluntary activity.
The "ROTC 44" also object to
the wording of the questionnaire
option completely eliminating
ROTC. It is followed by the
comment: "Many people believe
that this could set a precedent for
the removal of other 'voluntary
organizations.' Other people insist
no suh precedent wruld be such
Even with the emark that
there are two sides io the issue,
"Off ROTC" supporters say the
comment is biased by the
"insidious and irresponsible
innuendo" that "offing ROTC"
could set a dangerous precedent.

Provost Lyman agreed that, "If
you want to vote to off ROTC, I
don't see what you can vote for,
because if one votes for "D", one
is (being warned) one might be
violating the rights of other
student organizations; and if you
vote for "C", it is not made clear
that you'll probably be voting for
an end to ROTC on campus."
The "ROTC 44", in urging
write-in wording, insists ROTC
can be completely eliminated as a
formal organization without any
risk of setting a precedent for
future banning of SDS, FCM, or
other groups.
They say ROTC can be
eliminated under current
definitions of a "voluntary
organization" which demand that
any such group have "purposes
and procedures not inconsistent
with the goals of the university."
They argue military training
violates such goals.
The Dean of Students office
evaluates all voluntary
organization applications. Other
current requirements which might
be difficult for ROTC to meet
include depositing funds with the
ASSU treasury and membership
open to all of the Stanford
community.
New Policy Possible
To compound the confusion,
President Pitzer's Committee on
Student Services is now debating a
new general policy on "voluntary
organizations" to submit for
Pitzer's approval. Committee
members said that anti-ROTC
student members are advocating
new requirements which would
insure that ROTC operation
would be impossible as a
"voluntary organization," while
pro-ROTC committee members
are pushing for a policy
facilitating ROTC operation.
In spite of the controversy over
the questionnaire, Prof. Baldridge
believes the results will provide
valid information on community
opinion.
He said that both left and
right-jwing students "were
attacking technical points (of the
survey) to gain political ends."
"We simply cannot respond to
every criticism," he added. "Our
Law Professor Keith Mann,
chairman of the ROTC advisory
committee, issued this statement:
"Given the difficulties of
constructing a poll and the time
constraints under which the
sub-committee and the committee
have had to work, I view this poll
something like Johnson's analogy
to 'a dog's walking on his hinder
legs. It is not done well; but you
are surprised to find it done at
all."
Questionnaires concerning
ROTC's future are being mailed to
every registered student and
teaching staff member by the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC Affairs.
But the "ROTC 44," those
charged by the SJC in the ROTC
Building blockade, have already
launched an attack on the survey's
wording as "incredibly biased."
They claim hypothetical options
for ROTC's futures will confuse
voters and have urged a write-in
vote for wording they approve.

committee to study campus
