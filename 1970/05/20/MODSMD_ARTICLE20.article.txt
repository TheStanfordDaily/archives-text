# New Psychiatric Ward For Hospital
## 
### 
STANFORD-Stanford
University Hospital last week
announced the opening of a new
20-bed psychiatric unit in the
Herbert Hoover Pavilion, the
hospital's annex on the corner of
Palm Drive and El Camino Real.
The opening climaxes an
eight-month, $328,000 renovation
job of a 6,000 sq. ft. area on the
ground floor, formerly housing
laundry facilities, and an 8,000 sq.
ft. outdoor patio and recreation
area.
The new unit, which operates
on the concept of an open
Therapeutic Community, will make
free space in the main Medical
Center for an additional 1 5 adult
medical and surgical beds,
according to Dr. Thomas A.
Gonda, director of the hospital.
Dr. George D. Gulevich,

assistant professor of psychiatry
and director of the Therapeutic
Community, said the "unit is
designed to create an atmosphere
that promotes a sense of
community life in a homelike
setting."
A lounge area, decorated with
comfortable living room type
furnishings, is the core of the unit
with pleasant sleeping quarters
around it.
Kitchen and laundry facilities,
interview rooms, and group and
occupational therapy areas are
other improved features. A nicely
landscaped patio area outside the
unit provides a site for
recreational activities.
"The Therapeutic Community
is an open unit where a smail
group of people help each other
learn, change and grow," Dr.
Gulevich said. "It is designed,
both in governing philosophy and
physical facilities, as a small-scale
representation of the society from
which its members come with
similar responsibilities and
opportunities. In such a setting,
many kinds of therapy can be
undertaken and the doctor-patient
relationship can be broadened."
The therapy program, Dr.
Gulevich added, is short term and
designed to help patients resume
social living outside the hospital as
soon as possible.
The unit was designed by
Stone, Marraccini, and Patterson,
and work was done by Welch
Construction, Inc. of Menlo Park.
Hoover Pavilion, which houses
the new psychiatric unit, has
served thousands of Peninsulans
for four decades. In 1965, it was
remodeled by the City of Palo
Alto at the cost of $1.3 million
and reopened as part of the Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital, then
jointly owned by the City and
Stanford University. In 1968, the
City sold its hospital holdings to
the University, and Hoover
Pavilion became part of the
medical complex renamed
Stanford University Medical
Center.
