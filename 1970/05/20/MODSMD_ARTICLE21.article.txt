# Palo Alto City Council Takes No Stand On War
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council
declined Monday night to take a
collective stand on the war
situation in Southeast Asia.
In a long, emotion-charged but
orderly meeting the council voted
to stay with individual expressions
on the war rather than attempting
to speak for the entire
community. The action passed by
a 5 to 4 vote with two members
abstaining.
Similar stands were taken by
the Palo Alto Unified School
District Board of Trustees and the
San Mateo City Council, who
both refused to adopt anti-war
resolutions.
The Palo Alto Times reported
that several council members of
Palo Alto who voted against
taking a collective stand said they
opposed the current military
position in Vietnam and

Indochina.
The paper reported that about
350 people including about 250
school aged individuals and about
100 adults, some of them openly
unsympathetic to the war
resolution idea, were jammed to
overflowing in the council
chambers.
Palo Alto school district
trustees refused to take a stand
against the war as requested by a
group called the Palo Alto
Teachers for Peace. Board
members felt that such a
resolution had no connection with
education.
Trustee Bernard Oliver said
such a move would be "very
unwise by the board" but that
each member could act as an
individual any way he wished,
according to the Times.
Two resolutions presented
before the San Mateo City
Council - one endorsing the cutoff
of funds for Vietnam fighting and
the second favoring withdrawal of
U.S. troops from Vietnam - died
for lack of a second.
A motion that the council
consider matters of foreign policy
beyond its scope was defeated 3
to 2.
The Palo Alto council voted 9
to 2 against supporting a proposed
state legislative action that would
attempt to halt the use of
California boys in undeclared
wars.
