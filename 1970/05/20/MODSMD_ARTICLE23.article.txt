# Seminars To Form Basis Of Black Pine Circle School
## Chemicals, Bombs, Bulldozers 
### DICK BUXTON 
A new approach to educational
and community activity has been
designed by students and faculty
in the Berkeley area.
The organization is Black Pine
Circle and hopes to develop
quality education to explore the
"universal questions of life,"
according to Circle member Karel
Van Haeften of Berkeley.
The organization is sponsoring
a six-week summer program
beginning June 21 with a core
seminar on "American
Technocracy and the Rise of the
Counter Culture" to explore the
problems of man in a
technological society. The
summer session will also include
discussion groups with various
guest lectures, mainly from U.C.
Berkeley, a film seminar, music

and art programs, and a separate
children's program.
Educational Experience
The Circle was founded about
iwo years ago by Oscar Pemantle,
a U.C. Berkeley graduate student
and instructor who is also present
director of the Circle. He will
guide the technocracy seminar in
the summer session.
Black Pine Circle was
established not as a commune or
an "anti-school" says group
secretary Ellie Gallagher but as an
experience in education which
would provide a unified
educational program and cultural
community. Gallagher, an
elementary school teacher, says
that members of the Circle seek to
open up a community school
environment to children of
kindergarten age through

college-age students and beyond.
No master plan exists for the
future of the Circle, but members
hope eventually to establish a year
around community school which
would operate within a rural
setting.
Summer Lectures
Discussion sessions will take
place during the summer between
students and guest lecturers on
topics in education, political
science, philosophy, anthropology
and ecology. Lectures will include
A. James Gregor, Professor of
Political Science at Berkeley
talking on "An Appraisal of
Marxism and Street Scene," Paul
Lee of U.C. Santa Cruz, on "The
Rise of Philosophical
Consciousness in Greece,"and
John Searle, Philosophy professor
from Berkeley on "Ordinary
Language Philosophy's
Children's Program
Independent of the above
program will be a six week
children's program for children
from ages three to ten. The
students will be divided into two
age groups, ages three to six and
seven to ten, with separate
programs for each. There will be a
reading, mathematics, science, art
and music on a non-graded and
non-competetive and informal
basis. Outside field trips and
creative individual and group
activities will also be part of the
program.
Membership in Black Pine
Circle which allows participation
in any or all of the summer
activities is still open.

A new approach to educational
and community activity has been
designed by students and faculty
in the Berkeley area.
The organization is Black Pine
Circle and hopes to develop
quality education to explore the
"universal questions of life,"
according to Circle member Karel
Van Haeften of Berkeley.
The organization is sponsoring
a six-week summer program
beginning June 21 with a core
seminar on "American
Technocracy and the Rise of the
Counter Culture" to explore the
problems of man in a
technological society. The
summer session will also include
discussion groups with various
guest lectures, mainly from U.C.
Berkeley, a film seminar, music

and art programs, and a separate
children's program.
Educational Experience
The Circle was founded about
iwo years ago by Oscar Pemantle,
a U.C. Berkeley graduate student
and instructor who is also present
director of the Circle. He will
guide the technocracy seminar in
the summer session.
Black Pine Circle was
established not as a commune or
an "anti-school" says group
secretary Ellie Gallagher but as an
experience in education which
would provide a unified
educational program and cultural
community. Gallagher, an
elementary school teacher, says
that members of the Circle seek to
open up a community school
environment to children of
kindergarten age through

college-age students and beyond.
No master plan exists for the
future of the Circle, but members
hope eventually to establish a year
around community school which
would operate within a rural
setting.
Summer Lectures
Discussion sessions will take
place during the summer between
students and guest lecturers on
topics in education, political
science, philosophy, anthropology
and ecology. Lectures will include
A. James Gregor, Professor of
Political Science at Berkeley
talking on "An Appraisal of
Marxism and Street Scene," Paul
Lee of U.C. Santa Cruz, on "The
Rise of Philosophical
Consciousness in Greece,"and
John Searle, Philosophy professor
