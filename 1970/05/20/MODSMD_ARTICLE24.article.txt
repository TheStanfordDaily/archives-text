# Defoliation Effects Explained
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The United States secretly
conducted defoliation campaigns
in Cambodia over one year ago, a
Stanford biology professor said
Monday.
Professor Colin S. Pittendrigh
also stated that the total acreage
sprayed from 1962 to 1969
amounts to 1/5 of the total
forestlands of South Vietnam and
1/12 of the total land area.
Pittendrigh admitted that this
figure may be high however, as
some areas could have been
defoliated more than once.
His remarks came during a
teach-in on biological warfare held
Monday evening.
According to Pittendrigh, the
Cambodian sprayings were
directed against rubber
plantations. The Department of
Defense initially denied the
charges of the Royal Camobidan
Government, stating the
defoliation was the result of wind
blown chemicals from Bietnam.
But when confronted by the
findings of an ad hoc international
researcy team which investigated

at the request of the Sihuanouk
regime, the State Department
admitted that "overflights" had
occured.
Consequences Unknown
The popular Human Biology
instructor repeatedly stressed that
the consequences of biological
warfare in South Vietnam are
unknown.
"Ignorance is not a license for
action," he emphasized.
"Ignorance of biological concepts
is a prohibition from action!"
A good deal of the lecture
concerned the nature of defoliants
used in Vietnam and their effects.
Dioxan, an agent found in
245T, one of the common
defoliants used in Vietnam, is 50
to 200 times more toxic than
Thalidomide, Pittendrigh said.
And the defoliant itself is more
toxic than the birth
defect-producing tranquilizer.
"At the end of 1969, the
President's scientific advisor
promised that 245T would be
removed from the market. But if
you want some, you can pick it
up right on El Camino,"

Pittendrigh charged.
245T and 24D, another
common defoliant, are
manufactured by Dow Chemical.
They, like all defoliants, cause
plants to shed their leaves
artificially by simulating the
action of the plant hormone
auxin.
Attack Herbicides
Pittendrigh also attacked the
use of herbicides on rice crops in
the Central Highlands. He held
that this strategy, done under the
theory of denying resources to the
enemy, is more immoral than
large-scale bombings of civilian
populations.
"The large-scale bombing of
civilian areas is considered evil
because it is indiscriminate," he
noted. "But when rice crops are
destroyed in a land that is not rich
in food supplies, it is not the
soldiers who are starved . . .
"The use of herbicides
discriminates against civilians. It is
the women, children and the
elderly who will not eat."
Other aspects of biological
warfare in Indochina involve the
massive B-52 bombings and the
use of bulldozers to clear trees.
Craters
Pittendrigh said the bomb
craters may be of "... greater
biological severity than the total
damage done by defoliants.
"It will never be politically
viable to spend the money
necessary to repair this damage,"
he pointed out.

to 200 times more toxic than
Thalidomide, Pittendrigh said.
And the defoliant itself is more
toxic than the birth
defect-producing tranquilizer.
"At the end of 1969, the
President's scientific advisor
promised that 245T would be
removed from the market. But if
you want some, you can pick it
up right on El Camino,"

Pittendrigh charged.
245T and 24D, another
common defoliant, are
manufactured by Dow Chemical.
They, like all defoliants, cause
plants to shed their leaves
artificially by simulating the
action of the plant hormone
auxin.
Attack Herbicides
Pittendrigh also attacked the
use of herbicides on rice crops in
the Central Highlands. He held
that this strategy, done under the
theory of denying resources to the
enemy, is more immoral than
large-scale bombings of civilian
populations.
"The large-scale bombing of
civilian areas is considered evil
because it is indiscriminate," he
noted. "But when rice crops are
destroyed in a land that is not rich
in food supplies, it is not the
soldiers who are starved . . .
"The use of herbicides
discriminates against civilians. It is
the women, children and the
elderly who will not eat."
Other aspects of biological
warfare in Indochina involve the
massive B-52 bombings and the
use of bulldozers to clear trees.
Craters
Pittendrigh said the bomb
craters may be of "... greater
biological severity than the total
damage done by defoliants.
"It will never be politically
viable to spend the money
necessary to repair this damage,"
he pointed out.

The United States secretly
conducted defoliation campaigns
in Cambodia over one year ago, a
Stanford biology professor said
Monday.
Professor Colin S. Pittendrigh
also stated that the total acreage
sprayed from 1962 to 1969
amounts to 1/5 of the total
forestlands of South Vietnam and
1/12 of the total land area.
Pittendrigh admitted that this
figure may be high however, as
some areas could have been
defoliated more than once.
His remarks came during a
teach-in on biological warfare held
Monday evening.
According to Pittendrigh, the
Cambodian sprayings were
directed against rubber
plantations. The Department of
Defense initially denied the
charges of the Royal Camobidan
Government, stating the
defoliation was the result of wind
blown chemicals from Bietnam.
But when confronted by the
findings of an ad hoc international
researcy team which investigated

at the request of the Sihuanouk
regime, the State Department
admitted that "overflights" had
occured.
Consequences Unknown
The popular Human Biology
instructor repeatedly stressed that
the consequences of biological
warfare in South Vietnam are
unknown.
"Ignorance is not a license for
action," he emphasized.
"Ignorance of biological concepts
is a prohibition from action!"
A good deal of the lecture
concerned the nature of defoliants
used in Vietnam and their effects.
Dioxan, an agent found in
245T, one of the common
defoliants used in Vietnam, is 50
to 200 times more toxic than
Thalidomide, Pittendrigh said.
