J a pan-America
The 22nd Japan-America Student Conference, held alternately
from year to year in Japan and the United States, will be sponsored
by the I-Center at Stanford this summer, August 1-8. This
Japan-America Student Conference is the only conference of its kind,
which attempts, during a week-long period, to promote a serious
dialogue between Japanese and American university students,
representing a wide variety of schools as well as a wide variety of
perspectives on matters of mutual concern. The conference will divide
into a number of specific study groups to discuss politics, economics,
etc. as well as having guest speakers and special workshop sessions to
discuss such things as student problems and social mores. If you are
interested in rapping with Japanese students in an informal manner in
*a dorm and conference situation, please inquire about details by
phoning Margi Haas, 3 28-0973 or write Box 8287 Stanford.
Application deadline: May 25th.
Spring Sing
This Sunday, May 24 will mark the 29th Annual Spring Sing. This
traditional event gives Stanford living groups the opportunity to
sound off on university policies, campus personalities, and national
issues.
Last year's sweepstakes winners, El Toro, will be back again in
force looking for their fifth straight victory. Also returning will be the
Sigma Chi O.T. Ragtime Jug Band, a rag-tag bunch of inebriates. Since
the judging is traditionally a capella, the group was disqualified last
year. However, they plan to return and display themselves once again.
The number of entries is rather small this year, practically so small
that all a group has to do to win is to enter. Trophies will be awarded
for men's group under 10, women's under 40, mixed over 40, mized
under 40, originality, and sweepstakes.
Master of Ceremonies will be Hal Mlckelson, with the Stanford
Band putting on their usual Half-time collection of gross-outs and
absurdities.
The Mendicants and the Axidentals will also be part of the
entertainment.
Frost Amphitheatre will be the forum for student opinion this
Sunday at 8:00 p.m.
