# 'Malcolm' at ACT Dare To Struggle, Dare To Flop
## 
### PAT THOMAS 
Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs is a turgid
little drama about schoolboy rebellion as a sexual identity crisis. It is
difficult to imagine how ACT, which needs all the good plays it can
get, could have taken David Halliwell's uninspired script seriously.
The scene is an art school in Northern England from which
Malcolm Scrawdyke (Herbert Foster) has been expelled as the
culminating of five years "assing around." Not only has he been
expelled, but also declared off-limits to his former classmates.
Malcolm decides that he has been victimized by the headmaster,
and enlists this best friends Wick (Martin Berman) and Ingham
(Michael Cavanaugh) in a plot to right the supposed injustice. They
call themselves the Party of Dynamic Erection, thereby erasing any
doubts which the audience had about the play's roots in adolescent
sexuality.
Fortunately the original trio is augmented by Dennis Charles Nipple
(Robert Ground), an aspiring novelist who talks in lush purple prose.
Despite the kitsch of his character's name Ground's performance as
the pale and put-upon Nipple is delightful throughout.
Plot
During the interminable first half of the play Malcolm and his
cohorts formulate an elaborately silly blackmail scheme against the
headmaster. Their plot includes stealing a painting from the school's
totally unguarded gallery (with precautions worthy of any Grade B
Hollywood thriller) and kidnapping the headmaster himself.
Malcolm and Wick are the masterminds of the scheme, and only in
moments of nose-to-nose fantasizing do Foster and Berman succeed in
making their characters interesting. Still, neither actor makes a human
being emerge from the jungle of foot-stomping and arm-waving which
is the substance of their performances.
Much more interesting is Michael Cavanaugh's performance as
Ingham, the one who goes along with the plot without ever believing
in it. He consistently and subtlely conveys the hopelessness of the
situation, often through presence rather than speech.
s*x
The second half of the play opens portentously with the Rolling
Stones You Can t Always Get What You Want," and sex is dragged
into the arena. Whenever he is left alone on stage Malcolm maunders
about his lack of success with an art student named Ann (Deborah
Sussel), and finally he and the other boys yet around to discussing her.

What follows is a pitifully trite portrayal of the frustrations of the
adolescent male, complete with all the bravado, innuendo, and
bitterness which usually afflict such scenes. The only relief is provided
by Nipple, who delivers a straight-faced monologue about his
imaginary encounter with a "black she-panther with untamed eyes."
Since none of the boys seems to have had any success with sex, the
talk soon turns to revolution. The vendetta against the headmaster
soon balloons into the first step on the road to world domination.
With a concern for power comes paranoia, and Malcolm soon
concludes that Nipple is a spy sent by the headmaster to destroy their
"movement."
Guilty Nipple
With Malcolm as judge, Wick as prosecutor and defender, and
Ingham as sole witness they try Nipple as a traitor. It is almost
unnecessary to add that they find him guilty and heartlessly ostracize
him. Ground once again steals the scene, demonstrating that he can
lend poignancy to a character which he has played for laughs most of
the time.
P inally, the inevitable happens. Ann finds Malcolm alone in his flat,
and bluntly asks him if he would like to sleep with her. She tells him
that his plot is a silly sublimation, and that he's really just hung-up
about sex. Its refreshing to find a character in the middle of this mess
who recognizes what is going on and can articulate it.
Naturally Malcolm refuses to accept her evaluation of his problems,
although he might have if his comrades hadn't walked in. Surrounded
by his boys, Malcolm becomes all bluster and insists that Ann is a spy.
What lollows is a ridiculous bit ol violence against the girl which
reaches orgasmic proportions. Of course, all this happens five minutes
before the great plot is to go into effect. Having spent their
frustrations, the boys find that they are powerless to execute their
plans.
Desertion
Having been disappointed by their leader, Wick and Ingham desert
him. Malcolm is left alone with his problems, and the emotional
impact of all this is a big "So What?"
This is a play which one wants to like. The actors are engaging and
attractive young performers and the set, lighting, and sound are
strictly professional. At the opening performance there were some
problems with timing, and the performers did not always radiate
confidence in their lines, but these things often improve in the course
of the season.
Even if the production becomes immensely polished, nothing is
going to save a script like this one. The story inches along, never sure
of where it's going and seldom justifying where it's been. The writing
is uniformly tedious, and perhaps the only good line in the play comes
during the rehearsal of the art gallery heist. Wick and Nipple are
planning "casual" conversation for outside the elevator, and Wick
suddenly turns to Nipple and drawls, "Is picking one's nose a venial or
a mortal sin?"
II you re still interested, Little Malcolm can be seen at the Marines
Memorial Theater in San Francisco through June.
