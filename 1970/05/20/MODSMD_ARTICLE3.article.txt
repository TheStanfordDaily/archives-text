# Senate Rivals Brown, Tunney Debate Small Disagreements
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Congressmen John Tunney and
George Brown carried their
campaigns for the Democratic
Senatorial nomination to Stanford
last night as Brown edged ahead in
opinion polls for the first time.
With two weeks remaining until
the Democratic primary, a
capacity crowd filled Memorial
Auditorium to hear the two
candidates. But, as moderator
Stuart McLean noted in closing,
the debate was more a contrast in
style and emphasis, rather than
substantive issues.
Indeed, the debate reflected the
styles that clashed in a
Democratic primary two years
earlier in California. Brown, who
drew heavier applause from the
mainly student audience,
reminded many of the cool,
low-key manner and pointed wit
of Eugene McCarthy while
Tunney seemed to mirror the
more charismatic Kennedy style.
Both candidates re-iterated
their unequivocal opposition to
the war in Indochina and called
for a drastic reduction in military
spending and influence. Both
praised American students for,
in Tunney's words, "awakening
the conscience of America on the
war." Both urged the re-ordering
of national priorities to meet such
domestic crises as housing and
education shortages.
On many of the issues, such as
opposition to the war, the only
major distinction between Brown

and Tunney was that Brown had
gotten there first.
Tunney Criticized
In his opening remarks, Brown
heavily criticized Tunney's once
strong support of Lyndon
Johnson's war policies. Brown
noted, "It was only on the second
coming of Tunney to Vietnam (in
1968) that he realized he'd been
lied to."
Quoting Tunney's explanation
that "a man who doesn't change
his mind is a fool, "Brown
continued, "I want to commend
John for changing his mind. He
has shown he is not a fool. What
he has shown is that when the
American people change their
views on the war John will jump
right to the forefront of that
change."
Brown appealed to the voters
to compare his voting record with
Tunney's. Brown has voted
against all war appropriations and
war taxes since 1965, while
Tunney has voted for them.
"It is time to quit believing in
what politicians say and start look
at what they've done," Brown
argued.
Tunney replied, somewhat
caustically, "Even our knights in
white armour have chinks in that
armour." He noted that Brown
voted for the Gulf of Tonkin
resolution in 1964, and that
Brown, too, changed his mind.
One major difference in emphasis
came in response to a question
about the candidates' views on the
Black Panthers.
Tunney argued that it was not
the association, but the
individuals, who should be judged.
"Some Black Panthers are lawless,
some are law-abiding," Tunney
explained.
He urged a federal investigation
of the slaying of Fred Hampton
Panther leader in Chicago,
explaining, "We can't expect the
police department to investigate
itself."
Brown spoke in less moderate
terms. "The Black Panthers," he
said, have been subjected to a
systematic, illegal, nationwide
campaign to destroy them.
"The present course being
followed bj' law enforcement
agencies is not only wrong and
illegal, but is absolutely
precluding an understanding of
the frustrations of black people
which have led to the rise of the
Panthers and their philosophy."
Boycott Conflict
A major area of conflict
between the two congressmen has
been the issue of the grape
boycott. Tunney criticized
Brown's walking the picket lines

in support of the boycott,
commenting that collective
bargaining rights for the
farmworkers should be sought
through legislation and mediation
rather than boycotting and
picketing. "I don't think
congressmen should walk picket
lines" he said.
Another clear split came over
the issue of abortion and birth
control. "At my age I can
celibacy," Brown joked, to the
roar of the 1800 in attendance.
On a more serious note, Brown
called for a national bill legalizing
abortion, and emphasized that he
had introduced bills reducing the
tax incentives for large families
and increasing them for small
families.
Tunney opposed the
nationwide legalization of
abortion, stating that he
personally favored abortion only
when the mother's mental or
physical health was in danger. He
said that state abortion laws
should be liberalized, but that it
was a matter for the majority of
voters in each state to decide.
The tones of their remarkd
diverged again on the issue of
campus disruptions. Tunney
opposed violence from both
students and police, and called for
a down-play of the violent
rhetoric on both sides.
While opposing violence, Brown

argued that the cause of student
frustrations is "the complete lack
of response from people in power
to the urgent need for change."
He added, "The only way we will
get back to a condition of
tranquility is to have change that
will eliminate institutionalized
violence. This violence is
represented not only by the war,
but by the willingness of the
establishment to use force to
repress dissent."
In a press conference following
the debate, Congressman Tunney
reiterated that, "a person can be
constructive if he is willing to
work within the system. "
While disapproving of
wiretapping and other current
surveillance tactics, he had harsh
words for radical dissenters.
Asked about the Chicago
Conspiracy Trial, he noted that,
"it was a mockery, it made a
bunch of heroes out of some
creeps."
He continued, "they're dirty,
revolutionary type people; if they
were tried for anything, it should
have been for littering the
streets."
He referred chiefly to Jerry
Rubin, mentioning that he had
listened to one of Rubin's
speeches. One high school
journalist asked if he included
David Delinger in that "creep"
category; he replied that he did.

Tunney's. Brown has voted
against all war appropriations and
war taxes since 1965, while
Tunney has voted for them.
"It is time to quit believing in
what politicians say and start look
at what they've done," Brown
argued.
Tunney replied, somewhat
caustically, "Even our knights in
white armour have chinks in that
armour." He noted that Brown
voted for the Gulf of Tonkin
resolution in 1964, and that
Brown, too, changed his mind.
One major difference in emphasis
came in response to a question
about the candidates' views on the
Black Panthers.
Tunney argued that it was not
the association, but the
individuals, who should be judged.
"Some Black Panthers are lawless,
some are law-abiding," Tunney
explained.
He urged a federal investigation
of the slaying of Fred Hampton
Panther leader in Chicago,
explaining, "We can't expect the
police department to investigate
itself."
Brown spoke in less moderate
terms. "The Black Panthers," he
said, have been subjected to a
systematic, illegal, nationwide
campaign to destroy them.
"The present course being
followed bj' law enforcement
agencies is not only wrong and
illegal, but is absolutely
precluding an understanding of
the frustrations of black people
which have led to the rise of the
Panthers and their philosophy."
Boycott Conflict
A major area of conflict
between the two congressmen has
been the issue of the grape
boycott. Tunney criticized
Brown's walking the picket lines

in support of the boycott,
commenting that collective
bargaining rights for the
farmworkers should be sought
through legislation and mediation
rather than boycotting and
picketing. "I don't think
congressmen should walk picket
lines" he said.
Another clear split came over
the issue of abortion and birth
control. "At my age I can
celibacy," Brown joked, to the
roar of the 1800 in attendance.
On a more serious note, Brown
called for a national bill legalizing
abortion, and emphasized that he
had introduced bills reducing the
tax incentives for large families
and increasing them for small
families.
Tunney opposed the
nationwide legalization of
abortion, stating that he
personally favored abortion only
when the mother's mental or
physical health was in danger. He
said that state abortion laws
should be liberalized, but that it
was a matter for the majority of
voters in each state to decide.
The tones of their remarkd
diverged again on the issue of
campus disruptions. Tunney
opposed violence from both
students and police, and called for
a down-play of the violent
rhetoric on both sides.
While opposing violence, Brown

argued that the cause of student
frustrations is "the complete lack
of response from people in power
to the urgent need for change."
He added, "The only way we will
get back to a condition of
tranquility is to have change that
will eliminate institutionalized
violence. This violence is
represented not only by the war,
but by the willingness of the
establishment to use force to
repress dissent."
In a press conference following
the debate, Congressman Tunney
reiterated that, "a person can be
constructive if he is willing to
work within the system. "
While disapproving of
wiretapping and other current
surveillance tactics, he had harsh
words for radical dissenters.
Asked about the Chicago
Conspiracy Trial, he noted that,
"it was a mockery, it made a
bunch of heroes out of some
creeps."
He continued, "they're dirty,
revolutionary type people; if they
were tried for anything, it should
have been for littering the
streets."
He referred chiefly to Jerry
Rubin, mentioning that he had
listened to one of Rubin's
speeches. One high school
journalist asked if he included
David Delinger in that "creep"
category; he replied that he did.
Congressmen John Tunney and
George Brown carried their
campaigns for the Democratic
Senatorial nomination to Stanford
last night as Brown edged ahead in
opinion polls for the first time.
With two weeks remaining until
the Democratic primary, a
capacity crowd filled Memorial
Auditorium to hear the two
candidates. But, as moderator
Stuart McLean noted in closing,
the debate was more a contrast in
style and emphasis, rather than
substantive issues.
Indeed, the debate reflected the
styles that clashed in a
Democratic primary two years
earlier in California. Brown, who
drew heavier applause from the
mainly student audience,
reminded many of the cool,
low-key manner and pointed wit
of Eugene McCarthy while
Tunney seemed to mirror the
more charismatic Kennedy style.
Both candidates re-iterated
their unequivocal opposition to
the war in Indochina and called
for a drastic reduction in military
spending and influence. Both
praised American students for,
in Tunney's words, "awakening
the conscience of America on the
war." Both urged the re-ordering
of national priorities to meet such
domestic crises as housing and
education shortages.
On many of the issues, such as
opposition to the war, the only
major distinction between Brown

and Tunney was that Brown had
gotten there first.
Tunney Criticized
In his opening remarks, Brown
heavily criticized Tunney's once
strong support of Lyndon
Johnson's war policies. Brown
noted, "It was only on the second
coming of Tunney to Vietnam (in
1968) that he realized he'd been
lied to."
Quoting Tunney's explanation
that "a man who doesn't change
his mind is a fool, "Brown
continued, "I want to commend
John for changing his mind. He
has shown he is not a fool. What
he has shown is that when the
American people change their
views on the war John will jump
right to the forefront of that
change."

abortion, and emphasized that he
had introduced bills reducing the
tax incentives for large families
and increasing them for small
families.
Tunney opposed the
nationwide legalization of
abortion, stating that he
personally favored abortion only
when the mother's mental or
physical health was in danger. He
said that state abortion laws
should be liberalized, but that it
was a matter for the majority of
voters in each state to decide.
The tones of their remarkd
diverged again on the issue of
campus disruptions. Tunney
opposed violence from both
students and police, and called for
a down-play of the violent
rhetoric on both sides.
While opposing violence, Brown

argued that the cause of student
frustrations is "the complete lack
of response from people in power
to the urgent need for change."
He added, "The only way we will
get back to a condition of
tranquility is to have change that
will eliminate institutionalized
violence. This violence is
represented not only by the war,
but by the willingness of the
establishment to use force to
repress dissent."
In a press conference following
the debate, Congressman Tunney
reiterated that, "a person can be
constructive if he is willing to
work within the system. "
While disapproving of
wiretapping and other current
surveillance tactics, he had harsh
words for radical dissenters.
Asked about the Chicago
Conspiracy Trial, he noted that,
"it was a mockery, it made a
bunch of heroes out of some
creeps."
He continued, "they're dirty,
revolutionary type people; if they
were tried for anything, it should
have been for littering the
streets."
He referred chiefly to Jerry
Rubin, mentioning that he had
listened to one of Rubin's
speeches. One high school
journalist asked if he included
David Delinger in that "creep"
category; he replied that he did.
Congressmen John Tunney and
George Brown carried their
campaigns for the Democratic
Senatorial nomination to Stanford
last night as Brown edged ahead in
opinion polls for the first time.
With two weeks remaining until
the Democratic primary, a
capacity crowd filled Memorial
Auditorium to hear the two
candidates. But, as moderator
Stuart McLean noted in closing,
the debate was more a contrast in
style and emphasis, rather than
substantive issues.
Indeed, the debate reflected the
styles that clashed in a
Democratic primary two years
earlier in California. Brown, who
drew heavier applause from the
mainly student audience,
reminded many of the cool,
low-key manner and pointed wit
of Eugene McCarthy while
Tunney seemed to mirror the
more charismatic Kennedy style.
Both candidates re-iterated
their unequivocal opposition to
the war in Indochina and called
for a drastic reduction in military
spending and influence. Both
praised American students for,
in Tunney's words, "awakening
the conscience of America on the
war." Both urged the re-ordering
of national priorities to meet such
domestic crises as housing and
education shortages.
On many of the issues, such as
opposition to the war, the only
major distinction between Brown

and Tunney was that Brown had
gotten there first.
Tunney Criticized
In his opening remarks, Brown
heavily criticized Tunney's once
strong support of Lyndon
Johnson's war policies. Brown
noted, "It was only on the second
coming of Tunney to Vietnam (in
1968) that he realized he'd been
lied to."
Quoting Tunney's explanation
that "a man who doesn't change
his mind is a fool, "Brown
continued, "I want to commend
John for changing his mind. He
has shown he is not a fool. What
he has shown is that when the
American people change their
views on the war John will jump
right to the forefront of that
change."
Brown appealed to the voters
to compare his voting record with
Tunney's. Brown has voted
against all war appropriations and
war taxes since 1965, while
Tunney has voted for them.
"It is time to quit believing in
what politicians say and start look
at what they've done," Brown
argued.
Tunney replied, somewhat
caustically, "Even our knights in
white armour have chinks in that
armour." He noted that Brown
voted for the Gulf of Tonkin
resolution in 1964, and that
Brown, too, changed his mind.
One major difference in emphasis
came in response to a question
about the candidates' views on the
Black Panthers.
Tunney argued that it was not
the association, but the
individuals, who should be judged.
"Some Black Panthers are lawless,
some are law-abiding," Tunney
explained.
He urged a federal investigation
of the slaying of Fred Hampton
Panther leader in Chicago,
explaining, "We can't expect the
police department to investigate
itself."
Brown spoke in less moderate
terms. "The Black Panthers," he
said, have been subjected to a
systematic, illegal, nationwide
campaign to destroy them.
"The present course being
followed bj' law enforcement
agencies is not only wrong and
illegal, but is absolutely
precluding an understanding of
the frustrations of black people
which have led to the rise of the
Panthers and their philosophy."
Boycott Conflict
A major area of conflict
between the two congressmen has
been the issue of the grape
boycott. Tunney criticized
Brown's walking the picket lines

in support of the boycott,
commenting that collective
bargaining rights for the
farmworkers should be sought
through legislation and mediation
rather than boycotting and
picketing. "I don't think
congressmen should walk picket
lines" he said.
Another clear split came over
the issue of abortion and birth
control. "At my age I can
celibacy," Brown joked, to the
roar of the 1800 in attendance.
On a more serious note, Brown
called for a national bill legalizing
abortion, and emphasized that he
had introduced bills reducing the
tax incentives for large families
and increasing them for small
families.
Tunney opposed the
nationwide legalization of
abortion, stating that he
personally favored abortion only
when the mother's mental or
physical health was in danger. He
