# Symphony Presents Viennese Program
## 
### PEDRO RAMET 
It is interesting to note that
along with Jascha Horenstein
(who is now at work in England
recording a Mahler cycle), Josef
Krips is the last surviving pupil of
conductor Felix Weingartner
whose recordings of the
Beethoven symphonies in the
thirties set the standards by which
all subsequent recordings have
been judged.
Like both Weingartner and
Horenstein, Krips has become
known for rendering straight and
true-to-score perform ".nces in
concert. Wednesday night was no
exception. And for the two hours
it lasted, one became aware again
that Krips grew up in the
Viennese musical tradition.
The spell was broken only by
the customary imprecision ,>n the
part of the brass and by the
habitual haste with which San
Francisco ai ; ences flee* the
concert hall soon as the
program ends.
The program itself was as
Viennese in taste as one could
desire. Starting right in with the
Mendelssohn Violin Conce.'to,
Krips bypassed the standard
option of opening with an

overture.
This was a tasteful choice since
even an overture like "Corsaire"
or "Magic Flute" would be an odd
prelude to a program closing with
the Mahler Fifth Symphony. The
Mendelssohn Concerto for Violin
was given a very respectable
performance by Stuart Canin,
associate concertmaster for the
orchestra.
The Mahler Fifth Symphony
received an impassioned and
penetrating interpretation by
Krips.
The first movement, marked
"Trauermarsch" (funeral march),
displays a wide use of percussion
from snare drums and triangle to
xylophone and timpani, the latter
even being called upon at one
point to carry the melody line. It
is strange to note that after the
first performance of the work.
The third movement is one of
the more problematic scores to
perform, and was heralded by
rather coarse pizzicato playing in
the violins. Krips relished in the
schmaltz of the movement and
realized perfectly the tainted and
ironic, even morbid of
that schmaltz.

The fourth movement,
Adagietto, was described by the
British magazine, "Record
Review" as being the most easily
attainable of the five movements
of this symphony. Written for
strings, it is warm and sunny as
strings tend to be. Krip's
conception of the symphony was
brilliant and the orchestra
responded adequately.
Traditionally Mahler likes to
rage in the last movement of his
symphonies; thus the subdued
nature of the opening passages of
the final movement of the Fifth
camc as a surprise. The first
movement began as a dirge and
burial for the entire human race;
the last movement closed
throbbing with sisyphic futility
spinning to an end in morbidly
satirical frivolity.
Maestro Krips received a
well-deserved standing-ovation;
Stuart Canin is to be commended
for a laudable job with the
Mendelssohn. I only hope that for
at least the two hours that the
concert lasted, the audience
appreciate Krips for the genius he
has in him and understood the
loss that his departure from San
Francisco will be.

Francisco ai ; ences flee* the
concert hall soon as the
program ends.
The program itself was as
Viennese in taste as one could
desire. Starting right in with the
Mendelssohn Violin Conce.'to,
Krips bypassed the standard
option of opening with an

overture.
This was a tasteful choice since
even an overture like "Corsaire"
or "Magic Flute" would be an odd
prelude to a program closing with
the Mahler Fifth Symphony. The
Mendelssohn Concerto for Violin
was given a very respectable
performance by Stuart Canin,
associate concertmaster for the
orchestra.
The Mahler Fifth Symphony
received an impassioned and
penetrating interpretation by
Krips.
The first movement, marked
"Trauermarsch" (funeral march),
displays a wide use of percussion
from snare drums and triangle to
xylophone and timpani, the latter
even being called upon at one
point to carry the melody line. It
is strange to note that after the
first performance of the work.
The third movement is one of
the more problematic scores to
perform, and was heralded by
rather coarse pizzicato playing in
the violins. Krips relished in the
schmaltz of the movement and
realized perfectly the tainted and
ironic, even morbid of
that schmaltz.

The fourth movement,
Adagietto, was described by the
British magazine, "Record
Review" as being the most easily
attainable of the five movements
of this symphony. Written for
strings, it is warm and sunny as
strings tend to be. Krip's
conception of the symphony was
brilliant and the orchestra
responded adequately.
Traditionally Mahler likes to
rage in the last movement of his
symphonies; thus the subdued
nature of the opening passages of
the final movement of the Fifth
camc as a surprise. The first
movement began as a dirge and
burial for the entire human race;
the last movement closed
throbbing with sisyphic futility
spinning to an end in morbidly
satirical frivolity.
Maestro Krips received a
well-deserved standing-ovation;
Stuart Canin is to be commended
for a laudable job with the
Mendelssohn. I only hope that for
at least the two hours that the
concert lasted, the audience
appreciate Krips for the genius he
has in him and understood the
loss that his departure from San
Francisco will be.
It is interesting to note that
along with Jascha Horenstein
(who is now at work in England
recording a Mahler cycle), Josef
Krips is the last surviving pupil of
conductor Felix Weingartner
whose recordings of the
Beethoven symphonies in the
thirties set the standards by which
all subsequent recordings have
been judged.
Like both Weingartner and
Horenstein, Krips has become
known for rendering straight and
true-to-score perform ".nces in
concert. Wednesday night was no
exception. And for the two hours
it lasted, one became aware again
that Krips grew up in the
Viennese musical tradition.
The spell was broken only by
the customary imprecision ,>n the
part of the brass and by the
habitual haste with which San
