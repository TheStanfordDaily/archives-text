PART 3: After the Ball is Over.
Bring these things together.
Bring all these people to the
center. The Gestalt Fool, a
communal theater family, has
been living and working together
for over a year, developing theater
techniques related to gestalt,
ritual, and transformation. They
will be at Stanford on May 19th
and 21st at 8:00 p.m. in Branner
Hall with an experiment in
Neo-Dada Vaudeville called
TbHjrio. Â£2.00 donations are
requested but not demanded.
Twenty percent of the donations
will go to Legal Defense.
And 1 am J for all that I have
changed.

Appendix A
When All is Said and Done
If we are all doomed then we
will all fall together. Damnation is
an insidious disease. The devil is
loose upon the world. Fire flares
from every corner of the globe.
Meat eaters of the world, unite!
Cast your seed upon the ovens.
The massacres have only just
begun. Fresh flesh for gassing.
Such tender young bodies, ripe
for destruction. This is nothing
new. We are glutted with each
other's charred skin. You are only
the dessert.
Grave on a green hillside. Grave
on a green hillside. In the years to
come we will calmly sleep in a
grave on a green hillside.
Apocalypse in our lifetime.
There has always been the lurking
suspicion of oblivion. Now it
becomes clear. The plague is at
your doorstep.
