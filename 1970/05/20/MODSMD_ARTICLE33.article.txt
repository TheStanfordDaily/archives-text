# Indian Marks Tumble
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
A quick glance at the team
standings in last weekend's Pac-8
track meet would only show that
Stanford finished last with but 30
points. Add this to an 0-7
dual-meet record and it might
appear to be pretty gruesome.
In light of these facts it would
seem hard to explain in happiness
of coaches and tracksters alike
following the meet. You'd expect
the coaches to be out crying in
their Nutrament instead of going
around with foot-wide smiles and
even granting interviews to young
and yellow student journalists.
But behind all those losing
scores this year, there is still a lot
to be happy about, especially last
weekend. Midway through this
season it seemed as if the
installation of the new rubber
based track last fall might well be
the season's highpoint. But then
came last weekend's two day Los

Angeles extravaganza.
Sure, UCLA took the team title
coming from way behind to nip a
disappointed Oregon squad. But
while not making noise as a team,
some individual Indians
performed fantastically.
The First
Duncan Mac Donald, a junior
from Hawaii, became the first
Stanford miler ever to break the
four minute mark. Mac-Donald
had never run faster than 4:05.6
but Saturday he whipped around
UCLA's tartan track in 3:59.6,
only to finish third, four tenths of
a second behind both Washington
State's Rick Riley and Oregon's
Roscoe Divine.
While Mac Donald was breaking
one school standard on the track
another junior Allen Meredith was
taking care of a field record. On
his third attempt in the triple
jump Meredith sailed 52 feet 3
inches to set not only a few

school mark, but new stadium and
meet records as well.
Back in the distance events
once again, another junior Don
Kardong rat a fine 13:37.4 to
finish fourth behind Oregon
freshman Steve Prefontaine.
Teammate Greg Brock was fifth in
13:41.4.
Friday afternoon Brook
Thomas had lowered still another
Card school mark when he cruised
over track, water hazards and
hurdles in 8:59.6, good for fourth
place. Hurdler Bill Griffith got the
only other Indian points with a
fourth place finish in the high
hurdles with a 14.2 clocking.
So all was not bleak in Los
Angeles.
The fact that Meredith,
Mac Donald, Brock, and Kardong
have good shots in the nationals
next month accounted for a lot of
the coaches' happiness, but
although they usually deny such
things, I couldn't help but think
they were also smiling about next
year.
Long List
This season was ruined by an
unbelievable number of injuries
which sidelined key performers.
Defending Pac-8 high hurdle
champ Rick Tipton sat out all the
competition with a leg injury.
Promising freshman sprinter A 1
Dyson joined him on the sidelines
with a hamstring injury following
an outstanding debut in the San
Jose State meet.
Broad jumper and quartermiler
Jim Kauffman spent a couple of
meets on the rugby field and then
when he starting running he was
slowed by a leg injury which
necessitated surgery. In the field
events Olympic pole vaulter Casey
Carrigan was slowed all year with
mononucleosis.
And even captain T.C. Jones
had a painful hand injury,
although he continued to
compete.
Of these temporary cripples
only Jones graduates and the rest
should all return next season.
Stanford's biggest trouble this
year came in the sprints and
relays. This problem might no
longer be so bad next year with
the addition of two freshman
sprinters from Texas.
Sprint Help
The first of the two is Ken Curl
a Houston product who ran a 9.3
hundred when he was 15 years
old. Curl was the state champ in
this event in both 1968 and 1969.
He will be joined by Rupert Shaw,
the 1970 state champ in 9.5.
Shaw has also run a 46.2 440 leg
on a mile relay team.
The announcement of Curl and
Shaw's coming enrollment was
made at yesterday's track and
field luncheon by assistant coach
Bill Moultrie. Moultrie was
responsible for recruiting both
athletes.
If Curl and Shaw perform up to
their potential next year and
everyone remains healthy, the
lean years for Stanford track
should be over, and next year the
victories in Stanford Stadium
might not come in the fall alone.

athletes.
If Curl and Shaw perform up to
their potential next year and
everyone remains healthy, the
lean years for Stanford track
should be over, and next year the
victories in Stanford Stadium
might not come in the fall alone.
A quick glance at the team
standings in last weekend's Pac-8
track meet would only show that
Stanford finished last with but 30
points. Add this to an 0-7
dual-meet record and it might
appear to be pretty gruesome.
In light of these facts it would
seem hard to explain in happiness
of coaches and tracksters alike
following the meet. You'd expect
the coaches to be out crying in
their Nutrament instead of going
around with foot-wide smiles and
even granting interviews to young
and yellow student journalists.
But behind all those losing
scores this year, there is still a lot
to be happy about, especially last
weekend. Midway through this
season it seemed as if the
installation of the new rubber
based track last fall might well be
the season's highpoint. But then
came last weekend's two day Los

Angeles extravaganza.
Sure, UCLA took the team title
coming from way behind to nip a
disappointed Oregon squad. But
while not making noise as a team,
some individual Indians
performed fantastically.
The First
Duncan Mac Donald, a junior
from Hawaii, became the first
Stanford miler ever to break the
four minute mark. Mac-Donald
had never run faster than 4:05.6
but Saturday he whipped around
UCLA's tartan track in 3:59.6,
only to finish third, four tenths of
a second behind both Washington
State's Rick Riley and Oregon's
Roscoe Divine.
While Mac Donald was breaking
one school standard on the track
another junior Allen Meredith was
taking care of a field record. On
his third attempt in the triple
jump Meredith sailed 52 feet 3
inches to set not only a few

school mark, but new stadium and
meet records as well.
Back in the distance events
once again, another junior Don
Kardong rat a fine 13:37.4 to
finish fourth behind Oregon
freshman Steve Prefontaine.
Teammate Greg Brock was fifth in
13:41.4.
Friday afternoon Brook
Thomas had lowered still another
Card school mark when he cruised
over track, water hazards and
hurdles in 8:59.6, good for fourth
place. Hurdler Bill Griffith got the
only other Indian points with a
fourth place finish in the high
hurdles with a 14.2 clocking.
So all was not bleak in Los
Angeles.
The fact that Meredith,
Mac Donald, Brock, and Kardong
have good shots in the nationals
next month accounted for a lot of
the coaches' happiness, but
although they usually deny such
things, I couldn't help but think
they were also smiling about next
year.
Long List
This season was ruined by an
unbelievable number of injuries
which sidelined key performers.
Defending Pac-8 high hurdle
champ Rick Tipton sat out all the
competition with a leg injury.
Promising freshman sprinter A 1
Dyson joined him on the sidelines
with a hamstring injury following
an outstanding debut in the San
Jose State meet.
Broad jumper and quartermiler
Jim Kauffman spent a couple of
meets on the rugby field and then
when he starting running he was
slowed by a leg injury which
necessitated surgery. In the field
events Olympic pole vaulter Casey
Carrigan was slowed all year with
mononucleosis.
And even captain T.C. Jones
had a painful hand injury,
although he continued to
compete.
Of these temporary cripples
only Jones graduates and the rest
should all return next season.
Stanford's biggest trouble this
year came in the sprints and
relays. This problem might no
longer be so bad next year with
the addition of two freshman
sprinters from Texas.
Sprint Help
The first of the two is Ken Curl
a Houston product who ran a 9.3
hundred when he was 15 years
old. Curl was the state champ in
this event in both 1968 and 1969.
He will be joined by Rupert Shaw,
the 1970 state champ in 9.5.
Shaw has also run a 46.2 440 leg
on a mile relay team.
The announcement of Curl and
Shaw's coming enrollment was
made at yesterday's track and
field luncheon by assistant coach
Bill Moultrie. Moultrie was
responsible for recruiting both
athletes.
