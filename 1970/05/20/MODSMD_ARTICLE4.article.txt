## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
VIENNA-A large group of
Stanford and other American
university students attending
school in this Austrian capital
staged a non-violent,
non-disruptive protest at the
American Embassy last Thursday
night and Friday morning.
The protestors expressed their
outrage at the invasion of
Cambodia and called upon
President Nixon "to immediately
withdraw all U.S. troops now in
Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam and
leave those people free to
determine their own destiny."
At the conclusion of their vigil,
the protestors left a red, white,
and blue wreath in the shape of a
peace symbol at the Embassy
door.
Earlier in the day, a smaller
group met with Embassy officials
to express their distress at the
Cambodian invasion and to

demonstrate support and faith in
the SALT (Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks) Conference now
underway in Vienna.
Letters and petitions urged the
U.S. to "divert its energy and
resources from destructive
military action to constructive
international cooperation as
exemplified by SALT."
The Stanford representative to
the Embassy was David Coleman,
president of the current
Stanford-in-Austria student body
of 80. Other students represented
Union College, Kent State,
University of Oregon and tiny
Central College in Pella, lowa.
Since foreign students are not
allowed to demonstrate in
Austria, the American contingent
had to join forces with a Viennese
student organization called
"Aktion fur Frieden und
Abrustung." About 75 Americans
participated.
