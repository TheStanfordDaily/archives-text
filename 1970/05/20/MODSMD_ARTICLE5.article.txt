## Clash On Youth Problems 
### 
Two Congressmen, both
pushing 60, squabbled heatedly
over what makes youthful protest
tick in a question-and-answer
session Monday.
Senator Abraham Ribicoff
(D.-Conn.) and Rep. Harley
Staggers (D.-W.Va.) crossed
swords in a discussion of a
just-released federal commission
report on the "Mental Health of
Children."
The 600-page report called
America's treatment of the young
"a national disgrace," and said
that 10 million young people in
America need mental health help
and are not getting it.
The report sparked an
impassioned reply from Ribicoff,
who endorsed the report's
statement that "we blind
ourselves to the fact that we
create most of the social problems
of our young which we so
deplore: discontent, apathy,
violence, and destruction."
Said Ribicoff, "1 don't think
these (dissenting) college kids are
sick at all â€”it's the older
generation that's wrong. There's
too many of us in Congress that
are too goddamn old. We sit
smugly in the Congress and the
Executive and we think we have
all the answers."
"The time has come to listen to
these young people, because the
problems of society are not going
to be solved by a bunch of
70-year-old men."
The report called racism "the
number one public health
problem," and said that black first
graders in one section of Chicago
ran nine times the chance of being
psychologically disturbed as their
white peers.
The report, a four-year project
involving more than 600
specialists, said that no
community has adequate mental
health care for children and young
adults.
Rep. Staggers saw another
source of trouble. Clearly angered
at Ribicoff's remarks, the 62-year
old Congressman said, "I think

somebody's going nuts in this
country."
"The whole solution of the
whole problem is in the
homes ... If the fathers and
mothers of this country would
take a little control of their
children, this wouldn't
happen . . . but they're out
smoking and drinking and they're
scared of their kids."
Kent State
The autopsy report on the four
students killed at Kent state
confirmed that the bullets used
were military-type bullets.
"The wounds were caused by
bullets similar to .30-caliber
military ammunition," said
Portage County Coroner Dr.
Rober Sybert. "Whether these
deaths are accidental or homicidal
is undetermined and under
continuing inquiry at this time."
There had been some question
as to whether military-type
weapons were involved in the
killings. A doctor who treated one
of the wounded students said he
did not believe the youth was shot
with a military weapon.
Atigela Davis
The Academic Senate at UCLA
has voted to insure that Angela
Davis will be able to teach next
year at UCLA no matter what
decision the University of
California regents reach.
The senate, the most powerful
faculty organization on campus,
said Monday it would arrange for
Miss Davis to teach next year with
full salary and benefits and would
see to it that students taking her
class received full credit.
Last week, the regents took the
decision of whether or not to
rehire Miss Davis, an avowed
Communist, out of the hands of
UCLA Chancellor Charles Young.
They are expected to fire her
despite a recommendation from
Young on her behalf.
Young said earlier in the day
that the regents' decision to take

over the case themselves could
have several unpleasant
repercussions, including a decline
of the university's stature and its
inability to attract and retain
high-caliber teachers.
He speculated further that a
deterioration of morale and
exodus of the faculty at UCLA
could also follow a decision to fire
the assistant professor of
philosophy.
Strike Over
Teamster pickets were
withdrawn yesterday from key
points in San Francisco as the
main strike dispute in Los Angeles
showed signs of being resolved.
The picket lines, which have
long tied up both long-haul and
local shipping, were withdrawn
during the night, and trucks began
moving once again on the
waterfront and at the airport.
A few pickets in the East Bay
were reported still up, but Local
70 in Alameda County announced
that its men had gone back to
work at 14 major firms and
terminals.
The break quickly followed
reports that nine terminals in Los
Angeles had signed agreements
granting amnesty to about 3000
drivers who had participated in
the six-week wildcat strike.
The California Trucking
Association said 500 "hard core
troublemakers" won't be rehired.
A spokesman added: "It took a
six-week strike costing millions of
dollars to get rid of about 500
dissidents, but it may have been
worth it."
Southern California Teamsters
Union headquarters had no
immediate comment.
Nonstriking drivers kept
perishables and goods involving
public need moving during the
walkout, but many businesses
were hard hit. The garment
industry reported a near
shutdown due to shortage of raw
materials.
