# Read It Carefully
## ROTC Poll 'Incredibly Biased' 
### ROTC 44 
Within the next few days, some
14,000 members of the Stanford
community will be receiving a
mail poll from the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC.
The wording of this poll is
incredibly biased, and it is urgent
that members of this community
be fully informed about the
consequences of each option and
the necessity for a write-in vote
on question VIII: "The Role of
ROTC on the Stanford Campus."
There are four options given: a)
ROTC as an organized, official
activity with academic credit; b)
ROTC as an organized, official
activity without academic credit;
c) ROTC as a Voluntary Student
Organization and d) ROTC not
on campus, even as a Voluntary
Student Organization. The first
two options are reasonably
straightforward, and it is the
second option (b) which currently
prevails.
The latter two options are our
main concern. Before discussing
them, it is necessary to explain
what the category of "Voluntary
Student Organization" means.
The principal advantage of being a
Voluntary Student Organization is
as follows (as quoted from the
"Stanford University Bulletin,
Information, 1970," p. 39): "In
order to use University facilities
and/or the Stanford name, and in
order to advocate publicly a
position on a public issue, all
voluntary organizations must
register with the University
through the office of the Dean of
Students." The corollary to this
should be clear, and is confirmed
by the Dean of Students office:
groups which do not register as

Voluntary Student Organizations
are free to exist on this campus,
either as individuals or as a group;
they do not, however, qualify for
the use of University facilities
under this clause and may not
legally make use of the Stanford
name.
Misleading Alternatives
Options (c) and (d), then, do
not exhaust the possibilities, and
are quite misleading, particularly
in the "comment" below each
option. The clear implication of
these last two options is that
ROTC either must be a Voluntary
Student Organization or "should
not be allowed on campus at all."
That is a very dangerous and
inexcusably biased listing of the
alternatives. The two options, (c)
and (d), should be expanded into
at least threes 1) ROTC as a
Voluntary Student Organization,
with the concommitant use of
University facilities and the
Stanford name; 2) ROTC as an
informal group, not granted such
privileges, but nonetheless allowed
freedom of access, existence, and
assembly on the Stanford campus;
and 3) ROTC banned from the
Stanford campus, presumably
with members being shot on sight,
or arrested by local law
enforcement authorities. It should
be noted that items (2) and (3)
are very different: at least one
former member of the Stanford
community, Paul Rupert, faces
arrest should he enter Santa Clara
County; such excommunication is
thus a very real option, not just
frivolity.
The ''Comments''
accompanying options (c) and (d)
also deserve a few words. The
libertarian implication of
comment (c) is that any group
which desires it should be allowed
Voluntary Student Organization
status, and "ROTC would only
have the same unofficial status as
other voluntary groups, such as
SDS, the Young Republicans, or
The Daily." The fact is that "just
any ol' group" is not allowed
Voluntary Student Organization
status. To confirm this duplicity,
we called the Dean of Students
Office to see if the following
group might qualify as a
Voluntary Student Organization:
a Guerrilla Insurgency Training
Unit, which would teach people
how to use guns, grenades, and
bombs; the unit would be
affiliated with similar units at
other colleges, and it would
receive its training from "Guerrilla
Central" in Chicago. Several hours
later, after the report of such a
group spread rapidly through the

administration, we were phoned
back by the Dean of Students
Office and told that "the goals
and aims of Voluntary Student
Organizations should not be
contrary to the educational goals
of the University." Dean Bulkeley
declared such an organization to
be contrary to these goals, and
thus it was not eligible for
registration as a Voluntary
Student Organization.
The conclusion from this
interchange with the Dean of
Students Office should be clear,
and it is contrary to the
implications of the Comment for
option (c): there already exist
limitations upon which groups
may register as Voluntary Student
Organizations. That leads us to
the Comment for option (d),
probably the most inflammatory
part of the whole questionnaire.
This comment strongly suggests to
people that a McCarthy-styled
witch-hunt might be started if
option (d) were selected—that if
ROTC were the first to go, others
might well follow in being
exterminated. There is no support
for this insidious and irresponsible
innuendo, particularly when it
appears as the most extreme
position on a purportedly
objective ballot.
An Academic Community
This is an academic
community, and there are clearly
characteristics which differentiate
this community from society at
large. Classified research, it is now
widely accepted, does not belong
in an academic community where
the free exchange of ideas is
paramount. Blatant war research
also has no place in an academic
community dedicated to the
betterment of society. The fact is,
we are not setting a precedent;
that precedent already exists.
Last week on May 14, by a
17-9 vote, the Senate of the ASSU
strongly urged a restriction on
Voluntary Student Organizations
excluding military programs. Such
a restriction would legitimately
deny status to both a Guerrilla
Insurgency Training Unit and
ROTC. It would not single out
any one group; it would not
establish a witch-hunt precedent;
and it would consistently apply
the notion that teaching people
how to use armed force in the
implementation of goals is out of
keeping with the spirit of an
academic community. Such a
restriction would not descriminate
politically, as is currently the case,
but would simply say that certain
activities do not belong here—i.e.
teaching people how to

kill—regardless of their place on
the political spectrum.
None of the options on
question VIII of this ballot are
acceptable. We have no assurance
that option (c) would eliminate
ROTC, and option (d) has very
dangerous implications, as
worded. Consequently, we
advocate a write-in vote. We
strongly urge members of the
Stanford community to enter an
(112) option on the ballot for
question VIII, to read "no
organized military training at
Stanford." Put a box to the left of
that (112), and check it as your vote.
It is hereby stated that the full
content of option (112) is as follows:
1) ROTC is to have no organized,
official relationship with this
university; and 2) Groups whose
primary function is that of
organized military training, that
is, teaching how to use armed
force to attain strategic goals, are
antithetical to the principles and
goals of the academic community
and therefore shall not be eligible
for registration as Voluntary
Student Organizations."
The effect of the vote will be to
eliminate current official ties with
ROTC. The only other formal
relationship that such an
organization may have on this
campus is as a Voluntary Student
Organization. Entering and voting
option (112) will eliminate this
alternative to ROTC and any
other group whose function is to
teach techniques of armed force
in the implementation of goals.
Violent Weeks
This campus has undergone
some rather violent upheavals in
the last few weeks. Most
departments voted to go out on
strike for a week, and the ROTC
issue was one of the chief targets
of all this tumult.
Decision-making bodies on this
campus are gutless, and unwilling
to take a strong, principled stand
on virtually anything of
consequence. Now they are taking
a poll, an incredibly biased poll,
which works against an objective
analysis of the situation.
The military and the Trustees
are anxious to keep ROTC at
Stanford, in almost any form that
they can get it.
Off ROTC. Peace. Enter and
vote on the left-hand margin of
question VIII:
(112) No organized military
training at Stanford.

ROTC 44, a group of students
who have sat in at the ROTC
building and chosen to go before

acceptable. We have no assurance
that option (c) would eliminate
ROTC, and option (d) has very
dangerous implications, as
worded. Consequently, we
advocate a write-in vote. We
strongly urge members of the
Stanford community to enter an
(112) option on the ballot for
question VIII, to read "no
organized military training at
Stanford." Put a box to the left of
that (112), and check it as your vote.
It is hereby stated that the full
content of option (112) is as follows:
1) ROTC is to have no organized,
official relationship with this
university; and 2) Groups whose
primary function is that of
organized military training, that
is, teaching how to use armed
force to attain strategic goals, are
antithetical to the principles and
goals of the academic community
and therefore shall not be eligible
for registration as Voluntary
Student Organizations."
The effect of the vote will be to
eliminate current official ties with
ROTC. The only other formal
relationship that such an
organization may have on this
campus is as a Voluntary Student
Organization. Entering and voting
option (112) will eliminate this
alternative to ROTC and any
other group whose function is to
teach techniques of armed force
in the implementation of goals.
Violent Weeks
This campus has undergone
some rather violent upheavals in
the last few weeks. Most
departments voted to go out on
strike for a week, and the ROTC
issue was one of the chief targets
of all this tumult.
Decision-making bodies on this
campus are gutless, and unwilling
to take a strong, principled stand
on virtually anything of
consequence. Now they are taking
a poll, an incredibly biased poll,
which works against an objective
analysis of the situation.
The military and the Trustees
are anxious to keep ROTC at
Stanford, in almost any form that
they can get it.
Off ROTC. Peace. Enter and
vote on the left-hand margin of
question VIII:
(112) No organized military
training at Stanford.
(This column is signed by the
ROTC 44, a group of students
who have sat in at the ROTC
building and chosen to go before
the SJC for sentencing.)

Within the next few days, some
14,000 members of the Stanford
community will be receiving a
mail poll from the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC.
The wording of this poll is
incredibly biased, and it is urgent
that members of this community
be fully informed about the
consequences of each option and
the necessity for a write-in vote
on question VIII: "The Role of
ROTC on the Stanford Campus."
There are four options given: a)
ROTC as an organized, official
activity with academic credit; b)
ROTC as an organized, official
activity without academic credit;
c) ROTC as a Voluntary Student
Organization and d) ROTC not
on campus, even as a Voluntary
Student Organization. The first
two options are reasonably
straightforward, and it is the
second option (b) which currently
prevails.
The latter two options are our
main concern. Before discussing
them, it is necessary to explain
what the category of "Voluntary
Student Organization" means.
The principal advantage of being a
Voluntary Student Organization is
as follows (as quoted from the
"Stanford University Bulletin,
Information, 1970," p. 39): "In
order to use University facilities
and/or the Stanford name, and in
order to advocate publicly a
position on a public issue, all
voluntary organizations must
register with the University
through the office of the Dean of
Students." The corollary to this
should be clear, and is confirmed
by the Dean of Students office:
groups which do not register as

Voluntary Student Organizations
are free to exist on this campus,
either as individuals or as a group;
they do not, however, qualify for
the use of University facilities
under this clause and may not
legally make use of the Stanford
name.
Misleading Alternatives
Options (c) and (d), then, do
not exhaust the possibilities, and
are quite misleading, particularly
in the "comment" below each
option. The clear implication of
these last two options is that
ROTC either must be a Voluntary
Student Organization or "should
not be allowed on campus at all."
That is a very dangerous and
inexcusably biased listing of the
alternatives. The two options, (c)
and (d), should be expanded into
at least threes 1) ROTC as a
Voluntary Student Organization,
with the concommitant use of
University facilities and the
Stanford name; 2) ROTC as an
informal group, not granted such
privileges, but nonetheless allowed
freedom of access, existence, and
assembly on the Stanford campus;
and 3) ROTC banned from the
Stanford campus, presumably
with members being shot on sight,
or arrested by local law
enforcement authorities. It should
be noted that items (2) and (3)
are very different: at least one
former member of the Stanford
community, Paul Rupert, faces
arrest should he enter Santa Clara
County; such excommunication is
thus a very real option, not just
frivolity.
The ''Comments''
accompanying options (c) and (d)
also deserve a few words. The
libertarian implication of
comment (c) is that any group
which desires it should be allowed
Voluntary Student Organization
status, and "ROTC would only
have the same unofficial status as
other voluntary groups, such as
SDS, the Young Republicans, or
The Daily." The fact is that "just
any ol' group" is not allowed
Voluntary Student Organization
status. To confirm this duplicity,
we called the Dean of Students
Office to see if the following
group might qualify as a
Voluntary Student Organization:
a Guerrilla Insurgency Training
Unit, which would teach people
how to use guns, grenades, and
bombs; the unit would be
affiliated with similar units at
other colleges, and it would
receive its training from "Guerrilla
Central" in Chicago. Several hours
later, after the report of such a
group spread rapidly through the

administration, we were phoned
back by the Dean of Students
Office and told that "the goals
and aims of Voluntary Student
Organizations should not be
contrary to the educational goals
of the University." Dean Bulkeley
declared such an organization to
be contrary to these goals, and
thus it was not eligible for
registration as a Voluntary
Student Organization.
The conclusion from this
interchange with the Dean of
Students Office should be clear,
and it is contrary to the
implications of the Comment for
option (c): there already exist
limitations upon which groups
may register as Voluntary Student
Organizations. That leads us to
the Comment for option (d),
probably the most inflammatory
part of the whole questionnaire.
This comment strongly suggests to
people that a McCarthy-styled
witch-hunt might be started if
option (d) were selected—that if
ROTC were the first to go, others
might well follow in being
exterminated. There is no support
for this insidious and irresponsible
innuendo, particularly when it
appears as the most extreme
position on a purportedly
objective ballot.
An Academic Community
This is an academic
community, and there are clearly
characteristics which differentiate
this community from society at
large. Classified research, it is now
widely accepted, does not belong
in an academic community where
the free exchange of ideas is
paramount. Blatant war research
also has no place in an academic
community dedicated to the
betterment of society. The fact is,
we are not setting a precedent;
that precedent already exists.
Last week on May 14, by a
17-9 vote, the Senate of the ASSU
strongly urged a restriction on
Voluntary Student Organizations
excluding military programs. Such
a restriction would legitimately
deny status to both a Guerrilla
Insurgency Training Unit and
ROTC. It would not single out
any one group; it would not
establish a witch-hunt precedent;
and it would consistently apply
the notion that teaching people
how to use armed force in the
implementation of goals is out of
keeping with the spirit of an
academic community. Such a
restriction would not descriminate
politically, as is currently the case,
but would simply say that certain
activities do not belong here—i.e.
teaching people how to

kill—regardless of their place on
the political spectrum.
None of the options on
question VIII of this ballot are
acceptable. We have no assurance
that option (c) would eliminate
ROTC, and option (d) has very
dangerous implications, as
worded. Consequently, we
advocate a write-in vote. We
strongly urge members of the

contrary to the educational goals
of the University." Dean Bulkeley
declared such an organization to
be contrary to these goals, and
thus it was not eligible for
registration as a Voluntary
Student Organization.
The conclusion from this
interchange with the Dean of
Students Office should be clear,
and it is contrary to the
implications of the Comment for
option (c): there already exist
limitations upon which groups
may register as Voluntary Student
Organizations. That leads us to
the Comment for option (d),
probably the most inflammatory
part of the whole questionnaire.
This comment strongly suggests to
people that a McCarthy-styled
witch-hunt might be started if
option (d) were selected—that if
ROTC were the first to go, others
might well follow in being
exterminated. There is no support
for this insidious and irresponsible
innuendo, particularly when it
appears as the most extreme
position on a purportedly
objective ballot.
An Academic Community
This is an academic
community, and there are clearly
characteristics which differentiate
this community from society at
large. Classified research, it is now
widely accepted, does not belong
in an academic community where
the free exchange of ideas is
paramount. Blatant war research
also has no place in an academic
community dedicated to the
betterment of society. The fact is,
we are not setting a precedent;
that precedent already exists.
Last week on May 14, by a
17-9 vote, the Senate of the ASSU
strongly urged a restriction on
Voluntary Student Organizations
excluding military programs. Such
a restriction would legitimately
deny status to both a Guerrilla
Insurgency Training Unit and
ROTC. It would not single out
any one group; it would not
establish a witch-hunt precedent;
and it would consistently apply
the notion that teaching people
how to use armed force in the
implementation of goals is out of
keeping with the spirit of an
academic community. Such a
restriction would not descriminate
politically, as is currently the case,
but would simply say that certain
activities do not belong here—i.e.
teaching people how to

kill—regardless of their place on
the political spectrum.
None of the options on
question VIII of this ballot are
acceptable. We have no assurance
that option (c) would eliminate
ROTC, and option (d) has very
dangerous implications, as
worded. Consequently, we
advocate a write-in vote. We
strongly urge members of the
Stanford community to enter an
(112) option on the ballot for
question VIII, to read "no
organized military training at
Stanford." Put a box to the left of
that (112), and check it as your vote.
It is hereby stated that the full
content of option (112) is as follows:
1) ROTC is to have no organized,
official relationship with this
university; and 2) Groups whose
primary function is that of
organized military training, that
is, teaching how to use armed
force to attain strategic goals, are
antithetical to the principles and
goals of the academic community
and therefore shall not be eligible
for registration as Voluntary
Student Organizations."
The effect of the vote will be to
eliminate current official ties with
ROTC. The only other formal
relationship that such an
organization may have on this
campus is as a Voluntary Student
Organization. Entering and voting
option (112) will eliminate this
alternative to ROTC and any
other group whose function is to
teach techniques of armed force
in the implementation of goals.
Violent Weeks
This campus has undergone
some rather violent upheavals in
the last few weeks. Most
departments voted to go out on
strike for a week, and the ROTC
issue was one of the chief targets
of all this tumult.
Decision-making bodies on this
campus are gutless, and unwilling
to take a strong, principled stand
on virtually anything of
consequence. Now they are taking
a poll, an incredibly biased poll,
which works against an objective
analysis of the situation.
The military and the Trustees
are anxious to keep ROTC at
Stanford, in almost any form that
they can get it.
Off ROTC. Peace. Enter and
vote on the left-hand margin of
question VIII:
(112) No organized military
training at Stanford.
(This column is signed by the
ROTC 44, a group of students
who have sat in at the ROTC
building and chosen to go before
the SJC for sentencing.)

Within the next few days, some
14,000 members of the Stanford
community will be receiving a
mail poll from the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC.
The wording of this poll is
incredibly biased, and it is urgent
that members of this community
be fully informed about the
consequences of each option and
the necessity for a write-in vote
on question VIII: "The Role of
ROTC on the Stanford Campus."
There are four options given: a)
ROTC as an organized, official
activity with academic credit; b)
ROTC as an organized, official
activity without academic credit;
c) ROTC as a Voluntary Student
Organization and d) ROTC not
on campus, even as a Voluntary
Student Organization. The first
two options are reasonably
straightforward, and it is the
second option (b) which currently
prevails.
The latter two options are our
main concern. Before discussing
them, it is necessary to explain
what the category of "Voluntary
Student Organization" means.
The principal advantage of being a
Voluntary Student Organization is
as follows (as quoted from the
"Stanford University Bulletin,
Information, 1970," p. 39): "In
order to use University facilities
and/or the Stanford name, and in
order to advocate publicly a
position on a public issue, all
voluntary organizations must
register with the University
through the office of the Dean of
Students." The corollary to this
should be clear, and is confirmed
by the Dean of Students office:
groups which do not register as

Voluntary Student Organizations
are free to exist on this campus,
either as individuals or as a group;
they do not, however, qualify for
the use of University facilities
under this clause and may not
legally make use of the Stanford
name.
Misleading Alternatives
Options (c) and (d), then, do
not exhaust the possibilities, and
are quite misleading, particularly
in the "comment" below each
option. The clear implication of
these last two options is that
ROTC either must be a Voluntary
Student Organization or "should
not be allowed on campus at all."
That is a very dangerous and
inexcusably biased listing of the
alternatives. The two options, (c)
and (d), should be expanded into
at least threes 1) ROTC as a
Voluntary Student Organization,
with the concommitant use of
University facilities and the
Stanford name; 2) ROTC as an
informal group, not granted such
privileges, but nonetheless allowed
freedom of access, existence, and
assembly on the Stanford campus;
and 3) ROTC banned from the
Stanford campus, presumably
with members being shot on sight,
or arrested by local law
enforcement authorities. It should
be noted that items (2) and (3)
are very different: at least one
former member of the Stanford
community, Paul Rupert, faces
arrest should he enter Santa Clara
County; such excommunication is
thus a very real option, not just
frivolity.
The ''Comments''
accompanying options (c) and (d)
also deserve a few words. The
libertarian implication of
comment (c) is that any group
which desires it should be allowed
Voluntary Student Organization
status, and "ROTC would only
have the same unofficial status as
other voluntary groups, such as
SDS, the Young Republicans, or
The Daily." The fact is that "just
any ol' group" is not allowed
Voluntary Student Organization
status. To confirm this duplicity,
we called the Dean of Students
Office to see if the following
group might qualify as a
Voluntary Student Organization:
a Guerrilla Insurgency Training
Unit, which would teach people
how to use guns, grenades, and
bombs; the unit would be
affiliated with similar units at
other colleges, and it would
receive its training from "Guerrilla
Central" in Chicago. Several hours
later, after the report of such a
group spread rapidly through the

administration, we were phoned
back by the Dean of Students
Office and told that "the goals
and aims of Voluntary Student
Organizations should not be
contrary to the educational goals
of the University." Dean Bulkeley
declared such an organization to
be contrary to these goals, and
thus it was not eligible for

The conclusion from this

not exhaust the possibilities, and
are quite misleading, particularly
in the "comment" below each
option. The clear implication of
these last two options is that
ROTC either must be a Voluntary
Student Organization or "should
not be allowed on campus at all."
That is a very dangerous and
inexcusably biased listing of the
alternatives. The two options, (c)
and (d), should be expanded into
at least threes 1) ROTC as a
Voluntary Student Organization,
with the concommitant use of
University facilities and the
Stanford name; 2) ROTC as an
informal group, not granted such
privileges, but nonetheless allowed
freedom of access, existence, and
assembly on the Stanford campus;
and 3) ROTC banned from the
Stanford campus, presumably
with members being shot on sight,
or arrested by local law
enforcement authorities. It should
be noted that items (2) and (3)
are very different: at least one
former member of the Stanford
community, Paul Rupert, faces
arrest should he enter Santa Clara
County; such excommunication is
thus a very real option, not just
frivolity.
The ''Comments''
accompanying options (c) and (d)
also deserve a few words. The
libertarian implication of
comment (c) is that any group
which desires it should be allowed
Voluntary Student Organization
status, and "ROTC would only
have the same unofficial status as
other voluntary groups, such as
SDS, the Young Republicans, or
The Daily." The fact is that "just
any ol' group" is not allowed
Voluntary Student Organization
status. To confirm this duplicity,
we called the Dean of Students
Office to see if the following
group might qualify as a
Voluntary Student Organization:
a Guerrilla Insurgency Training
Unit, which would teach people
how to use guns, grenades, and
bombs; the unit would be
affiliated with similar units at
other colleges, and it would
receive its training from "Guerrilla
Central" in Chicago. Several hours
later, after the report of such a
group spread rapidly through the

administration, we were phoned
back by the Dean of Students
Office and told that "the goals
and aims of Voluntary Student
Organizations should not be
contrary to the educational goals
of the University." Dean Bulkeley
declared such an organization to
be contrary to these goals, and
thus it was not eligible for
registration as a Voluntary
Student Organization.
The conclusion from this
interchange with the Dean of
Students Office should be clear,
and it is contrary to the
implications of the Comment for
option (c): there already exist
limitations upon which groups
may register as Voluntary Student
Organizations. That leads us to
the Comment for option (d),
probably the most inflammatory
part of the whole questionnaire.
This comment strongly suggests to
people that a McCarthy-styled
witch-hunt might be started if
option (d) were selected—that if
ROTC were the first to go, others
might well follow in being
exterminated. There is no support
for this insidious and irresponsible
innuendo, particularly when it
appears as the most extreme
position on a purportedly
objective ballot.
An Academic Community
This is an academic
community, and there are clearly
characteristics which differentiate
this community from society at
large. Classified research, it is now
widely accepted, does not belong
in an academic community where
the free exchange of ideas is
paramount. Blatant war research
also has no place in an academic
community dedicated to the
betterment of society. The fact is,
we are not setting a precedent;
that precedent already exists.
Last week on May 14, by a
17-9 vote, the Senate of the ASSU
strongly urged a restriction on
Voluntary Student Organizations
excluding military programs. Such
a restriction would legitimately
deny status to both a Guerrilla
Insurgency Training Unit and
ROTC. It would not single out
any one group; it would not
establish a witch-hunt precedent;
and it would consistently apply
the notion that teaching people
how to use armed force in the
implementation of goals is out of
keeping with the spirit of an
academic community. Such a
restriction would not descriminate
politically, as is currently the case,
but would simply say that certain
activities do not belong here—i.e.
teaching people how to

kill—regardless of their place on
the political spectrum.
None of the options on
question VIII of this ballot are
acceptable. We have no assurance
that option (c) would eliminate
ROTC, and option (d) has very
dangerous implications, as
worded. Consequently, we
advocate a write-in vote. We
strongly urge members of the
Stanford community to enter an
(112) option on the ballot for
question VIII, to read "no
organized military training at
Stanford." Put a box to the left of
that (112), and check it as your vote.
It is hereby stated that the full
content of option (112) is as follows:
1) ROTC is to have no organized,
official relationship with this
university; and 2) Groups whose
primary function is that of
organized military training, that
is, teaching how to use armed
force to attain strategic goals, are
antithetical to the principles and
goals of the academic community
and therefore shall not be eligible
for registration as Voluntary
Student Organizations."
The effect of the vote will be to
eliminate current official ties with
ROTC. The only other formal
relationship that such an
organization may have on this
campus is as a Voluntary Student
Organization. Entering and voting
option (112) will eliminate this
alternative to ROTC and any
other group whose function is to
teach techniques of armed force
in the implementation of goals.
Violent Weeks
This campus has undergone
some rather violent upheavals in
the last few weeks. Most
departments voted to go out on
strike for a week, and the ROTC
issue was one of the chief targets
of all this tumult.
Decision-making bodies on this
campus are gutless, and unwilling
to take a strong, principled stand
on virtually anything of
consequence. Now they are taking
a poll, an incredibly biased poll,
which works against an objective
analysis of the situation.
The military and the Trustees
are anxious to keep ROTC at
Stanford, in almost any form that
they can get it.
Off ROTC. Peace. Enter and
vote on the left-hand margin of
question VIII:
(112) No organized military
training at Stanford.
(This column is signed by the
ROTC 44, a group of students
who have sat in at the ROTC
building and chosen to go before
the SJC for sentencing.)

Within the next few days, some
14,000 members of the Stanford
community will be receiving a
mail poll from the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC.
The wording of this poll is
incredibly biased, and it is urgent
that members of this community
be fully informed about the
consequences of each option and
the necessity for a write-in vote
on question VIII: "The Role of
ROTC on the Stanford Campus."
There are four options given: a)
ROTC as an organized, official
activity with academic credit; b)
ROTC as an organized, official
activity without academic credit;
c) ROTC as a Voluntary Student
Organization and d) ROTC not
on campus, even as a Voluntary
Student Organization. The first
two options are reasonably
straightforward, and it is the
second option (b) which currently
prevails.
The latter two options are our
main concern. Before discussing
them, it is necessary to explain
what the category of "Voluntary
Student Organization" means.
The principal advantage of being a
Voluntary Student Organization is
as follows (as quoted from the
"Stanford University Bulletin,
Information, 1970," p. 39): "In
order to use University facilities
and/or the Stanford name, and in
order to advocate publicly a
position on a public issue, all
voluntary organizations must
register with the University
through the office of the Dean of
Students." The corollary to this
should be clear, and is confirmed
by the Dean of Students office:
groups which do not register as

Voluntary Student Organizations
are free to exist on this campus,
either as individuals or as a group;
they do not, however, qualify for
the use of University facilities
under this clause and may not
legally make use of the Stanford
name.
Misleading Alternatives
Options (c) and (d), then, do
not exhaust the possibilities, and
are quite misleading, particularly
in the "comment" below each
option. The clear implication of
