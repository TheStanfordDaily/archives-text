# Armed Farces Day
## Military's Fort Ord Fiasco 
### Clyde Summerville 
Across our majestic mountains and fruited plains, May 16 is
traditionally known as Armed Forces Day. On this day, much like
May Day in the Kremlin's Red Square, our military commanders have
the opportunity to proudly display to the general public their shiny
weapons and well oiled soldiers. More accurately this is a chance for
the citizens to discover what his tax dollars have been doing lately.
May 16, at Fort Ord this year was no exception.
Early Satu day morning a binoculared G.I. in full battle dress
surveys his fi< Id of vision from a tall watch tower on the post. Below
and in front of him a few cars heading in the direction of Monterey
slip by on Route 1. Beyond the highway the firing ranges of the basic

and advanced infantry training areas are quiet and empty. Downed
telephone poles and barricades block access roads to the base. On
either side of the tower trenches, freshly dug the day before, extend
hundreds of yards. Beyond the trenches lie long coils of concertina
wire; not the old fashioned barbed wire, but a new and improved
version sporting miniature razor blades throughout.
Jeeps driven by riot control troops carrying rifles, bayonets, flak
vests, gas masks, and special two-way radios slowly patrol the
perimeter. Three helicopters equipped with tear gas rockets rest with
drooping blades at a nearby air field. Behind the tower are poised
several large troop trucks and armored personnel carriers. Hunkered
down behind the walls of the sickly, government green command post
lurk the brass; controllers of the 40,000 men on base. Rifles,
ammunition, machine guns, and gas grenades; all is in readiness. The
military has done it again.
This was the scene that greeted the protesters as they peacefully
picketed Fort Ord on Saturday, May 16, Armed Farces Day.
Brass-Run Military
The idea of an Armed Farces Day was the brainchild of the
Movement For A Democif.tic Military. The MDM recognizes that our
brass-run military exists today as a separate fascist community that
flatly denies to the G.l.'s even the most basic human and
constitutional rights. The Movement at Fort Ord is organized by
G.l.'s, students, and workers, and operates out of a coffee house on
Del Monte Street in Seaside near the post. The original plan for the
16th was for all interested people to go on to the base, this day open
to thy public, and rap with the G.l.'s to let them know that there are
many people supporting them in their fight against the brass-instigated
oppression.
All plans were moving along well until late last week when the base
commander declared the post closed to the public over the weekend.
The Movement organizers, realizing that they could now not enter the
base, decided to modify their plans and to march from Marina, a
community north of the fort, to the main gate of the base and then
back to Marina to hold a rally on the beach.
The march was to be peaceful and orderly with all participants
walking single file along the edge of the highway. Over one hundred
march monitors were assigned various groups in the procession and all
were linked by walkie-talkie. Medics were spread along the line of
march to provide water and to distribute salt tablets to the victims of
the sun. These arrangements were discussed and approved by both the
Monterey County Sheriff and the California Highway Patrol. All
preparations were public information.
No Cooperation
Most authorities offered no cooperation whatsoever. Monterey
officials first refused the Movement permission to have the rally in a
local park. On Friday afternoon, less than a day before the march, the
city officials of Marina, a community inhabited largely by retired
career army officers, not only closed the public beach on which the
rally was scheduled to be held, but suspended all parking within the
Marina city limits until Sunday night. The organizers of the Movement
were no less surprised by this move than were the police who later
said that they would not enforce the new regulations due to the short
notice.
Within the military community defensive preparations went on all
week. The post commander appeared on television and stated that
weekend leaves would be granted as usual. He neglected to mention
however that all G.l.'s were given weekend duty on the base by their
company commanders. These same commanders saw to it that all men
not in riot control squads would be restricted to their individual
company barracks area during the time when the protesters would be
passing by the base.
One G.I. told me that his sergeant said that they were restricted for
safety measures due to the fact that, "the hippies are buying hand
grenades in San Francisco." Fearing more internal problems, late in
the week the three hundred men imprisoned in the base stockade were
bussed off the post to a nearby military compound, "for the
weekend." On Friday morning the order came down to all men on
riot duty that they would face punishment for returning the peace
sign to demonstrators.
Three G.l.'s Busted
On Saturday afternoon I talked to three G.l.'s in the M P. station
who were busted on this peace sign offense. The charge was,
"disobeying the lawful order of a general." On top of this, no
reporters were permitted to go into the interior of the base to talk to
the G.l.'s restricted to barracks. Around this framework of friendship
and cooperation the march occurred.
At two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, under the watchful eyes of
the U.S. Army helicopters, the last of some four thousand
demonstrators filed past the main gate of the base. The victory lay in
the situation of the non-violent marchers peacefully picketing the
base, armed to the teeth and ready to defend against all manner of
foreign invasion.
By about two-thirty the concertina wire was rolled back from the
entrances and the sentries came down from the vwitchtowers. The
brass hunkered down behind their sickly green walls and
congratulated each other on how they had saved their post from
violation by the longhairs, and the G.l.'s returned to their barracks
from riot duty laughing just a little about how their omnipotent
rulers, the brass, had truly been defeated by the people.

were linked by walkie-talkie. Medics were spread along the line of
march to provide water and to distribute salt tablets to the victims of
the sun. These arrangements were discussed and approved by both the
Monterey County Sheriff and the California Highway Patrol. All
preparations were public information.
No Cooperation
Most authorities offered no cooperation whatsoever. Monterey
officials first refused the Movement permission to have the rally in a
local park. On Friday afternoon, less than a day before the march, the
city officials of Marina, a community inhabited largely by retired
career army officers, not only closed the public beach on which the
rally was scheduled to be held, but suspended all parking within the
Marina city limits until Sunday night. The organizers of the Movement
were no less surprised by this move than were the police who later
said that they would not enforce the new regulations due to the short
notice.
Within the military community defensive preparations went on all
week. The post commander appeared on television and stated that
weekend leaves would be granted as usual. He neglected to mention
however that all G.l.'s were given weekend duty on the base by their
company commanders. These same commanders saw to it that all men
not in riot control squads would be restricted to their individual
company barracks area during the time when the protesters would be
passing by the base.
One G.I. told me that his sergeant said that they were restricted for
safety measures due to the fact that, "the hippies are buying hand
grenades in San Francisco." Fearing more internal problems, late in
the week the three hundred men imprisoned in the base stockade were
bussed off the post to a nearby military compound, "for the
weekend." On Friday morning the order came down to all men on
riot duty that they would face punishment for returning the peace
sign to demonstrators.
Three G.l.'s Busted
On Saturday afternoon I talked to three G.l.'s in the M P. station
who were busted on this peace sign offense. The charge was,
"disobeying the lawful order of a general." On top of this, no
reporters were permitted to go into the interior of the base to talk to
the G.l.'s restricted to barracks. Around this framework of friendship
and cooperation the march occurred.
At two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, under the watchful eyes of
the U.S. Army helicopters, the last of some four thousand
demonstrators filed past the main gate of the base. The victory lay in
the situation of the non-violent marchers peacefully picketing the
base, armed to the teeth and ready to defend against all manner of
foreign invasion.
By about two-thirty the concertina wire was rolled back from the
entrances and the sentries came down from the vwitchtowers. The
brass hunkered down behind their sickly green walls and
congratulated each other on how they had saved their post from
violation by the longhairs, and the G.l.'s returned to their barracks
from riot duty laughing just a little about how their omnipotent
rulers, the brass, had truly been defeated by the people.

Across our majestic mountains and fruited plains, May 16 is
traditionally known as Armed Forces Day. On this day, much like
May Day in the Kremlin's Red Square, our military commanders have
the opportunity to proudly display to the general public their shiny
weapons and well oiled soldiers. More accurately this is a chance for
the citizens to discover what his tax dollars have been doing lately.
May 16, at Fort Ord this year was no exception.
Early Satu day morning a binoculared G.I. in full battle dress
surveys his fi< Id of vision from a tall watch tower on the post. Below
and in front of him a few cars heading in the direction of Monterey
slip by on Route 1. Beyond the highway the firing ranges of the basic

and advanced infantry training areas are quiet and empty. Downed
telephone poles and barricades block access roads to the base. On
either side of the tower trenches, freshly dug the day before, extend
hundreds of yards. Beyond the trenches lie long coils of concertina
wire; not the old fashioned barbed wire, but a new and improved
version sporting miniature razor blades throughout.
Jeeps driven by riot control troops carrying rifles, bayonets, flak
vests, gas masks, and special two-way radios slowly patrol the
perimeter. Three helicopters equipped with tear gas rockets rest with
drooping blades at a nearby air field. Behind the tower are poised
several large troop trucks and armored personnel carriers. Hunkered
down behind the walls of the sickly, government green command post
lurk the brass; controllers of the 40,000 men on base. Rifles,
ammunition, machine guns, and gas grenades; all is in readiness. The
military has done it again.
This was the scene that greeted the protesters as they peacefully
picketed Fort Ord on Saturday, May 16, Armed Farces Day.
Brass-Run Military
The idea of an Armed Farces Day was the brainchild of the
Movement For A Democif.tic Military. The MDM recognizes that our
brass-run military exists today as a separate fascist community that
flatly denies to the G.l.'s even the most basic human and
constitutional rights. The Movement at Fort Ord is organized by
G.l.'s, students, and workers, and operates out of a coffee house on
Del Monte Street in Seaside near the post. The original plan for the
16th was for all interested people to go on to the base, this day open
to thy public, and rap with the G.l.'s to let them know that there are
many people supporting them in their fight against the brass-instigated
oppression.
All plans were moving along well until late last week when the base
commander declared the post closed to the public over the weekend.
The Movement organizers, realizing that they could now not enter the
base, decided to modify their plans and to march from Marina, a
community north of the fort, to the main gate of the base and then
back to Marina to hold a rally on the beach.
The march was to be peaceful and orderly with all participants
walking single file along the edge of the highway. Over one hundred
march monitors were assigned various groups in the procession and all
were linked by walkie-talkie. Medics were spread along the line of

Across our majestic mountains and fruited plains, May 16 is
traditionally known as Armed Forces Day. On this day, much like
May Day in the Kremlin's Red Square, our military commanders have
the opportunity to proudly display to the general public their shiny
weapons and well oiled soldiers. More accurately this is a chance for
the citizens to discover what his tax dollars have been doing lately.
May 16, at Fort Ord this year was no exception.
Early Satu day morning a binoculared G.I. in full battle dress
surveys his fi< Id of vision from a tall watch tower on the post. Below
and in front of him a few cars heading in the direction of Monterey
slip by on Route 1. Beyond the highway the firing ranges of the basic

and advanced infantry training areas are quiet and empty. Downed
telephone poles and barricades block access roads to the base. On
either side of the tower trenches, freshly dug the day before, extend
hundreds of yards. Beyond the trenches lie long coils of concertina
wire; not the old fashioned barbed wire, but a new and improved
version sporting miniature razor blades throughout.
Jeeps driven by riot control troops carrying rifles, bayonets, flak
vests, gas masks, and special two-way radios slowly patrol the
perimeter. Three helicopters equipped with tear gas rockets rest with
drooping blades at a nearby air field. Behind the tower are poised
several large troop trucks and armored personnel carriers. Hunkered
down behind the walls of the sickly, government green command post
lurk the brass; controllers of the 40,000 men on base. Rifles,
ammunition, machine guns, and gas grenades; all is in readiness. The
military has done it again.
This was the scene that greeted the protesters as they peacefully
picketed Fort Ord on Saturday, May 16, Armed Farces Day.
Brass-Run Military
The idea of an Armed Farces Day was the brainchild of the
Movement For A Democif.tic Military. The MDM recognizes that our
brass-run military exists today as a separate fascist community that
flatly denies to the G.l.'s even the most basic human and
constitutional rights. The Movement at Fort Ord is organized by
G.l.'s, students, and workers, and operates out of a coffee house on
Del Monte Street in Seaside near the post. The original plan for the
16th was for all interested people to go on to the base, this day open
to thy public, and rap with the G.l.'s to let them know that there are
many people supporting them in their fight against the brass-instigated
oppression.
All plans were moving along well until late last week when the base
commander declared the post closed to the public over the weekend.
The Movement organizers, realizing that they could now not enter the
base, decided to modify their plans and to march from Marina, a
community north of the fort, to the main gate of the base and then
back to Marina to hold a rally on the beach.
The march was to be peaceful and orderly with all participants
walking single file along the edge of the highway. Over one hundred
march monitors were assigned various groups in the procession and all
were linked by walkie-talkie. Medics were spread along the line of
march to provide water and to distribute salt tablets to the victims of
the sun. These arrangements were discussed and approved by both the
Monterey County Sheriff and the California Highway Patrol. All
preparations were public information.
No Cooperation
Most authorities offered no cooperation whatsoever. Monterey
officials first refused the Movement permission to have the rally in a
local park. On Friday afternoon, less than a day before the march, the
city officials of Marina, a community inhabited largely by retired
career army officers, not only closed the public beach on which the
rally was scheduled to be held, but suspended all parking within the
Marina city limits until Sunday night. The organizers of the Movement
were no less surprised by this move than were the police who later
said that they would not enforce the new regulations due to the short
notice.
Within the military community defensive preparations went on all
week. The post commander appeared on television and stated that
weekend leaves would be granted as usual. He neglected to mention
however that all G.l.'s were given weekend duty on the base by their
company commanders. These same commanders saw to it that all men
not in riot control squads would be restricted to their individual
company barracks area during the time when the protesters would be
passing by the base.
One G.I. told me that his sergeant said that they were restricted for
safety measures due to the fact that, "the hippies are buying hand
grenades in San Francisco." Fearing more internal problems, late in
the week the three hundred men imprisoned in the base stockade were
bussed off the post to a nearby military compound, "for the
weekend." On Friday morning the order came down to all men on
riot duty that they would face punishment for returning the peace
sign to demonstrators.
Three G.l.'s Busted
On Saturday afternoon I talked to three G.l.'s in the M P. station
who were busted on this peace sign offense. The charge was,
"disobeying the lawful order of a general." On top of this, no
reporters were permitted to go into the interior of the base to talk to
the G.l.'s restricted to barracks. Around this framework of friendship
and cooperation the march occurred.
At two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, under the watchful eyes of
the U.S. Army helicopters, the last of some four thousand
demonstrators filed past the main gate of the base. The victory lay in
the situation of the non-violent marchers peacefully picketing the
base, armed to the teeth and ready to defend against all manner of
foreign invasion.
By about two-thirty the concertina wire was rolled back from the
entrances and the sentries came down from the vwitchtowers. The
brass hunkered down behind their sickly green walls and
congratulated each other on how they had saved their post from
violation by the longhairs, and the G.l.'s returned to their barracks
from riot duty laughing just a little about how their omnipotent
rulers, the brass, had truly been defeated by the people.
