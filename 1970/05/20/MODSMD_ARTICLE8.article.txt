# Irrational "Rampages"
## Random Rockthrowing 
### Joshua Lederberg 
The column that follows was
published in the Washington Post
for May 9. It voiced my anxieties
about the random violence that
had infected many campuses in
recent months. It was written
before I had news of the tragic
climax at Kent State University.
The mass protest against the
President's Cambodian policy is a
style of politically relevant action
totally different from the
hit-and-run vandalism of the
radical minority. From it, hope
may still emerge. The President
and the Congress dare not
underestimate how much is at
stake.

REHOVOTH, Israel. Despite
the dateline, this column concerns
Stanford University, California.
My business here is to attend the
formal inauguration of Dr. Albert
Sabin, the developer of the oral
vaccine now used throughout the
world, as the new president of the
Weizmann Institute. But my
thoughts return to the
battleground of the university,
and the incredible question as to
whether it can survive as an
institution of free inquiry.
The violence on the campus, let
it not be forgotten for a moment,
cannot begin to compare with the
violence that ravages Southeast
Asia even during a phase labelled
as a de-escalation. If by some
miracle, an exhibition of civic
violence were the key to a
dissolution of global conflicts, a
moral extenuation, if not
justification, would be irrefutable.
The sit-in's that led to
desegregation in the South were a
direct confrontation with a
particular law to test its moral and
constitutional foundations. Such
confrontations are not merely a
tolerable, they are an almost
indispensable, part of a legal
system that depends on test cases
for the evolution of timely law.
The rampages we have seen in
California exhibit an almost
random choice of targets. Can
anyone rationally believe that
arson will force the Nixon
administration to alter its program
for disengagement in Vietnam? Or
will it rather reinforce the
purposes of a vigilant and
powerful right to invoke its
traditional penal approaches for
the queting of dissent?
Asian Withdrawal
It is beyond any doubt at this
time that we will extract ourselves
from Southeast Asia. Today's
overriding threat to our liberties is
in the style with which we can
accomodate and settle our
differences. Every voluntary act
of violence is a threat to my
personal freedom, no matter
where it is directed, for it pushes

our society closer to the point
where my liberty will depend on
the size of my own gun. I have no
illusions about the area of
personal freedom today; but it is
vastly greater than any citizen can
carve out of the jungle by his own
devices.
University campuses have so
little direct authority over crucial
national decisions that none of
our eruptions can have a sensible
relationship to concrete policy
decisions. We are the frontier
where the life of the past meets
the future. Much of our ferment
comes from an understandable
anger at the legacy that is
transmitted, but is also amplified
and criticized here. We also care
about our students, much as
parents do, while having even less
authority, and suffer similar
rebuffs and reactions.
This year's violence is taking a
new turn. Many younger students
are heavily involved. Instead of
ideology leading to action, we
now observe action leading to
ideology adduced in order to
justify the violence.
Revolutionary Recruitment
Some of the events are
doubtless random. Others are
shrewdly organized as a method
of recruitment into a
revolutionary life-style —a method
which uses the police as
involuntary co-conspirators.
Idealistic students are persuaded
to join in peaceful demonstrations
and wooed in "affinity groups"
that generate a novel sense of
community among homesick
youngsters. They can then
sometimes be maneuvered onto a
scene of violent or illegal action.
It is then easy for an innocent
bystander to be radicalized for life
by the police doing their job in
the only way they know how.
Students pride themselves in being
able to separate the radicals'
laudable major ends from their
unacceptable local means. But
when you happen to have thrown
a rock or burned down a bank in a
moment of passion, your ideology
is likely to change to match the
event: whatever was burned must
have been evil enough to justify
the arson. Let him who has never
deluded himself throw the next
stone.
What do liberals have to offer
to match such fun and
excitement? Not much besides
hard work and much
discouragement, enough to make
anyone "cop out" who is unsure
of his own commitment to social
reform. But our rare and
hard-won successes may still bear
some relationship to the ideals we
started from.
