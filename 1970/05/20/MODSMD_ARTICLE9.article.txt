# Shut It Down?
## A
						'Purified' University 
### Albert Guerard 
The moral revolution, thanks to
Nixon's polarizing rhetoric, now
sees far beyond Cambodia. The
President has said he will not
accept the humiliation of defeat;
the student response is that it will
no longer accept the concept of
Pax Americana.
A whole generation has said,
unmistakably, that it could not
care less about American
preminence and the protection of
economic hegemonies in
backward areas, the old
"freedom" to liberate, develop,
exploit. The energies aroused by
the Cambodian blunder now
aspire to no less than a
reconsideration of the whole
accepted ideology, the entire
American "way of life" of
disposable containers and
calculated obsolescence, of
waspish, conformist morality.
One feels this aroused student
generation, if it remains
serious—if, for instance, it really
throws itself into the fall
elections—is capable of anything,
capable even of grounding those
super-sonic planes.
Smaller, Purer University
In this heady atmosphere it is
only natural to long for a smaller
and purer university, one that is
neither the servant of Pax
American abroad nor the servant
at home of an economy
concerned less with quality than
with growth. There is an
understandable repudiation of the
impulse, so strong in the 1950's
and 1960'5, to identify biggest
with best, and to watch Stanford
overtake the eastern giants.
Since "bigness" clearly involves
many evils, mere smallness—a
visible, drastic reduction of the
university's resources—might seem
at a glance desirable. And in fact
it is entirely realistic to look
ahead to the elimination of all
war-related research and to more
rational, less disruptive policies
for leasing Stanford lands.
Student and faculty thought
should be continuingly directed to
these objectives.
However, Stanford cannot
overnight achieve the purity of
Cabrillo and DeAnza, nor even
that of Amherst and Williams.
There are idealists who believe
they can,by bringing theuniversity
to its knees, effect radical
transformations. They know that
trashing and other acts utterly
unrelated to the serious effort to
influence Washington will alienate
alumni and community support
for the university. Perhaps they
visualize, as a result, a 10 or 20

percent budget cutback that
would get rid of the elements they
like least: a slenderizing that
would purify.
What Goes First?
What they fail to see is that
neither students nor faculty,
neither administrators nor
trustees, could choose what 10 or
20 percent to slough off. Such a
belt-tightening would not mean
the elimination of any professors
or associate professors with
tenure, however feeble their
teaching or disreputable their
research. Nor would it mean the
razing of the Hoover Towr or the
stadium.
Such a cutback could mean
instead the elimination, in many
departments, of nearly all
assistant professors, of all

temporarily funded innovative
programs, and of all programs
now on the drawing boards—the
elimination, in short, of all that
does not involve a legal permanent
commitment: a shrinkage that
would rid the university of what
students care about most.
This is but one reason why the
strike should continue to be by
the university and not against it;
and why the same students who
hope to bring Nixon and Atfnew
to their knees should help the
university to remain standing.
Those now engaged in pursuading
parents and alumni to repudiate
Nixon's policies should
simultaneously urge them to
support the university.
