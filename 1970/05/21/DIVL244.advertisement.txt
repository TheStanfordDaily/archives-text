Today is a red letter day in People's History. This
date in 1871 saw the beginning of "Bloody Week" in
Paris: the end of which saw the crushing of the
Commune. One year ago the police pulled a mass bust
(4S4 arrested) during the People's Park struggle in
Berkeley. All of which leads us to the unfortunate
conclusion that "they dared to struggle and failed to
win. "
If you have tidings of a glorious struggle for local or
regional liberation, call the DAILY news commissar at
x4632. If you wish to denounce enemies of the People,
call the business office at 327-4150.
