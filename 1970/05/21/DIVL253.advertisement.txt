I If, like our little friend up there, political action
is your thing, you'll find public address amplifiers,
microphones, and speakers from Lafayette a
mighty handy thing to have.
And Lafayette's famous walkie-talkies can be
mighty useful in co-ordinating demonstrations.
I Or if it's just relaxin' you're plannin', Lafayette
has a lot to lighten your leisure hours —portable
radios, cassette recorder-players, stereo systems
both portable and for the home.
During this last week or two of school, pay a
visit to Lafayette—see our vacation ideas!
