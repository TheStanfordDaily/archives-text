# Strike: Seven Days In May
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
It was a glorious week. For
seven or eight days, this month,
the world went crazy.
A student strike spread
spontaneously across the nation,
catching President Nixon, Ronald
Reagan, and even the Associated
Press off guard.
In the heat of the madness, the
students were not alone. City
Councils, PTA's, Womens' Clubs
and just plain people all across the
country stood up to the President,
crying "enough is enough".
Then it ended, quietly, cooly,
without the climatic bitterness of
the Chicago convention or the

Commentary

Moratoria. Reading the AP news,
or speaking to a distant friend
brings in dregs of further news.
The University of Cincinatti is
closed, one reads; Northwestern
and Berkeley have been
"reconstituted". Other schools
close as summer arrives; still more
were closed before.
On a hundred campuses,
students are preparing for finals,
elections, or The Revolution. It's
quiet business, business that
doesn't make a wire, or even a
mention in the school paper.The
people who do the shit-work are

like trash collectors at Woodstock
- the real pros.
The steady activity is hard to
grasp, difficult to analyze. There
are just too many people doing
too many things to comprehend it
all.
The madness of a spring week
seems forgotten now. Listening to
the hum of a mimeo machine, it is
hard to believe that only
yesterday students cut off
freeways in Los Angeles in New
York, defied authorities in
California, or braved bayonets in
Kentucky.
It is just a trifle unreal.
Reconstructing that incredible
week helps some; looking back
one understands the rhythm of
the mimeo and the ringing of the
telephone.
Nixon Sparks Strike
One first recalls President
Nixon's Thursday night speech.
After years of a deceptive,
undeclared war, the president
offered a decision - a moment of
truth that opponents of that war
could react to.
Until that night, the spring had
seemed relatively quiet on most
campuses. Stanford had had its
share of action; Berkeley saw
some fighting, and strikes over
local issues had inflamed Ohio
State, Wisconsin, and Boston
College. All eyes were focused on

New Haven, where a rally in
support of the Black Panthers was
slated for Saturday.
History will probably hold that
Richard Nixon managed to
outdraw Bobby Seale.
On a few campuses, strikes
were being planned, or discussed.
When, at 9 p.m. EDT, Richard
Milhous Nixon spoke to the
nation, the strike was on.
Slow Starting
Its beginnings were
inauspicious. Stanford students
struck, more impassioned over
two nights of street fighting than
the President's policy. At Cal,
some demonstrators dutifully
marched through campus
On the East Coast, Ivy League
schools began to close one by one.
By Sunday morning, news of
various strikes and marches had
spread from Philadelphia to
Boston. Editors of seven Ivy
League papers met and issued a
joint editorial calling a national
academic strike.
The editorial spread, as the
Stanford Daily called the Daily
Princetonian, using the Princeton
copy, the Stanford journalists
dictated edit to the Daily
Californian, which got the UCLA
Daily Hruin to accept it as well.
Sunday Organizing
Sunday was the day of

organization. Early that morning,
a strike information center was set
up in Philadelphia; in the
afternoon Brandeis assumed its
role as national information
center. Late that night, students
at Columbia began gathering
information concerning New York
area schools. The Stanford and
Berkeley newspapers shared the
West Coast information duties, as
the grapevine spread coast to
coast.
Monday was the day of greatest
uncertainty. No one, anywhere,
knew how many schools would
strike, how effectively they would
strike, or what the reaction would
be.
The answer wasn't long in
coming. On dozens of campuses,
there were pickets, convocations,
rallies, and walkouts.
In Ohio, there was a burst of
gunfire, and death.
Violent Realities
The Kent State killings
solidified student opinions even
more than Nixon's speech. Death
and injury, violence and peace
became vivid realities. The
cherished role of student neutral
died, alongside the student
spectators.
By Tuesday, the strike itself
was a reality. Students stayed
away from classes at Stanford,

Berkeley, and UCLA; on the East
Coast, schools began to close
officially with special
arrangements for credit and
diplomas.
The decentralized nature of the
strike continued. One Stanford
radical was heard to say, "this is
chaos, not anarchy", and many
echoed his sentiments. The news
of the movement was finally
picked up by the wire services and
the television networks, but the
best picture emerged from
telephone calls and ham radio
messages that connected
campuses.
Reagan Closes Schools
Wednesday was the big day.
That morning, close to a million
students were shut out of classes
as Governor Reagan closed the
California State schools,
recommending that the junior
colleges and private schools close
as well.
It was a beautiful pre-empt, one
that ended violence at UCLA and
prevented violence at Berkeley.
The students followed the letter,
but not the substance of the
Governor's message. Aside from
the commuter campuses, few
students went home to meditate.
Those that did return to their
parents often organized high
school and junior college students.
Weekend Calm
Thursday and Friday were days
of pleasant confusion and hectic
action. A silent vigil at Berkeley
drew 5,000 persons; it then
moved along the Bancroft side of

the campus to become what some
called the world's largest picket
line. The picket line stretched in
illegal splendor from one end of
the main campus to the other, but
the city was calm.
The Berkeley police wore soft
caps and carried flowers next to
their billy clubs. iStriking
criminology students marched to
the police headquarters and asked
the assistant to the chief to join
the strike.
Finally, came Saturday and the
traditional march on Washington.
It was hot and humid, and
somewhat pointless, but 75,000
people turned out anyway. There
was some fine rhetoric, and a little
violence; but it was an
anti-climax. It lacked the
spontaneity, the honest
indignation of the strike week. It
was a gesture to a past of
Moratoria; the strike was a toast
to a future of unified action.
Strike Ends
Then, as quietly as it began, the
strike ended. It was without
fanfare or headlines; students
simply went back to their books
or committees. Rallies became
fewer and farther between,
leafletting became sporadic as
students headed home for the
summer.
Back East, summer has already
arrived; some schools closed
prematurely, while others shut
down on schedule. In California,
the spring season, while not over,
is clearly ending.
One wonders what the summer
will bring.

The answer wasn't long in
coming. On dozens of campuses,
there were pickets, convocations,
rallies, and walkouts.
In Ohio, there was a burst of
gunfire, and death.
Violent Realities
The Kent State killings
solidified student opinions even
more than Nixon's speech. Death
and injury, violence and peace
became vivid realities. The
cherished role of student neutral
died, alongside the student
spectators.
By Tuesday, the strike itself
was a reality. Students stayed
away from classes at Stanford,

Berkeley, and UCLA; on the East
Coast, schools began to close
officially with special
arrangements for credit and
diplomas.
The decentralized nature of the
strike continued. One Stanford
radical was heard to say, "this is
chaos, not anarchy", and many
echoed his sentiments. The news
of the movement was finally
picked up by the wire services and
the television networks, but the
best picture emerged from
telephone calls and ham radio
messages that connected
campuses.
Reagan Closes Schools
Wednesday was the big day.
That morning, close to a million
students were shut out of classes
as Governor Reagan closed the
California State schools,
recommending that the junior
colleges and private schools close
as well.
It was a beautiful pre-empt, one
that ended violence at UCLA and
prevented violence at Berkeley.
The students followed the letter,
but not the substance of the
Governor's message. Aside from
the commuter campuses, few
students went home to meditate.
Those that did return to their
parents often organized high
school and junior college students.
Weekend Calm
Thursday and Friday were days
of pleasant confusion and hectic
action. A silent vigil at Berkeley
drew 5,000 persons; it then
moved along the Bancroft side of

the campus to become what some
called the world's largest picket
line. The picket line stretched in
illegal splendor from one end of
the main campus to the other, but
the city was calm.
The Berkeley police wore soft
caps and carried flowers next to
their billy clubs. iStriking
criminology students marched to
the police headquarters and asked
the assistant to the chief to join
the strike.
Finally, came Saturday and the
traditional march on Washington.
It was hot and humid, and
somewhat pointless, but 75,000
people turned out anyway. There
was some fine rhetoric, and a little
violence; but it was an
anti-climax. It lacked the
spontaneity, the honest
indignation of the strike week. It
was a gesture to a past of
Moratoria; the strike was a toast
to a future of unified action.
Strike Ends
Then, as quietly as it began, the
strike ended. It was without
fanfare or headlines; students
simply went back to their books
or committees. Rallies became
fewer and farther between,
leafletting became sporadic as
students headed home for the
summer.
Back East, summer has already
arrived; some schools closed
prematurely, while others shut
down on schedule. In California,
the spring season, while not over,
is clearly ending.
One wonders what the summer
will bring.
It was a glorious week. For
seven or eight days, this month,
the world went crazy.
A student strike spread
spontaneously across the nation,
catching President Nixon, Ronald
Reagan, and even the Associated
Press off guard.
In the heat of the madness, the
students were not alone. City
Councils, PTA's, Womens' Clubs
and just plain people all across the
country stood up to the President,
crying "enough is enough".
Then it ended, quietly, cooly,
without the climatic bitterness of
the Chicago convention or the

Commentary

Moratoria. Reading the AP news,
or speaking to a distant friend
brings in dregs of further news.
The University of Cincinatti is
closed, one reads; Northwestern
and Berkeley have been
"reconstituted". Other schools
close as summer arrives; still more
were closed before.
On a hundred campuses,
students are preparing for finals,
elections, or The Revolution. It's
quiet business, business that
doesn't make a wire, or even a
mention in the school paper.The
people who do the shit-work are

like trash collectors at Woodstock
- the real pros.
The steady activity is hard to
grasp, difficult to analyze. There
are just too many people doing
too many things to comprehend it
all.
The madness of a spring week
seems forgotten now. Listening to
the hum of a mimeo machine, it is
hard to believe that only
yesterday students cut off
freeways in Los Angeles in New
York, defied authorities in
California, or braved bayonets in
Kentucky.
It is just a trifle unreal.
Reconstructing that incredible
week helps some; looking back
one understands the rhythm of
the mimeo and the ringing of the
telephone.
Nixon Sparks Strike
One first recalls President
Nixon's Thursday night speech.
After years of a deceptive,
undeclared war, the president
offered a decision - a moment of
truth that opponents of that war
could react to.
Until that night, the spring had
seemed relatively quiet on most
campuses. Stanford had had its
share of action; Berkeley saw
some fighting, and strikes over
local issues had inflamed Ohio
State, Wisconsin, and Boston
College. All eyes were focused on

New Haven, where a rally in
support of the Black Panthers was
slated for Saturday.
History will probably hold that
Richard Nixon managed to
outdraw Bobby Seale.
On a few campuses, strikes
were being planned, or discussed.
When, at 9 p.m. EDT, Richard
Milhous Nixon spoke to the
nation, the strike was on.
Slow Starting
Its beginnings were
inauspicious. Stanford students
struck, more impassioned over
two nights of street fighting than
the President's policy. At Cal,
some demonstrators dutifully
marched through campus
On the East Coast, Ivy League
schools began to close one by one.
By Sunday morning, news of
various strikes and marches had
spread from Philadelphia to
Boston. Editors of seven Ivy
League papers met and issued a
joint editorial calling a national
academic strike.
The editorial spread, as the
Stanford Daily called the Daily
Princetonian, using the Princeton
copy, the Stanford journalists
dictated edit to the Daily
Californian, which got the UCLA
Daily Hruin to accept it as well.
Sunday Organizing
Sunday was the day of

organization. Early that morning,
a strike information center was set
up in Philadelphia; in the
afternoon Brandeis assumed its
role as national information
center. Late that night, students
at Columbia began gathering
information concerning New York
area schools. The Stanford and
Berkeley newspapers shared the
West Coast information duties, as
the grapevine spread coast to
coast.
Monday was the day of greatest
uncertainty. No one, anywhere,
knew how many schools would
strike, how effectively they would
strike, or what the reaction would
be.
The answer wasn't long in
coming. On dozens of campuses,
there were pickets, convocations,
rallies, and walkouts.

and Berkeley have been
"reconstituted". Other schools
close as summer arrives; still more
were closed before.
On a hundred campuses,
students are preparing for finals,
elections, or The Revolution. It's
quiet business, business that
doesn't make a wire, or even a
mention in the school paper.The
people who do the shit-work are

like trash collectors at Woodstock
- the real pros.
The steady activity is hard to
grasp, difficult to analyze. There
are just too many people doing
too many things to comprehend it
all.
The madness of a spring week
seems forgotten now. Listening to
the hum of a mimeo machine, it is
hard to believe that only
yesterday students cut off
freeways in Los Angeles in New
York, defied authorities in
California, or braved bayonets in
Kentucky.
It is just a trifle unreal.
Reconstructing that incredible
week helps some; looking back
one understands the rhythm of
the mimeo and the ringing of the
telephone.
Nixon Sparks Strike
One first recalls President
Nixon's Thursday night speech.
After years of a deceptive,
undeclared war, the president
offered a decision - a moment of
truth that opponents of that war
could react to.
Until that night, the spring had
seemed relatively quiet on most
campuses. Stanford had had its
share of action; Berkeley saw
some fighting, and strikes over
local issues had inflamed Ohio
State, Wisconsin, and Boston
College. All eyes were focused on

New Haven, where a rally in
support of the Black Panthers was
slated for Saturday.
History will probably hold that
Richard Nixon managed to
outdraw Bobby Seale.
On a few campuses, strikes
were being planned, or discussed.
When, at 9 p.m. EDT, Richard
Milhous Nixon spoke to the
nation, the strike was on.
Slow Starting
Its beginnings were
inauspicious. Stanford students
struck, more impassioned over
two nights of street fighting than
the President's policy. At Cal,
some demonstrators dutifully
marched through campus
On the East Coast, Ivy League
schools began to close one by one.
By Sunday morning, news of
various strikes and marches had
spread from Philadelphia to
Boston. Editors of seven Ivy
League papers met and issued a
joint editorial calling a national
academic strike.
The editorial spread, as the
Stanford Daily called the Daily
Princetonian, using the Princeton
copy, the Stanford journalists
dictated edit to the Daily
Californian, which got the UCLA
Daily Hruin to accept it as well.
Sunday Organizing
Sunday was the day of

organization. Early that morning,
a strike information center was set
up in Philadelphia; in the
afternoon Brandeis assumed its
role as national information
center. Late that night, students
at Columbia began gathering
information concerning New York
area schools. The Stanford and
Berkeley newspapers shared the
West Coast information duties, as
the grapevine spread coast to
coast.
Monday was the day of greatest
uncertainty. No one, anywhere,
knew how many schools would
strike, how effectively they would
strike, or what the reaction would
be.
The answer wasn't long in
coming. On dozens of campuses,
there were pickets, convocations,
rallies, and walkouts.
In Ohio, there was a burst of
gunfire, and death.
Violent Realities
The Kent State killings
solidified student opinions even
more than Nixon's speech. Death
and injury, violence and peace
became vivid realities. The
cherished role of student neutral
died, alongside the student
spectators.
By Tuesday, the strike itself
was a reality. Students stayed
away from classes at Stanford,

Berkeley, and UCLA; on the East
Coast, schools began to close
officially with special
arrangements for credit and
diplomas.
The decentralized nature of the
strike continued. One Stanford
radical was heard to say, "this is
chaos, not anarchy", and many
echoed his sentiments. The news
of the movement was finally
picked up by the wire services and
the television networks, but the
best picture emerged from
telephone calls and ham radio
messages that connected
campuses.
Reagan Closes Schools
Wednesday was the big day.
That morning, close to a million
students were shut out of classes
as Governor Reagan closed the
California State schools,
recommending that the junior
colleges and private schools close
as well.
It was a beautiful pre-empt, one
that ended violence at UCLA and
prevented violence at Berkeley.
The students followed the letter,
but not the substance of the
Governor's message. Aside from
the commuter campuses, few
students went home to meditate.
Those that did return to their
parents often organized high
school and junior college students.
Weekend Calm
Thursday and Friday were days
of pleasant confusion and hectic
action. A silent vigil at Berkeley
drew 5,000 persons; it then
moved along the Bancroft side of

the campus to become what some
called the world's largest picket
line. The picket line stretched in
illegal splendor from one end of
the main campus to the other, but
the city was calm.
The Berkeley police wore soft
caps and carried flowers next to
their billy clubs. iStriking
criminology students marched to
the police headquarters and asked
the assistant to the chief to join
the strike.
Finally, came Saturday and the
traditional march on Washington.
It was hot and humid, and
somewhat pointless, but 75,000
people turned out anyway. There
was some fine rhetoric, and a little
violence; but it was an
anti-climax. It lacked the
spontaneity, the honest
indignation of the strike week. It
was a gesture to a past of
Moratoria; the strike was a toast
to a future of unified action.
Strike Ends
Then, as quietly as it began, the
strike ended. It was without
fanfare or headlines; students
simply went back to their books
or committees. Rallies became
fewer and farther between,
leafletting became sporadic as
students headed home for the
summer.
Back East, summer has already
arrived; some schools closed
prematurely, while others shut
down on schedule. In California,
the spring season, while not over,
is clearly ending.
One wonders what the summer
will bring.
It was a glorious week. For
seven or eight days, this month,
the world went crazy.
A student strike spread
spontaneously across the nation,
catching President Nixon, Ronald
Reagan, and even the Associated
Press off guard.
In the heat of the madness, the
students were not alone. City
Councils, PTA's, Womens' Clubs
and just plain people all across the
country stood up to the President,
crying "enough is enough".
Then it ended, quietly, cooly,
without the climatic bitterness of
the Chicago convention or the

Commentary

Moratoria. Reading the AP news,
or speaking to a distant friend
brings in dregs of further news.
