# But Can It Read?
## Silent Majority Speaks 
### Jesse Cedarbaum 
Ever wonder what the Silent Majority's been up
to lately? If you have, reading yesterday's
Chronicle was quite an interesting experience. If
you don't believe me, read on and see for yourself
just what Nixon and his Silent Majority had to say.
For instance, it was reported that over half the
adult population of the United States is too
illiterate to master "such day-to-day reading
matter as . . . newspapers and job applications," a
task which the survey says requires at least a 10th
grade education.
Another article on the same page noted that a
survey of white-collar workers in downtown San
Francisco showed 71 percent of them to be against
Nixon's policies. Small wonder that Nixon calls us,
those privileged few who have progressed beyond
the 10th grade, "bums."
The same article stated that the government's
criterion for determining whether or not a person
is "functionally illiterate" is the completion of
fourth grade. Looking inside the Chron, we find
that a fourth-grade girl who wrote to the President
urging him to do something about pollution
received the following reply from an official of the
Departme it of Healt'i, Education, and Welfare:
Let It Be
"Pay attention to your own learning activities,
and let the President take care of decisions on
national and nternational aiTjirs ... He is

equipped to do this. Good luck in your studies."
I guess we should pay attention to our learning
activities: no one in the government is. Yesterday
Nixon held his first Cabinet meeting since April
13. The issue of what has been happening on the
nation's college campuses was conspicuously
absent from the formal agenda.
Pigs Banned
Then again, maybe someone is listening to us. In
the city of Buffalo, New York, the city council
passed an ordinance Monday prohibiting the
printing or uttering of the word PIG when directed
at any government official, policeman, or school
administrator. Those of us who are literate enough
will undoubtedly caome up with a worthy
synonym.
But let us not forget that other renowned
spokesman of Truth and Justice, Spiro T. Yes, that
great glib larynx of the 端biquitous Silent Majority
lashed out once again, this time with a racket
whose reverberations have not yet died out. While
playing doubles tennis, the junior executive
reached out and adeptly clubbed his partner over
the head. His victim? The director of the Peace
Corps, Joseph Blatchford.
God help us, for he knows not what he does.
Amen.

passed an ordinance Monday prohibiting the
printing or uttering of the word PIG when directed
at any government official, policeman, or school
administrator. Those of us who are literate enough
will undoubtedly caome up with a worthy
synonym.
But let us not forget that other renowned
spokesman of Truth and Justice, Spiro T. Yes, that
great glib larynx of the 端biquitous Silent Majority
lashed out once again, this time with a racket
whose reverberations have not yet died out. While
playing doubles tennis, the junior executive
reached out and adeptly clubbed his partner over
the head. His victim? The director of the Peace
Corps, Joseph Blatchford.
God help us, for he knows not what he does.
Amen.
