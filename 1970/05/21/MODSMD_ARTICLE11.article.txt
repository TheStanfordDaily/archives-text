ROTC Poll Criticism
Editor, THE DAILY:
The President's Advisory
Committee on ROTC Affairs has
mailed out ballots for the
purpose, they say, of once more
trying to determine community
feeling on this issue. The results of
this poll, however, will not be an
accurate reflection of community
opinion. It is a well-known fact
that the phrasing of a question
influences the percentage
responses.
On the question of the future
status of ROTC, only one
option—that of ROTC's
elimination from campus —is
accompanied by an argument
against its adoption. This
argument is presented as the
major part of the "description " of
the option. Moreover, no positive
argument is presented in favor of
the option.
I urge everyone to express
themselves on the poll, however I
fear that the biased presentation
of the various options will
needlessly detract from its
representivity and from its
credibility.

Random Thoughts
Editor, THE DAILY:
Some random thoughts from
recent weeks:
1) Has anyone noticed that
many of the "Grass Roots"
leaders who were so piously
deploring the desecration of the
environment a few months ago are
exactly the same people who
urged mobs to "trash" windows
and burn buildings. What does
that tell you about their sincerity
and motivations? to oppose
ROTC?
2) Stanford students were
delighted that they were given a
choice between violent and
non-violent ways to oppose the
Cambodian venture, completely
overlooking the fact in the middle
of the stampeding that there was a
third choice—to be neutral or to
support government policy. Who
is speaking for the silent majority
on the campus? How can it be
that so many intelligent,
perceptive students were panicked
into action by fad and by mob

psychology to oppose an action
before any of the true facts about
it were established? Those on the
left are adroit manipulators, and
you in the center are ready
followers.
3) Tell a radical that the law
exists to protect his rights as well
as those of everyone within the
system, and he'll laugh in your
face. But a case in point is the
episode at Pace College in New
York, where construction workers
beat up demonstrating college
students. The students who were
only recently shouting "pigs off
campus" suddenly were looking
for police protection from
another self-righteous group.
Moral of the story : if you feel free
to infringe upon the rights of
others, don't expect any help
when others infringe on yours.
4) "Revolution" is a heady
game among students these
days—and a very dangerous one.
Those who are playing it should
be aware of two things: if they
fail, they will be crushed by
repression from the right; if they
succeed, they will be among the
first to go up against the wall. Hie
hard-core insurgents have little use
for intelligent, idealistic,
questioning young people, for
they represent the greatest threat
of all to them. So they will be
liquidated. If you don't believe it,
take the time to talk to some
refugees from Europe or Cuba. If

you are really intellectually
honest, invite someone from the
Hoover Institution to your dorm
for dinner to talk it over. You'll
find that there is a lot more to
revolution than campus agitators
and the "Pacific Research Center"
have been telling you.

Daily Ignores Culture
Editor, THE DAILY:
On Saturday, May 16, a concert
was given in Dinkelspiel Aud. by
twelve music students. It was an
excellent performance of
professional calibre artists. Yet
only 10 people came to hear this
free entertainment in a hall which
seats about 500.
Why?
The Stanford Daily has an
explicit policy of a) ignoring all
events sponsored by the Music
Department, and b) refusing to
report on any musical activity
other than that of "popular," e.g.
rock variety. Hence, the above
mentioned concert failed to get
one dram of publicity from the
Daily. It is truly a sorry state
when the only effective campus
publication, apparently by
editorial decision, declines to
report news of selected campus
activities—it is the mark of
anti-i nt e 11 ectual ism and
intolerance.
But this attitude seems merely

YESTERDAY
Back in ages ni dioval
And in ancient times in dell:
The kings and princes ruled the roost
And the lowly peasants as well!
The church allied with royalty
And kept the lid tight high
On hoi polloi who labored loyally
Eor Heaven's reward bye and bye!
Wise men were allied to royal court
And monasteries were scribes' own sport
As the mind intellectual was ineffectual
As the masses were the asses abort!
TODAY
Now tliis is all changed in academe:
Professors bask in scientific esteem,
As power elite they look for a fight
With the demons of pollution who scream!
And thus we have a tug of war
Between forces of good and evil lore:
Academic elite versus power elite
For prestige and glory galore!

to reflect the mood of much of
this campus. Too many students
are afraid to expose their plastic
minds to anything original, and
consequently don't give a damn
about real music. The Stanford
Symphony is performing this
Sunday —I wonder if the hall will
be filled, and how much of the
audience will consist of students.

My Dear Mr. Weslbrook:
Your letter {printed above) is
so full of inaccuracies,
inconsistencies, and paranoid
outbursts that I hardly know
where to begin in answering it.
May I simply take your
statements in order and calmly
explain our position.
I. The Daily has no explicit

policy—no policy concerning
music at all. We lake things as
they come -perhaps a bit too
loosely, but certainly without
premeditation. If you read the
paper as faithfully as you must,
you might have taken note of the
"Sym a I he tic V ib rations"
column, appearing on an average
once weekly, discussing the
classical music performed by both
the San Francisco and the
Oak land Sy mphon ies.
2. The Daily has reported a
number of Music Department
activities, including the A LEA II
series, the operatic "Dialogue of
the Carmelites," and numerous
notices of concerts and recitals.
3. I resent the implication that
the Daily is intolerant and
anti intellectual. I am certain that
I will never convince you (hat we

do care and think and feel, but at
last accounting, we were human
and I assume we remain so.
If students fail to attend a
concert, it can hardly be the fault
of the paper. We have been
blamed for poor attendance at
classes, high at tendance at street
fighting, and weak commitment at
crises. If, despite a notice in
"Campus Roundup, " or a poster,
or even a blurb in a paper that
most despise, students refuse to
attend —blame them. Or better
yet, forget the whole thing.
