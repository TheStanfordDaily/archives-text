# Community Conversation
## Open Campus Shatters Myths 
### Agit-Prop Committee 
La&t Sunday, Mary Hanson,
Mike Lindeman, and others led
"open campus" discussion groups
that included Birchers and
pro-Nixon visitors. Some of these
groups did not break up for four
or five hours. The following three
incidents serve to illustrate the
dynamics of what went on last
weekend.
At the open microphone after
several speakers had expressed
varying degrees of anti-war
sentiment, a lady demanded "the
right" to express "the other side."
Apparently, she assumed we were
trying to prevent or discourage
such expression, because she
seemed a little surprised when we
welcomed her remarks. She spoke
in a tremendously defensive way,
offering little more than her belief
in her right to express her
opinion.
Speakers following her, and
others who joined her in private
conversation, managed to break
down her defensiveness very
effectively by inviting her to
expand on the actual content of
her opinion. She discovered that

the hostility she expected simply
did not exist, and some time later
she again went to the microphone
to say in more concrete form that
on many issues she sided with the
students. Some of her
defensiveness still remained—she
backed Nixon and knew that most
of those around her didn't—but
we had at least convinced her that
she could talk to us without being
put down.
In another incident, two elderly
men wearing Veterans of Foreign
Wars caps joined a group of
students for a short time on
Agitators' Grass (in White Plaza).
The veterans said that most of
their fellow chapter members had
been unwilling to come because of
reputed student hostility. After
only fifteen minutes of discussion,
the two men said they were
pleased with our willingness to
talk and listen rationally and
honestly. They promised when
they left to come back this
weekend with as many of their
friends as they com Id talk to this
week.
Birch Discussion
As a final example, a discussion
between two John Birch Society
members (husband and wife) and
a large group of other people
(including students and
community visitors) ran for over
three hours on Agitators' Grass.
The most encouraging sign here
was that after a while our visitors
began to dominate both sides of
the discussion. In this case, the
students had acted as a catalyst,
generating dialogue between
community people of varying
persuasions, many of whom had
never attempted such an exchange
before.
After it was all over, one radical
remarked in a straightforward way
that you really had to love your
fellow Americans to be able have
the kind of recognizable
commitment that people respond
to in a human way, which brought
to mind former SDS president
Carl Oglesby's warning to the
contemporary American Left:
"You can't make a revolution if
you hate America."
It is clear that no Birchers
joined the New Left last Sunday.
So, then what was accomplished
and what attracted radical and
moderate students to participate.
Moderate Dialogue
Moderates who oppose the war
but support the existing political
institutions believe that the way
to change policies is to apply
public pressure on the national
administration. Moderate students
hope that the dialogue and
accompanying attitude changes

will spread to 200 college
campuses across the country,
which are at present all faced with
the same problem of extending
the strike-boycott outside the
universitv. The hoped-for result
would be the fastest shift in
public opinion this country has
ever experience.
If you are a moderate who
wants to stop the war, but you
don't see the necessity for
overturning the system, you must
believe that you can talk others
into changing their positions and
thereby, eventually, alter the
situation without violence.
Anyone who holds this position
and who doesn't believe in the
efficacy of rational dialogue (even
with Nixon's advisors), is caught
in a hopeless contradiction.
If you are a left radical, an
open campus is an example of a
classical radical endeavor.
Regardless of which radical
position you take, you must
recognize that the ruling class uses
words and other symbols to
"legitimize" its authority and dull
dissent. Only a rigorous analysis
of our present situation can bind
together pieces of information
presented in the controlled press
as isolated and unique events:
inflation, unemployment,
Cambodia, the repression of the
Panthers, the Greek regime, etc.,
etc. Only such analysis can win
acceptance for a radical critique
of the United States by clearly
demonstrating that these disparate
facts are best understood as part
and parcel of a strategy of
imperialism abroad and repression
at home.
Jesse Lemisch, the radical
historian of the working class in
the American Revolution, argues
that radical history is simply the
rigorous presentation of the facts
in an understandable cause and
effect pattern. The open campus
affords serious radicals the
opportunity to confront ruling
class myths with actual facts.
Subjective Conditions
Marx's greatest achievement
was in pointing out that things are
not as they seem. The open
campus provides you with an
audience for the "18th Brumaire
of Richard Nixon" and the
opportunity to prove that the
objective conditions of our time
require radical understanding and
radical opposition.
Radicals are getting ripped off
one by one now. Do radicals at
Stanford really know how to
protect themselves? A mass
movement is the only protection
and the only real threat. In May
1968 in France, the General

Strike followed immediately after
revolutionary students made
contact with wildcat strikers.
Don't stop doing anything
useful you are doing, but try to
spend a little time on campus
buttonholing visitors and rapping
with them. A mass movement can
be built; a revolution can be
made.
Everybody should wear a
purple armband next weekend to
signify to our visitors that we are
willing to talk with them.
Let's develop a radicalizing
experience embracing America
1970, from Veterans of Foreign
Wars (who are beginning to doubt
the catch phrases of militarism) to
orthodox Marxist-Leninists.
