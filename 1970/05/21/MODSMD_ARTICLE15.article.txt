# Students' Role
## Help The Teamsters 
### Lenny Siegel 
Few of us |students] on the Stanford campus come from
working-class families. Fewer expect to spend most of our lives driving
trucks. It is difficult, therefore, for us to see the connections between
our movement against the War and the "wildcat" strikes of California
teamsters. If we examine the question carefully, however, the
relationship is clear. Cooperation with Teamsters and other
progressive elements of the American workforce is key to bringing the
Southeast Asian War to an end.
Teamster demands for higher wages mid better working conditions
do not seem, at first, to have a strong relationship to the War. But
war-induced inflation is not just an academic problem. For
wage-earners it is a harsh economic fact. High taxes are also a result of
the war, and are cutting deeply into paychecks. Teamsters do not have
the luxury of refusing to pay war taxes—wage-earner's taxes are
withheld with every paycheck. And finally, working-class kids do not
have the money or legal aid which would allow them to resist the
draft without facing long imprisonment.
Working youth have never, on the whole, had the benefits of
student deferments. Not all Teamsters make these connections, but as
the war continues, more are willing to listen to what students and
radical teamsters have to say. A lot of teamsters could teach us a thing
or two about the War, too.
There is a more general connection between the student movement
and the Teamsters' strike. For many years we have decried Our
"disenfranchisement." In government, the military, and our schools
we have very little say over our lives. The teamsters face the same
problem. Not only do they have little say over their conditions of
employment or life in their communities, but their union no longer
represents them. A continuing teamster "wildcat" movement could
signal a change in the top-down nature of the American labor
movement.
Perhaps the most graphic demonstration of the similar situations of
teamsters and students is the repression which teamsters and students
share. The National Guardsmen that murdered the Kent State
students had spent the previous few days fighting the Ohio teamsters.
Local teamsters arc forced to deal with injunctions, two-faced liberals
like Alioto, and the continuing threat of arrest if they "get out of
line." Any group which threatens the power of the government and
the people who run it are met with whatever force is necessary to
eliminate the threat.
Finally, we should be honest about our long-range goals. Any
revolutionary social change will require the support of the masses of
Americans who need that change. Not only do we need working-cla j
support to end the war. We need popular support and understanding
of revolutionary social change if our movement is to be successful in
transforming Amerika.
You don't have to be a revolutionary to understand the significance
of the connection between the labor movement and the anti-war
movement—but you have to be a revolutionary.
