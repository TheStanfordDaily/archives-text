# SWOPSI: Can Innovation Survive
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Many proposals for reform and
innovation grew out of last year's
unrest at Stanford. One of the few
programs that survived the
summer and withstood the
pressures of a full academic year
was the Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI).
In this, its first year, SWOPSI
has offered 48 different
action-oriented courses on a wide
range of social, political, and
environmental issues. More than
100 faculty and graduate student
workshop leaders and 750
students here participated in the
program.
Courses have dealt with such
urgent problems as air pollution,
radiation, disarmament, housing,
health care computers and
privacy, and logging policy. Many
SWOPSI groups have formulated
their research into reports,
movies, articles, and lectures.
Some have testified before
legislative and administrative
committees. Others have
concentrated their efforts on
community action.

Despites its enthusiastic
acceptance by the Stanford
community, the future of the
SWOPSI program is uncertain.
But, encouraged by its success this
year, and its potential for growth,
the SWOPSI organizers-Joyce
Kobayashi, Bob Jaffe, Joel
Primack, and Susie Block -are
determined to see that the
program does not disappear into
the morass of short-lived and
quickly forgotten educational
innovations.
Resurgent Interest
They are hoping, that with the
resurgent interest in community
action and problem-oriented
courses, students and faculty
members will consider developing
their programs through SWOPSI.
SWOPSI is uniquely fitted for this
emerging kind of action-educat
ion.
For one, it serves as a kind of
clearing house, capable of bringing
together people with similar ideas
for workshops and finding faculty
sponsors for the courses. Equally
important, SWOPSI can arrange
for academic credit, supply funds
to support research projects and

community action, and establish
communication with people
working on similar projects.
Already, new courses for next
year are being arranged. Graduate
students or faculty members with
ideas for workshops are being
urged to contact the SWOPSI
leaders this quarter.
Political Action
Many of the present political
action workshops that have grown
out of the strike can be developed
into SWOPSI workshops. This
quarter's Union Organizing
workshop, for example, is
working to organize the national
strike. Workshops for next fall
might deal with such subjects as
Defense Department research on
campus, political polling and
canvassing, and the influence of
ad agencies on campaigns.
A major concern of the
SWOPSI organizers is what form
the program will take in the
future. They see the best hope for
a lasting SWOPSI program in
eventually establishing an
Institute for the Study of Political
and Social Issues. Such an
Institute would have the privilege
of offering courses for credit, as
does a Department, but it would
have no faculty.
Its staff would consist of
several long-term teaching and
research fellows and professors; a
number of visiting professors and
qualified people in government,
business, and science; and those
faculty members and graduate
students leading SWOPSI courses.
The proposed Institute would
run the SWOPSI program through
a Faculty-Student Council, and
would offer other small seminars
and survey courses.
Intriguing Idea
The Institute strikes many as an
intriguing idea, but it lays, for
now, somewhere in the future. In
its departure from the traditional,
department-dominated academic
structure, it is sure to meet with
opposition.
For the coming academic year,
the leaders are hoping to associate
SWOPSI with the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and
Education, and insure funding for
it from the Innovation Fund
administered by the University
Fellows.
The Policy Board of the Center
would choose a Director for the
SWOPSI program, and could
possibly replace the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies as the
body granting credit to SWOPSI

courses. The Policy Board would
also be empowered to determine
the future development of the
program.
All other aspects of the
program would be administered
by the Director and his staff. At
present, SWOPSI leaders are still
looking for someone to assume
the half-time job, which carries
with it a salary of $3700. The
Director's duties-organizing and
submitting the courses, supplying
funds to groups, publishing the
SWOPSI catalog and overseeing
the publication and dissemination
of workshop findings -will require
that he have a full time secretary.
The main challenge for the
immediate future is finding people
who are willing to commit
themselves to being a part of
SWOPSI, as a teacher, sponsor,
administrator, or in whatever
capacity they might wish.

Graduate students and faculty
members are needed to lead next
fall's workshops.
Leading a workshop requires a
commitment not only to teach
basic knowledge of a problem.
If the SWOPSI program is to
continue it will also need a
number of dedicated students
who are willing to take on the
task of helping to organize
individual courses, and assist the
Director in the overall
administration of the program.
Students interested in helping to
organize next year's program are
urged to attend the general
meeting that will be held next
week.
The future of the program will
likely depend on the number of
students and faculty members
willing to be a part of SWOPSI,
and the level of commitment they
choose for themselves.

administrator, or in whatever
capacity they might wish.

Graduate students and faculty
members are needed to lead next
fall's workshops.
Leading a workshop requires a
commitment not only to teach
basic knowledge of a problem.
If the SWOPSI program is to
continue it will also need a
number of dedicated students
who are willing to take on the
task of helping to organize
individual courses, and assist the
Director in the overall
administration of the program.
Students interested in helping to
organize next year's program are
urged to attend the general
meeting that will be held next
week.
The future of the program will
likely depend on the number of
students and faculty members
willing to be a part of SWOPSI,
and the level of commitment they
choose for themselves.
Many proposals for reform and
innovation grew out of last year's
unrest at Stanford. One of the few
programs that survived the
summer and withstood the
pressures of a full academic year
was the Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI).
In this, its first year, SWOPSI
has offered 48 different
action-oriented courses on a wide
range of social, political, and
environmental issues. More than
100 faculty and graduate student
workshop leaders and 750
students here participated in the
program.
Courses have dealt with such
urgent problems as air pollution,
radiation, disarmament, housing,
health care computers and
privacy, and logging policy. Many
SWOPSI groups have formulated
their research into reports,
movies, articles, and lectures.
Some have testified before
legislative and administrative
committees. Others have
concentrated their efforts on
community action.

Despites its enthusiastic
acceptance by the Stanford
community, the future of the
SWOPSI program is uncertain.
But, encouraged by its success this
year, and its potential for growth,
the SWOPSI organizers-Joyce
Kobayashi, Bob Jaffe, Joel
Primack, and Susie Block -are
determined to see that the
program does not disappear into
the morass of short-lived and
quickly forgotten educational
innovations.
Resurgent Interest
They are hoping, that with the
resurgent interest in community
action and problem-oriented
courses, students and faculty
members will consider developing
their programs through SWOPSI.
SWOPSI is uniquely fitted for this
emerging kind of action-educat
ion.
For one, it serves as a kind of
clearing house, capable of bringing
together people with similar ideas
for workshops and finding faculty
sponsors for the courses. Equally
important, SWOPSI can arrange
for academic credit, supply funds
to support research projects and

community action, and establish
communication with people
working on similar projects.
Already, new courses for next
year are being arranged. Graduate
students or faculty members with
ideas for workshops are being
urged to contact the SWOPSI
leaders this quarter.
Political Action
Many of the present political
action workshops that have grown
out of the strike can be developed
into SWOPSI workshops. This
quarter's Union Organizing
workshop, for example, is
working to organize the national
strike. Workshops for next fall
might deal with such subjects as
Defense Department research on
campus, political polling and
canvassing, and the influence of
ad agencies on campaigns.
A major concern of the
SWOPSI organizers is what form
the program will take in the
future. They see the best hope for
a lasting SWOPSI program in
eventually establishing an
Institute for the Study of Political
and Social Issues. Such an
Institute would have the privilege
of offering courses for credit, as
does a Department, but it would
have no faculty.
Its staff would consist of
several long-term teaching and
research fellows and professors; a
number of visiting professors and
qualified people in government,
business, and science; and those
faculty members and graduate
students leading SWOPSI courses.
The proposed Institute would
run the SWOPSI program through
a Faculty-Student Council, and
would offer other small seminars
and survey courses.
Intriguing Idea
The Institute strikes many as an
intriguing idea, but it lays, for
now, somewhere in the future. In
its departure from the traditional,
department-dominated academic
structure, it is sure to meet with
opposition.
For the coming academic year,
the leaders are hoping to associate
SWOPSI with the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and
Education, and insure funding for
it from the Innovation Fund
administered by the University
Fellows.
The Policy Board of the Center
would choose a Director for the
SWOPSI program, and could
possibly replace the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies as the
body granting credit to SWOPSI

courses. The Policy Board would
also be empowered to determine
the future development of the
program.
All other aspects of the
program would be administered
by the Director and his staff. At
present, SWOPSI leaders are still
looking for someone to assume
the half-time job, which carries
with it a salary of $3700. The
Director's duties-organizing and
submitting the courses, supplying
funds to groups, publishing the
SWOPSI catalog and overseeing
the publication and dissemination
of workshop findings -will require
that he have a full time secretary.
The main challenge for the
immediate future is finding people
who are willing to commit
themselves to being a part of
SWOPSI, as a teacher, sponsor,
administrator, or in whatever
capacity they might wish.

on Undergraduate Studies as the
body granting credit to SWOPSI

courses. The Policy Board would
also be empowered to determine
the future development of the
program.
All other aspects of the
program would be administered
by the Director and his staff. At
present, SWOPSI leaders are still
looking for someone to assume
the half-time job, which carries
with it a salary of $3700. The
Director's duties-organizing and
submitting the courses, supplying
funds to groups, publishing the
SWOPSI catalog and overseeing
the publication and dissemination
of workshop findings -will require
that he have a full time secretary.
The main challenge for the
immediate future is finding people
who are willing to commit
themselves to being a part of
SWOPSI, as a teacher, sponsor,
administrator, or in whatever
capacity they might wish.

Graduate students and faculty
members are needed to lead next
fall's workshops.
Leading a workshop requires a
commitment not only to teach
basic knowledge of a problem.
If the SWOPSI program is to
continue it will also need a
number of dedicated students
who are willing to take on the
task of helping to organize
individual courses, and assist the
Director in the overall
administration of the program.
Students interested in helping to
organize next year's program are
urged to attend the general
meeting that will be held next
week.
The future of the program will
likely depend on the number of
students and faculty members
willing to be a part of SWOPSI,
and the level of commitment they
choose for themselves.
Many proposals for reform and
innovation grew out of last year's
unrest at Stanford. One of the few
programs that survived the
summer and withstood the
pressures of a full academic year
was the Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI).
In this, its first year, SWOPSI
has offered 48 different
action-oriented courses on a wide
range of social, political, and
environmental issues. More than
100 faculty and graduate student
workshop leaders and 750
students here participated in the
program.
Courses have dealt with such
urgent problems as air pollution,
radiation, disarmament, housing,
health care computers and
privacy, and logging policy. Many
SWOPSI groups have formulated
their research into reports,
movies, articles, and lectures.
Some have testified before
legislative and administrative
committees. Others have
concentrated their efforts on
community action.

Despites its enthusiastic
acceptance by the Stanford
community, the future of the
SWOPSI program is uncertain.
But, encouraged by its success this
year, and its potential for growth,
the SWOPSI organizers-Joyce
Kobayashi, Bob Jaffe, Joel
Primack, and Susie Block -are
determined to see that the
program does not disappear into
the morass of short-lived and
quickly forgotten educational
innovations.
Resurgent Interest
They are hoping, that with the
resurgent interest in community
action and problem-oriented
courses, students and faculty
members will consider developing
their programs through SWOPSI.
SWOPSI is uniquely fitted for this
emerging kind of action-educat
ion.
For one, it serves as a kind of
clearing house, capable of bringing
together people with similar ideas
for workshops and finding faculty
sponsors for the courses. Equally
important, SWOPSI can arrange
for academic credit, supply funds
to support research projects and

community action, and establish
communication with people
working on similar projects.
Already, new courses for next
year are being arranged. Graduate
students or faculty members with
ideas for workshops are being
urged to contact the SWOPSI
leaders this quarter.
Political Action
Many of the present political
action workshops that have grown
out of the strike can be developed
into SWOPSI workshops. This
quarter's Union Organizing
workshop, for example, is
working to organize the national
strike. Workshops for next fall
might deal with such subjects as
Defense Department research on
campus, political polling and
canvassing, and the influence of
ad agencies on campaigns.
A major concern of the
SWOPSI organizers is what form
the program will take in the
future. They see the best hope for
a lasting SWOPSI program in
eventually establishing an
Institute for the Study of Political
and Social Issues. Such an
Institute would have the privilege
of offering courses for credit, as
does a Department, but it would
have no faculty.
Its staff would consist of
several long-term teaching and
research fellows and professors; a
number of visiting professors and
qualified people in government,
business, and science; and those
faculty members and graduate
students leading SWOPSI courses.
The proposed Institute would
run the SWOPSI program through
a Faculty-Student Council, and
would offer other small seminars
and survey courses.
Intriguing Idea
The Institute strikes many as an
intriguing idea, but it lays, for
now, somewhere in the future. In
its departure from the traditional,
department-dominated academic
structure, it is sure to meet with
opposition.
For the coming academic year,
the leaders are hoping to associate
SWOPSI with the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and
Education, and insure funding for
it from the Innovation Fund
administered by the University
Fellows.
The Policy Board of the Center
would choose a Director for the
SWOPSI program, and could
possibly replace the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies as the
body granting credit to SWOPSI

courses. The Policy Board would
also be empowered to determine
the future development of the
program.
All other aspects of the
program would be administered
by the Director and his staff. At
present, SWOPSI leaders are still
looking for someone to assume
the half-time job, which carries
with it a salary of $3700. The
Director's duties-organizing and
submitting the courses, supplying
funds to groups, publishing the
SWOPSI catalog and overseeing

of workshop findings -will require
that he have a full time secretary.
