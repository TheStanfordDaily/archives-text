# Group Pressures Parties On War

### 
"Fantastic success" is the term
used by grad student Mike
Roessler to describe efforts to
involve local political elites in the
anti-war movement.
Some 100 students and half a
dozen professors are arranging
personal meetings with mayors,
city councils, party officials and
businessmen. They plan to explain
the divisive effect that the
Indochina war has on American
society and to mobilize them to
act through various political
channels to end it.
"Our message is that we are
deadly serious in this effort. We
tell the parties that we have
bodies funds and organization to
devote to electing those who agree
with us and defeating those who
do not." said Roessler.
"The influential people we meet
with usually compliment us on
working through channels. We
reply that this is the last chance
for the system to sell itself to the
univeristy community. If you
admire what we are doing you've
got to help make the system
work," they are told. They
frequently put us in contact with
other elites.
The non-partisan pressure

group has arranged introduction
of resolutions similar to the one
passed Monday in San Francisco,
opposing the war, into city
councils and voluntary
organizations in San Mateo and
Santa Clnra counties. Officials
from such concerns as Varian and
Wells Fargo have already met with
members of the task force.
