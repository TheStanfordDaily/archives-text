## Hardhats March In NY 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)
Steel -helmeted construction
workers led a throng estimated by
.i police source at 150,000 persons
in a City Hall rally and march
down Broadway Wednesday in
support of the administration's
Indochina war policy.
It was by far the largest
proadministration turnout in the
several years since masses have
oegun taking to the city's streets
to demonstrate for and against
Vietnam. It appeared to exceed
even a 1967 outpouring of
antiwar marchers, estimated by
police at the time to number
125,000.
Heavily policed, shepherded by
anion marshals, exhorted by their
leaders to keep their cool, the
marchers beneath American flags
made their way through
downtown Manhattan without
violence. Besides the hardhats, the
ranks included longshoremen and
office workers.
When trouble occasionally
seemed to threaten, police moved
in quickly. There were 3,800 of
them assigned.
'Hie lack of violence waS in
contrast to a May 8 rally, yhen
construction workers attacked,
beat and injured 70 antiwar
demonstrators and long-haired
youths in the same area.
The only reported injury
Wednesday was to a marcher hit
by a box of confetti thrown from
a skyscraper window. There was
one arrest of an antiwar
counterdemonstrator.

In Washington, some 1,200
lawyers, briefcases in hand,
lobbied with congressmen and
administration officials Thursday
for an end to the war in
Indochina.
Most of them were from New
York, down for the day by special
train and other means, and among
them were six young associates of
the law firm with which President
Nixon was associated before his
election.
A small group of the lawyers
spent 45 minutes with Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell.
Fresno hire
FRESNO (AP) - A state of
emergency was declared
Wednesday at Fresno State
College after small groups of
minority students went on a
destructive rampage through six
campus buildings, damaging art
works and destroying a $1 million
computer.
From 50 to 100 students
roamed through the buildings,
setting off fire alarms, breaking
windows and smashing chairs.
The computer was the first
casualty. A fire bomb was tossed
into the school's computer center,
destroying records that James
Fikes, acting executive vice
president, said "will affect
graduation, grades, anything on
the computer."
The rampage apparently was in
retaliation for the school's
decision not to rehire professors

in the minority education
program.
Demonstrators had chanted
"strike" as they roamed the halls.
A speaker in the college's free
speech area" said: "This is our
way of retaliating and the school
is closed."
Mao Denunciation
TOKYO (AP) — Mao Tse-tung
denounced "U.S. imperialism"
Wednesday and declared: "The
danger of a new world war still
exists and the people of all
countries must get prepared. But
revolution is the main trend of the
world today."
"While massacring the people in
other countries," the Chinese
leader said, "U.S. imperialism is
slaughtering the white and black
people in its own country.
"Nixon's fascist atrocities have
kindled the raging flames of the
revolutionary mass movement in
the United States. The Chinese
people firmly support the
revolutionary struggle of the
American people."
Mao accused the United States
of engineering "the reactionary
coup d'etat" in Cambodia that
overthrew Prince Norodom
Sihanouk as chief of state in
March. He said this action was
taken because the United States
was unable to win in Vietnam and
Laos."
A Communist informant in the
Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh,
said on Tuesday that the
Communist East Bloc had looked
into the coup and concluded the
United States had nothing to do
with it.

McCormack
WASHINGTON (AP)
Speaker John W. McCormack
announced today he will not seek
re-election to Congress in
November.
The 78-year-old Massachusetts
Democrat's decision presumably
paved the way for election of
Rep. Carl Albert of Oklahoma to
the speakership next January if
Democrats retain control of the
House.
Albert, who is 62, now is
majority floor leader.
Rep. Hale Boggs of Louisiana,
the present Democratic whip, is
next in line for Albert's job if it
becomes vacant. The powerful
Democratic Study Committee is
expected to run its own candidate
for the floor leadership, and to
support Albert for speaker.
Kosiygin hue
(AP) — Soviet Premier Alexei N.
Kosygin declared Wednesday he
will continue giving the Arabs
"extensive assistance" until Israel
heeds the U.N. Security Council
demand to get off Arab soil.
Kosygin made the vow as Israel
blasted the Security Council for
condemning the Israeli strikes
against guerrillas in Lebanon on
May 1 2 but making no mention of
terror attacks against Israeli
settlements which triggered the
raid.
"The Soviet Union is
consistently working for the
earliest political settlement in the

Steel -helmeted construction
workers led a throng estimated by
.i police source at 150,000 persons
in a City Hall rally and march
down Broadway Wednesday in
support of the administration's
Indochina war policy.
It was by far the largest
proadministration turnout in the
several years since masses have
oegun taking to the city's streets
to demonstrate for and against
Vietnam. It appeared to exceed
even a 1967 outpouring of
antiwar marchers, estimated by
police at the time to number
125,000.
Heavily policed, shepherded by
anion marshals, exhorted by their
leaders to keep their cool, the
marchers beneath American flags
made their way through
downtown Manhattan without
violence. Besides the hardhats, the
ranks included longshoremen and
office workers.
When trouble occasionally
seemed to threaten, police moved
in quickly. There were 3,800 of
them assigned.
'Hie lack of violence waS in
contrast to a May 8 rally, yhen
construction workers attacked,
beat and injured 70 antiwar
demonstrators and long-haired
youths in the same area.
The only reported injury
Wednesday was to a marcher hit
by a box of confetti thrown from
a skyscraper window. There was
one arrest of an antiwar
counterdemonstrator.

In Washington, some 1,200
lawyers, briefcases in hand,
lobbied with congressmen and
administration officials Thursday
for an end to the war in
Indochina.
Most of them were from New
York, down for the day by special
train and other means, and among
them were six young associates of
the law firm with which President
Nixon was associated before his
election.
A small group of the lawyers
spent 45 minutes with Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell.
Fresno hire
FRESNO (AP) - A state of
emergency was declared
Wednesday at Fresno State
College after small groups of
minority students went on a
destructive rampage through six
campus buildings, damaging art
works and destroying a $1 million
computer.
From 50 to 100 students
roamed through the buildings,
setting off fire alarms, breaking
windows and smashing chairs.
The computer was the first
casualty. A fire bomb was tossed
into the school's computer center,
destroying records that James
Fikes, acting executive vice
president, said "will affect
graduation, grades, anything on
the computer."
The rampage apparently was in
retaliation for the school's
decision not to rehire professors

in the minority education
program.
Demonstrators had chanted
"strike" as they roamed the halls.
A speaker in the college's free
speech area" said: "This is our
way of retaliating and the school
is closed."
Mao Denunciation
TOKYO (AP) — Mao Tse-tung
denounced "U.S. imperialism"
Wednesday and declared: "The
danger of a new world war still
exists and the people of all
countries must get prepared. But
revolution is the main trend of the
world today."
"While massacring the people in
other countries," the Chinese
leader said, "U.S. imperialism is
slaughtering the white and black
people in its own country.
"Nixon's fascist atrocities have
kindled the raging flames of the
revolutionary mass movement in
the United States. The Chinese
people firmly support the
revolutionary struggle of the
American people."
Mao accused the United States
of engineering "the reactionary
coup d'etat" in Cambodia that
overthrew Prince Norodom
Sihanouk as chief of state in
March. He said this action was
taken because the United States
was unable to win in Vietnam and
Laos."
A Communist informant in the
Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh,
said on Tuesday that the
Communist East Bloc had looked
into the coup and concluded the
United States had nothing to do
with it.

McCormack
WASHINGTON (AP)
Speaker John W. McCormack
announced today he will not seek
re-election to Congress in
November.
The 78-year-old Massachusetts
Democrat's decision presumably
paved the way for election of
Rep. Carl Albert of Oklahoma to
the speakership next January if
Democrats retain control of the
House.
Albert, who is 62, now is
majority floor leader.
Rep. Hale Boggs of Louisiana,
the present Democratic whip, is
next in line for Albert's job if it
becomes vacant. The powerful
Democratic Study Committee is
expected to run its own candidate
for the floor leadership, and to
support Albert for speaker.
Kosiygin hue

blasted the Security Council for
condemning the Israeli strikes
against guerrillas in Lebanon on
May 1 2 but making no mention of
terror attacks against Israeli
settlements which triggered the
raid.

.i police source at 150,000 persons
in a City Hall rally and march
down Broadway Wednesday in
support of the administration's
Indochina war policy.
It was by far the largest
proadministration turnout in the
several years since masses have
oegun taking to the city's streets
to demonstrate for and against
Vietnam. It appeared to exceed
even a 1967 outpouring of
antiwar marchers, estimated by
police at the time to number
125,000.
Heavily policed, shepherded by
anion marshals, exhorted by their
leaders to keep their cool, the
marchers beneath American flags
made their way through
downtown Manhattan without
violence. Besides the hardhats, the
ranks included longshoremen and
office workers.
When trouble occasionally
seemed to threaten, police moved
in quickly. There were 3,800 of
them assigned.
'Hie lack of violence waS in
contrast to a May 8 rally, yhen
construction workers attacked,
beat and injured 70 antiwar
demonstrators and long-haired
youths in the same area.
The only reported injury
Wednesday was to a marcher hit
by a box of confetti thrown from
a skyscraper window. There was
one arrest of an antiwar
counterdemonstrator.

In Washington, some 1,200
lawyers, briefcases in hand,
lobbied with congressmen and
administration officials Thursday
for an end to the war in
Indochina.
Most of them were from New
York, down for the day by special
train and other means, and among
them were six young associates of
the law firm with which President
Nixon was associated before his
election.
A small group of the lawyers
spent 45 minutes with Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell.
Fresno hire
FRESNO (AP) - A state of
emergency was declared
Wednesday at Fresno State
College after small groups of
minority students went on a
destructive rampage through six
campus buildings, damaging art
works and destroying a $1 million
computer.
From 50 to 100 students
roamed through the buildings,
setting off fire alarms, breaking
windows and smashing chairs.
The computer was the first
casualty. A fire bomb was tossed
into the school's computer center,
destroying records that James
Fikes, acting executive vice
president, said "will affect
graduation, grades, anything on
the computer."
The rampage apparently was in
retaliation for the school's
decision not to rehire professors

in the minority education
program.
Demonstrators had chanted
"strike" as they roamed the halls.
A speaker in the college's free
speech area" said: "This is our
way of retaliating and the school
is closed."
Mao Denunciation
TOKYO (AP) — Mao Tse-tung
denounced "U.S. imperialism"
Wednesday and declared: "The
danger of a new world war still
exists and the people of all
countries must get prepared. But
revolution is the main trend of the
world today."
"While massacring the people in
other countries," the Chinese
leader said, "U.S. imperialism is
slaughtering the white and black
people in its own country.
"Nixon's fascist atrocities have
kindled the raging flames of the
revolutionary mass movement in
the United States. The Chinese
people firmly support the
revolutionary struggle of the
American people."
Mao accused the United States
of engineering "the reactionary
coup d'etat" in Cambodia that
overthrew Prince Norodom
Sihanouk as chief of state in
March. He said this action was
taken because the United States
was unable to win in Vietnam and
Laos."
A Communist informant in the
Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh,
said on Tuesday that the
Communist East Bloc had looked
into the coup and concluded the
United States had nothing to do
with it.

McCormack
WASHINGTON (AP)
Speaker John W. McCormack
announced today he will not seek
re-election to Congress in
November.
The 78-year-old Massachusetts
Democrat's decision presumably
paved the way for election of
Rep. Carl Albert of Oklahoma to
the speakership next January if
Democrats retain control of the
House.
Albert, who is 62, now is
majority floor leader.
Rep. Hale Boggs of Louisiana,
the present Democratic whip, is
next in line for Albert's job if it
becomes vacant. The powerful
Democratic Study Committee is
expected to run its own candidate
for the floor leadership, and to
support Albert for speaker.
Kosiygin hue
(AP) — Soviet Premier Alexei N.
Kosygin declared Wednesday he
will continue giving the Arabs
"extensive assistance" until Israel
heeds the U.N. Security Council
demand to get off Arab soil.
Kosygin made the vow as Israel
blasted the Security Council for
condemning the Israeli strikes
against guerrillas in Lebanon on
May 1 2 but making no mention of
terror attacks against Israeli
settlements which triggered the
raid.
"The Soviet Union is
consistently working for the
earliest political settlement in the
Middle East," Kosygin said in
messages to the Shah of Iran and
the president of Turkey
