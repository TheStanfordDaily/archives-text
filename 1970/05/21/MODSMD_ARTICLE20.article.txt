# Vice-Pres. For Research
## Miller DOD Statement 
### 
The following is information released last week by W.F. Miller,
University Vice President for Research. It deals primarily with
University Research Funding.—Ed.
The purpose of the following information, taken largely from my
presentation to the Senate on April 2, is to-afford you an overview of
the relationship of the DOD-supported research contracts and grants
to the overall research program at Stanford.

Classified Research
Classified research projects proscribed by the change in research
policy last April 24 in the Senate resolution regarding secrecy in
research are being brought to an orderly termination in accord with
that resolution. Peripherally classified projects as so defined in the
resolution continue. The last classified research contract will be
concluded by August 31, 1970. All other DOD projects conform to
the Senate policy currently in effect. Advice on effecting the policy is
sought from the Senate.
OTHER INFORMATION
1. Number of DODContracts and Grants Active at 4/30/70:
Engineering 64 48%
Physical Sciences 54 40%
Social and Medical Sciences 16 12%
134 100%
2. Personnel Supported by These Projects:
We currently estimate we have (he following numbers of Stanford
participants:
Faculty: Principal Investigators 97
Associated Faculty 145*
Students 300*
Staff Personnel 260*
♦Estimate
We must recognize that these numbers are not very specific and are
minimum numbers. For example, many students and faculty use the
equipment, laboratories, computers, and materials provided by these
projects in addition to those who derive direct assistantship and

dissertation support from the projects. These projects often provide
travel funds (although meager) for seminar speakers who may address
a group considerably larger than those directly associated with the
projects.
New Research Directions
We are providing administrative support to faculty efforts in
seeking funding for new research directions. Through the Research
Information Center in my office, staff ellorts are provided in
identifying and obtaining agency funding and in facilitating the
formation of multi-disciplinary faculty groups in such areas as health
services research, urban affairs research and environmental quality
control.
We have identified some specific sources of funding for these types
of activities: National Science Foundation:
NSF is proposing a program for fiscal year 1971 which will provide
support for institutionaldevelopment in solving the nation s pressing
problems. The Foundation is requesting an additional 14 million
dollars for grants to:
1. Strengthen departments of the social sciences;
2. Develop new departments and centers to deal with such
problems as depletion of resources and environmental pollution; and
3. Aid new departments such as those in engineering which show
willingness to experiment and to show leadership in promoting
educational programs.
NSF also has a $13 million program to support interdisciplinary
research on problems relevant to society. Such research is anticipated
to be of the kind undertaken by the centers developed by the above
mentioned program.
The Foundation is also encouraging submission of student-initiated
research projects which will be supported if funding is appropriated in
FY 1971.
Public Health Services:
Public Health Service is soliciting proposals for developing and
producing models for evaluation of comprehensive health planning
agencies and the development of health care delivery systems.
Department of Housing and Urban Development:
Preliminary discussions have been held between University faculty
and representatives of HUD to explore the possibility ol obtaining
support for basic research in the housing and urban development area.
Department of Transportation:
Preliminary reviews of Department of Transportation/Federal
Aviation Association material indicates the possibility that Stanford's
computer technology can be related to Air Traffic Control.
Additionally, it is anticipated that some of the faculty expertise might
be matched with the needs of the Urban Mass Transportation
Authority (UMTA).
The funding level for basic research is at best even with previous
years and considering inflation is actually decreasing. The only present
area of incremental growth is in multidisciplinarv programs, and even
here the number of dollars on a nationwide basis is at best 30 million
dollars. The formation of multidisciplinary research teams is not an
automatic process within the University and takes time to accomplish.
Therefore, of this $30 million growth potential, Stanford University
might realize 4 percent of $1.2 million.
