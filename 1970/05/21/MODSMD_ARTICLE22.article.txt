## Senate Filibuster 
### CATHY COOPER 
A Senate filibuster is among
those events reported by four
political science majors who are
monitoring legislative maneuvers
in Washington " as anti-war
legislation reaches the Congress.
A filibuster by Senate hawks
developed yesterday, according to
the team, against the
Cooper-Church amendment to cut
off funds to U.S. troops in
Cambodia after July 1. The tactic
is apparently designed to outwait
public outrage over the invasion.
Hawks hope that wavering
Senators who might now support
the amendment will help defeat it
when the public pressure dies out.
"The Administration is
devoting as much energy to
defeating the anti-war
amendments now in Congress as it
did to gain confirmation of
Carswell and Haynsworth,"
reports Craig Malone.
He continued, "The Anderson
resolution in the House and the
Scott resolution in the Senate are
Administration attempts to
appease war critics while still
espousing the President's line.
They give the President a blank
check to escalate or deescalate the
war at his discretion while he
pursues an 'honorable peace."
The Anderson and Scott
resolutions are ineffectual because
they are resolutions only and lack
the real impact that the
Cooper-Church and
Hatfield-McGovern amendments
would have by virtue of cutting
off funds for the war, according
to John Ferejohn.
Malone, Ferejohn, Kristen

Carson and Gale Harrington make
twice daily phone calls to the
senatorial offices of McGovern
and Hatfield from a Congressional
nerve center in the Institute of
Political studies as part of the
Indochina Political Action Group
(IP AG). The information they
gather is channelled to other
campus groups to gain th»> greatest
effect from letter writing
campaigns.
One story gleaned by the
quartet reports that Senator
Mansfield called Senator
McGovern asking McGovern to lay
off the campaign to influence him
since his office could no longer
handle the influx of mail.
Congressman Pete McCloskey
has joined Representatives Frase
and Reigle in sponsoring a House
resolution similar to the Senate's
Hatfield-McGovern amendment.
Nine Republicans and nine
Democrats have agreed to support
the move to limit defense
expenditures in Vietnam to the
amount necessary for withdrawal.
The bill is assured of 150 votes
and would stand a good chance of
passage if the Senate approved the
Hatfield-McGovern amendment,
said Kristen Carson.
McCloskey complained to the
Stanford group that he has
received about 1000 pieces of
mail from people living in Rep.

Guber's district which incluc
Stanford. There is a tendency
the pari of the public to write
congressmen already sympathe
to the anti-war cause, continu
McCloskey, rather than to the
congressmen who must
pressured to move against t
expansion of hostilities.
Professor Alexander George
the Indochina Political Acti
Group has suggested that lett«
be written to Secretary Fin
urging him to speak out agaii
the war. To the extent th
Cabinet member has
independent base of support
can take stand at odds with t
Administration's positi
reasoned George.
The status of t
Cooper-Church amendment to c
off funds for military ac -
inside Cambodia after July
looks good according to Malor
The amendment may come up 112
a vote today or tomorrow. Tht
Senators are reportedly
undecided: Anderson, N.fl
Bible, N.M.; Burdick N.D.; Byi
W.Va.; Cannon, Nev.; Cook,
Cotton, N.H.; Domminick, Cc

McCloskey complained to the
Stanford group that he has
received about 1000 pieces of
mail from people living in Rep.

congressmen already sympathe

A Senate filibuster is among
those events reported by four
political science majors who are
monitoring legislative maneuvers
in Washington " as anti-war
legislation reaches the Congress.
A filibuster by Senate hawks
developed yesterday, according to
the team, against the
Cooper-Church amendment to cut
off funds to U.S. troops in
Cambodia after July 1. The tactic
is apparently designed to outwait
public outrage over the invasion.
Hawks hope that wavering
Senators who might now support
the amendment will help defeat it
when the public pressure dies out.
"The Administration is
devoting as much energy to
defeating the anti-war
amendments now in Congress as it
did to gain confirmation of
Carswell and Haynsworth,"
reports Craig Malone.
He continued, "The Anderson
resolution in the House and the
Scott resolution in the Senate are
Administration attempts to
appease war critics while still
espousing the President's line.
They give the President a blank
check to escalate or deescalate the
war at his discretion while he
pursues an 'honorable peace."
The Anderson and Scott
resolutions are ineffectual because
they are resolutions only and lack
the real impact that the
Cooper-Church and
Hatfield-McGovern amendments
would have by virtue of cutting
off funds for the war, according
to John Ferejohn.
Malone, Ferejohn, Kristen

Carson and Gale Harrington make
twice daily phone calls to the
senatorial offices of McGovern
and Hatfield from a Congressional
nerve center in the Institute of
Political studies as part of the
