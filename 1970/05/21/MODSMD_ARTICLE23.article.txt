# Chilly Golfers Flag Down Title

It took a team supply of
"Johnny Hand warmers" to enable
the squad to even grip their clubs,
! ut by the time the sun had
' irned through the El Cerrito
'loud over, Tom Keelin had
banged home a birdie putt and
Pete Harpster had charged back
from a dismal start to give
Stanford the needed stroke to
bring home the 1970 Pac-H Golf
Championship.
A scant five strokes separated
Stanford from fourth place LICLA
as the 72 hole tournament closed
out Tuesday afternoon in a battle
that wasn't decided until
Hamster's uutt dropped on the

final green.
The Indians finished one stroke
up on Oregon while always tough
USC nailed down the third spot,
two strokes off the pace.
It was a gruelling tournament
for all participants. Besides
playing .'36 holes of golf apiece on
each of the two days, the golfers
from the Pac-8 schools were faced
with a bitter wind sweeping up off
the Bay, and visibility was limited
by clouds hanging low over the
Berkeley hills. A search of the rule
book yielded no provisions for
Fog Bound Rules. "That wind
really made it tough for all the
players," commented Coach Bud
Finger following the match.

"You'd hit a ball into the wind
and suddenly it would die away or
else get blown off target
completely."
UCLA came to the tournament
prepared, and, due largely to their
handwarmers which they weren't
inclined to share, led at the end o!
the first two rounds.
The Indians fought fire with
fire on Tuesday and made a quid,
stop at the sporting goods store
for their own supply of portable
heat before heading up to the
course. It made a big difference.
Freshman John Beers, a native
Arizonan who isn't accustomed to
May in the Bay Area, wasn't even
in the money on Monday, but
carded an unbelievable 32, the
tournament low for nine holes, on
Tuesday morning.
As the threesomes and
foursomes teed off for the third
and fourth rounds, the Bruins
were still the ones to catch.
Tom Watson, Vanier, and
Keelin finished the third round
with 71-73-76 respectively, while
SC's Gary Sanders and Oregon's
Craig Griswold toured the course
with respectable scores to keep
the pressure on.
On the eighteenth hole of his
final round, a hole that had given
everybody fits, Keelin canned a
two foot putt for the birdie that
gave the Tribe a one stroke edge.
Out on the course, things
weren't going quite as smoothly
for Pete Harpster, Stanford's last
man to leave the tee.
His initial shot on the first hole
sailed onto another fairway where
it simply vanished. "There wasn't
any rough or anything," said
Finger. "The ball was just gobbled
up."
A little shook, Hapster dropped
a ball, proceeded to bogey the
next two holes, and found himself
four over par at the end of three.
Playing with Griswold and Dave
Glenz, Oregon's two top men,
didn't make life any easier.
"He played the next fifteen like
a pro," said Finger. "He really

pulled it out for us despite the
pressure."
With all those who had finished
ahead of him crossing their fingers
and holding their breath, Harpster
stroked a soft putt that clattered
into the cup to give the Tribe the
title, their third in the eleven year
history of the event.
Harpster will join Watson,
Vanier and Keelin at the NCAA
Championships to be played at
Ohio in June. Beers, Larry Cram,
and Clem Richardson will duel
one another for the other
remaining spot.
