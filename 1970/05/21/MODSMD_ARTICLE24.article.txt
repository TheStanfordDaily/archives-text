# Fun And Games
## To The Top! 
### John Arthur 
At two o'clock one recent Saturday afternoon, when most sports
freaks were attending to conventional pastimes like guzzling beer in
Candlestick Park or lounging, half-asleep, on some splintery bleachers,
this scribe was on his hands and knees negotiating the narrow space
between the giant log and the ground, somewhere in Yosemite
.National Park.
The expressed purpose of this humbling maneuver was to reach the
other side of the log and to continue from there an apparently futile
assault on an unnamed Yosemite peak. Why this assault was being
made in the first place escapes me.
The day had started more than five hours earlier for a motley
collection of a few dozen quasi-mountaineers in the parking lot of a
;cenic turnout straddling Highway 120, high on Yosemite's north
side. Needless to say, only the fact that your correspondent had been
spirited away from the customary vices of the flatlands the day before
permitted his presence so early in the day in these hills.
Over Hill and Dale
The morning was spent in relatively innocent fashion, plodding
long a well-trod path, over hill, dale, sparkling streams and foaming
livers, en route to a woodsman's lunch of Hershey bars and
Seven-Ups. But just as we were reclining on a particularly pleasant
rock for a few hours of Z's, an aquaintance appeared, speaking
excitedly and pointing his finger at a large grey mass in the distance.
"You goin' up with us?"
The object of his ambitions, it seemed, was a huge hunk of rock,
.eparated from the surrounding forest by what looked to be sheer
cliffs on all sides. It was, in my view, inpenetrable, and I declined his
offer.
Not surprisingly, however, a few minutes later I was bound for the
lop. It's part of the tortured mystique of mountaineering that one
customarily does what one has no right to be doing, and in this case
I'd simply offered the feeble excuse "Well, I'll go as far as I can . . ."
As it turned out, our small band penetrated the forest and the
dense shrubbery which surrounded the rock, but no one, not even the
red-hots, could figure out how to reach the peak's summit. So, we
came back.
By this point I was becoming increasingly puzzled as to why
normally sane individuals want to do things like climbing mountains,
grovell through vines and bushes and generally wear themselves out
getting nowhere.
The View's The Thing
People like to climb mountains, 1 found, for the following reasons.
Some like the peace and genuine quite that only remote hills and
valleys afford these days. Some eco freaks groove on the flora and
fauna, along with the air, which they call "clean." Others, like my
companion on this day just like to get to the top so they can sit and
look at the view, an exercise which seems to me a sort of arduous
method of sneak-previewing postcards which can be purchased in
more accessibleareap. Then, of course, there are the folks who really
don't know why they like it. They're like Sir Edmund Hillary, who,
asked why he scaled Mt. Everest, proclaimed beguilingly, "Because it's
there."
One other angle my research uncovered was the different species of
hikers, who, like bleacher bums, fall into several distinct categories.
First are the rabid fanatics, the guys who appear on the trail with
European short pants (sometimes called "Lederhosen"), trail maps
«nd a rusty yodel. Then there are the knickered red-hots - the types
who sprint along the ridges, and hopscotch across streams on the
rocks even when bridges are available. Finally, on any event like the
recent Father Duryea - led Newman Club hike, one discovers the
neophytes - people like the sunglassed stroller attired in white Addidas
shoes and a UCLA sweatshirt, the women in clean slacks and stiff
hiking boots and the checkered-shirted city slickers who think a
"scenic-turnout" is some kind of a weird trip.
It's all worth while, I suppose, although I confess that the entire
experience seemed to be a futile attempt to teach this old bleacher
bum new tricks.

between the giant log and the ground, somewhere in Yosemite
.National Park.
The expressed purpose of this humbling maneuver was to reach the
other side of the log and to continue from there an apparently futile
assault on an unnamed Yosemite peak. Why this assault was being
made in the first place escapes me.
The day had started more than five hours earlier for a motley
collection of a few dozen quasi-mountaineers in the parking lot of a
;cenic turnout straddling Highway 120, high on Yosemite's north
side. Needless to say, only the fact that your correspondent had been
spirited away from the customary vices of the flatlands the day before
permitted his presence so early in the day in these hills.
Over Hill and Dale
The morning was spent in relatively innocent fashion, plodding
long a well-trod path, over hill, dale, sparkling streams and foaming
livers, en route to a woodsman's lunch of Hershey bars and
Seven-Ups. But just as we were reclining on a particularly pleasant
rock for a few hours of Z's, an aquaintance appeared, speaking
excitedly and pointing his finger at a large grey mass in the distance.
"You goin' up with us?"
The object of his ambitions, it seemed, was a huge hunk of rock,
.eparated from the surrounding forest by what looked to be sheer
cliffs on all sides. It was, in my view, inpenetrable, and I declined his
offer.
Not surprisingly, however, a few minutes later I was bound for the
lop. It's part of the tortured mystique of mountaineering that one
customarily does what one has no right to be doing, and in this case
I'd simply offered the feeble excuse "Well, I'll go as far as I can . . ."
As it turned out, our small band penetrated the forest and the
dense shrubbery which surrounded the rock, but no one, not even the
red-hots, could figure out how to reach the peak's summit. So, we
came back.
By this point I was becoming increasingly puzzled as to why
normally sane individuals want to do things like climbing mountains,
grovell through vines and bushes and generally wear themselves out
getting nowhere.
The View's The Thing
People like to climb mountains, 1 found, for the following reasons.
Some like the peace and genuine quite that only remote hills and
valleys afford these days. Some eco freaks groove on the flora and
fauna, along with the air, which they call "clean." Others, like my
companion on this day just like to get to the top so they can sit and
look at the view, an exercise which seems to me a sort of arduous
method of sneak-previewing postcards which can be purchased in
more accessibleareap. Then, of course, there are the folks who really
don't know why they like it. They're like Sir Edmund Hillary, who,
asked why he scaled Mt. Everest, proclaimed beguilingly, "Because it's
there."
One other angle my research uncovered was the different species of
hikers, who, like bleacher bums, fall into several distinct categories.
First are the rabid fanatics, the guys who appear on the trail with
European short pants (sometimes called "Lederhosen"), trail maps
«nd a rusty yodel. Then there are the knickered red-hots - the types
who sprint along the ridges, and hopscotch across streams on the
rocks even when bridges are available. Finally, on any event like the
recent Father Duryea - led Newman Club hike, one discovers the
neophytes - people like the sunglassed stroller attired in white Addidas
shoes and a UCLA sweatshirt, the women in clean slacks and stiff
hiking boots and the checkered-shirted city slickers who think a
"scenic-turnout" is some kind of a weird trip.
It's all worth while, I suppose, although I confess that the entire
experience seemed to be a futile attempt to teach this old bleacher
bum new tricks.
At two o'clock one recent Saturday afternoon, when most sports
freaks were attending to conventional pastimes like guzzling beer in
Candlestick Park or lounging, half-asleep, on some splintery bleachers,
this scribe was on his hands and knees negotiating the narrow space
between the giant log and the ground, somewhere in Yosemite
.National Park.
