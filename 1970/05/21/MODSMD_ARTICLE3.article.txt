# 'No Cap And Gown' Refunds Swell Peace Candidate Fund
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
As the No Cap and Gown drive gains
momentum, questions have been raised concerning
the motives for abandoning the traditional garb
and about the mechanisms to be used to identify
the peace candidates to be aided by the Peace
Commencement Fund.
"We feel that it is important that faculty and
students depart from the traditional dress at
commencement both to register dissent with U.S.
war policies and to contribute in a significant way
to the election of peace candidates of both parties
in November, said Barry Ensminger, a member of
the No Cap and Gown Committee.
"We are emphasizing the voluntary nature of
the gesture. There is no intent to make the wearing
of cap and gown indicate a pro-war attitude," he
stresses. "Rather, those who forego the cap and
gown are registering their outrage at the Indochina
War."
Hie money generated from refunds on cap and

>â–  wn rentals will form part of the National Peace
commencement Fund. Each of the 12 national
regions will hold a caucus of participating schools
in June to select representatives for the national
convention.
That convention will select the critical races
where financial support could elect a peace
candidate. Political analysts will assist the group in
its allocation of the projected one million dollars
to peace candidates of either party.
Ensminger urges seniors and graduate students
to join those who have already pledged support for
the Peace Commencement Fund by signing a
waiver form in front of the bookstore or by
sending receipts to No Cap and Gown, Box '2992.
The University commencement committee has
stated that individuals will be permitted to take
part in the exercises without academic garb.
"Support for no cap and gown has grown
significantly as people have realized that our
protest will bo non-disruptive," says Dixon Kelly,
senior class president.
