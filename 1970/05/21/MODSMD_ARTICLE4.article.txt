# Sponsor Selectors, Objectors Confer
## 
### 
Members of the sponsor
selection committee and Doan of
Students Peter Bulkeley met
Tuesday afternoon with students
who raised objections to the
selection procedure.
Tom Dawson, a sponsor in
Trancos and one of the dissidents,
said afterwards, "Nothing was

finally decided."
Dawson refrained from
commenting on the specific
complaints raised by himself and
other students who he said had
been following the sponsor
selection procedure since its
inception.
"The objections were
procedural," he said. "They had
nothing to do with political bias
in the interviewing."
The complaints involved
departures from what the critics
understood to be the agreed-upon
selection procedure. Their views,
Dawon stated, . . were based in
part on the written procedure and
in part on what everyone
concerned agrees were general
understandings."
Head sponsor Caroline Bixby
commented last night, "I don't
think anything is going to happen
to the sponsor selection program
at this time."
Dean Bulkeley asked to be
exempt from comment at this
time. He pointed out that, .. as
Caroline Bixby was quoted as
saying in yesterday's | Tuesday's |
Daily, the sponsor selection has
not been finalized."
Pat C. Shea, a member of the
newly elected Council of
Presidents, also attended the
meeting. The office of the Council
of Presidents has also been
examining the selection procedure
in response to student complaints.
