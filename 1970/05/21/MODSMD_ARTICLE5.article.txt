# $2000 Damage
## Fire Destroys Barns 
### 
An early-morning fire, believed
set by arsonists, destroyed two
old barns and $2000 worth of
equipment yesterday. Four false
alarms, originating at opposite
ends of the campus, were reported
within 25 minutes of the fire.
Firemen reported that the
barns were of litttle value. Four
horses stabled in them were saved
when firemen let them out before
flames engulfed the buildings. The
equipment destroyed was mostly
saddlery.
The burned-out barns are
located near Santa Teresa Street
and Los Arboles Drive on the
western edge of campus.
The barns were leased to the
University by Jack McKenna,
former manager of Tresidder
Union's bowling alleys.

The Santa Gara County Fire
Marshal) 's office was reported
investigating the blazes.
The false alarms delayed and
confused the Fire Department.
The first alarm was turned in at
1 :41 a.m. At 1 :43, the fire in the
barns was reported. Shortly
before 2 a.m., two alarms were
pulled near Lagunita Court, where
a fire broke out in a dumpmaster
container. At 2:03 a.m., a final
alarm was turned in on the east
side of Wilbur Hall and Campus
Drive.
Following the blaze, two
Molotov cocktails were found on
a path between Roble Hall and
the boathouse. A gardener
discovered the bombs, in a paper
bag, about 8:30 a.m. The Santa
Clara County Fire Marshall's
office, which is analyzing the

devices, declined to give further
details.
A week ago, five Molotov
cocktails were found in Frost
Ampitheater. Last month, three
firebombs were thrown at FCM
headquarters on Lane B, scorching
some outside paint, but causing
little damage.
Other small fires have occurred
across campus in recent weeks.
Last Friday, a blaze damaged a
staircase in Polya Hall. Fires in the
UGLY, a construction shack near
Encina Hall, and trash containers
have also been reported.


BURNED BARN: Arsonists set two barns on the campus afire last night. As lliey burned and the horses inhabiting them
whinnied, Stanford fire engines chased after a number of false alarlms.
