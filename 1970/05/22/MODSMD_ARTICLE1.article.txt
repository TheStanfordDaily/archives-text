# Professor Resigns In Protest
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
"It is generally assumed that
universities are 'ivory towers,'"
noted Dr. W.K.H. Panofsky in a
talk to the SLAC staff, "and the
public notion of the ivory tower is
that it is inhabited by scholars
who study and teach in isolation
from the world around them.
"But this is not so. A long time
ago my father made an historical
study of the origin of the concept
of the ivory tower, and in so
doing, he identified the salient
features of this symbol. On the
one hand, an ivory tower contains
scholarly people pursuing their
inquiries. At the same time, the
ivory tower is tall, so that those
students and scholars who climb
to the top can see far around
them and therefore they may
possibly perceive danger to the
society sooner than those on the
ground.
"This story," continued Dr.
Panofsky, "symbolizes why there
is nothing incompatible in SLAC's
'keeping its nose to the
grindstone' in the pursuit of
untangling fundamental facts of
nature, while at the same time
being aware of the world around
us and trying to dissipate some of
the ignorance which beclouds
current issues."
During the past two weeks of
national and international crisis,
university departments found
themselves becoming aware of
their relationship to the "world"
that Dr. Panofsky refers to. What
posture can a department assume,
given it feels that it must react to
an emergency situation? What are
the implications of a department's
taking a political stand.
Individual Conscience
The decision to strike or not to
strike was not taken easily by
many Stanford departments;

many departments honestly felt
they could not take a
departmental stand in relation to
the Cambodian invasion and the
deaths of six students at Kent
State and Jackson State -even
though the overwhelming
majority of students and faculty
were angered and frustrated. One
department, the department of
Economics, simply urged faculty
and students to follow their
individual conscience, and, partly
in response, Associate Professor
Serge-Christophe Kolm resigned.
Questions do remain, however,
as to how much risk Professor
Kolm was encountering by
resigning, and his motives. His
criticisms of departmental policy
have been countered by professors
who feel that the decision not to
strike, per se, was very defensible.
Essentially, Professor Kolm
seems to feel that his department
did not react "positively" and
agrily to the national and
international situation -develop
ments that he felt had to be
spoken to. It was inconceivable to
him that his department -not to
mention the University -should
not do all within its means to
oppose the Cambodian invasion.
His frustration and anger with his
department's alleged "weak"
stand, coupled with his intense
feeling about Stanford's
relationship to the American war
effort, and to the University's
calling of police to break-up the
second Old Union sit-in,
prompted him to submit his
resignation to President Pitzer.
Three Issues
Associate Professor
Serge-Christophe Kolm of the
Economics Department, in his
letter of resignation, spoke on
three issues;

in his letter of resignation, spoke
on three issues;
"Considering, 1) the continuing
participation of Stanford
University by way of military
training and research, in the mass
murder perpetrated by the U.S.
Government in IndoChina.
2) the fact that the
Administration of Stanford
University called the police whom
I personally saw brutalize the
people assembled in a peaceful
gathering in the Old Union
building on the evening of April
29.
3) the morally repulsive
rejection of elementary Academic
solidarity decided by the Faculty
of the Department of Economics
on May 1 0, as a petty attempt to
put pressure on instructors who
would have chosen to follow -in a
way academically harmless to
students -the strike against the
war,
"I can no longer remain an
implicit accomplice to these deeds
and therefore submit my
resignation from my position as
Associate Professor of Economics
at Stanford University."
"Extraordinary Week"
In Professor Kolm's view, the
Economics Department did not
"go on strike." The official
faculty position, in a statement of
policy for the week of May 4-9,
was that the week was designated
as "extraordinary," in which "the
normal academic functions of the
Economics Department, including
scheduled classes, will be
maintained according to the
individual consciences of faculty
and students." The statement also
noted that "the faculty is
responsive to the students'
invitation to participate in a series
of extraordinary seminars"-
which were held during the week.

Department Chairman,
Professor Ronald McKinnon,
reached last night by the I>ail>,
said he saw nothing unreasonable
in the faculty position, and
explained that students and
faculty were free to make as
flexible arrangements as were
desired during that week and the
weeks following. He pointed out
that while most classes did meet
during the week, most had very
poor attendance.
In Professor Kolm's view,
however, leaving strike activity
and department "solidarity" up to
the individual professor and his
students was very near to a
"cop-out" on the whole issue of a
strike and organized departmental
protest against the Cambodian
invasion. "A strike," declared
Kolm, "was the very least, the
very smallest thing, the
department could have done; it
could have, and should have, been
part of the Stanford protest and
the national strike. But the
department would not go that
far -which was hardly far at all.
The point is, how could you not
join in this protest against this
awful war?"
McKinnon Distrubed
Professor McKinnon said that
he was very disturbed over Kolm's
accusations and dramatic letter of
resignation and feared pointless
confrontation within the
department over "small matters."
He noted that Professor Kolm
disagreed only once in faculty
discussion, and this was over
possible University sanctions
against faculty who did not fulfill
their obligations to the University
because of participation in the
strike.
''Furthermore," added
Professor McKinnon, "It is
obviously costless for Professor

Kolm to resign, simply because he
has had a very lucrative offer
waiting him at the University of
Montreal, some time before this
political upheaval. The point
might be made that he was going
to leave anyway, before he
submitted his dramatic letter of
resignation."
In an interview with the Daily,
Kolm made no mention of this
offer, saying only that he is
investigating several possible
teaching positions, one in Canada,
another at the Sorbonne, where
he is an honorary professor. He
does feel that if he moves to
another American university, he
will probably face identical
problems with involvement with
the war.
Professor McKinnon pointed
out that at the end of the
"extraordinary week," strategy
was decided for the rest of the
quarter, and the department was
going to be "very liberal" with
respect to incompletes, pass-fails,
and dropping courses-but that
the faculty and department have
obligations to those who wish to
finish normal academic work.
Suspend Classes
Professor Kolm suggested that
if the department would not
participate as actively in the strike
as, for example, the East Asian
Studies Department, the
Economics Department should at
least adopt the attitude of the
German Department-which
declared, "We are suspending
normal classes in order to devote
our time and energy to discuss
with our students the issues
underlying the current crisis both
in the University and in the
Nation." However, Kolm
declared, "The point is that the
Economics Department was
clearly unwilling to strike."
"Perhaps what I am even more
angry about is that, because
professors were allowed to
individually determine strike

participation, some wore able to
adopt an attitude of 'if the
students feel so strongly about
their striking, then let them feel
the cost.' These professors made it
very difficult for students to
strike; there should have been a
faculty-wide policy."
Telegram Sent
Oil May 3, after a meeting of
most of Ihe department's faculty,
twenty-three professors sent a
signed telegram to President
Nixon "strongly protesting the
recent actions in sending U.S.
troops into Cambodia." They
went on to say that "we think this
tragic error can do nothing to
further U.S. national interests
abroad. We denounce you for
perpetrating this reprehensible act
in the name of the American
people."
Although he was not at that
meeting to help draft the
telegram, Professor Kolm said that
he strongly disagreed on
principle with some of the
wording. "A crime is not an
error," he declared. "It really
doesn't seem to me an 'angry'
telegram at all; I personally feel
that these statements were made
just to show the Economics
students that the professors were
'with them.' In fact, 1 understand
that there was some debate as to
whether to label the invasion
'immoral,' and because some
people felt they somehow
couldn't call it that, it was
stricken."
"The sending of the telegram
seems to imply that the
Economics Department was in
some way "on strike"-but
remember that many of these
professors are very unwilling to
take decisive action, like striking,
like changing the order of business
at the department. The only real
concern seems to be that normal
activity should continue; but, you
just can't have the status quo as a
moral stand."
