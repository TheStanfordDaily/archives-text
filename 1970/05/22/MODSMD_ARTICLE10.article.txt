# One Man's Fantasy
## Choose Insanity 
### Nick Selby 
An old friend confronted me in the English department the other
day and expressed annoyance with my recent columns. In his normal
cursory manner, he complained, "I read your columns, but I can't
make 'head nor tail' of them. I don't identify with them AT ALL."
After this seeming reproach, the professor hurried away to do some
mimeographing.
Gentle readers, allow me to escape from my fantasy world into
yours for just a few moments. I will try to be serious with you for the
first time in ages. I do not, however, promise I will make any more
sense than I usually do or anyone else doe-.
But let's try to see where we agree or disagree.
First, it seems quite obvious from the events of the last few weeks
that this country gives a damn for only one thing - property. Eight
blacks were killed - murdered in cold blood - by white policemen in
two separate incidents in the South last week and the nation yawned.
True, the nation responded to the tragedy of the four Kent State
murders with something approaching "concern." But even the death
of four white students did not mean that the power structure either
was threatened or had to move more hastily toward a solution of the
problems facing this country.
But as soon as black or white militants start to burn cities and
arsenals and/or break windows, i.e., to destroy property, the power
structure (as I understand it) reacted with something more than
sympathy. So far, the Nixon administration and, to a large degree, the
Stanford administration has chosen to react by counter-attacking and
repressing the militant dissidents. Witness the SJC trials and the recent
arrests.
In short, when a nation can waste 42,000 lives and see countless
hundreds of thousands of young men return home wounded or dying,
when it can continue to escalate a war that promises even more death,
all for nothing, then it is quite obvious that the "leaders" of that
nation do not give a damn about human lives, American, Vietnamese,
or whatever. Perhaps America once did, but it doesn't seem to any
longer. The catch-all-interest words are money and property. The
nation's "soul," whatever it was, if it ever was, chokes in a smog of
death and material concerns.
I am terribly afraid there can be little debate over the abysmal
reality of the United States. And if the nation does react only to
property loss, how then can we fail to understand that the only way,
in realistic terms of power, to destroy the decadent power structure is
to attack the property of that power structure?
I don't mean canvassing, collecting signatures for petitions, talking
with "Silent Majority" folk or anything like that. When I say attack, I
mean just that: an outright attack, as skillful and secret as possible, on
the so-called 'Pig property'. The 'need' to engage in such a series of
attacks, to style oneself after the guwrilla heroes of Indochina, Cuba,
and the rest of the third world, seems to grow stronger everyday.
Then, at least, one feels he is "doing something."
The only question, however, is whether or not we wish to engage in
such power politics. Either we are realistic or we are not. Realistically,
even after working many days to collect signatures lor the
McGovern-Hatfield amendment, I would say that the amendment
doesn't have a dog's chance of passing through the Senate.
McGovern's gamble on this amendment may be as risky as Nixon's
gamble. If either his or the Cooper-Church amendment fails to gain
support in the Senate, then the situation will only become more clear.
What we already suspect - that the Congress is a powerless,
do-nothing debate parlor-will become obvious for all.
Now don't misunderstand me - for obvious reasons, I am not
about to advocate publicly that we violently overthrow the
government. That would be suicide, something which the "heavies" at
Stanford, who have lately opted for more clandestine attacks, are
beginning to realize. Their big mistake this year has been, in my
analysis, being too open in their attacks, allowing themselves to be
trapped into arrests too easily.
And do not misunderstand me on one other point - strangely
perhaps, for beliefs which classify as immoral the destruction of
property when there is a high risk of destroying human life (a
watchman, a janitor, whomever), I am not about to engage in these
acts of destruction.
I choose, obviously, to live in a world of the "unreal," in a fantasy
world that does not always acknowledge the political and property
realities of power in the United States. This may or may not be a
cop-out: I will not encourage or participate in acts of destruction, but
neither will I lament them nor wish repression on those who commit
them.
To answer the professor whom I mentioned at the start of this
column, I ask only, "Do you see now why I cannot afford to be
serious?" To be serious about the reality of this country would cause
me to lose whatever humanity I have left, to become a machine of
destruction. I am neither mentally nor physically fit for such a
transfiguration, as my columns may indicate. I am close enough to
insanity as it is.
No, I will stick to my fantasy world where people laugh, cry, get
drunk, make love, go to the beach, go to Disneyland, go to the
bathroom, where they simply exist (!), for as long as the Titanic
floats. Do not fault me, if realizing the impurity of my life and
thought, I chose not to write about it every week. I will do what I do
and leave it at that.
