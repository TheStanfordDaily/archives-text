## Life In Lebanon 
### Judith Carroll 
I have now been in Lebanon about eight months on the
Stanford-American University of Beirut Exchange Program. If your
knowledge of this microcosm land is anywhere near what mine was
before I came to Lebanon, then I have much to tell you. In fact, I
really am not sure where to begin.
Lebanon is indeed a microcosm, compressing many identities into
one miraculously balanced and highly kinetic system. To begin with,
its topographical structure is one of terrific contrasts. Jagged
limestone cliffs and slopes that once served as dwellings for Stone Age
men and fantastic rock and grotto formations compete with the
shimmering turquoise and jade of the Mediterranean for a person's
attention.
Less than two hours after combing Beirut's Pigeon Rocks area for
Neanderthal flint flakes one can be sitting under an ancient cedar tree
making Givran-like portraits out of the clouds. But before I begin to
sound like a Ministry of Tourism brochure, I shall turn to some more
critical things.
Though I enjoy Beirut's crazy quilt life of souks and skyscrapers I
realize that I am part of the billowy meringue of Western impact
sitting on top of Lenanon's genuine flavor. Unfortunately that
meringue is concealing and suffocating the true Arabism in Lebanese
life, culturally and politically.
Sherwal are now only worn by old village peasants, and Midnight
Cowboy, Tlie Graduate, and The Arrangement light up theaters only
to be completely taken out of their context of American cultural
dilemmas. Sometimes I wonder why the world is such that American
blues and folk ballads constantly pour out of the radios here while
only a handful of Americans have ever heard the protracted laments
of Urn Kulthum.
If you read about the stoning of the American Embassy here in
Beirut by Palestinians and their sympathizers during Sisco's
"fact-finding" visit, you were exposed to one small reaction to the
enormous power the U.S. exerts in this area. Not only do we supply
Israel with the equipment to carry out devastating raids, as evidenced
in the deaths of 46 Egyptian children, we also encourage schisms
within the Arab ranks.
In order to maintain U.S. favor and appease Israeli ire, Lebanon
squelches commando activity and consequently contributes to
reduced vitality in the drive for justice in Palestine. Although I realize
that the situation is one of stalemate and mutual antagonism, I cannot
close my eyes to the refugee camps I've seen in Lebanon and Jordan
or my ears to the gruesome accounts given me by Palestinian
roommate and friends. Expropriation of property, tampering with
businesses, and the capricious shifting of rules concerning entry and
departure permits are no joke. Neither is it a joke to live under the
simultaneous and conflicting threats of Israeli usurpers and
commando brothers.

Though I enjoy Beirut's crazy quilt life of souks and skyscrapers I
realize that I am part of the billowy meringue of Western impact
sitting on top of Lenanon's genuine flavor. Unfortunately that
meringue is concealing and suffocating the true Arabism in Lebanese
life, culturally and politically.
Sherwal are now only worn by old village peasants, and Midnight
Cowboy, Tlie Graduate, and The Arrangement light up theaters only
to be completely taken out of their context of American cultural
dilemmas. Sometimes I wonder why the world is such that American
blues and folk ballads constantly pour out of the radios here while
only a handful of Americans have ever heard the protracted laments
of Urn Kulthum.
If you read about the stoning of the American Embassy here in
Beirut by Palestinians and their sympathizers during Sisco's
"fact-finding" visit, you were exposed to one small reaction to the
enormous power the U.S. exerts in this area. Not only do we supply
Israel with the equipment to carry out devastating raids, as evidenced
in the deaths of 46 Egyptian children, we also encourage schisms
within the Arab ranks.
In order to maintain U.S. favor and appease Israeli ire, Lebanon
squelches commando activity and consequently contributes to
reduced vitality in the drive for justice in Palestine. Although I realize
that the situation is one of stalemate and mutual antagonism, I cannot
close my eyes to the refugee camps I've seen in Lebanon and Jordan
or my ears to the gruesome accounts given me by Palestinian
roommate and friends. Expropriation of property, tampering with
businesses, and the capricious shifting of rules concerning entry and
departure permits are no joke. Neither is it a joke to live under the
simultaneous and conflicting threats of Israeli usurpers and
commando brothers.
