KZSV Editorial
Editor, The Daily:
Just as more facts about the
killings in Augusta, Georgia were
being uncovered, such as the fact
that the people who were killed
were shot in the back, we learned
of the killings at Jackson State in
Mississippi. There, Highway
Patrolmen fired shotguns into
student dormitories.
This racist atrocity is not an
isolated incident. Hundreds of
similiar atrocities have occurred in
recent years. No human being
should tolerate the continuation
of these acts. Our voices must be
raised in loud protest. Our
protests must be as energetic as
those against the war in Indochina
and as those against recent
slayings at Kent State. As of this
moment, the entire state of
Mississippi should be crawling
with special investigators from
every level of government. The
lack of vigorous prosecution
efforts can only be attributed to
what is often called the "southern
strategy
Blacks in the state of
Mississippi are calling for an
armed self-defense league. Such an
action can not be condemned
when the alternative is dying at
the hands of racist law
enforcement officials.

Editor,The Daily, And Nick
Selby:
Did it ever occur to you that
there may be others who think
and feel the same way as the FCM
members? In fact there are a few
thousand of us who want a
peaceful and sane campus again

So don't give FCM all the credit!
I'd sign my name but I'd rather
not be harassed or have any more
windows broken.

(Note: A man should have the
courage to stand up for his
convictions, with friends and in
public. Terrorizing students who
participate in a peaceful sit in by
mailing notices to their parents
implying that those students were
responsible for fire bombs is a
cowardly, insane act. Secret,
"FCM type" letters like the ones I
mentioned will never bring a
peaceful campus again. —Nick

Worker Action
Stanford Kmployees:
Would you like to participate in
discussions with other workers,
students, and faculty about
critical issues in our society
today?
Poth President Pitzer and
Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations Robert
Nelson have encouraged our
participation. In his memo of May
1 1, President Pitzer stated: "Stall
members are encouraged to
participate in varioils teach-ins,
special seminars, and similar
informational meetings held on
campus and related to campus
activities."
Let's take advantage of the
administration's apparent new
attitude of cooperation. The
Stanford Workers' Action Group
is arranging meetings within each
University department to plan a
long range program of mutual
education and action among
workers, students, and faculty. If
you are inteicsted, please watch

for announcements of these
meetings.

Bully for You
Editor, The Daily, and Jesse
Cedarbaum:
I read your column in
Thursday's Daily . You wrote eight
paragraphs on as many topics. But
what did you say?
So you finished the tenth
grade. You can read. Bully for
you. Now please learn to write.

'Retain ROTC
Editor, The I>ail y:
If the thousands of Stanford
students who are opposed to the
use of force on the campus really
mean it, they will seriously
consider voting to RETAIN
ROTC in the current referendum.
Why? Because of off ROTC at
this point would prove very
clearly to the radicals that
violence pays; that the decisions
reached early in the spring to keep
ROTC 1 with credit were reversed
because enough coercive force was
brought to bear upon the faculty
and administration. The point
would not be lost upon them that
any issue can be resolved in their
favor in the future if they break
enough windows, set enough fires,
and threaten enough people.
Students disgusted by the
destruction wrought by the
radicals thus can repudiate those
tactics by retaining ROTC in one
form or another. At the same
time, they will be denying the
radicals their objective of
dictating to the rest of the student
body exactly what organizations

other students may or may not
join.
Repudiate the Radicals —
Retain ROTC.
