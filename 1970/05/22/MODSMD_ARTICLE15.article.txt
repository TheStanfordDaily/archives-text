# McLean Out To Defeat War
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
There are some who would
argue that Stuart McLean is
working for a miracle. McLean, a
long-time activist in liberal causes,
is the Democratic candidate for
Congress in this district, running
against nino-term incumbent
Charles Gubser.
Gubser has won his last three
races with two thirds of the vote
each time. But McLean and his
campaign staff view this as a
unique political year, one in
which conservative Republicans,
even those as well entrenched as
Gubser, will have a difficult time
answering for their records at the
polls.

A campaign organization is
already busy working for McLean
on the Stanford campus. This
Saturday, Stanford students will
canvass for McLean beginning at
9:30 a.m., from the ASSU office.
On Sunday, from 5 to 7 p.m.,
there will be fund raising party for
McLean ($5 per person) at the
home of Prof. Heinz Eulau, 7.53
Frenchman's Road. Congressman
Allard Lowenstein of New York
will be the featured guest.

"This is no token campaign,"
said one member of the campaign
staff recently. "We are out to
defeat Charles Gubser and the
war."
McLean seems especially well
fitted for that task. Presently the
Director of the Center for the
Study of Contemporary Values at
Santa Clara University, he has
long been an outspoken opponent
of the war, the draft, urban decay,
and institutional racism. An
Assistant Professor of Religious
Studies, he has attacked these
problems both in and out of the
classroom.
Worked Way Through College
The 40-year-old Presbyterian
Minister holds a political science
degree from Oberlin College,
where he worked his way through
as a waiter and dishwasher; a
Christian Ethics degree from Yale
Divinity School; and a doctorate
in Ethics and Society from the
University of Chicago. From 1964
to 1968 he was a campus minister
at Stanford.
In 1967 he helped establish a
study group in East Palo Alto
which produced a book,
Institutional Racism, published by
Prentice-Hall. McLean describes
the book as "a subtle analysis of
how the white community
perpetuates racial injustice."
Before coming to California he
was involved in the Woodlawn
Organization on Chicago's South
Side, "which was a community
effort of poor blacks to determine
their own destiny and replace
apathy with dignity."
In 1967 he coordinated the
Mid-Peninsula Vietnam Summer,
and was a leader in the Palo Alto
support for the Delano
Farmworkers' Strike Committee.
From Talks to Ballots
In February of 1967 he lobbied
in Washington against the war
with Clergy and Laymen
Concerned About Vietnam. He
spent an hour discussing his views
with Charles Gubser. Now, three
years later, the war is still going
on, and McLean has chosen to
carry his views to the electorate.
In his announcement of
candidacy he attacks Gubser's
support of Vietnamization, and
called for an immediate cease-fire,
the withdrawal of all American
troops, and the broadening of the
Saigon regime.
"The corruption, repression,
and brutality of the Saigon
military junta is an offense to our
national beliefs," he said.
"Vietnamization on behalf of that
regime is hypocrisy. With a
broadened and representative
government in South Vietnam,
the reconstruction rather than the
further destruction of that
country can begin."
More recently, McLean has
strongly denounced the
Cambdian invasion, and
Representative Gubser's support
of it. He has declared his
unequivocal support of the
McGovern-Hatfield Amendment
to End the War, which would
deny funds for continuing the war
by the end of this vear.
Early Warning
Earlier this month, McLean
warned a Moratorium audience of
the costs of our Cambodian
involvement. He cited the danger
of our being backed into support
of another military dictatorship,
and of our making a negotiated

settlement more difficult than
ever before.
"And,"he added, "we can't
measure the loss of life in the
callous language of body counts.
We can't begin to say what it has
meant to the families of 43,000
soldiers who died in defense of
General Ky and General Thieu.
We can be certain that we can
afford no more."
McLean has called for a
commitment to action, to
sacrifice for peace, rather than a
continuation of rhetoric. "We
used rhetoric," he says,"and got
Cambodia."
Rhetoric Replacement
Instead of rhetoric, he has
called for a three-pronged attack
on the war, which includes
working for the passage of the
McGovern-Hatfield bill; working
for the defeat of such hawks as
Ronald Reagan, George Murphy,
and Charles Gubser; and working
to "De-militarize" the universities.
"Violence—either in the form
of violent protest or the
institutional violence that trains
military personnel and researches
systems of weaponry and
repression—has no place in an
academic community," he
believes.
McLean plans to run a
grass-roots campaign that will
"create community and dissolve
our feelings of isolation and
helplessness," a campaign that
"will deal with the future in the
language of human need."
"That future," he has said,
"must include man's control of
technology, rather than his
control by it. It must include
protection for the values of
wilderness and solitude and
natural beauty through strong
legislative sanctions against those
who would ruin our environment
for private profit or heedless
consumption."
A Need for Re-Ordering
McLean sees an urgent need to
end the war, and re-order society
along lines that will put a
premium on education, housing
and the environment, that will not
tolerate institutionalized violence
or racism.
How can such basic reforms be
undertaken? "For one," McLean
says with firm resolve, "We must
return Reagan and Murphy to
Hollywood. We must return
Gubser to Gilroy."

where he worked his way through
as a waiter and dishwasher; a
Christian Ethics degree from Yale
Divinity School; and a doctorate
in Ethics and Society from the
University of Chicago. From 1964
to 1968 he was a campus minister
at Stanford.
In 1967 he helped establish a
study group in East Palo Alto
which produced a book,
Institutional Racism, published by
Prentice-Hall. McLean describes
the book as "a subtle analysis of
how the white community
perpetuates racial injustice."
Before coming to California he
was involved in the Woodlawn
Organization on Chicago's South
Side, "which was a community
effort of poor blacks to determine
their own destiny and replace
apathy with dignity."
In 1967 he coordinated the
Mid-Peninsula Vietnam Summer,
and was a leader in the Palo Alto
support for the Delano
Farmworkers' Strike Committee.
From Talks to Ballots
In February of 1967 he lobbied
in Washington against the war
with Clergy and Laymen
Concerned About Vietnam. He
spent an hour discussing his views
with Charles Gubser. Now, three
years later, the war is still going
on, and McLean has chosen to
carry his views to the electorate.
In his announcement of
candidacy he attacks Gubser's
support of Vietnamization, and
called for an immediate cease-fire,
the withdrawal of all American
troops, and the broadening of the
Saigon regime.
"The corruption, repression,
and brutality of the Saigon
military junta is an offense to our
national beliefs," he said.
"Vietnamization on behalf of that
regime is hypocrisy. With a
broadened and representative
government in South Vietnam,
the reconstruction rather than the
further destruction of that
country can begin."
More recently, McLean has
strongly denounced the
Cambdian invasion, and
Representative Gubser's support
of it. He has declared his
unequivocal support of the
McGovern-Hatfield Amendment
to End the War, which would
deny funds for continuing the war
by the end of this vear.
Early Warning
Earlier this month, McLean
warned a Moratorium audience of
the costs of our Cambodian
involvement. He cited the danger
of our being backed into support
of another military dictatorship,
and of our making a negotiated

settlement more difficult than
ever before.
"And,"he added, "we can't
measure the loss of life in the
callous language of body counts.
We can't begin to say what it has
meant to the families of 43,000
soldiers who died in defense of
General Ky and General Thieu.
We can be certain that we can
afford no more."
McLean has called for a
commitment to action, to
sacrifice for peace, rather than a
continuation of rhetoric. "We
used rhetoric," he says,"and got
Cambodia."
Rhetoric Replacement
Instead of rhetoric, he has
called for a three-pronged attack
on the war, which includes
working for the passage of the
McGovern-Hatfield bill; working
for the defeat of such hawks as
Ronald Reagan, George Murphy,
and Charles Gubser; and working
to "De-militarize" the universities.
"Violence—either in the form
of violent protest or the
institutional violence that trains
military personnel and researches
systems of weaponry and
repression—has no place in an
academic community," he
believes.
McLean plans to run a
grass-roots campaign that will
"create community and dissolve
our feelings of isolation and
helplessness," a campaign that
"will deal with the future in the
language of human need."
"That future," he has said,
"must include man's control of
technology, rather than his
control by it. It must include
protection for the values of
wilderness and solitude and
natural beauty through strong
legislative sanctions against those
who would ruin our environment
for private profit or heedless
consumption."
A Need for Re-Ordering
McLean sees an urgent need to
end the war, and re-order society
along lines that will put a
premium on education, housing
and the environment, that will not
tolerate institutionalized violence
or racism.
How can such basic reforms be
undertaken? "For one," McLean
says with firm resolve, "We must
return Reagan and Murphy to
Hollywood. We must return
Gubser to Gilroy."


Sluarl McLean
There are some who would
argue that Stuart McLean is
working for a miracle. McLean, a
long-time activist in liberal causes,
is the Democratic candidate for
Congress in this district, running
against nino-term incumbent
Charles Gubser.
Gubser has won his last three
races with two thirds of the vote
each time. But McLean and his
campaign staff view this as a
unique political year, one in
which conservative Republicans,
even those as well entrenched as
Gubser, will have a difficult time
answering for their records at the
polls.

A campaign organization is
already busy working for McLean
on the Stanford campus. This
Saturday, Stanford students will
canvass for McLean beginning at
9:30 a.m., from the ASSU office.
On Sunday, from 5 to 7 p.m.,
there will be fund raising party for
McLean ($5 per person) at the
home of Prof. Heinz Eulau, 7.53
Frenchman's Road. Congressman
Allard Lowenstein of New York
will be the featured guest.

"This is no token campaign,"
said one member of the campaign
staff recently. "We are out to
defeat Charles Gubser and the
war."
McLean seems especially well
fitted for that task. Presently the
Director of the Center for the
Study of Contemporary Values at
Santa Clara University, he has
long been an outspoken opponent
of the war, the draft, urban decay,
and institutional racism. An
Assistant Professor of Religious
Studies, he has attacked these
problems both in and out of the
classroom.

the reconstruction rather than the
further destruction of that
country can begin."
More recently, McLean has
strongly denounced the
Cambdian invasion, and
Representative Gubser's support
of it. He has declared his
unequivocal support of the
McGovern-Hatfield Amendment
to End the War, which would
deny funds for continuing the war
by the end of this vear.
Early Warning
Earlier this month, McLean
warned a Moratorium audience of
the costs of our Cambodian
involvement. He cited the danger
of our being backed into support
of another military dictatorship,
and of our making a negotiated

settlement more difficult than
ever before.
"And,"he added, "we can't
measure the loss of life in the
callous language of body counts.
We can't begin to say what it has
meant to the families of 43,000
soldiers who died in defense of
General Ky and General Thieu.
We can be certain that we can
afford no more."
McLean has called for a
commitment to action, to
sacrifice for peace, rather than a
continuation of rhetoric. "We
used rhetoric," he says,"and got
Cambodia."
Rhetoric Replacement
Instead of rhetoric, he has
called for a three-pronged attack
on the war, which includes
working for the passage of the
McGovern-Hatfield bill; working
for the defeat of such hawks as
Ronald Reagan, George Murphy,
and Charles Gubser; and working
to "De-militarize" the universities.
"Violence—either in the form
of violent protest or the
institutional violence that trains
military personnel and researches
systems of weaponry and
repression—has no place in an
academic community," he
believes.
McLean plans to run a
grass-roots campaign that will
"create community and dissolve
our feelings of isolation and
helplessness," a campaign that
"will deal with the future in the
language of human need."
"That future," he has said,
"must include man's control of
technology, rather than his
control by it. It must include
protection for the values of
wilderness and solitude and
natural beauty through strong
legislative sanctions against those
who would ruin our environment
for private profit or heedless
consumption."
A Need for Re-Ordering
McLean sees an urgent need to
end the war, and re-order society
along lines that will put a
premium on education, housing
and the environment, that will not
tolerate institutionalized violence
or racism.
How can such basic reforms be
undertaken? "For one," McLean
says with firm resolve, "We must
return Reagan and Murphy to
Hollywood. We must return
Gubser to Gilroy."


Sluarl McLean
There are some who would
argue that Stuart McLean is
working for a miracle. McLean, a
long-time activist in liberal causes,
is the Democratic candidate for
Congress in this district, running
against nino-term incumbent
Charles Gubser.
Gubser has won his last three
races with two thirds of the vote
each time. But McLean and his
campaign staff view this as a
unique political year, one in
which conservative Republicans,
even those as well entrenched as
Gubser, will have a difficult time
answering for their records at the
polls.

A campaign organization is
already busy working for McLean
on the Stanford campus. This
Saturday, Stanford students will
canvass for McLean beginning at
9:30 a.m., from the ASSU office.
On Sunday, from 5 to 7 p.m.,
there will be fund raising party for
McLean ($5 per person) at the
home of Prof. Heinz Eulau, 7.53
Frenchman's Road. Congressman
Allard Lowenstein of New York
will be the featured guest.

"This is no token campaign,"
said one member of the campaign
staff recently. "We are out to
defeat Charles Gubser and the
war."
McLean seems especially well
fitted for that task. Presently the
Director of the Center for the
Study of Contemporary Values at
Santa Clara University, he has
long been an outspoken opponent
of the war, the draft, urban decay,
and institutional racism. An
Assistant Professor of Religious
Studies, he has attacked these
problems both in and out of the
classroom.
Worked Way Through College
The 40-year-old Presbyterian
Minister holds a political science
degree from Oberlin College,
where he worked his way through
as a waiter and dishwasher; a
Christian Ethics degree from Yale
Divinity School; and a doctorate
in Ethics and Society from the
University of Chicago. From 1964
to 1968 he was a campus minister
at Stanford.
In 1967 he helped establish a
study group in East Palo Alto
which produced a book,
Institutional Racism, published by
Prentice-Hall. McLean describes
the book as "a subtle analysis of
how the white community
perpetuates racial injustice."
Before coming to California he
was involved in the Woodlawn
Organization on Chicago's South
Side, "which was a community
effort of poor blacks to determine
their own destiny and replace
apathy with dignity."
In 1967 he coordinated the
Mid-Peninsula Vietnam Summer,
and was a leader in the Palo Alto
support for the Delano
Farmworkers' Strike Committee.
From Talks to Ballots
In February of 1967 he lobbied
in Washington against the war
with Clergy and Laymen
Concerned About Vietnam. He
spent an hour discussing his views
with Charles Gubser. Now, three
years later, the war is still going
on, and McLean has chosen to
carry his views to the electorate.
In his announcement of
candidacy he attacks Gubser's
support of Vietnamization, and
called for an immediate cease-fire,
the withdrawal of all American
troops, and the broadening of the
Saigon regime.
"The corruption, repression,
and brutality of the Saigon
military junta is an offense to our
national beliefs," he said.
"Vietnamization on behalf of that
regime is hypocrisy. With a
broadened and representative
government in South Vietnam,
the reconstruction rather than the
further destruction of that
country can begin."
More recently, McLean has
strongly denounced the
Cambdian invasion, and
Representative Gubser's support
of it. He has declared his
