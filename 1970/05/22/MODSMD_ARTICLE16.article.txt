# Grass Roots Movement Develops Muscle
## 
### 
We are trying to make students
a nationwide political force," says
Bill Pascoe, Harvard law student
now at Stanford to assist the
Stanford chapter in organizing
California schools behind the
Movement for a New Congress.
Stanford will host delegates
tomorrow from the 120 northern
California colleges who are
participating in the drive to
establish a national data bank of
students willing to work this
summer at the grass roots level to
elect a Congress that will end
American involvement in
Southeast Asia and establish peace
at home.

Three hundred Stanford
students registered with the
Movement for a New Congress on
the first day of sign ups. "The
muscle MNC here is astounding.
In one day we received over 4000
volunteers at Brandeis alone,"
commented Pascoe. "Some
Eastern schools have signed up
1/3 of their student body."
"It is easy to organize people
who know what has to be done. I
feel strongly that this is the last
clear chance to involve students in
working through the channels,"
he continued.
Computerized Politics
Volunteers note on their form
the date they will be available,
where they will be during the
summer, and their work
experience and preferences. The
information is transfered to
computer cards and sent to MNC
headquarters at Princeton where it
is stored in a data bank.
Next month each region will be
supplied with a print out of the
volunteers available in each area
along with the particulars on
experience, amount of time
available and whether they have a
car. This information in turn is
made available to the campaign
offices of candidates which have
been endorsed by the regional
body as supporting an end to the
war.
Volunteers will also take part in
large scale drives to register those
people who currently do not vote.
The Movement for a New
Congress will train students in
canvassing techniques and other
political skills necessary for
effective political action.
The Stanford headquarters for
the Movement for a New Congress
are in the Institute for Political
Studies, 549 Salvatierra.
