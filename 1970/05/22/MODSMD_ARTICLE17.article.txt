### 
As June 2 draws near peace candidates are in need of a growing
number of student canvassers, etc. Those interested in lending their
support in peace campaigns should consult the following list of the
weekend's campaign activities:
PETE McCLOSKY needs people to canvass this Saturday. Those
who wish to help should meet at McClosky headquarters, 650 El
Camino in Redwood City, 9:30 a.m.
Any students wishing to canvass for either BROWN, UNRUH, STU
McLEAN, or JOHN RUTHERFORD this weekend should meet at the
ASSU office Saturday or Sunday at 9:30 a.m. Transportation will be
provided to the areas to be canvassed.
Also, students willing to canvass Los Altos for GEORGE BROW N
at their own convenience sometime during the next ten days should
report to Rutherford headquarters at 164 Main St., Palo Alto this
Saturday. At that time you will be given a precinct list of some thirty
homes which you must contact for Brown sometime before June 1.
Students interested in the campaign of STU McLEAN are invited to
a no-host cocktail party this Sunday from 5 to 7 at 753 Frenchmans
Road, Stanford. Along with McLean will be Congressman A 1
Lowenstein (D-N.Y.). Donations to the campaign of McLean will be
$5.
JOHN TIJNNEY's campaign needs student help in leafletting
shopping centers in San Mateo County this Saturday.
