# Student Police Depolarization
## Prejudices Broken 
### 
During the past six weeks the Student-Police
Depolarization Group has been experimenting
with methods of closing the widening gap between
Stanford students and local police officers.
The Student-Police Depolarization Group was
formed for the purpose of seeking different ways
of bringing about attitude change on the part of
students and police both towards the issues and
towards each other. There are presently about
sixty members within this organization and they
have the enthusiastic cooperation of the police
departments in Palo Alto, Los Altos, Menlo Park,
Mountain View, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San
Jose.
So far, the format of the group has involved
meeting police officers on a personal level either at
their jobs or on the Stanford campus. For the past
few months members of the group have been
bringing police officers to their dorms for meals so
that they may meet with students and get an idea
of their feelings.
Shift Companions
Also individual students may sign up to ride in
squad cars with the police officer for 4 or 8 hour
shifts. Past results have shown that this greatly
helps the student to gain an insight into the
policeman's job and way of thinking and it
provides a great amount of time for discussion
with him.

The Student-Police Depolarization Group has
been formed because the recent events have shown
a need for it, but its purpose is to go on as a
long-term method of communication so that
future crisis can be alleviated or to some extent
prevented. By confronting policemen on a
personal level perhaps attitude change can be
brought about on the part of both police and
students and prevent false images from forming in
the minds of both sides.
Future meetings of the Student-Police
Depolarization Group will be announced on the
back page of the Daily with the meeting time and
place.
