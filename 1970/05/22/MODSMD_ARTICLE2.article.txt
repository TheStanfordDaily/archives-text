# Grading Plan Finished By Academic Senate
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
After two months of
consideration, the faculty Senate
yesterday finished action on the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) report on grading
changes and approved next fall as
the date for implementation of
the changes.
It approved yesterday a
program requiring each
department to make available
before pre-registration a detailed
course description for each regular
course given under its
sponsorship. This is a
formalization of the course
evaluation program instituted by
the ASSU this year.
The descriptions, which are to
be filed in the library and other
olaces, are to include such
.nformation as the reading list, the
number of projected class
meetings, projects, papers,
examinations, and prerequisites.
At the same time, the election
results of the faculty Senate for
next year have been announced.
t No F's
Last week the Senate approved
a grading system for
undergraduates which eliminates
the "D" and "F" grades and plus
and minus marks on reported
grades. Starting next fall, the only
penalty for failing to complete a
•ourse in a satisfactory manner
will be loss of credit toward
graduation. No record of the
course ever having been taken will
appear on the transcript.
The faculty Senate referred
back to the CUS a proposal for
determining the eligibility of
tudents for continuing study at
Stanford and the term "academic
probation." The committee had
recommended that this be based
on the number of units completed
toward graduation each year.
Senate permission was also
granted to the Registrar's
vdvisory Committee "to entertain
petitions for graduation from
students who, due to
circumstances strictly beyond
their control during the present
quarter, may have been unable to
complete the full 180 units
required for graduation." The
ecommendation applies only to
this quarter and does not imply
acceptance of the petition.
In a similar action, the group

approved extension of normal
procedures in certifying
candidates for graduation with
incompletes. The Registrar's
Advisory Committee will be able
to certify "as having completed
the quarter's work all those
candidates for graduation who
meet the requirements of
graduation by making up
incompletes by July 1, 1970 or
earlier."
Princeton Plan
In other actions the Committee
on Committees announced the
appointment of an "ad hoc
Committee on Student
Involvement in Political
Processes" that will consider the
"Princeton Plan"—which allows
for a two-week recess before the
November elections. Last week
the Senate approved the
"concept" of the recess and
encouraged the committee to
work out details and to see what
other political activities could be
encouraged. The group did not
bind itself to approving the recess,
however, because of possible
difficulties in implementation.
A proposal to expand the
membership of the Academic
Council to include full time
teachers and other faculty
members not now included in the
body was referred to the
Academic Secretary to get more
detailed information on the
number of new members who
would be on the Council.
Faculty Discipline Postponed
Debate on an ad hoc faculty
committee to consider disciplining
faculty members was postponed
when the Senate referred to the
Committee on Committees the
proposal.

Earlier this week, the Academic
Secretary had announced the
results of the election of next
years Senate. The Senate is
composed of 52 representatives
elected for two year terms and 12
nonvoting ex-officio members.
The members of the Academic
Council selected 27 professors to
serve the term beginning next fall.
Tuesday, the Senate of next
year will meet to elect a chairman
for next year. Sidney Raffel,
chairman and professor of medical
microbiology in the School of
Medicine, and Halsey L. Royden,
professor of mathematics, have
been nominated for the position.
Of the 27 elected members of
the Senate, 12 are first-term
elected representatives, 10 are
incumbents and five served in the
First Senate.
