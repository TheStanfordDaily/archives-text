# Films In Preview
## Chaplin And Fonda Frolic On Film 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
In addition to some good films
this weekend, "Easy Rider" will
be shown at the Sunday Flicks as
part of a series of movies by those
men who have been attempting to
capture Truth, Justice, and the
American Way on film.
Tonight the Silent Film Series
will feature Mack Sennett's
"Tillie's Punctured Romance" and
Robert Flaherty's "Tabu" at 7, 8
and 9 in Tresidder.
Silent Flicks
"Tillie's Punctured Romance",
(1914), is the first feature-length
film by Mack Sennett,
Hollywood's greatest slapstick and
silent comedy producer and the
man responsible for the films of
the Keystone Cops, Fatty
Arbudkle, Buster Keaton, and
Charlie Chaplin.
In tonight's film Chaplin
portrays a city slicker con-man,
with Marie Dressier (a minor
comedienne in silent films who
became one of the greatest stars
of the early talkies) as his victim,
and Mabel Nomand (the only
other Sennett pupil besides
Chaplin who became a creative
artist in her own right) as his
former sweetheart and partner in
crime.
Showing with the Sennett
classic is "Tabu" (1928-1930), a
collaboration between F.W.
Murnau and Robert Flaherty, the
man considered by film historians
to be not merely the father of the
documentary, but also one of its
few justifications.

"Nanook" and the Samoans in
"Moana" - the people who
escaped the corruption of society.
Unfortunately, his approach to
filmmaking was quite different
from Murnau's and before "Tabu"
was completed, Flaherty quit,
sold his interest in the production
to Murnau and left the South
Seas.
The result is a corrupted film
the depicts "the tragedy of lovers
who break tribal taboos against
forbidden love." Despite
sequences of cavorting natives and
a creaking plot, Flaherty's talent
shines through in some exciting
and sophisticated scenes.
Also on Friday evening, the
Stanford Community Against War
and Fascism will show
"Rocketship" and "People's War"
at 8 in Cubberley.
Revolutionary Film
Saturday, one of the most
acclaimed films by a young
director since Welles' "Citizen
Kane", "Before the Revolution"
by twenty-two year old Bernardo
Bertolucci will be shown at 7, 8,
and 9 in Tresidder. Set in the
1960'5, Bertolucci's film deals
with the experience of so many
young poets, novelists and
filmmakers - rebellion against
bourgeois life, an egocentric
dedication to Communism,
disillusion.
It is the story of a boy who
discovers that he is not
singleminded enough to be a
revolutionary, that he is too
deeply involved in the beauty of
life as it is before the revolution.
Critic Pauline Kael wrote":
"The greatest achievement is that
you come out of the theater, not
dull and depressed the way you
feel after movies that insult your
intelligence, but elated-restored to
the youthful ardor when all hopes
are raised at once."
I recommend this film to all
would-be revolutionaries and
those people who are tired of
having their intelligence insulted.
Also on Saturday, "Mr. Hulot's
Holiday", winner of the Grand
Prize at Cannes in 1953, will be
shown at 7, 9, and 11 in
Cubberley. Written and directed
by and starring Jacques Tati, the
film is a comic masterpiece that
chronicles the human foibles and
frustrations of a summer vacation
at the beach. It is not until the
end of "Mr. Hulot's Holiday" that
the misadventures take on a
certain depth and poignancy.
Sunday Flicks
The most overrated film of the
century, "Easy Rider", will be
shown at the Sunday Flicks at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
This American "classic" is
contrived, pretentious and seems
to have been written for comic
book mentality.
Peter, the "Wild Angel", Fonda
never outgrew the image he

created of super groovy bike boy
in those trashy American
International pictures. So he got
together with Dennis Hopper,
gathered $350,000 played
writer-producer and made The
Independent Film that was
supposed to relate to the other
America with its scenes of Billy
and Captain America riding
motorcycles to the tunes of
Hendrix, Steppenwolf and the
Byrds.
I wouldn't be so critical of
"Easy Rider" if it weren't so
dishonest. The hippie commune
was a little much with those
beautiful children throwing seeds
on the rocky desert and expecting
to "make it". The character
Fonda created of Captain America
who throws away his watch in a
symbolic gesture is typical of the
simplistic symbolism littering the
film. Include in that category the
religious allegory in the simulated
acid trip with Mary the whore.
The only saving grace was Jack
Nicolson who did an outstanding
job as the small-time lawyer and
alcholic George Hanson who joins
the dynamic duo on their musical
moroting odyssey. He was the
only real character with any depth
and personality. You said it Mr.
Fonda: "Man, we blew it."

The "film phenomenon" will
be the subject of "The New
Communicators", a two-part NBC
special on the new generation of
filmmakers to be shown Saturday,
May 23 at 7 :30 on channels 4, 3,
and 8. Hosting the program will
be none other than that old
trend-setter himself, Peter Fonda.


Two of Flaherty's films,
"Nanook of the North" (1922)
and "Moana" (1926), are
considered by many critics to be
the best documentaries ever
produced. Actually his films are
so incredibly realistic that they
hardly seem like documentaries.
Flaherty didn't attempt to'
make any social or political
statements as is the case with
many documentaries made today,
but rather he wanted to record
with his camera what he
considered the essential story of
the lives of the Eskimos in


LASY TRAVELING— Peter Fonda and
Dennis Hopper demonstrate how easy it
