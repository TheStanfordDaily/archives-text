## Watts Triumphs In Concerto 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Wednesday evening's San
Francisco Symphony program
demonstrated beautifully how
music should and should not be
written. The occasion was the
next-to-last concert of the season
featuring Beethoven's "Piano
Concerto No. 4" and the world
premiere of Symphony No. 2 of
local Andrew Imbrie. The
program was well-played, but the
new work was an abortive attempt
to include all that is useless in
modern music in one
thirty-minute session.
Imbrie's piece comes in four
movements, entitled "Tygers of
Wrath," "Mr. Squirrel,"
"Moonscapes," and "Spring."
They are an inept paste-up of
percussive and dis-harmonious
noises stuck together with a
miniscule quantity of talent. The
movements progress from
ponderous confusion through
stumbling confusion and
swooping confusion to a finale of
frightening confusion. Lacking all
sense of thematic development
and nothing to indicate emotional
involvement, Imbrie's Second
Symphony will richly deserve its
future obscurity.
Masterful Concerto
What a contrast to the first
offering was the piece that
followed - a sensational
performance of Beethoven's
magnificent Fourth Piano
Concerto, with Andre Watts the
soloist. Probablv Beethoven's

finest composition for piano, the
concerto was played with finesse
and grace and power by Mr.
Watts. The orchestra was directed
surely and precisely by Maestro
Krips, contrasting romantic
moods with the power of classical
Vienna to bring out all the
subtleties of the concerto.
The quality was maintained
throughout the piece, with the
first movement consistently in the
romantic vein until the
Recapitulation. Then, following
Maestro Krips' strong downbeat,
the orchestra and soloist sang with
strick and rigid voices, elucidating
another side of the masterpiece.
Mr. Watts' cadenza explored both
aspects with the skill that has
proclaimed him a mature artist at
22.
Movement Extolled
The Andante second movement
is perhaps the zenith of the
concertante form in all music
literature. The orchestra argues
with the piano, asserting itself
through strength. The piano
replies calmly, the voice of
non-violence. Unswayed, the
orchestra responds with hate, but
the piano speaks again with
modesty. The dialogue continues,
and soon the orchestra is as
peaceful as the piano, and they
immediately join in the springhtly
Rondo finale.
The quality of the performance
of the second movement was
amazing. Technically and
emotionally, it was exquisite. Mr.
Watt's piano was opium or
stronger, a confident match for

the ferocity of the ensemble.
Maestro Krips, too, shares credit
for the delicate balancing of the
two forces.
The final section of the
concerto gave Mr. Watts a vehicle
to display his technical artistry as
the first two had so completely
shown his creative genius. He was
half flurry, half dynamo in the
movement, concluding with a
cadenza that condensed all the
power of the entire work into
those few brief bars. Andre Watts
is a master.

Next week, the Stanford
Chorus joins the Symphony for
the final concerts of the season,
and Maestro Krips' last
appearances on the podium as
Conductor. Performances will be
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday
evenings at 8:30 P.M. and
Thursday afternoon at 2:00 P.M.
The program for this concluding
concert of the Beethoven
Bicentenniel Year will be
Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 and
Symphony No. 9. A few tickets
may still be available.
Another era comes to an end
next week as Jacob Krachmalnik
makes his final appearances as
concertmaster of the Symphony.
Acclaimed as both a solo and
ensemble violinist, Mr.
Krachmalnik may be moving to
Hollywood to play with the
studio orchestras. Occasionally
recurring rumors that he has
developed a modicum of humility
are unfounded.
