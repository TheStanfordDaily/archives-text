# Hornsby's Highlights
## Requiem For The Beatles 
### THE HORNSBY TWINS 
Our editor informs us that
there were two complaints when
our column did not appear last
week, and that is ihe kind of
readership that spurs us to write
this pretentious column in the
first place. Besides, we have heard
a stack of good albums lately, so
we can get off our obscurity kick.
The release of the Beatle's Let
It Be triples our sadness about the
breakup of that group. In our May
Bth review of Paul McCartney's
interview with himself, we lauded
both the material and the
performance on his solo album.
While we appreciate what he's
done precisely because it is the
work of just one man; there is just
no comparison with a Rh AI,
Beatles album. All the Beatles
have exceptional talent, and their
voices blend and instruments
work together as though by
telepathy.
They Had the Touch
The different writing styles of
Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison
help to make their albums more
listenable by giving the listener
sparkling wit, snappy
arrangements, great chord
changes, and lots of variety.
Beatles albums have always been
characterized by never having
songs we deleted when taping the
record mooched from our friends.
This album is so good we may
have to buy it ourselves. A true
keeper-of-the-faith will even like
the movie (it Look me half of the
75 minute movie just to check out
the equipment they used).
It is silly to give another
catalogue of the Beatles' talents;
let us just note the incredible
versatility of McCartney's voice,
the unique and inventive guitar of
both Harrison and Lennon, and
the tasteful understatement of
Ringo's drumming. The best songs
include "Two of Us," "I Dig a
Pony," "Nothing's Gonna
Change," "One after 909" and

Harrison's "I, Me, Mine." It's
tragic that their egos can't take
each other anymore, because this
is the best album released since
Christmas of 1968.
A New Starr
Until its recent bum trip,
KOIT-FM was devoting its airtime
exclusively to Beatle
compositions, and I was amazed
one day to hear several cuts
seemingly aimed at the geriatric
audience. "What," I asked myself,
"the hell is this?" Somewhere
between the xylophones and the
muted-trombone section, I faintly
recognized a familiar voice. Frank
Sinatra? Dean Martin? Hoagy
Carmichael? George Burns and
Gracie Allen?? No . . . slowly, it
dawned on me... that
voice. . . an uncanny imitation of
Ringo Starr!!!
Now that I've got the album, I
find that it's Ringo himself. It's
incredible; Candy and The Magic
Christian made me wince, but this
leaves me speechless. Computer
projections of the trend indicate
that Ringo will next be seen as a
ventriloquist dummy on the Ed
Flubbermann show.
It's not that Ringo's voice is so

terrible; in most places he is
heavily double-tracked, cunningly
overdubbed and otherwise
dehumanized, and he does
demonstrate once and for all that
he can sing on key. The material
and the arrangements are beyond
belief.
A George Martin arranged
version of "Dream" (even our
dedicated trivia expert was
stumped as to who last performed
this number) caught Ringo's voice
at its breathiest. "Star Dust,"
arranged by McCartney is pretty
good although it's not Ringo's
best vocal. The bassist in the
Plastic Ono band, Klaus Voorman,
arranged a reasonable rendition of
"I'm a Fool to Care."
Bottom Two
The two worst cuts come
back-to-back (or belly-to-belly
depending on your point of view);
"You Always Hurt the One You
Love" has all sorts of highly
offensive brass and the distinct
sound of a "Rhythm Ace" in the
first 12 bars. "Have I Told You
Lately That I Love You," left me
scratching the wills; the rhythm
(a series of ummphhs) is horrible,
the dynamics incredibly

contrived, and the violin resounds
as though played by Jack Benny's
butler (Rochester). "Bye Bye
Blackbird" falls far short of the
version on Joe Cocker's first
album.
This SENTIMENTAL
JOURNEY by Ringo is most
reminiscent of a turgid ten-day
"Big Band" festival featuring
Buddy Rich on the kazoo,
"Around the World in 80 Days," a
strip show, and a can of Lawrence
Welk cake icing. It ranks with the
Lee Marvin release of "I was born
under a Wanderin' Star" ("I've
never seen a place that didn't look
better lookin' back") as the most
amazing release of the year. Is this
the kind of vanguard art that the
Beatles meant to nurture when
they formed Apple Records?? Oh
well, at least we've solved the
problem of what to give for
Father's Day.
Speaking of super heavy
albums, there is a new Who album
out, LIVE AT LEED'S. Once
again, the Who prove that they
can put you to sleep and wake
you up with the best of them. A
slightly long and beatless version
of "My Generation" breaks into
the fantastic strains of "See
Me/Feel Me/Touch Me ..." Every
time I hear that transition, it
raises the scruff on the back of
my neck.
Both the excitement of a live
performance and the recording
quality of a studio (weird reverb
on Roger Daltry's voice) come
over in this release. Daltry tried
time and again to prove that he
can sing higher than Robert Plant
of Led Zeppelin. The most
effective songs on the album are
"Summertime Blues" (you can see
this performed in "Woodstock")
and "Shakin' All Over." Peter
Townsend, who has some of the
best body moves around, comes
over very well; in places he sounds
like an army of guitar players
while in several spots his ax sings
like an acoustic. I do wish,
however, that they had done more
from "Tommy."

It looks like Bill Graham has
heard about the recession in the
nation's economy; he is staging
shows guaranteed to get some of
that good old consumer spending
going. May 30th, he'll have the
Jimi Hendrix Experience at
Berkeley Community Theater
with Mitch Mitchell back on the
skins and Billy Cox manning the
bass. May 28-31, Mike Bloomfield
and Friends will appear with Blues
Image ("Ride, Captain, Ride" on
AM) and Silver Metre
("Superstar" on your AM). This
weekend he has James Taylor
(first artist signed by Apple, now
with Warner Brothers) and
Pen tangle at Berkeley
Community. That promises to be
sort of a quiet tasteful evening.
Over at the Fillmore West, he
has the king of the blues, Mr. 8.8.
King, and the head pretender to
the throne, Albert King. Many is
the night, I have called plaintively
for this dynamic duo to appear in
a poker hand. At the Family Dog
(where the acts have been slacking
off lately), you'll find Shortie and
The Fourth Way. Big Brother will
be holding at the Keystone
Korner, while Delanie and Bonnie
and all kin'a other people head a
bill including Love appear at the
Monterey Fairgrounds. Call an FM
rock station to find out where and
when. Next week sometime,
Country Weather, Guess Who, and
Buddy Miles will appear at the
Santa Clara Fairgrounds.
By the way, the flipside of "Let
It Be" is called "You Know My
Name (Now Look Up the
Number)" and is absolutely
outasight.

work together as though by
telepathy.
They Had the Touch
The different writing styles of
Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison
help to make their albums more
listenable by giving the listener
sparkling wit, snappy
arrangements, great chord
changes, and lots of variety.
Beatles albums have always been
characterized by never having
songs we deleted when taping the
record mooched from our friends.
This album is so good we may
have to buy it ourselves. A true
keeper-of-the-faith will even like
the movie (it Look me half of the
75 minute movie just to check out
the equipment they used).
It is silly to give another
catalogue of the Beatles' talents;
let us just note the incredible
versatility of McCartney's voice,
the unique and inventive guitar of
both Harrison and Lennon, and
the tasteful understatement of
Ringo's drumming. The best songs
include "Two of Us," "I Dig a
Pony," "Nothing's Gonna
Change," "One after 909" and

Harrison's "I, Me, Mine." It's
tragic that their egos can't take
each other anymore, because this
is the best album released since
Christmas of 1968.
A New Starr
Until its recent bum trip,
KOIT-FM was devoting its airtime
exclusively to Beatle
compositions, and I was amazed
one day to hear several cuts
seemingly aimed at the geriatric
audience. "What," I asked myself,
"the hell is this?" Somewhere
between the xylophones and the
muted-trombone section, I faintly
recognized a familiar voice. Frank
Sinatra? Dean Martin? Hoagy
Carmichael? George Burns and
Gracie Allen?? No . . . slowly, it
dawned on me... that
voice. . . an uncanny imitation of
Ringo Starr!!!
Now that I've got the album, I
find that it's Ringo himself. It's
incredible; Candy and The Magic
Christian made me wince, but this
leaves me speechless. Computer
projections of the trend indicate
that Ringo will next be seen as a
ventriloquist dummy on the Ed
Flubbermann show.
It's not that Ringo's voice is so

terrible; in most places he is
heavily double-tracked, cunningly
overdubbed and otherwise
dehumanized, and he does
demonstrate once and for all that
he can sing on key. The material
and the arrangements are beyond
belief.
A George Martin arranged
version of "Dream" (even our
dedicated trivia expert was
stumped as to who last performed
this number) caught Ringo's voice
at its breathiest. "Star Dust,"
arranged by McCartney is pretty
good although it's not Ringo's
best vocal. The bassist in the
Plastic Ono band, Klaus Voorman,
arranged a reasonable rendition of
"I'm a Fool to Care."
Bottom Two
The two worst cuts come
back-to-back (or belly-to-belly
depending on your point of view);
"You Always Hurt the One You
Love" has all sorts of highly
offensive brass and the distinct
sound of a "Rhythm Ace" in the
first 12 bars. "Have I Told You
Lately That I Love You," left me
scratching the wills; the rhythm
(a series of ummphhs) is horrible,
the dynamics incredibly

contrived, and the violin resounds
as though played by Jack Benny's
butler (Rochester). "Bye Bye
Blackbird" falls far short of the
version on Joe Cocker's first
album.
This SENTIMENTAL
JOURNEY by Ringo is most
reminiscent of a turgid ten-day
"Big Band" festival featuring
Buddy Rich on the kazoo,
"Around the World in 80 Days," a
strip show, and a can of Lawrence
Welk cake icing. It ranks with the
Lee Marvin release of "I was born
under a Wanderin' Star" ("I've
never seen a place that didn't look
better lookin' back") as the most
amazing release of the year. Is this
the kind of vanguard art that the
Beatles meant to nurture when
they formed Apple Records?? Oh
well, at least we've solved the
problem of what to give for
Father's Day.
Speaking of super heavy
albums, there is a new Who album
out, LIVE AT LEED'S. Once
again, the Who prove that they
can put you to sleep and wake
you up with the best of them. A
slightly long and beatless version
of "My Generation" breaks into
the fantastic strains of "See
Me/Feel Me/Touch Me ..." Every
time I hear that transition, it
raises the scruff on the back of
my neck.
Both the excitement of a live
performance and the recording
quality of a studio (weird reverb
on Roger Daltry's voice) come
over in this release. Daltry tried
time and again to prove that he
can sing higher than Robert Plant
of Led Zeppelin. The most
effective songs on the album are
"Summertime Blues" (you can see
this performed in "Woodstock")
and "Shakin' All Over." Peter
Townsend, who has some of the
best body moves around, comes
over very well; in places he sounds
like an army of guitar players
while in several spots his ax sings
like an acoustic. I do wish,
however, that they had done more
from "Tommy."

It looks like Bill Graham has
heard about the recession in the
nation's economy; he is staging
shows guaranteed to get some of
that good old consumer spending
going. May 30th, he'll have the
Jimi Hendrix Experience at
Berkeley Community Theater
with Mitch Mitchell back on the
skins and Billy Cox manning the
bass. May 28-31, Mike Bloomfield
and Friends will appear with Blues
Image ("Ride, Captain, Ride" on
AM) and Silver Metre
("Superstar" on your AM). This
weekend he has James Taylor
(first artist signed by Apple, now
with Warner Brothers) and
Pen tangle at Berkeley
Community. That promises to be
sort of a quiet tasteful evening.
Over at the Fillmore West, he
has the king of the blues, Mr. 8.8.
King, and the head pretender to
the throne, Albert King. Many is
the night, I have called plaintively
for this dynamic duo to appear in
a poker hand. At the Family Dog
(where the acts have been slacking
off lately), you'll find Shortie and
The Fourth Way. Big Brother will
be holding at the Keystone
Korner, while Delanie and Bonnie
and all kin'a other people head a
bill including Love appear at the
Monterey Fairgrounds. Call an FM
rock station to find out where and
when. Next week sometime,
Country Weather, Guess Who, and
Buddy Miles will appear at the
Santa Clara Fairgrounds.
By the way, the flipside of "Let
It Be" is called "You Know My
Name (Now Look Up the
Number)" and is absolutely
outasight.

Our editor informs us that
there were two complaints when
our column did not appear last
week, and that is ihe kind of
readership that spurs us to write
this pretentious column in the
first place. Besides, we have heard
a stack of good albums lately, so
we can get off our obscurity kick.
The release of the Beatle's Let
It Be triples our sadness about the
breakup of that group. In our May
Bth review of Paul McCartney's
interview with himself, we lauded
both the material and the
performance on his solo album.
While we appreciate what he's
done precisely because it is the
work of just one man; there is just
no comparison with a Rh AI,
Beatles album. All the Beatles
have exceptional talent, and their
voices blend and instruments
work together as though by

the tasteful understatement of
Ringo's drumming. The best songs
include "Two of Us," "I Dig a
Pony," "Nothing's Gonna
Change," "One after 909" and

Harrison's "I, Me, Mine." It's
tragic that their egos can't take
each other anymore, because this
is the best album released since
Christmas of 1968.
A New Starr
Until its recent bum trip,
KOIT-FM was devoting its airtime
exclusively to Beatle
compositions, and I was amazed
one day to hear several cuts
seemingly aimed at the geriatric
audience. "What," I asked myself,
"the hell is this?" Somewhere
between the xylophones and the
muted-trombone section, I faintly
recognized a familiar voice. Frank
Sinatra? Dean Martin? Hoagy
Carmichael? George Burns and
Gracie Allen?? No . . . slowly, it
dawned on me... that
voice. . . an uncanny imitation of
Ringo Starr!!!
Now that I've got the album, I
find that it's Ringo himself. It's
incredible; Candy and The Magic
Christian made me wince, but this
leaves me speechless. Computer
projections of the trend indicate
that Ringo will next be seen as a
ventriloquist dummy on the Ed
Flubbermann show.
It's not that Ringo's voice is so

terrible; in most places he is
heavily double-tracked, cunningly
overdubbed and otherwise
dehumanized, and he does
demonstrate once and for all that
he can sing on key. The material
and the arrangements are beyond
belief.
A George Martin arranged
version of "Dream" (even our
dedicated trivia expert was
stumped as to who last performed
this number) caught Ringo's voice
at its breathiest. "Star Dust,"
arranged by McCartney is pretty
good although it's not Ringo's
best vocal. The bassist in the
Plastic Ono band, Klaus Voorman,
arranged a reasonable rendition of
"I'm a Fool to Care."
Bottom Two
The two worst cuts come
back-to-back (or belly-to-belly
depending on your point of view);
"You Always Hurt the One You
Love" has all sorts of highly
offensive brass and the distinct
sound of a "Rhythm Ace" in the
first 12 bars. "Have I Told You
Lately That I Love You," left me
scratching the wills; the rhythm
(a series of ummphhs) is horrible,
the dynamics incredibly

contrived, and the violin resounds
as though played by Jack Benny's
butler (Rochester). "Bye Bye
Blackbird" falls far short of the
version on Joe Cocker's first
album.
This SENTIMENTAL
JOURNEY by Ringo is most
reminiscent of a turgid ten-day
"Big Band" festival featuring
Buddy Rich on the kazoo,
"Around the World in 80 Days," a
strip show, and a can of Lawrence
Welk cake icing. It ranks with the
Lee Marvin release of "I was born
under a Wanderin' Star" ("I've
never seen a place that didn't look
better lookin' back") as the most
amazing release of the year. Is this
the kind of vanguard art that the
Beatles meant to nurture when
they formed Apple Records?? Oh
well, at least we've solved the
problem of what to give for
Father's Day.
Speaking of super heavy
albums, there is a new Who album
out, LIVE AT LEED'S. Once
again, the Who prove that they
can put you to sleep and wake
you up with the best of them. A
slightly long and beatless version
of "My Generation" breaks into
the fantastic strains of "See
Me/Feel Me/Touch Me ..." Every
time I hear that transition, it
raises the scruff on the back of
my neck.
Both the excitement of a live
performance and the recording
quality of a studio (weird reverb
on Roger Daltry's voice) come
over in this release. Daltry tried
time and again to prove that he
can sing higher than Robert Plant
of Led Zeppelin. The most
effective songs on the album are
"Summertime Blues" (you can see
this performed in "Woodstock")
and "Shakin' All Over." Peter
Townsend, who has some of the
best body moves around, comes
over very well; in places he sounds
like an army of guitar players
while in several spots his ax sings
like an acoustic. I do wish,
however, that they had done more
from "Tommy."

It looks like Bill Graham has
heard about the recession in the
nation's economy; he is staging
shows guaranteed to get some of
that good old consumer spending
going. May 30th, he'll have the
Jimi Hendrix Experience at
Berkeley Community Theater
with Mitch Mitchell back on the
skins and Billy Cox manning the
bass. May 28-31, Mike Bloomfield
and Friends will appear with Blues
Image ("Ride, Captain, Ride" on
AM) and Silver Metre
("Superstar" on your AM). This
weekend he has James Taylor
(first artist signed by Apple, now
with Warner Brothers) and
Pen tangle at Berkeley
Community. That promises to be
sort of a quiet tasteful evening.
Over at the Fillmore West, he
has the king of the blues, Mr. 8.8.
King, and the head pretender to
the throne, Albert King. Many is
the night, I have called plaintively
for this dynamic duo to appear in
a poker hand. At the Family Dog
(where the acts have been slacking
off lately), you'll find Shortie and
The Fourth Way. Big Brother will
be holding at the Keystone
Korner, while Delanie and Bonnie
and all kin'a other people head a
bill including Love appear at the
Monterey Fairgrounds. Call an FM
rock station to find out where and
when. Next week sometime,
Country Weather, Guess Who, and
Buddy Miles will appear at the
Santa Clara Fairgrounds.
By the way, the flipside of "Let
It Be" is called "You Know My
Name (Now Look Up the
Number)" and is absolutely
outasight.

Our editor informs us that
there were two complaints when
our column did not appear last
week, and that is ihe kind of
readership that spurs us to write
this pretentious column in the
first place. Besides, we have heard
a stack of good albums lately, so
we can get off our obscurity kick.
The release of the Beatle's Let
It Be triples our sadness about the
breakup of that group. In our May
Bth review of Paul McCartney's
interview with himself, we lauded
both the material and the
performance on his solo album.
While we appreciate what he's
done precisely because it is the
work of just one man; there is just
no comparison with a Rh AI,
Beatles album. All the Beatles
have exceptional talent, and their
voices blend and instruments
work together as though by
telepathy.
They Had the Touch
The different writing styles of
Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison
help to make their albums more
listenable by giving the listener
sparkling wit, snappy
arrangements, great chord
changes, and lots of variety.
Beatles albums have always been
characterized by never having
songs we deleted when taping the
record mooched from our friends.
This album is so good we may
have to buy it ourselves. A true
keeper-of-the-faith will even like
the movie (it Look me half of the
75 minute movie just to check out
the equipment they used).
It is silly to give another
catalogue of the Beatles' talents;
let us just note the incredible
versatility of McCartney's voice,
the unique and inventive guitar of
both Harrison and Lennon, and
the tasteful understatement of
Ringo's drumming. The best songs
include "Two of Us," "I Dig a
Pony," "Nothing's Gonna
Change," "One after 909" and

Sinatra? Dean Martin? Hoagy
Carmichael? George Burns and
Gracie Allen?? No . . . slowly, it
dawned on me... that
voice. . . an uncanny imitation of
Ringo Starr!!!
Now that I've got the album, I
find that it's Ringo himself. It's
incredible; Candy and The Magic
Christian made me wince, but this
leaves me speechless. Computer
projections of the trend indicate
that Ringo will next be seen as a
ventriloquist dummy on the Ed
Flubbermann show.
It's not that Ringo's voice is so

terrible; in most places he is
heavily double-tracked, cunningly
overdubbed and otherwise
dehumanized, and he does
demonstrate once and for all that
he can sing on key. The material
and the arrangements are beyond
belief.
A George Martin arranged
version of "Dream" (even our
dedicated trivia expert was
stumped as to who last performed
this number) caught Ringo's voice
at its breathiest. "Star Dust,"
arranged by McCartney is pretty
good although it's not Ringo's
best vocal. The bassist in the
Plastic Ono band, Klaus Voorman,
arranged a reasonable rendition of
"I'm a Fool to Care."
Bottom Two
The two worst cuts come
back-to-back (or belly-to-belly
depending on your point of view);
"You Always Hurt the One You
Love" has all sorts of highly
offensive brass and the distinct
sound of a "Rhythm Ace" in the
first 12 bars. "Have I Told You
Lately That I Love You," left me
scratching the wills; the rhythm
(a series of ummphhs) is horrible,
the dynamics incredibly

contrived, and the violin resounds
as though played by Jack Benny's
butler (Rochester). "Bye Bye
Blackbird" falls far short of the
version on Joe Cocker's first
album.
This SENTIMENTAL
JOURNEY by Ringo is most
reminiscent of a turgid ten-day
"Big Band" festival featuring
Buddy Rich on the kazoo,
"Around the World in 80 Days," a
strip show, and a can of Lawrence
Welk cake icing. It ranks with the
Lee Marvin release of "I was born
under a Wanderin' Star" ("I've
never seen a place that didn't look
better lookin' back") as the most
amazing release of the year. Is this
the kind of vanguard art that the
Beatles meant to nurture when
they formed Apple Records?? Oh
well, at least we've solved the
problem of what to give for
Father's Day.
Speaking of super heavy
albums, there is a new Who album
out, LIVE AT LEED'S. Once
again, the Who prove that they
can put you to sleep and wake
you up with the best of them. A
slightly long and beatless version
of "My Generation" breaks into
the fantastic strains of "See
Me/Feel Me/Touch Me ..." Every
time I hear that transition, it
raises the scruff on the back of
my neck.
Both the excitement of a live
performance and the recording
quality of a studio (weird reverb
on Roger Daltry's voice) come
over in this release. Daltry tried
time and again to prove that he
can sing higher than Robert Plant
of Led Zeppelin. The most
effective songs on the album are
"Summertime Blues" (you can see
this performed in "Woodstock")
and "Shakin' All Over." Peter
Townsend, who has some of the
best body moves around, comes
over very well; in places he sounds
like an army of guitar players
while in several spots his ax sings
like an acoustic. I do wish,
however, that they had done more
from "Tommy."

It looks like Bill Graham has
heard about the recession in the
nation's economy; he is staging
shows guaranteed to get some of
that good old consumer spending
going. May 30th, he'll have the
Jimi Hendrix Experience at
Berkeley Community Theater
with Mitch Mitchell back on the
skins and Billy Cox manning the
bass. May 28-31, Mike Bloomfield
and Friends will appear with Blues
Image ("Ride, Captain, Ride" on
AM) and Silver Metre
("Superstar" on your AM). This
weekend he has James Taylor
(first artist signed by Apple, now
with Warner Brothers) and
Pen tangle at Berkeley
Community. That promises to be
sort of a quiet tasteful evening.
Over at the Fillmore West, he
has the king of the blues, Mr. 8.8.
King, and the head pretender to
the throne, Albert King. Many is
the night, I have called plaintively
for this dynamic duo to appear in
a poker hand. At the Family Dog
(where the acts have been slacking
off lately), you'll find Shortie and
The Fourth Way. Big Brother will
be holding at the Keystone
Korner, while Delanie and Bonnie
and all kin'a other people head a
bill including Love appear at the
Monterey Fairgrounds. Call an FM
rock station to find out where and
when. Next week sometime,
Country Weather, Guess Who, and
Buddy Miles will appear at the
Santa Clara Fairgrounds.
By the way, the flipside of "Let
It Be" is called "You Know My
Name (Now Look Up the
Number)" and is absolutely
outasight.
