# 'Godot' Creates Human Agony In Final SRT Production
## 
### ROBERT EVERDING 
Samuel Beckett's Waiting tor Godot is a
classic—perhaps the classic—of the modern theater.
Similar to Oedipus and Hamlet, it defies simple
interpretation so that each production begins a
new chapter in the history of the play.
Godot creates the human agony of waiting. It
shows Vladimir and Estragon waiting on a desolate
road for Mr. Godot. They must believe that he will
come although he never appears. Slowly stripped
of this final illusion about life, the two
strangers—unable to commit suicide—face the
horror of going on . . . and on . . . and on.
Despite this nihilistic view of life, Godot is a
funny play. It is filled with the spirit of vaudville
and music halls. However, this is the kind of
humor that drifts away slowly like the sand from
an hourglass for what seemed gratuitous for the
strangers at the start soon becomes necessary. In
the end the humor only adds to the grotesque
terror of the situation.
Symphony of Time
Beckett's play is a symphony of rhythms. Its
success depends on its variety and its pacing. It
must slowly enlarge from the affable private world
of two clowns to the tragic perspective of their
place in an antagonistic universe with its slave
time. As the lens moves gradually away, the pauses
and silences grow equally longer. Man begins to
sense the vacuity and insignificance of his
existence.
In the SRT production, director Stephan
Rosenfield has focused on time and its role as the
hautning master of life. Choosing to externalize
time and its effect on man, the director uses
stop-action freezes in repeated patterns to stress
the terror of silence and the boredom of life. It is a

subtly disturbing effect.
Gene Parseghian is a superb Vladimir. From the
opening circus-clown routines to the moving final
exchange with the messenger of Godot, Mr.
Parseghian exhibits a range that blends a sense of
comedy with the ability for honest seriousness. He
knows when to be subtle and when to be brash.
This Vladimir has captured the very rhythm of his
sensitive character. It is a highly professional
performance.
Admirable Performances
William Frankfather is also penetrating as
Pozzo, the egotistical master whose blindness leads
him on an endless search with no destination in
sight. It is a difficult role that demands a transition
from the strong master to the helpless victim of
the universe. This actor does an admirable job with
the part.
The remainder of the cast are equally effective.
Stephen Book is a delightful Estragon. Bruce
Pribram and Don Elbel are convincing in their
supporting roles.
The technical aspects are especially well
executed. In a play that demands both subtlty and
power, the designers of costume, set and lighting
created the precise mood of the play. Special
credit should go to R. Craig Wolf whose lighting
creates an atmosphere that underlines the
intention of the moment with constant
appropriateness.
"Godot" is not an easy play to produce. It
demands that director, actors and technical
designers work at top efficiency. SRT has blended
these elements into a unique and interesting
evening in the theater. The University is fortunate
to have such a production in the Little Theater. It
continues until Sunday.

of two clowns to the tragic perspective of their
place in an antagonistic universe with its slave
time. As the lens moves gradually away, the pauses
and silences grow equally longer. Man begins to
sense the vacuity and insignificance of his
existence.
In the SRT production, director Stephan
Rosenfield has focused on time and its role as the
hautning master of life. Choosing to externalize
time and its effect on man, the director uses
stop-action freezes in repeated patterns to stress
the terror of silence and the boredom of life. It is a

subtly disturbing effect.
Gene Parseghian is a superb Vladimir. From the
opening circus-clown routines to the moving final
exchange with the messenger of Godot, Mr.
Parseghian exhibits a range that blends a sense of
comedy with the ability for honest seriousness. He
knows when to be subtle and when to be brash.
This Vladimir has captured the very rhythm of his
sensitive character. It is a highly professional
performance.
Admirable Performances
William Frankfather is also penetrating as
Pozzo, the egotistical master whose blindness leads
him on an endless search with no destination in
sight. It is a difficult role that demands a transition
from the strong master to the helpless victim of
the universe. This actor does an admirable job with
the part.
The remainder of the cast are equally effective.
Stephen Book is a delightful Estragon. Bruce
Pribram and Don Elbel are convincing in their
supporting roles.
The technical aspects are especially well
executed. In a play that demands both subtlty and
power, the designers of costume, set and lighting
created the precise mood of the play. Special
credit should go to R. Craig Wolf whose lighting
creates an atmosphere that underlines the
intention of the moment with constant
appropriateness.
"Godot" is not an easy play to produce. It
demands that director, actors and technical
designers work at top efficiency. SRT has blended
these elements into a unique and interesting
evening in the theater. The University is fortunate
to have such a production in the Little Theater. It
continues until Sunday.
Samuel Beckett's Waiting tor Godot is a
classic—perhaps the classic—of the modern theater.
Similar to Oedipus and Hamlet, it defies simple
interpretation so that each production begins a
new chapter in the history of the play.
Godot creates the human agony of waiting. It
shows Vladimir and Estragon waiting on a desolate
road for Mr. Godot. They must believe that he will
come although he never appears. Slowly stripped
of this final illusion about life, the two
strangers—unable to commit suicide—face the
horror of going on . . . and on . . . and on.
Despite this nihilistic view of life, Godot is a
funny play. It is filled with the spirit of vaudville
and music halls. However, this is the kind of
humor that drifts away slowly like the sand from
an hourglass for what seemed gratuitous for the
strangers at the start soon becomes necessary. In
the end the humor only adds to the grotesque
terror of the situation.
Symphony of Time
Beckett's play is a symphony of rhythms. Its
success depends on its variety and its pacing. It
must slowly enlarge from the affable private world
of two clowns to the tragic perspective of their
place in an antagonistic universe with its slave
time. As the lens moves gradually away, the pauses
and silences grow equally longer. Man begins to
sense the vacuity and insignificance of his
