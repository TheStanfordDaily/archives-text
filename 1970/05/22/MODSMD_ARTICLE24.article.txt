# No Such Luck
## Legal Defense Music 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Recent campus activities have sparked various
groups to orient themselves to raising the funds so
vital to carrying on work for peace. Doughnuts
and ice cream are sold by the gastronomically
oriented, benefit performances are given by
theatre groups, and art sales are conducted by the
artists. To try to provide funds for Legal Defense,
a group of local rock musicians recently cut an
album and tried to market it in the area. Legal
Defense is now needed to bail the guys out who
were selling the record to try to gain funds for
legal defense.
The group took many old favorites from groups
all around the world and mercilessly butchered
them into their own arrangements. The group is
called NO SUCH TRUCK and the title of their
first and hopefully last album is CAMPUS BUMS
MEET SPIRO A( INEW AND LIVE TO TELL
ABOUT IT or YOU LOSE BUCKWHEAT.
High Quality
Side one of the album is matched in quality
only by side two. Numbers include:
Expensive Thrills (2:17) features the blending
melodies of breaking glass clattering to the
pavement, brief but powerful chords of
injunctions being sung in the background and the
FCM playing the sweet potato.
Let It Be or It Will Never Heal (0:43) highlights
warblings of 43 campus groups claiming solidarity
all at once and builds artfully to a crescendo of
chants, slogans, radio broadcasts, and prepared
statements.
Crossavenues (5:34) combines the talents of the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department men's
choir, the San Jose Tactical Squad's glee club (yes
it's true you have to be 6'4" and eat raw meat),
and the Off-ROTC 44's injunction functionsâ€”a

new rock group in presenting a ballad of coming
together.
Jumping Jack Flush It's Gas, Gas, Gas (2:13)
uses new advances in recording to balance the
gentle background of hissing cannisters with the
dynamic gasps and sobs of downwind people. This
tearful lament is an old standard and has been
performed at Berkeley, Selma, Chicago, and Kent
State.
Second Side Rushed
The second side of the album was by necessity
cut short for rumor had it that the recording
studio would be raided and searched because one
member of the group had gotten a parking ticket.
The songs are therefore a bit more rushed than on
the first side.
Guaiitaiiainarijuaiia paints a musical portrait
which captures the sights, sounds, and smells of
various campus sit-ins. A feeling of movement
accompanies this tune, carrying the listener up to
new heights.
I Second That Commotion (1:23) swings out a
driving counterpart whose beating rhythm sets
bodies moving and heads cracking. The pace is set
in a rock beat in the first movement and a military
tempo as the piece continues.
Fight m > Fire (17:06) is a fitting conclusion to
the album. The band has taken one of Smokey's
tunes and added some quaint touches. Using
techniques made possible by dual tracked full
dimensional super sonic fully balanced
dyna-groovic, quadraphonic simulated stereo and a
few hints from Mission Impossible the technician
have designed an album which self-destructs at the
end of the last song.
Producers of the album have attempted to get
somebody to bootleg it but nobody was
interested. Inform your parents by buying a copy
and sending it home.
