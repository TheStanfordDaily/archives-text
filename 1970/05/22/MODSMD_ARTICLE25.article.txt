# Special Show By The Ladies
## 
### 
In case you've been holding your breath for the announcement,
the special women's gymnastics demonstration is scheduled for the
women's gym this afternoon at 3:30.
Which although it isn't exactly the athletic heavy of the
year should n V be taken lightly for a number of reasons.
First, it's free.
Second, interest in gymnastics is on the rise because oj the
increasing proficiency of both the men's and women's teams on this
campus.
Third, a good gymnastics performance is a visual delight for the
observer.
Fourth, those tights are far out. (That, for the benefit of the raging
anti-chauvinists, is a fact, nor a value judgment.)
Women's gymnastics, for the edification of any stray fan who may
be ignorant on the matter, consists of four events free exercise,
vaulting, balance beam and uneven parallel bars.
And though none is particularly easy, the balance beam a
four-inch wide plank elevated four feet off the ground, is especially
challenging.
Because on that beam, on which most would hesitate to venture
while even straight or sober, the young ladies do cartwheels,
handstands, rolls, walkovers and dance steps.
All the moves are supposed to compliment each other, transforming
the routine into a dramatic flow of movement which should be as
smooth on the beam as it would be if it were done on the ground.
The other events feature the usual prosaic stuff such as
roundoff-baekhandspring-flip (layout j-full twists.
Stanford team members, who frequently spend as many as fifteen
hours a week in practice, include Carolyn Bond, Julie Cates, Deborah
Fllingson, Sue l.yddon, Lisa Quinn, Jean Van Ft ton and Allison
Wente.
This year they competed in Jour intercollegiate meets in the bay
area, considered to have some of the best competition in the nation,
and won three of them.
Miss Heidi Klaus, who came to America from Germany six years
ago, is credited with the inspiration and coaching which has motivated
the Stanford team and which has also tripled the number of women's
physical education classes available in gymnastics.
Having been a gymnast since she was six years old. Miss Klaus
operates with the philosophy that gymnastics should be fun, not
work.
And it should not only be fun for the gymnasts, but it will
probably be enjoyable for the spectators this afternoon, too.
