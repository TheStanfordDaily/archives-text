# On Tour: Tanner And The Tennis Racket
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Once upon a time, Roscoe
Tanner had time to moonlight
with football, basketball and
soccer. Nowadays, tennis occupies
most of his time.
His participation in the sport
began at age five and continued in
a spot which seems to be a
modern mecca for young tennis
talent: Lookout Mountain,
Tennessee. Besides Tanner, who
captured the nation's top ranking
for junior netters last year,
Lookout Mountain is also the
home of Zan Guerry, currently a
star at Rice.
Roscoe and Zan live only two
blocks away from each other and
played frequently when Tanner
was attending Baylor High School
in Chattanooga. But despite his
early start, Tanner says he never
tasted success till his second year
in 16 and under competition.
"That year, I reached the
semi-finals in the nationals at
Kalamazoo and got to the finals in
five other major tournaments,"
Roscoe relates.
Go West . . .
Tanner explained why he came
to Stanford, "Four reasons.
Weather. It's in California. The
academic standing. And the
coach."
On the subject of Coach Dick
Gould, Roscoe was candid. "We

have one of the best coaches in
the nation. He's willing to do
more for you and help you when
you need it. Coach Gould is closer
to the players than most coaches
are, kind of like a teammate,"
Tanner said.
Roscoe was quick to add, "You
know who's in charge, though."
When asked how much time
Stanford varsity racketmen spend
on the courts each day, Roscoe
replied, "We play about two and a
half hours a day, Monday through
Friday. Recently, we've been
playing more because of week-end
tournaments."
Needless to say, Roscoe Tanner
has experienced relative success in
these matches. Teaming with
senior captain Rob Rippner,
Tanner reached the finals of the
California State Championships a
month ago. At the Ojai
Intercollegiates last month,
Tanner defeated UCLA's Jeff
Borowiak in the semis to meet
Haroon Rahim in the finals.
In what Roscoe describes as his
hardest match ever, Rahim felled
Stanford's top Brave at Ojai
18-16, 2-6, 6-4. Earlier in the
season, Tanner had outlasted the
Pakistani-Davis Cupper on the
Indians' home courts 16-14 in the
third set. Roscoe considers that
match to be his greatest win.
A few weeks ago, Tanner upset
Pancho Cornejo, a Davis Cup star

from Chile who had previously
beaten Arthur Ashe. Tanner's
next opponent was none other
than Arthur Ashe. Ashe emerged
victorious.
Roscoe says he feels "real
good" about being named to the
back-up Davis Cup squad this
spring. Next year, he's gunning for
the first string Cup team. And
after that, he plans on climbing as
high as his talent will take him.
"Number One! ... I hope."
On the Road
This summer Tanner will travel
the circuit and compete in all the
major domestic championships.
Among others, Roscoe will play in
the four major grass tournaments,
the Amateur title at Rochester,
the Nationals at Brookline, and
finally Forest Hills.
How about Stanford's future?
Immediately, Tanner is concerned
with the upcoming NCAA
Championships. "We're third in
the conference, but we're also
third in the nation. We have as
good a chance as anybody,"
commented Tanner.
And next year? Stanford might
even field a squad better than this
year. The top three netmen will
return in Roscoe, Rick Fisher, and
Gerry Groslimond. Also back will
be junior veteran John Wright
who sat out this season with a
broken leg.

Vying lor the last two varsity
spots will be freshmen newcomers
Paul Sidone, a probable doubles
partner for Tanner from Pebble
Beach, and Sandy Mayer, a
highly-sought high school
standout from New York.
Roscoe Tanner is 18. Hell ride
his tennis talent as far as possible.
His career in tennis is dependent
upon how economical a "player"
salary is. "I could never be a
teaching pro; it takes too much
patience. Maybe I'll be a lawyer."

are, kind of like a teammate,"
Tanner said.
Roscoe was quick to add, "You
know who's in charge, though."
When asked how much time
Stanford varsity racketmen spend
on the courts each day, Roscoe
replied, "We play about two and a
half hours a day, Monday through
Friday. Recently, we've been
playing more because of week-end
tournaments."
Needless to say, Roscoe Tanner
has experienced relative success in
these matches. Teaming with
senior captain Rob Rippner,
Tanner reached the finals of the
California State Championships a
month ago. At the Ojai
Intercollegiates last month,
Tanner defeated UCLA's Jeff
Borowiak in the semis to meet
Haroon Rahim in the finals.
In what Roscoe describes as his
hardest match ever, Rahim felled
Stanford's top Brave at Ojai
18-16, 2-6, 6-4. Earlier in the
season, Tanner had outlasted the
Pakistani-Davis Cupper on the
Indians' home courts 16-14 in the
third set. Roscoe considers that
match to be his greatest win.
A few weeks ago, Tanner upset
Pancho Cornejo, a Davis Cup star

from Chile who had previously
beaten Arthur Ashe. Tanner's
next opponent was none other
than Arthur Ashe. Ashe emerged
victorious.
Roscoe says he feels "real
good" about being named to the
back-up Davis Cup squad this
spring. Next year, he's gunning for
the first string Cup team. And
after that, he plans on climbing as
high as his talent will take him.
"Number One! ... I hope."
On the Road
This summer Tanner will travel
the circuit and compete in all the
major domestic championships.
Among others, Roscoe will play in
the four major grass tournaments,
the Amateur title at Rochester,
the Nationals at Brookline, and
finally Forest Hills.
How about Stanford's future?
Immediately, Tanner is concerned
with the upcoming NCAA
Championships. "We're third in
the conference, but we're also
third in the nation. We have as
good a chance as anybody,"
commented Tanner.
And next year? Stanford might
even field a squad better than this
year. The top three netmen will
return in Roscoe, Rick Fisher, and
Gerry Groslimond. Also back will
be junior veteran John Wright
who sat out this season with a
broken leg.

Vying lor the last two varsity
spots will be freshmen newcomers
Paul Sidone, a probable doubles
partner for Tanner from Pebble
Beach, and Sandy Mayer, a
highly-sought high school
standout from New York.
Roscoe Tanner is 18. Hell ride
his tennis talent as far as possible.
His career in tennis is dependent
upon how economical a "player"
salary is. "I could never be a
teaching pro; it takes too much
patience. Maybe I'll be a lawyer."




This summer*
Tanner will ft lav
in llie jour
m a jar grass
tournaments...
Once upon a time, Roscoe
Tanner had time to moonlight
with football, basketball and
soccer. Nowadays, tennis occupies
most of his time.
His participation in the sport
began at age five and continued in
a spot which seems to be a
modern mecca for young tennis
talent: Lookout Mountain,
Tennessee. Besides Tanner, who
captured the nation's top ranking
for junior netters last year,
Lookout Mountain is also the
home of Zan Guerry, currently a
star at Rice.
Roscoe and Zan live only two
blocks away from each other and
played frequently when Tanner
was attending Baylor High School
in Chattanooga. But despite his
early start, Tanner says he never
tasted success till his second year
in 16 and under competition.
"That year, I reached the
semi-finals in the nationals at
Kalamazoo and got to the finals in
five other major tournaments,"
Roscoe relates.
Go West . . .
Tanner explained why he came
to Stanford, "Four reasons.
Weather. It's in California. The
academic standing. And the
coach."
On the subject of Coach Dick
Gould, Roscoe was candid. "We

have one of the best coaches in
the nation. He's willing to do
more for you and help you when
you need it. Coach Gould is closer
to the players than most coaches
are, kind of like a teammate,"
Tanner said.
Roscoe was quick to add, "You

When asked how much time
