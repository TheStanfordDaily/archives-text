# Senate Commences Budget Proceedings
## 
### 
The student Senate last night
barely started voting on next
year's ASSU budget.
Voting on the budget, which is
supposed to be completed this
spring, hardly got beyond
discussion of the first
organization, the Asian American
Student Alliance.
A quorum call by ASSU
President Pat C. Shea interupted
voting on the AASA's allocation.
Shea had called for a quorum
call earlier in the evening when
Senate Chairman John Shoch
tried to start the meeting to
discuss non-budget matters. The
Senate had waited an hour and a
half to start. Shoch then delayed
counting the call until a quorum
was present.
Doug McHenry then suggested
that Shea was trying to prevent
consideration of the budget by
the current Senate, whose
majority is frequently antagonistic
to his politics.
The Senate rejected a move

sponsored by Loudin Beam to
give the Black Students Union,
the AASA, and MECHA $8300
apiece, the Constitutional limit.
Most of the twonty-odd members
present didn't vote.
Beam had urged the Senate to
take the action saying that the
$8300 was the minimum the
organizations deserved.
The Senate also elected Chris
Banks, a freshman, elections
commissioner for next year.
Shea issued the following
statement last night:
"Tonight's Senate meeting
allowed for exactly the type of
unrepresentative government for
which the Senate is already so
noted. Yale Braunstein insipidly
called me an "obstructionist" for
calling a quorum one hour and
one-half after the meeting was
scheduled to begin.
"All students should be entitled
to adequate consideration and
responsible allocation of their
funds. The Senate is no longer
representative nor responsible in
this area. Hopefully, next year's
Senate will be more capable of
executing this function equitably
and efficiently.
"All concerned students should
talk to their Senators about their
money. The list of Senators as
well as the copy of the budget
recommendations are available in
the ASSU Office."


ANTI-WAR BABYâ€”Matthew Joseph may have been born yesterday but his
mother was sitting-in at the ROTC building daily awaiting his arrival. His mother,
Mrs. Jill Joseph, identified herself to the SJC; it is unclear whether Matthew, too,
will receive a summons.
