## Cronkite Charges Smear Campaign 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - CBS News
accused the White House
yesterday of an "undercover
campaign to discredit" the
network's news coverage.
A CBS Evening News report
stated the White House was
attempting to cast doubts on the
authenticity of a television story
which showed a wounded North
Vietnamese prisoner being
stabbed while lying on the
ground.
Commentator Walter Cronkite
said the attempt to discredit
Columbia Broadcasting System
News included an allegation that
"the story was faked."
CBS correspondent Don
Webster then produced a South
Vietnamese sergeant
who -interviewed through an
interpreter-said he stabbed the
fallen North Vietnamese "because
the enemy soldier was reaching
for a rifle."
The sergeant was identified on
the program as Nguyen Van Mot,
and he was quoted as saying he
killed the prisoner in self-defense,
stabbing the man once and then
plunging the knife into the prone
body a second time.
* Cronkite said reporters and
columnists have been prompted
"to publish White House and
Pentagon suspicions about the
authenticity of the report," which
was broadcast six months ago.
"Clark Mollenhoff, special
counsel to the President,"
Cronkite went on, "confirms that
he has investigated the CBS
Vietnam story but refuses to say
who ordered the investigation. He
acknowledges he talked to several
reporters and columnists."

Mollenhoff could not be
reached immediately, but a White
House spokesman said late
Thursday, "There has been no
official investigation of CBS, and
there is not an investigation by
the White House of CBS."
Asked if that statement would
stand for the Pentagon as well, the
aide declared, "I said the White
House."
A Pentagon spokesman issued a
"no comment."
CBS said officials questioned
whether Americans were involved
and whether it was actual combat.
With Webster narrating, the
network showed enlarged
photographs from their film,
which they said showed an
American adviser and some
helicopters bearing U.S. insignia.
Also, Webster said, what some
interpreted as small flag-like
practice targets actually were
"Vietnam ...poor man's
scarecrows.
Ohio State
COLUMBUS, Ohio(AP) - Militant
students blocked a main street at
Ohio State University Thursday,
prompting a callout of National
Guardsmen to the newly reopened
campus.
Until Tuesday, the university
had been closed for 12 days
because of student riots.
The new demonstrations
appeared to be a continuation of
last month's protests when
students called for a strike
because of what they termed
inadequate a dm in i strati on
response to their demands. The
demands included increased black
enrollment, student power and
women's rights.

Two hundred police, patrolmen
and sheriff's deputies broke up a
band of several hundred militant
students that had blocked High
Street, a main city thoroughfare
adjacent to the campus, for two
hours.
Demonstrators retreated a
block or more ahead of law
officers, then disappeared into
crowds of spectators.
The demonstration started on
the campus when some 4,000
students attended a noon rally.
Militant speakers calling for a
renewal of a strike were booed.
University authorities this week
directed administrative officers to
conduct continuous negotiation
with student leaders over a list of
28 demands presented last month.
Cooper Bill
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. John
Sherman Cooper, R-Ky., and the
three cosponsors of the
Cooper-Church amendment
introduced a compromise wording
yesterday.
The changes make clear that
the proposed ban on funds for
U.S. operations in Cambodia
would take effect only after the
June 30 deadline set by Nixon for
withdrawal.
It also spells out that the action
would be taken "in concert with
the declared objectives of the
President of the United States to
avoid the involvement of the
United States in Cambodia after
July 1, 1970."
"We haven't an agreement"
with the White House, said
Cooper, who has been negotiating
with presidential aides. Sen. Frank
Church, D-Idaho, said "we have
done with this amendment the
best we feel we can do."

Both emphasized that the
change would leave intact the
substantive parts of their
amendment.
