# Public Invited Here For Second Week
## 
### 
Stanford students have
reiterated their invitation to the
public at large to join them in a
continuation of the Open Campus
Movement this weekend.
Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling
will speak at 2 on Sunday as part
of the program of informal
discussions between students and
community spokesmen for all
points of view.
Last Sunday some 500
Peninsula residents ranging from
Birchers and Establishment types
to Communists came on campus
to voice the views of the Silent
Majority to listening Stanford
students. All concerned rated the
experience a "great success."
According to the proponent of
an open campus, sociology
graduate student Jacques
Delacroix, the idea behind the
open campus is not to hold a
"teach in," but rather a "learn in"
for Stanford students will to
expose themselves to the
arguments and beliefs of anyone
willing to come to campus.
The Committee for an Open
Campus, organizers of the
weekends'events strongly urged all
students and faculty to spend
some time on campus talking to
visitors on either day. They said
that last weekend the visitors
eager to talk to students had
trouble finding a studeht as the

turnout of ..tudents was so thin.
A street dance featuring several
rock bands is planned for
Saturday night between Branner
and Stern dorms. Non amplified
music, craft exhibits, scheduled
and informal discussions are on
tap for Sunday. Individual
invitations have been sent to local
labor, civic and political
organizations.
All events take place in the
vicinity of White Plaza and the
Old Union.
