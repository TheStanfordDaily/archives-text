## Is Nixon Isolated? 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON -In the past few
weeks it has been revealed that
President Nixon has become more
and more isolated from his
Cabinet. Interior Secretary Walter
Hickel said he had only seen the
President twice in 15 months.
Other Cabinet officers claim
Hickel was fortunate to see the
President thai many times.
I can now reveal that it is no
accident that the President is
unavailable to his Cabinet officers.
There are definite safeguards set
up by White House staff" members
to make sure the President does
not come into contact with
anyone in his Administration.
This is how it works.
At every White House gate in
the guardhouse there are
photographs of every member of
the Cabinet. This is so the White
House police can identify them
immediately.
Police Orders
Whenever a member of the
President's Cabinet shows up at
any of the gates, the police have
orders to alert someone on the
White House staff that there is a
Cabinet officer at the gate.
A White House summer intern
is then dispatched to the gate to
ask the Cabinet officer what his
business is. The intern assures the
officer he will transmit any input
to the President.
If the Cabinet officer still
insists on seeing the President, he
is escorted into the White House
and asked to wait in the Secret
Service men's locker room.
White House Locker Room
A third assistant to a White
House aide is then sent to the
locker room to see if he can
persuade the Cabinet officer to
leave the White House without
causing trouble. He tries to assure
the Cabinet officer that Mr. Nixon
is always happy to hear what
anyone in his Administration has

to say, and suggests that the best
way for a Cabinet officer to
communicate with the President is
through his congressman.
If this fails, the Cabinet officer
is then taken to the waiting room
of the stenographic pool, where a
secretary of one of the White
Housy aides is sent to talk to him.
Occasionally a Cabinet officer
will still insist on seeing someone
in higher authority, and then he
will be taken to the Navy mess in
the White House to talk to one of
the minor White House aides,
while the aide is having lunch.
If this aide cannot persuade the
Cabinet officer to leave, he is then
escorted upstairs to Press
Secretary Ron Ziegler's assistant.
By this time, the President's
three chief aides, John Erlichman,
Bob Haldeman and Henry
Kissinger, have received word that
there is a Cabinet officer in the
building.
Covered Wagons
So they go on "Red Alert," and
they push their desks in the hall
outside the President's office in
covered-wagon fashion to block
the Cabinet officer from breaking
in on the President. Each aide has
a different reason why the
Cabinet man cannot see Mr.
Nixon.
If for some reason the Cabinet
officer manages to hurdle over the
desks and get by the three White
House aides into the President's
office, he still is not guaranteed
that he will see the President.
Crouching behind the door for
just such an emergency is Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell, the only
Cabinet member who has access
to the President. The attorney
general will try to tackle the
Cabinet officer before he gets to
Mr. Nixon's desk. If Mitchell fails
to wrestle him to the floor, then
the Cabinet officer is granted a
five minute audience with the
President of the United States.

and asked to wait in the Secret
Service men's locker room.
White House Locker Room
A third assistant to a White
House aide is then sent to the
locker room to see if he can
persuade the Cabinet officer to
leave the White House without
causing trouble. He tries to assure
the Cabinet officer that Mr. Nixon
is always happy to hear what
anyone in his Administration has

to say, and suggests that the best
way for a Cabinet officer to
communicate with the President is
through his congressman.
If this fails, the Cabinet officer
is then taken to the waiting room
of the stenographic pool, where a
secretary of one of the White
Housy aides is sent to talk to him.
Occasionally a Cabinet officer
will still insist on seeing someone
in higher authority, and then he
will be taken to the Navy mess in
the White House to talk to one of
the minor White House aides,
while the aide is having lunch.
If this aide cannot persuade the
Cabinet officer to leave, he is then
escorted upstairs to Press
Secretary Ron Ziegler's assistant.
By this time, the President's
three chief aides, John Erlichman,
Bob Haldeman and Henry
Kissinger, have received word that
there is a Cabinet officer in the
building.
Covered Wagons
So they go on "Red Alert," and
they push their desks in the hall
outside the President's office in
covered-wagon fashion to block
the Cabinet officer from breaking
in on the President. Each aide has
a different reason why the
Cabinet man cannot see Mr.
Nixon.
If for some reason the Cabinet
officer manages to hurdle over the
desks and get by the three White
House aides into the President's
office, he still is not guaranteed
that he will see the President.
Crouching behind the door for
just such an emergency is Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell, the only
Cabinet member who has access
to the President. The attorney
general will try to tackle the
Cabinet officer before he gets to
Mr. Nixon's desk. If Mitchell fails
to wrestle him to the floor, then
the Cabinet officer is granted a
five minute audience with the
President of the United States.
WASHINGTON -In the past few
weeks it has been revealed that
President Nixon has become more
and more isolated from his
Cabinet. Interior Secretary Walter
Hickel said he had only seen the
President twice in 15 months.
Other Cabinet officers claim
Hickel was fortunate to see the
President thai many times.
I can now reveal that it is no
accident that the President is
unavailable to his Cabinet officers.
There are definite safeguards set
up by White House staff" members
to make sure the President does
not come into contact with
anyone in his Administration.
This is how it works.
At every White House gate in
the guardhouse there are
photographs of every member of
the Cabinet. This is so the White
House police can identify them
immediately.
Police Orders
Whenever a member of the
President's Cabinet shows up at
any of the gates, the police have
orders to alert someone on the
White House staff that there is a
Cabinet officer at the gate.
A White House summer intern
is then dispatched to the gate to
ask the Cabinet officer what his
business is. The intern assures the
officer he will transmit any input
to the President.
If the Cabinet officer still
insists on seeing the President, he
is escorted into the White House
and asked to wait in the Secret
Service men's locker room.
