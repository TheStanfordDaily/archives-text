# The 						First Man
## 
### 
There are times in life when one feels lonely
These are times to write
Letters
To a friend
To my brother, Luis.
There are times in life when one is seared
To live to die
Up on a hill, alone
Until. . .
Until someone has gone before.
What a long, lonely road
To climb, I wonder
With no one behind
Yet all people write and tell stories
Of the first man.
These are times to join
And go
Perhaps forever and beyond the hill
But other days of tomorrow
Will see, will see . . .
The sunset of an old age.
