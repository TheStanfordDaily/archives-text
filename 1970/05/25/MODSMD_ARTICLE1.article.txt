Prof. H. Thomas James, dean of
the Stanford School of Education
and a nationally known authority
on public school financing, has
~een named the first president of
the newly created Spencer
Foundation in Chicago, 111.
His resignation will become
effective at Stanford "as soon as
an orderly transition to a new
dean can be accomplished," James
said. He hopes this will be around
~ept. 1.
The Spencer Foundation's
purpose is to work for the
improvement of education at all
levels.
Dean James came to Stanford
as a professor of education in
1958 and was named dean in
966. In 196H, he was named a
founding member of the National
Academy of Education.
Under his leadership, four
endowed Jacks professorships
have filled with
internati i.'jily renowned scholars
and 112 /aer,<,ors. Many joint
jpoir » »ts have been made
with * ■ (acuities of psychology,
politica l science, sociology,
communications, anthropology,
eco' jmics, and business.
Last fall, a new joint degree
program was inaugurated with the
Graduate School of Business in

doctorate in educational
administration and a master's
degree in business.
A few years ago, a national
survey of educators conducted by
Columbia University ranked the
Stanford School of Education
.rst in the excellence of its
research.
In his letter of resignation to
President Pitzer, Dean James
wrote: "I find this a most difficult
request to make. Yet I am

persuaded that the opportunities
offered by the Spencer
Foundation to be of service to
education for the remaining
decade of my career represent a
challenge which cannot be ignored
and will, I believe, compensate for
the sense of loss 1 have at leaving
the School."
In accepting the resignation,
President Pitzer said: "No
university likes to lose an
outstanding member of the
faculty, even to a position of great
national responsibility. Tom
James has indeed made a
magnificent contribution to
Stanford. Under his leadership,
the School of Education has
enlarged its national and
international recognition. He has
been an able administrator and a
valuable colleague. We deeply
regret his leaving but wish him
well, of course, in this new
assignment."
Dean James, 54, is a native of
Wisconsin. Fie was educated at
LaCrosse State College and
received graduate degrees at the
Universities of Wisconsin and
Chicago.
In 1954, he went to the
University of Chicago, where he
was assistant and later associate
director of the Midwest
Administration Center. For the
next four years, he also served as
associate professor of education
and director of field services.
Since coming to Stanford in 1958,
he has made nation-wide studies
of school financing problems and
school board governance, served
as a consultant, and written many
articles for professional
journals.
