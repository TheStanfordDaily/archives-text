## All-American Boyd 
### 
According to his associates, Bill Boyd, former Stanford
student and "all-American boy" candidate for the state
Assembly, has offered to sell illegal drugs. We could hardly
care whether Boyd, like so many other students, has been
involved with drugs.
What we do care about is a democratic system based on
honesty, not hypocrisy. Boyd stated last night that he now
opposes legalization of marijuana, and admits his ideas have
changed since last year. Such a change of heart is possible.
But we still think the public has a right to know Boyd's
background. That's why we are printing the information,
despite feelings that drug-selling in itself should not
necessarily be held against a candidate.
If Washington reporters told all they know about our
representatives in the federal government, citizens would
not be at all shocked by allegations like those that arose
after Edward Kennedy's accident on Chappaquidick. We
should not expect all leaders to be heroes.Nor should we be
shielded from the fact that they aren't.
Boyd's involvement with drugs is not unusual for a man
of his age. In our minds, use or sale of drugs need not
inhibit one's ability to perform in public office. But the
time has come to meet fears about drug use head on.
Candidate Boyd's apparent duplicity is indeed a cause for
concern.
