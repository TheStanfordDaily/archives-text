# Cap And Gownless
## 
### 
The No Cap and Gown movement deserves the support of
all participants in commencement.
Not wearing the traditional academic regalia serves a
double purpose. A statement of protest against US policies
in Indo-China is made in a quiet, forceful manner to
colleagues and community. Second, the money raised by
cap and gown refunds will provide vital financial support for
peace candidates in critical Congressional races.
Nearly 80 percent of Yale seniors have pledged their cap
and gown fees to the National Peace Commencement fund;
the NYU faculty donated $2000. We urge Stanford
graduates, faculty and administrators to abandon cap and
gown as a gesture, symbolic and pragmatic, for an end to a
disastrous war.
