ROTC 44 Splits
Editor, The Daily:
We, the ROTC 44 and friends,
have, since May 4, effectively
closed down ROTC business in
the ROTC building. We have
pursued this activity in an effort
both to hinder the active training
of military personnel on campus
and to demonstrate our
conviction that such training
undermines and perverts the goals
and operations of an academic
community. We have succeeded in
disrupting the daily functioning of
ROTC on campus. We have seen
during the period of our sit-in that
action is being taken to remove
this repugnant institution from
Stanford. Therefore, we have, as
of May 24, determined that our
presence on the steps of the
ROTC building is no longer
necessary.
We are leaving.
We will meet at noon on
Tuesday, May 26, for a picnic
lunch on the lawn in front of the
ROTC building. We will hear
speakers from the Concerned
Asian Scholars discuss the place of
ROTC in the American military
establishment and in the war in
Indochina. We will take note of
the progress of the President's

Advisory Committee on ROTC
Affairs and of the state of ROTC
activities. We will applaud any
action which is being taken to
off-ROTC. We will respond to
inaction.
Come join us in our lunch, our
fun, our deliberations and our
actions.

New Movement
Editor, The Daily :
Summer is here in three weeks,
and Stanford students are
becoming involved in national
summer organization at Stanford
and at most colleges and
universities, forms are being
circulated for the Movement for a
New Congress. The aim is to
gather manpower pools all across
the nation; this is a national
effort. Computer lists of students
grouped by congressional district
will be available within two
weeks.
The contacts among students in
Congressional districts can
develop into more than an
election effort for peace
candidates. Simultaneously, we
can unite people who are deeply
distressed not only about Vietnam
but also about problems of civil
rights and ecology in order to

establish groups lot action beyond
November.
The following outline describes
how Stanford students will be
organized into their local groups,
which can then use the Movement
for a New Congress lists and other
resources to catalyze their
communities.
Method:
A. Prc-summer organization
1. All interested Stanford
students, faculty, etc. will
be signed up and precincted by
summer address.
2. Every subprecinct member
will be supplied with the phone
numbers or other subprecinct
members and of precinct
coordinators.
3. Participants will be
encouraged to attend training
sessions and meet with members
of their subprecinct before the
end of the quarter.
4. Participants will be supplied
with multiple copies of materials
on Indochina and political action.
B. At Home:
1. Students will gather with all
interested people, hopefully
extending beyond high school and
other college students to include
diverse members of the home
community.
2. The first objective will be to
disseminate information within
the sympathetic group.
3. This second objective could
be to organize actions, as
determined by the group. Possible
actions are,
a. Organizing discussion groups.
b. Canvassing local
neighborhoods.
c. Organizing talks before local
ionizations and public meetings.
. iMtain students and faculty of
Stanford and other universities
will be travelling this summer to
speak to such groups.)
d. Requesting teachers in the
local schools to carry on critical
discussions in their classrooms.
e. Urge eligible persons to join
anti-war groups, e.g. Business
Executives Move for Vietnam
Peace.
112. And of course, within the
Movement for a New Congress, to
work for political candidates.
(1. General Information:
1. This outline will be sent to
other universities who will be
encouraged to organize similar
local networks.
2. We will ask that all
universities be sent lists explaining
which universities are maintaining
action centers through the
summer. Students all over the
nation will then be able to link
into local colleges for additional
information and contacts.
We urge students to clip out
this article and send it to friends
at other colleges and universities.
Persuade them to begin similar
plans of presummer organizing at
their campus—ask them to have it
printed in the student newspapers.
Please hurry; time is short.

The YR Pledge
(This statement was issued by
the Executive Board of the
Stanford Young Republicans on
May 21.)
Editor, The Daily:
We, the newly elected officers
of the Stanford Young
Republicans, are committed to a
forward-looking and socially
responsible Republican Party. We
view our party association as a
tool for constructive action, not
as a millstone of regimentation.
We will sink or swim on the
conviction that successful party
action does not require mindless
obedience to a given political line.
Though representing a broad
range of political views, we are
united in our opposition to
demagoguery at either extreme.
We condemn spokesmen of all
persuasions who substitute
caricatures for the real people and
honest conflicts which make up
our political world.
The politics of people must
take priority over the politics of
division and violence. It can only
happen if enough of us are willing
to make it our conscious goal, and
to work through the channels
which give us the possibility of
success. We appeal to all persons
of good will to join us in building
a new Republican Party at
Stanford.

Alumni Dint vibe
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing to you as the
person who is most likely to be
aware of student reaction to the
proposed election of alumni to
the university board of trustees.
In addition to a law and order
diatribe by Mr. Levison, my latest
Stanford Alumni Association
Almanac contains the slate of
candidates I can vote for this
summer. It contains a token Black
(with moustache!), a token radical
(if Denis Hayes can be called
that), and a lot of well groomed
establishment types. In 1970.
David Harris comes
immediately to my mind as
someone who should be
nominated. That he couldn't be
present for two years doesn't
matter. In fact, his empty chair at
trustee meetings might help to
remind them where this country's
at. Maybe you have other people
in mind, who would be better.
The rules, presumably set up by
the alumni association, seemed
stacked against a nomination. I
could set up a table in Sproul
Plaza the rest of the quarter and
not get 500 valid signatures. But
Stanford's graduating class could
do it—if they planned ahead and
set up places for people to sign
after commencement.
If there is interest in doing this,

the onus is on this year's class and
other recent graduates. I'm afraid
my classmates of the "silent
fifties" are now the "silent
majority." But if others take the
lead, I'm willing to help.

Violent Revolution
Editor, THE DAILY:
Those who argue that we
should get rid of ROTC, or
eliminate DOD research support,
or grant amnesty to
disruption-policy violators, on the
grounds that doing so will remove
the cause of campus violence
should listen to what the
instigators of violence are saying.
They have told us quite plainly
that they will not stop once
ROTC is removed, or DOD
support is terminated, and they
have demonstrated on many
previous occasions that granting
amnesty only encourages further
incursions. They have made it
quite clear that they will not stop
short of bringing the entire
university to a complete halt.
If we wish to take action on the
ROTC question, then let us base it
on the merits of the ROTC
question. If we wish to judge
DOD support of research, then let
us do so on the merits of this
support. If we wish to absolve a
violator of blame let us do so for
those who are truly innocent of it.
But if we wish to stop the
violence on campus, then let us
stop the violence on campus. And
lot us not pretend that anything
other than stopping the violence
will stop it.
Some of my generation made
the mistake 35 years ago of
ignoring Hitler's proclaimed
intention of subjugating all
Europe. I hope your generation
does not similarly ignore the
declared intentions of the radical
leaders of violent revolution.
