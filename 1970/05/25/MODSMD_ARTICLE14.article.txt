# Vote For Dope
## Active Republican Primary Fights 
### Don Ayer 
Next weekend is an excellent
time to do something besides just
talk about government that is
corrupt, incompetent,
unresponsive, immoral, etc. A
week from tomorrow is the
California primary, and a long list
of important races are now in
their final stages.
The one which has stolen all
the publicity at Stanford, of
course, is the Brown-Tunney
contest for the Democratic
Senatorial nomination. Important
as it is, many students fail to
realize that there are local races
where 1) they personally can have
infinitely greater impact, and
where 2) the collective outcome
will have a good deal more effect
on the long-range tenor of
California politics.
We in the Bay Area, and
certainly at Stanford, have
relatively little to say about who
will go to the U.S. Senate. But we
must take a good deal more of the
credit or blame for who we send
to Congress or the State
Legislature.
It happens that in this area the
greatest election buttle for most
offices is in the Republican
Primary. In four local races, the
November winner will, by all
odds, be chosen next Tuesday by
the Republican voters. This means
that Stanford students, from
conservative to bourgeois radical,
are faced with a choice; they can
sit on their hands, or they can
make a rational decision to help
the best candidates win. The time
to act is running out.
A General Pattern
Most of these races conform to
a sort of pattern; a
moderate-to-liberal is running a
strong, but close race with one or
more challengers from the
conservative-to-reactionary branch
of the Party. In several cases, great
sums of money and all manner of
political influence are being
exerted on the side of the
rightists. And more often than
not, the preponderance of

volunteers is on the side of the
more moderate candidate. In
many ways, these races shape up
as a battle of the Old Politics and
the New.
Outstanding, of course, is the
San Mateo County Congressional
race between Pete McCloskey and
Forden Athern. McCloskey,
though only in his second term, is
already a leading figure in the
House. He is one of 9 Republican
members of the House Committee
For A Vote On The War, and has
been a moving force behind a
good deal of progressive
legislation.
Athern, the ichallenger, is a law
partner of retiring State Senator
Richard Dolwig. He has referred
to McCloskey as a radical, and has
generally pitches his campaign to
pluck away at the heartstrings of
Middle America. In terms of
voting patterns, it looks much like
the race of 1 968, with McCloskey
now facing a bald-headed Shirley
Temple. The problem is that
Athern, like Shirley, has plenty to
spend. For Pete's sake, and your
own, call 365-8844 and volunteer
your help.
State Senate Race
Speaking of Richard Dolwig,
the next important race is for the
State Senate seat which hs is
vacating in San Mateo County. An
incredible musical chairs act has
taken place relating to this seat
and the 26th Assembly seat which
falls within this district. The
line-up here is strictly Old Politics
versus New.
Carl A. "Ike" Britschgi, an
Assemblyman for 16 years, moved
up to run for the Senate when
Dolwig announced his retirement;
he felt it was his turn. His
opponent is the young
conservationist Mayor of Portola
Valley, Sam Halsted, who has
mobilized outdoors people of
both parties. In spite of the great
disparity of political connections,
experts give Halsted a good
chance of victory. Needless to say,
they need a lot of help this

weekend. Call 368-3959.
In making his move up to the
State Senate race, Britschgi has
vacated his old Assembly seat, and
a free-for-all has insued. Seven
candidates are in the running,
andthough it is hard to tell who is
outfront, two are of particular
interest to Stanford students.
Thank Arnett
Stanford administrator Dixon
Arnett is the man who we can
thank for driving neanderthal
Senator Dolwig back into his cave.
Last winter Arnett courageously
announced his intention to
challenge the apparently
well-intrenched Senator of several
terms. On the strength of this
challenge, and the subsequent
candidacy of Mayor Halsted,
Dolwig decided to quit while he
was ahead.
At this point, all hell broke
loose, with Britschgi vacating his
Assembly seat to take his
"rightful" place in the Senate, and
Arnett moving over to run for
Assembly seat. The next thing
anybody knew, a whole mob of
people had filed for the Assembly.
Besides Arnett (who's
headquarter's can be reached at
369-1721), the other candidate of
interest here is 22 year-old
ex-Stanford student and
Hillsborough socialite, Bill Boyd.
Boyd, a 1969 graduate, served as

president of the Stanford Young
Republicans, and accomplished
the unprecedented feat of
alienating the entire conservative
community (not to mention the
moderates, liberals, etc.) From
Harvey Hukari to the officers of
the Stanford YH's the verdict is
unanimous: he is without
integrity.
Law and Order
Running as a flag-waving,
law-a nd-order conservative,
talking about communist agents
and law breakers though he has
offered to sell or give drugs to at
least two Stanford students, Boyd
must represent most that is wrong
with the American political
system.
Indeed, he would not be worth
talking about if it were not for
one fact; his father is loaded to the
gills and is spending money like
water. No one really knows what
the odds are here, but the very
possibility of his election has
stimulated his former associates in
the Young Republicans to send
out truth squads to local papers.
If you get your kicks out of
defeating people, here's your man.
Finally, there is the Assembly
seat in the 22nd, our own district,
which has not gone Democratic as
long as anyone I know can
remember. Here, the choice of
involved Stanford students is 32

year-old moderate Ben
Reichmuth, who faces a field of 5
other candidates.
Reichmuth, a strong
conservationist with a long history
of community service, is perhaps
most distinguished by his ability
to run a political campaign
without falling into the abyss of
empty rhetoric and vacant
political jargon. At a meeting with
Stanford students, he admitted as
how his dislike of pontifical
speech-making might prove a
liability; its up to us to see that it
doesn't. (Palo Alto Headquarters:
193-3400) Ben's main opponent is
Dick Hayden, a conservative of
the old school. It should be fairly
close.
So locally speaking, in terms of
primary battles, that's the lineup.
If you're not yet convinced that
the situation merits your
attention, cheek out today's local
papers and look at the nature and
volume of the crap being pumped
out by some of our better
financed if less scrupled
candidates. Then pick up the
telephone and give one of their
opponents a call. Tell them you
want to help this week-end. Don't
wait. Do It Now.

to act is running out.
A General Pattern
Most of these races conform to
a sort of pattern; a
moderate-to-liberal is running a
strong, but close race with one or
more challengers from the
conservative-to-reactionary branch
of the Party. In several cases, great
sums of money and all manner of
political influence are being
exerted on the side of the
rightists. And more often than
not, the preponderance of

volunteers is on the side of the
more moderate candidate. In
many ways, these races shape up
as a battle of the Old Politics and
the New.
Outstanding, of course, is the
San Mateo County Congressional
race between Pete McCloskey and
Forden Athern. McCloskey,
though only in his second term, is
already a leading figure in the
House. He is one of 9 Republican
members of the House Committee
For A Vote On The War, and has
been a moving force behind a
good deal of progressive
legislation.
Athern, the ichallenger, is a law
partner of retiring State Senator
Richard Dolwig. He has referred
to McCloskey as a radical, and has
generally pitches his campaign to
pluck away at the heartstrings of
Middle America. In terms of
voting patterns, it looks much like
the race of 1 968, with McCloskey
now facing a bald-headed Shirley
Temple. The problem is that
Athern, like Shirley, has plenty to
spend. For Pete's sake, and your
own, call 365-8844 and volunteer
your help.
State Senate Race
Speaking of Richard Dolwig,
the next important race is for the
State Senate seat which hs is
vacating in San Mateo County. An
incredible musical chairs act has
taken place relating to this seat
and the 26th Assembly seat which
falls within this district. The
line-up here is strictly Old Politics
versus New.
Carl A. "Ike" Britschgi, an
Assemblyman for 16 years, moved
up to run for the Senate when
Dolwig announced his retirement;
he felt it was his turn. His
opponent is the young
conservationist Mayor of Portola
Valley, Sam Halsted, who has
mobilized outdoors people of
both parties. In spite of the great
disparity of political connections,
experts give Halsted a good
chance of victory. Needless to say,
they need a lot of help this

weekend. Call 368-3959.
In making his move up to the
State Senate race, Britschgi has
vacated his old Assembly seat, and
a free-for-all has insued. Seven
candidates are in the running,
andthough it is hard to tell who is
outfront, two are of particular
interest to Stanford students.
Thank Arnett
Stanford administrator Dixon
Arnett is the man who we can
thank for driving neanderthal
Senator Dolwig back into his cave.
Last winter Arnett courageously
announced his intention to
challenge the apparently
well-intrenched Senator of several
terms. On the strength of this
challenge, and the subsequent
candidacy of Mayor Halsted,
Dolwig decided to quit while he
was ahead.
At this point, all hell broke
loose, with Britschgi vacating his
Assembly seat to take his
"rightful" place in the Senate, and
Arnett moving over to run for
Assembly seat. The next thing
anybody knew, a whole mob of
people had filed for the Assembly.
Besides Arnett (who's
headquarter's can be reached at
369-1721), the other candidate of
interest here is 22 year-old
ex-Stanford student and
Hillsborough socialite, Bill Boyd.
Boyd, a 1969 graduate, served as

president of the Stanford Young
Republicans, and accomplished
the unprecedented feat of
alienating the entire conservative
community (not to mention the
moderates, liberals, etc.) From
Harvey Hukari to the officers of
the Stanford YH's the verdict is
unanimous: he is without
integrity.
Law and Order
Running as a flag-waving,
law-a nd-order conservative,
talking about communist agents
and law breakers though he has
offered to sell or give drugs to at
least two Stanford students, Boyd
must represent most that is wrong
with the American political
system.
Indeed, he would not be worth
talking about if it were not for
one fact; his father is loaded to the
gills and is spending money like
water. No one really knows what
the odds are here, but the very
possibility of his election has
stimulated his former associates in
the Young Republicans to send
out truth squads to local papers.
If you get your kicks out of
defeating people, here's your man.
Finally, there is the Assembly
seat in the 22nd, our own district,
which has not gone Democratic as
long as anyone I know can
remember. Here, the choice of
involved Stanford students is 32

year-old moderate Ben
Reichmuth, who faces a field of 5
other candidates.
Reichmuth, a strong
conservationist with a long history
of community service, is perhaps
most distinguished by his ability
to run a political campaign
without falling into the abyss of
empty rhetoric and vacant
political jargon. At a meeting with
Stanford students, he admitted as
how his dislike of pontifical
speech-making might prove a
liability; its up to us to see that it
doesn't. (Palo Alto Headquarters:
193-3400) Ben's main opponent is
Dick Hayden, a conservative of
the old school. It should be fairly
close.
So locally speaking, in terms of
primary battles, that's the lineup.
If you're not yet convinced that
the situation merits your
attention, cheek out today's local
papers and look at the nature and
volume of the crap being pumped
out by some of our better
financed if less scrupled
candidates. Then pick up the
telephone and give one of their
opponents a call. Tell them you
want to help this week-end. Don't
wait. Do It Now.
(Don Ayer is a junior in history
and president of the YR's. He is
speaking individually in this
column.)
Next weekend is an excellent
time to do something besides just
talk about government that is
corrupt, incompetent,
unresponsive, immoral, etc. A
week from tomorrow is the
California primary, and a long list
of important races are now in
their final stages.
The one which has stolen all
the publicity at Stanford, of
course, is the Brown-Tunney
contest for the Democratic
Senatorial nomination. Important
as it is, many students fail to
realize that there are local races
where 1) they personally can have
infinitely greater impact, and
where 2) the collective outcome
will have a good deal more effect
on the long-range tenor of
California politics.
We in the Bay Area, and
certainly at Stanford, have
relatively little to say about who
will go to the U.S. Senate. But we
must take a good deal more of the
credit or blame for who we send
to Congress or the State
Legislature.
It happens that in this area the
greatest election buttle for most
offices is in the Republican
Primary. In four local races, the
November winner will, by all
odds, be chosen next Tuesday by
the Republican voters. This means
that Stanford students, from
conservative to bourgeois radical,
are faced with a choice; they can
sit on their hands, or they can
make a rational decision to help
the best candidates win. The time
to act is running out.

Temple. The problem is that
Athern, like Shirley, has plenty to
spend. For Pete's sake, and your
own, call 365-8844 and volunteer
your help.
State Senate Race
Speaking of Richard Dolwig,
the next important race is for the
State Senate seat which hs is
vacating in San Mateo County. An
incredible musical chairs act has
taken place relating to this seat
and the 26th Assembly seat which
falls within this district. The
line-up here is strictly Old Politics
versus New.
Carl A. "Ike" Britschgi, an
Assemblyman for 16 years, moved
up to run for the Senate when
Dolwig announced his retirement;
he felt it was his turn. His
opponent is the young
conservationist Mayor of Portola
Valley, Sam Halsted, who has
mobilized outdoors people of
both parties. In spite of the great
disparity of political connections,
experts give Halsted a good
chance of victory. Needless to say,
they need a lot of help this

weekend. Call 368-3959.
In making his move up to the
State Senate race, Britschgi has
vacated his old Assembly seat, and
a free-for-all has insued. Seven
candidates are in the running,
andthough it is hard to tell who is
outfront, two are of particular
interest to Stanford students.
Thank Arnett
Stanford administrator Dixon
Arnett is the man who we can
thank for driving neanderthal
Senator Dolwig back into his cave.
Last winter Arnett courageously
announced his intention to
challenge the apparently
well-intrenched Senator of several
terms. On the strength of this
challenge, and the subsequent
candidacy of Mayor Halsted,
Dolwig decided to quit while he
was ahead.
At this point, all hell broke
loose, with Britschgi vacating his
Assembly seat to take his
"rightful" place in the Senate, and
Arnett moving over to run for
Assembly seat. The next thing
anybody knew, a whole mob of
people had filed for the Assembly.
Besides Arnett (who's
headquarter's can be reached at
369-1721), the other candidate of
interest here is 22 year-old
ex-Stanford student and
Hillsborough socialite, Bill Boyd.
Boyd, a 1969 graduate, served as

president of the Stanford Young
Republicans, and accomplished
the unprecedented feat of
alienating the entire conservative
community (not to mention the
moderates, liberals, etc.) From
Harvey Hukari to the officers of
the Stanford YH's the verdict is
unanimous: he is without
integrity.
Law and Order
Running as a flag-waving,
law-a nd-order conservative,
talking about communist agents
and law breakers though he has
offered to sell or give drugs to at
least two Stanford students, Boyd
must represent most that is wrong
with the American political
system.
Indeed, he would not be worth
talking about if it were not for
one fact; his father is loaded to the
gills and is spending money like
water. No one really knows what
the odds are here, but the very
possibility of his election has
stimulated his former associates in
the Young Republicans to send
out truth squads to local papers.
If you get your kicks out of
defeating people, here's your man.
Finally, there is the Assembly
seat in the 22nd, our own district,
which has not gone Democratic as
long as anyone I know can
remember. Here, the choice of
involved Stanford students is 32

year-old moderate Ben
Reichmuth, who faces a field of 5
other candidates.
Reichmuth, a strong
conservationist with a long history
of community service, is perhaps
most distinguished by his ability
to run a political campaign
without falling into the abyss of
empty rhetoric and vacant
political jargon. At a meeting with
Stanford students, he admitted as
how his dislike of pontifical
speech-making might prove a
liability; its up to us to see that it
doesn't. (Palo Alto Headquarters:
193-3400) Ben's main opponent is
Dick Hayden, a conservative of
the old school. It should be fairly
close.
So locally speaking, in terms of
primary battles, that's the lineup.
If you're not yet convinced that
the situation merits your
attention, cheek out today's local
papers and look at the nature and
volume of the crap being pumped
out by some of our better
financed if less scrupled
candidates. Then pick up the
telephone and give one of their
opponents a call. Tell them you
want to help this week-end. Don't
wait. Do It Now.
(Don Ayer is a junior in history
and president of the YR's. He is
speaking individually in this
column.)
Next weekend is an excellent
time to do something besides just
talk about government that is
corrupt, incompetent,
unresponsive, immoral, etc. A
week from tomorrow is the
California primary, and a long list
of important races are now in
their final stages.
The one which has stolen all
the publicity at Stanford, of
course, is the Brown-Tunney
contest for the Democratic
Senatorial nomination. Important
as it is, many students fail to
realize that there are local races
where 1) they personally can have
infinitely greater impact, and
where 2) the collective outcome
will have a good deal more effect
on the long-range tenor of
California politics.
We in the Bay Area, and
certainly at Stanford, have
relatively little to say about who
will go to the U.S. Senate. But we
must take a good deal more of the
credit or blame for who we send
to Congress or the State
Legislature.
It happens that in this area the
greatest election buttle for most
offices is in the Republican
Primary. In four local races, the
November winner will, by all
odds, be chosen next Tuesday by
the Republican voters. This means
that Stanford students, from
conservative to bourgeois radical,
are faced with a choice; they can
sit on their hands, or they can
make a rational decision to help
the best candidates win. The time
to act is running out.
A General Pattern
Most of these races conform to
a sort of pattern; a
moderate-to-liberal is running a
strong, but close race with one or
more challengers from the
conservative-to-reactionary branch
of the Party. In several cases, great
sums of money and all manner of
political influence are being
exerted on the side of the
rightists. And more often than
not, the preponderance of

volunteers is on the side of the
more moderate candidate. In
many ways, these races shape up
as a battle of the Old Politics and
the New.
Outstanding, of course, is the
San Mateo County Congressional
race between Pete McCloskey and
Forden Athern. McCloskey,
though only in his second term, is
already a leading figure in the
House. He is one of 9 Republican
members of the House Committee
For A Vote On The War, and has
been a moving force behind a
good deal of progressive
legislation.
Athern, the ichallenger, is a law
partner of retiring State Senator
Richard Dolwig. He has referred
to McCloskey as a radical, and has
generally pitches his campaign to
pluck away at the heartstrings of
Middle America. In terms of
voting patterns, it looks much like
the race of 1 968, with McCloskey
now facing a bald-headed Shirley
Temple. The problem is that
Athern, like Shirley, has plenty to
spend. For Pete's sake, and your

outfront, two are of particular
interest to Stanford students.
Thank Arnett
Stanford administrator Dixon
Arnett is the man who we can
thank for driving neanderthal
Senator Dolwig back into his cave.
Last winter Arnett courageously
announced his intention to
challenge the apparently
well-intrenched Senator of several
terms. On the strength of this
challenge, and the subsequent
candidacy of Mayor Halsted,
Dolwig decided to quit while he
was ahead.
At this point, all hell broke
loose, with Britschgi vacating his
Assembly seat to take his
"rightful" place in the Senate, and
Arnett moving over to run for
Assembly seat. The next thing
anybody knew, a whole mob of
people had filed for the Assembly.
Besides Arnett (who's
headquarter's can be reached at
369-1721), the other candidate of
interest here is 22 year-old
ex-Stanford student and
Hillsborough socialite, Bill Boyd.
Boyd, a 1969 graduate, served as

president of the Stanford Young
Republicans, and accomplished
the unprecedented feat of
alienating the entire conservative
community (not to mention the
moderates, liberals, etc.) From
Harvey Hukari to the officers of
the Stanford YH's the verdict is
unanimous: he is without
integrity.
Law and Order
Running as a flag-waving,
law-a nd-order conservative,
talking about communist agents
and law breakers though he has
offered to sell or give drugs to at
least two Stanford students, Boyd
must represent most that is wrong
with the American political
system.
Indeed, he would not be worth
talking about if it were not for
one fact; his father is loaded to the
gills and is spending money like
water. No one really knows what
the odds are here, but the very
possibility of his election has
stimulated his former associates in
the Young Republicans to send
out truth squads to local papers.
If you get your kicks out of
defeating people, here's your man.
Finally, there is the Assembly
seat in the 22nd, our own district,
which has not gone Democratic as
long as anyone I know can
remember. Here, the choice of
involved Stanford students is 32

year-old moderate Ben
Reichmuth, who faces a field of 5
other candidates.
Reichmuth, a strong
conservationist with a long history
of community service, is perhaps
most distinguished by his ability
to run a political campaign
without falling into the abyss of
empty rhetoric and vacant
political jargon. At a meeting with
Stanford students, he admitted as
how his dislike of pontifical
speech-making might prove a
liability; its up to us to see that it
doesn't. (Palo Alto Headquarters:
193-3400) Ben's main opponent is
Dick Hayden, a conservative of
the old school. It should be fairly
close.
So locally speaking, in terms of
primary battles, that's the lineup.
If you're not yet convinced that
the situation merits your
attention, cheek out today's local
papers and look at the nature and
volume of the crap being pumped
out by some of our better
financed if less scrupled
candidates. Then pick up the
telephone and give one of their
opponents a call. Tell them you
want to help this week-end. Don't
wait. Do It Now.
(Don Ayer is a junior in history
and president of the YR's. He is
speaking individually in this
column.)
