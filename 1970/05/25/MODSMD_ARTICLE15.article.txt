# L.A. Help Needed
## Organize The Grape Boycott 
### Mike Wallerstein 
Hopefully, some of the
students who are now doing
community work with such
enthusiasm will realize that
community work doesn't stop
when school ends and will start
planning for continuing work
throughout the summer. The
United Farm Workers, led by
Cesar Chavez, in its struggle to

unionize the tarm workers needs
students to help organize the
grape boycott in Los Angeles.
Since I am not sure everybody
understands what is happening
with the Delano grape strike, 1
will go into a brief history.
The migratory farm workers
have always comprised one of the
most impoverished, most
oppressed, and least organized
sectors of the working class in this
country. California agriculture,
composed mostly of large
semi-automatic farms which need
large numbers of hand laborers for
only brief periods during the year,
has come to depend on migratory
workers to a greater extend that
anywhere else in the country.
These workers have been
conveniently supplied by a
succession of immigrant
waves—Chinese, Japanese,
Mexicans, Hindustanis, Filipino
sometimes alternating with waves
of national unemployed driven
down into the agricultural labor
market by depression and
drought.
Poverty Conditions
Migratory workers, living in
constant poverty, have not
accepted their working conditions
without a fight. Attempts to
organize have consistently met
with immediate repression,
resulting in many violent, often
bloody confrontations such as the
Wheatland hop fields in 1913 and
in the avalanche of strikes
following the harvests in the
1930's with striking farm workers
being shot down. However, the
strength of the farm workers
could not win against the
combined strength of the growers
and the state, especially since
there were always other groups of
people that could be brought in to
take the place of any
troublemakers. From World War
II until 1965, the Bracero
program which imported
Mexicans laborers, supposedly
only if there were insufficient
numbers of nationals for the
harvest, in reality formed the hard
core of the labor force, keeping
wages and living conditions at a
minimum and preventing any
effective organizing among the
workers.
Today, migratory workers are
still subject to a lack of steady
employment, substandard wages,
substandard living conditions,
with the addition of the new
threats of increasing automation
in the fields and the massive use
of pesticides with the result of
widespread cases of poisoning
among the workers, especially
among the children, often leading
to permanent damage and even
death. Farm workers are still
excluded from all labor laws, the
new deal, the NLRB, even
minimum wage. It is clear that
help and protection is not going
to come from outside but only
from a strong union that can force
the growers to grant such
consession as basic living
conditions and a regulation of the
use of pesticides.
Strike
The present strike of the grape
workers under the name UFWOC,
United Farm Workers Organizing
Committee, organized by Cesar
Chavez began in 1965. Although
the Bracero program had been
ended, it had just been substituted
with the green-card program

which still enabled the growers to
ship in workers from Mexico to
break the strike, in spite of the
fact that to do so is illegal. Left
with no choice, UFWOC began a
nationwide boycott. The first
targets were the wineries, all of
whom signed contracts with the
union. The UFWOC then turned
to the table grape growers which
were larger and used more
workers. Iq 1967, UFWOC
initiated the boycott of Guimarra
Grapes from the Guimarra Corp.,
the world's largest grape grower
and in 1968 the boycott was
expanded to include all table
grapes.
The Defense Dept. stepped in
to help the growers. Between
1967 and 1968 the DOD tripled
private shipments to South
Vietnam making the people of
Vietnam, not American soldiers
the third largest importer of
grapes in the world. And then
doubling the total number of
grapes bought in 1969. However,
the DOD buys less than 5% of the
total number of grapes on the
market and the boycott
throughout most of the country
was a success. This winter the
union signed a contract with five
growers from Coachella Valley.
This means that this summer there
will be union grapes on the
market.
California Failures
The area where the grape
boycott has been least successful
is California, especially Los
Angeles, which provides a close
market in which the growers can
get rid of their excess grapes, now
at much lower prices. L.A. is now
the largest buyer of grapes in the
country. Since, in the estimate of
the union, the boycott can not be
made more effective in the East,
they have decided to concentrate
on L.A. this summer. To make the
boycott effective, people are
needed. People who will work full
time organizing picket lines,
leafleting, getting support in the
community, or whatever is
needed. Cesar Chavez has said that
he wants 100 full time organizers
who will each be responsible for
all operations in a section of the
city. This is what students can do.
The union has very little money
and can not pay any wages but it
will provide a place to stay and
meals.
The grape boycott is
continuing. Only buy union
grapes; 1. to help the farm
workers in their struggle, 2.
because the union contract
contains regulations on pesticides
so that union grapes will be safer
to eat. If you don't know whether
the grapes in a store are union or
not, demand to see the box they
came in. There is a union label
which says UFWOC, AFL-CIO on
all boxes of union grapes.
Meeting to Help
There will be a meeting for all
people interested in working as an
organizer in L.A. this summer in
Tresidder at 4:15 on Tuesday. If
we win, against the grape growers
we will go to other growers. For
the first time in California there is
the possibility of the migratory
I arm workers organizing
themselves into a strong union
which is capable of fighting the
growers and winning an
acceptable standard of living.

most impoverished, most
oppressed, and least organized
sectors of the working class in this
country. California agriculture,
composed mostly of large
semi-automatic farms which need
large numbers of hand laborers for
only brief periods during the year,
has come to depend on migratory
workers to a greater extend that
anywhere else in the country.
These workers have been
conveniently supplied by a
succession of immigrant
waves—Chinese, Japanese,
Mexicans, Hindustanis, Filipino
sometimes alternating with waves
of national unemployed driven
down into the agricultural labor
market by depression and
drought.
Poverty Conditions
Migratory workers, living in
constant poverty, have not
accepted their working conditions
without a fight. Attempts to
organize have consistently met
with immediate repression,
resulting in many violent, often
bloody confrontations such as the
Wheatland hop fields in 1913 and
in the avalanche of strikes
following the harvests in the
1930's with striking farm workers
being shot down. However, the
strength of the farm workers
could not win against the
combined strength of the growers
and the state, especially since
there were always other groups of
people that could be brought in to
take the place of any
troublemakers. From World War
II until 1965, the Bracero
program which imported
Mexicans laborers, supposedly
only if there were insufficient
numbers of nationals for the
harvest, in reality formed the hard
core of the labor force, keeping
wages and living conditions at a
minimum and preventing any
effective organizing among the
workers.
Today, migratory workers are
still subject to a lack of steady
employment, substandard wages,
substandard living conditions,
with the addition of the new
threats of increasing automation
in the fields and the massive use
of pesticides with the result of
widespread cases of poisoning
among the workers, especially
among the children, often leading
to permanent damage and even
death. Farm workers are still
excluded from all labor laws, the
new deal, the NLRB, even
minimum wage. It is clear that
help and protection is not going
to come from outside but only
from a strong union that can force
the growers to grant such
consession as basic living
conditions and a regulation of the
use of pesticides.
Strike
The present strike of the grape
workers under the name UFWOC,
United Farm Workers Organizing
Committee, organized by Cesar
Chavez began in 1965. Although
the Bracero program had been
ended, it had just been substituted
with the green-card program

which still enabled the growers to
ship in workers from Mexico to
break the strike, in spite of the
fact that to do so is illegal. Left
with no choice, UFWOC began a
nationwide boycott. The first
targets were the wineries, all of
whom signed contracts with the
union. The UFWOC then turned
to the table grape growers which
were larger and used more
workers. Iq 1967, UFWOC
initiated the boycott of Guimarra
Grapes from the Guimarra Corp.,
the world's largest grape grower
and in 1968 the boycott was
expanded to include all table
grapes.
The Defense Dept. stepped in
to help the growers. Between
1967 and 1968 the DOD tripled
private shipments to South
Vietnam making the people of
Vietnam, not American soldiers
the third largest importer of
grapes in the world. And then
doubling the total number of
grapes bought in 1969. However,
the DOD buys less than 5% of the
total number of grapes on the
market and the boycott
throughout most of the country
was a success. This winter the
union signed a contract with five
growers from Coachella Valley.
This means that this summer there
will be union grapes on the
market.
California Failures
The area where the grape
boycott has been least successful
is California, especially Los
Angeles, which provides a close
market in which the growers can
get rid of their excess grapes, now
at much lower prices. L.A. is now
the largest buyer of grapes in the
country. Since, in the estimate of
the union, the boycott can not be
made more effective in the East,
they have decided to concentrate
on L.A. this summer. To make the
boycott effective, people are
needed. People who will work full
time organizing picket lines,
leafleting, getting support in the
community, or whatever is
needed. Cesar Chavez has said that
he wants 100 full time organizers
who will each be responsible for
all operations in a section of the
city. This is what students can do.
The union has very little money
and can not pay any wages but it
will provide a place to stay and
meals.
The grape boycott is
continuing. Only buy union
grapes; 1. to help the farm
workers in their struggle, 2.
because the union contract
contains regulations on pesticides
so that union grapes will be safer
to eat. If you don't know whether
the grapes in a store are union or
not, demand to see the box they
came in. There is a union label
which says UFWOC, AFL-CIO on
all boxes of union grapes.
Meeting to Help
There will be a meeting for all
people interested in working as an
organizer in L.A. this summer in
Tresidder at 4:15 on Tuesday. If
we win, against the grape growers
we will go to other growers. For
the first time in California there is
the possibility of the migratory
I arm workers organizing
themselves into a strong union
which is capable of fighting the
growers and winning an
acceptable standard of living.
(Mike Wallerstein is a freshman
living at Beta Chi.)
Hopefully, some of the
students who are now doing
community work with such
enthusiasm will realize that
community work doesn't stop
when school ends and will start
planning for continuing work
throughout the summer. The
United Farm Workers, led by
Cesar Chavez, in its struggle to

unionize the tarm workers needs
students to help organize the
grape boycott in Los Angeles.
Since I am not sure everybody
understands what is happening
with the Delano grape strike, 1
will go into a brief history.

Migratory workers, living in
constant poverty, have not
accepted their working conditions
without a fight. Attempts to
organize have consistently met
with immediate repression,
resulting in many violent, often
bloody confrontations such as the
Wheatland hop fields in 1913 and
in the avalanche of strikes
following the harvests in the
1930's with striking farm workers
being shot down. However, the
strength of the farm workers
could not win against the
combined strength of the growers
and the state, especially since
there were always other groups of
people that could be brought in to
take the place of any
troublemakers. From World War
II until 1965, the Bracero
program which imported
Mexicans laborers, supposedly
only if there were insufficient
numbers of nationals for the
harvest, in reality formed the hard
core of the labor force, keeping
wages and living conditions at a
minimum and preventing any
effective organizing among the
workers.
Today, migratory workers are
still subject to a lack of steady
employment, substandard wages,
substandard living conditions,
with the addition of the new
threats of increasing automation
in the fields and the massive use
of pesticides with the result of
widespread cases of poisoning
among the workers, especially
among the children, often leading
to permanent damage and even
death. Farm workers are still
excluded from all labor laws, the
new deal, the NLRB, even
minimum wage. It is clear that
help and protection is not going
to come from outside but only
from a strong union that can force
the growers to grant such
consession as basic living
conditions and a regulation of the
use of pesticides.
Strike
The present strike of the grape
workers under the name UFWOC,
United Farm Workers Organizing
Committee, organized by Cesar
Chavez began in 1965. Although
the Bracero program had been
ended, it had just been substituted
with the green-card program

which still enabled the growers to
ship in workers from Mexico to
break the strike, in spite of the
fact that to do so is illegal. Left
with no choice, UFWOC began a
nationwide boycott. The first
targets were the wineries, all of
whom signed contracts with the
union. The UFWOC then turned
to the table grape growers which
were larger and used more
workers. Iq 1967, UFWOC
initiated the boycott of Guimarra
Grapes from the Guimarra Corp.,
the world's largest grape grower
and in 1968 the boycott was
expanded to include all table
grapes.
The Defense Dept. stepped in
to help the growers. Between
1967 and 1968 the DOD tripled
private shipments to South
Vietnam making the people of
Vietnam, not American soldiers
the third largest importer of
grapes in the world. And then
doubling the total number of
grapes bought in 1969. However,
the DOD buys less than 5% of the
total number of grapes on the
market and the boycott
throughout most of the country
was a success. This winter the
union signed a contract with five
growers from Coachella Valley.
This means that this summer there
will be union grapes on the
market.
California Failures
The area where the grape
boycott has been least successful
is California, especially Los
Angeles, which provides a close
market in which the growers can
get rid of their excess grapes, now
at much lower prices. L.A. is now
the largest buyer of grapes in the
country. Since, in the estimate of
the union, the boycott can not be
made more effective in the East,
they have decided to concentrate
on L.A. this summer. To make the
boycott effective, people are
needed. People who will work full
time organizing picket lines,
leafleting, getting support in the
community, or whatever is
needed. Cesar Chavez has said that
he wants 100 full time organizers
who will each be responsible for
all operations in a section of the
city. This is what students can do.
The union has very little money
and can not pay any wages but it
will provide a place to stay and
meals.
The grape boycott is
continuing. Only buy union
grapes; 1. to help the farm
workers in their struggle, 2.
because the union contract
contains regulations on pesticides
so that union grapes will be safer
to eat. If you don't know whether
the grapes in a store are union or
not, demand to see the box they
came in. There is a union label
which says UFWOC, AFL-CIO on
all boxes of union grapes.
Meeting to Help
There will be a meeting for all
people interested in working as an
organizer in L.A. this summer in
Tresidder at 4:15 on Tuesday. If
we win, against the grape growers
we will go to other growers. For
the first time in California there is
the possibility of the migratory
I arm workers organizing
themselves into a strong union
which is capable of fighting the
growers and winning an
acceptable standard of living.
(Mike Wallerstein is a freshman
living at Beta Chi.)
Hopefully, some of the
students who are now doing
community work with such
enthusiasm will realize that
community work doesn't stop
when school ends and will start
planning for continuing work
throughout the summer. The
United Farm Workers, led by
Cesar Chavez, in its struggle to

unionize the tarm workers needs
students to help organize the
grape boycott in Los Angeles.
Since I am not sure everybody
understands what is happening
with the Delano grape strike, 1
will go into a brief history.
The migratory farm workers
have always comprised one of the
most impoverished, most
oppressed, and least organized
sectors of the working class in this
country. California agriculture,
composed mostly of large
semi-automatic farms which need
large numbers of hand laborers for
only brief periods during the year,
has come to depend on migratory
workers to a greater extend that
anywhere else in the country.
These workers have been
conveniently supplied by a
succession of immigrant
waves—Chinese, Japanese,
Mexicans, Hindustanis, Filipino
sometimes alternating with waves
of national unemployed driven
down into the agricultural labor
market by depression and
drought.
