# With Social Bite
## Art--To Find Direction 
### BONNIE KOEHLER 
A look at the collection of
I' intings and prints at the
• ) uiford Gallery may change your
mind about what art is exactly.
Y u may not like what you see,
but you will come out of the
< hi hit enlightened as to what
three Stanford M.A. students
think about themselves and what
they can say through visual
techniques.
The works shown are by
Howard Foote, Gilbert Precivale,
id Elizabeth Worley Stolurow.
The spring exhibit marks the
culmination of their two years
stidy in the M.A. program of
studio art. All the works shown
were produced during these two
years.
Original acceptance to the
program means that the students
have already developed a strong
personal expression. The two
years allows them to explore
f'uther in this direction with
minimum guidance from faculty.
The Gallery show contains six
large oils, two mixed media, and
pen-and-ink drawings by
I lolurow; fifteen black and white
lithographs by Foote; and a huge
acrylic on canvas, live plexiglass
and acrylics, and numerous small
■idlings, colored pencil on paper,
and acrylic on paper by Precivale.
There is no sculpture in the show.
Foote Prints
The Foote prints have the
I oadest appeal in the show and
ar th( most pleasing to this
reviewer. Thirteen of the fifteen
I int an from the unfinished
suite entitled "For Every Man and
his Chimera," suggested to the
artist by a work of prose by
Baudelaire

One of the lithos, "Joint
Chief," was recently reprinted in
Kumpurts magazine. This speaks
of the keen sense of social and
political comment contained in
his work, coupled with a strong
psychological bite. His 'fine arts'
approach to satire makes his
prints loaded visually as well as in
content and theme.
But despite the timeliness of his
statements, the artist manages to
retain a refinement which reminds
one of the lasting traditions of
Goya, Daumier, and Picasso.
"Post Ueb" and "In By Nine Out
By hire" are particularly
intriguing in their grotesque
imagery.
Social Comment
A social comment of a different
nature is contained in the acrylic
on plexiglass pieces and the large
mural-like acrylic on canvas of
Gilbert Precivale. In their
machine-precision hard-edge,
smooth-surface, and boldly
contrasting plastic colors, the
works set a mood of coldness.
The relatively new medium of
acrylic applied to the back of
clear plexiglass produces a
simultaneous illusion of depth and
flatness which heightens the
impact of the content. The human
figure is absent in the above works
but reappears in manipulated
symbolic form in his series of
twenty small etchings.
Flowing and Sensual
The oil paintings of Elizabeth
Stolurow form a contrast in
surface use of color, and imagery.
The surfaces are thick with built
up paint that looks as if it were
still wet, and suggests that the
artist enjoys the texture of the
medium. The shapes are flowing

and sensual in a self-conscious
way, implying a spontaneity of
thought but not of technique. The
works show an intrigue with
intricate pattern combined with a
preoccupation with sexual
imagery, and the reoccurring
figure of a German Shepherd dog.
The canvasses are of traditional
shape but very large. All these
features combine to
simultaneously pull the viewer
into the paintings and to turn him
away.
The paintings and prints by the
three artists represent exploration
in three very different directions.
If you don't know much about art
and you don't know what you
like, visit the Stanford Gallery
before June 14th. You will
emerge with a renewed
appreciation for Mom, apple pie,
and Andrew Wyeth, or a new
understanding of exploratory art.

impact of the content. The human
figure is absent in the above works
but reappears in manipulated
symbolic form in his series of
twenty small etchings.
Flowing and Sensual
The oil paintings of Elizabeth
Stolurow form a contrast in
surface use of color, and imagery.
The surfaces are thick with built
up paint that looks as if it were
still wet, and suggests that the
artist enjoys the texture of the
medium. The shapes are flowing

and sensual in a self-conscious
way, implying a spontaneity of
thought but not of technique. The
works show an intrigue with
intricate pattern combined with a
preoccupation with sexual
imagery, and the reoccurring
figure of a German Shepherd dog.
The canvasses are of traditional
shape but very large. All these
features combine to
simultaneously pull the viewer
into the paintings and to turn him
away.
The paintings and prints by the
three artists represent exploration
in three very different directions.
If you don't know much about art
and you don't know what you
like, visit the Stanford Gallery
before June 14th. You will
emerge with a renewed
appreciation for Mom, apple pie,
and Andrew Wyeth, or a new
understanding of exploratory art.

"DREAM OF BANDIT 1968" is one
of inaiiy prints and paintings l>y 3
Stanford grad students in studio art,
now at die Gallery.
A look at the collection of
I' intings and prints at the
• ) uiford Gallery may change your
mind about what art is exactly.
Y u may not like what you see,
but you will come out of the
< hi hit enlightened as to what
three Stanford M.A. students
think about themselves and what
they can say through visual
techniques.
The works shown are by
Howard Foote, Gilbert Precivale,
id Elizabeth Worley Stolurow.
The spring exhibit marks the
culmination of their two years
stidy in the M.A. program of
studio art. All the works shown
were produced during these two
years.
Original acceptance to the
program means that the students
have already developed a strong
personal expression. The two
years allows them to explore
f'uther in this direction with
minimum guidance from faculty.
The Gallery show contains six
large oils, two mixed media, and
pen-and-ink drawings by
I lolurow; fifteen black and white
lithographs by Foote; and a huge
acrylic on canvas, live plexiglass
and acrylics, and numerous small
■idlings, colored pencil on paper,
and acrylic on paper by Precivale.
There is no sculpture in the show.
Foote Prints
The Foote prints have the
I oadest appeal in the show and
ar th( most pleasing to this
reviewer. Thirteen of the fifteen
I int an from the unfinished
suite entitled "For Every Man and
his Chimera," suggested to the
artist by a work of prose by
Baudelaire

One of the lithos, "Joint
Chief," was recently reprinted in
Kumpurts magazine. This speaks
of the keen sense of social and
political comment contained in
his work, coupled with a strong
psychological bite. His 'fine arts'
approach to satire makes his
prints loaded visually as well as in
content and theme.
But despite the timeliness of his
statements, the artist manages to
retain a refinement which reminds
one of the lasting traditions of
Goya, Daumier, and Picasso.
"Post Ueb" and "In By Nine Out
By hire" are particularly
intriguing in their grotesque
imagery.
Social Comment
A social comment of a different
nature is contained in the acrylic
on plexiglass pieces and the large
mural-like acrylic on canvas of
Gilbert Precivale. In their
machine-precision hard-edge,
smooth-surface, and boldly
contrasting plastic colors, the
works set a mood of coldness.
The relatively new medium of
acrylic applied to the back of
clear plexiglass produces a
simultaneous illusion of depth and
flatness which heightens the
impact of the content. The human
figure is absent in the above works
but reappears in manipulated
symbolic form in his series of
twenty small etchings.
Flowing and Sensual

Stolurow form a contrast in

The surfaces are thick with built
up paint that looks as if it were
