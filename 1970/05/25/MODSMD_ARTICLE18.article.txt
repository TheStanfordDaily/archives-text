# Pitzer Asks Alumni To Stay Openminded
## 
### 
President Kenneth Pitzer
Saturday asked alumni to keep an
open mind toward the large group
of students and many faculty
"who are dedicated to the hard
and often unglamorous work ol
effecting change by political and
educational means."
In a speech delivered to the
Alumni Assembly, Pitzer said it
would be a "great mistake" to
lump this group of "peaceful
activists" together with the far
smaller, mere violent group which
seeks to destroy the University.
Praising their "honesty,
spontaneity, and constructive
ness," Pitzer emphasized, "the
nonviolent group is sticking with
the democratic process. They are
fighting for what they say they
are fighting for. You may not
agree with all of their causes, but
in the political and social arena,
there is room for disagreement."
The radicals' real purpose,
according to Pitzer, is to destroy
the University. "1 don't mean the
smashing of windows, the
desecration of walls, or even the
burning of buildings—bad as all of
these depredations are. What 1
mean is their intention to destroy
the University as an institution
and replace it with an institution
in their own radical mold."
"The radical group must be
counteracted. The University is
doing this, within the due process
of campus rules and civil law,"
Pitzer said.
"The non-violent group must
be given the opportunity to

spread its message. Hie
consequences could be most
unfortunate if these sincere young
people were to say in the end, 'we
tried to talk with you, but we
didn't get through.'
"Quite often I am asked why
we don't summarily expel
students rather than rely on
campus judicial procedures," he
said. "First, we must realize that
half or more of the militants are
not Stanford students and must
be dealt with by outside
authority. When police have made
the identification and the arrest,
the determination of guilt or
innocence, even of a student, is
best handled in a court of law. An
additional University penalty can
be considered if an arrested
student is found guilty.
"But also where a student is
accused of lesser misbehavior
upon evidence available internally
and the case is handled within the
University, it is equally important
to give the defendant a fair
hearing. The campus judicial
system was established to do this.
Stanford's system is heavily taxed
at present and it may require
strengthening, but let us not
abandon justice in the name of
expedience."
"The campus is not unlike the
real world in this respect, and in a
modest way we are adhering to
the advice given earlier this week
by Chief Justice Warren Burger
than we not suspend fundamental
guarantees and take short-cuts as a
matter of self-protection in times
of stress."

doing this, within the due process
of campus rules and civil law,"
Pitzer said.
"The non-violent group must
be given the opportunity to

spread its message. Hie
consequences could be most
unfortunate if these sincere young
people were to say in the end, 'we
tried to talk with you, but we
didn't get through.'
"Quite often I am asked why
we don't summarily expel
students rather than rely on
campus judicial procedures," he
said. "First, we must realize that
half or more of the militants are
not Stanford students and must
be dealt with by outside
authority. When police have made
the identification and the arrest,
the determination of guilt or
innocence, even of a student, is
best handled in a court of law. An
additional University penalty can
be considered if an arrested
student is found guilty.
"But also where a student is
accused of lesser misbehavior
upon evidence available internally
and the case is handled within the
University, it is equally important
to give the defendant a fair
hearing. The campus judicial
system was established to do this.
Stanford's system is heavily taxed
at present and it may require
strengthening, but let us not
abandon justice in the name of
expedience."
"The campus is not unlike the
real world in this respect, and in a
modest way we are adhering to
the advice given earlier this week
by Chief Justice Warren Burger
than we not suspend fundamental
guarantees and take short-cuts as a
matter of self-protection in times
of stress."
President Kenneth Pitzer
Saturday asked alumni to keep an
open mind toward the large group
of students and many faculty
"who are dedicated to the hard
and often unglamorous work ol
effecting change by political and
educational means."
In a speech delivered to the
Alumni Assembly, Pitzer said it
would be a "great mistake" to
lump this group of "peaceful
activists" together with the far
smaller, mere violent group which
seeks to destroy the University.
Praising their "honesty,
spontaneity, and constructive
ness," Pitzer emphasized, "the
nonviolent group is sticking with
the democratic process. They are
fighting for what they say they
are fighting for. You may not
agree with all of their causes, but
in the political and social arena,
there is room for disagreement."
The radicals' real purpose,
according to Pitzer, is to destroy
the University. "1 don't mean the
smashing of windows, the
desecration of walls, or even the
burning of buildings—bad as all of
these depredations are. What 1
mean is their intention to destroy
the University as an institution
and replace it with an institution
in their own radical mold."
"The radical group must be
counteracted. The University is
doing this, within the due process
of campus rules and civil law,"
Pitzer said.
"The non-violent group must
be given the opportunity to

spread its message. Hie
consequences could be most
unfortunate if these sincere young
people were to say in the end, 'we
tried to talk with you, but we
didn't get through.'
