# New ROTC Debate On Old Questions
## 
### 
Several ROTC cadets and
professors testified on opposite
sides of the fence in a public
hearing of the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC
Affairs Friday.
The first to testify, Gregory
Osborne, an Army ROTC cadet
and former cadet batallion
commander (senior cadet drill
instructor), defended ROTC on
the grounds that it is a good
alternative to the draft and
provides deferments to graduate
students who would normally not
receive them. He said that the
'punitive clause' is only a part of
"a private contractual
arra gement between an
individual and the Army" and is
therefore not objectionable.
English professor Ronald
Rebholz questioned whether
ROTC would quailfy as a
volunteer student organization.
He said "ROTC can never be a
truly volunteer student
organization," when all
draft-eligible students are
somewhat pressured into joining
it.
He also cited the decision of
the Dean of Students to deny
VSO status to a voluntary student
guerilla training group because
such a group would be "contrary
to the goals and purposes of the
University."
English teaching assistant and
former Army Captain Jerry
Hallisey testified that the Army is
on college campuses not to teach
relevant ROTC courses, for the
courses he and his fellow officers
took were "absolutely useless"
but to "inculcate military
attitudes into a university
environment."

He also stated that the
argument alleging a humanizing
effect of ROTC-trained officers
on the military overlooks the
decision making structure of the
Army.
Army ROTC cadet Wade
Benton defended what he called
"high academic standards of first
and second year Army ROTC
courses now taught," and Donald
Nanney, another cadet, said that
on the basis of a poll of ROTC
students conducted by himself,
that the ROTC departments do
not attempt to instill certain
political or militaristic attitudes in
its students.
History professor Lyman Van
Slyke urged the Committee to
consider the original majority
report of 1968 of Senate Ad Hoc
Committee on ROTC, which
advocated a gradual phasing out
of military training at Stanford.
The Committee addressed itself
to two major questions
concerning ROTC: 1. Should
ROTC at Stanford be terminated
or retained? 2. If ROTC is to be
retained, what transitional credit
arrangements, if any, should exist
for the benefit of students now
enrolled in ROTC?
The Committee, chaired by law
professor Keith Mann (former
chairman Alan Manne resigned
from the committee in protest
over the faculty Senate's January
decision to grant limited credit for
ROTC courses), consists of three
faculty members, three students,
and several ex-officio, non-voting
members including Col. Stanley
Ramey, head of Army ROTC at
Stanford.

English teaching assistant and
former Army Captain Jerry
Hallisey testified that the Army is
on college campuses not to teach
relevant ROTC courses, for the
courses he and his fellow officers
took were "absolutely useless"
but to "inculcate military
attitudes into a university
environment."

He also stated that the
argument alleging a humanizing
effect of ROTC-trained officers
on the military overlooks the
decision making structure of the
Army.
Army ROTC cadet Wade
Benton defended what he called
"high academic standards of first
and second year Army ROTC
courses now taught," and Donald
Nanney, another cadet, said that
on the basis of a poll of ROTC
students conducted by himself,
that the ROTC departments do
not attempt to instill certain
political or militaristic attitudes in
its students.
History professor Lyman Van
Slyke urged the Committee to
consider the original majority
report of 1968 of Senate Ad Hoc
Committee on ROTC, which
advocated a gradual phasing out
of military training at Stanford.
The Committee addressed itself
to two major questions
concerning ROTC: 1. Should
ROTC at Stanford be terminated
or retained? 2. If ROTC is to be
retained, what transitional credit
arrangements, if any, should exist
for the benefit of students now
enrolled in ROTC?
The Committee, chaired by law
professor Keith Mann (former
chairman Alan Manne resigned
from the committee in protest
over the faculty Senate's January
decision to grant limited credit for
ROTC courses), consists of three
faculty members, three students,
and several ex-officio, non-voting
members including Col. Stanley
Ramey, head of Army ROTC at
Stanford.
Several ROTC cadets and
professors testified on opposite
sides of the fence in a public
hearing of the President's
Advisory Committee on ROTC
Affairs Friday.
The first to testify, Gregory
Osborne, an Army ROTC cadet
and former cadet batallion
commander (senior cadet drill
instructor), defended ROTC on
the grounds that it is a good
alternative to the draft and
provides deferments to graduate
students who would normally not
receive them. He said that the
'punitive clause' is only a part of
"a private contractual
arra gement between an
individual and the Army" and is
therefore not objectionable.
English professor Ronald
Rebholz questioned whether
ROTC would quailfy as a
volunteer student organization.
He said "ROTC can never be a
truly volunteer student
organization," when all
draft-eligible students are
somewhat pressured into joining
it.
He also cited the decision of
the Dean of Students to deny
VSO status to a voluntary student
guerilla training group because
such a group would be "contrary
to the goals and purposes of the
University."
