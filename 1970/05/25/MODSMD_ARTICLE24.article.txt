# Plot To Corrupt Intellectuals
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
This week, a film by the
director of "Z", a documentary
about Bob Dylan, "Dr.
Strangelove", and a horror film
are all being shown as part of a

plot to corrupt the elite
intellectuals.
Avant-garde Films
Tonight, "Genesis II", a two
hour program of awardwinning
short films, originally scheduled

last month, will be shown at 7 and
9:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
Tliis excellent collection of 16
new films made by student and
independent film makers from
across the country will be
presented by ASSU as an
exclusive feature in the Bay area.
The program is a representative
cross-section of what's happening
in motion picture production and
in avant-garde film making.
Among the films are a number of
festival prize winners:
"Retreat"-"A young Viet Nam
veteran attempts to come to terms
with his memories of war and the
self-revelation of his own capacity
for violence and destruction,"
"Demonstration Movie I" - "a
film designed to help young
people make the difficult
transition into adult society and
when sincerely followed, this film
will bring undreamed of success in
sexual relationships and
occupational careers," "E Pluribus
Unum"-"A highly abstract
nightmarish fantasy of the
emasculation of man by modern
woman," "Bambi Meets
Godzilla "-self explanatory,
"Coke "-"A giant step for
mankind" and "Campus Christi"
by two Stanford grad students,
D.B. Jones and J.K. Jennings.
"Genesis II" is definately a
worthwhile evening of creative
and entertaining cinema. "Not
suggested for immature
audiences."
Dylan Documentary
Funky Films will present
"Don't Look Back" tonight at 7,
9, and 11 in Cubberley. This
documentary was directed by
D.A. Pennabaker ("Monterey
Pop") and "stars" Bob Dylan. I
found it to be an interesting and
illuminating insight into pre-John
Wesley Harding Dylan.
Some critics claim that
Pennebaker wanted "Don't Look
Back" treated virtually as a
fictional movie starring Bob Dylan
as Bob Dylan and others look
upon it as a record of Dylan's tour
through England in 1965.
What Pennebaker did record is
not Bob Dylan as he really is,
whatever that means, but rather
how Bob Dylan responds to the
role imposed upon him by the
camera. What we see is a man who
is what is what he sings,
obscurities and all.
Frosh Flicks
Tuesday evening, Clive Miller
will present "Hail the Conquering
Hero" at 8 and"The Beast With
Fingers" at 10. A 1944 comedy,
"Hail the Conquering Hero",
written, directed, and produced
by Preston Sturges, one of the
foremost satirists of his time, stars
Eddie Bracken who survives the
ordeal of a 4-F self-exposed as a
false war hero, and is redeemed by
the generous emotions of his
girlfriend, Ella Raines. Especially
timely is the performance of
ex-prizefighter Eddie Steele as an

orphanage bred marine hero with
a severe mother complex.
All I know about "The Beast
With Five Fingers" is that it's a
1946 Warner Brothers horror film
directed by Robert Florey and
starring Robert Alda, Peter Lorre,
J. Carrol Nash, Charles Dingle,
and Andrea King. However, Clive
has infinite wisdom when it comes
to selecting films.
"Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I
Learned to Stop Worrying and
Love the Bomb" will be shown
this Tuesday evening at 7 :30 and
10 in Memorial Auditorium. The
screenplay is by Stanley Kubrick,
Terry Southern ("Candy", "The
Loved Ones", "Easy Rider") and
Peter George, and is derived from
George's novel Red Alert.
Kubrick ("Paths of Glory",
"Spartacus", "Lolita", "2001: A
Space Odyssey") directed this
classic black comedy about a
nuclear attack accidentally
launched on Russia. In order to
avert retaliation and total war, the
American President calls the
Soviet Premier to warn him that
the unintended attack is coming
and to help him destroy the U.S.
planes.
But one plane gets through,
drops its megaton message, and
detonates the Soviet Doomsday
Machine, a thermonuclear device
which, once triggered, cannot be
untriggered and which will
blanket the earth with radioactive
material for ninety-three years.
Kubrick said about "Dr.
Strangelove": "I started work on
the screenplay with every
intention of making the film a
serious treatment of the problem
of accidental nuclear war. As I
kept trying to imagine the way in
which things would really happen,
ideas kept coming to me which I
would discard because they were
so ludicrous. But after a month of
so I began to realize that all the
things I was throwing out were
the things which were most
truthful. After all, what could be
more absurd, than the very idea of
two megapowfrs willing to wipe
out all human life because of an
accident, spiced up by political
differences that will seem as
meaningless to people a hundred
years from now as the theological
conflicts of the Middle Ages
appear to us today? So it occurred
to me that I was approaching the
project in the wrong way. The
only way to tell the story was a
black comedy or, better, a
nightmare comedy, where the
things you laugh at most are really
the heart of the paradoxical
postures that a nuclear war
possible."
Thursday evening, the
Internationa] Association will
show "Sleeping Car Murder" at 8
in Cubberley. This exciting
mystery was directed by
Costa-Gavras who also directed
one of the best foreign films of all
time, "Z" and stars Simon
Signoret and Yves Montand.


Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick's black satire on the lighter side of the
American Anns game, will be shown tomorrow night a! 7.30 and 10 in Mem
Aud.
