# Riles Hits Funding, Tests At Reception
## 
### 
Charges of mismanagement of
funds and falsification of school
test scores were levied at State
Superintendent of schools Max
Rafferty by his former deputy,
Wilson Riles, here Thursday.
Speaking at a reception
sponsored by the 15-member
Stanford Friends of Riles
Committee, Riles cited findings
made by State Legislative Analyst
A. Alan Post.
Rafferty has used the office for
personal gain, Riles added,
pleading: "We'll encounter a
disaster if we don't end that man's
tenure. I can't do it alone, but we
can do it all in one election. I
need your help."
Warm and sustained applause
greeted his talk in the Women's
Clubhouse. About 115 persons,
mostly students, were present.
Riles, a 12-year veteran of the
State Department of Education, is

probably the highest ranking
black educator in California. He
has been the director of the state'
compensatory education plan
under the Miller-Unruh bill. He
resigned to run against Rafferty.
"We have documented
evidence" to show the
deterioration of the state's public
school system, Dr. Riles said.
"In the eight years of Max
Rafferty's reign, he has initiated
not one single program that has
helped the children of this state,"
he charged. "He has commented
on every possible problem but
hasn't done one thing. He goes off
on tangents, feeds on divisiveness
on things like sex education and
moral guidelines."
In the past six months since his
resignation, Dr. Riles has traveled
the length and breadth of the
state and found that "everywhere
people are interested in education
and sense that something is wrong
with the leadership."
"I want to change the tone of
the state's education program,"
Dr. Riles told the gathering.
"Parents are tired of being
alarmed. We want programs laid
out that can work. If we don't,
we'll lose public education in this
state."
He suggested a statewide
educational tax base, instead of
the continuing local tax
difficulties.
"We can't get adequate funds
from the property tax any more,"
he said. "Taxes are too high, so
we'll have to figure out a new
method. Maybe we could do with
a few less freeways or a 'sin' tax
on tabacco and alcohol for school
purposes," he added as the
audience laughed.
"We've got to have goals," he
emphasized. "We've got to have
goals," he emphasized. "We've got
to know what a kid should be able
to do in June that he couldn't do
the previous September. We've got
to re-structure and make the
system more flexible, using both
new and old resources. And we've
''got to ease the burden of the
schools. We're asking the schools
to do now what we used to pray
to God for."
He called for a comprehensive
program of educational planning
involving teachers, parents, pupils
and administrators. "We've got to
find out what they need to do the
job and allow them the freedom
to do it."
We should also fire
incompetent teachers, regardless
of the tenure regulations, and put
an end to the "feminity in the
early grades by encouraging more
men to enter the profession,' Dr.
Riles suggested.
