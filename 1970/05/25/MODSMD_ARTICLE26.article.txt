# Prof Asks Change In Technology Goals
## 
### 
Technologists must now decide
just who they will serve, the
Department of Defense or the
whole of humanity, Columbia
professor Seymour Melman said
here last Friday.
"Technology is to serve the
particular needs of man. Military
engineers must get new
orientation and use their skills for
constructive purposes," continued
Melman, a professor of industrial
engineering.
He asserted that engineers must
regain the right to decide how
their skills are used. In the last
twenty years, most major schools
have worked with the Department
of Defense because it offered the
most money and opportunities for
scientists. Melman called for a
change, asking whether "we
should continue to let government
desires mold our schools. We must
ask if students want to function as
part of the state technology."
He closed in a startling manner
by demanding that restrictions be
placed on who can enter
engineering and other related
sciences. "No one should be
allowed to work openly toward
the destruction of man's life and
liberty." His audience responded
with prolonged applause.
Melman attacked the power
elite "centered in the Defense
Department" who are directing
this nation. "The decision making
power of Wall Street is now
centered at the peak of the
Department of Defense.
"The functional chairman of
the board is the President." He

noted that the President now has
the military power previously
found only in facist and Bolshevik
regimes.
The noted author pointed out
that "the strength of state
management is that they secure
funds directly from Congress.
However that may lead to their
ultimate defeat."
He called for a new direction in
government, but remained
skeptical as to whether that
change could occur in the present
climate of the country, since
almost 20 percent of the work
force, about 18 million Americans
are at least indirectly effected by
defense spending. Hence, there
may be some reluctance by these
workers to cut defense budgets.
In offering alternatives to
spending funds on war material,
he cited a whole host of
commodities and services needed
by the society that have had no
sophisticated technological input
in recent years. Among them were
housing, steel production,
machine tools, fishing vessels, and
numerous ecological
requirements.
He spoke at length about the
Indochina War, and declared that
while it is a calamity for the
United States, it is a success for
industrial elite. So successful, in
fact, that he envisioned a whole
series of similar wars in the future.
"Even if there is peace in
Indochina tomorrow, there will be
no peace for the United States,"
he concluded.

ask if students want to function as
part of the state technology."
He closed in a startling manner
by demanding that restrictions be
placed on who can enter
engineering and other related
sciences. "No one should be
allowed to work openly toward
the destruction of man's life and
liberty." His audience responded
with prolonged applause.
Melman attacked the power
elite "centered in the Defense
Department" who are directing
this nation. "The decision making
power of Wall Street is now
centered at the peak of the
Department of Defense.
"The functional chairman of
the board is the President." He

noted that the President now has
the military power previously
found only in facist and Bolshevik
regimes.
The noted author pointed out
that "the strength of state
management is that they secure
funds directly from Congress.
However that may lead to their
ultimate defeat."
He called for a new direction in
government, but remained
skeptical as to whether that
change could occur in the present
climate of the country, since
almost 20 percent of the work
force, about 18 million Americans
are at least indirectly effected by
defense spending. Hence, there
may be some reluctance by these
workers to cut defense budgets.
In offering alternatives to
spending funds on war material,
he cited a whole host of
commodities and services needed
by the society that have had no
sophisticated technological input
in recent years. Among them were
housing, steel production,
machine tools, fishing vessels, and
numerous ecological
requirements.
He spoke at length about the
Indochina War, and declared that
while it is a calamity for the
United States, it is a success for
industrial elite. So successful, in
fact, that he envisioned a whole
series of similar wars in the future.
"Even if there is peace in
Indochina tomorrow, there will be
no peace for the United States,"
he concluded.
