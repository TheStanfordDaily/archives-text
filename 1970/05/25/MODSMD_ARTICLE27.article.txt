## 'God On Our Side' 
### John Arthur 
There were only a handful of athletes at a meeting of the
Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) in Tresidder the other night,
but football player Ted Bleymaier, one of the group's leaders, wasn't
disappointed.
"TTiis is only our second year of operation here," he said, "And our
group's been growing ever since we started a year ago last fall, with
the help of Paul Neumann. Neumann, after serving for two years as
freshman basketball coach, resigned last August to devote full time to
Christian missionary work.
Now, a small group of athletes meets once a week for a sort of
spiritual bull session. The experience, says Bleymaier, "has made me
more open. It's like moving into a frat - looking for my kind of guy.
The group is primarily, though not exclusively, for athletes."
One of Stanford's many quarterbacks, Bleymaier says that the
group experience "saved me during my freshman year. We could lay
out our problems ana there was someone there to listen.
"1 went to my first FCA summer conference after my sophomore
year in high school, and it really struck me the way some pro athletes
got up and spoke of their faith.
Faith and Attitude
"That was when I was first able to apply my Christian faith to
outside things. And it made a difference in how I was able to cope
with frustrations and disappointments. I know my faith is not
necessarily going to make me a better athlete physically, but having a
commitment affects my mental and psychological approach to the
game. And it reminds me that athletics aren't the only thing."
Vic Gordon, a freshman baseball player, agrees, saying that "having
God on my side, doing my best for Him, helps me bring out my
natural abilities."
The FCA describes itself as an "interdenominational, interracial
fellowship through which ordinary people help each other become
better men and better examples of what the Lord can do with a
yielded life." It sponsors hundreds of "huddle" and "fellowship"
groups on high school and college campuses, a variety of special
conferences, and publishes a magazine, "The Christian Athlete," as
well as other brochures. Its doctrine is essentially a conservative one,
and in the two decades of the organization's existence it has evoked
the greatest response from the south and midwest, as well as in high
schools nationwide. At Stanford, athletes from a wide range of sports,
including varsity competitors as well as freshmen, have taken part in
FCA activities.
Bibles and T-Shirts
With an annual budget of more than $1 million, the FCA is a big
business. It works hard to involve big name college and pro athletes in
its program, and many athletes and coaches instruct at the summer
conferences. Slick films and tapes, with titles like "The Life That
Wins" and "Under the Master Coach" are made available to college
and high school groups. The FCA also sells sweatshirts, T-shirts,
Bibles, decals, and jackets. But the organization finances itself on gifts
from foundations and individuals.
At the meeting the other night, with a film about a summer
conference to be held in Santa Barbara, was the FCA's West Coast
Regional Director, Bob Watson. Watson, captain of UCLA's 1950
football team, went on to coach at Oregon State, Utah and lowa. Two
years ago he joined FCA on a fulltime basis and he's now heading up a
drive to establish fellowship chapters in western colleges and
universities for this unique organization.

SLOW WEEKEND—The only legitimate sporting activity on this campus last
weekend—excluding such standbys as female observation and sun
worship—consisted of these young chaps throwing footballs, running sprints and
jumping for distance as part of a "Stanford Lockheed Sports Clinic." Though
these young bomb-throwers consistently hit llie middle of the target (worth live
points, you know) Coach Ralston insisted yesterday that the second
quarterback spot is still between Mike lioryla and Jesse Freitas.
