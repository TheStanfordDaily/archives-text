Charges of drug selling have
been leveled against William Boyd,
former president of the Stanford
Young Republicans and a
candidate for the 26th District
Seat of the California Assembly.
In a column appearing in this
morning's Daily current Stanford
YR president Don Ayer stated
that, "Running as a flag waving,
law-and-order conservative,
talking about communist agents
and law breaker (though he has
offered to sell or give drugs to at
least two Stanford students),
Boyd must represent most that is
wrong with the American political
system."
A Daily investigation has
obtained written statements of
confirmation from the two
students involved.
Both Marshall Kilduff,
co-editor of next year's Daily, and
Harvey Hukari, president of the
Free Campus Movement, have
indicated that they refused offers
of drugs from Boyd.
Boyd denied the charges
categorically. "I have known
people in that, but I have not
done that ... I deny it."
Asked his opinion on the
legalization of marijuana, he
noted that, "At one time, I
thought that was right; I now feel
very strongly that that should not
be done." He said "My whole
outlook has changed, just having
seen what drugs have done to
people ... I was very naive on the
whole, to the problems that arose
through drugs, and I don't feel I
am that naive now."
Boyd's campaign has been
centered on ecological issues
confronting his Peninsula district.
The charges against Boyd arise
from several members of the
university community. One YR
member said that, "A bunch of us
have known Bill, and worked with
him, and we just felt that we had
to come out and say
something... he is completely
unfit for any office, completely
lacking in integrity."
Senior John Rogers, another
member of the YR organization,
noted that, "Most of his former
associates on the executive board
of the YR's have individually
endorsed his opponent Dixon
Arnet.

Ayer reiterated that, "The YR
organization is doing nothing as a
group to support or detract from
Boyd's efforts, this is just an
individual action on the part of
some of us who know Bill."
Former president of the
California College Republicans,
Michael Kuhl admitted that,
"There's no doubt that he's made
a pitch for the conservative vote,
but Christ, look at the district."
When questioned, certain
liberal and radical activists on
campus indicated that they had
known of Boyd's activities.
