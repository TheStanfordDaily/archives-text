# 'ROTC 44' Halts Door Blockading
## 
### 
| The group of students that has
i been blocking the entrances to the
i ROTC building for three weeks
1 have announced that they will
; discontinue the disruption and
i devote their full efforts to other
i strike activities.
1 A statement of the group
added, however, "if the
President's Advisory Committee
on ROTC does not make progress
toward removing ROTC and if the
1 ROTC business returns to normal,
we feel compelled to return."
A spokesman said that the
i "ROTC 44 and friends," as they
1 are known, will meet tomorrow to
decide what further action to
take. Emphasizing the group
intends to work both together and
as individuals on future actions,
( he said that since they have
effectively "halted business in the
ROTC building at Stanford," they
should devote their "full efforts
to other strike activities."
He added that dissipation of
1 numbers, boredom and fear of
} greater repression influenced the
j group to stop blocking the
( building at t his time.
( He said the lull will give them
j time to build their strength.
I Blocking of the ROTC building
( since May 4 has forced the Navy,
( Army, and Air Force ROTC units
to set up offices and hold classes
i elsewhere -even off campus. The
i group blocking the building let

those who had business with the )
Department of Athletics (which {
shares the building with the \
ROTC units) enter, but has )
prevented those with ROTC /
business from entering. j
Campus officials on two i
separate occasions have told those
blocking the entrances that they j
were in violation of campus \
disruption policy and would be \
prosecuted through the S.JC. A
total of 44 students gave their
names to those officials at that (
time.
A spokesman for the group said
that members had heard rumors
that University officials would
begin to take names and again
start SeJC proceedings if students
continued to block the doors.
The group issued the following
statement over the weekend:
"We, the ROTC 44 and friends,
have, since May 4, effectively
halted business in the ROTC
building at Stanford. Having
achieved this goal, we decided, as
of May 24, to discontinue our
disruption and devote our full
efforts to other strike activities. i
"It must be made clear,/
however, that if the President's 1
Advisory Committee on
does not make progress toward
removing ROTC and if ROTC
business returns to normal, we
reserve the option to return."
