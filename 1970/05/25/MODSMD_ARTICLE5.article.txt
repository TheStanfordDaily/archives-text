# Open Campus 'Success'
## 
### 
The second week of Open
Campus brought over 800 people
to Stanford for informal
discussions with students about
the war, the university and
society.
Organizers called the weekend a
"fantastic success". The success,
they claimed can be measured in
terms of the intensity of the
conversations that took place as
well as they number of people
involved. The atmosphere was one
of goodwill coupled with forceful
dialogue.
Commenting on the low
student participation in Open
Campus, Mike Fehling of the
PACC noted, "the community
was clearly interested in dialogue.
Students were not. People left
Stanford because there were not
students available to talk to."

Jacques Delacroix who
originated the idea of inviting the
"Silent Majority" on campus,
cited the positive gains from the
two weekends of discussion.
"We have proved that it is
possible to carry off this idea
under adverse conditions. We have
proved that it can be done
without extensive organization or
funding. We have made small
footholds in the unions and
established groups in the
community."
Delacroix stated the Open
Campus has become "just a good
idea since circumstances have
changed from the time I proposed
it. Then America was hot, the
campus was hot." The urgency
now is less, the time not as ripe, in
his opinion.

Delacroix predicted that the
idea will emerge again in the fall.
"The next time this is called for,
we will be able to respond much
more quickly. Now, America has
recessed for the summer," he said.
"New cultural forms are bring
evolved from events like this. We
told the public 'Don't expect to
be directed.' The weekend had a
formless, unstructured quality. We
don't need to think in
organizational terms," Delacroix
added.
Fehling commented that
students maintained their role as
the silent majority, declining the
chance to talk to the public in
favor of personal peasures." I am
interested in what these students
are willing to do. They never
confront for themselves what
committment they are willing to
make," he said.
