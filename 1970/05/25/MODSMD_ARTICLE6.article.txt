## U.S. To Aid Viets 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Secretary
of State William P. Rogers
indicated Sunday that South
Vietnamese operations in
Cambodia will have U.S. support
after American troops pull out.
But he said plans for such future
actions will not be disclosed in
advance.
"We're not concerned about
that at all," Rogers told newsmen
when asked if he is concerned
about reported South Vietnamese
intentions to operate in Cambodia
after the June 30 deadline set by
President Nixon for withdrawal of
U.S. troops.
Rogers said there is advantage
"in having Asians work together
to solve Asian problems," but at
another point said he also agrees
with Secretary of Defense Melvin
R. Laird that U.S. air support
might be made available for some
future South Vietnamese
operations in Cambodia.
The Secretary of State,
speaking at Andrews Air Force
Base as he took off for a NATO
meeting in Rome, made plain that
he does not want to spell out in
advance just what actions may be

taken after the current sanctuary -
clearing operation in Cambodia.
"Our forces will be out of
Cambodia by July 1," Rogers
said.
"But insofar as other aspects of
the war are concerned," he said,
there is no point to signaling the
enemy in advance.
War Poll
BERKELEY (AP)-A 67 per
cent majority favored a U.S.
cease-fire for ending the Vietnam
war in poll sampling of
communities in theEast Bay.
Results of the poll were
reported Sunday by Dr. Lois S.
Gold, who headed the research
team from the political science
department of the University of
California's Berkeley campus.
She said a randomly selected
survey of more than 1,000 people
residing in East Bay cities and
towns were asked their opinions
on many different Vietnam
proposals.
A proposal for a U.S. cease-fire
with United Nations supervised
elections was supported by a
majority of all community
segments, including Republicans
and Democrats, young and old,
college educated and those with
less than college education, she
said.
The pollsters asked: "Here is a
single proposal for ending the war
that has three parts:
1 ) The United States would
cease fire in Vietnam.

2) The United States then
would call for free elections, open
to all parties, and supervised by
the United Nations.
3) The United States would
then ask Hanoi also to cease fire
and to join in declaring before the
elections to accept the outcome
and withdraw troops if requested.
Do you approve or disapprove of
this proposal?"
Overall, 67 per cent approved
16 per cent disapproved. The
balance declared no opinion.

(AP )-Chancellor Glenn Dumke of

Dumke, in a directive to Hobert
Burns, acting San Jose State
president, said "disorders
involving personal injuries and
property damage have occurred
following certain of Mr. Kunstler's
appearances."
"In keeping with my over-all
responsibility to take every
reasonable and prudent measure
for the safety of the college
community and for property
associated with the California
state colleges, I have concluded
that an appearance by Mr.
Kunstler at this time is
inadvisable," Dumke said.

operations in Cambodia.
The Secretary of State,
speaking at Andrews Air Force
Base as he took off for a NATO
meeting in Rome, made plain that
he does not want to spell out in
advance just what actions may be

taken after the current sanctuary -
clearing operation in Cambodia.
"Our forces will be out of
Cambodia by July 1," Rogers
said.
"But insofar as other aspects of
the war are concerned," he said,
there is no point to signaling the
enemy in advance.
War Poll
BERKELEY (AP)-A 67 per
cent majority favored a U.S.
cease-fire for ending the Vietnam
war in poll sampling of
communities in theEast Bay.
Results of the poll were
reported Sunday by Dr. Lois S.
Gold, who headed the research
team from the political science
department of the University of
California's Berkeley campus.
She said a randomly selected
survey of more than 1,000 people
residing in East Bay cities and
towns were asked their opinions
on many different Vietnam
proposals.
A proposal for a U.S. cease-fire
with United Nations supervised
elections was supported by a
majority of all community
segments, including Republicans
and Democrats, young and old,
college educated and those with
less than college education, she
said.
The pollsters asked: "Here is a
single proposal for ending the war
that has three parts:
1 ) The United States would
cease fire in Vietnam.

2) The United States then
would call for free elections, open
to all parties, and supervised by
the United Nations.
3) The United States would
then ask Hanoi also to cease fire
and to join in declaring before the
elections to accept the outcome
and withdraw troops if requested.
Do you approve or disapprove of
this proposal?"
Overall, 67 per cent approved
16 per cent disapproved. The
balance declared no opinion.
Kunstler
LOS ANGELES
(AP )-Chancellor Glenn Dumke of
the California state college system
banned Sunday the scheduled
appearance Tuesday night of
William Kunstler at San Jose State
College.
Kunstler is chief defense lawyer
of the Chicago Seven.
Dumke, in a directive to Hobert
Burns, acting San Jose State
president, said "disorders
involving personal injuries and
property damage have occurred
following certain of Mr. Kunstler's
appearances."
"In keeping with my over-all
responsibility to take every
reasonable and prudent measure
for the safety of the college
community and for property
associated with the California
state colleges, I have concluded
that an appearance by Mr.
Kunstler at this time is
inadvisable," Dumke said.
WASHINGTON (AP)-Secretary
of State William P. Rogers
indicated Sunday that South
Vietnamese operations in
Cambodia will have U.S. support
after American troops pull out.
But he said plans for such future
actions will not be disclosed in
advance.
"We're not concerned about
that at all," Rogers told newsmen
when asked if he is concerned
about reported South Vietnamese
intentions to operate in Cambodia
after the June 30 deadline set by
President Nixon for withdrawal of
U.S. troops.
Rogers said there is advantage
"in having Asians work together
to solve Asian problems," but at
another point said he also agrees
with Secretary of Defense Melvin
R. Laird that U.S. air support
might be made available for some
future South Vietnamese
operations in Cambodia.
