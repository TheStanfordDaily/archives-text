# Presidential Aide Wyman Resigns
## 
### 
Willard Wyman is taking a
year's leave-of-absence from the
Stanford administration to accept
a writing grant from the Ford
Foundation.
Wyman special assistant to
President Pitzer, is not likely to
return after the leave.
His departure is self-initiated.
During the winter and spring
Wyman was offered several high
level posts at other colleges and
universities, finally deciding to
accept the Ford grant for which
he applied early in the year.
Wyman frequently remarked in
the last year that he was tired of

the pressure and paper work
associated with his job. He joined
the administration in 1967 as
associate dean of students and
became a presidential assistant last
September.
Commenting on Wyman's plans
yesterday, Pitzer said, "Both Bill
and I viewed this year's job as an
interim position. At this point I
cannot predict whether he will be
back after next year."
Wyman said yesterday,"I don't
think I'll return here. I've always
wanted to teach and I had
expected to leave after one year in
this post. Wherever I go after next
year, I'll want a split appointment
in the administration and on the
faculty."

Wyman received a Ph.D. in
English at Stanford last year.
After last spring's campus
clashes, Wyman indicated he
hoped to get out of a high
pressure job. This spring, he found
himself doing the same jobs had
left behind last year.
"Bill filled an important role in
keeping communication open
between students and the
administration," Pitzer noted
yesterday.
Pitzer continued, "I shall
certainly miss Bill next year. He's
been a great help this year, but I
know he's anxious to obtain a
position that includes more
teaching opportunities."


MOVING OUTâ€”Presidential assistant Wyman announced his resignalioi
yesterday to allow tor private work.
