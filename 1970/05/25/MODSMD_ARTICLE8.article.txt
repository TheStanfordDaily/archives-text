### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Bill Wyman is probably the only college administrator in America
who lives on a mountain top with his wife and eight donkeys.
In the office, he is one of the few administrators at Stanford who
talks to students without formality and gives a damn about what they
say.
His departure will break a fragile but crucial link between students
and the administration. He is the one man in Building 10 who rolls up
his sleeves, pulls down his tie, and sits on the ground to talk with
radicals.
Bill Wyman likes the ground. He often seems more at home driving
his battered pick-up truck down the rugged dirt roads at his house
than dictating a letter in his office.
For the past three years, Wyman has sacrificed some dusty outdoor
pleasures to serve first as Associate Dean of Students ai>d this year as
assistant to the President. He hasn't always liked his work.
When Wyman joined the Dean of Students staff in 1967, he was an
enthusiastic, innocent administrator. He had been an instructor in
English, a friend of radicals, and an optimist about administering a
university.
It was not long before he lost his innocence, some of his friends,
much of his optimism, and all his time to teach. He discovered that
acting as middleman between the high echelons of administration and
the aggressive demands of students is a draining, frustrating job.
Even in his frustration, he offered something other administrators
did not - sympathy and straight talking. In the first Old Union sit-in in
May 1968, Wyman was the only administrator who remained in the
building, talking and arguing with protesters.
With the president and provost he urged tolerence, patience and
negotiation.
In May 1968 Wyman began to understand he was damned if he did
and damned if he didn't. Conservatives thought he was an appeaser.
Radicals thought he was a "sell out." The characterizations gained
intensity the next winter.
At the January 1969 trustee disruption, Wyman identified
demonstrators and took their names for judicial proceedings. As he
glumly walked through the halls of the Faculty Club taking names, he
was ridiculed, pushed, and called every name in the book.
He later said he hated every minute. By the end of last year,
Wyman described himself as "damaged property." The search
committee for a new Dean of Students passed him by, and Wyman
noted he had no stomach for more confrontation politics.
President Pitzer was impressed with Wyman's performance under
fire. Pitzer apparently indicated to the dean search committee that he
would appoint Wyman if they listed him among their final nominees.
When they did not, Pitzer asked Wyman to move to the President's
Office as special assistant.
Wyman went, swearing he would not become involved in crisis
activities or paper work. He has done little else. Why?
Wyman says it was natural that Pitzer ask his help this spring
because of his experience with radicals as Associate Dean of Students.
Wyman soon took on jobs normally in the Dean of Students domain.
He handled the Bijay Sharma case with the police and foreign
students, and is now working on the Burnell Mack case.
Asked who would replace Wyman in keeping communication
flowing between students and the administration, Pitzer yesterday
suggested the Dean of Students or the new Dean of Undergraduate
Studies might take over some of Wyman's duties.
As the past year progressed, Wyman decided he wanted to return to
teaching. Last year he completed his Ph.D. in English. Throughout the
winter and spring Wyman was offered several high level positions at
other colleges and universities, often with a split appointment in
administration and the English faculty.
He finally decided to turn in another direction, and has accepted a
Ford Foundation grant to write about problems of the modern
university. The year's grant, equal to his normal salary, will give
Wyman the time he desperately wants to get away from the tensions
and pressures of campus.
It is doubtful he will return to Stanford.
The Stanford English department rarely hires its own Ph. D.'sand
Pitzer does not seem enthusiastic aboi t rehiring Wyman. Wyman
wants "out" of the pressure and the paper work.
This summer he plans to make his annual pack trip with his
burrows in the High Sierra country.
Next fall there may be a little less dust and a little less humanity in
Building 1 0.

wants "out" of the pressure and the paper work.

Bill Wyman is probably the only college administrator in America
who lives on a mountain top with his wife and eight donkeys.
In the office, he is one of the few administrators at Stanford who
talks to students without formality and gives a damn about what they
say.
His departure will break a fragile but crucial link between students
and the administration. He is the one man in Building 10 who rolls up
his sleeves, pulls down his tie, and sits on the ground to talk with
radicals.
Bill Wyman likes the ground. He often seems more at home driving
his battered pick-up truck down the rugged dirt roads at his house
than dictating a letter in his office.
For the past three years, Wyman has sacrificed some dusty outdoor
pleasures to serve first as Associate Dean of Students ai>d this year as
assistant to the President. He hasn't always liked his work.
When Wyman joined the Dean of Students staff in 1967, he was an
enthusiastic, innocent administrator. He had been an instructor in
English, a friend of radicals, and an optimist about administering a
university.
It was not long before he lost his innocence, some of his friends,
much of his optimism, and all his time to teach. He discovered that
acting as middleman between the high echelons of administration and
the aggressive demands of students is a draining, frustrating job.
Even in his frustration, he offered something other administrators
did not - sympathy and straight talking. In the first Old Union sit-in in
May 1968, Wyman was the only administrator who remained in the
building, talking and arguing with protesters.
With the president and provost he urged tolerence, patience and
negotiation.
In May 1968 Wyman began to understand he was damned if he did
and damned if he didn't. Conservatives thought he was an appeaser.
Radicals thought he was a "sell out." The characterizations gained
intensity the next winter.
At the January 1969 trustee disruption, Wyman identified
demonstrators and took their names for judicial proceedings. As he
glumly walked through the halls of the Faculty Club taking names, he
was ridiculed, pushed, and called every name in the book.
He later said he hated every minute. By the end of last year,
Wyman described himself as "damaged property." The search
committee for a new Dean of Students passed him by, and Wyman
noted he had no stomach for more confrontation politics.
President Pitzer was impressed with Wyman's performance under
fire. Pitzer apparently indicated to the dean search committee that he
would appoint Wyman if they listed him among their final nominees.
When they did not, Pitzer asked Wyman to move to the President's
Office as special assistant.
Wyman went, swearing he would not become involved in crisis
activities or paper work. He has done little else. Why?
Wyman says it was natural that Pitzer ask his help this spring
because of his experience with radicals as Associate Dean of Students.
Wyman soon took on jobs normally in the Dean of Students domain.
He handled the Bijay Sharma case with the police and foreign
students, and is now working on the Burnell Mack case.
Asked who would replace Wyman in keeping communication
flowing between students and the administration, Pitzer yesterday
suggested the Dean of Students or the new Dean of Undergraduate
Studies might take over some of Wyman's duties.
As the past year progressed, Wyman decided he wanted to return to
teaching. Last year he completed his Ph.D. in English. Throughout the
winter and spring Wyman was offered several high level positions at
other colleges and universities, often with a split appointment in
administration and the English faculty.
He finally decided to turn in another direction, and has accepted a
Ford Foundation grant to write about problems of the modern
university. The year's grant, equal to his normal salary, will give
Wyman the time he desperately wants to get away from the tensions
and pressures of campus.
It is doubtful he will return to Stanford.
