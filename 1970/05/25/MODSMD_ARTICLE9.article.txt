# 'New Congress' Group Maps Plans
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
Plans for national and local
efforts to elect peace candidates
in the fall wore discussed Saturday
at the first regional meeting of the
Movement for a New Congress.
About 80 people, representing
'26 California schools, attended
the meeting, the first step in
setting up structures for political
action.
The Movement sought to
establish ''horizontal
communication" between colleges
and local groups at the first
meeting.
The aim of the national
Movement is "to mobilize and
coordinate the national student
population to work at the 'grass
roots' level."
Bill Pascoe, a Harvard law
student and a California organizer
for the Movement said work on
the project started after the
Washington march on May 9.
People, he said, "wanted to build
to channel" student energies into
changing the existing
Congressional make-up.
Pascoe said leaders wanted to
organize "a national, McCarthy
type effort" to elect "peace

c°.ndidat o "" to Congress in the
November elections, getting
students tc spend their summer
and fall working for such
candidates.
The Movement started at
several Eastern schools, and
Princeton has emerged as the
coordinating center for the
national program. There are now
400 Movement chapters
nationwide, at colleges with a
total student body of 1.6 million.
An information form, already
distributed at Stanford, has been
prepared for students to tell what
work they can do for the
Movement and when.
These forms are now being
collected on campuses and will be
sent to Princeton. MIT computers
will then organize the information
and list student volunteers by area
(using postal Zip Codes as
classifications).
The lists will be distributed to
local chapters by mid-June so
summer work and planning for
the fall may begin.
Pascoe explained that the
gathering of this volunteer
information is the first step in the

Movement's plans. The second
phase will be local meetings to
select which candidates they will
endorse.
Marshall Goldberg, a Stanford
law student and a local organizer,
outlined three phases of the
Movement's activities, the summer
plan, fall plan and the period from
October 20 to November 3.
Work during the summer will
include efforts at getting people
registered to vote (what some
consider the most important
work) and at making plans for the
fall.
Teach-ins on canvassing
methods will be part of fall
activities, Goldberg said, in
preparation for massive student
efforts in behalf of endorsed
candidates.
The heaviest concentration of
work will come in the Oct.
20-Nov. 3 period, the two-week
college recess for political work
included in the Princeton plan and
endorsed by the Stanford faculty
senate.
Goldberg claims that students
"could do a lot more" by working
in organized activities, such as

those coordinated by the
Movement, than as individuals.
In addition to collecting and
distributing the volunteer
information, the Movement is
gathering information on
registration, district voting
patterns, and incumbent's voting
records on key Indochina and civil
rights issues.
Movement information also
says professional advertising
experts, described as
"sympathetic to our Movement"
have been contacted to create a
national campaign package
available to peace candidates.
Vietnam Moratorium leader
John Kramer reported that he has
helped organize a group that plans
to get 150 "interns" to do
community work through the
summer and fall.
The group will focus on
California Senate and Assembly
campaigns as well as Congressional
races.
Stanford's Movement office is
the coordinating center for
California schools, and is
headquartered at 549 Salvatierra
(x 4066, 4708 or 326-1303).

summer work and planning for
the fall may begin.
Pascoe explained that the
gathering of this volunteer
information is the first step in the

Movement's plans. The second
phase will be local meetings to
select which candidates they will
endorse.
Marshall Goldberg, a Stanford
law student and a local organizer,
outlined three phases of the
Movement's activities, the summer
plan, fall plan and the period from
October 20 to November 3.
Work during the summer will
include efforts at getting people
registered to vote (what some
consider the most important
work) and at making plans for the
fall.
Teach-ins on canvassing
methods will be part of fall
activities, Goldberg said, in
preparation for massive student
efforts in behalf of endorsed
candidates.
The heaviest concentration of
work will come in the Oct.
20-Nov. 3 period, the two-week
college recess for political work
included in the Princeton plan and
endorsed by the Stanford faculty
senate.
Goldberg claims that students
"could do a lot more" by working
in organized activities, such as

those coordinated by the
Movement, than as individuals.
In addition to collecting and
distributing the volunteer
information, the Movement is
gathering information on
registration, district voting
patterns, and incumbent's voting
records on key Indochina and civil
rights issues.
Movement information also
says professional advertising
experts, described as
"sympathetic to our Movement"
have been contacted to create a
national campaign package
available to peace candidates.
Vietnam Moratorium leader
John Kramer reported that he has
helped organize a group that plans
to get 150 "interns" to do
community work through the
summer and fall.
The group will focus on
California Senate and Assembly
campaigns as well as Congressional
races.
Stanford's Movement office is
the coordinating center for
California schools, and is
headquartered at 549 Salvatierra
(x 4066, 4708 or 326-1303).
Plans for national and local
efforts to elect peace candidates
in the fall wore discussed Saturday
at the first regional meeting of the
Movement for a New Congress.
About 80 people, representing
'26 California schools, attended
the meeting, the first step in
setting up structures for political
action.
The Movement sought to
establish ''horizontal
communication" between colleges
and local groups at the first
meeting.
The aim of the national
Movement is "to mobilize and
coordinate the national student
population to work at the 'grass
roots' level."
Bill Pascoe, a Harvard law
student and a California organizer
for the Movement said work on
the project started after the
Washington march on May 9.
People, he said, "wanted to build
to channel" student energies into
changing the existing
Congressional make-up.
Pascoe said leaders wanted to
organize "a national, McCarthy
type effort" to elect "peace

c°.ndidat o "" to Congress in the
November elections, getting
students tc spend their summer
and fall working for such
candidates.
The Movement started at
several Eastern schools, and
Princeton has emerged as the
coordinating center for the
national program. There are now
400 Movement chapters
nationwide, at colleges with a
total student body of 1.6 million.
An information form, already
distributed at Stanford, has been
prepared for students to tell what
work they can do for the
Movement and when.
These forms are now being
collected on campuses and will be
sent to Princeton. MIT computers
will then organize the information
and list student volunteers by area
(using postal Zip Codes as
classifications).
The lists will be distributed to
local chapters by mid-June so
summer work and planning for
the fall may begin.
