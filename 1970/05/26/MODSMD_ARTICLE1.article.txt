# Alumni React Angrily To Recent Violence
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Alumni contributions may be affected
substantially for the first time by a backlash
reaction to this spring's campus violence,
according to Stanford Alumni Association
President Robert Levison Jr.
Spring radical actions for the past few years
have triggered angry letters from alumni
threatening to withdraw support. However,
University officials have discounted most such
responses in the past as those of apathetic alumni
"who haven't given a penny in years."
But Levison said, "The real friends of Stanford
are the ones who are now taking the time to
complain."
Levison, an Atherton insurance broker,
explained that the "names and positions" of
alumni writing this spring to denounce campus
violence indicate they include major contributors.
The May Alumni Almanac published a full-page
letter from Levison denouncing radical violence
but maintaining that a drop in alumni support will
"play into the hands of that tiny group of
provocateurs" out to destroy Stanford.
Heavy Response
The open letter adjoined a blank page, which
alumni were asked to mail in with their comments.
Although the letters have not yet been reviewed,
Levison said receipt of over 150 such letters a day

is another indication of unprecedented alumni
concern over this spring's conflicts.
Levison, a 1948 economics graduate, said most
alumni were firmly against "needless physical
destruction," but were less united in reactions
against such issues as student strikes or campus
opposition to the Cambodian invasion.
He said he was personally not opposed to

"noncoercive" student strikes, "as long as people
who want to attend class always have (that) right."
While on campus last weekend for a regular
Alumni Association board meeting Levison refused
to speak out on Cambodia or other national issues
as an officer of the organization.
Communications Gaps
There are communications gaps between
students and alumni, the alumni chief
acknowledged, but he said his personal efforts to
keep in touch with student opinion have ranged
from "having Pat Shea over to dinner" to
attending a number of radical meetings on campus.
He was convinced a drop in alumni support
would "play into the hands" of radicals after
listening to Jim Shoch speak at a rally in the Old

News Analysis

Union courtyard. Shoch had suggested radical
action could result in various financial losses that
would bring the Universit"to its knees."
Levison's open letter had advocated harder line
against campus violence. He suggested those
inciting or participating in a riot should "face an
immediate change in their University status. These
people do not belong in a university community."

He explained in a Daily interview that he would
advocate summary suspensions or expulsions
outside of campus judicial processes in emergency
situations when "those judicial processes make
folly of the event."
He recommended calling in police sooner,
"using the strongest legal measures" before
situations are already out of control.
The letter also indicated firmer faculty reaction
"might well include discouraging individual faculty
members from utterances which are irresponsible."
Levison conceded he had radical English
Professor Bruce Franklin in mind when he had
written the statement. He added the
discouragement could involve "failing to promote
him" and "peer group pressure."

Most alumni support the administration,
according to Levison, who conceded there were
"Oust Pitzer" rumors among some alumni factions
but said such discontent is not widespread.
Levison defended the alumni's right to
participate in campus policy-making because of
their concern "that the university continue to be
an ongoing institution."
He said the role of alumnus is important
because "you're an alumnus longer than you're
anything else on this campus."
On the other hand, Levison said he would
welcome a generation of alumni "who would put
their money up no matter what the university is
like."
'Stanford's Sons'
He added skeptically, "I just want to see the
generation that does it."
The open letter ended with a call for support
from Stanford's "sons and daughters." Asked
about the sentimental image of Stanford as a
parent, Levison told the student reporter, "When
you're out ten or fifteen years, you'll think that
way, too„"
He said an alumnus would not be as upset if his
high school were "trashed," but that Stanford is
an institution which evokes "real love and
devotion."

He recommended calling in police sooner,
"using the strongest legal measures" before
situations are already out of control.
The letter also indicated firmer faculty reaction
"might well include discouraging individual faculty
members from utterances which are irresponsible."
Levison conceded he had radical English
Professor Bruce Franklin in mind when he had
written the statement. He added the
discouragement could involve "failing to promote
him" and "peer group pressure."

Most alumni support the administration,
according to Levison, who conceded there were
"Oust Pitzer" rumors among some alumni factions
but said such discontent is not widespread.
Levison defended the alumni's right to
participate in campus policy-making because of
their concern "that the university continue to be
an ongoing institution."
He said the role of alumnus is important
because "you're an alumnus longer than you're
anything else on this campus."
On the other hand, Levison said he would
welcome a generation of alumni "who would put
their money up no matter what the university is
like."
'Stanford's Sons'
He added skeptically, "I just want to see the
generation that does it."
The open letter ended with a call for support
from Stanford's "sons and daughters." Asked
about the sentimental image of Stanford as a
parent, Levison told the student reporter, "When
you're out ten or fifteen years, you'll think that
way, too„"
He said an alumnus would not be as upset if his
high school were "trashed," but that Stanford is
an institution which evokes "real love and
devotion."
Alumni contributions may be affected
substantially for the first time by a backlash
reaction to this spring's campus violence,
according to Stanford Alumni Association
President Robert Levison Jr.
Spring radical actions for the past few years
have triggered angry letters from alumni
threatening to withdraw support. However,
University officials have discounted most such
responses in the past as those of apathetic alumni
"who haven't given a penny in years."
But Levison said, "The real friends of Stanford
are the ones who are now taking the time to
complain."
Levison, an Atherton insurance broker,
explained that the "names and positions" of
alumni writing this spring to denounce campus
violence indicate they include major contributors.
The May Alumni Almanac published a full-page
letter from Levison denouncing radical violence
but maintaining that a drop in alumni support will
"play into the hands of that tiny group of
provocateurs" out to destroy Stanford.
Heavy Response
The open letter adjoined a blank page, which
alumni were asked to mail in with their comments.
Although the letters have not yet been reviewed,
Levison said receipt of over 150 such letters a day

is another indication of unprecedented alumni
concern over this spring's conflicts.
Levison, a 1948 economics graduate, said most
alumni were firmly against "needless physical
destruction," but were less united in reactions
against such issues as student strikes or campus
opposition to the Cambodian invasion.
He said he was personally not opposed to

"noncoercive" student strikes, "as long as people
who want to attend class always have (that) right."
While on campus last weekend for a regular
Alumni Association board meeting Levison refused
to speak out on Cambodia or other national issues
as an officer of the organization.
Communications Gaps
There are communications gaps between
students and alumni, the alumni chief
acknowledged, but he said his personal efforts to
keep in touch with student opinion have ranged
from "having Pat Shea over to dinner" to
attending a number of radical meetings on campus.
He was convinced a drop in alumni support
would "play into the hands" of radicals after
listening to Jim Shoch speak at a rally in the Old

News Analysis

Union courtyard. Shoch had suggested radical
action could result in various financial losses that
would bring the Universit"to its knees."
Levison's open letter had advocated harder line
against campus violence. He suggested those
inciting or participating in a riot should "face an
immediate change in their University status. These
people do not belong in a university community."

He explained in a Daily interview that he would
advocate summary suspensions or expulsions
outside of campus judicial processes in emergency
situations when "those judicial processes make
folly of the event."
He recommended calling in police sooner,
"using the strongest legal measures" before
situations are already out of control.
The letter also indicated firmer faculty reaction
"might well include discouraging individual faculty
