# Journey In Lebanon
## Traditional Values Remain 
### Judith Caroll 
In my* last article I said that I would like to tell you something of
my village, Fih, which is a Greek Orthodox village in the rugged slopes
of the olive producing Kura district of North Lebanon. Several roads
lead into Fih and come to a junction by a center front village square,
which serves as a marbles and volleyball playground for the children, a
cafeteria for the donkeys, and a shortcut for the people.
Smaller roads ond paths branch off and wind up the village hills,
leading to the houses, which are either tan stone with red tile roofs or
modern looking reinforced concrete dwellings. The former frequently
have characteristically curved interior walls, while the latter display
protruding metal rods which both support the structure and await
future additions.
Even before dawn the land-devoted peasants arp up and walking or
riding donkeys the long distance to their carefully tended fields,
which characteristically enough, are frequently the legal property of
relatives in America. One time this fall I accompanied my cousin
down to his father's fields to help gather the ripe olives.
For those of you who have never harvested olives, the process used
here consists of laying burlap under the trees and then shaking the
branches by hand or stick so that the olives will fall into the burlap.
Though wielding a stick, I unfortunately seemed to perform the
function of stepping on the small black and green orbs more than
anything else. When it dawned on me that I was on the wrong side of
the sexual division of labor fence, I switched to helping the old man's
wife move around on haunches picking up stray olives. It seemed that
every gesture I made met with a round of unwarranted praise.
What I have just presented is an idyll that within one generation has
been relegated to the past. My cousin and his peers are highly
educated and hold jobs outside the village. Only at harvest is an

occasional token gesture made toward the land by these sons of men
for whom the land was a way of life. Manual labor is now being done
by Syrian laborers, which further undermines the prestige of such
endeavor.
Yet traditional values remain. To be Arab still means to spend long
hours in alternately being host and guest and Arabic is still a
mesmerizing, highly oral language which verbally matches the Arab
character.
Involved in both is the ideal-practice dichotomy. Classical Arabic is
organized on Aristotelian principles and in its manipulation of rhythm
to form words from base words it has an eloquent and fluid beauty.
Colloquial Arabic is in some ways a reworked Classical and in other
ways just plain different. I find it extremely hard to pick up and a
frustrating barrier to communication.
Arabic is a social language and goes with evening visiting patterns
just as the delicious Lebanese arak, an anise -flavored grape wine
known as "lion's milk", goes with raw or roasted meat. Raw meat is
served in chunks or in a pounded paste of meat and cracked wheat.
While most women still use a large mortar and pestle to pound the
lamb, one occasionally hears the ominous whir of an electric blender
emanating from the kitchen area. From the kitchen also comes the
steaming Turkish coffee which is served to guests after extended
greetings have been exchanged and everyone seated in the inevitable
circle of soft chairs found in the parlor of every house. Besides coffee,
the guest is usually offered a cool drink, nuts, candy, and cigarettes.
Refusals are difficult.
