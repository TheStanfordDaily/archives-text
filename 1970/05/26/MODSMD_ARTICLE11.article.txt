# Down Over 20 Points
## Dick And Dow 
### Art Buchwald 
"IF I HAD ANY MONEY, I'D BE BUYING
STOCKS NOW," PRESIDENT NIXON SAID ON
APRIL 28, 1970.
Since the President uttered those immortal
words, the Dow Jones industrial average has
nose-dived well below 700 points. The opinion of
most experts on Wall Street is that if Mr. Nixon
had invested in the market on April 28, he would
be jumping out of the window of his White House
bedroom this morning.
A haggard investment analyst told me, "The
only thing the President could have made money
on since April 28 is Cambodian railroad bonds."
"Why do you think the President went out on a
limb like that?"
"He was trying to restore faith in the stock
market."
"Why did he fail?"
Double Thinking
"Any time the President of the United States
takes time out to buck up the market, Wall Street
panics. After his statement, everyone said, 'Why
would he say something like that unless the
country was really in bad shape?"
"Then you think the President could have done
more if he'd said, 'If I had any money I would sell
all my stocks'?"
"If he had said that, I believe Dow .tones would
have gone through the roof."
"Surely the President must have known that by
making his statement of April 28, he would have
caused the market to go down."
Wall Street Gap
"Not true. Since the President has been in the
White House, there has been a communications
gap between himself and Wall Street. The
President is so protected by his White House staff
that he has no idea what is happening in the
financial world. He believes the people who are

doing all the selling on the street are a small
minority of malcontents, troublemakers and bums.
He has no idea that it's really Middle America
that's causing the stock market to go down."
"Why in heaven's name doesn't someone tell
him?" I cried.
Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans tried to
see the Resident to tell him but he wasn't
successful, so he wrote his now famous letter."
"The one that was leaked to the press?"
No Representation
"That's it. The one that began, 'I believe this
Administration finds itself today embracing a
philosophy which appears to lack appropriate
concern for the attitude of a great mass of
Americans .. . those people who fiddle in the
stock market..."
"That letter had a tremendous effect on the
President, didn't it?"
"Well, it came as a shock to him and after it was
published the President agreed to see the head of
the Chase Manhattan Bank. The head told him
that unless the President took back his words
about buying stocks, the Dow Jones could go
below 500."
"What was the President's reaction to that?"
M,L,P,F, & S
"He expressed concern. That night he couldn't
sleep so early in the morning the President and his
valet went up to Lincoln Memorial where they saw
several brokers from Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
and Smith sleeping on the stone steps. He woke
them up and told them he understood their
problems, and he tried to explain to them why he
made his decision to announce that if he had any
money he would buy stocks."
"Did they understand?" I asked.
"Let's say they listened, but they didn't
promise him a ticker tape parade in New York this
year."

White House, there has been a communications
gap between himself and Wall Street. The
President is so protected by his White House staff
that he has no idea what is happening in the
financial world. He believes the people who are

doing all the selling on the street are a small
minority of malcontents, troublemakers and bums.
He has no idea that it's really Middle America
that's causing the stock market to go down."
"Why in heaven's name doesn't someone tell
him?" I cried.
Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans tried to
see the Resident to tell him but he wasn't
successful, so he wrote his now famous letter."
"The one that was leaked to the press?"
No Representation
"That's it. The one that began, 'I believe this
Administration finds itself today embracing a
philosophy which appears to lack appropriate
concern for the attitude of a great mass of
Americans .. . those people who fiddle in the
stock market..."
"That letter had a tremendous effect on the
President, didn't it?"
"Well, it came as a shock to him and after it was
published the President agreed to see the head of
the Chase Manhattan Bank. The head told him
that unless the President took back his words
about buying stocks, the Dow Jones could go
below 500."
"What was the President's reaction to that?"
M,L,P,F, & S
"He expressed concern. That night he couldn't
sleep so early in the morning the President and his
valet went up to Lincoln Memorial where they saw
several brokers from Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
and Smith sleeping on the stone steps. He woke
them up and told them he understood their
problems, and he tried to explain to them why he
made his decision to announce that if he had any
money he would buy stocks."
"Did they understand?" I asked.
"Let's say they listened, but they didn't
promise him a ticker tape parade in New York this
year."
"IF I HAD ANY MONEY, I'D BE BUYING
STOCKS NOW," PRESIDENT NIXON SAID ON
APRIL 28, 1970.
Since the President uttered those immortal
words, the Dow Jones industrial average has
nose-dived well below 700 points. The opinion of
most experts on Wall Street is that if Mr. Nixon
had invested in the market on April 28, he would
be jumping out of the window of his White House
bedroom this morning.
A haggard investment analyst told me, "The
only thing the President could have made money
on since April 28 is Cambodian railroad bonds."
"Why do you think the President went out on a
limb like that?"
"He was trying to restore faith in the stock
market."
"Why did he fail?"
Double Thinking
"Any time the President of the United States
takes time out to buck up the market, Wall Street
panics. After his statement, everyone said, 'Why
would he say something like that unless the
country was really in bad shape?"
"Then you think the President could have done
more if he'd said, 'If I had any money I would sell
all my stocks'?"
"If he had said that, I believe Dow .tones would
have gone through the roof."
"Surely the President must have known that by
making his statement of April 28, he would have
caused the market to go down."
