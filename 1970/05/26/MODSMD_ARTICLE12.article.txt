Another bay bridge? God help
us!
An extremely dangerous
proposals comes before the
California State Legislature this
week.
Conservation-minded citizens
are vigorously opposing the
"Southern Crossing," a new
bridge which would be built
several miles south of the San
Francisco Bay Bridge.
Why is this proposal so
dangerous?
First, experts on the
environment agree that it will
significantly increase SMOG in the
Bay Area.
Secondly, it will create
problems for the Bayside-Hunters
Point ghetto. It will cause tragic
displacement of poor people, and
will provide no solution to their
problems of unemployment and
local transportation.
Third, the Southern Crossing
will destroy the primary sailing
and recreation areas along the
South Bay.
Finally, it could change a
working septic tank —the South

Bay -into a STINKING CESS
POOL.
The Southern Crossing must be
stopped now! The bill has a good
chance of sneaking through the
legislature unless you oppose it.
Write your state legislator
today. Don't let the concrete
pourers ruin our Bay Area
environment!
For further information about
what you can do to help, please
call Bernie Wolf, 327-2920
(x 1423).

What Is Damage ?
Editor, The Daily:
There seems to be an
inconsistency in the reporting on
strike and disruption damages and
the efforts taken to control the
persons committing the acts of
disruption. In the DAILY for May
21, I read that the quarter's loss is
estimated at $580,000, with
direct expenses amounting to
$240,000 and most of the
remainder stemming from salaries
paid to employees who were
unable to enter their offices. This
means that most of over $340,000
was lost because of blocking
doorways, harassment, etc. What
has been euphemistically called
"non-violent" disruption actually
cost the University more in dollars
than the "violent" disruption of
breaking windows and defacing
property.
During the period from one
o'clock on May 1 until the time
that the President closed the
University the following Friday, I
was detained outside Encina some
of the time and working

("illegally", the students told me)
the rest of the time. I saw
students blocking the various
entrances and windows and I
talked with a number of them,
both outside and in my office. At
no time did I see any attempt
made by the administration to
identify these students; I saw
no-one asking names or taking
pictures. And yet President Pitzer
told an alumni group recently,
"At the same time, we tried to
identify as best we could those
actually engaged in law-breaking,
for charges cannot be lodged
against individuals who simply
walk around the campus or who
look suspicious." These students
were not "acting under cover of
darkness," as he suggested was the
case with those who were causing,
the damage. Perhaps the loss of
$340,000 in salaries is not
considered damage?

Summer Canvass
Editor, The Daily:
In the weeks immediately
following President Nixon's
decision to enter Cambodia it
became glaringly apparent that
while student dissent had spread
to campuses across the nation, the
effect of these initial outbursts of
protest was scarcely felt beyond
the university and its immediate
environs. In response to this
dilemma many campuses have
moved their activities into nearby
communities and in addition,
organizations have emerged to
co-ordinate the activities of
students in their home towns
during the summer months.
Yet it is our feeling that several

significant gaps remain. One
primary example is that of small
towns in rural areas which ma>
frequently be distant from
universities and therefore remain
largely untouched by protest
activity.
To meet this need we propose
to send small caravans of students
into such towns for the primary
purpose of opening avenues of
communication. The focus will be
talking, whether it be on a
one-to-one basis or in meetings
and rallies of varying sizes.
Drawing on the imagination of the
participants we hope also to
supplement our verbal contact
with relevant theatrical and
musical performances.
We do not intend, as a group,
to formally engage in electoral
campaigning; rather we'shall focus
on the core issues of peace,
racism, and the environment. In
this way we expect to inhibit the
feeling of "outsiders telling us
what to do."
Freeing ourselves from direct
electoral orientation will also
enable us to draw on the support
of a broad segment of students
opposed to the war, from
moderates to radicals. Here, we
must again emphasize that all
participants, for the numerous
obvious reasons, will be
committed solely to the tactics of
basic communication.
This task can be greatly
facilitated by contacting
numerous local organizations
prior to the arrival of the caravans
and by extensive orientation
programs for the students
involved. We have no Utopian
illusions of changing the views of
the majority of the people in
these towns; rather we hope to
create a basis of understanding
between the members of these
communities and the participants
in the caravans.
We urge all interested students
to come to the meeting tonight in
the Tresidder Large Lounge at
7:30.

and rallies of varying sizes.
Drawing on the imagination of the
participants we hope also to
supplement our verbal contact
with relevant theatrical and
musical performances.
We do not intend, as a group,
to formally engage in electoral
campaigning; rather we'shall focus
on the core issues of peace,
racism, and the environment. In
this way we expect to inhibit the
feeling of "outsiders telling us
what to do."
Freeing ourselves from direct
electoral orientation will also
enable us to draw on the support
of a broad segment of students
opposed to the war, from
moderates to radicals. Here, we
must again emphasize that all
participants, for the numerous
obvious reasons, will be
committed solely to the tactics of
basic communication.
This task can be greatly
facilitated by contacting
numerous local organizations
prior to the arrival of the caravans
and by extensive orientation
programs for the students
involved. We have no Utopian
illusions of changing the views of
the majority of the people in
these towns; rather we hope to
create a basis of understanding
between the members of these
communities and the participants
in the caravans.
We urge all interested students
to come to the meeting tonight in
the Tresidder Large Lounge at
7:30.

Another bay bridge? God help
us!
An extremely dangerous
proposals comes before the
California State Legislature this
week.
Conservation-minded citizens
are vigorously opposing the
"Southern Crossing," a new
bridge which would be built
several miles south of the San
Francisco Bay Bridge.
Why is this proposal so
dangerous?
First, experts on the
environment agree that it will
significantly increase SMOG in the
Bay Area.
Secondly, it will create
problems for the Bayside-Hunters
Point ghetto. It will cause tragic
displacement of poor people, and
will provide no solution to their
problems of unemployment and
local transportation.
Third, the Southern Crossing
will destroy the primary sailing
and recreation areas along the
South Bay.
Finally, it could change a
working septic tank —the South

Bay -into a STINKING CESS
POOL.
The Southern Crossing must be
stopped now! The bill has a good
chance of sneaking through the
legislature unless you oppose it.
Write your state legislator
today. Don't let the concrete
pourers ruin our Bay Area
environment!
For further information about
what you can do to help, please
call Bernie Wolf, 327-2920
(x 1423).

What Is Damage ?
Editor, The Daily:
There seems to be an
inconsistency in the reporting on
strike and disruption damages and
the efforts taken to control the
persons committing the acts of
disruption. In the DAILY for May
21, I read that the quarter's loss is
estimated at $580,000, with
direct expenses amounting to
$240,000 and most of the
remainder stemming from salaries
paid to employees who were
unable to enter their offices. This
means that most of over $340,000
was lost because of blocking
doorways, harassment, etc. What
has been euphemistically called
"non-violent" disruption actually
cost the University more in dollars
than the "violent" disruption of
breaking windows and defacing
property.
During the period from one
o'clock on May 1 until the time
that the President closed the
University the following Friday, I
was detained outside Encina some
of the time and working

("illegally", the students told me)
the rest of the time. I saw
students blocking the various
entrances and windows and I
talked with a number of them,
both outside and in my office. At
no time did I see any attempt
made by the administration to
identify these students; I saw
no-one asking names or taking
pictures. And yet President Pitzer
told an alumni group recently,
"At the same time, we tried to
identify as best we could those
actually engaged in law-breaking,
for charges cannot be lodged
against individuals who simply
walk around the campus or who
look suspicious." These students
were not "acting under cover of
darkness," as he suggested was the
case with those who were causing,
the damage. Perhaps the loss of
$340,000 in salaries is not
considered damage?

Editor, The Daily:
In the weeks immediately
following President Nixon's
decision to enter Cambodia it
became glaringly apparent that
while student dissent had spread
to campuses across the nation, the
effect of these initial outbursts of
protest was scarcely felt beyond
the university and its immediate
environs. In response to this
dilemma many campuses have
moved their activities into nearby
communities and in addition,
organizations have emerged to
co-ordinate the activities of
students in their home towns
during the summer months.
Yet it is our feeling that several

significant gaps remain. One
primary example is that of small
towns in rural areas which ma>
frequently be distant from
universities and therefore remain
largely untouched by protest
activity.
To meet this need we propose
to send small caravans of students
into such towns for the primary
purpose of opening avenues of
communication. The focus will be
talking, whether it be on a
one-to-one basis or in meetings
and rallies of varying sizes.
Drawing on the imagination of the
participants we hope also to

actually engaged in law-breaking,
for charges cannot be lodged
against individuals who simply
walk around the campus or who
look suspicious." These students
were not "acting under cover of
darkness," as he suggested was the
case with those who were causing,
the damage. Perhaps the loss of
$340,000 in salaries is not
considered damage?

Summer Canvass
Editor, The Daily:
In the weeks immediately
following President Nixon's
decision to enter Cambodia it
became glaringly apparent that
while student dissent had spread
to campuses across the nation, the
effect of these initial outbursts of
protest was scarcely felt beyond
the university and its immediate
environs. In response to this
dilemma many campuses have
moved their activities into nearby
communities and in addition,
organizations have emerged to
co-ordinate the activities of
students in their home towns
during the summer months.
Yet it is our feeling that several

significant gaps remain. One
primary example is that of small
towns in rural areas which ma>
frequently be distant from
universities and therefore remain
largely untouched by protest
activity.
To meet this need we propose
to send small caravans of students
into such towns for the primary
purpose of opening avenues of
communication. The focus will be
talking, whether it be on a
one-to-one basis or in meetings
and rallies of varying sizes.
Drawing on the imagination of the
participants we hope also to
supplement our verbal contact
with relevant theatrical and
musical performances.
We do not intend, as a group,
to formally engage in electoral
campaigning; rather we'shall focus
on the core issues of peace,
racism, and the environment. In
this way we expect to inhibit the
feeling of "outsiders telling us
what to do."
Freeing ourselves from direct
electoral orientation will also
enable us to draw on the support
of a broad segment of students
opposed to the war, from
moderates to radicals. Here, we
must again emphasize that all
participants, for the numerous
obvious reasons, will be
committed solely to the tactics of
basic communication.
This task can be greatly
facilitated by contacting
numerous local organizations
prior to the arrival of the caravans
and by extensive orientation
programs for the students
involved. We have no Utopian
illusions of changing the views of
the majority of the people in
these towns; rather we hope to
create a basis of understanding
between the members of these
communities and the participants
in the caravans.
We urge all interested students
to come to the meeting tonight in
the Tresidder Large Lounge at
7:30.

Ban The Span
Editor, The Daily:
Another bay bridge? God help
us!
An extremely dangerous
proposals comes before the
California State Legislature this
week.
Conservation-minded citizens
are vigorously opposing the
"Southern Crossing," a new
bridge which would be built
several miles south of the San
Francisco Bay Bridge.
Why is this proposal so
dangerous?
First, experts on the
environment agree that it will
significantly increase SMOG in the
Bay Area.
Secondly, it will create
problems for the Bayside-Hunters
Point ghetto. It will cause tragic
displacement of poor people, and
will provide no solution to their
problems of unemployment and
local transportation.
Third, the Southern Crossing
will destroy the primary sailing
and recreation areas along the
South Bay.
Finally, it could change a
working septic tank —the South

Bay -into a STINKING CESS
POOL.
The Southern Crossing must be
stopped now! The bill has a good
chance of sneaking through the
legislature unless you oppose it.
Write your state legislator
today. Don't let the concrete
pourers ruin our Bay Area
environment!
For further information about
what you can do to help, please
call Bernie Wolf, 327-2920
(x 1423).

What Is Damage ?
Editor, The Daily:
There seems to be an
inconsistency in the reporting on
strike and disruption damages and
the efforts taken to control the
persons committing the acts of
disruption. In the DAILY for May
21, I read that the quarter's loss is
estimated at $580,000, with
direct expenses amounting to
$240,000 and most of the
remainder stemming from salaries
paid to employees who were
unable to enter their offices. This
means that most of over $340,000
was lost because of blocking
doorways, harassment, etc. What
has been euphemistically called
"non-violent" disruption actually
cost the University more in dollars
than the "violent" disruption of
breaking windows and defacing
property.
During the period from one
o'clock on May 1 until the time
that the President closed the
University the following Friday, I
was detained outside Encina some
of the time and working

("illegally", the students told me)
the rest of the time. I saw
students blocking the various
entrances and windows and I
talked with a number of them,
both outside and in my office. At
no time did I see any attempt
made by the administration to
identify these students; I saw
no-one asking names or taking
pictures. And yet President Pitzer
told an alumni group recently,
"At the same time, we tried to
identify as best we could those
actually engaged in law-breaking,
for charges cannot be lodged
against individuals who simply
walk around the campus or who
look suspicious." These students
were not "acting under cover of
darkness," as he suggested was the
case with those who were causing,
the damage. Perhaps the loss of
$340,000 in salaries is not
considered damage?
