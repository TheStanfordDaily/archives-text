Secretaries

The students are on strike; the professors are on
strike; but are the secretaries on strike!
All over the campus are statements and bulletins
prepared beautifully by the secretarial staff at the
request of both students and professors. But does
this mean the secretarial staff approves the use of
paid time to aid and abet students and faculty in
proving a point that they may or may not
espouse? We doubt it.
What would happen if the secretarial staff
reminds both faculty and students that their
employment does not include the job of producing
propaganda expressing only one point of view
what would happen if all the secretaries refused
and went on strike? Would they lose their jobs and
their pay?
The faculty loses niether pay nor job; students
are neither suspended or expelled, nor are pay
checks or fellowship checks withheld. The great
number of secretaries do not have a spokesman -
they are neither seen or heard - but they do keep
the University running. Are their opinions, their
needs, their desires to be expressed, or are they to
remain unheard and unseen?
Second-Class Citizens
Secretaries are expected to correct the grammar,
the rhetoric, the text of material provided by the
teaching staff. But a secretary may not speak out,
may not refuse to accept work which she feels is
contrary to the job for which she was hired. She is
not on strike; she is expected to be at her desk and
at the services of those on strike. Isn't this
somewhat ridiculous, and doesn't this again put
secretaries into the position of "second-class
citizens."
When a student tells a secretary (while
practicing continuous informational dialogue) that
because he is a student of history or political
science he knows the answers - what does the
secretary do! Does she bow to his vast reservoir of
knowledge and lack of experience, or does she
remind the student that she, unlike the student,
has lived history and has involved herself in
politics.

What would happen if the secretary remindec
some of the students that "Cleanliness is next ti
Godliness." What does just plain dirt have to d<
with removing ourselves from Vietnam o
Cambodia?
We dislike war and rumors of war as much as dc
the students and faculty, but we do not claim tc
have all the answers. Unlike the students ant
faculty we are not given to making absolut<
pronouncements based on inexperience and new
headlines. Nor are we totally unwilling to listen tc
opinions opposite from our own - we are no
given to shouting down other peoples' ideas, no
do we throw rocks to make a point.
Perhaps it is time for secretaries to go on strik<
against the things they abhor, and against tin
ignorance of those for whom they provide sc
many services without recognition. Wo are needec
and used, and we are not represented in decision
affecting our own security and future. Most of u
are not interested in "unions" as such, but all of u:
we believe would like to be recognized as
something more than cogs in a well-oiled machine
Secretary's Reconservations
We would like the opportunity to speak out
without losing either jobs or pay - the same
opportunity given the faculty and the students. Wc
would like to see more of both sides of an issue
not just that represented by the Daily or in
classrooms. We would like to see headlines that arc
expressive of the article following not searc
headlines which have nothing to do with the ideas
expressed in the article itself. We know many
students quote directly from headlines and not
from the articles.
We would like to be heard, not threatened.
The humanists who talk over much of "hum.
dignity" and the "dignity of man" might
remember that secretaries are also human.
(This has not been signed not been use ire do
not wish to be known — but we have seen
examples of reprisals when secretaries wish to take
part in campus disruption activity (either for or
against), and we sec no reason to place ourselves in
jeopardy at this time.)

the rhetoric, the text of material provided by the
teaching staff. But a secretary may not speak out,
may not refuse to accept work which she feels is
contrary to the job for which she was hired. She is
not on strike; she is expected to be at her desk and
at the services of those on strike. Isn't this
somewhat ridiculous, and doesn't this again put
secretaries into the position of "second-class
citizens."
When a student tells a secretary (while
practicing continuous informational dialogue) that
because he is a student of history or political
science he knows the answers - what does the
secretary do! Does she bow to his vast reservoir of
knowledge and lack of experience, or does she
remind the student that she, unlike the student,
has lived history and has involved herself in
politics.

What would happen if the secretary remindec
some of the students that "Cleanliness is next ti
Godliness." What does just plain dirt have to d<
with removing ourselves from Vietnam o
Cambodia?
We dislike war and rumors of war as much as dc
the students and faculty, but we do not claim tc
have all the answers. Unlike the students ant
faculty we are not given to making absolut<
pronouncements based on inexperience and new
headlines. Nor are we totally unwilling to listen tc
opinions opposite from our own - we are no
given to shouting down other peoples' ideas, no
do we throw rocks to make a point.
Perhaps it is time for secretaries to go on strik<
against the things they abhor, and against tin
ignorance of those for whom they provide sc
many services without recognition. Wo are needec
and used, and we are not represented in decision
affecting our own security and future. Most of u
are not interested in "unions" as such, but all of u:
we believe would like to be recognized as
something more than cogs in a well-oiled machine
Secretary's Reconservations
We would like the opportunity to speak out
without losing either jobs or pay - the same
opportunity given the faculty and the students. Wc
would like to see more of both sides of an issue
not just that represented by the Daily or in
classrooms. We would like to see headlines that arc
expressive of the article following not searc
headlines which have nothing to do with the ideas
expressed in the article itself. We know many
students quote directly from headlines and not
from the articles.
We would like to be heard, not threatened.
The humanists who talk over much of "hum.
dignity" and the "dignity of man" might
remember that secretaries are also human.
(This has not been signed not been use ire do
not wish to be known — but we have seen
examples of reprisals when secretaries wish to take
part in campus disruption activity (either for or
against), and we sec no reason to place ourselves in
jeopardy at this time.)
A Group Of
Staff
Secretaries

The students are on strike; the professors are on
strike; but are the secretaries on strike!
All over the campus are statements and bulletins
prepared beautifully by the secretarial staff at the
request of both students and professors. But does
this mean the secretarial staff approves the use of
paid time to aid and abet students and faculty in
proving a point that they may or may not
espouse? We doubt it.
What would happen if the secretarial staff
reminds both faculty and students that their
employment does not include the job of producing
propaganda expressing only one point of view
what would happen if all the secretaries refused
and went on strike? Would they lose their jobs and
their pay?
The faculty loses niether pay nor job; students
are neither suspended or expelled, nor are pay
checks or fellowship checks withheld. The great
number of secretaries do not have a spokesman -
they are neither seen or heard - but they do keep
the University running. Are their opinions, their
needs, their desires to be expressed, or are they to
remain unheard and unseen?
