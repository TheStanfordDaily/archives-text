# Med School Faculty To Serve Livingston In Trial Program
## 
### 
Stirred into action by the
knowledge that the city's only
vphysician will soon be leaving,
citizens of this small Merced
County community last week
endorsed a plan that would
provide medical services to the
people in the area in partnership
with the Stanford University
School of Medicine.
The plan, developed by a
citizens committee representing a
cross-section of Livingston's
ethnic, social, and economic
groups, was described at a meeting
attended by 250 persons in
Livingston High School
Auditorium.
Under the proposal, two
doctors would be serving
Livingstort with 24-hour medical
care. Clinic facilities, now owned
by Dr. J.J. Wolohan, Livingston's
only family physician for more
than 25 years, could be leased and
operated by the community
through a nonprofit corporation.
The physicians—a specialist in
internal medicine and a
live in
Livingston, and in addition to
their clinical duties, will teach
medical and nursing students and
residents who will commute from
Stanford to augment the Clinic
staff. The physicians will be
faculty members of the Medical
School.
Staff appointments at the M.D.
level will be made by the Clinic's
board of directors from
candidates acceptable to the
Medical School for full-time
faculty appointments. The board,
composed of representatives from
more than 20 local organizations,
will guide Clinic operations and
set policy.
The clinic will be

self-supporting—it will charge fees
for services rendered, according to
Keith Winton, a local businessman
and member of the committee
that developed the proposal.
To help the project get started,
Area 111 of the California Regional
Medical Programs will provide
funds for the developmental phase
of the program. The local board
plans to initiate a fund drive in
Livingston to raise an additional
$25,000 needed, Winton said.
Clinic operations are expected
to begin in July, with assistance
from Stanford faculty and
students. Dr. Wolohan, presently a
resident in psychiatry at St.

Mary's Hospital in San Francisco,
will continue to commute to
Livingston to see patients as long
as the community remains
without a doctor, according to
Winton.
The community will assume
responsibility for the Clinic
September 1, and a committee
will soon begin work on financial
and legal aspects of the transition
of the health clinic from a private
to a community operation by a
nonprofit corporation.
Joe Alvernaz, a local resident
noted: "This is the most
important thing to happen in
Livingston in a long time."

Stirred into action by the
knowledge that the city's only
vphysician will soon be leaving,
citizens of this small Merced
County community last week
endorsed a plan that would
provide medical services to the
people in the area in partnership
with the Stanford University
School of Medicine.
The plan, developed by a
citizens committee representing a
cross-section of Livingston's
ethnic, social, and economic
groups, was described at a meeting
attended by 250 persons in
Livingston High School
Auditorium.
Under the proposal, two
doctors would be serving
Livingstort with 24-hour medical
care. Clinic facilities, now owned
by Dr. J.J. Wolohan, Livingston's
only family physician for more
than 25 years, could be leased and
operated by the community
through a nonprofit corporation.
The physicians—a specialist in
internal medicine and a
live in
Livingston, and in addition to
their clinical duties, will teach
medical and nursing students and
residents who will commute from
Stanford to augment the Clinic
staff. The physicians will be
faculty members of the Medical
School.
Staff appointments at the M.D.
level will be made by the Clinic's
board of directors from
candidates acceptable to the
Medical School for full-time
faculty appointments. The board,
composed of representatives from
more than 20 local organizations,
will guide Clinic operations and
set policy.
The clinic will be

self-supporting—it will charge fees
for services rendered, according to
Keith Winton, a local businessman
and member of the committee
that developed the proposal.
To help the project get started,
Area 111 of the California Regional
Medical Programs will provide
funds for the developmental phase
of the program. The local board
plans to initiate a fund drive in
Livingston to raise an additional
$25,000 needed, Winton said.
Clinic operations are expected
to begin in July, with assistance
from Stanford faculty and
students. Dr. Wolohan, presently a
resident in psychiatry at St.

Mary's Hospital in San Francisco,
will continue to commute to
Livingston to see patients as long
as the community remains
without a doctor, according to
Winton.
The community will assume
responsibility for the Clinic
September 1, and a committee
will soon begin work on financial
and legal aspects of the transition
of the health clinic from a private
to a community operation by a
nonprofit corporation.
Joe Alvernaz, a local resident
noted: "This is the most
important thing to happen in
Livingston in a long time."


HUMOR, ALLEGORY, AND TRAGEDY will bv the themes of three one-act plays to be presented by the Afro American
Drama Workshop-102 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium this weekend. The poster above advertises the event "A Celebration of
Life." More information oil Ihe Celebration will be supplied later in the week in a DAILY.
