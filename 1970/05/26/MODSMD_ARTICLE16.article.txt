leave from his position since early
January. Last spring, he
underwent surgery for removal of
a benign brain tumor. While the
operation was a success, his
physician believes it is imperative
for him to concentrate i
restoration of his health.
Reporting to the annual
Alumni Assembly, Levison said
Pierce's request was accepted
"with deepest regret" by the
Alumni Board of Directors.

"He has lead our association
through a period of growth and
creativity unmatched in previous
years and the envy of all schools
in the country," Levison noted.
Under Pierce, the Association won
24 national awards for
outstanding and innovating
programs, including a White
House reception attended by the
President of the United States.
During his 14 years as director,
Pierce doubled association
membership to 33,000—the
highest percentage of voluntary
membership in any major
university alumni group. TTie
association acquired and now
operatees the Stanford Sierra
Camp, originated alumni colleges
on campus and overseas (in
Europe and Japan), and initiated
an Adxanced Management
College.
Pierce conceived of the idea for
The Stanford Observer, the
University's monthly newspaper,
and saw circulation of the
monthly Alumni Almanac rise
from 16,000 to 105,000. He also
helped initiate the first continuing
survey of alumni opinion, whose
results were reported this spring.
A member of the Stanford
Class of 1949, Pierce was named
assistant to the president of the
Alumni Association in September,
1956 and became director the
following year. Earlier, he worked
with the National Foundation for
Infantile Paralysis as national
director of organizations for men.
A search committee will begin
work immediately to find a new
director, with the objective of
filling the post by Sept. 1, Levison
said. He will head the group,
whose members will include: Mrs.
Jessie Gray Emanuel, Saratoga;
Roy P. Jackson, Los Angeles;
William F. Kartozian, San
Francisco; and Lyle M. Nelson,
Stanford, representing the
University.
Candidates who are interested
and others who have suggestions
are encouraged to contact any
member of the committee of
forward information to Robert M.
Levison Jr., chairman, Stanford
Alumni Association, Bowman
Alumni House, Stanford, Calif.
