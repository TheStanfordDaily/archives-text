# More Minority Students In Med School By '75
## 
### 
A medical education task force, headed by Associate Dean
Bernard W. Nelson of the School of Medicine, Thursday proposed a
series of steps through which the number of students from America's
minority groups in medical detree programs could be increased from
the present 2.8 per cent to 12 per cent by 1975.
The report, released by the Association of American Medical
Colleges in Washington, D.C., is an analysis and a series of
recommendations made by the task force to an Association
committee representing physicians, hospitals, minority groups, and
medical colleges.
Dr. John A.D. Cooper, president of the AAMC, said: "This analysis
shows how and where we have failed to attract or to keep in the
medical education system those minority students who are fully
qualified to become physicians. It gives us some new information to
help us with the critical problem of choice - how t6 select wisely
from among qualified applicants."
The report sets the following targets for minority student
representation in medical school:
Academic Year No. of Minority Students % Minority Students
Entering Med School of Total Students
1970-71 660 3.9%
1971-72 1000 5.3
1972-73 1200 7.1
1973-74 1400 8.9
1974-75 1600 10.6
1975-76 1800 11.9
Principal conclusions o*f the report are:
...the most important factors in retention of students during
premedical education are the availability of financial aid at the college
level and the student's perception if its availability at the medical
school level.
...the main barrier today for minority students in attending medical
school is the inadequacy of financial aid. Coincident with increasing
enrollment of minority students in medical schools, federal
government and other sources of funds have been decreasing.
...counseling should be directed to those efforts which will help the
student to fully realize his potential and to gain the confidence
needed to pursue a career in medicine.
...existing medical school class size represents the major obstacle for
increased production of physicians with the result that many capable
students are not permitted to study medicine. Increases in class sizes
are needed.
Based on these conclusions, the task force has recommended a
two-part financing program, a short-term solution being a single
national organization which would act as a central coordinating body
for the multiple sources of financial aid, and as a possible long-term
solution, the task force endorsed the concept of a educational
opportunity bank.
The latter would provide loans to all qualified medical students to
enable them to finance completely their educational costs at the
medical school of their choice, repayment to commence when the
student enters his professional career, based on an agreed percentage
of income.
The task force also recommended that a network of regional
centers be established to provide factual and personal information
about career opportunities for minority students in the health
professions.
Another information source for prospective medical students would
result from a recommended expansion of the AAMC Office for
Minority Student Affairs.
The report emphasized that this will not be an action program until
various institutions make decisions and go to work to make things
happen.
"We need action and we will need funds," said Dr. Cooper. "This
report is only a blueprint -- it tells us how to build. We need more
physicians in America and we need them to represent a democratic
cross-section of the qualified persons in various parts of our society."

premedical education are the availability of financial aid at the college
level and the student's perception if its availability at the medical
school level.
...the main barrier today for minority students in attending medical
school is the inadequacy of financial aid. Coincident with increasing
enrollment of minority students in medical schools, federal
government and other sources of funds have been decreasing.
...counseling should be directed to those efforts which will help the
student to fully realize his potential and to gain the confidence
needed to pursue a career in medicine.
...existing medical school class size represents the major obstacle for
increased production of physicians with the result that many capable
students are not permitted to study medicine. Increases in class sizes
are needed.
Based on these conclusions, the task force has recommended a
two-part financing program, a short-term solution being a single
national organization which would act as a central coordinating body
for the multiple sources of financial aid, and as a possible long-term
solution, the task force endorsed the concept of a educational
opportunity bank.
The latter would provide loans to all qualified medical students to
enable them to finance completely their educational costs at the
medical school of their choice, repayment to commence when the
student enters his professional career, based on an agreed percentage
of income.
The task force also recommended that a network of regional
centers be established to provide factual and personal information
about career opportunities for minority students in the health
professions.
Another information source for prospective medical students would
result from a recommended expansion of the AAMC Office for
Minority Student Affairs.
The report emphasized that this will not be an action program until
various institutions make decisions and go to work to make things
happen.
"We need action and we will need funds," said Dr. Cooper. "This
report is only a blueprint -- it tells us how to build. We need more
physicians in America and we need them to represent a democratic
cross-section of the qualified persons in various parts of our society."
A medical education task force, headed by Associate Dean
Bernard W. Nelson of the School of Medicine, Thursday proposed a
series of steps through which the number of students from America's
minority groups in medical detree programs could be increased from
the present 2.8 per cent to 12 per cent by 1975.
The report, released by the Association of American Medical
Colleges in Washington, D.C., is an analysis and a series of
recommendations made by the task force to an Association
committee representing physicians, hospitals, minority groups, and
medical colleges.
Dr. John A.D. Cooper, president of the AAMC, said: "This analysis
shows how and where we have failed to attract or to keep in the
medical education system those minority students who are fully
qualified to become physicians. It gives us some new information to
help us with the critical problem of choice - how t6 select wisely
from among qualified applicants."
The report sets the following targets for minority student
representation in medical school:
Academic Year No. of Minority Students % Minority Students
Entering Med School of Total Students
1970-71 660 3.9%
1971-72 1000 5.3
1972-73 1200 7.1
1973-74 1400 8.9
1974-75 1600 10.6
1975-76 1800 11.9
Principal conclusions o*f the report are:
...the most important factors in retention of students during
premedical education are the availability of financial aid at the college
level and the student's perception if its availability at the medical
school level.
