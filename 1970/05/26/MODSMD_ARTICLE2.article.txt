# Most Seniors Plan No Cap And Gown
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
President Pitzer issued a
statement Sunday discouraging
students and faculty from
abandoning their caps and gowns
at commencement June 14 in
protest over the U.S. policy in
Indochina.
Simultaneously, organizers of
No Cap and Gown announced
that apparently only 300 of the
1000 seniors currently intend to
wear caps and gowns during the
ceremony.
Spokesmen for No Cap and
Gown charged that Pitzer is trying
to undermine support for the
move to forego academic garb,
described as a symbolic gesture to
the'community and as a drive to
support nationally peace
candidates with rental refunds.
Pitzer said he expects to wear
his academic gown and urged that
faculty who march in the
procession do likewise. He noted
that the "tradition of academic
regalia goes back many centuries
and spans many political crises; it
symbolizes the devotion of the
University to the search for truth
regardless of political
consequences.
"I ask our graduates not to
deny themselves, their families
and their friends the full honors
they have won. Perhaps students
can find a way to contribute to
the political candidates of their
choice and to symbolize that fact
while still sharing fully in the
traditional commencement
ceremony."

In response to Pitzer's
announcement, Dixon Kelly, a
member of the No Cap and Gown
Committee stated, "Pitzer is
confusing the ceremony with the
education. Our gesture at
commencement does not detract
from the education we have
garnered at Stanford. The
commencement ceremony is a
dramatic event marking the
completion of a phase of
education and is appropriate for a
dramatic gesture of this kind.
Pitzer evidently wants us to deny
our political growth at the same
time celebrating our educational
growth. That is to deny the whole
man."
"We are surprised by President
Pitzer's statement since he seemed
much more flexible when we
talked to him, " said Barry
Ensminger member of No Cap and
Gown Committee. "His Cambodia
telegram to the President showed
that he can operate in a larger
context. Now when it comes to
subscribing to anything which has
a substantial chance of influencing
the war, he comes out strongly for
business as usual, for tradition."
"Our protest is not a rejection
of academic values, Ensminger
continued, "but is a rejection of
business as usual when monstrous
things are happening. We owe it to
ourselves our families and our
friends to get the war stopped. In
essence this is the fulfillment of
four years at Stanford."
