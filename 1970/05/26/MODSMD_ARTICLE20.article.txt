# Visual Statements Of Protest

Response to the Cambodia invasion of April 30th took numerous
visual forms in the academic communities. Despite the present calm
facade, many projects begun during the Strike continue with the same
intensity. One such project is the collection of protest art from
California campuses to be shown in Washington, D.C. in June.
The more than one hundred posters gathered from the silk-screen
presses of schools ranging from Berkeley, to Immaculate Heart, to
USC, present a variety of approaches to protest through the
visual—the very angry and aggressive, the calculated political appeal,
the pathetic and shocking, and the gentle and soft spoken.
Some students making posters advocate a more refined expression
than the hurried silk-screen on computer paper—to appeal to
"middle-America," while others deride the "student arrogance" which
produces esoteric posters and perpetuates the "we-they" categories.
Does the poster that screams speak only to the people who are
screaming with it?
Some students making posters question their viability as a
persuasive propaganda form and look for new ways of making them
expressive and more accurately aimed at their target audience.
Beyond posters, visual statements have taken the form of speedy
graffiti on construction walls and buildings —of a creative and outward
directed informative nature. Among the good graffiti there has also
been many pointless, self indulgent cliches scribbled on the inside of
buildings for the satisfaction only of the people who wrote them.

Many refined works of a lasting appeal have also come out of the
past two weeks in the form lithographs and drawings. TYiese are
personal expressions which affect their viewer on a different plane
than direct political assault.
From the deluge of posters, graffiti, films, handbills, T-shirts,
photographs, and armbands have emerged several images which have
come to symbolize the recent crisis. They are graphics which are
simple in design, easily recognized, and carry a powerful message.
The clenched fist over the word 'Strike', designed by a Foothill art
student was adopted by the National Student Strike Committee and
appeared on an infinite number of T-shirts across the country. Hie
changed tenor of the Movement is represented in the new official logo
designed by the same student—the fist grasping a peace symbol over
the word 'Unite'.
Another such image is the portion of a photograph from Kent State
showing a girl student kneeling over the dead body of a fellow
student. This has been reproduced on numerous posters ("Mom they
are killing us" serigraph from Immaculate Heart) and was on the cover
of last week's Newsweek magazine. The image from this photograph
will undoubtedly come increasingly to represent the student anti-war
movement.
Whatever the direction and technique, the academic anti-war
movement of Spring 1970 has left a powerful and lasting visual
statement.
