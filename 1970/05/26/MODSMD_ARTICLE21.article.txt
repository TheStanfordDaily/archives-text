# Lowenstein Warns Of Nation's Fear
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Fear and revolution is
producing a mood in the United
States which condones repressive
actions such as the Jackson
killings, a New York Congressman
said here Sunday.
AJlard Lowenstein, formerly
Stanford Poli Sci Lecturer
and now the Congressional
representative of the sth district
of New York, warned of a
"... mood which condones this
sort of action (the Jackson,
Mississippi shooting of two
blacks) on the grounds that there
will be some kind of bloody
takeover."
The Democratic congressman
who helped organize the Dump
Johnson movement of 1968 spoke
to about one hundred people in
Cubberly Auditorium Sunday
night. The speech was delayed 2Vt
hours when Lowenstein was
unable to make a scheduled 7:30
appearance.
Lowenstein emphasized that in
the current situation working
within the system is the surest
method of achieving reforms.
"Things would be tough if the
country wasn't willing to talk to
us," he said, "but the evidence
doesn't point towards that.
"In 1968 we won in Nebraska,
Indiana, Wisconsin, New
Hampshire, and convinced over
89% of California.
''Admittedly this is
oversimplification. Not everyone
who voted for us agreed
everything we believe.
"... But the job you've got is
not to convert the whole country
to an ideology, but to get the
information out so that people
will stop fighting each other as

enemies when they should be
allies."
Lowenstein noted the
importance of the result of a
Senate election such as the race
for George Murphy's seat this
year.
"One vote in the Senate passed
the ABM," he stated. "If the vote
had gone the other way, it would
have helped reverse the nation
that everytime the Pentagon asks
for something, we have to give it
to them.
"That one vote . . . can be the
difference between a lot of people
getting killed," he concluded.
The Democratic Congressman
believes that the system, though
resistant to change, is not
impossible to move. "Even Mount
Rushmore is affected by enough
wind," he said.
However, Lowenstein warned
that many of this year's
Congressional races are crucial. He
singled out the McCloskey-Athern
race in San Mateo County. "If we
lose Pete McCloskey," he
predicted, "it will undo 5 years of
100,000 people marching."
Though he stressed that
non-violent change was necessary
given the present political
conditions in the United States,
Lowenstein said that in some
situations violence may even be
morally defensible. One such
situation is in Southern Africa,
where as a way of opposing
oppression by the Portuguese and
white South Africans, he things
that "... violence may have some
chance of success."
But in this country, Lowenstein
commented, "... we should not
be trying to destroy the
Constitution, but to implement
it."

to about one hundred people in
Cubberly Auditorium Sunday
night. The speech was delayed 2Vt
hours when Lowenstein was
unable to make a scheduled 7:30
appearance.
Lowenstein emphasized that in
the current situation working
within the system is the surest
method of achieving reforms.
"Things would be tough if the
country wasn't willing to talk to
us," he said, "but the evidence
doesn't point towards that.
"In 1968 we won in Nebraska,
Indiana, Wisconsin, New
Hampshire, and convinced over
89% of California.
''Admittedly this is
oversimplification. Not everyone
who voted for us agreed
everything we believe.
"... But the job you've got is
not to convert the whole country
to an ideology, but to get the
information out so that people
will stop fighting each other as

enemies when they should be
allies."
Lowenstein noted the
importance of the result of a
Senate election such as the race
for George Murphy's seat this
year.
"One vote in the Senate passed
the ABM," he stated. "If the vote
had gone the other way, it would
have helped reverse the nation
that everytime the Pentagon asks
for something, we have to give it
to them.
"That one vote . . . can be the
difference between a lot of people
getting killed," he concluded.
The Democratic Congressman
believes that the system, though
resistant to change, is not
impossible to move. "Even Mount
Rushmore is affected by enough
wind," he said.
However, Lowenstein warned
that many of this year's
Congressional races are crucial. He
singled out the McCloskey-Athern
race in San Mateo County. "If we
lose Pete McCloskey," he
predicted, "it will undo 5 years of
100,000 people marching."
Though he stressed that
non-violent change was necessary
given the present political
conditions in the United States,
Lowenstein said that in some
situations violence may even be
morally defensible. One such
situation is in Southern Africa,
where as a way of opposing
oppression by the Portuguese and
white South Africans, he things
that "... violence may have some
chance of success."
But in this country, Lowenstein
commented, "... we should not
be trying to destroy the
Constitution, but to implement
it."


REPRESSIVE ACTlONS—Congressman Allard Lowenstein told a Stanford
audience Sunday night that fear of revolution can allow repressive actions such
as the Jackson killings.
Fear and revolution is
producing a mood in the United
States which condones repressive
actions such as the Jackson
killings, a New York Congressman
said here Sunday.
AJlard Lowenstein, formerly
Stanford Poli Sci Lecturer
and now the Congressional
representative of the sth district
of New York, warned of a

will be some kind of bloody
takeover."
