# Kunstler Rally Tomorrow
## 
### 
'Chicago 7' defense attorney William M. Kunstler will address a
Wednesday morning rally in White Plaza sponsored by the Stanford
Committee Against War and Fascism.
Kunstler is scheduled to speak from 11:30 to 12:30 on an as-yet
unnamed topic. Later he will speak at a 1:30 p.m. Berkeley rally,
and will be the guest of honor at a special American Civil Liberties
Union "Festival of Freedom" 7:30 Wednesday evening at San
Francisco's Fillmore West.
Kunstler was scheduled to speak today at San Jose State.
However, State Chancellor Glenn S. Dumke cancelled his scheduled
appearance.
Dumke said Sunday that "I recognize that disorders involving
personal injuries and property damage have occured following
certain of Mr. Kunstler's appearances" and, therefore, the speaking
engagement was "not advisable at this time." Kunstler has been
prevented several times this year from speaking at other college
campuses.
Time Magazine has described Kunstler as a "courtroom paladin
who specializes in protecting the right of dissent and even civil
disobedience." Kunstler's defense of the 'Chicago 7' brought him
nation-wide recognition and a four-year sentence for contempt of
court from Judge Julius J. Hoffman.
Called the "blackest white man I know" by one of his black
clients, Kunstler has provided legal counsel for th<; late Dr. Martin
Luther King, black militant H. Rap Brown, and fourteen Black
Panthers accused of conspiracy to bomb several buildings.
