## Stocks Fall Sharply 
### 
New York (AP) - The stock
market Monday suffered one of
its widest and sharpest losses since
the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy Nov. 22, 1 963.
The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials fell 20.81 to 641.36.
When Kennedy was assassinated,
the Dow fell 21.16 points.
Monday's closing Dow level was
the lowest since Dec. 18, 1962,
when the average ended at
640.14.
The Dow average fell more than
11 points during the first hour,
drifted fractionally lower in
midsession, then started falling
sharply again late the day.
Volume picked up toward the
close, with the tape running two
minutes behind at the bell.
"We're having a complete
panic," one analyst said. "It's a
horrible sight. People are being
ruined."
Hijacking
MIAMI (AP) - A red-haired
woman with a pistol used her
12-year-old son as her interpreter

when she hijacked one of three
airliners forced to Cuba in 24
hours, returning passengers said in
Miami Monday night.
The woman hijacker was
aboard a Delta Airlines jet that
carried 96 passengers and a crew
of six. It was diverted between
Atlanta and Miami. Radio Havana,
official voice of the Fidel Castro
regime, did not identify the
hijacker but said she was
accompanied by her 12-year-old
son. Both stayed in Cuba.
Stewardess Judy Winninger said
the boy followed his mother into
the jet's cockpit and acted as her
interpreter. The woman spoke
Spanish, she said.
A man with a gun hijacked an
American Airlines jet to Cuba
later in the day.
A Mexicana de Aviacion jet
flew back to Mexico from Cuba
Monday night also. It was
hijacked Sunday night over the
Yucatan Peninsula with 79 people
aboard.
Capt. Antonio Chavez Guizar
said the hijackers claimed they
commandeered the Boeing 727 to

strike back at Mexican authorities
for the killing of Guatemalan
guerrilla leader Jose Antonio Yon
Sosa and because of the army
slaying of some students in
Mexico City Oct. 2, 1968. Capt.
Chavez said his plan was taken
over by three Brazilians and a
Mexican.
CSA Fire
PALMDALE, Calif. (AP) - An
Air Force CSA jumbo jet - the
world's largest â€” caught fire
Monday, rolled down the runway
and smashed into two fire trucks.
Firemen estimated the damage to
the plane at $15 million.
Los Angeles County Fire
Department officials and
newsmen saw the huge craft
suddenly lumber to life after
flames erupted while the plane
taxied on the runway.
Jim Harpel, battalion chief of
the Palmdale station in the high
desert area of Los Angeles
County, said half the plane was
destroyed. That would be $15
million damage, based on a
$30-million value for the plane, he
said. The plane was carrying no
cargo.
Harris Poll
NEW YORK (AP) - President
Nixon's action in ordering
American troops into Cambodia
has public approval by a margin of
50 percent in favor to 43 percent
against, according to the Harris
Poll released by the Chicago
Tribune syndicate.
Heaviest support for the
President's policy in Cambodia is
drawn from the South and the
West, from residents of small
towns and rural areas, and from
older persons, the poll says.
Opposition was said to be
greatest among those under 30
years of age, among women,
Easterners, and those who reside
in suburbs and urban centers.
