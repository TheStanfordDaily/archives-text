# Co-op Living Plans Blossom
## 
### LESLIE CAMPBELL 
At least three different experiments in
living are planned for campus next year. Pooh
Corner, Zeta Alphi Pi (ZAP), and a
non-violence house hope to offer alternatives
to dorm and fraternity life styles.
Pooh Corner, technically known as the
(Co-op) house, will occupy what was once
Jordan House. The basis of the co-op living
situation is that everyone in the house
cooperates by doing the cleaning, cooking,
and grounds work themselves.
The house will have 1 6 men and 16 women,
from all classes.
"However, the Pooh community will be a
classless one," noted one coed.
Dan Kent, one of the co-op organizers,
commented, "There are two main reasons for
Pooh Corner: to achieve a sense of
community living by having everyone work
together and to save money."
The group hopes to save $300 per person
during their first year at Pooh. Organizers are
convinced that as operations become more
efficient, this figure will increase.
Approval Process Difficult
According to Kent, "It has been a long and
drawn-out process to get University approval
for the house and to hassle out subsequent
red-tape."
Within the Stanford context, Pooh Corner
is the first co-op house proposal approved by
the university. Similar living groups have
existed at Berkeley, Harvard, and other
campuses for some time.
The administration terms the co-op house

'an experiment,' which, if it works, will be
part of the regular University housing draw a
year from now.
Own Garden
The 32 Pooh people estimate that they will
each be working five hours r. week and will
rotate jobs. The group plans to have their own
vegetable garden, an art room, and an in-house
seminar program.
"We are all very optimistic and excited
about our attempt at Pooh," said Betsy
Feeney, a prospective Pooh person.
The house is full now for next year but
there may be places in the fall.
Non-Violent Group
The non-violent house is not yet a home. A
group of 35 students are ready to move in as
soon as the University bequeaths them a
shelter.
The idea originated after the symposium on
non-violence at Memorial Church this quarter.
Plans developed further within a group of
students attempting to fast ROTC off campus.
Dwight Clark, Craig Schindler, Dave
DeWolf, Dan Morrow, and other planners Teel
that "living together and practicing
non-violence in a concrete way is essential to
give the concept meaning."
Material Simplicity
"The central idea of the house is to live at a
materially simple level; to reflect beliefs that
people shouldn't exploit each other and the
natural environment," said De Wolf. The
group plans on eating on less than a $1.00 a
day. The house would be another experiment

in cooperative living similar to that of Pooh
Corner.
"We don't want to live off of other people's
backs," commented DeWolf. He added,
"Non-violence is more a style of life than a
theme."
Planners outlined three main purposes of
having a special house of non-violence: it
would be an opportunity to have seminars and
discussions of non-violence with the
community at large; and it would serve as a
focus on campus for all people committed to
non-violence.
Searching For House
The administration has promised to try to
find a house for the group. Four possibilities
are presently being explored. DeWolf
concluded, "We are still looking for people
interested in doing work on non-violence next
year with the possibility of being in a living
group."
ZAP used to be FIJI. It stands for Zeta
Alpha Phi and is "indirectly related to ZAP
comic books," according to a ZAP official.
The same official explained, "ZAP is not a
frat, it is a house " ZAP will be a co-ed house
with 41 people, including twelve women.
After this year's confusion on arrangements
the administration agreed to have a draw for
women and regular pledging for men. The
future set-up of ZAP is unclear at this point.
But, "no one is worried about it; we're
worried about other things right now,"
commented a ZAP spokesman. ZAP
representatives will meet with the
administration next week.

people shouldn't exploit each other and the
natural environment," said De Wolf. The
group plans on eating on less than a $1.00 a
day. The house would be another experiment

in cooperative living similar to that of Pooh
Corner.
"We don't want to live off of other people's
backs," commented DeWolf. He added,
"Non-violence is more a style of life than a
theme."
Planners outlined three main purposes of
having a special house of non-violence: it
would be an opportunity to have seminars and
discussions of non-violence with the
community at large; and it would serve as a
focus on campus for all people committed to
non-violence.
Searching For House
The administration has promised to try to
find a house for the group. Four possibilities
are presently being explored. DeWolf
concluded, "We are still looking for people
interested in doing work on non-violence next
year with the possibility of being in a living
group."
ZAP used to be FIJI. It stands for Zeta
Alpha Phi and is "indirectly related to ZAP
comic books," according to a ZAP official.
The same official explained, "ZAP is not a
frat, it is a house " ZAP will be a co-ed house
with 41 people, including twelve women.
After this year's confusion on arrangements
the administration agreed to have a draw for
women and regular pledging for men. The
future set-up of ZAP is unclear at this point.
But, "no one is worried about it; we're
worried about other things right now,"
commented a ZAP spokesman. ZAP
representatives will meet with the
administration next week.
At least three different experiments in
living are planned for campus next year. Pooh
Corner, Zeta Alphi Pi (ZAP), and a
non-violence house hope to offer alternatives
to dorm and fraternity life styles.
Pooh Corner, technically known as the
(Co-op) house, will occupy what was once
Jordan House. The basis of the co-op living
situation is that everyone in the house
cooperates by doing the cleaning, cooking,
and grounds work themselves.
The house will have 1 6 men and 16 women,
from all classes.
"However, the Pooh community will be a
classless one," noted one coed.
Dan Kent, one of the co-op organizers,
commented, "There are two main reasons for
Pooh Corner: to achieve a sense of
community living by having everyone work
together and to save money."
The group hopes to save $300 per person
during their first year at Pooh. Organizers are
convinced that as operations become more
efficient, this figure will increase.
Approval Process Difficult
According to Kent, "It has been a long and
drawn-out process to get University approval
for the house and to hassle out subsequent
red-tape."
Within the Stanford context, Pooh Corner
is the first co-op house proposal approved by
the university. Similar living groups have
existed at Berkeley, Harvard, and other
campuses for some time.
The administration terms the co-op house

'an experiment,' which, if it works, will be
part of the regular University housing draw a
year from now.
Own Garden
The 32 Pooh people estimate that they will
each be working five hours r. week and will
rotate jobs. The group plans to have their own
vegetable garden, an art room, and an in-house
seminar program.
"We are all very optimistic and excited
about our attempt at Pooh," said Betsy
Feeney, a prospective Pooh person.
The house is full now for next year but
there may be places in the fall.
Non-Violent Group
The non-violent house is not yet a home. A
group of 35 students are ready to move in as
soon as the University bequeaths them a
shelter.
The idea originated after the symposium on
non-violence at Memorial Church this quarter.
Plans developed further within a group of
students attempting to fast ROTC off campus.
Dwight Clark, Craig Schindler, Dave
DeWolf, Dan Morrow, and other planners Teel
that "living together and practicing
non-violence in a concrete way is essential to
give the concept meaning."
Material Simplicity
"The central idea of the house is to live at a
materially simple level; to reflect beliefs that
people shouldn't exploit each other and the
natural environment," said De Wolf. The
group plans on eating on less than a $1.00 a
day. The house would be another experiment

in cooperative living similar to that of Pooh
