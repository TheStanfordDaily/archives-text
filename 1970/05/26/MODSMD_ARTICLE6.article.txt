# Slain Students Honored In Memorial Service
## 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
A memorial service was held
last night for the blacks slain at
Jackson State College and in
Augusta. Three hundred quiet
participants came to Memorial
Church to express their tired
sorrow and their "kinship in life."
The memorial service began
with a "Rite of Confession."
"We confess that we are
tired . . . that we have made this
mess but don't have the strength
to unmake it," chorused the
crowd's prayer into the rafters.
Rev. Wayne Rood, Acting Dean
of the Chapel, told them why
they had come: "to express our
tired community - our grief
community."

He said they were there to "act
out our kinship in life."
Frustration
Leo Bazile, Black Students
Union chairman, was less sure
about the purpose of the service.
"Keep in mind the word
'frustration,' " was the first thing
he said.
"Probably the most frustrating
moment I've had was when a
brother came to me in the Black
House and said, 'Leo, we've got to
do something about Jackson
State.' I didn't know what to tell
him," Bazile said.
• "I didn't want to do this," he
said of the Memorial Service. "A
lot of BSU people are tired of
symbolic gestures. That's what
I'm afraid this will end up as."
Different Symbol
But in Bazile's eyes, this
symbol was different from usual
demonstrations and speeches.
"I may lie to you in White
Plaza, but in Church I'll tell you
the truth,"he said quietly.
"A lot of people don't want to
admit it, but I am very angry at
white people, and I can't
understand why my frustration
hasn't turned to hate."
"And every time I even think I
might be able to forget my
frustration, along comes a Jackson
State," he fumed, raising his voice
for the only time during his
half-hour speech.
Questions Arms
"Shall I tell my people to arm
themselves?" Bazile asked. "I
don't know."
Bazile let his speech ramble
slowly and sadly over the many
areas of his frustration. He
mentioned Alameda County, fair
housing, pollution, Vice President
Agnew, and the Orangeville
massacre.
"People always ask me, 'What
can I do . . . can I do?' " Bazile's
voice trailed off.
"Well, those two black students
can be replaced here. They can be
replaced at Yale, and at Harvard,
and all over the country."
Celebrate Life
Nobody spoke much about the
two girls themselves who were
shot last week when police
opened fire on a Jackson State
dormitory. And nobody spoke
much of the Augusta six, shot in
;he back the week before.

Bazile said, "We've talked
about dead people enough. What
we want to celebrate is life, not
death."
Harold Varner, Pastor of the
First Lutheran Church in Palo
Alto, spoke last. He said that he,
too, saw weariness and death
everywhere he looked.
Attitude of Death
"We have been drained of all
our courage and faith and insight.
We are faced with the whole
attitude of death," the black
minister said.
There was music as well.
The Voices of Joy, a group
with about 30 singers, a pianist, a
drummer, and guitarists,
performed two rhythmic modern
hymns, and cajoled some of the
crowd into clapping along.
Finally, as a "Gesture of
Reconcilliation," the people were
asked to pledge themselves to
some positive political act which
might help cure "the cancer in
America" that Varner had spoken
of.
The congregation filed one by
one to the front of the Church to
give Varner the slips of paper that
symbolized the "Reconcilliation,"
and then left quietly.
