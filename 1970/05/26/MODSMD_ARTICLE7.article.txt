# End In Sight
## 
### 
Volume 157 of the Stanford
Daily will hit the stands for the
last time Thursday morning. In
other words, Dead Week is almost
upon us.
Publication will resume during
preregistration for Fall Quarter. In
the meantime, our partners in
crime, the Summer Daily, which
appears Tuesdays and Fridays
during the summer quarter, will
take over our desks and
typewriters, not to mention our
problems.
Summer quarter publication
begins June 23. Those planning to
work on the Daily during the
summer should attend the staff
organizational meeting at the
Daily office, Thursday at 2:30.
No announcements, public
service or otherwise, will be
accepted after our normal
deadline of 2 p.m. Wednesday.
Sorry about that.
Oh yes. Daily staffers-infor
mation on the traditional
end-of-the-volume debauchery is
available at the office.
