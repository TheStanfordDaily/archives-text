# 'Infant Democracy':
## An Opportunity Too Good To Lose 
### Brooks Otis 
The Daily of May 19 published
a letter on the need for a new
governing body or reconstituted
Senate for the whole University.
And by curious coincidence, the
same Daily also published news of
the meeting of representatives of
some 22 departments interested in
founding or considering the
desirability of founding a new
organization that would directly
represent the associated
departments of the University. As
one of those responsible for
calling this meeting, I should like
to make a few comments on it
and on the letter of Messrs.
Askinasand Levin.
It is clear that Cambodia may
mark a new phase of University
life and organization. Already we
have seen departments holding
meetings or "assemblies" of
faculty, graduate and
undergraduate students, and in
this way reorganizing the

departmental life and program for
at least the period of crisis. Token
democracy in the form of a few
students voting or not voting on
faculty committees has, in fact,
been replaced for this brief period
by something approaching to the
real thing.
I don't want to herald this as a
permanent blessing or an
unambiguous good; I don't in fact
know what it means or will mean,
or how applicable it is to the
normal operations of the
University. What I think I do
know is that it has done a lot of
temporary good and raised up
very exciting possibilities. For one
thing it has opened the windows
and let in a good deal of fresh air.
The University tune so far has
been called by the
Administration, the Faculty
Senate, the Student Senate and
the Radical Caucus. Somehow
none of these quite does the job

and at least one does a job that
the great majority do not want.
The case for a more inclusive,
more democratic form of
University representation - a body
expressing the actual forces now
at work - is, I think, very
impressive.
Students Have Power
For one thing, I think it is
foolish to go on pretending that
students don't have any power. I
am inclined to think that Messrs.
Askinas' and Levin's proposal for
scrapping existing bodies, such as
the Academic Senate, is certainly
premature and probably
undesirable. But I do think that
the existing bodies need
supplementing, that they do not
at present do the whole job that
needs to be done.
This job involves a lot of hard,
fundamental thinking. The very
nature of definition of the
University is now on the

University agenda. How can a
broader-based Assembly in these
political days be trusted to carry
on the ancient ideals of the
University? The University of
course is firmly imbedded in the
American 'establishment'.
Otherwise, it could not have
existed and would not be
supported.
But the University is also, to
some extent at least, the critic and
antagonist of the 'establishment'.
Otherwise it could not have
harbored the present student
movement. To say that academic
freedom is limited is not to say
that it does not exist. To do that
or say that is to deny the reality
of the limb we are sitting on
What Can We Do
But there is a new wind of
freedom blowing. If it is not to
blow us into reaction and
despotism, we must trim our sails
to it. We must consider what we

can do in a great political crisis
that we cannot and should not
ignore. But we must consider also
what we cannot do without
sawing off the limb which
supports us.
This is why 1 hope very much
that the interdepartmental
initiative recorded in the I>ail >of
May 19 will lead us to some
serious consideration of the kind
of Government that has actually
begun to emerge in this
University, to consider in shor ,
what we need that existing bodies
do not give us. I think that we
have a very great opportunity and
that we should not be deterred
from seizing it by fear or timidity.
I hope very much that the
departments will not strangle tin
new infant democracy which has
been so unexpectedly left on their
doorsteps.

despotism, we must trim our sails
to it. We must consider what we

can do in a great political crisis
that we cannot and should not
ignore. But we must consider also
what we cannot do without
sawing off the limb which
supports us.
This is why 1 hope very much
that the interdepartmental
initiative recorded in the I>ail >of
May 19 will lead us to some
serious consideration of the kind
of Government that has actually
begun to emerge in this
University, to consider in shor ,
what we need that existing bodies
do not give us. I think that we
have a very great opportunity and
that we should not be deterred
from seizing it by fear or timidity.
I hope very much that the
departments will not strangle tin
new infant democracy which has
been so unexpectedly left on their
doorsteps.
(Brooks Otis is chairman of the
Classics Department.)
The Daily of May 19 published
a letter on the need for a new
governing body or reconstituted
Senate for the whole University.
And by curious coincidence, the
same Daily also published news of
the meeting of representatives of
some 22 departments interested in
founding or considering the
desirability of founding a new
organization that would directly
represent the associated
departments of the University. As
one of those responsible for
calling this meeting, I should like
to make a few comments on it
and on the letter of Messrs.
Askinasand Levin.
It is clear that Cambodia may
mark a new phase of University
life and organization. Already we
have seen departments holding
meetings or "assemblies" of
faculty, graduate and
undergraduate students, and in
this way reorganizing the

departmental life and program for
at least the period of crisis. Token
democracy in the form of a few
students voting or not voting on
faculty committees has, in fact,
been replaced for this brief period
by something approaching to the
real thing.
I don't want to herald this as a
permanent blessing or an
unambiguous good; I don't in fact
know what it means or will mean,
or how applicable it is to the
normal operations of the
University. What I think I do
know is that it has done a lot of
temporary good and raised up
very exciting possibilities. For one
thing it has opened the windows
and let in a good deal of fresh air.
The University tune so far has
been called by the
Administration, the Faculty
Senate, the Student Senate and
the Radical Caucus. Somehow
none of these quite does the job

and at least one does a job that
the great majority do not want.
The case for a more inclusive,
more democratic form of
University representation - a body
expressing the actual forces now
at work - is, I think, very
impressive.
Students Have Power
For one thing, I think it is
foolish to go on pretending that
students don't have any power. I
am inclined to think that Messrs.
Askinas' and Levin's proposal for
scrapping existing bodies, such as
the Academic Senate, is certainly
premature and probably
undesirable. But I do think that
the existing bodies need
supplementing, that they do not
at present do the whole job that
needs to be done.
This job involves a lot of hard,
fundamental thinking. The very
nature of definition of the
University is now on the

University agenda. How can a
broader-based Assembly in these
political days be trusted to carry
on the ancient ideals of the
University? The University of
course is firmly imbedded in the
American 'establishment'.
Otherwise, it could not have
existed and would not be
supported.
But the University is also, to
some extent at least, the critic and
antagonist of the 'establishment'.
Otherwise it could not have
harbored the present student
movement. To say that academic
freedom is limited is not to say
that it does not exist. To do that
or say that is to deny the reality
of the limb we are sitting on
What Can We Do
But there is a new wind of
freedom blowing. If it is not to
blow us into reaction and
despotism, we must trim our sails
to it. We must consider what we

can do in a great political crisis
that we cannot and should not
ignore. But we must consider also
what we cannot do without
sawing off the limb which
supports us.
