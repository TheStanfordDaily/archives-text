President Nixon has enlarged the war in Indochina despite widespread
public concern and against the firm advice of growing numbers of legis
lators, government experts and scholars who say the war is futile and di
verts resources from pressing social needs. By so doing the President is
dividing and polarizing our society, setting American against American;
race against race, young people against one another, and parents against
their children. Instead of uniting our people as he promised, he dismisses
young people who oppose the war.
We, as parents in the Stanford community, believe that in this crisis it is
our obligation to declare our support of young people in their desire to
stop the war now. We must not give in to those who would separate us
from and set us against our children.
We urge all parents to declare themselves by signing this statement and
by working to change governmental policies in the direction of peace, jus
tice, and a better society—and away from war-making.

Parents-for-Peace Movement
President Nixon has enlarged the war in Indochina despite widespread
public concern and against the firm advice of growing numbers of legis
lators, government experts and scholars who say the war is futile and di
verts resources from pressing social needs. By so doing the President is
dividing and polarizing our society, setting American against American;
race against race, young people against one another, and parents against
their children. Instead of uniting our people as he promised, he dismisses
young people who oppose the war.
We, as parents in the Stanford community, believe that in this crisis it is
our obligation to declare our support of young people in their desire to
stop the war now. We must not give in to those who would separate us
from and set us against our children.
We urge all parents to declare themselves by signing this statement and
by working to change governmental policies in the direction of peace, jus
tice, and a better society—and away from war-making.
Below is a partial list of parents in the Stanford community who have
signed this statement.
