# Extensive Low Cost Housing Urged By Wright Committee
## 
### 
A 15-member committee
eaded by Prof. Gordon Wright
as recommended that phased
•welopment of 600 to 2,000 low
nd moderate income housing
nits on Stanford land begin "at
he earliest possible date."
In its report to President Pitzer,
he President's Ad Hoc Housing
vdvisory Committee gave top
riority to two potential sites: 18
" r es adjoining faculty housing
cross Page Mill Road from
lewlett-Packard, and 70 acres on
he southeast corner of the Page
4 i 11 - Foothill Expressway
itersection.
Two other sites recommended
or "earliest development" are a
>C acre plot adjoining the Medical
•chool on the campus side of
Villow Road, and a 48 acre area
pordered by San Francisquito
>eek, the Convalescent Home
nd Oak Creek Apartments.
An additional 77 acres
djoining the former General
>lephone building on
\rastradero Rd, across from
>roperty currently owned by
.and Resources Corporation, and
>00 acres on Alpine Road
jetween SLAC and Ladera were
lamed for possible later
levelopment.
Lease Land
In keeping with its previous
eports, the committee said that
ts recommendations "need not
nvolve a major financial burden
>n the University" because of
ivailable federal aid and the
>ossibility of placing development
v sponsibility in another
lonprofit or limited profit
jrganization. It suggested that the
Jniversity lease land "at an
ippropriate value for the
)urpose," taking into account
joth its need to use its resources
or educational purposes and the
i.'nits beyond which land costs
vould force rentals beyond the
easible level for low and
noderate income families.
It said the maximum land price
>r ground rent that would make
ow and moderate income rentals
)ossible with utilities available
was estimated at $20,000 to
£40,000 per acre, depending upon

the terrain. If land costs can be
included in federal subsidies, this
would amount to $5 per month in
rentals for moderate income
families or $1.50 to $2.10 for low
income families.
"Under these circumstances,
donation of the land would hurt
the University's financial situation
much more than it would benefit
housing," the committee said. In
addition, outright donation would
probably be challenged as illegal,
it noted.
The report said that while 600
new housing units would meet
"only the most pressing needs,"
some figure between 600 and
2000 might be regarded as a really
important breakthrough (if
accompanied by parallel efforts in
surrounding communities.)"
Noting that new housing
construction has lagged "far
behind community needs" on the
Peninsula, the report warned that
"low and moderate income
families, as a group, are being
squeezed out of the area, . . . and
the exclusion of minorities is
continuing at the same time."
The committee recommended
that low and moderate income
dwellings be interspersed with
middle income units on some
sites. Low and moderate units
would be financed under the
National Housing Act, and
additional assistance would be
sought under the rent supplement
program for low income families.
Minority Housing
A goal of 25 percent black and
Chicano tenants in each
development was suggested to
achieve racial balance.
"The committee believes that
the suggested black-Chicano
proportion will produce a
substantial number of units for
minority families within a
community which is clearly not a
ghetto in any sense," the report
observed.
Low income families should
occupy 30 percent of the
subsidized units, with middle
income residents comprising 35
percent of the total in any area,
the report said. The remaining 10

percent was designated for
students.
The report added that about
half the units should be reserved
for Stanford staff, faculty, and
students, with the other half going
to employees of firms located on
Stanford land or for the general
public working close to Stanford.
Future Development
The Committee discouraged the
University from directly
undertaking planning and
construction of the new units, and
went on to specify that manage
ment "definitely should not be
undertaken by Stanford" on
completion of construction.
The report names Harvard,
MIT, and Cornell as institutions
which "already have begun to
grapple with housing problems in
their communities," and urged
that Stanford tie its future
indistrial development to
provisions for new housing.
"The University's past policy of
industrial development without a
housing component, while quite
understandable in past conditions,
can no longer be justified in
present and anticipated future
conditions."
"The mid-Peninsula area is now
so solidly built up that private
developers are unlikely to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing off Stanford
lands. Traffic and pollution
problems dictate a general effort
to keep as many workers as
possible close to their place of
work."
"Both Stanford and the
neighboring communities have a
moral obligation to develop
indistry and housing as linked
enterprises."
Copies of the committee's
report have been sent to all
Trustees, and a recommendation
will be submitted after a staff
review of all aspects of the study,
according to President Pitzer.
Prof. Wright is optimistic about
the report, which expresses the
convictions of the committee
unanimously, despite the
inopportune time of its release.
"Personally, I'm vitally

optimistic—l think the chances are
real. This is not the ideal time to
ask the President and Trustees to
assume another burden (after the
spring disturbances), but we do
think that its important enough to
ask them "
Besides Wright, other
committee members include 5
professors, associate provost
Robert Rozenzweig, several
Stanford staff employees. a
faculty wife, and students Sloan
Blocker, Joyce Kobayashi, and
Joel Primack.
Kobayashi, too, is optimistic,
but she has some reservations.
"Events this quarter might have
taken away some of the focus on
low-income housing. I have some
hope that the first development
might be approved if FHA
funding is obtained, but I'm afraid
it might stop after that. It is
important that the Stanford
community shows its support of
low income housing, and doesn't
let it be overwhelmed by other
concerns."

Trustees, and a recommendation
will be submitted after a staff
review of all aspects of the study,
according to President Pitzer.
Prof. Wright is optimistic about
the report, which expresses the
convictions of the committee
unanimously, despite the
inopportune time of its release.
"Personally, I'm vitally

optimistic—l think the chances are
real. This is not the ideal time to
ask the President and Trustees to
assume another burden (after the
spring disturbances), but we do
think that its important enough to
ask them "
Besides Wright, other
committee members include 5
professors, associate provost
Robert Rozenzweig, several
Stanford staff employees. a
faculty wife, and students Sloan
Blocker, Joyce Kobayashi, and
Joel Primack.
Kobayashi, too, is optimistic,
but she has some reservations.
"Events this quarter might have
taken away some of the focus on
low-income housing. I have some
hope that the first development
might be approved if FHA
funding is obtained, but I'm afraid
it might stop after that. It is
important that the Stanford
community shows its support of
low income housing, and doesn't
let it be overwhelmed by other
concerns."

A 15-member committee
eaded by Prof. Gordon Wright
as recommended that phased
•welopment of 600 to 2,000 low
nd moderate income housing
nits on Stanford land begin "at
he earliest possible date."
In its report to President Pitzer,
he President's Ad Hoc Housing
vdvisory Committee gave top
riority to two potential sites: 18
" r es adjoining faculty housing
cross Page Mill Road from
lewlett-Packard, and 70 acres on
he southeast corner of the Page
4 i 11 - Foothill Expressway
itersection.
Two other sites recommended
or "earliest development" are a
>C acre plot adjoining the Medical
•chool on the campus side of
Villow Road, and a 48 acre area
pordered by San Francisquito
>eek, the Convalescent Home
nd Oak Creek Apartments.
An additional 77 acres
djoining the former General
>lephone building on
\rastradero Rd, across from
>roperty currently owned by
.and Resources Corporation, and
>00 acres on Alpine Road
jetween SLAC and Ladera were
lamed for possible later
levelopment.
Lease Land
In keeping with its previous
eports, the committee said that
ts recommendations "need not
nvolve a major financial burden
>n the University" because of
ivailable federal aid and the
>ossibility of placing development
v sponsibility in another
lonprofit or limited profit
jrganization. It suggested that the
Jniversity lease land "at an
ippropriate value for the
)urpose," taking into account
joth its need to use its resources
or educational purposes and the
i.'nits beyond which land costs
vould force rentals beyond the
easible level for low and
noderate income families.
It said the maximum land price
>r ground rent that would make
ow and moderate income rentals
)ossible with utilities available
was estimated at $20,000 to
£40,000 per acre, depending upon

the terrain. If land costs can be
included in federal subsidies, this
would amount to $5 per month in
rentals for moderate income
families or $1.50 to $2.10 for low
income families.
"Under these circumstances,
donation of the land would hurt
the University's financial situation
much more than it would benefit
housing," the committee said. In
addition, outright donation would
probably be challenged as illegal,
it noted.
The report said that while 600
new housing units would meet
"only the most pressing needs,"
some figure between 600 and
2000 might be regarded as a really
important breakthrough (if
accompanied by parallel efforts in
surrounding communities.)"
Noting that new housing
construction has lagged "far
behind community needs" on the
Peninsula, the report warned that
"low and moderate income
families, as a group, are being
squeezed out of the area, . . . and
the exclusion of minorities is
continuing at the same time."
The committee recommended
that low and moderate income
dwellings be interspersed with
middle income units on some
sites. Low and moderate units
would be financed under the
National Housing Act, and
additional assistance would be
sought under the rent supplement
program for low income families.
Minority Housing
A goal of 25 percent black and
Chicano tenants in each
development was suggested to
achieve racial balance.
"The committee believes that
the suggested black-Chicano
proportion will produce a
substantial number of units for
minority families within a
community which is clearly not a
ghetto in any sense," the report
observed.
Low income families should
occupy 30 percent of the
subsidized units, with middle
income residents comprising 35
percent of the total in any area,
the report said. The remaining 10

percent was designated for
students.
The report added that about
half the units should be reserved
for Stanford staff, faculty, and
students, with the other half going
to employees of firms located on
Stanford land or for the general
public working close to Stanford.
Future Development
The Committee discouraged the
University from directly
undertaking planning and
construction of the new units, and
went on to specify that manage
ment "definitely should not be
undertaken by Stanford" on
completion of construction.
The report names Harvard,
MIT, and Cornell as institutions
which "already have begun to
grapple with housing problems in
their communities," and urged
that Stanford tie its future
indistrial development to
provisions for new housing.
"The University's past policy of
industrial development without a
housing component, while quite
understandable in past conditions,
can no longer be justified in
present and anticipated future
conditions."
"The mid-Peninsula area is now
so solidly built up that private
developers are unlikely to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing off Stanford
lands. Traffic and pollution
problems dictate a general effort
to keep as many workers as
possible close to their place of
work."
"Both Stanford and the
neighboring communities have a
moral obligation to develop
indistry and housing as linked
enterprises."

the report said. The remaining 10

percent was designated for
students.
The report added that about
half the units should be reserved
for Stanford staff, faculty, and
students, with the other half going
to employees of firms located on
Stanford land or for the general
public working close to Stanford.
Future Development
The Committee discouraged the
University from directly
undertaking planning and
construction of the new units, and
went on to specify that manage
ment "definitely should not be
undertaken by Stanford" on
completion of construction.
The report names Harvard,
MIT, and Cornell as institutions
which "already have begun to
grapple with housing problems in
their communities," and urged
that Stanford tie its future
indistrial development to
provisions for new housing.
"The University's past policy of
industrial development without a
housing component, while quite
understandable in past conditions,
can no longer be justified in
present and anticipated future
conditions."
"The mid-Peninsula area is now
so solidly built up that private
developers are unlikely to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing off Stanford
lands. Traffic and pollution
problems dictate a general effort
to keep as many workers as
possible close to their place of
work."
"Both Stanford and the
neighboring communities have a
moral obligation to develop
indistry and housing as linked
enterprises."
Copies of the committee's
report have been sent to all
Trustees, and a recommendation
will be submitted after a staff
review of all aspects of the study,
according to President Pitzer.
Prof. Wright is optimistic about
the report, which expresses the
convictions of the committee
unanimously, despite the
inopportune time of its release.
"Personally, I'm vitally

optimistic—l think the chances are
real. This is not the ideal time to
ask the President and Trustees to
assume another burden (after the
spring disturbances), but we do
think that its important enough to
ask them "
Besides Wright, other
committee members include 5
professors, associate provost
Robert Rozenzweig, several
Stanford staff employees. a
faculty wife, and students Sloan
Blocker, Joyce Kobayashi, and
Joel Primack.
Kobayashi, too, is optimistic,
but she has some reservations.
"Events this quarter might have
taken away some of the focus on
low-income housing. I have some
hope that the first development
might be approved if FHA
funding is obtained, but I'm afraid
it might stop after that. It is
important that the Stanford
community shows its support of
low income housing, and doesn't
let it be overwhelmed by other
concerns."

A 15-member committee
eaded by Prof. Gordon Wright
as recommended that phased
•welopment of 600 to 2,000 low
nd moderate income housing
nits on Stanford land begin "at
he earliest possible date."
In its report to President Pitzer,
he President's Ad Hoc Housing
vdvisory Committee gave top
riority to two potential sites: 18
" r es adjoining faculty housing
cross Page Mill Road from
lewlett-Packard, and 70 acres on
he southeast corner of the Page
4 i 11 - Foothill Expressway
itersection.
Two other sites recommended
or "earliest development" are a
>C acre plot adjoining the Medical
•chool on the campus side of
Villow Road, and a 48 acre area
pordered by San Francisquito
>eek, the Convalescent Home
nd Oak Creek Apartments.
An additional 77 acres
djoining the former General
>lephone building on
\rastradero Rd, across from
>roperty currently owned by
.and Resources Corporation, and
>00 acres on Alpine Road
jetween SLAC and Ladera were
lamed for possible later
levelopment.
Lease Land
In keeping with its previous
eports, the committee said that
ts recommendations "need not
nvolve a major financial burden
>n the University" because of
ivailable federal aid and the
>ossibility of placing development
v sponsibility in another
lonprofit or limited profit
jrganization. It suggested that the
Jniversity lease land "at an
ippropriate value for the
)urpose," taking into account
joth its need to use its resources
or educational purposes and the
i.'nits beyond which land costs
vould force rentals beyond the
easible level for low and
noderate income families.
It said the maximum land price
>r ground rent that would make
ow and moderate income rentals
)ossible with utilities available
was estimated at $20,000 to
£40,000 per acre, depending upon

the terrain. If land costs can be
included in federal subsidies, this
would amount to $5 per month in
rentals for moderate income
families or $1.50 to $2.10 for low
income families.
"Under these circumstances,
donation of the land would hurt
the University's financial situation
much more than it would benefit
housing," the committee said. In
addition, outright donation would
probably be challenged as illegal,
it noted.
The report said that while 600
new housing units would meet
"only the most pressing needs,"
some figure between 600 and
2000 might be regarded as a really
important breakthrough (if
accompanied by parallel efforts in
surrounding communities.)"
Noting that new housing
construction has lagged "far
behind community needs" on the
Peninsula, the report warned that
"low and moderate income
families, as a group, are being
squeezed out of the area, . . . and
the exclusion of minorities is
continuing at the same time."
The committee recommended
that low and moderate income
dwellings be interspersed with
middle income units on some
sites. Low and moderate units
would be financed under the
National Housing Act, and
additional assistance would be
sought under the rent supplement
program for low income families.
Minority Housing
A goal of 25 percent black and
Chicano tenants in each
development was suggested to
achieve racial balance.
"The committee believes that
the suggested black-Chicano
proportion will produce a
substantial number of units for
minority families within a
community which is clearly not a
ghetto in any sense," the report
observed.
Low income families should
occupy 30 percent of the
subsidized units, with middle
income residents comprising 35
percent of the total in any area,
the report said. The remaining 10

percent was designated for
students.
The report added that about
half the units should be reserved
for Stanford staff, faculty, and
