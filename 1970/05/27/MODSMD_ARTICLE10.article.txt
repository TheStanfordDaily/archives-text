# Survey Reveals Ignorance
## 
### TIM COBURN 
Editor's Note: According to Dr.
James ti. McClenaharx, director of
the health center, student health
services at Stanford are
administered by Stanford and
staffed by the'Palo Alto Medical
Clinic. Dr. McClenahan and Dr.
David Dorosin, director of
psychiatric services at Cowell, are
Stanford personnel. The rest of
the staff is supplied by the
Medical Clinic, in accordance with
a contractual agreement with
Stanford. Staff salaries are
decided upon by negotiation
between Stanford and the clinic.
The health service itself operates
under the auspices of the Dean of
Students office.

Student concern with
Stanford's financial policies has
not been extended to all areas of
the University's operations. The
Swopsi workshop on health care
organization has discovered a
perhaps surprising ignorance on
the part of most students of the
relationship between money,
health care, and politics.
According to Roger Vigil, a
pre-med student working with the
Swopsi workshop' "Most students
don't know that they spend over a
million dollars directly on student
health care, nor do they know
who actually receives or
administers this money (most of it
goes to the Palo Alto Clinic)".
Rocky Whitson, another
student involved in the course,
noted that, "Students appear to
view medical care as a purely
technical problem which should
be left to 'experts'. I feel sure that
with a little thought about the
amount of money involved, (over
one million a year locally and
some 60 billion a year nationally)
most students will realize that our

medical care system has profound
social and political implications."
The immediate evidence for
this student ignorance comes from
the flowing question survey asked
by telephone of 250 randomly
chosen Stanford Students:
1. Do you know anything
about the Stanford student health
service? Yes 213, No 27.

quality of care at the health
service? Readily accessibly? Yes
196, No 17. Effective? Yes 174,

The response to some of the
questions was quite a surprise to
members of the SWOPSI
workshop. In particular, the
widespread lack of knowledge of
the economic and administrative
organization (see questions 4, 5,
7, and 8) presented some
difficulty in the interpretation of
question 10. One student in the
workshop felt that the lack of
affirmative response to this basic
question of student control was
due to a misconception of the
difference between administrative
and "medical" decisions.
The original intention of the
survey was to provide some well
documented student opinion to
current consideration by the
medical school of staffing Cowell
Health Center. According to Dr.
William Fowkes, faculty sponsor
of the workshop, "There could be
some considerable advantages to
the medical school staffing
Cowell, both educational and
financial. But many students feel
that saving money for the
University is not synonymous
with saving money for the

students. I think they are right."
A graduate student in the
course expressed this point of
view somewhat more strongly:
"The survey showed that most
students use and like the health
center. Our class agrees that the
quality of care is pretty good. But
does it cost too much? Or are
there better ways of organizing it?
Could it efficiently provide some
services to Stanford employees or
dependents of students?
"I personally have no confidence
that the university administration
could make these kinds of
decisions. I am convinced that the
administration's priorities are so
heavily skewed toward financial
benefit for their own little
empires that any net gain for the
"university" represents a relative
loss for the students."
The health care workshop has
not yet proposed any
revolutionary change in the
organization of medical care
either at Stanford or on a national
level. But they think it will come
eventually. As John Weeks put it:
"medical care is a recognized
national disaster area (see Fortune
January 1970). Some sort of
revolution in the organization of
it is inevitable." Whatever this
revolution will look like, the
students in the workshop are
convinced that it will not be just a
technical revolution, but social,
economic, and political as well.
