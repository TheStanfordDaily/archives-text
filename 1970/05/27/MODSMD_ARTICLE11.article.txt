# Black Exchange Set
## 
### 
As an extension of the
"study-someplace-else" concept
Stanford has established an
exchange program with
Morehouse College in Atlanta.
Five Stanford students will
attend the all black campus for
one year in a cross country
cultural exchange. According to
Prof. Ladula Louis Padulo, a
visiting professor from
Morehouse, "the program will
provide a new dimension of
cultural relativism by exposing
interested students to the black
world's foremost academic
institutions."
The University Fellows will
provide the initial participants
with round trip air fare. Padulo, a
professor of electrical engineering,
will administer the pilot program
through the office of the new
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
Dr. James Gibbs.
Padulo discussed several aspects
of the exchange. "The program is
a friendly arrangement; Stanford
students are able to visit a black
cultural center and Morehouse is
exposed to the west coast black."

Furthermore it will allow blacks
from this part of the nation to
"be a part of the black
community which is changing the
South."
Morehouse College is a member
of the Atlanta University Center,
a cluster of six affiliates including
Clark College, Spelman College,
Morris Brown College, Atlanta
University, ( and the
Interdenominational Theological
Center. These affiliated colleges
have adjacent and overlapping
campuses and the 7,000 men and
women enrolled there have
complete access to the courses,
faculty and cultural life of each
school.
Founded in \867 for the
education of Morehouse
is today a arts college
serving a student Jbody of 1,000
young men from 36 states and ten
foreign countries. Because of the
quality of her faculty, library and
curriculum, Morehouse was
inducted into Phi Beta Kappa in
1967 and is one of the three
predominatly Negro institutions
in this society.
In addition to traditional
graduate offerings, Atlanta
University offers special programs
in social work, Black studies,
Black literature and education
which attract scholars from all
over the world. Thus, a feature of
this program will be that graduate
students may also profitably
participate in it.
Further information and
applications can be obtained from
Prof. Padu'o.
