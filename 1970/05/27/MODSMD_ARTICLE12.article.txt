# Survey Sent To Graduates
## 
### 
The Stanford Graduate Survey
has been sent to over 1000
randomly selected graduate
students this week. The
questionnaire, which was written
by seven graduatestudents and
one faculty member, is designed
as a detailed survey of opinion on
the Stanford graduate experience
as it affects students over-all and
within individual departments. It
has been endorsed and funded by
the Graduate Student Association
and by the Dean of the Graduate
Division.
This survey, grew out of the
need for studies more ambitious
than the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), in which little
attention was directed to graduate
education. It is intended to help
establish guidelines for reform and
further study. All findings will be
published and made available by
the beginning of the Fall Quarter.
Graduate students who receive
this questionnaire are encouraged
to complete and return it as soon
as possible. The results will be
useful only if the response rate is
high.
