						Corps Proposed
## 
### 
Formation of a United Nations Volunteer Corps similar in design to
the Peace Corps has been proposed to the UN General Assembly by
Secretary General U Thant.
If approved, the UN Corps would be formed of multi-national
teams of volunteers working during two year periods in self help
projects of the UN and its agencies such as UNICEF. The teams would
work in countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America and would serve
only as requested by persons in the specific countries.
The Volunteer Corps proposal is scheduled for consideration by the
UN General Assembly this fall and delegates are urging student
support to lobby in favor of the proposal. A meeting is scheduled for
this afternoon at 4 in TMU '267 to discuss the U Thant proposal and
how students can help support it.
Ray McGee, sponsor of the meeting here, says that student
volunteers will be needed this summer and fall to lobby in different
delegations of the UN. In addition help will be needed to call on U.S.
Congress members to support funding of the Corps and students will
be needed in the local area to work in developing self-help project
ideas.
