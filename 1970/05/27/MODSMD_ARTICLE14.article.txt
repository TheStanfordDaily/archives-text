DEAN 'S LIST
In recognition of their superior
academic work, the Dean of
Students confers honors upon
undergraduate students.
Normally, these students are
selected on the basis of their
records at Stanford during the
Autumn, Winter and Spring
Quarters of the academic year.
However, the requirements for the
Dean's List have been altered for
the academic year 1969-70: the
quarters considered will be
Autumn and Winter only; the
student must also be registered
Spring Quarter.
If a student has not been
registered for one of these three
quarters, but has attended the
summer following, this summer
quarter may be substituted for the
quarter away. A summer quarter
before the Autumn, Winter Spring
Quarters will be used as a
substitute for one of the regular
three only in the cases of students
at an overseas campus.
The minimum grade point
average necessary for the Dean's
List will remain the same, 3.20,
for the two quarters; a student
must have completed a minimum
of 26 units of letter-graded work
in the two quarters.
BIOLOGY
For the remainder of the
quarter, the Biology Department
will host nightly "rap sessions" on
population growth, ecology and
environmental control, defoliation
in Vietnam, "or anything
anybody wants to talk about."
Faculty and graduates will be
"rapping" from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.
daily in the Barth Room, third
floor of Herrin Laboratories. The
sessions will run all day Saturdays
and Sundays.
SHUMWAY
Dr. Norman Shumway, chief of

TTiree transplants have been
completed in the last 10 days and
the patients are progressing
