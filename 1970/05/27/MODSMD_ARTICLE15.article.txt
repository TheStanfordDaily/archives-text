# Dunning's Road To The Pros
## 
### 
B> JOHN ARTHUR
By this time next week, Steve
Dunning, junior, econ major and
amateur baseball player, may be
richer by several thousand dollars.
By how many thousand dollars
no one can be sure right now. But
the chances are good that the club
which draws the rights to Dunning
will be generous with its cash. In
fact, offers of up to $70,000 have
been mentioned.
"I have no idea where that
figure came from," Dunning says
of the recently-published report,
"but I'm in favor of it!" Probably
more reasonable are estimates in
the $40-50,000 range, a not
unlikely price for the player some
scouts consider the top amateur
baseball prospect of this year.
The views of Dick Hager, a
scout with the Kansas City
Royals, seem typical of those
shared by most of the local
baseball intelligentsia: "Steve's
the top prospect around here in
several years. Right now he does
everything better than Tom
Seaver could do at a similar stage.
If ho stays healthy, there's no
reason why he can't make it."

"If there's a 'can't miss' kind of
guy, he's one," says Stanford
pitching coach Tom Dunton.
"We've had scouts tell us they'd
put him on a major league roster
right now."
At the age of 21, Steve
Dunning appears to be on the
threshold of a possibly brilliant
career in professional baseball, a
development which he'd consider
the realization of a "childhood
dream."
"I've always been blessed with
a strong arm and a natural
fastball," the righthander says,
"but coach Dunton taugnt me
how to pitch. I got the slider
down last year and now I'm
working on my curve."
Quite a few Pacific-8 batters
have also tried to work on
Dunning's curve, slider and
fastball, but they've been
considerably less successful.
Playing for a team with a losing
conference record, Steve led the
league in strikeouts (50 in 39
innings) while compiling a 4-1
record this year. Overall, in 108
innings, Stanford's leading pitcher
fanned 144 batters, setting a new
record for Indians hurlers in the
process.
But Dunning is more than an
exceptional pitcher. "He's really a
leader," says teammate Dick
Borchers, "He was always
encouraging the other guys. The
players had the highest respect for
him, and that's why he was
elected one of the three captains
for next year along with Bob
Marshall and myself."
"Steve had such an outstanding
year \hat he was able to take over
much of the leadership of the
club,"says coach Ray Young.
"He was loose all the time and
had a lot to do with how the
other players, especially the
younger ones, reacted."
Dunning, who usually played
third whenhe wasn't pitching,
kept up a constant stream of
chatter from that position, and his

hustle whenever on the field was
continually impressive.
"My parents had me start
playing ball when I was three or
four years old, but they never
pushed me," the blond,
200-pounder recalls. "They taught
me to hustle all the time, to
always give 100 percent, and
believe me, it's really paid off. I
try never to do anything half
way."
This kind of philosophy led
Dunning to what he calls "My
own personal weight program. It
consists of sit-ups, pull-ups and
most of all, chin-ups, which have
built up my shoulders and chest.
People can't believe I only weigh
200 pounds, but it's true. It's also
only five pounds more than I
weighed as a freshman, but the
weight has just shifted upwards."
"He's really worked hard,"
Dunton stresses. "When the
pitchers run in the outfield, Steve
always does a few extra sprints.
And he's a very coachable guy.
This year he's grooved his
delivery, which accounts for his
incredible statistics."
Dunning was an infielder in
high school, yet did a lot of
pitching in summer leagues. But it
wasn't until about a year and a
half ago that the professional
scouts began to take notice.
"When I came here as a freshman,
all I wanted to do was to make
the varsity. Becoming a
major-leaguer is something you
never really think could happen to
you. But recently, I've really
thought that I could make it in

the majors," he says.
So too do the scouts, which
brings us back to the cash angle.
"I've been led to believe that I'll
be drafted early, and if the
money's there, I'm going to sign.
Even if I had another good year, I
couldn't turn down a good offer
now.
"Still, if the offer isn't good, 1
won't hesitate to come back to
school. Playing ball here is as good
as in a Double A league. In any
case, I'll insist that there be a
clause allowing me to continue
my education in the off-season in
any contract I sign now."
When the time comes to
consider a contract, Steve will ask
the advice of coaches Young and
Dunton, both of whom admit that
they'd be sorry to see him go but
insist that they'd urge him to take
a good offer. "You've got to
consider what's best for the
individual," says Young.
"This kind of thing enhances
our program," Dunton remarks,
"other kids will see how we can
be a steppingstone to the big
leagues. The sooner he can get
going in the pros, the better."
So Steve Dunning, who says"I
think I could play baseball games
forever," might be doing just that.
With virtually all the attributes
one would look for in a
professional athlete—talent,
strength and an exceptional
attitude—Dunning's next uniform
might well be that of his home
town team, the San Diego Padres.
As scout Hager says, "This guy
is something super, I'll tell ya!"

richer by several thousand dollars.
By how many thousand dollars
no one can be sure right now. But
the chances are good that the club
which draws the rights to Dunning
will be generous with its cash. In
fact, offers of up to $70,000 have
been mentioned.
"I have no idea where that
figure came from," Dunning says
of the recently-published report,
"but I'm in favor of it!" Probably
more reasonable are estimates in
the $40-50,000 range, a not
unlikely price for the player some
scouts consider the top amateur
baseball prospect of this year.
The views of Dick Hager, a
scout with the Kansas City
Royals, seem typical of those
shared by most of the local
baseball intelligentsia: "Steve's
the top prospect around here in
several years. Right now he does
everything better than Tom
Seaver could do at a similar stage.
If ho stays healthy, there's no
reason why he can't make it."

"If there's a 'can't miss' kind of
guy, he's one," says Stanford
pitching coach Tom Dunton.
"We've had scouts tell us they'd
put him on a major league roster
right now."
At the age of 21, Steve
Dunning appears to be on the
threshold of a possibly brilliant
career in professional baseball, a
development which he'd consider
the realization of a "childhood
dream."
"I've always been blessed with
a strong arm and a natural
fastball," the righthander says,
"but coach Dunton taugnt me
how to pitch. I got the slider
down last year and now I'm
working on my curve."
Quite a few Pacific-8 batters
have also tried to work on
Dunning's curve, slider and
fastball, but they've been
considerably less successful.
Playing for a team with a losing
conference record, Steve led the
league in strikeouts (50 in 39
innings) while compiling a 4-1
record this year. Overall, in 108
innings, Stanford's leading pitcher
fanned 144 batters, setting a new
record for Indians hurlers in the
process.
But Dunning is more than an
exceptional pitcher. "He's really a
leader," says teammate Dick
Borchers, "He was always
encouraging the other guys. The
players had the highest respect for
him, and that's why he was
elected one of the three captains
for next year along with Bob
Marshall and myself."
"Steve had such an outstanding
year \hat he was able to take over
much of the leadership of the
club,"says coach Ray Young.
"He was loose all the time and
had a lot to do with how the
other players, especially the
younger ones, reacted."
Dunning, who usually played
third whenhe wasn't pitching,
kept up a constant stream of
chatter from that position, and his

hustle whenever on the field was
continually impressive.
"My parents had me start
playing ball when I was three or
four years old, but they never
pushed me," the blond,
200-pounder recalls. "They taught
me to hustle all the time, to
always give 100 percent, and
believe me, it's really paid off. I
try never to do anything half
way."
This kind of philosophy led
Dunning to what he calls "My
own personal weight program. It
consists of sit-ups, pull-ups and
most of all, chin-ups, which have
built up my shoulders and chest.
People can't believe I only weigh
200 pounds, but it's true. It's also
only five pounds more than I
weighed as a freshman, but the
weight has just shifted upwards."
"He's really worked hard,"
Dunton stresses. "When the
pitchers run in the outfield, Steve
always does a few extra sprints.
And he's a very coachable guy.
This year he's grooved his
delivery, which accounts for his
incredible statistics."
Dunning was an infielder in
high school, yet did a lot of
pitching in summer leagues. But it
wasn't until about a year and a
half ago that the professional
scouts began to take notice.
"When I came here as a freshman,
all I wanted to do was to make
the varsity. Becoming a
major-leaguer is something you
never really think could happen to
you. But recently, I've really
thought that I could make it in

the majors," he says.
So too do the scouts, which
brings us back to the cash angle.
"I've been led to believe that I'll
be drafted early, and if the
money's there, I'm going to sign.
Even if I had another good year, I
couldn't turn down a good offer
now.
"Still, if the offer isn't good, 1
won't hesitate to come back to
school. Playing ball here is as good
as in a Double A league. In any
case, I'll insist that there be a
clause allowing me to continue
my education in the off-season in
any contract I sign now."
When the time comes to
consider a contract, Steve will ask
the advice of coaches Young and
Dunton, both of whom admit that
they'd be sorry to see him go but
insist that they'd urge him to take
a good offer. "You've got to
consider what's best for the
individual," says Young.
"This kind of thing enhances
our program," Dunton remarks,
"other kids will see how we can
be a steppingstone to the big
leagues. The sooner he can get
going in the pros, the better."
So Steve Dunning, who says"I
think I could play baseball games
forever," might be doing just that.
With virtually all the attributes
one would look for in a
professional athlete—talent,
strength and an exceptional
attitude—Dunning's next uniform
might well be that of his home
town team, the San Diego Padres.
As scout Hager says, "This guy
is something super, I'll tell ya!"

which draws the rights to Dunning
will be generous with its cash. In
fact, offers of up to $70,000 have
been mentioned.
"I have no idea where that
figure came from," Dunning says
of the recently-published report,
"but I'm in favor of it!" Probably
more reasonable are estimates in
the $40-50,000 range, a not
unlikely price for the player some
scouts consider the top amateur
baseball prospect of this year.
The views of Dick Hager, a
scout with the Kansas City
Royals, seem typical of those
shared by most of the local
baseball intelligentsia: "Steve's
the top prospect around here in
several years. Right now he does
everything better than Tom
Seaver could do at a similar stage.
If ho stays healthy, there's no
reason why he can't make it."

"If there's a 'can't miss' kind of
guy, he's one," says Stanford
pitching coach Tom Dunton.
"We've had scouts tell us they'd
put him on a major league roster
right now."
At the age of 21, Steve
Dunning appears to be on the
threshold of a possibly brilliant
career in professional baseball, a
development which he'd consider
the realization of a "childhood
dream."
"I've always been blessed with
a strong arm and a natural
fastball," the righthander says,
"but coach Dunton taugnt me
how to pitch. I got the slider
down last year and now I'm
working on my curve."
Quite a few Pacific-8 batters
have also tried to work on
Dunning's curve, slider and
fastball, but they've been
considerably less successful.
Playing for a team with a losing
conference record, Steve led the
league in strikeouts (50 in 39
innings) while compiling a 4-1
record this year. Overall, in 108
innings, Stanford's leading pitcher
fanned 144 batters, setting a new
record for Indians hurlers in the
process.
But Dunning is more than an
exceptional pitcher. "He's really a
leader," says teammate Dick
Borchers, "He was always
encouraging the other guys. The
players had the highest respect for
him, and that's why he was
elected one of the three captains
for next year along with Bob
Marshall and myself."
"Steve had such an outstanding
year \hat he was able to take over
much of the leadership of the
club,"says coach Ray Young.
"He was loose all the time and
had a lot to do with how the
other players, especially the
younger ones, reacted."
Dunning, who usually played
third whenhe wasn't pitching,
kept up a constant stream of
chatter from that position, and his

hustle whenever on the field was
continually impressive.
"My parents had me start
playing ball when I was three or
four years old, but they never
pushed me," the blond,
200-pounder recalls. "They taught
me to hustle all the time, to
always give 100 percent, and
believe me, it's really paid off. I
try never to do anything half
way."
This kind of philosophy led
Dunning to what he calls "My
own personal weight program. It
consists of sit-ups, pull-ups and
most of all, chin-ups, which have
built up my shoulders and chest.
People can't believe I only weigh
200 pounds, but it's true. It's also
only five pounds more than I
weighed as a freshman, but the
weight has just shifted upwards."
"He's really worked hard,"
Dunton stresses. "When the
pitchers run in the outfield, Steve
always does a few extra sprints.
And he's a very coachable guy.
This year he's grooved his
delivery, which accounts for his
incredible statistics."
Dunning was an infielder in
high school, yet did a lot of
pitching in summer leagues. But it
wasn't until about a year and a
half ago that the professional
scouts began to take notice.
"When I came here as a freshman,
all I wanted to do was to make
the varsity. Becoming a
major-leaguer is something you
never really think could happen to
you. But recently, I've really
thought that I could make it in

the majors," he says.
So too do the scouts, which
brings us back to the cash angle.
"I've been led to believe that I'll
be drafted early, and if the
money's there, I'm going to sign.
Even if I had another good year, I
couldn't turn down a good offer
now.
"Still, if the offer isn't good, 1
won't hesitate to come back to
school. Playing ball here is as good
as in a Double A league. In any
case, I'll insist that there be a
clause allowing me to continue
my education in the off-season in
any contract I sign now."
When the time comes to
consider a contract, Steve will ask
the advice of coaches Young and
Dunton, both of whom admit that
they'd be sorry to see him go but
insist that they'd urge him to take
a good offer. "You've got to
consider what's best for the
individual," says Young.
"This kind of thing enhances
our program," Dunton remarks,
"other kids will see how we can
be a steppingstone to the big
leagues. The sooner he can get
going in the pros, the better."
So Steve Dunning, who says"I
think I could play baseball games
forever," might be doing just that.
With virtually all the attributes
one would look for in a
professional athlete—talent,
strength and an exceptional
attitude—Dunning's next uniform
might well be that of his home
town team, the San Diego Padres.
As scout Hager says, "This guy
is something super, I'll tell ya!"
