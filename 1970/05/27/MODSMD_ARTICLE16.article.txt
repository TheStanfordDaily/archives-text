# Stanford By The Sea
## Oceanography And Sewage 
### DICK BUXTON 
Several blocks away from the old boarded up canning houses and
the small shops of Cannery Row in Pacific Grove is a headquarters for
year around study and research in marine biology.
Operating as part of Stanford, the Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove is the oldest marine biological station on the Pacific
Coast and the third oldest in the nation. Graduate students, resident
faculty and researchers study at the station year-round; special spring
and summer courses are offered for advanced study in marine biology
and biological oceanography to qualified students and teachers.
Director ol the facility is professor of biology John Phillips whose
recent study and research at Hopkins has been directed to the
determination ol DDT levels and distribution of DDT in the marine
environment.
Phillip's research reflects the growing interest at the station in
studying problems of man and his environment. For example, last
year's spring course for undergraduates studied DDT and its effects on
the marine environment and this year spring undergrads are doing
projects relating to sewage pollution in the marine environment.

HOPKINS DIRECTOR—Dr. John Phillips
Phillips says that faculty, staff and student interest has brought about
the increasing focus at Hopkins on environmental questions and man's
effects on the marine world.
He feels that such student and faculty research will provide badly
missing information to the community about general and specific
problems — such as pollution effects in the ocean or in Monterey Bay.
Study must be done to bridge the gap between scientific problems and
social involvement says Phillips.
Old and New Buildings
Hopkins was established in 1891 and was first located on land at
Point Aulon (now known as Lover's Point) just west of the present
site. In the early 1900's Lover's Point was judged to be inadequate
to provide for long range developmental needs of the station and the
facility was moved to its present site on Point Cabrillo.
The Alexander Agassiz Laboratory built in 1917 was the first
building on the present site. It was renovated in 1960 and now
provides space and equipment for studies on the biology and ecology
of marine invertebrates, fishes and algae.
In 1928 Loeb Laboratory was built with Rockerfeller Foundation
funds. It is named after experimental biologist Jacques Loeb and
provides primarily experimental research facilities.
National Science Foundation (NSF) funds provided for the
completion in 1963 of the third major building, the Marinostat which
houses more laboratories and research facilities in addition to
environmental control rooms. Large cast iron pipes run through the
laboratory buildings and constantly circulate fresh sea water to the
labs. The marinostat circulates water at colder than surface ocean
temperatures so that deep water animals can be kept alive and studied
at the station.
Year-round research has been going on since 1918 at Hopkins and
since 1919 the California Department of Fish and Game has
maintained an office and laboratory at the station.
New Facility Proposed
Plans for an entirely new facility to replace the present buildings
were developed two years ago. Phillips says, however, that
implementation and construction are completely dependent upon
outside financing. One half of the planned $7 million facility will be
financed, according to Phillips, by grants from governmental and
private science agencies, but he stresses the need for finding outside
gifts and financing to provide the remainder of the funds. Other
facilities connected with Hopkins are the TAGE, a 40 foot research
vessel, which has been used during the past 1 5 years on a research
project monitoring specific oceanograph ic features mainly in
Monterey Bay and the Proteus, a 98 foot converted tuna clipper
which provides more adequate research facilities than the previously
owned TE VEGA-a 135 loot two-masted, steel-hulled schooner used
for oceanographic study from 1963 until 1968.
Spring Program
This spring quarter five faculty members, 15 graduate students, 23
undergrads, primarily from Stanford, and 30-40 researchers,
technical assistants and secretaries are working at Hopkins.
The undergraduates are enrolled in a 15 unit course called
"Problems in Marine Biology." The students live in surrounding
communities and at Hopkins receive training and do individual

research on specific problems in marine biology. The intensive
program for undergraduates is now in its seventh year and in large
part is funded by the National Science Foundation as an undergrad
research participation project.
Students are divided among the five faculty members to do
independent research under guidance with the expectation of
publishing some of their results. This publishing has been done each
year.
Topics during the first five years of the program centered on one
marine animal, but last year student research topics were directed to
questions about man and his environment. As was mentioned earlier,
last year's topic for research was on DDT and its effects on the marine
environment.
This year's project on sewage pollution in the marine environment
is a timely topic as recent court cases and upcoming bond elections in
the Pacific Grove area focus on the increasing problems of sewage
pollution in Monterey Bay.
Eric Bachelor and Doug Grey are two students at Hopkins this
spring studying the effects of sewage on marine algae and on the
distribution of algae in Carmel Bay just south of the station. They
have rented a house with three friends in Carmel near the bay where
all five plan to do most of their research.
According to Dr. Phillips, every year about 40 students from
Stanford and other schools apply for the spring program with 20-25
being accepted.
During the summer the station offers two live week sessions which
are attended by about 250 students, teachers and professionals.
Applications, far outnumber the available spaces in the summer session
in which varied classes include lectures, field work and laboratory
work.
Sewage Research
Dr. Welton Lee, assistant professor of biology and a faculty
member at Hopkins has been researching problems dealing with the
physiological ecology of marine organisms. His specific area of study
has been related to the problem of color change in marine isopods. He
is investigating the possibility that environmental changes cause
changes in the shell color of these organisms.

Lee has also been involved with other projects relating directly
the study of sewage pollution in the marine environment. He says that
most of the available information about pollution concerns fresh
water environments and adds that effects of pollution in marine
environments are very different and need to be carefully studied by
themselves.
Lee has been working on a Bay Benthic Study (study of deep
water) with the Naval Post-Graduate School in Monterey. The
researchers have been monitoring changes in the environment of the
Monterey Canyon, one of the largest canyons in the world, which
starts at the mouth of the Salinas River about two miles off shore and
extends toward Santa Cruz. It is about one to two miles deep.
Pollution researchers are investigating the effects of sewage and
pesticide and heavy metals which have been dumped in the bay. Lee
hopes that pollution along the continental shelf of the Pacific Ocean
can be halted before harmful effects become uncontrollable on the
"richest and most important" ocean source of food and biological
variety.
Other faculty members at Hopkins besides Phillips and Lee are Dr.
David Epel, assistant professor of biology who is an embryologist
presently studying the effect of amino acids on sea urchin
development, Dr. Donald Abbott, and Dr. Malvern Gilmartin.

implementation and construction are completely dependent upon
outside financing. One half of the planned $7 million facility will be
financed, according to Phillips, by grants from governmental and
private science agencies, but he stresses the need for finding outside
gifts and financing to provide the remainder of the funds. Other
facilities connected with Hopkins are the TAGE, a 40 foot research
vessel, which has been used during the past 1 5 years on a research
project monitoring specific oceanograph ic features mainly in
Monterey Bay and the Proteus, a 98 foot converted tuna clipper
which provides more adequate research facilities than the previously
owned TE VEGA-a 135 loot two-masted, steel-hulled schooner used
for oceanographic study from 1963 until 1968.
Spring Program
This spring quarter five faculty members, 15 graduate students, 23
undergrads, primarily from Stanford, and 30-40 researchers,
technical assistants and secretaries are working at Hopkins.
The undergraduates are enrolled in a 15 unit course called
"Problems in Marine Biology." The students live in surrounding
communities and at Hopkins receive training and do individual

research on specific problems in marine biology. The intensive
program for undergraduates is now in its seventh year and in large
part is funded by the National Science Foundation as an undergrad
research participation project.
Students are divided among the five faculty members to do
independent research under guidance with the expectation of
publishing some of their results. This publishing has been done each
year.
Topics during the first five years of the program centered on one
marine animal, but last year student research topics were directed to
questions about man and his environment. As was mentioned earlier,
last year's topic for research was on DDT and its effects on the marine
environment.
This year's project on sewage pollution in the marine environment
is a timely topic as recent court cases and upcoming bond elections in
the Pacific Grove area focus on the increasing problems of sewage
pollution in Monterey Bay.
Eric Bachelor and Doug Grey are two students at Hopkins this
spring studying the effects of sewage on marine algae and on the
distribution of algae in Carmel Bay just south of the station. They
have rented a house with three friends in Carmel near the bay where
all five plan to do most of their research.
According to Dr. Phillips, every year about 40 students from
Stanford and other schools apply for the spring program with 20-25
being accepted.
During the summer the station offers two live week sessions which
are attended by about 250 students, teachers and professionals.
Applications, far outnumber the available spaces in the summer session
in which varied classes include lectures, field work and laboratory
work.
Sewage Research
Dr. Welton Lee, assistant professor of biology and a faculty
member at Hopkins has been researching problems dealing with the
physiological ecology of marine organisms. His specific area of study
has been related to the problem of color change in marine isopods. He
is investigating the possibility that environmental changes cause
changes in the shell color of these organisms.

Lee has also been involved with other projects relating directly
the study of sewage pollution in the marine environment. He says that
most of the available information about pollution concerns fresh
water environments and adds that effects of pollution in marine
environments are very different and need to be carefully studied by
themselves.
Lee has been working on a Bay Benthic Study (study of deep
water) with the Naval Post-Graduate School in Monterey. The
researchers have been monitoring changes in the environment of the
Monterey Canyon, one of the largest canyons in the world, which
starts at the mouth of the Salinas River about two miles off shore and
extends toward Santa Cruz. It is about one to two miles deep.
Pollution researchers are investigating the effects of sewage and
pesticide and heavy metals which have been dumped in the bay. Lee
hopes that pollution along the continental shelf of the Pacific Ocean
can be halted before harmful effects become uncontrollable on the
"richest and most important" ocean source of food and biological
variety.
Other faculty members at Hopkins besides Phillips and Lee are Dr.
David Epel, assistant professor of biology who is an embryologist
presently studying the effect of amino acids on sea urchin
development, Dr. Donald Abbott, and Dr. Malvern Gilmartin.

Several blocks away from the old boarded up canning houses and

year around study and research in marine biology.
Operating as part of Stanford, the Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove is the oldest marine biological station on the Pacific
Coast and the third oldest in the nation. Graduate students, resident
faculty and researchers study at the station year-round; special spring
and summer courses are offered for advanced study in marine biology
and biological oceanography to qualified students and teachers.
Director ol the facility is professor of biology John Phillips whose
recent study and research at Hopkins has been directed to the
determination ol DDT levels and distribution of DDT in the marine
environment.
Phillip's research reflects the growing interest at the station in
studying problems of man and his environment. For example, last
year's spring course for undergraduates studied DDT and its effects on
the marine environment and this year spring undergrads are doing
projects relating to sewage pollution in the marine environment.

HOPKINS DIRECTOR—Dr. John Phillips
Phillips says that faculty, staff and student interest has brought about
the increasing focus at Hopkins on environmental questions and man's
effects on the marine world.
He feels that such student and faculty research will provide badly
missing information to the community about general and specific
problems — such as pollution effects in the ocean or in Monterey Bay.
Study must be done to bridge the gap between scientific problems and
social involvement says Phillips.
Old and New Buildings
Hopkins was established in 1891 and was first located on land at
Point Aulon (now known as Lover's Point) just west of the present
site. In the early 1900's Lover's Point was judged to be inadequate
to provide for long range developmental needs of the station and the
facility was moved to its present site on Point Cabrillo.
The Alexander Agassiz Laboratory built in 1917 was the first
building on the present site. It was renovated in 1960 and now
provides space and equipment for studies on the biology and ecology
of marine invertebrates, fishes and algae.
In 1928 Loeb Laboratory was built with Rockerfeller Foundation
funds. It is named after experimental biologist Jacques Loeb and
provides primarily experimental research facilities.
National Science Foundation (NSF) funds provided for the
completion in 1963 of the third major building, the Marinostat which
houses more laboratories and research facilities in addition to
environmental control rooms. Large cast iron pipes run through the
laboratory buildings and constantly circulate fresh sea water to the
labs. The marinostat circulates water at colder than surface ocean
temperatures so that deep water animals can be kept alive and studied
at the station.
Year-round research has been going on since 1918 at Hopkins and
since 1919 the California Department of Fish and Game has
maintained an office and laboratory at the station.

changes in the shell color of these organisms.

Lee has also been involved with other projects relating directly
the study of sewage pollution in the marine environment. He says that
most of the available information about pollution concerns fresh
water environments and adds that effects of pollution in marine
environments are very different and need to be carefully studied by
themselves.
Lee has been working on a Bay Benthic Study (study of deep
water) with the Naval Post-Graduate School in Monterey. The
researchers have been monitoring changes in the environment of the
Monterey Canyon, one of the largest canyons in the world, which
starts at the mouth of the Salinas River about two miles off shore and
extends toward Santa Cruz. It is about one to two miles deep.
Pollution researchers are investigating the effects of sewage and
pesticide and heavy metals which have been dumped in the bay. Lee
hopes that pollution along the continental shelf of the Pacific Ocean
can be halted before harmful effects become uncontrollable on the
"richest and most important" ocean source of food and biological
variety.
Other faculty members at Hopkins besides Phillips and Lee are Dr.
David Epel, assistant professor of biology who is an embryologist
presently studying the effect of amino acids on sea urchin
development, Dr. Donald Abbott, and Dr. Malvern Gilmartin.

Several blocks away from the old boarded up canning houses and
the small shops of Cannery Row in Pacific Grove is a headquarters for
year around study and research in marine biology.
Operating as part of Stanford, the Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove is the oldest marine biological station on the Pacific
Coast and the third oldest in the nation. Graduate students, resident
faculty and researchers study at the station year-round; special spring
and summer courses are offered for advanced study in marine biology
and biological oceanography to qualified students and teachers.
Director ol the facility is professor of biology John Phillips whose
recent study and research at Hopkins has been directed to the
determination ol DDT levels and distribution of DDT in the marine
environment.
Phillip's research reflects the growing interest at the station in
studying problems of man and his environment. For example, last
year's spring course for undergraduates studied DDT and its effects on
the marine environment and this year spring undergrads are doing
projects relating to sewage pollution in the marine environment.

HOPKINS DIRECTOR—Dr. John Phillips
Phillips says that faculty, staff and student interest has brought about
the increasing focus at Hopkins on environmental questions and man's
effects on the marine world.
He feels that such student and faculty research will provide badly
missing information to the community about general and specific
problems — such as pollution effects in the ocean or in Monterey Bay.
Study must be done to bridge the gap between scientific problems and
social involvement says Phillips.
Old and New Buildings
Hopkins was established in 1891 and was first located on land at
Point Aulon (now known as Lover's Point) just west of the present
site. In the early 1900's Lover's Point was judged to be inadequate
to provide for long range developmental needs of the station and the
facility was moved to its present site on Point Cabrillo.
The Alexander Agassiz Laboratory built in 1917 was the first
building on the present site. It was renovated in 1960 and now
provides space and equipment for studies on the biology and ecology
of marine invertebrates, fishes and algae.
In 1928 Loeb Laboratory was built with Rockerfeller Foundation
funds. It is named after experimental biologist Jacques Loeb and
provides primarily experimental research facilities.
National Science Foundation (NSF) funds provided for the
completion in 1963 of the third major building, the Marinostat which
houses more laboratories and research facilities in addition to
environmental control rooms. Large cast iron pipes run through the
laboratory buildings and constantly circulate fresh sea water to the
labs. The marinostat circulates water at colder than surface ocean
temperatures so that deep water animals can be kept alive and studied
at the station.
Year-round research has been going on since 1918 at Hopkins and
since 1919 the California Department of Fish and Game has
maintained an office and laboratory at the station.
New Facility Proposed
Plans for an entirely new facility to replace the present buildings
were developed two years ago. Phillips says, however, that
implementation and construction are completely dependent upon
outside financing. One half of the planned $7 million facility will be
financed, according to Phillips, by grants from governmental and
private science agencies, but he stresses the need for finding outside
gifts and financing to provide the remainder of the funds. Other
facilities connected with Hopkins are the TAGE, a 40 foot research
vessel, which has been used during the past 1 5 years on a research
project monitoring specific oceanograph ic features mainly in
Monterey Bay and the Proteus, a 98 foot converted tuna clipper
which provides more adequate research facilities than the previously
owned TE VEGA-a 135 loot two-masted, steel-hulled schooner used
for oceanographic study from 1963 until 1968.
Spring Program
This spring quarter five faculty members, 15 graduate students, 23
undergrads, primarily from Stanford, and 30-40 researchers,
technical assistants and secretaries are working at Hopkins.
The undergraduates are enrolled in a 15 unit course called
"Problems in Marine Biology." The students live in surrounding
communities and at Hopkins receive training and do individual

research on specific problems in marine biology. The intensive
program for undergraduates is now in its seventh year and in large
part is funded by the National Science Foundation as an undergrad
research participation project.
Students are divided among the five faculty members to do
independent research under guidance with the expectation of
publishing some of their results. This publishing has been done each
year.
Topics during the first five years of the program centered on one
marine animal, but last year student research topics were directed to
questions about man and his environment. As was mentioned earlier,
last year's topic for research was on DDT and its effects on the marine
environment.
This year's project on sewage pollution in the marine environment
is a timely topic as recent court cases and upcoming bond elections in
the Pacific Grove area focus on the increasing problems of sewage
pollution in Monterey Bay.
Eric Bachelor and Doug Grey are two students at Hopkins this
spring studying the effects of sewage on marine algae and on the
distribution of algae in Carmel Bay just south of the station. They
have rented a house with three friends in Carmel near the bay where
all five plan to do most of their research.
According to Dr. Phillips, every year about 40 students from
Stanford and other schools apply for the spring program with 20-25
being accepted.
During the summer the station offers two live week sessions which
are attended by about 250 students, teachers and professionals.
Applications, far outnumber the available spaces in the summer session
in which varied classes include lectures, field work and laboratory
work.
Sewage Research
Dr. Welton Lee, assistant professor of biology and a faculty
member at Hopkins has been researching problems dealing with the
physiological ecology of marine organisms. His specific area of study
has been related to the problem of color change in marine isopods. He
is investigating the possibility that environmental changes cause
changes in the shell color of these organisms.

Lee has also been involved with other projects relating directly
the study of sewage pollution in the marine environment. He says that
