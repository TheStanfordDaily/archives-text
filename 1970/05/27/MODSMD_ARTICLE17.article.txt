# Student Describes Courses At Marine Biology Station

### WILLIAM J COOKE 
(Editor's note: William Cooke
is a junior biology major studying
at Hopkins Marine Station this
spring.)
"A good opportunity." "It's
discouraging." "A groove."
"Actually, I think it's a good
course, now don't get me wrong."
"How do I know if its good, I've
never done this stuff before."
These are varied reactions
among twenty students in one of
Stanford's more distinctive
courses. The program is Biology
175H, Problems in Marine
Biology, a co-ordinated program
of individual research in aspects of
Marine Biology with a focus on
one major topic of concern.
Though most students in the
program are from Stanford,
outside applications are accepted
and this year a student from U.C.
Santa Cruz, a student from Moss
Landing, the marine station of the
California state colleges, and a
student from Massachusetts are
also in the course.
Last year, and again this year,
the program has moved into what
might be called "relevant
biology." Work done last spring in
pesticide research yielded much
information about the
'interactions of DDT and other
persistant pesticides with the
marine environment. The topic
this year is sewage pollution.
Regular Class Sections
During the initial three week
period, when regular class sessions
and labs were held, the students
were introduced to the local
marine flora and fauna, and they
familiarized themselves with
techniques that would later be
employed on individual projects.
Operations held during the first
three weeks with the class
working together included:
biological surveys along polluted
and unpolluted sections of the
coast line; bacteriological,

chemical and toxicological testing
of polluted waters; and current
studies using drift bottles and dye
packets.
The area surveyed initially was
Point Pinos on the northwest tip
of the Monterey peninsula, where
the city of Pacific Grove
discharges its sewage. The first
three weeks included an
introducation to methods of
sewage treatment by the director
of the Monterey sewage treatment
plant as well as a tour of that
facility. After this the students
developed and presented their
ideas for individual projects, and
after faculty approval, began work
on them.
Many of the projects are the
outgrowth of questions raised
during the initial period. One
group of students is currently
conducting a biological survey of
the Carmel sewage outfall area;
several people are working on the
toxic activities of sew;ige,
investigating its effect both on
adult organisms, as well as on
embryoes and larvae. Chemical
surveys to chart changes in water
composition due to sewage as well
as bacteriological studies are being
conducted at several sewage
outfalls, including the offshore
outfa!! of Monterey.
direction of Faculty
The students are nominally
under the direction and guidance
of an assigned faculty member
whose background and interests
are as compatible as possible with
the students' projects. In actual
practice, students are fairly much

under their own guidance, or in
moments of doubt, they consult
the nearest, handiest professor.
Many students find this an
improvement over the more
structured classes and research
programs available on campus,
generally feeling free to proceed
by themselves with their projects.
Although this means freedom
from external pressures, the end
result includes 14 hour days and
six or seven day weeks for many
students.
The undergraduates have even
found themselves involved in the
general activities of the station.
During the weekend of April 21,
the students participated as guides
and lecturers during the station's
open house when about 4000
local residents and school children
toured the station and were
introduced to the work done
there.
The student strike at Stanford
has had some effect, 'but the
general feeling has been one of
remoteness from the action, much
like students at an overseas
campus. However, most students
and faculty members did
participate in a memorial march in
Monterey earlier this month.
Groups are also attempting to
initiate telephone and letter
writing campaigns in the local
communities. Many students find
that they get a feeling of
satisfaction gained from the work
they are doing at the station
trying to solve one small problem
dealing with biology and the
environment instead of
boycotting or striking.

"A good opportunity." "It's
discouraging." "A groove."
"Actually, I think it's a good
course, now don't get me wrong."
"How do I know if its good, I've
never done this stuff before."
These are varied reactions
among twenty students in one of
Stanford's more distinctive
courses. The program is Biology
175H, Problems in Marine
Biology, a co-ordinated program
of individual research in aspects of
Marine Biology with a focus on
one major topic of concern.
Though most students in the
program are from Stanford,
outside applications are accepted
and this year a student from U.C.
Santa Cruz, a student from Moss
Landing, the marine station of the
California state colleges, and a
student from Massachusetts are
also in the course.
Last year, and again this year,
the program has moved into what
might be called "relevant
biology." Work done last spring in
pesticide research yielded much
information about the
'interactions of DDT and other
persistant pesticides with the
marine environment. The topic
this year is sewage pollution.
Regular Class Sections
During the initial three week
period, when regular class sessions
and labs were held, the students
were introduced to the local
marine flora and fauna, and they
familiarized themselves with
techniques that would later be
employed on individual projects.
Operations held during the first
three weeks with the class
working together included:
biological surveys along polluted
and unpolluted sections of the
coast line; bacteriological,

chemical and toxicological testing
of polluted waters; and current
studies using drift bottles and dye
packets.
