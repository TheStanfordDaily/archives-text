# De Salvo Appointed
## 
### 
Lana De Salvo has been named
Director of the new Student
Center for Inovation in Research
and Education (SCIRE) by the
Center's Policy Board.
The Stanford graduate student
said yesterday,"I want to
emphasize the flexibility of the
Center. Our problem now is
letting the students know just
how much the Center can help
them."
SCIRE grants credit to
individual and group projects
which may not fit within the
orthodox University academic
structure.
"The Center," Mrs. De Salvo
explained," is a place where
students can come with any idea

and present it to us. We'll help
them write it up, give them
information on other activities in
that area and help them find a
sponsor. Then the idea goes to the
Policy Board for credit."
Mrs. De Salvo has been serving
as Director of SCIRE for about
two weeks. The Center is
currently located in Room
590 A, under the Nitery.
Several projects have already
been granted credit, according to
Mrs. De Salvo. These include an
anthropology field research
project in Mexico; an Urban
Studies program which will issue a
seven course catalogue; and the
Summer Company, a drama group
which will present plays in
Mariposa County this summer.
