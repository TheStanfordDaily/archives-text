# Senate Votes $25,000 For MECHA, BSU, AASA
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
The ASSU Senate last night
passed, 13-12, a bitterly contested
proposal from Yale Braunstein
_ .at will give 60 percent of the
budget, divided equally, to the
Black Students Union (BSU),
MECHA, and the Asian American
Student Alliance (AASA).
The resolution stipulates that
.he remaining 40 percent will be
d'vided among all other
petitioning organizations on the
basis of previous Finance
Committee procedural
-ecommendations.
The resolution,' which was
dropped unexpectedly on the
Senate, met angry and outraged
jj position from right-wing and
moderate senators. Led by ASSU
Council of Presidents member Pat
C. Shea, at least eight senators
staged a walk-out to bring the
meeting to a close due to lack of a
quorum.
"If this move is not reversed
Thursday, at the next Senate
meeting, we will walk out again
ind send this budget into next
year," declared Shea after the
meeting. Earlier, Shea had angrily
exchanged epithets with
Braunstein, as the Senate engaged
n stormy debate.
The 60 percent stipulation will

give the BSU, MECHA, and the
AASA each $8,310, out of the
$41,500 collected in student fees,
Sunday Flicks revenue, and
investment earnings. The Finance
Committee had recommended
that BSU be given $6,600,
MECHA $5,100 and AASA
$3,800.
Some members of the Senate,
who opposed Braunstein's
resolution, intend to introduce a
motion for reconsideration of the
passed resolution—a new motion
which must pass by a majority
vote—as the first order of business
Thursday night. Another senator
said he will challenge Senate
Chairman John Shoch's ruling
that Braunstein's substantive
motion on the budget
deliberations only required a
majority and not a two-thirds
vote.
Braunstein and senator Owen
Blank feel that it will be
extremely unlikely that last night's
resolution will be overturned
Thursday. They pointed out,
however, that once each
petitioning organization has been
heard once on their budget
request, the Senate will once again
debate the entire budget and that
las night's resolution could be
completely revised

The Braunstein resolution,
described by many in opposition
as an "incredibly unfair
allocation," was defended by
senator Loudin Beam, chairman
of the Finance Committee, and
senator Blank. "Each Stanford
student was only assessed one
dollar, just an amazingly small
amount for all the rich people
around here," Beam declared.
"Thus the Senate has
particularly small resources to
deal with, and we have to
determine just who really needs
what little we have most. It's
fairly easy for white groups on
campus to assess the student body
for money or to canvass—far less
easy for minority groups to do
this effectively."
"It's just damn hard for these
three groups to get any sort of
money that way," he continued.
"If we pass this resolution, we're
guaranteeing the needed money to
these groups."
If the Braunstein resolution is
not overturned by a new vote, and
opposition senators do not stage a
walk-out Thursday, the Senate
will probably begin deliberations
that night on how to divide the
remaining 40 percent of the
budget —$16,570 —among the
other nineteen petitioning
organizations.
