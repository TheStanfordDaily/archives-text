## 
### EMMA PRICE 
The Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) early this morning dismissed
charges against 16 students in
cases stemming from the April 23
sit-in at the Old Union.
The defendants were charged
with having remained in the
Union after 5 p.m., a violation of
the Campus Policy on Disruptions
and the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC)
interim order of April 19, which
gives the President authority to
dose a building when threatened
by disruption.
Charges against 13 were
dropped when the prosecution
failed to show that the defendants
had been informed of the
regulations or had failed to obey
them by leaving immediately.
Charges against John Keilch,
Jeff Youdelman. and Mark Weiss

were dropped as two of the
prosection's witnesses failed to
identify them.
The nine member SJC reached
the decisions unanimously.
Dean Peter Bulkeley testified
that he had passed out notices to
students after five o'clock. Under
vigorous cross examination by the
defendants he admitted that no
security guards had been posted in
the building after five, despite the
fact that the University felt that
files were in danger.
Assistant Dean of Students
Harold Boyd and Robert Freelon
testified that they had handed out
copies of the leaflets to student'
after five, but that they had not
given them to every student there.
Both declared that they could see
some educational value in a sit-in
Henry Norberg, senior in

psychology, took the stand next.
He stated that he could identify
certain people as having been in
the building after five o'clock. He
identified five of the defendants.
This identification was based on
notes he took at the building. He
stated that after the sit-in he went
through old Quads and
Froshbooks, trying to put
together names and faces.

The defense then moved to
dismiss charges. Peter Tamases,
one of the lawyers, stated that in
order for successful prosecution,
several items would have to have
been proved "beyond reasonable
doubt." These included the fact
that the building was in danger,
and that each individual student
had received notice of the closing
of the building and had then
remained. He pointed out that no
designatees of the administration
had been stationed at doors, in
violation of the SCLC regulations.
Forstenzer added a statement that
the trial was clearly an instrument
of political repression.
Valentine answered the defense
motions by stating that he found
evidence that notice had been
given and that students had been
positively identified.
Hearings for other defendants

arc scheduled for 1 p.m. today in
room 163 of the law school.

the Campus Policy on Disruptions
and the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC)
interim order of April 19, which
gives the President authority to
dose a building when threatened
by disruption.
Charges against 13 were
dropped when the prosecution
failed to show that the defendants
had been informed of the
regulations or had failed to obey
them by leaving immediately.
Charges against John Keilch,
Jeff Youdelman. and Mark Weiss

were dropped as two of the
prosection's witnesses failed to
identify them.
The nine member SJC reached
the decisions unanimously.
Dean Peter Bulkeley testified
that he had passed out notices to
students after five o'clock. Under
vigorous cross examination by the
defendants he admitted that no
security guards had been posted in
the building after five, despite the
fact that the University felt that
files were in danger.
Assistant Dean of Students
Harold Boyd and Robert Freelon
testified that they had handed out
copies of the leaflets to student'
after five, but that they had not
given them to every student there.
Both declared that they could see
some educational value in a sit-in
Henry Norberg, senior in

psychology, took the stand next.
He stated that he could identify
certain people as having been in
the building after five o'clock. He
identified five of the defendants.
This identification was based on
notes he took at the building. He
stated that after the sit-in he went
through old Quads and
Froshbooks, trying to put
together names and faces.

The defense then moved to
dismiss charges. Peter Tamases,
one of the lawyers, stated that in
order for successful prosecution,
several items would have to have
been proved "beyond reasonable
doubt." These included the fact
that the building was in danger,
and that each individual student
had received notice of the closing
of the building and had then
remained. He pointed out that no
designatees of the administration
had been stationed at doors, in
violation of the SCLC regulations.
Forstenzer added a statement that
the trial was clearly an instrument
of political repression.
Valentine answered the defense
motions by stating that he found
evidence that notice had been
given and that students had been
positively identified.
Hearings for other defendants

arc scheduled for 1 p.m. today in
room 163 of the law school.
