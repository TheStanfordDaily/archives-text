# Speaking To Stanford YR's
## Reagan Hits Militants-Again 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Governor Ronald Reagan,
meeting with 19 Stanford
students yesterday, had harsh
words about William Kunstler,
Angela Davis, student militants,
and Stanford's handling of this
spring's disturbances.
Reagan also criticized the
press's hard-line image of him,
saying, in many cases "the true
story is completely opposite of
whau has been spread."
The Governor said he often
denounced militants, while
pointing out the presence of
moderage students on campus.
The press, he said, only picked up
the strong criticisms.
As for hard-core radicals,
"Bums is a kind word for them,"
Reagan stated.
The Stanford students, mostly
Young Republicans, talked with
Reagan for more than an hour in
the airport Hilton Hotel. Council
of Presidents members Pat C. Shea
and Hal Mickelson, and Free
Campus Movement leader Harvey
Hukari were also present.
Stanford Appeasement
Referring specifically to
Stanford, Reagan said he was
"critical of the way the situation
has been handled." Private
universities have more leeway to
handle problems than the state
college system, the Governor
stated.
"I think private universities
have a right to say, 'If you don't
like it here, here's your
money—go away.'
"Rationalizing has reached the
point of appeasement," he added.
Speaking of disruptions
throughout the state, Reagan said
he could not intervene unless local
authorities asked for help. To
send in the National Guard
without request would be
dictatorial, he suggested.
No Audience
The only way to bring
disturbances to an end, according
to the Governor, is for the
majority of students to stop giving
radicals an audience.
Reagan said he did not appear
on many campuses for fear of
creating a riot.
William Kunstler and Angela
Davis are not equally responsible,
according to the Governor. "If
someone says your appearance
might cause a riot, any responsible
adult wouldn't go," Reagan said.

He pointed out that Kunstler and
Miss Davis spoke despite official
warnings that they might
precipitate a disturbance.
Kunstler 'Immature'
"Kunstler is very immature,
very irresponsible—he's no good,"
Reagan concluded.
Miss Davis, in addition to
appearing at disturbances, "lacks
professional ethics," according to
the Governor.
Reagan stated he did not
always oppose appearances of
radicals. He counseled in favor of
letting Jerry Rubin speak at USC,
he said, feeling that the students
could hear him and not create a
riot.
But Reagan suggested to that
university, "Maybe we should
have higher standards of what it
takes to get on campus. Maybe we
shouldn't lend the prestige of the
University to clowns."
Impartial Ethics
Reagan advocated a return to
teaching ethics that prevailed
when he was in college. "A
teacher doesn't really have the
right to say what he feels about
issues during class," he said,
suggesting that viewpoints could
be discussed outside class.
The Governor characterized
college as an opportunity to sit
back and look at all sides of

questions. When one student
pointed out the sense of urgency
created by the war and the draft,
Reagan suggested students keep in
mind the fact they might be
wrong.
After the session, YR president
Don Ayer said, "This meeting was
an important step toward
improved communication with
students. I urge the Governor to
continue holding similar meetings,
and to broaden the base of
student opinion represented."
Former YR president Roger
Reed stated he was "very

impressed" with Reagan.
"Governor Reagan is interested in
clearing up some misconceptions
as well as hearing what students
have to say," Reed commented.
"It is a sad commentary on the
state of our educational
institutions that it is impossible
for him to come to campuses and
be heard."
Reagan has been meeting with
small groups of students at several
state colleges and universities, as
well as consulting periodically
with student body presidents of
state schools.
