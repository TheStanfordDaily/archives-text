WASHINGTON (AP) - David
Eisenhower said Tuesday he
always wanted to work in
baseball. And now President
Nixon's son-in-law has hie wish, a
job with the Washington Senators.
"This is something I
particularly wanted to do for a
long time," the grandson of
President Dwight D. Eisenhower
said in the Senators' offices in
RFK Stadium where he began
working Monday.
"Now that I'm on the verge of
going into the Navy, I just
dropped everything and took the
job.
"I don't think I'd want to make
baseball a career, even as a top
executive," he said. "I just love

the game, and wanted to see this
side of it."
In confirming the new job, the
White House did not disclose what
salary is being paid but a
spokesman said that is incidental
to David's desire to learn more
about the baseball business.
Joseph R. Burke, Senators vice
president, said Eisenhower will be
working with major league and
minor league statistics.
He will compile the daily
statistics on the Washington
players for Burt Hawkins,
traveling secretary and press
relations director. He will keep
similar records on the 120 players
owned by Washington on five
minor league teams.
