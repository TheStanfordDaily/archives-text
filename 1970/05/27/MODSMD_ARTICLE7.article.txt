# Brooks Won't Accept Job From Air Force

### RALPH KOSTANT 
Vice-Provost Howard Brooks
will not leave Stanford to assume
a post in the Department of the
Air Force, the Daily has learned.
Brooks has asked his name be
withdrawn from consideration for
the post of Undersecretary of the
Air Force for Education and
Manpower. The Vice-Provost
would have replaced Dr. Curtis
Tarr, who President Nixon
appointed Director of Selective
Service in March.
When asked why he decided
not to take the position, Brooks

cited, "... personal reasons."
President Pitzer announced
April 30 that Brooks was being
considered for the post. He also
stated that the Vice-Provost had
asked to be relieved of his duties
as University representative in
ROTC negotiations with the
Department of Defense.
However, Brooks said recently,
"I was relieved by the President of
my ROTC negotiating duties in
the first week of March. I wasn't
aware of the Air Force opening at
that time, as the man I would
have replaced was not named to
his new post until March 14."
Conflict Charged
Brooks said he decided that he
would no longer act as University
ROTC negotiator as a result of
conflict of interest charges raised
in a series of articles by Bill
Freivogel. The series appeared in
the Daily last March.
The articles alleged that Brooks
had not obtained the best possible
agreement with the Department

of Defense on the future status of
ROTC at Stanford.
Last spring the Academic
Senate voted to end all credit for
ROTC. At that time Brooks
presented the minority report,
which opposed the Senate
decision.
Negotiations with the Defense
Department, in which Brooks was
the Stanford representative,
produced the partial credit plan
adopted by the Academic Senate
in January.
Reversal
In his April 30 announcement,
Pitzer asked the Advisory
Committee on ROTC" "to
reconsider, and if they desire, to
recommend the renegotiation of
the Army contract" that allowed
limited credit for ROTC courses.
Pitzer emphasized that Brooks
was not being considered for the
post while negotiating with the
Defense Department. "I have
complete confidence that Dr.
Brooks represented Stanford in
those ROTC matters assigned to
him with the greatest integrity."
He added that Brooks "stepped
aside from his involvement with
ROTC promptly when he was
approached about the Air Force
position."
When asked whether his success
in obtaining an ROTC program
with credit after the Academic
Senate had voted to abolish credit
might have prompted the
Department of Defense to support
him for the Air Force post,
Brooks said, "No. The
negotiations fell through."
Brooks served on a research
task force last summer which
studied ROTC for the Defense
Department. He stated that he
"was not a representative of the
University " on that committee.
