Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing in reply to Buzz
Thompson's article, "Self
Sustaining Sponsors," which
appeared in the May 21 ARENA.
This article exemplifies the
reporting techniques and
misrepresentation so common to
that newspaper.
When Mr. Thompson first
called me for an interview, he said
he was doing an article for the
Daily, a statement which he never
bothered to correct.
Unsuspectingly, I started
answering questions. During the
interview, he took no notes, a
convenience which apparently
made it easy to misquote me later.
So much for poor technique.
As to the content of the article,
miswording and implication were
used to the point of completely
reversing the sense of my
statements. Mr. Thompson writes
of male applicants being asked if
they had strong feelings about any
issues in general. This phrasing
makes it easy for him to conclude
that "political convictions" were
foremost in our minds, as
interviewers.
Actually, as I told Mr.
Thompson, the question usually
took the form, "What is
intellectually exciting to you?" or
even "What sorts of books do you
enjoy reading?" The purpose was
to help weed out applicants with
entirely nebulous interests as

having too little to offer the
incoming freshmen.
On the question of women's
liberation, there was a fairly
unanimous feeling in our
interviewing group that many of
the problems among freshmen
girls stem from an inability to
relate honestly to a variety of
other girls. Many also seem to
have trouble becoming involved in
the university apart from their
own courses and social lives. A
sponsor's attitude toward
women's liberation, as a life style,
is relevant to both these problems.
Through these questions, we often
learned something of an
applicant's political beliefs, but
this was obviously of secondary
concern to their ability to relate

to next year's freshmen.
Mr. Thompson also mentioned
several other "political" questions
that were asked during the
interviews. One concerned
whether the applicant was in the
habit of identifying rock
throwers. In the context of the
interview, which was dealing with
alienation within the dorm, we
felt that this question was
pragmatically justified. (TTie
applicant had already indicated,
on his application, that he was

interested in conservative politics.)
As a freshman, unexposed to
past sponsor selection
controversies, I can say that
politics is not a criteria for
sponsor selection. As Mr.
Thompson himself stated,
conservatives, this year, seemed to
display little interest in many of
the grass root university roles such
as sponsoring. Before infering
shadowy motives from out of
context questions, he might do
well to take a good long look at
the applicants we had to choose
from.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As the Vietnam War expands
into the jungles and rice fields of
Cambodia and Laos, concern
among the American public has
deeply intensified about the true
nature of our involvement in this
conflict. Questions are being
raised that must be answered if
this unending conflict is to be
allowed to continue; justifications
are needed fbr the suffering and
killing—both at home and abroad.
Furthermore, this war has some

significant and unique
ramifications for the
Asian-American. It is, after all, an
Asian war. Moreover, certain
aspects of this conflict have direct
bearing on our lives —e.g., the
sanctioning of Oriental
stereotypes. This is one reason for
holding an educational program
directed specially toward the
Asian community.
For the purpose of ameliorating
some of the tension—and
promoting understanding—there
will be an educational program
mainly for the Asian-American
community at the San Jose
Buddhist Church (640 North sth
St.) on May 30, 1970 (Memorial
Day). The general topic of the
program will be the Indochina
War with a special emphasis on
the Asian-American perspective.
After the registration at 12:00
p.m., the program will begin at
12:30. The theme for the event
will be: "Harmony in Crisis?"
First, there will be a panel
discussion that will feature such
prominent speakers Dr. Robert
Textor; he will speak on "An
Overview of U.S. Intervention in
Indochina."
From 4:00 o'clock on, as the
third part of our program, there
will be a series of implementation
workshops for those who are
inspired enough to translate some
of their concern into action:
Joyce Kobayashi (former member
of the Council of Presidents of
Stanford University) will conduct
a workshop on the topic of
canvassing; there will also be one
for those who are interested in
organizing teach-ins; a series of
booths and tables will be set up to
provide information in terms of
books, pamphlets, etc.
Many organizations and groups
are helping to co-ordinate this
major event; many more have
endorsed it: KASA Committee;
Young Buddist Associates (YBA);
Jr. JACL; Stanford
Asian-American Student Alliance.
We urge everyone to attend this
convocation. As we see harmony
in crisis all around us it is
imperative that we understand
what is truly happening; how else
can we best be equipped to
translate our convictions into
action.

Furthermore, this war has some

significant and unique
ramifications for the
Asian-American. It is, after all, an
Asian war. Moreover, certain
aspects of this conflict have direct
bearing on our lives —e.g., the
sanctioning of Oriental
stereotypes. This is one reason for
holding an educational program
directed specially toward the
Asian community.
For the purpose of ameliorating
some of the tension—and
promoting understanding—there
will be an educational program
mainly for the Asian-American
community at the San Jose
Buddhist Church (640 North sth
St.) on May 30, 1970 (Memorial
Day). The general topic of the
program will be the Indochina
War with a special emphasis on
the Asian-American perspective.
After the registration at 12:00
p.m., the program will begin at
12:30. The theme for the event
will be: "Harmony in Crisis?"
First, there will be a panel
discussion that will feature such
prominent speakers Dr. Robert
Textor; he will speak on "An
Overview of U.S. Intervention in
Indochina."
From 4:00 o'clock on, as the
third part of our program, there
will be a series of implementation
workshops for those who are
inspired enough to translate some
of their concern into action:
Joyce Kobayashi (former member
of the Council of Presidents of
Stanford University) will conduct
a workshop on the topic of
canvassing; there will also be one
for those who are interested in
organizing teach-ins; a series of
booths and tables will be set up to
provide information in terms of
books, pamphlets, etc.
Many organizations and groups
are helping to co-ordinate this
major event; many more have
endorsed it: KASA Committee;
Young Buddist Associates (YBA);
Jr. JACL; Stanford
Asian-American Student Alliance.
We urge everyone to attend this
convocation. As we see harmony
in crisis all around us it is
imperative that we understand
what is truly happening; how else
can we best be equipped to
translate our convictions into
action.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing in reply to Buzz
Thompson's article, "Self
Sustaining Sponsors," which
appeared in the May 21 ARENA.
This article exemplifies the
reporting techniques and
misrepresentation so common to
that newspaper.
When Mr. Thompson first
called me for an interview, he said
he was doing an article for the
Daily, a statement which he never
bothered to correct.
Unsuspectingly, I started
answering questions. During the
interview, he took no notes, a
convenience which apparently
made it easy to misquote me later.
So much for poor technique.
As to the content of the article,
miswording and implication were
used to the point of completely
reversing the sense of my
statements. Mr. Thompson writes
of male applicants being asked if
they had strong feelings about any
issues in general. This phrasing
makes it easy for him to conclude
that "political convictions" were
foremost in our minds, as
interviewers.
Actually, as I told Mr.
Thompson, the question usually
took the form, "What is
intellectually exciting to you?" or
even "What sorts of books do you
enjoy reading?" The purpose was
to help weed out applicants with
entirely nebulous interests as

having too little to offer the
incoming freshmen.
On the question of women's
liberation, there was a fairly
unanimous feeling in our
interviewing group that many of
the problems among freshmen
girls stem from an inability to
relate honestly to a variety of
other girls. Many also seem to
have trouble becoming involved in
the university apart from their
own courses and social lives. A
sponsor's attitude toward
women's liberation, as a life style,
is relevant to both these problems.
Through these questions, we often
learned something of an
applicant's political beliefs, but
this was obviously of secondary
concern to their ability to relate

to next year's freshmen.
Mr. Thompson also mentioned
several other "political" questions
that were asked during the
interviews. One concerned
whether the applicant was in the
habit of identifying rock
throwers. In the context of the
interview, which was dealing with
alienation within the dorm, we
felt that this question was
pragmatically justified. (TTie
applicant had already indicated,
on his application, that he was

interested in conservative politics.)
As a freshman, unexposed to
past sponsor selection
controversies, I can say that
politics is not a criteria for
sponsor selection. As Mr.
Thompson himself stated,
conservatives, this year, seemed to
display little interest in many of
the grass root university roles such
as sponsoring. Before infering
shadowy motives from out of
context questions, he might do
well to take a good long look at
the applicants we had to choose
from.

reversing the sense of my
statements. Mr. Thompson writes
of male applicants being asked if
they had strong feelings about any
issues in general. This phrasing
makes it easy for him to conclude
that "political convictions" were
foremost in our minds, as
interviewers.
Actually, as I told Mr.
Thompson, the question usually
took the form, "What is
intellectually exciting to you?" or
even "What sorts of books do you
enjoy reading?" The purpose was
to help weed out applicants with
entirely nebulous interests as

having too little to offer the
incoming freshmen.
On the question of women's
liberation, there was a fairly
unanimous feeling in our
interviewing group that many of
the problems among freshmen
girls stem from an inability to
relate honestly to a variety of
other girls. Many also seem to
have trouble becoming involved in
the university apart from their
own courses and social lives. A
sponsor's attitude toward
women's liberation, as a life style,
is relevant to both these problems.
Through these questions, we often
learned something of an
applicant's political beliefs, but
this was obviously of secondary
concern to their ability to relate

to next year's freshmen.
Mr. Thompson also mentioned
several other "political" questions
that were asked during the
interviews. One concerned
whether the applicant was in the
habit of identifying rock
throwers. In the context of the
interview, which was dealing with
alienation within the dorm, we
felt that this question was
pragmatically justified. (TTie
applicant had already indicated,
on his application, that he was

interested in conservative politics.)
As a freshman, unexposed to
past sponsor selection
controversies, I can say that
politics is not a criteria for
sponsor selection. As Mr.
Thompson himself stated,
conservatives, this year, seemed to
display little interest in many of
the grass root university roles such
as sponsoring. Before infering
shadowy motives from out of
context questions, he might do
well to take a good long look at
the applicants we had to choose
from.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As the Vietnam War expands
into the jungles and rice fields of
Cambodia and Laos, concern
among the American public has
deeply intensified about the true
nature of our involvement in this
conflict. Questions are being
raised that must be answered if
this unending conflict is to be
allowed to continue; justifications
are needed fbr the suffering and
killing—both at home and abroad.
Furthermore, this war has some

significant and unique
ramifications for the
Asian-American. It is, after all, an
Asian war. Moreover, certain
aspects of this conflict have direct
bearing on our lives —e.g., the
sanctioning of Oriental
stereotypes. This is one reason for
holding an educational program
directed specially toward the
Asian community.
For the purpose of ameliorating
some of the tension—and
promoting understanding—there
will be an educational program
mainly for the Asian-American
community at the San Jose
Buddhist Church (640 North sth
St.) on May 30, 1970 (Memorial
Day). The general topic of the
program will be the Indochina
War with a special emphasis on
the Asian-American perspective.
After the registration at 12:00
p.m., the program will begin at
12:30. The theme for the event
will be: "Harmony in Crisis?"
First, there will be a panel
discussion that will feature such
prominent speakers Dr. Robert
Textor; he will speak on "An
Overview of U.S. Intervention in
Indochina."
From 4:00 o'clock on, as the
third part of our program, there
will be a series of implementation
workshops for those who are
inspired enough to translate some
of their concern into action:
Joyce Kobayashi (former member
of the Council of Presidents of
Stanford University) will conduct
a workshop on the topic of
canvassing; there will also be one
for those who are interested in
organizing teach-ins; a series of
booths and tables will be set up to
provide information in terms of
books, pamphlets, etc.
Many organizations and groups
are helping to co-ordinate this
major event; many more have
endorsed it: KASA Committee;
Young Buddist Associates (YBA);
Jr. JACL; Stanford
Asian-American Student Alliance.
We urge everyone to attend this
convocation. As we see harmony
in crisis all around us it is
imperative that we understand
what is truly happening; how else
can we best be equipped to
translate our convictions into
action.

Arena Errors
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing in reply to Buzz
Thompson's article, "Self
Sustaining Sponsors," which
appeared in the May 21 ARENA.
This article exemplifies the
reporting techniques and
misrepresentation so common to
that newspaper.
When Mr. Thompson first
called me for an interview, he said
he was doing an article for the
Daily, a statement which he never
bothered to correct.
Unsuspectingly, I started
answering questions. During the
interview, he took no notes, a
convenience which apparently
made it easy to misquote me later.
So much for poor technique.
As to the content of the article,
miswording and implication were
used to the point of completely
reversing the sense of my
statements. Mr. Thompson writes
of male applicants being asked if
they had strong feelings about any
issues in general. This phrasing
makes it easy for him to conclude
that "political convictions" were
foremost in our minds, as
interviewers.
