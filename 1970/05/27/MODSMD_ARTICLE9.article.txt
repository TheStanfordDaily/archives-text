So what's to say? A few odds
and ends maybe, before folding a
last pair of socks into a leather
suitcase and squashing it to close
the latches. Four years ago, I
placed those socks in a drawer in
Rinconada for one hour. I have
worn them continually
sinceâ€”they've been my lucky
socks.
Good only for this university, I
suppose. I shall take them off
immediately after the Frost
amphitheatre derelicts complete
their diploma-tic games. Barefoot
I came to Stanford, barefoot shall
I leave, my feet as awkward as
ever in the sunlight of the real
world, my shoes and my Scotch in
a torn paper bag.
Death at Dawn
"STANFORD, Calif. June 15
(AP)-Earl N. Selby evaporated
from this joke-torn campus early
this morning without so much as a
tearful good-bye. He was
twenty-two and largely ignorant.
"Witnesses to the crime report
that Selby collapsed in a
paroxysm of hysterical laughter,
then vanished as swiftly as a cloud
steamed by the midday sun. He
left no forwarding address."
darkness darkness darkness
darkness oh darkness darkness
darkness pathetic-nothing-to-do
darkness darkness oh despair of
darkness darkness
all-around-and-not-a-drop-to-drink
of darkness darkness

Milkshakes For Horace
Some fine news to report: my
friend Horace, my old tried and
true friend who has saved me so
often, did in fact lose fifteen
pounds, as I predicted he would.
Alas, precisely one and a half
weeks after this monumental feat,
he gained every ounce back.
We imagined Horace had gone
back to the old routine of
Maimonides and milkshakes, but
we were wrong. He was pregnant.
At least, that's what he has
written his draft board :
"The Chairman, Local Board
No. $$$:
"Dear Sir: you will imagine
that I am putting you on, but I
am dreadfully upset to report I
am no longer a fit specimen for
your induction sugar mill. You
see, I've been 'had' at Stanford,
and I am, albeit miracuously,
pregnant as any cow or moose, i

regret my inability to serve my
proud country as a marine or a
napalm bomb, for at least the
next four years, when I shall be
twenty-six and beyond
child-bearing."
Horace Visits Jail
"Another loony, Fred," said
the proud man at the draft board,
"classify him 'R,' aged sixteen and
"under not admitted unless
accompanied by parent or
gaurdian. Next!" But what a
horrible joke. . .
Don't you see? Horace
graduates a scholar, with great
distinction, and the government
(bang! right away) slaps him with
a Bible and tells him to preach
among the sinners, in jail, for a
while. "The pay is good and the
food is better than Wilbur's, that's
for sure," he writes. "But a
revolution wouldn't hurt," Horace
admits finally, his life ruined by a
nation of apathetes. How many
others will suffer with him?
The Outrage of Leaving
And this is the outrage of four
years spent together with friends
you hope never to leave, the pure
shame of no longer knowing what
will happen to them or yourself.
This is what drives me crazy and
insane beyond belief. But the
Lord is my shepherd. . .
Shall we plan to meet again,
shall we dare to meet again after

the passage of years and lives
spent apart and alone? Whatever
the 'morrow may bring, I shall not
want. . .
Yea, gaudeamus igitur, let us
therefore rejoice and be exceeding
outwardly glad, for we are young
and free at last, about to leave for
parts unknown and unexplored,
separately, each man off to his
own world, there where He waits
beside the still waters. . .
One Life Ended, Another Begun
In the evening marshlands by
the bay, the waters are quiet,
stirred only by the soft breeze
that holds the seagulls idle over
the tidal salt ponds. Far to the
west, the smooth ripples of a
cloud bank resting on the memory
hills glow orange, then pink, while
the sun fades diving for the sea,
leaving scarce an answer in the
valley of the shadow of. . .
Here the boy came years ago,
searching for direction in the
aimless rustling of the saw tail
grass as the sun rose gleaming,
burning the mudflats, searing the
dry-grass hillcoasts brown with
September's drought, four years
and loves and friends ago. Sunrise
and sunset, endless sunrise and
sunset, a life within a life,
finished.
