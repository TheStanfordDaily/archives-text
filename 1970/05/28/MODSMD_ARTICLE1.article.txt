# Police 'Spy' Opens Up
## 
### BILL EVERS FRANK MILLER 
A girl living in Wilbur Hall
yesterday revealed the details of
her brief involvement with
Stanford police and Santa Clara
County Sheriff deputies as an
undercover agent in the radical
movement.
According to the girl, James J.
Newberry, a Stanford policeman,
approached her and asked her to
report on radical caucus meetings

and other radical actions. For
three weeks, until yesterday, she
played along, coming in contact
with Santa Clara County Deputy
Sheriff Robert F. Schlice.
In a conversation with the
Daily yesterday afternoon,
Newberry denied any knowledge
of such activity. However, in a
meeting later in the afternoon,
Stanford Police Chief Thomas
Bell, after talking extensively with
Newberry, corroborated mo>t

points of the story told to the
Daily by the informant.
Bell said that Newberry was
acting on his own nnd that he
(Bell) discouraged this type of
activity. "We don't try to go oui
and get informants and we pay
nobody for it," Bell said.
Note: the informant's story is
the Daily's summary of her
explanation. Statements of
Newberry's position are based on
information we received through
Stanford Police Chief Thomas
Bell
The Stanford Police made
initial contact with their
informant through a routine
police investigation of a crime
committed on campus. The
person involved was a witness to
the presence of a suspect in the
case.
Asked To Report
According to the informant,
Newberry asked her to report to
the police on the Radical Caucus
meeting, Monday evening, May
18, in the Roble lounge.
He spoke with the informant
about the gravity of current
radical tactics, mentioning
Molotov cocktails, and offered the
informant help in finding a
summer job. The girl says he
stated the police department had
a special fund to provide steak
dinners for informants.
Newberry pointed out that
previous persons who provided
information about radicals were
"too straight" to fit in at the
radicals' events. He said that a
jroup of officers felt that she was
the perfect candidate to be a
police spy.
Newberry and Bell both deny
that there is any "steak fund" and
Newberry says that the summer

job offer is not related to
informing to the police. Newberry
says he told her of a friend who
needed a girl to work over the
summer. Newberry denies that he
initiated the request for
information. He said she offered
to help when they were talking
about the radicals.
In each of two meetings that
week, says the informant
Newberry alluded to the presence
of CIA agents on the Stanford
campus investigating Stanford
radicals.
CIA?
Newberry denies mentioning
CIA agents, University
administrators said they knew of
no agents actively working on this
campus.
The informant had been told
by Newberry that the May 18
Radical Caucus meeting would be
at White Plaza. At the time of the
meeting, Newberry drove by
White Plaza in his police car and
told her that the meeting was in
Roble.
After the night's "trashing", at
ROTC, the informant telephoned
the Stanford Police to report on
the Radical Caucus meeting. The
following day the informant was
given a day-or-night telephone
number to use when reporting
(327-5154).
Newberry told her not to call
the police station directly because
some policemen were not
trustworthy.
Newberry does remember
telling her that some Stanford
policemen were not to be trusted
with confidential information.
Bell said the telephone number is
the business number of the police
station.

DEPUTY WATCHES RALLYâ€” Sanla Clara Sheriff's Deputy Robert Schlice, with
blond hair and dark glasses, kept an eye out at yesterday's White Plaza speech by
William Runs tier. Schlice had earlier asked the "police informant" to attend the
rally and report to him. letter, to obtain information, he phoned her dormitory,
returning her earlier call.
Newberry (in his police
uniform) went to the informant's
room Tuesday, May 26, to talk to
her. He asked her to come to the
Stanford police station to meet a
new contact. Newberry
introduced her to Santa Clara
County Deputy Sheriff Robert F.
Schlice, Detective Division.
Bell said afterwards that
Newberry felt the information he
was trying to get from her had
ramifications beyond Stanford, so
Newberry thought it was
important to call in outside
officials.
Schlice talked about keeping
files on radicals and people who
go to student radical meetings. He
said he wanted the informant to
get definite information for the
files.
He said specifically that he
wanted the names and
identification of anybody new at
the meetings, specific things
people say, which people come to
the meetings but don't participate
in other radical activities, etc.
Map
He asked the informant to get
a map to the meeting place of an
off-campus radical conference. He
said that they (the police) wanted
to post people around the
conference so they could identify
the people coming and going.
He was very interested in how
the radicals work with the
teamsters and other labor unions.
He asked for information she
could supply about current
activities or summer plans. He said
they had already talked to the
teamsters.
Schlice talked in terms of a
long-range plan for infiltrating the
radicals and getting
information-much of it general.
He also indicated that he might
be able to get the informant a
part-time job over the summer
and talked about treating her and
her boyfriend to a night on the
town.
At one point during the
interview, Schlice explained to
Newberry the trouble the Sheriff's
Office had in getting information
that the Stanford Police

Department had in some kind of
files (see related story on page 1).
Schlice indicated that the files
were removed from the Stanford
Police Department and placed in
the office of Dan DeYoung,
director of Public Safety. Schlice
said the District Attorney and
other people put pressure on the
University to release the
information, which it finally did.
Further Uses
Schlice discussed with the
informant the eventual uses to
which her information would be
put. Much he said, would provide
background on what goes on at
Stanford.
Appropriate information
applying to other jurisdictions
would be passed along to other
members of the Legal
Enforcement Intelligence Unit, a
nation-wide organization of police
officers involved in police
intelligence work.
According to Santa Clara
Sergeant Don Tamm, the LEIU is
an unofficial group, analogous to
the International Association of
Chiefs of Police or to the
California Check Investigators
Agency.
Newberry dropped out of the
case at this point and Newberry
said that the informant should
only work through Schlice from
this point forward.
Schlice said that he would be
at the Kunstler rally yesterday
and asked her to cover it also and
tell him who was there. He was
there (see picture on page 1). She
called him in the morning (he was
not there) and left a message for
him to call her at 2:00 at a
dormitory room.
Schlice Calls
He called the informant at
1:50. She told Schlice that she
had seen him at the rally. He said
he had gotten slightly "burned"
there because some people there
whom he had booked at one time
recognized him.
TTie informant told him that
she might be able to get the map
to the radical conference that he
wanted. She said, "He was really,
really happy" when he heard this.
She asked for instructions to

deliver the map if she should get
it. He told her to place it in a
plain envelope, after wrapping it
in something so that no one could
see into the envelope.
She was to write Schlice's
name on it and give it to Stanford
policeman Richard Sanguinetti or
Newberry at the Stanford Police
Department.
When she asked if she should
try to attend the radical
conference, Schlice said only if
she thought she wouldn't get
"burned." He added that he
would station himself near the
conference meeting place. He said
that with his 600 millimeter
camera he could get pictures of
those attending, entering, and
leaving the meeting from Vi mile
away.
When told that a noted campus
radical had gone underground,
Schlice said he would check into
that.
Call Goodyear
Schlice then told the informant
to call Roger Goodyear of the
Palo Alto Police Department
about a summer job. He said
Goodyear did not know her name
but that he did know she's a
person working with Schlice on
intelligence.
When the Daily contacted
Schlice yesterday he would only
say that at approximately 2:15 he
was outside of the county,
although he admitted it would
have been possible for him to
make a phone call.
C.D. Marron, Santa Clara field
enforcement officer and Schlice's
superior, told the Daily that its
questioning was "entering into the
realm of investigation" and added,
"I don't think the investigation
we enter into should be a matter
of public record."
No Santa Clara Sheriff's
official has denied any of the
above report. The informant will
be interviewed live on KZSU
today at noon.
