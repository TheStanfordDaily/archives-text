## 
### BILL EVERS FRANK MILLER 
A girl living in Wilbur Hall
yesterday revealed the details of
her brief involvement with
Stanford police and Santa Clara
County Sheriff deputies as an
undercover agent in the radical
movement.
According to the girl, James J.
Newberry, a Stanford policeman,
approached her and asked her to
report on radical caucus meetings

and other radical actions. For
three weeks, until yesterday, she
played along, coming in contact
with Santa Clara County Deputy
Sheriff Robert F. Schlice.
In a conversation with the
Daily yesterday afternoon,
Newberry denied any knowledge
of such activity. However, in a
meeting later in the afternoon,
Stanford Police Chief Thomas
Bell, after talking extensively with
Newberry, corroborated mo>t

points of the story told to the
Daily by the informant.
Bell said that Newberry was
acting on his own nnd that he
(Bell) discouraged this type of
activity. "We don't try to go oui
and get informants and we pay
nobody for it," Bell said.
Note: the informant's story is
the Daily's summary of her
explanation. Statements of
Newberry's position are based on
information we received through
Stanford Police Chief Thomas
Bell
The Stanford Police made
initial contact with their
informant through a routine
police investigation of a crime
committed on campus. The
person involved was a witness to
the presence of a suspect in the
case.
Asked To Report
According to the informant,
Newberry asked her to report to
the police on the Radical Caucus
meeting, Monday evening, May
18, in the Roble lounge.
He spoke with the informant
about the gravity of current
radical tactics, mentioning
Molotov cocktails, and offered the
informant help in finding a
summer job. The girl says he
stated the police department had
a special fund to provide steak
dinners for informants.
Newberry pointed out that
previous persons who provided
information about radicals were
"too straight" to fit in at the
radicals' events. He said that a
jroup of officers felt that she was
the perfect candidate to be a
police spy.
Newberry and Bell both deny
that there is any "steak fund" and
Newberry says that the summer

job offer is not related to
informing to the police. Newberry
says he told her of a friend who
needed a girl to work over the
summer. Newberry denies that he
initiated the request for
information. He said she offered
to help when they were talking
about the radicals.
In each of two meetings that
week, says the informant
Newberry alluded to the presence
of CIA agents on the Stanford
campus investigating Stanford
radicals.
CIA?
Newberry denies mentioning
CIA agents, University
administrators said they knew of
no agents actively working on this
campus.
The informant had been told
by Newberry that the May 18
Radical Caucus meeting would be
at White Plaza. At the time of the
meeting, Newberry drove by
White Plaza in his police car and
told her that the meeting was in
Roble.
After the night's "trashing", at
ROTC, the informant telephoned
the Stanford Police to report on
the Radical Caucus meeting. The
following day the informant was
given a day-or-night telephone
number to use when reporting
(327-5154).
Newberry told her not to call
the police station directly because
some policemen were not
trustworthy.
Newberry does remember
telling her that some Stanford
policemen were not to be trusted
with confidential information.
Bell said the telephone number is
the business number of the police
station.
