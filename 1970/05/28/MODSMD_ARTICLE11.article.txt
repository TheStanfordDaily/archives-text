## U.S. Redeemed By Israel? 
### AjajJarrouge 
On June 11, 1967, Senator
Jacob Javits, often described as
the Israeli spokesman in America,
considered Israeli agression and
occupation of Arab lands as an act
which "redeemed not only the
United Nations, but also the
United States." If Israel can
redeem the U.S. and the United
Nations, then surely these
countries must have been in debt
to the state of Israel.
But the U.N. partitioned
Palestine and provided a political
basis for the creation and
establishment of the Israeli state,
and the U.S. has been helping the
Jewish state financially, politically
and militarily ever since its
establishment. What more did the
"Senator from Israel" want from
the United States and the United
Nations?
Perhaps it is irrelevant to ask
this question since American aid,
in any form, never satisfies Israel's
appetite. Rather what is at stake,
what price the United States must
pay for such aid, is a more
important question.
In the May 5, 1969, issue of the
Wall Street Journal, a high
Pentagon official was quoted as
saying: "We have national
interests of the highest
importance. . . to encourage and
strengthen the moderate Arab
states in order to weaken the
radical (Arab) potential and to
avoid polarization of power
relationships in whirh the U.S.
would have no firm friends in the
Middle East except Israel, while
the Soviet Union would gain
uncontested influence and
possibly control throughout the
Arab world." What America fears
seems to be what Israel desires:
polarization in the Middle East
that would guarantee Israel
unlimited support from the U.S.
At one time the whole Arab
world was America's friend. But
the U.S. policy, to the delight of
the Israelis, toward the Middle
East forced Nacser to ask the
Russians for military and financial

•lid. Later Iraq and Syria followed
suit. In 1954, relations between
the U.A.R. and the U.S. were on
such good terms that Israel found
it intolerable and sent its terrorists
to bomb the American missions
and library in Cairo. The terrorists
were caught and the incident was
known as the Lavon affair. (Lavon
was Israel's defense minister in
1954).
The U.S. recently lost another
friend to the radical camp, namely
Libya. Continued bombing of
Jordan has increased the
possibility of Hussein turning over
to the Russians, and the air strikes
deep into Egypt have increased
Nasser's dependency on the Soviet
Union. And, as if to di. redit the
U.S. completely in the Middle
East this week. Israel invaded
Lebanon, America's best friend
and ally in the Arab World which
has remained neutral in the
Arab-Israeli conflict. However, the
U.S. did join the Security Council
in unanimously demanding "the
immediate withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Lebanon." Israel
withdrew its forces 12 hours after
the U.N. demanded the pullout
and after the military objectives
had been reached.
Why worry, peace-loving little
Israel, as long as you have the
Javits, the Humphreys and the
Kennedys in the U.S. President
Kennedy told Israeli Premier
David Den (> urion: "I was elected
by the Jews of New York and 1
would like to do something for
the Jewish people." Humphrey
has just returned from a
"campaign" trip to Israel!? Even
all-out liberal doves such as Teddy
Kennedy and John Lindsay
become oddly militaristic where
Israel is concerned. Lindsay, for
instance, coos with the dove
chorus where the issue is Vietnam.
But campaigning for re-election in
New York he went so far as to
echo the rhetoric of George
Wallace. America, he said, must
"stand up" in defense of Israel.

The U.S. cannot afford another
mistake in the Middle East. A
mistake in Southeast Asia would
still leave some time for the
American people to voice their
opinion and thus force a change.
In the Middle East there is the
obvious danger of nuclear
confrontation, whose
consequences would leave no
chance for anybody to reconsider
a decision.
Logic undergoes a very strange
reversal where the Arab-Israeli
conflict is concerned.
Israel must be stopped.

Lebanon, America's best friend
and ally in the Arab World which
has remained neutral in the
Arab-Israeli conflict. However, the
U.S. did join the Security Council
in unanimously demanding "the
immediate withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Lebanon." Israel
withdrew its forces 12 hours after

Why worry, peace-loving little

Kennedy told Israeli Premier
David Den (> urion: "I was elected

would like to do something for

has just returned from a

Israel is concerned. Lindsay, for

"stand up" in defense of Israel.

The U.S. cannot afford another
mistake in the Middle East. A
mistake in Southeast Asia would
still leave some time for the
American people to voice their

In the Middle East there is the

confrontation, whose

On June 11, 1967, Senator
Jacob Javits, often described as
the Israeli spokesman in America,
considered Israeli agression and
occupation of Arab lands as an act
which "redeemed not only the
United Nations, but also the
United States." If Israel can
redeem the U.S. and the United
Nations, then surely these
countries must have been in debt
to the state of Israel.
But the U.N. partitioned
Palestine and provided a political
basis for the creation and
establishment of the Israeli state,
and the U.S. has been helping the
Jewish state financially, politically
and militarily ever since its
establishment. What more did the
"Senator from Israel" want from
the United States and the United
Nations?
Perhaps it is irrelevant to ask
this question since American aid,
in any form, never satisfies Israel's
appetite. Rather what is at stake,
what price the United States must
pay for such aid, is a more
important question.
In the May 5, 1969, issue of the
Wall Street Journal, a high
Pentagon official was quoted as
saying: "We have national
interests of the highest
importance. . . to encourage and
strengthen the moderate Arab
states in order to weaken the
radical (Arab) potential and to
avoid polarization of power
relationships in whirh the U.S.
would have no firm friends in the
Middle East except Israel, while
the Soviet Union would gain
uncontested influence and
possibly control throughout the
Arab world." What America fears
seems to be what Israel desires:
polarization in the Middle East
that would guarantee Israel
unlimited support from the U.S.
