change face today. —Paul and Evers.)

Executioners"; Liberation March 1960, reprinted
in Paul Goodman, ed., Seeds of Liberation. "A
fine sight they are too, the believers in
non-violence, saying they are neither executioners
nor victims. Very well then; if you're not victims
when the government which you've voted for,
when the army in which your . . . brothers are
serving without hesitation or remorse have
undertaken race murder, you are, without a
shadow of a doubt, executioners."
Rosa Luxemburg, The Russian Revolution and

confuse revolutionary consciousness with the
intellect-consciousness of the Leninist professional

Barrington Moore, The Social Origins <>!
Dictatorship and Democracy; "The assumption of
inertia, that cultural and social continuity do not
require explanation, obliterates the fact that both

have to be recreated anew in each generation,
often with great pain and suffering. To maintain
and transmit a value system, human beings are
punched, bullied, sent to jail, thrown into
concentration camps, cajoled, bribed, made into
heroes, encouraged to read newspapers, stood up
against a wall and shot, and sometimes even taught
sociology."
Peter Bachrach & Morton S. Baratz, ''Two
Faces of Power"; The (pluralist) model takes no
account of the fact that power may be, and oft n
is, exercised by confining the scope of
decision-making to relatively 'safe' issues . . . (The
pluralists) have begun by studying the issues rather
than the values and biases that are built into the
political system and that, for the student of
power, give real meaning to those issues which do
enter the political arena." American Political
Science Review (December 1962), reprinted in

Andre Glucksman, "Strategy and Revolution in
France 1968," New Left Review
(November-December 1968). "The revolution's
weapon against the authoritarian and hierarchical
State is the explosion of initiative at all levels. In a
society ripe for socialism, counter-power is created
by the multiplication of centers first of
contestation and then of decision which paralyse
the central State power."
Evgeni Zamyatin, We; A novel about rebellion
against an Orwellian state. "Tell me what is the
final integer, the one at the very top, the biggest of
all. But that's ridiculous! Since the number of
integers is infinite, how can you have a final

revolution? There is no final revolution.
