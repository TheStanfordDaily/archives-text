## Arena Vs. Sponsors 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Yesterday, in a letter to the
editor, Shawn Smith accused me
of twisting his quotes beyond
recognition and of other various
journalistic malpractices. I am
sorry that in an attempt to refute
my article, Shawn misrepresented
the facts.
I told Shawn that the
information was for the ARENA
(who would want to admit being a
Daily reporter anyway?) I did
take notes. And I did not
misquote him.
Shawn implied that I failed to
inform my readers that his two
questions' primary concern was
not political. I stated such very
plainly in my article. From
Shawn's letter I would gather that
he never read my article, or only
scanned through it.
Shawn, when I interviewed
him, failed to tell me three
additional questions asked of
applicants since printed in the
ARENA —all of which have
political overtones. In defense of
the one question out of the three
he did try to refute: Is it apolitical
to exclude someone who
identified rock-throwing radicals

(a practice that President Pitzer
once commended)?
What worries me most about
Shawn's letter—and what worries
me most about the radical
movement on the whole—is that
the charges were leveled against
me on a personal level. The article
libeled me more than it attempted
to refute my arguments.
Shawn, who has been a very
good friend of mine for over four
years, has seen me on several
occasions since the AREMA
article was released. Never did he
attempt to clear up any
misunderstandings; instead, he
prefered to air the false charges in
public. In addition, he chose also
to slander the ARENA with no
attempt to later prove his charge.
This university would be
infinitely better off if people
would talk directly and rationally
with each other—displaying, at the
same time, the commonest
courtesies.
I am willing to believe that
Shawn's charges were the result of
a misunderstanding on his part. I
hope it can be cleared up.
