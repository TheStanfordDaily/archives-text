# 'Bourgeois Slander'
## Criticism And Cuba 
### Returned Macheteros 
On the correct handling of
bourgeois criticism of
Revolutionary Cuba:
The bourgeois press, in its role
as mouthpiece of the ruling class
and purveyor of capitalist
ideology, has traditionally been
guilty of the worst slander toward
revolutionary and progressive
popular movements of all types;
yet nowhere has this campaign of
villification and obfuscation been
conducted with more
thoroughness or less scruples than
that directed against socialist
Cuba.
The viciousness of the
reactionaries' attack is accounted
for by their frustration at the
liberation of a people formerly so
tightly in the grip of American
imperialism and now so active in
supporting the heroic struggle of
the Vietnamese people; it is the
responsibility of all progressive
elements to combat this
viciousness in every way.
However, in the midst of the
ideological struggle, it is also
imperative to avoid the error of
bourgeois social, analysis, that
error being the neglect of the
particular historical stage of
development in which Cuba finds
herself. This particular stage,
socialist construction under the
dictatorship of the advanced
workers and peasants, is of course
a stage in which contradictions
persist in many areas—economic,
political, social, and cultural. The
important distinction to be made
is that these contradictions, unlike
those of capitalist society, are
non-antagonistic; the masses of
the people, following the
leadership of the revolutionary
party and the vanguard workers,
can struggle against these
contradictions in the correct
manner and thus overcome them.
Therefore, in attacking the
distortions of the bourgeois press,
every effort must be made to
adhere to objective reality rather
than to deny it with the assertion
that Cuba is exempt from
contradictions. For instance,
when the preposterous lie is
spread that "starvation" is
rampant in Cuba, the correct
reply is not that all problems of
production have been overcome,
but rather that the masses have

been mobilized in the struggle
against underdevelopment because
they are conscious of the
superiority of the socialist
relations of production, which
serve the interests of the people
rather than of the exploiting class.
Growing Production
It is the fact that in a socialist
society the relations of
production allow for the rational
and optimal development of the
productive forces to meet the
needs of the people, that
identifies the contradiction of
underdevelopment as
non-antagonistic. The various
weapons—ideological ones such as
moral incentives for workers, and
technical ones such as machinery
from fellow socialist
countries—used in the struggle to
overcome the contradictions on
the economic front must be
identified and explained; full
attention must be given to the

great battle of the ten million ton
sugar harvest, in which the Cuban
people are now close to victory.
Similarly, the charge that there
is no "freedom" or "democracy"
in Cuba must be met not with the
assertion that all elements, no
matter how reactionary and
counter-revolutionary, are allowed
to speak in public and are
represented in state policies;
rather it should be countered with
the explanation that in Cuba the
state, as the instrument of
oppression of one class by
another, is now exercising the
dictatorship of the people over
the former exploiting class and all
those who resist sociatist
transformation. "Democracy for
the people and dictatorship over
the reactionaries is the people's
democratic dictatorship."
