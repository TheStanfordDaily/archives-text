# Rational Dialogue & A University Assembly
## 
### Bob Grant 
Rational dialogue has been
ridiculed this spring as simply a
fruitless game played by those
who wish to prevent change in
university policy and practice.
There is some basis for this charge
when it refers to those who refuse
to consider serious problems until
violence forces them to realize the
intensity of feeling involved.
There is also some basis for this
charge when the words rational
dialogue are used to mean

supplication of those with
authority to act.
The people who ridicule
rational dialogue for these
deficiencies seem to have
concluded that their inability to
influence decisions can only be
corrected by making it too
expensive to ignore their views
through the threat and use of
confrontation or violence.
Self-interest politics, the game of
playing for your own goals
without care for other's rights or
needs or the cost to the
university, is increasingly the
character of decision making on
campus.
And there is some evidence
that confrontation politics will
achieve short run victories.
Decisions on internal judicial
mechanisms, classified research,
representation on the Board of
Trustees, and ROTC seemed to be
in part responses to the
confrontations on campus.
But the apparent success of
this type of tactic involves hidden
costs. Half a million dollars in
losses is real, but the effects are
only slowly realized. Popular
departments, like Speech and
Drama and Architecture, will be
cut back. Innovations in
education, like SWOPSI and the

Center for Innovation in
Education, will be harder to
maintain or initiate. Pay raises for
low income employees will be
delayed. And tuition costs will
rise, perhaps resulting in a cut
back of students from low income
families.
Mistrust
But perhaps most importantly,
the suspicion and distrust created
within the University will
entrench power politics as the
means of resolving problems.
No panacea for the
polarization of our campus is
available. A development of some
trust between groups would help,
but trust will not develop until
people feel they have a real
influence on decisions. The ASSU
Council of Presidents has a
proposal that may relieve some of
the frustration and feeling of
impotence that so many have. A
number of universities have
created a governing body that
represents all constituencies with
an interest in the school-students,
faculty, administration, staff,
alumni and nearby communities.
Such bodies deal with issues that
have broad implications for the
entire university, while more
specialized groups such as faculty
and student senates continue to

deal with problems relevant to
their specific constituency.
More Bureaucracy
There are a number of
problems with such an idea. It
might simply become another
bureaucratic cog, another
somewhat larger committee that
would be unable to respond as
rapidly as an administration
sensitive to the needs of all the
different groups.
But the advantages to be
gained from such a body may be
worth the risk of wasted effort.
We just might be able to begin a
communication between groups
who now only write angry letters
to the president or smash
windows. It may even make it
possible to deal with divisive
issues before they reach the stage
of violence.
If any of you who have read
this feel the same way, please
contact the ASSU Council of
Presidents. The present methods
of decision-making are simply not
working well. A University
Assembly may not be the answer,
but I believe it offers far more
hope than simply continuing in
our present pattern.

expensive to ignore their views
through the threat and use of
confrontation or violence.
Self-interest politics, the game of
playing for your own goals
without care for other's rights or
needs or the cost to the
university, is increasingly the
character of decision making on
campus.
And there is some evidence
that confrontation politics will
achieve short run victories.
Decisions on internal judicial
mechanisms, classified research,
representation on the Board of
Trustees, and ROTC seemed to be
in part responses to the
confrontations on campus.
But the apparent success of
this type of tactic involves hidden
costs. Half a million dollars in
losses is real, but the effects are
only slowly realized. Popular
departments, like Speech and
Drama and Architecture, will be
cut back. Innovations in
education, like SWOPSI and the

Center for Innovation in
Education, will be harder to
maintain or initiate. Pay raises for
low income employees will be
delayed. And tuition costs will
rise, perhaps resulting in a cut
back of students from low income
families.
Mistrust
But perhaps most importantly,
the suspicion and distrust created
within the University will
entrench power politics as the
means of resolving problems.
No panacea for the
polarization of our campus is
available. A development of some
trust between groups would help,
but trust will not develop until
people feel they have a real
influence on decisions. The ASSU
Council of Presidents has a
proposal that may relieve some of
the frustration and feeling of
impotence that so many have. A
number of universities have
created a governing body that
represents all constituencies with
an interest in the school-students,
faculty, administration, staff,
alumni and nearby communities.
Such bodies deal with issues that
have broad implications for the
entire university, while more
specialized groups such as faculty
and student senates continue to

deal with problems relevant to
their specific constituency.
More Bureaucracy
There are a number of
problems with such an idea. It
might simply become another
bureaucratic cog, another
somewhat larger committee that
would be unable to respond as
rapidly as an administration
sensitive to the needs of all the
different groups.
But the advantages to be
gained from such a body may be
worth the risk of wasted effort.
We just might be able to begin a
communication between groups
who now only write angry letters
to the president or smash
windows. It may even make it
possible to deal with divisive
issues before they reach the stage
of violence.
If any of you who have read
this feel the same way, please
contact the ASSU Council of
Presidents. The present methods
of decision-making are simply not
working well. A University
Assembly may not be the answer,
but I believe it offers far more
hope than simply continuing in
our present pattern.

Rational dialogue has been
ridiculed this spring as simply a
fruitless game played by those
who wish to prevent change in
university policy and practice.
There is some basis for this charge
when it refers to those who refuse
to consider serious problems until
violence forces them to realize the
intensity of feeling involved.
There is also some basis for this
charge when the words rational
dialogue are used to mean

supplication of those with
authority to act.
The people who ridicule
rational dialogue for these
deficiencies seem to have
concluded that their inability to
influence decisions can only be
corrected by making it too
expensive to ignore their views
through the threat and use of
confrontation or violence.
