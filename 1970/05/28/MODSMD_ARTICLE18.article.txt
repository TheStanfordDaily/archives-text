# Make The Sun Shine In
## 
### Jesse Cedarbaum 
The end has finally come.
Exams are approaching, the strike
is over, and trashing and other
forms of political activism are
giving way to the "business as
usual" of the end of a quarter and
another academic year. Before
long, the insanity of Off-ROTC,
Cambodia and Academic Freedom
will fade into the realm of surreal
memory along with all the other
days of future past.
But what have the events of the
spring of 1970 taught us? What
have these most recent scenes
enacted on Shakespeare's
world-stage added to the plot of
that ongoing play that we call
"history?"
We have been shown, most
graphically, that what is wrong
with our nation and our world is
not merely the Vietnam War, not
merely isolated instances of
racism, not merely a growing
tendency towards repression and
obliviousness to the masses on
the part of those in power. But all
these things are interconnected,
related on a much deeper level
than most people had ever
suspected.
Not to say that this is just a

recent development. There are
those who have been trying to tell
the world all along that what we
are living through is really a
deep-rooted corruption of all that
mankind has been ostensibly
striving for throughout the
eternity of his existence. As Clard
Slinss so eloquently stated in the
rousing finale of Hair:
"We starve, look at one
another short of breath,
Walking proudly in our winter
coats,
Wearing smells from
la boratories,
Facing a dying nation —
A moving paper fantasy,
Listening for the new-told lies,
With supreme visions of lonely
tunes..."
And the cast replies with the
fervent plea "LET THE
SUNSHINE IN!"
Good Old Sunrise
But the dawning of the Age of
Aquarius has not been witness to
any glorious sunrise. The heavens
are clouded over with the
pollution of man's hate,
recklessness and indifference
towards both himself and that

flimsy planetary lifeboat he calls
mother Earth. No plea, no matter
how sincere, can bring about any
change in the nightmare
conditioning of our lives.
For who is there for us to
address our supplications to? The
obtuse, insensitive powers-that-be,
the Nixons and Agnews and
Hewlett-Packards? Some nebulous
God who is dead or at very best
off debauching in some far-distant
corner of the Universe?
We are most certainly kidding
ourselves if for even one instant
we let ourselves believe that the
sound of mere words or melodies
will get us anywhere in our
struggle. We must make that sun
shine in.
But what we must remember is
that our assault on those who
consider us to be their enemies
cannot be made on only one
front. Each of us has his own
scenario of what he can do to
make what must happen come
down at last, and what we must
remember is to forget our tactical
differences in order to achieve our
common goal.
The most immediate and
pressing foe is not that great

Silent Majority but their
demigods, the Deaf-and-Dumb
Minority people, like the Nixon
lackey who wrote to the little
fourth-grade girl telling her to
mind her own business and let the
President take care of the country
his own way; Senator Carl Curtiss
of Nebraska, who wrote in a reply
to a student's letter on the War,
that it is not Congress'
responsibility to place restraints
upon the President; and our own
President Pitzer, who urged that
faculty members wear their caps

and gowns on Graduation Day
because the tradition of academic
regalia transcends all moments of
crisis.
Where will you be, Dr. P., when
it all starts coming down?
Watching the fighting at the
barricades from your crumbling
Ivory Tower, sweating in that
black robe and sanguine hood,
grinding your useless test tubes on
your decaying mortarboard? Or
will you and your cronies be out
there with us, fighting for the
apolitical truth you always profess

that the University is trying to
ascertain?
Certain graffiti artists thought
they were being very clever when
they scrawled the Dylan line
"Don't stand in the doorway,
don't block up the hall," on the
boarded up doors of Encina. Too
bad they didn't bother to finish
the quote, "For he who gets hurt
will be he who has stalled,/ The
order is rapidly changing."
Don't Ask Anymore
But to change that order, as
Dan Siegel, Berkeley student body
president said, "We must move
from an era of peaceful protest
and morality to a period of
political struggle and
resistance . . . We're not gonna ask
and pray any more."
Experience has shown us that
we can't. Peaceful, and, in the
words of one Administration
official, non-disruptive and even
educational protests have been
terminated violently by the
asinine insensitivity of University
officials, some of whom have
admitted in SJC hearings that
they had little evidence that the
sit-ins were indeed disruptive

activities.
Brothers and sisters on other
campuses, black and white, have
been gunned down in cold blood.
And the nation has forgotten, and
they're hoping that the student-;
will forget also so that next fall,
Stanford and all the other
campuses across the country, can
return to their sleepy academic
"business as usual," and that this
spring will show itself to have
been just a put-on, a temper
tantrum of bored and
directionless youth.
It is now up to the students
themselves to prove that the
events of spring, 1970, were not
just a put on, to get it all together
and make that myth of "student
power" a reality.
Yesterday in White Plaza,
William Kunstler said, "If we can
stay together, perhaps ... we will
get a chance to start a world
where our lives will be more
meaningful than just eating and
shitting and dying."
If we can do that, we will have
made the sun shine in.

these things are interconnected,
related on a much deeper level
than most people had ever
suspected.
Not to say that this is just a

recent development. There are
those who have been trying to tell
the world all along that what we
are living through is really a
deep-rooted corruption of all that
mankind has been ostensibly
striving for throughout the
eternity of his existence. As Clard
Slinss so eloquently stated in the
rousing finale of Hair:
"We starve, look at one
another short of breath,
Walking proudly in our winter
coats,
Wearing smells from
la boratories,
Facing a dying nation —
A moving paper fantasy,
Listening for the new-told lies,
With supreme visions of lonely
tunes..."
And the cast replies with the
fervent plea "LET THE
SUNSHINE IN!"
Good Old Sunrise
But the dawning of the Age of
Aquarius has not been witness to
any glorious sunrise. The heavens
are clouded over with the
pollution of man's hate,
recklessness and indifference
towards both himself and that

flimsy planetary lifeboat he calls
mother Earth. No plea, no matter
how sincere, can bring about any
change in the nightmare
conditioning of our lives.
For who is there for us to
address our supplications to? The
obtuse, insensitive powers-that-be,
the Nixons and Agnews and
Hewlett-Packards? Some nebulous
God who is dead or at very best
off debauching in some far-distant
corner of the Universe?
We are most certainly kidding
ourselves if for even one instant
we let ourselves believe that the
sound of mere words or melodies
will get us anywhere in our
struggle. We must make that sun
shine in.
But what we must remember is
that our assault on those who
consider us to be their enemies
cannot be made on only one
front. Each of us has his own
scenario of what he can do to
make what must happen come
down at last, and what we must
remember is to forget our tactical
differences in order to achieve our
common goal.
The most immediate and
pressing foe is not that great

Silent Majority but their
demigods, the Deaf-and-Dumb
Minority people, like the Nixon
lackey who wrote to the little
fourth-grade girl telling her to
mind her own business and let the
President take care of the country
his own way; Senator Carl Curtiss
of Nebraska, who wrote in a reply
to a student's letter on the War,
that it is not Congress'
responsibility to place restraints
upon the President; and our own
President Pitzer, who urged that
faculty members wear their caps

and gowns on Graduation Day
because the tradition of academic
regalia transcends all moments of
crisis.
Where will you be, Dr. P., when
it all starts coming down?
Watching the fighting at the
barricades from your crumbling
Ivory Tower, sweating in that
black robe and sanguine hood,
grinding your useless test tubes on
your decaying mortarboard? Or
will you and your cronies be out
there with us, fighting for the
apolitical truth you always profess

that the University is trying to
ascertain?
Certain graffiti artists thought
they were being very clever when
they scrawled the Dylan line
"Don't stand in the doorway,
don't block up the hall," on the
boarded up doors of Encina. Too
bad they didn't bother to finish
the quote, "For he who gets hurt
will be he who has stalled,/ The
order is rapidly changing."
Don't Ask Anymore
But to change that order, as
Dan Siegel, Berkeley student body
president said, "We must move
from an era of peaceful protest
and morality to a period of
political struggle and
resistance . . . We're not gonna ask
and pray any more."
Experience has shown us that
we can't. Peaceful, and, in the
words of one Administration
official, non-disruptive and even
educational protests have been
terminated violently by the
asinine insensitivity of University
officials, some of whom have
admitted in SJC hearings that
they had little evidence that the
sit-ins were indeed disruptive

activities.
Brothers and sisters on other
campuses, black and white, have
been gunned down in cold blood.
And the nation has forgotten, and
they're hoping that the student-;
will forget also so that next fall,
Stanford and all the other
campuses across the country, can
return to their sleepy academic
"business as usual," and that this
spring will show itself to have
been just a put-on, a temper
tantrum of bored and
directionless youth.
It is now up to the students
themselves to prove that the
events of spring, 1970, were not
just a put on, to get it all together
and make that myth of "student
power" a reality.
Yesterday in White Plaza,
William Kunstler said, "If we can
stay together, perhaps ... we will
get a chance to start a world
where our lives will be more
meaningful than just eating and
shitting and dying."
If we can do that, we will have
made the sun shine in.
(Jesse Cedar bciu m was a
Martian CIA af>ent sent to observe

The end has finally come.
Exams are approaching, the strike
is over, and trashing and other
forms of political activism are
giving way to the "business as
usual" of the end of a quarter and
another academic year. Before
long, the insanity of Off-ROTC,
Cambodia and Academic Freedom
will fade into the realm of surreal
memory along with all the other
days of future past.
But what have the events of the
spring of 1970 taught us? What
have these most recent scenes
enacted on Shakespeare's
world-stage added to the plot of
that ongoing play that we call
"history?"
We have been shown, most
graphically, that what is wrong
with our nation and our world is
not merely the Vietnam War, not
merely isolated instances of
racism, not merely a growing
tendency towards repression and
obliviousness to the masses on
the part of those in power. But all
these things are interconnected,
related on a much deeper level

any glorious sunrise. The heavens
are clouded over with the
pollution of man's hate,
recklessness and indifference
towards both himself and that

flimsy planetary lifeboat he calls
mother Earth. No plea, no matter
how sincere, can bring about any
change in the nightmare
conditioning of our lives.
For who is there for us to
address our supplications to? The
obtuse, insensitive powers-that-be,
the Nixons and Agnews and
Hewlett-Packards? Some nebulous
God who is dead or at very best
off debauching in some far-distant
corner of the Universe?
We are most certainly kidding
ourselves if for even one instant
we let ourselves believe that the
sound of mere words or melodies
will get us anywhere in our
struggle. We must make that sun
shine in.
But what we must remember is
that our assault on those who
consider us to be their enemies
cannot be made on only one
front. Each of us has his own
scenario of what he can do to
make what must happen come
down at last, and what we must
remember is to forget our tactical
differences in order to achieve our
common goal.
The most immediate and
pressing foe is not that great

Silent Majority but their
demigods, the Deaf-and-Dumb
Minority people, like the Nixon
lackey who wrote to the little
fourth-grade girl telling her to
mind her own business and let the
President take care of the country
his own way; Senator Carl Curtiss
of Nebraska, who wrote in a reply
to a student's letter on the War,
that it is not Congress'
responsibility to place restraints
upon the President; and our own
President Pitzer, who urged that
faculty members wear their caps

and gowns on Graduation Day
because the tradition of academic
regalia transcends all moments of
crisis.
Where will you be, Dr. P., when
it all starts coming down?
Watching the fighting at the
barricades from your crumbling
Ivory Tower, sweating in that
black robe and sanguine hood,
grinding your useless test tubes on
your decaying mortarboard? Or
will you and your cronies be out
there with us, fighting for the
apolitical truth you always profess

that the University is trying to
ascertain?
Certain graffiti artists thought
they were being very clever when
they scrawled the Dylan line
"Don't stand in the doorway,
don't block up the hall," on the
boarded up doors of Encina. Too
bad they didn't bother to finish
the quote, "For he who gets hurt
will be he who has stalled,/ The
order is rapidly changing."
Don't Ask Anymore
But to change that order, as
Dan Siegel, Berkeley student body
president said, "We must move
from an era of peaceful protest
and morality to a period of
political struggle and
resistance . . . We're not gonna ask
and pray any more."
Experience has shown us that
we can't. Peaceful, and, in the
words of one Administration
official, non-disruptive and even
educational protests have been
terminated violently by the
asinine insensitivity of University
officials, some of whom have
admitted in SJC hearings that
they had little evidence that the
sit-ins were indeed disruptive

activities.
Brothers and sisters on other
campuses, black and white, have
been gunned down in cold blood.
And the nation has forgotten, and
they're hoping that the student-;
will forget also so that next fall,
Stanford and all the other
campuses across the country, can
return to their sleepy academic
"business as usual," and that this
spring will show itself to have
been just a put-on, a temper
tantrum of bored and
directionless youth.
It is now up to the students
themselves to prove that the
events of spring, 1970, were not
just a put on, to get it all together
and make that myth of "student
power" a reality.
Yesterday in White Plaza,
William Kunstler said, "If we can
stay together, perhaps ... we will
get a chance to start a world
where our lives will be more
meaningful than just eating and
shitting and dying."
If we can do that, we will have
made the sun shine in.
(Jesse Cedar bciu m was a
Martian CIA af>ent sent to observe
and incite recent events on Earth.)
The end has finally come.
Exams are approaching, the strike
is over, and trashing and other
forms of political activism are
giving way to the "business as
usual" of the end of a quarter and
another academic year. Before
long, the insanity of Off-ROTC,
Cambodia and Academic Freedom
will fade into the realm of surreal
memory along with all the other
days of future past.
But what have the events of the
spring of 1970 taught us? What
have these most recent scenes
enacted on Shakespeare's
world-stage added to the plot of
that ongoing play that we call
"history?"
We have been shown, most
graphically, that what is wrong
with our nation and our world is
not merely the Vietnam War, not
merely isolated instances of
racism, not merely a growing
tendency towards repression and
obliviousness to the masses on
the part of those in power. But all
these things are interconnected,
related on a much deeper level
than most people had ever
suspected.
Not to say that this is just a

recent development. There are
those who have been trying to tell
the world all along that what we
are living through is really a
deep-rooted corruption of all that
mankind has been ostensibly
striving for throughout the
eternity of his existence. As Clard
Slinss so eloquently stated in the
rousing finale of Hair:
"We starve, look at one
another short of breath,
Walking proudly in our winter
coats,
Wearing smells from
la boratories,
Facing a dying nation —
A moving paper fantasy,
Listening for the new-told lies,
With supreme visions of lonely
tunes..."
And the cast replies with the
fervent plea "LET THE
SUNSHINE IN!"
