## Tumultuous Year Ending 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
The universities, as forums for violent and
non-violent dissent in America, find themselves
weakened and stumbling as they enter the decade
of the 1970'5. Their buildings are attacked,
forcibly shut, often destroyed. Students have
sustained and intensified their attacks of the last
decade on nationalistic institutions within the
universities; and as recently as this month have
attempted to seize the University and use it as a
political tool in society.
Still, most University trustees, administrators
and faculty have insisted upon maintaining the
traditional American ideal of the University as an
apolitical collection of scholars and gentlemen.
As a result the non-politicians have found
their institutions woefully unprepared to deal
with forceful political challenges made by brash,
"ungentlemanly " members of their community.
With judicial mechanisms based on honor codes
and the like, universities have proven especially
vulnerable.
As a result, this spring college after college has
been forced to shut its doors or radically alter its
academic calendar. The second annual student
spring offensive against nationalism in the
Universities has ripped a gash in America's soft
underbelly of academia. In fact, last year's
disorders appear mild when analyzed in this
year's perspective.
What has caused the greater vehemence of this
year's protests? The most important factor is
obviously President Nixon's order to invade
Cambodia. The President's hard-line, cold-warish
speech to the nation on May 3 united students in
nationwide protest.
For the first time since the protest movement
grew out of the teach-in stage, students were
faced with what they saw as the blatant widening
of the war in Indochina, and they reacted.
But Cambodia was not the only cause of this
year's intensified student protests. The rest of the
answer lay on the campuses. The Student
movement in 1970 was not what it was in 1969,
either here or anywhere else in the nation.
To better understand the implications that
change has for Universities in general and
Stanford in particular, I have tried to analyze
three major topics; 1 ) how did the student
movement change this year, 2) how was this
change reflected in events at Stanford, and 3)
how effectively did Stanford's administrative
leadership respond to the changes.
77*(* SI mien t Move me n1
Bombs in New York buildings and town
houses, tires in California banks, and broken
windows in Stanford buildings shrieked of the
change that has come over the most alienated
members of America's youth this year.
As one Stanford activist said this spring,
"What we have is a radical movement becoming a
revolutionary one." The history of radical
development during the past year reinforces this
analysis. Revolutionary rhetoric has become
more frequent and proto-revolutionary action
has largely replaced radical non-violent tactics.
Many of the new revolutionaries see sit-ins
and marches as the "old" tactics and small-scale
guerilla actions as the "new." The "New Left" is
retreating and a harder, ideologically-oriented
Left is gaining strength.
Many of what were last year's radicals have
discovered and internalized an authentic
revolutionary identity.
Because of these trends, 1970 appears to be a
period of transition for those students on the
farthest Left. Tom Hayden captured this sense in
his April speech here when he said, "The
'Conspiracy 7' trial was the attempt of the
dinosaurs of the 1950's to keep the 1960 s from
becoming the 1970'5." Burnings, bombings, and
"trashines" may have heralded Hayden's '70's.
But THE STUDENT MOVEMENT is not only
composed of radicals and revolutionaries. There
are also the liberals and liberal-radicals. In past
years these two groups were able to work
together fairly easily, but as radicals have become
revolutionaries, they have increasingly found
themselves more isolated. Small, "mobile.

militant actions" taken by 200-300 radicals have
partly replaced the mass movements staged last
spring by coalitions of liberals and radicals.
All of this does not mean, however, that mass,
non-violent movements are dead on campuses.
For while that prediction might have seemed
somewhat correct a month ago, the national
strike in protest over Cambodia changed thatâ€”at
least for a time.
What is significant is that mass actions are no
longer led by radicals. The leadership role has
been seized by the liberal-radicals. In fact, one of

the most significant trends of the last lew
months may be the new relationship that is
developing between these liberal-radicals and the
pro to-revolutionaries.
It seems that the activist student movement is
polarizing. While radicals have become
revolutionaries, the politics of most of their more
moderate allies have remained relatively stable.
At Stanford this polarization was especially
prominent during the Cambodia strike when
radicals set up the radical caucus as a leadership
structure parallel to the more moderate strike
coordinating committee.
What is called THE STUDENT MOVEMENT,
has split apart this year. It is difficult to see just
how this split will effect its functioning in the
luture. A partial answer, may be found,
however, in the dynamics of the past year's
activist politics at Stanford.
Clirmiivlv Of Emits
Two years ago THE SPRING ISSUE was the
campus judicial policy. Last year it revolved
around the question of war research at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI). And this year
it was ROTC.

vVhen Stanford's 12,000 students returned to
the campus' browned grass and dried-up lake this
last fall, few would have believed that officer's
training would emerge as a controversial issue.
The previous spring the faculty Senate had
denied "academic credit for participation in
programs of military training and education,"
and most thought that decision doomed ROTC
to a quick death.
For the first few months of the year, there
was hardly a mention of the cadets and
midshipmen that quietly continued their training
been established by Pitzer with the consent of
laculty Senate chairman Leonard Schilf to work
out, in Pitzer's words, "arrangements (for making
ROTC) an extracurricular activity."
and drills.
Instead, radicals argued over their factional,
ideological differences, and liberal and
liberal-radicals delved into preparations for
peace moratoria. Most campus issues were
submerged in preparations for October and
November 15. Radicals seemed intent on pushing
the land development issue, but they got little
attention.
It was a splendid fall for moderates. 5.000
marched in Palo Alto in October and 300,000
clogged the Polo Grounds in November.
Thousands canvassed and engaged in rational
dialogue in between Plunkett-studed Saturdays.
But December arrived, the Moratorium died and
the radicals split.
Then came Winter Quarter and Pitzer's
announcement at a January Academic Council
meeting that a new contract providing for limited
ROTC credit had been negotiated with the
Army. Few noticed. The Daily story that
reported the speech briefly mentioned the
statement in the last paragraph. A few week's
later, however, after Pitzer's strong formal
recommendation that the Army limited credit
plan be accepted by the Senate, bewildered
students and faculty began to ask what had
happened.
With the release of the minutes qf private
meetings of The President's Advisory Committeei
on ROTC the details of what seemed to be a
puzzling reversal of the Senate's 1969 non-credit
decision began to unravel.
The Presidential Advisory Commitk*e
At the May Trustees meeting, however the
Board strongly urged reconsideration of the
Senate decision. By June when Pitzer wrote his
instructions to the Advisory Committee his
position had changed. He asked them to work for
renegotiating ROTC contracts "consistent with
the spirit of the Senate actions . . . with due
consideration also of the student and Trustee
view points as expressed by their respective
resolutions." Those referendams had asked that
ROTC receive limited credit.
The importance of this addition is apparent in
the minutes of the first meeting of the advisory
committee which decided that despite the March
agreement between Schiff and Pitzer that only
administrative matters remained, "nothing in the
charge to the Committee (from Pitzer) prevents
it from considering and rendering advice on any
question it deems appropriate."
During the late spring and summer Vice
Provost Howard Brooke negotiated the new
contract with the Army that provided for limited
credit. Some have questioned whether Brooks
should have been given this job since he had
authored the Minority ROTC Report asking for
limited ROTC credit, and that report had been
expressly rejected by the Senate in its February,
1969 "no credit" decision.
But the contract was negotiated, and in the
Fall submitted to the Advisory Committee for
approval. In early January that approval was
given Many have challenged the validity of that

committee's decision, however, since five of its
eight members entered their posts with the
preconception that officer's training deserved
some credit. Further challenges to the
committeeee's makeup arose because two of the
three student members chosen were ROTC
cadets.
Still, Pitzer accepted their recommendation
and late in Jan "strongly" urged the Senate to
adopt it. A few weeks later it did 23-13 and the
controversy began.
Through the rest of Winter quarter radicals

tried to gain support for opposing ROTC on
campus; but most students scorned apathetic, and
most protest action for the rest of that quarter
was limited to 100 to 200 people interrupting
ROTC classes and drills.
The spring recess came before a faculty mail
ballot challenge to the Senate's decision could be
made.
The mail ballot finally came in on March 30,
and the President and the Senate were upheld by
a narrow-vote margin. That only served to set the
stage for Tom Hayden's speech the next night
and a long spring quarter to come.
It was late on the evening of March 31 that
students gathered after the Hayden speech
decided to march on the Athletic-ROTC building
and "board it up." When they got there a few
windows were broken and moments later the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies were upon
them. The group of 300-400 radicals retreated
and marched around campus breaking windows.
What followed was a chronicle of protest
action too detailed to recount here. There were
two more nights of "trashing" before the
protesters, still predominaitly radicals, turned to
daylight mill-ins at the Athletic building.
Sometime during these few weeks liberal-radical

elements joined with radical forces determined to
create a mass movement and gradually seized
power from the radicals favoring more "mass
militant night-time action."
The result was two sit-ins and two mass police
arrests. It was the second sit-in that was most
significant. It began at 9 a.m. on April 29. By
3:00 there were only about 200 people in the
Old Union and they were asking each other why
the sit-in had failed. Then came the first rumors
of some kind of imminent involvement in
Cambodia.
The police warned the demonstrators they
were trespassing and went for reinforcements. In
the 2-3 hours before deputies arrived, the crowd
grew steadily until its 1200 persons filled the Old
Union Courtyard and spilled out around it. The
police came. Rocks crashed into their windows
and a full-scale riot broke out. The next night
was even more violent, but by Friday evening
only a few hundred protesters participated, and a
few dozen windows were broken.
On Sunday, May 4 the student strike began.
With faculty support buildings were shut and
classes brought near a standstill. Leadership of
the strike shifted to the liberal-radical group and
at this time the revolutionaries found it necessary
to form a parallel organization, the radical
caucus.
Then came the big surprise. President Pitzer
asked the faculty Senate to reconsider the entire
issue of ROTC. A week later that faculty body
reversed itself for the second time within a little
over a year, ended all ROTC credit and narrowly
decided to delay consideration of whether
officer's training should be on campus. Since that
decision the campus has been relatively calm.
lion- lias I'itzpr Dom* ?
Inherent in any analysis of the events of the
ROTC crisis is the question of why Pitzer acted
the way he did when he did. It is difficult to find
any logic running through the 16 months since
the first Senate decision.
Publicly, the President has consistently
maintained that his limited credit
recommendations were "very close indeed to
recommendations by the Senate on February 13,
1969 (the no-credit recommendations). But
other statements made by Pitzer in the past 16
months cloud this rationale.
In March of last year he talks as though all
credit issues have been decided and says that all
that remains to be worked out is administrative
details of what form of "extracurricular activity"
ROTC should be.
By May he is asking that his Advisory
Committee consider the Trustee and the student
referenda asking that some credit be retained for
officer's training, and in January he is
acknowledging that the new Army contract
represents a compromise with disgruntled
alumni, trustees, and other outside friends.
"This is one area in which all sorts of friends
of the University are concerned," he said at a
press conference. "So I thought that if it was
possible to compromise with these groups it was
best to do so."
Then, suddenly, in the midst of the
Cambodian crisis and rioting on campus, the
President reversed his position in asking for the
Senate to again reconsider its decision. In doing
this he knew full well that credit would be
denied ROTC and that it might be forced off
campus.
Why then did he do it? He justified the
reconsideration on the basis of Brook's
candidacy for an Air Force job, while
maintaining that his candidacy had no effect on
his negotiations. That seems illogical, however,
for he is saying: 1) Brooks' negotiations are not
tainted by the candidacy, 2) I want you to
reconsider the issue even though I know you will
reverse this justly arrived at contract, and 3) I
will make no recommendation that the limited
credit plan again be upheld.
It is more likely that Pitzer was acting this
month with only one goal in mindâ€”the
preservation of the University. The ROTC
protests thrust into the environment of the
Cambodian crisis threatened that and he felt he
had to compromise again.

But THE STUDENT MOVEMENT is not only
composed of radicals and revolutionaries. There
are also the liberals and liberal-radicals. In past
years these two groups were able to work
together fairly easily, but as radicals have become
revolutionaries, they have increasingly found
themselves more isolated. Small, "mobile.

militant actions" taken by 200-300 radicals have
partly replaced the mass movements staged last
spring by coalitions of liberals and radicals.
All of this does not mean, however, that mass,
non-violent movements are dead on campuses.
For while that prediction might have seemed
somewhat correct a month ago, the national
strike in protest over Cambodia changed thatâ€”at
least for a time.
What is significant is that mass actions are no
longer led by radicals. The leadership role has
been seized by the liberal-radicals. In fact, one of

the most significant trends of the last lew
months may be the new relationship that is
developing between these liberal-radicals and the
pro to-revolutionaries.
It seems that the activist student movement is
polarizing. While radicals have become
revolutionaries, the politics of most of their more
moderate allies have remained relatively stable.
At Stanford this polarization was especially
prominent during the Cambodia strike when
radicals set up the radical caucus as a leadership
structure parallel to the more moderate strike
coordinating committee.
What is called THE STUDENT MOVEMENT,
has split apart this year. It is difficult to see just
how this split will effect its functioning in the
luture. A partial answer, may be found,
however, in the dynamics of the past year's
activist politics at Stanford.
Clirmiivlv Of Emits
Two years ago THE SPRING ISSUE was the
campus judicial policy. Last year it revolved
around the question of war research at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI). And this year
it was ROTC.

vVhen Stanford's 12,000 students returned to
the campus' browned grass and dried-up lake this
last fall, few would have believed that officer's
training would emerge as a controversial issue.
The previous spring the faculty Senate had
denied "academic credit for participation in
programs of military training and education,"
and most thought that decision doomed ROTC
to a quick death.
For the first few months of the year, there
was hardly a mention of the cadets and
midshipmen that quietly continued their training
been established by Pitzer with the consent of
laculty Senate chairman Leonard Schilf to work
out, in Pitzer's words, "arrangements (for making
ROTC) an extracurricular activity."
and drills.
Instead, radicals argued over their factional,
ideological differences, and liberal and
liberal-radicals delved into preparations for
peace moratoria. Most campus issues were
submerged in preparations for October and
November 15. Radicals seemed intent on pushing
the land development issue, but they got little
attention.
It was a splendid fall for moderates. 5.000
marched in Palo Alto in October and 300,000
clogged the Polo Grounds in November.
Thousands canvassed and engaged in rational
dialogue in between Plunkett-studed Saturdays.
But December arrived, the Moratorium died and
the radicals split.
Then came Winter Quarter and Pitzer's
announcement at a January Academic Council
meeting that a new contract providing for limited
ROTC credit had been negotiated with the
Army. Few noticed. The Daily story that
reported the speech briefly mentioned the
statement in the last paragraph. A few week's
later, however, after Pitzer's strong formal
recommendation that the Army limited credit
plan be accepted by the Senate, bewildered
students and faculty began to ask what had
happened.
With the release of the minutes qf private
meetings of The President's Advisory Committeei
on ROTC the details of what seemed to be a
puzzling reversal of the Senate's 1969 non-credit
decision began to unravel.
The Presidential Advisory Commitk*e
At the May Trustees meeting, however the
Board strongly urged reconsideration of the
Senate decision. By June when Pitzer wrote his
instructions to the Advisory Committee his
position had changed. He asked them to work for
renegotiating ROTC contracts "consistent with
the spirit of the Senate actions . . . with due
consideration also of the student and Trustee
view points as expressed by their respective
resolutions." Those referendams had asked that
ROTC receive limited credit.
The importance of this addition is apparent in
the minutes of the first meeting of the advisory
committee which decided that despite the March
agreement between Schiff and Pitzer that only
administrative matters remained, "nothing in the
charge to the Committee (from Pitzer) prevents
it from considering and rendering advice on any
question it deems appropriate."
During the late spring and summer Vice
Provost Howard Brooke negotiated the new
contract with the Army that provided for limited
credit. Some have questioned whether Brooks
should have been given this job since he had
authored the Minority ROTC Report asking for
limited ROTC credit, and that report had been
expressly rejected by the Senate in its February,
1969 "no credit" decision.
But the contract was negotiated, and in the
Fall submitted to the Advisory Committee for
approval. In early January that approval was
given Many have challenged the validity of that

committee's decision, however, since five of its
eight members entered their posts with the
preconception that officer's training deserved
some credit. Further challenges to the
committeeee's makeup arose because two of the
three student members chosen were ROTC
cadets.
Still, Pitzer accepted their recommendation
and late in Jan "strongly" urged the Senate to
adopt it. A few weeks later it did 23-13 and the
controversy began.
Through the rest of Winter quarter radicals

tried to gain support for opposing ROTC on
campus; but most students scorned apathetic, and
most protest action for the rest of that quarter
was limited to 100 to 200 people interrupting
ROTC classes and drills.
The spring recess came before a faculty mail
ballot challenge to the Senate's decision could be
made.
The mail ballot finally came in on March 30,
and the President and the Senate were upheld by
a narrow-vote margin. That only served to set the
stage for Tom Hayden's speech the next night
and a long spring quarter to come.
It was late on the evening of March 31 that
students gathered after the Hayden speech
decided to march on the Athletic-ROTC building
and "board it up." When they got there a few
windows were broken and moments later the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies were upon
them. The group of 300-400 radicals retreated
and marched around campus breaking windows.
What followed was a chronicle of protest
action too detailed to recount here. There were
two more nights of "trashing" before the
protesters, still predominaitly radicals, turned to
daylight mill-ins at the Athletic building.
Sometime during these few weeks liberal-radical

elements joined with radical forces determined to
create a mass movement and gradually seized
power from the radicals favoring more "mass
militant night-time action."
The result was two sit-ins and two mass police
arrests. It was the second sit-in that was most
significant. It began at 9 a.m. on April 29. By
3:00 there were only about 200 people in the
Old Union and they were asking each other why
the sit-in had failed. Then came the first rumors
of some kind of imminent involvement in
Cambodia.
The police warned the demonstrators they
were trespassing and went for reinforcements. In
the 2-3 hours before deputies arrived, the crowd
grew steadily until its 1200 persons filled the Old
Union Courtyard and spilled out around it. The
police came. Rocks crashed into their windows
and a full-scale riot broke out. The next night
was even more violent, but by Friday evening
only a few hundred protesters participated, and a
few dozen windows were broken.
On Sunday, May 4 the student strike began.
With faculty support buildings were shut and
classes brought near a standstill. Leadership of
the strike shifted to the liberal-radical group and
at this time the revolutionaries found it necessary
to form a parallel organization, the radical
caucus.
Then came the big surprise. President Pitzer
asked the faculty Senate to reconsider the entire
issue of ROTC. A week later that faculty body
reversed itself for the second time within a little
over a year, ended all ROTC credit and narrowly
decided to delay consideration of whether
officer's training should be on campus. Since that
decision the campus has been relatively calm.
lion- lias I'itzpr Dom* ?
Inherent in any analysis of the events of the
ROTC crisis is the question of why Pitzer acted
the way he did when he did. It is difficult to find
any logic running through the 16 months since
the first Senate decision.
Publicly, the President has consistently
maintained that his limited credit
recommendations were "very close indeed to
recommendations by the Senate on February 13,
1969 (the no-credit recommendations). But
other statements made by Pitzer in the past 16
months cloud this rationale.
In March of last year he talks as though all
credit issues have been decided and says that all
that remains to be worked out is administrative
details of what form of "extracurricular activity"
ROTC should be.
By May he is asking that his Advisory
Committee consider the Trustee and the student
referenda asking that some credit be retained for
officer's training, and in January he is
acknowledging that the new Army contract
represents a compromise with disgruntled
alumni, trustees, and other outside friends.
"This is one area in which all sorts of friends
of the University are concerned," he said at a
press conference. "So I thought that if it was
possible to compromise with these groups it was
best to do so."
Then, suddenly, in the midst of the
Cambodian crisis and rioting on campus, the
President reversed his position in asking for the
Senate to again reconsider its decision. In doing
this he knew full well that credit would be
denied ROTC and that it might be forced off
campus.
Why then did he do it? He justified the
reconsideration on the basis of Brook's
candidacy for an Air Force job, while
maintaining that his candidacy had no effect on
his negotiations. That seems illogical, however,
for he is saying: 1) Brooks' negotiations are not
tainted by the candidacy, 2) I want you to
reconsider the issue even though I know you will
reverse this justly arrived at contract, and 3) I
will make no recommendation that the limited
credit plan again be upheld.
It is more likely that Pitzer was acting this
month with only one goal in mindâ€”the
preservation of the University. The ROTC
protests thrust into the environment of the
Cambodian crisis threatened that and he felt he
had to compromise again.

PRESIDENT PITZER
The universities, as forums for violent and
non-violent dissent in America, find themselves
weakened and stumbling as they enter the decade
of the 1970'5. Their buildings are attacked,
forcibly shut, often destroyed. Students have
sustained and intensified their attacks of the last
decade on nationalistic institutions within the
universities; and as recently as this month have
attempted to seize the University and use it as a
political tool in society.
Still, most University trustees, administrators
and faculty have insisted upon maintaining the
traditional American ideal of the University as an
apolitical collection of scholars and gentlemen.
As a result the non-politicians have found
their institutions woefully unprepared to deal
with forceful political challenges made by brash,
"ungentlemanly " members of their community.
With judicial mechanisms based on honor codes
and the like, universities have proven especially
vulnerable.
As a result, this spring college after college has
been forced to shut its doors or radically alter its
academic calendar. The second annual student
spring offensive against nationalism in the
Universities has ripped a gash in America's soft
underbelly of academia. In fact, last year's
disorders appear mild when analyzed in this
year's perspective.
What has caused the greater vehemence of this
year's protests? The most important factor is
obviously President Nixon's order to invade
Cambodia. The President's hard-line, cold-warish
speech to the nation on May 3 united students in
nationwide protest.
For the first time since the protest movement
grew out of the teach-in stage, students were
faced with what they saw as the blatant widening
of the war in Indochina, and they reacted.
But Cambodia was not the only cause of this
year's intensified student protests. The rest of the
answer lay on the campuses. The Student
movement in 1970 was not what it was in 1969,
either here or anywhere else in the nation.
To better understand the implications that
change has for Universities in general and
Stanford in particular, I have tried to analyze
three major topics; 1 ) how did the student
movement change this year, 2) how was this
change reflected in events at Stanford, and 3)
how effectively did Stanford's administrative
leadership respond to the changes.
77*(* SI mien t Move me n1
Bombs in New York buildings and town
houses, tires in California banks, and broken
windows in Stanford buildings shrieked of the
change that has come over the most alienated
members of America's youth this year.
As one Stanford activist said this spring,
"What we have is a radical movement becoming a
revolutionary one." The history of radical
development during the past year reinforces this
analysis. Revolutionary rhetoric has become
more frequent and proto-revolutionary action
has largely replaced radical non-violent tactics.
Many of the new revolutionaries see sit-ins
and marches as the "old" tactics and small-scale
guerilla actions as the "new." The "New Left" is
retreating and a harder, ideologically-oriented
Left is gaining strength.
Many of what were last year's radicals have
discovered and internalized an authentic
revolutionary identity.
Because of these trends, 1970 appears to be a
period of transition for those students on the
farthest Left. Tom Hayden captured this sense in
his April speech here when he said, "The
'Conspiracy 7' trial was the attempt of the
dinosaurs of the 1950's to keep the 1960 s from
becoming the 1970'5." Burnings, bombings, and
"trashines" may have heralded Hayden's '70's.
But THE STUDENT MOVEMENT is not only
composed of radicals and revolutionaries. There
are also the liberals and liberal-radicals. In past

plan be accepted by the Senate, bewildered
students and faculty began to ask what had
happened.
With the release of the minutes qf private
meetings of The President's Advisory Committeei
on ROTC the details of what seemed to be a
puzzling reversal of the Senate's 1969 non-credit
decision began to unravel.
The Presidential Advisory Commitk*e
At the May Trustees meeting, however the
Board strongly urged reconsideration of the
Senate decision. By June when Pitzer wrote his
instructions to the Advisory Committee his
position had changed. He asked them to work for
renegotiating ROTC contracts "consistent with
the spirit of the Senate actions . . . with due
consideration also of the student and Trustee
view points as expressed by their respective
resolutions." Those referendams had asked that
ROTC receive limited credit.
The importance of this addition is apparent in
the minutes of the first meeting of the advisory
committee which decided that despite the March
agreement between Schiff and Pitzer that only
administrative matters remained, "nothing in the
charge to the Committee (from Pitzer) prevents
it from considering and rendering advice on any
question it deems appropriate."
During the late spring and summer Vice
Provost Howard Brooke negotiated the new
contract with the Army that provided for limited
credit. Some have questioned whether Brooks
should have been given this job since he had
authored the Minority ROTC Report asking for
limited ROTC credit, and that report had been
expressly rejected by the Senate in its February,
1969 "no credit" decision.
But the contract was negotiated, and in the
Fall submitted to the Advisory Committee for
approval. In early January that approval was
given Many have challenged the validity of that

committee's decision, however, since five of its
eight members entered their posts with the
preconception that officer's training deserved
some credit. Further challenges to the
committeeee's makeup arose because two of the
three student members chosen were ROTC
cadets.
Still, Pitzer accepted their recommendation
and late in Jan "strongly" urged the Senate to
adopt it. A few weeks later it did 23-13 and the
controversy began.
Through the rest of Winter quarter radicals

tried to gain support for opposing ROTC on
campus; but most students scorned apathetic, and
most protest action for the rest of that quarter
was limited to 100 to 200 people interrupting
ROTC classes and drills.
The spring recess came before a faculty mail
ballot challenge to the Senate's decision could be
made.
The mail ballot finally came in on March 30,
and the President and the Senate were upheld by
a narrow-vote margin. That only served to set the
stage for Tom Hayden's speech the next night
and a long spring quarter to come.
It was late on the evening of March 31 that
students gathered after the Hayden speech
decided to march on the Athletic-ROTC building
and "board it up." When they got there a few
windows were broken and moments later the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies were upon
them. The group of 300-400 radicals retreated
and marched around campus breaking windows.
What followed was a chronicle of protest
action too detailed to recount here. There were
two more nights of "trashing" before the
protesters, still predominaitly radicals, turned to
daylight mill-ins at the Athletic building.
Sometime during these few weeks liberal-radical

elements joined with radical forces determined to
create a mass movement and gradually seized
power from the radicals favoring more "mass
militant night-time action."
The result was two sit-ins and two mass police
arrests. It was the second sit-in that was most
significant. It began at 9 a.m. on April 29. By
3:00 there were only about 200 people in the
Old Union and they were asking each other why
the sit-in had failed. Then came the first rumors
of some kind of imminent involvement in
Cambodia.
The police warned the demonstrators they
were trespassing and went for reinforcements. In
the 2-3 hours before deputies arrived, the crowd
grew steadily until its 1200 persons filled the Old
Union Courtyard and spilled out around it. The
police came. Rocks crashed into their windows
and a full-scale riot broke out. The next night
was even more violent, but by Friday evening
only a few hundred protesters participated, and a
few dozen windows were broken.
On Sunday, May 4 the student strike began.
With faculty support buildings were shut and
classes brought near a standstill. Leadership of
the strike shifted to the liberal-radical group and
at this time the revolutionaries found it necessary
to form a parallel organization, the radical
caucus.
Then came the big surprise. President Pitzer
asked the faculty Senate to reconsider the entire
issue of ROTC. A week later that faculty body
reversed itself for the second time within a little
over a year, ended all ROTC credit and narrowly
decided to delay consideration of whether
officer's training should be on campus. Since that
decision the campus has been relatively calm.
lion- lias I'itzpr Dom* ?
Inherent in any analysis of the events of the
ROTC crisis is the question of why Pitzer acted
the way he did when he did. It is difficult to find
any logic running through the 16 months since
the first Senate decision.
Publicly, the President has consistently
maintained that his limited credit
recommendations were "very close indeed to
recommendations by the Senate on February 13,
1969 (the no-credit recommendations). But
other statements made by Pitzer in the past 16
months cloud this rationale.
In March of last year he talks as though all
credit issues have been decided and says that all
that remains to be worked out is administrative
details of what form of "extracurricular activity"
ROTC should be.
By May he is asking that his Advisory
Committee consider the Trustee and the student
referenda asking that some credit be retained for
officer's training, and in January he is
acknowledging that the new Army contract
represents a compromise with disgruntled
alumni, trustees, and other outside friends.
"This is one area in which all sorts of friends
of the University are concerned," he said at a
press conference. "So I thought that if it was
possible to compromise with these groups it was
best to do so."
Then, suddenly, in the midst of the
Cambodian crisis and rioting on campus, the
President reversed his position in asking for the
Senate to again reconsider its decision. In doing
this he knew full well that credit would be
denied ROTC and that it might be forced off
campus.
Why then did he do it? He justified the
reconsideration on the basis of Brook's
candidacy for an Air Force job, while
maintaining that his candidacy had no effect on
his negotiations. That seems illogical, however,
for he is saying: 1) Brooks' negotiations are not
tainted by the candidacy, 2) I want you to
reconsider the issue even though I know you will
reverse this justly arrived at contract, and 3) I
will make no recommendation that the limited
credit plan again be upheld.
It is more likely that Pitzer was acting this
month with only one goal in mindâ€”the
preservation of the University. The ROTC
protests thrust into the environment of the
Cambodian crisis threatened that and he felt he
had to compromise again.

TOM HAYDEN


PRESIDENT PITZER
The universities, as forums for violent and
non-violent dissent in America, find themselves
weakened and stumbling as they enter the decade
of the 1970'5. Their buildings are attacked,
forcibly shut, often destroyed. Students have
sustained and intensified their attacks of the last
decade on nationalistic institutions within the
universities; and as recently as this month have
attempted to seize the University and use it as a
political tool in society.
Still, most University trustees, administrators
and faculty have insisted upon maintaining the
traditional American ideal of the University as an
apolitical collection of scholars and gentlemen.
As a result the non-politicians have found
their institutions woefully unprepared to deal
with forceful political challenges made by brash,
"ungentlemanly " members of their community.
With judicial mechanisms based on honor codes
and the like, universities have proven especially
vulnerable.
As a result, this spring college after college has
been forced to shut its doors or radically alter its
academic calendar. The second annual student
spring offensive against nationalism in the
Universities has ripped a gash in America's soft
underbelly of academia. In fact, last year's
disorders appear mild when analyzed in this
year's perspective.
What has caused the greater vehemence of this
year's protests? The most important factor is
obviously President Nixon's order to invade
Cambodia. The President's hard-line, cold-warish
speech to the nation on May 3 united students in
nationwide protest.
For the first time since the protest movement
grew out of the teach-in stage, students were
faced with what they saw as the blatant widening
of the war in Indochina, and they reacted.
But Cambodia was not the only cause of this
year's intensified student protests. The rest of the
answer lay on the campuses. The Student
movement in 1970 was not what it was in 1969,
either here or anywhere else in the nation.
To better understand the implications that
change has for Universities in general and
Stanford in particular, I have tried to analyze
three major topics; 1 ) how did the student
movement change this year, 2) how was this
change reflected in events at Stanford, and 3)
how effectively did Stanford's administrative
leadership respond to the changes.
77*(* SI mien t Move me n1
Bombs in New York buildings and town
houses, tires in California banks, and broken
windows in Stanford buildings shrieked of the
change that has come over the most alienated
members of America's youth this year.
As one Stanford activist said this spring,
"What we have is a radical movement becoming a
revolutionary one." The history of radical
development during the past year reinforces this
analysis. Revolutionary rhetoric has become
more frequent and proto-revolutionary action
has largely replaced radical non-violent tactics.
Many of the new revolutionaries see sit-ins
and marches as the "old" tactics and small-scale
guerilla actions as the "new." The "New Left" is
retreating and a harder, ideologically-oriented
Left is gaining strength.
Many of what were last year's radicals have
discovered and internalized an authentic
revolutionary identity.
Because of these trends, 1970 appears to be a
period of transition for those students on the
farthest Left. Tom Hayden captured this sense in
his April speech here when he said, "The
'Conspiracy 7' trial was the attempt of the
dinosaurs of the 1950's to keep the 1960 s from
becoming the 1970'5." Burnings, bombings, and
"trashines" may have heralded Hayden's '70's.
But THE STUDENT MOVEMENT is not only
composed of radicals and revolutionaries. There
are also the liberals and liberal-radicals. In past
years these two groups were able to work
together fairly easily, but as radicals have become
revolutionaries, they have increasingly found
themselves more isolated. Small, "mobile.

militant actions" taken by 200-300 radicals have
partly replaced the mass movements staged last
spring by coalitions of liberals and radicals.
All of this does not mean, however, that mass,
non-violent movements are dead on campuses.
For while that prediction might have seemed
somewhat correct a month ago, the national
strike in protest over Cambodia changed thatâ€”at
least for a time.
What is significant is that mass actions are no
longer led by radicals. The leadership role has
been seized by the liberal-radicals. In fact, one of

the most significant trends of the last lew
months may be the new relationship that is
developing between these liberal-radicals and the
pro to-revolutionaries.
It seems that the activist student movement is
polarizing. While radicals have become
revolutionaries, the politics of most of their more
moderate allies have remained relatively stable.
At Stanford this polarization was especially
prominent during the Cambodia strike when
radicals set up the radical caucus as a leadership
structure parallel to the more moderate strike
coordinating committee.
What is called THE STUDENT MOVEMENT,
has split apart this year. It is difficult to see just
how this split will effect its functioning in the
luture. A partial answer, may be found,
however, in the dynamics of the past year's
activist politics at Stanford.
Clirmiivlv Of Emits
Two years ago THE SPRING ISSUE was the
campus judicial policy. Last year it revolved
around the question of war research at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI). And this year
it was ROTC.

vVhen Stanford's 12,000 students returned to
the campus' browned grass and dried-up lake this
last fall, few would have believed that officer's
training would emerge as a controversial issue.
The previous spring the faculty Senate had
denied "academic credit for participation in
programs of military training and education,"
and most thought that decision doomed ROTC
to a quick death.
For the first few months of the year, there
was hardly a mention of the cadets and
midshipmen that quietly continued their training
been established by Pitzer with the consent of
laculty Senate chairman Leonard Schilf to work
out, in Pitzer's words, "arrangements (for making
ROTC) an extracurricular activity."
and drills.
Instead, radicals argued over their factional,
ideological differences, and liberal and
liberal-radicals delved into preparations for
peace moratoria. Most campus issues were
submerged in preparations for October and
November 15. Radicals seemed intent on pushing
the land development issue, but they got little
attention.
It was a splendid fall for moderates. 5.000
marched in Palo Alto in October and 300,000
clogged the Polo Grounds in November.
Thousands canvassed and engaged in rational
dialogue in between Plunkett-studed Saturdays.
But December arrived, the Moratorium died and
the radicals split.
Then came Winter Quarter and Pitzer's
announcement at a January Academic Council
meeting that a new contract providing for limited
ROTC credit had been negotiated with the
Army. Few noticed. The Daily story that
reported the speech briefly mentioned the
statement in the last paragraph. A few week's

significant. It began at 9 a.m. on April 29. By
3:00 there were only about 200 people in the
Old Union and they were asking each other why
the sit-in had failed. Then came the first rumors
of some kind of imminent involvement in
Cambodia.
The police warned the demonstrators they
were trespassing and went for reinforcements. In
the 2-3 hours before deputies arrived, the crowd
grew steadily until its 1200 persons filled the Old
Union Courtyard and spilled out around it. The
police came. Rocks crashed into their windows
and a full-scale riot broke out. The next night
was even more violent, but by Friday evening
only a few hundred protesters participated, and a
few dozen windows were broken.
On Sunday, May 4 the student strike began.
With faculty support buildings were shut and
classes brought near a standstill. Leadership of
the strike shifted to the liberal-radical group and
at this time the revolutionaries found it necessary
to form a parallel organization, the radical
caucus.
Then came the big surprise. President Pitzer
asked the faculty Senate to reconsider the entire
issue of ROTC. A week later that faculty body
reversed itself for the second time within a little
over a year, ended all ROTC credit and narrowly
decided to delay consideration of whether
officer's training should be on campus. Since that
decision the campus has been relatively calm.
lion- lias I'itzpr Dom* ?
Inherent in any analysis of the events of the
ROTC crisis is the question of why Pitzer acted
the way he did when he did. It is difficult to find
any logic running through the 16 months since
the first Senate decision.
Publicly, the President has consistently
maintained that his limited credit
recommendations were "very close indeed to
recommendations by the Senate on February 13,
1969 (the no-credit recommendations). But
other statements made by Pitzer in the past 16
months cloud this rationale.
In March of last year he talks as though all
credit issues have been decided and says that all
that remains to be worked out is administrative
details of what form of "extracurricular activity"
ROTC should be.
By May he is asking that his Advisory
Committee consider the Trustee and the student
referenda asking that some credit be retained for
officer's training, and in January he is
acknowledging that the new Army contract
represents a compromise with disgruntled
alumni, trustees, and other outside friends.
"This is one area in which all sorts of friends
of the University are concerned," he said at a
press conference. "So I thought that if it was
possible to compromise with these groups it was
best to do so."
Then, suddenly, in the midst of the
Cambodian crisis and rioting on campus, the
President reversed his position in asking for the
Senate to again reconsider its decision. In doing
this he knew full well that credit would be
denied ROTC and that it might be forced off
campus.
Why then did he do it? He justified the
reconsideration on the basis of Brook's
candidacy for an Air Force job, while
maintaining that his candidacy had no effect on
his negotiations. That seems illogical, however,
for he is saying: 1) Brooks' negotiations are not
tainted by the candidacy, 2) I want you to
reconsider the issue even though I know you will
reverse this justly arrived at contract, and 3) I
will make no recommendation that the limited
credit plan again be upheld.
It is more likely that Pitzer was acting this
month with only one goal in mindâ€”the
preservation of the University. The ROTC
protests thrust into the environment of the
Cambodian crisis threatened that and he felt he
had to compromise again.

TOM HAYDEN


PRESIDENT PITZER
The universities, as forums for violent and
non-violent dissent in America, find themselves
weakened and stumbling as they enter the decade
of the 1970'5. Their buildings are attacked,
forcibly shut, often destroyed. Students have
sustained and intensified their attacks of the last
decade on nationalistic institutions within the
universities; and as recently as this month have
attempted to seize the University and use it as a
political tool in society.
Still, most University trustees, administrators
and faculty have insisted upon maintaining the
traditional American ideal of the University as an
apolitical collection of scholars and gentlemen.
As a result the non-politicians have found
their institutions woefully unprepared to deal
with forceful political challenges made by brash,
"ungentlemanly " members of their community.
With judicial mechanisms based on honor codes
and the like, universities have proven especially
vulnerable.
As a result, this spring college after college has
been forced to shut its doors or radically alter its
academic calendar. The second annual student
spring offensive against nationalism in the
Universities has ripped a gash in America's soft
underbelly of academia. In fact, last year's
disorders appear mild when analyzed in this
year's perspective.
What has caused the greater vehemence of this
year's protests? The most important factor is
obviously President Nixon's order to invade
Cambodia. The President's hard-line, cold-warish
speech to the nation on May 3 united students in
nationwide protest.
For the first time since the protest movement
grew out of the teach-in stage, students were
faced with what they saw as the blatant widening
of the war in Indochina, and they reacted.
But Cambodia was not the only cause of this
year's intensified student protests. The rest of the
answer lay on the campuses. The Student
movement in 1970 was not what it was in 1969,
either here or anywhere else in the nation.
To better understand the implications that
change has for Universities in general and
Stanford in particular, I have tried to analyze
three major topics; 1 ) how did the student
movement change this year, 2) how was this
change reflected in events at Stanford, and 3)
how effectively did Stanford's administrative
leadership respond to the changes.
77*(* SI mien t Move me n1
Bombs in New York buildings and town
houses, tires in California banks, and broken
windows in Stanford buildings shrieked of the
change that has come over the most alienated
members of America's youth this year.
As one Stanford activist said this spring,
"What we have is a radical movement becoming a
revolutionary one." The history of radical
development during the past year reinforces this
analysis. Revolutionary rhetoric has become
more frequent and proto-revolutionary action
has largely replaced radical non-violent tactics.
Many of the new revolutionaries see sit-ins
and marches as the "old" tactics and small-scale
guerilla actions as the "new." The "New Left" is
retreating and a harder, ideologically-oriented
Left is gaining strength.
Many of what were last year's radicals have
discovered and internalized an authentic
revolutionary identity.
Because of these trends, 1970 appears to be a
period of transition for those students on the
farthest Left. Tom Hayden captured this sense in
his April speech here when he said, "The
'Conspiracy 7' trial was the attempt of the
dinosaurs of the 1950's to keep the 1960 s from
becoming the 1970'5." Burnings, bombings, and
"trashines" may have heralded Hayden's '70's.
But THE STUDENT MOVEMENT is not only
composed of radicals and revolutionaries. There
are also the liberals and liberal-radicals. In past
years these two groups were able to work
together fairly easily, but as radicals have become
revolutionaries, they have increasingly found
themselves more isolated. Small, "mobile.

militant actions" taken by 200-300 radicals have
partly replaced the mass movements staged last
spring by coalitions of liberals and radicals.
All of this does not mean, however, that mass,
non-violent movements are dead on campuses.
For while that prediction might have seemed
somewhat correct a month ago, the national
strike in protest over Cambodia changed thatâ€”at
least for a time.
What is significant is that mass actions are no
longer led by radicals. The leadership role has
been seized by the liberal-radicals. In fact, one of

the most significant trends of the last lew
months may be the new relationship that is
developing between these liberal-radicals and the
pro to-revolutionaries.
It seems that the activist student movement is
polarizing. While radicals have become
revolutionaries, the politics of most of their more
moderate allies have remained relatively stable.
At Stanford this polarization was especially
prominent during the Cambodia strike when
radicals set up the radical caucus as a leadership
structure parallel to the more moderate strike
coordinating committee.
What is called THE STUDENT MOVEMENT,
has split apart this year. It is difficult to see just
how this split will effect its functioning in the
luture. A partial answer, may be found,
however, in the dynamics of the past year's
activist politics at Stanford.
Clirmiivlv Of Emits
Two years ago THE SPRING ISSUE was the
campus judicial policy. Last year it revolved
around the question of war research at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI). And this year
it was ROTC.

vVhen Stanford's 12,000 students returned to
the campus' browned grass and dried-up lake this
last fall, few would have believed that officer's
training would emerge as a controversial issue.
The previous spring the faculty Senate had
denied "academic credit for participation in
programs of military training and education,"
and most thought that decision doomed ROTC
to a quick death.
For the first few months of the year, there
was hardly a mention of the cadets and
midshipmen that quietly continued their training
been established by Pitzer with the consent of
laculty Senate chairman Leonard Schilf to work
out, in Pitzer's words, "arrangements (for making
ROTC) an extracurricular activity."
and drills.
Instead, radicals argued over their factional,
ideological differences, and liberal and
liberal-radicals delved into preparations for
peace moratoria. Most campus issues were
submerged in preparations for October and
November 15. Radicals seemed intent on pushing
the land development issue, but they got little
attention.
It was a splendid fall for moderates. 5.000
marched in Palo Alto in October and 300,000
clogged the Polo Grounds in November.
Thousands canvassed and engaged in rational
dialogue in between Plunkett-studed Saturdays.
But December arrived, the Moratorium died and
the radicals split.
Then came Winter Quarter and Pitzer's
announcement at a January Academic Council
meeting that a new contract providing for limited
ROTC credit had been negotiated with the
Army. Few noticed. The Daily story that
reported the speech briefly mentioned the
statement in the last paragraph. A few week's
later, however, after Pitzer's strong formal
recommendation that the Army limited credit
plan be accepted by the Senate, bewildered
students and faculty began to ask what had
happened.
With the release of the minutes qf private
meetings of The President's Advisory Committeei
on ROTC the details of what seemed to be a
puzzling reversal of the Senate's 1969 non-credit
decision began to unravel.
The Presidential Advisory Commitk*e
At the May Trustees meeting, however the
Board strongly urged reconsideration of the
Senate decision. By June when Pitzer wrote his
instructions to the Advisory Committee his
position had changed. He asked them to work for
renegotiating ROTC contracts "consistent with
the spirit of the Senate actions . . . with due
consideration also of the student and Trustee
view points as expressed by their respective
resolutions." Those referendams had asked that
ROTC receive limited credit.
The importance of this addition is apparent in
the minutes of the first meeting of the advisory
committee which decided that despite the March
agreement between Schiff and Pitzer that only
administrative matters remained, "nothing in the
charge to the Committee (from Pitzer) prevents
it from considering and rendering advice on any
question it deems appropriate."
During the late spring and summer Vice
Provost Howard Brooke negotiated the new
contract with the Army that provided for limited
credit. Some have questioned whether Brooks
should have been given this job since he had
authored the Minority ROTC Report asking for
limited ROTC credit, and that report had been
expressly rejected by the Senate in its February,
1969 "no credit" decision.
But the contract was negotiated, and in the
Fall submitted to the Advisory Committee for
approval. In early January that approval was
given Many have challenged the validity of that

committee's decision, however, since five of its
eight members entered their posts with the
preconception that officer's training deserved
some credit. Further challenges to the
committeeee's makeup arose because two of the
three student members chosen were ROTC
cadets.
Still, Pitzer accepted their recommendation
and late in Jan "strongly" urged the Senate to
adopt it. A few weeks later it did 23-13 and the
controversy began.
Through the rest of Winter quarter radicals

tried to gain support for opposing ROTC on
campus; but most students scorned apathetic, and
most protest action for the rest of that quarter
was limited to 100 to 200 people interrupting
ROTC classes and drills.
The spring recess came before a faculty mail
ballot challenge to the Senate's decision could be
made.
The mail ballot finally came in on March 30,
and the President and the Senate were upheld by
a narrow-vote margin. That only served to set the
stage for Tom Hayden's speech the next night
and a long spring quarter to come.
It was late on the evening of March 31 that
students gathered after the Hayden speech
decided to march on the Athletic-ROTC building
and "board it up." When they got there a few
windows were broken and moments later the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies were upon
them. The group of 300-400 radicals retreated
and marched around campus breaking windows.
What followed was a chronicle of protest
action too detailed to recount here. There were
two more nights of "trashing" before the
protesters, still predominaitly radicals, turned to
daylight mill-ins at the Athletic building.
Sometime during these few weeks liberal-radical

elements joined with radical forces determined to
create a mass movement and gradually seized
power from the radicals favoring more "mass
militant night-time action."
The result was two sit-ins and two mass police
arrests. It was the second sit-in that was most
significant. It began at 9 a.m. on April 29. By
3:00 there were only about 200 people in the

PRESIDENT PITZER
The universities, as forums for violent and
non-violent dissent in America, find themselves
weakened and stumbling as they enter the decade
of the 1970'5. Their buildings are attacked,
forcibly shut, often destroyed. Students have
sustained and intensified their attacks of the last
decade on nationalistic institutions within the
universities; and as recently as this month have
attempted to seize the University and use it as a
political tool in society.
Still, most University trustees, administrators
and faculty have insisted upon maintaining the
traditional American ideal of the University as an
apolitical collection of scholars and gentlemen.
As a result the non-politicians have found
their institutions woefully unprepared to deal
with forceful political challenges made by brash,
"ungentlemanly " members of their community.
With judicial mechanisms based on honor codes
and the like, universities have proven especially
vulnerable.
As a result, this spring college after college has
been forced to shut its doors or radically alter its
academic calendar. The second annual student
spring offensive against nationalism in the
Universities has ripped a gash in America's soft
underbelly of academia. In fact, last year's
disorders appear mild when analyzed in this
year's perspective.
What has caused the greater vehemence of this
year's protests? The most important factor is
obviously President Nixon's order to invade
Cambodia. The President's hard-line, cold-warish
speech to the nation on May 3 united students in
nationwide protest.
For the first time since the protest movement
grew out of the teach-in stage, students were
faced with what they saw as the blatant widening
of the war in Indochina, and they reacted.
But Cambodia was not the only cause of this
year's intensified student protests. The rest of the
answer lay on the campuses. The Student
movement in 1970 was not what it was in 1969,
either here or anywhere else in the nation.
To better understand the implications that
change has for Universities in general and
Stanford in particular, I have tried to analyze
three major topics; 1 ) how did the student
movement change this year, 2) how was this
change reflected in events at Stanford, and 3)
how effectively did Stanford's administrative
leadership respond to the changes.
77*(* SI mien t Move me n1
Bombs in New York buildings and town
houses, tires in California banks, and broken
windows in Stanford buildings shrieked of the
change that has come over the most alienated
members of America's youth this year.
As one Stanford activist said this spring,
"What we have is a radical movement becoming a
revolutionary one." The history of radical
development during the past year reinforces this
analysis. Revolutionary rhetoric has become
more frequent and proto-revolutionary action
has largely replaced radical non-violent tactics.
Many of the new revolutionaries see sit-ins
and marches as the "old" tactics and small-scale
guerilla actions as the "new." The "New Left" is
retreating and a harder, ideologically-oriented
Left is gaining strength.
Many of what were last year's radicals have
discovered and internalized an authentic
revolutionary identity.
Because of these trends, 1970 appears to be a
period of transition for those students on the
farthest Left. Tom Hayden captured this sense in
his April speech here when he said, "The
'Conspiracy 7' trial was the attempt of the
dinosaurs of the 1950's to keep the 1960 s from
becoming the 1970'5." Burnings, bombings, and
"trashines" may have heralded Hayden's '70's.
But THE STUDENT MOVEMENT is not only
composed of radicals and revolutionaries. There
are also the liberals and liberal-radicals. In past
years these two groups were able to work
together fairly easily, but as radicals have become
revolutionaries, they have increasingly found
themselves more isolated. Small, "mobile.

militant actions" taken by 200-300 radicals have
partly replaced the mass movements staged last
spring by coalitions of liberals and radicals.
All of this does not mean, however, that mass,
non-violent movements are dead on campuses.
For while that prediction might have seemed
somewhat correct a month ago, the national
strike in protest over Cambodia changed thatâ€”at
least for a time.
What is significant is that mass actions are no
longer led by radicals. The leadership role has
been seized by the liberal-radicals. In fact, one of

the most significant trends of the last lew
months may be the new relationship that is
developing between these liberal-radicals and the
pro to-revolutionaries.
It seems that the activist student movement is
polarizing. While radicals have become
revolutionaries, the politics of most of their more
moderate allies have remained relatively stable.
At Stanford this polarization was especially
prominent during the Cambodia strike when
radicals set up the radical caucus as a leadership
structure parallel to the more moderate strike
coordinating committee.
What is called THE STUDENT MOVEMENT,
has split apart this year. It is difficult to see just
how this split will effect its functioning in the
luture. A partial answer, may be found,
however, in the dynamics of the past year's
activist politics at Stanford.
Clirmiivlv Of Emits
Two years ago THE SPRING ISSUE was the
campus judicial policy. Last year it revolved
around the question of war research at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI). And this year
it was ROTC.

vVhen Stanford's 12,000 students returned to
the campus' browned grass and dried-up lake this
last fall, few would have believed that officer's
training would emerge as a controversial issue.
The previous spring the faculty Senate had
denied "academic credit for participation in
programs of military training and education,"
and most thought that decision doomed ROTC
to a quick death.
For the first few months of the year, there
was hardly a mention of the cadets and
midshipmen that quietly continued their training
been established by Pitzer with the consent of
laculty Senate chairman Leonard Schilf to work
out, in Pitzer's words, "arrangements (for making
ROTC) an extracurricular activity."
and drills.
Instead, radicals argued over their factional,
ideological differences, and liberal and
liberal-radicals delved into preparations for
peace moratoria. Most campus issues were
submerged in preparations for October and
November 15. Radicals seemed intent on pushing
the land development issue, but they got little
attention.
It was a splendid fall for moderates. 5.000
marched in Palo Alto in October and 300,000
clogged the Polo Grounds in November.
Thousands canvassed and engaged in rational
dialogue in between Plunkett-studed Saturdays.
But December arrived, the Moratorium died and
the radicals split.
Then came Winter Quarter and Pitzer's
announcement at a January Academic Council
meeting that a new contract providing for limited
ROTC credit had been negotiated with the
Army. Few noticed. The Daily story that
reported the speech briefly mentioned the
statement in the last paragraph. A few week's
later, however, after Pitzer's strong formal
recommendation that the Army limited credit
plan be accepted by the Senate, bewildered
students and faculty began to ask what had
happened.
With the release of the minutes qf private
meetings of The President's Advisory Committeei
on ROTC the details of what seemed to be a
puzzling reversal of the Senate's 1969 non-credit
decision began to unravel.
The Presidential Advisory Commitk*e
At the May Trustees meeting, however the
Board strongly urged reconsideration of the
Senate decision. By June when Pitzer wrote his
instructions to the Advisory Committee his
position had changed. He asked them to work for
renegotiating ROTC contracts "consistent with
the spirit of the Senate actions . . . with due
consideration also of the student and Trustee
view points as expressed by their respective
resolutions." Those referendams had asked that
ROTC receive limited credit.
The importance of this addition is apparent in
the minutes of the first meeting of the advisory
committee which decided that despite the March
agreement between Schiff and Pitzer that only
administrative matters remained, "nothing in the
charge to the Committee (from Pitzer) prevents
it from considering and rendering advice on any
question it deems appropriate."
During the late spring and summer Vice
Provost Howard Brooke negotiated the new
contract with the Army that provided for limited
credit. Some have questioned whether Brooks
should have been given this job since he had
authored the Minority ROTC Report asking for
limited ROTC credit, and that report had been
expressly rejected by the Senate in its February,
1969 "no credit" decision.
But the contract was negotiated, and in the
Fall submitted to the Advisory Committee for
approval. In early January that approval was
given Many have challenged the validity of that

committee's decision, however, since five of its
eight members entered their posts with the
preconception that officer's training deserved
some credit. Further challenges to the
committeeee's makeup arose because two of the
three student members chosen were ROTC
cadets.
Still, Pitzer accepted their recommendation
and late in Jan "strongly" urged the Senate to
adopt it. A few weeks later it did 23-13 and the
controversy began.
Through the rest of Winter quarter radicals

tried to gain support for opposing ROTC on
campus; but most students scorned apathetic, and
most protest action for the rest of that quarter
was limited to 100 to 200 people interrupting
ROTC classes and drills.
The spring recess came before a faculty mail
ballot challenge to the Senate's decision could be
made.
The mail ballot finally came in on March 30,
and the President and the Senate were upheld by
a narrow-vote margin. That only served to set the
stage for Tom Hayden's speech the next night
and a long spring quarter to come.
It was late on the evening of March 31 that
students gathered after the Hayden speech
decided to march on the Athletic-ROTC building
and "board it up." When they got there a few
windows were broken and moments later the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies were upon
them. The group of 300-400 radicals retreated
and marched around campus breaking windows.
What followed was a chronicle of protest
action too detailed to recount here. There were
two more nights of "trashing" before the
protesters, still predominaitly radicals, turned to
daylight mill-ins at the Athletic building.
Sometime during these few weeks liberal-radical

elements joined with radical forces determined to
create a mass movement and gradually seized
power from the radicals favoring more "mass
militant night-time action."
The result was two sit-ins and two mass police
arrests. It was the second sit-in that was most
significant. It began at 9 a.m. on April 29. By
3:00 there were only about 200 people in the
Old Union and they were asking each other why
the sit-in had failed. Then came the first rumors
of some kind of imminent involvement in
Cambodia.
The police warned the demonstrators they
were trespassing and went for reinforcements. In
the 2-3 hours before deputies arrived, the crowd
grew steadily until its 1200 persons filled the Old
Union Courtyard and spilled out around it. The
police came. Rocks crashed into their windows
and a full-scale riot broke out. The next night
was even more violent, but by Friday evening
only a few hundred protesters participated, and a
few dozen windows were broken.
On Sunday, May 4 the student strike began.
With faculty support buildings were shut and
classes brought near a standstill. Leadership of
the strike shifted to the liberal-radical group and
at this time the revolutionaries found it necessary
to form a parallel organization, the radical
caucus.
Then came the big surprise. President Pitzer
asked the faculty Senate to reconsider the entire
issue of ROTC. A week later that faculty body
reversed itself for the second time within a little
over a year, ended all ROTC credit and narrowly
decided to delay consideration of whether
officer's training should be on campus. Since that
decision the campus has been relatively calm.
lion- lias I'itzpr Dom* ?
Inherent in any analysis of the events of the
ROTC crisis is the question of why Pitzer acted
the way he did when he did. It is difficult to find
any logic running through the 16 months since
the first Senate decision.
Publicly, the President has consistently
maintained that his limited credit
recommendations were "very close indeed to
recommendations by the Senate on February 13,
1969 (the no-credit recommendations). But
other statements made by Pitzer in the past 16
months cloud this rationale.
In March of last year he talks as though all
credit issues have been decided and says that all
that remains to be worked out is administrative
details of what form of "extracurricular activity"
ROTC should be.
By May he is asking that his Advisory
Committee consider the Trustee and the student
referenda asking that some credit be retained for
officer's training, and in January he is
acknowledging that the new Army contract
represents a compromise with disgruntled
alumni, trustees, and other outside friends.
"This is one area in which all sorts of friends
of the University are concerned," he said at a
press conference. "So I thought that if it was
possible to compromise with these groups it was
best to do so."
Then, suddenly, in the midst of the
Cambodian crisis and rioting on campus, the
President reversed his position in asking for the
Senate to again reconsider its decision. In doing
this he knew full well that credit would be
denied ROTC and that it might be forced off
campus.
Why then did he do it? He justified the
reconsideration on the basis of Brook's
candidacy for an Air Force job, while
maintaining that his candidacy had no effect on
his negotiations. That seems illogical, however,
for he is saying: 1) Brooks' negotiations are not
tainted by the candidacy, 2) I want you to
reconsider the issue even though I know you will
reverse this justly arrived at contract, and 3) I
will make no recommendation that the limited
credit plan again be upheld.
It is more likely that Pitzer was acting this
month with only one goal in mindâ€”the
preservation of the University. The ROTC
protests thrust into the environment of the
Cambodian crisis threatened that and he felt he
had to compromise again.

becoming the 1970'5." Burnings, bombings, and
"trashines" may have heralded Hayden's '70's.
But THE STUDENT MOVEMENT is not only
composed of radicals and revolutionaries. There
are also the liberals and liberal-radicals. In past
years these two groups were able to work
together fairly easily, but as radicals have become
revolutionaries, they have increasingly found
themselves more isolated. Small, "mobile.

militant actions" taken by 200-300 radicals have
partly replaced the mass movements staged last
spring by coalitions of liberals and radicals.
All of this does not mean, however, that mass,
non-violent movements are dead on campuses.
For while that prediction might have seemed
somewhat correct a month ago, the national
strike in protest over Cambodia changed thatâ€”at
least for a time.
What is significant is that mass actions are no
longer led by radicals. The leadership role has
been seized by the liberal-radicals. In fact, one of

the most significant trends of the last lew
months may be the new relationship that is
developing between these liberal-radicals and the
pro to-revolutionaries.
It seems that the activist student movement is
polarizing. While radicals have become
revolutionaries, the politics of most of their more
moderate allies have remained relatively stable.
At Stanford this polarization was especially
prominent during the Cambodia strike when
radicals set up the radical caucus as a leadership
structure parallel to the more moderate strike
coordinating committee.
What is called THE STUDENT MOVEMENT,
has split apart this year. It is difficult to see just
how this split will effect its functioning in the
luture. A partial answer, may be found,
however, in the dynamics of the past year's
activist politics at Stanford.
Clirmiivlv Of Emits
Two years ago THE SPRING ISSUE was the
campus judicial policy. Last year it revolved
around the question of war research at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI). And this year
it was ROTC.

vVhen Stanford's 12,000 students returned to
the campus' browned grass and dried-up lake this
last fall, few would have believed that officer's
training would emerge as a controversial issue.
The previous spring the faculty Senate had
denied "academic credit for participation in
programs of military training and education,"
and most thought that decision doomed ROTC
to a quick death.
For the first few months of the year, there
was hardly a mention of the cadets and
midshipmen that quietly continued their training
been established by Pitzer with the consent of
laculty Senate chairman Leonard Schilf to work
out, in Pitzer's words, "arrangements (for making
ROTC) an extracurricular activity."
and drills.
Instead, radicals argued over their factional,
ideological differences, and liberal and
liberal-radicals delved into preparations for
peace moratoria. Most campus issues were
submerged in preparations for October and
November 15. Radicals seemed intent on pushing
the land development issue, but they got little
attention.
It was a splendid fall for moderates. 5.000
marched in Palo Alto in October and 300,000
clogged the Polo Grounds in November.
Thousands canvassed and engaged in rational
dialogue in between Plunkett-studed Saturdays.
But December arrived, the Moratorium died and
the radicals split.
Then came Winter Quarter and Pitzer's
announcement at a January Academic Council
meeting that a new contract providing for limited
ROTC credit had been negotiated with the
Army. Few noticed. The Daily story that
reported the speech briefly mentioned the
statement in the last paragraph. A few week's
later, however, after Pitzer's strong formal
recommendation that the Army limited credit
plan be accepted by the Senate, bewildered
students and faculty began to ask what had
happened.
With the release of the minutes qf private
meetings of The President's Advisory Committeei
on ROTC the details of what seemed to be a
puzzling reversal of the Senate's 1969 non-credit
decision began to unravel.
The Presidential Advisory Commitk*e
At the May Trustees meeting, however the
Board strongly urged reconsideration of the
Senate decision. By June when Pitzer wrote his
instructions to the Advisory Committee his
position had changed. He asked them to work for
renegotiating ROTC contracts "consistent with
the spirit of the Senate actions . . . with due
consideration also of the student and Trustee
view points as expressed by their respective
resolutions." Those referendams had asked that
ROTC receive limited credit.
The importance of this addition is apparent in
the minutes of the first meeting of the advisory
committee which decided that despite the March
agreement between Schiff and Pitzer that only
administrative matters remained, "nothing in the
charge to the Committee (from Pitzer) prevents
it from considering and rendering advice on any
question it deems appropriate."
During the late spring and summer Vice
Provost Howard Brooke negotiated the new
contract with the Army that provided for limited
credit. Some have questioned whether Brooks
should have been given this job since he had
authored the Minority ROTC Report asking for
limited ROTC credit, and that report had been
expressly rejected by the Senate in its February,
1969 "no credit" decision.
But the contract was negotiated, and in the
Fall submitted to the Advisory Committee for
approval. In early January that approval was
given Many have challenged the validity of that

committee's decision, however, since five of its
eight members entered their posts with the
preconception that officer's training deserved
some credit. Further challenges to the
committeeee's makeup arose because two of the
three student members chosen were ROTC
cadets.
Still, Pitzer accepted their recommendation
and late in Jan "strongly" urged the Senate to
adopt it. A few weeks later it did 23-13 and the
controversy began.
Through the rest of Winter quarter radicals

tried to gain support for opposing ROTC on
campus; but most students scorned apathetic, and
most protest action for the rest of that quarter
was limited to 100 to 200 people interrupting
ROTC classes and drills.
The spring recess came before a faculty mail
ballot challenge to the Senate's decision could be
made.
The mail ballot finally came in on March 30,
and the President and the Senate were upheld by
a narrow-vote margin. That only served to set the
stage for Tom Hayden's speech the next night
and a long spring quarter to come.
It was late on the evening of March 31 that
students gathered after the Hayden speech
decided to march on the Athletic-ROTC building
and "board it up." When they got there a few
windows were broken and moments later the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies were upon
them. The group of 300-400 radicals retreated
and marched around campus breaking windows.
What followed was a chronicle of protest
action too detailed to recount here. There were
two more nights of "trashing" before the
protesters, still predominaitly radicals, turned to
daylight mill-ins at the Athletic building.
Sometime during these few weeks liberal-radical

elements joined with radical forces determined to
create a mass movement and gradually seized
power from the radicals favoring more "mass
militant night-time action."
The result was two sit-ins and two mass police
arrests. It was the second sit-in that was most
significant. It began at 9 a.m. on April 29. By
3:00 there were only about 200 people in the
Old Union and they were asking each other why
the sit-in had failed. Then came the first rumors
of some kind of imminent involvement in
Cambodia.
The police warned the demonstrators they
were trespassing and went for reinforcements. In
the 2-3 hours before deputies arrived, the crowd
grew steadily until its 1200 persons filled the Old
Union Courtyard and spilled out around it. The
police came. Rocks crashed into their windows
and a full-scale riot broke out. The next night
was even more violent, but by Friday evening
only a few hundred protesters participated, and a
few dozen windows were broken.
On Sunday, May 4 the student strike began.
With faculty support buildings were shut and
classes brought near a standstill. Leadership of
the strike shifted to the liberal-radical group and
at this time the revolutionaries found it necessary
to form a parallel organization, the radical
caucus.
Then came the big surprise. President Pitzer
asked the faculty Senate to reconsider the entire
issue of ROTC. A week later that faculty body
reversed itself for the second time within a little
over a year, ended all ROTC credit and narrowly
decided to delay consideration of whether
officer's training should be on campus. Since that
decision the campus has been relatively calm.
lion- lias I'itzpr Dom* ?
Inherent in any analysis of the events of the
ROTC crisis is the question of why Pitzer acted
the way he did when he did. It is difficult to find
any logic running through the 16 months since
the first Senate decision.
Publicly, the President has consistently
maintained that his limited credit
recommendations were "very close indeed to
recommendations by the Senate on February 13,
1969 (the no-credit recommendations). But
other statements made by Pitzer in the past 16
months cloud this rationale.
In March of last year he talks as though all
credit issues have been decided and says that all
that remains to be worked out is administrative
details of what form of "extracurricular activity"
ROTC should be.
By May he is asking that his Advisory
Committee consider the Trustee and the student
referenda asking that some credit be retained for
officer's training, and in January he is
acknowledging that the new Army contract
represents a compromise with disgruntled
alumni, trustees, and other outside friends.
"This is one area in which all sorts of friends
of the University are concerned," he said at a
press conference. "So I thought that if it was
possible to compromise with these groups it was
best to do so."
Then, suddenly, in the midst of the
Cambodian crisis and rioting on campus, the
President reversed his position in asking for the
Senate to again reconsider its decision. In doing
this he knew full well that credit would be
denied ROTC and that it might be forced off
campus.
Why then did he do it? He justified the
reconsideration on the basis of Brook's
candidacy for an Air Force job, while
maintaining that his candidacy had no effect on
his negotiations. That seems illogical, however,
for he is saying: 1) Brooks' negotiations are not
tainted by the candidacy, 2) I want you to
reconsider the issue even though I know you will
reverse this justly arrived at contract, and 3) I
will make no recommendation that the limited
credit plan again be upheld.
It is more likely that Pitzer was acting this
month with only one goal in mindâ€”the
preservation of the University. The ROTC
protests thrust into the environment of the
Cambodian crisis threatened that and he felt he
had to compromise again.

PRESIDENT PITZER
The universities, as forums for violent and
non-violent dissent in America, find themselves
weakened and stumbling as they enter the decade
of the 1970'5. Their buildings are attacked,
forcibly shut, often destroyed. Students have
sustained and intensified their attacks of the last
decade on nationalistic institutions within the
universities; and as recently as this month have
attempted to seize the University and use it as a
political tool in society.
Still, most University trustees, administrators
and faculty have insisted upon maintaining the
traditional American ideal of the University as an
apolitical collection of scholars and gentlemen.
As a result the non-politicians have found
their institutions woefully unprepared to deal
with forceful political challenges made by brash,
"ungentlemanly " members of their community.
With judicial mechanisms based on honor codes
and the like, universities have proven especially
vulnerable.
As a result, this spring college after college has
been forced to shut its doors or radically alter its
academic calendar. The second annual student
spring offensive against nationalism in the
Universities has ripped a gash in America's soft
underbelly of academia. In fact, last year's
disorders appear mild when analyzed in this
year's perspective.
What has caused the greater vehemence of this
year's protests? The most important factor is
obviously President Nixon's order to invade
Cambodia. The President's hard-line, cold-warish
speech to the nation on May 3 united students in
nationwide protest.
For the first time since the protest movement
grew out of the teach-in stage, students were
faced with what they saw as the blatant widening
of the war in Indochina, and they reacted.
But Cambodia was not the only cause of this
year's intensified student protests. The rest of the
answer lay on the campuses. The Student
movement in 1970 was not what it was in 1969,
either here or anywhere else in the nation.
To better understand the implications that
change has for Universities in general and
Stanford in particular, I have tried to analyze
three major topics; 1 ) how did the student
movement change this year, 2) how was this
change reflected in events at Stanford, and 3)
how effectively did Stanford's administrative
leadership respond to the changes.
77*(* SI mien t Move me n1
Bombs in New York buildings and town
houses, tires in California banks, and broken
windows in Stanford buildings shrieked of the
change that has come over the most alienated
members of America's youth this year.
As one Stanford activist said this spring,
"What we have is a radical movement becoming a
revolutionary one." The history of radical
development during the past year reinforces this
analysis. Revolutionary rhetoric has become
more frequent and proto-revolutionary action
has largely replaced radical non-violent tactics.
Many of the new revolutionaries see sit-ins
and marches as the "old" tactics and small-scale
guerilla actions as the "new." The "New Left" is
retreating and a harder, ideologically-oriented
Left is gaining strength.
Many of what were last year's radicals have
discovered and internalized an authentic
revolutionary identity.
Because of these trends, 1970 appears to be a
period of transition for those students on the
farthest Left. Tom Hayden captured this sense in
his April speech here when he said, "The
'Conspiracy 7' trial was the attempt of the
dinosaurs of the 1950's to keep the 1960 s from
becoming the 1970'5." Burnings, bombings, and
"trashines" may have heralded Hayden's '70's.
But THE STUDENT MOVEMENT is not only
composed of radicals and revolutionaries. There
are also the liberals and liberal-radicals. In past
years these two groups were able to work
together fairly easily, but as radicals have become

non-violent movements are dead on campuses.
