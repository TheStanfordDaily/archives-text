# Who Saw The Files?
## 
### BILL EVERS FRANK MILLER 
While pretending to be a police
informant on radical activities (see
related story), a Wilbur resident
discovered the existence of a small
card file on 50 to 150 radicals and
prominent campus figures. A few
of the subjects had no record of
illegal conduct and no apparent
contact with police.
The informant learned that the
files had been kept by the
Stanford police, but access to the
information had been granted to
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department.
According to several sources,
University officials -impounded
the file as soon as they heard
about it. However, unbeknownst
to many officials, access was
apparently granted again to
Sheriff's deputies after the records
had been impounded.

Yesterday President Pitzer
directed the file be placed in a
locked safe in the President's
office. He said access would be
allowed only upon express order
of the President or, in his absence,
the Acting President.
According to a letter Pitzer
sent to SCLC Chairman Hubert
Marshall, the file contains
information about students and a
few non-students. Some have been
arrested for criminal activity and
some are noted campus figures
with no contact with the police.
Most of the cards are on radicals.
University legal advisor Jim
Siena indicated yesterday
afternoon that a few of the cards
contained a record of the subjects
attendance at a political meeting.
Stanford Police Chief Thomas Bell
stated that such information only
pertained to certain meetings not
held on campus.
Descriptions
The files generally contain mug
shots obtained from police,
physical descriptions, and a few
clippings from newspapers.
Conversations with University
administrators yesterday revealed
that most did not know the cards
were in existence until a few
weeks ago. The information came
to the attention of the
administration when they received
a letter in March from Marshall,
written after a discussion in the
SCLC. Pitzer replied this week.
Upon receipt of the letter, the
cards were impounded from the
Stanford police department and
placed in the temporary care of
Bruce Wiggins, manager of
University security. Pitzer's letter
says the file "in due course will be
destroyed."
However, Wiggins and Dan
DeYoung, director of University
public safety, both said that two
representatives of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department
looked through the file about two
weeks ago, after they had been
impounded.
Yesterday afternoon, Siena
said that to his knowledge no one
rxcept Marshall had looked at the

file since it was impounded. The
policy was clear, he said, that no
one was to look at them.
Deputy Perusal
Wiggins and DeYoung
understood the University policy
to be that anything the University
has is open to any
law-enforcement agency although
that agency cannot remove a file.
Therefore, they let the Sheriff's
department peruse the file for IV2
hours two weeks ago.
Wiggins, DeYoung and the
police were the only University
officials who admit to knowing
about the file. However, Bell said
the file was "no secret."
In the letter to Marshall, Pitzer
said: "I recognize no clear
justification for maintaining such
a file . . ."
The file is known to contain
the name of one student generally
associated with the
libertarian-conservative element
on campus, a Stanford
administrator (whose name
appeared in a Daily article and
was underlined), and a former
student associated with radicals
on campus.
The University let Marshall
look through the file last Friday
to verify the contents. He said
yesterday no real research was
done by police and that the file
consists of public record simply
put together.
However, Marshall said that
given the tendency of some
Congressional committees, there is
a great potential danger of guilt
by association if the information
were to get in the hands of such a
committee.
Bell said the files were started
in the spring of 1969 around the
SRI demonstrations. He said there
was nothing in the file that other
law enforcement agencies would
not already know.
The cards were contained in a
cardboard box which also had
newspaper clippings, full
newspapers, handouts from
various political meetings, and
other literature covering a broad
spectrum of political activity
jumbled together.

POLICEMAN MEETS INFORMANT— Stanford policeman James Newberry picked up the "police informant" in Stanford
ear no. 10 near Wilbur on Tuesday evening. Newberry took her to the Stanford police department to meet Santa Clara
Deputy Robert Schlice—her new contact.


"7" LAWYKR—William Kunstler drew a crowd of 1500 to White Plaza yesterday
noon, and urged students to carry out resistance up to the point of violent
revolution.
While pretending to be a police
informant on radical activities (see
related story), a Wilbur resident
discovered the existence of a small
card file on 50 to 150 radicals and
prominent campus figures. A few
of the subjects had no record of
illegal conduct and no apparent
contact with police.
The informant learned that the
files had been kept by the
Stanford police, but access to the
information had been granted to
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department.
According to several sources,
University officials -impounded
the file as soon as they heard
about it. However, unbeknownst
to many officials, access was
apparently granted again to
Sheriff's deputies after the records
had been impounded.

Yesterday President Pitzer
directed the file be placed in a
locked safe in the President's
office. He said access would be
allowed only upon express order
of the President or, in his absence,
the Acting President.
According to a letter Pitzer
sent to SCLC Chairman Hubert
Marshall, the file contains
information about students and a
few non-students. Some have been
arrested for criminal activity and
some are noted campus figures
with no contact with the police.
Most of the cards are on radicals.
University legal advisor Jim
Siena indicated yesterday
afternoon that a few of the cards
contained a record of the subjects
attendance at a political meeting.
Stanford Police Chief Thomas Bell
stated that such information only
pertained to certain meetings not
held on campus.
Descriptions
The files generally contain mug
shots obtained from police,
physical descriptions, and a few
clippings from newspapers.
Conversations with University
administrators yesterday revealed
that most did not know the cards
were in existence until a few
weeks ago. The information came
to the attention of the
administration when they received
a letter in March from Marshall,
written after a discussion in the
SCLC. Pitzer replied this week.
Upon receipt of the letter, the
cards were impounded from the
Stanford police department and
placed in the temporary care of
Bruce Wiggins, manager of
University security. Pitzer's letter
says the file "in due course will be
destroyed."
However, Wiggins and Dan
DeYoung, director of University
public safety, both said that two
representatives of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department
looked through the file about two
weeks ago, after they had been
impounded.
Yesterday afternoon, Siena
said that to his knowledge no one
rxcept Marshall had looked at the

file since it was impounded. The
policy was clear, he said, that no
one was to look at them.
Deputy Perusal
Wiggins and DeYoung
understood the University policy
to be that anything the University
has is open to any
law-enforcement agency although
that agency cannot remove a file.
Therefore, they let the Sheriff's
department peruse the file for IV2
hours two weeks ago.
Wiggins, DeYoung and the
police were the only University
officials who admit to knowing
about the file. However, Bell said
the file was "no secret."
In the letter to Marshall, Pitzer
said: "I recognize no clear
justification for maintaining such
a file . . ."
The file is known to contain
the name of one student generally
associated with the
libertarian-conservative element
on campus, a Stanford
administrator (whose name
appeared in a Daily article and
was underlined), and a former
student associated with radicals
on campus.
The University let Marshall
look through the file last Friday
to verify the contents. He said
yesterday no real research was
done by police and that the file
consists of public record simply
put together.
However, Marshall said that
given the tendency of some
Congressional committees, there is
a great potential danger of guilt
by association if the information
were to get in the hands of such a
committee.
Bell said the files were started
in the spring of 1969 around the
SRI demonstrations. He said there
was nothing in the file that other
law enforcement agencies would
not already know.
The cards were contained in a
cardboard box which also had
