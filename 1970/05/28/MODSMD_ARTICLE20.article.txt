# Horn And Lewis: Professors Poles Apart
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
Robert Horn and John Lewis are both political science
professors yet politically they are poles apart.
Horn, a college student during the Depression describes
himself as a "radical conservative." A dedicated
undergraduate teacher of public law, he supports President
Nixon's Vietnam and Cambodian war policy.
Lewis on the other hand was an adolescent during World
War II and a college student during the first years of the Cold
War. An Asian expert, he actively opposes the wars in
Vietnam and Cambodia.
Both professors were active in presenting their view on the
war during the recent student strike. Here we present their
personalities as well as their politics.
Horn
Paunchy and grayed at 53, Robert Horn senses
sardonically that the work! is passing him by—or at least that
he and the world don't see eye to eye.
A "country boy" in a university for metropolitans, a
teacher in a department of researchers, a conservative among
liberals, a traditionalist among behaviorist political scientists,
Horn jokes, "I'm sure if I had it all to do over again I would
be a gardener."
Some say he's gruff, another calls him "gentle"; some
think him witty, others sarcastic; some see him as an
inspiration, others as a "pompous ass." But few question his
scholarship and most envy his teaching ability.
Still, the personality of Robert Horn remains obscure to
students and many faculty. They see his confidence, laugh at
his witticisms, ask him for recommendations, and seek his
advice—but few think they understand him.
Hubert Marshall, a colleague who came to Stanford with
Horn 16 years ago, detects an embitterment in his bachelor
acquaintance. "He feels alienated more than many of our
faculty members," he says, "because he has been a good
teacher and ho does not think the university has recognized
this.
"And he is not a behaviorist and he feels some sense of
alienation because most professors in the department are.
This causes a degree of isolation. It also lends to a certain
amount of bitterness; and you just do not like to see a
colleague get bitter," he says.
C. Herman Pritehett, a Santa Barbara political science
professor and a colleague of Horn's when both taught at the
University of Chicago, describes his friend in a slightly
different light. "He is sort of a nineteenth century
character," he says.
"He enjoys good living and good conversation. And there
are many aspects of his personality that are very much
English. When he taught at your British campus he had an
immensely good time. I often think there is more in British
society that he likes than in American."
John Bull
Indeed, Horn looks like a less exaggerated version of
Punch's famous caricature of John Bull. A stubby five foot
seven, he walks with an arrow-straight back. Whenever he is
not lecturing there is a cigarette askew in his mouth, hanging
at an angle reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart's smokes.
But no college of physical characteristics gives much
insight into this complex man. Horn is hard to "get into."
At any point in a conversation with him, politics is only a
few sentences away. Ask him about his father and two

phrases later he is saying, "But politics always fascinated
me."
As for habits and activities outside academia, Horn says
"There isn't much else. I'm no athlete; I don't like indoor or
outside games. I do like gardening but I suppose that's
because I'm a country boy."
Throughout his career as an instructor Horn has taught by
Socratic pedagogy. "I push the student into an intellectual
corner," he says,"and I let him fight it out."
Lectures
In lectures he plows slowly through his notes, thinking for
a few moments and then sputtering out three or four
tightly-knit little sentences.
"Talk plain, precise English," ho admonishes "In modern
political science we talk about a 'political unit'; but that's
nothing more than a 'state,' is it?"
At the end of each class he pulls out a cigarette and waits
for the studenLs to come up to him with questions. They
cluster around this Socrates-in-a-suit and talk, often for a half
hour or more.
All of Horn's colleagues are quick to praise his teaching
skills. But beneath the shelter of confidential reports and in
private conversations they are critical of his lack of "research
productivity." For this reason he is one of the lowest-paid
full professors in the department.
That Horn resents this is unquestionable; but only hp can
judge how deeply he is embittered. Still, lie is outspoken in
his judgment of what a professor should do.
He says,"The question is what political science as a
discipline should do. You can say it has the function of
developing new knowledge on politics and government. Then'
you place vour emphasis on research and graduate training.
"And then there are people who I think have been
fighting a losing battle in recent years who would emphasize
teaching about government and politics- who feel that thcv
should give people who are college graduates and influential
in their community a knowledge to function wisely and
effectively in whatever capacity they are in.
"Now that tends to place more emphasis on the
undergraduate program. And that isn't the way American
universities have developed. And I think that is part of why
students are unhappy."
Just as Horn's approach to his profession differs from
most of his colleagues', so also do his politics. His views on
American intervention in Vietnam and Cambodia highlight
this difference.
Not So Big
"I just don't start out with the assumption that the
President of the United States is lying," he explains.
"Suppose that what the President said was the scope of the
operation in Cambodia is actually true, then I think some of
these people will be left high and dry. I don't think what is
happening there is that big."
Turning to the topic of campus violence Horn is
considerably harsher. Having always opposed the new
Stanford judicial charter, he suggests that presidential
suspensions are the only campus tools that can end
disturbances.
"We have a University administration that follows the
path of moderation and compromise. They say if they don't
they will have trouble. My answer to that is simple. Have
them look at what is happening."
"The New Left is a big tent with n lot of side shows," he
notes "but Ihe small groups of anarchists and nihilists within

In general, however, Horn thinks the Left is naive. And in
typical bluntness he suggests to them, "If you're determined
to be naive, you should not bo surprised when you are
disillusioned."
Low is
John Lewis' father was killed in World War 11, his best
Iriend in Korea. Now Lewis spends most of his long days
trying to argue Americans out of yet another war.
"My generation was a very funny one," the
39-year-old-Asian expert recalls. "It came right at the end of
World War 11. We were in high school and expected to fight
in the war. And there was a message in the war that we were
doing something great for building democracy. That gave
each of us a personal sense of duty, and I felt it particularly
acutely when my father was killed."
That sense of duty and social concern has always driven
Lewis to seek out the most controversial problems, educate
himself on them and then teach others what he has learned.
"John is a man who has a lot of social responsibility,"
notes colleague Gabriel Almond. "He operates under a great
tension and is drawn by civic as well as professional
responsibility."
So the tall, dark-haired professor packs his schedule full of
teach-ins, speeches, trips to Washington."He gets a
tremendous amount of work out of himself," Almond says.
"He works at a tremendous rate. I really think he should take
a rest."
Students confirm Almond's observation. One says, "I've
never seen anyone with so much nervous energy. He really
makes me nervous and guilty I'm not doing as much as he.
He looks out at you with those wide-open, chuckling eyes
and churns on through his lectures at a furious pace."
"If Lewis were demogogic, he'd be a real zealot," the
student adds.
Despite his ongoing sense of duty, however, Lewis has not
always been sure just what problems demanded his attention.
In the early cold war years this sense of duty led Lewis
into Russian studies. After 5 years he was fluent in the
language, but the world had changed.
"By that time," he remembers, "I increasingly had a sense
that the knowledge of China was more critical than of
Russia. They were seen as a special evil, and I committed
myself to studying them."
But Lewis' interest in Asia did not grow up full blown the
morning after the Chinese evolution. There were deeper
roots. After living with his aunt who had spent more than 10
years in China, Lewis received a scholarship to attend tiny
Deep Springs College on the California-Nevada border.
Sense of Duty
There, Lewis' feeling of duty was further nurtured.
"There was this intense feeling that we all wanted to help the
world; there was a kind of sense that you had this role to
play," Lewis recalls.
"But I left Deep Springs," he says,"and I decided to take
two years off to try to see how I could make a dent on the
world." During these years lie travelled in almost every state
working as a lecturer, journalist, and painter.
He ended up back in Los Angeles where he began auditing
courses on Russian studies at UCLA. In 1950 he took his
studies more seriously and enrolled in political science.
"Those were really mad years," he recalls. "They were the
McCarthy years. UCLA was then called the Little Bed School

House, and was seen as the locus of all subversive activities in
the area."
As editor of the NROTC paper Lewis wrote about "the
importance of not becoming too hysterical about
communism," and that made him controversial.
In 1953 he graduated Phi Beta Kappa, with highest
honors, and after a year as a graduate instructor he entered
(he Navy for a three year tour of duty, mostly in Asian
waters.
1 was "clearly the Navy's greatest flubup" he says.
Returning to UCLA he got his masters in 1958 and his
Ph.D. in 1962.
Countless fellowships, projects, professorships, and
consulting jobs followed. During the Kennedy
Administration Lewis was asked to study a group of secret
Chinese documents with other Asian experts "in line with
plans to make major changes in American policy toward
China in Ihe second Kennedy Administration."
Chinese Papers
Lewis recalls the experience: "We began working
weekends and summers like you do with these things, and it
became increasingly clear that the Chinese were not
aggressive, that they were moving to strengthen their
defenses and that they were very afraid of the U.S.
"There were arguments put forward in those papers by
members of the Communist leadership with which we could
agree. The documents confirmed a much more hopeful than
sinister view.
"But all of these efforts died with Kennedy. Johnson
disbanded the group and kept only a few as advisers. That's
one reason I'm a little sore at the Johnson Administration,"
he says trying to hide his bitterness.
When Lewis turns to subjects of Vietnam and Cambodia
the reasons for his disaffection are more apparent.
"Johnson's hardline advisers that justified our escalating
committment in Vietnam were factually wrong. Still
Presidents continue to be persuaded by their reasons up to
this day,"he says.
Lewis traces this faulty logic back to the conception of
deterrence theory. He describes how senior Rand
Corporation researcher Thomas Schelling expanded the
deterrence theory used to justify nuclear weapons escalation
into the compellenee theory used to justify escalation of
American involvement in Vietnam.
Compellenee was conceptualized into a model that could
not and cannot be penetrated by any knowledge or
information. It is complete in itself.
Lewis thinks that the American invasion of Cambodia
highlights the 1 bankruptcy of this concept.
"What we Asian scholars are finally left with," Lewis says,
"is the need to try to continue to persuade them they are
wrong."
Lewis thinks this kind of education can be effective in
moving Congressmen and governmental officials. Still, he
admits to often feeling pessimistic about his results.
1 here is always a sense of uselessness in this kind of
educational work when you are not effecting decisions.
11l ere is a sense that you have to get out and net. But
violence does not help because it does not link up to
anything that will lead to change.
"You do as much as you can. There are a lot of people in
my age group who are working to build a different type of
society. There is a bond of fellowship with the .students and
that gives me great hope."
