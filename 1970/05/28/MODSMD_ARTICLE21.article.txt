# Change Announced In Advising System
## 
### 
James L. Gibbs, Jr., Dean-elect
of Undergraduate Studies,
announced the first in a carefully
developed series of changes in the
undergraduate academic advising
system at Stanford.
The changes stem from
recommendations of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) and
are designed to help students to
take advantage of recent changes
in degree requirements.
The innovations include
integration of freshman advising
into the residences and house
programs, creation of an
Academic Information Center,
and changes in the freshman
orientation program.
In the residence-based
freshman advising program, a
group of faculty advisors
including at least one member
from each of the three basic
fields, humanities; social sciences;
and science, mathematics and
engineering . . . will be assigned to
work with each residence area
housing freshmen.
The faculty coordinator of
each advising group, often the
faculty resident, will work with
upperclass students, tutors,
resident assistants, sponsors and
other concerned persons to insure
that the freshmen receive the
necessary assistance to develop
their own educational programs.
While freshmen will be assigned

initially to a specific advisor, they
will be encouraged to use all of
the members of their advising
group as source of advice and
support.
Dean Gibbs said the
residence-based approach is
designed to strengthen the
relationship between the entering
freshman and his advisor. "With
less restrictive course
requirements," he noted, "faculty
advisors will be asked to view
their role less as dispensing course
information and more as helping
the freshmen to develop a
philosophical framework within
which to make specific decisions
about his academic and
intellectual life. The
advising-group approach means
that the freshman will have
available more faculty whom he
knows well and, hence, easy
access to a range ol 1 acuity views
about academic programs."
Many freshman seminar
teachers will be invited to serve as
advisors for freshmen enrolled in
their seminar. These faculty
members will also be members of
the residentially-oriented advising
groups. The Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Office
feels that because the seminar
instructors are already linked
intellectually to their students,
the parallel link as advisor and
advisee will be a natural and close
one.
