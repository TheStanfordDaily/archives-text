# Summer Research Seminar Groups
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
The Pacific Studies Center,
(PSC) a research collective
specializing in studies of United
States foreign and domestic
policies, is planning summer
research-seminar groups, to study
four main aspects of our society.
The collective, financed solely
by private contributions since its
inception last year, plans to hold a
meeting for people who will be in
the area over the summer, and
would be interested in doing
research in fields such as Ecology,
Rascism and Urban Reform,
Labor and American
Corporations, and U.S. Foreign
Policy. The organizational
meeting will take place tomorrow
at 3:1 5 in Tresidder 271.
Studies Published
The group, which publishes the
work of its members in a
newsletter entitled "Pacific
Research and World Empire
Telegram", has had its studies
published in Ramparts, Leviathan,
and Hard Times. Individual pieces
of research will be used in
forthcoming books.
According to leaders of the
group, PSC's purpose is to foster
analysis of basic issues, as well as
training people to do research in
these areas, the object being
education for the reader as well as
the researcher.
Current research plans include

studies of the rubber industry the
meat packing industry, and the
United Auto Workers. The role of
labor in our present economic
situation will be stressed.
PSC researched and published
the pamphlet "Operation Total
Victory", an analysis of President
Nixon's Indochina policies, which
was widely distributed at Stanford
last month.
Indochina Policy Semina
Bink Gareet and David Ransom
will lead a seminar this summer to
discuss these issues further.
Arrangements for this will also be
made at the Friday Meeting.
Past projects have included
several articles on ecology, articles
detailing problems of black labor
in the construction industry, and
the relationship of workers and
our society to such corporations
as Bank of America, General
Electric, Dow, General Motors,
and Pittsburgh Des-Moines Steel.
Studies of the International
Industrial Conference, held last
fall, and the Business Council,
which represents 100 of America's
largest corporations, have also
been produced.
Research on U.S. foreign
policy has covered the "Pacific
Rim Strategy", focusing on
general policy, overseas
investments, and counter
-insurgency operations. The
involvement of the U.S. in Latin
America has also been analysed.
