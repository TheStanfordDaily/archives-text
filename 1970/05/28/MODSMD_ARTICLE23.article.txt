# Quad Reviewed
## 
### THOMASD DAWSON 
Yearbooks are in danger of
losing their market. Designed to
appeal to fraternity men, row
dollies and jocks, they suffer
when the concerns of many
students turn to more worldly
affairs like Cambodia and the
draft. Somehow a book full of
pictures of the football team and
rush parties seems terrible
irrelevant.
This year's Stanford Quad has
tried to change. Gone is the
emphasis on frat life. In are essays
by campus personalities on issues
like ROTC and overseas campuses.
The Quad editors obviously were
trying to combine old and new in
an attempt to make the yearbook
more appealing to students.

The marriage is an uneasy one.
Structurally The Quad has not
changed much. The book still is
divided into the traditional
sections on sports, traditional
activities, academics and
residences. Symptomatic of the
death of the old-style year-book is
the fact that a number of
residences chose not to have pages
in The Quad.
The section on issues facing the
campus is generally well-done.
Articles by Michael Sweeney on
ROTC, Harvey Hukari on the
ASSU and Jim Perloff on
"Overseas Mismanagement" to
just name a few, do give the
reader a good idea of what the
issues were at Stanford this year.
If the purpose of the yearbook
is 10 provide a memory of what

"Stanford" was really like, a
memory to be shared with one's
friends in twenty years, then this
product comes closer than any in
recent years. After a brief fight
with their censor-printer the
editors even introduced four-letter
words to their audience.
Many, however, see the
yearbook as also a photographic
production. Here the Quad seems
this year to have departed a little
for its traditional excellence. In
many cases there is little
coordination between the articles
and pictures on the same page.
More and better color pictures
would have been welcome. Some
pictures seem terribly out of
focus.
To return to the written
content, some of the articles by
faculty members are excellent,
including another gem from Philip
Zimbardo's endless string of fairy
tales. Another high spot is an
article by John Coghlan on the
care and feeding of athletes at
Stanford.
The sports section has many
excellent action shots, but
intramurals curiously receive only
the briefest mention. Since several
thousand Stanford students are
active in this program more
coverage would have been
warranted.
The concern with issues is
present in almost every section.
Articles on the Stanford residence
system, women's liberation and
the Moratorium introduce the
section on seniors and residences.
The Quad is definitely still in a
transition stage. Having lost its
traditional market, it is hunting
for a new one. Many campuses
have stopped publishing
yearbooks. The Stanford Quad
wants to publish, not perish. They
still have some way to go, but the
odds seem to be with them.
If you want something to
remember Stanford by, The Quad
this year is a good choice, even if
rather expensive at $9.50.

just name a few, do give the
reader a good idea of what the
issues were at Stanford this year.
If the purpose of the yearbook
is 10 provide a memory of what

"Stanford" was really like, a
memory to be shared with one's
friends in twenty years, then this
product comes closer than any in
recent years. After a brief fight
with their censor-printer the
editors even introduced four-letter
words to their audience.
Many, however, see the
yearbook as also a photographic
production. Here the Quad seems
this year to have departed a little
for its traditional excellence. In
many cases there is little
coordination between the articles
and pictures on the same page.
More and better color pictures
would have been welcome. Some
pictures seem terribly out of
focus.
To return to the written
content, some of the articles by
faculty members are excellent,
including another gem from Philip
Zimbardo's endless string of fairy
tales. Another high spot is an
article by John Coghlan on the
care and feeding of athletes at
Stanford.
The sports section has many
excellent action shots, but
intramurals curiously receive only
the briefest mention. Since several
thousand Stanford students are
active in this program more
coverage would have been
warranted.
The concern with issues is
present in almost every section.
Articles on the Stanford residence
system, women's liberation and
the Moratorium introduce the
section on seniors and residences.
The Quad is definitely still in a
transition stage. Having lost its
traditional market, it is hunting
for a new one. Many campuses
have stopped publishing
yearbooks. The Stanford Quad
wants to publish, not perish. They
still have some way to go, but the
odds seem to be with them.
If you want something to
remember Stanford by, The Quad
this year is a good choice, even if
rather expensive at $9.50.
Yearbooks are in danger of
losing their market. Designed to
appeal to fraternity men, row
dollies and jocks, they suffer
when the concerns of many
students turn to more worldly
affairs like Cambodia and the
draft. Somehow a book full of
pictures of the football team and
rush parties seems terrible
irrelevant.
This year's Stanford Quad has
tried to change. Gone is the
emphasis on frat life. In are essays
by campus personalities on issues
like ROTC and overseas campuses.
The Quad editors obviously were
trying to combine old and new in
an attempt to make the yearbook
more appealing to students.

The marriage is an uneasy one.
Structurally The Quad has not
changed much. The book still is
divided into the traditional
sections on sports, traditional
activities, academics and
residences. Symptomatic of the
death of the old-style year-book is
the fact that a number of
residences chose not to have pages
in The Quad.
The section on issues facing the
campus is generally well-done.
Articles by Michael Sweeney on
ROTC, Harvey Hukari on the
ASSU and Jim Perloff on
"Overseas Mismanagement" to
just name a few, do give the
reader a good idea of what the
issues were at Stanford this year.
