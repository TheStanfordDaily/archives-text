# Senior Class Day: Dissent Discussion
## 
### 
An open-mike discussion on
"Dissent in the University" will
replace the traditional speeches on
Senior Class Day June 13,
according to class president Kelly
Dixon.
Students of the right, middle,
and left, faculty and
administrators will form a panel
to field questions from parents on
protest, the war, and the
university.
"The hardest thing for many
parents is to find out what is
happening in the university. This
format will permit them to see the
university from the university's
perspective," stated Dixon.
Senior Class Day will begin
Saturday morning with a tour of
SLAC, followed by a luncheon for
seniors and their parents at
Bowman Alumni House. After the

panel discussion, and the laying of
the class plaque on the Quad,
there will be a reception at
President Pitzer's House.
