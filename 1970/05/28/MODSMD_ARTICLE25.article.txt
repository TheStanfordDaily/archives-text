# Stanford Will Stop Paying In-hospital Doctors' Fees
## 
### 
A change in student
hospitalization insurance coverage
was announced Tuesday by Dr.
James B. McClenahan, Director of
Cowell Student Health Center,
and Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley.
In-hospital physicians' fees,
heretofore provided as part of the
Student Health Service program,
will no longer be covered. Last
year, a supplemental insurance
policy, at $48 a year, was made
available to students for hospital
room-and-board costs. The new
policy, through Blue Cross,
provides 100% in-hospital
physician and surgeon fees as well
as room-and-board coverage. The
cost is $50 a year, and covers
students away from campus as
well as on-campus.
The new policy includes
optional dependent coverage, with

a $25 annual deductible (rather
than $25 each illness), plus 80
percent co-insurance. Major
medical benefits up to $20,000,
compared to the present $5000
maximum, are also included.
The University Committee on
Hospitalization Insurance, which
included four students, reviewed
ph.ns submitted by 1 1 companies
and recommended the change in
coverage and*' adoption of the
Blue Cross program.
When the hospitalization
policy was introduced last year
nearly 4000 students purchased
the supplemental coverage.
Approximately 5000 to 6000
other students indicated they had
family or other coverage.
The Cowell Student Health
Service will continue to provide
out-patient and infirmary care
which, Dr. McClenahan said,
forms the bulk of student health

care, and is provided by the
University.
"The new plan provides more
complete coverage for essentially
the same cost, and should
eliminate duplicate coverage for
students with other
hospitalization insurance," Dr.
McClenahan said. "In-hospital
costs are nign in tnis area to
$100/day), and we strongly urge
students to take this Blue Cross
plan unless they definitely have
adequate family or other
hospitalization coverage."
