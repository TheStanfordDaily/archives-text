# New Freshman Class Admitted
## 
### 
The 1971 freshman clas has
been formed, at least on paper. It
was born through a painful and
often frustrating process shared
by both the applicants and the
admission's office.
It was the second class to be
admitted after the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
report on admissions had been
released. The recommendations in
that ieport have yet to be
implemented.
Also, it was the first class to be
admitted under the direction of
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, who thinks that "the
university situation may be
anithetical to the kinds of
knowledge and structure a
creative person needs."
Data is not available about the
exact nature of next year's class as
it is expected that about one-third
of all those accepted will go
elsewhere. This is a normal rate
and it is unclear if this year's
unrest may accelerate it.
Hargadon, however, says that
"rejections are running about
normal."
If the 1974 class turns out as
planned, there will be more
females, more blacks many more
c hi c a no s, and more
underprivileged students at
Stanford next year than this. A
class size of 1400 is expected ■
900 men and 500 women. This
campares to this year's entering
class of 950 men and 4 50 women.
Hopefully, there will be more
diversity, a prime concern of the
SES report. Hargadon feels that
"we've done our job if we get
diversity." But just what diversity
means is unclear.
The SES report criticized
Stanford for setting as admission
standards criteria which tended to
insure a homogeneous student
body. Students had similar
cultural backgrounds, similar
educational experiences, similar
families, and similar
extracurricular interests. By

emphasizing these similarities,
Stanford, and many other
universities, was forcing high
school students to compete with
each other in a limited number of
fields. This further reduced the
diversity of the applicant pool.
Hargadon is aware of these
problems and critical of past
University procedures. "Do we
really know,"he asks, "if these
people with 'diverse' backgrounds
really rub off onto each other; We
have no idea of the proper mix of
students."
He further asks if most
applicants should really be
considering college at this time.
"This stage of life is all being
acted out in the wrong place. The
university may not be the right
place to develop responsibility.
Students always say "I need some
time to think'but to think about
what?"
Hargadon believes that most
students "need a reference point
to appreciate where they are at."
To achieve this, Stanford may be
setting up a delayed admissions
program, whereby students will be
accepted unprovisionally for some
time in the future, and so be free
to do what they want for a few
years before entering college.
Hargadon feels most should be
out working.
The process by which
applicants are reviewed is itself
under review. The SES report
recommended four types of
competitions: random, academic,
special talent, and "all around."
Ten percent of All students, after
meeting minimum standards,
would be admitted on a random
basis. In part, this group would be
compared to others to see if there
would be a difference in
achievement between this and
select groups.
Fifty percent of students would
be admitted on tfhe basis of their
academic record—grade point and
College Board scores. Twenty
percent could admitted because

of outstanding talents in the arts,
sciences, public affairs, and
athletics. The final 20% would
come from an "all-round"
group—those who are not truly
outstanding in any one field but
who have a broad range of
valuable experience.
But the SES admissions report
has been locked up in a
committee of the Academic
Senate and few of its
recommendations have been
implemented. The current
admissions procedure is a complex
and often subjective affair, with

the applicant pool of
approximately 10,000 divided
into several groups bases on
predicted grade point average
(derived from college boards and
high school GPA), letters of
recommendation, interviews,
outstanding characteristics, and
special needs of the university.
These special needs have often
been arbitrary and are more often
criticized. Admission can be
influenced by Stanford's need for
athletes, the fact that one parent
is an alumnus, and more recently,

by a students race and
socio-economic background. »
Financial needs of the student •»
are not taken into consideration
when his application is being
reviewed—in fact, there is no
indication of his need on the
form. Only after a student has
been accepted is his financial
statement and requests inspected.
While this creates problems of .
funding, both for the University
and the student, it is seen as the
only fair way to insure that it
won't be just the wealthy
applicant who is accepted.
