# Democratic Chairman
## Boas Meets Students 
### CATHY COOPER 
For an afternoon, students and
the Establishment shared their
uncertainty and frustration about
the efficacy of the party system.
And, the Establishment, in the
person of Roger Boas, did more
listening, real listening, than
talking when he met informally
with a small group of Stanford
and Santa Cruz students.
The theme of the students was
that they sought an ideological
center of gravity and rejected
both political parties because of
their lack of ideology. They said
they could be drawn into the
political process by candidates
willing to go out on thy line, and
by issue-oriented rather than
party-oriented campaigning.
Leo Basile, Stanford BSU
chairman told Boas that the
biggest problem was that
"politicians weren't leading; they
were afraid to step out of the
herd. I am working for
Congressman (Pete) McCloskey a
Republican, because he has been
in the lead on important issues."
Noting that students have been
written off by political parties in
many countries, Boas asked the
group how alienated students are

from this system. One Santa Cruz
student replied that college
students are not being drawn into
the existing institutions.
Ben Page, an instructor in
political science and coordinator
for the Indochina Political Action
Group, queried Boas, "How can
you expect anyone to get excited
about a party whose last two
leaders were Lyndon Johnson and
Hubert Humphrey?"
Many of the participants in the
low-keyed discussion
recommended to Boas that the
way for the Democratic party to
establish any kind of footing with
youth in the universities was to
openly admit the political
mistakes of the past, chiefly
Vietnam, and to approach the
electorate with "your politics out
in front, out in the open."
Both student delegations
admitted that the bulk of the
student body was apolitical.
"Even in the week following the
move into Cambodia, much of
what passed for political activity
was merely liberals venting their
frustrations," offered one young
man. "I don't know if anyone has
any political solutions."
Pointing out the difficulty of

reform when the party must win
elections, Boas solicited the
group's response to the suggestion
of the Washington Institute for
Political Action which
recommended that the
Democratic Party opt out of the
electoral process for about 12
years and devote the time to
refreshing itself and addressing
itself to institutional change,
"When you contest election you
light to win and you tell people
what they want to hear," the state
chairman noted. • t - / ,' ■*
Pressed for specific
recommendations to the state
party the students suggested that
the Congressional seniority system
be abolished, that the California
Congressional delegation develop
cohesion and back the
Reigle-McCloskey amendment
(the House version of
Hatfield-McGovern amendment to
the Military Appropriation Bill),
and that the party repudiate LBJ
and Chicago.
Boas told the group that he
was "very, very pesimistic about
the state of the nation. Its
institutions are squeaking
someone has to tell the country..
They seem to be more willing to
listen to you than to me."
