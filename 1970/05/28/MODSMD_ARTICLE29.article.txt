# Campuses In Trouble

Many faculty, students and even
administrators have criticized this kind of
leadership. In fact prominant faculty and
administrators maintain privately that Pitzer is
causing a leadership vacuum.
Conservatives want to see stronger stands
against demonstrators. Liberals and radicals
criticize Pitzer's wishy-washy liberalism. And,
those who do not criticize him on political issues
condemn his undynamic leadership style.
Pitzer has steered a very pragmatic course
through his two years here. He has let himself be
blown with the political breezes. At times that
has seemed good because he has proven flexible,
but at other times his stands have appeared
chaotic, willy-nilly.
Still it is too easy to criticize a man in an
office as difficult as his. The President of the
University today is in a strange position. On the
one hand, because of the politization of the
University he is forced to become a politician;
while on the other hand, as the head of an
academic institution he has some responsibility
to provide idealistic, moral leadership. This dual
role must make college presidents feel slightly
schizophrenic.

Colleges throughout America have been
compelled by students to become increasingly
political. And in this highly politicized
atmosphere University administrators have
attempted to maintain a traditional ideal tit a
neutral collection of scholars. In this way they
have lost.some control of their schools.
Radicals have become proto-revolutionaries
capable of striking quickly at the Weak
University with "mobile militant" raids. Ane(
liberal radicals have become capable of
controlling mass movements with the power to
close the University during severe crises like those
which resulted from the Cambodian invasion.
THE STUDENT MOVEMENT operating on'
the general assumption that morals should be put
higher than laws, has no set boundaries of
permissable action. It is in the process of
searching for justifiable limits of protest; and in
this search it continues to move gradually toward
more militant action. _ , ( ( j
To many students the need to put an end tci'
the war and racism is a more compelling goal
than preserving the University. As students
become more frustrated at being unable to attain
these goals, tactics will become more violent and
the University will be held even less sacred.
