# Court, Psychiatric Records Possible Sponsor Criteria
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Dean of Students Peter
Bu Ike ley has apparently added
two new criteria to the
qualifications for sponsors:
judicial records and emotional
stability.
Sources maintain that Bulkeley
removed several names from the
list of sponsors chosen for next
year by the sponsor selection
committee. These sources also
suggest that Bulkeley attempted
to obtain confidential psychiatric

information from Cowell Student
Health Center.
Sources on the C6well stiff say
Bulkeley's alleged request Was
rejected by the staff, which
unanimously decided that release
of those records Would be a
breach of professional ethics.
Bulkeley denies requesting any
psychiatric retards He told the
Daily that H 6 ' did discuss
psychiatric matters with the held
of the psychiatric division of
Cowell, David Dorosin. According

to Bulkeley, Dorosin told t)im
that -one could get as' good a
psychiatric picture front} an
interview as from medical records.
On Tuesday, May 26, John
Shoch, who was named as a
sponsor by the sponsor selection
committee, Yale Braunstein, ( >. a
member of the Student Conduct
Legislative 'â–  Council; Roger
Boesche, , head sponsor for
1960-70; and two other people
met with Bulkeley to discuss
Bulkeley's reasons for not hiring
Shoch as a sponsor for next year.
'Can't Appoint'
i Bulkelfey told Shoch, "I simply
(ian't appoint to a position of
counselling and advisihg as an
employee of the University, a
student who is being sued by the
University."
Bulkeley cited what he
considered a recurrent pattern of
violation of University policy: a
Stanford Judicial Council
conviction from the Encina
demonstration of May 1, 1969;
the present show-cause hearings
for alleged violation this spring of
the injunction obtained by the
University; and possible future
SJC charges with regard to this
spring's demonstrations.
Bulkeley conceded there were
no judicial sanctions which would
prevent Shoch from holding a
position on the residence staff,
but he took personal
responsibility for the decision not
to appoint Shoch, although there
had been consultations on this
general matter with the
President's office.
Bulkeley maintained
throughout the meeting that
discretionary power had to remain
in his hands and stated that in
every situation he had to base his
decision on the facts as he knew
them.
Bulkeley said that any arrest
of, or charges against any
applicant for a residence staff
position would call the applicant
into question. This would apply
to arrest even with a subsequent
acquittal or dropping of the
charges.
In the course of the meeting
Bulkeley also Said that he /'will
not be bound" by a decision made
last year , in which the
administration told the 'head
sponsors that no ope would be
denied a sponsor position for an
arrest ftir Something done off
'
