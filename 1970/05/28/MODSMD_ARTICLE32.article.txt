# Girard Vice-Chairman Dem Party Reform
## 
### 
Professor Robert Girard has
been appointed to serve as vice
chairman of the recently created
Democratic Party Reform
Commission. Â»
Democratic State Party
Chairman Roger Boas established
the commission and said that,
"because so many legal issues are
involved, we have picked
Professor Girard, one of the top
legal minds in the United States."
According to Boas, the
commission will study and make
recommendations for changes in
the methods of selection of
delegates to the national
convention and reform of party
structure and practices within the
state. It will be divided into
number of committees, and will
hold public hearings.
Girard will coordinate the
efforts of the Commission.
"Members and chairman of the
various committees will be
announced shortly," he said. "The
Commission will consider changes
in campaign and party financing,
including public financing
(possibly with private allocation
of public funds), reforms in the
method of selecting party officials
ind in the organization and
functions of the Party, and
liberalization of voter
qualifications, particularly
reduction of age, residence and

registration requirements.
The objective is to develop and
recommend significant, practical
improvements in the political
process in an effort to increase
interested citizen participation
and to make government more
responsive to important public
needs . and desires. In such a
difficult undertaking, the
Commission is obviously going to
need a lot of thoughtful
assistance."
