# Josef Krips Departing
## Honored Maestro In Final Concert 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Josef Krips is one part Mozart
sonata, one part Beethoven's
Ninth, and one part Avant-garde
experiment. He is open, honest,
dedicated—and most of all,
optimistic.
Josef Krips has been Maestro of
the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra for seven years, years in
which attendance became
respectable, the orchestra became
known, and the community
became responsive. Already one
of the foremost conductors in the
world when he arrived in San
Francisco, Maestro Krips has
added to his laurels by his
numerous guest appearances with
major orchestras, his leadership of
the Vienna Opera, and the
receiving of innumerable medals
and citations, as well as his
development of our Symphony.
Maestro Krips may be of the
Old World, but he is definitely not
stodgy. Of the 210 works he has
led here in San Francisco over
seven years, 91 have been by
twentieth century composers. But

are these new works the creative
equals of Beethoven and Mozart?
"No, no, 1 doubt it,"he averred.
"Who will be remembered in a
hundred years" We cannot say, we
will have to wait and see. Even
Schubert, you know, was never
respected in his time. But if I read
200 new scores, and one of them
is worthwhile, then it was worth
the other 1 99."
Final Concerts
Still, the name of Josef Krips is
usually identified with Bruckner
and Bt ■ethoven, so it was
appropriate that his final season
here should have been the
Beethoven Bicentennial Year,
celebrated by the performance of
all the Master's best-known
concert works: all nine
symphonies, all . five piano
concertos, the violin concerto,
and four overtures. And after
conducting the Ninth Symphony
for at least the 100 th time,
Maestro Krips looks on it as
freshly as the first time he led it.
"Every night is for me the
opening night" Maestro Krips
asserted. "We must always work
for perfection, even if we know
that we will only do 40 or 50
percent." He drives his orchestras
to do their very best at all times,
and is perturbed at interruptions
due to schedules. "Too much
business," he sighs.
The Maestro is an autocrat with
his musicians. "An orchestra must
be an aristocracy, not a
democracy,"' 1 he affirmed. "The
orchestra must play like one
instrument, so if each musician
does as he wants, what do you
have?"
Stanford Commended
Maestro Krips has had a myriad
of memorable experiences here.
But the one which stood out in
his mind as the finest concert was
the Missa Solemn is of three years
ago, in which the Orchestra was
joined by Dr. Harold Schmidt's
Stanford Choir and Chorus. "Such
a wonderful group of young
people, I love to work with
them," Maestro Krips beamed,
also remebering the superb Verdi
Requiem done by the Stanford
vocalists. "Yes, they are talented
and mature singers." Having
played such a large part in
Maestro Krips' concerts over the
last seven years, it is appropriate
that the final concerts of this
season feature the Stanford group
in the Beethoven "Ninth
Symphony."
The message of that work is the
brotherhood of all men, a theme
deeply felt by Beethoven. It is
also a feeling profoundly held by
Josef Krips, a man of deep faith.
Music to him a gift from God,
and should be so respected; it can
be an uplifting experience without
equal. "A man who appreciates a

Schubert symphony cannot be a
killer," he affirmed, and went on
to express dismay and regret at
the turmoil besetting our country.
"If they could only realize how
much music has to offer" he
pleaded. "But not this Rock and
Roll —it is not the same thing."
Young In Mind
In an effort to get young
people interested in concert
music, the Symphony under
Maestro Krips' direction has
sponsored an extensive youth
program, and has offered to
students season tickets at reduced
rates. "But they must pay
something," Maestro Krips made
clear. "Do you know why? It is
because when a man gives twenty
dollars or one dollar to the
Symphony, it is no longer THE
orchestra and THE conductor, it
is OUR orchestra and OUR
conductor." This is why he balks
at the proposal of government
sponsorship of symphonic groups.
He would, however, like to see
grants given to allow children to
attend the Symphony. "But even
if they only pay ten cents, that is
important."
It is this community support of
concert music that Maestro Krips
would like to see develop. "In
Europe," he explained, "each
town of maybe 50,000
inhabitants has their opera house.

They have -10, maybe 50 players
in the orhcestra, and they use the
younger singers in the opera. But
here, people won't come to the
opera unless there is a star. And
every city cannot afford that."
Elaborating on the plight of
American singers, he pointed to
his own Vienna Opera. "We have
five excellent tenors there. Four
are Americans, and one is
Canadian, which is almost
American." Decrying this
situation, he said "If all those
American singers had to leave
Europe and return home, they
would starve and the Opera
Houses would have to close."
Future Musicians
Young people, as audience as
well as musician, have long been
an important part of Maestro
Krips' life.
"If people only want to hear a
Serkin or a Rubenstein, what
happens when - they are gone?"
Maestro Krips demanded,
justifying his scheduling of so
many young soloists. "It is
experience that makes a soloist
great, not the technique. Pianists
once had to play so many notes as
fast as they could to be good, but
it is the feeling that really makes
the music great. Andre Watts will
be the top one of the pianists who
were here; sure he is young, but
how else will he get experience?

Even from the Wednesday concert
to Saturday there was a great
improvement in the
performance."
Ne\l Year for Maestro
Next year, Maestro Krips may
earn a nomination to the
Million-Mile Club. He has guest
appearances scheduled all over
Europe and America, as well as
recording sessions in London, the
regular Vienna Opera season, and
a month back on the podium in
San Francisco. "Berlin to London,
then back to Berlin for a week,
then to Vienna, then to
Metropolitan in New York, then
back to Vienna, then . . . then two
weeks of vacation for us,
then .. . and then the year is
done." Would he rather settle
again as Music Director of a
symphony? "No, not again. Too
many problems, with unions and
everything." Maestro Krips resents
the intrusion into production of
music of anything extraneous, be
it power, people or money.
Maestro Krips is a very young
and dynamic 68 year old, and will
next year observe his 50th year as
a conductor. He had a bit of
advice for young people interested
in conducting or in becoming
musicians. "Learn to play the
piano, and learn to love music."
His love of music has made
Josef Krips a truly great man.

respected in his time. But if I read
200 new scores, and one of them
is worthwhile, then it was worth
the other 1 99."
Final Concerts
Still, the name of Josef Krips is
usually identified with Bruckner
and Bt ■ethoven, so it was
appropriate that his final season
here should have been the
Beethoven Bicentennial Year,
celebrated by the performance of
all the Master's best-known
concert works: all nine
symphonies, all . five piano
concertos, the violin concerto,
and four overtures. And after
conducting the Ninth Symphony
for at least the 100 th time,
Maestro Krips looks on it as
freshly as the first time he led it.
"Every night is for me the
opening night" Maestro Krips
asserted. "We must always work
for perfection, even if we know
that we will only do 40 or 50
percent." He drives his orchestras
to do their very best at all times,
and is perturbed at interruptions
due to schedules. "Too much
business," he sighs.
The Maestro is an autocrat with
his musicians. "An orchestra must
be an aristocracy, not a
democracy,"' 1 he affirmed. "The
orchestra must play like one
instrument, so if each musician
does as he wants, what do you
have?"
Stanford Commended
Maestro Krips has had a myriad
of memorable experiences here.
But the one which stood out in
his mind as the finest concert was
the Missa Solemn is of three years
ago, in which the Orchestra was
joined by Dr. Harold Schmidt's
Stanford Choir and Chorus. "Such
a wonderful group of young
people, I love to work with
them," Maestro Krips beamed,
also remebering the superb Verdi
Requiem done by the Stanford
vocalists. "Yes, they are talented
and mature singers." Having
played such a large part in
Maestro Krips' concerts over the
last seven years, it is appropriate
that the final concerts of this
season feature the Stanford group
in the Beethoven "Ninth
Symphony."
The message of that work is the
brotherhood of all men, a theme
deeply felt by Beethoven. It is
also a feeling profoundly held by
Josef Krips, a man of deep faith.
Music to him a gift from God,
and should be so respected; it can
be an uplifting experience without
equal. "A man who appreciates a

Schubert symphony cannot be a
killer," he affirmed, and went on
to express dismay and regret at
the turmoil besetting our country.
"If they could only realize how
much music has to offer" he
pleaded. "But not this Rock and
Roll —it is not the same thing."
Young In Mind
In an effort to get young
people interested in concert
music, the Symphony under
Maestro Krips' direction has
sponsored an extensive youth
program, and has offered to
students season tickets at reduced
rates. "But they must pay
something," Maestro Krips made
clear. "Do you know why? It is
because when a man gives twenty
dollars or one dollar to the
Symphony, it is no longer THE
orchestra and THE conductor, it
is OUR orchestra and OUR
conductor." This is why he balks
at the proposal of government
sponsorship of symphonic groups.
He would, however, like to see
grants given to allow children to
attend the Symphony. "But even
if they only pay ten cents, that is
important."
It is this community support of
concert music that Maestro Krips
would like to see develop. "In
Europe," he explained, "each
town of maybe 50,000
inhabitants has their opera house.

They have -10, maybe 50 players
in the orhcestra, and they use the
younger singers in the opera. But
here, people won't come to the
opera unless there is a star. And
every city cannot afford that."
Elaborating on the plight of
American singers, he pointed to
his own Vienna Opera. "We have
five excellent tenors there. Four
are Americans, and one is
Canadian, which is almost
American." Decrying this
situation, he said "If all those
American singers had to leave
Europe and return home, they
would starve and the Opera
Houses would have to close."
Future Musicians
Young people, as audience as
well as musician, have long been
an important part of Maestro
Krips' life.
"If people only want to hear a
Serkin or a Rubenstein, what
happens when - they are gone?"
Maestro Krips demanded,
justifying his scheduling of so
many young soloists. "It is
experience that makes a soloist
great, not the technique. Pianists
once had to play so many notes as
fast as they could to be good, but
it is the feeling that really makes
the music great. Andre Watts will
be the top one of the pianists who
were here; sure he is young, but
how else will he get experience?

Even from the Wednesday concert
to Saturday there was a great
improvement in the
performance."
Ne\l Year for Maestro
Next year, Maestro Krips may
earn a nomination to the
Million-Mile Club. He has guest
appearances scheduled all over
Europe and America, as well as
recording sessions in London, the
regular Vienna Opera season, and
a month back on the podium in
San Francisco. "Berlin to London,
then back to Berlin for a week,
then to Vienna, then to
Metropolitan in New York, then
back to Vienna, then . . . then two
weeks of vacation for us,
then .. . and then the year is
done." Would he rather settle
again as Music Director of a
symphony? "No, not again. Too
many problems, with unions and
everything." Maestro Krips resents
the intrusion into production of
music of anything extraneous, be
it power, people or money.
Maestro Krips is a very young
and dynamic 68 year old, and will
next year observe his 50th year as
a conductor. He had a bit of
advice for young people interested
in conducting or in becoming
musicians. "Learn to play the
piano, and learn to love music."
His love of music has made
Josef Krips a truly great man.


J(n h'l I. MOISK — Macslro Josef krips leads the San Krancisco S\inphom in il> finale ol' the season and his lasl appearance
as Music Director, the Ninth Symphony o! Beethoven.
Josef Krips is one part Mozart
sonata, one part Beethoven's
Ninth, and one part Avant-garde
experiment. He is open, honest,
dedicated—and most of all,
optimistic.
Josef Krips has been Maestro of
the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra for seven years, years in
which attendance became
respectable, the orchestra became
known, and the community
became responsive. Already one
of the foremost conductors in the
world when he arrived in San
Francisco, Maestro Krips has
added to his laurels by his
numerous guest appearances with
major orchestras, his leadership of
the Vienna Opera, and the
receiving of innumerable medals
and citations, as well as his
development of our Symphony.
Maestro Krips may be of the
Old World, but he is definitely not
stodgy. Of the 210 works he has
led here in San Francisco over
seven years, 91 have been by
twentieth century composers. But

are these new works the creative
equals of Beethoven and Mozart?
"No, no, 1 doubt it,"he averred.
"Who will be remembered in a
hundred years" We cannot say, we
will have to wait and see. Even
Schubert, you know, was never
respected in his time. But if I read

orchestra must play like one
instrument, so if each musician
does as he wants, what do you
have?"
Stanford Commended
Maestro Krips has had a myriad
of memorable experiences here.
But the one which stood out in
his mind as the finest concert was
the Missa Solemn is of three years
ago, in which the Orchestra was
joined by Dr. Harold Schmidt's
Stanford Choir and Chorus. "Such
a wonderful group of young
people, I love to work with
them," Maestro Krips beamed,
also remebering the superb Verdi
Requiem done by the Stanford
vocalists. "Yes, they are talented
and mature singers." Having
played such a large part in
Maestro Krips' concerts over the
last seven years, it is appropriate
that the final concerts of this
season feature the Stanford group
in the Beethoven "Ninth
Symphony."
The message of that work is the
brotherhood of all men, a theme
deeply felt by Beethoven. It is
also a feeling profoundly held by
Josef Krips, a man of deep faith.
Music to him a gift from God,
and should be so respected; it can
be an uplifting experience without
equal. "A man who appreciates a

Schubert symphony cannot be a
killer," he affirmed, and went on
to express dismay and regret at
the turmoil besetting our country.
"If they could only realize how
much music has to offer" he
pleaded. "But not this Rock and
Roll —it is not the same thing."
Young In Mind
In an effort to get young
people interested in concert
music, the Symphony under
Maestro Krips' direction has
sponsored an extensive youth
program, and has offered to
students season tickets at reduced
rates. "But they must pay
something," Maestro Krips made
clear. "Do you know why? It is
because when a man gives twenty
dollars or one dollar to the
Symphony, it is no longer THE
orchestra and THE conductor, it
is OUR orchestra and OUR
conductor." This is why he balks
at the proposal of government
sponsorship of symphonic groups.
He would, however, like to see
grants given to allow children to
attend the Symphony. "But even
if they only pay ten cents, that is
important."
It is this community support of
concert music that Maestro Krips
would like to see develop. "In
Europe," he explained, "each
town of maybe 50,000
inhabitants has their opera house.

They have -10, maybe 50 players
in the orhcestra, and they use the
younger singers in the opera. But
here, people won't come to the
opera unless there is a star. And
every city cannot afford that."
Elaborating on the plight of
American singers, he pointed to
his own Vienna Opera. "We have
five excellent tenors there. Four
are Americans, and one is
Canadian, which is almost
American." Decrying this
situation, he said "If all those
American singers had to leave
Europe and return home, they
would starve and the Opera
Houses would have to close."
Future Musicians
Young people, as audience as
well as musician, have long been
an important part of Maestro
Krips' life.
"If people only want to hear a
Serkin or a Rubenstein, what
happens when - they are gone?"
Maestro Krips demanded,
justifying his scheduling of so
many young soloists. "It is
experience that makes a soloist
great, not the technique. Pianists
once had to play so many notes as
fast as they could to be good, but
it is the feeling that really makes
the music great. Andre Watts will
be the top one of the pianists who
were here; sure he is young, but
how else will he get experience?

Even from the Wednesday concert
to Saturday there was a great
improvement in the
performance."
Ne\l Year for Maestro
Next year, Maestro Krips may
earn a nomination to the
Million-Mile Club. He has guest
appearances scheduled all over
Europe and America, as well as
recording sessions in London, the
regular Vienna Opera season, and
a month back on the podium in
San Francisco. "Berlin to London,
then back to Berlin for a week,
then to Vienna, then to
Metropolitan in New York, then
back to Vienna, then . . . then two
weeks of vacation for us,
then .. . and then the year is
done." Would he rather settle
again as Music Director of a
symphony? "No, not again. Too
many problems, with unions and
everything." Maestro Krips resents
the intrusion into production of
music of anything extraneous, be
it power, people or money.
Maestro Krips is a very young
and dynamic 68 year old, and will
next year observe his 50th year as
a conductor. He had a bit of
advice for young people interested
in conducting or in becoming
musicians. "Learn to play the
piano, and learn to love music."
His love of music has made
Josef Krips a truly great man.


J(n h'l I. MOISK — Macslro Josef krips leads the San Krancisco S\inphom in il> finale ol' the season and his lasl appearance
as Music Director, the Ninth Symphony o! Beethoven.
Josef Krips is one part Mozart
sonata, one part Beethoven's
Ninth, and one part Avant-garde
experiment. He is open, honest,
dedicated—and most of all,
optimistic.
Josef Krips has been Maestro of
the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra for seven years, years in
which attendance became
respectable, the orchestra became
known, and the community
became responsive. Already one
of the foremost conductors in the
world when he arrived in San
Francisco, Maestro Krips has
added to his laurels by his
numerous guest appearances with
major orchestras, his leadership of
the Vienna Opera, and the
receiving of innumerable medals
and citations, as well as his
development of our Symphony.
Maestro Krips may be of the
Old World, but he is definitely not
stodgy. Of the 210 works he has
led here in San Francisco over
seven years, 91 have been by
twentieth century composers. But

are these new works the creative
equals of Beethoven and Mozart?
"No, no, 1 doubt it,"he averred.
"Who will be remembered in a
hundred years" We cannot say, we
will have to wait and see. Even
Schubert, you know, was never
respected in his time. But if I read
200 new scores, and one of them
is worthwhile, then it was worth
the other 1 99."
Final Concerts
Still, the name of Josef Krips is
usually identified with Bruckner
and Bt ■ethoven, so it was
appropriate that his final season
here should have been the
Beethoven Bicentennial Year,
celebrated by the performance of
all the Master's best-known
concert works: all nine
symphonies, all . five piano
concertos, the violin concerto,
and four overtures. And after
conducting the Ninth Symphony
for at least the 100 th time,
Maestro Krips looks on it as
freshly as the first time he led it.
"Every night is for me the
opening night" Maestro Krips
asserted. "We must always work
for perfection, even if we know
that we will only do 40 or 50
percent." He drives his orchestras
to do their very best at all times,
and is perturbed at interruptions
due to schedules. "Too much
business," he sighs.
The Maestro is an autocrat with
his musicians. "An orchestra must
be an aristocracy, not a
democracy,"' 1 he affirmed. "The

to express dismay and regret at
the turmoil besetting our country.
"If they could only realize how
much music has to offer" he
pleaded. "But not this Rock and
Roll —it is not the same thing."
Young In Mind
In an effort to get young
people interested in concert
music, the Symphony under
Maestro Krips' direction has
sponsored an extensive youth
program, and has offered to
students season tickets at reduced
rates. "But they must pay
something," Maestro Krips made
clear. "Do you know why? It is
because when a man gives twenty
dollars or one dollar to the
Symphony, it is no longer THE
orchestra and THE conductor, it
is OUR orchestra and OUR
conductor." This is why he balks
at the proposal of government
sponsorship of symphonic groups.
He would, however, like to see
grants given to allow children to
attend the Symphony. "But even
if they only pay ten cents, that is
important."
It is this community support of
concert music that Maestro Krips
would like to see develop. "In
Europe," he explained, "each
town of maybe 50,000
inhabitants has their opera house.

They have -10, maybe 50 players
in the orhcestra, and they use the
younger singers in the opera. But
here, people won't come to the
opera unless there is a star. And
every city cannot afford that."
Elaborating on the plight of
American singers, he pointed to
his own Vienna Opera. "We have
five excellent tenors there. Four
are Americans, and one is
Canadian, which is almost
American." Decrying this
situation, he said "If all those
American singers had to leave
Europe and return home, they
would starve and the Opera
Houses would have to close."
Future Musicians
Young people, as audience as
well as musician, have long been
an important part of Maestro
Krips' life.
"If people only want to hear a
Serkin or a Rubenstein, what
happens when - they are gone?"
Maestro Krips demanded,
justifying his scheduling of so
many young soloists. "It is
experience that makes a soloist
great, not the technique. Pianists
once had to play so many notes as
fast as they could to be good, but
it is the feeling that really makes
the music great. Andre Watts will
be the top one of the pianists who
were here; sure he is young, but
how else will he get experience?

Even from the Wednesday concert
to Saturday there was a great
improvement in the
performance."
Ne\l Year for Maestro
Next year, Maestro Krips may
earn a nomination to the
Million-Mile Club. He has guest
appearances scheduled all over
Europe and America, as well as
recording sessions in London, the
regular Vienna Opera season, and
a month back on the podium in
San Francisco. "Berlin to London,
then back to Berlin for a week,
then to Vienna, then to
Metropolitan in New York, then
back to Vienna, then . . . then two
weeks of vacation for us,
then .. . and then the year is
done." Would he rather settle
again as Music Director of a
symphony? "No, not again. Too
many problems, with unions and
everything." Maestro Krips resents
the intrusion into production of
music of anything extraneous, be
it power, people or money.
Maestro Krips is a very young
and dynamic 68 year old, and will
next year observe his 50th year as
a conductor. He had a bit of
advice for young people interested
in conducting or in becoming
musicians. "Learn to play the
piano, and learn to love music."
His love of music has made
Josef Krips a truly great man.
