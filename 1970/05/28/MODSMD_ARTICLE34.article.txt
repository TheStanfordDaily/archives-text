## Mendelowitz To Retire 
### article photographs by BONNIE KOEHLER 
Professor Daniel M.
Mendelowitz is retiring after 35
years of teaching at Stanford.
"I'll have more freedom now
to paint and write and go new
places to work . . . but 111 miss
the personal contacts with
students."
So will his students. Since
1934 he has taught hundreds of
Stanford students in his art
history, drawing, and painting
classes.

His studio art classes are very
relaxed as Mendelowitz spends
time with each student, leaning
over his shoulder helping each to
find a personal expression in art.
He encourages independent work
and has often told his students:
"One shouldn't need a class
structure to draw. Carry your
drawing notebook with you to
record spontaneous visual
enthusiasms. Serve as your own
catalyst."
Love for Art
He realized his love for art

early in life and chose it as his
life's discipline. "I have always
derived my greatest satisfaction
from art. My parents didn't think
it was practical, they wanted me
to be a dentist."
Mendelowitz received his B.A.
in Art from Stanford in 1926. He
has always spent much of his time
working on his own drawings and
watercolors. He is well known in
the Bay Areas a landscape
watercolorist and has often had
one man shows of his work in the
Gallery.
His favorite days are those
when he gets up early in the
morning and walks up in the hills
behind his house to paint for
hours in solitude.
"I guess I just like to make
pictures. It's as simple as that.
Honest."
"I paint because I find the
landscape and people endlessly
interesting and beautiful and I like
to communicate that enthusiasm I
feel."
Eucalyptus trees are some of
his favorite subjects of study in
his watercolors and drawings. He
was delighted to find them
abundant in southern France,
where he and his wife Mildred
lived during a sabbatical leave in
1949-50. He has also been a guest
professor on the Stanford in
Tours, France campus in 65-66,
and Florence, Italy in '61.
Mendelowitz and his wife have
traveled all over the U.S. Most at
home in the Bay Area, he also
particularly enjoys the landscapes
of New Mexico, the San Juan
Islands in Washington, and the
rugged Oregon Coast.
He enjoys travel, but makes

this observation: "I don't like to
travel just for the sake of
traveling, I find that rather boring.
I love other parts of the world,
but I want to be able to stay in
them long enough to paint them
as a native, not as a tourist."
Author
Mendelowitz also enjoys
writing. He has written three
books and is presently writing the
article for the new Encyclopedia
Britannica on "Drawing." His
books include "Children are
Artists" (1953) written for
parents and young art educators;
"A History of American Art"
(1963) text for his art history
course, presently being revised;
and "Drawing," a large work
presenting the history of drawing
as an independent art form,
published in 1 967.
He feels that there is an
expanding appreciation for the
arts in the United States, but
there remains an anti-intellectual
ism here on some levels that is
"very tragic."
Have students changed much
since he started teaching in 1934?
"I don't think there have been
any very fundamental changes
other than the ones which have
been caused by the change in
times- which means greater
involvement in the social and
political realms and a broader
cultural awareness."
Prof. Mendelowitz took an
active part in the departmental
policy meetings during the strike.
He understands a close
relationship between education,
politics and responsibility. "I
think that the academic

communities have done more to
make people aware of the tragedy
of our policy in S.E. Asia than
any other group . . . that is why 1
didn't want to see the universities
closed â€”that would seem to me to
dissipate the primary source of
opposition to the war."
"Teaching, education, is very
important . . . it involves
discovering oneself as well as the
world about one . . many of our
most fundamental ideas about life
are drawn from artistic
experiences."
He has always conveyed that
precious enthusiasm for life and
art to his students.
Students' Gratitude
They say of Mendelowitz:
"He's warm, that's what it is,
he's warm. Somehow you know

that ho really cares about all his
students. Not just about what
they are doing in class, but he is
concerned about their whole life,
and relates what's happening in
the classroom to everything you
do."
"He's one of the most
personable teachers I've known."
"He's a real cool guy. We really
get along well together. I can talk
to him because we feel the same
way about things."
One graduate student in studio
art commented:
"The so-called avante-garde art
is often nothing more than a
product of American mass
production. Consequently, the
true avant-garde personality does
not seek to become avant-garde.
Ho achieves his quality through

his genius and his unique worldly
perception as translated in his art.
Mendolowitz is very much a
painter by himself, and therefon
ho is the true avant-garde."
"I like that guy very much."
"In a system plagued with the
solemn and aloof professorial
personality, Mondelowitz stands
alone in having retained a pure
and child-like fascination with
living . .as hard as some may try,
none has approached the openness
and brilliance which characterizes
Mendolowitz in his teaching. Hi is
indeed a sage
In a candid response from an
undergrad:
"He has done a rare and
important thing. He has
encouraged mo. What.more can 1
say?"
