# Films In Preview
## Spring Film Series Come To A Close 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
This is the final installment of
the Daily's version of Movie
Guide, complete with plot
summaries, irrelevant film trivia,
and political overtones.
Today and tomorrow, the
Stanford Community Against War
and Fascism will show "Madina
Boe" continuously from 12 to
1 :30 in room 274, Tresidder.
"This film documents the
ongoing struggle of the people of
Guinea to liberate their homeland
from Portuguese Colonialism.
Tribal customs alongside the latest
tactics in guerrilla warfare are
portrayed lyrically and
dramatically as the People's Army
is shown preparing for an attack
on a Portuguese base. The poets,
athletes, doctors, are all members
of the Peoples Army."
"Madina Boe" is distributed by
Newsreel Films, the organization
that is working to expand the
awareness of events and situations
relevant to shaping the future of
the revolution.
International INtrigue
Tonight, "Sleeping Car
Murder", directed by
Costa-Gavras ("Z") and starring
the husband and wife team of
Simon Signoret and Yves
Montand will be presented by the
International Association at 8 in
Cubberley.
Friday, Stanton Kaye's
"Brandy in the Wilderness" will
have its Bay Area Premiere in
Dinkelspiel at 7, 9, and 11.
Selected for the Cannes Film
Festival in 1969, the Museum of
Modern Art Cineprobe, and Grand
Prize Winner, Ann Arbor Film
Festival last year, this American

Filmmaker's Odyssey is about a
filmmaker, his girlfriend, "the bed
and the camera they shared",
their trip across America, a child,
and their film.
Silent Flicks
The same evening, the Silent
Film Series will show three classic
silent films by E.A. Dupont,
Griffith, and Mack Sennett at 7,
8. and 9 in Tresidder. "Variety" is
a 65 minute German liim made in
1925 by E.A. Dupont. "Boxx"
Huller (Emit Jennings) abandons
his wife for a luscious young
trapeze artist (Lya de Putti). He
even darns her stockings and
undresses her when she is
exhausted after her act. But when
in turn she deceives him with
Artinelli, a famous acrobat, the
solicitous Huller is pushed to
retaliate and winds up in prison.
"The Battle of Elderbush
Gulch", (1914), is one of D.W.
Griffith's few westerns. Lillian
Gish and Mae Marsh portray two
Eastern girls who come to live in
the West and are nearly scalped by
the Indians.
"Barney Oldfield's Race for
Life" (1913), is a hilarious Mack
Sennett chase comedy starring
Sennett, Ford Sterling and Mabel
Norma nd.
Orson's Favorite
This Saturday, Orson Welles'
"The Trial", a loose adaptation of
Kafka's novel, will be shown at 7,
8, and 9 in Tresidder. Kafka's
novel, in briefest essence, is an
allegory of a man who,
representing all that is pathetic in
our society, accepts imputed guilt
without being clearly accused and
eventually accepts punishment by
death.
Welles' Joseph K. (Anthony

Perkins) refuses to knuckle under
and accuses his accusers of trying
to make the world absurd. He not
only resists execution, he kills his
executioners and is in fact
laughing triumphan fl y at the end,
or is he? Welles' on Welles: "Say
what you will, but "The Trial" is
the best film I have ever made."
Sunday Night at the Flicks will
present "Sterile Cuckoo", at 7:30
in Memorial Auditorium. This
honest and unpretentious film
concerns the ups and downs of a
romance between Pookie and
Jerry, two relatively
inexperienced college kids. Liza
Minelli is outstanding as the
overly enthusiastic wierdo Pookie
and Wendell Burton is perfectly
cast as super-sensitive Jerry.
"Sterile Cuckoo", one of the first
and best of the youth-oriented
films, is definately worth seeing.
Perloff disagrees however.
Frosh Series
Next Tuesday, June 2 (great
day), Clive Miller will show the
last films of this year's Freshman
Film Series starting at 8 in
Geology 320. The program will
begin with a thirty-minute excerpt
from "You'll Never Get Rich"
starring Fred Astaire and Rita
Hayworth and featuring the Cole
Porter classics, "Since I Kissed My
Baby Goodbye" and "So Near
and Yet So Far".
At 8:30, "March of Time: Is
Everybody Listening" will be
shown, followed at 9 by "Dark
Passage" starring another husband
and wife team, Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall. "News Parade
of 1948" and a Bugs Bunny Color
Cartoon will be shown at 10:45.
The last film at 11 will be a 1949
Warner Brother drama directed by

King Vidor, "Beyond the Forest",
starring Bette Davis and Joseph
Cot ten.
Thursday, June 4, the
International Association will
show "Summerskin" by
Argentinian director Leopoldo
Torre Nilsson at 8 in Cubberley.
The film, considered to be similar
to Henry James' "Wings of the
Dove" with the sexes reversed,
concerns a calculating, spoiled and
bored young girl who lives with
the dying son of a friend.
Anti-fascist Flicks
Thursday and Friday
afternoon, the Stanford
Community Against War and
Fascism will feature "Oil Strike"
and "Men of the Cornfields"
continuously from 12 until 1:30
in room 274, Tresidder. "Oil
Strike" is a 20-minute film about
the 1969 Northern California oil
strike. "The local police and the
Standard Oil goon squads
attacked the strikers and their
families, killing one and wounding
many others."
"Men of the Canefields" is
another Noonreel feature that

shows" the spirit and
commitment of urban volunteer
workers as they participate in a
collective effort in the Cuban
canefields.
Friday, June 5, "Closely
Watched Trains" will be presented
by Beta Chi at 7:30, 9:15, and 11
in Dinkelspiel. Directed by .Jiri
Menzel, this unique and
impressive film is a comic view of
Czech resistence to the Nazis in
which a bumbling youth
tragicomically comes of age in sex
and wai. "Closely Watched
Trains" received awards from
almost every major film festival
and the Academy Award for Best
Foreign Picture of 1967.
* * *
This summer you can expect a
rash of updated versions of "Get
Yourself A College Girl" and
"Dobie G ill is." Hollywood plans
to cash in on campus disorder
with films like "Getting Straight"
and"The Strawberry Statement."
Be sure to miss "I Am Curious
(Blue)." It's nothing more than
the dregs off the cutting room
floor from "1 Am Curious
(Yellow)".


GUESS WHO—One ol our favorite furry friends (no, it's not Lassie) learns the
mysteries of life in the Itij: city, with his sweet hionde girlfriend in his hand and
love in his heart. This is only one of the many films not showing this weekend
on campus.

a 65 minute German liim made in
1925 by E.A. Dupont. "Boxx"
Huller (Emit Jennings) abandons
his wife for a luscious young
trapeze artist (Lya de Putti). He
even darns her stockings and
undresses her when she is
exhausted after her act. But when
in turn she deceives him with
Artinelli, a famous acrobat, the
solicitous Huller is pushed to
retaliate and winds up in prison.
"The Battle of Elderbush
Gulch", (1914), is one of D.W.
Griffith's few westerns. Lillian
Gish and Mae Marsh portray two
Eastern girls who come to live in
the West and are nearly scalped by
the Indians.
"Barney Oldfield's Race for
Life" (1913), is a hilarious Mack
Sennett chase comedy starring
Sennett, Ford Sterling and Mabel
Norma nd.
Orson's Favorite
This Saturday, Orson Welles'
"The Trial", a loose adaptation of
Kafka's novel, will be shown at 7,
8, and 9 in Tresidder. Kafka's
novel, in briefest essence, is an
allegory of a man who,
representing all that is pathetic in
our society, accepts imputed guilt
without being clearly accused and
eventually accepts punishment by
death.
Welles' Joseph K. (Anthony

Perkins) refuses to knuckle under
and accuses his accusers of trying
to make the world absurd. He not
only resists execution, he kills his
executioners and is in fact
laughing triumphan fl y at the end,
or is he? Welles' on Welles: "Say
what you will, but "The Trial" is
the best film I have ever made."
Sunday Night at the Flicks will
present "Sterile Cuckoo", at 7:30
in Memorial Auditorium. This
honest and unpretentious film
concerns the ups and downs of a
romance between Pookie and
Jerry, two relatively
inexperienced college kids. Liza
Minelli is outstanding as the
overly enthusiastic wierdo Pookie
and Wendell Burton is perfectly
cast as super-sensitive Jerry.
"Sterile Cuckoo", one of the first
and best of the youth-oriented
films, is definately worth seeing.
Perloff disagrees however.
Frosh Series
Next Tuesday, June 2 (great
day), Clive Miller will show the
last films of this year's Freshman
Film Series starting at 8 in
Geology 320. The program will

starring Fred Astaire and Rita
Hayworth and featuring the Cole
Porter classics, "Since I Kissed My
Baby Goodbye" and "So Near
and Yet So Far".
At 8:30, "March of Time: Is
Everybody Listening" will be

of 1948" and a Bugs Bunny Color
Cartoon will be shown at 10:45.
The last film at 11 will be a 1949

King Vidor, "Beyond the Forest",
starring Bette Davis and Joseph
Cot ten.
Thursday, June 4, the
International Association will
show "Summerskin" by
Argentinian director Leopoldo
Torre Nilsson at 8 in Cubberley.
The film, considered to be similar
to Henry James' "Wings of the
Dove" with the sexes reversed,
concerns a calculating, spoiled and
bored young girl who lives with
the dying son of a friend.
Anti-fascist Flicks
Thursday and Friday
afternoon, the Stanford
Community Against War and
Fascism will feature "Oil Strike"
and "Men of the Cornfields"

Strike" is a 20-minute film about
the 1969 Northern California oil
strike. "The local police and the
Standard Oil goon squads
attacked the strikers and their
families, killing one and wounding
many others."
"Men of the Canefields" is
another Noonreel feature that

shows" the spirit and
commitment of urban volunteer
workers as they participate in a
collective effort in the Cuban
canefields.
Friday, June 5, "Closely
Watched Trains" will be presented
by Beta Chi at 7:30, 9:15, and 11
in Dinkelspiel. Directed by .Jiri
Menzel, this unique and
impressive film is a comic view of
Czech resistence to the Nazis in
which a bumbling youth
tragicomically comes of age in sex
and wai. "Closely Watched
Trains" received awards from
almost every major film festival
and the Academy Award for Best
Foreign Picture of 1967.

the dregs off the cutting room

romance between Pookie and
Jerry, two relatively
inexperienced college kids. Liza
Minelli is outstanding as the
overly enthusiastic wierdo Pookie
and Wendell Burton is perfectly
cast as super-sensitive Jerry.
"Sterile Cuckoo", one of the first
and best of the youth-oriented
films, is definately worth seeing.
Perloff disagrees however.

tragicomically comes of age in sex
and wai. "Closely Watched

almost every major film festival
and the Academy Award for Best
Foreign Picture of 1967.

This summer you can expect a
rash of updated versions of "Get
Yourself A College Girl" and
"Dobie G ill is." Hollywood plans
to cash in on campus disorder
with films like "Getting Straight"
and"The Strawberry Statement."
Be sure to miss "I Am Curious
(Blue)." It's nothing more than
the dregs off the cutting room
floor from "1 Am Curious
(Yellow)".


GUESS WHO—One ol our favorite furry friends (no, it's not Lassie) learns the
mysteries of life in the Itij: city, with his sweet hionde girlfriend in his hand and
love in his heart. This is only one of the many films not showing this weekend
on campus.
This is the final installment of
the Daily's version of Movie
Guide, complete with plot
summaries, irrelevant film trivia,
and political overtones.
Today and tomorrow, the
Stanford Community Against War
and Fascism will show "Madina
Boe" continuously from 12 to
1 :30 in room 274, Tresidder.
"This film documents the
ongoing struggle of the people of
Guinea to liberate their homeland
from Portuguese Colonialism.
Tribal customs alongside the latest
tactics in guerrilla warfare are
portrayed lyrically and
dramatically as the People's Army
is shown preparing for an attack
on a Portuguese base. The poets,
athletes, doctors, are all members
of the Peoples Army."
"Madina Boe" is distributed by
Newsreel Films, the organization
that is working to expand the
awareness of events and situations
relevant to shaping the future of
the revolution.

Montand will be presented by the
International Association at 8 in
Cubberley.
Friday, Stanton Kaye's
"Brandy in the Wilderness" will

Selected for the Cannes Film
Festival in 1969, the Museum of
Modern Art Cineprobe, and Grand
Prize Winner, Ann Arbor Film
Festival last year, this American

Filmmaker's Odyssey is about a
filmmaker, his girlfriend, "the bed
and the camera they shared",
their trip across America, a child,
and their film.
Silent Flicks
The same evening, the Silent
Film Series will show three classic
silent films by E.A. Dupont,
Griffith, and Mack Sennett at 7,
8. and 9 in Tresidder. "Variety" is
a 65 minute German liim made in
1925 by E.A. Dupont. "Boxx"
Huller (Emit Jennings) abandons
his wife for a luscious young
trapeze artist (Lya de Putti). He
even darns her stockings and
undresses her when she is
exhausted after her act. But when
in turn she deceives him with
Artinelli, a famous acrobat, the
solicitous Huller is pushed to
retaliate and winds up in prison.
"The Battle of Elderbush
Gulch", (1914), is one of D.W.
Griffith's few westerns. Lillian
Gish and Mae Marsh portray two
Eastern girls who come to live in
the West and are nearly scalped by
the Indians.
"Barney Oldfield's Race for
Life" (1913), is a hilarious Mack
Sennett chase comedy starring
Sennett, Ford Sterling and Mabel
Norma nd.
Orson's Favorite
This Saturday, Orson Welles'
"The Trial", a loose adaptation of
Kafka's novel, will be shown at 7,
8, and 9 in Tresidder. Kafka's
novel, in briefest essence, is an
allegory of a man who,
representing all that is pathetic in
our society, accepts imputed guilt
without being clearly accused and
eventually accepts punishment by
death.
Welles' Joseph K. (Anthony

Perkins) refuses to knuckle under
and accuses his accusers of trying
to make the world absurd. He not
only resists execution, he kills his
executioners and is in fact
laughing triumphan fl y at the end,
or is he? Welles' on Welles: "Say
what you will, but "The Trial" is
the best film I have ever made."
Sunday Night at the Flicks will
present "Sterile Cuckoo", at 7:30
in Memorial Auditorium. This
