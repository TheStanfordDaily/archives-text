It may seem ironic to some
that at a time when the world is
groaning beneath the weight of
war and oppression that we sing
"An Ode to Joy." It may seem
strange that at this very instant
when men are torn by
misunderstanding, fear and hatred
that we can stand to listen as a
deaf, crotchity old man shouts
out in joyous delirium "All men
are brothers! Here's a kiss for all
mankind!" Perhaps it is as one
nineteenth century critic put it,
"a gigantic burlesque."
And yet, I cannot help but feel
that there is no more appropriate
moment than now to once again

lift up the hope that our world
will someday be united in
brotherhood. And there is no
more appropriate way to
communicate that hope than in
presen ing Beethoven's
magnificent Ninth Symphony. It
is a most precious farewell gift
from conductor Josef Krips.
Opening Work
The concert began with the
Symphony Number One also by
Beethoven. The orchestra played
well for the most part. However
the piece is over-shadowed by the
greatness of the Ninth. The
difference stands as a tribute to
the development of the composer.
Now, for the Ninth. It was not

perfect. The conservative Krips
ruled for the first three
movements and the orchestra was
more than willing to comply. The
performance was competent but
the spark of joy which should be
felt throughout was not there. At
best it flickered briefly, notably in
sections of the third movement,
but then would disappear.
Enough of these sad tunes! Let
us sing a more joyful song. If
there was ever a performance of
one movement of a symphony
that can make people forget the
rest of the evening it was tonights
inspired performance of the
Choral Finale.
Chorus Superb
Bravos are due mainly to the
Stanford Chorus led by the
inspired Krips, the passionate
Krips. The chorus maintained a
solid sound throughout the
performance and at times reached
for the highest pinnacles of
musical power. The soloists,
Benita Valente, Soprano; Lili
Chookasian, Mezzo Soprano;
William Chocran, Tenor and
Giorgio Tozzi, Bass were all
skillful in handling the difficult
solo work. The orchestra seemed
to take its cue from the chorus
and Krips and came through with
a solid performance high-lighted
by the Alia Marcia section, and
the final prestissimo.
It is Krips final program as
Musical Director in San Francisco.
The audience paid him the highest
tribute that any audience can,
they stood and applauded his final
effort for several minutes. Josef
Krips has made the San Francisco
Symphony respectable. The "Ode
to Joy" is a fitting conclusion.

The audience paid him the highest
tribute that any audience can,
they stood and applauded his final
effort for several minutes. Josef
Krips has made the San Francisco
Symphony respectable. The "Ode
to Joy" is a fitting conclusion.
It may seem ironic to some
that at a time when the world is
groaning beneath the weight of
war and oppression that we sing
"An Ode to Joy." It may seem
strange that at this very instant
when men are torn by
misunderstanding, fear and hatred
that we can stand to listen as a
deaf, crotchity old man shouts
out in joyous delirium "All men
are brothers! Here's a kiss for all
mankind!" Perhaps it is as one
nineteenth century critic put it,
"a gigantic burlesque."
And yet, I cannot help but feel
that there is no more appropriate
moment than now to once again

lift up the hope that our world
will someday be united in
brotherhood. And there is no
more appropriate way to
communicate that hope than in
presen ing Beethoven's
magnificent Ninth Symphony. It
is a most precious farewell gift
from conductor Josef Krips.
Opening Work
The concert began with the
Symphony Number One also by
Beethoven. The orchestra played
well for the most part. However
the piece is over-shadowed by the
greatness of the Ninth. The
difference stands as a tribute to
the development of the composer.
Now, for the Ninth. It was not

perfect. The conservative Krips
ruled for the first three
movements and the orchestra was
more than willing to comply. The
performance was competent but
the spark of joy which should be
felt throughout was not there. At
best it flickered briefly, notably in
sections of the third movement,
but then would disappear.
Enough of these sad tunes! Let
us sing a more joyful song. If
there was ever a performance of
one movement of a symphony
that can make people forget the
rest of the evening it was tonights
inspired performance of the
Choral Finale.
Chorus Superb
Bravos are due mainly to the
Stanford Chorus led by the
inspired Krips, the passionate
Krips. The chorus maintained a
solid sound throughout the
performance and at times reached
for the highest pinnacles of
musical power. The soloists,
Benita Valente, Soprano; Lili
Chookasian, Mezzo Soprano;
William Chocran, Tenor and
Giorgio Tozzi, Bass were all
skillful in handling the difficult
solo work. The orchestra seemed
to take its cue from the chorus
and Krips and came through with
a solid performance high-lighted
by the Alia Marcia section, and
the final prestissimo.
It is Krips final program as
Musical Director in San Francisco.
The audience paid him the highest
tribute that any audience can,
they stood and applauded his final
effort for several minutes. Josef
Krips has made the San Francisco
Symphony respectable. The "Ode
to Joy" is a fitting conclusion.
