# 'Celebrations Of Life'
## Black Artists To Perform 
### FRANK MILLER 
Well over 100 people, including
members of the outside
community, are producing "A
Celebration of Life" to be
performed this weekend in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Humor, allegory and tragedy
are the themes of three one-act
plays that dominate the
multimedia production presented
by the Afro American Drama
Workshop-1 02. "A Celebration of
Life" will be presented May 30,
31, and June 1 at 8 p.m.
According to Johnie Scott,
who is in charge of the
production, the response of black
students and the community to
the performance has been
tremendous, even though they are
operating on a hamstring budget.
Over 90 students are in the
integrated Workshop that started
this quarterl Besides that, outside
help on costumes, lights, sets and
even acting has been welcomed
and received.
Scott, however, is bitter about
the financial the
University has given the
production. "I've got a helluva lot
of people and not a dime," he
complained. They received $250
from the Black Studies
Department and $700 from the
BSLJ >r the production. "For last
year show we had
com I. ment," he said. The
university gave the show
permission to spend up to $5,000
(they spent only $3,700) to
produce "Black Faces."
Scott emphasized that the
production is just part of the
Afro-American Studies
Department which he and others
are trying to build. He feels the
success of the department was
proved when the people working
on "A Celebration of Life" kept
on working after they did not
receive any money.
The Afro-American Studies
Department is currently working
on the last part of its $135,000
Ford Foundation Grant and,
according to Scott, when
members of the I'oundntion came

here to review the program and
consider renewing the program
they concluded that Stanford
"had the best program in the
states." Scott said that the
administration has only made a
commitment of $35,000 for next
year for the continuation of the
course, Racism and Prejudice.
All proceeds from the
production go to the Department
of Afro-American Studies.
Scott emphasized that this is a
positive production of many
people and he was lavish in his
praise for all who had helped. The
production tells simply, "This is
where we (the blacks) are."
"A Celebration of Life"

consists of three one-act plays
high-lighted by Stanford's Black
Dancers who will perform
between the first and second
plays. Composed of seven versatile
and talented young women,
executing the choreography of
Shirley Allen, the dancers will
interpret the moods of religion,
revelry and revolution.
The trilogy of plays features
"Family Meeting," by William
Wellington Mackey, a comedy
that pokes fun at 'Southern Life'
stereotypes; "A Day of Absence,"
by " Douglas Turner Ward, a
satirical fantasy that is a
minstrel-show in reverse and
"Natural Thing," an original

drama and tragedy bv Buff J.
Parham, a Stanford senior.
"Natural Thing" features an
event where an edict is issued that
all blacks will be put in
concentration camps because of
all the trouble that has gone on in
this country. It features Steve
Levin playing Harvey Marble,
Robert Walker playing Sam
Smith, and Anthony Parker
playing John Smith.
"Family Meeting" features
Carolyn Hatchett playing Mother
Love, Darnell Thompson playing
Father Love, Johnie Scott as
Brother Love Black. Dave Dudley
as Brother Love White, Patricia
Bell as Precious Love, and Betty
James as Lily of the Flowers.
