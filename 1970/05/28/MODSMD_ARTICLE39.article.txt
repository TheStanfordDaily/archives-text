# Sandy Vance Goes To The Top
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
Every so often the day-to-day proceedings of
major league baseball 4re enlivened by the arrival
of a rookie "phenom" from the minors. Called up
in a hurry, often to replace an injured starter, the
luzzy-cheeked youngster arrives on the scene with
a battered suitcase and stomach full of butterflies.
In fiction, of course, the nervous rookie makes
an impressive debut, with crucial contributions to
a few wins and goes on to the All Star team in
July. But we all know that things like that never
happen.
Or do they?
Tough Debut
Take the case of Sandy Vance, Stanford's latest
contribution to the major leagues. Called up to the
Los Angeles Dodgers from their Spokane farm
club on April 23, the righthander made his first
start on Sunday, April 26 against Tom Seaver and
the world champion New York Mets.
Unfortunately for the storytellers, Vance lost
that game 3-1. But he went on to beat the
Montreal Expos 2-1 and outlast Juan Marichal and
the San Francisco Giants while compiling the 4-2
record he took into last night's rematch with the
Giants in Candlestick Park. In the process, he's
established an earned run average of 2.06, which
leads all Dodger starters and is among the best in
the National League. Should he continue this pace,
an All Star berth would not be out of the
question.
Interviewed in the Dodger dugout prior to the
opening game of the current Giant-Dodger series,
Vance related his reaction to last month's callup.'
"It was a real surprise. I came up from Tacoma
where we'd been playing a series and they said
'You're starting in three days.' It was a real shock.
I spent those three days getting nervous, and it
showed in that first game, but since then I've been
making a concerted effort to relax. Now I'm
playing in enough of a groove that it's like pitching
in Spokane."

For the uninitiated, Vance came to Stanford in
1965 after turning down an offer from the
Dodgers after graduation from Pasadena High
School. The main reason I chose Stanford was for
the education, I didn't feel that I was physically or
emotionally able to go directly to the pros. I
anticipated that if 'I had it' I could sign after
that."
8 Future Pros
Pitching for an incredible frosh squad in 1966,
Sandy led the team with a 9-0 record, 117
strikeouts and a 1.31 ERA. He was one of eight
players off that team who eventually signed pro
contracts.
As a sophomore, he had his best college year,
piling up an 11-0 record and setting the Stanford
strikeout record of 94 (broken this year by Steve
Dunning) as the Indians went to Omaha for the
College World Series. Stanford, second runner-up
there, ended the season as the number-one ranked
college team.
"Sandy had a great arm when he was here,"
says Stanford coach Ray Young, "but he still had
a lot to learn. Yet there was never any doubt that
he'd make it in th pros."
Vance had an "off year" in 1968 with a 6-3
record. Although fanning 85, he led the team with
39 w;lks and eight wild pitches. He signed with
the Dodgers right after the season and spent the
summer in a rookie league. Moving up to the
Pacilic Coast League last vear, he was 6-6 with a

3.95 ERA at Spokane. But his fast start this season
earned him a spot on the varsity after pitcher Bill
Singer was sidelined with infectious hepatitis.
"One of the big differences between college ball
and Triple A or major league competition is the
kind of talent you have to face all the way down
the lineup," he says. "Usually, in amateur baseball
you have to worry about the first four or five
hitters, but after that you can let up. You don't do
that here."
Vance, who was a strikeout artist in college, has
had to change his style in the pros. "You just don't
blow the ball by major leaguers. You have to
change speeds more—be a pitcher, not just a
thrower."
Social Work
After signing his contract, Sandy came back to
Stanford to get his degree in Political Science,
finishing up in March, 1969. "Eventually, I'd like
to go to grad school," he says.
"What I'm looking for is an opportunity for
social work. I'd like something where I can make a
meaningful contribution to society instead of
some self-seeking profession. And I think baseball
can be a gateway to kids and the kind of thing I
want to do later on.
"You know, people always ask me why I like to
play baseball so much. It can be as much a part of
you as anything. The thrill, the excitement and the
competition do a lot to strengthen your character
and patience, as well as your willingness to strive
on in spite of defeat. As a pitcher, you can be in a
perfect groove and still lose.
Inquiring about recent developments at
Stanford, Vance applauded the efforts of students
who "go out and do constructive things."
At which point Sandy Vance, resident phenom
in Los Angeles, excused himself and sprinted out
to shag some fly balls. With a record and a name to
remind Dodger fans of two other pitchers, Dazzy
Vance and Sandy Koufax, this 23-year-old may be
around for quite awhile.

Every so often the day-to-day proceedings of
major league baseball 4re enlivened by the arrival
of a rookie "phenom" from the minors. Called up
in a hurry, often to replace an injured starter, the
luzzy-cheeked youngster arrives on the scene with
a battered suitcase and stomach full of butterflies.
In fiction, of course, the nervous rookie makes
an impressive debut, with crucial contributions to
a few wins and goes on to the All Star team in
July. But we all know that things like that never
happen.
Or do they?
Tough Debut
Take the case of Sandy Vance, Stanford's latest
contribution to the major leagues. Called up to the
Los Angeles Dodgers from their Spokane farm
club on April 23, the righthander made his first
start on Sunday, April 26 against Tom Seaver and
the world champion New York Mets.
Unfortunately for the storytellers, Vance lost
that game 3-1. But he went on to beat the
Montreal Expos 2-1 and outlast Juan Marichal and
the San Francisco Giants while compiling the 4-2
record he took into last night's rematch with the
Giants in Candlestick Park. In the process, he's
established an earned run average of 2.06, which
leads all Dodger starters and is among the best in
the National League. Should he continue this pace,
an All Star berth would not be out of the
question.
Interviewed in the Dodger dugout prior to the
opening game of the current Giant-Dodger series,
Vance related his reaction to last month's callup.'
"It was a real surprise. I came up from Tacoma
where we'd been playing a series and they said
'You're starting in three days.' It was a real shock.
I spent those three days getting nervous, and it
showed in that first game, but since then I've been
making a concerted effort to relax. Now I'm
playing in enough of a groove that it's like pitching
in Spokane."

For the uninitiated, Vance came to Stanford in
1965 after turning down an offer from the
Dodgers after graduation from Pasadena High
School. The main reason I chose Stanford was for
the education, I didn't feel that I was physically or
emotionally able to go directly to the pros. I
anticipated that if 'I had it' I could sign after
that."
8 Future Pros
Pitching for an incredible frosh squad in 1966,
Sandy led the team with a 9-0 record, 117
strikeouts and a 1.31 ERA. He was one of eight
players off that team who eventually signed pro
contracts.
As a sophomore, he had his best college year,
piling up an 11-0 record and setting the Stanford
strikeout record of 94 (broken this year by Steve
Dunning) as the Indians went to Omaha for the
College World Series. Stanford, second runner-up
there, ended the season as the number-one ranked
college team.
"Sandy had a great arm when he was here,"
says Stanford coach Ray Young, "but he still had
a lot to learn. Yet there was never any doubt that
he'd make it in th pros."
Vance had an "off year" in 1968 with a 6-3
record. Although fanning 85, he led the team with
39 w;lks and eight wild pitches. He signed with
the Dodgers right after the season and spent the
summer in a rookie league. Moving up to the
Pacilic Coast League last vear, he was 6-6 with a

3.95 ERA at Spokane. But his fast start this season
earned him a spot on the varsity after pitcher Bill
Singer was sidelined with infectious hepatitis.
"One of the big differences between college ball
and Triple A or major league competition is the
kind of talent you have to face all the way down
the lineup," he says. "Usually, in amateur baseball
you have to worry about the first four or five
hitters, but after that you can let up. You don't do
that here."
Vance, who was a strikeout artist in college, has
had to change his style in the pros. "You just don't
blow the ball by major leaguers. You have to
change speeds more—be a pitcher, not just a
thrower."
Social Work
After signing his contract, Sandy came back to
Stanford to get his degree in Political Science,
finishing up in March, 1969. "Eventually, I'd like

39 w;lks and eight wild pitches. He signed with
the Dodgers right after the season and spent the
summer in a rookie league. Moving up to the
Pacilic Coast League last vear, he was 6-6 with a

3.95 ERA at Spokane. But his fast start this season
earned him a spot on the varsity after pitcher Bill
Singer was sidelined with infectious hepatitis.
"One of the big differences between college ball
and Triple A or major league competition is the
kind of talent you have to face all the way down
the lineup," he says. "Usually, in amateur baseball
you have to worry about the first four or five
hitters, but after that you can let up. You don't do
that here."
Vance, who was a strikeout artist in college, has
had to change his style in the pros. "You just don't
blow the ball by major leaguers. You have to
change speeds more—be a pitcher, not just a
thrower."
Social Work
After signing his contract, Sandy came back to
Stanford to get his degree in Political Science,
finishing up in March, 1969. "Eventually, I'd like
to go to grad school," he says.
"What I'm looking for is an opportunity for
social work. I'd like something where I can make a
meaningful contribution to society instead of
some self-seeking profession. And I think baseball
can be a gateway to kids and the kind of thing I
want to do later on.
"You know, people always ask me why I like to
play baseball so much. It can be as much a part of
you as anything. The thrill, the excitement and the
competition do a lot to strengthen your character
and patience, as well as your willingness to strive
on in spite of defeat. As a pitcher, you can be in a
perfect groove and still lose.
Inquiring about recent developments at
Stanford, Vance applauded the efforts of students
who "go out and do constructive things."
At which point Sandy Vance, resident phenom
in Los Angeles, excused himself and sprinted out
to shag some fly balls. With a record and a name to
remind Dodger fans of two other pitchers, Dazzy
Vance and Sandy Koufax, this 23-year-old may be
around for quite awhile.

Every so often the day-to-day proceedings of
major league baseball 4re enlivened by the arrival
of a rookie "phenom" from the minors. Called up
in a hurry, often to replace an injured starter, the
luzzy-cheeked youngster arrives on the scene with
a battered suitcase and stomach full of butterflies.
In fiction, of course, the nervous rookie makes
an impressive debut, with crucial contributions to
a few wins and goes on to the All Star team in
July. But we all know that things like that never
happen.
Or do they?
Tough Debut
Take the case of Sandy Vance, Stanford's latest
contribution to the major leagues. Called up to the
Los Angeles Dodgers from their Spokane farm
club on April 23, the righthander made his first
start on Sunday, April 26 against Tom Seaver and
the world champion New York Mets.
Unfortunately for the storytellers, Vance lost
that game 3-1. But he went on to beat the
Montreal Expos 2-1 and outlast Juan Marichal and
the San Francisco Giants while compiling the 4-2
record he took into last night's rematch with the
Giants in Candlestick Park. In the process, he's
established an earned run average of 2.06, which
leads all Dodger starters and is among the best in
the National League. Should he continue this pace,
an All Star berth would not be out of the
question.
Interviewed in the Dodger dugout prior to the
opening game of the current Giant-Dodger series,
Vance related his reaction to last month's callup.'
"It was a real surprise. I came up from Tacoma
where we'd been playing a series and they said
'You're starting in three days.' It was a real shock.
I spent those three days getting nervous, and it
showed in that first game, but since then I've been
making a concerted effort to relax. Now I'm
playing in enough of a groove that it's like pitching
in Spokane."

For the uninitiated, Vance came to Stanford in
1965 after turning down an offer from the
Dodgers after graduation from Pasadena High
School. The main reason I chose Stanford was for
the education, I didn't feel that I was physically or
emotionally able to go directly to the pros. I
anticipated that if 'I had it' I could sign after
that."
8 Future Pros
Pitching for an incredible frosh squad in 1966,
Sandy led the team with a 9-0 record, 117
strikeouts and a 1.31 ERA. He was one of eight
players off that team who eventually signed pro
contracts.
As a sophomore, he had his best college year,
piling up an 11-0 record and setting the Stanford
strikeout record of 94 (broken this year by Steve
Dunning) as the Indians went to Omaha for the
College World Series. Stanford, second runner-up
there, ended the season as the number-one ranked
college team.
"Sandy had a great arm when he was here,"
says Stanford coach Ray Young, "but he still had
a lot to learn. Yet there was never any doubt that
he'd make it in th pros."
