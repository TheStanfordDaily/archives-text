# For Second Sit-In, Too
## SJC Drops Charges 
### EMMA PRICE 
The administration has dropped
all charges resulting from the
second Old Union sit-in. This was
done in the wake of the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) decision to
drop all charges from the first Old
Union sit-in made Tuesday at an
eleven hour session.
The announcement came at an
SJC session yesterday afternoon,
and was apparently based on
evaluation of Tuesday's decision.
The defense on Tuesday
maintained there was no proof
that each individual defendant
had received warning and had
then remained in the building.
The SJC also held hearings
yesterday on charges resulting
from the April 3 mill-in at the
Academic Council.
The main witness in the
afternoon session yesterday was

President Pitzer, testifying for the
prosecution. He was called after
testimony had been heard from
Dean of Students Peter Bulkeley
and two University News Service
photographers. The three
explained the process used to
identify individuals in the
thirty-nine pictures of the event
which were prominently displayed
at the front of the room
Pitzer was questioned on the
events of the afternoon of the
Council meeting. He explained
that the meeting was open to
those of professorial rank, and
those who had received
invitations.
Tape Played
A ten minute tape of the
meeting was played. In this, Pitzer
tried to establish order as
demonstrators talked and sang
"We Shall Overcome." Provost

Richard Lyman then read a list of
those people permitted in the
Council, after which the
demonstrators left.
Responding to a question put
to him by Prosecutor Paul
Valentine, Pitzer stated that he
considered the mill-in a disruption
f or two reasons. The defendants
had entered the Council after they
had been warned, he contended,
and their continued presence
made it impossible for the
meeting to continue. He later
stated that a meeting could be a
disruption even if it was not
declared so.
In cross-examination, the
defense tried to establish that a
quorum had not been present at
the meeting and that the meeting
had never been called to order.
The defense also asserted that
outside press were present at the
meeting without invitation, and
that disruption of another Council
meeting had gone unpunished.
For all of these reasons the
defense maintained that no
disruption had occurred.
Pitzer Questioned
Questioning of the University
president by the six students and
one lawyer covered a wide range
of topics. Pitzer was asked to
define other people's rights, his
possible connections to the
Defense Department David
Packard's position on ROTC, and
his testimony at the Oppenheimer
trial. His answers were generally
brief.
In a related development
President Pitzer issued a statement
Wednesday morning saying that
he will not hear appeals from the
SJC trials of Off-ROTC
protestors. This chore will be
taken over by Provost
Lyman. Three more group cases
have been scheduled for hearings
by the SJC. Next Monday and
Tuesday hearings will be held on
the ROTC door blocking cases. At
one p.m. in room 163E of the
Law School. The ROTC mill-in
case will be heard Thursday at
nine a.m. in the Lang Room of
the Law School. All hearings are
open to the public.
