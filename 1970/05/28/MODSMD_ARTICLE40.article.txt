# IM Softball Goes Down To The Wire
## 
### 
Intramural activity for the year
comes down to the wire this
week, with stellar finishes
expected in a number of events,
including the "A" division Softball
title.
There, the KAs and the Dekes
are figured by devoted IM experts
to grapple for the championship
which would be a rematch of an
earlier game which the KAs won
easily, 13-0, in four innings.
That was the only loss so far fo
the Dekes, who sport a 7-1 record.
Yesterday, the Theta DelLs beat
the Phuds 4-0 and Theta Chi
defeated Cro Mem to reach the
semis.
In other events, Cro Mem and
KA are the likely finalists in
horseshoes and Cro Mem A and B
plus KA and Biz IB are expected
to come down to the finals in
tennis competition.
Waterpolo
Sigma Chi is the favorite in
waterpolo and the Theta Delts are
given the nod for the volleyball
crown to be decided today.
The "B" softball championship
is on the line this afternoon on
field seven between KA Band
Zete B.
In results already in, SAE used
a strong team effort to take the
team title in the swimming meet,
though most first places went to
other teams.
Ken Terry of the Dekes was
one of two double winners,
setting records in the 100 IM
(58.4) and a 45.3 in the 75 breast
stroke. Banks Beasley of KA
claimed the 50 free with a record
22.8 and came back to take the
75 butterfly.
Cro Mem was second in the
team standings, followed by KA
and Arroyo.
Despite the strike and illness,
El Toro hung on to take the
intramural track and field title,
edging KA 51 -50.
Toro Triumphs
There were two double winners
for El Toro, as Charlie Carrera
took the broad jump with a 20-7
effort and the triple jump
(44-10â€”a new record) and Bob
Spanner swept the sprints with a
10.4 time in the 100 and a 23.3 in
the 220.
Roble's Steve Karpinos was
another double winner, leccinn

out the mile and two mile in times
of 4:39.6 and 10:16.6. The KA
mile relay team also set a new
meet record with a 3:39.6 effort.
In team standings, it appears
that the redoubtable KAs are on
their way to another total point
victory, although the spirited
jocks from Cro Mem could still
garner that glory by winning all
events in which they are still
competing.
