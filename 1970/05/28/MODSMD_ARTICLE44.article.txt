# Cards Beat Bears; Seven Tabbed For Lacrosse All-Stars
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Berkeley's lacrosse forces were,
to be frank, decidedly awed with
the prospect of facing Stanford in
the season's final regular game
Monday afternoon.
In the first place, the Indians
had already scored sufficient
victories to win the Northern
California Lacross Assn.
championship regardless of the
outcome of the Cal game.
Second, Stanford had nlready
beaten the Bears 7-5 earlier in the
season, in a game in which the
Cards weren't really their best.
Beyond that there was the
setting. "They've even got a
horn," exclaimed one Berkelian
with a tinge of envy from the
bench as the timer tested his
equipment just before game time.
Their surprise and pleasure was
justified, then, when the esteemed
visitors found themselves on top
3-1 at the half. "Who's ever been
on a team that beat Stanford?"
shouted one from the huddle,
hoping to inspire his teammates to
an upset victory.
Bears On Top
The Bears managed to stay on
top, 5-4, into the opening
moments of the final quarter, but
after that Stanford took complete
control and drilled in four last
period goals which left the visitors
scrambling furiously, not to win
but to avoid a rout.
Larry Glenn tied the battle
with an assist from Chip Loveman
early in the fourth, Stu Childs
scored shortly thereafter on a pass
from Dirk Speas, and Butch
Hazlett and Speas blitzed the
befuddled Cal goalie with
unassisted shots to finish the
afternoon.
Hazlett led Indian scorers with

three goals, and Speas and Childs
added a pair each.
The victory left the Indians
with a 7-1 league record and a
respectable 10-4 total mark,
including forays into the salt flats
of Utah, the mountains of
Colorado and the smog of Los
Angeles.
Star Game Here
While the water was still being
poured over assorted heads in the
victory celebration that followed,
a club spokesman announced that
seven Stanford players have been
elected to the North team for the
California North-South All-Star
game to be played on Stanford's
rugby field Saturday at 2 p.m.
Childs, Speas, Paul Tittmann,
Bill Eakland, Wade Killefer,
Loveman and Hazlett were all
picked from the Indian squad.
The victory over Cal left the
Tribe with continued possession
of the Broken Stick Award which
annually goes to the team with
the highest combines score from
both Cal-Stanford games.
The Indians dominated
first-quarter play, but a Cal
breakaway put the Bears on top
1-0, and with that inspiration they
upped it to 3-1 at the half.
With the game still on the line
after three quarters, Eakland told
his fellow troops at the break that
despite a few minor defensive
difficulties the team was playing
as well as it ever had.
And when the Bear resistance
finally cracked, the Tribe finished
off its year with a blazing
offensive display.
Stanford's Fred Choate played
a fine game in the nets,
overcoming a mouth injury
suffered in the second half and
returning, after brief substitution,
to finish it out.

a fine game in the nets,
overcoming a mouth injury
suffered in the second half and
returning, after brief substitution,
to finish it out.
Berkeley's lacrosse forces were,
to be frank, decidedly awed with
the prospect of facing Stanford in
the season's final regular game
Monday afternoon.
In the first place, the Indians
had already scored sufficient
victories to win the Northern
California Lacross Assn.
championship regardless of the
outcome of the Cal game.
Second, Stanford had nlready
beaten the Bears 7-5 earlier in the
season, in a game in which the
Cards weren't really their best.
Beyond that there was the
setting. "They've even got a
horn," exclaimed one Berkelian
with a tinge of envy from the
bench as the timer tested his
equipment just before game time.
Their surprise and pleasure was
justified, then, when the esteemed
visitors found themselves on top
3-1 at the half. "Who's ever been
on a team that beat Stanford?"
shouted one from the huddle,
hoping to inspire his teammates to
an upset victory.
Bears On Top
The Bears managed to stay on
top, 5-4, into the opening
moments of the final quarter, but
after that Stanford took complete
control and drilled in four last
period goals which left the visitors
scrambling furiously, not to win
but to avoid a rout.
Larry Glenn tied the battle
with an assist from Chip Loveman
early in the fourth, Stu Childs
scored shortly thereafter on a pass
from Dirk Speas, and Butch
Hazlett and Speas blitzed the
befuddled Cal goalie with
unassisted shots to finish the
afternoon.
Hazlett led Indian scorers with

three goals, and Speas and Childs
added a pair each.
The victory left the Indians
with a 7-1 league record and a
respectable 10-4 total mark,
including forays into the salt flats
of Utah, the mountains of
Colorado and the smog of Los
Angeles.
Star Game Here
While the water was still being
poured over assorted heads in the
victory celebration that followed,
a club spokesman announced that
seven Stanford players have been
elected to the North team for the
California North-South All-Star
game to be played on Stanford's
rugby field Saturday at 2 p.m.
Childs, Speas, Paul Tittmann,
Bill Eakland, Wade Killefer,
Loveman and Hazlett were all
picked from the Indian squad.
The victory over Cal left the
Tribe with continued possession
of the Broken Stick Award which
annually goes to the team with
the highest combines score from
both Cal-Stanford games.
The Indians dominated
first-quarter play, but a Cal
breakaway put the Bears on top
1-0, and with that inspiration they
upped it to 3-1 at the half.
With the game still on the line
after three quarters, Eakland told
his fellow troops at the break that
despite a few minor defensive
difficulties the team was playing
as well as it ever had.
And when the Bear resistance
finally cracked, the Tribe finished
off its year with a blazing
offensive display.
Stanford's Fred Choate played
a fine game in the nets,
overcoming a mouth injury
suffered in the second half and
returning, after brief substitution,
to finish it out.
