# Nairobi College Plans
## 
### 
The Urban Arts Foundation has made a grant to Stanford
architecture student Peggy Leawell to draft plans for Nairobi College's
wood-arts building. The building will be built by students at the East
Palo School.
Urban Arts was born last winter at Stanford through the efforts of
Professors George Jenkins, Sanford Dornbusch and Ed Greenberg. St.
Clair Drake is now chairman of the group which seeks educational and
economic solutions to urban problems.
A handcrafted door of wood mosiac valued at $300 has been
donated by the foundation to the KQED auction beginning next
week.
