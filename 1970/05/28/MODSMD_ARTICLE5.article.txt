# Subsidy Requested For Political Study
## 
### CATHY COOPER 
Mike Fehling, leader of
Stanford's Political Action
Coordinating Committee (PACC),
has asked the faculty Senate to
help create a summer Center for
the Study of Political Action.
Fehling wants the University to
completely subsidize summer-long
study for at least 100 students,
who would engage in intensive
study of political action coupled
with political work in the field.
In return, the students would
assume leadership roles in
organizing for the Princeton
Planâ€”a two week recess for
campaigning before next
November's elections.
Fehling has lodged his request
with the faculty Senate
committee preparing to report on
the Princeton Plan today.
According to Fehling, one

member of the committee
commented that the plan in rough
outline seemed to be "precisely
the kind of thing" the committee
had envisioned. Committee action
on the summer plan is expected
Friday.
The Center would include a
vigorous evening program os
seminars and teach-outs designed
to involve the community in
studying political action.
Members of the Indochina
Political Action Grup, including
political science professor John
Lewis, have agreed to lead
seminars, Gabriel Almond of
political science and Bernie Cohen
of sociology would also
participate.
Students would have two
weeks of intensive training from
the faculty and persons with
political experience. The rest of
the summer would be spent under
a tutor's direction studying
political action through
involvement in the field.
Under the proposal, it might be
possible for a student at the end
of the first two weeks to return to
his home town to work for a
political candidate, to register
voters, or to organize the
community around an issue. At
the end of August he would

submit a scholarly analysis of his
experience.
As proposed, the summer of
study at the Center would cost
the . student nothing. The
University is being asked to
provide a fraternity cluster and
food service and to waive tuition.
For information on how to
register interest in the Center,
students should see the Summer
Session window in the Old Union
or contact PACC.
