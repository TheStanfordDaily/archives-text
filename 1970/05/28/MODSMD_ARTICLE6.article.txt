# Kunstler Suggests Youth Now Enemy
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
William Kunstler, chief defense
{ lawyer in the "Chicago Seven"
I conspiracy trial told a Stanford
I audience of more than 1500
J yesterday, "You have suddenly
become the main enemy" to those
in positions of power.
He urged college students to
carry out "resistance" which is
"everything short of violent
revolution," while being prepared

to pick up the rifle "if that does
not bring unequivocal change."
Kunstler told the noontime
White Plaza crowd that campus
reaction to the Cambodian
invasion and Kent State shootings
made those in power realize "they
suddenly had an asp at their
bosom."
Describing campuses as "in a
key position for a social
revolution," he said that if
students do not hold firm their
protest this year will have been a
"dangerous put-on."
He added that the Nixon
administration is hoping this
spring's protests will die over the
summer, and "you'll come back in
September imbued with electoral
politics and stay out of people's
hair until they shoot more
students or invade another
country."
'Fist Clenched Stand'
He urges a "fist-clenched"
stand by students, with tactics
including keeping campuses closed
and refusing draft induction.
But Kunstler opposed campus
violence as unproductive at
present. He said, "I don't think a
broken window is going to change
social history. It just leads to pigs
and provocation."
He said he had love and

respect" for his friends in the
violent Weatherman organization,
but that they had become
unuseful" by becoming an
underground guerilla organization.
Kunstler explained, "There
may be a time when pipe bombs
are more important than pipe
dreams, but I'm not sure that this
is the moment."
No Injunction
Kunstler said his Stanford
speech was as inportant as his
other appearances, although it was
"the first place I've been in a long
time where there has not been an
injunction or order" banning his
appearance.
The controversial lawyer spoke
at San Jose State college Monday
night after a Federal Court
injunction overturned a ruling by
State College Chancellor Glenn
Dumke which had banned the
speech.
He suggested that students now
are more of a threat to the power
structure than Black Panthers."
United Stand
If student factions are willing
to sacrifice conflicting tactics and
ideologies to stay united, he
believes they have some hope of
starting "a world where we can at
least vaguely see our lives have
