# Folk Hero Ponders Identity
## 
### TOM GIVEN PAUL GRUSHKIN 
A tired and frustrated William
Kunstler stretched out in the back
seat of the car as it sped across the
Dumbarton Bridge.
"I'd like to be a unifier and a
tactician at the same time," he
pondered. "It's never been done
before, but that doesn't mean it's
impossible."
His appearance at Stanford
hadn't been a total success. "It
wasn't a very good speech." said

made him a legend; in his own
mind, he remains confused over
his new power.
Looking For Answers
"They're looking for answers
from you," said one of his
companions, "they want you to
outline something specific to
follow." Kunstler hadn't given the
crowd at Stanford anything big to
shoot for; he wasn't sure what it
was he should have said.
He had failed at Stanford on
two grounds. He had neither made
clear a common goal for all to
work towards, nor had he made
clear that different tactics can
further the same cause.
His goal is hardly new. He
seeks a return to the principles of
freedom and equality that the
nation was founded on. Continual
references to the American
Revolution punctuate his
conversation and his rhetoric.
One of his friends advised him,
"What you should he saying, Bill,
is 'does this help accomplish the
goal?' If it does, then do it."
Kunstler agreed. "Abie
(Hoffman) always says, 'Think,
Act; Think, Act'; you've got to
know what it is you're doing."
Role Confusion
He is clearly torn; Kunstler the
man is uneasy with Kunstler the

his wife, "I knew that after the
first two or three minutes." She
was right; he hadn't reached the
audience.
His friends in the car agreed,
"It was better at San Jose State.
They were a more radical group,
and you gave them opportunity to
respond. The students there were
angrier, too."
Kunstler is a man in a most
peculiar situation. Since his
defense of the Chicago Eight and
his later dealings with H. Rap
Brown, the New York lawyer has
become a folk hero of the liberal
left. His denunciations of Judge
Hoffman and his manner
throughout the Chicago trial have

symbol. He can command
audiences, but he is unsure what
to tell them. He doesn't want to
direct specific actions, being
unsure of local conditions.
Nonetheless, the crowd asks for it,
and Kunstler the symbol must
reply.
As he rode to the next rally at
Berkeley, his mind raced forward
and moved backwards, to other
rallies, and other crowds. He
didn't know just what to say at
the next stop; he kept on talking
as he searched for some answers.
The ride to Berkeley was over all
too quickly. The man had gotten
some rest and was ready once
more for Kunstler the symbol.
He strode into the Greek

Theater, an hour late, but still on
time. Taking the stage, his voice
cracking with fatigue, he breathed
fire into issues that had never
emerged at White Plaza.
"What I learned at Stanford
today," he declared, "was two
things. If one method won't work,
another must be tried. People on
the scene must determine what's
best to do, but most important,
people must all support each
other. Unite around the end goals
and support each other."
His Stanford speech hadn't
been a total disaster after all;
Kunstler the man was, for a time,
again at ease with Kunstler the
symbol. Kunstler the unifier was
being created.

and Kunstler the symbol must
reply.
As he rode to the next rally at
Berkeley, his mind raced forward
and moved backwards, to other
rallies, and other crowds. He
didn't know just what to say at
the next stop; he kept on talking
as he searched for some answers.
The ride to Berkeley was over all
too quickly. The man had gotten
some rest and was ready once
more for Kunstler the symbol.
He strode into the Greek

Theater, an hour late, but still on
time. Taking the stage, his voice
cracking with fatigue, he breathed
fire into issues that had never
emerged at White Plaza.
"What I learned at Stanford
today," he declared, "was two
things. If one method won't work,
another must be tried. People on
the scene must determine what's
best to do, but most important,
people must all support each
other. Unite around the end goals
and support each other."
His Stanford speech hadn't
been a total disaster after all;
Kunstler the man was, for a time,
again at ease with Kunstler the
symbol. Kunstler the unifier was
being created.

Commentary
A tired and frustrated William
Kunstler stretched out in the back
seat of the car as it sped across the
Dumbarton Bridge.
"I'd like to be a unifier and a
tactician at the same time," he
pondered. "It's never been done
before, but that doesn't mean it's
impossible."
His appearance at Stanford
hadn't been a total success. "It
wasn't a very good speech." said

made him a legend; in his own
mind, he remains confused over
his new power.
Looking For Answers
"They're looking for answers
from you," said one of his
companions, "they want you to
outline something specific to
follow." Kunstler hadn't given the
crowd at Stanford anything big to
shoot for; he wasn't sure what it
was he should have said.
He had failed at Stanford on
two grounds. He had neither made
clear a common goal for all to
work towards, nor had he made
clear that different tactics can
further the same cause.
His goal is hardly new. He
seeks a return to the principles of
freedom and equality that the
nation was founded on. Continual
references to the American
Revolution punctuate his
conversation and his rhetoric.
One of his friends advised him,
"What you should he saying, Bill,
is 'does this help accomplish the
goal?' If it does, then do it."
Kunstler agreed. "Abie
(Hoffman) always says, 'Think,
Act; Think, Act'; you've got to
know what it is you're doing."
Role Confusion
He is clearly torn; Kunstler the
man is uneasy with Kunstler the

his wife, "I knew that after the
first two or three minutes." She
was right; he hadn't reached the
audience.
His friends in the car agreed,
"It was better at San Jose State.
They were a more radical group,
and you gave them opportunity to
respond. The students there were
angrier, too."
Kunstler is a man in a most
peculiar situation. Since his
defense of the Chicago Eight and
his later dealings with H. Rap
Brown, the New York lawyer has
become a folk hero of the liberal
left. His denunciations of Judge
Hoffman and his manner
throughout the Chicago trial have

symbol. He can command
audiences, but he is unsure what
to tell them. He doesn't want to
direct specific actions, being
unsure of local conditions.
Nonetheless, the crowd asks for it,
and Kunstler the symbol must
reply.
