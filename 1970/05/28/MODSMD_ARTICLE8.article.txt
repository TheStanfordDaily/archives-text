# On Freeing All Political Prisoners
## 
### Victor Von Schlegell 
Charles Garry, attorney for the
Black Panthers and currently for
Los Siete, argues that there are
four categories into which crimes
can be divided: crimes of property
and passion, and crimes of politics

and war. He sees the Panthers and
others as "guilty" of war crimes (I
prefer to see them as being tried
for political crimes), although the
prosecuting agencies of Federal
and State governments may indict

them for alleged crimes of
property and passion.
But the distinctions are critical,
and it is through understanding the
distinctions Garry draws that one
can begin to understand and
interpret innumerable false
arrests, harrassments, and delayed
trials which have plagued the
Panthers and other groups
struggling to overcome political
and cultural repression,
In one of their most disputed
points (the Eighth), the Black
Panthers demand that all prisoners
of color be set free, because they
have not had fair trials. Two
recent events underscore then
contention.
First, a few weeks ago, several
Yale students conducted a poll of
potential jurors in New Haven,
and found that eight of ten asked
thought that Bobby Seale was
probably guilty — although the
trial is still weeks in the future.
During the same week, several

Black Panthers who had been in
Fred Hampton's apartment when
agents of the Chicago D.A.'s
office murdered Hampton, were
released from custody, and the
police vindicated of charges of
"overkill" in the Hampton case.
But more often than the
nationally-advertised trials and
proceedings take place occur
examples of summary trial and
judgment. It is at this point that
many break with those who argue
for the objectivity inherent in the
jury system — perhaps it is
functional (if it is possible to
conceive of a fair trial in racist
America), but juries do not
address the establishment of bails
of SI 000 for midemeanors, or
$50,000 assessed in the case of
the New York 21.
The system does not stop
police from beating (and in the
cases of Burnell Mack and Biiav
Sharma and many others,
hospitalizing) suspects.
Thus, even if the jury system

works in the courtroon, relatively
few actually have an opportunity
for redress, and the majority of
those who do enter into trial
proceedings do so with attorneys
provided by the state, who are
already overburdened with heavy
caseloads. Redress through police
channels is absurd. Bobby Seale
gagged and chained in Chicago is
thus only symbolic of the
condition of all peoples of color
in the American judicial system.
Beyond the four categories
Garry uses falls another : crimes of
poor and Black, Brown,
Yellow or Red in America. After
Kent State, the field has come to
encompass Whites as well, but
seemingly only insofar as whites
are political. The six shot in the
back in Augusta, the two students
shot in Jackson, and many other
slaughtered in Orangeville,
Chicago, Watts, Detroit and
elsewhere, the Chicanos murdered
in the 30's, the Indians driven
from their lands to die in the

gutters of the cities — all serve to
point to the racism with which we
must deal in America society.
Jean Genet gives some useful
statist ice — from May 2, 1967 to
September 28, 1968 (when Huey
P. Newton vvas convicted and
sentenced to 15 years in prison),
there were 55 cases recorded
against the Panthers. From
September 28, 1968 to December
9, 1969, there were 373 cases.
130 Panthers were called in for
questioning during the earlier
period, 738 during the later. 5
Panthers were killed during the
former period, 15 during the
latter. And to this date, 28
Panthers have been killed.
But political repression and
racism, working through
American institutions, do not
always assume covert masks. In
the context of liberal capitalism
and democracy, racism is fed not
only with an inadequate system of
justice and cries for law and order
and increased police latitude.

It is fed by companies doing
business in South Africa, such as
Ford, Chase Manhattan Bank and
Bank of America all of which
profit substantially by aggression
against peoples of color in Asia or
by apartheid in South Africa. And
all of which are' objects for
investment by the Board of
Trustees of Stanford University
and other institutions.
It may be too late — indeed,
we may best hope that it is only a
long overdue - but it is crucial
that we begin a reinvestigation of
racism in America, and at
Stanford, and that we begin again
to act against it.
Beyond our efforts here, it is
important that we work for the
release of Bobby Seale. We must
work to keep the spirit of
revolution and liberation alive in
an increasingly oppressive nation.
