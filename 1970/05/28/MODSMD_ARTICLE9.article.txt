# Rhetoric Or Truth?
## 
### Michael Sweeney 
Imperialism.
Exploitation.
Ruling class.
Are these words mere rhetoric or do they have a
precise meaning in describing America?
The words do come from a vocabulary that a
student rarely hears in a high school or college
classroom. Since the anti-communist hysteria after
World War 11, certain facts and ideas have been
censored out of the educational system. A
textbook could not discuss Marx without a careful
apology that such dangerous ideas should be
exposed and refuted.
At a university like Stanford, every nugget of
truth is smothered beneath a ton of bullshit. The
economics department simply ignores socialism in
its undergraduate courses. "Private corporate
investment" is presented as the only solution to
the desperate poverty of the Third World.
In political science courses, the student can find
no straightforward analysis of the way our
supposedly "democratic" governments are bought
and sold like so many pieces of meat. Instead the
professors drone on about such esoteric
irrelevancies as computerized methods to discover
"consensus" among the silent masses.
The same criticisms can be made of sociology,
which neglects the extreme concentration of
political and economic power in a tiny social class;
and of history, which ignores the struggles of
working people and completely distorts post-war
U.S. foreign policy.
But the country is falling apart. The student or
worker who wants to understand why must look
to other sources of information than the castrated
faculty of the university.
A Starting Place
An appropriate starting place might be David
Horowitz's pamphlet, "The Universities and the
Ruling Class: How Wealth Puts Knowledge in Its
Pocket," which reprints articles from Ramparts of
May and August, 1969. The pamphlet is available
for 15 cents from Bay Area Radical Educatioh
Project, 491 Guerrero Street, San Francisco, and is
also sold by the Pacific Studies Center, 1963
University Avenue, East Palo Alto.
Horowitz, now editor of Ramparts, gives a
cogent explanation of how the universities have
been shaped, squeezed and corropted.
The expression "ruling class" is a key to the
radical analysis. William Domhoff's Who Rules
America? ( Prentice Hall, 1 967) shows that an elite
class of the super-rich does indeed exist, and that
this class rules America's corporations,
foundations and government in a manner carefully
designed to defend its position of privilege.
The concentration of wealth and power creates
an economy that Marx predicted in its general
outline 100 years ago. There is chronic instability,
such as our current recession. Massive military
expenditures, great waste, corruption of the
consumer, and a drive to foreign investment are all
necessary outgrowths of modern capitalism.
Economists Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy analyze
the system in Monopoly Capital: An Essay on the

American Social and Economic Order (Monthly
Review, 1966).
Baran's experiences as a Stanford professor are a
good example of how anti-capitalist thought is
hounded out of the universities. A Stanford
trustee heard Baran give a sympathetic speech
about Cuba's struggle to free itself of U.S.
domination in the early 1960'5. Baran had visited
Cuba and advised Castro on economic matters.
The trustees and others raised hell with the
administration, and Baran was invited to leave.
Baran refused, so President Wallace Sterling froze
his salary, citing his "irresponsible" public
remarks. Baran's letters show that his fellow
professors expressed their condolences, but did
nothing. Before the purge a tempt could succeed,
Baran died in 1964.
The War
American capitalism has spread its economic
and political control throughout the "Free
World." Radicals use the words "imperialism" and
"empire" to describe this The Vietnam
War is explained as an imperialist war, fought to
defend existing and future economic interests in
Asia.
Liberals deny this horrible reality. They say that
the war is some kind of "mistake," started out of a
misguided sense of international "commitments."
Two good books are available that demolish these
myths: Carl Oglesby Richard Shaull's
Containment and Change (Macmillan, 1967) and
Gabriel Kolko, The Roots of American Foreign
Policy (Beacon, 1969). Many pamphlets available
from Bay Area REP and Pacific Studies Center
also state the evidence for the imperialist
explanation of American foreign policy.
Raw materials, export markets, and direct
investment are all important in economic motives
of U.S. imperialism. Harry Magdoff documents the
motives of big business in The Age of Imperialism
(Monthly Review, 1969).
The books names fail in one respect: they don't
convey the rage and desperation of the people who
are oppressed by U.S. capitalism. Some books that
do are Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth
(Grove, 1963), William Burchett's Vietnam Will
Win! (Monthly Review, 1968), Eduardo Galeano's
Guatemalo: Occupied Country (Modern Reader,
1967), Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice, and any ol
the REP pamphlets on women's liberation and the
new wave of labor unrest in America.
Books such as these have {â€¢eenforced the lessons
of experience that have been taught to radicals at
Stanford. They show that it is absurd to pretend
that electing a liberal congressman, or 30 liberal
congressmen, will curb the American monster.
xTiey show that it is obscene to continue a
privileged, self-seeking existence while your
government subjugates much of the world.
They know, above all, that no "reform" is
adequate in America short of a revolutionary
struggle to overthrow capitalism
