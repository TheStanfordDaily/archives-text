Wake up, lazy Mary.
The sun's playing your song.
Our popular Sunshine Trio phrases it beautifully in the title above
and in the 3-word chorus: "Welcome back, Stanford."
Its gonna be a great color-fun year, in styles and fashions like
ne re before. And if you've never set foot in The Fashion Wheel,
at the edge of campus, then Molly Bee, let it be.
Let your toes go in a bevy of our boots. Swing into high fashion with
leather pants, skirts, vests and a medley of accessories. Or choose
any jim-dandy apparelâ€”as long as it makes Jim beam from day
to day.
Mr. Sun will always broadcast a special song for Stanford. And
we carry the tune.
