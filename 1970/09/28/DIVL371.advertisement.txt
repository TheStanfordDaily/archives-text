We've got a check plan that's cheap and simple.
It costs $3 a quarter. You can write as many checks as you want. And
there's no monthly service charge. You still get a statement every
month, so you can keep track of your money. You can even keep your
account open during the summer with nothing in it and we won't charge
you a cent. The plan's just for college students. And the only place
you can sign up for it is'at the Old Stanford Farm Office of Wells Fargo
Bank at the Stanford Shopping Center, or at the Palo Alto Office at 400
Hamilton Ave. We don't have a clever name for the service. So just come
in and ask for the check plan you read about in the paper.
(And here are a dozen pictures of our stagecoach so you won't
forget who paid' for this ad.)
