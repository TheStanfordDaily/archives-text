# President Lyman Vows To Defend Campus
## 
### ED KOHN 
Richard W. Lyman, named Thursday
as Stanford's seventh president, said
Friday at a press conference that he
would defend the campus and academic
freedom from attacks made on them by
the Left and by the federal
government.
He termed "potentially ominous" a
plan announced by President Nixon last
week that would permit the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies to
enter campuses to deal with student
disorders.
"Anytime you talk about police on
campus, you are talking about a
melancholy situation," Lyman said.
"But, if there is any overtone
whatsoever of police, federal or
otherwise, coming on campus to
investigate opinion, to check on what
sort of teaching is going on, or to
differentiate between safe and
not-so-safe teaching, that is a very
ominous threat to freedom ot
expression and opinion," he continued.
The newlv-named president was

referring to the FBI investigation at
Kent State University in Ohio where 13
persons, mostly students, were shot -
four fatally - during May
demonstrations.
Criminal Activity
Lyman, who asked police to come
on campus on several occasions last
spring, said that he would do
everything possible to prevent a
recurrence of the violent student-police
confrontations that rocked Stanford
last April and May.
However, he said:
"We have to preserve order, because
if we don't, someone else who does not
understand the delicate tabric of the
University will come in and do it.
"We must cope better than we have
been with outright criminal activity,
because if we can't, someone else will.
As long as the police come to campus
to deal with outright criminal activity,
that's an inevitable part of life and no
one can feel it's out of order.
"One should only feel that it's tragic
that such criminal activity takes place."

Lyman asked the campus to unite
"in a determination not to produce the
kind of circumstance in which a
reasonable man, operating with a great
sense of the undesirability of having to
bring in an armed force at any time,
would nonetheless feel he had to."
"I'm not trying to keep people from
making us, by legitimate means,
confront problems which some of us
may not be terribly eager to confront,"
he said.
Terming his job a "pressure cooker,"
Lyman refused to rule out the
possibility of the University's
permitting a non-violent sit-in:
"The line is between action in which
people get their way by coercing others
and action which does not do that," he
said.
Vacant Posts
Commenting on the large number of
high-level positions currently unfilled in
the University's administration, Lyman
said, "Obviously, we're being hurt." He
said that finding replacements for key
vacancies would be "of first priority."

Presently, the Deanships of the
Medicine Law and Education, the Dean
of Students, and the Business Manager;
are or will become vacant soon. The
post held by Willard Wyman as Special
Assistant to the President is also
unfilled.
The former provost and
vice-president received his appointment
some 20 hours before members of the
freshman class were scheduled to arrive
for preregistration. Lyman's
appointment was approved
unanimously by the Board of Trustees
at a special meeting in their San
Francisco offices.
Selection Process
Rumors had circulated widely
during the past month that Lyman
would be selected and that the trustees
would announce the final decision
before the beginning of the academic
year. Sources indicated that the
trustees did not want to begin the fall
term with the top University position
vacant.
Lyman replaces Kenneth S. Pitzer,

who resigned June 2 5 after a 19-month
presidency. Pitzer attributed his
resignation to increased polarization
between the campus and the
surrounding communities and the
effects of the Indochina War on
American society. In the wake of
violent anti-ROTC and anti-Cambodian
demonstrations last spring, the
University claimed losses estimated at
$580,0 00 and was effectively shut
down by the students for two weeks.
The selection of Lyman was based
on the recommendation of three
committees in addition to the special
subcommittee of the Board of Trustees.
For the first time, students were given a
voice in the selection process as a
seven-member student advisory
committee was appointed in July.
Employees of the University were also
represented for the first time in this
process by four staff members who
served as "consultants" to the faculty
committee. The alumni also appointed
a search committee for the first time.
The votes of the faculty-staff and
trustee committees were unanimous;
the two other committees made no
public report.
Canvass
In a canvass similar to one
conducted by Harvard University
earlier this year, nearly 100,000
persons, including students, staff,
faculty and alumni, were asked to
suggest candidates for the position.
Those questioned were also asked to
suggest special attributes or qualities
that the candidates should possess.
More than 1,000 replies were received.
Files were established on about 200
candidates. After preliminary

investigation, about 75 men and
women received detailed consideration.
While the new president has received
strong praise and support from faculty
members, alumni and trustees, he has
encountered a mixed reception from
some students and staff members,
including several minor disruptions at
Friday night's convocation. A few
members of the student selection group
were reportedly unhappy about the
choice.
One anonymous student committee
member expressed his discontent in his
description of the search process:
"Early in the discussion of the
various committees, code phrases arose
to designate various positions. Those
who spoke for the need for a decision
before fall quarter (primarily faculty
members) were Lyman supporters.
Those who spoke of considering
someone who was not an academician,
but rather an administrator with some
ties to higher education, law and order
advocates. These conservatives
emphasized the problems of University
fund-raising. Those who spoke about
educational innovation (meaning
lessening of faculty privileges) and the
dangers of repression were opponents
of Lyman.
"Among the trustees and alumni,
there was some fear that Lyman was
only a more articulate Pitzer and would
not be able to handle campus
disruptions. Several student committee
members favored a new president who
would wheel and deal with student
leaders behind closed doors and would,
in the course of such negotiations,
honestly present the practical
limitations the University faced."

choice.
One anonymous student committee
member expressed his discontent in his
description of the search process:
"Early in the discussion of the
various committees, code phrases arose
to designate various positions. Those
who spoke for the need for a decision
before fall quarter (primarily faculty
members) were Lyman supporters.
Those who spoke of considering
someone who was not an academician,
but rather an administrator with some
ties to higher education, law and order
advocates. These conservatives
emphasized the problems of University
fund-raising. Those who spoke about
educational innovation (meaning
lessening of faculty privileges) and the
dangers of repression were opponents
of Lyman.
"Among the trustees and alumni,
there was some fear that Lyman was
only a more articulate Pitzer and would
not be able to handle campus
disruptions. Several student committee
members favored a new president who
would wheel and deal with student
leaders behind closed doors and would,
in the course of such negotiations,
honestly present the practical
limitations the University faced."

CONVOCATION - President Richard W. Lyman addressed the class of 19 7 4 in
Memorial Church Friday night. Lyman urged the students to support the
"depoliticized university."
Richard W. Lyman, named Thursday
as Stanford's seventh president, said
Friday at a press conference that he
would defend the campus and academic
freedom from attacks made on them by
the Left and by the federal
government.
He termed "potentially ominous" a
plan announced by President Nixon last
week that would permit the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies to
enter campuses to deal with student
disorders.
"Anytime you talk about police on
campus, you are talking about a
melancholy situation," Lyman said.
"But, if there is any overtone
whatsoever of police, federal or
otherwise, coming on campus to
investigate opinion, to check on what
sort of teaching is going on, or to
differentiate between safe and
not-so-safe teaching, that is a very
ominous threat to freedom ot
expression and opinion," he continued.
The newlv-named president was

referring to the FBI investigation at
Kent State University in Ohio where 13
persons, mostly students, were shot -
four fatally - during May
demonstrations.
Criminal Activity
Lyman, who asked police to come
on campus on several occasions last
spring, said that he would do
everything possible to prevent a
recurrence of the violent student-police
confrontations that rocked Stanford
last April and May.
However, he said:
"We have to preserve order, because
if we don't, someone else who does not
understand the delicate tabric of the
University will come in and do it.
"We must cope better than we have
been with outright criminal activity,
because if we can't, someone else will.
As long as the police come to campus
to deal with outright criminal activity,
that's an inevitable part of life and no
one can feel it's out of order.
"One should only feel that it's tragic
that such criminal activity takes place."

Lyman asked the campus to unite
"in a determination not to produce the
kind of circumstance in which a
reasonable man, operating with a great
sense of the undesirability of having to
bring in an armed force at any time,
would nonetheless feel he had to."
"I'm not trying to keep people from
making us, by legitimate means,
confront problems which some of us
may not be terribly eager to confront,"
he said.
Terming his job a "pressure cooker,"
Lyman refused to rule out the
possibility of the University's
permitting a non-violent sit-in:
"The line is between action in which
people get their way by coercing others
and action which does not do that," he
said.
Vacant Posts
Commenting on the large number of
high-level positions currently unfilled in
the University's administration, Lyman
said, "Obviously, we're being hurt." He
said that finding replacements for key
vacancies would be "of first priority."

Presently, the Deanships of the
Medicine Law and Education, the Dean
of Students, and the Business Manager;
are or will become vacant soon. The
post held by Willard Wyman as Special
Assistant to the President is also
unfilled.
The former provost and
vice-president received his appointment
some 20 hours before members of the
freshman class were scheduled to arrive
for preregistration. Lyman's
appointment was approved
unanimously by the Board of Trustees
at a special meeting in their San
Francisco offices.
Selection Process
Rumors had circulated widely
during the past month that Lyman
would be selected and that the trustees
would announce the final decision
before the beginning of the academic
year. Sources indicated that the
trustees did not want to begin the fall
term with the top University position
vacant.
Lyman replaces Kenneth S. Pitzer,

who resigned June 2 5 after a 19-month
presidency. Pitzer attributed his
resignation to increased polarization
between the campus and the
surrounding communities and the
effects of the Indochina War on
American society. In the wake of
violent anti-ROTC and anti-Cambodian
demonstrations last spring, the
University claimed losses estimated at
$580,0 00 and was effectively shut
down by the students for two weeks.
The selection of Lyman was based
on the recommendation of three
committees in addition to the special
subcommittee of the Board of Trustees.
For the first time, students were given a
voice in the selection process as a
seven-member student advisory
committee was appointed in July.
Employees of the University were also
represented for the first time in this
process by four staff members who
served as "consultants" to the faculty
committee. The alumni also appointed
a search committee for the first time.
The votes of the faculty-staff and
trustee committees were unanimous;
the two other committees made no
public report.
Canvass
In a canvass similar to one
conducted by Harvard University
earlier this year, nearly 100,000
persons, including students, staff,
faculty and alumni, were asked to
suggest candidates for the position.
Those questioned were also asked to
suggest special attributes or qualities
that the candidates should possess.
More than 1,000 replies were received.
Files were established on about 200
candidates. After preliminary

investigation, about 75 men and
women received detailed consideration.
While the new president has received
strong praise and support from faculty
members, alumni and trustees, he has
encountered a mixed reception from
some students and staff members,
including several minor disruptions at
Friday night's convocation. A few
members of the student selection group
were reportedly unhappy about the
choice.

seven-member student advisory
committee was appointed in July.
Employees of the University were also
represented for the first time in this
process by four staff members who
served as "consultants" to the faculty
committee. The alumni also appointed
a search committee for the first time.
The votes of the faculty-staff and
trustee committees were unanimous;
the two other committees made no
public report.
Canvass
In a canvass similar to one
conducted by Harvard University
earlier this year, nearly 100,000
persons, including students, staff,
faculty and alumni, were asked to
suggest candidates for the position.
Those questioned were also asked to
suggest special attributes or qualities
that the candidates should possess.
More than 1,000 replies were received.
Files were established on about 200
candidates. After preliminary

investigation, about 75 men and
women received detailed consideration.
While the new president has received
strong praise and support from faculty
members, alumni and trustees, he has
encountered a mixed reception from
some students and staff members,
including several minor disruptions at
Friday night's convocation. A few
members of the student selection group
were reportedly unhappy about the
choice.
One anonymous student committee
member expressed his discontent in his
description of the search process:
"Early in the discussion of the
various committees, code phrases arose
to designate various positions. Those
who spoke for the need for a decision
before fall quarter (primarily faculty
members) were Lyman supporters.
Those who spoke of considering
someone who was not an academician,
but rather an administrator with some
ties to higher education, law and order
advocates. These conservatives
emphasized the problems of University
fund-raising. Those who spoke about
educational innovation (meaning
lessening of faculty privileges) and the
dangers of repression were opponents
of Lyman.
"Among the trustees and alumni,
there was some fear that Lyman was
only a more articulate Pitzer and would
not be able to handle campus
disruptions. Several student committee
members favored a new president who
would wheel and deal with student
leaders behind closed doors and would,
in the course of such negotiations,
honestly present the practical
limitations the University faced."

CONVOCATION - President Richard W. Lyman addressed the class of 19 7 4 in
Memorial Church Friday night. Lyman urged the students to support the
"depoliticized university."
Richard W. Lyman, named Thursday
as Stanford's seventh president, said
Friday at a press conference that he
would defend the campus and academic
freedom from attacks made on them by
the Left and by the federal
government.
He termed "potentially ominous" a
plan announced by President Nixon last
week that would permit the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies to
enter campuses to deal with student
disorders.
"Anytime you talk about police on
campus, you are talking about a
melancholy situation," Lyman said.
"But, if there is any overtone
whatsoever of police, federal or
otherwise, coming on campus to
investigate opinion, to check on what
sort of teaching is going on, or to
differentiate between safe and
not-so-safe teaching, that is a very
ominous threat to freedom ot
expression and opinion," he continued.
The newlv-named president was

referring to the FBI investigation at
Kent State University in Ohio where 13
persons, mostly students, were shot -
four fatally - during May
demonstrations.
Criminal Activity
Lyman, who asked police to come
on campus on several occasions last
spring, said that he would do
everything possible to prevent a
recurrence of the violent student-police
confrontations that rocked Stanford
last April and May.
However, he said:
"We have to preserve order, because
if we don't, someone else who does not
understand the delicate tabric of the
University will come in and do it.
"We must cope better than we have
been with outright criminal activity,
because if we can't, someone else will.
As long as the police come to campus
to deal with outright criminal activity,
that's an inevitable part of life and no
one can feel it's out of order.
"One should only feel that it's tragic
that such criminal activity takes place."

Lyman asked the campus to unite
"in a determination not to produce the
kind of circumstance in which a
reasonable man, operating with a great
sense of the undesirability of having to
bring in an armed force at any time,
would nonetheless feel he had to."
"I'm not trying to keep people from
making us, by legitimate means,
confront problems which some of us
may not be terribly eager to confront,"
he said.
Terming his job a "pressure cooker,"
Lyman refused to rule out the
possibility of the University's
permitting a non-violent sit-in:
"The line is between action in which
people get their way by coercing others
and action which does not do that," he
said.
Vacant Posts
Commenting on the large number of
high-level positions currently unfilled in
the University's administration, Lyman
said, "Obviously, we're being hurt." He
said that finding replacements for key
vacancies would be "of first priority."

Presently, the Deanships of the
Medicine Law and Education, the Dean
of Students, and the Business Manager;
are or will become vacant soon. The
post held by Willard Wyman as Special
Assistant to the President is also
unfilled.
The former provost and
vice-president received his appointment
some 20 hours before members of the
freshman class were scheduled to arrive
for preregistration. Lyman's
appointment was approved
unanimously by the Board of Trustees
at a special meeting in their San
Francisco offices.
Selection Process
Rumors had circulated widely
during the past month that Lyman
would be selected and that the trustees
would announce the final decision
before the beginning of the academic
year. Sources indicated that the
trustees did not want to begin the fall
term with the top University position
vacant.
Lyman replaces Kenneth S. Pitzer,

who resigned June 2 5 after a 19-month
presidency. Pitzer attributed his
resignation to increased polarization
between the campus and the
surrounding communities and the
effects of the Indochina War on
American society. In the wake of
violent anti-ROTC and anti-Cambodian
demonstrations last spring, the
University claimed losses estimated at
$580,0 00 and was effectively shut
down by the students for two weeks.
The selection of Lyman was based
on the recommendation of three
committees in addition to the special
subcommittee of the Board of Trustees.
For the first time, students were given a
voice in the selection process as a
seven-member student advisory
committee was appointed in July.
Employees of the University were also
