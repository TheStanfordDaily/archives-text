## Easy To Be Hard? 
### eugene schoenfeld, m. d 
"Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
I have a sex problem that has
really been giving me fits lately.
Whenever I get in bed with a girl I
do not stay hard long enough to
have proper coitus. It's not that I
don't get hard at all because I do
easily—especially if the girl should
give me manual stimulation.
In any case, by the time I begin
intercourse I'm too soft. When I
masturbate I have no trouble—so I
think my potency is all right. Or is
it? When I'm with a girl, I get an
erection but it just doesn't last.
I'm 22 and petting is a drag.
Isn't it more normal to stay
hard until one is satisfied?
Apparently my sex drive is weak.
I doubt that it's psychological
because sex doesn't hang me
up—except for this problem.
What do you think?"

ANSWER: Impotency is a very
common sexual problem in older
age groups but relatively rare in
someone your age. Dr. Kinsey
found that less than 1% of males
below the age of 35 suffered from
permanent erectile impotence but
by 70 years of age 27% of the men
in his sample could no longer have
sexual intercourse. But the sexual
potency may continue despite
one's age—Kinsey's study included
an 88 year old man who
continued to have sexual
intercourse with his 9 0 year old
wife!
Masters and Johnson, the sex
research team whose work has
aided millions of people
(including you, perhaps, if you'll
read on) describe two types of
impotency, primary and
secondary. In primary impotency
the male has never been able to
"achieve and/or maintain an
erection quality sufficient to
accomplish successful coital
connections." Masters and
Johnson found that causative
factors in the men they treated
included overbearing mothers, a
suppressive religious background,
self-depreciation and a tendency
toward homosexuality.
Secondary impotence is
diagnosed when a male cannot
achieve coitus in 25% of his
attempts. Occasional episodes of
impotence occur in almost all men
sometime in their lives brought
about by fatigue, recent sexual
activity, overeating, psychological
stresses, and certain drugs, most
commonly alcohol, but including
many tranquilizers. An episode of
impotency caused by one of these
factors shouldn't cause any alarm,
but all too frequently the
humiliation of failure to rise to
the occasion produced by too
many drinks leads to further
failures and a pattern is
established. Fear of failure may so
preoccupy a man he continues to
fail--an illustration of not
knowing there's "nothing to fear
but fear itself."
Failure to achieve sexual
relations caused by a bout with
alcohol was the second most
significant factor in Masters and
Johnson's cases of secondary
impotency. First in importance

was a history of premature
ejaculation, but it shouldn't be
implied most men who suffer
from that problem will necessarily
go on to become impotent
(Masters and Johnson,
incidentally, describe a technique
so effective in treating premature
ejaculation they believe it could
be eliminated as a problem in our
culture). Other factors causing
secondary impotence were
psychosocial influences,
medications, injuries and diseases.
The first step in dealing with
an impotency problem should be
a thorough medical examination
to rule out physical causes.
Diabetes mellitus, for example,
occasionally causes impotence for
some unknown reason. However,
if a male is able to achieve an
erection but not during
intercourse an assumption can be
made that the problem is not in
his body.
Dr. Donald Hastings describes
several types of psychological
impotence in Sexual Expression
In Marriage (Bantam Books
$1.25). One is impotence of
inexperience which he believes is
common in young males, feelings
of "ineptness, a fear of hurting
the girl, an inability to reconcile
the loved female with sexual
passion, feelings of guilt and
wrongdoing, fear of pregnancy"
are given as possible reasons.
Philip Roth describes such an
experience beginning on page 200
of Portnoy's Complaint.
I think you should consult
your family physician—hopefully
he'll have read the portions of
Masters and Johnson's Human
Sexual Inadequacy pertaining to
your problem. You might also try
calling the Department of Mental
Hygiene of your local health
department to learn whether
you're fortunate enough to live in
one of the few cities in the United
States offering clinics qualified to
treat one of mankind's oldest
problems.

humiliation of failure to rise to
the occasion produced by too
many drinks leads to further
failures and a pattern is
established. Fear of failure may so
preoccupy a man he continues to
fail--an illustration of not
knowing there's "nothing to fear
but fear itself."
Failure to achieve sexual
relations caused by a bout with
alcohol was the second most
significant factor in Masters and
Johnson's cases of secondary
impotency. First in importance

was a history of premature
ejaculation, but it shouldn't be
implied most men who suffer
from that problem will necessarily
go on to become impotent
(Masters and Johnson,
incidentally, describe a technique
so effective in treating premature
ejaculation they believe it could
be eliminated as a problem in our
culture). Other factors causing
secondary impotence were
psychosocial influences,
medications, injuries and diseases.
The first step in dealing with
an impotency problem should be
a thorough medical examination
to rule out physical causes.
Diabetes mellitus, for example,
occasionally causes impotence for
some unknown reason. However,
if a male is able to achieve an
erection but not during
intercourse an assumption can be
made that the problem is not in
his body.
Dr. Donald Hastings describes
several types of psychological
impotence in Sexual Expression
In Marriage (Bantam Books
$1.25). One is impotence of
inexperience which he believes is
common in young males, feelings
of "ineptness, a fear of hurting
the girl, an inability to reconcile
the loved female with sexual
passion, feelings of guilt and
wrongdoing, fear of pregnancy"
are given as possible reasons.
Philip Roth describes such an
experience beginning on page 200
of Portnoy's Complaint.
I think you should consult
your family physician—hopefully
he'll have read the portions of
Masters and Johnson's Human
Sexual Inadequacy pertaining to
your problem. You might also try
calling the Department of Mental

department to learn whether
you're fortunate enough to live in

"Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
I have a sex problem that has
really been giving me fits lately.
Whenever I get in bed with a girl I
do not stay hard long enough to
have proper coitus. It's not that I
don't get hard at all because I do
easily—especially if the girl should
give me manual stimulation.
In any case, by the time I begin
intercourse I'm too soft. When I
masturbate I have no trouble—so I
think my potency is all right. Or is
it? When I'm with a girl, I get an
erection but it just doesn't last.
I'm 22 and petting is a drag.
Isn't it more normal to stay
hard until one is satisfied?
Apparently my sex drive is weak.
I doubt that it's psychological
because sex doesn't hang me
up—except for this problem.
What do you think?"

ANSWER: Impotency is a very
common sexual problem in older
age groups but relatively rare in
someone your age. Dr. Kinsey
found that less than 1% of males
below the age of 35 suffered from
permanent erectile impotence but
by 70 years of age 27% of the men
in his sample could no longer have
sexual intercourse. But the sexual
potency may continue despite
one's age—Kinsey's study included
an 88 year old man who
continued to have sexual
intercourse with his 9 0 year old
wife!
Masters and Johnson, the sex
research team whose work has
aided millions of people
(including you, perhaps, if you'll
read on) describe two types of
impotency, primary and
secondary. In primary impotency
the male has never been able to
"achieve and/or maintain an
erection quality sufficient to
accomplish successful coital
connections." Masters and
Johnson found that causative
factors in the men they treated
included overbearing mothers, a
suppressive religious background,
self-depreciation and a tendency
toward homosexuality.
Secondary impotence is
diagnosed when a male cannot
achieve coitus in 25% of his
attempts. Occasional episodes of
impotence occur in almost all men
sometime in their lives brought
about by fatigue, recent sexual
activity, overeating, psychological
stresses, and certain drugs, most
commonly alcohol, but including
many tranquilizers. An episode of
impotency caused by one of these
factors shouldn't cause any alarm,
but all too frequently the
humiliation of failure to rise to
the occasion produced by too
many drinks leads to further
failures and a pattern is
established. Fear of failure may so
preoccupy a man he continues to
fail--an illustration of not
knowing there's "nothing to fear
