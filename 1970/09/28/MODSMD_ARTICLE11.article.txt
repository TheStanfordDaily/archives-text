WASHINGTON
(AP)—President Nixon urged
Congress today to authorize
immediate federal intervention in
cases of bombings or arson on
virtually any college campus and
recommended (he hiring of an
additional 1 ,00 0 FBI agents to do
the job.
These additional agents also
would help combat plane
hijackings.
NixonVs new move was
announced at a White House
briefing by Republican
congressional leaders after they
had met for nearly three hours
with the President, Atty. General
.John N. Mitchell and Director J.
Edgar Hoover of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
Instant Action
As described to newsmen, the
legislation proposed to Congress
would trigger instant federal
intervention when bombings,
arson and terrorist acts affect a
college or university receiving
federal assistance. That includes

virtually all institutions of higher
learning.
Nixon proposed that the FBI
add 1 ,000 agents to deal with
campus outbreaks of the sort
involved and to assist in programs
aimed at thwarting aerial
hijacking. The FBI now has about
7,000 agents.
House GOP Leader Gerald
Ford of Michigan quoted Hoover
as reporting that the organization
Students for a Democratic Society
was directly involved in 24 7 arson
cases and 46 2 personal injury
incidents in the past academic
year. He said these were in
addition to about 300 other
episodes of destruction of other
facilities or property.
Ford, predicting congressional
enactment of the legislation,
declared, "I think it will have a
beneficial effect."
He said instances of campus
terrorism "have increased in
number, tempo and seriousness"
and thus prompted Nixon's
recommendation.
