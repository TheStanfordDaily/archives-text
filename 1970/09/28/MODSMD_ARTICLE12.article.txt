# Pre-Reg Wonders
## Happen Every Fall 
### 
''Well, there wasn't really a lot of dope in my high school-but there was a lot oj marijuana
flying around. "
"It seems that there's just enough black kids around to let you know they re a percentage.
"Wow, they weren t kidding! Its hotter u hell in the day and freezing at night.
"Do people still get drunk around here anymore?"
"Gee, everybody seems so straight in this class. Do you think they recruited them that
way?"
"Wow! 1 just gotta get a car and gel up into those mountains. "
"How come the girls are so overdressed like (hey were going to a perpetual party?"
"Whew! I've never seen so many fine looking chicks in my life. Is this normal for Stanford?'

"Dear mom Today we went to the beach with a groovy bunch of sophomores. They
brought some bread and wine and it was a lot of fun. Tonite's a big party for freshmen at
Tresidder. Sounds pretty good. Tomorrow I'm going to sleep late. Isn 7 life great? "
"Damn, there's just so much to do. I've got to register and get a bike, buy my books and the
new San tana album toothpaste, and maybe finish unpacking. "
"Gee, it's gonna be a real bummer when we have to go to class. "
"Wow! Sly Stone in Frost the night before the SCgame? I'm going to have to get ready for
that a week early. "
"How do I buy student tickets? In the Old Pavillion? Where's that? Across from where?
Encina Ilall?"
"This barbeque is really fine. How do you tell who's a freshman and who's a frat man?"

"This place is kinda like a country club. "
"J dan'l think people go to sleep at night here. Our dorm
kept going strong into 3:00 this morning. / just hope I'll be
able to do some work around here. "
"How do you tell which classes are good ones? "
"Some guy told me that Stanford doesn't flunk people out.
I hope that's still true. "
"My roommate's okay, I guess. But I mean he's not exactly
the greatest guy in the world. "
