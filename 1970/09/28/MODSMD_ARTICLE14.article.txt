# Tunney Outlines Peace Plan
## 
### HERB BOROCK 
In a speech Friday before the
San Francisco Junior Chamber of
Commerce John V. Tunney,
Democratic candidate for the U.S.
Senate, supported a six-point
proposal for a stand-still cease-fire
throughout Vietnam, reaffirmed
his support for the withdrawal of
all United States troops from
Vietnam by June 30 , 1 971 , and
said the Supreme Court should
not rule on the constitutionality
of the war. Tunney declared he
would continue to vote for
Department of Defense
appropriations bills, deplored
President Nixon's handling of the
Middle East situation in the past
eighteen months, and blamed
United Nations Secretary General
U Thant for the 1967 Arab-Israeli
War.
Peace Plan Proposed
Tunney's six point proposal
parallels the one drafted by
Senators Henry Jackson and Hugh
Scott on September 1 of this year.
As part of his proposal Tunney
requests that the President
"demand the safe return of

American prisoners of war now
being held in North Vietnam
before any cease-fire is
implemented." Jackson and Scott
did not make a specific statement
about POWs. The other points,
which are identical in both
proposals, call for an
internationally supervised
cease-fire, a more broadly based
government within South
Vietnam, the holding of prompt
and free elections in which the
NLF can participate, the provision
of adequate safeguards for
freedom of expression, and
economic and medical relief and
assistance to the people of North
and South Vietnam.
An advance press release on
Tunney's speech referred to a
seven point proposal, the seventh
point being the withdrawal of all
United States troops before June
30, 1971. This point did not
appear in either the text of the
speech or the speech itself.
However, in a question and
answer period after the speech,
Tunney said he supported the
McGovern-Hatfield amendment

which originally called for
withdrawal by June 3 0,1971, was
amended to call for withdrawal by
December 31, 19 71, and was t hen
defeated in the Senate.
Rejects "Protest" Vote
When asked whether he would
continue to vote for
appropriations and authorization
bills for the Defense Department
in general, and Vietnam in
particular, Tunney said he would
vote for amendments to reduce
Vietnam-related expenditures, but
if the amendments fail he would
vote for the bill itself. He said
voting against D O D
appropriations bills was a protest
vote only. He noted that votes on
amendments are not recorded in
the House of Representatives, and
that on recorded votes he is
always shown as voting in favor of
military expenditures.
Tunney answered "no" when
he was asked if the
constitutionality of the war
should be ruled upon by the
Supreme Court, lie did not
elaborate. A suit challenging the
constitutionality of the war has
been filed in Federal District
Court in San Francisco by
Stanford Professor Pierre Noyes
and over 800 other plaintiffs. The
suit is scheduled to be heard
Wednesday, September 3 0.
The Riverside Congressman
said President Nixon's handling of

the Middle East situation was
deplorable because the U.S. did
not sell Israel additional jets when
she requested them, did not
acknowledge the existence of
MICIs and SAM3s when they were
first brought into Egypt in the
spring, pretended that the
cease-fire violations did not occur,
and mislead Arabs when Secretary
Rogers said that the U.S. would
follow an even handed policy in
the Middle East.
U.N. Forces Successful
Tunney claimed that United
Nations peace keeping forces had
been quite successful when they
have stayed in the area they were
assigned to. He cited U.N. actions
in the Congo which prevented a
civil war that "would have led to a
communist takeover." He said
that the six-day Arab-Israeli war
occurred because U Thant "lost
his nerve" and pulled out the U.N.
troops guaranteeing the cease fire.
In answer to a question on
United States treaty
commitments, Tunney said that
SEATO "is a complete joke." He
said NATO, SEATO, and CENTO
were good at their inception, but
that they should be reviewed. He
believes NATO is still meaningful
because the nations in it want to
make it meaningful.
Tunney will be on the Stanford
campus October 15 .
