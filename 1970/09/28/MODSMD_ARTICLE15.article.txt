# University Begins Security Measures
## 
### 
The University has taken
extraordinary measures to prevent
campus violence this fall.
Violent protests last spring
quarter resulted in an estimated
$250,000 in damage to University
property.
As the new school year begins,
these precautionary measures have
been taken:
—$90,000 worth of lighting has
been added to protect campus
buildings against hit-and-run
attacks by masked assailants such
as those that took place last
spring.
—The University police force
has been strengthened.
—Starting winter quarter
students will be asked to carry
identification cards, containing
color photographs. Pictures will
be taken starting October 12 and
added to the student body cards
winter quarter. Students can
refuse to have their picture taken
but if they do, they could be
refused check-cashing privileges,
University meal tickets, etc.

—A full-time administrator,
Jon Schwartz, has been assigned
to gather evidence and prosecute
cases involving violations of
University rules.
—A newly strengthened
California anti-trespass law and a
5 0-year-old statute originally
intended to curb the Ku KJux
Klan will be utilized against
non-student disrupters, especially
those who come in disguise.
The identification cards have
initiated a great deal of
controversey because University
officials once considered keeping
a copy of the student pictures.
Some observers feared the
pictures might be used to identify
students participating in peaceful
political protests.
Harvey Hall, registrar, however,
has announced that "only one
picture will be taken and that one
will be placed on the card."
The Daily will print more
detailed information on these new
security measures later in the
week.
