# Riot Losses Explained
## 
### 
During the last few weeks of
May, following the most
disruptive quarter in Stanford's
history, University officials
claimed $580,000 worth of
damage and lost income occurred
during the spring sit-ins, protests
and riots.
While attracting a great amount
of attention, the rock throwing
and vandalism which occured
prior to the first Old Union sit-in
totaled less than $20,000. The
remainder of the damage occured
following the police's break-up of

the two Old Union sit-ins.
The total damage to windows
and other property was $100,000
and research revenue and
overhead not collected amounted
to $92,000. This resulted from
the blockades and sit-ins at the
engineering laboratories, primarily
AEL and ERL.
The largest part of the
remaining costs incurred is the
$25 0,000 spent on salaries and
benefits for the day off declared
by President Pitzer at the end of
the strike week.
