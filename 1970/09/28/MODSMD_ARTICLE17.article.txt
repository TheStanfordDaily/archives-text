# Meyer Committee To Sponsor Political Education Program
## 
### 
A program of political
education including appearances
by several candidates and election
commentators will be presented
this fall under the auspices of
the Committee on Student
Participation in the Political
Process.
The forum, constructed on the
traditional academic mold of
preparing students for responsible
individual action, will be open to
the public. Emphasis will be
placed on the problem of whether
the political system represents all
parts of society fairly, and
whether its response time is fast
enough to meet today's

extraordinary demands.
The committee, appointed last
June by Provost Richard Lyman
and headed by sociology professor
John Meyer, has approached the
electoral process from three
angles: public events, analysis and
academic.
During the summer it invited
all candidates of statewide and
local interest to come to the
campus this fall.
John Tunney, the Democratic
candidate for the Senate, Pete
McCloskey, Republican hopeful
for the House, and his Democratic
opponent, Richard Gomperts,
have agreed to appear. Also

expected are local Congressional
candidates Stuart McLean and his
opponent, incumbent Republican
Charles Gubser.
However, refusals by Ronald
Reagan, George Murphy and Max
Rafferty, Republican candidates
for governor, senator and
superintendant of schools, have
dampened the committee's hopes
for vigorous political interaction.
Democratic gubernatorial
candidate, Jesse Unruh, has
consented to appear, but only if
Reagan also attends.
The committee is continuing to
offer these candidates alternative
formats which might prove to be

more attractive. The original
proposals specified the appearance
of each candidate and his
opponent before a mixture of the
Stanford and outside
communities.
The analytical side of the
program will aim at capsulizing
the election picture both before
and after November 3. Already
confirmed to speak on October 28
is Maryland senator Charles
Mathias.
NBC News commentator John
Chancellor heads the list of other
possible speakers which includes
California pollster Mervin Field
and Casper Weinberger, formerly
of the Reagan budget staff and
the Federal Trade Commission,
and currently the Deputy Director
of the newly-formed Office of
Management and Budget.
In the realm of academia the
committee recommends three
courses in the political science
department offered by Professors
Rozensweig, Page and
Sniederman, a voting behavior
course in the sociology
department, and a SWOPSI course
concerning "The University and
Tax Exemption" which will be
taught by law student Chuck
Brody.


CLEAN AIR â€” Stanford's Gremlin entree into the 197 0 Clean Air Car Race finished first in its
class. However, because it ran on methanol rather than gasoline, it was not considered practical for a
public marketing.
