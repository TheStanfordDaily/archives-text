# Scranton Group Scores Violence, Proposes Nationwide Ceasefire
## 
### HAAS EDWARDS 
WASHINGTON - The President's
Commission on Campus Unrest issued
its strongly-worded final report
Saturday condemning both student and
police violence as "criminal" and asking
the President to exert his influence to
institute a nationwide cease-fire
between warring elements on and off
college campuses.
The commission warned of runaway
repression in American society if the
President should fail to institute such a
cease-fire.
Recalling a familiar Nixon theme,
the commission said, "It is imperative
that the President bring us together
before more lives are lost and more
property destroyed and more
universities disrupted."
After presenting a typed copy of the
367 page report to the President,
former Pennsylvania Governor William
Scranton, the commission's chairman,
said that leadership in reconciling the
nation has been "lacking" since the
student disruptions began last spring.
Scranton termed "unfortunate" the
President's plan to allow the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies to
enter campuses to deal with student
demonstrations whether or not they are
requested by local officials.
Increasing Violence
The division between the present,
established society and the growing
youth culture generates ever-increasing
violence by both sides, the commission
report said. Unless this polarization can
be stopped, the country could dissolve
into conditions approaching civil
war—"a brutal war against all."
The general recommendations of the
commission are as follows:
—". . . Perpetrators of violence must

be identified, removed from the
university as quickly as possible, and
prosecuted vigorously by the
appropriate agencies of law
enforcement."
—"Dissent and peaceful protest are a
valued part of this nation's way of
governing itself. Violence and disorder
are the antithesis of democratic
processes and cannot be tolerated
either on the nation's campuses or
anywhere else."
Unresolved Conflicts
"The roots of student activism lie in
unresolved conflicts in our national life,
but the many defects of the universities
have also fueled campus unrest."
—.. Too many students have
acted irresponsibly and even
dangerously in pursuing their stated
goals and expressing their dissent. Too
many law enforcement officers have
responded with unwarranted harshness
and force in seeking to control
disorder."
"Action—inaction—of government at
all levels have contributed to campus
unrest. The words of some political
leaders have helped to inflame it. Law
enforcement officers have too often
reacted ineptly or overreacted. At
times, their response has degenerated
into uncontrolled violence."
—"The nation has been slow to
resolve the issues of war and race,
which exacerbate divisions within
American society and which have
contributed to the escalation of student
protest and disorder."
Respect
—"All of us must act to prevent
violence, to create understanding and
to reduce the divisiveness and hostility
that divide both the campus and the

country. We must establish respect for
the processes of law and tolerance for
the exercise of dissent on our campus
and in the nation."
The commission offered no
"cure-alls" for the nation at large. It
divided the crisis on college campuses
into two divisions: the crisis of violence
and the crisis of understanding. The
crisis in understanding, said the
commission, evolves from the new,
conflicting youth culture. Citing
increasing intolerance and arrogance
among many members of this culture,
as well as new impulses toward
terrorism, the commission said:
"At the same time, many Americans
have reacted to this emerging culture
with an intolerance of their
own . .. Some even say that when
dissenters are killed, they have brought
death upon themselves . .." i
Survival Threatened
"If this crisis of understanding
endures, the very survival of this nation
will be threatened. A nation driven to
use the weapons of war upon its youth
is a nation on the verge of chaos.
"A nation that has lost the
allegiance of part of its youth is a
nation that has lost part of its future.
"A nation whose young have
become intolerant of the rest of its
citizenry and intolerant of all
traditional values simply because they
are traditional has no generation
worthy or capable of assuming
leadership in the years to come."
President Lyman displayed mixed
reactions to the report.
"In general, there is a great deal in
the report which is sort of
unarguable—violence is bad, change is
good—that kind of stuff," he said.
Exhortations
Lyman said that the one major
problem is "believing that the people
who are doing the firing are going to
heed it."
"Exhortations," he said, "are fine,
but one has to be skeptical about the
value of exhortations themselves."
The new president said that one of
his strong points of disagreement with
the report is the commission's
contention that university faculties
".. . have become so involved in
outside research that their commitment

to teaching seems compromised."
He expressed agreement with the
next statement in the report, however,
which states that universities and
faculty members should reduce their
"outside service commitments."
Tone of Urgency
He said that the report contains "a
tone of urgency ... a tone of almost
desparation ... for Americans to get
together."
(Complete Scranton Commission
recommendations for the universities
will be carried in the Daily later this
weeK.)
Bayless Manning, retiring dean of
the Law School and a/ member of the
nine-member panel, was out of town
and could not be reached for comment.
The Scranton Commission was
appointed by the President in June
after students were shot and killed on
the Kent State University and Jackson
State College campuses. Its purpose was
to investigate the underlying causes of
campus unrest, propose solutions, and
file a report with the President before
October 1. Investigative reports on the
Kent State and Jackson State killings
will be issued next week.
