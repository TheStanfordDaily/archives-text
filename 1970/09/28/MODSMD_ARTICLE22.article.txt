# Cruising For Burgers At S.U.
## 
### TONY OLCOTT 
Consider the poor hamburger,
cornerstone of America's
gastronomic edifice. We have all
eaten one but do we really know
Hamburger? The answer, of
course, is probably not, which
makes the search for the perfect
burger a very aimless search.
Stanford can, if you so desire,
be envisioned as a verdant pristine
island whose gentle shores are
lashed by an angry sea of taco
stands, billiard halls, and financial
centers. To find a good burger in
this mess is difficult. Fortunately,
to find just any old burger is a
simple matter and the poor
student driven from school by will
or by necessity often chooses
will-he nill-he, much to his
chagrin.

For example, he might be
tempted off to Jack in the Box.
After all, it is only a matter of
minutes south on El Camino. But
let the traveler beware. This
reporter requested of the
mechanical Jack taking orders a
Jumbo burger, fries, and a Jack
cola. Jack makes his own.
A brief digression to explain
the criterion for judgement. It is
the melancholy truth that there is
no right and true judge of burgs.
Unlike bowling there is no ceiling,
no top. Unlike golf, there is no
handicap. Thus one is forced to
relative standards to judge, like
curling, how near the mark it
comes. Thus I was guided by a)
taste and b) aftereffects.)
Slops-ln-The-Box
A Jack Jumbo comes with two
patties resembling recently

divided paremecia; small. The
burger is further hampered by a
garden of shredded lettuce. All is
nearly redeemed by a bath of
secret sauce but one must be
extremely hungry to eat one.
Since the meat seems quite bready
though, one must admit a Jumbo
is very filling. In the end result
however, the best thing about a
Jack burger is how quickly one
can return to campus.
The cola is interesting, for it
tastes like it has been liberally
laced with Scotch, but criterion
(b) finds Jack and his cola and his
fries at the bottom of the list. The
resultant indigestion was
nauseating and long-lived. In
conclusion it can be said that
Jack's doesn't even have a very
good parking lot, since no one can
see your pecker car from the road.

The A&W, in the other
direction, farther north on El
Camino, is the opposite. It has an
excellent parking lot, filled with
hundreds of snappy wheels. It has
several car hops who studied at
the Nancy Sinatra School of
Curb-Side Service, and it has an
indoor dining area with a non-stop
gas fireplace. The food, too, while
basically revolving around the
principle of speed ingestation, is
better.
A&W also has the well-known
Burger Family, but I have never
known anyone to actually be
brave enough to order a teen
burger. Thus we will talk only of
the Papa.
For 79c one receives not only a
piece of meat of adequate size and
ill-defined parentage, but lettuce,
a tomato slice, and a Bermuda
onion! And all this lovingly
clasped in the arms of a sesame
bun. All of which, well lubricated
by that first cousin of Jack's

secret sauce, SPECIAL sauce,
makes the A&W burger the most
slippery available.
Good Karma Burgers
But one can, after all, eat it.
The fries are good also, if covered
with barb-cue sauce, and that
famous A&W root beer, served in
frosty mugs (it tastes good until
you discover there is a pound of
sugar in every gallon) leaving you
sitting in the car, content, full,
and at peace with the world.
This is approximately when
you remember that A&W is owned
by United Fruit Co. and you have
just worsened the lot of one more
Central American. What can you
do? The only decent thing; make
a day of it and take your guilty
liberal tummy over to
Baskin-Robbins and have some
United Fruit dessert.
There is a second, more muted
strain in the symphony of
American ready-to-eat foods, that
of the quality burger joint. Such a

place is Kirk's, which has moved
to a more sedate location on
California street in P.A. Here one
finds a brick decor, an al fresco
garden with a gurgling fountain,
and real Colonial shutters covering
the air-conditioning unit on the
roof. They serve only burgers here
and they charge accordingly: 85c
for the beast, an extra dime for
cheese.
Hi Kwal-i-tee
On the bright side, however,
each burger is bar-b-qued
individually and right before your
very eyes by the very lovely
attendants. One even feels a
humanitarian thrill in eating there,
as the dears are trying to get to
secretarial schools. So it is a
pleasure to stand gazing into the
dancing charcoal flames and
listening to their sprightly
conversation, while your burger
bakes.
They have no fries at Kirk's.
This is a high-class place,

remember. They do have a far
better feature in a relish bar which
features not only the normal
ketchup, mustard, and chopped
onions, but vats and vats of
pickled peppers, cauliflower, and
pickles.
To be fair, it must be said that
Kirk's are all burgers, no bread.
They are larger than Jack's and
slightly smaller than A&Ws. In
fact, they are very like the ones
you remember from lovely
summer evenings when, choking
from smoke and tasting of
mosquito spray you used to sit
and eat charred momentoes of
whatever meat had been so
unfortunate as to fall into the
hands of Dad, the nebish.
Kirk's burgers are erratic.
Sometimes they are pink,
sometimes burnt is a kind
understatement. Sometimes the
cheese is like hot tar on your
hands, sometimes like a brick. It
all depends.
