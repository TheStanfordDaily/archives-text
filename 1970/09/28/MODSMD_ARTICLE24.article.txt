# The 						Best Things In Life Are Here
## 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
Stanford students eat, drink,
-vear clothes, travel, read, and
listen to music. Unsurprisingly,
local merchants have recognized
this fact, and as a consequence, all
the amenities of college-student
good time living are easily
accessible in the Stanford-Mid-
Peninsula area. A brief summary
of the most interesting, essential,
or convenient follows.
FOOD: The Stanford student
has been provided with an
abundance of eating
establishments. Two of the most
traditional are The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de Los Pulgas,
Menlo Park) and The Oasis (241
El Camino, Menlo Park). They
specialize in beer and hamburgers,
and generations of Stanford
students have made their marks
on the old wooden tables which
form the principle furnishings of
both.
Plastic franchises line the El
Camino— cardboard tacos, paper
towel sandwiches, and stringy
chicken are not hard to find if
you want them. House of Pies, at
185 University in Palo Alto, is
brand-new, and serves dozens of
different kinds of pie, with free
ice cream. It's open until midnight
during the week, 2 a.m. on
weekends.
Stickney's, at 3398 El Camino,
is open all night if you are
desperate. Kirk's, (361 California,
P. A.) has fine char-broiled
hamburgers, and good milkshakes
and is not too expensive.
The Full Circle, on University
Avenue at El Camino, will be
open 24 hours this fall. Full Circle
is a cooperative, operated and
owned by the community, and it
fills a variety of needs. It serves as
a gathering place for a number of
political and other groups, offers
music on Friday, Saturday and
Monday nights (small cover charge
for this) and sells the only
Neapolitan thick crust pizza in the
Bay area. Available at reasonable
prices are salads, a wide variety of
expressos and teas, hamburgers,
and a brown rice and vegetable
special.
Grocery stores are the same
everywhere, freezing cold, big and
not so interesting. An exception
to this is the very new New Era
Natural Foods (260 California
Avenue, P.A.), which is a
supermarket-sized health food
place. They have an amazing
selection of certified organic
vegetables, grains, flours, honey,
and dairy products, as well as a
delicatessen which offers samples.
Prices are very good, and
everything is displayed in barrels
or on wooden shelves, which
makes the whole thing nice to
look at.

RECORDS: World Indoor
Records, (4 05 Kipling, Palo Alto)
is small and pleasant, and usually
has bootlegs at low prices.
Discount Records at 915 El
Camino is part of a chain which is
slowly but surely covering the
nation, and has a fairly good
selection of obscure and foreign
records, as well as the current
ones. Tower Records, at
Columbus and Bay in San
Francisco, near Fisherman's
Wharf, calls itself the biggest
record store in the world, and it
could be true.
LIVE MUSIC: There's not too
much on or around campus, with
the exception of the Full Circle,
Tresidder, and occasional
performances at Stanford. Sly and
the Family Stone are supposed to
be here the night before the USC
game, but as all Chicagoans know,
sometimes they don't show up.
Bill Graham takes care of
things in San Francisco at the
Fillmore and Winterland, and at
the Berkeley Community Theater
when necessary. Usually it's big
names at high prices in extremely
crowded and stuffy surroundings,
but worth it just the same. The
Fillmore is at Van Ness and
Market, and to get there take 101
to Van Ness and keep going for
about two blocks. Winterland is at
Post and Steiner.
MOVIES: The campus is
crawling with them, there's
dozens every week, most
benefiting all manner of good
causes. The Sunday flicks are the
most famous. Shown in Mem Aud
every Sunday evening by the
ASSU, they are a full-color 50c
extravaganza demonstrating just
what that infamous ratio can do
for the social behavior of
freshman boys and others.
San Francisco usually has all
the new Hollywood movies and a
good selection of old,
experimental, pornographic, and
foreign films. Palo Alto and
neighboring towns have a number
of theaters which for the most
part are nothing out of the
ordinary. Tickets are expensive in
both places.
TRANSPORTATION: Getting
around on campus is easiest with a
bicycle. Used ones are virtually
impossible to find, so unless you
are not above ripping off someone
else's, expect to buy one new. The
Stanford Bike Shop has some, as
do Smith's, on University just
across the El Camino, and the
Palo Alto Sport Shop, 5 26-34
Waverly St. Sears, at the San
Antonio Shopping Center, sells
good bicycles at lower prices if
you're up for putting them
together yourself.
Hitching is usually safe and
easy, and legal if you have one

PEACEFUL—Living is easy down on the Farm.

foot on the curb and are not
standing on an expressway. San
Francisco is considering outlawing
hitchhiking within the city limits,
so be careful.
BOOKS: The Stanford
Bookstore is certainly convenient,
and does its best to provide what's
necessary for classes. Kepler's sells
many many paperback books and
periodicals of all sorts in a very
hip atmosphere. (825 El Camino,
Menlo Park, and El Camino, and
San Antonio, Los Altos) The
Plowshare, Community
Booksellers, 162 University Ave.,
in Palo Alto, is run by fine people,
on a very loose basis. They are
willing to order what they don't
have for you, and are open late
most nights.

FURNISHING: Dormitory
rooms are notoriously unpleasant
and antiseptic to live in, but a
certain amount of redecoration
can help. Cost Plus in San
Francisco (an enormous complex
starting at 2552 Taylor) sells
imports from all over at extremely
cheap prices. They can sell you
the ever-popular Indian
bedspread, hammocks, rugs,
furniture, clothes, jewelry, and
enough candles to burn down all
of Palo Alto, plus untold numbers
of other things. Cost-Plus also
runs a smaller establishment at the
Mayfield Mall, San Antonio Rd,
Mountainview.
On a less grandiose scale, Just
Egypt (3606 El Camino, Palo
Alto) has used furniture and often

has some interesting surprises,
usually very inexpensive.
GENERAL: There are two
large shopping centers near
Stanford which can serve most
purposes. Town and Country, at
El Camino and Embarcadero, was
constructed with a view towards
high-priced rustic charm, but
behind those cunning arbors is a
heart of highly polished steel.
The Stanford Shopping Center
has all the big department stores,
including Saks, Macy's, I.and
Joseph Magnin's and the
Emporium. It's classy and
expensive, and although there was
a story floating around that some
woman was raped in broad
daylight in the parking lot, it
seems extremely improbable, to
say the least.

Records, (4 05 Kipling, Palo Alto)
is small and pleasant, and usually
has bootlegs at low prices.
Discount Records at 915 El
Camino is part of a chain which is
slowly but surely covering the
nation, and has a fairly good
selection of obscure and foreign
records, as well as the current
ones. Tower Records, at
Columbus and Bay in San
Francisco, near Fisherman's
Wharf, calls itself the biggest
record store in the world, and it
could be true.
LIVE MUSIC: There's not too
much on or around campus, with
the exception of the Full Circle,
Tresidder, and occasional
performances at Stanford. Sly and
the Family Stone are supposed to
be here the night before the USC
game, but as all Chicagoans know,
sometimes they don't show up.
Bill Graham takes care of
things in San Francisco at the
Fillmore and Winterland, and at
the Berkeley Community Theater
when necessary. Usually it's big
names at high prices in extremely
crowded and stuffy surroundings,
but worth it just the same. The
Fillmore is at Van Ness and
Market, and to get there take 101
to Van Ness and keep going for
about two blocks. Winterland is at
Post and Steiner.
MOVIES: The campus is
crawling with them, there's
dozens every week, most
benefiting all manner of good
causes. The Sunday flicks are the
most famous. Shown in Mem Aud
every Sunday evening by the
ASSU, they are a full-color 50c
extravaganza demonstrating just
what that infamous ratio can do
for the social behavior of
freshman boys and others.
San Francisco usually has all
the new Hollywood movies and a
good selection of old,
experimental, pornographic, and
foreign films. Palo Alto and
neighboring towns have a number
of theaters which for the most
part are nothing out of the
ordinary. Tickets are expensive in
both places.
TRANSPORTATION: Getting
around on campus is easiest with a
bicycle. Used ones are virtually
impossible to find, so unless you
are not above ripping off someone
else's, expect to buy one new. The
Stanford Bike Shop has some, as
do Smith's, on University just
across the El Camino, and the
Palo Alto Sport Shop, 5 26-34
Waverly St. Sears, at the San
Antonio Shopping Center, sells
good bicycles at lower prices if
you're up for putting them
together yourself.

foot on the curb and are not
standing on an expressway. San
Francisco is considering outlawing
hitchhiking within the city limits,
so be careful.
BOOKS: The Stanford
Bookstore is certainly convenient,
and does its best to provide what's
necessary for classes. Kepler's sells
many many paperback books and
periodicals of all sorts in a very
hip atmosphere. (825 El Camino,
Menlo Park, and El Camino, and
San Antonio, Los Altos) The
Plowshare, Community
Booksellers, 162 University Ave.,
in Palo Alto, is run by fine people,
on a very loose basis. They are
willing to order what they don't
have for you, and are open late
most nights.

FURNISHING: Dormitory
rooms are notoriously unpleasant
and antiseptic to live in, but a
certain amount of redecoration
can help. Cost Plus in San
Francisco (an enormous complex
starting at 2552 Taylor) sells
imports from all over at extremely
cheap prices. They can sell you
the ever-popular Indian
bedspread, hammocks, rugs,
furniture, clothes, jewelry, and
enough candles to burn down all
of Palo Alto, plus untold numbers
of other things. Cost-Plus also
runs a smaller establishment at the
Mayfield Mall, San Antonio Rd,
Mountainview.
On a less grandiose scale, Just
Egypt (3606 El Camino, Palo
Alto) has used furniture and often

has some interesting surprises,
usually very inexpensive.
GENERAL: There are two
large shopping centers near
Stanford which can serve most
purposes. Town and Country, at
El Camino and Embarcadero, was
constructed with a view towards
high-priced rustic charm, but
behind those cunning arbors is a
heart of highly polished steel.
The Stanford Shopping Center
has all the big department stores,
including Saks, Macy's, I.and
Joseph Magnin's and the
Emporium. It's classy and
expensive, and although there was
a story floating around that some
woman was raped in broad
daylight in the parking lot, it
seems extremely improbable, to
say the least.

Stanford students eat, drink,
-vear clothes, travel, read, and
listen to music. Unsurprisingly,
local merchants have recognized
this fact, and as a consequence, all
the amenities of college-student
good time living are easily
accessible in the Stanford-Mid-
Peninsula area. A brief summary
of the most interesting, essential,
or convenient follows.
FOOD: The Stanford student
has been provided with an
abundance of eating
establishments. Two of the most
traditional are The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de Los Pulgas,
Menlo Park) and The Oasis (241
El Camino, Menlo Park). They
specialize in beer and hamburgers,
and generations of Stanford
students have made their marks
on the old wooden tables which
form the principle furnishings of
both.
Plastic franchises line the El
Camino— cardboard tacos, paper
towel sandwiches, and stringy
chicken are not hard to find if
you want them. House of Pies, at
185 University in Palo Alto, is
brand-new, and serves dozens of
different kinds of pie, with free
ice cream. It's open until midnight
during the week, 2 a.m. on
weekends.
Stickney's, at 3398 El Camino,
is open all night if you are
desperate. Kirk's, (361 California,
P. A.) has fine char-broiled
hamburgers, and good milkshakes
and is not too expensive.
The Full Circle, on University
Avenue at El Camino, will be
open 24 hours this fall. Full Circle
is a cooperative, operated and
owned by the community, and it
fills a variety of needs. It serves as
a gathering place for a number of
political and other groups, offers
music on Friday, Saturday and
Monday nights (small cover charge
for this) and sells the only
Neapolitan thick crust pizza in the
Bay area. Available at reasonable
prices are salads, a wide variety of
expressos and teas, hamburgers,
and a brown rice and vegetable
special.
Grocery stores are the same
everywhere, freezing cold, big and
not so interesting. An exception
to this is the very new New Era
Natural Foods (260 California
Avenue, P.A.), which is a
supermarket-sized health food
place. They have an amazing
selection of certified organic
vegetables, grains, flours, honey,
and dairy products, as well as a
delicatessen which offers samples.
Prices are very good, and
everything is displayed in barrels
or on wooden shelves, which
makes the whole thing nice to
look at.

Francisco is considering outlawing
hitchhiking within the city limits,
so be careful.
BOOKS: The Stanford
Bookstore is certainly convenient,
and does its best to provide what's
necessary for classes. Kepler's sells
many many paperback books and
periodicals of all sorts in a very
hip atmosphere. (825 El Camino,
Menlo Park, and El Camino, and
San Antonio, Los Altos) The
Plowshare, Community
Booksellers, 162 University Ave.,
in Palo Alto, is run by fine people,
on a very loose basis. They are
willing to order what they don't
have for you, and are open late
most nights.

FURNISHING: Dormitory
rooms are notoriously unpleasant
and antiseptic to live in, but a
certain amount of redecoration
can help. Cost Plus in San
Francisco (an enormous complex
starting at 2552 Taylor) sells
imports from all over at extremely
cheap prices. They can sell you
the ever-popular Indian
bedspread, hammocks, rugs,
furniture, clothes, jewelry, and
enough candles to burn down all
of Palo Alto, plus untold numbers
of other things. Cost-Plus also
runs a smaller establishment at the
Mayfield Mall, San Antonio Rd,
Mountainview.
On a less grandiose scale, Just
Egypt (3606 El Camino, Palo
Alto) has used furniture and often

has some interesting surprises,
usually very inexpensive.
GENERAL: There are two
large shopping centers near
Stanford which can serve most
purposes. Town and Country, at
El Camino and Embarcadero, was
constructed with a view towards
high-priced rustic charm, but
behind those cunning arbors is a
heart of highly polished steel.
The Stanford Shopping Center
has all the big department stores,
including Saks, Macy's, I.and
Joseph Magnin's and the
Emporium. It's classy and
expensive, and although there was
a story floating around that some
woman was raped in broad
daylight in the parking lot, it
seems extremely improbable, to
say the least.

Stanford students eat, drink,
-vear clothes, travel, read, and
listen to music. Unsurprisingly,
local merchants have recognized
this fact, and as a consequence, all
the amenities of college-student
good time living are easily
accessible in the Stanford-Mid-
Peninsula area. A brief summary
of the most interesting, essential,
or convenient follows.
FOOD: The Stanford student
has been provided with an
abundance of eating
establishments. Two of the most
traditional are The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de Los Pulgas,
Menlo Park) and The Oasis (241
El Camino, Menlo Park). They
specialize in beer and hamburgers,
and generations of Stanford
students have made their marks
on the old wooden tables which
form the principle furnishings of
both.
Plastic franchises line the El
Camino— cardboard tacos, paper
towel sandwiches, and stringy
chicken are not hard to find if
you want them. House of Pies, at
185 University in Palo Alto, is
brand-new, and serves dozens of
different kinds of pie, with free
ice cream. It's open until midnight
during the week, 2 a.m. on
weekends.
Stickney's, at 3398 El Camino,
is open all night if you are
desperate. Kirk's, (361 California,
P. A.) has fine char-broiled
hamburgers, and good milkshakes
and is not too expensive.
The Full Circle, on University
Avenue at El Camino, will be
open 24 hours this fall. Full Circle
is a cooperative, operated and
owned by the community, and it
fills a variety of needs. It serves as
a gathering place for a number of
political and other groups, offers
music on Friday, Saturday and
Monday nights (small cover charge
for this) and sells the only
Neapolitan thick crust pizza in the
Bay area. Available at reasonable
prices are salads, a wide variety of
expressos and teas, hamburgers,
and a brown rice and vegetable
special.
Grocery stores are the same
everywhere, freezing cold, big and
not so interesting. An exception
to this is the very new New Era
Natural Foods (260 California
Avenue, P.A.), which is a
supermarket-sized health food
place. They have an amazing
selection of certified organic
vegetables, grains, flours, honey,
and dairy products, as well as a
delicatessen which offers samples.
Prices are very good, and
everything is displayed in barrels
or on wooden shelves, which
makes the whole thing nice to
look at.

RECORDS: World Indoor
Records, (4 05 Kipling, Palo Alto)
is small and pleasant, and usually
has bootlegs at low prices.
Discount Records at 915 El
Camino is part of a chain which is
slowly but surely covering the
nation, and has a fairly good
selection of obscure and foreign
records, as well as the current
ones. Tower Records, at
Columbus and Bay in San
Francisco, near Fisherman's
Wharf, calls itself the biggest
record store in the world, and it
could be true.
LIVE MUSIC: There's not too
much on or around campus, with
the exception of the Full Circle,
Tresidder, and occasional
performances at Stanford. Sly and
the Family Stone are supposed to
be here the night before the USC
game, but as all Chicagoans know,
sometimes they don't show up.
Bill Graham takes care of
things in San Francisco at the
Fillmore and Winterland, and at
the Berkeley Community Theater
when necessary. Usually it's big
names at high prices in extremely
crowded and stuffy surroundings,
but worth it just the same. The
Fillmore is at Van Ness and
Market, and to get there take 101
to Van Ness and keep going for
about two blocks. Winterland is at
Post and Steiner.
MOVIES: The campus is
crawling with them, there's
dozens every week, most
benefiting all manner of good
causes. The Sunday flicks are the
most famous. Shown in Mem Aud
every Sunday evening by the
ASSU, they are a full-color 50c
extravaganza demonstrating just
what that infamous ratio can do
for the social behavior of
freshman boys and others.
San Francisco usually has all
the new Hollywood movies and a
good selection of old,
experimental, pornographic, and
foreign films. Palo Alto and
neighboring towns have a number
of theaters which for the most
part are nothing out of the
ordinary. Tickets are expensive in
both places.
TRANSPORTATION: Getting
around on campus is easiest with a
bicycle. Used ones are virtually
impossible to find, so unless you
are not above ripping off someone
else's, expect to buy one new. The
Stanford Bike Shop has some, as
do Smith's, on University just
across the El Camino, and the
Palo Alto Sport Shop, 5 26-34
Waverly St. Sears, at the San
Antonio Shopping Center, sells
good bicycles at lower prices if
you're up for putting them
together yourself.
Hitching is usually safe and
easy, and legal if you have one
