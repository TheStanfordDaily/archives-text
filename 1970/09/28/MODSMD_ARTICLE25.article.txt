## Stanford Ranked Third 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Just before six o'clock a couple
of Saturdays ago, a terribly empty
feeling went through my whole
body. I looked around and could
sense that my friends felt the
same. For as we and twenty five
million other people looked on, it
appeared as though Stanford was
on the verge of another tragic
defeat.
The Indians had come out
against Arkansas playing like the
Kansas City Chiefs, but a
combination of heat, humidity
and some costly errors had all but
defeated the Indians.
I
Arkansas had the ball inside
Stanford's five with a fourth
down and one and 29 seconds
left. As Bill Montgomery, the
Razorback's quarterback came up
to the line I sat in shock. All I
could think about were USC's
Ron Ayala and Purdue's Mike
Phipps who last year had turned
seeming Stanford victories into
heartbreaking losses. I couldn't
stand to see it happen again.
Finally, Montgomery took the
snap and rolled to his left looking

for ace end Chuck Dicus. But
Dicus was covered and
Montgomery kept the ball. As
hearts stopped Jeff Siemon
narrowly missed him, but outside
linebacker Mike Simone came up
and smacked Montgomery at the
four yard line. As everyone waited
breathlessly, the down markers
were brought out.
But before they were placed,
Stanford tackle Bill Alexander
signaled that it was the Indian's
ball and the agony was over.
Stanford had done it! Myself
and every other Card rooter in the
country must have gone wild at
that moment, for Stanford had
finally taken a big one. Now the
game can be looked back at and
recognized as one of the greatest
victories in Stanford's history.
In the first quarter of the game
the Indians were superb. Led by
the hard running of fullback
Hillary Shockley and the pinpoint
passing of Jim Plunkett the Tribe
moved out to an early 14-0 lead.
Before the second quarter was
even half over the Indians had
added two more tallies on a 61

yard punt runback by sophomore
Eric Cross and a perfectly
executed 67 yard drive.
Plunkett's early performance
was so brilliant that veteran coach
and broadcaster Bud Wilkinson
called it the finest performance he
had ever seen by a college
quarterback. Although bothered
in the later going by the terrible
heat and humidity, Plunkett
ended up hitting on 22 of 39
passes for 262 yards.
But Plunkett was by no means
the whole story. Junior running
back Hillary Shockley scored
three touchdowns and proved
without any doubt that Stanford's
running game would be tough.
But the big surprise had to be
the defense. Everyone knew that
the Card's front four would be
tough, but the performance of the
linebackers, Siemon, Simone and
converted tight end Ron Kadziel
was outstanding. And in the
secondary, Bennie Barnes, a
transfer from Contra Costa JC, did
a great job filling in for the
injured Miles Moore.
After enjoying their 34-28 win
for a week, the Indians returned
to Stanford Stadium on the 19th
to face local foe San Jose State.
Oh, the Spartans had definitely
improved from the team that
Stanford had humiliated two
years in a row by scores of 68-20
and 63-21; but they still weren't
any match for the Tribe.
While barely dipping into their
repertoire of plays and while
letting almost everyone see action,
the Indians breezed past SJS 34-3.
Flanker Randy Vataha caught 5
passes for 145 yards and one
touchdown and earned the Pac-8
offensive player of the week
award. Plunkett only played for a
little more than half of the game,
but he still hit on 17 of 29
attempts for 302 yards.
The Indians scored first on a
one yard run by Shockley which
culminated a 60 yard drive. As
time ran out in the first period
Vataha made a diving, disputed
catch of a Plunkett pass in the
right corner of the end zone to

give the Indians their second
score. Halfback Jackie Brown,
who made ten receptions against
Arkansas, scored Stanford's third
touchdown on a 2 yard run.
After San Jose got their only
tally of the day, a 36 yard field
goal by Larry Barnes, Eric Cross
scored from 4 yards out to give
the Tribe a 28-3 halftime
advantage.
The second half was enough to
put almost anyone to sleep. Steve
Horowitz accounted for the only
scoring on 38 and 39 yard
field goals. The only other action
was provided by Stanford's
backup quarterbacks, Jess Freitas
and Mike Boryla, who looked
fairly impressive in their debuts.
Another sophomore, tight end
Bill Scott, looked good in catching
4 passes for 47 yards after taking
over for Bob Moore who was
ejected in the second quarter.
San Jose did have one bonafide
star in defensive player of the
game, linebacker Dave Chaney,
who was credited with 20 tackles.
But other than Chaney and a few
others, the Spartans were
hopelessly lost against a far
superior Stanford squad.
Statistics released after the
State game showed that Stanford
had piled up 932 yards total
offense in their first two games;
632 through the air and 300 on
the ground. Vataha lead in pass
receptions with 8 for 166 yards,
while Shockley was the leading
rusher with 156 yards in 37
carries.
Following their thrilling
victory over Arkansas and their
not-so-thrilling win over SJS, the
Indians find themselves ranked
third in the nation according to
the latest Associated Press
rankings. The Indian's highest
ranking nationally in recent years
was 7th in 1951.
Ironically enough, 1951 is also
the last year Stanford made it to
the Rose Bowl. According to a lot
of sources, including Sports
Illustrated, Playboy, and others,
we won't make it this year either.
But strangely enough all those
sources also saw us losing to
Arkansas. Maybe we'll all just
have to wait and see.

defeated the Indians.
I
Arkansas had the ball inside
Stanford's five with a fourth
down and one and 29 seconds
left. As Bill Montgomery, the
Razorback's quarterback came up
to the line I sat in shock. All I
could think about were USC's
Ron Ayala and Purdue's Mike
Phipps who last year had turned
seeming Stanford victories into
heartbreaking losses. I couldn't
stand to see it happen again.
Finally, Montgomery took the
snap and rolled to his left looking

for ace end Chuck Dicus. But
Dicus was covered and
Montgomery kept the ball. As
hearts stopped Jeff Siemon
narrowly missed him, but outside
linebacker Mike Simone came up
and smacked Montgomery at the
four yard line. As everyone waited
breathlessly, the down markers
were brought out.
But before they were placed,
Stanford tackle Bill Alexander
signaled that it was the Indian's
ball and the agony was over.
Stanford had done it! Myself
and every other Card rooter in the
country must have gone wild at
that moment, for Stanford had
finally taken a big one. Now the
game can be looked back at and
recognized as one of the greatest
victories in Stanford's history.
In the first quarter of the game
the Indians were superb. Led by
the hard running of fullback
Hillary Shockley and the pinpoint
passing of Jim Plunkett the Tribe
moved out to an early 14-0 lead.
Before the second quarter was
even half over the Indians had
added two more tallies on a 61

yard punt runback by sophomore
Eric Cross and a perfectly
executed 67 yard drive.
Plunkett's early performance
was so brilliant that veteran coach
and broadcaster Bud Wilkinson
called it the finest performance he
had ever seen by a college
quarterback. Although bothered
in the later going by the terrible
heat and humidity, Plunkett
ended up hitting on 22 of 39
passes for 262 yards.
But Plunkett was by no means
the whole story. Junior running
back Hillary Shockley scored
three touchdowns and proved
without any doubt that Stanford's
running game would be tough.
But the big surprise had to be
the defense. Everyone knew that
the Card's front four would be
tough, but the performance of the
linebackers, Siemon, Simone and
converted tight end Ron Kadziel
was outstanding. And in the
secondary, Bennie Barnes, a
transfer from Contra Costa JC, did
a great job filling in for the
injured Miles Moore.
After enjoying their 34-28 win
for a week, the Indians returned
to Stanford Stadium on the 19th
to face local foe San Jose State.
Oh, the Spartans had definitely
improved from the team that
Stanford had humiliated two
years in a row by scores of 68-20
and 63-21; but they still weren't
any match for the Tribe.
While barely dipping into their
repertoire of plays and while
letting almost everyone see action,
the Indians breezed past SJS 34-3.
Flanker Randy Vataha caught 5
passes for 145 yards and one
touchdown and earned the Pac-8
offensive player of the week
award. Plunkett only played for a
little more than half of the game,
but he still hit on 17 of 29
attempts for 302 yards.
The Indians scored first on a
one yard run by Shockley which
culminated a 60 yard drive. As
time ran out in the first period
Vataha made a diving, disputed
catch of a Plunkett pass in the
right corner of the end zone to

give the Indians their second
score. Halfback Jackie Brown,
who made ten receptions against
Arkansas, scored Stanford's third
touchdown on a 2 yard run.
After San Jose got their only
tally of the day, a 36 yard field
goal by Larry Barnes, Eric Cross
scored from 4 yards out to give
the Tribe a 28-3 halftime
advantage.
The second half was enough to
put almost anyone to sleep. Steve
Horowitz accounted for the only
scoring on 38 and 39 yard
field goals. The only other action
was provided by Stanford's
backup quarterbacks, Jess Freitas
and Mike Boryla, who looked
fairly impressive in their debuts.
Another sophomore, tight end
Bill Scott, looked good in catching
4 passes for 47 yards after taking
over for Bob Moore who was
ejected in the second quarter.
San Jose did have one bonafide
star in defensive player of the
game, linebacker Dave Chaney,
who was credited with 20 tackles.
But other than Chaney and a few
others, the Spartans were
hopelessly lost against a far
superior Stanford squad.
Statistics released after the
State game showed that Stanford
had piled up 932 yards total
offense in their first two games;
632 through the air and 300 on
the ground. Vataha lead in pass
receptions with 8 for 166 yards,
while Shockley was the leading
rusher with 156 yards in 37
carries.
Following their thrilling
victory over Arkansas and their
not-so-thrilling win over SJS, the
Indians find themselves ranked
third in the nation according to
the latest Associated Press
rankings. The Indian's highest
ranking nationally in recent years
was 7th in 1951.
Ironically enough, 1951 is also
the last year Stanford made it to
the Rose Bowl. According to a lot
of sources, including Sports
Illustrated, Playboy, and others,
we won't make it this year either.
But strangely enough all those
sources also saw us losing to
Arkansas. Maybe we'll all just
have to wait and see.
Just before six o'clock a couple
of Saturdays ago, a terribly empty

body. I looked around and could

snap and rolled to his left looking

for ace end Chuck Dicus. But
Dicus was covered and
Montgomery kept the ball. As
hearts stopped Jeff Siemon
narrowly missed him, but outside
linebacker Mike Simone came up
and smacked Montgomery at the
four yard line. As everyone waited
breathlessly, the down markers
were brought out.
But before they were placed,
Stanford tackle Bill Alexander
signaled that it was the Indian's
ball and the agony was over.
Stanford had done it! Myself
and every other Card rooter in the
country must have gone wild at
that moment, for Stanford had
finally taken a big one. Now the
game can be looked back at and
recognized as one of the greatest
victories in Stanford's history.
In the first quarter of the game
the Indians were superb. Led by
the hard running of fullback
Hillary Shockley and the pinpoint
passing of Jim Plunkett the Tribe
moved out to an early 14-0 lead.
Before the second quarter was
even half over the Indians had
added two more tallies on a 61

yard punt runback by sophomore
Eric Cross and a perfectly
executed 67 yard drive.
Plunkett's early performance
was so brilliant that veteran coach
and broadcaster Bud Wilkinson
called it the finest performance he
had ever seen by a college
quarterback. Although bothered
in the later going by the terrible
heat and humidity, Plunkett
ended up hitting on 22 of 39
passes for 262 yards.
But Plunkett was by no means
the whole story. Junior running
back Hillary Shockley scored
three touchdowns and proved
without any doubt that Stanford's
running game would be tough.
But the big surprise had to be
the defense. Everyone knew that
the Card's front four would be
tough, but the performance of the
linebackers, Siemon, Simone and
converted tight end Ron Kadziel
was outstanding. And in the
secondary, Bennie Barnes, a
transfer from Contra Costa JC, did
a great job filling in for the
injured Miles Moore.
After enjoying their 34-28 win
for a week, the Indians returned
to Stanford Stadium on the 19th
to face local foe San Jose State.
Oh, the Spartans had definitely
improved from the team that
Stanford had humiliated two
years in a row by scores of 68-20
and 63-21; but they still weren't
any match for the Tribe.
While barely dipping into their
repertoire of plays and while
letting almost everyone see action,
the Indians breezed past SJS 34-3.
Flanker Randy Vataha caught 5
passes for 145 yards and one
touchdown and earned the Pac-8
offensive player of the week
award. Plunkett only played for a
little more than half of the game,
but he still hit on 17 of 29
attempts for 302 yards.
The Indians scored first on a
one yard run by Shockley which
culminated a 60 yard drive. As
time ran out in the first period
Vataha made a diving, disputed
catch of a Plunkett pass in the
right corner of the end zone to

give the Indians their second
score. Halfback Jackie Brown,
who made ten receptions against
Arkansas, scored Stanford's third
touchdown on a 2 yard run.
After San Jose got their only
tally of the day, a 36 yard field
goal by Larry Barnes, Eric Cross
scored from 4 yards out to give
the Tribe a 28-3 halftime
advantage.
The second half was enough to
put almost anyone to sleep. Steve
Horowitz accounted for the only
scoring on 38 and 39 yard
field goals. The only other action
was provided by Stanford's
backup quarterbacks, Jess Freitas
and Mike Boryla, who looked
fairly impressive in their debuts.
Another sophomore, tight end
Bill Scott, looked good in catching
4 passes for 47 yards after taking
over for Bob Moore who was
ejected in the second quarter.
San Jose did have one bonafide
star in defensive player of the
game, linebacker Dave Chaney,
who was credited with 20 tackles.
But other than Chaney and a few
others, the Spartans were
hopelessly lost against a far
superior Stanford squad.
Statistics released after the
State game showed that Stanford
had piled up 932 yards total
offense in their first two games;
632 through the air and 300 on
the ground. Vataha lead in pass
receptions with 8 for 166 yards,
while Shockley was the leading
rusher with 156 yards in 37
carries.
Following their thrilling
victory over Arkansas and their
not-so-thrilling win over SJS, the
Indians find themselves ranked
third in the nation according to
the latest Associated Press
rankings. The Indian's highest
ranking nationally in recent years
was 7th in 1951.
Ironically enough, 1951 is also
the last year Stanford made it to
the Rose Bowl. According to a lot
of sources, including Sports
Illustrated, Playboy, and others,
we won't make it this year either.
But strangely enough all those
sources also saw us losing to
Arkansas. Maybe we'll all just
have to wait and see.
Just before six o'clock a couple
of Saturdays ago, a terribly empty
feeling went through my whole
body. I looked around and could
sense that my friends felt the
same. For as we and twenty five
million other people looked on, it
appeared as though Stanford was
on the verge of another tragic
defeat.
The Indians had come out
against Arkansas playing like the
Kansas City Chiefs, but a
combination of heat, humidity
and some costly errors had all but
defeated the Indians.
I
Arkansas had the ball inside
Stanford's five with a fourth
down and one and 29 seconds
left. As Bill Montgomery, the
Razorback's quarterback came up
to the line I sat in shock. All I
could think about were USC's
Ron Ayala and Purdue's Mike
Phipps who last year had turned
seeming Stanford victories into
heartbreaking losses. I couldn't
stand to see it happen again.
Finally, Montgomery took the
snap and rolled to his left looking

for ace end Chuck Dicus. But
Dicus was covered and
Montgomery kept the ball. As
