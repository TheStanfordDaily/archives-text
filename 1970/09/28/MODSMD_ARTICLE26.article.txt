# Suey!
## Band Shocks Southern Pigs 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
The Stanford band,
compensating for small numbers
with mid-season obscenity,
converged on Little Rock,
Arkansas on Sept. 10 to give the
South a crash course in good
music and subtlety.
Bandsmen from all over the
nation either quit their summer
jobs or quit looking for them, and
reunited in a high school gym
where initial plans were made for
"73 screaming bastards" to take
off their pants in front of 25

The high schoolers greeted the
band with enthusiastic pity and
cries of "00000 pig, suey!". The
band responded with its own
cheers, intertwined with
impromptu grossities, and played
an all soul music rally for the
newly-integrated student body.
Naturally, they loved it.
Attempts to get acquainted
with the Little Rock culture were
overwhelmingly successful. Turn
on a radio and it was "beat
Stanford time"; drive through

numerically challenged American
flag decals. At a root beer stand, a
plump Southern belle, who had
not yet reached the age of consent
(we checked) enticingly drawled,
"Stanford sucks."
The band, aware of its small
numbers, elected to conduct
victory campaigns at night. The
essence of such efforts involved
the uniquely witty juggling of
marquees.
A drive-in advertised the movie
"100 Rifles" and sported a "Beat
Stanford" plug as well. In
minutes, Arkansas citizens were
warned, "Stanford Has 100
Rifles". Another sign urged "Hogs
Beat Stanford"; moments later it
read "Stanford Eats Hogs".
Even these relentless guerilla
attacks made it difficult to
overshadow the Arkansas football

mania. The nationally televised
game was played in War Memorial
Stadium, a complex equipped
with astroturf and more lights
than any other stadium of its
kind. The turf and lights were
installed after it was learned that
Arkansas would play Stanford. It
was announced that installation of
both would cost $200,000.
Arkansas fans raised the money in
a week.
At the game, the band
performed without error, and
responded to the crowd's
accolades with the confidential
admission that "nobody loves us
half as much as we do." These
thoughts were shockingly
confirmed moments later when it
was announced that the Arkansas
band, bolstered by two high
school contingents and a bevy of

American flags which produced
patriotism ad nauscum, had won
the first round of intercollegiate
band competition sponsored by
Chevrolet.
Doc Severinson, ace trumpet
player and upcoming exile from
the Johnny Carson show, served
as one of the judges of the bands.
Obviously unhappy with the
decision, he confided with the
Stanford musicians, "When I saw
the Arkansas band, I nearly shat."
Despite the loss, athletic and
moral victory were ours, and as
they left the niche of
Americanism, the Stanford
bandsmen could console
themselves with the fact that the
Arkansas Band probably didn't
receive a telegram from Stephen
Stills saying "Thank you for
playing my song."


RECORD-BREAKERâ€”Against San Jose State, Stanford quarterback
Jim Plunkett boosted his career total offense mark to 5584 yards,
thus breaking Gary Beban's Pac-8 career record.
