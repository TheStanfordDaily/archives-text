# Tribe Wins It In Last Half
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
"We lost the second half." So
said coach Jerry Frei after his
Oregon Ducks had been dumped
by Stanford 33-10. and his
observation couldn't have been
sharper. In the first half an
inspired Duck defense had done
the impossible, shut out
Stanford's super offense!
The Oregon offense hadn't
been too effective, but after 30
minutes they had three points on
the board to Stanford's none. And
Jim Plunkett had been held to 9
completions in 25 attempts for a
mere 81 yards. But Oregon's
fortunes changed quickly.
After Coach John Ralston at
halftime made what he called "an
old-fashioned gut check," the
Indians came out in a style similar
to their first half Arkansas
performance. In less than 16
minutes of playing time, the Tribe
shocked the Oregonians and
scored 33 points. In 26 plays,
including two kick returns, the
Cards piled up 380 yards, picking
up three touchdowns through the
air and two on the ground.
The key to the turnaround was
two explosive kickoff returns in
the third quarter. On the opening
kickoff, sophomore return
specialist Eric Cross returned the
ball 58 yards to the Oregon 41. As
stunned Oregon fans looked on,
the Indians quickly took it in for
the score in five plays culminated
by Hillary Shockley's one yard
TD run.
The crucial play in the drive
came when Oregon cornerback
Bill Drake was called for a 28 yard
pass interference penalty while
covering Randy Vataha. Frei said
that the combination of the big
return and the controversial
penalty "changed the game a lot."
"We let them get pretty good
momentum with that doggone
kickoff return. It's amazing how
often that happens when you get
overeager. We just went downfield
too fast, and overran the play," he
said.
But soon after the first
Stanford score, Oregon made
basically the same coverage errors
on their next and final kickoff.
After cutting the lead to 12-10 on
an 18 yard Dan Fouts touchdown
pass, the Ducks kicked off again.
Sophomore Reggie Sanderson
took the kick near the goal line
and went up the left sideline for
an apparent 100 yard touchdown
return. But an official ruled that
Sanderson had stepped out on the
Oregon 18. Despite a dramatic
pleading by Ralston who got on
his hands and knees in front of
the official to dispute the call, the
TD was nullified.

But the play still broke the
game wide open as the Tribe
scored in two plays and added
two more scores within six
minutes for a 33-10 fourth
quarter lead.
During the 16 minute spree,
Plunkett hit on 7 of 9 passes for
126 yards and three TD's. His
second scoring pass, a 23 yarder
to Jackie Brown, gave him 38
career touchdowns passes, thus
breaking Bob Berry's Pac-8 record
of 37, set at Oregon from
1962-64.
The biggest surprise of the
game though had to be Plunkett's
running. Executing to perfection
an option run-pitchout play, he
picked up 62 yards in seven
carries including a 15 yard
touchdown run. On the option,
Plunkett could pitch to Brown,
who led all rushers with 9 2 yards
in 13 carries.
Plunkett's Oregon counterpart,
Fouts, had himself quite a day as
well. The sophomore quarterback
who was only supposed to back
up veteran Tom Blanchard this
year broke three Oregon school
records. He hit on 27 of 51 passes
for 271 yards, all three being new
school marks.
Fouts' performance was
especially surprising considering
the pressure Stanford's defensive
line kept on him. The Indians got
to Fouts several times and he
ended up with 48 yards in 8
carries. Oregon's other rushers
didn't fare too well either as they
ended up with an incredible three
yards in 27 carries, an average of
four inches per carry.
Junior halfback Bobby Moore,
who picked up only 36 yards in
14 carries, showed little of the
explosiveness he had last year as
an All-Coast wide receiver who
caught 5 4 passes for 786 yards
and 10 touchdowns.
The final statistics showed
another typical Stanford
pcrformace. The Cards picked up
513 yards total offense, 348 of
these coming in the second half.
The defense, besides holding them
to 3 yards on the ground, forced
(he Ducks into 9 punts. For 30
minutes a lot of people were
surprised, but as expected, once
Stanford got going, there was no
way Oregon could stop them.

finger early in the third quarter but blinked away dirt troubles to be
the game's leading rusher. Ducks Fred Manuel (3 7) and Bob Green
(46) chase after him in the secondary.

against the University of Oregon. Brown was hit in the eye with a
finger early in the third quarter but blinked away dirt troubles to be
the game's leading rusher. Ducks Fred Manuel (3 7) and Bob Green
(46) chase after him in the secondary.
"We lost the second half." So
said coach Jerry Frei after his
Oregon Ducks had been dumped
by Stanford 33-10. and his
observation couldn't have been
sharper. In the first half an
inspired Duck defense had done
the impossible, shut out
Stanford's super offense!
The Oregon offense hadn't
been too effective, but after 30
minutes they had three points on
the board to Stanford's none. And
Jim Plunkett had been held to 9
completions in 25 attempts for a
mere 81 yards. But Oregon's
fortunes changed quickly.
After Coach John Ralston at
halftime made what he called "an
old-fashioned gut check," the
Indians came out in a style similar
to their first half Arkansas
performance. In less than 16
minutes of playing time, the Tribe
shocked the Oregonians and
scored 33 points. In 26 plays,
including two kick returns, the
Cards piled up 380 yards, picking
up three touchdowns through the
air and two on the ground.
The key to the turnaround was
two explosive kickoff returns in
the third quarter. On the opening
kickoff, sophomore return
specialist Eric Cross returned the
ball 58 yards to the Oregon 41. As
stunned Oregon fans looked on,
the Indians quickly took it in for
the score in five plays culminated
by Hillary Shockley's one yard
TD run.
The crucial play in the drive
came when Oregon cornerback
Bill Drake was called for a 28 yard
pass interference penalty while
covering Randy Vataha. Frei said
that the combination of the big
return and the controversial
penalty "changed the game a lot."
"We let them get pretty good
momentum with that doggone
kickoff return. It's amazing how
often that happens when you get
overeager. We just went downfield
too fast, and overran the play," he
said.
But soon after the first
Stanford score, Oregon made
basically the same coverage errors
on their next and final kickoff.
After cutting the lead to 12-10 on
an 18 yard Dan Fouts touchdown
pass, the Ducks kicked off again.
Sophomore Reggie Sanderson
took the kick near the goal line
and went up the left sideline for
an apparent 100 yard touchdown
return. But an official ruled that
Sanderson had stepped out on the
Oregon 18. Despite a dramatic
pleading by Ralston who got on
his hands and knees in front of
the official to dispute the call, the
TD was nullified.

But the play still broke the
game wide open as the Tribe
scored in two plays and added
two more scores within six
minutes for a 33-10 fourth
quarter lead.
During the 16 minute spree,
Plunkett hit on 7 of 9 passes for
126 yards and three TD's. His
second scoring pass, a 23 yarder
to Jackie Brown, gave him 38
career touchdowns passes, thus
breaking Bob Berry's Pac-8 record
of 37, set at Oregon from
1962-64.
The biggest surprise of the
game though had to be Plunkett's
running. Executing to perfection
an option run-pitchout play, he
picked up 62 yards in seven
carries including a 15 yard
touchdown run. On the option,
Plunkett could pitch to Brown,
who led all rushers with 9 2 yards
in 13 carries.
Plunkett's Oregon counterpart,
Fouts, had himself quite a day as
well. The sophomore quarterback
who was only supposed to back
up veteran Tom Blanchard this
year broke three Oregon school
records. He hit on 27 of 51 passes
for 271 yards, all three being new
school marks.
Fouts' performance was
especially surprising considering
the pressure Stanford's defensive
line kept on him. The Indians got
to Fouts several times and he
ended up with 48 yards in 8
carries. Oregon's other rushers
didn't fare too well either as they
ended up with an incredible three
yards in 27 carries, an average of
four inches per carry.
Junior halfback Bobby Moore,
who picked up only 36 yards in
14 carries, showed little of the
explosiveness he had last year as
an All-Coast wide receiver who
caught 5 4 passes for 786 yards
and 10 touchdowns.
The final statistics showed
another typical Stanford
pcrformace. The Cards picked up
513 yards total offense, 348 of
these coming in the second half.
The defense, besides holding them
to 3 yards on the ground, forced
(he Ducks into 9 punts. For 30
minutes a lot of people were
surprised, but as expected, once
Stanford got going, there was no
way Oregon could stop them.

Stanford got going, there was no
way Oregon could stop them.

JACKIE ON THE FLY—Stanford junior halfback Jackie Brown finds
his open running room and dashes towards his 92 yard rushing total
against the University of Oregon. Brown was hit in the eye with a
finger early in the third quarter but blinked away dirt troubles to be
the game's leading rusher. Ducks Fred Manuel (3 7) and Bob Green
(46) chase after him in the secondary.
"We lost the second half." So
said coach Jerry Frei after his
Oregon Ducks had been dumped
by Stanford 33-10. and his
observation couldn't have been
sharper. In the first half an
inspired Duck defense had done
the impossible, shut out
Stanford's super offense!
The Oregon offense hadn't
been too effective, but after 30
minutes they had three points on
the board to Stanford's none. And
Jim Plunkett had been held to 9
completions in 25 attempts for a
mere 81 yards. But Oregon's
fortunes changed quickly.
After Coach John Ralston at
halftime made what he called "an
old-fashioned gut check," the
Indians came out in a style similar
to their first half Arkansas
performance. In less than 16
minutes of playing time, the Tribe
shocked the Oregonians and
scored 33 points. In 26 plays,
including two kick returns, the
Cards piled up 380 yards, picking
up three touchdowns through the
air and two on the ground.
The key to the turnaround was
two explosive kickoff returns in
the third quarter. On the opening
kickoff, sophomore return
specialist Eric Cross returned the
ball 58 yards to the Oregon 41. As
stunned Oregon fans looked on,
the Indians quickly took it in for
the score in five plays culminated
by Hillary Shockley's one yard
TD run.
The crucial play in the drive
came when Oregon cornerback
Bill Drake was called for a 28 yard
pass interference penalty while
covering Randy Vataha. Frei said
that the combination of the big
return and the controversial
penalty "changed the game a lot."
"We let them get pretty good
momentum with that doggone
kickoff return. It's amazing how
often that happens when you get
overeager. We just went downfield
too fast, and overran the play," he
said.
But soon after the first
Stanford score, Oregon made
basically the same coverage errors
on their next and final kickoff.
After cutting the lead to 12-10 on
an 18 yard Dan Fouts touchdown
pass, the Ducks kicked off again.
Sophomore Reggie Sanderson
took the kick near the goal line
and went up the left sideline for
an apparent 100 yard touchdown
return. But an official ruled that
Sanderson had stepped out on the
Oregon 18. Despite a dramatic
pleading by Ralston who got on
his hands and knees in front of
the official to dispute the call, the
TD was nullified.

But the play still broke the
game wide open as the Tribe
scored in two plays and added
two more scores within six
minutes for a 33-10 fourth
quarter lead.
During the 16 minute spree,
Plunkett hit on 7 of 9 passes for
126 yards and three TD's. His
second scoring pass, a 23 yarder
to Jackie Brown, gave him 38
career touchdowns passes, thus
breaking Bob Berry's Pac-8 record
of 37, set at Oregon from
1962-64.
The biggest surprise of the
game though had to be Plunkett's
running. Executing to perfection
an option run-pitchout play, he
picked up 62 yards in seven
carries including a 15 yard
touchdown run. On the option,
Plunkett could pitch to Brown,
who led all rushers with 9 2 yards
in 13 carries.
Plunkett's Oregon counterpart,
Fouts, had himself quite a day as
well. The sophomore quarterback
who was only supposed to back
up veteran Tom Blanchard this
year broke three Oregon school
records. He hit on 27 of 51 passes
for 271 yards, all three being new
school marks.
Fouts' performance was
especially surprising considering
the pressure Stanford's defensive
line kept on him. The Indians got
to Fouts several times and he
ended up with 48 yards in 8
carries. Oregon's other rushers
didn't fare too well either as they
ended up with an incredible three
yards in 27 carries, an average of
four inches per carry.
Junior halfback Bobby Moore,
who picked up only 36 yards in
14 carries, showed little of the
explosiveness he had last year as
an All-Coast wide receiver who
caught 5 4 passes for 786 yards
and 10 touchdowns.
The final statistics showed
another typical Stanford
pcrformace. The Cards picked up
513 yards total offense, 348 of
these coming in the second half.
The defense, besides holding them
to 3 yards on the ground, forced
(he Ducks into 9 punts. For 30
minutes a lot of people were
surprised, but as expected, once
Stanford got going, there was no
way Oregon could stop them.
