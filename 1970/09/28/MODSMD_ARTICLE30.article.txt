# Cards Dazzle Ducks With Balanced Attack
## 
### FRED LEESON 
EUGENE, ORE.—"With another game under
our belt we'll be a complete football team," Coach
John Ralston said Saturday from a post-game
vantage on the dressing room steps.
As it was, he already had a complete team in
the 33-10 win over Oregon. During the second
half, anyway.
After a scoreless first half Stanford ripped its
way to 33 points in 16 minutes in the second
when everything the visitors tried worked almost
perfectly.
Jim Plunkett burned the Duck defense with 62
yards rushing and Jackie Brown faked and twisted
for another 92 to provide excellent balance with
Plunkett's passing.
Plunkett, who ran option plays of 15 and 24
yards, caught the Ducks concentrating on pass
defense.
"In the second half we figured they'd play
man-to-man on our backs. We wanted to get
outside with the fake to the halfback. They were
playing the pitch man, not the quarterback."
"That hurt us pretty bad," Oregon Coach Jerry
Erie said of Plunkett's quarterback option.
The Ducks, who had spent the week in closed
drills revamping their defense, were picked apart in
the second half by Plunkett's 9 for 12 passing
show which included three touchdowns passes,
giving him a new Pac-8 career record.
One was for 23 yards to Jackie Brown who
blinked off a poke in the eye early in the third
period and piled up 92 yards on 13 carries, his
longest effort a 29 yard jaunt displaying his superb
open-field moves.
"I got a couple good initial blocks," he said
afterward. "I really like it when it works that way
because I always feel more confident running in
the open field."

Stanford was stunned at not scoring in the first
half but Brown said the team wasn't shaken. "At
halftime the locker room was really calm. He
(Ralston) told us just to keep playing football."
"This was a great lesson for-us," Ralston told
his players when it was over. "The big thing is that
you showed us we can come back."
Although Ralston didn't say so outright, the
Indians apparently had figured on rushing
Oregon's young offensive line and getting to
sophomore quarterback Dan Eouts in the first
half.
"Hey, where's our rush?" Ralston repeatedly
shouted in the first half but Eouts was mostly
untouched. He was hit hard in the second half,
once by Dave Tipton who suffered an injured
shoulder as he flung down the rookie passer.
"I thought we'd do a little better," Ralston said
of his rush. "But that Eouts never lost his nerve."
The turning point, according to Frei, was the
second half kick return by Eric Cross and the
following pass interference penalty on Bill Drake
who shouldered Randy Vataha down the sidelines.
"I'd rather not get involved with that penalty
call," Frei said. "Those two plays certainly
changed the momentum of the game."
Had Stanford's past history of weak second
halves entered Frei's mind at halftime? "I had
thought about it, but I hadn't counted on that
kickoff return and that penalty."
"Jim Plunkett is a good quarterback," he said
slowly. "Everybody knows that. You expect a
professional kind of performance from him."
In his third game, the lanky Fouts set three
Oregon single game passing marks. "He got nailed
a few times didn't he?" Frei said. "He stayed right
in there."
"This is a good Oregon team," Ralston said.
"I'm so happy to have these people out of there.
They scare me to death."
