# Lyman Judged Steadying Force In Demanding Role As President
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Rarely can alumni, faculty members,
students, and trustees agree on
anything, yet all these natural enemies
managed to agree on Richard W.
Lyman as the best choice for the
Stanford's presidency.
As the seventh president in
Stanford's 79 year history, Lyman is
judged by most observers as a steadying
force. A former history professor
respected for a sharply incisive tongue
and principled, rigorous mind, he is also
the battle-weary commandant who has
stood second in command during the
last three stormy years.
Lyman may be one of the few
administrators in the country who can
nearly cope with the presidency. He
works long hours, often taking home
piles of reading material. In the office
he is a demanding superior insisting on
thorough preparation. He surrounds
himself with a cool, efficient staff. "If
you haven't done your homework,
you're in trouble," comments one
adviser.
In talking over ideas, he cuts
through theories to examine the central
points. His sober firmness feeds the
criticism that he is stiff and inflexible;
"he is an ascetic, a puritan at times,"
says an administrator.
Lyman is a scholar with a keen,
well-trained mind not given to drama or
a reliance on charisma. At his press
conference Friday he answered
questions in his typically brisk and
pointed fashion. He attempts to present
a low political profile and avoids
becoming partisan though he has long
been an opponent of the Vietnam war
and helped organize a teach-in in 1965 .
Last spring he telegramed President
Nixon his protest of the Cambodian
invasion.

While Provost, he often took time to
write letters to the Daily, and during
last spring's extended crisis, he
frequently spoke to students over
KZSU to outline the administration's
positions and to answer questions. The
Lyman family also regular dines in
dormitories in a further effort to
communicate with students.
Though he does keep in contact
with students and their concerns over
social responsibilities, he will no doubt
stick to his firm belief that universities
should shun any formal political role.
"I believe with every fiber of my being
the University cannot remain the true
home of free inquiry - questioning, if
you like - if it subdordinated to
political purposes ... A great university
does not exist to make people happy
by confirming their prejudices," he told
the Stanford Men's Club in August.
In the search to replace Kenneth
Pitzer, Lyman was the first choice. Said
Dr. David Hamburg, chairman of the
faculty search committee, "Nowhere
was the depth of support greater than
among the faculty who, knowing
intimately his virtues and his
limitations, overwhelmingly wrote us of
their desire that he be named president
as soon as possible."
A Great President?
Added Faculty Senate chairman
Sanford Dornbusch, "With a little luck,
he will be a great president." In the
past year Lyman was considered for the
presidency by Dartmouth, Harvard,
Pennsylvania, Swarthmore, and
Wesleyan.
One of his greatest assets in running
Stanford is his close-knit family. His
attractive, intelligent wife is deeply
involved in the fight for low-cost
housing. She is president of a local fair

housing group and is also active in the
Urban Coalition. She met her husband
while they were both studying at
Swarthmore and she was his first
tutorial student. "I paid him in records
and hamburgers," she recalls.
Lyman graduated Phi Beta Kappa
from Swarthmore in 194 7 and earned
his masters and doctorate degrees from
Harvard in 1948 and 1954 respectively.
He taught at Harvard, Swarthmore, and
Washington University before coming
here in 1958 as an associate professor.
The recipient of Fulbright and
Guggenheim fellowships, Lyman is a
recognized authority on the British
Labor party and has published several
books in the field. He served for a
number of years as a special
correspondent for The Economist.
Full Professorship
Lyman was promoted to full
professor in 1962 and named associate
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences in January 1964. Three years

later he was appointed provost by
President Wallace Sterling.
The Lyman's have four children;
Jennifer, 20, a junior at Yale; Holly,
18, a freshman at Hampshire College in
Massachusetts; Cricket, 15, a
sophomore at Gunn High School; and
Tim, 13, a student at Terman Junior
High. The family also includes a female
golden retreiver named Apple Golden
Delicious.
The new president relaxes with jazz
music and enjoys light reading when he
gets a rare chance. "I have a hard time
getting him to take his mind off his
work," said Mrs. Lyman. A real
occasion to relax comes in the summer
when the Lymans spend a month on
their family island off the Coast of
Maine.
Until last year the Lymans relied on
two VW microbuses for transportation.
Eventually, Lyman broke down under
family pressure and bought a used
Mercedes from another professor.
