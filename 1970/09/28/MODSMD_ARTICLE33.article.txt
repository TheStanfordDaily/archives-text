Jordan War Ends
CAIRO — King Hussein of Jordan, guerrilla leader Yasir
Arafat and eight Arab chiefs of state signed a peace
agreement Sunday night in an effort to end the Jordanian
civil war.
The pact called for immediate withdrawal from Amman
of both government troops and guerrilla forces and set up
a three-man Arab committee to see that the terms are met.
While the conditions were being worked out in Cairo, a
five-nation Arab military mission arrived in Amman in an
attempt to stop the fighting, which continued sporadically
in its 11 th day.
The Jordanian military strongman, Field Marshal Habis
Majali, reimposed a curfew on two of Amman's seven hills.
Amman radio claimed guerrillas had fired on government
troops in the two areas.
Ajafat's A 1 Fatah guerrillas said through their office in
Beirut that their men in Amman and Zarqa still were being
shelled "although they adhered to the cease-fire agreement
and refrained from retaliating."
Premier Bahi Ladgham of Tunisia heads the three-man
committee provided for in the agreement. The other two
members were to be appointed by Hussein and Arafat.
The Cairo agreement appeared to give Ladgham's
committee virtual custody of Jordan's sovereignty until
further notice, while permitting Hussein to keep his
throne.
Principal item in the 14-point agreement provided for a
"speedy" withdrawal of Jordanian armed forces from
Amman to their normal barracks, coupled with a pullout
of all Palestinian guerrillas from the capital to "posts best
suited to their activities."
That apparently meant to positions facing Israel across
the Jordan River cease-fire line.
Last Hostages Freed
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Thirty-two Americans, held as
hostages by Palestinian guerrillas for three harrowing
weeks, arrived cheering on this Mediterranean island
Sunday en route home at last. They told of living
alternately in fear and high spirits as Jordan's civil war
thundered around them.
Six more remain in Amman, Jordan's capital, but
diplomatic sources in Beirut, Lebanon, reported they too
had been freed and were turned over to the Egyptian
Embassy, serving as go-between for the International Red
Cross.
The departure for home of those last six would bring an
end to one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of
air travel. It began on Sept. 6 with the hijacking of three
airliners in Europe and the attempted hijacking of a
fourth-an Israeli El A 1 flight. A fifth plane was hijacked
over the Middle East on Sept. 9. In all about 800 air
passengers and crew were involved. The lone death was
that of the male guerrilla hijacker of the El A 1 plane over
Britain.
About 400 passengers and airlines personnel were taken
to Jordan where all but 5 4 hostages were released by the
hijackers, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, before Jordan's civil war broke out on Sept. 17.
The other 400 or so were aboard a plane that was
hijacked to Cairo and on board the El A 1 jetliner. Those
flown to Cairo were prompt ly released.
All four planes were destroyed on the ground by the
guerrillas for a loss of around $50 million. They were a Pan
American 74 7 jumbo jet blown up in Cairo; a Trans World
Airlines 707, a Swissair DCB and a VCIO of the British
Overseas Airways Corp., all blasted to pieces on a desert
airstrip in Jordan.
The guerrillas demanded as ransom for the hijacked
passengers and crew members the release of guerrillas held
in Britain, West Germany, Switzerland and Israel.
None has been freed but in London British officials said
they would free Leila Khaled,24, the female commando
seized on board the El Al flight after her companion was
killed.

A West German spokesman said it will decide what to
do with the guerrillas it has in custody in concert with the
British and Swiss governments.
Fires Uncontrolled
LOS ANGELES — A huge fire storm, driven by high
winds, threatened thousands of canyon homes north of the
city Sunday after cutting a 35-mile swath around the
populous San Fernando Valley.
An even larger fire rampaged across hills in San Diego
County, sweeping 35 miles to the outskirts of several San
Diego suburbs.
Gov. Ronald Reagan declared Los Angeles, Ventura and
San Diego counties disaster areas. They were the largest of
nummerous brush fires raging out of control for the third
straight day in Southern California.
By Sunday, the fires had claimed two lives, destroyed
several hundred homes and burned almost 300,000 acres
of land. Thousands of persons had fled their homes.
Ulster Violence
BELFAST, North Ireland — A stone-throwing mob
tried to batter its way *nto a British army command post
Sunday as violence again in the Northern Ireland
capital.
The crowd attacked the command post with a timber
battering ram as 34 rioters were brought into court on
charges arising from a 10-hour burst of street brawling in
Belfast Saturday night and early Sunday. Seven were freed
on bail and the rest were ordered held in jail.
Soldiers fired nausea gas to drive back the crowd from
the command post.
The street was one of the centers of the night of
violence between Protestants and Roman Catholics, in
which one man died of a heart attack and scores were
injured.
As the crowd ran back from the command post,
another mob set up barricades across the street and a gang
of youths captured a double-decker bus. Troops took over
the bus but were trapped inside by the mob. The troops
fired gas to push their way out to safety.
Fugitive Captured
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. - Stanley R. Bond, one
four fugitives described by police as revolutionaries sought
in a bank holdup and machine-gun slaying of a Boston
policeman, was arrested by the FBI as he attempted to
leave this city by plane Suncay, the FBI said.
Vincent Jones, FBI agent here, told newsmen the plane,
a commercial flight bound for Denver and Chicago, was on
the runway and was called back to the terminal. All
passengers were asked to leave the plane, and Bond, 25, of
Cambridge, Mass., was among the last to get off, Jones
said.
Jones said he and Undersheriff Dick Williams grabbed
Bond and pressed him against a fence before Bond could
draw a revolver.
Nixon In Italy
ROME — President Nixon arrived in Italy Sunday night
amid scattered leftist protests and declared it was
America's policy "to maintain in the Mediterranean a
sufficient force to avoid any war."
He noted he would visit the U.S. 6th Fleet, which he
reinforced during the height of the Jordanian civil war last
week, and said:
"The Mediterranean is the cradle of many civiliations
and we are determined that it shall not be the starting
place of a great war in the future."
Nixon made the remarks at an official reception in
Quirinal Palace after flying aboard a U.S. military
helicopter to downtown Rome from Ciampino military
airport to start his European tour.
President Giuseppe Saragat, Italy's first Socialist
president, thanked Nixon in his welcoming speech for
"being in Italy and the Mediterranean on a mission of
justice and peace."

BELFAST, North Ireland — A stone-throwing mob
tried to batter its way *nto a British army command post
Sunday as violence again in the Northern Ireland
capital.
The crowd attacked the command post with a timber
battering ram as 34 rioters were brought into court on
charges arising from a 10-hour burst of street brawling in
Belfast Saturday night and early Sunday. Seven were freed
on bail and the rest were ordered held in jail.
Soldiers fired nausea gas to drive back the crowd from
the command post.
The street was one of the centers of the night of
violence between Protestants and Roman Catholics, in
which one man died of a heart attack and scores were
injured.
As the crowd ran back from the command post,
another mob set up barricades across the street and a gang
of youths captured a double-decker bus. Troops took over
the bus but were trapped inside by the mob. The troops
fired gas to push their way out to safety.
Fugitive Captured
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. - Stanley R. Bond, one
four fugitives described by police as revolutionaries sought
in a bank holdup and machine-gun slaying of a Boston
policeman, was arrested by the FBI as he attempted to
leave this city by plane Suncay, the FBI said.
Vincent Jones, FBI agent here, told newsmen the plane,
a commercial flight bound for Denver and Chicago, was on
the runway and was called back to the terminal. All
passengers were asked to leave the plane, and Bond, 25, of
Cambridge, Mass., was among the last to get off, Jones
said.
Jones said he and Undersheriff Dick Williams grabbed
Bond and pressed him against a fence before Bond could
draw a revolver.
Nixon In Italy
ROME — President Nixon arrived in Italy Sunday night
amid scattered leftist protests and declared it was
America's policy "to maintain in the Mediterranean a
sufficient force to avoid any war."
He noted he would visit the U.S. 6th Fleet, which he
reinforced during the height of the Jordanian civil war last
week, and said:
"The Mediterranean is the cradle of many civiliations
and we are determined that it shall not be the starting
place of a great war in the future."
Nixon made the remarks at an official reception in
Quirinal Palace after flying aboard a U.S. military
helicopter to downtown Rome from Ciampino military
airport to start his European tour.
President Giuseppe Saragat, Italy's first Socialist
president, thanked Nixon in his welcoming speech for
"being in Italy and the Mediterranean on a mission of
justice and peace."
Jordan War Ends
CAIRO — King Hussein of Jordan, guerrilla leader Yasir
Arafat and eight Arab chiefs of state signed a peace
agreement Sunday night in an effort to end the Jordanian
civil war.
The pact called for immediate withdrawal from Amman
of both government troops and guerrilla forces and set up
a three-man Arab committee to see that the terms are met.
While the conditions were being worked out in Cairo, a
five-nation Arab military mission arrived in Amman in an
attempt to stop the fighting, which continued sporadically
in its 11 th day.
The Jordanian military strongman, Field Marshal Habis
Majali, reimposed a curfew on two of Amman's seven hills.
Amman radio claimed guerrillas had fired on government
troops in the two areas.
Ajafat's A 1 Fatah guerrillas said through their office in
Beirut that their men in Amman and Zarqa still were being
shelled "although they adhered to the cease-fire agreement
and refrained from retaliating."
Premier Bahi Ladgham of Tunisia heads the three-man
committee provided for in the agreement. The other two
members were to be appointed by Hussein and Arafat.
The Cairo agreement appeared to give Ladgham's
committee virtual custody of Jordan's sovereignty until
further notice, while permitting Hussein to keep his
throne.
Principal item in the 14-point agreement provided for a
"speedy" withdrawal of Jordanian armed forces from
Amman to their normal barracks, coupled with a pullout
of all Palestinian guerrillas from the capital to "posts best
suited to their activities."
That apparently meant to positions facing Israel across
the Jordan River cease-fire line.
Last Hostages Freed
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Thirty-two Americans, held as
hostages by Palestinian guerrillas for three harrowing
weeks, arrived cheering on this Mediterranean island
Sunday en route home at last. They told of living
alternately in fear and high spirits as Jordan's civil war
thundered around them.
Six more remain in Amman, Jordan's capital, but
diplomatic sources in Beirut, Lebanon, reported they too
had been freed and were turned over to the Egyptian
Embassy, serving as go-between for the International Red
Cross.
The departure for home of those last six would bring an
end to one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of
air travel. It began on Sept. 6 with the hijacking of three
airliners in Europe and the attempted hijacking of a
fourth-an Israeli El A 1 flight. A fifth plane was hijacked
over the Middle East on Sept. 9. In all about 800 air
passengers and crew were involved. The lone death was
that of the male guerrilla hijacker of the El A 1 plane over
Britain.
About 400 passengers and airlines personnel were taken
to Jordan where all but 5 4 hostages were released by the
hijackers, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, before Jordan's civil war broke out on Sept. 17.
The other 400 or so were aboard a plane that was
hijacked to Cairo and on board the El A 1 jetliner. Those
flown to Cairo were prompt ly released.
All four planes were destroyed on the ground by the
guerrillas for a loss of around $50 million. They were a Pan
American 74 7 jumbo jet blown up in Cairo; a Trans World
Airlines 707, a Swissair DCB and a VCIO of the British
Overseas Airways Corp., all blasted to pieces on a desert
airstrip in Jordan.
The guerrillas demanded as ransom for the hijacked
passengers and crew members the release of guerrillas held
in Britain, West Germany, Switzerland and Israel.
None has been freed but in London British officials said
they would free Leila Khaled,24, the female commando
seized on board the El Al flight after her companion was
killed.

A West German spokesman said it will decide what to
do with the guerrillas it has in custody in concert with the
British and Swiss governments.
Fires Uncontrolled
LOS ANGELES — A huge fire storm, driven by high
winds, threatened thousands of canyon homes north of the
city Sunday after cutting a 35-mile swath around the
populous San Fernando Valley.
An even larger fire rampaged across hills in San Diego
County, sweeping 35 miles to the outskirts of several San
Diego suburbs.
Gov. Ronald Reagan declared Los Angeles, Ventura and
San Diego counties disaster areas. They were the largest of
nummerous brush fires raging out of control for the third
straight day in Southern California.
By Sunday, the fires had claimed two lives, destroyed
several hundred homes and burned almost 300,000 acres
of land. Thousands of persons had fled their homes.

Cross.
The departure for home of those last six would bring an
end to one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of
air travel. It began on Sept. 6 with the hijacking of three
airliners in Europe and the attempted hijacking of a
fourth-an Israeli El A 1 flight. A fifth plane was hijacked
over the Middle East on Sept. 9. In all about 800 air
passengers and crew were involved. The lone death was
that of the male guerrilla hijacker of the El A 1 plane over
Britain.
About 400 passengers and airlines personnel were taken
to Jordan where all but 5 4 hostages were released by the
hijackers, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, before Jordan's civil war broke out on Sept. 17.
The other 400 or so were aboard a plane that was
hijacked to Cairo and on board the El A 1 jetliner. Those
flown to Cairo were prompt ly released.
All four planes were destroyed on the ground by the
guerrillas for a loss of around $50 million. They were a Pan
American 74 7 jumbo jet blown up in Cairo; a Trans World
Airlines 707, a Swissair DCB and a VCIO of the British
Overseas Airways Corp., all blasted to pieces on a desert
airstrip in Jordan.
The guerrillas demanded as ransom for the hijacked
passengers and crew members the release of guerrillas held
in Britain, West Germany, Switzerland and Israel.
None has been freed but in London British officials said
they would free Leila Khaled,24, the female commando
seized on board the El Al flight after her companion was
killed.

A West German spokesman said it will decide what to
do with the guerrillas it has in custody in concert with the
British and Swiss governments.
Fires Uncontrolled
LOS ANGELES — A huge fire storm, driven by high
winds, threatened thousands of canyon homes north of the
city Sunday after cutting a 35-mile swath around the
populous San Fernando Valley.
An even larger fire rampaged across hills in San Diego
County, sweeping 35 miles to the outskirts of several San
Diego suburbs.
Gov. Ronald Reagan declared Los Angeles, Ventura and
San Diego counties disaster areas. They were the largest of
nummerous brush fires raging out of control for the third
straight day in Southern California.
By Sunday, the fires had claimed two lives, destroyed
several hundred homes and burned almost 300,000 acres
of land. Thousands of persons had fled their homes.
Ulster Violence
BELFAST, North Ireland — A stone-throwing mob
tried to batter its way *nto a British army command post
Sunday as violence again in the Northern Ireland
capital.
The crowd attacked the command post with a timber
battering ram as 34 rioters were brought into court on
charges arising from a 10-hour burst of street brawling in
Belfast Saturday night and early Sunday. Seven were freed
on bail and the rest were ordered held in jail.
Soldiers fired nausea gas to drive back the crowd from
the command post.
The street was one of the centers of the night of
violence between Protestants and Roman Catholics, in
which one man died of a heart attack and scores were
injured.
As the crowd ran back from the command post,
another mob set up barricades across the street and a gang
of youths captured a double-decker bus. Troops took over
the bus but were trapped inside by the mob. The troops
fired gas to push their way out to safety.
Fugitive Captured
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. - Stanley R. Bond, one
four fugitives described by police as revolutionaries sought
in a bank holdup and machine-gun slaying of a Boston
policeman, was arrested by the FBI as he attempted to
leave this city by plane Suncay, the FBI said.
Vincent Jones, FBI agent here, told newsmen the plane,
a commercial flight bound for Denver and Chicago, was on
the runway and was called back to the terminal. All
passengers were asked to leave the plane, and Bond, 25, of
Cambridge, Mass., was among the last to get off, Jones
said.
Jones said he and Undersheriff Dick Williams grabbed
Bond and pressed him against a fence before Bond could
draw a revolver.
Nixon In Italy
ROME — President Nixon arrived in Italy Sunday night
amid scattered leftist protests and declared it was
America's policy "to maintain in the Mediterranean a
sufficient force to avoid any war."
He noted he would visit the U.S. 6th Fleet, which he
reinforced during the height of the Jordanian civil war last
week, and said:
"The Mediterranean is the cradle of many civiliations
and we are determined that it shall not be the starting
place of a great war in the future."
Nixon made the remarks at an official reception in
Quirinal Palace after flying aboard a U.S. military
helicopter to downtown Rome from Ciampino military
airport to start his European tour.
President Giuseppe Saragat, Italy's first Socialist
president, thanked Nixon in his welcoming speech for
"being in Italy and the Mediterranean on a mission of
justice and peace."
Jordan War Ends
CAIRO — King Hussein of Jordan, guerrilla leader Yasir
Arafat and eight Arab chiefs of state signed a peace
agreement Sunday night in an effort to end the Jordanian
civil war.
The pact called for immediate withdrawal from Amman
of both government troops and guerrilla forces and set up
a three-man Arab committee to see that the terms are met.
While the conditions were being worked out in Cairo, a
five-nation Arab military mission arrived in Amman in an
attempt to stop the fighting, which continued sporadically
in its 11 th day.
The Jordanian military strongman, Field Marshal Habis
Majali, reimposed a curfew on two of Amman's seven hills.
Amman radio claimed guerrillas had fired on government
troops in the two areas.
Ajafat's A 1 Fatah guerrillas said through their office in
Beirut that their men in Amman and Zarqa still were being
shelled "although they adhered to the cease-fire agreement
and refrained from retaliating."
Premier Bahi Ladgham of Tunisia heads the three-man
committee provided for in the agreement. The other two
members were to be appointed by Hussein and Arafat.
The Cairo agreement appeared to give Ladgham's
committee virtual custody of Jordan's sovereignty until
further notice, while permitting Hussein to keep his
throne.
Principal item in the 14-point agreement provided for a
"speedy" withdrawal of Jordanian armed forces from
Amman to their normal barracks, coupled with a pullout
of all Palestinian guerrillas from the capital to "posts best
suited to their activities."
That apparently meant to positions facing Israel across
the Jordan River cease-fire line.
Last Hostages Freed
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Thirty-two Americans, held as
hostages by Palestinian guerrillas for three harrowing
weeks, arrived cheering on this Mediterranean island
Sunday en route home at last. They told of living
alternately in fear and high spirits as Jordan's civil war
thundered around them.
Six more remain in Amman, Jordan's capital, but
diplomatic sources in Beirut, Lebanon, reported they too
had been freed and were turned over to the Egyptian
Embassy, serving as go-between for the International Red
Cross.
