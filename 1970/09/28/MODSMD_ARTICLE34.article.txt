# Departures Disrupt Administrative Structure
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Stanford's administrative structure
underwent a series of jolts this summer
as some of the University's major
figures decided to depart. The
resignation of President Kenneth S.
Pitzer made headlines across the nation,
but almost as important was the hole in
the hierarchy left by Vice-President for
Business Affairs Alf E. Brandin when
he quit the post he had held for
decades in charge of development of
Stanford's physical environment. Dean
of Students Peter Z. Bulkeley resigned
that job to return to Stanford's
engineering school. Bayless Manning,
dean of Stanford's law school and
member of the Scranton Commission,
also announced that this will be his last
year in the deanship.
The situation which led to Pitzer's
resignation was complex, but appears
to have been dominated by his
difficulties in obtaining support from
potential donors.
"The resignation was not forced,"
Pitzer told the press conference of June
27 at which he explained his departure.
"1 was concerned, however, by the
need for positive support in raising

funds . . . that is essential from the
trustees and other alumni.
"I must admit I felt that there were
sufficient weaknesses that needed to be
taken into account," he said.
Pitzer pointed out to the press that
he "felt we needed to be getting on
more vigorously with some things, and
there were potential donors who
seemed to be disaffected who might be
brought back into the fold."
Pitzer later told Philip M. Boffey of
Science magazine: "Although
Stanford's gift receipts and annual fund
campaign have shown no precipitous
drop as yet, there are ominous signs for
the future." Pitzer explained that there
had been "an increasing number of
bona fide cases of people with real
money who had Stanford in their wills
and have actually rewritten their wills
to take Stanford out, which is a very
worrisome thing in terms of the long
run." Pitzer told Boofey that the loss in
potential gifts mounted up into the
"millions."
Most newspaper accounts
emphasized that Pitzer had resigned
because of on-campus pressures
resulting from the war in Indochina and
national polarization. But these factors,
while prominent in Pitzer's remarks,
were most important insofar as they
contributed to a campus situation
which donors felt Pitzer was not
handling adequately. .
As Stanford gears up tor a major
fund-raising campaign (now only in the
preliminary stages), comparable to the
1961-64 PACE program which netted
$114 million, a new man was needed.
The University president of today must
have excellent external relations while
managing to maintain internal
equilibrium. As law professor William
Baxter, who headed the faculty search
committee which helped to bring Pitzer
to Stanford, ventured at the time of
Pitzer's departure, Pitzer found the
presidency was not his "cup of tea."
Pitzer's problems looked much
worse to those on the outside than thev

actually were. A visible incident, like
the April Fool prank last spring, in
which a girl in the anti-ROTC
movement dumped red paint on Pitzer
while he was eating dinner at Grove
House, passed relatively unnoticed at
Stanford, but outside where prestige
and authority are counted differently,
this was deemed a measure of Pitzer's
inadequate grip on the situation here.
Pitzer has indicated that he intends
to take a leave of absence from
academia this year. It is expected that
some of his time will be spent at his
island house in Puget Sound. Pitzer has
said that he will not take a post
comparable to the presidency of
Stanford for at least three years.
Alf Brandin, Stanford's Vice
President for Business Affairs and
former Business Manager and Executive
Officer for Land Development, resigned
his post to become senior vice president
of Utah Construction and Mining
Company (on whose board of directors
he sits). Brandin was appointed
Business Manager in 1946, Executive
Officer for Land Developmenent in
1952, and Vice-President for Business
Affairs in 1 959. Under his aegis, the
value of the University's physical plant
increased more than $150 million and
95 0 of the University's 8,850 acres
were released for commercial
development. The University's land use
policy has received increasing criticism
from radicals and ecologists in the past
year. But Brandin told the Daily in an
interview last night that in his view,
"Change has been going on since the
world was invented, and some people
have always been opposed to changes."
Dean Bulkeley has decided after a
short tenure filled with turmoil to leave
the student services field and become
associate chairman of the department
of mechanical engineering. During his
14 months in the post, Bulkeley had
perhaps somewhat less than full
backing among the staff of the Dean of
Students office. Many of his staff felt
that he was vague on policy matters

and prone to come up with "wild
ideas," like his controversial plans of
this summer for checking campus
disruption.
The new acting dean of students,
Robert Freelan, has been director of
Student services in the dean's office
and an associate dean of students,
before President Lyman elevated him
to his present post. Bulkeley told the
Daily last night that he thought Freelan
was a "very able guy" and that he
thought he would "do a very effective
job."
In the wake of Bulkeley's
resignation, the whole matter of the
organization of student services is being
reviewed. The post of Dean of Students
has declined in importance since the
time when Joel Smith held the job.
This has been in part because of duties
being taken over by other
administrators in order to have a
division of labor in which the dean's
relationship to students was not
hopelessly conflicting. Another factor
has been the way in which the
temperment of whoever was dean
affected the size and importance of the
job.
In a August 28 memorandum,
President Lyman wrote: "Rather than
setting out immediately to create a
search committee to recommend
candidates for this vacancy, I have
decided to undertake a study of the
role of the deanship in light of the
changes within universities in recent
years. "
Bayless Manning of the law school
has informed President Lyman that he
plans to resign later this year, effective
during the summer of 1971. Lyman
said that the dean had given long
advance notice because he feels
strongly that his successor should be
designated as soon as possible so as to
permit him to be introduced to the job
during this academic year. No future
plans have been announced by
Manning.

division of labor in which the dean's
relationship to students was not
hopelessly conflicting. Another factor
has been the way in which the
temperment of whoever was dean
affected the size and importance of the
job.
In a August 28 memorandum,
President Lyman wrote: "Rather than
setting out immediately to create a
search committee to recommend
candidates for this vacancy, I have
decided to undertake a study of the
role of the deanship in light of the
changes within universities in recent
years. "
Bayless Manning of the law school
has informed President Lyman that he
plans to resign later this year, effective
during the summer of 1971. Lyman
said that the dean had given long
advance notice because he feels
strongly that his successor should be
designated as soon as possible so as to
permit him to be introduced to the job
during this academic year. No future
plans have been announced by
Manning.
Stanford's administrative structure
underwent a series of jolts this summer
as some of the University's major
figures decided to depart. The
resignation of President Kenneth S.
Pitzer made headlines across the nation,
but almost as important was the hole in
the hierarchy left by Vice-President for
Business Affairs Alf E. Brandin when
he quit the post he had held for
decades in charge of development of
Stanford's physical environment. Dean
of Students Peter Z. Bulkeley resigned
that job to return to Stanford's
engineering school. Bayless Manning,
dean of Stanford's law school and
member of the Scranton Commission,
also announced that this will be his last
year in the deanship.
The situation which led to Pitzer's
resignation was complex, but appears
to have been dominated by his
difficulties in obtaining support from
potential donors.
"The resignation was not forced,"
Pitzer told the press conference of June
27 at which he explained his departure.
"1 was concerned, however, by the
need for positive support in raising

funds . . . that is essential from the
trustees and other alumni.
"I must admit I felt that there were
sufficient weaknesses that needed to be
taken into account," he said.
Pitzer pointed out to the press that
he "felt we needed to be getting on
more vigorously with some things, and
there were potential donors who
seemed to be disaffected who might be
brought back into the fold."
Pitzer later told Philip M. Boffey of
Science magazine: "Although
Stanford's gift receipts and annual fund
campaign have shown no precipitous
drop as yet, there are ominous signs for
the future." Pitzer explained that there
had been "an increasing number of
bona fide cases of people with real
money who had Stanford in their wills
and have actually rewritten their wills
to take Stanford out, which is a very
worrisome thing in terms of the long
run." Pitzer told Boofey that the loss in
potential gifts mounted up into the
"millions."
Most newspaper accounts
emphasized that Pitzer had resigned
because of on-campus pressures
resulting from the war in Indochina and
national polarization. But these factors,
while prominent in Pitzer's remarks,
were most important insofar as they
contributed to a campus situation
which donors felt Pitzer was not
handling adequately. .
As Stanford gears up tor a major
fund-raising campaign (now only in the
preliminary stages), comparable to the
1961-64 PACE program which netted
$114 million, a new man was needed.
The University president of today must
have excellent external relations while
managing to maintain internal
equilibrium. As law professor William
Baxter, who headed the faculty search
committee which helped to bring Pitzer
to Stanford, ventured at the time of
Pitzer's departure, Pitzer found the
presidency was not his "cup of tea."
Pitzer's problems looked much
worse to those on the outside than thev

actually were. A visible incident, like
the April Fool prank last spring, in
which a girl in the anti-ROTC
movement dumped red paint on Pitzer
while he was eating dinner at Grove
House, passed relatively unnoticed at
Stanford, but outside where prestige
and authority are counted differently,
this was deemed a measure of Pitzer's
inadequate grip on the situation here.
Pitzer has indicated that he intends
to take a leave of absence from
academia this year. It is expected that
some of his time will be spent at his
island house in Puget Sound. Pitzer has
said that he will not take a post
comparable to the presidency of
Stanford for at least three years.
Alf Brandin, Stanford's Vice
President for Business Affairs and
former Business Manager and Executive
Officer for Land Development, resigned
his post to become senior vice president
of Utah Construction and Mining
Company (on whose board of directors
he sits). Brandin was appointed
Business Manager in 1946, Executive
Officer for Land Developmenent in
1952, and Vice-President for Business
Affairs in 1 959. Under his aegis, the
value of the University's physical plant
increased more than $150 million and
95 0 of the University's 8,850 acres
were released for commercial
development. The University's land use
policy has received increasing criticism
from radicals and ecologists in the past
year. But Brandin told the Daily in an
interview last night that in his view,
"Change has been going on since the
world was invented, and some people
have always been opposed to changes."
Dean Bulkeley has decided after a
short tenure filled with turmoil to leave
the student services field and become
associate chairman of the department
of mechanical engineering. During his
14 months in the post, Bulkeley had
perhaps somewhat less than full
backing among the staff of the Dean of
Students office. Many of his staff felt
that he was vague on policy matters

and prone to come up with "wild
ideas," like his controversial plans of
this summer for checking campus
disruption.
The new acting dean of students,
Robert Freelan, has been director of
Student services in the dean's office
and an associate dean of students,
before President Lyman elevated him
to his present post. Bulkeley told the
Daily last night that he thought Freelan
was a "very able guy" and that he
thought he would "do a very effective
job."
In the wake of Bulkeley's
resignation, the whole matter of the
organization of student services is being
reviewed. The post of Dean of Students
has declined in importance since the
time when Joel Smith held the job.
This has been in part because of duties
being taken over by other
administrators in order to have a
division of labor in which the dean's
relationship to students was not
hopelessly conflicting. Another factor
has been the way in which the

backing among the staff of the Dean of
Students office. Many of his staff felt
that he was vague on policy matters

and prone to come up with "wild
ideas," like his controversial plans of
this summer for checking campus
disruption.
The new acting dean of students,
Robert Freelan, has been director of
Student services in the dean's office
and an associate dean of students,
before President Lyman elevated him
to his present post. Bulkeley told the
Daily last night that he thought Freelan
was a "very able guy" and that he
thought he would "do a very effective
job."
In the wake of Bulkeley's
resignation, the whole matter of the
organization of student services is being
reviewed. The post of Dean of Students
has declined in importance since the
time when Joel Smith held the job.
This has been in part because of duties
being taken over by other
administrators in order to have a
division of labor in which the dean's
relationship to students was not
hopelessly conflicting. Another factor
has been the way in which the
temperment of whoever was dean
affected the size and importance of the
job.
In a August 28 memorandum,
President Lyman wrote: "Rather than
setting out immediately to create a
search committee to recommend
candidates for this vacancy, I have
decided to undertake a study of the
role of the deanship in light of the
changes within universities in recent
years. "
Bayless Manning of the law school
has informed President Lyman that he
plans to resign later this year, effective
during the summer of 1971. Lyman
said that the dean had given long
advance notice because he feels
strongly that his successor should be
designated as soon as possible so as to
permit him to be introduced to the job
during this academic year. No future
plans have been announced by
Manning.
Stanford's administrative structure
underwent a series of jolts this summer
as some of the University's major
figures decided to depart. The
resignation of President Kenneth S.
Pitzer made headlines across the nation,
but almost as important was the hole in
the hierarchy left by Vice-President for
Business Affairs Alf E. Brandin when
he quit the post he had held for
decades in charge of development of
Stanford's physical environment. Dean
of Students Peter Z. Bulkeley resigned
that job to return to Stanford's
engineering school. Bayless Manning,
dean of Stanford's law school and
member of the Scranton Commission,
also announced that this will be his last
year in the deanship.
The situation which led to Pitzer's
resignation was complex, but appears
to have been dominated by his
difficulties in obtaining support from
potential donors.
"The resignation was not forced,"
Pitzer told the press conference of June
27 at which he explained his departure.
"1 was concerned, however, by the
need for positive support in raising

funds . . . that is essential from the
trustees and other alumni.
"I must admit I felt that there were
sufficient weaknesses that needed to be
taken into account," he said.
Pitzer pointed out to the press that
he "felt we needed to be getting on
more vigorously with some things, and
there were potential donors who
seemed to be disaffected who might be
brought back into the fold."
Pitzer later told Philip M. Boffey of
Science magazine: "Although
Stanford's gift receipts and annual fund
campaign have shown no precipitous
drop as yet, there are ominous signs for
the future." Pitzer explained that there
had been "an increasing number of
bona fide cases of people with real
money who had Stanford in their wills
and have actually rewritten their wills
to take Stanford out, which is a very
worrisome thing in terms of the long
run." Pitzer told Boofey that the loss in
potential gifts mounted up into the
"millions."
Most newspaper accounts
emphasized that Pitzer had resigned
because of on-campus pressures
resulting from the war in Indochina and
national polarization. But these factors,
while prominent in Pitzer's remarks,
were most important insofar as they
contributed to a campus situation
which donors felt Pitzer was not
handling adequately. .
As Stanford gears up tor a major
fund-raising campaign (now only in the
preliminary stages), comparable to the
1961-64 PACE program which netted
$114 million, a new man was needed.
The University president of today must
have excellent external relations while
managing to maintain internal
equilibrium. As law professor William
Baxter, who headed the faculty search
committee which helped to bring Pitzer
to Stanford, ventured at the time of
Pitzer's departure, Pitzer found the
presidency was not his "cup of tea."
Pitzer's problems looked much
worse to those on the outside than thev

actually were. A visible incident, like
the April Fool prank last spring, in
which a girl in the anti-ROTC
movement dumped red paint on Pitzer
while he was eating dinner at Grove
House, passed relatively unnoticed at
Stanford, but outside where prestige
and authority are counted differently,
this was deemed a measure of Pitzer's
inadequate grip on the situation here.
Pitzer has indicated that he intends
to take a leave of absence from
academia this year. It is expected that
some of his time will be spent at his
island house in Puget Sound. Pitzer has
said that he will not take a post
comparable to the presidency of
Stanford for at least three years.
Alf Brandin, Stanford's Vice
President for Business Affairs and
former Business Manager and Executive
Officer for Land Development, resigned
his post to become senior vice president
of Utah Construction and Mining
Company (on whose board of directors
he sits). Brandin was appointed
Business Manager in 1946, Executive
Officer for Land Developmenent in
1952, and Vice-President for Business
Affairs in 1 959. Under his aegis, the
value of the University's physical plant
increased more than $150 million and
95 0 of the University's 8,850 acres
were released for commercial
development. The University's land use
policy has received increasing criticism
from radicals and ecologists in the past
year. But Brandin told the Daily in an
interview last night that in his view,
"Change has been going on since the
world was invented, and some people
have always been opposed to changes."
Dean Bulkeley has decided after a
short tenure filled with turmoil to leave
the student services field and become
associate chairman of the department
of mechanical engineering. During his
