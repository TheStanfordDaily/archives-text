# Faculty Senate Vote Ends ROTC, But Modified Program Continues
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Alter a faculty decision in June to
phase out all ROTC programs beginning
this fall, Navy and university officials
have worked out a compromise to
allow 20 entering freshmen with
NROTC scholarships to complete a
three-year program without academic
credit.
In June the Faculty Senate endorsed
the recommendation of a
faculty-student committee that no
students be allowed to enroll in any
ROTC program as currently constituted
after August 31,1 97 0. It also urged the
president to award scholarships,
"within the limits of Stanford's
financial aid policies," to freshmen who
have been admitted this fall with ROTC
scholarships.
Although some observers disagree,
the administration and Navy officials
have called the compromise agreement
within the "spirit" of the
Senate-approved report through the
Senate was unable to consider the issue
because it did not meet during the
summer.
The officials feel the compromise is
necessary since approximately 20
NROTC scholarship winners could not
be placed in other universities because
of the late date of the Senate action.
Also, not enough available University
scholarship funds could be found to
replace the entering NROTC students'
lost scholarship money.
Navy Compromise
The compromise for the Navy
freshmen specifies that their program
will be non-credit, and that they will
finish their ROTC classes in three years.
The "spirit" of the report is
maintained, officials say, because
without credit the program is different
from the one the faculty decided to
phase out and because the University
does not have enough money to replace
the ROTC scholarships. It is only a
one-year arrangement.

The committee report of last spring
also urged the president to begin
discussions with the Defense
Department about possibilities for a
new officer training program involving
off-campus training.
The original report concluded "that
given the present climate of opinion at
Stanford, ROTC in its existing form is
not destined to continue."
Committee Recommendations
The committee recommended that
the president take appropriate steps to:
—ensure that no one be allowed to
enroll in any ROTC program as
currently constituted after August 31,
1 970.
allow ROTC units to remain at the
University as long as it is absolutely
necessary to permit students currently
enrolled to complete their programs.
—initiate discussions with the
Defense Department "to determine
whether an alternative officer training
can be organized for Stanford
students" in which training would be
conducted off campus with normal
academic courses taught by regular.

Lyman Position
However, during his press
conference on Friday, President
Richard Lyman indicated that the
military had not received the suggestion
for a new military training program
with much enthusiasm. He said he is
pessimistic about any future for
military training here.
The committee had hoped that
through "cohesive and congruent
action" by several university presidents,
the new military training program
might be organized by the fall of 1972
to allow freshmen students entering
Stanford in the fall of 1970 to
participate in some two-year concept of
the program.
The Navy ROTC will have an
enrollment of about 80 this year
including the 20 freshmen and the
Army will have about 70 cadets with
no freshmen. Air Force ROTC had
previously announced that it was
leaving Stanford by the end of the
school year and will have only a few
cadets enrolled.

does not have enough money to replace
the ROTC scholarships. It is only a
one-year arrangement.

The committee report of last spring
also urged the president to begin
discussions with the Defense
Department about possibilities for a
new officer training program involving
off-campus training.
The original report concluded "that
given the present climate of opinion at
Stanford, ROTC in its existing form is
not destined to continue."
Committee Recommendations
The committee recommended that
the president take appropriate steps to:
—ensure that no one be allowed to
enroll in any ROTC program as
currently constituted after August 31,
1 970.
allow ROTC units to remain at the
University as long as it is absolutely
necessary to permit students currently
enrolled to complete their programs.
—initiate discussions with the
Defense Department "to determine
whether an alternative officer training
can be organized for Stanford
students" in which training would be
conducted off campus with normal
academic courses taught by regular.

Lyman Position
However, during his press
conference on Friday, President
Richard Lyman indicated that the
military had not received the suggestion
for a new military training program
with much enthusiasm. He said he is
pessimistic about any future for
military training here.
The committee had hoped that
through "cohesive and congruent
action" by several university presidents,
the new military training program
might be organized by the fall of 1972
to allow freshmen students entering
Stanford in the fall of 1970 to
participate in some two-year concept of
the program.
The Navy ROTC will have an
enrollment of about 80 this year
including the 20 freshmen and the
Army will have about 70 cadets with
no freshmen. Air Force ROTC had
previously announced that it was
leaving Stanford by the end of the
school year and will have only a few
cadets enrolled.
Alter a faculty decision in June to
phase out all ROTC programs beginning
this fall, Navy and university officials
have worked out a compromise to
allow 20 entering freshmen with
NROTC scholarships to complete a
three-year program without academic
credit.
In June the Faculty Senate endorsed
the recommendation of a
faculty-student committee that no
students be allowed to enroll in any
ROTC program as currently constituted
after August 31,1 97 0. It also urged the
president to award scholarships,
"within the limits of Stanford's
financial aid policies," to freshmen who
have been admitted this fall with ROTC
scholarships.
Although some observers disagree,
the administration and Navy officials
have called the compromise agreement
within the "spirit" of the
Senate-approved report through the
Senate was unable to consider the issue
because it did not meet during the
summer.
The officials feel the compromise is
necessary since approximately 20
NROTC scholarship winners could not
be placed in other universities because
of the late date of the Senate action.
Also, not enough available University
scholarship funds could be found to
replace the entering NROTC students'
lost scholarship money.
Navy Compromise
The compromise for the Navy
freshmen specifies that their program
will be non-credit, and that they will
finish their ROTC classes in three years.
The "spirit" of the report is
maintained, officials say, because
without credit the program is different
from the one the faculty decided to
phase out and because the University
does not have enough money to replace
the ROTC scholarships. It is only a
one-year arrangement.
