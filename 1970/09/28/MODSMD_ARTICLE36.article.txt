# Police Confront Tenants Union; Protest, Meeting Set For Today
## 
### 
More than 50 members of the
radical Palo Alto Tenants Union
(PATU) were prevented by Stanford
Police from setting up a "tent city" in
the Oval yesterday afternoon.
Earlier in the afternoon, Palo Alto
Police ordered a larger group to leave
the "PATU Park" at Webster and
Channing Streets. They did so without
incident, and most of them went to the
campus.
As the PATU protesters arrived,
police officers announced that the
group was not welcome and should
leave campus or risk possible arrest
under trespassing statues, according to
PATU spokesman JimShoch- Campus
police later declined comment.

The purpose of the demonstration
was to dramatize the local housing
shortage. The group plans today to set
up tents and talk with students about
the housing situation in the grove of
trees between Memorial Auditorium
and the Old Pavilion.
Tonight the group plans to discuss
their grievances with the Radical
Caucus at an open meeting in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
Planned speakers are Revolutionary
Union (RU) members Janet Weiss and
Jane Franklin, RU and PATU member
Jim Shoch, and Kenny Horston,
chairman of the Black Panther workers'
caucus at the Fremont General Motors
plant.
