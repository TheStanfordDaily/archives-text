# During Convocation
## Protest Greets President 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Richard Lyman weathered his first
demonstration after 32 hours in office
and warned 1 400 freshmen Friday
night in his convocation address that
the University's "body is being fought
over" and its "soul imperiled."
Speaking to a packed Memorial
Church audience that included six
plainclothes security officers and a
videotape camera that watched over the
crowd from the balcony, Lyman spoke
against the dangers of a politicized
university.
At the start of his speech he was
greeted by small groups of
demonstrators, organized by the New
Left Project, who chanted "Give 'em
the Axe!", a cheer normally reserved
for Big Game.
In his remarks, Lyman raised "the
very real question of protecting the
University itself against becoming
thoroughly politicized and therefore no
longer free", and insisted that feelings
of desperation and fears of repression
do not justify the adoption of a
university stance on political issues.
Political Propaganda
To take such a stance would be to
abandon "the diversity and openess of
the universities... in favor of
institutional commitment and the
product of political propaganda," the
president claimed.
Lyman warned that such political
activity would jeopardize the
university's tax-exempt status, and
would subject the university to direct
political pressure from "political
interests very different from the
political interests that are most active
and prominent on the campus today.
"There is nothing in the law of
nature that says a politicized university
must always be politicized in favor of
peace, freedom, and equality." Lyman
then quoted socialist Carl Landauer
who said, "Once the rule of
institutional neutrality was abrogated,
the political Right would be more

effective than the Left in using the
universities for its own purposes."
Individual Role
Although he stressed that the
primary relation of the university to
politics should be teaching and learning
more about it, Lyman acknowledged
the role of individual students in direct
political participation.
But he chided the majority of young
people between the ages of 18 and 2 4
for shirking their political
responsibilities. "Your own age group
doesn't for the most part even seize the
threshold opportunity for political
involvement â€” the right to work and
vote in elections.
"I'd like, with all due respect to the
amount that young people have
accomplished in American politics,
from Alexander Hamilton to Julian
Bond, to challenge you to make of the
youth movement in American political
life something more durable, more
constructive and more significant than
the headline-hunting antics of
Weathermen and Yippies.
Wisconsin Bombers
"If the political voice of youth is to
be the voice of the Wisconsin bombers,
nihilism and despair will be the only
winners."
The audience applauded
enthusiastically at the conclusion of
Lyman's speech, which was noticeably
void of the usual laudatory references
to the class' median SAT scores and its
percentage of high school student body
presidents.

Earlier in the program, Patrick C.
Shea of the Associated Students
Council of Presidents warned the
freshmen of "groups on campus which
thrive on polarization.
Peace And Serenity
"If your tactics are tactics of
violence and hate, you will never
restore peace or serenity or human
relationships."
He called on the new students to
succeed where his class had failed in
trying to prevent bullying and coercion,
vandalism and destruction.
Shea was followed by Albert
Hastorf, the dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Hastorf's
speech was marked by peaceful
picketing organized by the Workers'
Action Caucus. The group of 15
demonstrators filed silently in front of
the altar, then paraded along one side
of the church, down the middle aisle,
and out a side exit.
Members of the academic procession
and most students politely ignored the
demonstrators who carried placards
reading, "200 Houses for 7000
Workers", "Who Picked Lyman?", and
"The Trustees Didn't Get There By
Working."
Special Assistant to the President,
John Schwartz said that none of the
night's protest activity constituted a
disruption, and that "no tapes or
pictures would be filed. The videotape
of the convocation will either be erased
or reused for future events," said
Schwartz.
