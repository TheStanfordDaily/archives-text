# Richard W. Lyman
## 
### 
Richard Lyman comes to office with widespread,
enthusiastic support marred only by scattered protest such
as Friday night's. He is intelligent, articulate, honest, and
capable. The only question in most minds about his
appointment is why it took two and a half months to select
him.
Lyman is unquestionably the best man for Stanford of
the nine or ten national frontrunners that the search
committees focused on. He knows the local scene with its
personalities, special problems, and the urgencies of the
vacant deanships and other posts. He is sympathetic for the
most part to student grievances. He listens and observes well.
But all these qualities beg further questions, and these
points imply certain values. They betray a definite view that
illustrates some real problems with Richard Lyman as
president.
First and foremost, he is a man of the traditional
university. He believes that the university is and must remain
an ivory tower, for Lyman looks upon it as the pinnacle of
modern civilization. Critical of this belief are those who
challenge the university's claim to neutrality and its actual
competence.
To be fair, Lyman welcomes faculty-conceived and
faculty-bred changes, but he is not an individual who can
easily understand student emotions over Cambodia and the
feeling that classroom schooling can be put aside for a while.
He sent a telegram to Nixon in protest to the invasion of
Cambodia, but he refused to budge an inch from his position
that SRI-Stanford Industrial Park should not take the time
to help stop the war.
His supporters cite this stance as true conviction that will
give the campus community the guidance and
self-confidence that it needs. But this path may lead to the
same problems we faced last May. Does a settled, separated
life have priority over the imperative duty to halt a society
which races around the world dispensing death, "freedom,"
and arrogant technology? To pose the question more
ironically, how can Stanford, which has contributed so
much to American society, claim to be innocently alongside
it, only perusing books and tinkering in laboratories?
His supporters claim that he is principled and
straightforward in all his dealings. One cannot find a more
honest man, they boast. Counter to this, his opponents grant
his integrity and welcome it, but once again this strength
does not convey the complete man.

Lyman can be brutally rough in conversation. His
forceful opinions take on the aspect of aloofness and
insensitivity, and he probably drives mild opponents far
away from a possible understanding of the issues at hand.
Certainly he was not impressive in spring of 1968 when he
glowered at students upset by a stacked judicial system.
He has tried very hard to shake this image, but it persists.
Last year his office resembled a bunker with its locked front
door and guarded rear entrance. Even when he took to
KZSU to explain himself, his remarks showed a lofty
frostiness and barely suppressed impatience with his student
questioners.
But this last criticism is a question of manner, and there
arc more important grounds on which to evaluate Lyman.
His attitude towards educational reform is characterized by
a wary acceptance as though reform were a fad to be
accomodated partially rather than clumsily opposed. He is
above all a strict academician and almost instinctively
suspicious of the hazy but heartfelt ciies for "relevance" and
"meaningful education."
These demands for educational overhaul cannot be
ignored or channeled aside safely. Lyman sees this, but it is
doubtful that he will be much of a leader or profound
thinker in the field of academic innovation. His strict,
unflinching demands for "excellence" may quash the kind
of enthusiasm needed for change.
A lot remains before him though. He can shift the whole
motion of the university by appointing a business manager
who accepts the full responsibility of being one of the
largest employers and land developers in Santa Clara county.
The vacant Dean of Students position gives Lyman a chance
to rethink the role of the office and hopefully steer it clear
of bureaucracy and involved organizational schemes. Neither
Brandin nor Bulkeley were outstanding, and hopefully
President Lyman will avoid the criteria used in hiring both.
Just as important, but less visible to most students are the
vacant deanships in the schools of education, law and
medicine aloug with a replacement for Lyman as provost.
The men chosen here will have tremendous influence in
American society in their fields..
Lyman is one of the few who come to power on the
shoulders of so many beaming, adoring followers. He should
be careful that his halo does not embarrass him.

He has tried very hard to shake this image, but it persists.
Last year his office resembled a bunker with its locked front
door and guarded rear entrance. Even when he took to
KZSU to explain himself, his remarks showed a lofty
frostiness and barely suppressed impatience with his student
questioners.
But this last criticism is a question of manner, and there
arc more important grounds on which to evaluate Lyman.
His attitude towards educational reform is characterized by
a wary acceptance as though reform were a fad to be
accomodated partially rather than clumsily opposed. He is
above all a strict academician and almost instinctively
suspicious of the hazy but heartfelt ciies for "relevance" and
"meaningful education."
These demands for educational overhaul cannot be
ignored or channeled aside safely. Lyman sees this, but it is
doubtful that he will be much of a leader or profound
thinker in the field of academic innovation. His strict,
unflinching demands for "excellence" may quash the kind
of enthusiasm needed for change.
A lot remains before him though. He can shift the whole
motion of the university by appointing a business manager
who accepts the full responsibility of being one of the
largest employers and land developers in Santa Clara county.
The vacant Dean of Students position gives Lyman a chance
to rethink the role of the office and hopefully steer it clear
of bureaucracy and involved organizational schemes. Neither
Brandin nor Bulkeley were outstanding, and hopefully
President Lyman will avoid the criteria used in hiring both.
Just as important, but less visible to most students are the
vacant deanships in the schools of education, law and
medicine aloug with a replacement for Lyman as provost.
The men chosen here will have tremendous influence in
American society in their fields..
Lyman is one of the few who come to power on the
shoulders of so many beaming, adoring followers. He should
be careful that his halo does not embarrass him.

Richard Lyman comes to office with widespread,
enthusiastic support marred only by scattered protest such
as Friday night's. He is intelligent, articulate, honest, and
capable. The only question in most minds about his
appointment is why it took two and a half months to select
him.
Lyman is unquestionably the best man for Stanford of
the nine or ten national frontrunners that the search
committees focused on. He knows the local scene with its
personalities, special problems, and the urgencies of the
vacant deanships and other posts. He is sympathetic for the
most part to student grievances. He listens and observes well.
But all these qualities beg further questions, and these
points imply certain values. They betray a definite view that
illustrates some real problems with Richard Lyman as
president.
First and foremost, he is a man of the traditional
university. He believes that the university is and must remain
an ivory tower, for Lyman looks upon it as the pinnacle of
modern civilization. Critical of this belief are those who
challenge the university's claim to neutrality and its actual
competence.
To be fair, Lyman welcomes faculty-conceived and
faculty-bred changes, but he is not an individual who can
easily understand student emotions over Cambodia and the
feeling that classroom schooling can be put aside for a while.
He sent a telegram to Nixon in protest to the invasion of
Cambodia, but he refused to budge an inch from his position
that SRI-Stanford Industrial Park should not take the time
to help stop the war.
His supporters cite this stance as true conviction that will
give the campus community the guidance and
self-confidence that it needs. But this path may lead to the
same problems we faced last May. Does a settled, separated
life have priority over the imperative duty to halt a society
which races around the world dispensing death, "freedom,"
and arrogant technology? To pose the question more
ironically, how can Stanford, which has contributed so
much to American society, claim to be innocently alongside
it, only perusing books and tinkering in laboratories?
His supporters claim that he is principled and
straightforward in all his dealings. One cannot find a more
honest man, they boast. Counter to this, his opponents grant
his integrity and welcome it, but once again this strength
does not convey the complete man.

Lyman can be brutally rough in conversation. His
forceful opinions take on the aspect of aloofness and
insensitivity, and he probably drives mild opponents far
away from a possible understanding of the issues at hand.
Certainly he was not impressive in spring of 1968 when he
glowered at students upset by a stacked judicial system.
He has tried very hard to shake this image, but it persists.
