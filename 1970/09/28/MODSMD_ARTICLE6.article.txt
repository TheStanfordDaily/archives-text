# rough draft
## II-S Or Not II-S 
### strain edwards 
Strange as it may seem, many
draft-age men are actively seeking
a I-A classification this fall. This
unusual phenomenon is closely
tied to the recent announcement
by Curtis Tarr, Director of
Selective Service, that draft calls
for the rest of this year
"probably" would not go over the
lottery number 195. If Tarr's
prediction holds true, men with
lottery numbers above 200 who
assume their liability in the
priority selection group this year
will probably escape the draft
altogether. This explains the
scramble.
Selective Service is not
particularly happy about this
development. Some men who
have requested reclassification to
1-A while continuing as full-time
students have been told by their
boards that they cannot be
reclassified as long as they remain
in school. Furthermore, a
"confidential" memorandum
circulated within Selective Service
indicates that Selective Service
may attempt to set a deadline this
fall after which a student cannot
relinquish his 11-Sand get into this
year's priority group.
Either action would seem to
contradict President Nixon's
declaration that a major reason
for the lottery was to eliminate
the uncertainties of the draft for
as many men as possible.
Furthermore, if verification of
student status is not submitted
each year, regulations would seem
to require reclassification.
Stanford does not verify
student status without the

student's request and permission.
It is also the opinion of local
attorneys familiar with draft law
that since the 11-S is granted only
at the request of the student and
serves his interests, he should be
able to relinquish it any time he
wishes. However, it may well
require rulings by the Federal
Courts to clarify the intent of the
new regulations and the proper
procedure for local boards to
follow.
For those who wish to be
reclassified we recommend two
actions. First, do not request that
Stanford certify your student
status. To do this, you should
destroy the yellow card in your
registration packet which serves in
lieu of the SSS Form 109 as
certification from Stanford that
you are a full-time student.
(Please do complete and return
the white confidential card from
the Special Services Office. This
card is solely for our use in
counseling men and for assessing
the impact of the draft on
Stanford students.)
Second, you should notify
your board that you wish to be
reclassified I-A and to assume
your liability in the priority
selection group this year. You
should keep a copy of this
notification and send the original
to your board, certified mail with
return receipt requested. This will
establish the date you requested
reclassification and entry into the
priority group in case of a
reclassification deadline or various
Federal Court tests. Several draft
attorneys in this area have

especially recommended this
notification.
If you have any questions
about this or other Selective
Service matters, come to room
324 Old Union or call extension
3381.

"confidential" memorandum
circulated within Selective Service
indicates that Selective Service
may attempt to set a deadline this
fall after which a student cannot
relinquish his 11-Sand get into this
year's priority group.
Either action would seem to
contradict President Nixon's
declaration that a major reason
for the lottery was to eliminate
the uncertainties of the draft for
as many men as possible.
Furthermore, if verification of
student status is not submitted
each year, regulations would seem
to require reclassification.
Stanford does not verify
student status without the

student's request and permission.
It is also the opinion of local
attorneys familiar with draft law
that since the 11-S is granted only
at the request of the student and
serves his interests, he should be
able to relinquish it any time he
wishes. However, it may well
require rulings by the Federal
Courts to clarify the intent of the
new regulations and the proper
procedure for local boards to
follow.
For those who wish to be
reclassified we recommend two
actions. First, do not request that
Stanford certify your student
status. To do this, you should
destroy the yellow card in your
registration packet which serves in
lieu of the SSS Form 109 as
certification from Stanford that
you are a full-time student.
(Please do complete and return
the white confidential card from
the Special Services Office. This
card is solely for our use in
counseling men and for assessing
the impact of the draft on
Stanford students.)
Second, you should notify
your board that you wish to be
reclassified I-A and to assume
your liability in the priority
selection group this year. You
should keep a copy of this
notification and send the original
to your board, certified mail with
return receipt requested. This will
establish the date you requested
reclassification and entry into the
priority group in case of a
reclassification deadline or various
Federal Court tests. Several draft
attorneys in this area have

especially recommended this
notification.
If you have any questions
about this or other Selective
Service matters, come to room
324 Old Union or call extension
3381.

Strange as it may seem, many
draft-age men are actively seeking
a I-A classification this fall. This
unusual phenomenon is closely
tied to the recent announcement
by Curtis Tarr, Director of
Selective Service, that draft calls
for the rest of this year
"probably" would not go over the
lottery number 195. If Tarr's
prediction holds true, men with
lottery numbers above 200 who
assume their liability in the
priority selection group this year
will probably escape the draft
altogether. This explains the
scramble.
Selective Service is not
particularly happy about this
development. Some men who
have requested reclassification to
1-A while continuing as full-time
students have been told by their
boards that they cannot be
reclassified as long as they remain
in school. Furthermore, a
"confidential" memorandum
circulated within Selective Service
indicates that Selective Service
may attempt to set a deadline this
fall after which a student cannot
relinquish his 11-Sand get into this
