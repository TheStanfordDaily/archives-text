Dear Subscriber:
We hope that you enjoyed
reading the Stanford Daily last
year and will want to renew your
subscription for the coming year.
The Daily staff is new and
enthusiastic and will be able to
give you a comprehensive and
vital account of the Stanford
world every day.
Resubscription is easy: if you'll
send the enclosed order blank
along with your check, in the
postpaid reply envelope, 1 will be
happy to start your subscription
immediately Autumn Quarter.
The Daily hopes to hear from
you soon.
Circulation Mgr.
Dear Jean:
I'm getting such a laugh from
your use of this word. I wanted to

share it with you, Jean!
By "new" you have to mean
Conservative - now do you
understand my amusement? Or
haven't you been reading the
Daily for the last four years?!
Sorry but we'll pass - we are
sending instead, a campaign
contribution to Jim Buckley
hoping he can replace Charles
Goodell as Senator from New
York - say - there is a possible
subscription you might sell - just a
suggestion.
Mrs. Merrill Warner
Dear Editor-
Your paper contains too much
news about activities not related
to the campus. World .and radical
news can be read in any paper.
Your sports coverage is very poor.
Campus activity and campus

news could be greatly improved.
Last year's paper was a poor
excuse for a school paper.
L.J. Dwulet, M.D.
Gentleman:
As a subscriber for 3 years I
find it unbelievable in (sic) your
total lack of objectivity in
reporting the news. If the
Stanford Editorial staff are all of
the same political mind, they can
all parrot one another one another
on the editorial page. However
any real good newspaper will
attempt two things:
1. Objective reporting on the
front page.
2. Proper selection of news
items to reflect both sides.
Headlines that are not slanted.
Yours truly,
Donald Weed
