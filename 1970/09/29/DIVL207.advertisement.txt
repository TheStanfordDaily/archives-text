The Daily welcomes
contributions from its readers in
the form of letters to the editor,
columns, or graphic designs. Letters
and columns should be typed
double-spaced on a 62-space line,
and the author should be identified
by name and other relevant
information. Names will be
withheld on request.
Articles of 250 words or less will
be considered as letters to the
editor.
All items submitted will be
considered for publication.
However, the Daily reserves the
right to edit pieces due to space
restrictions, which are tight. We
will, when phone numbers are
provided, endeavor to contact the
author to ascertain that the sense or
the article has been preserved.
