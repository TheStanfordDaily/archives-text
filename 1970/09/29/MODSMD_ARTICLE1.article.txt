# New Trustees Cast Liberal Image
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Over the summer alumni elected
four of their fellow graduates to the
Board of Trustees. In a result that
surprised many, the alumni elected four
men who are expected to bring
moderate to liberal viewpoints to the
Board.
The new members are Najeeb E.
Halaby, president and chief executive
of Pan American World Airways; Ira De
Voyd Hall, executive director of the
Stanford Mid-Peninsula Urban
Coalition; Denis Hayes, national
coordinator of the Environmental
Teach-in and ASSU president in
1968-9; and Alan Weeden, president of
Weeden & Co., an investment banking
firm.
The election was divided into two
age groups with all alumni voting for
two candidates 36 years of age or older
and two candidates 35 years of age or
younger.
Halaby was the top vote-getter in
the 36 or older class with 10,246
ballots out of 24 ,856 cast. He will serve
until June 1974. Weeden will hold
office until June 1 973.
Hall Tops Group
In the younger age group, Hall ran
first with 8,582 votes, and he will serve
until June 1974. Hayes will sit on the
Board until June 1 973.
With the addition of the four new
members, the Board will expand to 28
members. A total of 88,628 ballots
were mailed to alumni.
The two winners in each age group
were selected from nine candidates in
each group. Twelve of the total number
of candidates had been selected by
Alumni Association officials, and six
candidates running on a strongly
conservative joint platform made the
ballot by petition. None of the
conservative slate was elected.
New Founders League
A small group of alumni, calling
themselves the "New Founders
League," have challenged the election
results. Paul C. Wilbur, who is president

of the four month-old group and a
retired San Jose electronics executive,
branded the election a "farce" and said
"the 'election' should be challenged in
court."
He said the alumni had not been
told beforehand that the Board of
Trustees could veto the results. He
doubted whether the election
represented the feeling of alumni since
the top vote-getter, Halaby, was
supported by only 12 per cent of all alumni.

Halaby comes to the board with a
strong conviction of the Board's

importance in campus life. In his
position statement in the Alumni
Almanac he declared, "The job of a
trustee is to set policies for the
governing of the University; to appoint
a President and to remove him if he
should not measure up; and to establish
and maintain an educational system
which fits the graduate for being a
creative, productive individual ..."
Place For Listening
He added that a university "should
be a place of quiet listening as well as
intense debate; of scholarliness as well
as advocacy; a dynamic
atmosphere ..." Halaby concluded
♦hat "It will, therefore, be the difficul'

task of the new Trustees to help restore
that kind of environment."
The Pan Am Executive is a member
of the class of 1937 and has a strong
background in business and
government. He served with the Federal
Aviation Agency and the Defense
Department during his career before
taking over as head of Pan American.
He is a trustee of the Urban Coalition
and a member of U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, and Planned
Parenthood-World Population.

Ira Hall was surprised at his first
meeting of the board, which he
attended two weeks ago. "The center
of gravity was much further from the
right than I'd thought," commented
the soft-spoken Hall. He was pleased
with the decision by the trustees to
build 2 00 units of low-income housing.
Though he voluntarily abstained from
discussing the proposal since he is head
of the Urban Coalition which will
oversee the construction of the project,
Hall "was pleased at how well the
meeting went. The vote was unanimous
and several members spoke in favor."
Monolithic Board
Later, in an interview with the
Daily, he described the board members
as "from the same general walk of life.
Their perceptions of how their
decisions will effect people are alike.
They are fairly narrow-minded." He
felt that there was "a tremendous age
gap between them and Denis (Hayes)
and myself."
Hall plans to meet often with Black
Student Union leaders and black
professors. He also is concerned with
the "impact of Stanford on the
surrounding community, its
employment practices, and its land
development policies." Hall emphasized
that "we (Stanford) are a very strong
factor."
The new trustee viewed the
Industrial Park as an example of the
university's misguided social planning.

"Stanford thought it was making a
contribution. There were young
graduates who developed ideas and
wanted to start business. Now they're
all over the world and have a quarter
billion dollars in sales each year."
Growth Unpredictable
Hall felt that the University
administration "couldn't predict their
growth. I don't think they saw the
impact." He pointed to the broad Lax
base that the industries provided for
Palo Alto as being partly responsible
for the housing shortage in the
mid-peninsula area. "Palo Alto is a
pretty pleasant place to live in, but it's
damn near impossible to buy a house
for under $25,0 00
Hall was president of his graduating
class in 1 966. He lives in East Palo
Alto, and worked for Hewlett-Packard
Co. in the Industrial Park before joining
the Urban Coalition. Now he works
with Nairobi College in the fields of
finance and planning.

Denis Hayes probably has had the
most publicized contact with the
board, and he approaches his job
warily. "I'm not even sure that there
should be a board, and certainly not
one like the one now."
'Subtle. Arsenal'
He feels the board has "a subtle
arsenal. They have a capacity to shape
some long range decisions." He
admitted that their control was not as
direct as some claimed; "otherwise I

think we'd be operating in the 1953
situation."
Hayes supported the decision to ban
ROTC from campus. "Military training
is appropriate in military academies. 1
don't think that the values inherent in
military training are pro-life." He
added, "I'm far less concerned with
university-DOD contracts than with
DOD contracts in general."
In his position statement in the

Almanac. Hayes ruefully assessed his
role: "If elected, 1 will, for a time, be a
token: the youngest member--the only
student—the only poor Trustee. It
would be unlikely for me,

singlehandedly, to reverse University
land policies, or challenge the implicit
values in its investment portfolio, or
dramatically rechannel its resources and
priorities into an affirmation of life."
Hayes In Sit-in
Two Springs ago, Hayes participated
for a while in a sit-in which protested
the classified research at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory. "AEL was a
beautiful, happy time," he recalled last
week. We were showing what life could
be like. The media showed this, I think,
and there was great support for us."
In addition to being a leader of the
Environmental Teach-in, Hayes is a
former member of the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition and a contributer to
the Progressive and New York Times.
"f*
Alan Weeden is probably the least
recognizable of the new trustees. He is
a quietly articulate man from
Larchmont, New York, a placid,
bedroom suburb. Weeden is trim,
tanned athletic man who enjoys
swimming, sailing, and birdwatching.
He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1945.
Lindsay-Goodell Republican
The new trustee styles himself as a
"Lindsay-Goodell Republican."
Weeden feels, "Most of the things that
students are opposed to I am opposed
to as well. I'm totally against the war
and have been for years, and we've
been doing a terrible job in terms of the
environment."
He decided to run for the post
because "1 love Stanford, and I got a
tremendous amount out of it. Now I
want to pay a little of the debt back."
He was surprised at his election but
explained that he had three brothers
who attended Stanford along with him.

"1 guess a few of them thought I was
one of my brothers," Weeden smiled.
Though he opposes the war, he
favors retention of ROTC on campus.
"I realize that this war is unpopular,
but when you do return to more
normal times, we may need good
officers. The officers from Stanford
will be a lot better than those from
West Point."
Weeden describes himself as "pretty
strong conservationist and a great
admirer of Dr. Paul Ehrlich." At
present he serves as chairman of
Mamaroneck, New York, Conservation
Advisory Committee.
He favors "the trend to push the
decision process down lower." In his
position paper he supported "the
organizational moves, begun under Dr.
Wallace Sterling, designed to diffuse the
power of the presidency by delegating
more governmental responsibility to
the faculty and student body."
