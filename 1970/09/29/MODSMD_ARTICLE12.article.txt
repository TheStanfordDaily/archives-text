# Campaigning on White Plaza
## Gubser Defends His Record 
### BILL CLASTER 
Congressman Charles Gubser
(R-California) talked for over an
hour yesterday afternoon with a
group of about 85 passersby on
White Plaza and at the Tresidder
patio.
The 18-year veteran of the
House, running against Stewart
McLean in the 10 th congressional
district, fielded questions from
passing students, including several
McLean supporters who
persistently asked Gubser
questions about his voting record,
the key issue in McLean's
campaign. Gubser, hot and
perspiring in the afternoon sun,
consistently demanded proof of
the voting record which the
questioners attributed to him.
The questions touched on civil
rights, ABM, school desegregation,
Congressional seniority, the

18-year-old vote, Vietnam and
Cambodia.

The fifth-ranking Republican
on the House Armed Services
Committee was bombarded with
questions on foreign affairs.
Though professing to be "no
expert" on the subject he went
into some detail explaining his
econometric model for conversion
of a wartime to a peacetime
economy
McLean supporters also pressed
the congressman on his apparent
refusal to debate McLean in
public. The congressman replied,
"I'd clobber him." When pressed
further, Gubser said that he was
very busy and probably could not
fit a debate into his schedule, but
might consider such a meeting if
proper groundrules could be
drawn up. "If I could have, say,
72 hours notice about what

specific bills he wanted to discuss,
I might agree."
Don Ayer, president of the
campus Young Republican
chapter, told the DAILY later
that all but the last details of a
McLean-Gubser forum had been
arranged.
Several questioners asked
Gubser why he did not vote to
limit funds for the controversial
SST (supersonic transport) plane.
Gubser said that he and
Congressman Paul N. "Pete"
McClosky (R-Calif.), to whom
Gubser referred several times
during the afternoon, "walked
down the House aisle past the
teller on that vote together," and
that he did not vote as McLean
supporters claimed.
Lack of Consistency
Gubser also discussed
unemployment in the aerospace
industry in his district, attributing

much of the problem to "the lack
of consistency of policy in the
country on defense matters. In
1 960, John Kennedy won because
he claimed there was a missle gap.
I said there was no gap. Four
weeks later Secretary McNamara
agreed with me that there was no
gap."
Gubser appeared confident of
re-election, claiming that "in
every poll, at worst I am leading
60-40."
After leaving the crowd at
White Plaza, Gubser commented
that questions about specifics of
his record, such as were asked at
the Plaza, were "utterly
ridiculous" and "plain nuts."
Gubser added "When a man has
no record, (McLean) asking details
of an 18 year record is not right."
At one point in the often
pointed discussion, Gubser
cracked, "Well, scholars don't
know everything," to which an
observer replied, "Neither do
Congressmen."
Against 18-year-old Vote
The congressman also said that
he favored student participation
in congressional hearings, but
voted against the eighteen year
old vote, as passed by the House,
because he felt that the proper
way to lower the voting age was
through a Constitutional
amendment rather than a federal
law.
When asked about problems of
State Mental Health Hospitals in
California, Gubser said that he
didn't know much about them,
and that "California is a big state
and it is hard to keep track of all
the problems."
Moving into the area of vote
fraud, Gubser said that while he
agreed that "the 1 967 Vietnamese
elections were not free, neither
were the 1968 elections in
Chicago."

Congressman Charles Gubser
(R-California) talked for over an
hour yesterday afternoon with a
group of about 85 passersby on
White Plaza and at the Tresidder
patio.
The 18-year veteran of the
House, running against Stewart
McLean in the 10 th congressional
district, fielded questions from
passing students, including several
McLean supporters who
persistently asked Gubser
questions about his voting record,
the key issue in McLean's
campaign. Gubser, hot and
perspiring in the afternoon sun,
consistently demanded proof of
the voting record which the
questioners attributed to him.
The questions touched on civil
rights, ABM, school desegregation,
Congressional seniority, the

18-year-old vote, Vietnam and
Cambodia.
Not an Expert
The fifth-ranking Republican
on the House Armed Services
Committee was bombarded with
questions on foreign affairs.
Though professing to be "no
expert" on the subject he went
into some detail explaining his
econometric model for conversion
of a wartime to a peacetime
economy
McLean supporters also pressed
the congressman on his apparent
refusal to debate McLean in
public. The congressman replied,
"I'd clobber him." When pressed
further, Gubser said that he was
very busy and probably could not
fit a debate into his schedule, but
might consider such a meeting if
proper groundrules could be
drawn up. "If I could have, say,
72 hours notice about what

specific bills he wanted to discuss,
I might agree."
Don Ayer, president of the
campus Young Republican
chapter, told the DAILY later
that all but the last details of a
McLean-Gubser forum had been
arranged.
Several questioners asked
Gubser why he did not vote to
limit funds for the controversial
SST (supersonic transport) plane.
Gubser said that he and
Congressman Paul N. "Pete"
McClosky (R-Calif.), to whom
Gubser referred several times
during the afternoon, "walked
down the House aisle past the
teller on that vote together," and
that he did not vote as McLean
supporters claimed.
Lack of Consistency
Gubser also discussed
unemployment in the aerospace
industry in his district, attributing

much of the problem to "the lack
of consistency of policy in the
country on defense matters. In
1 960, John Kennedy won because
he claimed there was a missle gap.
I said there was no gap. Four
weeks later Secretary McNamara
agreed with me that there was no
gap."
Gubser appeared confident of
re-election, claiming that "in
every poll, at worst I am leading
60-40."
After leaving the crowd at
White Plaza, Gubser commented
that questions about specifics of
his record, such as were asked at
the Plaza, were "utterly
ridiculous" and "plain nuts."
Gubser added "When a man has
no record, (McLean) asking details
of an 18 year record is not right."
At one point in the often
pointed discussion, Gubser
cracked, "Well, scholars don't
know everything," to which an
observer replied, "Neither do
Congressmen."
Against 18-year-old Vote
The congressman also said that
he favored student participation
in congressional hearings, but
voted against the eighteen year
old vote, as passed by the House,
because he felt that the proper
way to lower the voting age was
through a Constitutional
amendment rather than a federal
law.
When asked about problems of
State Mental Health Hospitals in
California, Gubser said that he
didn't know much about them,
and that "California is a big state
and it is hard to keep track of all
the problems."
Moving into the area of vote
fraud, Gubser said that while he
agreed that "the 1 967 Vietnamese
elections were not free, neither
were the 1968 elections in
Chicago."
