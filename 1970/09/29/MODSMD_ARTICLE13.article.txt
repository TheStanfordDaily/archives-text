# Mt. View Tenants' Union Hits 'Slumlord' Management
## 
### 
A group of disgruntled Mountain View tenants
reacting to what they term "slumlord" management
conditions have organized to form the Mountain
View Tenants Union.
The tirst target of the three week old group is
Allied Realty, a San Mateo-based company which
owns the 160-unit Park Imperial Apartments in
Mountain View.
The union has been picketing the apartments
evenings and weekends for the past three weeks in
an attempt to force the owners to negotiate a new
lease. Several tenants have also refused to pay rent
and have received eviction notices.
The primary concern of the tenants involved is
that a guarantee that needed repairs will be made be
written into a new lease. Although the management
has promised to make repairs and says that it has
spent $30,000 already, it also forces tenants to sign
a lease which waives section 194 2 of the civil code
which is their only legal recourse if repairs are not
made.
Tenants are also upset about higher rents and
increased security deposits which Allied has
instituted. In addition, they claim that the present

lease was drafted by a layman and is legally
unsound.
In a larger sense, one of the main hopes of the
union is to force a landlord to negotiate directly
with his tenants in establishing a lease.
After one week of picketing Allied agreed to
negotiate and picketing was halted while talks were
held. An oral agreement was reached between the
owner of Allied Realty, William C. Becker, and the
union's lawyer, Robert Charrow. However, before a
new lease was written and signed, Allied withdrew
from the negotiations saying that the tenants'
requests were ambiguous, and "we don't know who
we're negotiating with."
Since then the union has resumed picketing.
According to Charrow, "We are waiting for them to
put in writing what they say orally."
Future plans of the union, according to member
Bob Fletcher, are to continue the picketing, to fight
the evictions, to make necessary repairs themselves
and then deduct the cost from their rent, and if
necessary to take their case to court. The union is
also drafting letters to each of the 36 individual
owners of the complex, stating their grievances.
