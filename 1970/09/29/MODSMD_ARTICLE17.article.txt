# Micronesia Seminar
## 
### 
Stanford's Micronesia Seminar
will offer students an opportunity
to put their academic training to
use by studying and proposing
policies and approaches for
political, social and economic
development in Micronesia.
Micronesia, the U.N. Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands
administered by the U.S., is
rapidly approaching a decision on
her political future but the
alternatives are presently limited
by economic and social
conditions, as well as U.S. policy.
The Micronesia Seminar is an
interdisciplinary effort and will
publish a substantial report,
probably at the end of Winter
Quarter, to be directed to
Micronesian and U.S. leaders.
Approximately 30 students and
faculty from around the Bay Area
will grapple with the varied and
challenging problems faced by
these neglected islands of the
Central Pacific.
The seminar leaders are Prof.
Pan A. Yotopoulos of Stanford's
Food Research Institute; Prof.
Robert S. McKnight of the
Anthropology and Geography
Department at Hayward State
College; Francis Mcßeynolds
Smith, Lecturer in Politics at the

Center for South Pacific Studies,
U.C. Santa Cruz; and Stanford
graduate students Greg Leonard
(Law), Nick Corff (Architecture),
and Dan Smith (Communication).
Because of the interdisciplinary
nature of the Micronesia Seminar,
the size of the group must be
limited so that members can all
interact and produce a coherent
report. Interested students should
meet this week with a seminar
leader to discuss participation. A
group of students with
complementary interests will be
selected and begin weekly
meetings Oct. 6.
