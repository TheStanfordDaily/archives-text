Five Die In Fire
LOS ANGELES — Five fire fighters died Monday evening
when their helicopter crashed over the scene of one of
California's massive brush fires, a U.S. Forest Service
spokesman said.
The five-seat helicopter, used to ferry workers, crashed
in an already blackened area of the Angeles National
Forest, about 30 miles east of Los Angeles. No other
details were available immediately.
They were the first fire fighters to die in the blazes
which have devastated the state's southern half since
Friday. Three civilians died over the weekend.
The state's biggest-ever brush fire crackled unchecked
Monday night near San Diego, but elsewhere winds
subsided and firemen began to gain the upper hand.
Gov. Reagan said state surveys show that since Friday
56 major Southern California fires have charred some
400,000 acres, caused $165 million in damage including
more than 200 homes.
More than 10,00 0 men including 2,500 from out of
state, have manned fire lines, Reagan told a news
conference.
Along virtually the length of California new fires flared
and old ones died. The blazes ranged southward from
Humboldt County near the Oregon border. But the only
really big ones were in the south.
A new blaze broke out 4 0 miles northeast of San Diego
Monday afternoon and quickly burned 32,000 acres in the
timber lush area near Cuyamaca Rancho State Park.
It was reported moving twice as fast as the Mammoth
brush fire to the south.
South of the border, three brush fires threatened the
Mexican community of Fnsenada from different sides.
Two hundred soldiers and volunteers were marshaled to
protect buildings.
Mideast Truce Shaky
MIDEAST ROUNDUP— An Arab peace force moved into
Jordan on Monday to supervise a truce that appeared
shaky at best.
Palestinian guerrilla broadcasts assailed the agreement
worked out hastily in Cairo on Sunday to end the civil war
that swept the desert kingdom for 11 days. This indicated
that some factions of the guerrilla organization were in
disagreement with Yasir Arafat, the moderate guerrilla
chieftain, who signed the agreement along with King
Hussein.
Iraq appeared dissatisfied with the 14-point pact and
Israel called it another setback for the Middle East peace
talks, now stalled in New York.
The Arab peace force of 100 officers from Egypt,
Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Kuwait, arrived in
Amman in two convoys and immediately set up truce
observation posts in the capital. Shooting stopped there at
dawn and inhabitants poured into the streets in desperate
searches for food and water.
Premier Bahi Ladgham of Tunisia also arrived in
Amman to head a truce commission made up of a guerrilla
envoy and a representative of King Hussein. The
commission's task is to implement the 14 points of the
Cairo agreement.
Nixon Meets Pope
ABOARD THE USS SARATOGA - President Nixon new
Monday night from Rome to the aircraft carrier USS
oaratoga in the Mediterranean and told American sailors
that U.S. power and diplomacy had never been more
effective than in the latest Middle East crisis.
Nixon cancelled a firepower demonstration by the U.S.
6th Fleet, however, because of the death of Egypt's
president Gamal Abdel Nasser. A fleet review also was
called off, but the rest of the presidential schedule will
continue as planned, an announcement said.

In Rome, the President had a jubilant, airport meeting
with 31 American hijack hostages who had been pawns in
the Middle East conflict until they were freed by Arab
guerrillas in Amman.
He flew to the U.S. 6th Fleet sailing off Italy's coast
after discussing peace efforts with Italian leaders and Pope
Paul VI.
Before his twilight departure by helicopter from St.
Peter's Square, Nixon received a tumultuous greeting from
Romans shouting "Viva Nixon." Some 2 ,000 persons
swarmed around his limousine during an unscheduled drive
to take Mrs. Nixon to her hotel after meeting with the
Pope at the Vatican. The motorcade stopped several times
and Nixon, smiling broadly, got out to shake hands with
the crowds.
Dos Passos Dead
BALTIMORE, Md. John Dos Passos, whose acclaimed
trilogy "U.S.A." chronicled labor and social struggles of
the early decades of the 2 0 th century, died Monday at the
age of 74.
"U.S.A." was written in a highly distinctive style. It
mixed pure fiction with unusual literary devices, including
subjective capsule biographies of the dominant public
figures of the first third of this century.
In a series of sections called "Newsreels," Dos Passos
presented a verbal collage of the times, using actual
newspaper headlines to play the contemporary news
against his fictional characters.
Once considered a left-wing author, his views changed
as he grew older. Labor leaders, heroes in "U.S.A.", were
villains some three decades later in his 1961 novel
"Midcentury."
Third Fugitive Captured
WORCESTER, Mass. — The third of five persons sought in
a bank holdup and slaying of a policeman was captured at
gunpoint Monday and his hostages freed. Two coeds
remained at large.
Fifty police officers converged on a station wagon at a
rotary in Billings Square, blocked it from escape and
removed William A. Gilday, 41, of Amesbury, sought in
the $26,000 holdup and the slaying of Boston Patrolmen
Walter A. Schroeder, 42. Schroeder, father of nine, was
buried at about the time of the Gilday capture.
The hostages he had held nearly 24 hours, Thomas
Huberdeau, 24, and his sister, Katherine, 20, both of
Haverhill, were unharmed.
Still sought in the slaying, which Boston police have
linked to a student radical group and to the earlier
bombing and looting of a National Guard armory are two
coeds, Susan Saxe, 20, of Albany, N.Y., and Katherine A.
Power, 20 , of Denver, Colo.
Boston Police Commissioner Edmund L. McNamara
said ammunition and military supplies found in a Boston
apartment rented by Miss Power showed "a positive link"
with "radical revolutionary groups."
Hendrix Suffocated
LONDON — Jimi Hendrix, the American guitarist and pop
singer who pioneered in electronic innovations, died of
suffocation, a pathologist told a coroner's court Monday.
The coroner, ruling there wasn't enough evident to
justify a verdict of suicide, returned an open verdict. This
meant the coroner could not decide why the 27-year old
pop star died.
Pathologist Donald Teare testified that Hendrix died
from choking on the vomit of barbiturate poisoning Sept.
18.
Hendrix' girl friend, German ice skater Monika
Danneman, 23, told the court that nine of her sleeping
tablets were missing.
"The question why he took so many sleeping tablets
cannot be safely answered," said Coroner Gavin Thurston.
