# Tenants Union Erects Tent City
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Tenants Union met
jointly with the Radical Caucus,
offspring of the Off ROTC Movement,
last night as part of a week-long
schedule of events called "tent city at
Stanford." The purpose of the forum is
to dramatize the group's opposition to
University low cost housing
construction policies.
The tent city itself was set up
yesterday morning in the grove east of
Memorial Auditorium. So far three
tents have been erected, two small ones
and a large 30-person capacity tent.
At the PATU meeting, an audience
of about 2 00 heard Kenny Horston,
chairman of the Black Panther Caucus,
United Auto Workers; Aaron
Manganiello, Chicano leader from
Venceremos College; Janet Weiss
speaking on revolution; Jean Hobson
explaining the housing situation; and Jim
Shoch demonstrating cost-benefit
analysis.
Union member Don Lee announced
that the tent city would continue
throughout the week although they had
already been contacted by the Stanford

Police, administration, and fire
officials, all asking the group to leave.
About half an hour after the tents
were set up yesterday Chief Thomas
Bell of the Stanford Police read the
group a University statement which
said they were tresspassing. The union
refused to leave claiming that at least
some of them were students and had a
right to remain.
Later Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig appeared and asked the
students to leave apparently trying to
apply a new tresspassing law. The
students again refused to leave and said

they would meet with Rosenzweig in
the afternoon.
Throughout the day union members
passed out leaflets advertising their
weeklong events designed to publicize
the low-income housing problem.
During the afternoon a Stanford
Fire Department official told the group
they would have to have their large
tent, which covered more than 100
square feet, fireproofed or else remove
it.
The final decision of University
officials apparently was that if the tents
continue only as a demonstration, and
meet fire regulations, they can remain.


TENT DRAMATIZES HOUSING PLlGHTâ€”Members of the Palo Alto Tenants Union set up several tents yesterday afternoon
next to Memorial Auditorium to dramatize the local housing shortage. The tents will be up again today, as the Tenants's
Union continues its effort to enlist more student support.
