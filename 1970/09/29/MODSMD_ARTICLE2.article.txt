# Egyptian President Nasser Dies; Effect On Mid-East Crisis Unclear

From the Associated Press
CAIRO, Sept. 29 â€” Gamal Abdel
Nasser, the 5 2-year old president of
Egypt, died of a heart attack here last
night, adding one more uncertainty to
an already unstable situation in the
Middle East.
A postal worker's son, Nasser
entered the army, led a campaign that
overturned a corrupt Egyptian
monarchy, and became one of the
leading spokesmen of the Arab world.
He was popularly regarded as a hero in
the often-violent Arab world despite his
stunning setbacks at the hands of
Israel's military establishment.
Nasser died of a "massive heart
attack" as he and other Arab leaders
were striving to deal with the backlash
created by the Jordanian civil war.
Cairo radio announced that Anwar
Sadat, Nasser's vice president, was
assuming the presidency. The
automatic, constitutional move was
described after a meeting of the Arab

Socialist Union and Nasser's cabinet.
Under the terms of the constitution,
Sadat will remain president for 6 0 days.
As the announcement of Nasser's
death was made public, radio stations
began continuous readings of the
Koran, shops closed, and streets were
generally deserted. No violence was
reported in Cairo, although some
shooting broke out in Beirut between
pro- and anti-Nasser forces.
'Tragic Loss'
President Nixon, on a European trip,
canceled a Sixth Fleet firepower
exercise scheduled Tuesday in the
Mediterranean. He termed Nasser's
death a "tragic loss."
This loss, the President said,
"requires that all nations, and
especially those in the Middle East,
renew their efforts to calm passions,
reach for mutual understanding, and
build a lasting peace."
Tass, the official Soviet news
agency, made only a brief

announcement of Nasser's death.
Premier Alexei Kosygin will attend the
funeral services scheduled for later this
week. Russia had been a strong
supporter of the Nasser regime,
supplying him with armaments and
building the Aswan Dam.
Several diplomats in Beirut
expressed belief that Nasser's death
could have a sobering effect on the
warring sides in Jordan. However, one
possibility that they also foresaw was
that new passions might be unleashed
against Western establishments pictured
in Arab minds as enemies of Nasser.
Moderation
American oil and oil-production
investments in the Mideast are
calculated in billions of dollars.
They declined to make further
predictions about the future of
American influence in the area.
President Sadat's political outlook
was difficult to determine immediately.
Some diplomats believe that he may be

less inclined towards the policies of
moderation that Nasser had advocated
during recent months. Nasser, who was
once a leading exponent of driving the
Israelis into the sea, had become
increasingly moderate in the wake of
continued guerilla warfare in the area
and had supported the concept that
negotiations on the crisis at large might
be possible.
At summit meetings last week, Arab
leaders hastily worked out an
agreement intended to end the
Jordanian violence while leaving
unresolved the basic conflict between
the Jordanian army and the Palestinian
guerillas. The power of the truce
agreement may now diminish.
Nasser's death was also considered a
blow to those who placed hopes in the
current cease-fire arrangements and the
American cease-fire peace plan. Nasser
seemed to be the only leader strong
enough to convince militant Arab
leaders that negotiations would be
advisible.
