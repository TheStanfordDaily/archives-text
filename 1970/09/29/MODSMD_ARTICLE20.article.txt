### 
Tuition will be raised again next
year, by over $200.
As authorized by the Board of
Trustees in their September meeting,
tuition for the 1971 -72 academic year
(three quarters) will be $2610, an
increase of $210 over the current rate.
In making the announcement, the
trustees said that prior to the new
increase Stanford tuition was still lower

than that of comparable Ivy League
universities and they art' expected to
increase their tuition.
In 1 967 the trustees authorized
annual increases in the tuition rate. At
that time the tuition rate was $1575 .
The room and board rate was also
increased this academic year and there
is a possibility it will be raised again
next year.
