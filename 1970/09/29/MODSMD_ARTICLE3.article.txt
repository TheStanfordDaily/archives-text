# 200 Units Planned
## Low Cost Housing To Be Built 
### 
Stanford Trustees have designated
the Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition as
sponsor and developer for
approximately 200 units of low and
moderate income housing to be located
on Stanford land.
The project is the first response of
the trustees to last year's
recommendations of the Wright
Committee report on the University's
housing responsibilities. The
development is planned for an 1 8 acre
site across Peter Coutts Road from the
faculty housing on Frenchman's Hill.
The Coalition was selected after the
University had interviewed some 4 0 to
5 0 local and national private

developers, non-profit corporations,
and co-operatives.
Fit Criteria
According to Real Estate Manager,
Boyd Smith, the Coalition most nearly
fit the criteria of the selection
committee. These criteria included:
"1. Commitment to quality
management with emphasis on

long-term stability.
"2. Proven capability of designing
and developing a large apartment
project which will be an asset to
tenants and the community and which
will meet the FHA 236 cost criteria.
"3. Willingness to cooperate with
campus homeowners. University
committees, and prospective tenants
during the planning stage.
"4. Acceptability within the campus
community and the surrounding areas."
In a letter to President Richard
Lyman Coalition Executive Director Ira
Hall made recommendations very
similar to the Wright Committee report.
Among these were plans for "a
predominately family project, with
some one bedroom and efficiency units
for couples and individuals.
Playgrounds Provided
Playgrounds and common green
areas would be provided, plus two
community buildings for day care,
cooperative nursery or such other use
as seemed most relevant to the needs of
the residents."
Hall also said the Coalition would
"seek to achieve the racial balance
objective of black and Chicano
suggested by the Wright Committee,
spacing the minority families around
the project to avoid concentrations.
Middle-income and low-income
households woujd also be distributed
throughout the project."
The Coalition hopes to involve local
residents, the University, and possible
future tenants in the planning and
building stage. The design will be

subject to University approval on site
plan, elevations, landscaping, and
several other factors.
Chronicle Praise
In an editorial earlier this month the
San Francisco Chronicle lauded
Stanford for taking "a significant step
toward developing a small parcel of its
land for the housing of low and
moderate income families, whether or
not they are connected with the
university."
Lyman calls the project, "a brand
new" approach to the solution of
low-income housing. Jing Lyman, wife
of President Lyman and a member of
the Coalition's Fair Housing Task
Force, said, "My fond expectation and
hope is that this is the beginning of
something greater not only on Stanford
lands, but throughout the
mid-peninsula."
However, reaction to the project has
not been entirely favorable. According
to Don Lee, a member of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union, the project is "a token
response to the housing shortage and
fits the description of what the Wright
Committee called hypocrisy. 1 just
don't see a sincere commitment."
Committee Recommendations
The Wright Committee
recommended (hat the University
"adopt plans for phased development
of (>()() to 2000 low-and
moderate-income units." The report
also said, "The Committee believes that
alternative A (that the University
sponsor a single trial development of

limited size, with no further
commitment at this time) would
suggest a kind of tokenism that might
expose the University to the charge of
hypocrisy; it would seem to indicate no
serious intention to help solve a major
problem which the University has
helped to create."
According to Hall, who in addition
to his position in the Coalition is a
newly elected member of the Board of
Trustees, "In terms of the demand I
think the universities response should
be much more than 200 units.
However, I think they will have to get
their feet wet before jumping in. I agree
with the recommendations of the
Wright Committee, and 1 don't really
know how this number of 200 came
about. I feel the University has to
continue to develop land — it has no
other choice. The Coalition has found
the Peninsula housing needs to be
80,000 units over the next 20 years,
not counting San Francisco or San
Jose."
Smith maintains that the 200 figure
is just an approximate estimate of the
number of units which may be built on
the 18 acre area. He says, "At present
this land is really the only available
sight which is feasible when you
consider schools and utilities."
According to Mrs. Lyman, "It is a
very important first step, and you
could do a great deal of harm by
pushing too hard. Precipitant action
could turn against constructive
solution. This commitment is a
significant opener to a problem of
absolutely monumental proportions.
You must see this in the context of the
first stage. There are a great many
facets to the problem, which the
average person coming in with a great
deal of good will just doesn't
understand."

predominately family project, with
some one bedroom and efficiency units
for couples and individuals.
Playgrounds Provided
Playgrounds and common green
areas would be provided, plus two
community buildings for day care,
cooperative nursery or such other use
as seemed most relevant to the needs of
the residents."
Hall also said the Coalition would
"seek to achieve the racial balance
objective of black and Chicano
suggested by the Wright Committee,
spacing the minority families around
the project to avoid concentrations.
Middle-income and low-income
households woujd also be distributed
throughout the project."
The Coalition hopes to involve local
residents, the University, and possible
future tenants in the planning and
building stage. The design will be

subject to University approval on site
plan, elevations, landscaping, and
several other factors.
Chronicle Praise
In an editorial earlier this month the
San Francisco Chronicle lauded
Stanford for taking "a significant step
toward developing a small parcel of its
land for the housing of low and
moderate income families, whether or
not they are connected with the
university."
Lyman calls the project, "a brand
new" approach to the solution of
low-income housing. Jing Lyman, wife
of President Lyman and a member of
the Coalition's Fair Housing Task
Force, said, "My fond expectation and
hope is that this is the beginning of
something greater not only on Stanford
lands, but throughout the
mid-peninsula."
However, reaction to the project has
not been entirely favorable. According
to Don Lee, a member of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union, the project is "a token
response to the housing shortage and
fits the description of what the Wright
Committee called hypocrisy. 1 just
don't see a sincere commitment."
Committee Recommendations
The Wright Committee
recommended (hat the University
"adopt plans for phased development
of (>()() to 2000 low-and
moderate-income units." The report
also said, "The Committee believes that
alternative A (that the University
sponsor a single trial development of

limited size, with no further
commitment at this time) would
suggest a kind of tokenism that might
expose the University to the charge of
hypocrisy; it would seem to indicate no
serious intention to help solve a major
problem which the University has
helped to create."
According to Hall, who in addition
to his position in the Coalition is a
newly elected member of the Board of
Trustees, "In terms of the demand I
think the universities response should
be much more than 200 units.
However, I think they will have to get
their feet wet before jumping in. I agree
with the recommendations of the
Wright Committee, and 1 don't really
know how this number of 200 came
about. I feel the University has to
continue to develop land — it has no
other choice. The Coalition has found
the Peninsula housing needs to be
80,000 units over the next 20 years,
not counting San Francisco or San
Jose."
Smith maintains that the 200 figure
is just an approximate estimate of the
number of units which may be built on
the 18 acre area. He says, "At present
this land is really the only available
sight which is feasible when you
consider schools and utilities."
According to Mrs. Lyman, "It is a
very important first step, and you
could do a great deal of harm by
pushing too hard. Precipitant action
could turn against constructive
solution. This commitment is a
significant opener to a problem of
absolutely monumental proportions.
You must see this in the context of the
first stage. There are a great many
facets to the problem, which the
average person coming in with a great
deal of good will just doesn't
understand."
Stanford Trustees have designated
the Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition as
sponsor and developer for
approximately 200 units of low and
moderate income housing to be located
on Stanford land.
The project is the first response of
the trustees to last year's
recommendations of the Wright
Committee report on the University's
housing responsibilities. The
development is planned for an 1 8 acre
site across Peter Coutts Road from the
faculty housing on Frenchman's Hill.
The Coalition was selected after the
University had interviewed some 4 0 to
5 0 local and national private

developers, non-profit corporations,
and co-operatives.
Fit Criteria
According to Real Estate Manager,
Boyd Smith, the Coalition most nearly
fit the criteria of the selection
committee. These criteria included:
"1. Commitment to quality
management with emphasis on

long-term stability.
"2. Proven capability of designing
and developing a large apartment
project which will be an asset to
tenants and the community and which
will meet the FHA 236 cost criteria.
"3. Willingness to cooperate with
campus homeowners. University
committees, and prospective tenants
during the planning stage.
"4. Acceptability within the campus
community and the surrounding areas."

Lyman Coalition Executive Director Ira

However, reaction to the project has
not been entirely favorable. According
to Don Lee, a member of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union, the project is "a token
response to the housing shortage and
fits the description of what the Wright
Committee called hypocrisy. 1 just
don't see a sincere commitment."
Committee Recommendations
The Wright Committee
recommended (hat the University
"adopt plans for phased development
of (>()() to 2000 low-and
moderate-income units." The report
also said, "The Committee believes that
alternative A (that the University
sponsor a single trial development of

limited size, with no further
commitment at this time) would
suggest a kind of tokenism that might
expose the University to the charge of
hypocrisy; it would seem to indicate no
serious intention to help solve a major
problem which the University has
helped to create."
According to Hall, who in addition
to his position in the Coalition is a
newly elected member of the Board of
Trustees, "In terms of the demand I
think the universities response should
be much more than 200 units.
However, I think they will have to get
their feet wet before jumping in. I agree
with the recommendations of the
Wright Committee, and 1 don't really
know how this number of 200 came
about. I feel the University has to
continue to develop land — it has no
other choice. The Coalition has found
the Peninsula housing needs to be
80,000 units over the next 20 years,
not counting San Francisco or San
Jose."
Smith maintains that the 200 figure
is just an approximate estimate of the
number of units which may be built on
the 18 acre area. He says, "At present
this land is really the only available
sight which is feasible when you
consider schools and utilities."
According to Mrs. Lyman, "It is a
very important first step, and you
could do a great deal of harm by
pushing too hard. Precipitant action
could turn against constructive
solution. This commitment is a
significant opener to a problem of
absolutely monumental proportions.
You must see this in the context of the
first stage. There are a great many
facets to the problem, which the
average person coming in with a great
deal of good will just doesn't
understand."
