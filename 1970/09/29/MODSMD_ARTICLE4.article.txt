The other major change we Ve made is typographical. The letters
you 're reading are larger than before. That makes them easier to read,

At the same time that we announce these changes, we ask old Daily
staffers to come by the office today to pick up new, exciting
assignments. Those wishing to begin working on the midpeninsula's
