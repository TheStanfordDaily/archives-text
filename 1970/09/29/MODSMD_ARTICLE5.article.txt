tions Office.
Following are excerpts from
remarks prepared for delivery by
President Richard W. Lyman at
Freshman Convocation Sept. 25,
1970.
You enter college at a time
when there is less certainty about
what higher education means or
ought to mean than ever in living
memory. There are more doubts
in the minds of students as to
their own purposes, as well as
those of the institutions they
attend, than ever.
And, as usual when everyone is
uncertain, everyone shouts louder.
The poet, Karl Shapiro, no doubt
exaggerated when he said earlier
this year: "It appears that the
modern student enters the
university with a contempt for the
university, a contempt for society,
a contempt for literature, and a
contempt for himself."
But so, surely, are those
middle-aged idolators of youth
exaggerating, who picture the
college student of today as the
first human being ever to
recognize the possibility of
leading a virtuous life, and to act
on the basis of that discovery. We
are, almost all of us, a lot less sure
of ourselves, a lot less confident

that we have the world figured
out, than we allow ourselves to
appear. That, at any rate, ought to
be a common bond, and a source
of comfort to you as you try to
mak<* sense of the university, and
your place in it . . .
Clearly, politics and its relation
to the University is a hot topic.
That might be reason enough to
discuss it, but there are further
reasons as well. It raises questions
that have to be faced now, they
cannot be put off. And they are
questions that cannot really be
fudged. So we may as well try to
understand one another about
them.
In a statement issued this past
summer I tried to make clear

distinction between political
activity on the part of individuals
or groups of individuals at
Stanford on the one hand, and, on
the other, political activity that
makes use of the University's
resources—whether telephones,
Xerox machines, or rent-free
office space—or conveys a clear
connotation of official University
involvement, such as writing
"Why 1 love Governor Jess
Reagan" letters on Stanford
letterhead. Like many statements
of policy, it represents an attempt
to resolve a dilemma.
One horn of this dilemma is
this: many of us believe that if the
United States is to survive—if we
are to survive as human beings on
this planet—the quality of
American political life must
improve, drastically and quickly.

By this I mean several things,
among them the following:
Attention to major issues of
survival must increase, and
preoccupation with trivial issues
decrease; ways of seeking and
achieving change through the
political system must be opened
up and clarified, so that they
really do exist and people can see
that they exist; the general level
of involvement in politics on the
part of millions of people who are
not professional politicians must
rise dramatically, and stay risen.
It's not enough to get excited
when the headlines of some fresh
disaster stir one's metabolism; the
involvement has to be steady and
unremitting, patient but
relentless.

The terrible grip of private
selfishness, not just on the part of
major corporations but among
everyday tax-paying (or
tax-resisting) citizens, must give
way to a sharply increased
readiness to see money change
hands and power relationships
alter so that urgent public
questions, such as racial equality
and environmental protection, can
be dealt with.
All this and much more must
happen. To say that it must
happen is not to denigrate all
previous generations of
Americans, nor all present
politicians; it is merely to say that
the problems that must be
resolved politically today are
unprecedentedly serious and
difficult, and therefore are not
likely to yield to further doses of
the mixture-as-before.
Clearly college students and
other university people must help
to accomplish the needed changes.
If they don't, no one else
will—not because they are
uniquely virtuous—but simply
because university people ought
to be among the people most
sensitive to the tragic condition of
the world today, and best able, by
reason of their abilities and their
opportunities, to do something
about it.

All of that is on one horn of
the dilemma. On the other is the
very real question of protecting
the University itself against
becoming thoroughly politicized
and therefore no longer free.
The unwillingness of so many
even to consider that this is a real
question, a serious danger that we
face, is to me truly frightening.
Such unwillingness stems, no
doubt, from the desperate feeling
enunciated by the student whose
letter I've quoted: a fear of
repression, plus a conviction that
(as one student put it) "We are
running out of institutions that
will question our society just
when those challenges are badly
needed."
1 understand the fear and the
desperation, but to move from
these to a belief that human and
political survival will best be
served by turning the University
into a political instrument is, 1 am
deeply convinced, to confuse the
disease with its cure. It is like
many other panic reactions: those
in fear do just that thing which
will most certainly bring about
the fate they fear most.
Let me explain. Universities are
indeed, and to a unique degree,
the "institutions that will
question our society." Or any
other society, for that matter. The
mere continuing existence of a
real university serves to question
society. More than ever
before—because they occupy a
bigger share of the intellectual
terrain, so to speak—universities
are the prime centers of criticism.
Even the arts, which at their
best are among the most effective
critics of any society, are more
dependent upon the freedom and
support they find on a university
campus than in the past. You
would not have found very many
novelists, poets, sculptors,
playwrights, etc. in residence in
the universities of the earlier 2 0 th
Century. The very notion would
have seemed strange and exotic to
those much more limited and
parochial institutions.
But how long would such
freedom last, once it became clear
that universities were available
instruments for the promotion of
a particular brand of politics or
candidates? Why on earth should
we expect that a society full of
powerful and wealthy interest
groups will be willing to watch
without doing anything about it
while the diversity and openness
of the universities are abandoned
in favor of institutional
commitment and the production
"| of political propaganda?

Let me be specific. If the
universities allow themselves to be
captured by their politically most
active members, and used to
promote political purposes, one of
two things will quickly
happen—and probably both. One:
using the law already on the
books governing corporations
organized for educational
purposes, those who did not like
this turn of events would go to
court to get the universities' tax
exemption removed.
We could not survive at all, in
these days of massive deficits,
without tax exemption—both on
our own educational activities and
on the gifts people give us.
Perhaps the courts would save us.
But the law is pretty plain-spoken.
It defines a tax-exempt
educational corporation as, inter
alia, an institution "no substantial
part of the activities of which is
carrying on propaganda, or
otherwise attempting, to influence
legislation, and which does not
participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or
distributing of statements), any
political campaign on behalf of
any candidate for public office."
Second, and perhaps
simultaneously, efforts would be
made to enlist universities on the
side of political interests very

different from the political
interests that are most active and
prominent on the campus today.
There is nothing in the law of
nature that says a politicized
university must always be
politicized in favor of peace,
freedom, and equality. In a
contest for control of the
universities in which no holds are
barred—i.e., a contest that takes
place after we've abandoned the
whole idea of being a refuge for
all points of view, however
unpopular or even distasteful, and
have launched ourselves instead as
political institutions—who would
predict that the forces of
enlightenment and unselfishness
would prevail? As that veteran
socialist, Carl Landauer, said
recently, "The University cannot
at the same time be a forum for
the combat of ideas and a party in
that combat . . . Once the rule of
institutional neutrality was
abrogated, the political Right
would be more effective than the
Left in using the universities for
its own purposes."
Does this mean that the
University should resist all contact
with politics, except perhaps to
offer genteel seminars in "A
Theory of the Calculus of Voting"
or "The Transmission of Political
Values from Parent to Child." 1
believe not.
Of course the University's first
duty in relation to politics, as in
relation to anything else, is to
learn and teach more about the
subject. That learning, that
teaching, can and should take
place in a wide variety of ways
and at a number of different
levels.

There is no reason why
learning and teaching about
practical politics, or about acutely
contemporary problems of
political action, should not take
place in the University, provided
only that the game is played with
non-loaded dice. And students
who are serious about having an
impact upon the direction of
national policy had better be
serious about doing their
homework in advance.
How many students are serious
about having that impact?
There's no doubt that some
care profoundly, and spend their
energies without stint. But the
available evidence so far doesn't
suggest that these are very
numerous.
Last Spring, there was in the
county next-door to us a
Congressional primary contest
that appeared to have just about
every conceivable attraction for
large numbers of students, given
the circumstances of that
moment. The incumbent was
perhaps the leading "dove" in the
House of Representatives. It was
widely believed that if this
Congressman could survive the
Republican primary, where he was
opposed by a candidate of sharply
opposing views who was thought
to have much greater appeal to

party loyalists, vict y in the
November election was
overwhelmingly likely.
(
So the primary was important, <
the candidate was attractive to all <
but the most radical and most I
conservative students, and student <
help in the campaign was warmly -
welcomed. The Congressman won, >
and students, working on their I
own time and with no University 1
endorsement, helped significantly I
in achieving his victory. But the i
total number of Stanford students I
involved even to the extent of a |
single adventure in
precinct-walking was about 350, |
or three percent of the student 1
body. And only about 1 00 , or less <
than one percent, worked on any i
kind of sustained or continuous i
basis in that primary campaign. I
Much the same thing appears if '
you look at the situation 1
nationally. It may well be true '
that half the population of this j
country is now 25 years old or
less. But the median voting '
age—the average age of those who
actually get themselves to the
polls and pull the lever or mark
their "X' is 4 7 .
Furthermore, the indications
are—and long have been—clear
that younger people are less likely :
to vote than older people. In .
1968, the percentage of the
eligible population that voted was
only 33 percent for ages 18 to 20
(that is, where the voting age was
below 21, only 1 /3 of the
under-21 -year-olds took advantage
of the opportunity). It was 51
percent for those aged 21-24, as
against 7 2 percent for the great
armies of the middle-aged, those
aged 30 to 64. Even among
eligible voters over 64, which
would be bound to include
substantial numbers for whom
going to vote would be quite a
chore, (he percentage was just
twice as good as for the
under-21 's.
Obviously there are lots of
things one would wish to know
before making too much out of
such facts and figures. But even at
first glance they suggest that, for
whatever reasons, your own age
group doesn't for the most part
even seize the threshold
opportunity for political
involvement—the right to work
and vote in elections.
You are accustomed to
challenging the institutions of our
society, mostly run by your
elders, to commit themselves to
change. I'd like, with all due
respect to the amount that young
people have accomplished in
American politics, from
Alexander Hamilton to Julian
Bond, to challenge you to make

the youth movement in
American political life something
more durable, more constructive
and more significant than the
headline-hunting antics of
Weathermen and Yippies.
Some will tell you that this
would be a waste of time, that the
system won't respond—perhaps
even that it is now so moribund
thai it can't respond. But as
Henry Fairlie once wrote: "The
worst and best thing about
politicians is that they are
representative of the people who
elect them."
The fact today is that the
system is responding, but the
people to whom it is responding
are not for the most part those
who want withdrawal from
Vietnam now, an environmental
cleanup now, and greater
attention to the problems of
poverty now; it is responding to
the great and growing number
who are demanding law and order,
fewer constraints upon the police,
and a crackdown on youthful
protest the moment it departs
from strictest standards of
decorum.
It may just be that you have
entered the University at a
moment in history when, on top
of everything else, its body is
being fought over and its soul
imperilled. If, in the agony of our
time, freedom and diversity on
the campus are thought to be
luxiries we can no longer afford,
there will soon be no universities
worthy of the name. If the
political voice of youth is to be
the voice of the Wisconsin
bombers, nihilism and despair will
be the only winners. If every
attempt, no matter how careful,
to stem the tide of violence and
hatred here at home is met by
cries of "Repression!," or by
indifference born of disgust at the
violence abroad, we shall deserve
our grim fate—and we'll carry
along with us millions of people
elsewhere in the world who don't
deserve it. There's something
particularly contemptible about
academic apologists for violence.
As an English commentator
remarked several years ago, "Calls
for more excitement, unreason,
violence and danger naturally tend
to come from people who live
relatively sheltered lives, measured
by examinations and
promotions."
You came here for many
purposes, in many moods and
with diverse expectations. Some
of you will feel almost
immediately that these are,
indeed, the best years of your
lives, despite our troubles; some
others of you will find little or
nothing to your liking here. Most
of you will probably find
yourselves somewhere in between,
baffled at times by complexity
and rapid change and strident
challenges on all sides, but
fulfilled at times by the sheer
excitement of learning how to
learn, and how to act on the basis
of learning.
For all but a few of you,
politics, even in the broadest
sense, will be only a part of life
and learning. I've taken the risk of
distorting your initial picture of
Stanford bv limiting myself to
this subject, and also by telling
you several things you may not
very much wish to hear. You have
a right to be told things you do
not wish to hear, and beware of
anyone who speaks only to truths
you already know, or prejudices
you already share. I've no doubt
that you'll do your share of
talking back; and that, also, is as
should be.

Your own age group doesn't for-the most pert even seize
the threshold opportunity for political involvement-the
right to work and vote in elections.
I'd like to challenge you to make of the youth
movement in American political life something more
durable, more constructive and more significant than
the headline-hunting antics of the Weathermen and
Yippies.

If, in the agony of our time, freedom and diversity on
campus are thought to be luxuries we can no longer
afford, there will soon be no universities worthy of the
name. If the political voice of youth is to be the voice of
the Wisconsin bombers, nihilism and despair will be the
only winners.

You came here for many
purposes, in many moods and
with diverse expectations. Some
of you will feel almost
immediately that these are,
indeed, the best years of your
lives, despite our troubles; some
others of you will find little or
nothing to your liking here. Most
of you will probably find
yourselves somewhere in between,
baffled at times by complexity
and rapid change and strident
challenges on all sides, but
fulfilled at times by the sheer
excitement of learning how to
learn, and how to act on the basis
of learning.
For all but a few of you,
politics, even in the broadest
sense, will be only a part of life
and learning. I've taken the risk of
distorting your initial picture of
Stanford bv limiting myself to
this subject, and also by telling
you several things you may not
very much wish to hear. You have
a right to be told things you do
not wish to hear, and beware of
anyone who speaks only to truths
you already know, or prejudices
you already share. I've no doubt
that you'll do your share of
talking back; and that, also, is as
should be.

Your own age group doesn't for-the most pert even seize
the threshold opportunity for political involvement-the
right to work and vote in elections.
I'd like to challenge you to make of the youth
movement in American political life something more
durable, more constructive and more significant than
the headline-hunting antics of the Weathermen and
Yippies.

If, in the agony of our time, freedom and diversity on
campus are thought to be luxuries we can no longer
afford, there will soon be no universities worthy of the
name. If the political voice of youth is to be the voice of
the Wisconsin bombers, nihilism and despair will be the
only winners.

Following are excerpts from
remarks prepared for delivery by
President Richard W. Lyman at
Freshman Convocation Sept. 25,
1970.
You enter college at a time
when there is less certainty about
what higher education means or
ought to mean than ever in living
memory. There are more doubts
in the minds of students as to
their own purposes, as well as
those of the institutions they
attend, than ever.
And, as usual when everyone is
uncertain, everyone shouts louder.
The poet, Karl Shapiro, no doubt
exaggerated when he said earlier
this year: "It appears that the
modern student enters the
university with a contempt for the
university, a contempt for society,
a contempt for literature, and a
contempt for himself."
But so, surely, are those
middle-aged idolators of youth
exaggerating, who picture the
college student of today as the
first human being ever to
recognize the possibility of
leading a virtuous life, and to act
on the basis of that discovery. We
are, almost all of us, a lot less sure
of ourselves, a lot less confident

that we have the world figured
out, than we allow ourselves to
appear. That, at any rate, ought to
be a common bond, and a source
of comfort to you as you try to
mak<* sense of the university, and
your place in it . . .
Clearly, politics and its relation
to the University is a hot topic.
That might be reason enough to
discuss it, but there are further
reasons as well. It raises questions
that have to be faced now, they
cannot be put off. And they are
questions that cannot really be
fudged. So we may as well try to
understand one another about
them.
In a statement issued this past
summer I tried to make clear

distinction between political
activity on the part of individuals
or groups of individuals at
Stanford on the one hand, and, on
the other, political activity that
makes use of the University's
resources—whether telephones,
Xerox machines, or rent-free
office space—or conveys a clear
connotation of official University
involvement, such as writing
"Why 1 love Governor Jess
Reagan" letters on Stanford
letterhead. Like many statements
of policy, it represents an attempt
to resolve a dilemma.
One horn of this dilemma is
this: many of us believe that if the
United States is to survive—if we
are to survive as human beings on
this planet—the quality of
American political life must
improve, drastically and quickly.

By this I mean several things,
among them the following:
Attention to major issues of
survival must increase, and
preoccupation with trivial issues
decrease; ways of seeking and
achieving change through the
political system must be opened
up and clarified, so that they
really do exist and people can see
that they exist; the general level
of involvement in politics on the
part of millions of people who are
not professional politicians must
rise dramatically, and stay risen.
It's not enough to get excited
when the headlines of some fresh
disaster stir one's metabolism; the
involvement has to be steady and
unremitting, patient but
relentless.

The terrible grip of private
selfishness, not just on the part of
major corporations but among
everyday tax-paying (or
tax-resisting) citizens, must give
way to a sharply increased
readiness to see money change
hands and power relationships
alter so that urgent public
questions, such as racial equality
and environmental protection, can
be dealt with.
All this and much more must
happen. To say that it must
happen is not to denigrate all
previous generations of
Americans, nor all present
politicians; it is merely to say that
the problems that must be
resolved politically today are
unprecedentedly serious and
difficult, and therefore are not
likely to yield to further doses of
the mixture-as-before.
Clearly college students and
other university people must help
to accomplish the needed changes.
If they don't, no one else
will—not because they are
uniquely virtuous—but simply
because university people ought
to be among the people most
sensitive to the tragic condition of
the world today, and best able, by
reason of their abilities and their
opportunities, to do something
about it.

All of that is on one horn of
the dilemma. On the other is the
very real question of protecting
the University itself against
becoming thoroughly politicized
and therefore no longer free.
The unwillingness of so many
even to consider that this is a real
question, a serious danger that we
face, is to me truly frightening.
Such unwillingness stems, no
doubt, from the desperate feeling
enunciated by the student whose
letter I've quoted: a fear of
repression, plus a conviction that
(as one student put it) "We are
running out of institutions that
will question our society just
when those challenges are badly
needed."
1 understand the fear and the
desperation, but to move from
these to a belief that human and
political survival will best be
served by turning the University
into a political instrument is, 1 am
deeply convinced, to confuse the
disease with its cure. It is like
many other panic reactions: those
in fear do just that thing which
will most certainly bring about
the fate they fear most.
Let me explain. Universities are
indeed, and to a unique degree,
the "institutions that will
question our society." Or any
other society, for that matter. The
mere continuing existence of a
real university serves to question
society. More than ever
before—because they occupy a
bigger share of the intellectual
terrain, so to speak—universities
are the prime centers of criticism.
Even the arts, which at their
best are among the most effective
critics of any society, are more
dependent upon the freedom and
support they find on a university
campus than in the past. You
would not have found very many
novelists, poets, sculptors,
playwrights, etc. in residence in
the universities of the earlier 2 0 th
Century. The very notion would
have seemed strange and exotic to
those much more limited and
parochial institutions.
But how long would such
freedom last, once it became clear
that universities were available
instruments for the promotion of
a particular brand of politics or
candidates? Why on earth should
we expect that a society full of
powerful and wealthy interest
groups will be willing to watch
without doing anything about it
while the diversity and openness
of the universities are abandoned
in favor of institutional
commitment and the production
"| of political propaganda?

Let me be specific. If the
universities allow themselves to be
captured by their politically most
active members, and used to
promote political purposes, one of
two things will quickly
happen—and probably both. One:
using the law already on the
books governing corporations
organized for educational
purposes, those who did not like
this turn of events would go to
court to get the universities' tax
exemption removed.
We could not survive at all, in
these days of massive deficits,
without tax exemption—both on
our own educational activities and
on the gifts people give us.
Perhaps the courts would save us.
But the law is pretty plain-spoken.
It defines a tax-exempt
educational corporation as, inter
alia, an institution "no substantial
part of the activities of which is
carrying on propaganda, or
otherwise attempting, to influence
legislation, and which does not
participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or
distributing of statements), any
political campaign on behalf of
any candidate for public office."
Second, and perhaps
simultaneously, efforts would be
made to enlist universities on the
side of political interests very

different from the political
interests that are most active and
prominent on the campus today.
There is nothing in the law of
nature that says a politicized
university must always be
politicized in favor of peace,
freedom, and equality. In a
contest for control of the
universities in which no holds are
barred—i.e., a contest that takes
place after we've abandoned the
whole idea of being a refuge for
all points of view, however
unpopular or even distasteful, and
have launched ourselves instead as
political institutions—who would
predict that the forces of
enlightenment and unselfishness
would prevail? As that veteran
socialist, Carl Landauer, said
recently, "The University cannot
at the same time be a forum for
the combat of ideas and a party in
that combat . . . Once the rule of
institutional neutrality was
abrogated, the political Right
would be more effective than the
Left in using the universities for
its own purposes."
Does this mean that the
University should resist all contact
with politics, except perhaps to
offer genteel seminars in "A
Theory of the Calculus of Voting"
or "The Transmission of Political
Values from Parent to Child." 1
believe not.
Of course the University's first
duty in relation to politics, as in
relation to anything else, is to
learn and teach more about the
subject. That learning, that
teaching, can and should take
place in a wide variety of ways
and at a number of different
levels.

There is no reason why
learning and teaching about
practical politics, or about acutely
contemporary problems of
political action, should not take
place in the University, provided
only that the game is played with
non-loaded dice. And students
who are serious about having an
impact upon the direction of
national policy had better be
serious about doing their
homework in advance.
How many students are serious
about having that impact?
There's no doubt that some
care profoundly, and spend their
energies without stint. But the
available evidence so far doesn't
suggest that these are very
numerous.
Last Spring, there was in the
county next-door to us a
Congressional primary contest
that appeared to have just about
every conceivable attraction for
large numbers of students, given
the circumstances of that
moment. The incumbent was
perhaps the leading "dove" in the
House of Representatives. It was
widely believed that if this
Congressman could survive the
Republican primary, where he was
opposed by a candidate of sharply
opposing views who was thought
to have much greater appeal to

party loyalists, vict y in the
November election was
overwhelmingly likely.
(
So the primary was important, <
the candidate was attractive to all <
but the most radical and most I
conservative students, and student <
help in the campaign was warmly -
welcomed. The Congressman won, >
and students, working on their I
own time and with no University 1
endorsement, helped significantly I
in achieving his victory. But the i
total number of Stanford students I
involved even to the extent of a |
single adventure in
precinct-walking was about 350, |
or three percent of the student 1
body. And only about 1 00 , or less <
than one percent, worked on any i
kind of sustained or continuous i
basis in that primary campaign. I
Much the same thing appears if '
you look at the situation 1
nationally. It may well be true '
that half the population of this j
country is now 25 years old or
less. But the median voting '
age—the average age of those who
actually get themselves to the
polls and pull the lever or mark
their "X' is 4 7 .
Furthermore, the indications
are—and long have been—clear
that younger people are less likely :
to vote than older people. In .
1968, the percentage of the
eligible population that voted was
only 33 percent for ages 18 to 20
(that is, where the voting age was
below 21, only 1 /3 of the
under-21 -year-olds took advantage
of the opportunity). It was 51
percent for those aged 21-24, as
against 7 2 percent for the great
armies of the middle-aged, those
aged 30 to 64. Even among
eligible voters over 64, which
would be bound to include
substantial numbers for whom
going to vote would be quite a
chore, (he percentage was just
twice as good as for the
under-21 's.
Obviously there are lots of
things one would wish to know
before making too much out of
such facts and figures. But even at
first glance they suggest that, for
whatever reasons, your own age
group doesn't for the most part
even seize the threshold
opportunity for political
involvement—the right to work
and vote in elections.
You are accustomed to
challenging the institutions of our
society, mostly run by your
elders, to commit themselves to
change. I'd like, with all due
respect to the amount that young
people have accomplished in
American politics, from
Alexander Hamilton to Julian
Bond, to challenge you to make

the youth movement in
American political life something
more durable, more constructive
and more significant than the
headline-hunting antics of
Weathermen and Yippies.
Some will tell you that this
would be a waste of time, that the
system won't respond—perhaps
even that it is now so moribund
thai it can't respond. But as
Henry Fairlie once wrote: "The
worst and best thing about
politicians is that they are
representative of the people who
elect them."
The fact today is that the
system is responding, but the
people to whom it is responding
are not for the most part those
who want withdrawal from
Vietnam now, an environmental
cleanup now, and greater
attention to the problems of
poverty now; it is responding to
the great and growing number
who are demanding law and order,
fewer constraints upon the police,
and a crackdown on youthful
protest the moment it departs
from strictest standards of
decorum.
It may just be that you have
entered the University at a
moment in history when, on top
of everything else, its body is
being fought over and its soul
imperilled. If, in the agony of our
time, freedom and diversity on
the campus are thought to be
luxiries we can no longer afford,
there will soon be no universities
worthy of the name. If the
political voice of youth is to be
the voice of the Wisconsin
bombers, nihilism and despair will
be the only winners. If every
attempt, no matter how careful,
to stem the tide of violence and
hatred here at home is met by
cries of "Repression!," or by
indifference born of disgust at the
violence abroad, we shall deserve
our grim fate—and we'll carry
along with us millions of people
elsewhere in the world who don't
deserve it. There's something
particularly contemptible about
academic apologists for violence.
As an English commentator
remarked several years ago, "Calls
for more excitement, unreason,
violence and danger naturally tend
to come from people who live
relatively sheltered lives, measured
by examinations and
promotions."
You came here for many
purposes, in many moods and
with diverse expectations. Some
of you will feel almost
immediately that these are,
indeed, the best years of your
lives, despite our troubles; some
others of you will find little or
nothing to your liking here. Most
of you will probably find
yourselves somewhere in between,
baffled at times by complexity
and rapid change and strident
challenges on all sides, but
fulfilled at times by the sheer
excitement of learning how to
learn, and how to act on the basis
of learning.
For all but a few of you,
politics, even in the broadest

distorting your initial picture of

Henry Fairlie once wrote: "The
worst and best thing about
politicians is that they are
representative of the people who
elect them."
The fact today is that the
system is responding, but the
people to whom it is responding
are not for the most part those
who want withdrawal from
Vietnam now, an environmental
cleanup now, and greater
attention to the problems of
poverty now; it is responding to
the great and growing number
who are demanding law and order,
fewer constraints upon the police,
and a crackdown on youthful
protest the moment it departs
from strictest standards of
decorum.
It may just be that you have
entered the University at a
moment in history when, on top
of everything else, its body is
being fought over and its soul
imperilled. If, in the agony of our
time, freedom and diversity on
the campus are thought to be
luxiries we can no longer afford,
there will soon be no universities
worthy of the name. If the
political voice of youth is to be
the voice of the Wisconsin
bombers, nihilism and despair will
be the only winners. If every
attempt, no matter how careful,
to stem the tide of violence and
hatred here at home is met by
cries of "Repression!," or by
indifference born of disgust at the
violence abroad, we shall deserve
our grim fate—and we'll carry
along with us millions of people
elsewhere in the world who don't
deserve it. There's something
particularly contemptible about
academic apologists for violence.
As an English commentator
remarked several years ago, "Calls
for more excitement, unreason,
violence and danger naturally tend
to come from people who live
relatively sheltered lives, measured
by examinations and
promotions."
You came here for many
purposes, in many moods and
with diverse expectations. Some
of you will feel almost
immediately that these are,
indeed, the best years of your
lives, despite our troubles; some
others of you will find little or
nothing to your liking here. Most
of you will probably find
yourselves somewhere in between,
baffled at times by complexity
and rapid change and strident
challenges on all sides, but
fulfilled at times by the sheer
excitement of learning how to
learn, and how to act on the basis
of learning.
For all but a few of you,
politics, even in the broadest
sense, will be only a part of life
and learning. I've taken the risk of
distorting your initial picture of
Stanford bv limiting myself to
this subject, and also by telling
you several things you may not
very much wish to hear. You have
a right to be told things you do
not wish to hear, and beware of
anyone who speaks only to truths
you already know, or prejudices
you already share. I've no doubt
that you'll do your share of
talking back; and that, also, is as
should be.

Your own age group doesn't for-the most pert even seize
the threshold opportunity for political involvement-the
right to work and vote in elections.
I'd like to challenge you to make of the youth
movement in American political life something more
durable, more constructive and more significant than
the headline-hunting antics of the Weathermen and
Yippies.

If, in the agony of our time, freedom and diversity on
campus are thought to be luxuries we can no longer
afford, there will soon be no universities worthy of the
name. If the political voice of youth is to be the voice of
the Wisconsin bombers, nihilism and despair will be the
only winners.

Following are excerpts from
remarks prepared for delivery by
President Richard W. Lyman at
Freshman Convocation Sept. 25,
1970.
You enter college at a time
when there is less certainty about
what higher education means or
ought to mean than ever in living
memory. There are more doubts
in the minds of students as to
their own purposes, as well as
those of the institutions they
attend, than ever.
And, as usual when everyone is
uncertain, everyone shouts louder.
The poet, Karl Shapiro, no doubt
exaggerated when he said earlier
this year: "It appears that the
modern student enters the
university with a contempt for the
university, a contempt for society,
a contempt for literature, and a
contempt for himself."
But so, surely, are those
middle-aged idolators of youth
exaggerating, who picture the
college student of today as the
first human being ever to
recognize the possibility of
leading a virtuous life, and to act
on the basis of that discovery. We
are, almost all of us, a lot less sure
of ourselves, a lot less confident

that we have the world figured
out, than we allow ourselves to
appear. That, at any rate, ought to
be a common bond, and a source
of comfort to you as you try to
mak<* sense of the university, and
your place in it . . .
Clearly, politics and its relation
to the University is a hot topic.
That might be reason enough to
discuss it, but there are further
reasons as well. It raises questions
that have to be faced now, they
cannot be put off. And they are
questions that cannot really be
fudged. So we may as well try to
understand one another about
them.
In a statement issued this past
summer I tried to make clear

distinction between political
activity on the part of individuals
or groups of individuals at
Stanford on the one hand, and, on
the other, political activity that
makes use of the University's
resources—whether telephones,
Xerox machines, or rent-free
office space—or conveys a clear
connotation of official University
involvement, such as writing
"Why 1 love Governor Jess
Reagan" letters on Stanford
letterhead. Like many statements
of policy, it represents an attempt
to resolve a dilemma.
One horn of this dilemma is
this: many of us believe that if the
United States is to survive—if we
are to survive as human beings on
this planet—the quality of
American political life must
improve, drastically and quickly.

By this I mean several things,
among them the following:
Attention to major issues of
survival must increase, and
preoccupation with trivial issues
decrease; ways of seeking and
achieving change through the
political system must be opened
up and clarified, so that they
really do exist and people can see
that they exist; the general level
of involvement in politics on the
part of millions of people who are
not professional politicians must
rise dramatically, and stay risen.
It's not enough to get excited
when the headlines of some fresh
disaster stir one's metabolism; the
involvement has to be steady and
unremitting, patient but
relentless.

The terrible grip of private
selfishness, not just on the part of
major corporations but among
everyday tax-paying (or
tax-resisting) citizens, must give
way to a sharply increased
readiness to see money change
hands and power relationships
alter so that urgent public
questions, such as racial equality
and environmental protection, can
be dealt with.
All this and much more must
happen. To say that it must
happen is not to denigrate all
previous generations of
Americans, nor all present
politicians; it is merely to say that
the problems that must be
resolved politically today are
unprecedentedly serious and
difficult, and therefore are not
likely to yield to further doses of
the mixture-as-before.
Clearly college students and
other university people must help
to accomplish the needed changes.
If they don't, no one else
will—not because they are
uniquely virtuous—but simply
because university people ought
to be among the people most
sensitive to the tragic condition of
the world today, and best able, by
reason of their abilities and their
opportunities, to do something
about it.

All of that is on one horn of
the dilemma. On the other is the
very real question of protecting
the University itself against
becoming thoroughly politicized
and therefore no longer free.
The unwillingness of so many
even to consider that this is a real
question, a serious danger that we
face, is to me truly frightening.
Such unwillingness stems, no
doubt, from the desperate feeling
enunciated by the student whose
letter I've quoted: a fear of
repression, plus a conviction that
(as one student put it) "We are
running out of institutions that
will question our society just
when those challenges are badly
needed."
1 understand the fear and the
desperation, but to move from
these to a belief that human and
political survival will best be
served by turning the University
into a political instrument is, 1 am
deeply convinced, to confuse the
disease with its cure. It is like
many other panic reactions: those
in fear do just that thing which
will most certainly bring about
the fate they fear most.
Let me explain. Universities are
indeed, and to a unique degree,
the "institutions that will
question our society." Or any
other society, for that matter. The
mere continuing existence of a
real university serves to question
society. More than ever
before—because they occupy a
bigger share of the intellectual
terrain, so to speak—universities
are the prime centers of criticism.
Even the arts, which at their
best are among the most effective
critics of any society, are more
dependent upon the freedom and
support they find on a university
campus than in the past. You
would not have found very many
novelists, poets, sculptors,
playwrights, etc. in residence in
the universities of the earlier 2 0 th
Century. The very notion would
have seemed strange and exotic to
those much more limited and
parochial institutions.
But how long would such
freedom last, once it became clear
that universities were available
instruments for the promotion of
a particular brand of politics or
candidates? Why on earth should
we expect that a society full of
powerful and wealthy interest
groups will be willing to watch
without doing anything about it
while the diversity and openness
of the universities are abandoned
in favor of institutional
commitment and the production
"| of political propaganda?

Let me be specific. If the
universities allow themselves to be
captured by their politically most
active members, and used to
promote political purposes, one of
two things will quickly
happen—and probably both. One:
using the law already on the
books governing corporations
organized for educational
purposes, those who did not like
this turn of events would go to
court to get the universities' tax
exemption removed.
We could not survive at all, in
these days of massive deficits,
without tax exemption—both on
our own educational activities and
on the gifts people give us.
Perhaps the courts would save us.
But the law is pretty plain-spoken.
It defines a tax-exempt
educational corporation as, inter
alia, an institution "no substantial
part of the activities of which is
carrying on propaganda, or
otherwise attempting, to influence
legislation, and which does not
participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or
distributing of statements), any
political campaign on behalf of
any candidate for public office."
Second, and perhaps
simultaneously, efforts would be
made to enlist universities on the
side of political interests very

different from the political
interests that are most active and
prominent on the campus today.
There is nothing in the law of
nature that says a politicized
university must always be
politicized in favor of peace,
freedom, and equality. In a
contest for control of the
universities in which no holds are
barred—i.e., a contest that takes
place after we've abandoned the
whole idea of being a refuge for
all points of view, however
unpopular or even distasteful, and
have launched ourselves instead as
political institutions—who would
predict that the forces of
enlightenment and unselfishness
would prevail? As that veteran
socialist, Carl Landauer, said
recently, "The University cannot
at the same time be a forum for
the combat of ideas and a party in
that combat . . . Once the rule of
institutional neutrality was
abrogated, the political Right
would be more effective than the
Left in using the universities for
its own purposes."
Does this mean that the
University should resist all contact
with politics, except perhaps to
offer genteel seminars in "A
Theory of the Calculus of Voting"
or "The Transmission of Political
Values from Parent to Child." 1
believe not.
Of course the University's first
duty in relation to politics, as in
relation to anything else, is to
learn and teach more about the
subject. That learning, that
teaching, can and should take
place in a wide variety of ways
and at a number of different
levels.

There is no reason why
learning and teaching about
practical politics, or about acutely
contemporary problems of
political action, should not take
place in the University, provided
only that the game is played with
non-loaded dice. And students
who are serious about having an
impact upon the direction of
national policy had better be
serious about doing their
homework in advance.
How many students are serious
about having that impact?
There's no doubt that some
care profoundly, and spend their
energies without stint. But the
available evidence so far doesn't
suggest that these are very
numerous.
Last Spring, there was in the
county next-door to us a
Congressional primary contest
that appeared to have just about
every conceivable attraction for
large numbers of students, given
the circumstances of that
moment. The incumbent was
perhaps the leading "dove" in the
House of Representatives. It was
widely believed that if this
Congressman could survive the
Republican primary, where he was
opposed by a candidate of sharply
opposing views who was thought
to have much greater appeal to

party loyalists, vict y in the
November election was
overwhelmingly likely.
(
So the primary was important, <
the candidate was attractive to all <
but the most radical and most I
conservative students, and student <
help in the campaign was warmly -
welcomed. The Congressman won, >
and students, working on their I
own time and with no University 1
endorsement, helped significantly I
in achieving his victory. But the i
total number of Stanford students I
involved even to the extent of a |
single adventure in
precinct-walking was about 350, |
or three percent of the student 1
body. And only about 1 00 , or less <
than one percent, worked on any i
kind of sustained or continuous i
basis in that primary campaign. I
Much the same thing appears if '
you look at the situation 1
nationally. It may well be true '
that half the population of this j
country is now 25 years old or
less. But the median voting '
age—the average age of those who
actually get themselves to the
polls and pull the lever or mark
their "X' is 4 7 .
Furthermore, the indications
are—and long have been—clear
that younger people are less likely :
to vote than older people. In .
1968, the percentage of the
eligible population that voted was
only 33 percent for ages 18 to 20
(that is, where the voting age was
below 21, only 1 /3 of the
under-21 -year-olds took advantage
of the opportunity). It was 51
percent for those aged 21-24, as
against 7 2 percent for the great
armies of the middle-aged, those
aged 30 to 64. Even among
eligible voters over 64, which
would be bound to include
substantial numbers for whom
going to vote would be quite a
chore, (he percentage was just
twice as good as for the
under-21 's.
Obviously there are lots of
things one would wish to know
before making too much out of
such facts and figures. But even at
first glance they suggest that, for
whatever reasons, your own age
group doesn't for the most part
even seize the threshold
opportunity for political
involvement—the right to work
and vote in elections.
You are accustomed to
challenging the institutions of our
society, mostly run by your
elders, to commit themselves to
change. I'd like, with all due
respect to the amount that young
people have accomplished in
American politics, from
Alexander Hamilton to Julian
Bond, to challenge you to make

the youth movement in
American political life something
more durable, more constructive
and more significant than the
headline-hunting antics of
Weathermen and Yippies.
Some will tell you that this
would be a waste of time, that the
system won't respond—perhaps
even that it is now so moribund
thai it can't respond. But as
Henry Fairlie once wrote: "The
worst and best thing about
politicians is that they are
representative of the people who
elect them."
The fact today is that the
system is responding, but the
people to whom it is responding
are not for the most part those
who want withdrawal from
Vietnam now, an environmental
cleanup now, and greater
attention to the problems of
poverty now; it is responding to
the great and growing number
who are demanding law and order,
fewer constraints upon the police,
and a crackdown on youthful
protest the moment it departs
from strictest standards of
decorum.
It may just be that you have
entered the University at a
moment in history when, on top
of everything else, its body is
being fought over and its soul
imperilled. If, in the agony of our
time, freedom and diversity on
the campus are thought to be
luxiries we can no longer afford,
there will soon be no universities
worthy of the name. If the
political voice of youth is to be
the voice of the Wisconsin
bombers, nihilism and despair will
be the only winners. If every
attempt, no matter how careful,
to stem the tide of violence and
hatred here at home is met by
cries of "Repression!," or by
indifference born of disgust at the

that younger people are less likely :
to vote than older people. In .
1968, the percentage of the
eligible population that voted was
only 33 percent for ages 18 to 20
(that is, where the voting age was
below 21, only 1 /3 of the
under-21 -year-olds took advantage
of the opportunity). It was 51
percent for those aged 21-24, as
against 7 2 percent for the great
armies of the middle-aged, those
aged 30 to 64. Even among
eligible voters over 64, which
would be bound to include
substantial numbers for whom
going to vote would be quite a
chore, (he percentage was just
twice as good as for the
under-21 's.
Obviously there are lots of
things one would wish to know
before making too much out of
such facts and figures. But even at
first glance they suggest that, for
whatever reasons, your own age
group doesn't for the most part
even seize the threshold
opportunity for political
involvement—the right to work
and vote in elections.
You are accustomed to
challenging the institutions of our
society, mostly run by your
elders, to commit themselves to
change. I'd like, with all due
respect to the amount that young
people have accomplished in
American politics, from
Alexander Hamilton to Julian
Bond, to challenge you to make

the youth movement in
American political life something
more durable, more constructive
and more significant than the
headline-hunting antics of
Weathermen and Yippies.
Some will tell you that this
would be a waste of time, that the
system won't respond—perhaps
even that it is now so moribund
thai it can't respond. But as
Henry Fairlie once wrote: "The
worst and best thing about
politicians is that they are
representative of the people who
elect them."
The fact today is that the
system is responding, but the
people to whom it is responding
are not for the most part those
who want withdrawal from
Vietnam now, an environmental
cleanup now, and greater
attention to the problems of
poverty now; it is responding to
the great and growing number
who are demanding law and order,
fewer constraints upon the police,
and a crackdown on youthful
protest the moment it departs
from strictest standards of
decorum.
It may just be that you have
entered the University at a
moment in history when, on top
of everything else, its body is
being fought over and its soul
imperilled. If, in the agony of our
time, freedom and diversity on
the campus are thought to be
luxiries we can no longer afford,
there will soon be no universities
worthy of the name. If the
political voice of youth is to be
the voice of the Wisconsin
bombers, nihilism and despair will
be the only winners. If every
attempt, no matter how careful,
to stem the tide of violence and
hatred here at home is met by
cries of "Repression!," or by
indifference born of disgust at the
violence abroad, we shall deserve
our grim fate—and we'll carry
along with us millions of people
elsewhere in the world who don't
deserve it. There's something
particularly contemptible about
academic apologists for violence.
As an English commentator
remarked several years ago, "Calls
for more excitement, unreason,
violence and danger naturally tend
to come from people who live
relatively sheltered lives, measured
by examinations and
promotions."
You came here for many
purposes, in many moods and
with diverse expectations. Some
of you will feel almost
immediately that these are,
indeed, the best years of your
lives, despite our troubles; some
others of you will find little or
nothing to your liking here. Most
of you will probably find
yourselves somewhere in between,
baffled at times by complexity
and rapid change and strident
challenges on all sides, but
fulfilled at times by the sheer
excitement of learning how to
learn, and how to act on the basis
of learning.
For all but a few of you,
politics, even in the broadest
sense, will be only a part of life
and learning. I've taken the risk of
distorting your initial picture of
Stanford bv limiting myself to
this subject, and also by telling
you several things you may not
very much wish to hear. You have
a right to be told things you do
not wish to hear, and beware of
anyone who speaks only to truths
you already know, or prejudices
you already share. I've no doubt
that you'll do your share of
talking back; and that, also, is as
should be.

Your own age group doesn't for-the most pert even seize
the threshold opportunity for political involvement-the
right to work and vote in elections.
I'd like to challenge you to make of the youth
movement in American political life something more
durable, more constructive and more significant than

Following are excerpts from
remarks prepared for delivery by
President Richard W. Lyman at
Freshman Convocation Sept. 25,
1970.
You enter college at a time
when there is less certainty about
what higher education means or
ought to mean than ever in living
memory. There are more doubts
in the minds of students as to
their own purposes, as well as
those of the institutions they
attend, than ever.
And, as usual when everyone is
uncertain, everyone shouts louder.
The poet, Karl Shapiro, no doubt
exaggerated when he said earlier
this year: "It appears that the
modern student enters the
university with a contempt for the
university, a contempt for society,
a contempt for literature, and a
contempt for himself."
But so, surely, are those
middle-aged idolators of youth
exaggerating, who picture the
college student of today as the
first human being ever to
recognize the possibility of
leading a virtuous life, and to act
on the basis of that discovery. We
are, almost all of us, a lot less sure
of ourselves, a lot less confident

that we have the world figured
out, than we allow ourselves to
appear. That, at any rate, ought to
be a common bond, and a source
of comfort to you as you try to
mak<* sense of the university, and
your place in it . . .
Clearly, politics and its relation
to the University is a hot topic.
That might be reason enough to
discuss it, but there are further
reasons as well. It raises questions
that have to be faced now, they
cannot be put off. And they are
questions that cannot really be
fudged. So we may as well try to
understand one another about
them.
In a statement issued this past
summer I tried to make clear

distinction between political
activity on the part of individuals
or groups of individuals at
Stanford on the one hand, and, on
the other, political activity that
makes use of the University's
resources—whether telephones,
Xerox machines, or rent-free
office space—or conveys a clear
connotation of official University
involvement, such as writing
"Why 1 love Governor Jess
Reagan" letters on Stanford
letterhead. Like many statements
of policy, it represents an attempt
to resolve a dilemma.
One horn of this dilemma is
this: many of us believe that if the
United States is to survive—if we
are to survive as human beings on
this planet—the quality of
American political life must
improve, drastically and quickly.

By this I mean several things,
among them the following:
Attention to major issues of
survival must increase, and
preoccupation with trivial issues
decrease; ways of seeking and
achieving change through the
political system must be opened
up and clarified, so that they
really do exist and people can see
that they exist; the general level
of involvement in politics on the
part of millions of people who are
not professional politicians must
rise dramatically, and stay risen.
It's not enough to get excited
when the headlines of some fresh
disaster stir one's metabolism; the
involvement has to be steady and
unremitting, patient but
relentless.

The terrible grip of private
selfishness, not just on the part of
major corporations but among
everyday tax-paying (or
tax-resisting) citizens, must give
way to a sharply increased
readiness to see money change
hands and power relationships
alter so that urgent public
questions, such as racial equality
and environmental protection, can
be dealt with.
All this and much more must
happen. To say that it must
happen is not to denigrate all
previous generations of
Americans, nor all present
politicians; it is merely to say that
the problems that must be
resolved politically today are
unprecedentedly serious and
difficult, and therefore are not
likely to yield to further doses of
the mixture-as-before.
Clearly college students and
other university people must help
to accomplish the needed changes.
If they don't, no one else
will—not because they are
uniquely virtuous—but simply
because university people ought
to be among the people most
sensitive to the tragic condition of
the world today, and best able, by
reason of their abilities and their
opportunities, to do something
about it.

All of that is on one horn of
the dilemma. On the other is the
very real question of protecting
the University itself against
becoming thoroughly politicized
and therefore no longer free.
The unwillingness of so many
even to consider that this is a real
question, a serious danger that we
face, is to me truly frightening.
Such unwillingness stems, no
doubt, from the desperate feeling
enunciated by the student whose
letter I've quoted: a fear of
repression, plus a conviction that
(as one student put it) "We are
running out of institutions that
will question our society just
when those challenges are badly
needed."
1 understand the fear and the
desperation, but to move from
these to a belief that human and
political survival will best be
served by turning the University
into a political instrument is, 1 am
deeply convinced, to confuse the
disease with its cure. It is like
many other panic reactions: those
in fear do just that thing which
will most certainly bring about
the fate they fear most.
Let me explain. Universities are
indeed, and to a unique degree,
the "institutions that will
question our society." Or any
other society, for that matter. The
mere continuing existence of a
real university serves to question
society. More than ever
before—because they occupy a
bigger share of the intellectual
terrain, so to speak—universities
are the prime centers of criticism.
Even the arts, which at their
best are among the most effective
critics of any society, are more
dependent upon the freedom and
support they find on a university
campus than in the past. You
would not have found very many
novelists, poets, sculptors,
playwrights, etc. in residence in
the universities of the earlier 2 0 th
Century. The very notion would
have seemed strange and exotic to
those much more limited and
parochial institutions.
But how long would such
freedom last, once it became clear
that universities were available
instruments for the promotion of
a particular brand of politics or
candidates? Why on earth should
we expect that a society full of
powerful and wealthy interest
groups will be willing to watch
without doing anything about it
while the diversity and openness
of the universities are abandoned
in favor of institutional
commitment and the production
"| of political propaganda?

Let me be specific. If the
universities allow themselves to be
captured by their politically most
active members, and used to
promote political purposes, one of
two things will quickly
happen—and probably both. One:
using the law already on the
books governing corporations
organized for educational
purposes, those who did not like
this turn of events would go to
court to get the universities' tax
exemption removed.
We could not survive at all, in
these days of massive deficits,
without tax exemption—both on
our own educational activities and
on the gifts people give us.
Perhaps the courts would save us.
But the law is pretty plain-spoken.
It defines a tax-exempt
educational corporation as, inter
alia, an institution "no substantial
part of the activities of which is
carrying on propaganda, or
otherwise attempting, to influence
legislation, and which does not
participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or
distributing of statements), any
political campaign on behalf of
any candidate for public office."
Second, and perhaps
simultaneously, efforts would be
made to enlist universities on the
side of political interests very

different from the political
interests that are most active and
prominent on the campus today.
There is nothing in the law of
nature that says a politicized
university must always be
politicized in favor of peace,
freedom, and equality. In a
contest for control of the
universities in which no holds are
barred—i.e., a contest that takes
place after we've abandoned the
whole idea of being a refuge for
all points of view, however
unpopular or even distasteful, and
have launched ourselves instead as
political institutions—who would
predict that the forces of
enlightenment and unselfishness
would prevail? As that veteran
socialist, Carl Landauer, said
recently, "The University cannot
at the same time be a forum for
the combat of ideas and a party in
that combat . . . Once the rule of
institutional neutrality was
abrogated, the political Right
would be more effective than the
Left in using the universities for
its own purposes."
Does this mean that the
University should resist all contact
with politics, except perhaps to
offer genteel seminars in "A
Theory of the Calculus of Voting"
or "The Transmission of Political
Values from Parent to Child." 1
believe not.
Of course the University's first
duty in relation to politics, as in
relation to anything else, is to
learn and teach more about the
subject. That learning, that
teaching, can and should take
place in a wide variety of ways
and at a number of different
levels.

There is no reason why
learning and teaching about
practical politics, or about acutely
contemporary problems of
political action, should not take
place in the University, provided
only that the game is played with
non-loaded dice. And students
who are serious about having an
impact upon the direction of
national policy had better be
serious about doing their
homework in advance.
How many students are serious
about having that impact?
There's no doubt that some
care profoundly, and spend their
energies without stint. But the
available evidence so far doesn't
suggest that these are very
numerous.
Last Spring, there was in the
county next-door to us a
Congressional primary contest
that appeared to have just about
every conceivable attraction for
large numbers of students, given
the circumstances of that
moment. The incumbent was
perhaps the leading "dove" in the
House of Representatives. It was
widely believed that if this
Congressman could survive the
Republican primary, where he was
opposed by a candidate of sharply
opposing views who was thought
to have much greater appeal to

party loyalists, vict y in the
November election was
overwhelmingly likely.
(
So the primary was important, <
the candidate was attractive to all <
but the most radical and most I
conservative students, and student <
help in the campaign was warmly -
welcomed. The Congressman won, >
and students, working on their I
own time and with no University 1
endorsement, helped significantly I
in achieving his victory. But the i
total number of Stanford students I
involved even to the extent of a |
single adventure in
precinct-walking was about 350, |
or three percent of the student 1
body. And only about 1 00 , or less <
than one percent, worked on any i
kind of sustained or continuous i
basis in that primary campaign. I
Much the same thing appears if '
you look at the situation 1
nationally. It may well be true '
that half the population of this j
country is now 25 years old or
less. But the median voting '
age—the average age of those who
actually get themselves to the
polls and pull the lever or mark
their "X' is 4 7 .
Furthermore, the indications
are—and long have been—clear
that younger people are less likely :
to vote than older people. In .
1968, the percentage of the
eligible population that voted was
only 33 percent for ages 18 to 20
(that is, where the voting age was
below 21, only 1 /3 of the
under-21 -year-olds took advantage
of the opportunity). It was 51
percent for those aged 21-24, as
against 7 2 percent for the great
armies of the middle-aged, those
aged 30 to 64. Even among
eligible voters over 64, which
would be bound to include
substantial numbers for whom
going to vote would be quite a
chore, (he percentage was just
twice as good as for the
under-21 's.
Obviously there are lots of
things one would wish to know
before making too much out of
such facts and figures. But even at
first glance they suggest that, for
whatever reasons, your own age
group doesn't for the most part
even seize the threshold
opportunity for political
involvement—the right to work
and vote in elections.
You are accustomed to
challenging the institutions of our
society, mostly run by your
elders, to commit themselves to
change. I'd like, with all due
respect to the amount that young
people have accomplished in
American politics, from
Alexander Hamilton to Julian
Bond, to challenge you to make

the youth movement in
American political life something
more durable, more constructive
and more significant than the
headline-hunting antics of
Weathermen and Yippies.
Some will tell you that this
would be a waste of time, that the
system won't respond—perhaps
even that it is now so moribund

worst and best thing about

who want withdrawal from
Vietnam now, an environmental
cleanup now, and greater
attention to the problems of
poverty now; it is responding to
the great and growing number
who are demanding law and order,
fewer constraints upon the police,
and a crackdown on youthful
protest the moment it departs
from strictest standards of
decorum.
It may just be that you have

available evidence so far doesn't
suggest that these are very
numerous.
Last Spring, there was in the
county next-door to us a
Congressional primary contest
that appeared to have just about
every conceivable attraction for
large numbers of students, given
the circumstances of that
moment. The incumbent was
perhaps the leading "dove" in the
House of Representatives. It was
widely believed that if this
Congressman could survive the
Republican primary, where he was
opposed by a candidate of sharply
opposing views who was thought
to have much greater appeal to

party loyalists, vict y in the
November election was
overwhelmingly likely.
(
So the primary was important, <
the candidate was attractive to all <
but the most radical and most I
conservative students, and student <
help in the campaign was warmly -
welcomed. The Congressman won, >
and students, working on their I
own time and with no University 1
endorsement, helped significantly I
in achieving his victory. But the i
total number of Stanford students I
involved even to the extent of a |
single adventure in
precinct-walking was about 350, |
or three percent of the student 1
body. And only about 1 00 , or less <
than one percent, worked on any i
kind of sustained or continuous i
basis in that primary campaign. I
Much the same thing appears if '
you look at the situation 1
nationally. It may well be true '
that half the population of this j
country is now 25 years old or
less. But the median voting '
age—the average age of those who
actually get themselves to the
polls and pull the lever or mark
their "X' is 4 7 .
Furthermore, the indications
are—and long have been—clear
that younger people are less likely :
to vote than older people. In .
1968, the percentage of the
eligible population that voted was
only 33 percent for ages 18 to 20
(that is, where the voting age was
below 21, only 1 /3 of the
under-21 -year-olds took advantage
of the opportunity). It was 51
percent for those aged 21-24, as
against 7 2 percent for the great
armies of the middle-aged, those
aged 30 to 64. Even among
eligible voters over 64, which
would be bound to include
substantial numbers for whom
going to vote would be quite a
chore, (he percentage was just
twice as good as for the
under-21 's.
Obviously there are lots of
things one would wish to know
before making too much out of
such facts and figures. But even at
first glance they suggest that, for
whatever reasons, your own age
group doesn't for the most part
even seize the threshold
opportunity for political
involvement—the right to work
and vote in elections.
You are accustomed to
challenging the institutions of our
society, mostly run by your
elders, to commit themselves to
change. I'd like, with all due
respect to the amount that young
people have accomplished in
American politics, from
Alexander Hamilton to Julian
Bond, to challenge you to make

the youth movement in
American political life something
more durable, more constructive
and more significant than the
headline-hunting antics of
Weathermen and Yippies.
Some will tell you that this
would be a waste of time, that the
system won't respond—perhaps
even that it is now so moribund
thai it can't respond. But as
Henry Fairlie once wrote: "The
worst and best thing about
politicians is that they are
representative of the people who
elect them."
The fact today is that the
system is responding, but the
people to whom it is responding
are not for the most part those
who want withdrawal from
Vietnam now, an environmental
cleanup now, and greater
attention to the problems of
poverty now; it is responding to
the great and growing number
who are demanding law and order,
fewer constraints upon the police,
and a crackdown on youthful
protest the moment it departs
from strictest standards of
decorum.
It may just be that you have
entered the University at a
moment in history when, on top
of everything else, its body is
being fought over and its soul
imperilled. If, in the agony of our
time, freedom and diversity on
the campus are thought to be
luxiries we can no longer afford,
there will soon be no universities
worthy of the name. If the
political voice of youth is to be
the voice of the Wisconsin
bombers, nihilism and despair will
be the only winners. If every
attempt, no matter how careful,
to stem the tide of violence and
hatred here at home is met by
cries of "Repression!," or by
indifference born of disgust at the
violence abroad, we shall deserve
our grim fate—and we'll carry
along with us millions of people
elsewhere in the world who don't
deserve it. There's something
particularly contemptible about
academic apologists for violence.
As an English commentator
remarked several years ago, "Calls
for more excitement, unreason,
violence and danger naturally tend
to come from people who live
relatively sheltered lives, measured
by examinations and
promotions."
You came here for many
purposes, in many moods and
with diverse expectations. Some
of you will feel almost
immediately that these are,
indeed, the best years of your
lives, despite our troubles; some
others of you will find little or
nothing to your liking here. Most
of you will probably find
yourselves somewhere in between,
baffled at times by complexity
and rapid change and strident
challenges on all sides, but
fulfilled at times by the sheer
excitement of learning how to
learn, and how to act on the basis
of learning.
For all but a few of you,
politics, even in the broadest
sense, will be only a part of life
and learning. I've taken the risk of
distorting your initial picture of
Stanford bv limiting myself to
this subject, and also by telling
you several things you may not
very much wish to hear. You have
a right to be told things you do
not wish to hear, and beware of
anyone who speaks only to truths
you already know, or prejudices
you already share. I've no doubt
that you'll do your share of
talking back; and that, also, is as
should be.

Your own age group doesn't for-the most pert even seize
the threshold opportunity for political involvement-the
right to work and vote in elections.
I'd like to challenge you to make of the youth
movement in American political life something more

Following are excerpts from
remarks prepared for delivery by
President Richard W. Lyman at
Freshman Convocation Sept. 25,
1970.
You enter college at a time
when there is less certainty about
what higher education means or
ought to mean than ever in living
memory. There are more doubts
in the minds of students as to
their own purposes, as well as
those of the institutions they
attend, than ever.
And, as usual when everyone is
uncertain, everyone shouts louder.
The poet, Karl Shapiro, no doubt
exaggerated when he said earlier
this year: "It appears that the
modern student enters the
university with a contempt for the
university, a contempt for society,
a contempt for literature, and a
contempt for himself."
But so, surely, are those
middle-aged idolators of youth
exaggerating, who picture the
college student of today as the
first human being ever to
recognize the possibility of
leading a virtuous life, and to act
on the basis of that discovery. We
are, almost all of us, a lot less sure
of ourselves, a lot less confident

that we have the world figured
out, than we allow ourselves to
appear. That, at any rate, ought to
be a common bond, and a source
of comfort to you as you try to
mak<* sense of the university, and
your place in it . . .
Clearly, politics and its relation
to the University is a hot topic.
That might be reason enough to
discuss it, but there are further
reasons as well. It raises questions
that have to be faced now, they
cannot be put off. And they are
questions that cannot really be
fudged. So we may as well try to
understand one another about
them.
In a statement issued this past
summer I tried to make clear

distinction between political
activity on the part of individuals
or groups of individuals at
Stanford on the one hand, and, on
the other, political activity that
makes use of the University's
resources—whether telephones,
Xerox machines, or rent-free
office space—or conveys a clear
connotation of official University
involvement, such as writing
"Why 1 love Governor Jess
Reagan" letters on Stanford
letterhead. Like many statements
of policy, it represents an attempt
to resolve a dilemma.
One horn of this dilemma is
this: many of us believe that if the
United States is to survive—if we
are to survive as human beings on
this planet—the quality of
American political life must
improve, drastically and quickly.

By this I mean several things,
among them the following:
Attention to major issues of
survival must increase, and
preoccupation with trivial issues
decrease; ways of seeking and
achieving change through the
political system must be opened
up and clarified, so that they
really do exist and people can see
that they exist; the general level
of involvement in politics on the
part of millions of people who are
not professional politicians must
rise dramatically, and stay risen.
It's not enough to get excited
when the headlines of some fresh
disaster stir one's metabolism; the
involvement has to be steady and
unremitting, patient but
relentless.

The terrible grip of private
selfishness, not just on the part of
major corporations but among
everyday tax-paying (or
tax-resisting) citizens, must give
way to a sharply increased
readiness to see money change
hands and power relationships
alter so that urgent public
questions, such as racial equality
and environmental protection, can
be dealt with.
All this and much more must
happen. To say that it must
happen is not to denigrate all
previous generations of
Americans, nor all present
politicians; it is merely to say that
the problems that must be
resolved politically today are
unprecedentedly serious and
difficult, and therefore are not
likely to yield to further doses of
the mixture-as-before.
Clearly college students and
other university people must help
to accomplish the needed changes.
If they don't, no one else
will—not because they are
uniquely virtuous—but simply
because university people ought
to be among the people most
sensitive to the tragic condition of
the world today, and best able, by
reason of their abilities and their
opportunities, to do something
about it.

All of that is on one horn of
the dilemma. On the other is the
very real question of protecting
the University itself against
becoming thoroughly politicized
and therefore no longer free.
The unwillingness of so many
even to consider that this is a real
question, a serious danger that we
face, is to me truly frightening.
Such unwillingness stems, no
doubt, from the desperate feeling
enunciated by the student whose
letter I've quoted: a fear of
repression, plus a conviction that
(as one student put it) "We are
running out of institutions that
will question our society just
when those challenges are badly
needed."
1 understand the fear and the
desperation, but to move from
these to a belief that human and
political survival will best be
served by turning the University
into a political instrument is, 1 am
deeply convinced, to confuse the
disease with its cure. It is like
many other panic reactions: those
in fear do just that thing which
will most certainly bring about
the fate they fear most.
Let me explain. Universities are
indeed, and to a unique degree,
the "institutions that will
question our society." Or any
other society, for that matter. The
mere continuing existence of a
real university serves to question
society. More than ever
before—because they occupy a
bigger share of the intellectual
terrain, so to speak—universities
are the prime centers of criticism.
Even the arts, which at their
best are among the most effective
critics of any society, are more
dependent upon the freedom and
support they find on a university
campus than in the past. You
would not have found very many
novelists, poets, sculptors,
playwrights, etc. in residence in
the universities of the earlier 2 0 th
Century. The very notion would
have seemed strange and exotic to
those much more limited and
parochial institutions.
But how long would such
freedom last, once it became clear
that universities were available
instruments for the promotion of
a particular brand of politics or
candidates? Why on earth should
we expect that a society full of
powerful and wealthy interest
groups will be willing to watch
without doing anything about it
while the diversity and openness
of the universities are abandoned
in favor of institutional
commitment and the production
"| of political propaganda?

Let me be specific. If the
universities allow themselves to be
captured by their politically most
active members, and used to
promote political purposes, one of
two things will quickly
happen—and probably both. One:
using the law already on the
books governing corporations
organized for educational
purposes, those who did not like
this turn of events would go to
court to get the universities' tax
exemption removed.
We could not survive at all, in
these days of massive deficits,
without tax exemption—both on
our own educational activities and
on the gifts people give us.
Perhaps the courts would save us.
But the law is pretty plain-spoken.
It defines a tax-exempt
educational corporation as, inter
alia, an institution "no substantial
part of the activities of which is
carrying on propaganda, or
otherwise attempting, to influence
legislation, and which does not
participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or
distributing of statements), any
political campaign on behalf of
any candidate for public office."
Second, and perhaps
simultaneously, efforts would be
made to enlist universities on the
side of political interests very

different from the political
interests that are most active and
prominent on the campus today.
There is nothing in the law of
nature that says a politicized
university must always be
politicized in favor of peace,
freedom, and equality. In a
contest for control of the
universities in which no holds are
barred—i.e., a contest that takes
place after we've abandoned the
whole idea of being a refuge for
all points of view, however
unpopular or even distasteful, and
have launched ourselves instead as
political institutions—who would
predict that the forces of
enlightenment and unselfishness
would prevail? As that veteran
socialist, Carl Landauer, said
recently, "The University cannot
at the same time be a forum for
the combat of ideas and a party in
that combat . . . Once the rule of
institutional neutrality was
abrogated, the political Right
would be more effective than the
Left in using the universities for
its own purposes."
Does this mean that the
University should resist all contact
with politics, except perhaps to
offer genteel seminars in "A
Theory of the Calculus of Voting"
or "The Transmission of Political
Values from Parent to Child." 1
believe not.
Of course the University's first
duty in relation to politics, as in
relation to anything else, is to
learn and teach more about the
subject. That learning, that
teaching, can and should take
place in a wide variety of ways
and at a number of different
levels.

There is no reason why
learning and teaching about
practical politics, or about acutely
contemporary problems of
political action, should not take
place in the University, provided
only that the game is played with
non-loaded dice. And students
who are serious about having an
impact upon the direction of
national policy had better be
serious about doing their
homework in advance.
How many students are serious
about having that impact?
There's no doubt that some
care profoundly, and spend their
energies without stint. But the
available evidence so far doesn't
suggest that these are very
numerous.
Last Spring, there was in the
county next-door to us a
Congressional primary contest
that appeared to have just about
every conceivable attraction for
large numbers of students, given
the circumstances of that
moment. The incumbent was
perhaps the leading "dove" in the
House of Representatives. It was
widely believed that if this
Congressman could survive the

contest for control of the
universities in which no holds are
barred—i.e., a contest that takes
place after we've abandoned the
whole idea of being a refuge for
all points of view, however
unpopular or even distasteful, and
have launched ourselves instead as
political institutions—who would
predict that the forces of
enlightenment and unselfishness
would prevail? As that veteran
socialist, Carl Landauer, said
recently, "The University cannot
at the same time be a forum for
the combat of ideas and a party in
that combat . . . Once the rule of
institutional neutrality was
abrogated, the political Right
would be more effective than the
Left in using the universities for
its own purposes."
Does this mean that the
University should resist all contact
with politics, except perhaps to
offer genteel seminars in "A
Theory of the Calculus of Voting"
or "The Transmission of Political
Values from Parent to Child." 1
believe not.
Of course the University's first
duty in relation to politics, as in
relation to anything else, is to
learn and teach more about the
subject. That learning, that
teaching, can and should take
place in a wide variety of ways
and at a number of different
levels.

There is no reason why
learning and teaching about
practical politics, or about acutely
contemporary problems of
political action, should not take
place in the University, provided
only that the game is played with
non-loaded dice. And students
who are serious about having an
impact upon the direction of
national policy had better be
serious about doing their
homework in advance.
How many students are serious
about having that impact?
There's no doubt that some
care profoundly, and spend their
energies without stint. But the
available evidence so far doesn't
suggest that these are very
numerous.
Last Spring, there was in the
county next-door to us a
Congressional primary contest
that appeared to have just about
every conceivable attraction for
large numbers of students, given
the circumstances of that
moment. The incumbent was
perhaps the leading "dove" in the
House of Representatives. It was
widely believed that if this
Congressman could survive the
Republican primary, where he was
opposed by a candidate of sharply
opposing views who was thought
to have much greater appeal to

party loyalists, vict y in the
November election was
overwhelmingly likely.
(
So the primary was important, <
the candidate was attractive to all <
but the most radical and most I
conservative students, and student <
help in the campaign was warmly -
welcomed. The Congressman won, >
and students, working on their I
own time and with no University 1
endorsement, helped significantly I
in achieving his victory. But the i
total number of Stanford students I
involved even to the extent of a |
single adventure in
precinct-walking was about 350, |
or three percent of the student 1
body. And only about 1 00 , or less <
than one percent, worked on any i
kind of sustained or continuous i
basis in that primary campaign. I
Much the same thing appears if '
you look at the situation 1
nationally. It may well be true '
that half the population of this j
country is now 25 years old or
less. But the median voting '
age—the average age of those who
actually get themselves to the
polls and pull the lever or mark
their "X' is 4 7 .
Furthermore, the indications
are—and long have been—clear
that younger people are less likely :
to vote than older people. In .
1968, the percentage of the
eligible population that voted was
only 33 percent for ages 18 to 20
(that is, where the voting age was
below 21, only 1 /3 of the
under-21 -year-olds took advantage
of the opportunity). It was 51
percent for those aged 21-24, as
against 7 2 percent for the great
armies of the middle-aged, those
aged 30 to 64. Even among
eligible voters over 64, which
would be bound to include
substantial numbers for whom
going to vote would be quite a
chore, (he percentage was just
twice as good as for the
under-21 's.
Obviously there are lots of
things one would wish to know
before making too much out of
such facts and figures. But even at
first glance they suggest that, for
whatever reasons, your own age
group doesn't for the most part
even seize the threshold
opportunity for political
involvement—the right to work
and vote in elections.
You are accustomed to
challenging the institutions of our
society, mostly run by your
elders, to commit themselves to
change. I'd like, with all due
respect to the amount that young
people have accomplished in
American politics, from
Alexander Hamilton to Julian
Bond, to challenge you to make

the youth movement in
American political life something
more durable, more constructive
and more significant than the
headline-hunting antics of
Weathermen and Yippies.
Some will tell you that this
would be a waste of time, that the
system won't respond—perhaps
even that it is now so moribund
thai it can't respond. But as
Henry Fairlie once wrote: "The
worst and best thing about
politicians is that they are
representative of the people who
elect them."
The fact today is that the
system is responding, but the
people to whom it is responding
are not for the most part those
who want withdrawal from
Vietnam now, an environmental
cleanup now, and greater
attention to the problems of
poverty now; it is responding to
the great and growing number
who are demanding law and order,
fewer constraints upon the police,
and a crackdown on youthful
protest the moment it departs
from strictest standards of
decorum.
It may just be that you have
entered the University at a
moment in history when, on top
of everything else, its body is
being fought over and its soul
imperilled. If, in the agony of our
time, freedom and diversity on
the campus are thought to be
luxiries we can no longer afford,
there will soon be no universities
worthy of the name. If the
political voice of youth is to be
the voice of the Wisconsin
bombers, nihilism and despair will
be the only winners. If every
attempt, no matter how careful,
to stem the tide of violence and
hatred here at home is met by
cries of "Repression!," or by
indifference born of disgust at the
violence abroad, we shall deserve
our grim fate—and we'll carry
along with us millions of people
elsewhere in the world who don't
deserve it. There's something
particularly contemptible about
academic apologists for violence.
As an English commentator
remarked several years ago, "Calls
for more excitement, unreason,
violence and danger naturally tend
to come from people who live
relatively sheltered lives, measured
by examinations and
promotions."
You came here for many
purposes, in many moods and
with diverse expectations. Some
of you will feel almost
immediately that these are,
indeed, the best years of your
lives, despite our troubles; some
others of you will find little or
nothing to your liking here. Most
of you will probably find
yourselves somewhere in between,
baffled at times by complexity
and rapid change and strident
challenges on all sides, but
fulfilled at times by the sheer
excitement of learning how to
learn, and how to act on the basis
of learning.
For all but a few of you,
politics, even in the broadest
sense, will be only a part of life
and learning. I've taken the risk of
distorting your initial picture of
Stanford bv limiting myself to
this subject, and also by telling
you several things you may not
very much wish to hear. You have
a right to be told things you do
not wish to hear, and beware of
anyone who speaks only to truths
you already know, or prejudices
you already share. I've no doubt
that you'll do your share of
talking back; and that, also, is as
should be.

Your own age group doesn't for-the most pert even seize
the threshold opportunity for political involvement-the
right to work and vote in elections.
I'd like to challenge you to make of the youth
movement in American political life something more

Following are excerpts from
remarks prepared for delivery by
President Richard W. Lyman at
Freshman Convocation Sept. 25,
1970.
You enter college at a time
when there is less certainty about
what higher education means or
ought to mean than ever in living
memory. There are more doubts
in the minds of students as to
their own purposes, as well as
those of the institutions they
attend, than ever.
And, as usual when everyone is
uncertain, everyone shouts louder.
The poet, Karl Shapiro, no doubt
exaggerated when he said earlier
this year: "It appears that the
modern student enters the
university with a contempt for the
university, a contempt for society,
a contempt for literature, and a
contempt for himself."
But so, surely, are those
middle-aged idolators of youth
exaggerating, who picture the
college student of today as the
first human being ever to
recognize the possibility of
leading a virtuous life, and to act
on the basis of that discovery. We
are, almost all of us, a lot less sure
of ourselves, a lot less confident

that we have the world figured
out, than we allow ourselves to
appear. That, at any rate, ought to
be a common bond, and a source
of comfort to you as you try to
mak<* sense of the university, and
your place in it . . .
Clearly, politics and its relation
to the University is a hot topic.
That might be reason enough to
discuss it, but there are further
reasons as well. It raises questions
that have to be faced now, they
cannot be put off. And they are
questions that cannot really be
fudged. So we may as well try to
understand one another about
them.
In a statement issued this past
summer I tried to make clear

distinction between political
activity on the part of individuals
or groups of individuals at
Stanford on the one hand, and, on
the other, political activity that
makes use of the University's
resources—whether telephones,
Xerox machines, or rent-free
office space—or conveys a clear
connotation of official University
involvement, such as writing
"Why 1 love Governor Jess
Reagan" letters on Stanford
letterhead. Like many statements
of policy, it represents an attempt
to resolve a dilemma.
One horn of this dilemma is
this: many of us believe that if the
United States is to survive—if we
are to survive as human beings on
this planet—the quality of
American political life must
improve, drastically and quickly.

By this I mean several things,
among them the following:
Attention to major issues of
survival must increase, and
preoccupation with trivial issues
decrease; ways of seeking and
achieving change through the
political system must be opened
up and clarified, so that they
really do exist and people can see
that they exist; the general level
of involvement in politics on the
part of millions of people who are
not professional politicians must
rise dramatically, and stay risen.
It's not enough to get excited
when the headlines of some fresh
disaster stir one's metabolism; the
involvement has to be steady and
unremitting, patient but
relentless.

The terrible grip of private
selfishness, not just on the part of
major corporations but among
everyday tax-paying (or
tax-resisting) citizens, must give
way to a sharply increased
readiness to see money change
hands and power relationships
alter so that urgent public
questions, such as racial equality
and environmental protection, can
be dealt with.
All this and much more must
happen. To say that it must
happen is not to denigrate all
previous generations of
Americans, nor all present
politicians; it is merely to say that
the problems that must be
resolved politically today are
unprecedentedly serious and
difficult, and therefore are not
likely to yield to further doses of
the mixture-as-before.
Clearly college students and
other university people must help
to accomplish the needed changes.
If they don't, no one else
will—not because they are
uniquely virtuous—but simply
because university people ought
to be among the people most
sensitive to the tragic condition of
the world today, and best able, by
reason of their abilities and their
opportunities, to do something
about it.

All of that is on one horn of
the dilemma. On the other is the
very real question of protecting
the University itself against
becoming thoroughly politicized
and therefore no longer free.
The unwillingness of so many
even to consider that this is a real
question, a serious danger that we
face, is to me truly frightening.
Such unwillingness stems, no
doubt, from the desperate feeling
enunciated by the student whose
letter I've quoted: a fear of
repression, plus a conviction that
(as one student put it) "We are
running out of institutions that
will question our society just
when those challenges are badly
needed."
1 understand the fear and the
desperation, but to move from
these to a belief that human and
political survival will best be
served by turning the University
into a political instrument is, 1 am
deeply convinced, to confuse the
disease with its cure. It is like
many other panic reactions: those
in fear do just that thing which
will most certainly bring about
the fate they fear most.
Let me explain. Universities are
indeed, and to a unique degree,
the "institutions that will
question our society." Or any
other society, for that matter. The
mere continuing existence of a
real university serves to question
society. More than ever
before—because they occupy a
bigger share of the intellectual
terrain, so to speak—universities
are the prime centers of criticism.
Even the arts, which at their
best are among the most effective
critics of any society, are more
dependent upon the freedom and
support they find on a university
campus than in the past. You
would not have found very many
novelists, poets, sculptors,
playwrights, etc. in residence in
the universities of the earlier 2 0 th
Century. The very notion would
have seemed strange and exotic to
those much more limited and
parochial institutions.
But how long would such
freedom last, once it became clear
that universities were available
instruments for the promotion of
a particular brand of politics or
candidates? Why on earth should
we expect that a society full of
powerful and wealthy interest
groups will be willing to watch
without doing anything about it
while the diversity and openness
of the universities are abandoned
in favor of institutional
commitment and the production
"| of political propaganda?

Let me be specific. If the
universities allow themselves to be
captured by their politically most
active members, and used to
promote political purposes, one of
two things will quickly
happen—and probably both. One:
using the law already on the
books governing corporations
organized for educational
purposes, those who did not like
this turn of events would go to
court to get the universities' tax
exemption removed.
We could not survive at all, in
these days of massive deficits,
without tax exemption—both on
our own educational activities and
on the gifts people give us.
Perhaps the courts would save us.
But the law is pretty plain-spoken.
It defines a tax-exempt
educational corporation as, inter
alia, an institution "no substantial
part of the activities of which is
carrying on propaganda, or
otherwise attempting, to influence
legislation, and which does not
participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or
distributing of statements), any
political campaign on behalf of
any candidate for public office."
Second, and perhaps
simultaneously, efforts would be
made to enlist universities on the
side of political interests very

different from the political
interests that are most active and
prominent on the campus today.
There is nothing in the law of
nature that says a politicized
university must always be
politicized in favor of peace,
freedom, and equality. In a
contest for control of the
universities in which no holds are
barred—i.e., a contest that takes
place after we've abandoned the
whole idea of being a refuge for
all points of view, however
unpopular or even distasteful, and
have launched ourselves instead as
political institutions—who would
predict that the forces of
enlightenment and unselfishness
would prevail? As that veteran
socialist, Carl Landauer, said
recently, "The University cannot
at the same time be a forum for
the combat of ideas and a party in
that combat . . . Once the rule of
institutional neutrality was
abrogated, the political Right
would be more effective than the
Left in using the universities for
its own purposes."
Does this mean that the
University should resist all contact
with politics, except perhaps to
offer genteel seminars in "A
Theory of the Calculus of Voting"
or "The Transmission of Political
Values from Parent to Child." 1
believe not.
Of course the University's first
duty in relation to politics, as in
relation to anything else, is to
learn and teach more about the
subject. That learning, that
teaching, can and should take
place in a wide variety of ways
and at a number of different
levels.

There is no reason why
learning and teaching about
practical politics, or about acutely
contemporary problems of
political action, should not take
place in the University, provided
only that the game is played with
non-loaded dice. And students
who are serious about having an
impact upon the direction of
national policy had better be
serious about doing their
homework in advance.
How many students are serious
about having that impact?
There's no doubt that some
care profoundly, and spend their
energies without stint. But the
available evidence so far doesn't
suggest that these are very
numerous.

But how long would such
freedom last, once it became clear
that universities were available
instruments for the promotion of
a particular brand of politics or
candidates? Why on earth should
we expect that a society full of
powerful and wealthy interest
groups will be willing to watch
without doing anything about it
while the diversity and openness
of the universities are abandoned
in favor of institutional
commitment and the production
"| of political propaganda?

Let me be specific. If the
universities allow themselves to be
captured by their politically most
active members, and used to
promote political purposes, one of
two things will quickly
happen—and probably both. One:
using the law already on the
books governing corporations
organized for educational
purposes, those who did not like
this turn of events would go to
court to get the universities' tax
exemption removed.
We could not survive at all, in
these days of massive deficits,
without tax exemption—both on
our own educational activities and
on the gifts people give us.
Perhaps the courts would save us.
But the law is pretty plain-spoken.
It defines a tax-exempt
educational corporation as, inter
alia, an institution "no substantial
part of the activities of which is
carrying on propaganda, or
otherwise attempting, to influence
legislation, and which does not
participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or
distributing of statements), any
political campaign on behalf of
any candidate for public office."
Second, and perhaps
simultaneously, efforts would be
made to enlist universities on the
side of political interests very

different from the political
interests that are most active and
prominent on the campus today.
There is nothing in the law of
nature that says a politicized
university must always be
politicized in favor of peace,
freedom, and equality. In a
contest for control of the
universities in which no holds are
barred—i.e., a contest that takes
place after we've abandoned the
whole idea of being a refuge for
all points of view, however
unpopular or even distasteful, and
have launched ourselves instead as
political institutions—who would
predict that the forces of
enlightenment and unselfishness
would prevail? As that veteran
socialist, Carl Landauer, said
recently, "The University cannot
at the same time be a forum for
the combat of ideas and a party in
that combat . . . Once the rule of
institutional neutrality was
abrogated, the political Right
would be more effective than the
Left in using the universities for
its own purposes."
Does this mean that the
University should resist all contact
with politics, except perhaps to
offer genteel seminars in "A
Theory of the Calculus of Voting"
or "The Transmission of Political
Values from Parent to Child." 1
believe not.
Of course the University's first
duty in relation to politics, as in
relation to anything else, is to
learn and teach more about the
subject. That learning, that
teaching, can and should take
place in a wide variety of ways
and at a number of different
levels.

There is no reason why
learning and teaching about
practical politics, or about acutely
contemporary problems of
political action, should not take
place in the University, provided
only that the game is played with
non-loaded dice. And students
who are serious about having an
impact upon the direction of
national policy had better be
serious about doing their
homework in advance.
How many students are serious
about having that impact?
There's no doubt that some
care profoundly, and spend their
energies without stint. But the
available evidence so far doesn't
suggest that these are very
numerous.
Last Spring, there was in the
county next-door to us a
Congressional primary contest
that appeared to have just about
every conceivable attraction for
large numbers of students, given
the circumstances of that
moment. The incumbent was
perhaps the leading "dove" in the
House of Representatives. It was
widely believed that if this
Congressman could survive the
Republican primary, where he was
opposed by a candidate of sharply
opposing views who was thought
to have much greater appeal to

party loyalists, vict y in the
November election was
overwhelmingly likely.
(
So the primary was important, <
the candidate was attractive to all <
but the most radical and most I
conservative students, and student <
help in the campaign was warmly -
welcomed. The Congressman won, >
and students, working on their I
own time and with no University 1
endorsement, helped significantly I
in achieving his victory. But the i
total number of Stanford students I
involved even to the extent of a |
single adventure in
precinct-walking was about 350, |
or three percent of the student 1
body. And only about 1 00 , or less <
than one percent, worked on any i
kind of sustained or continuous i
basis in that primary campaign. I
Much the same thing appears if '
you look at the situation 1
nationally. It may well be true '
that half the population of this j
country is now 25 years old or
less. But the median voting '
age—the average age of those who
actually get themselves to the
polls and pull the lever or mark
their "X' is 4 7 .
Furthermore, the indications
are—and long have been—clear
that younger people are less likely :
to vote than older people. In .
1968, the percentage of the
eligible population that voted was
only 33 percent for ages 18 to 20
(that is, where the voting age was
below 21, only 1 /3 of the
under-21 -year-olds took advantage
of the opportunity). It was 51
percent for those aged 21-24, as
against 7 2 percent for the great
armies of the middle-aged, those
aged 30 to 64. Even among
eligible voters over 64, which
would be bound to include
substantial numbers for whom
going to vote would be quite a
chore, (he percentage was just
twice as good as for the
under-21 's.
Obviously there are lots of
things one would wish to know
before making too much out of
such facts and figures. But even at
first glance they suggest that, for
whatever reasons, your own age
group doesn't for the most part
even seize the threshold
opportunity for political
involvement—the right to work
and vote in elections.
You are accustomed to
challenging the institutions of our
society, mostly run by your
elders, to commit themselves to
change. I'd like, with all due
respect to the amount that young
people have accomplished in
American politics, from
Alexander Hamilton to Julian
Bond, to challenge you to make

the youth movement in
American political life something
more durable, more constructive
and more significant than the
headline-hunting antics of
Weathermen and Yippies.
Some will tell you that this
would be a waste of time, that the
system won't respond—perhaps
even that it is now so moribund
thai it can't respond. But as
Henry Fairlie once wrote: "The
worst and best thing about
politicians is that they are
representative of the people who
elect them."
The fact today is that the
system is responding, but the
people to whom it is responding
are not for the most part those
who want withdrawal from
Vietnam now, an environmental
cleanup now, and greater
attention to the problems of
poverty now; it is responding to
the great and growing number
who are demanding law and order,
fewer constraints upon the police,
and a crackdown on youthful
protest the moment it departs
from strictest standards of
decorum.
It may just be that you have
entered the University at a
moment in history when, on top
of everything else, its body is
being fought over and its soul
imperilled. If, in the agony of our
time, freedom and diversity on
the campus are thought to be
luxiries we can no longer afford,
there will soon be no universities
worthy of the name. If the
political voice of youth is to be
the voice of the Wisconsin
bombers, nihilism and despair will
be the only winners. If every
attempt, no matter how careful,
to stem the tide of violence and
hatred here at home is met by
cries of "Repression!," or by
indifference born of disgust at the
violence abroad, we shall deserve
our grim fate—and we'll carry
along with us millions of people
elsewhere in the world who don't
deserve it. There's something
particularly contemptible about
academic apologists for violence.
As an English commentator
remarked several years ago, "Calls
for more excitement, unreason,
violence and danger naturally tend
to come from people who live
relatively sheltered lives, measured
by examinations and
promotions."
You came here for many
purposes, in many moods and
with diverse expectations. Some
of you will feel almost
immediately that these are,
indeed, the best years of your
lives, despite our troubles; some
others of you will find little or
nothing to your liking here. Most
of you will probably find
yourselves somewhere in between,
baffled at times by complexity
and rapid change and strident
challenges on all sides, but
fulfilled at times by the sheer
excitement of learning how to
learn, and how to act on the basis
of learning.
For all but a few of you,
politics, even in the broadest
sense, will be only a part of life
and learning. I've taken the risk of
distorting your initial picture of
Stanford bv limiting myself to
this subject, and also by telling
you several things you may not
very much wish to hear. You have
a right to be told things you do
not wish to hear, and beware of
anyone who speaks only to truths
you already know, or prejudices
you already share. I've no doubt
that you'll do your share of
talking back; and that, also, is as
should be.

Your own age group doesn't for-the most pert even seize
the threshold opportunity for political involvement-the
right to work and vote in elections.
I'd like to challenge you to make of the youth
movement in American political life something more
durable, more constructive and more significant than

Following are excerpts from
remarks prepared for delivery by
President Richard W. Lyman at
Freshman Convocation Sept. 25,
1970.
You enter college at a time
when there is less certainty about
what higher education means or
ought to mean than ever in living
memory. There are more doubts
in the minds of students as to
their own purposes, as well as
those of the institutions they
attend, than ever.
And, as usual when everyone is
uncertain, everyone shouts louder.
The poet, Karl Shapiro, no doubt
exaggerated when he said earlier
this year: "It appears that the
modern student enters the
university with a contempt for the
university, a contempt for society,
a contempt for literature, and a
contempt for himself."
But so, surely, are those
middle-aged idolators of youth
exaggerating, who picture the
college student of today as the
first human being ever to
recognize the possibility of
leading a virtuous life, and to act
on the basis of that discovery. We
are, almost all of us, a lot less sure
of ourselves, a lot less confident

that we have the world figured
out, than we allow ourselves to
appear. That, at any rate, ought to
be a common bond, and a source
of comfort to you as you try to
mak<* sense of the university, and
your place in it . . .
Clearly, politics and its relation
to the University is a hot topic.
That might be reason enough to
discuss it, but there are further
reasons as well. It raises questions
that have to be faced now, they
cannot be put off. And they are
questions that cannot really be
fudged. So we may as well try to
understand one another about
them.
In a statement issued this past
summer I tried to make clear

distinction between political
activity on the part of individuals
or groups of individuals at
Stanford on the one hand, and, on
the other, political activity that
makes use of the University's
resources—whether telephones,
Xerox machines, or rent-free
office space—or conveys a clear
connotation of official University
involvement, such as writing
"Why 1 love Governor Jess
Reagan" letters on Stanford
letterhead. Like many statements
of policy, it represents an attempt
to resolve a dilemma.
One horn of this dilemma is
this: many of us believe that if the
United States is to survive—if we
are to survive as human beings on
this planet—the quality of
American political life must
improve, drastically and quickly.

By this I mean several things,
among them the following:
Attention to major issues of
survival must increase, and
preoccupation with trivial issues
decrease; ways of seeking and
achieving change through the
political system must be opened
up and clarified, so that they
really do exist and people can see
that they exist; the general level
of involvement in politics on the
part of millions of people who are
not professional politicians must
rise dramatically, and stay risen.
It's not enough to get excited
when the headlines of some fresh
disaster stir one's metabolism; the
involvement has to be steady and
unremitting, patient but
relentless.

The terrible grip of private
selfishness, not just on the part of
major corporations but among
everyday tax-paying (or
tax-resisting) citizens, must give
way to a sharply increased
readiness to see money change
hands and power relationships
alter so that urgent public
questions, such as racial equality
and environmental protection, can
be dealt with.
All this and much more must
happen. To say that it must
happen is not to denigrate all
previous generations of
Americans, nor all present
politicians; it is merely to say that
the problems that must be
resolved politically today are
unprecedentedly serious and
difficult, and therefore are not
likely to yield to further doses of
the mixture-as-before.
Clearly college students and
other university people must help
to accomplish the needed changes.
If they don't, no one else
will—not because they are
uniquely virtuous—but simply
because university people ought
to be among the people most
sensitive to the tragic condition of
the world today, and best able, by
reason of their abilities and their
opportunities, to do something
about it.

All of that is on one horn of
the dilemma. On the other is the
very real question of protecting
the University itself against
becoming thoroughly politicized
and therefore no longer free.
The unwillingness of so many
even to consider that this is a real
question, a serious danger that we
face, is to me truly frightening.
Such unwillingness stems, no
doubt, from the desperate feeling
enunciated by the student whose
letter I've quoted: a fear of
repression, plus a conviction that
(as one student put it) "We are
running out of institutions that
will question our society just
when those challenges are badly
needed."
1 understand the fear and the
desperation, but to move from
these to a belief that human and
political survival will best be
served by turning the University
into a political instrument is, 1 am
deeply convinced, to confuse the
disease with its cure. It is like
many other panic reactions: those
in fear do just that thing which
will most certainly bring about
the fate they fear most.
Let me explain. Universities are
indeed, and to a unique degree,
the "institutions that will
question our society." Or any
other society, for that matter. The
mere continuing existence of a
real university serves to question
society. More than ever
before—because they occupy a
bigger share of the intellectual
terrain, so to speak—universities
are the prime centers of criticism.
Even the arts, which at their
best are among the most effective
critics of any society, are more
dependent upon the freedom and
support they find on a university
campus than in the past. You
would not have found very many
novelists, poets, sculptors,
playwrights, etc. in residence in
the universities of the earlier 2 0 th
Century. The very notion would
have seemed strange and exotic to
those much more limited and
parochial institutions.
But how long would such
freedom last, once it became clear
that universities were available
instruments for the promotion of
a particular brand of politics or
candidates? Why on earth should
we expect that a society full of
powerful and wealthy interest
groups will be willing to watch
without doing anything about it
while the diversity and openness
of the universities are abandoned
in favor of institutional
commitment and the production
"| of political propaganda?

Let me be specific. If the
universities allow themselves to be
captured by their politically most
active members, and used to

two things will quickly
