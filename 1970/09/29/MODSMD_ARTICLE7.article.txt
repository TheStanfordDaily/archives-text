# Scranton Commission Lists Campus Recommendations

### 
(The following article
contains excerpts from the
report of the Scranton
Commission on Campus
Unrest.)
Every university must improve
its capability for responding
effectively to disorder. Students,
faculty, and trustees must support
these efforts. Universities must
pull themselves together.
The university should be an
open forum where speakers of
every point of view can be heard.
The area of permitted speech and
conduct should be at least as
broad as that protected by the
First Amendment.
The university should
promulgate a code making clear
the limits of permitted conduct
and announce in advance what
measures it is willing to employ in
response to impermissible
conduct. It should strengthen its
disciplinary process. It should
assess the capabilities of its
security force and determine what
role, if any, that force should play
in responding to disorder.
Campus Violence
When criminal violence occurs
on the campus, university officials
should promptly call for the
assistance of law enforcement
agencies. When faced with
disruptive but nonviolent
conduct, the university should be
prepared to respond initially with
internal measures. It must clearly
understand the options available
to it and be prepared to move
from one to another if it is
reasonably obvious that an earlier
tactic has failed.
Faculty members who engage
in or lead disruptive conduct have
no place in the university
community.
The university, and particularly
the faculty, must recognize that
the expansion of higher education
and the emergence of the new
youth culture have changed the
makeup and concerns of today's
student population. The
university should adapt itself to
these new conditions. We urge
that the university make its
teaching programs, degree
structure, and transfer and leave
policies more flexible and more
varied in order to enhance the
quality and voluntariness of
university study.
We call upon all members of
the university to reaffirm that the
proper functions of the university
are teaching and learning, research
and scholarship. An academic
community best serves itself, the
country, and every principle to
which it is devoted by
concentrating on these tasks.
Academic Freedom
Academic institutions must be
free—from outside interference
and free from internal
intimidation. Far too many
people who should know
better—both within university
communities and outside them -
have forgotten this first principle
of academic freedom. The pursuit
of knowledge cannot continue
without the free exchange of
ideas.
Obviously, all members of the
academic community, as
individuals, should be free to
participate actively in whatever
campaigns or causes they choose.
But universities as institutions
must remain politically neutral,
except in those rare cases in which

their own integrity, educational
purpose or preservation are at
stake.
Faculty Commitments
One of the most valid
criticisms of many universities is
that their faculties have become
so involved in outside research
that their commitment to
teaching seems compromised. We
urge universities and faculty
members to reduce their outside
service commitments. We
recognize that alternative sources
of university funding will have to
be developed to take the place of
the money attached to these
outside commitments.
Realistically, this will mean more
unrestricted government aid to
higher education.
University Goverance
Large universities should take
steps to decentralize or reorganize
to make possible a more human
scale.
University governance systems
should be reformed to increase
participation of students and
faculty in the formulation of
university policies that affect
them. But universities cannot be
run on a one-man, one-vote basis
with participation of all members
on all issues.
Universities must become true
communities whose members
share a sense of respect, tolerance,
and responsibility for one
another.
Students
Students must accept the
responsibility of presenting their
ideas in a reasonable and
persuasive manner. They must
recognize that they are citizens of
a nation which was founded on
tolerance and diversity, and they
must become more understanding
of those with whom they differ.
Students must protect the right
of all speakers to be heard even
when they disagree with the point
of view expressed. Heckling
speakers is not only bad manners
but is inimical to all the values
that a university stands for.

Students must face the fact
that giving moral support to those
who are planning violent action is
morally desspicable.
Students should be reminded
that language that offends will
seldom persuade. Their words
have sometimes been as offensive
to many Americans as the words
of some public officials have been
to them.
Students should not expect
their own views, even if held with
great moral intensity,
automatically and immediately to
determine national policy. The
rhetorical commitment to
democracy by students must be
matched by an awareness of the
central role of majority rule in a
democratic society and by an
equal commitment to techniques
of persuasion within the political
process.
Youth's Obligations
The commission has been
impressed and moved by the
idealism and commitment of
American youth. But this
extraordinary commitment brings
with it extraordinary obligations:
to learn from our nation's past
experience, to recognize the
humanity of those with whom
they disagree and to maintain
their respect for the rule of law.
The fight for change and
justice is the good fight; to drop
out or strike out at the first sign
of failure is to insure that change
will never come.
This commission is only too
aware of America's shortcomings.
Yet we are almost a nation of
enduring strength. Millions of
Americans—generations past and
present — have given their vision,
their energy, and their patient
labor to make us a more just
nation and a more human people.
We who seek to change
America today build on their
accomplishments and enjoy the
freedoms they won for us. It is a
considerable inheritance, we must
not squander or destroy it.

to make possible a more human
scale.
University governance systems
should be reformed to increase
participation of students and
faculty in the formulation of
university policies that affect
them. But universities cannot be
run on a one-man, one-vote basis
with participation of all members
on all issues.
Universities must become true
communities whose members
share a sense of respect, tolerance,
and responsibility for one
another.
Students
Students must accept the
responsibility of presenting their
ideas in a reasonable and
persuasive manner. They must
recognize that they are citizens of
a nation which was founded on
tolerance and diversity, and they
must become more understanding
of those with whom they differ.
Students must protect the right
of all speakers to be heard even
when they disagree with the point
of view expressed. Heckling
speakers is not only bad manners
but is inimical to all the values
that a university stands for.

Students must face the fact
that giving moral support to those
who are planning violent action is
morally desspicable.
Students should be reminded
that language that offends will
seldom persuade. Their words
have sometimes been as offensive
to many Americans as the words
of some public officials have been
to them.
Students should not expect
their own views, even if held with
great moral intensity,
automatically and immediately to
determine national policy. The
rhetorical commitment to
democracy by students must be
matched by an awareness of the
central role of majority rule in a
democratic society and by an
equal commitment to techniques
of persuasion within the political
process.
Youth's Obligations
The commission has been
impressed and moved by the
idealism and commitment of
American youth. But this
extraordinary commitment brings
with it extraordinary obligations:
to learn from our nation's past
experience, to recognize the
humanity of those with whom
they disagree and to maintain
their respect for the rule of law.
The fight for change and
justice is the good fight; to drop
out or strike out at the first sign
of failure is to insure that change
will never come.
This commission is only too
aware of America's shortcomings.
Yet we are almost a nation of
enduring strength. Millions of
Americans—generations past and
present — have given their vision,
their energy, and their patient
labor to make us a more just
nation and a more human people.
We who seek to change
America today build on their
accomplishments and enjoy the
freedoms they won for us. It is a
considerable inheritance, we must
not squander or destroy it.
(The following article
contains excerpts from the
report of the Scranton
Commission on Campus
Unrest.)
Every university must improve
its capability for responding
effectively to disorder. Students,
faculty, and trustees must support
these efforts. Universities must
pull themselves together.
The university should be an
open forum where speakers of
every point of view can be heard.
The area of permitted speech and
conduct should be at least as
broad as that protected by the
First Amendment.
The university should
promulgate a code making clear
the limits of permitted conduct
and announce in advance what
measures it is willing to employ in
response to impermissible
conduct. It should strengthen its
disciplinary process. It should
assess the capabilities of its
security force and determine what
role, if any, that force should play
in responding to disorder.
Campus Violence
When criminal violence occurs
on the campus, university officials
should promptly call for the
assistance of law enforcement
agencies. When faced with
disruptive but nonviolent
conduct, the university should be
prepared to respond initially with
internal measures. It must clearly
understand the options available
to it and be prepared to move
from one to another if it is
reasonably obvious that an earlier
tactic has failed.
Faculty members who engage
in or lead disruptive conduct have
no place in the university
community.
The university, and particularly
the faculty, must recognize that
the expansion of higher education
and the emergence of the new
youth culture have changed the
makeup and concerns of today's
student population. The
university should adapt itself to
these new conditions. We urge
that the university make its
teaching programs, degree
structure, and transfer and leave
policies more flexible and more
varied in order to enhance the
quality and voluntariness of
university study.
We call upon all members of
the university to reaffirm that the
proper functions of the university
are teaching and learning, research
and scholarship. An academic
community best serves itself, the
country, and every principle to
which it is devoted by
concentrating on these tasks.
Academic Freedom
Academic institutions must be
free—from outside interference
and free from internal
intimidation. Far too many
people who should know
better—both within university
communities and outside them -
have forgotten this first principle
of academic freedom. The pursuit
of knowledge cannot continue
without the free exchange of
ideas.
Obviously, all members of the
academic community, as
individuals, should be free to
participate actively in whatever
campaigns or causes they choose.
But universities as institutions
must remain politically neutral,
except in those rare cases in which

their own integrity, educational
purpose or preservation are at
stake.
Faculty Commitments
One of the most valid
criticisms of many universities is
that their faculties have become
so involved in outside research
that their commitment to
teaching seems compromised. We
urge universities and faculty
members to reduce their outside
service commitments. We
recognize that alternative sources
of university funding will have to
be developed to take the place of
the money attached to these
outside commitments.
Realistically, this will mean more
unrestricted government aid to
higher education.
University Goverance
Large universities should take

scale.

disciplinary process. It should
assess the capabilities of its
security force and determine what
role, if any, that force should play
in responding to disorder.
Campus Violence
When criminal violence occurs
on the campus, university officials
should promptly call for the
assistance of law enforcement
agencies. When faced with
disruptive but nonviolent
conduct, the university should be
prepared to respond initially with
internal measures. It must clearly
understand the options available
to it and be prepared to move
from one to another if it is
reasonably obvious that an earlier
tactic has failed.
Faculty members who engage
in or lead disruptive conduct have
no place in the university
community.
The university, and particularly
the faculty, must recognize that
the expansion of higher education
and the emergence of the new
youth culture have changed the
makeup and concerns of today's
student population. The
university should adapt itself to
these new conditions. We urge
that the university make its
teaching programs, degree
structure, and transfer and leave
policies more flexible and more
varied in order to enhance the
quality and voluntariness of
university study.
We call upon all members of
the university to reaffirm that the
proper functions of the university
are teaching and learning, research
and scholarship. An academic
community best serves itself, the
country, and every principle to
which it is devoted by
concentrating on these tasks.
Academic Freedom
Academic institutions must be
free—from outside interference
and free from internal
intimidation. Far too many
people who should know
better—both within university
communities and outside them -
have forgotten this first principle
of academic freedom. The pursuit
of knowledge cannot continue
without the free exchange of
ideas.
Obviously, all members of the
academic community, as
individuals, should be free to
participate actively in whatever
campaigns or causes they choose.
But universities as institutions
must remain politically neutral,
except in those rare cases in which

their own integrity, educational
purpose or preservation are at
stake.
Faculty Commitments
One of the most valid
criticisms of many universities is
that their faculties have become
so involved in outside research
that their commitment to
teaching seems compromised. We
urge universities and faculty
members to reduce their outside
service commitments. We
recognize that alternative sources
of university funding will have to
be developed to take the place of
the money attached to these
outside commitments.
Realistically, this will mean more
unrestricted government aid to
higher education.
University Goverance
Large universities should take
steps to decentralize or reorganize
to make possible a more human
scale.
University governance systems
should be reformed to increase
participation of students and
faculty in the formulation of
university policies that affect
them. But universities cannot be
run on a one-man, one-vote basis
with participation of all members
on all issues.
Universities must become true
communities whose members
share a sense of respect, tolerance,
and responsibility for one
another.
Students
Students must accept the
responsibility of presenting their
ideas in a reasonable and
persuasive manner. They must
recognize that they are citizens of
a nation which was founded on
tolerance and diversity, and they
must become more understanding
of those with whom they differ.
Students must protect the right
of all speakers to be heard even
when they disagree with the point
of view expressed. Heckling
speakers is not only bad manners
but is inimical to all the values
that a university stands for.

Students must face the fact
that giving moral support to those
who are planning violent action is
morally desspicable.
Students should be reminded
that language that offends will
seldom persuade. Their words
have sometimes been as offensive
to many Americans as the words
of some public officials have been
to them.
Students should not expect
their own views, even if held with
great moral intensity,
automatically and immediately to
determine national policy. The
rhetorical commitment to
democracy by students must be
matched by an awareness of the
central role of majority rule in a
democratic society and by an
equal commitment to techniques
of persuasion within the political
process.
Youth's Obligations
The commission has been
impressed and moved by the
idealism and commitment of
American youth. But this
extraordinary commitment brings
with it extraordinary obligations:
to learn from our nation's past
experience, to recognize the
humanity of those with whom
they disagree and to maintain
their respect for the rule of law.
The fight for change and
justice is the good fight; to drop
out or strike out at the first sign
of failure is to insure that change
will never come.
This commission is only too
aware of America's shortcomings.
Yet we are almost a nation of
enduring strength. Millions of
Americans—generations past and
present — have given their vision,
their energy, and their patient
labor to make us a more just
nation and a more human people.
We who seek to change
America today build on their
accomplishments and enjoy the
freedoms they won for us. It is a
considerable inheritance, we must
not squander or destroy it.
(The following article
contains excerpts from the
report of the Scranton
Commission on Campus
Unrest.)
Every university must improve
its capability for responding
effectively to disorder. Students,
faculty, and trustees must support
these efforts. Universities must
pull themselves together.
The university should be an
open forum where speakers of
every point of view can be heard.
The area of permitted speech and
conduct should be at least as
broad as that protected by the
First Amendment.
The university should
promulgate a code making clear
the limits of permitted conduct
and announce in advance what
measures it is willing to employ in
response to impermissible
conduct. It should strengthen its
disciplinary process. It should
assess the capabilities of its
security force and determine what
role, if any, that force should play
in responding to disorder.
