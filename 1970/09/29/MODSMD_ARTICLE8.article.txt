Editor, The Daily:
Don't pay the $3.00 ASSU
fees. The Dean of Students has
temporarily put a halt to this
illegal tax and stated that you can
get a tuition deferment for the
ASSU charge. It remains to be
decided this quarter by the
students whether or not this
ASSU thievery can be forced on
all. $38,000 of your money will
be taken this quarter for the
ASSU's use and we can fight it
NOW by not paying it at
registration. You can register for
school without paying this
compulsory fee, so DON'T PAY
IT. Keep the money and the
power where it belongs • with the
students, not ASSU.
