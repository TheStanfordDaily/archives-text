HYPNOSIS WORKSHOP is a privately owned school of self- I
hypnosis. We offer a seven-week course (one hour instruc- I
tion a week), teaching you how to hypnotize yourself, show- I
ing you how to do various hypnotic phenomena, such as:
—Learning to relax deeply and quickly, as completely H
as while asleep.
—Learning to increase your ability to concentrate, by I
focusing your attention completely and tuning out I
irrelevant stimulii.
—Reducing or eliminating pain. This potential is I
already used extensively in dentistry and childbirth. I
—Remembering and actually reliving past events. In I
reliving past events, you can experience them emo- I
tionally and with all five senses, in a vivid hypnotic I
dream.
—Learning to give yourself useful post hypnotic sug- I
gestions.
—Learning to produce altered states of consciousness, I
(including the ability to enhance meditation states, H
and produce states of amplified awareness.
The course costs $30, with the option of a $15 refund on the I
third week if you should wish to drop. There will be free I
lecture-demonstrations on hypnosis and the uses of self- I
hypnosis at our office at 1010 Doyle Street in Menlo Park at I
