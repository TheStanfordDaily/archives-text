# University Implementing New Security Measures
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
A spiraling crime rate and the threat
of more violent demonstrations have
resulted in the implementation of a
multi-faceted security program on
campus.
In a booklet distributed by the
University during registration, President
Richard Lyman notes that his office is
investigating procedures for
moryeffective identification of
individuals involved in disruptions.
The booklet warns militants that
they may be under more police
surveillance; they might be
photographed by "greater numbers of
photographers with more advanced
camera and TV equipment," and they
may be subject to "systems for
campus-wide circulation of
photographs for purposes of
identification." In addition, greater
numbers of faculty, students and staff
members may be recruited to act as
observers or view photographs for
identification purposes.
Exterior Lighting
Beginning last December, the
University began a three-phase plan to
improve exterior lighting on campus.
The first two phases which involve
lighting pathways and parking lots have
been completed at a cost of $200,000.
The goal of the first two phases is to
reduce the number of assaults, rapes
and thefts which occur on poorly-lit
pathways or in unlit parking lots.
Crimes in these categories have almost
doubled in the last two years according
to campus police statistics.
The third phase of the lighting plan
calls for equipping principal academic
and administration buildings with
exterior floodlights. This phase is about
two-thirds completed with $60 ,0 00
having been spent to date.
Bruce Wiggins, director of public
safety, said yesterday that the lighting
plans were formulated before last
spring's disturbances, and he
emphasized that the program is
primarily aimed at reducing crime
levels, not trashing.
More Police Considered
Although the campus police force
remains the same size as a year ago,
with a total complement of 4 4
including station personnel, police
beats have been reviewed and
communications facilities strengthened.
According to Wiggins, a very serious
study is under way to see if more
campus police are needed. In addition,
the department's legal status is under
review. At present, campus police are
not peace officers.
Currently Stanford police are not

trained or equipped to deal with
riot-type situations. Their primary
responsibility is prevention of everyday
crimes.
"Our police have not and will not be
trained as a tactical force," said
Wiggins.
Since local courts dismissed more
than 30 cases involving sit-ins at the
Old Union last spring due to a
"loophole" in the California statutes on
trespassing, the statutes have been
revised by the state legislature. The new
provisions, now signed into law,
provide that an individual may be
charged with trespassing if he fails to
leave property when asked to do so by
its owner and a peace officer.
Previously it had to be proved that the
person trespassed with the intent of
committing property damage or doing
bodily harm. This provision led to the
dismissal of the Old Union sit-in cases.
New I.D. Cards
In a recent issue U.S. News & World
Report said that many universities were
switching to photo identification cards
in order to more easily separate
non-students from students involved in
demonstrations.
Several universities have been using
this system, and the Registrars' Office
here has announced that beginning
winter quarter student body cards will
be of the photo-type now being used
by the food service.
In an announcement passed out
during registration, the Registrars'
Office stated, "The purpose of the new
card is solely to insure that those who
purport to be Stanford students are in
fact Stanford students." Regarding
those who might refuse to be
photographed the announcement said,
"Students who, for whatever reason,
choose not to have their picture affixed
to their identification card may find
themselves inconvenienced, for they
may be denied check cashing services,
bookstore discounts, library service,
ticket buying, food service and similar
activities."
Radicals Critical
Although the University maintains
that the photo ID card is not a security
measure and has dropped the idea of
keeping a copy of each student's
picture on file, some are critical of the
idea.
Thus far no group or organization
has indicated publicly that they will
refuse to comply, although individuals
are concerned that the measure may be
designed to keep non-students off
campus.
Leonard Siegel, a member of the
New Left Project, said, "You can't
assume someone is not a member of the

community because he doesn't have a
picture."
He went on to say, "Stanford wants
to define a member of the community
as someone who pays tuition. That's
not appropriate."
Can't Stop Movement
In regards to the lighting of
buildings, Siegel commented that
Movement tactics are always changing
and the University "can't stop the
Movement by beating last year's
tactics."
Police Chief Thomas Bell felt that
the new lighting would help cut down
crime but couldn't be expected to stop
hit-and-run attacks.
"There's no way to combat that (hit
and run attacks) without stationing a
policeman every hundred yards around
the campus," he said.
Bell was cautiously optimistic about
the coming year. Me said that although
the trouble was not over,
communication between students and
the administration had opened up. He
was hopeful that any disturbance
would not go beyond the vandalism
stage.
