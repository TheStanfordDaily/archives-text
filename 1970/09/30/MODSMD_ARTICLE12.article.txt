# Waits As Long As A Year
## Student Housing Shortage 
### 
The Dean of Students Office
has issued a statement indicating
that the housing shortage on
campus is critical for fall quarter.
Students face waits of anywhere
from a week to a year before they
can be accommodated on campus.
Six men who participated in
last spring's housing draw have
not yet been assigned campus
space. The Dean of Students
Office expects that all six will be
assigned by Oct. 5. No
undergraduate women were left
unassigned in the draw.
Transfers on the wait list

totaled 4 0 men and 75 women.
Some of those in this group are
expected to receive campus
housing. During the first three
weeks of September, 170 people
who had been on this wait list
were assigned space.
None of the undergraduates
who did not participate in the
draw and who were placed on
wait lists will receive housing this
fall. This group includes 33
women and 4 0 men.
Graduate students face a
one-year wait list at Escondido,
and wait lists for Crothers and

Crothers Memorial are very long.
Efforts had been made to warn
students of the housing shortage
in advance. Last spring, students
with a low draw priority were
warned of the shortage. Entering
graduate students received a
mailing in August from the
Graduate Student Association
suggesting that they plan to arrive
early because housing was scarce.
On Sept. 4, a letter was sent to
transfer students explaining the
shortage and informing them of a
clearinghouse that would be
available to them.
From Sept. 12 to Sept. 26,
more than 4 20 graduate and
transfer students used the clearing
house which provided maps,
phones, rides, and general
information about the area.
According to the Dean of
Students Office, the rapid
turnover at the clearinghouse
indicated good luck in finding
places. The Business School, the
International Center, and other
departments also helped students
find space.
Many students responded to
warnings of the housing shortage

by arriving on campus early to
search for living quarters. Alan A.
Cummings. manager of residences,
reports that 283 students used
temporary living quarters in Stern
Hall this year, staying an average
of three nights. The cost of these
rooms is $2.50 a night.

following students have been
reassigned according to their wait list
preference. They must call the Housing
Office, 321-2300 x 3047, or go to the
Housing Office by Thursday, at 9:00

transfer students used the clearing
house which provided maps,
phones, rides, and general
information about the area.
According to the Dean of
Students Office, the rapid
turnover at the clearinghouse
indicated good luck in finding
places. The Business School, the
International Center, and other
departments also helped students
find space.
Many students responded to
warnings of the housing shortage

by arriving on campus early to
search for living quarters. Alan A.
Cummings. manager of residences,
reports that 283 students used
temporary living quarters in Stern
Hall this year, staying an average
of three nights. The cost of these
rooms is $2.50 a night.
New Housing Assignments—The
following students have been
reassigned according to their wait list
preference. They must call the Housing

a.m. to confirm acceptance of these

Snead, Durand; Valli Benesch, Faisan;
Karen Stone, Roth; Nancy Earl, Roth;
Alan Egge, Toyon; David Thomas,

The Dean of Students Office
has issued a statement indicating
that the housing shortage on
campus is critical for fall quarter.
Students face waits of anywhere
from a week to a year before they
can be accommodated on campus.
Six men who participated in
last spring's housing draw have
not yet been assigned campus
space. The Dean of Students
Office expects that all six will be
assigned by Oct. 5. No
undergraduate women were left
unassigned in the draw.
Transfers on the wait list

totaled 4 0 men and 75 women.
Some of those in this group are
expected to receive campus
housing. During the first three
weeks of September, 170 people
who had been on this wait list
were assigned space.
None of the undergraduates
who did not participate in the
draw and who were placed on
wait lists will receive housing this
fall. This group includes 33
women and 4 0 men.
Graduate students face a
one-year wait list at Escondido,
and wait lists for Crothers and

Crothers Memorial are very long.
Efforts had been made to warn
students of the housing shortage
in advance. Last spring, students
with a low draw priority were
warned of the shortage. Entering
graduate students received a
mailing in August from the
Graduate Student Association
suggesting that they plan to arrive
early because housing was scarce.
On Sept. 4, a letter was sent to
transfer students explaining the
shortage and informing them of a
clearinghouse that would be
available to them.
From Sept. 12 to Sept. 26,
more than 4 20 graduate and
transfer students used the clearing
house which provided maps,
phones, rides, and general
information about the area.
According to the Dean of
