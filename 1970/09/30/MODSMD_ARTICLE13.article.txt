# Local Clean Air Car Wins Divisional Title
## 
### 
Two Stanford graduate
students in aeronautics and
astronautics piloted their
American Motors Gremlin,
modified to burn methyl alcohol
(methanol), to a first-place finish
in its division in last month's
cross-country Clean Air Car Race.
The two drivers, Dana Andrews
of Port Angeles, Washington, and
Henry Adelman of Franklin, Pa.,
amassed 2479 points, over Boo
points more than their nearest
competitor, a gasoline-powered
entry from Wayne State
University of Detroit. The scores
were based on emissions, thermal
efficiency and performance tests,
as well as the time taken by the
entries on the transcontinental
course.
However, the winner in this
race wasn't the car which finished
first (the race was more of a rally,
with cars starting 10 minutes
apart), nor was it the entry with
the most points. Thus, the Wayne
State entry was awarded the
overall honors since gasoline
engine was more practical to
adapt to present conditions.
But Andrews and Adelman did
win a $5000 prize in the form of a
research contract with the
National Air Pollution Control

Administration, under which the
Gremlin will be taken to Detroit
for use in further research
projects.
The drivers decided to fuel
their entry with methanol after
three weeks of research convinced
them that they could not build a
clean enough gasoline engine
without making extensive
modifications which were
prohibited by the terms of their
contract with the manufacturer.
Methanol, they found, is cheap,
costing two-thirds to one-half as
much as conventional gas, does
not produce any sulfur oxides or
particulate emissions on
combustion, and has a high octane
rating so that carbon monoxide
production is virtually eliminated.
The Gremlin beat the 1980
Federal pollution control
standards which are about half the
levels set by the state of California
for all 19 75 model cars.
The other Stanford entry in
the race, a propane-burning
Mercury Capri, also met the 1980
standards and finished tenth out
of nineteen cars in its gaseous fuel
division. Both cars were sponsored
by the Stanford Clean Air Club,
headed by Robert Byer, assistant
professor of physics.
