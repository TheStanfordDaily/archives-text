# National Job Market Will Remain Tight
## 
### 
The job market for next June's
graduates may well be just as tight
as the one just past, Placement
Director Ralph Keller reported
last week.
Forty-seven major firms have
cancelled their recruitment
interviews for the academic year
1 970-71 and the total may go
higher, he said. An additional 2 2
"regulars" did not even ask for
appointments this year.
Stanford generally hosts about
400 recruiting teams per year,
reflecting the entire spectrum of
business, industry, government,
and education.
Since recruiting reaches its
peak in the early part of the
calendar year, the job picture will
become more clear as the
January-March period approaches,
the placement director said.
Keller was the first college
placement director to predict
correctly the hardness of last
June's job market for graduates in
all fields-especially Ph.D.'s in the
humanities.
There may be several reasons
for the current recruiting dropoff,
Keller believes.

One is that business and
industry, with the exception of
computers, are still in the grip of a
recession, as reflected by a
nationwide report last week that
white-collar workers are at a
10-year low in employment.
Another is that firms will not
be spending money on sending
recruiting teams around the
country when they can hire all the
limited amounts of new personnel
they need in their home areas.
However, engineers with a
master's in business
administration or a flair for
salesmanship are needed for sales
of computer equipment.
Whether the trend continues,
or reverses to reflect a rising
economy remains to be seen, Dr.
Keller said. It is possible that
recruiters could reinstate their
appointments.
Keller stressed that, in
cooperation with the University's
new Academic Information
Center (AIC) his own office is also
offering career planning well in
advance of graduation for both
undergraduates and candidates for
advanced degrees.
