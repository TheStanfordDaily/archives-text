Why don't you come over and
photograph our etchings
sometime? The Daily needs good
photographers, and there might
even be some money in it for you.
Get into a football game free,
experience our dark room,
pretend you work for newspaper
like that pimpy guy in "Z." The
possibilities are endless. There's a
meeting today at three or phone
Ext. 4 632 and ask for Lee
Greathouse.
