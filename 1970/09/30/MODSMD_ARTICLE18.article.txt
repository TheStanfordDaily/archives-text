# Vote Set For WRA Change
## 
### 
A referendum to restructure
the governing board of the
Women's Recreation Association
will be held this week in the
women's gymnasium.
The proposal under
consideration would trim the
number of sport managers and
coordinators from two from each
dormitory to a total of six, each
heading a specific area.
Any registered woman student
is eligible to vote.
Proponents of the revision say
it would reduce a large, dispersed
group into a more efficient
governing board of 10, including
president, vice president, secretary
and treasurer.
The six other members would
be contemporary dance manager,
folk dance manager,
intercollegiate sports coordinator,
intramural tournaments manager,

living board manager and
recreation manager.
The six board members would
be selected by students and by
appointment of the governing
board.
The president, vice president

and secretary of the board would
be elected by the membership
each spring as before.
Dorm representatives and
sports managers would report to
their representative on the
governing board.
