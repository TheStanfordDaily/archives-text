# Tent City
## Tenants Protest Continues 
### 
"Tent City" continued its week-long
program of events yesterday under the
watchful eye of Associate Provost
Robert Rosenzweig.
Members of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union (PATU) have erected several
tents in the grove east of Memorial
Auditorium in order to dramatize
Stanford's land development policies
which PATU claims "encourage
war-related industry at the expense of
housing for the working people."
After meeting with PATU late
yesterday morning, Rosenzweig stated
that "since the tents went up late
Monday morning we have been trying
to obtain more information on the uses
to which they will be put, and how
long they will be left up."
During the meeting, said
Rosenzweig, the group told him that no
one will live in the tents which will be
removed at week's end. Jean Hobson,

PATU spokesman, claims that remains
the group's "stated intention."
Rosenzweig also said that the
administration has notified the county
fire marshal and county health
authorities of the existence of "tent
city."
Yesterday afternoon Santa Clara
Fire Marshal John Baker appeared at
the improvised city with an assistant
and two sheriff's deputies. They
claimed that the large Army Surplus
tent was a fire hazard and would have
to be removed immediately.
At first the group refused to talk
with Baker, but that disagreement was
settled when the sheriff's deputies were
removed. In the ensuing meeting
between the two sides, PATU agreed to
keep people out of the tent and Baker
consented to allow the flimsy structure
to stand as a symbol of protest under
these conditions.

Rosenzweig said last night that he
did not know if fire or health
authorities were planning additional
sanctions against PATU.
As part of its programmed activities
the tenant's group plans a noon rally in
White Plaza today, at which time the
group will formally present demands
for more low-cost housing to the
University.
Graduate student Janet Weiss
charged in a speech Monday night that
the University would not be able to
meet such demands because it was
unable to afford having hordes of
workers living in the "heartland of
imperialism."
The group's activities for the rest of
the week include evening discussions,
movies and speeches culminating in a
torchlight parade to Lytton Plaza
Saturday evening.


ONCE AGAlNâ€”Registration lines appeared to have been longer than ever this fall with some students claiming it took more
than four hours to get through. Reliable reports, however, say the extra time in registration is made up by shorter lines in the
bookstore this year.
