Mideast Future Uncertain
CAIRO — Egyptians poured out their grief for Gamal
Abdel Nasser on Tuesday as world capitals wondered what
his passing may portend for peace in the Middle East.
Many feared that the Egyptian president's death may
mean a new setback for the already stalled peace talks
between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
"It's a vacuum too horrible to contemplate, a
Western-educated Arab said Tuesday.
"I can see only chaos ahead," said a Beirut University
professor.
"I have been pretty pessimistic all along, a diplomat
commented. "Now I'm really blue. Who can bring the
Arab world together now?"
Despite his revolutionary role in modern Arab history
and his anti-American public posture, Nasser exerted a
moderating influence on Arab extremists.
In Egypt itself, a power struggle appears inevitable.
And the Arab world, deprived of Egypt's dominating
influence, faces a period of doubt, confusion, turmoil and
probably violence. .
Mobs took to .the streets of Beirut, smashing windows
and burning cars, within minutes of the announcement of
Nasser's death.
Arab extremists—the Palestinian guerrillas and the
leftist Syrian and Iraqi regimes—can be expected to try and
fill the void left by Nasser.
But they are bitterly divided among themselves, and
their struggle for supremacy carries risks of further
bloodshed among Arab brothers.
Nasser and Jordan's King Hussein were the only Arab
leaders to accept the U.S. Middle East peace initiative.
Palestinian guerrilla opposition to a negotiated peace with
Israel precipitated the fighting in Jordan.
Hussein now must face the guerrillas alone. If the
guerrillas raise again—and this seems to be a matter of
time—Hussein will have the bitter choice of unleashing his
Bedouin armies against them or suing for peace with Israel,
a step which could be suicidal. ?
Some diplomats at the United Nations said Nassers
death might spell the end of the U.S. initiative that laid the
groundwork for the talks with a 90-day cease-fire between
Israel on one side and Egypt and Jordan on the other.
Gunnar V. Jarring, the U.N. peace mediator, disagreed,
saying it was too early to tell, a U.N. spokesman reported.
MOSCOW — Kremlin leaders, having lost the key man
they dealt with in the Middle East, are moving to maintain
their influence in the area.
Nasser had a special relationship with the Soviet Union.
He repeatedly came here for personal consultations with
Kremlin leaders and they returned his visits.
To replace Nasser in the Soviet scheme is perhaps even
more difficult than replacing him as an Arab leader.
Soviet leaders have given no indication whom they
might back as Nasser's successor in Egypt or in the wider
Arab world. They may count on siding with the man who
eventually comes out on top.
Justice Dept. On Campuses
WASHINGTON - Seeking what Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell termed a beneficial exchange of information and
views, the Justice Department today announced it would
send representatives to 51 campuses in 31 states for
discussions with students.
Included on the list are four predominantly black
institutions, and other colleges and universities ranging in
size from Indiana University, with 56,000 students, to
Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., and Reed College in
Portland, Ore., both with 1200 students.
Mitchell, who has not disclosed whether he would be
among the representatives visiting the campuses, said the
visits, in October and November, are designed to improve

communications between college students and the Justice
Department. In letters to the institutions' presidents,
Mitchell noted that much of the Justice Department's
work-law enforcement, civil rights and environmental
quality—is "of deep interest to many younger Americans."
FTC Cites Chevron
WASHINGTON — Standard Oil of California, the nation's
fifth largest domestic oil company, was accused Tuesday
by the Federal Trade Commission of falsely claiming that
its F3lO additive in its Chevron gasoline significantly
reduces air pollution when used in automobiles.
"Each representation made for Chevron with F-310 or
for F-310 has not been proven or fully substantiated by
reliable, accurate tests or by some other appropriately
controlled means," the FTC said.
F-310, com nission staffers said, is Chevron's name for a
common detergent gasoline additive that has been in use in
many types of gasoline for a number of years.
In San Francisco, O. N. Miller, Standard's chairman of
the board, called the commission's allegations "erroneous
and unfounded" and said the company "intends to take
immediate and strong action to defend itself against the
commission's accusations."
The order would not become binding on Standard of
California unless agreed to by the company or decreed by
the five-member commission and upheld by the courts.
The proposed order would require Standard of
California to devote 25 percent of the; space in future
printed advertisements and 25 percent of the running time
of radio or television advertisements to publicizing the
FTC charges.
Seale Pleads Innocent
NEWUIAVEN, Conn. — Bobby G. Seale, national chairman
of the Black Panther party, pleaded innocent in Superior
Court on Tuesday to the four charges filed against him in
connection with the shooting death of another Panther
more than 16 months ago.
Seale, 33, was in court for the state of hearings on
pretrial motions with another defendant in the case, Ericka
Huggins. Among the motions were that Seale and Mrs.
Huggins be granted a joint trial and that charges be
dismissed on grounds of prejudicial publicity.
As the four charges against him were read, Seale labeled
each "false." He asked for a trial by a 12-man jury and
said, "Don't you give me a six-man jury."
Seale is charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy
to kidnap, first-degree murder and kidnaping.
Fires Under Control
LOS ANGELES — Southern California's worst ordeal by
fire seemed near an end Tuesday.
As cool, moist sea breezes took over from hot, dry
desert blasts fire fighters from Sequoia to San Diego said
they had controlled or expected to control major blazes
that have charred nearly half a million acres—an area
almost as big as Rhode Island.
But even as the embers cooled, state officials were
working on plans to ease what they say is the certainty of
mudslides and flooding this winter on denuded mountain
and foothill slopes.
The Los Angeles County sheriff's office said it suspects
arson in some of a rash of smaller fires in the Los Angeles
area. Spokesmen said the causes of most of the state's
major blazes was unknown, although there was no
evidence of arson in these fires.
In Los Angeles County, where 13 fires blackened
1 12,000 acres, the devastating Malibu blaze was finally
checked. A section of a fire in San Gabriel Canyon
remained uncontrolled.
Since the fires first broke out Friday ten persons have
died.
