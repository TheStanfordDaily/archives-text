# University Specifies New Policyâ€” No Refunds If Stanford Closes
## 
### 
The Registrar's Office is warning all
students registering this fall that
tuition, fees, and room and board
payments will not be refunded if the
university is forced to close.
The students have also been notified
that the University is prepared to shut
down if there are unmanageable
disruptions.
The warnings were contained in an
"Interim Statement of Certain
University Regulations" distributed
with the time schedule.
Special Notice
In a "Special Notice" on the back
page, the booklet cautioned, "should
the University determine that
continuation of some or all academic
and other campus activities is
impracticable or that their continuation
involves a high degree of physical
danger to persons or property, activities
may be curtailed and students

requested or required to leave the
campus."
Robert Beyers, director of the
Stanford News Service, noted that tne
University wanted to make its legal
position clear on the tuition issue
because there were several court actions
filed in the past few months regarding
the closing of universities across the
country during the spring. Almost all
were based on the tuition issue.
According to the Palo Alto Times,
Stanford has never before issued this
type of precautionary warning. "As far
as can be determined," the Times
speculated, "no other college or
university has been as specific in
spelling out what would happen in the
event of disruptions."
Tuition Warning
The warning on tuition was stated
succintly "Your tuition, fees, and room
and board payments for the quarter are
not refundable, except to the extent

provided in the University Information
Bulletin." However, there was clear,
though unstated, allusion to possible
disruptions that might force the
university to close.
During the Spring disruptions and
the week-long student strike of last
year, there was considerable
speculation as to whether Stanford, like
some universities, would close for the
year. Many students, faculty members,
and parents voiced extreme displeasure
when it was strongly hinted that
continued disruptions might end the
school year a month early.
Most protest in this vein centered on
the academic issue of closing a
university. At least one petition,
bearing several hundred names, was
presented to the administration urging
that Stanford remain open. No position
was then stated by the administration
on the refunding of student payments.
