# Agnew Attacks Scranton Report; 'More Pablum For Permissiveness'
## 
### 
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew denounced
the Scranton report on campus unrest
Tuesday as "imprecise, contradictory
and equivocal."
He declared its refusal to lay sole
blame on violent protesters and those
who encourage them will "be taken as
more Pablum for the permissiveness."
Agnew's denunciation in a campaign
speech in Sioux Falls for South Dacota
Republicans was especially critical of
the commission's call for leadership by
the President in quelling campus unrest.

"To lay responsibility for ending
student disruptions at the doorstep of
this President-in office 20 months is
'scapegoating' of the most irresponsible
sort," the vice president declared.
It was the sharpest attack yet on the
commission report by a high' Nixon
administration official, but White
House speech writers on loan to Agnew
for the campaign said it would not
necessarily be interpreted as
representing the views of the President.
One commission member, Revius
Ortique of New Orleans, said after
Agnew's comments:
"We didn't attempt to place the
blame on what has taken place in the
country. We were primarily concerned
with trying to assess the situation for
the President and that we certainly do
not think that the emphasis be placed
on what has gone on before, except
that we should learn to avoid what has
gone on. We hope that when the
President returns and has time to read
the report that he would view it in that
context."
The report also came under fire in
Washington by 56 Republican and four
Democratic congressmen who wrote a
letter to President Nixon saying it
"totally ignores reality" in its proposed
solutions and "blantantly disregards"
the efforts made by Nixon to solve the
campus problems.
In Agnew's speech he said, "In the

indiscriminate fashion in which it
diffuses and dilutes responsibility, in
the total unfairness of the most widely
publicized recommendation in the
thinly rationalization for student
disruption, the report comes out in its
over-all impression imprecise,
contradictory and equivocal."
"It is sure to be taken as more
Pablum for the permissiveness," he
said.
He said primary responsibility lies

with faculty and administrators,
adding, "The President cannot replace
the campus cop."
The commission, which was named
last spring by President Nixon and
whose chairman was former Gov.
William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania,
said in its report issued Saturday that
"only the President can offer the
compassionate, reconciling moral
leadership that can bring the country
together again."

context."
The report also came under fire in
Washington by 56 Republican and four
Democratic congressmen who wrote a
letter to President Nixon saying it
"totally ignores reality" in its proposed
solutions and "blantantly disregards"
the efforts made by Nixon to solve the
campus problems.
In Agnew's speech he said, "In the

indiscriminate fashion in which it
diffuses and dilutes responsibility, in
the total unfairness of the most widely
publicized recommendation in the
thinly rationalization for student
disruption, the report comes out in its
over-all impression imprecise,
contradictory and equivocal."
"It is sure to be taken as more
Pablum for the permissiveness," he
said.
He said primary responsibility lies

with faculty and administrators,
adding, "The President cannot replace
the campus cop."
The commission, which was named
last spring by President Nixon and
whose chairman was former Gov.
William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania,
said in its report issued Saturday that
"only the President can offer the
compassionate, reconciling moral
leadership that can bring the country
together again."
