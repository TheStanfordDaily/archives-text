# Physicist Noyes Goes To Court In Vietnam War Legality Test
## 
### LARRY LEIBERT 
Pierre Noyes, a Stanford physicist,
will represent more than 8 00 taxpayers
from 20 states today in a citizens' suit
challenging the Vietnam War.
U.S. District Court Judge Habris will
hear the suit this morning at 10 a.m. at
the Federal Building in San Francisco.
Unless the suit is continued a second
time, Noyes' group will have a chance
to argue that the Vietnam War uses
taxes illegally because it was not
declared by Congress, involves war
crimes, and violates international law.
Noyes, a theoretical physicist at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
depended mostly on form letters and
word-of-mouth publicity throughout
the country to recruit supporters for
the suit, "Noyes, et al. vs. Nixon, et
al."
Although admitting there is little
chance the court will judge the war
illegal, Noyes insists the suit will "help
remove any legitimacy of the military
establishment."
Courts have refused to consider
most such challenges to the war,
although U.S. District Judge William
Sweigert recently announced he will
hear an anti-war suit filed by California
reservists.
Political Question
Political science professor Robert
Horn, an expert on constitutional law,
explains that the U.S. Supreme Court
has historically refused to hear this
type of suit because the justices have
considered it a "political question that
would require unconstitutional
meddling with another branch of
government to decide.

"Any other position would
represent a constitutional revolution,
and 1 don't think that is likely on this
kind of issue," Horn commented
yesterday.
Noyes' suit goes beyond past
challenges objecting to war crimes and
international treaty violations in
addition to Congress' failure to declare
war.
No War Judgements
While conceding that federal courts
have usually refused to judge cases
concerning wars, Noyes pointed to
other international issues considered by
the courts, such as baggage claims and
fishing rights disputes.
He said, "If we re ever going to be
an internatinal community,
international law has to be enforcable
in national courts."
The government's initial brief in the
case objected that a decision against the
government would hamper the
President's options in the war, insult
the executive branch, and embarrass
the U.S. in its relations with other
countries.
Lawyers for the defendants, who
include President Nixon and Defense
Secretary Melvin also objected
that Congress did not need to declare
war in Vietnam because past defense
appropriations showed tacit acceptance
of the war.
Change Climate
Noyes believes his suit, filed by
"comparatively conservative"
taxpayers, will improve the "legal
climate of opinion" for draft resistance

and other cases challenging the
military.
The "within-the-system" challenge
of a court suit increases opposition to
the war because "you get a different
cross section to do this kind of thing"
than more militant protests, according
to Noyes.
But he believes failure of such suits
could lead to wide changes, such as
"setting up a fourth branch of
government."
Ombudsmen?
Noyes said failure of such citizens'
suits may generate demands for
ombudsmen, independent officials with
broad powers to take citizens'
complaints against government before
the courts.
Although he once worked to
develop the H-bomb, Noyes now
strongly opposes the power of the U.S.
military. His views were changed by the
Vietnam war. the "aggressive posture"
of the ABM system, and the anti-war
April Third Movement here in 1969.
Noyes believes the Nuremberg trials
clearly established individual
responsibility in international crimes.
He explains, "Since I have in the
past worked for the U.S. military
establishment and have 'a substantial
moral choice,' I must dissociate myself
from these actions in order not to
become a war criminal."
Committed to "social
responsibility" for scientists, he has
terminated his military security
clearances and contacts, even refusing
to send copies of his scientific papers to
any organization involved in military
research.
