## Timothy Leary, Weathermen, And Babylon 
### 
The League for Spiritual
Discovery has joined the Red
Army (a street gang fighting in the
streets of Babylon, a demolition
squad in the belly of the beast).
The rescue of Timothy Leary and
his statement (best described as
psychedelic ecological
Manicheanism with apocalyptic
overtones) have gotten a lot of
radicals to thinking about the
rhetoric of "Free all political
prisoners" and"The sky's the
limit."
Timothy Leary's escape with
the accompanying declaration of
war and the recent UPI series on
the political evolution of Diana
Oughton have placed the
Weatherman organization in the
public eye. The Weathermen, few
and isolated as they are, are
people who are freeing political
prisoners and also blowing things
sky high.
Leary, now "armed and
dangerous," a few years ago at the
Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park
called on freaks to "turn on, tune
in, & drop out," while Yippie!
Jerry Rubin asked freaks to "turn
on, tune in, & take over."
(Rubin's hortatory ramblings were
regarded as a bummer by the
stoned "gathering of the tribes.")
Leary used to compare, in his raps
those days, the old Berkeley Barb
and the San Francisco Oracle and
endorsed the Oracle because it
was free of political sales pitches.
Leary has been through a lot of
hassles with the law between then
and now. He considered running
in the last Democratic party
gubernatorial primary on a
platform of decentralized
tribalism : n California. Now the
Weathermen (who have remained
somewhat closer to the
counter-culture in life-style than
have the Revolutionary Youth
Movement, the Revolutionary
Union, or Progressive Labor) have
in their underground of fugitives a
folk hero whom every high school
student's parents are afraid of
politically and culturally. Leary is
high priest of the cultural
revolution, the man who
established the acid freak as a
social role. The Weathermen are
the best known terrorists in
America.
What is really interesting about
the Weathermen aside from their

treatment in the media, the
statements J. Edgar Hoover
makes, and the fear they inspire in
suburbia, is the negative attitude
toward them in the American
Left. Since the Left seems to be
exhibiting a will to suicide
through sectarianism, this might
not seem unusual. But the
prevalent attitude toward the
Weathermen seems to be
qualitatively different. I think the
reason lies in the Weatherman
group's revolutionary strategy.
Third World Revolution
The student Left, when it
turned to Marxism to explain
American military intervention in
the Third World, rhetorically
turned to Maoism. But
theoretically, the schema whicli
was adopted was a revival of
Trotskyism. The understanding of
economic under development was
derived from the work of
Preobrazhensky and the solution
was Trotsky's international
"permanent revolution."
With a major focus on Third
World revolution, the Left faced a
serious dilemma which was well
stated by Greg Calvert (then
national secretary of SDS, now an
anarcho-communist) in February
1 967: "If a mass movement
cannot be built in white America,
then individuals with
revolutionary hopes and
perspectives must orient
themselves toward Third World
revolutions and develop those
methods of activity which will
maximize the impact of
peasant-based revolutions on the
structure of the American
imperialist monster." Calvert
believed then and believes now
that such an American mass
movement can be built, but those
who became Weathermen did not
believe it possible.
The Weathermen came to
believe that the kind of long-term
protracted struggle with its
attendant educational and
propaganda work would be futile.
All America was capital, and the
Third World was the exploited
proletariat. The American white
working class was blocked from
fulfilling its historic Marxian
mission by its "white skin
privilege." (Some social science
research on the American working
class comes to a parallel
conclusion.) Direct action in
America to help the Third World
revolutionaries was what was
needed to bring the empire down.
What differentiates this
revolutionary strategy from others
is that efforts are not being made
by the Weathermen to unmask the
true nature of the American
system in order to penetrate the
American population's false
consciousness. This sort of work
to provide the "subjective
conditions" for a revolution is not
a task the Weathermen have set
for themselves. The Weatherman
group is instead directly attacking
what it sees as the physical plant
of the American empire. What the
Weathermen seem to be saying
through their deeds is that
America's world role can be
altered by the direct application
of force ("maximum material

damage") aimed at the society's
material base.
American Guerillas
The pipelines and storage tanks
of USA, Inc. are being blown up,
instead of an effort being
organized to replace the board of
directors. The Weathermen intend
to change the objective material
conditions of American society
through physical destruction
rather than following the more
conventional revolutionary path
of mobilizing a fighting force and
then changing the personnel who
command the productive forces of
the society. The Indochina war,
quite obviously, could not
continue if the productive

apparatus on which U.S. troops
depend was not working.
That the Weathermen have
come to consider themselves the
American equivalent of Uruguay's
Tupamaros urban guerrillas is
understandable in light of the
history of the New Left. They are
living the violent struggle that
other leftists have been and still are
talking about.
It is a matter of considerable
dispute as to whether their
position is intelligible in the light
of reality. The Weathermen have
excellent insights (for the wrong
reasons) about the nature of
American foreign policy, the
American domestic political

economy, the American system of
secondary school education,
American social classes, the
American family, etc. They do
have a revolutionary strategy and
are pursuing it. But with a better
methodology, better work than
theirs could be done. Where
people on t! 1 Left who believe
that a native American revolution
is possible and who do not see
themselves as primarily auxiliaries
of Third World revolution have
failed so far is in not applying
anywhere near the kind of intense
energy the Weathermen have
expended in trying to work out a
revolutionary theory and strategy.

The League for Spiritual

Army (a street gang fighting in the
streets of Babylon, a demolition

The rescue of Timothy Leary and
his statement (best described as
psychedelic ecological
Manicheanism with apocalyptic
overtones) have gotten a lot of
radicals to thinking about the
rhetoric of "Free all political
prisoners" and"The sky's the
limit."
Timothy Leary's escape with
the accompanying declaration of
war and the recent UPI series on
the political evolution of Diana
Oughton have placed the
Weatherman organization in the
public eye. The Weathermen, few
and isolated as they are, are
people who are freeing political
prisoners and also blowing things
sky high.
Leary, now "armed and
dangerous," a few years ago at the
Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park
called on freaks to "turn on, tune
in, & drop out," while Yippie!
Jerry Rubin asked freaks to "turn
on, tune in, & take over."
(Rubin's hortatory ramblings were
regarded as a bummer by the
stoned "gathering of the tribes.")
Leary used to compare, in his raps
those days, the old Berkeley Barb
and the San Francisco Oracle and
endorsed the Oracle because it
was free of political sales pitches.
Leary has been through a lot of
hassles with the law between then
and now. He considered running
in the last Democratic party
gubernatorial primary on a
platform of decentralized
tribalism : n California. Now the
Weathermen (who have remained
somewhat closer to the
counter-culture in life-style than
have the Revolutionary Youth
Movement, the Revolutionary
Union, or Progressive Labor) have
in their underground of fugitives a
folk hero whom every high school
student's parents are afraid of
politically and culturally. Leary is
high priest of the cultural
revolution, the man who
established the acid freak as a
social role. The Weathermen are
the best known terrorists in
America.
What is really interesting about
the Weathermen aside from their

treatment in the media, the
statements J. Edgar Hoover
makes, and the fear they inspire in
suburbia, is the negative attitude
toward them in the American
Left. Since the Left seems to be
exhibiting a will to suicide
through sectarianism, this might
not seem unusual. But the
prevalent attitude toward the
Weathermen seems to be
qualitatively different. I think the
reason lies in the Weatherman
group's revolutionary strategy.
Third World Revolution
The student Left, when it
turned to Marxism to explain
American military intervention in
the Third World, rhetorically
turned to Maoism. But
theoretically, the schema whicli
was adopted was a revival of
Trotskyism. The understanding of
economic under development was
derived from the work of
Preobrazhensky and the solution
was Trotsky's international
"permanent revolution."
With a major focus on Third
World revolution, the Left faced a
serious dilemma which was well
stated by Greg Calvert (then
national secretary of SDS, now an
anarcho-communist) in February
1 967: "If a mass movement
cannot be built in white America,
then individuals with
revolutionary hopes and
perspectives must orient
themselves toward Third World
revolutions and develop those
methods of activity which will
maximize the impact of
peasant-based revolutions on the
structure of the American
imperialist monster." Calvert
believed then and believes now
that such an American mass
movement can be built, but those
who became Weathermen did not
believe it possible.
The Weathermen came to
believe that the kind of long-term
protracted struggle with its
attendant educational and
propaganda work would be futile.
All America was capital, and the
Third World was the exploited
proletariat. The American white
working class was blocked from
fulfilling its historic Marxian
mission by its "white skin
privilege." (Some social science
research on the American working
class comes to a parallel
conclusion.) Direct action in
America to help the Third World
revolutionaries was what was
needed to bring the empire down.
What differentiates this
revolutionary strategy from others
is that efforts are not being made
by the Weathermen to unmask the
true nature of the American
system in order to penetrate the
American population's false
consciousness. This sort of work
to provide the "subjective
conditions" for a revolution is not
a task the Weathermen have set
for themselves. The Weatherman
group is instead directly attacking
what it sees as the physical plant
of the American empire. What the
Weathermen seem to be saying
through their deeds is that
America's world role can be
altered by the direct application
of force ("maximum material

damage") aimed at the society's
material base.
American Guerillas
The pipelines and storage tanks
of USA, Inc. are being blown up,
instead of an effort being
organized to replace the board of
directors. The Weathermen intend
to change the objective material
conditions of American society
through physical destruction
rather than following the more
conventional revolutionary path
of mobilizing a fighting force and
then changing the personnel who
command the productive forces of
the society. The Indochina war,
quite obviously, could not
continue if the productive

apparatus on which U.S. troops
depend was not working.
That the Weathermen have
come to consider themselves the
American equivalent of Uruguay's
Tupamaros urban guerrillas is
understandable in light of the
history of the New Left. They are
living the violent struggle that
other leftists have been and still are
talking about.
It is a matter of considerable
dispute as to whether their
position is intelligible in the light
of reality. The Weathermen have
excellent insights (for the wrong
reasons) about the nature of
American foreign policy, the
American domestic political

economy, the American system of
secondary school education,
American social classes, the
American family, etc. They do
have a revolutionary strategy and
are pursuing it. But with a better
methodology, better work than
theirs could be done. Where
people on t! 1 Left who believe
that a native American revolution
is possible and who do not see
themselves as primarily auxiliaries
of Third World revolution have
failed so far is in not applying
anywhere near the kind of intense
energy the Weathermen have
expended in trying to work out a
revolutionary theory and strategy.

methodology, better work than

people on t! 1 Left who believe
that a native American revolution
is possible and who do not see
themselves as primarily auxiliaries
of Third World revolution have
failed so far is in not applying
anywhere near the kind of intense
energy the Weathermen have
expended in trying to work out a
revolutionary theory and strategy.

The League for Spiritual
Discovery has joined the Red
Army (a street gang fighting in the
streets of Babylon, a demolition

The rescue of Timothy Leary and
his statement (best described as
psychedelic ecological
Manicheanism with apocalyptic
overtones) have gotten a lot of
radicals to thinking about the
rhetoric of "Free all political
prisoners" and"The sky's the
limit."
Timothy Leary's escape with
the accompanying declaration of
war and the recent UPI series on
the political evolution of Diana
Oughton have placed the
Weatherman organization in the
public eye. The Weathermen, few
and isolated as they are, are
people who are freeing political
prisoners and also blowing things
sky high.
Leary, now "armed and
dangerous," a few years ago at the
Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park
called on freaks to "turn on, tune
in, & drop out," while Yippie!
Jerry Rubin asked freaks to "turn
on, tune in, & take over."
(Rubin's hortatory ramblings were
regarded as a bummer by the
stoned "gathering of the tribes.")
Leary used to compare, in his raps
those days, the old Berkeley Barb
and the San Francisco Oracle and
endorsed the Oracle because it
was free of political sales pitches.
Leary has been through a lot of
hassles with the law between then
and now. He considered running
in the last Democratic party
gubernatorial primary on a
platform of decentralized
tribalism : n California. Now the
Weathermen (who have remained
somewhat closer to the
counter-culture in life-style than
have the Revolutionary Youth
Movement, the Revolutionary
Union, or Progressive Labor) have
in their underground of fugitives a
folk hero whom every high school
student's parents are afraid of
politically and culturally. Leary is
high priest of the cultural
revolution, the man who
established the acid freak as a
social role. The Weathermen are
the best known terrorists in
America.
What is really interesting about
the Weathermen aside from their

treatment in the media, the
statements J. Edgar Hoover
makes, and the fear they inspire in
suburbia, is the negative attitude
toward them in the American
Left. Since the Left seems to be
exhibiting a will to suicide
through sectarianism, this might
not seem unusual. But the
prevalent attitude toward the
Weathermen seems to be
qualitatively different. I think the
reason lies in the Weatherman
group's revolutionary strategy.
Third World Revolution
The student Left, when it
turned to Marxism to explain
American military intervention in
the Third World, rhetorically
turned to Maoism. But
theoretically, the schema whicli
was adopted was a revival of
Trotskyism. The understanding of
economic under development was
derived from the work of
Preobrazhensky and the solution
was Trotsky's international
"permanent revolution."
With a major focus on Third
World revolution, the Left faced a
serious dilemma which was well
stated by Greg Calvert (then
national secretary of SDS, now an
anarcho-communist) in February
1 967: "If a mass movement
cannot be built in white America,
then individuals with
revolutionary hopes and
perspectives must orient
themselves toward Third World
revolutions and develop those
methods of activity which will
maximize the impact of
peasant-based revolutions on the
structure of the American
imperialist monster." Calvert
believed then and believes now
that such an American mass
movement can be built, but those
who became Weathermen did not
believe it possible.
The Weathermen came to
believe that the kind of long-term
protracted struggle with its
attendant educational and
propaganda work would be futile.
All America was capital, and the
Third World was the exploited
proletariat. The American white
working class was blocked from
fulfilling its historic Marxian
mission by its "white skin
privilege." (Some social science
research on the American working
class comes to a parallel
conclusion.) Direct action in
America to help the Third World
revolutionaries was what was
needed to bring the empire down.
What differentiates this
revolutionary strategy from others
is that efforts are not being made
by the Weathermen to unmask the
true nature of the American
system in order to penetrate the
American population's false
consciousness. This sort of work
to provide the "subjective
conditions" for a revolution is not
a task the Weathermen have set
for themselves. The Weatherman
group is instead directly attacking
what it sees as the physical plant
of the American empire. What the
Weathermen seem to be saying
through their deeds is that
America's world role can be
altered by the direct application
of force ("maximum material

damage") aimed at the society's
material base.
American Guerillas
The pipelines and storage tanks
of USA, Inc. are being blown up,
instead of an effort being
organized to replace the board of
directors. The Weathermen intend
to change the objective material
conditions of American society
through physical destruction
rather than following the more
conventional revolutionary path
of mobilizing a fighting force and
then changing the personnel who
command the productive forces of
the society. The Indochina war,
quite obviously, could not
continue if the productive

apparatus on which U.S. troops
depend was not working.
That the Weathermen have
come to consider themselves the
American equivalent of Uruguay's
Tupamaros urban guerrillas is
understandable in light of the
history of the New Left. They are
living the violent struggle that
other leftists have been and still are
talking about.
It is a matter of considerable
dispute as to whether their
position is intelligible in the light
of reality. The Weathermen have
excellent insights (for the wrong
reasons) about the nature of
American foreign policy, the
American domestic political

economy, the American system of
secondary school education,
American social classes, the
American family, etc. They do
have a revolutionary strategy and
are pursuing it. But with a better
methodology, better work than
theirs could be done. Where
people on t! 1 Left who believe
that a native American revolution

themselves as primarily auxiliaries
of Third World revolution have
