# A 						Letter

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to reply to the
prominently-featured letter from
Tom Seitz and Bill Evers of the
Radical Liberation Alliance which
appeared in the Tuesday paper.
Their report of a converstaion
which I had with Mr. Seitz is a
misleading misrepresentation of
the Dean of Students' position
regarding ASSU program fees. It is
not our view that the fee is an
"illegal tax," nor has the Dean's
Office cancelled or temporarily
suspended this charge.
Students electing to defer
tuition and/or fees should
understand that a postponement
of a financial obligation is simply
that.
I hope that the Daily will make
an effort to confirm statements
attributed to this or other
University offices prior to
publishing them; doing so in this
case would have certainly avoided
a great deal of confusion.
