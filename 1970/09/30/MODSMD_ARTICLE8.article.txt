# An Open Letter To Frosh

"They have an idol, to which
they consecrate themselves
high-priest, and deem it holy work
to offer sacrifices of whatever is
most precious; and never once
seem to suspect—so cunning has
the devil been with them—that
this false deity, in whose iron
features, immitigable to all the
rest of mankind, they see only
benignity and love, is but the
spectrum of the very priest
himself, projected on the
surrounding darkness. And the
higher and purer the original
object, the more unselfishly it
may have been taken up, the
slighter is the probability that
they can be led to recognize the
process by which God-like
benevolence has been debased
into all-devouring egotism. "
Nathaniel Hawthorne
The Blithcdale Romance
Welcome to one of the most
top-heavy institutions in the
world; all chiefs and scarcely an
indian to be seen. Or as Huey
Long put it, "Every Man a King."
Yes, indeed, one thing we have
plenty of here on The Farm is
people who have arrived. If you
weren't student body president or
captain of the football team, it's
only because you were too busy
editing the school paper and
taking college courses on the side.
You're a clever dude, all right.
Aren't we all . . . And now, after a
sparkling high school
performance, you are ready to
tackle the big problems; life,
death, war, and eternity. The
world had better move over and
make room.

This may or may not have been
a part of your thinking as you
prepared to enter Stanford.
Whether or not it was, though,
you will soon see that this
assertive self-righteous approach is
fairly common among members of
our community, especially in
relation to politics. Many seem to
feel that if those in power would
only take their advice, most of the
world's problems would
disappear. If self-assurance were a
sign of infallibility, Stanford
would indeed be a treasure-trove
of wisdom.
Truth and Justice
Probably by Christmas, and
certainly by the end of the year,
you will see this approach carried
to its ultimate paranoic absurdity.
Student radicals, as dogmatic and
anticeptically pure as any Pope
ever was, will make a concerted
effort to disrupt the activities and
deface the facilities of this
university. All will be done in the
name of Truth and Justice.
With full visions of grandeur,
and the unquestioning allegiance
of Dudley Do-Right, they will
commit acts which would be
universally condemned but for the
"urgency" of their cause. For
they seek nothing less than the
earthly salvation of mankind, by
the deliverance of America from
her corrupt and immoral ways.
The New England ducking stool is
no longer an adequate tool for
enlightening those with views
heretical to their own. So they
have developed a fistful of other
tools for dealing with the
problem.
Closed-minded Idealism
Whatever one may think of
today's governmental policies and

social values, and however messed
up he finds the state of mankind,
there is one thing to keep in mind;
closed-minded idealism and
intolerance isn't going to ease
tensions or lead to any kind of
peace. In fact, this very attitude
has done much to get us into
trouble. The Vietnam war, blindly
fought in the name of Democracy
and against Communism, is only
the most recent example. The
self-appointed redeemer is nothing
new; he has long been a common
figure in America.
The hazards of egotistical
crusading are all the greater here,
at Stanford, where self-assurance
finds a natural ally in past success.
And you, as freshman, must be
especially wary as, in the coming
weeks, you begin to seek out the
associations and life-style which
will characterize your years at
Stanford. For far from the
solution which he claims to be,
the "infallible" activist is a large
part of the problem. We certainly
won't save the world without a
good deal of toleration and good
will, and neither characteristic is
especially apparent in the fanatic's
constitution.
(Don Ayer is President of the
Stanford Young Republicans.)
