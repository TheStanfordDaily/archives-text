# Critics And Public Applaud New Time Schedule By Hall
## 
### JOHNATHAN DEDMON 
Hailed by Time magazine as "a
book for people with class," the
312 th printing of the Stanford
Time Schedule is breaking sales
records across the campus.
The book, a paperback
published by the Stanford
University Press, is the moving
story of how a university is
organized. From its blunt,
hardhitting beginning of "The
Order of Registration Procedure,"
the book traces chronologically
the sad but true history of each
department, building to the

stirring climax — a map of
Stanford University.
Then comes the final
denouement of Practice
Programs which, in the immortal
words of the book, the reader is
left "to fill out and save for future
conference with your advisor."
The book's author, Harvey
Hall, who uses the pen name of
"The Registrar," claims that in
writing the book he was greatly
influenced by Hugh
Nameitwevegotit's monumental
work, "The Sears Roebuck
Catalogue."
Students note the book is
especially exciting due to its
sharp, biting insights into life as
it's really lived at Stanford. At one

point Hall, carried away by the
dramatic greatness of his material,
cries out to the reader, "Please fill
out Directory cards clearly and
carefully," and then, "Complete
steps outlined on stub of student
body card." If alienated,
unregistered man fails to achieve
this, warns Hall, he will be forced
"to incur service charges and
possible cancellation of
enrollment for the quarter."
It is not yet known whether
Hall has sold the movie rights to
the book or not. However, at a
cocktail and autographing party
given by Hall in the Information
booth of the Old Union last night,
it was overheard that Twentieth
Century Fox has acquired the
rights and plans a movie along the
lines of Frankenstein Returns, in
which Dustin Hoffman and
Katherine Ross try to equal their
former Academy Award winning
roles in a film entitled "The
Graduate Re-registers."
Although the amount
Twentieth Century Fox has paid
for the rights remains undisclosed,
the figure was heard to be so large
that some people are already
calling Harvey, "The Cash
Registrar."
Hall is currently working on a
more extensive work entitled
Courses and Degrees, 1971-2,
which should be released some
time next year.
