# Labor Organizations May Soon Gain University Recognition On Campus
## 
### ED KOHN 
Several campus labor movements
continued to gain strength during the
summer in the wake of a National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
decision to take jurisdiction over larger
colleges and universities.
Popularly known as the
Cornell-Syracuse decision, the ruling
could, in effect, force the University to
recognize one or more on-campus labor
unions for the first time. Shop
employees at the Stanford University
Press are paid union wages but are not
considered full-fledged members of the
printing industry's unions.
A series of NLRB hearings into the
labor situation began Sept. 15 in San
Francisco to determine the appropriate
"bargaining unit" or units into which
University employees could be
classified. If the NLRB does determine
that a bargaining unit can be formed
here, the employees effected will vote
in a secret-ballot election to approve or
reject the move toward unionization
and, if approved, to select one or more
unions from those asking
representation rights.
The hearings, which have extended
over a two-week period, are "about half
over," according to Robert M. Nelson,
the University's Director of Personnel
and Employee Relations.
At least seven parties have officially
expressed interest in becoming

bargaining agents for Stanford
employees, ranging from the Teamsters
Union, which holds signed statements
of support from almost all of the
Physical Plant workers, to the
Construction and General Laborers
Union, which, so far as can be
determined, has no on-campus support.
Campus Groups
Four groups presently on campus
have asked for University recognition:
the United Stanford Employees (USE),
the largest organization, whose 30 0
members come from many parts of the
campus; the Stanford Employees
Association (SEA), a practically
dormant organization supported by the
California School Employees
Association; the International
Association of Fire Fighters
(AFL-CIO), which is seeking bargaining
rights for most of the firemen; and the
Stanford Police Officers Association,
which is seeking to bargain on behalf of
most of the police force.
Three other groups, presently not
officially represented on campus, are
interested in gaining University
recognition to bargain for different
units of Stanford employees. The
Teamsters Union has mounted an
extensive effort to organize the
Physical Plant; the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
(IBEW) is interested in representing the
campus electricians; and the
Construction and General Laborers
Union has also entered an intervening
plea in the NLRB hearings.
The Machinists Union has also
reportedly expressed an interest in
some small units of Stanford employees
as well.
University Position
The University apparently is not
challenging the NLRB's right to
exercise jurisdiction over the campus. It
has, however, expressed a strong
interest in the composition of the
"bargaining units." According to a
memo to all employees issued 10 days
ago by Nelson, the University's position
can be summed up as follows:
.. only the following staff
bargaining units are appropriate: First,
all non-supervisory, non-professional

employees of Stanford, within
California, excluding employees of
Stanford University Hospital (a
separate employer not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Board), excluding
the employees of the Stanford
University Press who are currently
represented, and excluding students,
part-time and casual employees, guards,
and confidential employees; Second,
the members of the Stanford Police
Department, who by law are not
permitted to be in the same unit with
the rest of the staff."
One of the newest groups to enter
the campus labor picture is the Workers
Action Caucus (WAC), a part of the
USE. The group, known last spring as
the Stanford Workers Against the War,
has entered an intervening plea in the
NLRB hearings and is being represented
there by one of its members.
Action Caucus
WAC, which is comprised of
"radical, left-liberal and revolutionary
workers," according to a spokesman,
actively supports the Palo Alto Tenants
Union (PATU), the newly-established
child care center, the Off-ROTC
Movement, the United Front, and
"relates to the Radical Caucus."
Bob Griffin, a Hansen lab
technician, said that the group would
"work with the students." He said,
however, that the caucus wants to
remain autonomous and "doesn't want
to be co-opted by the students, not
even the revolutionary students." He
said that two current objectives of the
group are "to try to get the Law
Commune to give free legal aid to the
workers when they need it"and to
"organize a baby-sitting service that
would allow workers to attend political
meetings at night while interested
students take care of their children."
Griffin said that the group was also
interested in strengthening the new
Stanford Coalition, which he said
includes three groups of black workers
organizing at the medical center and a
campus-wide group composed of
Chicanos and Latinos.
Five Point Program
WAC advocates a five-point program

for action within the Stanford
community:
—"Struggle against oppression of
Black, Brown, and other Third World
peoples.
—"The right to actively express our
political beliefs.
—"Struggle against the oppression of
women.
—"Carry on the struggle against
America's expanding wars in Southeast
Asia and all other areas of the world.
—"Resist the attack on living
standards."
The group also published, during the
summer, a leaflet showing a dollar bill
in a clenched fist with the headline,
"They lie." The poster described the
workers' position on the financing of
the child care center and contained a
strong denunciation of the University's
administration.
Broader Issues
WAC's parent group, USE, originally
decided to refrain from entering the
NLRB hearings "so that we would not
bias the hearings either for or against
the other groups," Dr. Roland A.
Finston, president of the group, said.
"However, we came to understand
that there would be broader issues
raised in the hearings that would effect
the bargaining prospects for the future,
so we intervened," Finston said.
A health physics employee, Finston
added that the group was testifying at
the hearing "to clarify the types of
work that are done at the University,
and to clarify as best we can the
working conditions here."
USE's first request when it
intervened was that the hearings be
changed from daytime sessions in San
Francisco to evening and weekend
sessions closer to Palo Alto so that
more of the workers could attend. The
hearing examiner rejected the request.
The NLRB hearings continue next
week in San Francisco. A decision is
not expected for several months
because of the large amount of
testimony already taken that must be
evaluated before a conclusion can be
reached.

—"Struggle against oppression of
Black, Brown, and other Third World
peoples.
—"The right to actively express our
political beliefs.
—"Struggle against the oppression of
women.
—"Carry on the struggle against
America's expanding wars in Southeast
Asia and all other areas of the world.
—"Resist the attack on living
standards."
The group also published, during the
summer, a leaflet showing a dollar bill
in a clenched fist with the headline,
"They lie." The poster described the
workers' position on the financing of
the child care center and contained a
strong denunciation of the University's
administration.
Broader Issues
WAC's parent group, USE, originally
decided to refrain from entering the
NLRB hearings "so that we would not
bias the hearings either for or against
the other groups," Dr. Roland A.
Finston, president of the group, said.
"However, we came to understand
that there would be broader issues
raised in the hearings that would effect
the bargaining prospects for the future,
so we intervened," Finston said.
A health physics employee, Finston
added that the group was testifying at
the hearing "to clarify the types of
work that are done at the University,
and to clarify as best we can the
working conditions here."
USE's first request when it
intervened was that the hearings be
changed from daytime sessions in San
Francisco to evening and weekend
sessions closer to Palo Alto so that
more of the workers could attend. The
hearing examiner rejected the request.
The NLRB hearings continue next
week in San Francisco. A decision is
not expected for several months
because of the large amount of
testimony already taken that must be
evaluated before a conclusion can be
reached.

MADONNA OF THE REG LlNE—September marks the beginning for a lot of
things ranging from financial and academic crises to nativity scenes.
Several campus labor movements
continued to gain strength during the
summer in the wake of a National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
decision to take jurisdiction over larger
colleges and universities.
Popularly known as the
Cornell-Syracuse decision, the ruling
could, in effect, force the University to
recognize one or more on-campus labor
unions for the first time. Shop
employees at the Stanford University
Press are paid union wages but are not
considered full-fledged members of the
printing industry's unions.
A series of NLRB hearings into the
labor situation began Sept. 15 in San
Francisco to determine the appropriate
"bargaining unit" or units into which
University employees could be
classified. If the NLRB does determine
that a bargaining unit can be formed
here, the employees effected will vote
in a secret-ballot election to approve or
reject the move toward unionization
and, if approved, to select one or more
unions from those asking
representation rights.
The hearings, which have extended
over a two-week period, are "about half
over," according to Robert M. Nelson,
the University's Director of Personnel
and Employee Relations.
At least seven parties have officially
expressed interest in becoming

bargaining agents for Stanford
employees, ranging from the Teamsters
Union, which holds signed statements
of support from almost all of the
Physical Plant workers, to the
Construction and General Laborers
Union, which, so far as can be
determined, has no on-campus support.
Campus Groups
Four groups presently on campus
have asked for University recognition:
the United Stanford Employees (USE),
the largest organization, whose 30 0
members come from many parts of the
campus; the Stanford Employees
Association (SEA), a practically
dormant organization supported by the
California School Employees
Association; the International
Association of Fire Fighters
(AFL-CIO), which is seeking bargaining
rights for most of the firemen; and the
Stanford Police Officers Association,
which is seeking to bargain on behalf of
most of the police force.
Three other groups, presently not
officially represented on campus, are
interested in gaining University
recognition to bargain for different
units of Stanford employees. The
Teamsters Union has mounted an
extensive effort to organize the
Physical Plant; the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
(IBEW) is interested in representing the
campus electricians; and the
Construction and General Laborers
Union has also entered an intervening
plea in the NLRB hearings.
The Machinists Union has also
reportedly expressed an interest in
some small units of Stanford employees
as well.
University Position
The University apparently is not
challenging the NLRB's right to
exercise jurisdiction over the campus. It
has, however, expressed a strong
interest in the composition of the
"bargaining units." According to a
memo to all employees issued 10 days
ago by Nelson, the University's position
can be summed up as follows:
.. only the following staff
bargaining units are appropriate: First,
all non-supervisory, non-professional

employees of Stanford, within
California, excluding employees of
Stanford University Hospital (a
separate employer not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Board), excluding
the employees of the Stanford
University Press who are currently
represented, and excluding students,
part-time and casual employees, guards,
and confidential employees; Second,
the members of the Stanford Police
Department, who by law are not
permitted to be in the same unit with
the rest of the staff."
One of the newest groups to enter
the campus labor picture is the Workers
Action Caucus (WAC), a part of the
USE. The group, known last spring as
the Stanford Workers Against the War,
has entered an intervening plea in the
NLRB hearings and is being represented
there by one of its members.
Action Caucus
WAC, which is comprised of
"radical, left-liberal and revolutionary
workers," according to a spokesman,
actively supports the Palo Alto Tenants
Union (PATU), the newly-established
child care center, the Off-ROTC
Movement, the United Front, and
"relates to the Radical Caucus."
Bob Griffin, a Hansen lab
technician, said that the group would
"work with the students." He said,
however, that the caucus wants to
remain autonomous and "doesn't want
to be co-opted by the students, not
even the revolutionary students." He
said that two current objectives of the
group are "to try to get the Law
Commune to give free legal aid to the
workers when they need it"and to
"organize a baby-sitting service that
would allow workers to attend political
meetings at night while interested
students take care of their children."
Griffin said that the group was also
interested in strengthening the new
Stanford Coalition, which he said
includes three groups of black workers
organizing at the medical center and a
campus-wide group composed of
Chicanos and Latinos.
Five Point Program
WAC advocates a five-point program

for action within the Stanford
community:
—"Struggle against oppression of
Black, Brown, and other Third World
peoples.
—"The right to actively express our
political beliefs.
—"Struggle against the oppression of
women.
—"Carry on the struggle against
America's expanding wars in Southeast
Asia and all other areas of the world.
—"Resist the attack on living
standards."

jurisdiction of the Board), excluding
the employees of the Stanford
University Press who are currently
represented, and excluding students,
part-time and casual employees, guards,
and confidential employees; Second,
the members of the Stanford Police
Department, who by law are not
permitted to be in the same unit with
the rest of the staff."
One of the newest groups to enter
the campus labor picture is the Workers
Action Caucus (WAC), a part of the
USE. The group, known last spring as
the Stanford Workers Against the War,
has entered an intervening plea in the
NLRB hearings and is being represented
there by one of its members.
Action Caucus
WAC, which is comprised of
"radical, left-liberal and revolutionary
workers," according to a spokesman,
actively supports the Palo Alto Tenants
Union (PATU), the newly-established
child care center, the Off-ROTC
Movement, the United Front, and
"relates to the Radical Caucus."
Bob Griffin, a Hansen lab
technician, said that the group would
"work with the students." He said,
however, that the caucus wants to
remain autonomous and "doesn't want
to be co-opted by the students, not
even the revolutionary students." He
said that two current objectives of the
group are "to try to get the Law
Commune to give free legal aid to the
workers when they need it"and to
"organize a baby-sitting service that
would allow workers to attend political
meetings at night while interested
students take care of their children."
Griffin said that the group was also
interested in strengthening the new
Stanford Coalition, which he said
includes three groups of black workers
organizing at the medical center and a
campus-wide group composed of
Chicanos and Latinos.
Five Point Program
WAC advocates a five-point program

for action within the Stanford
community:
—"Struggle against oppression of
Black, Brown, and other Third World
peoples.
—"The right to actively express our
political beliefs.
—"Struggle against the oppression of
women.
—"Carry on the struggle against
America's expanding wars in Southeast
Asia and all other areas of the world.
—"Resist the attack on living
standards."
The group also published, during the
summer, a leaflet showing a dollar bill
in a clenched fist with the headline,
"They lie." The poster described the
workers' position on the financing of
the child care center and contained a
strong denunciation of the University's
administration.
Broader Issues
WAC's parent group, USE, originally
decided to refrain from entering the
NLRB hearings "so that we would not
bias the hearings either for or against
the other groups," Dr. Roland A.
Finston, president of the group, said.
"However, we came to understand
that there would be broader issues
raised in the hearings that would effect
the bargaining prospects for the future,
so we intervened," Finston said.
A health physics employee, Finston
added that the group was testifying at
the hearing "to clarify the types of
work that are done at the University,
and to clarify as best we can the
working conditions here."
USE's first request when it
intervened was that the hearings be
changed from daytime sessions in San
Francisco to evening and weekend
sessions closer to Palo Alto so that
more of the workers could attend. The
hearing examiner rejected the request.
The NLRB hearings continue next
week in San Francisco. A decision is
not expected for several months
because of the large amount of
testimony already taken that must be
evaluated before a conclusion can be
reached.

MADONNA OF THE REG LlNE—September marks the beginning for a lot of
things ranging from financial and academic crises to nativity scenes.
Several campus labor movements
continued to gain strength during the
summer in the wake of a National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
decision to take jurisdiction over larger
colleges and universities.
Popularly known as the
Cornell-Syracuse decision, the ruling
could, in effect, force the University to
recognize one or more on-campus labor
unions for the first time. Shop
employees at the Stanford University
Press are paid union wages but are not
considered full-fledged members of the
printing industry's unions.
A series of NLRB hearings into the
labor situation began Sept. 15 in San
Francisco to determine the appropriate
"bargaining unit" or units into which
University employees could be
classified. If the NLRB does determine
that a bargaining unit can be formed
here, the employees effected will vote
in a secret-ballot election to approve or
reject the move toward unionization
and, if approved, to select one or more
unions from those asking
representation rights.
The hearings, which have extended
over a two-week period, are "about half
over," according to Robert M. Nelson,
the University's Director of Personnel
and Employee Relations.
At least seven parties have officially
expressed interest in becoming

bargaining agents for Stanford
employees, ranging from the Teamsters
Union, which holds signed statements
of support from almost all of the
Physical Plant workers, to the
Construction and General Laborers
Union, which, so far as can be
determined, has no on-campus support.
Campus Groups
Four groups presently on campus
have asked for University recognition:
the United Stanford Employees (USE),
the largest organization, whose 30 0
members come from many parts of the
campus; the Stanford Employees
Association (SEA), a practically
dormant organization supported by the
California School Employees
Association; the International
Association of Fire Fighters
(AFL-CIO), which is seeking bargaining
rights for most of the firemen; and the
Stanford Police Officers Association,
which is seeking to bargain on behalf of
most of the police force.
Three other groups, presently not
officially represented on campus, are
interested in gaining University
recognition to bargain for different
units of Stanford employees. The
Teamsters Union has mounted an
extensive effort to organize the
Physical Plant; the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
(IBEW) is interested in representing the
campus electricians; and the
Construction and General Laborers
Union has also entered an intervening
plea in the NLRB hearings.
The Machinists Union has also
reportedly expressed an interest in
some small units of Stanford employees
as well.
University Position
The University apparently is not
challenging the NLRB's right to
exercise jurisdiction over the campus. It
has, however, expressed a strong
interest in the composition of the
"bargaining units." According to a
memo to all employees issued 10 days
ago by Nelson, the University's position
can be summed up as follows:
.. only the following staff
bargaining units are appropriate: First,
all non-supervisory, non-professional

employees of Stanford, within
California, excluding employees of
Stanford University Hospital (a
separate employer not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Board), excluding
the employees of the Stanford
University Press who are currently
represented, and excluding students,
part-time and casual employees, guards,
and confidential employees; Second,
the members of the Stanford Police
Department, who by law are not
permitted to be in the same unit with
the rest of the staff."

Union, which holds signed statements
of support from almost all of the
Physical Plant workers, to the
Construction and General Laborers
Union, which, so far as can be
determined, has no on-campus support.
Campus Groups
Four groups presently on campus
have asked for University recognition:
the United Stanford Employees (USE),
the largest organization, whose 30 0
members come from many parts of the
campus; the Stanford Employees
Association (SEA), a practically
dormant organization supported by the
California School Employees
Association; the International
Association of Fire Fighters
(AFL-CIO), which is seeking bargaining
rights for most of the firemen; and the
Stanford Police Officers Association,
which is seeking to bargain on behalf of
most of the police force.
Three other groups, presently not
officially represented on campus, are
interested in gaining University
recognition to bargain for different
units of Stanford employees. The
Teamsters Union has mounted an
extensive effort to organize the
Physical Plant; the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
(IBEW) is interested in representing the
campus electricians; and the
Construction and General Laborers
Union has also entered an intervening
plea in the NLRB hearings.
The Machinists Union has also
reportedly expressed an interest in
some small units of Stanford employees
as well.
University Position
The University apparently is not
challenging the NLRB's right to
exercise jurisdiction over the campus. It
has, however, expressed a strong
interest in the composition of the
"bargaining units." According to a
memo to all employees issued 10 days
ago by Nelson, the University's position
can be summed up as follows:
.. only the following staff
bargaining units are appropriate: First,
all non-supervisory, non-professional

employees of Stanford, within
California, excluding employees of
Stanford University Hospital (a
separate employer not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Board), excluding
the employees of the Stanford
University Press who are currently
represented, and excluding students,
part-time and casual employees, guards,
and confidential employees; Second,
the members of the Stanford Police
Department, who by law are not
permitted to be in the same unit with
the rest of the staff."
One of the newest groups to enter
the campus labor picture is the Workers
Action Caucus (WAC), a part of the
USE. The group, known last spring as
the Stanford Workers Against the War,
has entered an intervening plea in the
NLRB hearings and is being represented
there by one of its members.
Action Caucus
WAC, which is comprised of
"radical, left-liberal and revolutionary
workers," according to a spokesman,
actively supports the Palo Alto Tenants
Union (PATU), the newly-established
child care center, the Off-ROTC
Movement, the United Front, and
"relates to the Radical Caucus."
Bob Griffin, a Hansen lab
technician, said that the group would
"work with the students." He said,
however, that the caucus wants to
remain autonomous and "doesn't want
to be co-opted by the students, not
even the revolutionary students." He
said that two current objectives of the
group are "to try to get the Law
Commune to give free legal aid to the
workers when they need it"and to
"organize a baby-sitting service that
would allow workers to attend political
meetings at night while interested
students take care of their children."
Griffin said that the group was also
interested in strengthening the new
Stanford Coalition, which he said
includes three groups of black workers
organizing at the medical center and a
campus-wide group composed of
Chicanos and Latinos.
Five Point Program
WAC advocates a five-point program

for action within the Stanford
community:
—"Struggle against oppression of
Black, Brown, and other Third World
peoples.
—"The right to actively express our
political beliefs.
—"Struggle against the oppression of
women.
—"Carry on the struggle against
America's expanding wars in Southeast
Asia and all other areas of the world.
—"Resist the attack on living
standards."
The group also published, during the
summer, a leaflet showing a dollar bill
in a clenched fist with the headline,
"They lie." The poster described the
workers' position on the financing of
the child care center and contained a
strong denunciation of the University's
administration.
Broader Issues
WAC's parent group, USE, originally
decided to refrain from entering the
NLRB hearings "so that we would not
bias the hearings either for or against
the other groups," Dr. Roland A.
Finston, president of the group, said.
"However, we came to understand
that there would be broader issues
raised in the hearings that would effect
the bargaining prospects for the future,
so we intervened," Finston said.
A health physics employee, Finston
added that the group was testifying at
the hearing "to clarify the types of
work that are done at the University,
and to clarify as best we can the
working conditions here."
USE's first request when it
intervened was that the hearings be
changed from daytime sessions in San
Francisco to evening and weekend
sessions closer to Palo Alto so that
more of the workers could attend. The
hearing examiner rejected the request.
The NLRB hearings continue next
week in San Francisco. A decision is
not expected for several months
because of the large amount of
testimony already taken that must be
evaluated before a conclusion can be
reached.
