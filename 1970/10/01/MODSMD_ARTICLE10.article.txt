THE BUST BOOK: WHAT TO
DO UNTIL THE LAWYER
COMES
Grove Press
$1.25
by ANDY ISRAEL
The BUST BOOK is not a
Hugh Hefner publication, neither
is it a text for an art history class.
It is a handbook of legal first aid,
telling in layman's language what
is involved in arrest, detention,
arraignment, and trial. Anyone
who stands a chance of being
arrested for either their political or
recreational activity (which seems
to include a large portion of the
Stanford student body) should
put this book at the top of their
reading list, especially if they have
never been busted.
The book is not a
do-it-yourself legal manual, rather
it tells what to do between the
time that you do it and the lawyer
arrives. The four authors—Kathy
Boudin, Brian Click, Eleanor
Raskin, and Gustin
Reichbach—are movement people

who have found lawyers
invaluable throughout busts and
trials and continuously stress that
defendants should refuse to say
anything until counsel is present.
While the paperback attempts
to outline personal rights and
define legal boundaries, the
authors emphasize that the legal
system is a tool of the state and
that equal justice is a hollow
concept. If you are young they
say, justice will be difficult; if you
are young and radical it will be
even more difficult; and if you are
black it will be impossible.
The first section of the book
which deals with demonstrations
is a sort of radical guide to
etiquette. It tells what should be
worn, who to go with, what to do,
and what to say. Pants with the
pockets sewn up are
recommended to make it difficult
for the police to plant things like
drugs or weapons. Vaseline is
advised for protection against
mace, and other advice indicates
that the authors are concerned
with violence on the part of both
police and demonstrators.

The second part which deals
with the bust can be summarized
in two words: DON'T TALK.
Emphasis is made that the police
will attempt to gather evidence
either by being very tough or by
acting very friendly and special
warnings are made against
fraternizing with "the enemy."
Remaining sections deal with
arraignment and bail, witnesses,
trials, and legal defense. More
procedures and rights are
summarized with the overlying
attitude that with careful planning
it is possible to use loopholes and
make deals to minimize the extent
of punishment or to be set free.
Even those who don't agree
with the tactics of violent
confrontations and
demonstrations and don't expect
to be caught in such situations
will find the book valuable as it
relates to drug arrests and arrests
in general. The reader who never
intends to expose himself to the
possibility of arrest will probably
still appreciate the book's
extremely practical "what-to-do,"
approach to the legal system.

is involved in arrest, detention,
arraignment, and trial. Anyone
who stands a chance of being
arrested for either their political or
recreational activity (which seems
to include a large portion of the
Stanford student body) should
put this book at the top of their
reading list, especially if they have
never been busted.
The book is not a
do-it-yourself legal manual, rather
it tells what to do between the
time that you do it and the lawyer
arrives. The four authors—Kathy
Boudin, Brian Click, Eleanor
Raskin, and Gustin
Reichbach—are movement people

who have found lawyers
invaluable throughout busts and
trials and continuously stress that
defendants should refuse to say
anything until counsel is present.
While the paperback attempts
to outline personal rights and
define legal boundaries, the
authors emphasize that the legal
system is a tool of the state and
that equal justice is a hollow
concept. If you are young they
say, justice will be difficult; if you
are young and radical it will be
even more difficult; and if you are
black it will be impossible.
The first section of the book
which deals with demonstrations
is a sort of radical guide to
etiquette. It tells what should be
worn, who to go with, what to do,
and what to say. Pants with the
pockets sewn up are
recommended to make it difficult
for the police to plant things like
drugs or weapons. Vaseline is
advised for protection against
mace, and other advice indicates
that the authors are concerned
with violence on the part of both
police and demonstrators.

The second part which deals
with the bust can be summarized
in two words: DON'T TALK.
Emphasis is made that the police
will attempt to gather evidence
either by being very tough or by
acting very friendly and special
warnings are made against
fraternizing with "the enemy."
Remaining sections deal with
arraignment and bail, witnesses,
trials, and legal defense. More
procedures and rights are
summarized with the overlying
attitude that with careful planning
it is possible to use loopholes and
make deals to minimize the extent
of punishment or to be set free.
Even those who don't agree
with the tactics of violent
confrontations and
demonstrations and don't expect
to be caught in such situations
will find the book valuable as it
relates to drug arrests and arrests
in general. The reader who never
intends to expose himself to the
possibility of arrest will probably
still appreciate the book's
extremely practical "what-to-do,"
approach to the legal system.

The BUST BOOK is not a
Hugh Hefner publication, neither
is it a text for an art history class.
It is a handbook of legal first aid,
telling in layman's language what
is involved in arrest, detention,
arraignment, and trial. Anyone
who stands a chance of being
arrested for either their political or
recreational activity (which seems
to include a large portion of the
