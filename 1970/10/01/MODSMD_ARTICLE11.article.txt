# The
						Female Nader
## 
### BROOKE SHEARER 
Everyone claims that women
play no role in the life of
consumer expert, Ralph Nader.
When General Motors asked
private detective Vincent Gillen
"to get something somewhere on
this guy ... get him out of their
hair. . . shut him up," Gillen's
answer was that Nader didn't fall
for any of the girls who had been
employed as "sex lures," and as
far as Gillen could tell Nader had
virtually no social life at all.
Disappointingly, General
Motors found Gillen's conclusion
correct—there was not a "damn
thing wrong." The price they paid
for that information was
approximately $425 ,000—one
third went to lawyers' fees. The
charge—invading the privacy of
the clean-living bachelor.
Once
Once an attractive female
journalist, at least so the story
goes, confided to a friend of
Ralph's that she would like to see
more of the dark, serious
crusader. The reply filtered back
that since he, Ralph, could not
consider marriage at this time,
dating the girl would be unfair.
Although Nader's career and
his stark surroundings (no car,
unlisted telephone number, $100
a month flat) seem to discourage

romance, there are women in his
life—three of them, his mother,
Rose (Bouziane) and his two older
sisters, Clair and Laura. Laura, 39,
the younger of the two sisters is
one of 15 females who are full
professors at the University of
California, Berkeley.
Tall, raven-haired, her brother's
look-alike, anthropologist Laura
has this to say about the way in
which Ralph is trying to affect
social change: "1 think the way
which my brother works is great,
but the job requires more than
twenty people serving as Naders'
Raiders. Most people are
relinguishing their responsibilities
and this is infecting modern
society all along the line."
"The big preoccupation these
days is with street crimes," she
continues, "but anyone who
pollutes is being just as deadly as a
man who shoots, but it isn't as
immediately frightening, so there
isn't enough legal concern about
it. This whole focus has to be
broadened."
Role Model
Miss Nader like her brother is a
role model for today's youth,
especially for girls. As an
anthropology professor, wife of
research physicist Dr. Norman
Milleron, and mother of Nadia 6
and Tarek 3, she balances both
public and private responsibilities.
Of women in general she speaks
rather harshly.
"Women outside of the
professional sphere," she says,
"fail to utilize their own power.
This power is their leisure time,
but they don't use it. They seem
to lack respect for themselves and
consequently don't feel mutual
respect for one another. If they
did regard themselves as
responsible, capable individuals
they would be active and creative
in politics, ecology, peace
movements and consumer affairs,
etc.
"In my family you could be
anything you wanted to be. It
didn't matter whether you were a
boy or a girl, that is, beyond a
certain point. If you wanted to do
something or become someone
you did it, and the family helped
all that they could.
"Furthermore, we were taught
to believe that you took from
society, so you had to give to
society."
Family
The Nader family consists of 2
other children in addition to
Ralph and Laura. The oldest,
Shafeek is an official with the
American Association of Junior
College Education in Washington,
D.C. Nearest to him is sister Clair,
a political scientist and research
associate at Oak Ridge National
Laboratories in Tennessee. Clair
graduated from Smith College,
earned an M.A. and Ph.D. in
political science from Columbia

University and joined Oak Ridge
in 1964. She specializes in
international politics, scientific
technology and public policy.
"Academicians," she says,
"generally resist government
involvement. Such involvement,
they think, destroys their
objectivity. But that's been
changing rapidly because the
stakes in society today are so high
that we need all the expertise we
can get."
The Nader parents, Rose and
Nathra, are Lebanese immigrants
who came to the U.S. in 1925.
They now manage the Highland
Arms, a restaurant-bakery in
Winsted, Connecticut.
The Nader home provided an
atmosphere of learning, Laura
recalls. Her father would pose
imagined social problems to the
family as they sat around the
dinner table. "This had a deep
influence on Ralph," she says.
"Our parents simply taught us to
know and do as much as
possible."
New Baby
In addition to crowded classes
this winter, Laura Nader is
expecting her third and "probably
last child." Her mother will arrive
soon to help her through the few
days of hospitalization.
"Education seems to be killing
women's common sense.
Remember when the
announcement was made that
baby foods were not wholly safe.
Many mothers called up their
doctors in a panic. 'What can I
feed my baby?' they asked. Most
doctors suggested that they try
putting the family dinner in a
blender. What do mothers think
babies eat anyway, a magic
potion?
"I don't believe in
intellectualizing about how my
children should be raised and
what my role to my daughter
should be. I follow my mother's
advice—'throw away the book and
be a mother."
As an anthropologist, Miss
Nader's specialty is the Zapotec
Indians of Juahaca, Mexico. She
studied at the Center for
Advanced Study in Behaviorial
Sciences in Palo Alto from 1963
to 1964, authored a filmscript,
"To Make The Balance" in 1966,
and was editor of a special issue of
American Anthropologist in '65,
titled "Ethnography of Law."
The Nader offspring—Ralph,
Laura, Clair, and Shafeek— have
not yet run for any public office.
They are too busy exercising the
office of citizenship in their own
private, effective ways.
"My mother was once asked,"
says Laura, "what made her
children tick, and she answered:
'What's more important is why
some other people do not tick."
Good question.
