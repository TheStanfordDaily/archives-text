### PHIL MYERS 
Four out of five graduating
seniors condone confrontation
tactics as either necessary or
effective in procuring social
change according to two UC
Berkeley researchers.
Polling 1542 seniors last spring
on ten campuses of varied
characteristics across the nation,
the investigators asked this
question: "Considering social
conflict within our society and its
expression on certain campuses,
to what degree do you feel
confrontation tactics are
necessary or effective?" Those
polled were predominantly white,
middle class, above-average
scholars.
Slightly over half the
respondents answered
"Non-violent mass protests or

demonstrations are the only
feasible way to persuade officials
to respect the will of the people,"
one of a choice of five answers.
An additional nineteen percent
of the participants responded that
"The use of disruptive tactics and
the destruction of property is
often necessary in order to change
the status quo."
Nine percent said, "Although
some may get badly hurt, actual
physical confrontation and
violence must, at times, be
resorted to in order to effect
social change."
Twenty percent of the
graduating seniors opposed
confrontation tactics according to
Sarah Cirese and Jeff Koon, two
staffers of the Center for Research
