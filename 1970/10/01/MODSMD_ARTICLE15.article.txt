# Report LSD Causes Damage To Rats
## 
### 
LSD fed to pregnant rats has
caused biochemical defects in
their offspring, a Chicago Medical
School pharmacologist has
reported.
The scientist, Dr. Velayaudhan
Nair, observed no gross
malformations or chromosomal
damage in the offspring of rats
exposed to LSD during
pregnancy. Such physical damage
has frequently been reported by
other investigators.
"However, most important and
sinister are the subtle impairments
in the development of
biochemical systems in brain and
liver," Dr. Nair observed.
According to the
pharmacologist, the most
significant damage appeared to be
the suppression of the essential
brain chemical, serotonin.
Another effect was LSD's
apparent inhibitory effect on the
development of liver enzymes
which are responsible for
neutralizing poisons before they
take effect.
LSD's effect on serotonin was
revealed in several behavior
disorders, such as sleep
abnormalities and hypersexuality.

Dr. Nair cautioned that one
could draw no conclusions from
the animal studies that could be
applicable to humans.
"Functional implications of
these findings related to such
factors as behavior, drug action,
and toxicity remain to be
studied," he added.
"Much of the previous work in
this area has been concerned with
obvious birth defects," Dr. Nair
said. "Unlike the gross
abnormalities and malformations,
biochemical or molecular defects
may remain dormant and manifest
themselves later in life as a
functional impairment, a
behavioral disorder, or abnormal
reaction to drugs."
