Anti-War Suit Stalled
SAN FRANCISCO — U.S. District Court Judge George B.
Harris suspended action Wednesday in a suit seeking to have
the Vietnam War declared unconstitutional pending a
decision in a somewhat similar case.
Pierre Noyes, a professor at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, and more than 400 other citizens,
brought the action against President Nixon and other
government officials.
They contend the war is unconstitutional, that it has
been conducted without a required declaration by
Congress, involves illegal expenditure of tax revenues and
violates international law.
The government had asked Harris to dismiss the suit on
grounds the court has no jurisdiction.
In the similar case, U.S. District Court Judge William
Sweigert Tuesday granted the government the right to
appeal his ruling refusing to dismiss a suit brought by three
reservists who challenged legality of the war. It would be
considered by the 9 th Circuit Court of Appeals.
New Mideast Fighting
BERUIT — The Jordanian army launched artillery and
ground attacks Wednesday against two guerrilla-held towns
in Northern Jordan in violation of the latest truce, the
Palestine guerrillas charged.
The three-man Arab truce committee in Amman, the
Jordanian capital, sent Arab observers to investigate. The
two cities are Irbid, 50 miles north of Amman and the
scene of violent fighting in the 11 -day civil war, and
Ramtha, 10 miles to the east.
The Palestine guerrilla charge, broadcast over Damascus
radio, said "the roar of explosions can be clearly heard
from the Syrian border." Ramtha is only five miles from
the frontier.
It called the bombardment "an open violation of the
Cairo agreement" reached Sunday between King Hussein
and guerrilla leader Yasir Arafat to stop the civil war.
A guerrilla communique described the ground attack as
massive. It said the ground forces struck after a day-long
artillery bombardment of Irbid and Ramtha.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, kings and world leaders
gathered in Cairo for the funeral Thursday of Gamal Abdel
Nasser.
In some instances violence flared. Arab mourners in the
occupied Gaza Strip threw a burning tire at an Israeli army
vehicle and shouted "God is greater than Israel" when
Israeli troops fired over their head.
Draft Loophole Plugged
WASHINGTON — Still plugging holes in its draft lottery
system, the administration has knocked down the chance of
escaping induction by becoming 1 -A late in the year.
The Selective Service System announced Wednesday a
three-month extension of draft liability for any 1 -A man
whose draft board has reached his lottery number but who
has not been drafted by the end of the year.
The aim is to prevent the unfairness of drafting one man

according to the lottery of last December and then passing
up another man with a lower lottery number just because
he became available along with a crowd of other
low-numbered men after the manpower needs were filled.
That is the kind of situation created by the mid-year
graduation of hundreds of thousands of college students,
many holding lower numbers than those already called.
Seven Hijackers Freed
LONDON — Guerrilla heroine Leila Khaled and six other
Arab commandos were freed Wednesday night and flown to
Cairo early Thursday as Britain, West Germany and
Switzerland met the price for release of hostages from
September's multiple airliner hijackings. The last six
hostages, all Americans, headed for home earlier
Wednesday.
Leila, who was jailed after failing in her part of the
hijacking extravaganza, left Britain from an RAF base near
London. Her plane stopped at the heavily guarded airports
in Munich, West Germany, Zurich, Switzerland to take on
the other commandos.
All were expected to be in Cairo in time for the funeral
Thursday of Gamal Abdel Nasser.
A police spokesman in Tel Aviv said Wednesday that
Israel had not decided whether to free two detained
Algerians—described by the Israelis as members of the
Algerian secret service-whose release the guerrillas
demanded. They were taken off a British airliner in Tel
Aviv last month.
Agnew Attacks Goodell
SALT LAKE CITY — Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
appealed Wednesday for the ouster in November
congressional elections of the so-called raiical liberals—a
group that he says includes a fellow Republican, Sen.
Charles E. Goodell of New York.
"Respect for Congress in the United States is at its
lowest point in five years," said Agnew in remarks prepared
for a street rally after his arrival in Salt Lake City on the
final leg of a three-day Western campaign swing.
Earlier, Agnew singled out Goodell as a Republican
member of "that awful radical-liberal coalition that has
been obstructing President Nixon's programs."
It was the first time Agnew had cited a fellow
Republican by name. In three weeks of campaigning, he has
said the real contest in November is between moderates and
conservatives backing the Nixon administration and the
"radical-liberals" who control the Senate.
Goodell also had criticism for Agnew Wednesday, taking
sharp issue with the vice president's rejection Tuesday of
the report by the President's Commission on Campus
Unrest.
Goodell said Agnew "'has long been saying that it is the
duty of men in public office to speak out against violence
in our universities" and added:
"That is precisely what this report does—only the report,
unlike the vice president, speaks in balanced and moderate
language."
