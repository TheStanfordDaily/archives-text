# Phony Spouses Buy Football Tickets
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Books of student football
tickets were sold out Tuesday
afternoon among indications that
many were purchased dishonestly.
"Fortunately all the books
went," ticket manager Ted
(Harrow said Wednesday, "but
unfortunately not all went to the
right people."
Glarrow said students who
dishonestly claimed they were
married so they could buy two
season books have prevented
other registered students from
purchasing books.
All 11,000 student books were
gone by 4:10 p.m. Tuesday,
according to Glarrow.
"I thought we should have
serviced all the students by the
end of the sale," Glarrow said.
"We had planned for a space for
everybody."
An undetermined number of
students were turned away from
ticket windows Tuesday and
about a dozen have signed a
waiting list at the athletic
department.
Glarrow said he learned
Monday that students were lying
about spouses in order to be able
to purchase a second set of
tickets.

"I noticed we had a
disproportionate number of
students with cards saying they
were married," Glarrow said. He
then checked at a registration
table where married students had
their registration cards stamped
"married" in order to buy tickets
for spouses.
No proof of marriage was
required to get a card stamped.
Assistant Registrar Robert
Houghton said, "It is the general
feeling here that if a student says
something we like to believe him.
Besides, what can you show to
prove you're married?"
When he was informed of the
possible cheating Monday,
Houghton had a sign installed
saying that students claiming they
were married would be listed as
married in the student directory
and that falsification would be a
violation of the fundamental
standard.
Glarrow said students who
could not buy season books will
be able to purchase endzone seats
for $ 1.5 0, the same per-game cost
of the book tickets.
However, no endzone seats will
be available for the USC game
since the ticket office has already
sold all 8 7 ,000 seats for that
game.
