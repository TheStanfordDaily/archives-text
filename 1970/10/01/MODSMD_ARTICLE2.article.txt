# Talk To Students
## Justice Dept. To Visit 
### JESSE CEDARBAUM 
Top Justice Department officials,
including possibly Attorney General
John Mitchell, will visit Stanford in the
near future as part of a nationwide tour
of colleges designed to improve
communications between that
governmental agency and students.
Stanford is among 5 0 such
"representative" colleges and
universities across the country to be
visited by the Justice Department
officials during October and November.
*
According to James Siena, legal
advisor to President Lyman, the
University received a letter from
Mitchell yesterday requesting that the
Attorney General and members of his
staff be invited "to meet informally
with interested students, in whatever
form (the University) deems
appropriate, and answer questions
about the department's policies and
programs."

The University is not obligated to
have the Justice Department officials
come, he said, but they would most
definitely be "welcome." As of now,
no definite arrangements have been
made, Siena said, but there will
"possibly be some sort of open forum."
When contacted at home about the
announcement, President Lyman was
noncommital. "It seems to be an effort
to give people a chance to talk to them
(the Justice Department) about matters
in which they have a common interest.
It has nothing to due with investigatory
procedures," he added.
The schools to be visited by the
Justice Department representatives are

scattered from Maine to California, and
range in size from Reed College in
Oregon, which has 1200 students, to
the University of Indiana, with an
enrollment of 5 6,0 00 .
Notably absent from the list were
UC Berkeley, Columbia University, and
the University of Wisconsin, scene of
the recent bombing of an Army
research center.
Said one anonymous member of the
Nev Left Project, "We were surprised
to learn that the Justice Department
views Stanford as a 'secure area' and is
planning to send a 'pacification team'
here. Maybe circumstances will soon
change Stanford into a 'free fire zone."
