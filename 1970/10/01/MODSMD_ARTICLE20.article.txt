# New Chairman
## Faculty Senate To Meet 
### 
The Academic Senate opens its third
year this afternoon with a new
chairman who plans to use his position
to prod the Senate to action.
Prof. Sanford Dornbusch of
sociology told the Daily that he plans
to use his post as chairman to stimulate
positive action instead of reaction to
events.
He also affirmed his determination
"to say my piece," and to not allow his
chairman's position to prevent him
from speaking. In the past, Prof.
Dornbusch has not been noted for a

reluctance to voice his views in the
Senate.
Dornbusch hopes that the Senate
will become more involved in setting
priorities for action, instead of allowing
the five member steering committee to
force its view on the Senate, through its
agenda-making power. "We want to be
sure that the steering committee
doesn't become an executive
committee," he said.
The 5 3-man Senate is the primary
mode for the faculty to make decisions
of an academic nature, such as those
concerning courses, degrees, and
credits.
Much of its work is conducted in
committees, which usually have student
members. The body meets every two
weeks.
In its first two years it has
concerned itself to an unusually large
extent with organizing itself, its rules,
and its committees.
Its supporters claim that it is a
non-political body concerned only with
academic and related affairs. Critics
however feel that the non-political
claim is false modesty which obscures
the body's potentially immense power.
They have pointed to the Senate's
flipflop on the ROTC issue as an
example of how senators can change
their minds three times on political
criteria such as how the war in
Indochina is going.
All faculty members with at least
the rank of teaching assistant are
members of the Academic Council,
which holds its quarterly of the year
tomorrow. The Council can request the
Senate to consider matters or overrule
it though it has yet to overturn a
Senate decision.
