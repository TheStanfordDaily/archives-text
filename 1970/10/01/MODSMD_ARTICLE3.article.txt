# Angry At 'White Apathy'
## BSU Cancels Meeting 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The Black Student Union last night
was forced to cancel its first meeting of
the year, an educational program
designed to inform the campus about
itself, when less than 20 white students
showed up. Commenting on the
meeting acting chairman John Sylvester
said, "Right now I'm pretty pissed off.
I'm ready to say fuck off to the white
community."
Director of information John Minor
attributes the poor attendance to the
"apathy" of the white people toward

BSU activities. Said Sylvester, "There
are a lot of people who should have
been here, and who apparently don't
take the BSU seriously."
The meeting was announced all
week in the Daily, in the freshman
schedule, and in flyers which were
placed under doors in almost all of the
dorms.
The purpose of the meeting said
Sylvester, "was to tell the white people
what we do and why we do it. Basically
we are a political educational
organization and this Ls one level on
which we must operate."

The original program was to include
a discussion of BSU activities, a black
choir, African drums and a statement
to the white community.
"Now however," he continued, "I
seriously question whether we should
bust our asses trying to fill the
ignorance that exists among the white
students. This sort of confirms what we
thought anyway, that Stanford is just a
fantasy trip."
Minor added, "It's just unreal. A
banker sends his son here to get his
liberal education, but warns him not to
get mixed up with the BSU since their
just a bunch of crazies."
Sylvester remarked that the BSU
originally had doubts whether to try
this type of educational program at all.
"We wondered whether we should hit
them with our functions and our goals.
Obviously they didn't respond."
After the program was cancelled
black students were asked to remain to
discuss whether they should continue
to try such educational programs to
communicate with the white
community.
There were several factors which
entered into the poor attendance,
according to Minor. "Many students
were led to believe it was a closed
meeting. The announcement in the
freshman schedule listed the program as
simply a BSU meeting, even though we
told them again and again and again
that it was an open meeting designed
for white students."
"In the Daily the announcement was
placed under the head BSU MEETING.
Most students probably didn't read any
further. Also there was a freshmen
math test tonight which probably tied
up some, but still there are a lot of
people who should have been here."
