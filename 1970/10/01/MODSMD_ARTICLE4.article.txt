## Nixon In Yugoslavia 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) —
President Nixon, "honored to be the
first American president to visit
Yugoslavia," appealed to all nations
Wednesday night to respect the rights
of others.
"Long ago Yugoslavia chose the
path of nonalignment, and for more
than two decades Yugoslavia and
Marshal Tito personally have played
major roles in the nonaligned
movement throughout the world," the
President said. "We in the United States
respect that position.
"But the great question today is not
whether a nation is aligned or
nonaligned but whether it respects the
rights of others to choose their own
paths—and Yugoslavia, by its example,
has given heart to those who would
choose their own paths."
Nixon spoke at a state dinner given
by President Tito, who is a Communist
but who for 2 2 years has refused to
recognize Moscow as the fountainhead
of all Communist wisdom.

In toasting his visitor, Tito criticized
the big powers for intervention in the
Middle East and Indochina—and by
implication the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968.
"The principles of independence,
sovereignty, equality,
non-interference . . . must be respected
with no exception," Tito said. "The
infringement of these principles cannot
be justified by any political, ideological
or other motives."
Arriving from Italy, President Nixon
received a friendly and orderly
welcome from the people of Belgrade.
Compared with his visit last year to
Romania, however, the welcome
seemed smaller and less vibrant. One
reason may have been that Yugoslavia
was just coming out of a day of
mourning for the late Gamal Abdel
Nasser, the Egyptian president whom
Tito regarded warmly.
A Yugoslav security official
estimated at 2 00,0 00 or more the
crowd that lined the route from airport
to downtown Belgrade.
