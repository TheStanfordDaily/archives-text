# New Political Center Takes Shape
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
A center for voluntary groups
involved in the November elections was
set up recently by the newly formed
Student Committee for Involvement in
Politics (SCIP).
Robert N. Grant, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, formed
the SCIP coordinating committee last
month. Serving with him are Donald
Ayer, Traci Bliss, Henry Sayre, Larry
Diamond and .John Grube.
According to Grant, "SCIP was
founded because certain basic goals
concerning campus politics must be
accomplished." Included in these goals
is the establishment of campaign
headquarters for partisan political
campaigns and groups. Presently,
almost all local Republican candidates,
Tunney, Mclean and the Movement for
a New Congress have leased office space
at SCIP. Kadi of these groups is
providing its own telephones,
furnishings and other supplies.

SCIP has also provided a duplication
center for political campaigns as well as
anyone else who wants to use it. It is
open every night from 7-10 p.m.
Another SCIP goal is to distribute
political information to students
throughout the campus. Grant hopes
"to have as many as 1 000 students
working with the campaigns by election
day."
Located on the second floor of a
former fraternity house at 5 34
Salvatierra Street, SCIP is an outgrowth
of the Political Resources Committee.
Since University facilities cannot
remain tax-exempt if they are used for
political activities, the University has

agreed to give up the tax-exempt status
of the space that is involved.
SCIP'S immediate plans call for a
program of workshops this Sunday at
Tresidder. Scheduled are two separate
programs of political workshops at 2
p.m. Both programs will start with
panel discussions lasting about <15
minutes, and will be followed by small
group discussions which are expected
to last two hours.
Lyman Introductory Remarks
The introductory remarks at the
afternoon SCIP workshop will be given
by President Lyr.,m After his brief
talk and the pÂ« <. discussion, the
workshops will be discussing topics

relating to influencing legislation and
ballot issues, including organizing
procedures on the local, state and
federal levels, lobbying, and methods to
place propositions on the ballot.
The evening session will be centered
around candidate campaigns ''ter a
keynote address by San Francisco
Supervisor Roger Boas. Topics such as
the nominating process, the organizing
of precincts and the "ins and outs" of
conventions arc on the agenda.
Grant notes that "the workshop
groups are definitely not going to be
run like a civics class. When the
nominating process is discussed, we
won't be talking simply about the
nominating procedures, but rather the
invisible aspects of a nominating
convention."
Workshop Groups
The panel discussions and the
smaller workshop groups are to be led
by a contingent of veteran political
organizers, including many local Hay
Area figures.
