## Undisciplined Radicalism 
### george mcgovern 
(The following is the text of a message sent by Sen. McGovern to
summertime congressional interns.)
The recent bombing of the Math Center at the University of
Wisconsin, which claimed the life of a young researcher, is one of a
series of violent acts which underscore the folly of undisciplined
radicalism. Bombings in various parts of the country have come with
alarming frequency in recent months. These tactics and the wild
rhetoric that has afflicted some revolutionary groups are apparently
based on the notion that the ends justify the means.
But the bombers, and other irresponsible advocates of violence,
threaten all that is decent in our society. They sometimes claim to be
operating as anti-war agitators. But we cannot end violence abroad by
practicing it on each other here at home. Indeed, the tactics of
violence only ensure a self-defeating counter-reaction that leads not to
peace and justice but to conflict and repression.
I regret that some radical youth leaders have lost contact with both
reality and their own professed idealism.
Radical theoretician Tom Hayden's recent remarks to the National
Student Association Congress, as reported in the Washington Star of
August 19,1 970, illustrate the point.
Endorsing Barbarism
In glorifying the recent kidnapping of a California Judge which led
to his death and that of three other people, Hayden endorses the very
barbarism that he professes to despise.
In claiming that Panther leader Huey Newton was released from
prison because of the guerrilla kidnappers of Uruguay and Brazil,
Hayden has gor?e beyond the limits of either reason or honesty.
Newton was released not because of Latin American kidnappers,
but because an American court gave him the beneficial protection of
our judicial system, and found error in his trial.
The great weakness of many American radicals such as Hayden is
that their vision is limited only to the weakness of our society. Even
though their own freedom depends on the American legal and
political system, they use that freedom to proclaim the worthlessness
of the system that makes their protest possible.
At the same time, they naively imagine that the revolutionary
society they advocate would measure up fully to the lofty ideals of its
architects.
Thus, the American radical all too frequently wears one set of
blinders that enables him to see only the disappointments and ugliness
of our society, while another set of blinders enables him to see only
the virtues of the Utopian alternatives he reads about in radical
literature.
Normally, he is comforted in his blindness by the affluence and
relative security provided by the system he condemns.
What I personally resent most about some American radicals is
their willingness to jeopardize the chances of constructive change by
Haunting their own foolish and destructive tactics. They have invited
the so-called hard hat reaction to the peace effort by such antics as
displaying Vietcong flags, disrupting courtrooms, shouting obscenities
and other obnoxious patterns of conduct. Instead of building a
broader base on the nearly universal hunger of man for p p ace, they
seem determined to isolate the peace movement from any kind of
effective relationship with other human beings.
Reckless Political Action
This kind of reckless political action may be enjoyable for affluent
youth cut off from the real world, but it is a grave injustice to those

who seek an end to the war and misery. The irresponsible militant
"doing his thing" at a peace rally or in a courtroom is undermining
those dedicated to the long, hard effort to influence public opinion
toward peace and justice.
The Jerry Rubins and the Abbie Hoffmans have done all right for
themselves doing their own thing. They have made themselves into
nationally known personalities complete with lucrative fees. But they
have discredited in the public mind legitimate efforts for peace and
justice.
I repudiate the tactics of the Jerry Rubins and the Abbie
Hoffmans. And I repudiate the foolish words of Tom Hayden, spoken
in praise of the California court tragedy and the Latin American
kidnap killers. Their antics betray the hundreds of thousands of
concerned people, young and old, who have worked and talked and
walked for peace and justice. They betray the thousands of people
young and old who work for candidates dedicated to a better society.
They betray those in public life who have invested their lives in the
cause of a more humane and peaceful society. And, they betray their
own hopes for a more harmonious world based on the brotherhood of
man.
