Edit r, THE DAILY:
Daily Editor Marshall Kilduff
betrayed the depth of his own
despair in his editorial on Richard
Lyman when he characterized
ours as "a society which races
around the world dispersing
death, "freedom," and arrogant
technology." With this view of
our society, it is clear that no
President is acceptable who does
not advocate the destruction of
the society and the University. We
are fortunate that President
Lyman does not fit this
description.
One can only have pity for Mr.
Kilduff in his nihilistic view of his
society and world. Clearly he can
see no hope in any other society

anywhere else in the world; if he
did, he would join that society.
Seeing no hope, he can only
vaguely advocate the dissolution
of our society.
At a time when there is so
much constructive work to be
done, so many real problems to be
solved, it is truly unfortunate that
we must look to such an editor
for leadership.

Organic Pollution
Editor, The Daily:
Every person on the Peninsula,
who is concerned with the quality
of our living environment, has
now the opportunity of taking
absolute, direct and positive
action to purify it. The chemical
pollution resulting from use of
pesticidal sprays and artificial
fertilizers - two of the gravest
threats to the life-balance on our
planet, can now be stopped. The
secrct: Buy Organically Grown
Produce Only!
By refusing to purchase food
grown with the use of synthetic
chemicals one makes undoubtably
the most direct and positive

statement possible to the
agricultural industry of the United
States, that we, the people, will
not tolerate pollution.

Pig Festival
Editor, The Daily:
I thought it might be of
interest to know that next year,
1971, will be the year of the Pig
(inoshishi) in the oriental scheme
of things. 1969 was the year of
the Chicken, 1970, the year of the
Dog; as far as I can tell neither
chickens nor dogs correspond to
any particular human group. But
pigs! T he police of the world
should consider 1971 their year,
and live it up. There could be
international pig festivals,
boycotts on ham and bacon, etc.
