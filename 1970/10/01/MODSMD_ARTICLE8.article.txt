## Police And Old Union Sit-Ins 
### peter stern 
Stanford University
representatives lobbied a new
trespass law in the State
legislature this summer. When the
measure takes effect, on October
21, it will be a trespass to refuse
or fail "to leave land, real
property, or structures belonging
to or lawfully occupied by
another and not open to the
general public, upon being
requested to leave by a peace
officer and the owner, his agent,
or the person in lawful possession
thereof." (Section 602 N, Penal
Code.)
Whatever happened to the
persons arrested at Old Union last
April? The local press and the
Stanford News Service have been
silent about their cases, so it
would be instructive to explain to
the community why every
trespass arrestee had charges
dismissed before trial, and what
new measures the University may
use should sit-ins resume.
The decision to use the police
against a sit-in this year seems to
have been made by the
Disruptions Committee on April
1 7, nearly a week before the first
Old Union sit-in. The climate of
broken glass, the rhetoric of the
"cost-benefit analysis," and the
growing frustration of
administration figures, confronted
with a rap id ly-changing
"Off-ROTC" movement which
few of them understood, caused
the University's leadership to fix
with rigid inflexibility a policy
which was to provoke $40,000
damage to the campus.
In earlier years, the
administration responded with
coolness during the Old Union
and A EL sit-ins. University
policemen took up posts inside
those buildings, and the

administration "accepted" the
occupations for the short run,
while working to oust the
demonstrators by internal
procedures. Encina Hall, on May
1, 1 969, marked a new phase: the
use of outside police. The
circumstances under which the
Encina Hall sit-in took place were
different: demonstrators broke
into the building in the early
morning hours and rifled the files.
The University could not run
without use of this building. A
police presence sufficed to clear
the demonstrators. There were no
arrests, although the University
initiated internal judicial
proceedings against them.
Last Spring's Events
This year's unrest began with
several days of trashing in early
April. By April 10th, the trashing
tactic had all but died out as the
militant non-violent group
convinced the "Off ROTC"
movement to work for a peaceful
sit-in. Anyone following the
movement during the second and
third weeks of April could tell
from the meetings and the actions
taken that the trashing tactic had
been given up. The University's
news releases indicate no trashing
and only minor incidents - the
fouling of locks - for two weeks
prior to the first sit-in. More
pertinent to what happened on
April 23 rd was the visit of three
faculty and staff members to the
Provost on April 22 nd. They
pointed out that the movement
had become non-violent, and that
the sit-in scheduled for the 23 rd
would be a peaceful one.
Seemingly traumatized by the
rocks of early April, or else fearful
that a peaceful demonstration
would overwhelm it if tolerated,
the administration stuck to its
guns. With bizarre logic, the
University announced that the
sit-in which began in the early
afternoon would be tolerated to 5
p.m. and after 8 a.m. the next
morning, only at times that it
might have been disruptive. Such
an admission that the sit-in was
not disruptive before 5 p.m.
eroded any position the
University might have to call the
police; in fact, this admission
justified the sit-in as a return to
the non-violent demonstration of
the past. Could the University
justify its appeal to the police?
When demonstrators ignored
the University's 5 p.m. order to
leave, representatives of the
sheriff's office came and, slightly
after 6 p.m., announced that
"anyone remaining in the building
is guilty of 602 of the penal code,
trespassing, so if you remain we're
going to have to arrest you; you're
guilty of trespass right now, so
you don't really have any time at
all, but, uh, well, I can't authorize
you to continue violating the law -
1 just can't do it, but, but - as I
said, what we want to do now is
clear the building. We're not

concerned with making any
arrests immediately, but if you
don't, we will." (KZSU broadcast
tape). It was not clear to
demonstrators what Captain Rosa
meant. Would arrests be used as a
last resort? Or were arrests the
objective of an eventual police
presence?
Rock-throwing Rampage
By 1:10 a.m., it seemed pretty
clear, especially for the 22 persons
in or near the Old Union who
were arrested, and charged with
trespass for "entering and
occupying real property and
structures without consent of the
owner, his agent, or the person in
lawful possession thereof."
(Section 602 L, Penal Code). What
followed was as questionable as
the police tactics. Demonstrators
went on a rock-throwing rampage
causing more than three times as
much damage to the University as
all trashing up to that moment.
While the demonstrators threw
the rocks, it was the
Administration and the police
which encouraged the resumption
of trashing.
In the next few weeks, it
became clear that the State could
not prosecute the arrestees with
success. On May 8, deputy district
attorneys amended the original
complaints to add another charge:
violation of clause 2 of section
602 J, which defines as trespass
"entering certain lands with the
intention of interfering with,
obstructing or injuring the lawful
business or occupation carried on
by the owner of such land, his
agent, or the person in lawful
possession." The same charges
were filed against the April 29
arrestees. It was only after the
arrests that someone bothered to
check the wording of the law,
since it is quite clear in section
602 L that one has to enter as
well as to occupy without consent
of the owner, and the
demonstrators had not entered
without the consent of the owner.
As for section 6 02J, the
University had itself considered
the sit-in non-disruptive until the
5 p.m. closing.
Void for Vagueness
This charade of due process
continued in early June, as the
deputy district attorney
attempted to reamend the
complaints by adding clause 1 of
section 602 J: "entering any
lands... for the purpose of
injuring any property or property
rights." The court sustained the
demurrers of the defense
attorneys and threw out the
amended complaint as "void for
vagueness," and the State finally
requested dismissals for
insufficiency of evidence before
any trials began.
Whoever called in the police on
April 23 rd had made a grave
political as well as a legal error.
The "raiding party" bust of April
24 revived trashing and made

inevitable further violent
confrontation'; with the police. It
tended to justify those who felt
that the only good protest was a
clandestine, violent one. The only
winners in this type of scenario
would be the administrators who
could point out * the "law and
order" constituencies that they
had called the police
Pinnacle of In^ptness
The legal error was even worse.
How could the administration
have failed to let a year pass after
Encina Hall without ordering a
competent investigation of
remedies for sit-ins? Ignorance of
the penal code was compounded
by failure to follow Stanford's
internal rules: no guards were
posted at the doors of the Old
Union, in contravention of
S.C.L.C regulations for buildings
closed by order of the president.
It is astounding enough that the
University feels it must invoke
trespass prosecution against its
own students for occupying a
student services building. To do so
when no law has been broken
reaches the pinnacle of ineptness;
and to fail to redress the error
destroys credibility.
In the future, the University
will have the new trespass law
cited above in its armory. It
would appear to cover future
sit-ins, as long as the State can
prove that arrestees are
co-extensive with the persons
warned by the police and the
administration representative.
Another law which may be used
against demonstrators is a statute
which was apparently designed to
apprehend Ku Klux Klan
members; it levies additional
penalties against persons caught
committing a crime while masked.
Respect Needed
These new legal remedies
strengthen the University's hand.
It is to be hoped that their use
will not be necessary, for if every
issue produced a sit-in, and if
every sit-in brought out the
police, the University would not
be a University. Daniel Bell's
description of the Columbia crisis
makes the point well: "... in a
community one cannot regain
authority simply by asserting it,
or by using force to suppress
dissidents. Authority in this case
is like respect. One can only earn
the authority - the loyalty of
one's students - by going in and
arguing with them, by engaging in
full debate and, when the merits
of proposed change are
recognized, taking the necessary
steps quickly enough to be
convincing."

at Stanford from 1965 to 1969,
teaches French history at the
University of Santa Clara. He was
arrested at the Old Union on April
24 while covering the sit-in for the
Nation, which carries his article,
"Stanford's Community of

Last Spring's Events
This year's unrest began with
several days of trashing in early
April. By April 10th, the trashing
tactic had all but died out as the
militant non-violent group
convinced the "Off ROTC"
movement to work for a peaceful
sit-in. Anyone following the
movement during the second and
third weeks of April could tell
from the meetings and the actions
taken that the trashing tactic had
been given up. The University's
news releases indicate no trashing
and only minor incidents - the
fouling of locks - for two weeks
prior to the first sit-in. More
pertinent to what happened on
April 23 rd was the visit of three
faculty and staff members to the
Provost on April 22 nd. They
pointed out that the movement
had become non-violent, and that
the sit-in scheduled for the 23 rd
would be a peaceful one.
Seemingly traumatized by the
rocks of early April, or else fearful
that a peaceful demonstration
would overwhelm it if tolerated,
the administration stuck to its
guns. With bizarre logic, the
University announced that the
sit-in which began in the early
afternoon would be tolerated to 5
p.m. and after 8 a.m. the next
morning, only at times that it
might have been disruptive. Such
an admission that the sit-in was
not disruptive before 5 p.m.
eroded any position the
University might have to call the
police; in fact, this admission
justified the sit-in as a return to
the non-violent demonstration of
the past. Could the University
justify its appeal to the police?
When demonstrators ignored
the University's 5 p.m. order to
leave, representatives of the
sheriff's office came and, slightly
after 6 p.m., announced that
"anyone remaining in the building
is guilty of 602 of the penal code,
trespassing, so if you remain we're
going to have to arrest you; you're
guilty of trespass right now, so
you don't really have any time at
all, but, uh, well, I can't authorize
you to continue violating the law -
1 just can't do it, but, but - as I
said, what we want to do now is
clear the building. We're not

concerned with making any
arrests immediately, but if you
don't, we will." (KZSU broadcast
tape). It was not clear to
demonstrators what Captain Rosa
meant. Would arrests be used as a
last resort? Or were arrests the
objective of an eventual police
presence?
Rock-throwing Rampage
By 1:10 a.m., it seemed pretty
clear, especially for the 22 persons
in or near the Old Union who
were arrested, and charged with
trespass for "entering and
occupying real property and
structures without consent of the
owner, his agent, or the person in
lawful possession thereof."
(Section 602 L, Penal Code). What
followed was as questionable as
the police tactics. Demonstrators
went on a rock-throwing rampage
causing more than three times as
much damage to the University as
all trashing up to that moment.
While the demonstrators threw
the rocks, it was the
Administration and the police
which encouraged the resumption
of trashing.
In the next few weeks, it
became clear that the State could
not prosecute the arrestees with
success. On May 8, deputy district
attorneys amended the original
complaints to add another charge:
violation of clause 2 of section
602 J, which defines as trespass
"entering certain lands with the
intention of interfering with,
obstructing or injuring the lawful
business or occupation carried on
by the owner of such land, his
agent, or the person in lawful
possession." The same charges
were filed against the April 29
arrestees. It was only after the
arrests that someone bothered to
check the wording of the law,
since it is quite clear in section
602 L that one has to enter as
well as to occupy without consent
of the owner, and the
demonstrators had not entered
without the consent of the owner.
As for section 6 02J, the
University had itself considered
the sit-in non-disruptive until the
5 p.m. closing.
Void for Vagueness
This charade of due process
continued in early June, as the
deputy district attorney
attempted to reamend the
complaints by adding clause 1 of
section 602 J: "entering any
lands... for the purpose of
injuring any property or property
rights." The court sustained the
demurrers of the defense
attorneys and threw out the
amended complaint as "void for
vagueness," and the State finally
requested dismissals for
insufficiency of evidence before
any trials began.
Whoever called in the police on
April 23 rd had made a grave
political as well as a legal error.
The "raiding party" bust of April
24 revived trashing and made

inevitable further violent
confrontation'; with the police. It
tended to justify those who felt
that the only good protest was a
clandestine, violent one. The only
winners in this type of scenario
would be the administrators who
could point out * the "law and
order" constituencies that they
had called the police
Pinnacle of In^ptness
The legal error was even worse.
How could the administration
have failed to let a year pass after
Encina Hall without ordering a
competent investigation of
remedies for sit-ins? Ignorance of
the penal code was compounded
by failure to follow Stanford's
internal rules: no guards were
posted at the doors of the Old
Union, in contravention of
S.C.L.C regulations for buildings
closed by order of the president.
It is astounding enough that the
University feels it must invoke
trespass prosecution against its
own students for occupying a
student services building. To do so
when no law has been broken
reaches the pinnacle of ineptness;
and to fail to redress the error
destroys credibility.
In the future, the University
will have the new trespass law
cited above in its armory. It
would appear to cover future
sit-ins, as long as the State can
prove that arrestees are
co-extensive with the persons
warned by the police and the
administration representative.
Another law which may be used
against demonstrators is a statute
which was apparently designed to
apprehend Ku Klux Klan
members; it levies additional
penalties against persons caught
committing a crime while masked.
Respect Needed
These new legal remedies
strengthen the University's hand.
It is to be hoped that their use
will not be necessary, for if every
issue produced a sit-in, and if
every sit-in brought out the
police, the University would not
be a University. Daniel Bell's
description of the Columbia crisis
makes the point well: "... in a
community one cannot regain
authority simply by asserting it,
or by using force to suppress
dissidents. Authority in this case
is like respect. One can only earn
the authority - the loyalty of
one's students - by going in and
arguing with them, by engaging in
full debate and, when the merits
of proposed change are
recognized, taking the necessary
steps quickly enough to be
convincing."
(Peter S. Stern, a civ instructor
at Stanford from 1965 to 1969,
teaches French history at the
University of Santa Clara. He was
arrested at the Old Union on April
24 while covering the sit-in for the
Nation, which carries his article,
"Stanford's Community of
Consent," in the September 7
issue.)
Stanford University
representatives lobbied a new
trespass law in the State
legislature this summer. When the
measure takes effect, on October
21, it will be a trespass to refuse
or fail "to leave land, real
property, or structures belonging
to or lawfully occupied by
another and not open to the
general public, upon being
requested to leave by a peace
officer and the owner, his agent,
or the person in lawful possession
thereof." (Section 602 N, Penal
Code.)
Whatever happened to the
persons arrested at Old Union last
April? The local press and the
Stanford News Service have been
silent about their cases, so it
would be instructive to explain to
the community why every
trespass arrestee had charges
dismissed before trial, and what
new measures the University may
use should sit-ins resume.
The decision to use the police
against a sit-in this year seems to
have been made by the
Disruptions Committee on April
1 7, nearly a week before the first
Old Union sit-in. The climate of
broken glass, the rhetoric of the
"cost-benefit analysis," and the
growing frustration of
administration figures, confronted
with a rap id ly-changing
"Off-ROTC" movement which
few of them understood, caused
the University's leadership to fix
with rigid inflexibility a policy
which was to provoke $40,000
damage to the campus.
In earlier years, the
administration responded with
coolness during the Old Union
and A EL sit-ins. University
policemen took up posts inside
those buildings, and the

administration "accepted" the
occupations for the short run,
while working to oust the
demonstrators by internal
procedures. Encina Hall, on May
1, 1 969, marked a new phase: the
use of outside police. The
circumstances under which the
Encina Hall sit-in took place were
different: demonstrators broke
into the building in the early
morning hours and rifled the files.
The University could not run
without use of this building. A
police presence sufficed to clear
the demonstrators. There were no
arrests, although the University
initiated internal judicial
proceedings against them.

said, what we want to do now is
clear the building. We're not

concerned with making any
arrests immediately, but if you
don't, we will." (KZSU broadcast
tape). It was not clear to
demonstrators what Captain Rosa
meant. Would arrests be used as a
last resort? Or were arrests the
objective of an eventual police
presence?
Rock-throwing Rampage
By 1:10 a.m., it seemed pretty
clear, especially for the 22 persons
in or near the Old Union who
were arrested, and charged with
trespass for "entering and
occupying real property and
structures without consent of the
owner, his agent, or the person in
lawful possession thereof."
(Section 602 L, Penal Code). What
followed was as questionable as
the police tactics. Demonstrators
went on a rock-throwing rampage
causing more than three times as
much damage to the University as
all trashing up to that moment.
While the demonstrators threw
the rocks, it was the
Administration and the police
which encouraged the resumption
of trashing.
In the next few weeks, it
became clear that the State could
not prosecute the arrestees with
success. On May 8, deputy district
attorneys amended the original
complaints to add another charge:
violation of clause 2 of section
602 J, which defines as trespass
"entering certain lands with the
intention of interfering with,
obstructing or injuring the lawful
business or occupation carried on
by the owner of such land, his
agent, or the person in lawful
possession." The same charges
were filed against the April 29
arrestees. It was only after the
arrests that someone bothered to
check the wording of the law,
since it is quite clear in section
602 L that one has to enter as
well as to occupy without consent
of the owner, and the
demonstrators had not entered
without the consent of the owner.
As for section 6 02J, the
University had itself considered
the sit-in non-disruptive until the
5 p.m. closing.
Void for Vagueness
This charade of due process
continued in early June, as the
deputy district attorney
attempted to reamend the
complaints by adding clause 1 of
section 602 J: "entering any
lands... for the purpose of
injuring any property or property
rights." The court sustained the
demurrers of the defense
attorneys and threw out the
amended complaint as "void for
vagueness," and the State finally
requested dismissals for
insufficiency of evidence before
any trials began.
Whoever called in the police on
April 23 rd had made a grave
political as well as a legal error.
The "raiding party" bust of April
24 revived trashing and made

inevitable further violent
confrontation'; with the police. It
tended to justify those who felt
that the only good protest was a
clandestine, violent one. The only
winners in this type of scenario
would be the administrators who
could point out * the "law and
order" constituencies that they
had called the police
Pinnacle of In^ptness
The legal error was even worse.
How could the administration
have failed to let a year pass after
Encina Hall without ordering a
competent investigation of
remedies for sit-ins? Ignorance of
the penal code was compounded
by failure to follow Stanford's
internal rules: no guards were
posted at the doors of the Old
Union, in contravention of
S.C.L.C regulations for buildings
closed by order of the president.
It is astounding enough that the
University feels it must invoke
trespass prosecution against its
own students for occupying a
student services building. To do so
when no law has been broken
reaches the pinnacle of ineptness;
and to fail to redress the error
destroys credibility.
In the future, the University
will have the new trespass law
cited above in its armory. It
would appear to cover future
sit-ins, as long as the State can
prove that arrestees are
co-extensive with the persons
warned by the police and the
administration representative.
Another law which may be used
against demonstrators is a statute
which was apparently designed to
apprehend Ku Klux Klan
members; it levies additional
penalties against persons caught
committing a crime while masked.
Respect Needed
These new legal remedies
strengthen the University's hand.
It is to be hoped that their use
will not be necessary, for if every
issue produced a sit-in, and if
every sit-in brought out the
police, the University would not
be a University. Daniel Bell's
description of the Columbia crisis
makes the point well: "... in a
community one cannot regain
authority simply by asserting it,
or by using force to suppress
dissidents. Authority in this case
is like respect. One can only earn
the authority - the loyalty of
one's students - by going in and
arguing with them, by engaging in
full debate and, when the merits
of proposed change are
recognized, taking the necessary
steps quickly enough to be
convincing."
(Peter S. Stern, a civ instructor
at Stanford from 1965 to 1969,
teaches French history at the
University of Santa Clara. He was
arrested at the Old Union on April
24 while covering the sit-in for the
Nation, which carries his article,
"Stanford's Community of
Consent," in the September 7
issue.)
Stanford University
representatives lobbied a new
trespass law in the State
legislature this summer. When the
measure takes effect, on October
21, it will be a trespass to refuse
or fail "to leave land, real
property, or structures belonging
to or lawfully occupied by
another and not open to the
general public, upon being
requested to leave by a peace
officer and the owner, his agent,
or the person in lawful possession
thereof." (Section 602 N, Penal
Code.)
Whatever happened to the
persons arrested at Old Union last
April? The local press and the
Stanford News Service have been
silent about their cases, so it
would be instructive to explain to
the community why every
trespass arrestee had charges
dismissed before trial, and what
new measures the University may
use should sit-ins resume.
The decision to use the police
against a sit-in this year seems to
have been made by the
Disruptions Committee on April
1 7, nearly a week before the first
Old Union sit-in. The climate of
broken glass, the rhetoric of the
"cost-benefit analysis," and the
growing frustration of
administration figures, confronted
with a rap id ly-changing
"Off-ROTC" movement which
few of them understood, caused
the University's leadership to fix
with rigid inflexibility a policy
which was to provoke $40,000
damage to the campus.
In earlier years, the
administration responded with
coolness during the Old Union
and A EL sit-ins. University
policemen took up posts inside
those buildings, and the

administration "accepted" the
occupations for the short run,
while working to oust the
demonstrators by internal
procedures. Encina Hall, on May
1, 1 969, marked a new phase: the
use of outside police. The
circumstances under which the
Encina Hall sit-in took place were
different: demonstrators broke
into the building in the early
morning hours and rifled the files.
The University could not run
without use of this building. A
police presence sufficed to clear
the demonstrators. There were no
arrests, although the University
initiated internal judicial
proceedings against them.
Last Spring's Events
This year's unrest began with
several days of trashing in early
April. By April 10th, the trashing
tactic had all but died out as the
militant non-violent group
convinced the "Off ROTC"
movement to work for a peaceful
sit-in. Anyone following the
movement during the second and
third weeks of April could tell
from the meetings and the actions
taken that the trashing tactic had
been given up. The University's
news releases indicate no trashing
and only minor incidents - the
fouling of locks - for two weeks
prior to the first sit-in. More
pertinent to what happened on
April 23 rd was the visit of three
faculty and staff members to the
Provost on April 22 nd. They
pointed out that the movement
had become non-violent, and that
the sit-in scheduled for the 23 rd
would be a peaceful one.
Seemingly traumatized by the
rocks of early April, or else fearful
that a peaceful demonstration
would overwhelm it if tolerated,
the administration stuck to its
guns. With bizarre logic, the
University announced that the
sit-in which began in the early
afternoon would be tolerated to 5
p.m. and after 8 a.m. the next
morning, only at times that it
might have been disruptive. Such
an admission that the sit-in was
not disruptive before 5 p.m.
eroded any position the
University might have to call the
police; in fact, this admission
justified the sit-in as a return to
the non-violent demonstration of
the past. Could the University
justify its appeal to the police?
When demonstrators ignored
the University's 5 p.m. order to
leave, representatives of the
sheriff's office came and, slightly
after 6 p.m., announced that
"anyone remaining in the building
is guilty of 602 of the penal code,
trespassing, so if you remain we're
going to have to arrest you; you're
guilty of trespass right now, so
you don't really have any time at
all, but, uh, well, I can't authorize
you to continue violating the law -
1 just can't do it, but, but - as I
said, what we want to do now is
clear the building. We're not

concerned with making any
arrests immediately, but if you
don't, we will." (KZSU broadcast

attempted to reamend the
complaints by adding clause 1 of
section 602 J: "entering any
lands... for the purpose of
injuring any property or property
rights." The court sustained the
demurrers of the defense
attorneys and threw out the
amended complaint as "void for
vagueness," and the State finally
requested dismissals for
insufficiency of evidence before
any trials began.
Whoever called in the police on
April 23 rd had made a grave
political as well as a legal error.
The "raiding party" bust of April
24 revived trashing and made

inevitable further violent
confrontation'; with the police. It
tended to justify those who felt
that the only good protest was a
clandestine, violent one. The only
winners in this type of scenario
would be the administrators who
could point out * the "law and
order" constituencies that they
had called the police
Pinnacle of In^ptness
The legal error was even worse.
How could the administration
have failed to let a year pass after
Encina Hall without ordering a
competent investigation of
remedies for sit-ins? Ignorance of
the penal code was compounded
by failure to follow Stanford's
internal rules: no guards were
posted at the doors of the Old
Union, in contravention of
S.C.L.C regulations for buildings
closed by order of the president.
It is astounding enough that the
University feels it must invoke
trespass prosecution against its
own students for occupying a
student services building. To do so
when no law has been broken
reaches the pinnacle of ineptness;
and to fail to redress the error
destroys credibility.
In the future, the University
will have the new trespass law
cited above in its armory. It
would appear to cover future
sit-ins, as long as the State can
prove that arrestees are
co-extensive with the persons
warned by the police and the
administration representative.
Another law which may be used
against demonstrators is a statute
which was apparently designed to
apprehend Ku Klux Klan
members; it levies additional
penalties against persons caught
committing a crime while masked.
Respect Needed
These new legal remedies
strengthen the University's hand.
It is to be hoped that their use
will not be necessary, for if every
issue produced a sit-in, and if
every sit-in brought out the
police, the University would not
be a University. Daniel Bell's
description of the Columbia crisis
makes the point well: "... in a
community one cannot regain
authority simply by asserting it,
or by using force to suppress
dissidents. Authority in this case
is like respect. One can only earn
the authority - the loyalty of
one's students - by going in and
arguing with them, by engaging in
full debate and, when the merits
of proposed change are
recognized, taking the necessary
steps quickly enough to be
convincing."
(Peter S. Stern, a civ instructor
at Stanford from 1965 to 1969,
teaches French history at the
University of Santa Clara. He was
arrested at the Old Union on April
24 while covering the sit-in for the
Nation, which carries his article,
"Stanford's Community of
Consent," in the September 7
issue.)
Stanford University
representatives lobbied a new
trespass law in the State
legislature this summer. When the
measure takes effect, on October
21, it will be a trespass to refuse
or fail "to leave land, real
property, or structures belonging
to or lawfully occupied by
another and not open to the
general public, upon being
requested to leave by a peace
officer and the owner, his agent,
or the person in lawful possession
thereof." (Section 602 N, Penal
Code.)
Whatever happened to the
persons arrested at Old Union last
April? The local press and the
Stanford News Service have been
silent about their cases, so it
would be instructive to explain to
the community why every
trespass arrestee had charges
dismissed before trial, and what
new measures the University may
use should sit-ins resume.
The decision to use the police
against a sit-in this year seems to
have been made by the
Disruptions Committee on April
1 7, nearly a week before the first
Old Union sit-in. The climate of
broken glass, the rhetoric of the
"cost-benefit analysis," and the
growing frustration of
administration figures, confronted
with a rap id ly-changing
"Off-ROTC" movement which
few of them understood, caused
the University's leadership to fix
with rigid inflexibility a policy
which was to provoke $40,000
damage to the campus.
In earlier years, the
administration responded with
coolness during the Old Union
and A EL sit-ins. University
policemen took up posts inside
those buildings, and the

administration "accepted" the
occupations for the short run,
while working to oust the
demonstrators by internal
procedures. Encina Hall, on May
1, 1 969, marked a new phase: the
use of outside police. The
circumstances under which the
Encina Hall sit-in took place were
different: demonstrators broke
into the building in the early
morning hours and rifled the files.
The University could not run
without use of this building. A
police presence sufficed to clear
the demonstrators. There were no
arrests, although the University
initiated internal judicial
proceedings against them.
Last Spring's Events
This year's unrest began with
several days of trashing in early
April. By April 10th, the trashing
tactic had all but died out as the
militant non-violent group
convinced the "Off ROTC"
movement to work for a peaceful
sit-in. Anyone following the
movement during the second and
third weeks of April could tell
from the meetings and the actions
taken that the trashing tactic had
been given up. The University's
news releases indicate no trashing
and only minor incidents - the
fouling of locks - for two weeks
prior to the first sit-in. More
pertinent to what happened on
April 23 rd was the visit of three
faculty and staff members to the
Provost on April 22 nd. They
pointed out that the movement
had become non-violent, and that
the sit-in scheduled for the 23 rd
would be a peaceful one.
Seemingly traumatized by the
rocks of early April, or else fearful
that a peaceful demonstration
would overwhelm it if tolerated,
the administration stuck to its
guns. With bizarre logic, the
University announced that the
sit-in which began in the early
afternoon would be tolerated to 5
p.m. and after 8 a.m. the next
morning, only at times that it
might have been disruptive. Such
an admission that the sit-in was
not disruptive before 5 p.m.
eroded any position the
University might have to call the
police; in fact, this admission
justified the sit-in as a return to
the non-violent demonstration of
the past. Could the University
justify its appeal to the police?
When demonstrators ignored
the University's 5 p.m. order to
leave, representatives of the
sheriff's office came and, slightly
after 6 p.m., announced that
"anyone remaining in the building
is guilty of 602 of the penal code,
trespassing, so if you remain we're
going to have to arrest you; you're
guilty of trespass right now, so
you don't really have any time at
all, but, uh, well, I can't authorize
you to continue violating the law -
1 just can't do it, but, but - as I
said, what we want to do now is
clear the building. We're not

concerned with making any
arrests immediately, but if you
don't, we will." (KZSU broadcast
tape). It was not clear to
demonstrators what Captain Rosa
meant. Would arrests be used as a
last resort? Or were arrests the
objective of an eventual police
presence?
Rock-throwing Rampage
By 1:10 a.m., it seemed pretty
clear, especially for the 22 persons
in or near the Old Union who
were arrested, and charged with
trespass for "entering and
occupying real property and
structures without consent of the
owner, his agent, or the person in
lawful possession thereof."
(Section 602 L, Penal Code). What
followed was as questionable as
the police tactics. Demonstrators
went on a rock-throwing rampage
causing more than three times as
much damage to the University as
all trashing up to that moment.
While the demonstrators threw
the rocks, it was the
Administration and the police
which encouraged the resumption
of trashing.
In the next few weeks, it
became clear that the State could
not prosecute the arrestees with
success. On May 8, deputy district
attorneys amended the original
complaints to add another charge:
violation of clause 2 of section
602 J, which defines as trespass
"entering certain lands with the
intention of interfering with,
obstructing or injuring the lawful
business or occupation carried on
by the owner of such land, his
agent, or the person in lawful
possession." The same charges
were filed against the April 29
arrestees. It was only after the
arrests that someone bothered to
check the wording of the law,
since it is quite clear in section
602 L that one has to enter as
well as to occupy without consent
of the owner, and the
demonstrators had not entered
without the consent of the owner.
As for section 6 02J, the
University had itself considered
the sit-in non-disruptive until the
5 p.m. closing.
Void for Vagueness
This charade of due process
continued in early June, as the
deputy district attorney
attempted to reamend the
complaints by adding clause 1 of
section 602 J: "entering any

rights." The court sustained the

will not be necessary, for if every
issue produced a sit-in, and if
every sit-in brought out the
police, the University would not
be a University. Daniel Bell's
description of the Columbia crisis
makes the point well: "... in a
community one cannot regain
authority simply by asserting it,
or by using force to suppress
dissidents. Authority in this case
is like respect. One can only earn
the authority - the loyalty of
one's students - by going in and
arguing with them, by engaging in
full debate and, when the merits
of proposed change are
recognized, taking the necessary
steps quickly enough to be
convincing."
(Peter S. Stern, a civ instructor
at Stanford from 1965 to 1969,
teaches French history at the
University of Santa Clara. He was
arrested at the Old Union on April
24 while covering the sit-in for the
Nation, which carries his article,
"Stanford's Community of
Consent," in the September 7
issue.)
Stanford University
representatives lobbied a new
trespass law in the State
legislature this summer. When the
measure takes effect, on October
21, it will be a trespass to refuse
or fail "to leave land, real
property, or structures belonging
to or lawfully occupied by
another and not open to the
general public, upon being
requested to leave by a peace
officer and the owner, his agent,
or the person in lawful possession
thereof." (Section 602 N, Penal
Code.)
Whatever happened to the
persons arrested at Old Union last
April? The local press and the
Stanford News Service have been
silent about their cases, so it
would be instructive to explain to
the community why every
trespass arrestee had charges
dismissed before trial, and what
new measures the University may
use should sit-ins resume.
The decision to use the police
against a sit-in this year seems to
have been made by the
Disruptions Committee on April
1 7, nearly a week before the first
Old Union sit-in. The climate of
broken glass, the rhetoric of the
"cost-benefit analysis," and the
growing frustration of
administration figures, confronted
with a rap id ly-changing
"Off-ROTC" movement which
few of them understood, caused
the University's leadership to fix
with rigid inflexibility a policy
which was to provoke $40,000
damage to the campus.
In earlier years, the
administration responded with
coolness during the Old Union
and A EL sit-ins. University
policemen took up posts inside
those buildings, and the

administration "accepted" the
occupations for the short run,
while working to oust the
demonstrators by internal
procedures. Encina Hall, on May
1, 1 969, marked a new phase: the
use of outside police. The
circumstances under which the
Encina Hall sit-in took place were
different: demonstrators broke
into the building in the early
morning hours and rifled the files.
The University could not run
without use of this building. A
police presence sufficed to clear
the demonstrators. There were no
arrests, although the University
initiated internal judicial
proceedings against them.
Last Spring's Events
This year's unrest began with
several days of trashing in early
April. By April 10th, the trashing
tactic had all but died out as the
militant non-violent group
convinced the "Off ROTC"
movement to work for a peaceful
sit-in. Anyone following the
movement during the second and
third weeks of April could tell
from the meetings and the actions
taken that the trashing tactic had
been given up. The University's
news releases indicate no trashing
and only minor incidents - the
fouling of locks - for two weeks
prior to the first sit-in. More
pertinent to what happened on
April 23 rd was the visit of three
faculty and staff members to the
Provost on April 22 nd. They
pointed out that the movement
had become non-violent, and that
the sit-in scheduled for the 23 rd
would be a peaceful one.
Seemingly traumatized by the
rocks of early April, or else fearful
that a peaceful demonstration
would overwhelm it if tolerated,
the administration stuck to its
guns. With bizarre logic, the
University announced that the
sit-in which began in the early
afternoon would be tolerated to 5
p.m. and after 8 a.m. the next
morning, only at times that it
might have been disruptive. Such
an admission that the sit-in was
not disruptive before 5 p.m.
eroded any position the
University might have to call the
police; in fact, this admission
justified the sit-in as a return to
the non-violent demonstration of
the past. Could the University
justify its appeal to the police?
When demonstrators ignored
the University's 5 p.m. order to
leave, representatives of the
sheriff's office came and, slightly
after 6 p.m., announced that
"anyone remaining in the building
is guilty of 602 of the penal code,
trespassing, so if you remain we're
going to have to arrest you; you're
guilty of trespass right now, so
you don't really have any time at
all, but, uh, well, I can't authorize
you to continue violating the law -
1 just can't do it, but, but - as I
said, what we want to do now is
clear the building. We're not

concerned with making any
arrests immediately, but if you
don't, we will." (KZSU broadcast
tape). It was not clear to
demonstrators what Captain Rosa
meant. Would arrests be used as a
last resort? Or were arrests the
objective of an eventual police
presence?
Rock-throwing Rampage
By 1:10 a.m., it seemed pretty
clear, especially for the 22 persons
in or near the Old Union who
were arrested, and charged with
trespass for "entering and
occupying real property and
structures without consent of the
owner, his agent, or the person in
lawful possession thereof."
(Section 602 L, Penal Code). What
followed was as questionable as
the police tactics. Demonstrators
went on a rock-throwing rampage
causing more than three times as
much damage to the University as
all trashing up to that moment.
While the demonstrators threw
the rocks, it was the
Administration and the police
which encouraged the resumption
of trashing.
In the next few weeks, it
became clear that the State could
not prosecute the arrestees with
success. On May 8, deputy district
attorneys amended the original
complaints to add another charge:
violation of clause 2 of section
602 J, which defines as trespass
"entering certain lands with the
intention of interfering with,
obstructing or injuring the lawful
business or occupation carried on
by the owner of such land, his
agent, or the person in lawful
possession." The same charges
were filed against the April 29
arrestees. It was only after the
arrests that someone bothered to
check the wording of the law,
since it is quite clear in section
602 L that one has to enter as
well as to occupy without consent
of the owner, and the
demonstrators had not entered
without the consent of the owner.
As for section 6 02J, the
University had itself considered
the sit-in non-disruptive until the
5 p.m. closing.
Void for Vagueness
This charade of due process
continued in early June, as the
deputy district attorney
attempted to reamend the
complaints by adding clause 1 of
section 602 J: "entering any
lands... for the purpose of
injuring any property or property
rights." The court sustained the
demurrers of the defense
attorneys and threw out the
amended complaint as "void for
vagueness," and the State finally
requested dismissals for
insufficiency of evidence before
any trials began.
Whoever called in the police on
April 23 rd had made a grave
political as well as a legal error.
The "raiding party" bust of April
24 revived trashing and made

inevitable further violent
confrontation'; with the police. It
tended to justify those who felt
that the only good protest was a
clandestine, violent one. The only
winners in this type of scenario
would be the administrators who
could point out * the "law and
order" constituencies that they
had called the police
Pinnacle of In^ptness
The legal error was even worse.
How could the administration
have failed to let a year pass after
Encina Hall without ordering a
competent investigation of
remedies for sit-ins? Ignorance of
the penal code was compounded
by failure to follow Stanford's
internal rules: no guards were
posted at the doors of the Old
Union, in contravention of
S.C.L.C regulations for buildings
closed by order of the president.
It is astounding enough that the
University feels it must invoke
trespass prosecution against its
own students for occupying a
student services building. To do so
when no law has been broken
reaches the pinnacle of ineptness;
and to fail to redress the error
destroys credibility.
In the future, the University
will have the new trespass law
cited above in its armory. It
would appear to cover future
sit-ins, as long as the State can
prove that arrestees are
co-extensive with the persons
warned by the police and the
administration representative.
Another law which may be used
against demonstrators is a statute
which was apparently designed to
apprehend Ku Klux Klan
members; it levies additional
penalties against persons caught
committing a crime while masked.
Respect Needed
These new legal remedies
strengthen the University's hand.
It is to be hoped that their use
will not be necessary, for if every
issue produced a sit-in, and if
every sit-in brought out the
police, the University would not
be a University. Daniel Bell's
