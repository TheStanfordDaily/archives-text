# ACT's 'Hamlet'— Murder Most Foul
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
Dame Judith Anderson says
she has always wanted to play
Hamlet, which, as circumstances
have it, is usually played by a
man. But actresses with the
reputation of Dame Judith otten
get what they want, regardless of
tradition, and this week ACT
opened its production of
"Hamlet," directed by William
Ball, starring Miss Anderson as the
Prince of Denmark.
I am sorry to say that Miss
Anderson's performance may set
back the Womens' Lib movement
by 200 years. Indeed, we may see
a return to the pre-Restoration
custom of having men play
womens' parts. Miss Anderson
may be a great actress, but she
makes a very poor Hamlet.

Before I go any further with
this sad tale, I would like to
apologize to the reader, especially
if he is new to Stanford. You may
not believe this after reading what
I am about to write, but I really
love the theater. I appreciate the
opportunity to tell people how
much I enjoyed spending an
evening seeing a good play well
performed. I find it especially
painful to have to kick off a new
season by ripping apart one of the
world's most famous performers.
After all, who am I to tell Judith
Anderson she can't act?
Well, 1 wish things were very
different. I would be lying
through my teeth if I were to say
that the play I saw last night was
even mediocre. It was not. It was
just plain awful.

I think the responsibility for
the disaster lies with both Miss
Anderson and with Mr. Ball. Let
us discuss Mr. Ball first, for while
Miss Anderson misinterpreted
only the character of Hamlet, Mr.
Ball wreaked havoc with the
entire concept of the play.
Taking "Hamlet" apart at the
seams is nothing new for Mr. Ball.
His production of several years
ago was, shall we say, highly
controversial. His new production
is like his old one, only more so.
Mr. Bail has attempted to strip
"Hamlet" down to its bare
essentials. At least, I think that's
what he was trying to do. There is
no scenery, no costumes, no
props. That's not so bad, but
there was almost no Shakespeare
either, because Mr. Ball took one

of the great plays of Western
culture, cut 40 percent of it out,
and threw it away.
What's Left
Mr. Ball has cut much of the
"excess fat" from what is
probably one of the tightest plays
Shakespeare ever wrote. What we
have left is a ice cream stick
without the ice cream. None of
the characters have any depth,
with the exception of Hamlet
himself. They have been
amputated from the play, they
have been lobotomized.
When Mr. Ball was not cutting
scenes wholesale, he was editing
what was left. Even the famous
soliloquoy, moved from the third
act to the second act, for some
reason known only to Mr. Ball

and to God, had one line changed
and another cut.
All this would be forgivable if
Mr. Ball had succeeded in
mounting an interesting, exciting,
intellectual, or entertaining play.
He has not. He has given us one of
the most boring evenings in the
theater that one could ask fom a
company of professionals. How
can a play about incest, murder,
insanity and betrayal, written by
one of the greatest playwrights in
history, be boring? Ask Mr. Ball;
he's figured it out.
In addition to cutting many of
the best parts of the play, thus
drawing support from what was
left, Mr. Ball has made it difficult
for us to tell the corpses from the
living. This is not simply because
dead people in this play don't fall
down (they don't); it is because
the living may as well be dead for
all the excitement and vibrancy
they generate. I have seldom seen
such static direction, such listless
acting, on a professional stage.
Some of the characters had
moments of competence, such as
Leon Charles as the Player King.
Some were very poor, such as
Jeanne Bartlett as Ophelia and
Philip Kerr as Laertes. But in
general the acting was so
mediocre, so uninteresting, that
the characters seemed to melt into
one amorphous blob, devoid of
any differentiating qualities.
Not To Be
As for Miss Anderson, I must
confess that I am surprised and
disappointed. I was looking
forward to seeing her, as I am sure
were many others, not for just the
novelty of seeing Hamlet played
in drag, but for the experience of
seeing one of the great actresses of
our time tackle a difficult and
exacting role. I am truly sorry to
say that, whatever else she may
be, Miss Anderson is not Hamlet.
Her concept of the role is so
unique, so personal to her, that I
don't think many people will be
able to identify with it. The major
problem is that it is so much her
own that it really doesn't fit into
the context of the play very well.
Miss Anderson's Hamlet, when
faced with a crisis, begins to cry.
He cried five times during the
performace. What kind of a noble
heart is this? Hamlet kills three
people with his own hands and
sends two others to their deaths,
but when things get rough, he
starts to cry?
He is a frail, delicate fellow. He
looks like a consumptive
Romantic poet. He is humorless;
all of the biting wit that
Shakespeare gave him has
disappeared into his bitter,
introspective soul. Sometimes he
rushes through highly personal,
moving speeches with all the
emotion of a glass of warm milk;
at other times, when it matters
least, he talks and moves like the
hero in a nineteenth century
melodrama. Sometimes he acts
like a twelve year old boy at a
birthday party, sometimes like a
se v enty-year-old woman,
sometimes like Mary Martin in
Peter Pan but very seldom like the
Prince of Denmark.
So there it is. If you don't
believe me, or if you're a
masochist, the show will be
playinp at the Geary Theater in
San Francisco through October
17. Student rush tickets are
available just before curtain. Have
fun.

Hamlet, which, as circumstances
have it, is usually played by a
man. But actresses with the
reputation of Dame Judith otten
get what they want, regardless of
tradition, and this week ACT
opened its production of
"Hamlet," directed by William
Ball, starring Miss Anderson as the
Prince of Denmark.
I am sorry to say that Miss
Anderson's performance may set
back the Womens' Lib movement
by 200 years. Indeed, we may see
a return to the pre-Restoration
custom of having men play
womens' parts. Miss Anderson
may be a great actress, but she
makes a very poor Hamlet.

Before I go any further with
this sad tale, I would like to
apologize to the reader, especially
if he is new to Stanford. You may
not believe this after reading what
I am about to write, but I really
love the theater. I appreciate the
opportunity to tell people how
much I enjoyed spending an
evening seeing a good play well
performed. I find it especially
painful to have to kick off a new
season by ripping apart one of the
world's most famous performers.
After all, who am I to tell Judith
Anderson she can't act?
Well, 1 wish things were very
different. I would be lying
through my teeth if I were to say
that the play I saw last night was
even mediocre. It was not. It was
just plain awful.

I think the responsibility for
the disaster lies with both Miss
Anderson and with Mr. Ball. Let
us discuss Mr. Ball first, for while
Miss Anderson misinterpreted
only the character of Hamlet, Mr.
Ball wreaked havoc with the
entire concept of the play.
Taking "Hamlet" apart at the
seams is nothing new for Mr. Ball.
His production of several years
ago was, shall we say, highly
controversial. His new production
is like his old one, only more so.
Mr. Bail has attempted to strip
"Hamlet" down to its bare
essentials. At least, I think that's
what he was trying to do. There is
no scenery, no costumes, no
props. That's not so bad, but
there was almost no Shakespeare
either, because Mr. Ball took one

of the great plays of Western
culture, cut 40 percent of it out,
and threw it away.
What's Left
Mr. Ball has cut much of the
"excess fat" from what is
probably one of the tightest plays
Shakespeare ever wrote. What we
have left is a ice cream stick
without the ice cream. None of
the characters have any depth,
with the exception of Hamlet
himself. They have been
amputated from the play, they
have been lobotomized.
When Mr. Ball was not cutting
scenes wholesale, he was editing
what was left. Even the famous
soliloquoy, moved from the third
act to the second act, for some
reason known only to Mr. Ball

and to God, had one line changed
and another cut.
All this would be forgivable if
Mr. Ball had succeeded in
mounting an interesting, exciting,
intellectual, or entertaining play.
He has not. He has given us one of
the most boring evenings in the
theater that one could ask fom a
company of professionals. How
can a play about incest, murder,
insanity and betrayal, written by
one of the greatest playwrights in
history, be boring? Ask Mr. Ball;
he's figured it out.
In addition to cutting many of
the best parts of the play, thus
drawing support from what was
left, Mr. Ball has made it difficult
for us to tell the corpses from the
living. This is not simply because
dead people in this play don't fall
down (they don't); it is because
the living may as well be dead for
all the excitement and vibrancy
they generate. I have seldom seen
such static direction, such listless
acting, on a professional stage.
Some of the characters had
moments of competence, such as
Leon Charles as the Player King.
Some were very poor, such as
Jeanne Bartlett as Ophelia and
Philip Kerr as Laertes. But in
general the acting was so
mediocre, so uninteresting, that
the characters seemed to melt into
one amorphous blob, devoid of
any differentiating qualities.
Not To Be
As for Miss Anderson, I must
confess that I am surprised and
disappointed. I was looking
forward to seeing her, as I am sure
were many others, not for just the
novelty of seeing Hamlet played
in drag, but for the experience of
seeing one of the great actresses of
our time tackle a difficult and
exacting role. I am truly sorry to
say that, whatever else she may
be, Miss Anderson is not Hamlet.
Her concept of the role is so
unique, so personal to her, that I
don't think many people will be
able to identify with it. The major
problem is that it is so much her
own that it really doesn't fit into
the context of the play very well.
Miss Anderson's Hamlet, when
faced with a crisis, begins to cry.
He cried five times during the
performace. What kind of a noble
heart is this? Hamlet kills three
people with his own hands and
sends two others to their deaths,
but when things get rough, he
starts to cry?
He is a frail, delicate fellow. He
looks like a consumptive
Romantic poet. He is humorless;
all of the biting wit that
Shakespeare gave him has
disappeared into his bitter,
introspective soul. Sometimes he
rushes through highly personal,
moving speeches with all the
emotion of a glass of warm milk;
at other times, when it matters
least, he talks and moves like the
hero in a nineteenth century
melodrama. Sometimes he acts
like a twelve year old boy at a
birthday party, sometimes like a
se v enty-year-old woman,
sometimes like Mary Martin in
Peter Pan but very seldom like the
Prince of Denmark.
So there it is. If you don't
believe me, or if you're a
masochist, the show will be
playinp at the Geary Theater in
San Francisco through October
17. Student rush tickets are
available just before curtain. Have
fun.

reputation of Dame Judith otten
get what they want, regardless of
tradition, and this week ACT
opened its production of
"Hamlet," directed by William
Ball, starring Miss Anderson as the
Prince of Denmark.
I am sorry to say that Miss
Anderson's performance may set
back the Womens' Lib movement
by 200 years. Indeed, we may see
a return to the pre-Restoration
custom of having men play
womens' parts. Miss Anderson
may be a great actress, but she
makes a very poor Hamlet.

Before I go any further with
this sad tale, I would like to
apologize to the reader, especially
if he is new to Stanford. You may
not believe this after reading what
I am about to write, but I really
love the theater. I appreciate the
opportunity to tell people how
much I enjoyed spending an
evening seeing a good play well
performed. I find it especially
painful to have to kick off a new
season by ripping apart one of the
world's most famous performers.
After all, who am I to tell Judith
Anderson she can't act?
Well, 1 wish things were very
different. I would be lying
through my teeth if I were to say
that the play I saw last night was
even mediocre. It was not. It was
just plain awful.

I think the responsibility for
the disaster lies with both Miss
Anderson and with Mr. Ball. Let
us discuss Mr. Ball first, for while
Miss Anderson misinterpreted
only the character of Hamlet, Mr.
Ball wreaked havoc with the
entire concept of the play.
Taking "Hamlet" apart at the
seams is nothing new for Mr. Ball.
His production of several years
ago was, shall we say, highly
controversial. His new production
is like his old one, only more so.
Mr. Bail has attempted to strip
"Hamlet" down to its bare
essentials. At least, I think that's
what he was trying to do. There is
no scenery, no costumes, no
props. That's not so bad, but
there was almost no Shakespeare
either, because Mr. Ball took one

of the great plays of Western
culture, cut 40 percent of it out,
and threw it away.
What's Left
Mr. Ball has cut much of the
"excess fat" from what is
probably one of the tightest plays
Shakespeare ever wrote. What we
have left is a ice cream stick
without the ice cream. None of
the characters have any depth,
with the exception of Hamlet
himself. They have been
amputated from the play, they
have been lobotomized.
When Mr. Ball was not cutting
scenes wholesale, he was editing
what was left. Even the famous
soliloquoy, moved from the third
act to the second act, for some
reason known only to Mr. Ball

and to God, had one line changed
and another cut.
All this would be forgivable if
Mr. Ball had succeeded in
mounting an interesting, exciting,
intellectual, or entertaining play.
He has not. He has given us one of
the most boring evenings in the
theater that one could ask fom a
company of professionals. How
can a play about incest, murder,
insanity and betrayal, written by
one of the greatest playwrights in
history, be boring? Ask Mr. Ball;
he's figured it out.
In addition to cutting many of
the best parts of the play, thus
drawing support from what was
left, Mr. Ball has made it difficult
for us to tell the corpses from the
living. This is not simply because
dead people in this play don't fall
down (they don't); it is because
the living may as well be dead for
all the excitement and vibrancy
they generate. I have seldom seen
such static direction, such listless
acting, on a professional stage.
Some of the characters had
moments of competence, such as
Leon Charles as the Player King.
Some were very poor, such as
Jeanne Bartlett as Ophelia and
Philip Kerr as Laertes. But in
general the acting was so
mediocre, so uninteresting, that
the characters seemed to melt into
one amorphous blob, devoid of
any differentiating qualities.
Not To Be
As for Miss Anderson, I must
confess that I am surprised and
disappointed. I was looking
forward to seeing her, as I am sure
were many others, not for just the
novelty of seeing Hamlet played
in drag, but for the experience of
seeing one of the great actresses of
our time tackle a difficult and
exacting role. I am truly sorry to
say that, whatever else she may
be, Miss Anderson is not Hamlet.
Her concept of the role is so
unique, so personal to her, that I
don't think many people will be
able to identify with it. The major
problem is that it is so much her
own that it really doesn't fit into
the context of the play very well.
Miss Anderson's Hamlet, when
faced with a crisis, begins to cry.
He cried five times during the
performace. What kind of a noble
heart is this? Hamlet kills three
people with his own hands and
sends two others to their deaths,
but when things get rough, he
starts to cry?
He is a frail, delicate fellow. He
looks like a consumptive
Romantic poet. He is humorless;
all of the biting wit that
Shakespeare gave him has
disappeared into his bitter,
introspective soul. Sometimes he
rushes through highly personal,
moving speeches with all the
emotion of a glass of warm milk;
at other times, when it matters
least, he talks and moves like the
hero in a nineteenth century
melodrama. Sometimes he acts
like a twelve year old boy at a
birthday party, sometimes like a
se v enty-year-old woman,
sometimes like Mary Martin in
Peter Pan but very seldom like the
Prince of Denmark.
So there it is. If you don't
believe me, or if you're a
masochist, the show will be
playinp at the Geary Theater in
San Francisco through October
17. Student rush tickets are
available just before curtain. Have
fun.
