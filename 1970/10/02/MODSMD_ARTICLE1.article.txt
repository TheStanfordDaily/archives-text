# NLRB Action
## Teamster Bid Rejected 
### ED KOHN 
In a surprise move yesterday, the
hearing examiner at the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) hearings on
the Stanford labor situation indicated
that the Teamsters Union petition to
represent the Physical Plant workers
would be rejected by the NLRB at the
regional level.
The officer's statement was reported
to the Daily by labor representatives
present at an off-the-record session
before the regular hearing began in San
Francisco.
Several of the intervening groups
reacted angrily to the unforseen turn of
events at the hearing.
The officer did indicate, however,
that he would recommend approval of
petitions submitted by the Stanford
Police Officers Association and the
International Association of Fire
Fighters (AFL-CIO) on the basis of
previous decisions. NLRB approval
would permit the two groups to
become bargaining agents for most of
the police and fire department officers.
The hearing officer indicated that
the Teamsters' petition would be
rejected because the organization had
not chosen a sufficiently large
"bargaining unit" as a basis for the
petition. Unless the Teamsters or
another group files a new petition
showing a larger base of support, the
hearings will probably terminate at the
close of Monday's session.
The Teamsters have yet to enter
testimony in the hearing record in their
own behalf and have not completed
cross-examination of the University
witnesses who testified during the
previous seven sessions.
CSEA Unit Possible
In addition to recommending
acceptance of the police and firemen's
unions, the hearing officer also
indicated that he would recommend
that the University accept a bargaining
unit along the lines of a unit proposed
at the hearing by the California School
Employees Association (CSEA), the
Stanford Employee Association's
parent organization.
Speaking on KZSU last night,
President Lyman indicated that the
University would accept the officer's
recommendations and would recognize
the three labor organizations.
"Stanford still believes that all
members of its regular staff, clerical
and others. . . have a substantial
community of interest. But I believe
that a settlement along the lines
proposed by the hearing officer would,
under the circumstances, seem to be in
Stanford's interest, and not contrary to
the interest of any of its employees.

"I have therefore authorized our
counsel to try to work out a
compromise along the lines proposed,"
he said.
Lyman defined the bargaining unit
recommended by the hearing officer as
being "composed of all other staff
(than the tire and police department
employees, and some of the Stanford
Press employees, who have or will
receive collective bargaining
recognition); that is, non-faculty,
non-teaching employees, except
professionals, supervisors and
employees whose jobs are chiefly
clerical in nature."
The major change in the University's
previously stated position, he said
"would be that we would agree to
exclude our clerical employees from
this unit."
1700 Workers Included
The proposed bargaining unit would
contain about 1 700 workers, Lyman
told the Daily last night. According to
figures compiled by the United
Stanford Employees (USE), there are
nearly an equal number of employees,
mostly women, who are classified as
clerical employees and would not be
considered a part of the bargaining
unit.
Lyman said that the proposed
bargaining effort "will not exclude our
faculty, our teaching staff, or our other
professional employees from engaging
in collective labor activity.
"These employees," he said, "would
simply not be involved in the elections
which might result from the current
proceedings."
Groups React
Several of the groups involved in the
NLRB hearings expressed anger at
yesterday's turn of events.
The Physical Plant workers involved
in the Teamsters Union organizing
effort there held an emergency meeting
last night to assess the situation. No
results of the meeting were available at
press time.
The Workers Action Caucus (WAC),
the most radical labor group on
campus, reacted swiftly to the
foreshortening of the hearings. Bob
Griffin, a WAC spokesman, said that
the group planned to leaflet the campus
today asking staff members to attend
Monday's hearing at the Federal
Building in San Francisco. He also said
a rally was planned for noontime
Tuesday to "lay the situation out for
the Stanford workers."
Elections Possible Soon
USE, the largest on-campus group,
planned no immediate action. However,
it will hold an executive committee

meeting tonight in the Medical School.
Jim Berk, the USE representative at the
hearings, said that elections "might be
held in 30 or 31 days."
He said that the correspondence
between Lyman's acceptance of the
hearing officer's tentative
recommendations and the CSEA
bargaining unit representation looked
like a "sweetheart contract." Berk
denied charges leveled at him by SEA
that he had been collaborating with the
Teamster Union's lawyer at the
hearings or that USE had intended to
delay or disrupt the hearings.
He said that USE had intervened
only to protect the interests and
futures of the workers that the group
already represents.
"We are trying to organize people,
not votes," he said.
Robert M. Nelson, the University's
Director of Personnel and Employee
Relations, was unavailable for comment
last night.

MORE UNIONS ON CAMPUS?—The sole unions on campus which are limited to the Stanford Press may soon have company
if labor hearings in San Francisco decide that firemen, policemen, and non-clerical staff may collectively bargain.
