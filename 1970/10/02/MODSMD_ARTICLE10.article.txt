# Snitches & Oppression

This prison has the atmosphere of an airport waiting room. People
sit around reading, smoking, killing time. Bland instrumental music is
piped around the camp. Occasionally during the day a woman's voice
will be heard on the p.a. system. With peachy, stewardess-style
intonation, she says, "Will Huey P. Newton, Sirhan Sirhan and Alan
Capone please report to Building 4."
You could also compare jail to a high school, a university, a
hospital, the army, or a factory, particularly in regard to patterns of
authority and the tendency to destroy the will and identity of the
mass.
I suspect that these similarities are not accidental or superficial.
Imperialist society puts its mark on every institution. What is common
to such institutions is the aim of efficiently processing human material
for some end that is neither comprehended by the individual nor
within his power to effect. Jail is just one case and not an extreme one
at that.
When I first came to jail I was unable to piss for about 2 4 hours.
Although I had faiily good control of my mind, my body was
terrified.
Problem Worsens
For most of this time I was in an area of the County Jail known as
the Snake Pits, which consists of 16-man cells. I was very
uncomfortable. Four or five times during that first day and night I got
out of my bunk, near the front of the cell, and walked past 12 or 14
strangers to the shitter which was at the back. Each time I stood over
the filthy white bowl and strained, sweated, became feverish.
Sometimes I was able to squeeze out a few drops but the problem got
worse. My entire nervous system was working against me.
"Snitches exist on the street and
on the campus as well."
Finally I found a psychological solution. I concentrated on Richard
Lyman. If Richard Lyman were here, I thought, would he be able to
piss? Not a chance. If I felt threatened by this jail and its inhabitants,
that tool of the ruling class would have to be a thousand times worse
off. He wouldn't be able to piss for a hundred years.
With this thought, things began to flow.

"Snitch" is a word used frequently in jail. It is used to describe
certain people whose behavior is important to prisoners.
Snitching
A snitch is an informer—a person who goes to the bulls (guards)
and says that so-and-so is shooting stuff or so-and-so is selling reds or
that certain people were having a pillow fight.
All kinds of illegal things go on in jail. Because people are packed
together, everyone is vulnerable to the snitch. Therefore the snitch is
dealt with very harshly when exposed.
One common method is to cover the snitch with a blanket and beat
him until he has the consistency of chocolate pudding or jello (which
is what you get every day in jail and what you will eat for a long time
if the snitch gets you in more trouble). In other prisons snitches are
often punctured with sharp instruments. This happened recently at
San Quentin, where a man suddenly died in the audience during a
rock concert. No one saw what happened, but somehow this man was
punctured many times.
"Prisoners are a class—a severely
oppressed class—andclass traitors
cannot be tolerated
This may seem brutal, but it is necessary. Prisoners are a class—a
severely oppressed class—and class traitors cannot be tolerated. In
most cases snitches are people who are trying to gain extra privileges
or even set themselves free by cooperating with the oppressor. This
destroys what solidarity exists among prisoners. Without solidarity,
prisoners are completely at the mercy of the system. Things are bad
enough without snitches.
Snitches exist on the street and on the campus as well. For
example, I am here due to the efforts of two student snitches named
Roger Reed and Ray White, who wrote a letter to the D.A. charging
me with breaking glass and who subsequently testified against me in
court.
Of course I would not advocate revenge against Roger Reed and
Ray White. I have done most of my time and have learned many
useful lessons here in jail. But it is possible that those of you out there
in minimum security should consider taking a hard line on snitches as
in the practice in Elmwood University.
Violate Solidarity
Snitches violate the principle of solidarity among oppressed
peoples, and this principle is just as vital outside prison as it is inside.
(We don't need to go into the question of exactly how Stanford
students—sons and daughters of imperialism's ruling class—are
oppressed. This is a complicated psychological and material question.
It is enough to say that certain Stanford students have chosen to fight

on the side of the oppressed, which puts them at least for a time
among the oppressed.)
Last spring many Stanford students were acting in solidarity with
the victims of imperialism—the Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laotians
and to some degree all the peoples of the Third World. Snitches
certainly did not act in the interests of students and activists. I am
living proof of this. I do not like jail, and feel that the snitches were
harmful to me.
But the peoples of Southeast Asia and the Third World are in a
much more precarious position. They are being killed every day by
agents of U.S. imperialism.
"It is no exaggeration to say that
snitches ... are accomplices in
mass murder
The invasion of Cambodia and events which followed showed that
students and activists can have some inhibiting effect on U.S.
imperialism. To the degree that snitches damage the Movement in this
country, they are making it that much easier for imperialism to kill
innocent and freedom-loving people around the world.
It is no exaggeration to say that snitches like Roger Reed and Ray
White are accomplices in mass murder.
In some cases the motives of these snitches are similar to the
motives of snitches in prison—they hope to make a good deal for
themselves. Roger Reed, for example, has built his campus political
career into a job as campaign assistant to George Murphy. Since
Roger's political career was based on snitching, it is clear that
snitching has carried him on to bigger and better things.
Roger and Ray
It might be said that snitches like Roger and Ray cannot be blamed
for snitching on oppressed people and their allies since they do not
identify with oppressed peoples. In fact it is clear from their actions
that they number themselves among the oppressors.
But it is not the motive of snitchers that is at question, but rather
their actions and the effects that they have. Those of us who are
serious about fighting imperialism cannot tolerate snitches.
Everybody knows that those who go among people to betray them
are more disgusting and more contemptible than the enemy. But we
must deal with snitches out of logic rather than out of righteous
emotions. Snitches put people in jail. Snitches help kill Vietnamese.
Take care of snitches.

me with breaking glass and who subsequently testified against me in
court.
Of course I would not advocate revenge against Roger Reed and
Ray White. I have done most of my time and have learned many
useful lessons here in jail. But it is possible that those of you out there
in minimum security should consider taking a hard line on snitches as
in the practice in Elmwood University.
Violate Solidarity
Snitches violate the principle of solidarity among oppressed
peoples, and this principle is just as vital outside prison as it is inside.
(We don't need to go into the question of exactly how Stanford
students—sons and daughters of imperialism's ruling class—are
oppressed. This is a complicated psychological and material question.
It is enough to say that certain Stanford students have chosen to fight

on the side of the oppressed, which puts them at least for a time
among the oppressed.)
Last spring many Stanford students were acting in solidarity with
the victims of imperialism—the Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laotians
and to some degree all the peoples of the Third World. Snitches
certainly did not act in the interests of students and activists. I am
living proof of this. I do not like jail, and feel that the snitches were
harmful to me.
But the peoples of Southeast Asia and the Third World are in a
much more precarious position. They are being killed every day by
agents of U.S. imperialism.
"It is no exaggeration to say that
snitches ... are accomplices in
mass murder
The invasion of Cambodia and events which followed showed that
students and activists can have some inhibiting effect on U.S.
imperialism. To the degree that snitches damage the Movement in this
country, they are making it that much easier for imperialism to kill
innocent and freedom-loving people around the world.
It is no exaggeration to say that snitches like Roger Reed and Ray
White are accomplices in mass murder.
In some cases the motives of these snitches are similar to the
motives of snitches in prison—they hope to make a good deal for
themselves. Roger Reed, for example, has built his campus political
career into a job as campaign assistant to George Murphy. Since
Roger's political career was based on snitching, it is clear that
snitching has carried him on to bigger and better things.
Roger and Ray
It might be said that snitches like Roger and Ray cannot be blamed
for snitching on oppressed people and their allies since they do not
identify with oppressed peoples. In fact it is clear from their actions
that they number themselves among the oppressors.
But it is not the motive of snitchers that is at question, but rather
their actions and the effects that they have. Those of us who are
serious about fighting imperialism cannot tolerate snitches.
Everybody knows that those who go among people to betray them
are more disgusting and more contemptible than the enemy. But we
must deal with snitches out of logic rather than out of righteous
emotions. Snitches put people in jail. Snitches help kill Vietnamese.
Take care of snitches.
D. McGuire is a former graduate student at Stanford and former
member of the Resistance. He now belongs to the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union. D. is currently serving a 30-day sentence in
Elmuiood Rehabilitation Center.
This prison has the atmosphere of an airport waiting room. People
sit around reading, smoking, killing time. Bland instrumental music is
piped around the camp. Occasionally during the day a woman's voice
will be heard on the p.a. system. With peachy, stewardess-style
intonation, she says, "Will Huey P. Newton, Sirhan Sirhan and Alan
Capone please report to Building 4."
You could also compare jail to a high school, a university, a
hospital, the army, or a factory, particularly in regard to patterns of
authority and the tendency to destroy the will and identity of the
mass.
I suspect that these similarities are not accidental or superficial.
Imperialist society puts its mark on every institution. What is common
to such institutions is the aim of efficiently processing human material
for some end that is neither comprehended by the individual nor
within his power to effect. Jail is just one case and not an extreme one
at that.
When I first came to jail I was unable to piss for about 2 4 hours.
Although I had faiily good control of my mind, my body was
terrified.
Problem Worsens
For most of this time I was in an area of the County Jail known as
the Snake Pits, which consists of 16-man cells. I was very
uncomfortable. Four or five times during that first day and night I got
out of my bunk, near the front of the cell, and walked past 12 or 14
strangers to the shitter which was at the back. Each time I stood over
the filthy white bowl and strained, sweated, became feverish.
Sometimes I was able to squeeze out a few drops but the problem got
worse. My entire nervous system was working against me.
"Snitches exist on the street and
on the campus as well."
Finally I found a psychological solution. I concentrated on Richard
Lyman. If Richard Lyman were here, I thought, would he be able to
piss? Not a chance. If I felt threatened by this jail and its inhabitants,
that tool of the ruling class would have to be a thousand times worse
off. He wouldn't be able to piss for a hundred years.
With this thought, things began to flow.

"Snitch" is a word used frequently in jail. It is used to describe
certain people whose behavior is important to prisoners.
Snitching
A snitch is an informer—a person who goes to the bulls (guards)
and says that so-and-so is shooting stuff or so-and-so is selling reds or
that certain people were having a pillow fight.
All kinds of illegal things go on in jail. Because people are packed
together, everyone is vulnerable to the snitch. Therefore the snitch is
dealt with very harshly when exposed.
One common method is to cover the snitch with a blanket and beat
him until he has the consistency of chocolate pudding or jello (which
is what you get every day in jail and what you will eat for a long time
if the snitch gets you in more trouble). In other prisons snitches are
often punctured with sharp instruments. This happened recently at
San Quentin, where a man suddenly died in the audience during a
rock concert. No one saw what happened, but somehow this man was
punctured many times.
"Prisoners are a class—a severely
oppressed class—andclass traitors
cannot be tolerated
This may seem brutal, but it is necessary. Prisoners are a class—a
severely oppressed class—and class traitors cannot be tolerated. In
most cases snitches are people who are trying to gain extra privileges
or even set themselves free by cooperating with the oppressor. This
destroys what solidarity exists among prisoners. Without solidarity,
prisoners are completely at the mercy of the system. Things are bad
enough without snitches.
Snitches exist on the street and on the campus as well. For
example, I am here due to the efforts of two student snitches named
Roger Reed and Ray White, who wrote a letter to the D.A. charging

for some end that is neither comprehended by the individual nor

When I first came to jail I was unable to piss for about 2 4 hours.
Although I had faiily good control of my mind, my body was
terrified.
Problem Worsens
For most of this time I was in an area of the County Jail known as
the Snake Pits, which consists of 16-man cells. I was very
uncomfortable. Four or five times during that first day and night I got
out of my bunk, near the front of the cell, and walked past 12 or 14
strangers to the shitter which was at the back. Each time I stood over
the filthy white bowl and strained, sweated, became feverish.
Sometimes I was able to squeeze out a few drops but the problem got
worse. My entire nervous system was working against me.
"Snitches exist on the street and
on the campus as well."
Finally I found a psychological solution. I concentrated on Richard
Lyman. If Richard Lyman were here, I thought, would he be able to
piss? Not a chance. If I felt threatened by this jail and its inhabitants,
that tool of the ruling class would have to be a thousand times worse
off. He wouldn't be able to piss for a hundred years.
With this thought, things began to flow.

"Snitch" is a word used frequently in jail. It is used to describe
certain people whose behavior is important to prisoners.
Snitching
A snitch is an informer—a person who goes to the bulls (guards)
and says that so-and-so is shooting stuff or so-and-so is selling reds or
that certain people were having a pillow fight.
All kinds of illegal things go on in jail. Because people are packed
together, everyone is vulnerable to the snitch. Therefore the snitch is
dealt with very harshly when exposed.
One common method is to cover the snitch with a blanket and beat
him until he has the consistency of chocolate pudding or jello (which
is what you get every day in jail and what you will eat for a long time
if the snitch gets you in more trouble). In other prisons snitches are
often punctured with sharp instruments. This happened recently at
San Quentin, where a man suddenly died in the audience during a
rock concert. No one saw what happened, but somehow this man was
punctured many times.
"Prisoners are a class—a severely
oppressed class—andclass traitors
cannot be tolerated
This may seem brutal, but it is necessary. Prisoners are a class—a
severely oppressed class—and class traitors cannot be tolerated. In
most cases snitches are people who are trying to gain extra privileges
or even set themselves free by cooperating with the oppressor. This
destroys what solidarity exists among prisoners. Without solidarity,
prisoners are completely at the mercy of the system. Things are bad
enough without snitches.
Snitches exist on the street and on the campus as well. For
example, I am here due to the efforts of two student snitches named
Roger Reed and Ray White, who wrote a letter to the D.A. charging
me with breaking glass and who subsequently testified against me in
court.
Of course I would not advocate revenge against Roger Reed and
Ray White. I have done most of my time and have learned many
useful lessons here in jail. But it is possible that those of you out there
in minimum security should consider taking a hard line on snitches as
in the practice in Elmwood University.
Violate Solidarity
Snitches violate the principle of solidarity among oppressed
peoples, and this principle is just as vital outside prison as it is inside.
(We don't need to go into the question of exactly how Stanford
students—sons and daughters of imperialism's ruling class—are
oppressed. This is a complicated psychological and material question.
It is enough to say that certain Stanford students have chosen to fight

on the side of the oppressed, which puts them at least for a time
among the oppressed.)
Last spring many Stanford students were acting in solidarity with
the victims of imperialism—the Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laotians
and to some degree all the peoples of the Third World. Snitches
certainly did not act in the interests of students and activists. I am
living proof of this. I do not like jail, and feel that the snitches were
harmful to me.
But the peoples of Southeast Asia and the Third World are in a
much more precarious position. They are being killed every day by
agents of U.S. imperialism.
"It is no exaggeration to say that
snitches ... are accomplices in
mass murder
The invasion of Cambodia and events which followed showed that
students and activists can have some inhibiting effect on U.S.
imperialism. To the degree that snitches damage the Movement in this
country, they are making it that much easier for imperialism to kill
innocent and freedom-loving people around the world.
It is no exaggeration to say that snitches like Roger Reed and Ray
White are accomplices in mass murder.
In some cases the motives of these snitches are similar to the
motives of snitches in prison—they hope to make a good deal for
themselves. Roger Reed, for example, has built his campus political
career into a job as campaign assistant to George Murphy. Since
Roger's political career was based on snitching, it is clear that
snitching has carried him on to bigger and better things.
Roger and Ray
It might be said that snitches like Roger and Ray cannot be blamed
for snitching on oppressed people and their allies since they do not
identify with oppressed peoples. In fact it is clear from their actions
that they number themselves among the oppressors.
But it is not the motive of snitchers that is at question, but rather
their actions and the effects that they have. Those of us who are
serious about fighting imperialism cannot tolerate snitches.
Everybody knows that those who go among people to betray them
are more disgusting and more contemptible than the enemy. But we
must deal with snitches out of logic rather than out of righteous
emotions. Snitches put people in jail. Snitches help kill Vietnamese.
Take care of snitches.

This prison has the atmosphere of an airport waiting room. People

will be heard on the p.a. system. With peachy, stewardess-style
intonation, she says, "Will Huey P. Newton, Sirhan Sirhan and Alan
Capone please report to Building 4."
You could also compare jail to a high school, a university, a
hospital, the army, or a factory, particularly in regard to patterns of
authority and the tendency to destroy the will and identity of the
mass.
I suspect that these similarities are not accidental or superficial.

on the side of the oppressed, which puts them at least for a time
among the oppressed.)
Last spring many Stanford students were acting in solidarity with
the victims of imperialism—the Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laotians
and to some degree all the peoples of the Third World. Snitches
certainly did not act in the interests of students and activists. I am
living proof of this. I do not like jail, and feel that the snitches were
harmful to me.
But the peoples of Southeast Asia and the Third World are in a
much more precarious position. They are being killed every day by
agents of U.S. imperialism.
"It is no exaggeration to say that
snitches ... are accomplices in
mass murder
The invasion of Cambodia and events which followed showed that
students and activists can have some inhibiting effect on U.S.
imperialism. To the degree that snitches damage the Movement in this
country, they are making it that much easier for imperialism to kill
innocent and freedom-loving people around the world.
It is no exaggeration to say that snitches like Roger Reed and Ray
White are accomplices in mass murder.
In some cases the motives of these snitches are similar to the
motives of snitches in prison—they hope to make a good deal for
themselves. Roger Reed, for example, has built his campus political
career into a job as campaign assistant to George Murphy. Since
Roger's political career was based on snitching, it is clear that
snitching has carried him on to bigger and better things.
Roger and Ray
It might be said that snitches like Roger and Ray cannot be blamed
for snitching on oppressed people and their allies since they do not
identify with oppressed peoples. In fact it is clear from their actions
that they number themselves among the oppressors.
But it is not the motive of snitchers that is at question, but rather
their actions and the effects that they have. Those of us who are
serious about fighting imperialism cannot tolerate snitches.
Everybody knows that those who go among people to betray them
are more disgusting and more contemptible than the enemy. But we
must deal with snitches out of logic rather than out of righteous
emotions. Snitches put people in jail. Snitches help kill Vietnamese.
Take care of snitches.

This prison has the atmosphere of an airport waiting room. People
sit around reading, smoking, killing time. Bland instrumental music is
piped around the camp. Occasionally during the day a woman's voice
will be heard on the p.a. system. With peachy, stewardess-style
intonation, she says, "Will Huey P. Newton, Sirhan Sirhan and Alan
Capone please report to Building 4."
You could also compare jail to a high school, a university, a
hospital, the army, or a factory, particularly in regard to patterns of
authority and the tendency to destroy the will and identity of the
mass.
I suspect that these similarities are not accidental or superficial.
Imperialist society puts its mark on every institution. What is common
to such institutions is the aim of efficiently processing human material
for some end that is neither comprehended by the individual nor
within his power to effect. Jail is just one case and not an extreme one
at that.
When I first came to jail I was unable to piss for about 2 4 hours.
Although I had faiily good control of my mind, my body was
terrified.
Problem Worsens
For most of this time I was in an area of the County Jail known as
the Snake Pits, which consists of 16-man cells. I was very
uncomfortable. Four or five times during that first day and night I got
out of my bunk, near the front of the cell, and walked past 12 or 14
strangers to the shitter which was at the back. Each time I stood over
the filthy white bowl and strained, sweated, became feverish.
Sometimes I was able to squeeze out a few drops but the problem got
worse. My entire nervous system was working against me.
"Snitches exist on the street and
on the campus as well."
Finally I found a psychological solution. I concentrated on Richard
Lyman. If Richard Lyman were here, I thought, would he be able to
piss? Not a chance. If I felt threatened by this jail and its inhabitants,
that tool of the ruling class would have to be a thousand times worse
off. He wouldn't be able to piss for a hundred years.
With this thought, things began to flow.

"First let us learn language from the masses. The people's
vocabulary is rich, vigorous, vivid and expressive of real life. "
Mao Tse-tung
Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing
"Snitch" is a word used frequently in jail. It is used to describe
certain people whose behavior is important to prisoners.
Snitching
A snitch is an informer—a person who goes to the bulls (guards)
and says that so-and-so is shooting stuff or so-and-so is selling reds or
that certain people were having a pillow fight.
All kinds of illegal things go on in jail. Because people are packed
together, everyone is vulnerable to the snitch. Therefore the snitch is
dealt with very harshly when exposed.
One common method is to cover the snitch with a blanket and beat
him until he has the consistency of chocolate pudding or jello (which
is what you get every day in jail and what you will eat for a long time
if the snitch gets you in more trouble). In other prisons snitches are
often punctured with sharp instruments. This happened recently at
San Quentin, where a man suddenly died in the audience during a
rock concert. No one saw what happened, but somehow this man was
punctured many times.
"Prisoners are a class—a severely
oppressed class—andclass traitors
cannot be tolerated
This may seem brutal, but it is necessary. Prisoners are a class—a
severely oppressed class—and class traitors cannot be tolerated. In
most cases snitches are people who are trying to gain extra privileges
or even set themselves free by cooperating with the oppressor. This
destroys what solidarity exists among prisoners. Without solidarity,
prisoners are completely at the mercy of the system. Things are bad
enough without snitches.
Snitches exist on the street and on the campus as well. For
example, I am here due to the efforts of two student snitches named
Roger Reed and Ray White, who wrote a letter to the D.A. charging
me with breaking glass and who subsequently testified against me in
court.
Of course I would not advocate revenge against Roger Reed and
Ray White. I have done most of my time and have learned many
useful lessons here in jail. But it is possible that those of you out there
in minimum security should consider taking a hard line on snitches as
in the practice in Elmwood University.
Violate Solidarity
Snitches violate the principle of solidarity among oppressed
peoples, and this principle is just as vital outside prison as it is inside.
(We don't need to go into the question of exactly how Stanford
students—sons and daughters of imperialism's ruling class—are
oppressed. This is a complicated psychological and material question.
