Marshall and Bill:
We were disappointed to see in
your September 30, 1970 issue of
The Daily that you would wilfully
jeopardize the success of the Sly
Stone Concert by casting doubt
on the character of the group.
Black Students on this campus
felt that your caption under the
picture of Sly and the Family
Stone was but another of the
many racists slights that they
must endure. This group is
considered by both Black and
white to be one of the top five
groups in the nation, and thus
should they be treated.

The Black Student Union
would like to make it very clear
that it is in full support of the
October 9th concert, and that it
will do everything within its
power to make it a success. This
concert can serve both our
communities some good. We
sincerely hope you feel as we do,
and will make our support clear in
your October 2 , 1 970.
Sincerely,
Stanford Black Student Union
