# 'Neanderthalian Vision'
## McLean Denounces Gubser 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
Stuart McLean charged his
opponent Charles Gubser with a
"Neanderthal vision of history,"
in a speech here Wednesday
afternoon.
Speaking before a small
gathering of 60 in the Art
Auditorium, the Democratic
Congressional candidate
denounced Republican incumbent
Gubser for inconsistent voting
record and for applying 1950
solutions to 197 0 problems.
"We have lost the vision of
what America potentially is," he
said. "No longer do we look at the
future with optimism."
McLean laid some of the blame
for this state of affairs on Gubser
who he said "has had to be
dragged struggling by letters and
pleas into the 1 970's. He has had
a different interpretation of
history • the 1950
threat-counter-threat mentality.
"We need a Congressman to
lead us," McLean exhorted.
Convert Economy
The Democratic challenger
emphasized that a way out of the
present malaise was through the
alteration of the Bay area
economy from a defense-oriented
to a peace-oriented economy.
Reflecting on environmental
problems, he said, "There is a

contest between environmentalists
and the vested interests. I push for
regional control of air and water
pollution with real teeth in it."
Asked for his views on student
unrest, he stated, "Administrat
ion, faculty, and students should
distinguish much better between

creative social change and
destructive change. Liberty,
freedon, and order are functions
of one another. The universities
and the nation must be sensitive
to movements; don't smash the
moderates but arrest the
perpatrators of violence."

McLean speculated that he has
a good chance to win by making
the election a referendum on the
Nixon-Agnew policies.
Questioned about grievances
currently being expressed by the
Palo Alto Tenants Union against
Palo Alto land development
policies, he refused comment.
McLean, a Presbyterian
minister, was Stanford pastor
from 1964-1968. He led the
organization of Peninsula support
for the United Farm Workers
Organizing Committee and was
director of the Mid-Peninsula
Vietnam Summer. He also
sponsored an East Palo Alto racial
affairs seminar and is presently
director of the Center for the
Study of Contemporary Values at
the University of Santa Clara.
Gubser, McLean's opponent,
spent part of Monday afternoon
strolling through White Plaza
ans-wering students questions and
explaining his views.


NEW POLITICS—Stuart McLean who is running hard against
incumbent Charles Gubser attacked his Republican opponent for lack
of vision and an outdated view of world politics. On campus issues,
the Democrat urged, "Don't smash the moderates, but arrest the
perpetrators of violence."
