# Film Series Cashing In
## Big Money On Tap 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Film series seem to be more
popular than bake sales and
scalping football tickets as a way
of making money these days.
Unfortunately, rather than
offering interesting and intelligent
films that would be worth
spending the time and money to
see, most of the enterprising film
organizations have seen fit to
offer commercial films with the
greatest gross potential.
The Sunday Flicks are no
longer what they used to be, but
then Stanford is a progressive
institution. Now on Sunday nights
you can sit in Memorial
Auditorium in the most
uncomfortable seats ever designed
and see the latest Hollywood hits
for only 5 oc.
The International Association
Film Series is the only non-profit
series offered as a public service
which attempts to expose the

Stanford community to seldom
seen first rate European and Asian
films. $1.50 entitles you to ten
films, one every Thursday for the
next quarter.
On Saturdays, Tresidder will
offer another outstanding series,
French Films before the New
Wave. Included among the films
to be shown are those of Jean
Renoir, Rene Clair, Jean Cocteau,
and Max Ophuls.
This evening a slightly revised
and updated version of "Inherit
the Wind," "Planet of the Apes,"
will be shown at 7:30, 9:30 and
11:30 in Dinkelspiel. Arthur P.
Jacobs deserves a prize for making
Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall
and Maurice Evans look like
monkeys. Charlton Heston plays
the naked ape.
A 195 9 Hitchcock thriller,
"North by Northwest," starring
Gary Grant, Eva Marie Saint,
Grace Kelly, Martin Landau,
James Mason, and Leo G. Carroll

will also be shown tonight at 7 :30
and 9:4 5 in Cubberley.
One of the most significant
films since 1801, Orson Welles'
"Citizen Kane" will start the
Willes Series this evening at 7 , 8 .
and 9 in Tresidder Union. 1 highly
recommend that you see it. Welles
was twenty five years old when he
made this controversial film in
1941 of the life of William
Randolph Hearst. Kane's
(Hearst's) egotism is only matched
by Welles'. When asked if he had
the sensation of making such an
important film during the
shooting, Welles replied: "I never
doubted it for a single instant."
Saturday, a science-fiction
horror triple feature will be
presented in Memorial
Auditorium by Cosmic Films.
"Them," filmed on location in the
sewers of Los Angeles" will be
shown at 7:30, followed at 9 by
"The Incredible Shrinking Man"
and at 10:30 by the incredible
"King Kong".
The Contemporary Cinema
Society is starting its season with
another realized Fellini fantasy,
"Juliet of the Spirits." The film is
difficult to describe, but as one
reviewer put it, "Spirits" is "a
meditative fantasy on the real and
the imaginary, an exploration of
the paths of realism." However, as
Fellini puts it: "a film is made,
not told about." See a film made
by Fellini at 7:30 and 9:45 in
Cubberley.
An extraordinary work of film
art, "Rules of the Game" by Jean
Renoir will be shown Saturday in
Tresidder Union at 7, 8, and 9.
The lives of the people at a large
house party serve as an analogy of
society and the "world in
motion."
