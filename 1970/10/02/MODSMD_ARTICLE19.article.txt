# Usher Passes Available
## 
### 
For the price of one hour's work, students this year will be able to
see theater, symphony, and opera performances at San Francisco
theaters.
Students may sign up for ushering passes for such shows as "Hair",
"Promises! Promises!", "Hamlet", plus other A.C.T. shows, and opera
and symphony concerts at the San Francisco Opera House.
Sign ups will be conducted each week at the Box Office at
Tresidder Union, beginning at 10 a.m. on Tuesday for performances
the following week-end. Passes will be issued on a
first-come-first-served basis. Student body cards must be presented to
receive passes.
As an usher, a student must arrive at the theater one hour to
one-and-a-half hours before the performance begins. Before the show
starts he may be asked to help prepare programs for distribution, then
to show patrons to their seats.
After the performance begins and late-comers have been shown to
their seats, ushers may usually take available seats, following the
directions of the head usher.
Further information on ushering is available at the Tresidder Union
Box Office.
