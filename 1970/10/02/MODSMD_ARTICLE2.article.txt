# Millions Of Mourners Cause Near Riot At Nasser Funeral
## 
### 
CAIRO - Millions of Egyptians
hysterical with grief turned Gamal
Abdel Nasser's state funeral into a near
riot Thursday, breaking up the solemn
procession of visiting world leaders and
sometimes halting the caisson bearing
the body.
"Nasser is not dead, Nasser is not
dead," crowds screamed in unison.
They followed to Nasser's grave,
breaking past guards as the body,
wrapped in a white shroud according to
Moslem custom, was laid to rest in a
palm-shaded garden of Manshiet el
Bakry mosque.
Egyptian leaders stood with tears
streaming down their faces as they
listened to the solemn words of Sheik
Mohammed Fahham, Egypt's religious
leader: "Allah is great."

to the graveside.
Mrs. Nasser was not present at the
graveside. She remained at Arab
Socialist Union headquarters to watch
the funeral procession. She collapsed in
grief and was attended by her
husband's personal physician, L)r.
Sawry Habib. With her were her two
daughters, Uoda, 25, and Mona, 23.
The Nassers' three sons were in the
procession. Abdul Hamid, 21, a naval

officer, was in the military cortege.
Abdul Hakim, 19, and Rallied, 22,
walked behind their father's body.
Egypt's acting president, Anwar
Sadat, collapsed early in the funeral
parade and it was reported later that he
had suffered a heart attack. London
monitors of the Middle East News
Agency said early Friday the agency
reported the attack but also said he
apparently recovered after treatment.
Sadat, 52, was carried away from
the funeral procession to a waiting car
but appeared three hours later at the
mosque during the last prayers over
Nasser's body.
The monitored report said that Ali
Sabri, ex-secretary-general of the Arab
Socialist Union, also suffered a heart
seizure. The agency attributed both
attacks to "emotionalism" because of
Nasser's death.
The kings, presidents and
government leaders from all parts of
the world who were to follow the
flag-draped coffin for a quarter of the
13-mile route dropped out after the
first 100 yards to avoid the unruly
crowd.
The galaxy of foreign leaders,
including Premier Alexei N. Kosygin of
the Soviet Union, Premier Jacques
Chaban-Delmas of France, Foreign
Secretary Alex Douclas-Home of

Britain, and U.S. Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare Elliot
Richardson, were escorted back to their
residences by heavily armed military
escorts.
More than 50,000 blue and red
bereted commando and parachute
troops and crack infantrymen, aided by
scores of armored cars and a squadron
of mounted cavalry with swords drawn,
failed to bring the crowd fully under
control despite hours of desperate
efforts.
The pandemonium reached its
height at the end of the three-hour
procession as Nasser's body was moved
from the coffin and laid to rest in the
garden of the recently completed
mosque.
Masses of screaming mourners,
surged through barbed-wire barriers and
cordons of troops into the garden and
all but seized the plain wooden coffin.
