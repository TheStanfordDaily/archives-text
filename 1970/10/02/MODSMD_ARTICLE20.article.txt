# S.F. Opera Offers Varied Repertoire
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The San Francisco Opera 1970
season presents many prospects to
be eagerly awaited, a few
prospects to rue, and some to
dread as well. The repertory
contains an unusual number of
very popular operas, though
within this traditional framework
the casting — with many
interesting debuts announced —
has proven more adventurous.
Regine Crespin — indisposed at
the opening performances of
Tosca — is now reinstated and
should prove a formidable
heroine. Ludovic Spiess is singing
the role of Cavaradossi; Cornell
MacNeil is the Scarpia, and one of
Italy's leading conductors, Carlo
Felice Cillario, made his debut in
S.F. on opening night.
Sir Geraint Evans will sing
Falstaff and make his debut as
stage director as well. SF's
premiere farceuse, Mary Costa, is
Mistress Ford, and the Met's Lili
Chookasian takes over for the
previously announced Regina
Resnik as Mistress Quickly. Last
season's most striking debut
artists, Margaret Price and Stuart
Burrows, are cast as the young
lovers.
James McCracken is the
ostensible owner of the role of
Otello, and he returns again as the
Moor this season. Though better
vocalism could be wished (as his
recent recording of Otello
suggests), his dramatic presence is
always impressive. Raina
Kabaivanska is to be Desdemona,
and the new Greek baritone
Kostas Paskalis makes his SF
debut as lago.
One can almost predict the
new production of Mozart's Cosi
fan tutte will be the highlight of
the season. On paper it looks

unsurpassable. Ponnelle, whose
Cenerentola last year was a
triumphant tour de force, will
again design and direct. Teresa
Berganza will apply her
mellifluous mezzo-soprano voice
to the role of Dorabella, and the
superb singing comedian Renato
Capecchi will be Don Alfonso.
The Strauss opera this year is
Salome, revived quickly after the
stunning impact of 1968.
Unfortunately, Anja Silja is being
revived in the title role. Vocally,
Silja's career has been perhaps the
most consistently tenuous in
recent memory, though she
possesses a Callaslike dramatic
sophistication. The role, however,
demands some vocal ingenuity
and resources (witness the success
on records of the coloratura
Montserrat Caballe in the role),
which Silja does not command.
SF will be treated to an
appearance of the reigning
Wagnerian soprano Birgit Nilsson
in her most famous role of Isolde.
However, more attention may be
directed to the debut of Jon
Vickers as Tristan. The part is
some distance technically from
Don Jose (which is suggestive of
his metier), though any attempt
to bolster the very thin ranks of
Wagnerian tenors must be
applauded.
The final installment of the
Ring Cycle project, Siegfried,
features Jess Thomas in the title
role, Berit Lindholm as
Brunnhilde, and Thomas Stewart
as the Wanderer. The cycle has
suffered from mediocre singing,
severe cuts, and uninspired staging
and direction. With the same
personnel in charge only the
prospect of superior singing from
Lindholm and Stewart inspires
hope.
