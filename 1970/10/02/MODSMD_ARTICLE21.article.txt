# Boilermakers Here Tomorrow
## Stanford Favored In Revenge Match 
### FRED LEESON 
Revenge, should it come
tomorrow afternoon, may not be
particularly fulfilling for
Stanford's football team.
A year ago this week the
underdog Indians travelled to
Layfayette, Ind. to meet powerful
Purdue before 65 ,000 people.
The Tribe built a surprising
35-21 lead in the second half and
then watched Boilermaker
quarterback Mike Phipps
complete 13 consecutive passes,
the last one a two point
conversion t to give Purdue a 36-35
win.
Tomorrow another 60,000-plus
crowd is expected to see the 1:30
p.m. rematch.
But this time Stanford is a 19
point favorite, Purdue has scored
but two touchdowns all season
and Phipps has moved on to other
endeavors, like holding place kicks
for the Cleveland Browns.
And the two present Purdue
quarterbacks don't look like they
have any chance of completing 1 3
passes in a row since they haven't
completed 1 3 passes all season.
Sophomores Chuck Piebes and
Gary Danielson are 10 for 38 after
two games.
Piebes, who a Purdue advance
man said looked "very poor" in
the Boilermaker's 48-0 loss to
Notre Dame last week, is expected
to start.

Beyond that, first-year coach
Bob DeMoss has watched his club
suffer an extraordinary galaxy of
injuries.
First his starting center injured
his knee. Then his second string
center broke his arm. His top
fullback, John Bullock, hasn't
played yet this season because of
heel trouble and his replacement
has separated his shoulder.
Then Scott Clayton, who has
scored Purdue's only touchdowns
(in al5 -0 opening win over TCU),
injured his leg and is doubtful for
tomorrow.
So there seems to be little
threat to Stanford's perfect 3-0
record from Purdue.
But still John Ralston says,
"We have a great deal of respect
for their personnel."
Receivers Stan Brown, Ashley
Bill and Darryl Stingley can all
catch the ball if somebody can
throw it to them, and
Bullock—should he come back
strong—is an excellent runner. He
scored twice against Stanford last
year.
And the Indians have a few
problems of their own.
Ron Kadziel, Dave Tipton,
Steve Jubb and Mike Ewing will
probably stay on the sidelines
with injury problems, and Ralston
has put his team through special
kicking drills.
Place kicker Steve Horowitz

was struck with accuracy trouble
against Oregon last week, and the
Tribe again became one of the
country's few major teams which
can make the PAT an exciting
play.
Wednesday's practice included
a session on field goals and extra
points under pressure. Last
Saturday Horowitz got fine
distance on a 46 yard attempt
which flew off to the right.
Mental preparedness could also
be a factor favoring the
Boilermakers although Stanford
demonstrated last week it can
come back from a deficit coolly
and efficiently.
Purdue wasn't particularly

happy with its drubbling by Notre
Dame, and when Ralston heard
the score last week he said, "Now
they'll work like hell for us."
At the same Ralston told his
team after the Oregon victory
they would be out to represent
their conference against Purdue,
he also said they'd probably want
to keep an eye out for USC next
week, too.
Because even with an
unforseen loss to Purdue, next
week will still be next week.

point favorite, Purdue has scored
but two touchdowns all season
and Phipps has moved on to other
endeavors, like holding place kicks
for the Cleveland Browns.
And the two present Purdue
quarterbacks don't look like they
have any chance of completing 1 3
passes in a row since they haven't
completed 1 3 passes all season.
Sophomores Chuck Piebes and
Gary Danielson are 10 for 38 after
two games.
Piebes, who a Purdue advance
man said looked "very poor" in
the Boilermaker's 48-0 loss to
Notre Dame last week, is expected
to start.

Beyond that, first-year coach
Bob DeMoss has watched his club
suffer an extraordinary galaxy of
injuries.
First his starting center injured
his knee. Then his second string
center broke his arm. His top
fullback, John Bullock, hasn't
played yet this season because of
heel trouble and his replacement
has separated his shoulder.
Then Scott Clayton, who has
scored Purdue's only touchdowns
(in al5 -0 opening win over TCU),
injured his leg and is doubtful for
tomorrow.
So there seems to be little
threat to Stanford's perfect 3-0
record from Purdue.
But still John Ralston says,
"We have a great deal of respect
for their personnel."
Receivers Stan Brown, Ashley
Bill and Darryl Stingley can all
catch the ball if somebody can
throw it to them, and
Bullock—should he come back
strong—is an excellent runner. He
scored twice against Stanford last
year.
And the Indians have a few
problems of their own.
Ron Kadziel, Dave Tipton,
Steve Jubb and Mike Ewing will
probably stay on the sidelines
with injury problems, and Ralston
has put his team through special
kicking drills.
Place kicker Steve Horowitz

was struck with accuracy trouble
against Oregon last week, and the
Tribe again became one of the
country's few major teams which
can make the PAT an exciting
play.
Wednesday's practice included
a session on field goals and extra
points under pressure. Last
Saturday Horowitz got fine
distance on a 46 yard attempt
which flew off to the right.
Mental preparedness could also
be a factor favoring the
Boilermakers although Stanford
demonstrated last week it can
come back from a deficit coolly
and efficiently.
Purdue wasn't particularly

happy with its drubbling by Notre
Dame, and when Ralston heard
the score last week he said, "Now
they'll work like hell for us."
At the same Ralston told his
team after the Oregon victory
they would be out to represent
their conference against Purdue,
he also said they'd probably want
to keep an eye out for USC next
week, too.
Because even with an
unforseen loss to Purdue, next
week will still be next week.

THE LEADER—Stanford fullback Hillary Shockley, shown above
dragging an Oregon defender into the endzone, leads the Pacific-8 in
scoring after three games. The powerful junior has scored five
touchdowns for 30 points. He also leads Stanford rushers with 197
yards while averaging four yards per carry.
Revenge, should it come
tomorrow afternoon, may not be
particularly fulfilling for
Stanford's football team.
A year ago this week the
underdog Indians travelled to
Layfayette, Ind. to meet powerful
Purdue before 65 ,000 people.
The Tribe built a surprising
35-21 lead in the second half and
then watched Boilermaker
quarterback Mike Phipps
complete 13 consecutive passes,
the last one a two point
conversion t to give Purdue a 36-35
win.
Tomorrow another 60,000-plus
crowd is expected to see the 1:30
