Jackson State: Dverreactwii'
WASHINGTON — The President's Commission on Campus
Unrest concluded Thursday that the deadly hail ot
shotgun, rifle and submachine gun fire by police against a
crowd of Jackson State college students was an
"unreasonable, unjustified overreaciion."
Two students were killed and 12 wounded in the May
14 incident. Police earlier said they fired only in response
to sniper fire from a women's dormitory an allegation the
commission said it was unable to substantiate.
"Even if we were to assume two shots were fired from a
window in the west wing of Alexander Hall," the
commission said, "the 28-second fusillade in response was
clearly unwarranted."
The commission added "a significant cause of the
deaths and injuries at Jackson State College is the
confidence of white officers that if they fire weapons
during a black campus disturbance they will face neither
stern departmental discipline nor criminal prosecution or
conviction."
Moreover, the panel said some city police officers
"established a pattern of deceit" by denying they had
discharged their weapons.
FBI tests later confirmed the weapons had been fired,
the commission said.
Yugoslavian Visit Ends
BELGRADE — President Nixon wound up his Yugoslavian
visit in agreement with President Tito that the United
States must pursue its Middle East peace efforts, White
House officials said Thursday night.
Nixon received an enthusiastic reception from a crowd
in Zagreb Tito's birthplace estimated by White House
officials at 1 00,000 before the two men returned to
Belgrade for the final banquet of the American President's
two-day visit.
The chaotic Middle East was a major topic in the
presidents' conversations.
Yugoslav sources said Tito believes steps must be taken
to preserve the U.S. sponsored Middle East cease-fire and
to revive the Arab-Israeli peace talks under U.N. auspicies.
White House officials said both Nixon and Tito
expressed hope that the new Egyptian leadership, still
uncertain following the death of President Gamal Abdel
Nasser, would pursue moderate policies.
Fires Spread Further
LOS ANGELES — Whipped by renewed hot winds from
the desert, brush fires burst through fire lines in two
Southern California areas Thursday, forcing evacuation of
a junior college campus.
Meanwhile, firemen fought to encircle other south state
blazes before predicted winds could flare them up again.
The Weather Bureau predicted for Friday 40 m.p.h.
Santa Ana winds, the seaward blasts which last weekend
fanned the worst series of brush fires in the state's history.
Flames caused he evacuation Thursday of 5,000
student Chal'ey Junior College and outlying portions of the
town of Alta Loma near San Bernardino. Wind gusts up to
70 miles an hour fanned the fire over 16,0 00 acres, but
firemen said no structures in the college or town were

damaged, and the blaze appeared to be halted north of
populous Ontario and Upland.
Firemen continued to mop up scattered hot spots in the
massive Laguna fire which had burned about 2 00,000 acres
up to within a few miles of the San Diego suburban area
before being controlled Wednesday night.
Latest official count had roughly 1,200 structures
burned to the ground in the Laguna fire, including up to
500 homes.
Black College Aid Hiked
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration responded to
complaints it is insensitive to Negro education by
announcing Thursday a 30 per cent increase in federal aid
for predominantly black colleges.
Secretary of Welfare Elliot L. Richardson said in a
statement the $30 million increase was ordered by
President Nixon following appeals from Negro educators.
The National Association for Equal Opportunity in
Higher Education complained recently that the
administration was ignoring the needs of black Americans
and their colleges. The association is composed of
presidents of predominantly black colleges and
universities.
The new commitment increases aid for black colleges
from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare
from $95 million a year to $125 million.
The money is for construction loans, work-study
programs, and for strengthening teaching, administrative,
and student service programs.
Cambodian Highways Cut
PHNON PENH, Cambodia - North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong forces have cut or attacked Cambodia's three most
important highways in a new drive that could strangle the
nation's capital.
The three supply and communications routes radiate
from Phnom Penh to major centers to the southeast,
southwest and northwest.
The most important of them, Route 4 connecting
Phnom Penh with the deep water port of Kompong Som,
has been closed for two days, after Communist command
troops seized control of a section of it.
In South Vietnam, the battlefields continued to remain relatively
quiet.
747 Warning Issued
WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Transportation
Safety Board said Thursday that engines of 74 7 jumbo jets
are operating at "near critical turbine temperature
conditions." The board recommended quick steps to avoid
"potentially catastrophic results ..."
The board did not call for grounding of the huge
jetliners, but urged the Federal Aviation Administration
"to initiate further expeditious actions in order to
preclude recurrence of similar failures" as that experienced
by an American Airlines 747 on Sept. 18 and an Air
France 7 4 7 on Aug. 17 .
There is evidence, the board said, that failures of 747
engines occurred as a result of operation at higher than
desirable temperatures.

BUCKLE UP FOR SAFETY—As nice as she may look, remember that it's hip capitalism. But don't worry, in Yugoslavia the
state allows small entrepreneurs to sell their wares to the public free of control.
