# Lyman Discusses Security, Plans For ROTC Phase-Out
## 
### PHIL MYER 
"Outside agencies are going to move
in and do the job" of campus police
forces if campuses cannot adequately
protect themselves, President Lyman
warned in a KZSU interview last night.
Earlier in the day Lyman had
announced to the first meeting of the
Faculty Senate that three ROTC and
20 NROTC freshmen cadets will take
classes on a non-credit basis this fall.
Lyman was upset that Army ROTC
officials had shown "no sign" of
accepting the faculty's decision to

locate ROTC activities off-campus
through "such a move is inevitable."
The evening press conference was
the first of what is to be a weekly series
of press conferences with the student
news media.
Emphasizing a theme he stressed in
his Convocation address to freshmen
last Friday, Lyman noted, "Campuses
have not shown an adequate capacity
to defend themselves against attack" in
the past, and if they cannot do so in
the future they will have to face
additional outside intervention."
New Precautions
To cope with internal disorder, new
security precautions, including the
installation of additional lighting and a
review of police beats, are being
completed.
Asked if these actions might
provoke increasingly militant attacks
on the university such as the bombing
at the University of Wisconsin, Lyman
said, "Sure, it might provoke people —
anything might provoke people." But
he expressed confidence in the new
precautions by challenging one
interviewer to tell him "how can we
succeed better while maintaining the
freedoms of the University."
Lyman denied that the film
recording of demonstrations and the
use of student photo ID cards might
intimidate the University community,
thereby repeating one facet the
McCarthy era witch-hunt.
The measures offer "no conceivable
threat to any innocent party," he said.
Deanships
Acknowledging that campus
turbulence has made a deanship a "less
attractive career than it used to •k > ,"
Lyman outlined the present efforts to
fill the numerous administrative
vacancies plaguing the University.
Lyman decribed the progress of the
efforts to provide low-cost housing in
the area as less productive. The
construction of 200 low-rent housing
units constitutes "just the bare

beginning of a solution to the problem"
he stated.
Housing Inadequate
The actual number of units "doesn't
make a dent" in the shortage, but if
this Stanford-initiated project succeeds
"that should wear down some of the
walls of opposition to doing more here
and elsewhere," he speculated. Citing
the inaction of local governments in
undertaking projects to alleviate the
housing shortage, Lyman noted that
Palo Alto "is only just beginning to
think about the problem."
University minority admissions were
hurt this year by an incapacity to
provide additional financial aid. Federal
funds allocated to such programs have
not risen in recent years, and have been
diminished by inflation.
He said the University risks
becoming a college composed only of
rich white and poor minority students
if it reserves all its scholarship aid for

the poor minority students, thus
depriving those who are less
disadvantaged but unable to foot the
total bill of a Stanford education. The
University needs those 'in between'
people for balance, he implied.
Yet, "we did reorder priorities" to
allow disadvantaged minority students
a jobless first year, he stressed.
The attempt by the Palo Alto
Tenants' Union to reach the students
met with little sympathy from Lyman
during the hour-long session. He
expressed his support for the police
department's initial request that those
establishing "tent city" leave, but he
said that he doesn't think the founders
"have really been harrassed" and that
the request to leave did not carry the
threat of immediate arrest.
Stanford has requested that Army
ROTC leave campus by giving the
Army the required one year notice of
cancellation of contract, Lyman
revealed.
