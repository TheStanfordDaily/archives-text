# Lyman Cool, Collected

### LANG ATWOOD 
Arriving a few minutes before air
time last night for a live press
conference on KZSU, President
Richard Lyman was all business. He
quickly handed Bob Beyers, director of
the University News Service, a
statement on labor relations to look
over.
Turning to the KZSU staff, Lyman
asked jokingly, "Are we going to have
an open mike? Can I say anything I
want?" Assured that he could, he said,
"I use two four letter words, life and
love."
"What's your bombshell tonight?"
someone asked.
"The University is going to close
tomorrow for good," he replied and
laughed.

Sitting down at the table with the
other panelists, Lyman rolled up his
shirt sleeves and adjusted the
microphone hanging around his neck.
Conferring with the moderator,
Lyman asked to see his opening
statement. He looked it over carefully
and glanced at a question already
phoned in.
After the moderator opened the
broadcast with his introduction, Lyman
read his opening statement rather
nervously. Even so, it outclassed the
fumbling and mispronunciations of the
other panelists.
Taking a quick sip of Coke, Lyman
remarked that the first question on
University neutrality was "rather
loaded." Nonetheless he replied
immediately with a calm, well-phrased
answer.
Marshall Kilduff, a Daily co-editor,
posed a long question on University
security steps and their effect.
"That's a long trail you've led me on
Marshall," Lyman replied while
straightening his papers.
Sitting straight in his chair, Lyman
squinted when asked if he was a
hardliner on dissent. His reply was
quick, but avoided the listener's
question, as he carefully refused to
compare himself with former President
Pitzer.
One of the few times the President
tensed up was when he was asked about
"tent city." He criticized the media for
giving it so much attention and used
hand gestures while emphasizing that
the University was doing the occupants
a favor by pointing out the extreme fire
danger.

Toying with his Coke while Bill
Evers of the Daily asked a long
question, Lyman querried, "Should I
take notes?"
"No," replied Evers, however
Lyman did jot down a few sentences.
Throughout the broadcast Lyman
looked directly at his questioner, only
occasionally looking down at a blank
piece of paper or up in the air while
formulating an answer.
He jumped right back with a quick
rebuttal when Owen Blank of KZSU
pushed him about the status of
requiring precinct work. Lyman tensed
up for a moment, but smiling he
defended his position.
Lyman used almost no notes during
the one hour conference and rarely
stumbled or repeated a phrase,
something that can't be said of the
newsmen, who largely read prepared
questions.

Often toying with his silver and blue
pen, Lyman responded very articulately
to each question. His coolness under
tough questioning rarely dissolved.
Once he winked and smiled up at
someone in the control room. They all
smiled back. He then picked up his
coke and fired off another answer.
Near the end of the hour, he
appeared quite relaxed, leaning back in
his chair while the questioning
continued.
After the broadcast concluded, he
was immediately surrounded by
panelists and other observers.
Someone asked him how he thought
the conference went.
"Par for the course," he replied
smiling. We aren't going to do an hour
every week though are we? he asked.
Having exhausted their immediate
supply of questions, the consensus of
the press was, "No we aren't."

every week though are we? he asked.
Having exhausted their immediate
supply of questions, the consensus of
the press was, "No we aren't."
Arriving a few minutes before air
time last night for a live press
conference on KZSU, President
Richard Lyman was all business. He
quickly handed Bob Beyers, director of
the University News Service, a
statement on labor relations to look
over.
Turning to the KZSU staff, Lyman
asked jokingly, "Are we going to have
an open mike? Can I say anything I
want?" Assured that he could, he said,
"I use two four letter words, life and
love."
"What's your bombshell tonight?"
someone asked.
"The University is going to close
tomorrow for good," he replied and
laughed.

Sitting down at the table with the
other panelists, Lyman rolled up his
shirt sleeves and adjusted the
microphone hanging around his neck.
Conferring with the moderator,
Lyman asked to see his opening
statement. He looked it over carefully
and glanced at a question already
phoned in.
After the moderator opened the
broadcast with his introduction, Lyman
read his opening statement rather
nervously. Even so, it outclassed the
fumbling and mispronunciations of the
other panelists.
Taking a quick sip of Coke, Lyman
remarked that the first question on
University neutrality was "rather
loaded." Nonetheless he replied
immediately with a calm, well-phrased
answer.
Marshall Kilduff, a Daily co-editor,
posed a long question on University
security steps and their effect.
"That's a long trail you've led me on
Marshall," Lyman replied while
straightening his papers.
Sitting straight in his chair, Lyman
squinted when asked if he was a
hardliner on dissent. His reply was
quick, but avoided the listener's
question, as he carefully refused to
compare himself with former President
Pitzer.
One of the few times the President
tensed up was when he was asked about
"tent city." He criticized the media for
giving it so much attention and used
hand gestures while emphasizing that
the University was doing the occupants
a favor by pointing out the extreme fire
danger.

Toying with his Coke while Bill
Evers of the Daily asked a long
question, Lyman querried, "Should I
take notes?"
"No," replied Evers, however
Lyman did jot down a few sentences.
Throughout the broadcast Lyman
looked directly at his questioner, only
occasionally looking down at a blank
piece of paper or up in the air while
formulating an answer.
He jumped right back with a quick
rebuttal when Owen Blank of KZSU
pushed him about the status of
requiring precinct work. Lyman tensed
up for a moment, but smiling he
defended his position.
Lyman used almost no notes during
the one hour conference and rarely
stumbled or repeated a phrase,
something that can't be said of the
newsmen, who largely read prepared
questions.

Often toying with his silver and blue
pen, Lyman responded very articulately
to each question. His coolness under
tough questioning rarely dissolved.
Once he winked and smiled up at
someone in the control room. They all
smiled back. He then picked up his
coke and fired off another answer.
Near the end of the hour, he
appeared quite relaxed, leaning back in
his chair while the questioning
continued.
After the broadcast concluded, he
was immediately surrounded by
panelists and other observers.
Someone asked him how he thought
the conference went.
"Par for the course," he replied
smiling. We aren't going to do an hour
every week though are we? he asked.
