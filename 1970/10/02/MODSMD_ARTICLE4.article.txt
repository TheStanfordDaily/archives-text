# Lyman Cool, Collected

### LANG ATWOOD 
Arriving a few minutes before air
time last night for a live press
conference on KZSU, President
Richard Lyman was all business. He
quickly handed Bob Beyers, director of
the University News Service, a
statement on labor relations to look
over.
Turning to the KZSU staff, Lyman
asked jokingly, "Are we going to have
an open mike? Can I say anything I
want?" Assured that he could, he said,
"I use two four letter words, life and
love."
"What's your bombshell tonight?"
someone asked.
"The University is going to close
tomorrow for good," he replied and
laughed.

Sitting down at the table with the
other panelists, Lyman rolled up his
shirt sleeves and adjusted the
microphone hanging around his neck.
Conferring with the moderator,
Lyman asked to see his opening
statement. He looked it over carefully
and glanced at a question already
phoned in.
After the moderator opened the
broadcast with his introduction, Lyman
read his opening statement rather
nervously. Even so, it outclassed the
fumbling and mispronunciations of the
other panelists.
Taking a quick sip of Coke, Lyman
remarked that the first question on
University neutrality was "rather
loaded." Nonetheless he replied
immediately with a calm, well-phrased
answer.
