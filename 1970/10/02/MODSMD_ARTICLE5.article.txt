# Several Frats Go Co-ed
## Non-Violent House Opens Doors 
### CHRIS PECK 
Every evening at 5 :30 a small group
assembles in the living room of the
former Chi Psi fraternity house for a
half hour of quiet meditation. Outside,
a man lies in the grass tapping out a
soft rhythm on a bongo drum while a
young woman moves silently through
yoga's contorted positions.
Unified around a common devotion
to non-violence these people are among
5 0 students who have created a unique
living situation out of what was a
crumbling fraternity. The fall Chi Psi
pie fight now exists only as part of this
house's creamy past. Rush, "hell week"
and the Saturday night fraternity party
have moved into a smaller house on
campus along with what once was a
50 -man Chi Psi contingent.
Gone too are the Greek letters — the
Chi Psi house is now the Columbae
House.
And the Columbae house, while
unique in character is not the only
living situation that has grown out of
the partial!v deteriorated fraternity

structure. This non-violent coed house
follows ATO and ZAP as local,
independent coed houses.
At still another fraternity, Delta
Chi, dying from bad case of waning
enthusiasm, is being reborn this fall as a
coed house for transfer students.
Fraternity Dissolved
The Delta Chi Alumni Board of
Control voted during the summer to
sell the old house to the University,
thereby officially dissolving the local
chapter. Assistant Dean of Students
John Grube, then alerted transfers to
the possibility of organizing a coed
house in the facilities.
Presently 32 transfers live in the
May field Ave. house with seven
remaining fraternity men living there as
well, serving as the business and
managerial arm of the new unit.
University administrators hope the
examples of ZAP, ATO, Columbae, and
Delta Chi may provide an answer to
financially unprofitable fraternities
now operating. CI rube, emphasized this
m a recent interview. "The University

will take a hard look at fraternities this
year, especially those which have
incurred severe financial problems," he
said. "Those fraternities in debt to
Stanford who have trouble making
debts receivable will be refrained from
going further into debt."
More Than Trend
But while the Columbae house is
part of this trend towards transforming
dying fraternities into coed houses, it is
also more than that.
"Soul force," or "Satyagraha" as
Ghandi called it, and strictly organic
foods condition the group into a
non-violent naturalistic way of life.
This fall, a series of seminars is
offered to Columbae members as well
as other University students.
"Satyagraha: Non-violence and the
Spirit" discusses the relationship
between non-violence and the human
spiritual existence. Another seminar
will discus.*; prominent individuals who
have contributed to the development
of t he non-violent cause.

Chi, dying from bad case of waning
enthusiasm, is being reborn this fall as a
coed house for transfer students.
Fraternity Dissolved
The Delta Chi Alumni Board of
Control voted during the summer to
sell the old house to the University,
thereby officially dissolving the local
chapter. Assistant Dean of Students
John Grube, then alerted transfers to
the possibility of organizing a coed
house in the facilities.
Presently 32 transfers live in the
May field Ave. house with seven
remaining fraternity men living there as
well, serving as the business and
managerial arm of the new unit.
University administrators hope the
examples of ZAP, ATO, Columbae, and
Delta Chi may provide an answer to
financially unprofitable fraternities
now operating. CI rube, emphasized this
m a recent interview. "The University

will take a hard look at fraternities this
year, especially those which have
incurred severe financial problems," he
said. "Those fraternities in debt to
Stanford who have trouble making
debts receivable will be refrained from
going further into debt."
More Than Trend
But while the Columbae house is
part of this trend towards transforming
dying fraternities into coed houses, it is
also more than that.
"Soul force," or "Satyagraha" as
Ghandi called it, and strictly organic
foods condition the group into a
non-violent naturalistic way of life.
This fall, a series of seminars is
offered to Columbae members as well
as other University students.
"Satyagraha: Non-violence and the
Spirit" discusses the relationship
between non-violence and the human
spiritual existence. Another seminar
will discus.*; prominent individuals who
have contributed to the development
of t he non-violent cause.
Every evening at 5 :30 a small group
assembles in the living room of the
former Chi Psi fraternity house for a
half hour of quiet meditation. Outside,
a man lies in the grass tapping out a
soft rhythm on a bongo drum while a
young woman moves silently through
yoga's contorted positions.
Unified around a common devotion
to non-violence these people are among
5 0 students who have created a unique
living situation out of what was a
crumbling fraternity. The fall Chi Psi
pie fight now exists only as part of this
house's creamy past. Rush, "hell week"
and the Saturday night fraternity party
have moved into a smaller house on
campus along with what once was a
50 -man Chi Psi contingent.
Gone too are the Greek letters — the
Chi Psi house is now the Columbae
House.
And the Columbae house, while
unique in character is not the only
living situation that has grown out of
the partial!v deteriorated fraternity

structure. This non-violent coed house
follows ATO and ZAP as local,
independent coed houses.
At still another fraternity, Delta
Chi, dying from bad case of waning
enthusiasm, is being reborn this fall as a
coed house for transfer students.
