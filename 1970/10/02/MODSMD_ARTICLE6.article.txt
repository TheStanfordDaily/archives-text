# The 						Face Of A Campesino
## 
### victor palomino 
Summer is gone and we are
back in school where we come to
be trained to make money, to get
a piece of paper where it says
"Stanford University", where
quite often we don't reaily care
how we get there. Anyway, there
are times when by mistake we end
up doing something else and this
happened to me this summer. A
friend of mine called up one
morning and asked me to
accompany her on a trip to
Delano.
You know, Delano is where the
grape strike began more than five
years ago; Delano is where Cesar
Chavez decided that the grape
pickers were no longer going to be

exploited; and where they had
won a hard victory after five
suffering years.
You Americans that come
from above the lower class will
never understand what it means to
be a grape picker or a lettuce
cutter or anything else about the
farm unless you have been one
yourself. And that precisely is the
problem. To pick grapes. To cut
lettuce. With your own hands.
Under the sun. Your aching back.
It is cold outside. You sweat. You
freeze.
One thing is to say that we
want to help the poor, the
oppressed of our lands and
another completely different

thing is to carry out our thinking.
We can open our mouths all we
want, but only our actions will
count toward the achievement of
justice and freedom.
Last Spring there was this huge
"silent majority", this tremendous
silent thing that opposed violence
on campus and the invasion of
Cambodia, yet I saw very few
students fighting against the plight
and the exploitation of their own
fellow Americans in the valleys of
California. Salinas, you know.
Home. It is only two or three
hours from Stanford. I suppose it
is much better to fight for justice
and freedom when they are
thousands of miles away than
when they are so close.
Perhaps some day we will begin
to realize that life is nothing but a
bullshit game where we would like
to help those who have less than
we do; that there is no heaven or
hell besides the one we make
ourselves; that drinking or no
drinking, that potting or no
potting, that killing or no killing,
that loving or not loving means
nothing unless we know what we
want to do with our lives as they
are related with those 1 who were
born less lucky than we were.
And I felt this way, one
evening. A cloudy, foggy night. It

was something coming deep from
the heart of a man. A plea tor
help. Not a desperate one, but
rather full of nobleza. I did not
feel sorry for that campesino. He
did not beg. He asked and I
believed him. His face spoke more
for him than his broken Spanish.
As I left his car, I felt sad, sort of
lonely. I felt as though we were
losing our cause. 1 decided to give
as much as I could to help and
still 1 felt lonely, sad . . . Cam
pesinos, indeed!
Then I thought that perhaps
you, Stanford students, could
help and join us in a huge,
peaceful, dusty, non-violent
movement to boycott all lettuce
that has not a black eagle; to
boycott all lettuce raised with the
sweating and aching campesino's
back, all lettuce picked by
bleeding, sick hands and arms
from the excessive use of
insecticides. And when you do
that, always remember the face of
the campesino that has asked your
help just like I shall always
remember the face of the one that
gave me a ride. To a bus station.
To leave Salinas. To come to
Stanford. To complete some
courses. To make some money.
