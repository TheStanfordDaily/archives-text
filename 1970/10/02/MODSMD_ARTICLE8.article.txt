Editor, THE DAILY:
The lead article on labor
organizations on campus, written
by Mr. Ed Kohn, which appeared
on the front page of the Oct. 1
issue of The Daily had some very
incorrect statements regarding the
labor unions at the Stanford Press.
Contrary to the story, all shop
employees are full-fledged
members of one of the four
unions representing the employees
at the Press.
In writing his story about the
labor unions it seems only logical
that Mr. Kohn should have at least

talked to some of the union
people in the shops at the Press in
order to accurately write his
story.
Those unions having signed
contracts with the University are:
Palo Alto Typographical Union
No. 521; Lithographers and
Photoengravers Union No. 17-L;
Bookbinders' and Bindery
Workers' Union No. 3; and the
Western Graphic Arts Union No.
14.
These unions have been
furnishing union help to operate
the Press facilities for over 5 0
years, and have negotiated new

wage agreements from year to
year and have always enjoyed the
fullest recognition of their
particular labor union from the
University.
Palo Alto Typographical
Union No. 521
Lithographers and Photoengravers
Union No. 17-L
Bookbinders' and Bindery Workers'
Union No. 3
Graphics Arts Union No. 14
The information about the
unions' status came from Robert
M. Nelson, the University's Direc
tor of Personnel and Employee
Relations. While not denying the

unions' longstanding service, it
should be noted that not all em
?loyees connected with the SU
ress (including those responsible
for the distribution of the prod
ucts) are union members—thus the
doubt about "full-fledged. " And,
on at least one occasion, serious
charges have been leveled at one
of the unions, the Bookbinders,
about grievance procedures and
union responsiveness.—E.K.
