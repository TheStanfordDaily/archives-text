## Mein Sommerkampf 
### david fidanque 
A lot happened in Palo Alto
this summer, but not very much
was accomplished. The scene of
political struggle quickly shifted
away from Stanford and into Palo
Alto. The principal weekly
attractions throughout the
summer were the free rock
concerts at Equitable Plaza every
Saturday night and the City
Council meetings every Monday
night. Whenever something
exciting happened it was at one of
those two places, and Tension and
Paranoia did what they could to
see that there weren't many dull
moments.
The summer began with
eviction notices being tacked onto
the homes of ten families in
downtown Palo Alto. The families
were given notice by the real
estate firm of Hare, Brewer, and
Kelley and the law firm of Crist,
Crist, and Griffiths on beha'f of
the (luy Atkinson Constri ..vion
Co. which plans to build high-cost
apartments at the site. The
surprise was not so much the
evictions themselves, but the
seeming lack of humanity on the
part of Hare, Brewer, and Kelley.
They had promised their tenants
at least 90 days notice before
eviction and help in relocation for
some of the older families. All the

tenants got was 30 days notice,
the legal minimum.
As news of the evictions
spread, many downtown residents
became aware of the fact that
eventually the entire downtown
area will be torn down and
replaced with high-cost
apartments, office buildings and
parking lots. Every old house in
the area is likely to have a
bulldozer run into it within the
next five years.
Resistance
In response to this, the Palo
Alto Tenants Union was formed
in mid-June. The Tenants Union
consisted, at first, mainly of those
who were in clear danger of being
evicted or those who already had
been. As of this writing, P.A.T.U.
consists mostly of young people
who form a good percentage of
the residents of the downtown
area. The first actions which the
Union took were to turn a vacant
lot in the 600 block of Channing
into a park open to all, and to
demand a moratorium on all
demolitions and evictions in the
downtown area.
PATU members soon began
attending the weekly City Council
meetings in an attempt to increase
community awareness of the
housing crisis and hopefully to get
the Council to take action, a
also followed by the Palo
Alto Times for almost a month.
White Panthers
At the time the Tenants Union

began to get together, the White
Panthers resumed the free weekly
Saturday night rock concerts at
the Plaza which have taken place
for the past 2 years off and on.
The stage had been set for
confrontation back in April when
the City Council passed a city
ordinance placing a ban on any
amplification system over 25
watts after 11 p.m.
The night of July 4 the
Odyssey Stone Rock Outcrop
Band played past eleven while
firecrackers were thrown at
nearby policemen and several
attempts were made to block
University Avenue. At midnight,
Palo Alto police cleared the Plaza
and arrested the seven members of
the band. The police move was
swift and forceful with several
street people being injured in the
sweep. What was intended to be
selective trashing followed and
there were three more arrests.
Mass Arrests
During the next week both the
Free You newspaper and the P.A.
Times invited people to come to
the Plaza the following Saturday.
The result was a large
heterogeneous crowd which had a
long night on July 11. The bands
packed up and went home at 10
o'clock but the people stayed
listening to a stereo record player
and waiting. At 11:45 Palo Alto A
Santa Clara County riot squad
members rushed the Plaza from
three directions in a swift move
which caught many straight
onlookers unawares. One

over-thirty couple who were
arrested had just finished seeing
"Z" at the Varsity Theater. In all,
26 3 people were arrested and
charged with misdemeanor riot.
All charges were dropped about a
month later.
The Monday following, July
13, there was a stormy City
Council meeting which resulted in
four arrests inside the chamber, at
least two people receiving head
wounds from police clubs in the
hall outside, and a sixty-year-old
woman being ejected by two
police officers. Tim Gadus,
Minister of Information of the
White Panthers, was arrested on
three charges and taken to the
basement of the Civic Center
where he was reportedly beaten
by Roger Goodyear and several
other members of the Palo Alto
Police Red Squad. The Red Squad
and police harassment had been
topics which were to be discussed
at the meeting.
United Front Formed
After that night, the United
Front was formed which consists
of the Midpeninsula Free
University, the Palo Alto Tenants
Union, the White Panthers, the
Bay Area Revolutionary UniÂ»n,
Venceremos College and the East
Palo Alto Tenants Union. Later
on in the summer, Stanford's
Radical Caucus also joined the
United Front.
From that point on the Plaza
concerts were sponsored by the
United Front and at Council
meetings people identified
themselves with the Front rather
than any individual organization.
Several Saturday nights have since
seen music past eleven with no
on-the-spot bust, but bands have
been arrested several days later.
Eventually, bands refused to play
past eleven and several attempts
to force a confrontation with
police over the sound ordinance
fizzled.
The City Council held a series
of meetings as a Committee-of
-the-Whole at Gunn High School
to discuss the housing situation
and ended up taking no action at
all. Demolitions of the homes on
Webster Street took place at the
beginning of September.
