HYPNOSIS WORKSHOP is a privately owned school of self
hypnosis. We offer a seven-week course (one hour instruc
tion a week), teaching you how to hypnotize yourself, show
ing you how to do various hypnotic phenomena, such as:
—Learning to relax deeply and quickly, as completely
as while asleep.
—Learning to increase your ability to concentrate, by
focusing your attention completely and tuning out
irrelevant stimulii.
—Reducing or eliminating pain. This potential is
already used extensively in dentistry and childbirth.
—Remembering and actually reliving past events. In
reliving past events, you can experience them emo
tionally and with all five senses, in a vivid hypnotic
dream.
—Learning to give yourself useful post hypnotic sug
gestions.
—Learning to produce altered states of consciousness,
including the ability to enhance meditation states,
and produce states of amplified awareness.
The course costs $30, with the option of a $15 refund on the
third week if you should wish to drop. There will be free
lecture-demonstrations on hypnosis and the uses of self
hypnosis at our office at 1010 Doyle Street in Menlo Park at
7:30 on these nights: Sept. 29, 30; Oct. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Come to any one of the lectures; meet the staff of Hypnosis
Workshop. If you find you are interested further, you may I
take our hypnotic susceptibility test, and —if you like— I
register for the course. Our phone is: 322-2992.
