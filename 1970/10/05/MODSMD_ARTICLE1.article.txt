# 22 Indians In Freshman Class

"I don't mind the mascot being the
Indian, but why does he have to be so
short and have such a big nose. Heck, I'm
a full-blooded Indian, and my nose isn't
big at all," comments Corrine Garza
freshman comments.
For the first time in Stanford history,
a significant portion of the freshman class
is composed of native Americans.
Twenty-two Indian students registered
at Stanford this week as the result of an
intensive recruiting program conducted
earlier this year by Indian students and
University officials.
Chris McNeil, one of the recruiters
emphasized that once admitted, the
Stanford students are not part of any
special program. They are expected to be
able to enroll in any course open to
freshmen.
"These students were not accepted on
a marginal basis," he pointed out. "Many
could have been admitted even without
the recruiting program"
Unique Program
McNeil believes the Stanford program

to be unique. "As far as I know, the other
institutions are dealing with different
groups of Indians," said the twenty-two
year old Tlingit tribe member from
Alaska. "For example, the University of
California tries to recruit Indians who are
out of school and would not otherwise be
able to attend college.
Indian students often must overcome
the handicap of a poor educational
background. McNeil branded Indian high
schools run by the Federal government as
"terrible in every sense."
Corrine Garza, one of the freshmen,
agrees. She left the public high school in
her home town of Ketchikan, Alaska in
her senior year to attend Chemawa, a
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school in
Oregon. Miss Garza found that she was
required to enroll in Home Economics
and Physical Education.
"I wasn't able to take physics or the
other courses I wanted for college," she
complains.
BIA Attitude
The Rinconada resident also resented
the attitude of some of her teachers. "In
Advanced Sewing, the teacher told me to
clean the floor," she recalls. "I told her

that the school hires people to do that.
Then she said that it was part of my
training in housekeeping."
Only about ten students in a class of
15 0 entered college after graduating from
Chemawa. Miss Garza feels the small
number of graduates pursuing a higher
education reflects on the attitude of the
BIA educators towards their pupils.
The Stanford Indian Recruitment
program was born last spring when a joint
student-staff group submitted a proposal
to Richard Lyman, then University
Provost. McNeil recalls, "We said that
Stanford could do more than it was doing
to attract Indian students."
Enthusiastic Endorsement
Lyman enthusiastically endorsed the
idea, commenting that such proposals
would help reverse "the consequences of
the nation's centuries of suppression and
neglect."
Doug Davis, associate dean of
undergraduate studies, was named to
supervise the recruitment program He
oversaw a student staff effort which
included the mailing of data to some 5 00
potential sources of freshmen, including

BIA schools, tribal councils and Upward
Bound programs.
This initial work was followed by visits
of recruiting teams, including Davis and
McNeil, to the high schools.
Ironically, at least one of the Indian
freshmen saw neither the recruiting team
nor information on the special admissions
program.
Willard Harris, a Navajo from
Shiprock, New Mexico, decided to apply
to Stanford 'after reading a University
pamphlet. He also is critical of his high
school, a public school which is about
95% Indian in composition. "I had
absolutely no help from my school
counseling program," he stated, "I did it
all independently."
Russel Red Elk, a sophomore from
Montana, was a member of one of the
recruiting teams. Though he terms his
freshman year at Stanford "a good one,"
he is happy that there are now 26 Indian
undergraduates at Stanford, as opposed
to only six in 1969. "It's different this
year," he comments, "more comforting."
Adjustment Difficult
Red Elk and McNeil believe that the

Indian freshmen may have to go through
a difficult period of adjustment. "For a
long time their minds will be occupied
questions such as 'Will I succeed? 'How
will I succeed?. " Red Elk noted.
Every freshman has to feel this plact
out," McNeil added. "That is especially
true for these students."
McNeil feels the transition from rural
communities to an urban school may also
prove a problem. He is supported by a
classic comment of Willard Harris that
"Everything across the California State
Line seems neurotic."
'Animals In Zoos'
Perhaps the most important
adjustment will have to be made by the
Stanford community at large. This
concerns the phenomenon of whites
studying Indians as if they were animals
in zoos.
Corrine Garza relates, "My school was
surrounded by small colleges such as the
Oregon College of Education. They used
to send busloads of students over to look
at us. It was part of their education."
"These students don't want to be
looked on as different," McNeil
emphasizes. "They've been peered at all
their lives."
They do, however, retain a pride in
their heritage as illustrated by their
successful efforts this summer to establish
a center for their activities. The new
Indian Cultural Center, Tecumtha, is
located in an old house on Alvarado Row.
