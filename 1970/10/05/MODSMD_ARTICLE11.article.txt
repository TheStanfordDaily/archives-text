'A Piggish, Criminal Act'
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this letter to
record my disgust with the Daily
for printing the article entitled
"Snitches and Oppression" by
Diarmuid McGuire on October 2.
First, I wish to make it clear
that I strongly disagree with the
political positions taken by Roger
Reed and Ray White. However,
McGuire's argument that he was
supporting the Vietnamese people
by breaking Stanford windows is
bullshit; and to go from there and
state further that White and Reed
are "accomplices in mass murder"
because they turned McGuire in,
is not only bullshit, but criminal.
In addition, to state that the only
proper way to deal with
"snitches" is to beat them up and
even murder them is as immoral as
dropping bombs on Vietnamese
villages. The citizens of this
community cannot allow threats
of this nature against any people
on this campus, no matter what
their political opinions. We must
learn to deal with the issues and
not aim our anger and frustration
at specific people. We can't stop
the Vietnamese war by attacking
Johnson and Nixon and we can't
solve the problems on campus by
attacking Reed and White.
For the Daily to print
McGuire's plea for revenge and
call for a lynch mob is at best
grossly irresponsible and at worst
a piggish, criminal act.

Unspeakable'
Editor, The Daily:
I am not surprised at Mr.
McGuire's attempt to terrorize
this campus into letting him
destroy it unchecked in the name
of moral superiority. But I am
shocked and outraged that the
Daily printed his column. A
newspaper editor should be
clear-headed enough to realize
that in any situation where many
men are honestly convinced of
opposing views, no one group has
the right to impose its values on
the rest by force, destruction, and
terrorism. Such tactics, whoever
stoops to them, are illegal, and it
is any citizen's duty to use legal
processes to stop them. Few
citizens are courageous enough to
do such duty in the face of threats
and intimidation, and for the
Daily to give space to anyone
encouraging criminal assault
against those who are — or against
anyone else, for that matter — is
unspeakable.

'Severest Censure'
Editor, The Daily:
Probably, the question of
whether or not Stanford will
continue to function as a
University depends upon the
general reaction to the appearance
in the Daily of a plea for a group
of students to do violence to two
named human beings. Insofar as I
can tell, Roger Reed and Ray
White were acting as responsible
citizens in reporting a criminal act
and testifying at the trial. The
vengeful call for their assasination
by D. McGuire is perhaps the
sickest thing I have read in the
Daily. I only hope that this plea
does not trigger some disturbed
mind to carry out a tragic act.
While I dimly comprehend how
D. McGuire's mind may have
spawned his invective, I cannot
understand how it came to be
printed in the Daily. I don't know
whether this indicates total
irresponsibility or compliance, but
in either case that segment of the
Daily staff which is responsible
should be subjected to the
severest censure possible.
Response and action from the
total University community is
necessary. If there is general
indifference or tolerance of
anything of this nature it is a sure
sign that Stanford is dead.

Accomplice In Acts
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. McGuire's letter of Friday
makes for interesting reading.
Undoubtedly he is entitled to his
feelings of persecution. One can
readily see the injustice of his
incarceration when we read that
he wants his friends on the
outside to avenge him and "take
care of" 2 Stanford students who
turned him in. He specifically
names his tormentors, and all
right-thinking (or should I say
left-thinking) people must agree
that these squeelers should be
"beat until they have the
consistency of chocolate-pud
ding."
I do not dispute McGuire's
right to think as he likes,
especially since he is still in
Elmwood prison. I am. however,
dismayed that you would print a
column calling for the bodily
harm of 2 specifically named
individuals. Giving widespread
circulation to his views, you have
become an accomplice to their
resultant acts.
Perhaps you should study a bit
what "journalistic responsibility"
means.

Queen Of May
Editor, The Daily:
If Diarmuid McGuire is
oppressed I am the Queen of the
May. I and a great many other
staff members will snitch or
whatever else we have to do to
keep this University from being
dragged down by those whose
sanity has deserted them. Good
solutions to haavy problems do
not come out of chaos, and we
have too many heavy problems
these days to waste time giving
importance to chaos-makers.
Pat Black
Staff member
The Daily staff was divided in
its reaction to the Diarmuid
McGuire column that appeared in
last Friday's Daily. The following
comments represent each sides
argument.
Deleting The Names
We on the Daily value the
"right of free expression" highly.
For thai reason we attempt to
provide several pages in each day's
paper as a forum for community
opinion.
Still we are not so naive as to
hold that the catch phrase, "the
right of free expression" means
that people should be able to say
whatever they want. Libel and
slander are justly illegal. What
then should we say about
McGuire's article? Should he be
able to write what he did and still
have it published?
It is not an easy question. The
right to a free forum is
fundamental. Yet, the right to live
without some fear for ones
personal safety must also be
considered basic. Where then
should the line be drawn?At what
point should we gag McGuire to
protect White and Heed?

Unfortunately, we think the
Daily went just beyond the limits
of what is just in allowing Ray
White and Roger Reed to be used
as the objects of what could be
considered death threats. We wish
that the Daily had deleted their
names and wording that positively
identified them.
We criticize, however, those
who vehemently condemn our
inclusion of the other parts of
McGuire's column. For, while we
strongly disagree with its contents
as well, we think it was probably
one of the most informative and
important articles we have printed
this year.
As Marshall says in his reply,
McGuire has an interesting history
that includes non-violent as well
as more recent violent periods.
The number of people that think
the way he thinks is growing, and
it is foolhardy to gag them. It is
important that their views be
understood.
Still many of us on the Daily
regret that White and Reed were
threatened and hope to avoid
other such incidents. —F.M.,8.F.
'Emphasizing The Seriousness'
Simply because an article
appears on the Daily's editorial
pages does not in any way mean
that the Daily staff accepts or
supports that particular view. My
reasons for printing McGuire are
pretty straightforward: his
perspective on events is unique,
and accordingly I thought to
pass it on to the readers.
I think McGuire has an
interesting history. He served in
Africa with the Peace Corps,
wrote for Newsweek, and worked
on the Daily staff two years ago.
While a McCarthy supporter, he
was arrested for standing on a
sidewalk during the Democratic
Convention in Chicago. That fall
he worked for the Resistance and
edited their newspaper, and
finally he joined the
Revolutionary Union. He wrote
occasional columns for the Daily

last spring and explained the
trashings, sit-ins, and student
strike from his perspective as a
revolutionary.
We bear a responsibility to
print unpopular and normally
unheard points of view so that the
campus can be acquainted with
these unfamilar voices. I don't
accept his formula for solving
disagree men ts or handling
enemies, but I think he has right
to free speech.
The Daily feels a responsibility
for a reader's reaction to the ideas
we print but I think the Daily
should feel an even greater one to
printing these ideas. It is hard for
me to believe that if McGuire
wanted the two students "taken
care of" he would print his plans
in 15,000 copies of the Daily.
I think that the inclusion of
Ihe names is necessary for the
sake of the column's complete
purpose. In my opinion McGuire
was emphasizing the seriousness
of his feelings and did not want to
dull the impact of his columns by
deleting names.
