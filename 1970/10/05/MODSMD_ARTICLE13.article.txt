# Panel Argues Housing Plans
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR PAUL GRUSHKIN 
The 60-unit low-to-moderate income housing planned for Palo Alto
and the 200-unit development slated for Stanford were denounced as
"just sops to quiet people down" by a member of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union (PATU) Friday night.
"A horrendous social peace is being bought, charged Jul Josepn,
who participated in a KZSU panel discussion on "The Housing Crisis.
Other members of the panel included Robert Rosenzweig, associate
provost; Louis Goldsmith, president of the Palo Alto Housing
Corporation; Don Lee and Sharon Winslow, student members of
PATU; and Paul Reimer, planner and engineer. Because the PATU is
sueing the Palo Alto City Council, no council members were present.
"The buck has been passed among the federal government, city
government, and Stanford University," Mrs. Joseph asserted.
"These developments show that enough money can be found to
keep people quiet. More money can be found," she added.
100 Evictions
Mrs. Joseph charged that more than 100 people had been evicted
from their homes in Palo Alto during the past year while the Palo Alto
Housing Corporation was obtaining final approval for the 60-unit
development, to be known as Colorado Park.
Goldsmith pointed out, however, that those who demand
immediate answers to the areas's housing problems "must
understand" that the Palo Alto development is an answer. "This is
subsidized housing," he said.
Explaining why the Palo Alto Housing Corporation is not
community controlled, Goldsmith stated "the basic issue was whether
we wanted a debating or an action group. To get something done, we
must come up with specific plans and money, and we need someone
who can help in funding."
Easier Funding
"Many people can fund low income housing," replied Don Lee.
"David Packard, who is a Stanford trustee and president of
Hewlett-Packard, has $300 million in trust, drawing $15 million in
interest. People are profiting without social responsibility."

Lee also charged that "bankers and realtors" are in charge of the
Palo Alto project, not the nonprofit housing corporation.
"Much low income housing has been destroyed while the housing
corporation has been making plans for the 60 units which aren't even
all low cost units," Lee stated.
Housing Precluded
The Palo Alto Master Plan, argued Paul Reimer, has attempted to
preclude housing. "Its impact in terms of the residents has been a
change for the worse. But PATU has been successful within the
system to pass ordinances ($500,000 to acquire land for low income
housing), and has gained the sympathy, or at least the attention of the
city," he said.
However, Mrs. Jean Hobson, president of PATU, said in a recorded
speech played at the opening of the KZSU program, that "a young,
vociferous and naive" PATU has learned that "working through
channels" does not work.
"Police-state tactics have been used against PATU and the people
on the street," she said. "Their homes have been under frequent
observation. They have been maced, clubbed, and arrested at City
Council meetings."
Misplaced Priorities
Lee stated that while Stanford had been putting forth "tentative
plans for only 200 units of low income housing, positive plans have
been going forward on the Dillingham complex which will be
responsible for another 1,5 00 jobs."
The Dillingham project, situated on land leased from Stanford, is a
convention and office center that has aroused considerable
controversy in the past year.
Associate Provost Rosenzweig replied that "the university housing
problem is larger than most of us realize, but at least the university
has begun to do something about it."
During the discussion, Rosenzweig admitted, "We were remiss in
not planning adequate housing for our employees and for the larger
student body." He also explained that there are only 200 units of
housing planned—instead of the 600-2,000 recommended by the
Wright Commission—because the area near Frenchman's Hill, where
the development is slated to be built, can only accomodate 2 00 units.

"These developments show that enough money can be found to
keep people quiet. More money can be found," she added.
100 Evictions
Mrs. Joseph charged that more than 100 people had been evicted
from their homes in Palo Alto during the past year while the Palo Alto
Housing Corporation was obtaining final approval for the 60-unit
development, to be known as Colorado Park.
Goldsmith pointed out, however, that those who demand
immediate answers to the areas's housing problems "must
understand" that the Palo Alto development is an answer. "This is
subsidized housing," he said.
Explaining why the Palo Alto Housing Corporation is not
community controlled, Goldsmith stated "the basic issue was whether
we wanted a debating or an action group. To get something done, we
must come up with specific plans and money, and we need someone
who can help in funding."
Easier Funding
"Many people can fund low income housing," replied Don Lee.
"David Packard, who is a Stanford trustee and president of
Hewlett-Packard, has $300 million in trust, drawing $15 million in
interest. People are profiting without social responsibility."

Lee also charged that "bankers and realtors" are in charge of the
Palo Alto project, not the nonprofit housing corporation.
"Much low income housing has been destroyed while the housing
corporation has been making plans for the 60 units which aren't even
all low cost units," Lee stated.
Housing Precluded
The Palo Alto Master Plan, argued Paul Reimer, has attempted to
preclude housing. "Its impact in terms of the residents has been a
change for the worse. But PATU has been successful within the
system to pass ordinances ($500,000 to acquire land for low income
housing), and has gained the sympathy, or at least the attention of the
city," he said.
However, Mrs. Jean Hobson, president of PATU, said in a recorded
speech played at the opening of the KZSU program, that "a young,
vociferous and naive" PATU has learned that "working through
channels" does not work.
"Police-state tactics have been used against PATU and the people
on the street," she said. "Their homes have been under frequent
observation. They have been maced, clubbed, and arrested at City
Council meetings."
Misplaced Priorities
Lee stated that while Stanford had been putting forth "tentative
plans for only 200 units of low income housing, positive plans have
been going forward on the Dillingham complex which will be
responsible for another 1,5 00 jobs."
The Dillingham project, situated on land leased from Stanford, is a
convention and office center that has aroused considerable
controversy in the past year.
Associate Provost Rosenzweig replied that "the university housing
problem is larger than most of us realize, but at least the university
has begun to do something about it."
During the discussion, Rosenzweig admitted, "We were remiss in
not planning adequate housing for our employees and for the larger
student body." He also explained that there are only 200 units of
housing planned—instead of the 600-2,000 recommended by the
Wright Commission—because the area near Frenchman's Hill, where
the development is slated to be built, can only accomodate 2 00 units.

The 60-unit low-to-moderate income housing planned for Palo Alto
and the 200-unit development slated for Stanford were denounced as
"just sops to quiet people down" by a member of the Palo Alto
Tenants Union (PATU) Friday night.
"A horrendous social peace is being bought, charged Jul Josepn,
who participated in a KZSU panel discussion on "The Housing Crisis.
Other members of the panel included Robert Rosenzweig, associate
provost; Louis Goldsmith, president of the Palo Alto Housing
Corporation; Don Lee and Sharon Winslow, student members of
PATU; and Paul Reimer, planner and engineer. Because the PATU is
sueing the Palo Alto City Council, no council members were present.
"The buck has been passed among the federal government, city
government, and Stanford University," Mrs. Joseph asserted.

keep people quiet. More money can be found," she added.
