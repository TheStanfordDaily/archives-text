# Urban Studies Program Focuses On City Problems
## 
### DON LINDEMANN 
In an attempt to deal with the
growing problems of poverty,
pollution, and overcrowding in
urban areas, the Student Center
for Innovation and Research in
Education has initiated an Urban
Studies Program which will aid
students interested in designing
their own interdepartmental
major, and act as a first step in
dealing effectively with the urban
condition.
The formal organization of the
program consists of an advisory
board composed chiefly of faculty
and administrators, a policy board
composed of students, a director,
3 permanent working committees
on library development, long term
feasibility and planning, and
program evaluation and planning,
as well as other special and
temporary committees created
upon need.
The pro gi a iVi, directed by
senior Henry Van Der Voort, is
designed to apply the methods
and perspectives of several
disciplines to urban problems. A
number of the teachers are
professionals from outside the
University, recruited because of
their interdisciplinary
background.
Three categories of courses are
offered: foundation courses,
seminars on topics of current
interest and various forms of field
work.
According to Roy Childs,
policy board member, "The
program does not offer a major in
Urban Studies. Its 1970/71
curriculum is designed to facilitate
the efforts of any undergraduate
student who desires to design his
own major centered around urban
studies by providing him with a
core of courses in the field which
he would probably need. The
director of the program, however,
will be available to advise students
interested in an Urban Studies
major, and will aid them in
working through the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences in order
to apply for it."
Curriculum counseling and
information on graduate schools is
also available, according to Van
Der Voort. The program is
developing a small library with
books and articles in the field,
bibliographies covering specific
topics and evaluations of similar
programs at other universities.

"We need help from students
in designing and organizing the
curriculum," said Van Der Voort.
The three foundation courses
will be taught by lecture, with
supplemental discussion sessions.
"Urban Social Structures," the
introductory course, examines
community organization,
voluntary associations, status
differentiation and lower class
social organization, urban politics
and urban ecology. It is taught by
Roy Childs.
"Urban Legal Structures" and
"Urban Poverty and Social
Policy" are the other basic
courses, offered in Winter and
Spring quarters respectively.
The program on Urban Studies
is an outgrowth of a student
effort organized in 1968, said Van
Der Voort. Originally, the group
worked toward an Institute for
Metropolitan Studies, offering
undergraduate and graduate
courses and engaging in social
action programs.
"We changed our purpose a
couple of times and decided to
emphasize undergraduate
education," said Van Der Voort.
As the program took form,
environmental studies (biology
and medicine) were
de-emphasized in favor of urban
studies (applied social sciences).
This shift was made possible by
creation of the Program in Human
Biology.

"I think about 80 universities
offer urban studies programs, but
they vary widely in quality," said
Van Der Voort. "We contacted a
lot of these schools and asked for
suggestions, and looked at their
mistakes and tried to avoid them.
I believe our program is unique in
being student-directed."
Van Der Voort, majoring in
psychology, has taken a leave of
absence this quarter to spend full
time as Director. One of his major
problems is finding funds.
Administrative expenses of the
Program are being paid by the
University. Support is being
sought from various University
organizations and private and
corporate donors. According to
Van Der Voort, the program will
be "guaranteed" through the
recently established Endowment
for Innovation, administered by
the University Fellows.
The Fall quarter seminars on
specific current topics are
"Suicide: Community Context
and Suicide Prevention" and
"Poverty and Law." Other
seminars will be offered Winter
quarter.
Field work courses now
offered include: "Field Methods
in Community Development,"
"The Alienated Student: A Case
Study," and "Internship in
Municipal Government."

ext. 3 451 or 345 2.

books and articles in the field,
bibliographies covering specific
topics and evaluations of similar
programs at other universities.

"We need help from students
in designing and organizing the
curriculum," said Van Der Voort.
The three foundation courses
will be taught by lecture, with
supplemental discussion sessions.
"Urban Social Structures," the
introductory course, examines
community organization,
voluntary associations, status
differentiation and lower class
social organization, urban politics
and urban ecology. It is taught by
Roy Childs.
"Urban Legal Structures" and
"Urban Poverty and Social
Policy" are the other basic
courses, offered in Winter and
Spring quarters respectively.
The program on Urban Studies
is an outgrowth of a student
effort organized in 1968, said Van
Der Voort. Originally, the group
worked toward an Institute for
Metropolitan Studies, offering
undergraduate and graduate
courses and engaging in social
action programs.
"We changed our purpose a
couple of times and decided to
emphasize undergraduate
education," said Van Der Voort.
As the program took form,
environmental studies (biology
and medicine) were
de-emphasized in favor of urban
studies (applied social sciences).
This shift was made possible by
creation of the Program in Human
Biology.

"I think about 80 universities
offer urban studies programs, but
they vary widely in quality," said
Van Der Voort. "We contacted a
lot of these schools and asked for
suggestions, and looked at their
mistakes and tried to avoid them.
I believe our program is unique in
being student-directed."
Van Der Voort, majoring in
psychology, has taken a leave of
absence this quarter to spend full
time as Director. One of his major
problems is finding funds.
Administrative expenses of the
Program are being paid by the
University. Support is being
sought from various University
organizations and private and
corporate donors. According to
Van Der Voort, the program will
be "guaranteed" through the
recently established Endowment
for Innovation, administered by
the University Fellows.
The Fall quarter seminars on
specific current topics are
"Suicide: Community Context
and Suicide Prevention" and
"Poverty and Law." Other
seminars will be offered Winter
quarter.
Field work courses now
offered include: "Field Methods
in Community Development,"
"The Alienated Student: A Case
Study," and "Internship in
Municipal Government."

In an attempt to deal with the
growing problems of poverty,
pollution, and overcrowding in
urban areas, the Student Center
for Innovation and Research in
Education has initiated an Urban
Studies Program which will aid
students interested in designing
their own interdepartmental
major, and act as a first step in
dealing effectively with the urban
condition.
The formal organization of the
program consists of an advisory
board composed chiefly of faculty
and administrators, a policy board
composed of students, a director,
3 permanent working committees
on library development, long term
feasibility and planning, and
program evaluation and planning,
as well as other special and
temporary committees created
upon need.
The pro gi a iVi, directed by
senior Henry Van Der Voort, is
designed to apply the methods
and perspectives of several
disciplines to urban problems. A
number of the teachers are
professionals from outside the
University, recruited because of
their interdisciplinary
background.
Three categories of courses are
offered: foundation courses,
seminars on topics of current
interest and various forms of field
work.
According to Roy Childs,
policy board member, "The
program does not offer a major in
Urban Studies. Its 1970/71
curriculum is designed to facilitate
the efforts of any undergraduate
student who desires to design his
own major centered around urban
studies by providing him with a
core of courses in the field which
he would probably need. The
director of the program, however,
will be available to advise students
interested in an Urban Studies
major, and will aid them in
working through the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences in order
to apply for it."
Curriculum counseling and
information on graduate schools is
also available, according to Van
Der Voort. The program is
developing a small library with
books and articles in the field,
bibliographies covering specific
topics and evaluations of similar
programs at other universities.
