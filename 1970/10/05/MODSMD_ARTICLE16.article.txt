# Sly To Kick Off 'Big-Time' Shows
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
"Big time campuses should have big time entertainment." The
speaker is Council of Presidents member Adam Levin who along
with the ASSU Special Events Board is sponsoring Sly and the
Family Stone in concert this Friday evening in Frost amphitheater.
The concert is the first in a series of two or three planned by the
Special Events Board for this quarter. The Moody Blues have been
scheduled for Maples Pavilion Dec. 3 in their only Northern
California appearance while Ike and Tina Turner and Richie Havens
are being considered for a possible third concert.
Levin claims that the purpose of concerts such as the Sly one fill
the "crying need for big name entertainment at Stanford." This
need, says Levin, was dramatically displayed in last Spring's 77%
student approval of a measure to charge each student one dollar per
quarter to bring entertainment onto the campus.
Although seats to the Sly concert cost $3.75 and $5 for
non-students, Levin maintains that it's strictly a break-even concert.
"We aren't attempting to rip money off of anyone," he said citing as
evidence the Sly concert in Oakland where most seats cost $6.50 and
$5.5 0
Levin also notes that a considerable sum has been spent on special
lighting effects, refurbishing of the fences, and security measures,
such as improved lighting in the parking lots.
Sly is costing the ASSU $17,5 00 plus 60% of any ticket sales gross
beyond $29,000.
Performing with Sly will be a group named Carp. Their first
album, described as "Country and Western Gospel" music, is to be
released sometime this week by Epic records.
Sly has also had the reputation of being an undependable
performer, especially after a Chicago concert where his failure to
appear on schedule make it look as if the Democrats were holding
another convention. Although the contract with Sly was signed the
day of the Chicago incident, Levin maintains that Sly was wrongly
blamed and that, in any event, the ASSU has a performance bond
with the group guaranteeing that they will appear.
The only area in which Levin sees the possibility of trouble for
the concert is from people typing to crash the fences.
"This concert is an experiment," says Levin," which if it succeeds
will pave the way for other big name entertainment at Stanford."
The Special Events Board has already planned three concerts for
Winter quarter and seven for Spring quarter. Some of these may be
free.
"Yet if the concert is marred by violence," warns Levin, "the
experiment will go down the drain and the hopes of a lot of people
with it."
The Free You newspaper has hinted that some people might try
to turn the Sly appearance into a "free concert" rather than pay the
ticket prices which the paper feels are exorbitant.
Last week the Daily ran a picture of the group and described Sly
as "rock music's foremost vanishing act" arrd "the group that tore
up Chicago." These comments prompted the Black Student Union
to criticize the Daily for attempting to "willfully jeopardize the
success of the Sly Stone concert." The BSU viewed the Daily's
remarks as "but another of the many racist slights that they (they
black students) must endure."
