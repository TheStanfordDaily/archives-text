# Lyman Cites Threats To Political System
## 
### JESSE CEDERBAUM 
Attacks from the New Left,
Old Right and all those who
believe politics is "dirty" may be
"very seriously affecting"
America's potential for
constructive and lasting political
change, President Lyman warned
Sunday.
"The most frightening aspect
of the New Left... is the
reminder it has in it of the Fascist
revolutions in Europe in the
1920'5" Lyman said yesterday in
his keynote address to the
opening meeting of SCIP (Student
Committee for Involvement in
Politics).
The only difference, he noted,
is the absence of anti-Semitic and
vehement nationalist rhetoric,
prominent in the rise of Hitler and
Mussolini, in the arsenal of the
young American radicals.
Lyman termed the radicals'
arguments that the system is
failing "circular" because the
radicals themselves refuse to try
However, he warned the gathering
of about 5 0 persons in the
Tresidder large lounge, the system
may indeed be failing "because
there are as many empty chairs in

this room as there are."
Calling the SCIP program a
"valuable part of learning for life,
the President said its organizers
had "hit upon a successful way"
of encouraging faculty, staff, and
students to "get involved in
politics with the preservation of
the freedom" which the university
requires.
Aside from the New Left,
Lyman cited two other viewpoints
from which politics in this
country are under attack.
The first he termed the
traditional American distaste for
the "dirty dealings" of politicians.
The only counter to this kind of
attack is to acknowledge a certain
amount of compromise and
ambiguity are necessary to a
functioning political system, and
to realize that things are not likely
to get better if people are "afraid
of getting their feet wet."
The other staging ground for
attack, Lyman said, is the "Old
Right" position which fails to
recognize the distinction between
personal and institutional political
involvement. He branded this as
"confusion in the minds of the
confused."
