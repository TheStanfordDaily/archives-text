# Viet Ba'hai Head Here
## Seeks Religious Solution 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
His grandfather was killed by
the communists, his religious
schools were destroyed by the
Americans, but Le Loc, the
chairman of the National Spiritual
Assembly of the Bahai's of
Vietnam, brought love and
understanding to the United
States in his quest for world
peace.
Le Loc, who asserts that all
attempts at both military and
political solutions to the Vietnam
war have been exhausted, is
struggling for a religious
solutionâ€”one that may take 30
years to accomplish.
M Our prophet, Baha'u'llah,
who founded the Bahai religion in
1817, has told us that world peace
will be achieved before the end of
this millenium, and that it will last
for 5 00,000 years."
Unity Stressed
"The Bahai religion stresses the
unity of man and the unity of
religion," says the 3 4 year-old
chairman who recently spoke at
Stanford as part of a series of
speeches organized and financed
by the Bahai national
headquarters in Illinois.
"We stress also the origin of
man from one god. God is the
creator of the universe, and the
only way to understand him is
through his messengers." Christ,
Krhishna, Mohammed, and
Buddha are among those who
comprise God's messengers in the
Bahai religion. Bahai strives for
the unifications of these religions
to solve the world's problems.
Le Loc attributes the
prolonged war in Vietnam to
ignorance and misguided love.
"The United States is sending
arms and bombing my country in

an effort to stop communism so
that the Vietnamese can enjoy
independence and freedom. This
is misguided love."
Political Solutions Fail
Efforts to achieve a political
solution to the war are equally as
fruitless as the misguided military
ones, according to Le Loc, who

maintains that proposals for a
coalition government and free
elections "can't be accepted as
good suggestions for peace
because the Communists don't
believe the Americans and the
Americans don't believe the
Communists."
Instead, Le Loc and Bahai,
which claims a membership of
10 0,000 South Vietnamese,
advocate love, unity, and wisdom
as a means of conflict resolution.
"We invite all religions to come
together. The majority of the
people in the world claim to have
religions, but they have no unity
among themselves."

Le Loc, who lives with his wife
and two daughters in Saigon, said
his main purpose in coming to the
United States was "to contribute
to the progress of the Bahai
movement in America." He
estimated American membership
at approximately 4 0,000.
Formerly a Buddhist, Le Loc
adopted the Bahai religion ten

years ago because Buddha, unlike
his new faith, "didn't have a plan
to organize the earth. The Bahai
religion makes my life more
meaningful," he said.
Religious End to War
When asked about the success
of Bahai in Vietnam, Le Loc
admitted to the difficulty of
convincing the South Vietnamese
political leaders to strive for a
religious solution to the war, but
also stressed that he was "more
interested in changing the hearts
of the people." He noted that the
size of the religion in Vietnam has
doubled in a year.
Le Loc also cited India and

Iran as two nations that have over
500,000 Bahai adherents. "At
present," he concluded, "the
people of the world do not have
the maturity to choose their own
leaders. It is hoped that Bahai will
give them this maturity by
teaching them love, unity, and
wisdom."
If in fact, this maturity can be
conveyed to his country's political
leaders, Bahai and politics might
soon go together like Loc and Ky.
(Well?)
