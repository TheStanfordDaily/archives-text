# $3000 In 1974
## Tuition Spiral To Continue 
### EMMA PRICE 
The high cost of attending Stanford
is expected to rise so rapidly that
tuition alone will amount to almost
$3000 a year within the next three
years.
Tuition has increased every year
since 1967, when it was $1575. This
year it stands at $2400. An increase to
$2610 has been announced for next
year. The Controller's Office estimates
that tuition will be $2710 in 1973 and
$2940 in 1974.
University's spokesmen are eager to
point out that the current tuition of
$2400 compares favorably with certain
Eastern institutions: MIT, $26 40;
Harvard, $ 2 6 0 0; Yale, $ 2550;
Princeton, $2500. Yearly increases are
expected at all of these institutions.
Room and board charges at some of
these universities are also more than at
Stanford.
Room and board here will also rise
steadily in the future. From 196 6 to
1970, the rate stood at $1140. This
fall, it was raised to $1 210. No definite
decision on the size of next year's
increase have been made yet. But the
Controller's Office estimates that these
charges will be increased at the rate of
approximately eight percent yearly.
The basic reason for these increases
in tuition, room and is a simple one:
the University is in debt. The deficit in
the operating budget for the last
academic year was $1,486,000. In
1968-69, the first year in which there
was a deficit, the University suffered a
$2 ,1 6 1,0 0 0 loss. The University
attributes the decline in its yearly
deficit to two factors: increased tuition
and an extensive cost-cutting campaign
(BAP — the Budget Adjustment
Program).
The effects of tuition and room and
board increases on the student body are
hard to gauge, particularly since the
Admissions Office and the Financial
Aids Office both report a dearth of
hard data.
More Aid
Robert Huff, director of the
Financial Aids Office, reports that his
office has been able to increase all
previously-awarded financial aid
packages to cover higher tuition costs,
although this often involves switching
from outright grants to loans or
work-study grants.
Huff emphasizes that fears of
middle-income students being squeezed
out of Stanford are not supported by
facts. The University, he said, remains a
basically middle- and upper-income
institution.
The increasing tuition is, however,

having a definite effect on an increasing
segment of the student body. The
number of applicants requesting
financial aid information, for example,
has increased from 4,461 to 5,314 over
the past year. Similarly, this year 39.5
per cent of the undergraduate student
body is receiving aid totaling about
$5.5 million. In 1960 , only 26.7 per
cent received such aid.
Median Income
The median family income of
students applying for scholarship aid
has also risen. This year it is
approximately $1 4,000. Huff estimates
that less than 10 percent of the student
body comes from families with incomes
of less than $8000 a year.
Fred Hargadon, the Dean of
Admissions, maintains that the effects
of tuition, room and board increases
are unclear.
Hargadon believes that there are
several points that make it difficult to
analyze the effects of tuition increases.
One point he makes is that the income
level in this country has been rising
along with tuit'on costs. Another point
he emphasizes is that a large percentage
of the increasing University budget has
been earmarked for wages, which, in
turn, raises the income level in the
surrounding communities, thus

enabling more people to attend
Stanford without scholarship aid.
The increasing tuition and general
financial condition of the University
will make it impossible to increase the
number of minority ethnic group
students receiving financial aid over the
next few years, according to
Hargadon. This year's freshman class
is approximately five per cent black,
five per cent Chicano, and two per cent
American Indian.
He emphasizes that recruiting efforts
aimed at these groups and poor white
students have been expanded over the
past few years. For example, this year
recruiters went to public schools on the
East Coast for the first time.
Hargadon has several imaginative
ideas about the possibilities for
University financing. He pointed out
that all students are partially
subsidized, since tuition covers less
than 4 0 percent of the University's
educational costs. He suggests a system
whereby all students who could afford
to pay the full cost of their education
be required to do so. This would
provide enough money so that very
generous scholarships could be given to
those who need them. This system, he
added, cannot be adopted unless other
private universities are willing to go
along with it.

expected at all of these institutions.
Room and board charges at some of
these universities are also more than at
Stanford.
Room and board here will also rise
steadily in the future. From 196 6 to
1970, the rate stood at $1140. This
fall, it was raised to $1 210. No definite
decision on the size of next year's
increase have been made yet. But the
Controller's Office estimates that these
charges will be increased at the rate of
approximately eight percent yearly.
The basic reason for these increases
in tuition, room and is a simple one:
the University is in debt. The deficit in
the operating budget for the last
academic year was $1,486,000. In
1968-69, the first year in which there
was a deficit, the University suffered a
$2 ,1 6 1,0 0 0 loss. The University
attributes the decline in its yearly
deficit to two factors: increased tuition
and an extensive cost-cutting campaign
(BAP — the Budget Adjustment
Program).
The effects of tuition and room and
board increases on the student body are
hard to gauge, particularly since the
Admissions Office and the Financial
Aids Office both report a dearth of
hard data.
More Aid
Robert Huff, director of the
Financial Aids Office, reports that his
office has been able to increase all
previously-awarded financial aid
packages to cover higher tuition costs,
although this often involves switching
from outright grants to loans or
work-study grants.
Huff emphasizes that fears of
middle-income students being squeezed
out of Stanford are not supported by
facts. The University, he said, remains a
basically middle- and upper-income
institution.
The increasing tuition is, however,

having a definite effect on an increasing
segment of the student body. The
number of applicants requesting
financial aid information, for example,
has increased from 4,461 to 5,314 over
the past year. Similarly, this year 39.5
per cent of the undergraduate student
body is receiving aid totaling about
$5.5 million. In 1960 , only 26.7 per
cent received such aid.
Median Income
The median family income of
students applying for scholarship aid
has also risen. This year it is
approximately $1 4,000. Huff estimates
that less than 10 percent of the student
body comes from families with incomes
of less than $8000 a year.
Fred Hargadon, the Dean of
Admissions, maintains that the effects
of tuition, room and board increases
are unclear.
Hargadon believes that there are
several points that make it difficult to
analyze the effects of tuition increases.
One point he makes is that the income
level in this country has been rising
along with tuit'on costs. Another point
he emphasizes is that a large percentage
of the increasing University budget has
been earmarked for wages, which, in
turn, raises the income level in the
surrounding communities, thus

enabling more people to attend
Stanford without scholarship aid.
The increasing tuition and general
financial condition of the University
will make it impossible to increase the
number of minority ethnic group
students receiving financial aid over the
next few years, according to
Hargadon. This year's freshman class
is approximately five per cent black,
five per cent Chicano, and two per cent
American Indian.
He emphasizes that recruiting efforts
aimed at these groups and poor white
students have been expanded over the
past few years. For example, this year
recruiters went to public schools on the
East Coast for the first time.
Hargadon has several imaginative
ideas about the possibilities for
University financing. He pointed out
that all students are partially
subsidized, since tuition covers less
than 4 0 percent of the University's
educational costs. He suggests a system
whereby all students who could afford
to pay the full cost of their education
be required to do so. This would
provide enough money so that very
generous scholarships could be given to
those who need them. This system, he
added, cannot be adopted unless other
private universities are willing to go
along with it.

DEAN OF'' ADMISSIONS—Fred Hargadon commented on the increasing costs
of tuition, room and hoard and its effect on t.h«* student body.
The high cost of attending Stanford
is expected to rise so rapidly that
tuition alone will amount to almost
$3000 a year within the next three
years.
Tuition has increased every year
since 1967, when it was $1575. This
year it stands at $2400. An increase to
$2610 has been announced for next
year. The Controller's Office estimates
that tuition will be $2710 in 1973 and
$2940 in 1974.
University's spokesmen are eager to
point out that the current tuition of
$2400 compares favorably with certain
Eastern institutions: MIT, $26 40;
Harvard, $ 2 6 0 0; Yale, $ 2550;

was a deficit, the University suffered a
$2 ,1 6 1,0 0 0 loss. The University
attributes the decline in its yearly
deficit to two factors: increased tuition
and an extensive cost-cutting campaign
(BAP — the Budget Adjustment
Program).
The effects of tuition and room and
board increases on the student body are
hard to gauge, particularly since the
Admissions Office and the Financial
Aids Office both report a dearth of
hard data.
More Aid
Robert Huff, director of the
Financial Aids Office, reports that his
office has been able to increase all
previously-awarded financial aid
packages to cover higher tuition costs,
although this often involves switching
from outright grants to loans or
work-study grants.
Huff emphasizes that fears of
middle-income students being squeezed
out of Stanford are not supported by
facts. The University, he said, remains a
basically middle- and upper-income
institution.
The increasing tuition is, however,

having a definite effect on an increasing
segment of the student body. The
number of applicants requesting
financial aid information, for example,
has increased from 4,461 to 5,314 over
the past year. Similarly, this year 39.5
per cent of the undergraduate student
body is receiving aid totaling about
$5.5 million. In 1960 , only 26.7 per
cent received such aid.
Median Income
The median family income of
students applying for scholarship aid
has also risen. This year it is
approximately $1 4,000. Huff estimates
that less than 10 percent of the student
body comes from families with incomes
of less than $8000 a year.
Fred Hargadon, the Dean of
Admissions, maintains that the effects
of tuition, room and board increases
are unclear.
Hargadon believes that there are
several points that make it difficult to
analyze the effects of tuition increases.
One point he makes is that the income
level in this country has been rising
along with tuit'on costs. Another point
he emphasizes is that a large percentage
of the increasing University budget has
been earmarked for wages, which, in
turn, raises the income level in the
surrounding communities, thus

enabling more people to attend
Stanford without scholarship aid.
The increasing tuition and general
financial condition of the University
will make it impossible to increase the
number of minority ethnic group
students receiving financial aid over the
next few years, according to
Hargadon. This year's freshman class
is approximately five per cent black,
five per cent Chicano, and two per cent
American Indian.
He emphasizes that recruiting efforts
aimed at these groups and poor white
students have been expanded over the
past few years. For example, this year
recruiters went to public schools on the
East Coast for the first time.
Hargadon has several imaginative
ideas about the possibilities for
University financing. He pointed out
that all students are partially
subsidized, since tuition covers less
than 4 0 percent of the University's
educational costs. He suggests a system
whereby all students who could afford
to pay the full cost of their education
be required to do so. This would
provide enough money so that very
generous scholarships could be given to
those who need them. This system, he
added, cannot be adopted unless other
private universities are willing to go
along with it.

DEAN OF'' ADMISSIONS—Fred Hargadon commented on the increasing costs
of tuition, room and hoard and its effect on t.h«* student body.
The high cost of attending Stanford
is expected to rise so rapidly that
tuition alone will amount to almost
$3000 a year within the next three
years.
Tuition has increased every year
since 1967, when it was $1575. This
year it stands at $2400. An increase to
$2610 has been announced for next
year. The Controller's Office estimates
that tuition will be $2710 in 1973 and
$2940 in 1974.
University's spokesmen are eager to
point out that the current tuition of
$2400 compares favorably with certain
Eastern institutions: MIT, $26 40;
Harvard, $ 2 6 0 0; Yale, $ 2550;
Princeton, $2500. Yearly increases are
expected at all of these institutions.
Room and board charges at some of
these universities are also more than at
Stanford.
Room and board here will also rise
steadily in the future. From 196 6 to
1970, the rate stood at $1140. This
fall, it was raised to $1 210. No definite
decision on the size of next year's
increase have been made yet. But the
Controller's Office estimates that these
charges will be increased at the rate of
approximately eight percent yearly.
The basic reason for these increases
in tuition, room and is a simple one:
the University is in debt. The deficit in
the operating budget for the last
academic year was $1,486,000. In
1968-69, the first year in which there
was a deficit, the University suffered a
$2 ,1 6 1,0 0 0 loss. The University
