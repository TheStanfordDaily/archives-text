# Why Are These Girls Smiling?
## 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
The pom-pon girls spend
countless hours every week
creating, practicing, and
memorizing new routines. They
work twice a day with the band,
practice at least once daily on
their own. They design their own
costumes and are responsible for
getting them put together, and
then must plead with the ASSU
Senate for the money to pay
for them.
On Saturday afternoons, they
meet the band at 12:30 to march
over to the stadium. Once there,
they only spend about forty-five
minutes actually on the field,
running back and forth, smiling,
waving their pom-pons, dancing to

the music of the band for the
gratification of the screaming
masses. For the rest of the time
until the end of the game, they
stand at the edge of the field in
their little red dresses, white
gloves, and Indian feathers and are
for the most part unnoticed.
Why do they do all this? It's
hard to tell.
That the pom-pon girls are sex
objects is difficult to deny. The
fact that they are pretty,
well-built girls out on the field is
certainly more significant than the
fact that they also happen to be
dancing, and any woman who has
thought twice about liberation
will realize that a big kiss from the
drum major for being a "goddess"

at the Arkansas game is not a
mark of respect or equality.
However, the other
assumptions which are commonly
made concerning pom-pon girls do
not, at least in the case of this
year's group, appear to be true.
Although they are not necessarily
deeply involved in social and
political issues, (In the words of
Susan Taylor, "I've got the whole
rest of my life to be serious.")
they are not simpering nitwits by
any means, long-held prejudices
notwithstanding.
Not Noodle-Brained
Susan, who is a junior, has
almost completed an
interdepartmental major in
psychology, linguistics, and
speech therapy. Reni Maharam is
in practice a sophomore, but
creditwise she is a junior, having
entered Stanford with an
entire year'sworth of credit due to
Advanced Placement and other
special programs, and now she is
almost through her English major.
The others are similarly
academically advanced.
Another long-held notion is
that the pom-pon girls are all
girlfriends of the football players.
The two groups had no contact
whatsoever with each other until
after the Arkansas game, and
although the relationship between
them is friendly, it is not intimate.
In the words of Jeanette Jones,
"We do have an involvement with
the team, because we have a
common purpose. We both want
to do well."
The question remains—do well
at what?
Two possibilities suggest
themselves. To the more cynical,

the obvious response would be
that pom-pon girls are out for the
gigantic ego gratification of
jumping around in front of
87,00 0 keyed up football fans. An
idealist would be more inclined to
advance the view that these
dedicated girls are acting in the
interest of team spirit and good
sportsmanship. The actuality
seems to be a compound of ego
trip and altruism which is not
readily defined.
In on-the-field interviews last
Saturday, all five of the pom-pon
girls took the middle path
between two extremes. None of
them attempted any assertion that
they were serving particularly
noble ends, and only one of them
even mentioned the notion of
showmanship and performance,
which was Jeanette Jones' mild
comment that "There's a lot of
satisfaction in knowing that after
the work is over, you've really put
on your show."
The Big Three
Instead, every single one of the
five gave essentially the same
reasons for their pursuit of their
grandstand careers—love of
football, dancing, and the
Stanford marching band.
As Susie Peterson said, "I've
been going to football games all
my life, and every time I've seen
the pom-pon girls, I've felt like
dancing with them. I just wanted
to express my joy and enthusiasm.
And the band is fantastic. It's fun
to make up routines to the kinds
of songs they play."
"Whenever you dance with the
band, you're showing the people
joy, and expressing your own
feelings. You get out of yourself,

expressing yourself, and feeling
and hearing the response."
Mary Hernandez stressed the
more personal aspects of working
with the band. "They're so
friendly and nice, and don't make
you feel uncomfortable. It's easy
to feel lonely at a big university,
but once you meet them, they
won't forget you."
Even the pom-pon smile is not
what it may seem. Jeanette feels
that there's no put-on in her
smile—"l'm just so happy to be
there that I want to express that
happiness." Reni Maharam feels

the same way about defending her
grin." Some people may think my
smile looks fake, but I feel it's
natural. You express what you
feel in your face, and there's no
way out of it."
In the course of a pom-pon
girl's Saturday, all that natural
ebullience is forced to be very
much in evidence, all day long.
From the minute the band strikes
up at the practice field, the smile
is there, as the parade moves past
cheering tail-gate picnickers in the
parking lot to sweep noisily past

the guards at the entrance gate.
Once on the field, they go
through the steps of the big
Pre-Game Entertainment. All the
grandeur is generously displayed
before the opposing team's side of
the grandstands, even though the
band and even the pom pon girls
themselves have been cheering
"Screw Purdue" all the way over
to the stadium.
It must be pointed out that the
well-rehearsed and cheerful act of
the pom-pon girls is far superior
to the yell leaders performance,
which thus far in the season has
been clumsy and ineffectual.
After all, which is more pleasant,
a fast-moving dance to the tune of
"Respect" or a futile attempt at
"Spit on the ceiling, spit on the
wall, come on Stanford, move
that ball"?
As the game drags on through
the second half, the pom-pon girls
anticipate with much unhappiness
what is sure to be the Stanford
team's dismal fate. It's definitely
not as much fun to be rooting
when your team's losing. Yet Reni
Maharam showed a reasonable
equanimity about the whole
thing.
"It's important to win every
game, but I guess it's not the end
of the world if you lose one."
