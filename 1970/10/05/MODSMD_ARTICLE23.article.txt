# A 						Startling Letdown

### FRED LEESON 
The 26-14 Purdue fiasco had
ended just minutes before and
John Ralston was accepting the
blame.
"Anytime you're not mentally
prepared to play football it's my
fault," he told his players in the
wooden meeting room at the end
of the stadium's running track.
"We underestimated their
team's ability completely."
Kids pounded on the locked
door and some had climbed up to
scream through the windows.
The inside resembled an
old-fashioned school room with
silent players sitting in rows,
looking straight ahead.
"You give credit to those who
beat you," Ralston said. "They
beat us every way they could.
"Nobody'll remember Purdue
if we go out and beat USC next
week. I let you down this time in

the preparation. I won't let you
down again. Mentally we lost this
game. Keep your confidence."
Whatever the mental situation,
Stanford played its most dismal
first half in recent memory.
Jim Plunkett's five
interceptions were the most for
one game in his college years,
exceeding the four he tossed to
Washington State as a sophomore.
Of his first four passes, two were
intercepted, and one was
completed for minus two yards.
Jim Kauffman nabbed a short
field goal attempt on the one and
ran ten yards backward for a
safety.
Then Jack Lasater kicked a 17
yard punt, and later Stanford
finally got within field goal range
for Steve Horowitz but the ball
never made it to the tee.
And when Plunkett threw his
third interception running room

was abundant. "1 didn't realize 1
was wide open," he said.
The offensive line, which had
let Jim get dumped only once all
season—and that on a broken
play—saw him get dropped five
times Saturday.
"The offensive line feels we
really let the team down," said
center John Sande. "We just
weren't with it. We made the
mistake of not taking it as
seriously as we should have. We'll
come back."
"They did all right," Plunkett
said of the same line. "Heck, I've
been around." He got nailed a
couple times late in the game
when he had already thrown all
his interceptions. "I wasn't going
to throw the ball in the air again.
They (Purdue) contributed to the
bad day a lot."
Kauffman said he usually plays
near the defensive line of field
goal attempts. Saturday he was
waved back to cover in case the
kick was short. It was.
"I guess I should have known
where I was," he said. "I didn't
really pre-organize my thoughts
on what to do if the ball was
short. I played it stupid."
"I shouldn't have done what I
done," he finished with the
Lardneresque ring.
The second half wasn't quite so

bad. Stanford out-scored Purdue
14-10, if that means anything. "I
think we got our respect back in
the second half," Ralston said,
but key errors still hurt.
Plunkett scored himself after a
75 yard drive during which he
completed five passes in a row,
one of them to Bob Moore for 15
yards which was nearly
intercepted.
"The guy was playing inside
me," Moore said. "I think he could
have gotten it if he were watching
the ball instead of me."
But with the score 16-7, an
interception left Purdue with the
ball on the Stanford 14 and two
plays later comback hopes were
gone.
A swing pass carried 4 4 yards
by Jackie Brown gave the 11,000
students the last of their few
cheers.
"Let's draw a line right here,"
Ralston told the players. "This
may be good for us. I'm an
optimist. You can still take and
make this the best season ever.
You guys forget this game."
R isn't likely the loss will be
forgotten, particularly the inept
first half. But depression among
players seemed neither severe nor
lasting, and feeling appeared to be
unanimous that the Tribe will be
back.


BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS-Jim Plunkett (16 ), above, squirms
his way into the endzone from the one for Stanford's first score early
in the second half against Purdue. The comeback from al6 -0 halftime
deficit fizzled, however, and Coach John Ralston and his players,
right, know it's all over for one Saturday anyway. Purdue's 26-14 win
assured the Indians an underdog role for next week's game with USC
in which a victory is almost essential for Stanford Rose Bowl hopes.
