# Stanford Not 'Up'
## Mental Edge Purdue Secret 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Football often has been
considered the ultimate physical
sport. Ideally, 2 2 men should
square off against each other in a
battle of strength, speed,
endurance and good ol' American
guts. Players spend years running
and exercising and weightlifting to
build the physiques needed for
this demanding team sport.
But despite the importance of
good physical shape, one cannot
overlook the importance of a
well-toned mind as well. How
many times has a coach talked
about getting "psyched" or "up"
for a game? How many times has
a physically superior team been
duped by a more mentally
prepared one?
Yes, football can sometimes be
a perfect picture of psychology in
action and seldom has there been
a better example of this
phenomenon than that witnessed
by 62,000 fans in Stanford
Stadium Saturday afternoon.
Stanford's best team in many
years, third-ranked nationally and
stocked with many potential
Ail-Americans was to face a
Purdue team, crippled by injuries.
Prior to the game, 11 Purdue
regulars had been sidelined at one
time or another. All American
Mike Phipps was long gone and
the only similarity shown by his
replacement was the spelling of
his name. Chuck Piebes.

These problems added to a
48-0 shellacking by Notre Dame a
week before had led to Stanford
being a 19 point favorite.
In the parking iots before the
game much of the conversation
was dominated by references to
next week's titanic with USC. It
seemed everyone had overlooked
Purdue. It turned out that the
Stanford football team had done
so as well.
The Boilermakers were eager to
revenge the humiliation by Notre
Dame and they came out fighting.
Led by yes, the infamous Mr.
Piebes, Purdue fought out to a
16-A first quarter lead. Piebes
scored on a 3 yard run, halfback

Stan Brown scored from nine
yards out and Stanford safety Jim
Kauffman accounted for a Purdue
safety when he retreated into the
end zone with a missed
Boilermaker field goal try.
After a scoreless second
quarter, Stanford finally got on
the board with 6:34 left in the
third quarter on a one yard
scoring run by Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett enjoyed little glory other
than that as he threw five
interceptions and completed 15 of
36 passes.
After Purdue scored again for a
23-7 lead, the Indians fumbled
away their final chance when
Plunkett lost the ball on the
second play of the final period.

The recovery was made by
defensive player of the game,
Randy Cooper, who also picked
off three Plunkett passes. After
the issue was decided, the Indians
came up with possibly their only
exciting play of the day, a 44 yard
touchdown swing pass to Jackie
Brown, who ran brilliantly on his
way to the score.
As a lot of shocked fans shook
their heads at the 26-14 final
score, some expressed a new
found optimism. If Purdue could
recover from a humiliating defeat
as well as they had, why can't
Stanford do it next week? As one
press box red hot said, "If
Stanford comes out as high as
Purdue did.lookout USC!"
