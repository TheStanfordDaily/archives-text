The kickoff of another Stanford football
game neared and almost all eyes were
focused on the field. As Stanford band
formed a block USA, the public address
announcer told a silent crowd that this and
all college football games Saturday were
being dedicated to the memory of 29 people
killed in the crash of a plane carrying half of
the Wichita State football team in

Georgetown, Colorado on Friday afternoon.
The band then played their usually
dramatic arrangement of the national
anthem in a fitting memorial to these tragic
victims of one of the worst disasters ever
involving an American collegiate team. The
Stanford Daily joins many in expressing its
sympathy to the family and friends of the
victims.
