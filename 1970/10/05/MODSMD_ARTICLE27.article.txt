Janis Joplin Dead
HOLLYWOOD — Janis Joplin, whose uninhibited,
screaming, wailing style made her a top pop singer, was
found dead Sunday night, police reported.
Police said drugs may have been involved, but there was
no immediate confirmation from coroner's investigators.
A friend found the 2 7-year-old singer's body in her
Hollywood hotel room, officers said.
"It didn't look like foul play," an ambulance attendant
said.
"It looked like she had just fallen over."
Miss Joplin became a star after appearing at the 19 67
Monterey International Pop Festival, where she sang "Ball
and Chain," a blues classic. She was appearing then with a
San Francisco rock group, Big Brother and the Holding
Company, which she later left.
Though white, she exploited a style and repertoire
usually associated with Negro blues singers.
She told an interviewer once of her style: "It's all
feeling. When I'm singing I'm not thinking."
She admitted to being a heavy bourbon drinker, often
drinking during performances. When asked whether her
all-out performances might cut her career short, she once
said, "Maybe I won't last as long as other singers, but I
think you can destroy your now by worrying about
tomorrow."
Among the songs for which she was best known are
"Maybe," "Work me, Lord," "Little Girl Blue," "One
Good Man," "Try," "Kosmic Blues," "I Need a Man to
Love," "Turtle Blues" and "Piece of My Heart."
Nixon Defends Fleet
LIMFRICK, Ireland — President Nixon spent Sunday
morning with his Vietnam peace envoys seeking ways to
break the deadlock in the Paris talks, then later turned his
attentions to the Middle East and the role of the U.S. 6 th
Fleet there as a force for peace.
The Middle East came up during a talk with newsmen at
an evening reception. He said the United States is prepared
to boost the 6 th Fleet's strength if its peacekeeping abilities
are threatened by other powers.
He did not mention the Soviet Union by name, although
it has been increasing its own naval power in the
Mediterranean since the 1 967 Arab-Israeli war.
"I am convinced that the 6th Fleet is able to meet its
mission of deterring irresponsible elements in the
Mediterranean area," Nixon said in discussing his visit to
the fleet during his nine-day tour.
He portrayed Jordan's civil war as the type of conflict in
the Middle East which, because of actions by "irresponsible
radical elements," might set in motion events leading to a
confrontation between the major powers.
This situation of possible danger may continue for some
time, the President added, and that is why there must be
military stability. He contended that the 6th Fleet
contributes to stability.

Prison Revolt
NEW YORK — Seventeen hostages held by inmates at the
Tombs prison in Manhattan were freed Sunday night,
Mayor John V. Lindsay's office reported.
The action by the prisoners left one jail in the city in
which guards still were held by inmates-three hostages in a
jail in Long Island City, Queens.
Those freed had been held by prison rebels on the 11 th
floor of the Tombs since Friday, the second day of the
current rash of jail takeovers that have affected five city
detention houses.
The hostages were released, the mayor's office said, at
11 :35 p.m., following an ultimatum aired by Lindsay. He
had given the prisoners until 10 p.m. to free their captives.
Lindsay had said that if the hostages weren't freed
"other courses of action must be taken."
Since Thursday, there have been inmate outbreaks at
five jails housing a total of 5,9 00 prisoners, although far
from all actually participated in the takeovers. Inmates are
demanding lower bail, speedier trials and better prison
conditions among other thintrs.
Prison guards using clubs and tear gas battled into
Brooklyn and Kew Gardens jails earlier in the day and
regained control of those institutions.
An attempted takeover of a fifth jail, on Rikers Island,
was begun and quelled in midafternoon.
Huey Newton, national leader of the Black Panther
Party, claimed his party had been named negotiator for the
rebels, but neither the inmates nor city officials confirmed
this.
Embargo Ignored
WASHINGTON — The United States sent $168 million
worth of military aid to Greece during the past three years
while publicly proclaiming a selective arms embargo against
that country's military rulers.
State and Defense Department officials, in secret Senate
testimony made public Sunday, insisted the ruling colonels
got no tanks or other heavy equipment handy for dealing
with anti-government mobs.
But they said the embargo was lifted once after the
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia when the colonels were
given $28 million in planes, artillery shells and coastal
minesweepers.
The officials said this exception was made to shore up
the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) in the wake of what appeared to be a
renewed Soviet menace to the alliance.
They conceded, however, that although it was a NATO
decision the United States took the action unilaterally and
didn't consult any of its NATO allies.
No breakdown was given in the heavily censored
transcript of just what kind of arms and other military
equipment comprised the $168 million in aid that
continued uninterrupted into Greece during the embargo.
