# 'Fail Responsibilities'
## Pitzer Hits Faculties 
### 
Writing in the current issue of
"Chemical and Engineering News,"
former president Kenneth S. Pitzer says
that university faculties have failed to
fulfill their broader responsibilities to
their "clients"â€”students, taxpayers and
donors -in recent years.
Pitzer, who is preparing a series of
lectures to be delivered this fall at
Indiana University, said that since
World War 11, "the great demand for
faculty in excess of the supply of fully
qualified candidates generated
conditions in which many individuals
failed to recognize their broader
professional responsibilities.
"Some faculty members thought it
sufficient if their performance was
competent as judged only by their
research publications; they forgot that
their work must also satisfy their
clients.

"And to the extent that faculties
participate in university governance,
their decisions must also be consistent
with responsibility to students, donors,
and taxpayers," the internationally
known chemist said.
Direct Obligations
Pitzer, who resigned June 2 5 after a
turbulent Spring Quarter, said that
being a professional gives a faculty
member wide discretion in his work,
the quality of which can be judged only
by his colleagues. But certain aspects of
his professional responsibility to clients
can be "readily judged by anyone," he
said.
"For example, the faculty member
must fulfill his direct obligations such
as meeting his classes faithfully and
covering the announced material as well
as advising his research students. In
addition, a professional person may be
expected, within reasonable limits, to
assist his university or his profession in
special assignments and to conduct
himself generally in a responsible
manner.
"A professor can lose the confidence
of others by irresponsible behavior
outside ihe classroom as well as within
it. And even within a classroom, a
teacher can be competent in his
subject, yet fail to serve his students
well," he said.
Client Confidence
"The Universities now suffer from a
lack of client confidence. Faculties
must either act to restore this
confidence by meeting more fully their
professional responsibility in these
broader aspects or see some of their
authority withdrawn.
"Governing boards represent the
university's clients and will directly, or
through administrative officers, take
actions, if necessary, to assure that the
university meets its responsibilities to
those it is intended to serve.
"I hope that faculties will act to
meet these broader responsibilities.
Among other reasons I recognize the

d. iger that academic freedom may be
indulged when faculty irresponsibility
is being dealt with, and 1 believe
faculties are less likely to make'that
mistake than others. Furthermore, a
stronger sense of faculty loyalty should
lead to improved teaching," he said.
Concluding his guest editorial, Pitzer
commended his fellow chemists, whom
he said "have recognized these
professional responsibilities more fully
than those in many other disciplines. I
hope that members of chemical
faculties will help their colleagues act
to restore confidence in our
universities, for otherwise both faculty
members and society generally will
suffer."
