# NLRB Hearing Slated Today
## 
### 
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) hearings into the campus labor
situation resume this morning in room
134 35 of the Federal Building in San
Francisco.
Today's hearing will probably bring
to a close the current discussion of
holding elections to establish several
outside labor unions on campus. The
NLRB is expected to rule in favor of
three unions, one for the policemen,
one for the firemen, and one for a large
group of employees from many
unrelated fields.
The Board is expected to deny a
Teamsters Union petition to represent
the Physical Plant on the grounds that
the Plant represents a "bargaining unit"
that is too small. The Teamsters have
nearly-unanimous support from the
Plant workers who would be eligible to
join the proposed local.
The Workers Action Caucus has
asked all employees interested in the
campus labor situation to attend
today's hearing in San Francisco. They
have also slated a meeting for noon
tomorrow in Tresidder Union.
