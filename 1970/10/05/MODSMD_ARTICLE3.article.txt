# Lyman May Quit In Ten Years; Calls For 'Forward Movement'
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
President Richard W. Lyman told
the Academic Council Friday that he
probably will serve no longer than ten
years as president.
Warning that a university president
need serve with "verve and energy", he
said: "Ideally a university president
should serve long enough to accomplish
something, and not long enough to
make people think of his
accomplishments wholly in the past
tense."

Named to the presidency Sept. 24,
this was Lyman's first address to the
group, which is composed of all faculty
with the rank of assistant professor and
above.
He emphasized his determination to
maintain contact "with all segments of
the community, and many of the
community outside."
To this end, Lyman hopes to eschew
trivial decision-making "not because
the President is too important a
personage for such indignities, but
because he absolutely requires time for
listening and talking outside the round
of committee meetings, staff meetings,
board meetings that will, if not
checked, clog his calendar and reduce
his accessibility."
Loss of Confidence
Early in the speech he said,
"Stanford is a great university. One of
the saddest losses suffered over the past
few years of tension, polarization, and
distress has been the loss of confidence

on the part all too many that we have
any right to so describe ourselves and
this institution.
"We certainly have our
shortcomings, and it is healthy to
recognize that fact. Institutional vanity
is scarcely more attractive than
personal vanity . ..
"(But) for all our faults, universities
in America today have more to offer to
a greater number of people than ever
before in their history. Indeed, it is
because they are so important that they
are being fought over. It is because they
arecount for something that people
care enough to attack us, or to attempt
to take us over."
Forward Motion
In the same vein, he later added, "In
all of this we have no time, it seems to
me, either for excess humility or for
arrogance. There is quite enough of
both today, though I venture to guess
arrogance is ahead on points.
"We must and we will, here at

Stanford, avoid any tendency to hunch
ourselves down in whatever shelters we
can find and wait for the storm to pass.
The university counts for something
because it has moved far and fast.
"It is going to go on moving, and we
are not going to be distracted by
destructive attacks from whatever
quarter. The best antidote to
disillusionment is still forward
movement."
Central Purpose
He cited universities for a failure
"sometimes to understand clearly, and
to articulate forcefully, the central
purposes for which they exist: learning
and teaching, at the highest levels of
which contemporary man is capable."
Lyman also attacked those who
advocate repressing students: "Frankly
I am weary of the absolutist
pronouncements from politicians and
others to whom such pronouncements
cost nothing, and who wouldn't think
of treating problems for which they
bore direct responsibility and about
which they were well informed, in such
a cavalier fashion."
Overall increased costs and the
additional expenses for security and
damage repair will cause further fiscal
belt-tightening, Lyman said. All this
comes despite a record year for
donations.
The drop in the stock market and
student activism have together caused
donations from living individuals to
drop even in this record year, he said.
Lyman termed this "an ominous sign of
the times."
"If we are to do justice to our
educational obligations and seize the
opportunities over the coming decade"
the University must raise $5 0 million a
year instead of the $30 million raised
this past year, he added.
He strongly praised those in the
administration and the schools who
have taken on extra responsibilities
because of vacant positions. He singled
out for praise Robert Freelen, the
acting Dean of Students, and John
Schwartz, new head of the campus
judicial system for the jobs they are
doing.
He said that part of Schwartz's job
to help reconstruct the campus judicial
system which has been "manifestly
inadequate." Most of the students
charged before the Stanford Judicial
Council in last spring's demonstrations
were acquitted or released because of
the difficulty of proving the charges.
Lyman told the Council that though
several other schemes were considered
he had decided that the cost of last
spring's demonstrations, including
damages and lost working time, be
added to the general costs of running
the University, rather than assessing
them to the students or the whole
community.

of committee meetings, staff meetings,
board meetings that will, if not
checked, clog his calendar and reduce
his accessibility."
Loss of Confidence
Early in the speech he said,
"Stanford is a great university. One of
the saddest losses suffered over the past
few years of tension, polarization, and
distress has been the loss of confidence

on the part all too many that we have
any right to so describe ourselves and
this institution.
"We certainly have our
shortcomings, and it is healthy to
recognize that fact. Institutional vanity
is scarcely more attractive than
personal vanity . ..
"(But) for all our faults, universities
in America today have more to offer to
a greater number of people than ever
before in their history. Indeed, it is
because they are so important that they
are being fought over. It is because they
arecount for something that people
care enough to attack us, or to attempt
to take us over."
Forward Motion
In the same vein, he later added, "In
all of this we have no time, it seems to
me, either for excess humility or for
arrogance. There is quite enough of
both today, though I venture to guess
arrogance is ahead on points.
"We must and we will, here at

Stanford, avoid any tendency to hunch
ourselves down in whatever shelters we
can find and wait for the storm to pass.
The university counts for something
because it has moved far and fast.
"It is going to go on moving, and we
are not going to be distracted by
destructive attacks from whatever
quarter. The best antidote to
disillusionment is still forward
movement."
Central Purpose
He cited universities for a failure
"sometimes to understand clearly, and
to articulate forcefully, the central
purposes for which they exist: learning
and teaching, at the highest levels of
which contemporary man is capable."
Lyman also attacked those who
advocate repressing students: "Frankly
I am weary of the absolutist
pronouncements from politicians and
others to whom such pronouncements
cost nothing, and who wouldn't think
of treating problems for which they
bore direct responsibility and about
which they were well informed, in such
a cavalier fashion."
Overall increased costs and the
additional expenses for security and
damage repair will cause further fiscal
belt-tightening, Lyman said. All this
comes despite a record year for
donations.
The drop in the stock market and
student activism have together caused
donations from living individuals to
drop even in this record year, he said.
Lyman termed this "an ominous sign of
the times."
"If we are to do justice to our
educational obligations and seize the
opportunities over the coming decade"
the University must raise $5 0 million a
year instead of the $30 million raised
this past year, he added.
He strongly praised those in the
administration and the schools who
have taken on extra responsibilities
because of vacant positions. He singled
out for praise Robert Freelen, the
acting Dean of Students, and John
Schwartz, new head of the campus
judicial system for the jobs they are
doing.
He said that part of Schwartz's job
to help reconstruct the campus judicial
system which has been "manifestly
inadequate." Most of the students
charged before the Stanford Judicial
Council in last spring's demonstrations
were acquitted or released because of
the difficulty of proving the charges.
Lyman told the Council that though
several other schemes were considered
he had decided that the cost of last
spring's demonstrations, including
damages and lost working time, be
added to the general costs of running
the University, rather than assessing
them to the students or the whole
community.
President Richard W. Lyman told
the Academic Council Friday that he
probably will serve no longer than ten
years as president.
Warning that a university president
need serve with "verve and energy", he
said: "Ideally a university president
should serve long enough to accomplish
something, and not long enough to
make people think of his
accomplishments wholly in the past
tense."

Named to the presidency Sept. 24,
this was Lyman's first address to the
group, which is composed of all faculty
with the rank of assistant professor and
above.
He emphasized his determination to
maintain contact "with all segments of
the community, and many of the
community outside."
To this end, Lyman hopes to eschew
trivial decision-making "not because
the President is too important a
personage for such indignities, but
because he absolutely requires time for
listening and talking outside the round
of committee meetings, staff meetings,
board meetings that will, if not
checked, clog his calendar and reduce
his accessibility."

Forward Motion
In the same vein, he later added, "In
all of this we have no time, it seems to
me, either for excess humility or for
arrogance. There is quite enough of
both today, though I venture to guess
arrogance is ahead on points.
"We must and we will, here at

Stanford, avoid any tendency to hunch
ourselves down in whatever shelters we
can find and wait for the storm to pass.
The university counts for something
because it has moved far and fast.
"It is going to go on moving, and we
are not going to be distracted by
destructive attacks from whatever
quarter. The best antidote to
disillusionment is still forward
movement."
Central Purpose
He cited universities for a failure
"sometimes to understand clearly, and
to articulate forcefully, the central
purposes for which they exist: learning
and teaching, at the highest levels of
which contemporary man is capable."
Lyman also attacked those who
advocate repressing students: "Frankly
I am weary of the absolutist
pronouncements from politicians and
others to whom such pronouncements
cost nothing, and who wouldn't think
of treating problems for which they
bore direct responsibility and about
which they were well informed, in such
a cavalier fashion."
Overall increased costs and the
additional expenses for security and
damage repair will cause further fiscal
belt-tightening, Lyman said. All this
comes despite a record year for
donations.
The drop in the stock market and
student activism have together caused
donations from living individuals to
drop even in this record year, he said.
Lyman termed this "an ominous sign of
the times."
"If we are to do justice to our
educational obligations and seize the
opportunities over the coming decade"
the University must raise $5 0 million a
year instead of the $30 million raised
this past year, he added.
He strongly praised those in the
administration and the schools who
have taken on extra responsibilities
because of vacant positions. He singled
out for praise Robert Freelen, the
acting Dean of Students, and John
Schwartz, new head of the campus
judicial system for the jobs they are
doing.
He said that part of Schwartz's job
to help reconstruct the campus judicial
system which has been "manifestly
inadequate." Most of the students
charged before the Stanford Judicial
Council in last spring's demonstrations
were acquitted or released because of
the difficulty of proving the charges.
Lyman told the Council that though
several other schemes were considered
he had decided that the cost of last
spring's demonstrations, including
damages and lost working time, be
added to the general costs of running
the University, rather than assessing
them to the students or the whole
community.
