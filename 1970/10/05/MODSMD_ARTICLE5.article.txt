# Kent State Report
## Commission Hits Students, Guard 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Student
violence and National Guard gunfire at
Kent State University were condemned
as "intolerable" and "inexcusable"
Sunday by a presidential commission
which probed the May 4 killing of four
students and the wounding of nine.
"Intolerable" was the word the
President's Commission on Campus
Unrest assigned to the actions of some
students. "Unnecessary, unwarranted,
and inexcusable" was the commission's
judgment on guard gunfire.
"The Kent State tragedy must surely
mark the last time that loaded rifles are
issued as a matter of course to
guardsmen confronting student
demonstrators," the commission said.
Further, the commission used the
Kent State experience to underline the
recommendations of its main report
last week which called for a cooling of
rhetoric on all sides, moral leadership
by the President himself, and an end to
undue leniency by some college
administrators and unwarranted
harshness by some law enforcement
officials.
Recommendations
In a 22,500-word report titled "the
Kent State Tragedy," drawn from
hundreds of interviews, three days of
hearings and 8 ,000 pages of FBI

investigation, the commission found in
part:
—The weight of evidence shows no
order was given to National Guardsmen
to fire that Monday at the students or
anything else.
— I The guardsmen were not under
sniper fire. "Nothing was found to
indicate that anyone other than a
guardsman discharged a firearm during
the incident," the report said.
—Agressive people in the crowd were
not closer than 20 yards to the
guardsmen never at bayonet point as
one said and the main body was some
75 yards away when the firing
occurred. The danger "was not a danger
which called for lethal force."
Fire Planned
—The specific student assembly in a
legitimately busy campus area which
prompted the guard action was
peaceful at the outset.
—The guard itself became the
transcendant issue, and it never did
disperse the crowd as it set out to do.
—Nothing was found by the FBI to
suggest that Students for a Democratic
Society elements had a hand in the
disturbances. However, FBI
information indicates the burning of
the ROTC building Saturday night may
have been planned since, "railroad

flares, a machete, and ice picks are not
customarily carried to peaceful rallies."
Also "a significant proportion" of
those at the burning were not Kent
State students.
61 Shots
—There was no evidence to suggest
drug use among demonstrators. Only
one marijuana cigarette was found in a
pocket of someone else's jacket used to
cover a shooting victim.
—The 61 shots were fired from M-l
30-caliber high velocity rifles, a shotgun
and two 4 5 caliber pistols in 13 seconds
at about 12:45 p.m., hitting the 13
students.
—The nearest students wounded,
two of them, were 20 yards from the
guardsmen. The nearest killed, Jeff
Miller, was 85 to 90 yards away. All
told, 11 of the 13 were from 75 to 25 0
yards away. Dean Kahler, 100 yards
away, was prone when he was hit in the
left side of the small of his back. Kahler
was paralyzed from the waist down.
—Guardsmen had bullets in the
chambers of their weapons "loaded and
locked" from the moment they stepped
on campus Saturday night. All that was
needed to fire was a finger flick of a
switch near the trigger. Twice before in
the 35 hours before the shooting.
Guard detachments had knelt and
leveled their rifles without firing.

students.
—The nearest students wounded,
two of them, were 20 yards from the

told, 11 of the 13 were from 75 to 25 0

was paralyzed from the waist down.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Student
violence and National Guard gunfire at
Kent State University were condemned
as "intolerable" and "inexcusable"
Sunday by a presidential commission
which probed the May 4 killing of four
students and the wounding of nine.
"Intolerable" was the word the
President's Commission on Campus
Unrest assigned to the actions of some
students. "Unnecessary, unwarranted,
and inexcusable" was the commission's
judgment on guard gunfire.
"The Kent State tragedy must surely
mark the last time that loaded rifles are
issued as a matter of course to
guardsmen confronting student
demonstrators," the commission said.
Further, the commission used the
Kent State experience to underline the
recommendations of its main report
last week which called for a cooling of
rhetoric on all sides, moral leadership
by the President himself, and an end to
undue leniency by some college
administrators and unwarranted
harshness by some law enforcement
officials.
Recommendations
In a 22,500-word report titled "the
Kent State Tragedy," drawn from
hundreds of interviews, three days of
hearings and 8 ,000 pages of FBI

investigation, the commission found in
part:
—The weight of evidence shows no
order was given to National Guardsmen
to fire that Monday at the students or
anything else.
— I The guardsmen were not under
sniper fire. "Nothing was found to
indicate that anyone other than a
guardsman discharged a firearm during
the incident," the report said.
—Agressive people in the crowd were
not closer than 20 yards to the
guardsmen never at bayonet point as
one said and the main body was some
75 yards away when the firing
occurred. The danger "was not a danger
which called for lethal force."
Fire Planned
—The specific student assembly in a
legitimately busy campus area which
prompted the guard action was
peaceful at the outset.
—The guard itself became the
transcendant issue, and it never did
disperse the crowd as it set out to do.
—Nothing was found by the FBI to
suggest that Students for a Democratic
Society elements had a hand in the
disturbances. However, FBI
information indicates the burning of
the ROTC building Saturday night may
have been planned since, "railroad

flares, a machete, and ice picks are not
customarily carried to peaceful rallies."
Also "a significant proportion" of
those at the burning were not Kent
State students.
61 Shots
—There was no evidence to suggest
drug use among demonstrators. Only
one marijuana cigarette was found in a
pocket of someone else's jacket used to
cover a shooting victim.
—The 61 shots were fired from M-l
30-caliber high velocity rifles, a shotgun
and two 4 5 caliber pistols in 13 seconds
