# Protest And The Law
## 
### Ray White 
The thoughts of a radical few
have influenced many people
across this nation. Actions based
on such thoughts have influenced
many more, both directly and
indirectly. The effects upon
college campuses has been the
most marked. Stanford is an
example of this nationwide
phenomenon. The anti-ROTC
movement of last winter and
spring offers a prime example of
the transformation from dissent
to protest, and from protest to
the destruction of property by
night.
Dissent should be and is
protected by law. One is free to
dissent, to disagree, verbally or in
print upon any issue whatsoever.
This is an essential pillar in our
system of civil (human) rights. It
must be maintained and defended
at any cost.
Protest in many forms is
allowable in this society.
Nonviolent, nondestructive
demonstrations of many types
. occur without any violation of
human rights. One can make one's
views known to large numbers of
people. Any number of ways of
attracting attention (particularly
the attention of those in power)
to one's causes is available. The
right to express one's opinions
through protests which do not
violate the rights of others is a
valuable part of this society. It is
one of the distinctions between
this type of free society and the
types of totalitarian societies of
Russia, China or Haiti.
Illegal Protest
Protest which violated the
rights of other individuals
characterized the later stages of
the anti-ROTC protests spring
quarter at Stanford (destruction
of over $10 0,000 worth of
property, physical blockage of
doors, stonings of students and of
police). This form of protest is of
course illegal in our society. The
primary function of the
governmental structures of our
society is the protection of
individual rights and freedoms.
Therefore we have decided upon a
series of sanctions to be imposed
upon those who violate the rights
of ethers. These sanctions are
imposed through a court system
which provides for jury trials and
for extensive avenues of appeal. In
order to enforce these sanctions
we have police forces.
The necessity for trained,
uniformed and armed policemen
is caused by four major facts. The
nature of some crimes is so violent
that any citizen seeking to protect
his rights or those of another from

such crimes runs a grave danger of
severe injury or even death. The
extensive organization represented
by some criminal enterprises are
far too large and powerful to be
effectively dealt with by
individual citizens. The third fact
is that most citizens prefer to
avoid direct involvement in the
enforcement of even those laws
with which they emphatically
agree. This is most unfortunate,
since it means that when
policemen are not omnipresent
(and they should not be) laws can
sometimes be broken with
impunity. As a fourth point it can
be argued that law enforcement
should be done by professionals,
but this begs the question where
inaction by the majority allows a
minority to infringe upon the
rights of another minority.
Speaking particularly of
campus or ghetto situations where
the policeman is by class and/or
age an outsider, the policeman is
called only when the citizens and
the local controls fail to protect
individual rights. When the
policeman arrives, drastic
measures are already in order and
he has to face the additional
problem of being an outsider.
Citizen aid in the enforcement of
the laws already accepted by the
overwhelming majority of citizens
would heighten the effectiveness
of the police and reduce their
possibility of making blunders.
Law enforcement under
conditions of citizen
non-cooperation can be very
ineffective. Citizen inaction may
make curtailment of some
freedoms necessary in order to
protect other, more basic
freedoms.
To make a related point, when
most people come to believe that
more police power is necessary to
adequately protect them, there
arises an atmosphere of social
crisis. There arises a tension in the
fabric of a free society in which
the rights of individuals are
protected, under the conditions
stated above. The concept of
giving over some freedoms even in
return for the effective protection
of other, more basic freedoms
raises anxiety in this society. The
political atmosphere becomes so
charged with feeling that the
ability of our governmental and
other social structures to change,
to be flexible, iada^naged.
Flexible Institutions
We are most fortunate that our
social institutions retain most of
their flexibility even when under
stress, but the degree of flexibility
which is lost under stress is
valuable and should be preserved
if possible. Abandoning legal
channels of protest to carry one's
causes along has polarized
portions of our citizenry and has
created an atmosphere which has
made it less possible for some
legislative changes to occur. In
spite of this there has been
remarkable legislative progress on
several fronts very recently. The
most prominent example is in the

field of environmental issues. Here
the legislative progress in the past
year has dwarfed that of the
previous decade. The distance to
go to get to clean air and water is
still very great, but the system is
responding in significant ways.
Working within the system is
paying off in this and in other
areas.
We have a free society. We have
a system of law which protects an
invaluable diversity of opinion.
Our system responds to pressure
which can be exerted through
legal channels. There is no need of
violence to effect changes. And
lastly, violent protests serve to
destroy some of the freedoms we
enjoy while directly violating the
rights of some citizens.
Supporting the system while
working within it for changes is
the most worthwhile course to
pursue.
