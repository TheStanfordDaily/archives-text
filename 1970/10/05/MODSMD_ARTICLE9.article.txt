## NLRB vs. Workers 
### Joseph Hardegree 
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
hearing currently underway in San Francisco is very
revealing of several things of interest to Stanford
workers.
First of all, it has been made clear once again
that the NLRB itself is essentially an instrument for
the protection of management interests against the
interests of workers. The fact that it sometimes
grants a few concessions to some workers should
not blind us to the fact that its main task is to
control and pacify labor unions.
Secondly, the strategy devised by the Stanford
administration for dealing with workers has been
brought out into the open. That strategy, in a
nutshell, is: create a "company union" with a
submissive and conservative "leadership" that can
be easily dominated by the Personnel Office.
Hearing Officer Walter L. Kintz laid the whole
thing out in an abrupt move last Thursday morning.
In an off-the-record statement before the day's
session began he stated the following:
I—The Police Officers Association and the Fire
Fighters would likely be granted the right to
bargain with the University for their respective
members.
2—The Teamsters' petition to represent Physical
Plant employees would not be granted and was on
the verge of immediate dismissal by the NLRB
regional director. This was in spite of the fact that
the Teamsters had not had a chance to
cross-examine the University witness most
pertinent to their case (Elbridge Bacon) or to
present their own witnesses.
3—The Stanford Employees Association (SEA) a
branch of the California School Employees
Association (CSEA) was told to work out
something with the university. The rationale
presented for this was that both the University and
SEA were arguing for essentially the same
bargaining units.
Later that day, President Lyman went on KZSU
to declare that the University was willing to
"compromise" along the lines suggested by the
hearing officer. It was a compromise to be sure. But
it is the workers at Stanford being compromised by
Stanford, the NLRB, and the SEA.
The University administration can see the

handwriting on the wall. They know it would be
self-defeating to meet the whole thing head-on and
try to destroy it because this would only lead to
defeat. Instead, they have taken the more likely
road of trying to co-opt and defuse the movement
before it really gets itself together.
SEA is willing to play right into their hands.
They are a safe, conservative, management-oriented
organization which has been around for a few years
and never rocked the boat.
Most of those who left SEA helped form the
United Stanford Employees (USE) which has been
much more aggressive in going after employee
benefits and processing grievances. At the present
time USE represents more workers and has been far
more active than SEA in dealing with the
University concerning employee matters. Both USE
and SEA are participating in the NLRB hearing as
"interveners" rather than "petitioners" so they
technically have the same status in the hearing.
So it is interesting, to say the least, that the
Hearing Officer should emphasize the possibility of
SEA working out a deal with the University rather
than USE. It would also be interesting to find out
where the money is coming from to hire the
expensive lawyer who is representing CSEA and
SEA. Rumor has it that he represents management
more often than workers in NLRB cases.
From a workers standpoint, USE is not without
its problems. It presently is made up mostly of
white collar workers and has few non-white
members.
The University is trying to set up a situation
where it cannot lose. If an election among
employees is held under NLRB auspices it will be in
management's interest for either no union to win or
for SEA to win. There is no absolute certainty
which it prefers at this time but it looks
suspiciously like the latter.
Unless workers really get together and resist
both alternatives the benefits of a strong and
progressive union are going to be pushed a little
farther down the road. In the long run the workers
will win. But in the short run the University
administration could succeed in pulling a fast one.
With the help of the NLRB and SEA it just might
get away with it. It is up to the workers to decide if
they want to resist the "sweetheart" deal being
prepared for them.
