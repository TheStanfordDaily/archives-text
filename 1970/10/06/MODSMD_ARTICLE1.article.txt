# Committee Interviewed
## Students Helped Pick Lyman 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
When the students involved in this summer's presidential
search finished their two month job and recommended
Provost Richard W. Lyman for the post, the group's opinions
of the search effort ranged from cynicism to complete
support.
"The search was an unusual search because Lyman was
already here," said Patrick C. Shea, of the ASSU Council of
Presidents and a member of the selection committee. "Lyman
was used as a yardstick in judging other people for the job."
Shea explained that all prospective candidates had to
"match-up" to Lyman's qualifications. "People (on the
committee) tried not to use Lyman as a model, but it
couldn't be helped."
MECHA leader, Jose Peralez, conceded that Lyman was
the "inside man. It could have been that the closer we
examined him, the worse he looked," observed Peralez, "but
he looked pretty good."
The Group's Members
Along with Shea and Peralez the committee included Bob
Grant, also on the ASSU Council of Presidents; Marshall
Kilduff, co-editor of the Daily, Elise Beckett, the President of
the Graduate Students Association (GSA); Bill fivers, who ran
unsuccessfully for student body president last spring and was
editor of the summer Daily; and Leo Bazile, former chairman
of the Black Student Union.
Bazile was unavailable for an interview, and fivers declined
to be questioned, saying only that Kilduff shared his views on
the selection matter, and could therefore speak for him.
Opinions varied as to the power and influence of the
student selection committee. Bob Grant, who along with Pat
Shea, gave unqualified support to Lyman's selection asserted
that the student group "could have effectively vetoed a man,
and the fact that we came out for Lyman made it certain he'd
be selected."

Shea viewed the situation slightly ditterently. "II the
committee voted against Lyman, it would have made a lot ol
difference. I'm not saying that he wouldn't have been chosen,
but the other groups would have taken great pains to
understand why we objected to him."
Mechanics Of Majority Rule
"By the simple mechanics of majority rule," stated Miss
Beckett, "if the students had been the only group to vote
against Lyman, he still would have been named president."
Kilduff observed that the student committee was a
"sincere public relations gesture. It (like other committees)
was set up for the best of reasons, but merely constituted an
illusion of power."
"We felt the trustees would choose the president,"
admitted Peralez. "The establishment of our committee
sought student involvement, not a decision."
According to Grant and Shea, the committee was in basic
agreement alx>ut the type of qualities it desired in a university
president.
Shea cited honesty with students and availability of the
president to talk to students as two important criteria. He
noted that four of the committee members served in the
student senate last year, and were present when then Provost
Lyman "ably fielded loaded questions from senators" during
the critical stages of the campus' unrest.
Lyman Versus Pitzer
"Lyman can speak well on his feet," commented Miss
Beckett. "Pitzer could not handle himself in front of a group
of students."
Bob Grant stressed Lyman's ability to command respect,
and therefore attract good people, as an essential quality for
the presidency. But the committee members agreed that the
principle issue was campus disruption, and there was great
concern over how the prospective presidents would respond
to student unrest.

Shea said that the committee was hopeful that the
president's "principal motive would be to maintain the
academic nature of the University." He indicated that Lyman
would take "a hard-line stand against groups who foment
disruption, and wouldn't shy away from the police" if he
thought they were needed to quell a disruption.
Campus Disruption
Peralez concurred with Shea's assessment, noting that
response to campus disruption was a major criterion used not
only by the students, but by the other search groups. "The
Trustees didn't want to spend $100,000 for nothing," said
Peralez, referring to the amount of money it cost to replace
the windows broken in last spring's uprisings. "The windows
would get broken anyway, but with a hard-line president, the
university would get its revenge.
"Lyman has said he'd protect the University with whatever
means necessary. He'd bring in the National Guard if he had
to. In light of this, the selection may have been too
short-sighted. People were looking for somebody to get the
University out of trouble, not necessarily an administrator
with long range plans."
Peralez, Beckett, and Kilduff recommended Lyman "with
reservations," stating that he was the "best available
candidate." Miss Beckett admitted that Lyman was not her
tirst choice for the job, but that he's an "extremely capable,
nice person and Stanford is lucky to have him.
Under The Circumstances
"I'm not sure of what he's thinking," said Miss Beckett,
"and I don't know him very well." But she emphasized that
under the circumstances, Lyman was her first choice. Miss
Beckett indicated that that the individual she would have
preferred, an educator, did not want the job.
When asked to elaborate on his reservations, Peralez said,
"He didn't strike me as knowing much about Chicanos. If the
University had to make additional financial cutbacks, Lyman
might consider the Chicanos to be a fringe or expendable part
of the campus community.
"But he's a strong and intelligent person," added Peralez.
"He stood on his record, and he has a good one. I felt that he
might not be the most enthusiastic innovator, he might not
initiate, but he might support others in their innovations."

Of the committee members interviewed, Kilduff was
among the most critical of Lyman's selection. "Lyman is
better than the rest, but I still don't accept him," stated
Kilduff.
In the Daily editorial, Kilduff enumerated his reservations,
questioning Lyman's stand that the university not be allowed
to become politicized, questioning also Lyman's receptivity
to academic innovation, and criticizing what Kilduff termed a
"lofty frostiness" in his dealings with students.
Peralez was critical of what he termed Lyman's desire to
"isolate the University", and also sensed "a coldness or
arrogance that 1 feel he feels towards people." But he also
noted that the president's wife "would be a great asset to
him.
"His wife could add the warmth that Lyman seems to be
lacking, and thus give him a more human look."
A Thorough Job
The committee members seemed to agree that considering
the time factor, the group did a thorough job in its search for
a president. "We all knew there was a need for a permanent
president, not an acting one," said Grant. "An acting
president can't make final decision or commitments. There
were unfilled positions in the medical school, the school of
education, and Lyman's old job as provost. We needed a
president to fill them."
Kilduff expressed a more cynical view, stating that while
there was no outside pressure to select Lyman, it "really was
a Lyman railroad.
"It is disturbing to me that the faculty established the
context of the whole thing," he continued. "The faculty did
the most thorough and exhaustive evaluation. They wanted
Lyman, and they knew who was evaluating him. Many
trustees don't think Lyman's very good, but they had little
choice but to accept a faculty recommendation.
Spectre of Pitzer
"The spectre of Pitzer was always there. We were
continually aware of the notion that we could really blow it
again. It is sad that he was used as a whipping boy, but Pitzer
was constantly being held up against Lyman."
