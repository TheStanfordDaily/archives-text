# Seminar To Consider Micronesian Problems
## 
### 
Micronesia, the islands of the
South Pacific, includes 100,000
people and six separate cultures,
directly under the domination of
the United States. Nearly all of
the islanders demand
self-determination through the
termination of America's United
Nations trusteeship.
The United Nations has assured
the Micronesians that they will
have independence, but the
United States refuses to terminate
its stewardship. The islanders say
"We have seen what has happened
in Puerto Rico and other
American dependencies and want
no part of it."
The lines are drawn, Micronesia
against the United States.
Realistically, they have little
chance against the political
power of the United States;
however, the Micronesians say
they wHi not bow easily to the

"destruction of their culture."
The Micronesian islands have
been the top of the American
military under the guise of
"strategic" irotection of the
United States. This theory has
allowed the U.S. In legally destroy
islands such as Bikini with atomic
bombs, build missle complexes
over the bull-dozed renains of
Kwajalein, and establish secret
CIA bases in Saipan.
The problems of Micronesia are
immense and the ability of
Micronesians to solve them alone
is limited.
Those who are interested in
seeking solutions to some of the
problems besetting Micronesia
today may get involved by joining
the SWOPSI workshop,
"Micronesia: Its Political, Social
and Cultural Future", which
meets every Tuesday at 7 :30 p.m.
in Food Research Room 314.
