Sadat Named President
CAIRO — Anwar Sadat was designated Monday by leaders
of Egypt's only political party to succeed Gamal Abdel
Nasser as president in a move apparently aimed at avoiding
a divisive power struggle.
The nomination by the all-powerful executive
committee of the Arab Socialist Union was tantamount to
election of the 5 2-year-old Sadat, who has been serving as
provisional president since Nasser died last Monday.
Sadat was considered by many observers to be the last
controversial of several contenders for Nasser's job. He was
named vice president by Nasser last year in a governmental
shakeup. They were old friends, Sadat having joined Nasser
in the coup that toppled King Farouk 18 years ago.
The unanimous nomination by the union's eight-man
executive committee went to the party's 150-member
central committee.
An official party statement said the executive
committee recommended that the National Assembly meet
in formal session Wednesday to endorse Sadat and that a
national referendum be held Oct. 15 .
Sadat was host to Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin and
other world leaders who attended Nasser's funeral
Thursday.
Emotional, excitable, and a fierce nationalist, Sadat was
completely loyal to his dead friend and leader, Nasser.
Uiplomates consider Sadat congenial and easy to
approach. Most observers doubt he will be able fill the
heroic role that Nasser won with the Arab masses, but no
doubts are expressed on his devotion to the independence
and dignity of Egypt.
Nixon Back
WASHINGTON — Tired but buoyant, President Nixon
arrived home Monday night after ending a nine-day
European tour with a farewell pledge in Ireland that the
United States will pursue peace for all the globe.
The presidential jet touched down at nearby Andrews
Air Force Base, Med., and Nixon and his wife, smiling and
waving as they walked, shook hands with a crowd at the
airport before boarding a helicopter for a short trip to the
White House.
Nixon was greeted by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew,
top administration and congressional leaders and members
of the diplomatic corps.
The result of his tour and visit to the 6th Fleet in the
Mediteranean, Nixon told the crowd, is that "our relations
in that critical and touchy area have been vastly
improved."
Manson Fights
LOS ANGELES — Charles Manson, shouting "I'm going to
fight for my life," dove across the counsel table toward the
judge in the Sharon Tate trial Monday.

"In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut
your head off," he cried as bailiffs subdued him in a
wrestling match in front of the bench. One said Manson
had a sharpened pencil in his hand.
The bearded chieftan of a hippie-type family is on trial
with three women followers, charged with murdering Miss
Tate and six others. Twice ejected last week for singing
and shouting insults at the judge, the defendants were
readmitted at the morning session.
Orioles, Reds In Series
BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Orioles and the Cincinnati
Reds swept into baseball's World Series by completing a
sweep of their league playoffs Monday.
The teams open the best-of-seven championship test
Saturday in Cincinnati and the Reds were made an 11-10
series favorite by Las Vegas odds-maker Jimmy "the
Greek" Snyder.
Baltimore, which lost to the New York Mets in five
games in the 1 969 series, won three straight games from
Minnesota in the American League playoffs for the
second year in a row, beating the Twins 6 to 1 Monday.
Cincinnati made it three-in a row over the Pittsburgh
Pirates with a 3-2 victory in the National League playoffs
to make it into the Series for the first time since 1961.
Salazar Inquest Report
LOS ANGELES — A coroner's jury ruled Monday that
newsman Ruben Salazar died "at the hands of another"
during Mexican-American rioting in East Los Angeles but
didn't rule on the role of sheriff's deputies whose tear gas
projectile killed him.
Dist. Atty. Evelle Younger told newsmen later his office
will study the jury's report and he will decide whether to
prosecute anyone.
"It's perfectly obvious on the basis of the information
I've received that, if anything, it's involuntary
manslaughter," Younger said. He defined involuntary
manslaughter as unlawful killing without malice or intent
to kill.
Younger said he will make his decision soon and won't
"deliberately stall" until after the Nov. 3 general election,
in which he is the Republican candidate for the state
attorney general.
Three members of the seven-man inquest jury voted for
a verdict of accidental death - a vindication of the sheriff's
officers. None voted for alternative findings: death by
suicide or natural causes.

Nasser as president in a move apparently aimed at avoiding
a divisive power struggle.
The nomination by the all-powerful executive
committee of the Arab Socialist Union was tantamount to
election of the 5 2-year-old Sadat, who has been serving as
provisional president since Nasser died last Monday.
Sadat was considered by many observers to be the last
controversial of several contenders for Nasser's job. He was
named vice president by Nasser last year in a governmental
shakeup. They were old friends, Sadat having joined Nasser
in the coup that toppled King Farouk 18 years ago.
The unanimous nomination by the union's eight-man
executive committee went to the party's 150-member
central committee.
An official party statement said the executive
committee recommended that the National Assembly meet
in formal session Wednesday to endorse Sadat and that a
national referendum be held Oct. 15 .
Sadat was host to Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin and
other world leaders who attended Nasser's funeral
Thursday.
Emotional, excitable, and a fierce nationalist, Sadat was
completely loyal to his dead friend and leader, Nasser.
Uiplomates consider Sadat congenial and easy to
approach. Most observers doubt he will be able fill the
heroic role that Nasser won with the Arab masses, but no
doubts are expressed on his devotion to the independence
and dignity of Egypt.
Nixon Back
WASHINGTON — Tired but buoyant, President Nixon
arrived home Monday night after ending a nine-day
European tour with a farewell pledge in Ireland that the
United States will pursue peace for all the globe.
The presidential jet touched down at nearby Andrews
Air Force Base, Med., and Nixon and his wife, smiling and
waving as they walked, shook hands with a crowd at the
airport before boarding a helicopter for a short trip to the
White House.
Nixon was greeted by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew,
top administration and congressional leaders and members
of the diplomatic corps.
The result of his tour and visit to the 6th Fleet in the
Mediteranean, Nixon told the crowd, is that "our relations
in that critical and touchy area have been vastly
improved."
Manson Fights
LOS ANGELES — Charles Manson, shouting "I'm going to
fight for my life," dove across the counsel table toward the
judge in the Sharon Tate trial Monday.

"In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut
your head off," he cried as bailiffs subdued him in a
wrestling match in front of the bench. One said Manson
had a sharpened pencil in his hand.
The bearded chieftan of a hippie-type family is on trial
with three women followers, charged with murdering Miss
Tate and six others. Twice ejected last week for singing
and shouting insults at the judge, the defendants were
readmitted at the morning session.
Orioles, Reds In Series
BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Orioles and the Cincinnati
Reds swept into baseball's World Series by completing a
sweep of their league playoffs Monday.
The teams open the best-of-seven championship test
Saturday in Cincinnati and the Reds were made an 11-10
series favorite by Las Vegas odds-maker Jimmy "the
Greek" Snyder.
Baltimore, which lost to the New York Mets in five
games in the 1 969 series, won three straight games from
Minnesota in the American League playoffs for the
second year in a row, beating the Twins 6 to 1 Monday.
Cincinnati made it three-in a row over the Pittsburgh
Pirates with a 3-2 victory in the National League playoffs
to make it into the Series for the first time since 1961.
Salazar Inquest Report
LOS ANGELES — A coroner's jury ruled Monday that
newsman Ruben Salazar died "at the hands of another"
during Mexican-American rioting in East Los Angeles but
didn't rule on the role of sheriff's deputies whose tear gas
projectile killed him.
Dist. Atty. Evelle Younger told newsmen later his office
will study the jury's report and he will decide whether to
prosecute anyone.
"It's perfectly obvious on the basis of the information
I've received that, if anything, it's involuntary
manslaughter," Younger said. He defined involuntary
manslaughter as unlawful killing without malice or intent
to kill.
Younger said he will make his decision soon and won't
"deliberately stall" until after the Nov. 3 general election,
in which he is the Republican candidate for the state
attorney general.
Three members of the seven-man inquest jury voted for
a verdict of accidental death - a vindication of the sheriff's
officers. None voted for alternative findings: death by
suicide or natural causes.

committee of the Arab Socialist Union was tantamount to
election of the 5 2-year-old Sadat, who has been serving as
provisional president since Nasser died last Monday.
Sadat was considered by many observers to be the last
controversial of several contenders for Nasser's job. He was
named vice president by Nasser last year in a governmental
shakeup. They were old friends, Sadat having joined Nasser
in the coup that toppled King Farouk 18 years ago.
The unanimous nomination by the union's eight-man
executive committee went to the party's 150-member
central committee.
An official party statement said the executive
committee recommended that the National Assembly meet
in formal session Wednesday to endorse Sadat and that a
national referendum be held Oct. 15 .
Sadat was host to Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin and
other world leaders who attended Nasser's funeral
Thursday.
Emotional, excitable, and a fierce nationalist, Sadat was
completely loyal to his dead friend and leader, Nasser.
Uiplomates consider Sadat congenial and easy to
approach. Most observers doubt he will be able fill the
heroic role that Nasser won with the Arab masses, but no
doubts are expressed on his devotion to the independence
and dignity of Egypt.
Nixon Back
WASHINGTON — Tired but buoyant, President Nixon
arrived home Monday night after ending a nine-day
European tour with a farewell pledge in Ireland that the
United States will pursue peace for all the globe.
The presidential jet touched down at nearby Andrews
Air Force Base, Med., and Nixon and his wife, smiling and
waving as they walked, shook hands with a crowd at the
airport before boarding a helicopter for a short trip to the
White House.
Nixon was greeted by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew,
top administration and congressional leaders and members
of the diplomatic corps.
The result of his tour and visit to the 6th Fleet in the
Mediteranean, Nixon told the crowd, is that "our relations
in that critical and touchy area have been vastly
improved."
Manson Fights
LOS ANGELES — Charles Manson, shouting "I'm going to
fight for my life," dove across the counsel table toward the
judge in the Sharon Tate trial Monday.

"In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut
your head off," he cried as bailiffs subdued him in a
wrestling match in front of the bench. One said Manson
had a sharpened pencil in his hand.
The bearded chieftan of a hippie-type family is on trial
with three women followers, charged with murdering Miss
Tate and six others. Twice ejected last week for singing
and shouting insults at the judge, the defendants were
readmitted at the morning session.
Orioles, Reds In Series
BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Orioles and the Cincinnati
Reds swept into baseball's World Series by completing a
sweep of their league playoffs Monday.
The teams open the best-of-seven championship test
Saturday in Cincinnati and the Reds were made an 11-10
series favorite by Las Vegas odds-maker Jimmy "the
Greek" Snyder.
Baltimore, which lost to the New York Mets in five
games in the 1 969 series, won three straight games from
Minnesota in the American League playoffs for the
second year in a row, beating the Twins 6 to 1 Monday.
Cincinnati made it three-in a row over the Pittsburgh
Pirates with a 3-2 victory in the National League playoffs
to make it into the Series for the first time since 1961.
Salazar Inquest Report
LOS ANGELES — A coroner's jury ruled Monday that
newsman Ruben Salazar died "at the hands of another"
during Mexican-American rioting in East Los Angeles but
didn't rule on the role of sheriff's deputies whose tear gas
projectile killed him.
Dist. Atty. Evelle Younger told newsmen later his office
will study the jury's report and he will decide whether to
prosecute anyone.
"It's perfectly obvious on the basis of the information
I've received that, if anything, it's involuntary
manslaughter," Younger said. He defined involuntary
manslaughter as unlawful killing without malice or intent
to kill.
Younger said he will make his decision soon and won't
"deliberately stall" until after the Nov. 3 general election,
in which he is the Republican candidate for the state
attorney general.
Three members of the seven-man inquest jury voted for
a verdict of accidental death - a vindication of the sheriff's
officers. None voted for alternative findings: death by
suicide or natural causes.
