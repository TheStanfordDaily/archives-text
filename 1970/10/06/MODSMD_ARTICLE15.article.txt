# Several Cases
## Off-ROTC Trials Proceed 
### DAVE BROWN 
Trials stemming from last spring's
anti-ROTC demonstrations are still
being prosecuted by both Santa Clara
County and the Stuntord Judicial
Council (SJC), chaired by Professor
Marc Franklin of the Law School.
According to Franklin, most cases
being tried by the SJC stem from
non-violent sit-ins on the front steps of
the ROTC building during the student
strike, and from the Off-ROTC
Movement's attempts to audit Army
ROTC classes- attempts which led to
the closing of the ROTC building.
According to Franklin, 2 5 cases have
been dropped due to a lack of evidence
or of witnesses linking the defendants
to the sit-in, in which the names of 4 4
demonstrators were taken by faculty
members. In 15 cases the defendants
were found guilty and ordered to pay
to the University "light fines of about
$100." One case is still pending, and no
names were made public.
A University News Service release
claims that the SJC imposed fines
totaling $1 , 975 in 23 cases stemming
from disruptions last spring.
Franklin stated that SJC charges
against students participating in the
two strike-related, non-violent Old
Union sit-ins have been dropped since
those arrested for trespassing will
shortly be tried in Santa Clara County
Court. "Several individual rock
throwers" will be tried by the SJC this
spring, and "some have already been
tried by Santa Clara County," he
added.
Mack and Perkins
Two of the "individual rock
throwers" that Franklin was referring
to were students Burnell Mack, and
Frank Perkins, both charged with
assault with a deadly weapon and
assault and battery. Perkins was found
not guilty of the felony charge, but
convicted of misdemeanor assault and
battery while Mack pleaded guilty to
the misdemeanor charge. Both were
sentenced to four months in jail, and

given two years probation. Mack and
Perkins were fined $5 00 and $625
respectively.
Franklin also reported that "eight to
ten cases are still pending," from the
April 7 demonstration when several
dozen "auditors" entered Army ROTC
classes.
One of the cases being pursued by
the SJC is that of Michael Sweeney,
who was recently convicted of
contempt of court for disrupting an
Army ROTC class, and violating the
University disruptions injunction. He
was jailed for ten days and fined $200
in a University-initiated civil suit
stemming from the same incident.
According to Sweeney, "This is a
clear case of fascist repression, and the
University will use any tool possible to
attempt to intimidate the people, even
double jeopardy. However, I don't plan
to pay any attention to it."

Sweeney also goes to trial today for
allegedly throwing a brick at a Palo
Alto police officer at Lytton Plaza on
the night of July 11 during a rock
concert. Sweeney holds that "the
charges are all bullshit," and maintains
that he was singled out as a leader of
the Off-ROTC movement.
Double Jeopardy
According to Franklin, the SJC will
first decide if prosecuting Sweeney
would constitute double jeopardy for
the "several cases that overlap."
Franklin explained some of these cases
have been or are being tried by Santa
Clara County authorities.
In a related incident, Janet Weiss, a
co-defendant of Sweeney's in his
contempt trial, also goes to trial for
"interfering with a police officer" during
a peaceful anti-ROTC demonstration
on campus. The first trial for that same
offense resulted in a hung jury.

to pay any attention to it."

Sweeney also goes to trial today for
allegedly throwing a brick at a Palo
Alto police officer at Lytton Plaza on
the night of July 11 during a rock
concert. Sweeney holds that "the
charges are all bullshit," and maintains
that he was singled out as a leader of
the Off-ROTC movement.
Double Jeopardy
According to Franklin, the SJC will
first decide if prosecuting Sweeney
would constitute double jeopardy for
the "several cases that overlap."
Franklin explained some of these cases
have been or are being tried by Santa
Clara County authorities.
In a related incident, Janet Weiss, a
co-defendant of Sweeney's in his
contempt trial, also goes to trial for
"interfering with a police officer" during
a peaceful anti-ROTC demonstration
on campus. The first trial for that same
offense resulted in a hung jury.

SPRING ACTION—Case resulting from Off-ROTC movement and related
activities last spring are still being heard in County Courts.
Trials stemming from last spring's
anti-ROTC demonstrations are still
being prosecuted by both Santa Clara
County and the Stuntord Judicial
Council (SJC), chaired by Professor
Marc Franklin of the Law School.
According to Franklin, most cases
being tried by the SJC stem from
non-violent sit-ins on the front steps of
the ROTC building during the student
strike, and from the Off-ROTC
Movement's attempts to audit Army
ROTC classes- attempts which led to
the closing of the ROTC building.
According to Franklin, 2 5 cases have
been dropped due to a lack of evidence
or of witnesses linking the defendants
to the sit-in, in which the names of 4 4
demonstrators were taken by faculty
members. In 15 cases the defendants
were found guilty and ordered to pay
to the University "light fines of about
$100." One case is still pending, and no
names were made public.
A University News Service release
claims that the SJC imposed fines
totaling $1 , 975 in 23 cases stemming
from disruptions last spring.
Franklin stated that SJC charges
against students participating in the
two strike-related, non-violent Old
Union sit-ins have been dropped since
those arrested for trespassing will
shortly be tried in Santa Clara County
Court. "Several individual rock
throwers" will be tried by the SJC this
spring, and "some have already been
tried by Santa Clara County," he
added.
Mack and Perkins
Two of the "individual rock
throwers" that Franklin was referring
to were students Burnell Mack, and
Frank Perkins, both charged with
assault with a deadly weapon and
assault and battery. Perkins was found
not guilty of the felony charge, but
convicted of misdemeanor assault and
battery while Mack pleaded guilty to
the misdemeanor charge. Both were
sentenced to four months in jail, and

given two years probation. Mack and
Perkins were fined $5 00 and $625
respectively.
Franklin also reported that "eight to
ten cases are still pending," from the
April 7 demonstration when several
dozen "auditors" entered Army ROTC
classes.
One of the cases being pursued by
the SJC is that of Michael Sweeney,
who was recently convicted of
contempt of court for disrupting an
Army ROTC class, and violating the
University disruptions injunction. He
was jailed for ten days and fined $200
in a University-initiated civil suit
stemming from the same incident.
According to Sweeney, "This is a
clear case of fascist repression, and the
University will use any tool possible to
attempt to intimidate the people, even
double jeopardy. However, I don't plan
to pay any attention to it."

Sweeney also goes to trial today for
