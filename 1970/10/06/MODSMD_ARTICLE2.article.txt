# Prison Hostages Released; Panthers Still Hold Out
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — By ultimatum of
Mayor John V. Lindsay, prisoners
released Monday the last of 32 hostages
they seized during riots at five of the
city's jails. A handful of inmates still
held out in one jail, including nine
Black Panthers on trial on charges of
conspiring to bomb and murder.
Acting Police CommisionerJohn F.
Walsh told newsmen corrections
officials "will have to cut through steel
doors to get to the remaining
prisoners."
The Panthers were among a band of
35 holed up on the top floor of the
Long Island City detention center.
They were said to want their lawyers

present to insure against any
mistreatment after surrender.
The holdouts—-39 by their own
count-refused to budge after they
heard reports of other prisoners being
beaten on emerging into the prison
courtyard.
Corrections Commissioner George
McGrath and Black Panther lawyers
announced latter at a news conference
that the inmates locked in on the top
floor would be "escorted or removed"
in full public view to allay their fears of
mistreatment.
Gerald Lefcourt, Panther lawyer,
said he would be among those present
when the prisoners were brought out.

As Lindsay threatened to send in
5 00 riot-equipped police and
corrections officers, most of the other
338 prisoners in the Long Island City
facility surrendered four days after
they took control of the jail. They gave
up the last three of the seven hostages
they originally held.
Four other prison uprisings which
followed the Long Island City
disturbance were put down earlier.
The mayor and Corrections
Commissioner George Mcgrath had
promised no reprisals against any of the
5,9 00 inmates of the five institutions,
not all of whom took part in the
rioting.
Newsmen from a vantage point
above the courtyard said they saw a
number of prisoners beaten and kicked
by guards. The Corrections Corrmission
said eight Long Island City prisoners
were taken to Bellevue Hospital with
injuries.
A corrections officer, refusing to
identify himself by name said: "As the
prisoners came out, some began
fighting us and we fought them back.
Whatever roughing up occurred was
provoked by the prisoners. They held
three officers hostage since Friday and
they had all sorts of weapons, spears,
sharpened spoons. They had some 150
weapons . . . and they fought with us
when we took them away."

The only non-subsidised, low-rent housing project on the Stanford campus came to an end on Sunday. Despite demands of
the administration that even students involved in the project "leave the campus immediately," the Palo Alto Tenants' Union
managed to establish "Tent City" Monday. With a few tents grouped near Mem Aud, the Tenants' Union attempted to show
that Stanford and its trustees are developing the university's land holdings without meeting their responsibilities to workers
ind the community."
