# Labor Board Rejects Bargaining Petition
## 
### 
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) yesterday rejected a petition
filed by the United Stanford
Employees (USE) asking that a
bargaining unit composed of about
4 0 00 non-faculty, non-professional
employees be recognized on campus.
The USE petition was filed in
response to a Stanford Employees
Association (SEA) request that a 1600
employee bargaining unit be
recognized. The principle difference
between the two proposals is the
inclusion of 1700 clerical workers,
mostly women.
The USE petition was filed on the
grounds that the group had acted as a
representative for these employees and
had dealt with the administration.
However, the regional NLRB director
ruled that the group would have to
show that it had acted as exclusive
representative for the employees, and
overruled the USE petition on those
grounds. USE will not appeal the
decision, according to Jim Berk, their
representative at the hearings.
The Teamsters Union, which was
informed Thursday that its petition to
represent the Physical Plant workers
would be rejected because the
bargaining unit was too small, told the
hearing officer, Walter Kintz, that it
would begin soliciting statements of
support from all maintenance
employees on campus. According to

Teamster figures, there are about 420
employees in this group, as compared
to about 160 workers at the Physical
Plant.
Under NLRB rules, the Teamsters
have 48 hours to file the required
statements of support signed by at least
30 percent of the workers included in
the proposed unit.
Keith Stothers, a Physical Plant
worker and Teamster supporter, said
last night that the Teamsters already
had more than a 30 percent show of
support from the proposed unit.
Yesterday's session was also marked
by the entry of a new "intervener" into
the hearing â€” the United Electrical
The Electrical Workers
apparently entered the hearings to
protect their interest should an election
be held as a result of the current
hearings.
Most of yesterday's session was
spent in hearing testimony from
Dwight Adams, the University's
Business Manager. He introduced nine
exhibits, five of which were identified
as being closely related to the SEA's
proposed bargaining unit. One of the
exhibits entered into the hearing record
was a copy of SEA's constitution.
One group, the Workers Action
Caucus, has scheduled a meeting at
noon today in 27 4 Tresidder to discuss
the effects of the current hearings on
the University's workers.
