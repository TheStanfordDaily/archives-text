# 40 Seats At Stake
## ASSU Senate Elections Approach 
### 
This year's ASSU senate will be elected on October
14 th and 15 th. Petitions of nomination are due in the
ASSU office by Friday of this week.
Despite this year's reduced budget, the senate
promises to be interesting. Past elections have been
plagued by an extremely large number of candidates
competing for the forty seats. Elected by major
departments, candidates have found it difficult to
communicate with their widely separated constituents.
In past years politically ambitious candidates have
banded together in factions and run entire slates of
candidates. Last year the Black Student Union
succeeded in electing eleven senators by presenting a
unified campaign effort. This year the HSU will repeat
its successful formula and present IS candidates to the
voters.
Pat Shea of the Council of Presidents has indicated
that the Council has not yet decided to run a formal
slate, but in speaking to the Daily Shea said, "1 have
encouraged some people to run. The Senate needs open
minded students who can respond to the issues and
avoid the parlimentary pitfalls." In commenting on last
year's Senate Shea said, "Let's be honest, last year's
Senate did not do anything."
The conservative Free Campus Movement is
attempting to find candidates who will run for office.
Chris Mocker, FCM spokesman, told the Daily "We are
trying to find as many candidates with our ideological
bent as possible, and encourage them to run."
"However," Mocker noted, "we have not, decided to
run a formal slate."
No MKCHA Slate
A spokesman for MKCHA, the Chicano Student
organization, stated that MKCMA does not intend to

field a slate after last year's heated Senate budget
battles, in which the BSU sided with conservatives to
cut the budget allocations for both the Asian-American
Student Alliance and MECHA.
Both MECHA and white radicals denounced the
BSU's actions at the time by charging that the BSU had
been playing power politics in an attempt to protect
it's own budget allocations. Though MECHA is not
discouraging its members from running, the
organization will take no active part in this year's
campaign.
Senators will be elected by the widely
misunderstood Hare system of voting. The system,
designed by Dr. Nathan Hare, former head of the Black
Studies Department of San Francisco State, is an
attempt to insure that all factions, even outspoken
minorities, will have some representation in legislative
bodies.
Senators Elected by Hare System
Under the system electorate selects, in preferential
order, a number of candidates to fill the seats allotted
to their department. As the ballots are counted those
candidates receiving enough votes for election are set
aside as elected. All ballots on which a candidate is
selected in the first position and who has already been
declared a winner, will have their second place votes
counted. The Hare System has lead to some confusion
in the election process at Stanford, but there can be no
doubt that the system does enable all factions to
exercise some legislative powers.
In past years the Senate has had a moderately left
slant, which has continued following reorganization of
the Senate two years ago. The primary concern of the
Senate has been its own budeet allocations. Also

students who serve on Trustee, University, and
Academic Senate committees are all either appointed
or approved by the ASSU Senate.
Last year's Senate passed numerous resolutions on
University and national policy. The Trustee decision
severing Stanford's tie with its own war related
research facility (Stanford Research Institute), and the
Invasion of Cambodia by U.S. forces were both
vigorously condemned.
Opportunities for Senate Action
The 1970-71 year may offer the Senate the most
opportunity for exercise of student participat ion in the
governing of Stanford in many years. A new president,
the issues of housing, land use, police on campus, and
Department of Defense research will require the Senate
to respond quickly and firmly.
Past Senates, divided by factionalism and the
exercise political gamesmanship, have proven pitifully
slow in their attempts to deal with even the most vital
of issues. Even if (he Senate does respond to Stanford's
growing political turmoil, its affect might prove
negligible. One Senator recently commented "We are
powerless, all we can do is pass resolutions." Another
Senator commented, "At Stanford we are all leaders
with no followers, the Senate is no different."
Students registered in Undergraduate Humanities
and Sciences are represented by 10 seats. H&S
graduates will elect 7 Senators and Graduates in
Engineering and Earth Sciences will select 6 Senators.
Undergraduate General Studies is represented by 8
seats, and undergraduate engineering has 2
representatives. Two seats are allocated for the
Business School, two seats for Education, two seats for
Medicine and two seats for the l*iw School.

departments, candidates have found it difficult to
communicate with their widely separated constituents.
In past years politically ambitious candidates have
banded together in factions and run entire slates of
candidates. Last year the Black Student Union
succeeded in electing eleven senators by presenting a
unified campaign effort. This year the HSU will repeat
its successful formula and present IS candidates to the
voters.
Pat Shea of the Council of Presidents has indicated
that the Council has not yet decided to run a formal
slate, but in speaking to the Daily Shea said, "1 have
encouraged some people to run. The Senate needs open
minded students who can respond to the issues and
avoid the parlimentary pitfalls." In commenting on last
year's Senate Shea said, "Let's be honest, last year's
Senate did not do anything."
The conservative Free Campus Movement is
attempting to find candidates who will run for office.
Chris Mocker, FCM spokesman, told the Daily "We are
trying to find as many candidates with our ideological
bent as possible, and encourage them to run."
"However," Mocker noted, "we have not, decided to
run a formal slate."
No MKCHA Slate
A spokesman for MKCHA, the Chicano Student
organization, stated that MKCMA does not intend to

field a slate after last year's heated Senate budget
battles, in which the BSU sided with conservatives to
cut the budget allocations for both the Asian-American
Student Alliance and MECHA.
Both MECHA and white radicals denounced the
BSU's actions at the time by charging that the BSU had
been playing power politics in an attempt to protect
it's own budget allocations. Though MECHA is not
discouraging its members from running, the
organization will take no active part in this year's
campaign.
Senators will be elected by the widely
misunderstood Hare system of voting. The system,
designed by Dr. Nathan Hare, former head of the Black
Studies Department of San Francisco State, is an
attempt to insure that all factions, even outspoken
minorities, will have some representation in legislative
bodies.
Senators Elected by Hare System
Under the system electorate selects, in preferential
order, a number of candidates to fill the seats allotted
to their department. As the ballots are counted those
candidates receiving enough votes for election are set
aside as elected. All ballots on which a candidate is
selected in the first position and who has already been
declared a winner, will have their second place votes
counted. The Hare System has lead to some confusion
in the election process at Stanford, but there can be no
doubt that the system does enable all factions to
exercise some legislative powers.
In past years the Senate has had a moderately left
slant, which has continued following reorganization of
the Senate two years ago. The primary concern of the
Senate has been its own budeet allocations. Also

students who serve on Trustee, University, and
Academic Senate committees are all either appointed
or approved by the ASSU Senate.
Last year's Senate passed numerous resolutions on
University and national policy. The Trustee decision
severing Stanford's tie with its own war related
research facility (Stanford Research Institute), and the
Invasion of Cambodia by U.S. forces were both
vigorously condemned.
Opportunities for Senate Action
The 1970-71 year may offer the Senate the most
opportunity for exercise of student participat ion in the
governing of Stanford in many years. A new president,
the issues of housing, land use, police on campus, and
Department of Defense research will require the Senate
to respond quickly and firmly.
Past Senates, divided by factionalism and the
exercise political gamesmanship, have proven pitifully
slow in their attempts to deal with even the most vital
of issues. Even if (he Senate does respond to Stanford's
growing political turmoil, its affect might prove
negligible. One Senator recently commented "We are
powerless, all we can do is pass resolutions." Another
Senator commented, "At Stanford we are all leaders
with no followers, the Senate is no different."
Students registered in Undergraduate Humanities
and Sciences are represented by 10 seats. H&S
graduates will elect 7 Senators and Graduates in
Engineering and Earth Sciences will select 6 Senators.
Undergraduate General Studies is represented by 8
seats, and undergraduate engineering has 2
representatives. Two seats are allocated for the
Business School, two seats for Education, two seats for
Medicine and two seats for the l*iw School.
This year's ASSU senate will be elected on October
14 th and 15 th. Petitions of nomination are due in the
ASSU office by Friday of this week.

Pat Shea of the Council of Presidents has indicated
that the Council has not yet decided to run a formal
slate, but in speaking to the Daily Shea said, "1 have
encouraged some people to run. The Senate needs open
minded students who can respond to the issues and
avoid the parlimentary pitfalls." In commenting on last
year's Senate Shea said, "Let's be honest, last year's
Senate did not do anything."
The conservative Free Campus Movement is
attempting to find candidates who will run for office.
Chris Mocker, FCM spokesman, told the Daily "We are
trying to find as many candidates with our ideological
bent as possible, and encourage them to run."
"However," Mocker noted, "we have not, decided to
run a formal slate."
No MKCHA Slate
A spokesman for MKCHA, the Chicano Student
organization, stated that MKCMA does not intend to

field a slate after last year's heated Senate budget
battles, in which the BSU sided with conservatives to
cut the budget allocations for both the Asian-American
Student Alliance and MECHA.
Both MECHA and white radicals denounced the
BSU's actions at the time by charging that the BSU had
been playing power politics in an attempt to protect
it's own budget allocations. Though MECHA is not
discouraging its members from running, the
organization will take no active part in this year's
campaign.
Senators will be elected by the widely
misunderstood Hare system of voting. The system,
designed by Dr. Nathan Hare, former head of the Black
Studies Department of San Francisco State, is an
attempt to insure that all factions, even outspoken
minorities, will have some representation in legislative
bodies.
Senators Elected by Hare System
Under the system electorate selects, in preferential
order, a number of candidates to fill the seats allotted
to their department. As the ballots are counted those
candidates receiving enough votes for election are set
aside as elected. All ballots on which a candidate is
selected in the first position and who has already been
declared a winner, will have their second place votes
counted. The Hare System has lead to some confusion
in the election process at Stanford, but there can be no
doubt that the system does enable all factions to
exercise some legislative powers.
In past years the Senate has had a moderately left
slant, which has continued following reorganization of
the Senate two years ago. The primary concern of the
Senate has been its own budeet allocations. Also

students who serve on Trustee, University, and
Academic Senate committees are all either appointed
or approved by the ASSU Senate.
Last year's Senate passed numerous resolutions on
University and national policy. The Trustee decision
severing Stanford's tie with its own war related
research facility (Stanford Research Institute), and the
Invasion of Cambodia by U.S. forces were both
vigorously condemned.
Opportunities for Senate Action
The 1970-71 year may offer the Senate the most
opportunity for exercise of student participat ion in the
governing of Stanford in many years. A new president,
the issues of housing, land use, police on campus, and
Department of Defense research will require the Senate
to respond quickly and firmly.
Past Senates, divided by factionalism and the
exercise political gamesmanship, have proven pitifully
slow in their attempts to deal with even the most vital
of issues. Even if (he Senate does respond to Stanford's
growing political turmoil, its affect might prove
negligible. One Senator recently commented "We are
powerless, all we can do is pass resolutions." Another
Senator commented, "At Stanford we are all leaders
with no followers, the Senate is no different."
Students registered in Undergraduate Humanities
and Sciences are represented by 10 seats. H&S

Engineering and Earth Sciences will select 6 Senators.
Undergraduate General Studies is represented by 8
seats, and undergraduate engineering has 2
