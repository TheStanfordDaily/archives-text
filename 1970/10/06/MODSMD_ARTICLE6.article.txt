Answers to common questions on the lottery
1. A person who receives a I-A (or I-A-0 or 1-0) at ANY point
during the year (January 1 through December 31) and continues to
hold this classification through December 31 without his number
being reached will have assumed his full "year" of prime liability. For
example, if a man with lottery number 215 is classified I-A on
December 31 of this year and 215 has not been reached at any time
during the year by his draft board, he has completed his "year" of
liability by the next day, January 1.
2. If a person has a lottery number which is reached during his year
of liability, he can be inducted even if appeals, physical delays, paper
work, and so on delay the actual induction notice until after
December 31 of his year of liability.
3. According to recent announcement, if a person turns 26 before
the issuance of the induction notice, he will be put in a different
priority group and should not be drafted.
