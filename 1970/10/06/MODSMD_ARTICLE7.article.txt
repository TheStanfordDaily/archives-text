# The
						University & International Subversion

(The following article is
reprinted from the October, 1970,
issue of Ramparts Magazine J
About a year ago, Ramparts
sent David Ransom to investigate
the story of the "Berkeley Mafia"
and its role in the Indonesian
Massacre of 1965. In this issue, we
are printing his story. It is a tale
of international subversion and
academic complicity that should
give sleepless nights to everyone
involved in the American
university system, especially to
every recipient of foundation
money and to every "scholarly"
ambassador doing research in the
Third World.
Ransom's story is a parable of
the modern American empire: it
shows how the Ford Foundation
and its high-class academic
"advisory" teams have supplanted
old empires and subverted new
nationalisms. It is a vivid account
of the costs of this process, which
in Indonesia brought on a
bloodbath unparalleled in our
times. The death of from
3-500,000 Indonesians, however,
did not particularly bother State
Department, Ford Foundation
and American university
diplomats. They practically
tripped over the corpses in their
haste to open up the archipelago
to United States corporate
prospectors searching for the
Indies' fabulous wealth in
minerals and oil.
The university community was
involved in the Indonesian events

to an extraordinary degree. But
the most salient lesson of the
episode is that the university
system in this country is corrupt
not just at its Pentagon- and
CIA-infested extremities but also
at its professional heart. Every
week we are told by some
"courageous" administrator that
the university system must not
allow itself to become
"politicized" by radical students.
But it is clear that institutions like
the Ford Foundation and the
Pentagon politicized it long ago.
The "scientific" intellectual
doctrines it promotes as objective
and neutral are in fact the
political dogmas with which U.S.
agencies and interests dominated
people in the Third World. And
behind the facade of its abstract
models lie the techniques and
personnel for the management of
a modern empire.
That this should be so is hardly
surprising. In an article on the
"Sinews of Empire" (October
1969), we showed how the entire
program of international studies,
which includes more than 190
institutes and centers in schools
throughout the country, was
created from whole cloth by the
Carnegie, Ford and Rockefeller
Foundations in conjunction with
an elite network drawn largely
from the OSS-CIA and the
Council on Foreign Relations. We
also showed how these stewards
of American empire created the
intellectual terms and academic
programs of international studies
so that they dovetailed exactly
with the task of administering
imperial policy.
As a result of the United
States' genocidal attempt to
subdue Indochina, some
Americans have plunged into
demonstrations, resistance and
other attempts to cripple the war

machine. Last spring's university
strike was the most impressive of
these actions thus far. But in
every case it has been the
Pentagon, the CIA or the
personalities of various politicians
that have been regarded as the
enemy. Meanwhile, liberals have
insisted that the American
university is our last best hope;
that it is an enclave of enlightened
criticism of American military
policy. But Ransom's story shows
that the radicals who have
assaulted the enemy within the
universities have been right all
along: higher education as now
constituted is an integral part of
the system of war and oppression
by which this country exercises its
will abroad. Perhaps the most
striking aspect of Ransom's
account of the academic takeover
of Indonesia is that Ford and the
universities made the CIA and
Pentagon presence virtually
irrelevant, a striking indication of
how deeply involved the
university has become.
Exposes, however, will not
stop the machinery of empire.
Four years ago, Ramparts revealed
the universities' collusion with the
CIA in setting up the Diem regime
in South Vietnam (see Ramparts,
April 1966); but the president of
Michigan State University, who
superintended this alliance, is
today the head of Nixon's AID
program, while the chief architect
of CIA-MSU cooperation, Wesley
Fischel, is now head of the Center
for Vietnamese Studies and
Program at Southern Illinois
University. Exposes must lead to
action, and action to the ability to
close the university down, if
necessary, rather than allow it to
continue to function as part of
the imperial war-machine.
This fall tens of thousands of
university students are planning to

knock on doors for peace
candidates in an effort to halt the
Indochina war at the polls. But
how can they expect to reverse
policy in remote Washington if
they cannot prevent their own
universities from serving as
strategic nerve centers for those
same imperial war programs'?
As the school year begins
across the nation, Ramparts urges
students (and non-students) to
focus their anti-war energies on
the campuses themselves, where
the enemy is close and the
anti-war forces are concentrated.
The demands should be loud and
uncompromising:
1. End all ROTC programs.
2. Stop all weapons research.
3. Close all existing
international studies programs and

institutes and reconstitute them
under student-faculty control as
centers for the study of American
imperialism.
4. End all field projects in the
Third World which are funded by
bodies external to the university
and not under faculty-student
control.
5. Recognize the political
nature of foundations like Ford,
Rockefeller and Carnegie and put
an end to all projects funded by
them, as well as those funded by
the Pentagon, AID and the CIA.
If these objectives can be even
partially accomplished, the
university community will not
only have done a tremendous
service to the peoples of
Southeast Asia and the rest of the
Third World, but also to itself.
