Labor Negotiations
Editor, The Daily:
Two points in your Friday
article on the current National
Labor Relations Board
proceedings particularly warrant
correction. First the compromise
proposed by the Hearing Officer
does not include University
recognition of the labor
organizations seeking to represent
the employees in the three
bargaining units described. If the
compromise is concluded
Stanford will consent to an
election in each of those units.
Recognition of any union will
come only if the majority of the
employees in the unit selects the
union as their bargaining
representative. This point is
important not only by way of
clarification, but also to ensure
that people understand that
Stanford is not trying to preclude
the freedom of choice which the
law provides its employees.
Second, the article reports
President Lyman as saying that
faculty, teaching staff or other
professional employees would not
be excluded from engaging in
collective labor activity under the
proposed compromise. He also
said, and this is also important,
that those employees whose jobs
are chiefly clerical in nature—who
are not included in the proposed
unit—would not be excluded from
collective labor activity.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As usual, the radicals got the
first word in the Daily about
ASSU fees, but did a disservice to
the community (particularly

freshmen) by telling, as radicals
will, about one-quarter of the
whole story.
Both the Daily and the
administration are at fault by not
more fully explaining the $3
charge, which was voted by
students spring quarter. Only $1
of this goes to the ASSU proper.
The other $2 go to the Daily and
Special Events--a dollar apiece.
So before the rads get on their
white horse about illegal charges
and rip-off of the students' money
let's make it clear that students
voted this charge themselves.
Also, the issue of whether
ASSU should be compulsory was
raised, not by the rads, but by the
Free Campus Movement. This
issue was also voted upon in the
spring, but a referendum and a
slate of candidates dedicated to
non-compulsory student
government was defeated.
So contrary to the implication
of the radicals letter, that $3
tacked onto everyone's
registration was decided upon by
a democratic vote of students, as
was the issue of compulsory
ASSU. If the Radical Libertarian
Alliance wants to get together
with the Free Campus Movement
to make ASSU non-compulsory, I
suggest they see Ray White (FCM
chairman) for some ideas.

Student Fees
Editor, THE DAILY:
As usual, the radicals got the
first word in the Daily about
ASSU fees, but did a disservice to
the community (particularly

freshmen) by telling, as radicals
will, about one-quarter of the
whole story.
Both the Daily and the
administration are at fault by not
more fully explaining the $3
charge, which was voted by
students spring quarter. Only $1
of this goes to the ASSU proper.
The other $2 go to the Daily and
Special Events--a dollar apiece.
So before the rads get on their
white horse about illegal charges
and rip-off of the students' money
let's make it clear that students
voted this charge themselves.
Also, the issue of whether
ASSU should be compulsory was
raised, not by the rads, but by the
Free Campus Movement. This
issue was also voted upon in the
spring, but a referendum and a
slate of candidates dedicated to
non-compulsory student
government was defeated.
So contrary to the implication
of the radicals letter, that $3
tacked onto everyone's
registration was decided upon by
a democratic vote of students, as
was the issue of compulsory
ASSU. If the Radical Libertarian
Alliance wants to get together
with the Free Campus Movement
to make ASSU non-compulsory, I
suggest they see Ray White (FCM
chairman) for some ideas.

Labor Negotiations
Editor, The Daily:
Two points in your Friday
article on the current National
Labor Relations Board
proceedings particularly warrant
correction. First the compromise
proposed by the Hearing Officer
does not include University
recognition of the labor
organizations seeking to represent
the employees in the three
bargaining units described. If the
compromise is concluded
Stanford will consent to an
election in each of those units.
Recognition of any union will
come only if the majority of the
employees in the unit selects the
union as their bargaining
representative. This point is
important not only by way of
clarification, but also to ensure
that people understand that
Stanford is not trying to preclude
the freedom of choice which the
law provides its employees.
Second, the article reports
President Lyman as saying that
faculty, teaching staff or other
professional employees would not
be excluded from engaging in
collective labor activity under the
proposed compromise. He also
said, and this is also important,
that those employees whose jobs
are chiefly clerical in nature—who
are not included in the proposed
unit—would not be excluded from
collective labor activity.
