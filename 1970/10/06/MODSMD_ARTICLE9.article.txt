# KZSU Presents Expanded Format
## 
### CRAIG COTORA PAUL GRUSHKIN 
"I'm pretty enthusiastic about
everything going on here,"
remarked Dave Hosley, station
manager at KZSU. "I feel that
KZSU is finally becoming a real
force in campus communi
cations."
"Basically I feel the purpose of
KZSU is to keep the entire
Stanford community informed, as
well as providing entertainment,"
Dave continued. "And, as a result,
we are giving more air time to
public affairs programming."
In large part, explained the
station manager, KZSU's recent
success is due to the KZSU Public
Affairs Programming Director,
Mrs. Mel Paul. She has worked
with the British, Canadian, and
Australian Broadcasting
Corporations. According to
Hosley, Mrs. Paul "certainly will
ensure" that KZSU will have high
quality public affairs
programming this year.
"We will broadcast public
affairs programs every week on
Monday through Friday
evenings," explained Mrs. Paul.
"There are such great resources in
the community and important

issues to discuss, and, well, I hope
our plans speak for themselves."
Weekly News Conference
"Every Tuesday evening," she
related, "President Lyman will
talk with guests and news people,
and respond to questions from the
radio audience. We plan to talk
with BSU representatives October
7, and, of course, there's Larry
Liebert's new talk show every
Thursday evening."
"We plan to have a Friday
night 'Magazine' which will
include highlights of the week's
vital stories," she concluded.
In addition to strong emphasis
on public affairs programming,
Dave Hosley listed other reasons
for his enthusiasm about KZSU's
expanding influence in the
mid-peninsula area.
"This fall we will conduct our
first detailed audience survey to
guide the selection of new
programming," he explained. "We
would like to determine what
portion of our listening audience
is non-student in the hope that we
can offer some programs related
to the interests of workers in the
Stanford area."
"KZSU has already abandoned
'block broadcasting' of different

types of music during the day for
an all rock format," he related.
Up-to-Date Information
"We will continue to have
detailed, remote news coverage
this year. I know that last year
nearly everybody in the Stanford
community looked to KZSU as
'the source' of up-to-date
information during the spring
campus disturbances."
KZSU has two 2 0-man remote
news crews available for 2 4 hour
news coverage of any emergency
that might arise on campus and,
naturally, we will also offer
selective live coverage of
Academic Council meetings and
major speeches."
Dave has seen an important
change of attitude toward KZSU
during the past year. "Our
programming is very close to
professional in qualityâ€”and it's
still improving!" Dave proudly
points to his staff, which includes
Mark Lawrence as chief engineer,
and Bob Jacobs as business
manager. Many on KZSU's staff,
Hosely pointed out, may work
between 20 and 4 0 hours a week.
"Our financial situation is in
much sounder shape than it has
ever been," said Dave. "Thanks
basically to a $3600 contribution
from ASSU and $3000 from
advertising, we will have an
operating budget of $13,000 this
year. In the past our budget has
been under $6700."
Lack of Experience
Dave explained that KZSU's
most pressing problem is the lack
of experience indicated in the
newness of the staff. The process
of training does take some time
and, according to Hosely, it is
difficult to make the same
demands of volunteers that would
ordinarily be made on
professional broadcasting people.
In spite of this difficulty, Dave
pointed to many useful
improvements that have been
recently initiated. KZSU has
obtained a regular secretary which
allows the station to keep regular

business hours. KZSU has also
initiated two two-unit University
courses in management and
reporting to help train interested
or prospective broadcasting
personnel. The station is also
renovating its studios and offices
in the basement of Memorial
Auditorium.
Dave would like to see KZSU's
antenna relocated from the roof
of Mem Aud to the foothills.
"Our ten-watt transmitter allows
us to reach people within a five to
seven mile radius of the campus.
If we move our antenna to the
foothills, our effective radiated
power would be increased to
thirty-six watts without having to
increase the wattage of the
transmitter."
Increase Power
This improved antenna
position would enable many
listeners over the mid-peninsula to
tune in KZSU, as they are
currently unable to do. Dave

would also like to have two new
studios, but this would require
$200,000 and a benefactor. But
KZSU's most immediate goal is to
gain an increase in effective
power.
"I absolutely feel that KZSU is
on its way up," Dave stated. "I
want to emphasize that we want,
need, and cultivate suggestions
from anyone about topics for our
public affairs programs, news
coverage, entertainment.
Dave came to Stanford from
Solano Junior College last fall and
was then named KZSU Sports
Director. Last spring he became
news director and in March was
elected station manager. He is a
communications major, and hopes
to work for KSFO after school.
"For me at KZSU," Dave
commented, "seeing things work
right brings great satisfaction."
KZSU broadcasts at 90.1 mcs
FM and at 88 0 kcs AM on
campus.
