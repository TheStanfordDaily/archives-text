I It all depends on I
YOU and Sly.
We're talking about the future of first class entertainment at
Stanford.
By first class, we mean people like Santana, The Moody Blues,
B Simon and Garfunkel . . . and Sly & The Family Stone. I
These groups cost a lot of bread and whether any more of
them come to our campus depends on the success of this Fri

I to blow it. Don't you. I
