# For Blacks, Chicanos, Indians
## Minority Housing Program Begun 
### 
Special housing arrangements for
three minority student groups are now
in effect for the first time in the
University's history, according to
Assistant Dean of Students Larry
Horton.
Horton, a faculty resident in Roble,
one of the houses involved in the
program, reports that reaction thus far
to the program has been favorable.
The concept of making specified
houses available for large
concentrations of black, Chicano and
Indian students was developed during
discussions held by the BSU and
MECHA last spring. The University
implimented the suggestion at the end
of Spring Quarter.
The idea for the special housing

arrangement was student initiated,
although Associate Dean of Students
Bill Leland, Assistant Dean Harold
Boyd, and former Assistant Dean Felix
Gutierrez were heavily involved.
According to Leland, the new
housing situation was created "to
provide an easier opportunity for
blacks and Chicanos to live in close
proximity to other blacks and Chicanos
in order to establish their own
identity."
Priorities
In the Spring housing draw, a
priority for up to 20 percent of the
upperclass spaces in Muir and Roble
was given to Chicanos. A similar
priority was given to black students in
Soto and Junipero. High priority for

minority freshman students was also
granted for the same houses, provided
that the freshmen involved wanted to
live there.
Planners for the freshman houses
had assigned Larken and Lassen to
Chicanos, Cedro to blacks, and Trancos
to Indians. Plans revolved around
experienced resident assistants who the
housing office believes are especially
equipped to handle the new situation.
Speaking about the situation of
Chicanos on campus, Gutierrez said,
"Difficulties in communication arise
from being scattered around the
campus." He noted that there were
some problems between roommates of
different races last year.
Transition Difficult
"It is a difficult transition coming
from a low-income family," he said.
"The Chicano students see the
material wealth of their white
roommates but not the feeling, not the
heart. The life styles are different."
Boyd spoke of the blacks'
involvement with the new housing
situation. He agreed that "there is a
need for development of social
cohesion and belonging.
"We must create an atmosphere
where blacks feel they belong and are
an integral part of the University," he
said.
Indians' Plan
Boyd and Gutierrez noted that no
minority group students were forced
into houses operating under the new
plan. Freshmen who are members of
one of the three minority groups
received information about the plan
during the summer.
The 2 2 Indians chose not to live
together in one house. Keating Rhodes,

who was in charge of assigning housing
to freshmen, said that "the Indians are
living in supportive groups of four or
five in Olivo, Rinconada, Madera and
Trancos."
He added that "concentration
housing wasn't popular with Chicano
freshmen, either, although we were able
to accommodate all those who wanted
the situation."
Low Chicano Response
Rhodes noted that a majority of the
black freshmen and about 20 percent
of the Chicano freshmen had requested
the new arrangement.
Horton said that half of the
freshman Chicano students did not
respond to the letter mailed to them
during the summer explaining the
special housing opportunity.
"There was much confusion over the
letter," he said. "The meaning of it was
unclear."
Cedro 4 0 Percent Black
Those who did not respond to the
letter went through the regular housing
procedures. According to Horton, the
result of the low Chicano response is
that Muir, Lark in and Lassen have not
achieved the expected concentration of
Chicano students. With the exception
of Roble, he said, the Chicanos are
living units similar to the plan adopted
by the Indians.
The heavy response from black
freshmen permitted Cedro to reach its
maximum concentration of 4 0 percent.
Soto and Junipero are between 20-25
percent black.
Leland expressed the hope that
minority students would not become
isolated or separated from other
students in their residences.
"That would certainly defeat our
purpose," he said.

from being scattered around the
campus." He noted that there were
some problems between roommates of
different races last year.
Transition Difficult
"It is a difficult transition coming
from a low-income family," he said.
"The Chicano students see the
material wealth of their white
roommates but not the feeling, not the
heart. The life styles are different."
Boyd spoke of the blacks'
involvement with the new housing
situation. He agreed that "there is a
need for development of social
cohesion and belonging.
"We must create an atmosphere
where blacks feel they belong and are
an integral part of the University," he
said.
Indians' Plan
Boyd and Gutierrez noted that no
minority group students were forced
into houses operating under the new
plan. Freshmen who are members of
one of the three minority groups
received information about the plan
during the summer.
The 2 2 Indians chose not to live
together in one house. Keating Rhodes,

who was in charge of assigning housing
to freshmen, said that "the Indians are
living in supportive groups of four or
five in Olivo, Rinconada, Madera and
Trancos."
He added that "concentration
housing wasn't popular with Chicano
freshmen, either, although we were able
to accommodate all those who wanted
the situation."
Low Chicano Response
Rhodes noted that a majority of the
black freshmen and about 20 percent
of the Chicano freshmen had requested
the new arrangement.
Horton said that half of the
freshman Chicano students did not
respond to the letter mailed to them
during the summer explaining the
special housing opportunity.
"There was much confusion over the
letter," he said. "The meaning of it was
unclear."
Cedro 4 0 Percent Black
Those who did not respond to the
letter went through the regular housing
procedures. According to Horton, the
result of the low Chicano response is
that Muir, Lark in and Lassen have not
achieved the expected concentration of
Chicano students. With the exception
of Roble, he said, the Chicanos are
living units similar to the plan adopted
by the Indians.
The heavy response from black
freshmen permitted Cedro to reach its
maximum concentration of 4 0 percent.
Soto and Junipero are between 20-25
percent black.
Leland expressed the hope that
minority students would not become
isolated or separated from other
students in their residences.
"That would certainly defeat our
purpose," he said.

SOTO HOUSE—One of the Wilbur houses, Soto's population is about 25 percent black this year as a result of a new housing
program designed to permit concentrations of minority group students. The program is intended to help black, Chicano and
Indian students "establish their own identity."
Special housing arrangements for
three minority student groups are now
in effect for the first time in the
University's history, according to
Assistant Dean of Students Larry
Horton.
Horton, a faculty resident in Roble,
one of the houses involved in the
program, reports that reaction thus far
to the program has been favorable.
The concept of making specified
houses available for large
concentrations of black, Chicano and
Indian students was developed during
discussions held by the BSU and
MECHA last spring. The University
implimented the suggestion at the end
of Spring Quarter.
The idea for the special housing

arrangement was student initiated,
although Associate Dean of Students
Bill Leland, Assistant Dean Harold
Boyd, and former Assistant Dean Felix
Gutierrez were heavily involved.
According to Leland, the new
housing situation was created "to
provide an easier opportunity for
blacks and Chicanos to live in close
proximity to other blacks and Chicanos
in order to establish their own
identity."
Priorities
In the Spring housing draw, a
priority for up to 20 percent of the
upperclass spaces in Muir and Roble
was given to Chicanos. A similar
priority was given to black students in
Soto and Junipero. High priority for

minority freshman students was also
granted for the same houses, provided
that the freshmen involved wanted to
live there.
Planners for the freshman houses
had assigned Larken and Lassen to
Chicanos, Cedro to blacks, and Trancos
to Indians. Plans revolved around
experienced resident assistants who the
housing office believes are especially
equipped to handle the new situation.
Speaking about the situation of
Chicanos on campus, Gutierrez said,
"Difficulties in communication arise
from being scattered around the
campus." He noted that there were
some problems between roommates of
different races last year.
Transition Difficult
"It is a difficult transition coming
from a low-income family," he said.

Cedro 4 0 Percent Black
Those who did not respond to the
letter went through the regular housing
procedures. According to Horton, the
result of the low Chicano response is
that Muir, Lark in and Lassen have not
achieved the expected concentration of
Chicano students. With the exception
of Roble, he said, the Chicanos are
living units similar to the plan adopted
by the Indians.
The heavy response from black
freshmen permitted Cedro to reach its
maximum concentration of 4 0 percent.
Soto and Junipero are between 20-25
percent black.
Leland expressed the hope that
minority students would not become
isolated or separated from other
students in their residences.
"That would certainly defeat our
purpose," he said.

SOTO HOUSE—One of the Wilbur houses, Soto's population is about 25 percent black this year as a result of a new housing
program designed to permit concentrations of minority group students. The program is intended to help black, Chicano and
Indian students "establish their own identity."
