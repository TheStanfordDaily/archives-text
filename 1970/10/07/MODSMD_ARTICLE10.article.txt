About a dozen spaces in Crothers,
Crothers Memorial, Hulme, and
McFarland have opened up for
graduate students. Due to the
difficulty of notifying people on the
waiting list, these spaces will be open
to any graduate students on a first
come first serve basis beginning at 8:00
a.m. on Wednesday, October 7.
