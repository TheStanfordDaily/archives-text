### 
Choreographer Shirley Allen and Producer Sandi Richards have
announced plans to form a black dance troupe which will present a
dance concert series early winter quarter. To be known as the "Black
Legacy Dancers," this company will feature several types of dancing:
primitive, party dances from the 1 920' sand '30's (like the jitterbug
and funkyhutt), and contemporary psychedelic.
All people interested in participating in this concert series either as
dancers or as members of the technical staff are invited to come to the
Women's Clubhouse today, between 7 and 10 p.m. for a short,
introductory session. Prospective dancers should wear leotards and
tights to this session, if possible.
Plans for the frosh sponsored BIG GAME BONFIRE are currently
being made. Interested freshmen should attend an organizational
meeting tomorrow at 8 p.m. 7:30 p.m. in TMU 27i. For further
information contact Kelly Cawley at 491 -3176, or Vol DanDalsemat
