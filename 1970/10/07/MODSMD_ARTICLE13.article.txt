# O'Casey Play Opens
## 
### NEIL ARNET 
This past Friday the Berkeley
Repertory Theatre opened its
season with Sean O'Casey's The
Plough and the Stars. It is a play
concerned with the Easter
Rebellion in Dublin in 1 91 6 . On a
larger plain, it is concerned with
all revolutions and their effects on
individuals. And, as director
Michael Leibert states in the
program, "This play doesn't really
take sides, except to question the
honesty and validity of all 'sides."
The story of the play revolves
ui'ound Jack and Nora Clitheroe.
.Jack is one of the revolutionary
leaders. Nora, his wife, wants Jack
not to listen to the call of the
rebellion, but rather to stay at
home with her. With the
exception of the narrator, Jack
and Nora remain the only major
characters involved in the
happenings of Dublin.

Nora's uncle, marvelously
played by Ron Vernan, is an old
man who had been in the army
when he was young and would
like to feel important again. His
friend Fluther Ciood is another
who likes to remember former
fighting days. Yet Flynn and
Good are simply onlookers. For
that matter so is Nora; however,
certainly by virtue of her
husband's involvement she too is
involved.
Another character who simply
watches the events is The Young
Covey, Nora's cousin, whose
concern is the labor movement.
The rebellion would be right if
only it were of and for the
workers. The gossiping Mrs.
Gogan (widowed soon after her
marriage), her sickly daughter
Mollser, the wise, drunken Bessie
Burgess, and the prostitute Rosie
Rcdmund round out the list of
revolution watchers.
Fine Points
There exist several unusual
touches which make The Plough
and the Stars an interesting play
to attend. For one, it employs a
narrator as the overall voice of the
revolution. And Thomas Lynch
does a fine job with the role. In
addition to the narrator, there is
the poet. When coupled, these
two remind one of a Greek
chorus. In fact, a chorus quite
literally, for they do sing.
Unfortunately, Robert Campbell
who plays the poet (and also the
bartender in one scene), lacks a
good voice. Actually there is quite
a bit of singing in the play, and
personally I could have lived
without most of it. Certainly, the
singing of the two British soldiers
who sing at the end could be done
away with.
Well, I notice I'm beginning to
sound down on the play, when in

reality I enjoyed it, particularly
the first act. Somehow I hadn't
expected Sean O'Casey to be
funny, especially in dealing with
revolution; yet, surprisingly The
Plough and the Stars had an
extremely funny first act.
Much of the humor grows out
of match ups of two characters at
a time—the old man, Peter Flynn
and The Young Covey who
continually baits the elder; Mrs.
Gogan and Bessie Burgess fighting
in a saloon; Fluther Good and The
Young Covey also at it in the
saloon, scrapping about the
prostitute Rosie.
Besides the fact that the lines
were funny, I feel all these
characters played their parts well.
As a consequence the first act
comes off quite successfully.
Sober Second Act
Somewhat less successful, but
still worth seeing is the second
act, which differs markedly from
the first. All the humor
disappears. The mood tightens.
The rebellion has reached the
innocent bystanders. And the
unspoken question at the play's
end is, "Well, what do you think?
Where would you have been?"
Now that I've had a few days
to think about the play, I must
admit that my overall opinion is a
positive one. True, there was too
much use of singing, especially in
light of the fact that some
members of the cast didn't sing
very well. But Sean O'Casey was
all there. And I want to
compliment the director on
restraining from slanting
O'Casey's intentions.
Go see the play. It isn't
brilliant, but it is certainly
competently handled by a good
director and a generally fine group
of actors. The play is running
through next month at the
Berkeley Repertory Theater, 298 0
College Ave., Berkeley.

Rcdmund round out the list of
revolution watchers.
Fine Points
There exist several unusual
touches which make The Plough
and the Stars an interesting play
to attend. For one, it employs a
narrator as the overall voice of the
revolution. And Thomas Lynch
does a fine job with the role. In
addition to the narrator, there is
the poet. When coupled, these
two remind one of a Greek
chorus. In fact, a chorus quite
literally, for they do sing.
Unfortunately, Robert Campbell
who plays the poet (and also the
bartender in one scene), lacks a
good voice. Actually there is quite
a bit of singing in the play, and
personally I could have lived
without most of it. Certainly, the
singing of the two British soldiers
who sing at the end could be done
away with.
Well, I notice I'm beginning to
sound down on the play, when in

reality I enjoyed it, particularly
the first act. Somehow I hadn't
expected Sean O'Casey to be
funny, especially in dealing with
revolution; yet, surprisingly The
Plough and the Stars had an
extremely funny first act.
Much of the humor grows out
of match ups of two characters at
a time—the old man, Peter Flynn
and The Young Covey who
continually baits the elder; Mrs.
Gogan and Bessie Burgess fighting
in a saloon; Fluther Good and The
Young Covey also at it in the
saloon, scrapping about the
prostitute Rosie.
Besides the fact that the lines
were funny, I feel all these
characters played their parts well.
As a consequence the first act
comes off quite successfully.
Sober Second Act
Somewhat less successful, but
still worth seeing is the second
act, which differs markedly from
the first. All the humor
disappears. The mood tightens.
The rebellion has reached the
innocent bystanders. And the
unspoken question at the play's
end is, "Well, what do you think?
Where would you have been?"
Now that I've had a few days
to think about the play, I must
admit that my overall opinion is a
positive one. True, there was too
much use of singing, especially in
light of the fact that some
members of the cast didn't sing
very well. But Sean O'Casey was
all there. And I want to
compliment the director on
restraining from slanting
O'Casey's intentions.
Go see the play. It isn't
brilliant, but it is certainly
competently handled by a good
director and a generally fine group
of actors. The play is running
through next month at the
Berkeley Repertory Theater, 298 0
College Ave., Berkeley.
This past Friday the Berkeley
Repertory Theatre opened its
season with Sean O'Casey's The
Plough and the Stars. It is a play
concerned with the Easter
Rebellion in Dublin in 1 91 6 . On a
larger plain, it is concerned with
all revolutions and their effects on
individuals. And, as director
Michael Leibert states in the
program, "This play doesn't really
take sides, except to question the
honesty and validity of all 'sides."
The story of the play revolves
ui'ound Jack and Nora Clitheroe.
.Jack is one of the revolutionary
leaders. Nora, his wife, wants Jack
not to listen to the call of the
rebellion, but rather to stay at
home with her. With the
exception of the narrator, Jack
and Nora remain the only major
characters involved in the
happenings of Dublin.

Nora's uncle, marvelously
played by Ron Vernan, is an old
man who had been in the army
when he was young and would
like to feel important again. His
friend Fluther Ciood is another
who likes to remember former
fighting days. Yet Flynn and
Good are simply onlookers. For
that matter so is Nora; however,
certainly by virtue of her
husband's involvement she too is
involved.
Another character who simply
watches the events is The Young
Covey, Nora's cousin, whose
concern is the labor movement.
The rebellion would be right if
only it were of and for the
workers. The gossiping Mrs.
Gogan (widowed soon after her
marriage), her sickly daughter
Mollser, the wise, drunken Bessie
Burgess, and the prostitute Rosie
Rcdmund round out the list of
revolution watchers.

act, which differs markedly from
the first. All the humor
disappears. The mood tightens.
The rebellion has reached the
innocent bystanders. And the
unspoken question at the play's
end is, "Well, what do you think?
Where would you have been?"
Now that I've had a few days
to think about the play, I must
admit that my overall opinion is a
positive one. True, there was too
much use of singing, especially in
light of the fact that some
members of the cast didn't sing
very well. But Sean O'Casey was
all there. And I want to
compliment the director on
restraining from slanting
O'Casey's intentions.
Go see the play. It isn't
brilliant, but it is certainly
competently handled by a good
director and a generally fine group
of actors. The play is running
through next month at the
Berkeley Repertory Theater, 298 0
College Ave., Berkeley.
