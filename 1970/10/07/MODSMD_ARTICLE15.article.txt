# Romeros’ Guitars In Series Debut
## 
### DAVID L. GLASS 
First-night concertgoers to
"The Arts at Stanford" series
were treated to a brilliant and
unusual performance by Spain's
guitar-playing Romero family
Friday night in Memorial
Auditorium. Drawing from their
richly-varied repertoire of
classical, contemporary and
traditional Spanish guitar
literature, the Romeros gave
ample demonstration of why they
are known as "the first family of
the guitar."
The program, comprising some
fourteen individual selections, was
structured to demonstrate the
prodigious ability of each member
of the group—the father,
Celedonio, and his three sons
Celin, Pepe, and Angel—individ
ually and in various pairings, as
well as the superb balance and
empathy of the group as a whole.
Commencing with Vivaldi's
graceful A major quartet as an
introduction to the ensemble, the
concert progressed to works by
Frescobaldi, Paganini, the
contemporary Brazilian composer
Villa-Lobos, and John Dowling,
an English composer of the
Elizabethan period. However, the
bulk of the program was devoted
to the Spanish literature—Sor,
Albeniz, de Medina, Breton, Ibert,
Granados, Torroba, and
traditional Flamenco
improvisations.
It is with the Spanish literature
that the four are really most at
home, and they brought to it a
variety and interest this reviewer
had never imagined possible, as
the music tends to be
rhythmically redundant and
harmonically banal. However, the
Romeros use the formal structure
of the music merely as foundation

for their own highly polished, and
often subtle, interpretive skill.
The mastery of their technique
allowed for a broad range of
coloristic and expressive devices,
including an astonishing variety of
percussive effects obtained by
striking the strings or the body of
the instrument with the hand.
The program's highlight for
this reviewer was a playing by the
father, Celedonio, of two pieces
of his own composition,
Zapateado and Fantasia. In the
former, he weaved two rapid and
complex harmonic figures into
delicate contrapuntal melodic
lines of breathtaking
beauty—among the most
expressive guitar-playing I've ever
heard. While the sons may have a
more dynamically exuberant
style, their father's musicianship
remains as a goal for them to
shoot for.
The enthusiastic audience was
treated to only one encore-an
arrangement of Melaguena by
Celedonio that featured
one-handed playing by Pepe and
Angel, as, perhaps, the final bit of
showmanship in their bag of
tricks. The group then excused
themselves to fly to Los Angeles
for a concert-otherwise, they
might still be playing encores.
Remaining programs in "The
Arts at Stanford" series this
quarter include the Guarneri
string quartet—possibly the
world's finest—as well as the First
Chamber Dance Company and the
mixed-media New York Rock and
Roll Ensemble. The next program,
on Friday, Oct. 16, will be a
recital by the outstanding young
cellist Joel Krosnick, accompanied
by Charles Wuorinen, 1970's
recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for
music composition.
