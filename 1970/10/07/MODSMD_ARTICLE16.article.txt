# S.F. Opera Season Features 'Carmen'
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
To borrow a bon mot from the
American ambassador to the Paris
peace talks, this year's Carmen
gives us old wine in a new bottle.
The novelty is the American
debut of a major new Carmen; the
remnant from the past is the 1959
production, which is colorful
though occasionally wrongheaded.
Still, this Carmen is a lively,
densely populated, and skillfully
directed revival worthy of the
phrase grand opera.
Carmen's personality is like
Hamlet's: many versions are
possible and many other
outrageous versions have been
attempted. Whether Carmen will
ever be sung by a man (Dame
Judith Anderson is currently
acting Hamlet in San Francisco) is
a matter for melancholy
rumination. At any rate, to each
his own Carmen.
Who will be pleased by Brigitte
Fassbaender's Carmen must
remain for now an open question,
for she still lacks a complete and
coherent approach to the
character. She fails in particular to
focus her intentions in Act IV. I
happen to believe that Carmen's
death is a matter of suicide rather
than murder (1 concede there is
leeway on this point) and that the
fascination of her character lies in
a morbid vis inertiae. In Act IV
Fassbaender made it seem as if she
were waiting for an errant taxi
rather than her doom.
Still, Fassbaender's debut was
promising; she has everything
necessary for an historic Carmen
except experience- a strong,
luscious voice (especially in
mid-range), striking beauty,
agility, and engrossing stage
presence.
Guy Chauvet's Don .lose was
vigorously and smartly sung. His
voice has the thin, silvery

resonance so often met among
French tenors, and this proved
congenial to the Bizet vocal line.
This may also explain his relative
unsuccess last year in Aida.
Chauvet is also fully capable of a
thrilling release of energy at the
top of his range. His acting, on the
other hand, showed that the
operatic tradition that tenors are
deities and may not be hampered
by mere mortal stage directors
still holds true.
The exquisite insipidity of
Micaela's part is not conducive to
excitement, and Jane Marsh made
no attempt to buck the odds
against her. The spectre of vibrato
lingers in her voice and it becomes
less pleasing as it climbs the staff.
This led to an uncomfortable
impression that she was
negotiating rather than singing her
two arias.
Jose Van Dam was the ultimate
in masculine potency as the
bullfighter, and he spared nothing
of his booming baritone in the
Toreador Song. The quartet of
smugglers gave a highly polished
effort which even stood out in a
generally superb instance of stage
direction (Lofti Mansouri's). This
Carmen also permits occasion to
note the S.F. Opera Chorus is still
in the ascendant and has never in
this writer's memory sounded
better. The Boys' Chorus in Act I
was a delight.
The production itself is clever
and effective in some ways (the
Inn scene comes to mind), but
stylization is occasionally allowed
to subvert laws of physics and
perspective to ill effect. Why the
designer allowed what is
apparently a massive Roman ruin
to dominate Act IV, which takes
place outside the Seville bullring,
is unclear.
Carmen will be repeated on
October 3, 6, 11, 16 and
Thanksgiving Day.

happen to believe that Carmen's
death is a matter of suicide rather
than murder (1 concede there is
leeway on this point) and that the
fascination of her character lies in
a morbid vis inertiae. In Act IV
Fassbaender made it seem as if she
were waiting for an errant taxi
rather than her doom.
Still, Fassbaender's debut was
promising; she has everything
necessary for an historic Carmen
except experience- a strong,
luscious voice (especially in
mid-range), striking beauty,
agility, and engrossing stage
presence.
Guy Chauvet's Don .lose was
vigorously and smartly sung. His
voice has the thin, silvery

resonance so often met among
French tenors, and this proved
congenial to the Bizet vocal line.
This may also explain his relative
unsuccess last year in Aida.
Chauvet is also fully capable of a
thrilling release of energy at the
top of his range. His acting, on the
other hand, showed that the
operatic tradition that tenors are
deities and may not be hampered
by mere mortal stage directors
still holds true.
The exquisite insipidity of
Micaela's part is not conducive to
excitement, and Jane Marsh made
no attempt to buck the odds
against her. The spectre of vibrato
lingers in her voice and it becomes
less pleasing as it climbs the staff.
This led to an uncomfortable
impression that she was
negotiating rather than singing her
two arias.
Jose Van Dam was the ultimate
in masculine potency as the
bullfighter, and he spared nothing
of his booming baritone in the
Toreador Song. The quartet of
smugglers gave a highly polished
effort which even stood out in a
generally superb instance of stage
direction (Lofti Mansouri's). This
Carmen also permits occasion to
note the S.F. Opera Chorus is still
in the ascendant and has never in
this writer's memory sounded
better. The Boys' Chorus in Act I
was a delight.
The production itself is clever
and effective in some ways (the
Inn scene comes to mind), but
stylization is occasionally allowed
to subvert laws of physics and
perspective to ill effect. Why the
designer allowed what is
apparently a massive Roman ruin
to dominate Act IV, which takes
place outside the Seville bullring,
is unclear.
Carmen will be repeated on
October 3, 6, 11, 16 and
Thanksgiving Day.
To borrow a bon mot from the
American ambassador to the Paris
peace talks, this year's Carmen
gives us old wine in a new bottle.
The novelty is the American
debut of a major new Carmen; the
remnant from the past is the 1959
production, which is colorful
though occasionally wrongheaded.
Still, this Carmen is a lively,
densely populated, and skillfully
directed revival worthy of the
phrase grand opera.
Carmen's personality is like
Hamlet's: many versions are
possible and many other
outrageous versions have been
attempted. Whether Carmen will
ever be sung by a man (Dame
Judith Anderson is currently
acting Hamlet in San Francisco) is
a matter for melancholy
rumination. At any rate, to each
his own Carmen.
Who will be pleased by Brigitte
Fassbaender's Carmen must
remain for now an open question,
for she still lacks a complete and
coherent approach to the
character. She fails in particular to
focus her intentions in Act IV. I
