AERIAL ACESâ€”Bob Moore (86), left, and Randy Vataha (18),
below, have been Stanford's primary pass receivers after four games.
Vataha, with 1 5 receptions and three touchdowns, is fifth in the Pac-8
in catches while tight end Moore is tied for ninth in the league with 12
receptions and 218 yards. USC has been averaging 111 yards more
yards total offense than Stanford, but the Indians are averaging 85
more yards a game passing than USC, in case you were wondering.
