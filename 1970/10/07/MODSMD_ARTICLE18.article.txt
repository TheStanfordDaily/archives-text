# Cards Drop To 12th
## 
### 
A lot of people thought it
would be worse.
Stanford's football loss to
Purdue last week dropped the
Indians to 12 th place in both
national polls. Last week they
were third in one, fifth in the
other.
USC is ranked fourth in both,
but Stanford Coach John Ralston,
who votes on the UPI board of
coaches, said he listed the Trojans
as number one.
Ohio State, Texas, Notre Dame
and USC were the top four
choices in both the AP and UPI
compilations.
Arkansas, Stanford fans will be
interested to note, crept up to
tenth.
In other exciting midweek
developments USC Coach John
McKay said, "Stanford is better
than last year." He also said, "We
are better this year, particularly
on offense."
"We'll play them pretty much
the same this year as we did last
year," he told a conglomeration
of sportswriters. Gambling experts
favor the Troians by four in
Saturday's game with Stanford.
The Indians go through a
second round of heavy drills

today before tapering off in
preparation for the Trojans.
Monday's workout featured
offensive and defensive practice
and special work on the kicking
game.
In Pacific-8 statistics released
Tuesday, Jim Plunkett leads the
league in passing and total offense
and Hillary Shockley continues to
lead in scoring.
Plunkett has 108 0 total yards
in four games for a 270 average.
UCLA's Dennis Dummit is second
with 8 38 total yards and a 109 i
average.
The Stanford ace has passed
for 101 4 yards to lead the passing
department, although his
completion percentage has slipped
to .507 . He also has the most pass
attempts, completions and
interceptions.
USC's Jimmy Jones, who has
the tendency to be the most
dangerous in tight situations, is
sixth in passing with a 163 yard
average.
Shockley, with 30 points on
five touchdowns, still leads in
scoring, but USC place kicker Ron
Ayala has crept within two.
Shockley and Jackie Brown are
eight and nine in league rushing

with 249 and 240 yards. Randy
Vataha is fifth in pass receptions
with 15 and Eric Cross is tied for
second in punt returns with an 11
yard average.
In team statistics Stanford is
third in total offense behind USC
and (surprise!) Washington State.
USC also leads in total defense,
allowing 260 yards per game;
Stanford is fourth, giving-up 288.
The Indians are second in
passing offense and third in
passing defense.
USC leads the league in rushing
offense while Stanford is nonth,
only ahead of Oregon. The
Trojans have been running 34 3
yards a game and the Tribe,
fourth in rushing defense, have
been giving up 155 .
