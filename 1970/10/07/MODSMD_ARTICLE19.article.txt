Pasted at an angle above the adhesive strip marked "Plunkett" on
the metal locker is the usual red and white "BEAT SC" sticker.
"How long has that been there?" one of the hangers-on asked after
last week's game.
"Since I've been here," was the reply.
Stanford, which hasn't beaten USC since 1957 , has lost its last two
games to the Trojans by a combined 5 3-48 score.
A year ago Steve Horowitz had seemingly won a miraculous victory
with a 37 yard field goal with 63 seconds left, but a field goal by Ron
Ayala with no seconds left gave an even more miraculous victory to
USC.
Two years ago, any one of three errant field goals would have made
a tie, two a victory.
The teams meet again Saturday with many authorities agreeing that
the Rose Bowl goes to the winner.
No Sale
USC Coach John McKay doesn't buy that. With UCLA, Stanford,
Washington and USC all unbeaten in conference play he says one
game won't decide the Rose Bowl representative.
It's obvious, however, that Saturday's loser has even less chance
than Saturday's winner, and if the game doesn't decide who does go
to the Rose Bowl, it probably will decide who doesn't.
Stanford's loss to Purdue has already eliminated the local squad
from one post-season spectacular. If you believe a letter posted on the
training quarters bulletin board addressed to "Bill Plunkett and his
Teammates", a Kansas liquor merchant who was decidedly impressed
with Stanford's showing in the television game with Arkansas said he
would send the team "a gallon of the best rot gut anywhere' if the
Cards went through the season undefeated.
What's Left?
The team, alas, will have to settle for only the Rose Bowl—if
anything.
The key to Stanford's play Saturday may well be the team's
response to adversity, and that is difficult to predict.
Against Arkansas maybe Stanford was just lucky. Maybe not.
Against Oregon, after being shut out in the first half for the first
time in nearly two years, the club stormed back with 3 3 points in 16
minutes.
Against Purdue, after being shut out in the first half for the first
time in exactly a week, the club stormed back with a touchdown, a
fumble and an interception.
Having played in close games this year and last has acclimated the
Indians to pressure. Our quarterback is not the type who gets roiled
when he makes mistakes or gets behind; the receivers and running
backs are all competent and mature.
Watch the Spirits
The Purdue debacle does not seem to have had lasting negative
effects. Monday's workout, according to John Ralston was "a very
spirited as well as worthwhile drill," and the enthusiasm of the session
seemed legitimate and unforced to a casual observer.
But then there's USC, which has been among the nation's top ten
teams in seven of the past ten years, who scored last minute wins last
year over Stanford, California, and UCLA, and whose
quarterback—Jimmy Jones—never seems to run his team better than
when he's down a few points with less than four minutes left.
"Against USC you play on emotion, guts and whatever else is
available," Jim Plunkett said Saturday.
With all those variables, any attempt at a prediction will be as futile
as the attempt here, and all a viewer can expect in advance is that his
Saturday afternoon will probably be emotional experience of some
