# Invitational
## Runners Off To Sacto 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Senior Don Kardong and
juniors Arvid Kretz and Robert
Coe will lead Stanford's varisty
cross country squad into the
Sacramento Invitational meet this
Saturday after defeating their
teammates in the team time trials
last weekend.
Coach Marshall Clark's three
top runners completed the 4.2
mile course in identical times of
2 0:4 0.4 , an eight second
improvement over their times of
last year. Kardong, Coe and Kretz
provide Clark with a solid nucleus
that will possibly be able to
dominate Stanford's dual meets.
In order to place well as a team
in large meets, though, the Indians
will have to display more depth
than they showed in the time
trials on the Stanford golf course.
The gap between the seventh
man and the first place trio last
Saturday was 4 2 seconds. Coach
Clark expressed concern over his
squads apparent lack of depth,
and announced that he would put
the team through speed drills in
order to bring the times of the top
seven men together.
Bernie Lahde, a junior who has
just returned from Europe, proved
to be the major surprise of the
time trials, placing fourth with a
time of 21 :05. Two sophomores,
Brian Mittelstaedt and Rick
Geisler, followed Lahde and will

run in the fifth and sixth positions
for Stanford at Sacramento.
Senior Duncan Macdonald came
with a 21:23 clocking to earn the
last place on the varsity "A"
team.
Three freshmen, Neil
Bernstein, Peter Fitzmaurice, and
Dan Cautley, placed in the top
fourteen, but will run on a special
freshman team for the
Sacramento meet instead of on
the "B" squad. Coach Clark was
pleased with their showing,
however, and they should be great
assets to future Indian teams.
USC and UCLA will not
compete in the Invitational this
weekend, but San Diego State is
going to run, and Clark expects
them to give his team the stiffest

challenge. "They have always
been a difficult team for us to
beat, and they already have
notched an impressive victory this
season with a first in a triangular
meet over Brigham Young and the
Pacific Coast Track Club."
California, San Jose State,
California State at Fullerton, and
Chico State are also planning to
compete at Sacramento. San Jose
State is not a threat this year, but
Chico State could pull an upset.
"Chico State defeated Oregon
State in an invitational meet
earlier this year", Clark
commented," and they could
surprise and take the meet."
Stanford's harriers will return
from the Sacramento Invitational
to face U' C San Jose State in
a home nr ctober 17th.

beat, and they already have
notched an impressive victory this
season with a first in a triangular
meet over Brigham Young and the
Pacific Coast Track Club."
California, San Jose State,
California State at Fullerton, and
Chico State are also planning to
compete at Sacramento. San Jose
State is not a threat this year, but
Chico State could pull an upset.
"Chico State defeated Oregon
State in an invitational meet
earlier this year", Clark
commented," and they could
surprise and take the meet."
Stanford's harriers will return
from the Sacramento Invitational
to face U' C San Jose State in
a home nr ctober 17th.
Senior Don Kardong and
juniors Arvid Kretz and Robert
Coe will lead Stanford's varisty
cross country squad into the
Sacramento Invitational meet this
Saturday after defeating their
teammates in the team time trials
last weekend.
Coach Marshall Clark's three
top runners completed the 4.2
mile course in identical times of
2 0:4 0.4 , an eight second
improvement over their times of
last year. Kardong, Coe and Kretz
provide Clark with a solid nucleus
that will possibly be able to
dominate Stanford's dual meets.
In order to place well as a team
in large meets, though, the Indians
will have to display more depth
than they showed in the time
trials on the Stanford golf course.
The gap between the seventh
man and the first place trio last
Saturday was 4 2 seconds. Coach
Clark expressed concern over his
squads apparent lack of depth,
and announced that he would put
the team through speed drills in
order to bring the times of the top
seven men together.
Bernie Lahde, a junior who has
just returned from Europe, proved
to be the major surprise of the
time trials, placing fourth with a
time of 21 :05. Two sophomores,
Brian Mittelstaedt and Rick
Geisler, followed Lahde and will

run in the fifth and sixth positions
for Stanford at Sacramento.
Senior Duncan Macdonald came
with a 21:23 clocking to earn the
last place on the varsity "A"
team.
Three freshmen, Neil
Bernstein, Peter Fitzmaurice, and
Dan Cautley, placed in the top
fourteen, but will run on a special
freshman team for the
Sacramento meet instead of on
the "B" squad. Coach Clark was
pleased with their showing,
however, and they should be great
assets to future Indian teams.
USC and UCLA will not
compete in the Invitational this
weekend, but San Diego State is
going to run, and Clark expects
them to give his team the stiffest

challenge. "They have always
been a difficult team for us to
beat, and they already have
notched an impressive victory this
season with a first in a triangular
meet over Brigham Young and the
Pacific Coast Track Club."
