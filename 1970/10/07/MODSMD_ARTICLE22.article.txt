Civil War In Bolivia
I.A PAZ, Bolivia ~ Civil war broke out be tween leftist and
rightist military forces Tuesday in Bolivia where Latin
America's master insurrectionist, Ernesto "Che" Guevara,
was slain three years ago.
Leftists bombed the presidential palace and talked
armed forces headquarters with machinegun fire. The
battle was triggered by the resignation of leftist President
Alfredo Ovando Candia.
The air force, supporting leftist Gen. Juan Jose Torres,
launched six planes in a 15 minute attack on the
presidential palace, and the small military garrison
occupying it replied with antiaircraft fire.
Rightist Gen. Rogelio Miranda, who led the revolt
against Ovando on Sunday, arrived at the palace after the
attack and castigated Ovando for "permitting extremism."
He denounced recent guerrilla activity in the northeast
which all but ceased after Bolivian troops killed Guevara in
October 1 967 and pledged to put it down. Guevara, Fidel
Castro's right hand man in the Cuban revolution, had
embarked on a campaign of revolutionizing Latin America.
Ceasefire Extension Possible
CAIRO — Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad of Egypt
expressed willingness Tuesday to extend the Middle East
cease fire by 9 0 days after it expires Nov. 5, but he ruled
out any withdrawal of missiles from the Suez Canal Truce
zone as the United States and Israel demand.
At the same time, Egypt's ruling Arab Socialist Union
party declared that the struggle against Israel "must be
escalated in all fields" and called for a strengthening of
relations with the Soviet Union. The party met in Cairo
and unanimously endorsed the nomination of Anwar Sadat
as FJgypt's next president. He will be sworn in Oct. 17 after
a national "yes" or "no" referendum.
In Tel Aviv, Israeli officials said Riad's ruling out of
missile withdrawals from the truce zone "does not augur
very well" and that the television statement in which Riad
made the announcement was "the first shot" fired since
the death of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
In New York, the United States told the other three big
powers at the United Nations it is pointless to talk about
guidelines for a Middle East peace until Egypt pulls back
the antiaircraft missiles.
Non-Lethal Weapons Sought
COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Ohio National Guard, criticized
by a presidential commission in connection with the
shooting deaths of four Kent State University students, has
asked for nonlethal weapons for use in future disorders.
But the Guard plans to continue to carry rifles and load
them on command.

Ohio Adj. Gen. Sylvester T. Del Corso, commander of
the Ohio Guard, said Tuesday Guardsmen will continue
the policy "to have ammunition with them when called
out and will load their weapons on command of an
officer."
"We do not want to kill anyone, or even injure anyone.
But the trouble is there when we are called out, and we
have to be prepared to do our job."
Integration Not Compulsory
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration told the
Supreme Court Tuesday the Constitution does not give
black children an absolute right to attend integrated public
schools.
Southern school districts can meet their legal
obligations to these children without racially balancing all
schools in the district and without integrating all of them,
the administration said in a friend-of-court brief.
Moreover, the administration argued, school boards are
tree to take into account the benefits to be derived from
preserving the traditional neighborhood method of school
assignment."
At the same time, the administration accused the school
boards in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, N.C., and in
Mobile County, Ala., of trying to maintain segregated
school systems. The government said desegregation could
be accomplished in a variety of ways without racial
balancing.
Next week the court hears oral argument on school
desegregation methods in these districts and in Clarke
County, Ga. The administration's brief, signed by Solicitor
General Erwin N. Griswold and by Jerris Loenard, an
assistant attorney general, represents the executive
branch's position.
Unruh Non-Committal
SACRAMENTO Democrat Jess Unruh took a
noncommital stance Tuesday when asked to comment on
charges by his running mate that Gov. Reagan was
planning to resign after re-election and be appointed to the
U.S. Senate.
The charge was made last week by Sen. Alfred E.
Alquist, D-San Jose, Democratic candidate for lieutenant
governor. Alquist said Sen. George Murphy, a longtime
Reagan friend, planned to resign shortly after winning
re-election, thus creating a vacancy in California's U.S.
Senate delegation.
Reagan would then also resign, moving Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke into the governor's chair, Alquist said, and
Reinecke would appoint Reagan to Murphy's vacated
Senate seat.
Both Murphy and Reagan have scoffed at the report.
Unruh said he would not repudiate anything said by
Alquist.

noncommital stance Tuesday when asked to comment on
charges by his running mate that Gov. Reagan was
planning to resign after re-election and be appointed to the
U.S. Senate.
The charge was made last week by Sen. Alfred E.
Alquist, D-San Jose, Democratic candidate for lieutenant
governor. Alquist said Sen. George Murphy, a longtime
Reagan friend, planned to resign shortly after winning
re-election, thus creating a vacancy in California's U.S.
Senate delegation.
Reagan would then also resign, moving Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke into the governor's chair, Alquist said, and
Reinecke would appoint Reagan to Murphy's vacated
Senate seat.
Both Murphy and Reagan have scoffed at the report.
Unruh said he would not repudiate anything said by
Alquist.
Civil War In Bolivia
I.A PAZ, Bolivia ~ Civil war broke out be tween leftist and
rightist military forces Tuesday in Bolivia where Latin
America's master insurrectionist, Ernesto "Che" Guevara,
was slain three years ago.
Leftists bombed the presidential palace and talked
armed forces headquarters with machinegun fire. The
battle was triggered by the resignation of leftist President
Alfredo Ovando Candia.
The air force, supporting leftist Gen. Juan Jose Torres,
launched six planes in a 15 minute attack on the
presidential palace, and the small military garrison
occupying it replied with antiaircraft fire.
Rightist Gen. Rogelio Miranda, who led the revolt
against Ovando on Sunday, arrived at the palace after the
attack and castigated Ovando for "permitting extremism."
He denounced recent guerrilla activity in the northeast
which all but ceased after Bolivian troops killed Guevara in
October 1 967 and pledged to put it down. Guevara, Fidel
Castro's right hand man in the Cuban revolution, had
embarked on a campaign of revolutionizing Latin America.
Ceasefire Extension Possible
CAIRO — Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad of Egypt
expressed willingness Tuesday to extend the Middle East
cease fire by 9 0 days after it expires Nov. 5, but he ruled
out any withdrawal of missiles from the Suez Canal Truce
zone as the United States and Israel demand.
At the same time, Egypt's ruling Arab Socialist Union
party declared that the struggle against Israel "must be
escalated in all fields" and called for a strengthening of
relations with the Soviet Union. The party met in Cairo
and unanimously endorsed the nomination of Anwar Sadat
as FJgypt's next president. He will be sworn in Oct. 17 after
a national "yes" or "no" referendum.
In Tel Aviv, Israeli officials said Riad's ruling out of
missile withdrawals from the truce zone "does not augur
very well" and that the television statement in which Riad
made the announcement was "the first shot" fired since
the death of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
In New York, the United States told the other three big
powers at the United Nations it is pointless to talk about
guidelines for a Middle East peace until Egypt pulls back
the antiaircraft missiles.
Non-Lethal Weapons Sought
COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Ohio National Guard, criticized
by a presidential commission in connection with the
shooting deaths of four Kent State University students, has
asked for nonlethal weapons for use in future disorders.
But the Guard plans to continue to carry rifles and load
them on command.

Ohio Adj. Gen. Sylvester T. Del Corso, commander of
the Ohio Guard, said Tuesday Guardsmen will continue
the policy "to have ammunition with them when called
out and will load their weapons on command of an
officer."
"We do not want to kill anyone, or even injure anyone.
But the trouble is there when we are called out, and we
have to be prepared to do our job."
Integration Not Compulsory
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration told the
Supreme Court Tuesday the Constitution does not give
black children an absolute right to attend integrated public
schools.
Southern school districts can meet their legal
obligations to these children without racially balancing all
schools in the district and without integrating all of them,
the administration said in a friend-of-court brief.
Moreover, the administration argued, school boards are
tree to take into account the benefits to be derived from
preserving the traditional neighborhood method of school
assignment."
At the same time, the administration accused the school
boards in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, N.C., and in
Mobile County, Ala., of trying to maintain segregated
school systems. The government said desegregation could
be accomplished in a variety of ways without racial
balancing.
Next week the court hears oral argument on school
desegregation methods in these districts and in Clarke
County, Ga. The administration's brief, signed by Solicitor
General Erwin N. Griswold and by Jerris Loenard, an
assistant attorney general, represents the executive
branch's position.

Moreover, the administration argued, school boards are
tree to take into account the benefits to be derived from
preserving the traditional neighborhood method of school
assignment."
At the same time, the administration accused the school
boards in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, N.C., and in
Mobile County, Ala., of trying to maintain segregated
school systems. The government said desegregation could
be accomplished in a variety of ways without racial
balancing.
Next week the court hears oral argument on school
desegregation methods in these districts and in Clarke
County, Ga. The administration's brief, signed by Solicitor
General Erwin N. Griswold and by Jerris Loenard, an
assistant attorney general, represents the executive
branch's position.
Unruh Non-Committal
SACRAMENTO Democrat Jess Unruh took a
noncommital stance Tuesday when asked to comment on
charges by his running mate that Gov. Reagan was
planning to resign after re-election and be appointed to the
U.S. Senate.
The charge was made last week by Sen. Alfred E.
Alquist, D-San Jose, Democratic candidate for lieutenant
governor. Alquist said Sen. George Murphy, a longtime
Reagan friend, planned to resign shortly after winning
re-election, thus creating a vacancy in California's U.S.
Senate delegation.
Reagan would then also resign, moving Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke into the governor's chair, Alquist said, and
Reinecke would appoint Reagan to Murphy's vacated
Senate seat.
Both Murphy and Reagan have scoffed at the report.
Unruh said he would not repudiate anything said by
Alquist.
Civil War In Bolivia
I.A PAZ, Bolivia ~ Civil war broke out be tween leftist and
rightist military forces Tuesday in Bolivia where Latin
America's master insurrectionist, Ernesto "Che" Guevara,
was slain three years ago.
Leftists bombed the presidential palace and talked
armed forces headquarters with machinegun fire. The
battle was triggered by the resignation of leftist President
Alfredo Ovando Candia.
The air force, supporting leftist Gen. Juan Jose Torres,
launched six planes in a 15 minute attack on the
presidential palace, and the small military garrison
occupying it replied with antiaircraft fire.
Rightist Gen. Rogelio Miranda, who led the revolt
against Ovando on Sunday, arrived at the palace after the
attack and castigated Ovando for "permitting extremism."
He denounced recent guerrilla activity in the northeast
which all but ceased after Bolivian troops killed Guevara in
October 1 967 and pledged to put it down. Guevara, Fidel
Castro's right hand man in the Cuban revolution, had
embarked on a campaign of revolutionizing Latin America.
Ceasefire Extension Possible
CAIRO — Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad of Egypt
expressed willingness Tuesday to extend the Middle East
cease fire by 9 0 days after it expires Nov. 5, but he ruled
out any withdrawal of missiles from the Suez Canal Truce
zone as the United States and Israel demand.
At the same time, Egypt's ruling Arab Socialist Union
party declared that the struggle against Israel "must be
escalated in all fields" and called for a strengthening of
relations with the Soviet Union. The party met in Cairo
and unanimously endorsed the nomination of Anwar Sadat
as FJgypt's next president. He will be sworn in Oct. 17 after
a national "yes" or "no" referendum.
In Tel Aviv, Israeli officials said Riad's ruling out of
missile withdrawals from the truce zone "does not augur
very well" and that the television statement in which Riad
made the announcement was "the first shot" fired since
the death of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
In New York, the United States told the other three big
powers at the United Nations it is pointless to talk about
guidelines for a Middle East peace until Egypt pulls back
the antiaircraft missiles.
Non-Lethal Weapons Sought
COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Ohio National Guard, criticized
by a presidential commission in connection with the
shooting deaths of four Kent State University students, has
asked for nonlethal weapons for use in future disorders.
But the Guard plans to continue to carry rifles and load
them on command.

Ohio Adj. Gen. Sylvester T. Del Corso, commander of
the Ohio Guard, said Tuesday Guardsmen will continue
the policy "to have ammunition with them when called
out and will load their weapons on command of an
officer."
"We do not want to kill anyone, or even injure anyone.
But the trouble is there when we are called out, and we
have to be prepared to do our job."
Integration Not Compulsory
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration told the
Supreme Court Tuesday the Constitution does not give
black children an absolute right to attend integrated public
schools.
Southern school districts can meet their legal
obligations to these children without racially balancing all
schools in the district and without integrating all of them,
the administration said in a friend-of-court brief.
Moreover, the administration argued, school boards are
tree to take into account the benefits to be derived from
preserving the traditional neighborhood method of school
assignment."
At the same time, the administration accused the school
boards in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, N.C., and in
Mobile County, Ala., of trying to maintain segregated
