# Bankrupt Fraternities Face Possible Closure
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Fraternities and other independent
living groups may be closed down if
they fall too far behind in debt,
according to Alan Cummings, Resident
Manager of Housing.
The steadily weakening financial
situation of some of the groups and the
serious squeeze on the University's
financial resources will force
administrators to take a tough stance
on bill collecting.
Cummings explained, "All the
independent houses at Stanford must
break even starting this fall. The
University cannot allow houses to
continue if they are not able to operate
on a sound financial basis."
If any housing group runs up a larger
debt that it did last spring, Cummings
said, "We will immediately talk to the
house leaders, and if we see that there
is no way that the house could or
would operate on a break even basis we
would withdraw our support of that
living group." The withdrawal of
University support from one of the 2 4
independently-run houses would mean
an end for that living group since the
University owns all of the facilities.
If the housing unit folds, Cummings
said that, "Wc would develop a new
group to live in the house."

Cummings emphasized that his
office "has no desire to have any group
closed." He did not like the word
"warn" when used in the context of
this new policy. "I think this is a
reasonable expectation for us to
make," he said.
Reasonable or not, the new policy
could alter the structure of fraternity
life considerably. Chuck Kitsman, Delta
Kappa Epsilon house manager,
observed that "20 to 36" is the
optimum number for a faternity. "In
light of the tough financial
responsibilities placed on the
fraternities by the administration,"
Kitsman said, "Our primary goal is to
get out of this house."
Tom Hazelhurst, Delta Upsilon
manager said, "We're all square with
the University but in many ways it
would be easier to get along with fewer
fraternities at Stanford."
Both Hazelhurst and Kitsman
implied that the new policy could be an
effort to reduce the number of
fraternities. Said Kitsman, "I wouldn't
want to say that Stanford is trying to
cut down the number of fraternities,
but one might infer it."
Only four or five houses are
classified as "having bad financial
problems" according to Cummings, but
the new policy will evaluate all the
fraternities and other independent
houses such as ATO, ZAP, Columbae,
and Lambda Nu on a quarterly basis.
Winter and spring expectations for
almost all of the housing units are
below the fall levels.
During the winter and spring
quarters boarders drift into the
university residence system and
off-campus. At minimum, the new
policy will force the independents into
a clearer long-term planning phase that

can reasonably assure a consistent
number of occupants for the spaces in
the various living groups.
Cummings spoke of what he hoped
would be the response to the new
policy saying, "I hope they
(fraternities) examine rush procedures,
be able to show that there is a group of
people that have something going for
them, and then attract new members."
"There will always be a fraternity
system at Stanford," he said, "In the
future, we may not be able to recognize
it, but there will always be a desire for
a small living group with independent
operation."

on a sound financial basis."
If any housing group runs up a larger
debt that it did last spring, Cummings
said, "We will immediately talk to the
house leaders, and if we see that there
is no way that the house could or
would operate on a break even basis we
would withdraw our support of that
living group." The withdrawal of
University support from one of the 2 4
independently-run houses would mean
an end for that living group since the
University owns all of the facilities.
If the housing unit folds, Cummings
said that, "Wc would develop a new
group to live in the house."

Cummings emphasized that his
office "has no desire to have any group
closed." He did not like the word
"warn" when used in the context of
this new policy. "I think this is a
reasonable expectation for us to
make," he said.
Reasonable or not, the new policy
could alter the structure of fraternity
life considerably. Chuck Kitsman, Delta
Kappa Epsilon house manager,
observed that "20 to 36" is the
optimum number for a faternity. "In
light of the tough financial
responsibilities placed on the
fraternities by the administration,"
Kitsman said, "Our primary goal is to
get out of this house."
Tom Hazelhurst, Delta Upsilon
manager said, "We're all square with
the University but in many ways it
would be easier to get along with fewer
fraternities at Stanford."
Both Hazelhurst and Kitsman
implied that the new policy could be an
effort to reduce the number of
fraternities. Said Kitsman, "I wouldn't
want to say that Stanford is trying to
cut down the number of fraternities,
but one might infer it."
Only four or five houses are
classified as "having bad financial
problems" according to Cummings, but
the new policy will evaluate all the
fraternities and other independent
houses such as ATO, ZAP, Columbae,
and Lambda Nu on a quarterly basis.
Winter and spring expectations for
almost all of the housing units are
below the fall levels.
During the winter and spring
quarters boarders drift into the
university residence system and
off-campus. At minimum, the new
policy will force the independents into
a clearer long-term planning phase that

can reasonably assure a consistent
number of occupants for the spaces in
the various living groups.
Cummings spoke of what he hoped
would be the response to the new
policy saying, "I hope they
(fraternities) examine rush procedures,
be able to show that there is a group of
people that have something going for
them, and then attract new members."
"There will always be a fraternity
system at Stanford," he said, "In the
future, we may not be able to recognize
it, but there will always be a desire for
a small living group with independent
operation."
