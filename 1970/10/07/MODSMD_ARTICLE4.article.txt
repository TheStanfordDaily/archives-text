# Lyman Sees 'New Urgency' In 'Daily' Independence
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
President Richard Lyman disclosed
last night that he feels an "increased
urgency" to "make the Daily
completely independent" in remarks
opening his second live press
conference on KZSU.
Lyman cited the publication last
Friday of a column which, he said,
"threatened with serious harm and
maybe even murder" two named
individuals "in the most thinly veiled
possible terms" as the cause for his
stepped-up concern.
During the course of the program,
Lyman termed the column, by
Revolutionary Union member
Diarmuid McGuire, "highly offensive
and irresponsible" and its publication a
"journalistic atrocity."
In defense of the publication of the
column, Daily co-editor Marshall
Kilduff said, "We live in an era when a
lot of violent rhetoric is said over and
over again . . . certainly our national
leaders are chief criminals in this
respect. . . and the New Left has
contributed as well.
"I didn't view it as a threat to the
individuals involved, and I don't think

anyone else who read it (prior to its
publication) did," Kilduff stated.
Bill Freivogel, also a co-editor,
explained that, in retrospect, he
thought "we should not have published
the references to individuals ... we
should have put ourselves in the
position of those who were being
threatened." He agreed with Kilduff's
statements in part, saying "I've seen
this rhetoric over and over."
Freivogel added that since it cast
some light on revolutionary thinking,
the column was "one of the most
informative we've published."
The column, sent to the Daily from
the Elmwood Rehabilitation Center,
where McGuire served a 30-day
sentence resulting from last spring's
disturbances, described in detail the
treatment given "snitches" in jail by
their fellow-prisoners.
McGuire termed those who had
testified against him as "snitches" and
concluded with a demand "Take care
of snitches."
After reading excerpts from the
column, Lyman said, "Put
yourself... in the position of the
individuals singled out in this article
and ask yourself how you would feel.
"The Daily has published a great
variety of viewpoints, year in, year
out. . . no-one is trying to inhibit that
in any way, shape or manner. It is not
an expression of opinion when you
incite people to stick knives in
other people," Lyman went on to say.
"I agree emphatically that it's
strange that nobody at the Daily
foresaw the reaction it has produced on
campus. I disagree emphatically with
the implication . . . that if (the
individuals named) were attacked
something less than immediately, there
was something somehow all right about
it,"he added.
Discussing the question of the
Daily's independence, Lyman said the

subject "has been bandied about for
several years," and added "I want to
make it plain that this subject was
under consideration before the
McGuire article.
"It would be a dreadful shame if
anything precipitate were done or had
to be done (on Daily
independence)...there has to be a
gradual transition unless there's a very
serious situation on campus," Lyman
stated, replying to a question on
whether measures to control or
eliminate the Daily were being
considered.
Questioned by Daily co-editor Bill
Freivogel as to which pressures led the
President's decision to accelerate the
efforts to sever ties between the Daily
and the University, Lyman responded
"It's my own idea; simply that."
When asked by KZSU manager Dave
Hosley if the radio station would be the
subject of a similar study since it too
received University funding, Lyman
replied that at the moment there would
not be any such move. Lyman admitted
that there were parallels between
KZSU's situation and "aily's.
Hosley cited a lettei jm Associate
Staff Counselor Daryl Dawson
recommending that KZSU not endorse
political candidates, and declared that
the question of supporting candidates
should lie with KZSU and not the
University. Lyman replied, "Not if the
University is legally involved in the
responsibility for it."
Lyman delivered a short opening
remark about the large numbers of
meal invitations that he has received.
The bulk of the evening conference was
taken up by a discussion of editorial
independence of the Daily and KZSU.
The Daily is currently subsidised by
a compulsory $3 yearly fee voted by a
2 to 1 margin last year. KZSU receives
$3000 from the University and $4 000
from student funds.
