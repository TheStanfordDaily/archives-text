# Forum Debates Political Process

### STEVE BROWN 
The American political system is
"extremely relevant (and) responsive to
the public will," proclaimed California
Assembly Speaker Robert Monagan last
night in Dinkelspiel.
"No, it is merely the superstructure
of a reactionary corporate economy,"
charged Peace and Freedom Senate
candidate and former Ramparts editor
Robert Scheer.
"In some areas,- maintaining peace,
fighting against racism, gaining justice,
and combatting poverty . . . the system
is not relevant, (we) must respond to
the problem," said Thomas Bradley,
Los Angeles Councilman and recent
Democratic candidate for mayor.
With these short remarks from the
three guest panelists, the Stanford
Committee for Participation in the
Political Process kicked off its Forum
'70 in hopes of informing students and
members of the social community and
involving them in the electoral process.

Monagan defined politics as "the art
of welding various interests into a
workable grouping for action" and,
along with Bradley, criticized those
students who confuse morality with
compromise and refuse to participate
within the system.
From the Top Down
Monagan pointed out that, in his
opinion, students were mistaken in
their desire to reform government
"from the top down," when what is
needed is work at the local level where
student efforts can have more impact.
He expressed his sorrow that
"students weren't in the political
process this summer," to which he
attributes the death of the Eighteen
Year Voting Age Amendment in the
Senate.
Bradley, not mincing words, showed
scorn for the "inflated rhetoric" of two
groups, "the political demigogues" and
the "destructive radicals," both of
whom lack the courage to devote
themselves to the major task ahead of
"bringing ourselves together over those
common beliefs shared by liberals and
conservatives alike.
Flashy Rhetoric
Scheer, more theatrical in his open
coller, blue breaker, and flashy
rhetoric, told students to "use the
electoral process to get the radical
position to the people," but to do so
with the realization that the outcome
of the election means little in terms of
meaningful change.
Despite his distance in philosophy
and style from the other guests,
Scheer's responses to questions directed
to the other two by student panelists
and members of the audience sparked
most of the debate.
Corporate Ownership
He described how the "corporate"
ownership of mass media and the need
for corporate campaign funds to gain
access to the media resulted in virtually
excluding many Americans, particularly
radicals, from the political process."
So, he urged, "Crush it!"
"Not so," retorted Monagan, who
emphasized his belief that any
American with an idea can get access to
the media, providing it is an idea
capable of attracting the American
public. He said that many Americans
with "fire, determination, and
enthusiasm have taken their view to the
people and bernme the majority."
