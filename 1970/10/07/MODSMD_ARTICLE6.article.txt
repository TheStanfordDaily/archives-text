4 Shoddy Tokenism'
(This letter was sent to the
Stanford Staff News which is
distributed to employees. A copy
was also sent to the Daily.)
I am writing my indignation
concerning your article "Four
Staff Members Consulted in
Search for New President" in the
September 2 4 issue of your
Personnel Office publication. I
find it most interesting that
although President Pitzer sent his
letter of resignation on June 25,
19 70, and although a faculty,
student and alumni group was
delegated responsibility for
seeking a new president on July 8 ,
197 0, not until August 17 did it
occur to Personnel Director
Nelson to ask for staff
"consultants" to the said
committee. And not until August
2 5 were the members "selected"
after "suggestions for the new
University president (were
requested) for ALL (emphasis
mine) staff members."
There are two points I wish to
make. 1) Although the rest of the
committee sat for three (3)
months, the "staff consultants"
were not asked to participate until
most of the 100 or so candidates
had already been reviewed by the
committee. I wonder just how
much participation Mr. Nelson
expected them to have. 2) The
only non-administrative "staff"
member "selected" was Patricia J.
Black and she was "editor of
administrative publications in
university relations." Where were
the custodians, lab support
workers, secretaries; where were
the physical plant, firemen and
gardeners; where were the
librarians, carpenters, glassware
washers, technicians'??
There is one other point: The
method of "selection" was not
detailed, but it can be easily
imagined. No effort was made to
include a broad employee group
responsible for selection, although
clearly it was possible even at that
late date. United Stanford
Employees has requested many
times in the past to be allowed to
send representatives selected from
a broad campus-based nomination
committee open to anyone in the
university employee ranks who
wished to particiate. We asked in
connection to sending
representatives to the Committee
on Women (evidently, the
committee didn't think staff
women were included in

committee's purview) and were
politely turned down.
As an employee who was not
informed that suggestions were
being taken from all staff
members, as a critic of the present
selection methods for the
important post of president, and
as a thinking member of the
Stanford community I am
appalled at this shoddy tokenism.

Censorship?
Editor, The Daily:
The community response to
the publication of McGuire's
letter is exemplary of a general
trend in our society toward a
vulnerability to censorship.
In their letters, the various
respondents spanned the opinion
range from simply accusing the
editors of irresponsibility to
demanding "severest censure". In
this last letter, there was a direct
call for community action,
although the desired form of
retribution was left unclear.
It was indeed unfortunate that
two specific individuals were
named in McGuire's letter as
implied objects of vindictive and
revengeful action. But the Daily
editors have already had ample
opportunity to hear the dissenting
view of the community on this
issue. Let's rest the case at this
point.
Especially in today's society in
this country, we must safeguard
what opportunity we have for free
expression of opinion. We should
provide no opening, even at the
level of the University student
newspaper, for the onset of new
censorship.

''Bizarre Response 9
Editor, The Daily:
No one can properly question
either Professor Spicer's right to
be dismayed at the editor's views
about U.S. society or the editor's
right to be upset when he is pitied
by Professor Spicer.
I wonder, however, whether
logic, reason, or just pure
humanism make the financing of
Professor Spicer's research a
relevant response to his line of
argument. Without expressing any
opinion of the editor's
philosophical views of society,
this visiting professor would
certainly be dismayed to find that
Stanford community is so

uncommitted to reason and
knowledge as to approve of such a
bizarre response to someone who
dissents from Mr. Kildut'f's views.
So as not to overburden the
editor's personal "FBI", I can
state that I am not now, nor ever
have been financed by the
Department of Defense. But, of
course I am in the Graduate
School of Business.

6 Extremist'?
Editor, The Daily:
Whenever certain people see
themselves losing an argument,
they will resort to the use of any
tactic, no matter how irrelevant.
We have a beautiful example of
this in the October 1 Daily. There
the Editor of the Daily inserted
information concerning DOD
contracts following my comments
on his Lyman editorial. This was
done, although DOD supported
research was not the subject of
either his Lyman editorial or my
comments. Why does he choose
this manner to reply to my
comments?
The tactic that the Editor is
attempting to use was well
established by right wing
extremists in the 195 o's. It is
called "guilt by association."
Fortunately, this tactic will not
work here. There is nothing about
which to be defensive in the
research question. First, it should
be pointed out that the Daily
made factual errors. I was
principle investigator of two and
not four, DOD sponsored
projects. A third project, "Optical
and Transport Studies in Solids,"
was supported by the NSF: and
the fourth, "Photoemission
Studies of Solids", was sponsored
by NASA. The DOD supported
projects were: "Photoemission
Investigations of Some Transition
Metal Oxides" and "Fundamental
Investigation of Photoemission."
As is obvious from these titles, the
work is basic, completely open,
and independent of source of
support.
The work on all of these
contracts and grants is solely in
the form of graduate student
thesis research. Six students
completed their Ph.D. thesis
research during the past year.
None has or plans to go to work
for the Department of Defense. (I
mention this not because I think
working for the DOD is immoral,
but because the radicals would
have you believe that if you work
on a DOD contract, you can only
do DOD work.)
I and the students would be
delighted to discuss our work and
extend to all of you (including the
Editors of the Daily) an invitation
to visit our laboratory.
W.E. Spicer
Professor of Electrical Engineering
and Material Science
(The Daily maintains that Prof.
Spicer was the principal
investigator in fiscal year 1969 for
at least four Department of
Defense contracts. The basis of
this claim is in 112 or ma t ion
contained in two documents.
They are "Program and Abstracts
of Papers for Stanford University
Electronics Research Review " (11
and 12 August 1969), which is
attached to a memorandum from
l*rof. Rambo dated 11 May 1970
and "Stanford University
Sponsored l*rojects Report For
the Year Ended August 31,
1969." Both of these documents
are the latest publicly available
and are located in the
undergraduate library.
Both documents list the
following Department of Defense
contracts with l*rof. Spicer as
principal investigator in addition
to those listed in Prof. Spicer's
letter: DOD contract no.
N66001-69-C-101 7 (High Vacuum
Photoemission). In addition, the
"Electronics Research Review"
lists a fifth DOD contract: no.
1) A AliO 9-6.9- C- 0082 (Clea ving
Chamber). Prof. Spicer
maintained in a telephone
interview with the Daily threr
contract numbers all refer to the
sa me DOD project.)
'Incarcerated 9
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your incarcerated columnist,
McGuire, revives for me memories
of elementary school, when we
liberally used the expression "to
snitch." But to our childish minds
of that. time, the word
"oppression" would have been
i nco m pr eheusible and
meaningless; such notions are
formed much later in the
approach to maturity. I he odd
juxtaposition of these terms, in
McGuire's essay, and of the
concepts behind the terms,
suggests to the reader that he

peruses a parody. At the same
time, other internal evidence of
this little essay tends to prove the
author totally devoid of humor.
Yes, McGuire is deadly serious,
certainly as to 4he fate he urges
for Messieurs Reed and White.
Notwithstanding his silly,
legalistic disclaimer that he "of
course would not advocate
revenge," the incitement to
violence is explicit and graphic.
Who are the oppressed? We
come to this great university from
many places, with diverse goals,
confused goals, or no goals at all.
The glory of this place consists in
large part of the freedom and
encouragement it gives us to
search, argue, experiment, ponder,
grope, change, and grow. The New
Barbarians, like McGuire, would
force us into a single mold and
destroy the university that gives
us so much. They use violence and
terror against us, although their
terrorism fortunately is still
pallidly romantic and ineffectual.
They seek to oppress those of us
who cherish our individual
freedom. In the involuted, quasi
logic of McGuire's essay,
oppressors and snitchers are the
same. It thus seems that McGuire
speaks (sings, moans) of himself.
The immediate targets of his
resentment, Messieurs Reed and
White, deserve our gratitude and
praise. It takes courage to stand
up and fight oppression. Too
many of us have passively endured
the behavior of the
neo-oppressors. It is time that we
join the Reeds and Whites in
defense of our university and of
our civilization.
Sincerely,
Charles F. Mansfield
(P.S. To identify myself, I am a
Stanford alumnus, JD'6B, now on
the General Secretary's staff
employed at the Law School;
none of this, of course, has any
bearing on the merits of this
letter.)
Article Shocks. . .
Editor, THE DAILY:
Having once worked on
student publications, I picked up
the Stanford Daily with the
anticipation of enjoying a good
campus newspaper. . .
On reading the article
entitled "Band Shocks Southern
Pigs," my reaction wasn't one of
anger or even flustration, but
rather one of disappointment.
There is a profound inconsistency
between Stanford's high academic
reputation and the image created
by both this article and almost the
entire contents of The Stanford
Daily.
The story by Dan Bernstein
was neither objective nor
accurate. I found the line ending
"and played an all soul music rally
for the newly integrated student
body" amusing in its oversight.
Mr. Bernstein, Memphis and
Nashville are the birthplaces of
Soul. There are several members
of the Razorback band capable of
demonstrating the best of it to
Stanfordites. And by the way,
UofA was "integrated" in 1957.
I can not recall any article
concerning another school in the
UofA's campus paper being
written in such a high-school snob
vein as this one. If the Stanford
band members do possess the
essence of Soul, perhaps they can
rap with the Daily's staff on a few
of its insights. With 16 pages of
newsprint potential, why waste it?
T.J. Patrick
University of Arkansas
Supporters
(The following is a copy of a
letter sent to Chuck Taylor,
Director of Athletics.)
Dear Mr. Taylor:
The Stanford Band recently
returned from Little Rock,
Arkansas, after playing for the
Stan ford-Arkansas football game.
Except for a token contribution
by the Athletic Department, the
trip was financed out of the
pockets of the individual band
members.
Sixty-five bandsmen felt
strongly enough to make the trip
to Arkansas where their presence
perhaps gave the team the extra
lift needed to win the close game
against a team which had been
ranked above them in the national
polls.
Considering the tremendous
revenue Stanford received from
the nationally televised game, it is
a real shame that the Athletic
Department can't provide a little
extra support to an organization
which gives so much support to
Stanford's athletic teams.
