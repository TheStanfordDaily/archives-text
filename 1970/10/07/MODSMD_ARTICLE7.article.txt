# Child Care â€“ A New Way To Teach
## 
### CANDIA YOUNG 
The Children's Center for the
Stanford Community, now
located in the old Stanford
Elementary School on May field
Avenue, could well be termed an
educational innovation, although
Nora Bennett, the Center's
teacher, refuses to classify it
exactly as schooling.
"Parents often ask me, 'Do you
teach the children things?', and
my reply is always, no, I never sit
the child down and say, 'Alright,
now we're going to learn how to
count.' Instead we do a lot of
counting while we play. We take
the children on nature walks, and
rely on their natural curiosity.
"When the child asks me
questions, I try to follow up his
enthusiasm. One little boy asked
me, 'Do airplanes use gasoline?' I
could have given him a straight
yes or no answer, but instead we
talked about how there are
different kinds of gasoline and
how much airplanes use."
Mrs. Bennett feels that all
education should use this
approach since children, like
anyone else, learn only when
they're enthusiastic. The Child
Care Center, which provides
nursery school, day care and
infant care for 36 children,
involves its children in numerous
projects. Next week they will
make butter.
Creative Learning
"We could just put the
cream in jars, shake it up, butter
bread, and let the children eat it.
Instead we're going to discuss
where the milk comes from, taste
the butter before we salt it, see
how butter tastes after we salt it,
and then taste the buttered bread.
"One has to remember that
things that seem obvious to adults
aren't to children. It's important
to discuss things with them."
Mrs. Bennett feels strongly that
schooling for children should be
less authoritarian and doesn't
advocate the now-every
one-go-outisde-and-play approach.
For this reason Mrs. Bennett
never limits children to a single
group activity and permits instead
what she describes as a

"smorgasbord" of things to
choose from.
That way the children can do
what interests them. "If a child is
really interested in painting and
everyone is doing something else,
we don't stifle him, we let him
paint."
Asked if this permissive
approach will have detrimental
affects on children when they
enter elementary school, Mrs.
Bennett replied, "You can't keep
saying that you have to give
children bad things now so that
when they enter first grade they'll
be used to bad things. That's a
very poor excuse.
Children Benefit
"There are a lot of benefits
from a child care center," she
continued, "that children couldn't

"/ never sit the child down and say. 'Alright. now we're
going to learn how to count. '

have if they stayed at home with
their mothers all day." At the
Center the children experience
companionship, learn about adults
other than their parents, and,
because many of the mothers do
part-time work at the Center,
children can see their mothers in a
new role.
Whether or not mothers can
leave their children at a day care
center without feeling a certain
amount of guilt is another matter.
Mrs. Bennett feels that "America
is in an era of patronizing
understanding of mothers who
have to work," but those mothers
who don't absolutely have to go
to work or to school may be
socially conditioned into feeling
thai somehow they are not
fulfilling their family
responsibilities.
Mothers might logically and
rationally understand that they
are doing the right thing and yet
still fell guilty. But one student
mother had nothing but praise for
the Center. "It helps me. I
couldn't go to school without it
and it helps the kids. They're
always enthusiastic about going
there. My youngest always walks

in with a happy, 'Hi David' for his
teacher. With the children so
happy, there's absolutely no
guilt."
This mother, along with many
others works part-time at the
Center, and is impressed with "the
very warm feeling between the
teacher and the children."
Parents Participate
Like all other parents she is
represented in the Center through
participation meetings.
Participation meetings are
essentially policy meetings.
Parents, who under the terms of
the lease with Stanford, must be
connected with the Stanford
Community, pay monthly fees of
$4 0-$8 0 based on ability to pay.
Parent's who work at the Center
are given further deductions. A

new program has also been
instituted which allows parents
hourly child care at 50c an hour.
Presently the school is staffed
by two full time teachers,
volunteers, two work-study
students, and Stanford students
enrolled in the SWOPSI course,
"Teaching and Learning in
Alternative Schools."
Organized a year ago, the
Stanford Community Children's
Center began operation in the
Children's Convalescent Hospital
with a limited facility for twenty
children. Since last December, the
committee for Stanford's
Children's Centers has been
struggling for support from
Stanford University.
The original letter to former
President Kenneth Pitzer, met
with guarded enthusiasm for the
idea, but not much hope for
university financing. "I cannot be
encouraging about the possibility
of using University funds" for the
Child Care Center. This attitude
seems to have characterized
further university relations with
the center.

University support has been
slow in coming. The ASSU Senate
allocated $1614 of its budget to
the center last May. Yet, early this
summer, the SCCC was still
seeking the assistance of Kenneth
Pitzer.
"It is now June," wrote the
members of the Stanford Child
Care Center, "and we feel a sense
of urgency about our program
regarding location and financing."
Finally, on August 14, eight
months after the original request
for the Stanford Elementary
School, the university signed a
two year lease with the Child Care
Center.
The lease provides for rent-free
use of the Stanford Elementary
School's Multi-Use Room, and
Additional Building, and leaves an
option for a two year renewal.
Mr. Cassius Kirk, Stanford's
legal counsel for the lease
negotiations, characterized the
talks as "generally amicable, but
unusually long." He attributed the
lengthiness of the negotiations to
"a difference in attitude", which
is a plausible explanation since the
Center has continually
emphasized the university's
responsibility to provide for the
children of the workers and
students it has brought into the
Stanford community.
But Provost Rosensweig points
out that the center is only a
"fringe benefit" and "not at the
top of University priorities."
While a two-year, rent-fees
lease might seem a substantial
contribution, Child Care Center
officials emphasize that there are
not provisions for utilities,
maintenance, insurance or taxes.
Rosensweig stresses that rent
alone is a $1 2 ,000 yearly subsidy,
and in light of the university
financial squeeze, that is all the
university can afford.
Tax Problem
Kirk pointed out that since the
university is an educational
institution, and therefore pays no
taxes, it sees no reason to pay the
elementary school's taxes, which

result from the reclassification of
the building's use.
The $18 00 in taxes may not
seem like a substantial financial
problem for the center to handle,
hut center coordinator, Mrs.
Newcomer warned that when the
taxes are due next March, the
SCCC may be in serious financial
trouble.
Bruce Kennedy, the attorney
for the center, has applied for a
tax exemption, but Stanford's
Kirk is pessimistic about the
prospect of getting one. "If 1 had
to make a prediction, I'd say no."
Utility and maintenance bills
pose similar problems Parents
sacrifice their weekends to mop
and scrub the center, and Mrs.
Newcomer pointed out that the
salaries of two full-time teachers
consume what income there is.
Provost Rosensweig shrugged
off the utility and maintenance
bills, saying, "I don't think they
amount to very much."
