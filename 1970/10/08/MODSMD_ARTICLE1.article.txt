# Willful Negligence Charged
## Conservative Suit 'Very Alive' 
### CHARLES HORN 
The case of the Stanford six, the 6 Free Campus Movement (FCM) members
who are filing a $1.05 million lawsuit against the University for its failure to
protect them during last year's Dec. 4 incident at the Placement Center and
Tresidder, is still "very much alive", according to Arena co-editor and FCM leader
Chris Hocker.
The incident involved radical harassment and assault of conservatives during an
anti-General Electric demonstration in front of the Placement Center. The radicals
involved charged that the FCM was taking photos to be used as incriminating
evidence against them, as had reportedly happened after the 1969 Stanford
Research Institute incident and Encina sit-in; the FCM had claimed that the
photos were to be used for the Arena.
According to Hocker, the University "willfully and maliciously allowed the
hassling of the photographer and his associates to go on without irying to do
anything about it for fear of further aggression."
"What happened was serious enough to warrant legal action of this kind, since
this kind of assault on individuals, and especially conservatives, has happened both
before and after the Dec. 4 incident. The purpose of the suit is not just to protect
conservatives, but rather to establish a precedent by which students can be
protected from outsiders whose intention is to disrupt."
No Date Set
The case is due to go to court sometime after February, although an exact date
has not been set.
The suit is asking for $300,000 in reparatory damages, an $750,000 in punitive
damages.
Asked to comment about the case, plaintiff attorneys Roger Mosher and John
Clark said;
"The University had notice of what was happening at the time and did nothing
about it.

"Perhaps the term 'malicious' is a bit overstating it, but California law requires
more than pure negligence to recover punitive damages. Furthermore, 'malicious'
in legal jargon means essentially 'negligance of a willful nature'. As for reparatory
damages, the proof of simple negligence is enough."
Commenting further on the proceedings of the case at this point, they said:
"One of the things we wish to prove is that not only did the University know
of the outsiders, but that it also has files on specific individuals, which includes
past hsitories. We feel that the University was guilty of gross carelessness, and one
of the things we hope to clarify with this case is that the University is obligated to
assure the student full protection as part of the general agreement between the
university and the student."
Mosher and Clark expressed optimism about the outcome saying that
precedent was on their side.
The question of an out-of-court settlement at the moment is very uncertain.
However, the plaintiff attorneys mentioned: "We're always willing to listen to any
reasonable proposal. A substantial monetary settlement would certainly establish
the principle, but if the University agreed to significantly change those procedures
with regard to student protection which existed at the time of the incident, then
this would constitute a satisfactory settlement, with the monetary settlement
being less significant." , . ...

section, couldn't take the steam out of the Boilermakers.
David Heilbrom,defense attorney for the University, said in this respect: "I
think that it is improper to disclose any details concerning a case in litigation.
We're taking depositions in order to find out precisely what is involved, but those
details cannot really be discussed at the time."
The University counsel for legal affairs, Jim Siena, concurred with HeUbrom's
stand concerning divulgeance of the defense case, but added:
"I like to think that the University does take adequate precautions in all
matters concerning the protection of students. I wish to emphasize that I am not
referring to any case in particular. Nonetheless, we are taking this case seriously."
He went on to mention that the defense is denying all charges brought forth by
the FCM, and this fact is supported by the official response of the University to
these charges, which categorically denies the charges brought forth.
The Stanford six are: Hocker; Harvey Hukari, now working at KQED in San
Francisco; Ernesto Rael, sophomore; Craig Ostfeld, a graduate student in Physics;
Roger Reed, presently studying at Duke Law School; and Edward Jagels, senior.

"Perhaps the term 'malicious' is a bit overstating it, but California law requires
more than pure negligence to recover punitive damages. Furthermore, 'malicious'
in legal jargon means essentially 'negligance of a willful nature'. As for reparatory
damages, the proof of simple negligence is enough."
Commenting further on the proceedings of the case at this point, they said:
"One of the things we wish to prove is that not only did the University know
of the outsiders, but that it also has files on specific individuals, which includes
past hsitories. We feel that the University was guilty of gross carelessness, and one
of the things we hope to clarify with this case is that the University is obligated to
assure the student full protection as part of the general agreement between the
university and the student."
Mosher and Clark expressed optimism about the outcome saying that
precedent was on their side.
The question of an out-of-court settlement at the moment is very uncertain.
However, the plaintiff attorneys mentioned: "We're always willing to listen to any
reasonable proposal. A substantial monetary settlement would certainly establish
the principle, but if the University agreed to significantly change those procedures
with regard to student protection which existed at the time of the incident, then
this would constitute a satisfactory settlement, with the monetary settlement
being less significant." , . ...

of California, talks to students and pets a dog outside Tresidder
Memorial Union. He spoke in the Union to a noon meeting
yesterday.
The case of the Stanford six, the 6 Free Campus Movement (FCM) members
who are filing a $1.05 million lawsuit against the University for its failure to
protect them during last year's Dec. 4 incident at the Placement Center and
Tresidder, is still "very much alive", according to Arena co-editor and FCM leader
Chris Hocker.
The incident involved radical harassment and assault of conservatives during an
anti-General Electric demonstration in front of the Placement Center. The radicals
involved charged that the FCM was taking photos to be used as incriminating
evidence against them, as had reportedly happened after the 1969 Stanford
Research Institute incident and Encina sit-in; the FCM had claimed that the
photos were to be used for the Arena.
According to Hocker, the University "willfully and maliciously allowed the
hassling of the photographer and his associates to go on without irying to do
anything about it for fear of further aggression."
"What happened was serious enough to warrant legal action of this kind, since
this kind of assault on individuals, and especially conservatives, has happened both
before and after the Dec. 4 incident. The purpose of the suit is not just to protect
conservatives, but rather to establish a precedent by which students can be
protected from outsiders whose intention is to disrupt."
No Date Set
The case is due to go to court sometime after February, although an exact date
has not been set.
The suit is asking for $300,000 in reparatory damages, an $750,000 in punitive
damages.
Asked to comment about the case, plaintiff attorneys Roger Mosher and John
Clark said;
"The University had notice of what was happening at the time and did nothing
about it.

"Perhaps the term 'malicious' is a bit overstating it, but California law requires
more than pure negligence to recover punitive damages. Furthermore, 'malicious'
in legal jargon means essentially 'negligance of a willful nature'. As for reparatory
damages, the proof of simple negligence is enough."
Commenting further on the proceedings of the case at this point, they said:
"One of the things we wish to prove is that not only did the University know

We're taking depositions in order to find out precisely what is involved, but those
details cannot really be discussed at the time."
The University counsel for legal affairs, Jim Siena, concurred with HeUbrom's
stand concerning divulgeance of the defense case, but added:
"I like to think that the University does take adequate precautions in all
matters concerning the protection of students. I wish to emphasize that I am not
referring to any case in particular. Nonetheless, we are taking this case seriously."
He went on to mention that the defense is denying all charges brought forth by
the FCM, and this fact is supported by the official response of the University to
these charges, which categorically denies the charges brought forth.
The Stanford six are: Hocker; Harvey Hukari, now working at KQED in San
Francisco; Ernesto Rael, sophomore; Craig Ostfeld, a graduate student in Physics;
Roger Reed, presently studying at Duke Law School; and Edward Jagels, senior.
