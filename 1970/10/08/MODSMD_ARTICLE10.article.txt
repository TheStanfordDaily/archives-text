Resist Criminals

Editor, The Daily:
Monday's issue of the Daily
carried five letters and a feature
length article all responding to D.
McGuire's illuminating article on
snitchesâ€”snitches in prison and on
campus. Four of the letter-writers
expressed "disgust with the
Daily.," for printing the article.
The fifth soul-searching writer
merely questioned whether she
(he?) was Queen of the May. All
of them are putting up
smokescreens to cloud the real
issue. That issue is snitches and
their complicity with the forces of
world imperialism.
These letter-writers would do
well to re-direct their disgust to
(1) the oppression of black,
brown, and third world peoples,
(2) U.S. imperialist aggression, (3)
fascism and the increasing
repression of those resisting the
exploitation of their brothers and
sisters, (4) the social and
economic oppression of women,
and (5) the attack on living
standards (inflation,
unemployment, housing, and poor
working conditions).
We agree with Charles Baxter's
statement that "response and
action from the total University
community is necessary,"-against
snitches and the people they
serve.
Free Campus Movement, an
organization of professional
fingermen, serves the ruling class.
For example, Hay White, their

chairman, has given bis stamp of
approval to "legal dissent" on the
grounds that this doesn't interfere
with human rights. This, of
course, includes the right of his
class, the ruling elite, to napalm
Vietnamese peasants. Ray has
appeared on numerous occasions
as a finger-man for Stanford and
the Santa Clara pigs in many trials
and SJC hearings. Ray is by no
means a class traitor.
Neither is Ray's cohort, Roger
Reed. Roger's daddy is a
plantation owner and Roger has
publicly boasted that his family
has not only black sharecroppers
but white sharecroppers as well.
Roger, Ray, and the
letter-writers are defending our
"free society." These people are
racist if they consider this a free
society. Consider the class nature
of these "letters of disgust." The
letter-writers have labelled
McGuire's accusations of the
snitch's complicity with mass
murder "piggish," and "criminal,"
and have tried to equate dealing
with snitches with bombing
Vietnamese villages. Clearly, these
people are not Vietnamese
villagers, have never fought a war
of survival in the ghetto, and
certainly have never been in jail or
suffered the consequences of a
snitch. Again we say that these
letters cloud the real issue and
obscure the real criminals
perpetrating piggish acts.
We define genocide against
peoples of the third world as a
criminal act.
We define the training of

leaders of the wai macmne a
criminal act.
We define the American panel
system as a criminal act.
It is our right and duty to resist
and rebel against all real criminals.

Daily Right

Editor, THE DAILY:
D. McGuire was wrong.
Stripped of rhetoric and
mitigating circumstances, the
argument he made for punishing
snitches is an argument for
summary judgment, a sentence
passed without even the
semblance of a trial.
Nevertheless, the Daily was
right in publishing his article,
because it demonstrates the
desperation and alienation which
has become resident within us.
Pretending that no one of us
w hi t e -1 ib e r a 1 - up per- middleclass
Stanford people identifies with
and feels oppressed with the black
and the brown and the poor is
ludicrous, especially when we
have sentenced so many students
to jail, to live night and day under
miserable conditions amongst the
most oppressed people in our
society.
D's ideas won't go away
because we don't publish them.
Perhaps instead, if we helped him

to find jobs for some of the
inmates with whom he identifies
(a project he is now engaged in)
and got seriously about the
business of changing society so
that all people will feel that the
police, courts and government are
responsive to their needs, the
tremendous constructive power
which is D. McGuire would be
able to come back to building and
creating. Of course, if we did this,
Roger and Ray wouldn't need to
snitch, and we wouldn't be
sending students to jail, but then
again thy powerful ruling group in
this country might not be so
happy.
