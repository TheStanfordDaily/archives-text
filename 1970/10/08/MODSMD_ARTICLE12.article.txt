Those who have joined in placing this ad
vertisement come from many parts of the Uni
versity and claim a variety of political persua
sions. For some of us, primary concern is that
a friend has been openly threatened with vio
lence; for others, it is that the very processes
of law, and the University's capacity for self
government, are being threatened by an at
tempt to intimidate prospective witnesses;
and for still others, it is simply the prevalence
of "violent rhetoric" and of the real violence
that is its usual sad aftermath.
Whatever our personal connection with the
individuals or issues concerned, we are united
in our disgust that the Daily should have pub
lished the article by D. McGuire in last Fri
day's issue ("Snitches and Oppression," p.
3). The article openly urged that two named
students be beaten or killed and, no less sig
nificantly, that similar reprisals be executed
against anyone who in the future should give
evidence against members of "the Move
ment." The editors have sought to justify
their publication of the article in the name of
"free speech" and their obligation to inform
the community of "unique" perspectives and
"unfamiliar" points of view (Monday Daily,
p. 8). The justification is specious; nothing is
unique about a cry for vengeance; nothing in
the freedom of speech makes privileged an in
citement to murder; and nothing in journal-

istic tradition requires a newspaper to carry
out the purposes of one seeking to incite vio
lence by broadcasting his appeal to those he
seeks to move to violence. An incitement, like
a libel, requires publication to achieve its
ends, and in each case the organ that gives
voice to the words is necessarily implicated in
the wrong.
For the named students, whose security
and peace of mind have been directly invaded
by the article's publication, there is the possi
bility of direct recourse through a legal action
against the Daily and its editors. For the rest
of us, equally the victims of the attempt to in
timidate future witnesses and thereby ob
struct our only effective defenses against vio
lence, no such direct recourse seems availa
ble. That does not mean, however, that there
is nothing that can or should be done.
For one thing, the Daily's privileged posi
tion as the "official" University-student news
paper, financed by direct subsidies from the
University and forced contributions from the
students, is not sacrosanct. There is a recur
ring question whether the Daily might not be
come a more responsible voice if, like its
counterparts at Harvard and Yale, it deprived
of institutional support and had to earn the
respect of voluntary subscribers. While the
signers of this statement are not prepared col
lectively to urge that the Daily be made in-

dependent, the irresponsibility demonstrat
ed by the editors in this instance provides yet
another reason to reexamine the relationship.
Even without such basic institutional
changes, however, we believe that it lies with
in the power of the community to shape to a
substantial extent the policies of the Daily.
Even a newspaper with a protected financial
base and a guaranteed circulation needs the
respect of its readers to be effective, and in
the long run the Daily will respond to the
standards to which it is held by the commu
nity. In the end we will get the kind of news
paper we deserve. If we really insist that it be
responsible, it will be. If, oil the other hand,
we have lost our capacity to be outraged and
endorse, by our silence, the Daily's participa
tion even in the advocacy of murder, we will
no doubt get more of the same.
To the end of bringing a more responsible
journalism to the Daily, we, the undersigned,
declare our contempt for its action in pub
lishing the McGuire article, and we reject and
condemn the standards of journalism that led
to, and are offered in justification of, its pub
lication. We urge others, by whatever chan
nels are available to them, to do likewise, and
to signal, as we have, that the urging of vio
lence against anyone, named or unnamed, is
intolerable in the Stanford community.

lence against anyone, named or unnamed, is
intolerable in the Stanford community.
Those who have joined in placing this ad
vertisement come from many parts of the Uni
versity and claim a variety of political persua
sions. For some of us, primary concern is that
a friend has been openly threatened with vio
lence; for others, it is that the very processes
of law, and the University's capacity for self
government, are being threatened by an at
tempt to intimidate prospective witnesses;
and for still others, it is simply the prevalence
of "violent rhetoric" and of the real violence
that is its usual sad aftermath.
Whatever our personal connection with the
individuals or issues concerned, we are united
in our disgust that the Daily should have pub
lished the article by D. McGuire in last Fri
day's issue ("Snitches and Oppression," p.
3). The article openly urged that two named
students be beaten or killed and, no less sig
nificantly, that similar reprisals be executed
against anyone who in the future should give
evidence against members of "the Move
ment." The editors have sought to justify
their publication of the article in the name of
"free speech" and their obligation to inform
the community of "unique" perspectives and
"unfamiliar" points of view (Monday Daily,
p. 8). The justification is specious; nothing is
unique about a cry for vengeance; nothing in
the freedom of speech makes privileged an in
citement to murder; and nothing in journal-

istic tradition requires a newspaper to carry
out the purposes of one seeking to incite vio
lence by broadcasting his appeal to those he
seeks to move to violence. An incitement, like
a libel, requires publication to achieve its
ends, and in each case the organ that gives
voice to the words is necessarily implicated in
the wrong.
For the named students, whose security
and peace of mind have been directly invaded
by the article's publication, there is the possi
bility of direct recourse through a legal action
against the Daily and its editors. For the rest
of us, equally the victims of the attempt to in
timidate future witnesses and thereby ob
struct our only effective defenses against vio
lence, no such direct recourse seems availa
ble. That does not mean, however, that there
is nothing that can or should be done.
For one thing, the Daily's privileged posi
tion as the "official" University-student news
paper, financed by direct subsidies from the
University and forced contributions from the
students, is not sacrosanct. There is a recur
ring question whether the Daily might not be
come a more responsible voice if, like its
counterparts at Harvard and Yale, it deprived
of institutional support and had to earn the
respect of voluntary subscribers. While the
signers of this statement are not prepared col
lectively to urge that the Daily be made in-

dependent, the irresponsibility demonstrat
ed by the editors in this instance provides yet
another reason to reexamine the relationship.
Even without such basic institutional
changes, however, we believe that it lies with
in the power of the community to shape to a
substantial extent the policies of the Daily.
Even a newspaper with a protected financial
base and a guaranteed circulation needs the
respect of its readers to be effective, and in
the long run the Daily will respond to the
standards to which it is held by the commu
nity. In the end we will get the kind of news
paper we deserve. If we really insist that it be
responsible, it will be. If, oil the other hand,
we have lost our capacity to be outraged and
endorse, by our silence, the Daily's participa
tion even in the advocacy of murder, we will
no doubt get more of the same.
To the end of bringing a more responsible
journalism to the Daily, we, the undersigned,
declare our contempt for its action in pub
lishing the McGuire article, and we reject and
condemn the standards of journalism that led
to, and are offered in justification of, its pub
lication. We urge others, by whatever chan
nels are available to them, to do likewise, and
