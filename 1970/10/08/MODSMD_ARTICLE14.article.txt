## Stanford & Housing Crisis 
### patu research committee 
The Palo Alto Tenants' Union's
tent city at Stanford is
history now, after having been up
for a week between Mem Aud and
the Pavillion. Why did the
Tenants' Union come to Stanford
to dramatize the severe housing
shortage in the Mid-Peninsula? To
answer this question, we'll have to
answer some questions about

what Stanford's role in creating
the current housing crisis has
been, and what Stanford is now
doing to solve it.
(1) How hus Stanford used its
land resources ill the past? Three
thousand of Stanford's 8800 acres
have been set up as a land
development project, the largest
part of which is the Stanford

Industrial Park. War-related firms
such as Hewlett-Packard,
Lockheed, Varian Associates,
Watkins-Johnson, and others, are
located there. Similar companies,
such as Philco-Ford, Ampex,
Westinghouse, and General
Electric, have located in the area,
attracted by the "community of
technical scholars" envisioned by
Stanford engineering professor
Frederick Terman, who once
observed: "It is not just a
coincidence that most of this type
of research -oriented electronics
industry in the Bay Area lies
within a 15 mile circle centered at
Stanford."
At the same time, no planning
was ever undertaken by Stanford
to house the thousands of workers
attracted to the Palo Alto area by
its industrial growth.
(2) What role hus this land use
policy played in creating the
current housing crisis? As of
January, 1 9G9, the Industrial Park
employed 17 ,930 people,
generating a demand for 13,37(1
units of housing (2/3 of Palo
Alto's 20,000 units). The total
demand generated by Stanford's
professional and commercial land
development policies would fill
4/5 of Palo Alto's total housing. If
we add to this the need for 8 , 65 4
units generated by Stanford's
12,000 full- and part-time
employees, and the additional
need for 3,282 units of
off-campus student housing, then
it is clear that there are not
enough homes in all.of Palo Alto
to satisfy the housing demand
created by Stanford alone!
(3) What are Stanford's current
development activities? Stanford
land is currently being used for
two development projects: the
Coyote Hill project; and
Dillingham's Palo Alto Square, at
the corner of Page Mill and El
Camino. Coyote Hill is the first of
the foothills overlooking the
campus. When fully developed, it
will bring 3000 to 5 000 new
workers to Palo Alto. Fairchild
Corporation has already begun
construction of its semi-conductor
plant there. Other firms had
planned to build there as well, but
a pending conflict-of-interest
lawsuit has scared away their
financing, at least for the time
being. However, Stanford has
already spent $2 million for roads

on Coyote Hill, so we may expect
the University to seek other firms.
Dillingham, the other project on
Stanford land, will bring 1500
new workers into the area.
(4) Whut is Stanford, doing to
help solve the housing crisis?
"Stanford trustees have
designated the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition as sponsor and
developer for approximately 200
units of low and moderate income
housing to be located on Stanford
land." (Stanford Daily, 9 /29 /70,
p. 1). While any construction of
low income housing is, in itself, a
positive action, it is obvious from
what we have already discussed
that 200 units of low moderate
income ho ising is not even a drop
in the bucket. It is also clear that
Stanford's current development
programs, discussed above, are
generating just by themselves a
need for many times 200 units of
housing. The Wright Committee
on Housing, which last May
recommended to the University's
trustees that Stanford begin
development of 000 to 2000 units
(not 2 00 ), stated that "alternative
A (that the University sponsor a
single trial development of limited
size, with no further commitment
at this time) would suggest a kind
of tokenism that might expose the
University to the charge of
hypocrisy; it would seem to
indicate no serious intention to
help solve a major problem which
the University has helped to
create."
The reasons for the Tenants'
Union's coming to Stanford are
evident. Stanford's land use in the
past and now, has created and is
continuing to exacerbate a very
severe housing shortage.
Stanford's "commitment" to
helping solve the crisis is utter
tokenism, especially in the
context of the fact that, in the
words of the Wright Committee,
"no further commitment at this
time" is even contemplated!
Clearly, Stanford will not
really begin to meet its
responsibilities in the area of
housing, unless it is forced to do
so. The Palo Alto Tenants' Union
will continue to fight for adequate
and decent housing in this area for
the people who work and study
here, and against the kind of
development policies which
Stanford has fostered.

and decent housing in this area for
the people who work and study
here, and against the kind of
development policies which
Stanford has fostered.

The Palo Alto Tenants' Union's
tent city at Stanford is
history now, after having been up
for a week between Mem Aud and
the Pavillion. Why did the
Tenants' Union come to Stanford
to dramatize the severe housing
shortage in the Mid-Peninsula? To
answer this question, we'll have to
answer some questions about

what Stanford's role in creating
the current housing crisis has
been, and what Stanford is now
doing to solve it.
(1) How hus Stanford used its
land resources ill the past? Three
thousand of Stanford's 8800 acres
have been set up as a land
development project, the largest
part of which is the Stanford

Industrial Park. War-related firms
such as Hewlett-Packard,
Lockheed, Varian Associates,
Watkins-Johnson, and others, are
located there. Similar companies,
such as Philco-Ford, Ampex,
Westinghouse, and General
Electric, have located in the area,
attracted by the "community of
technical scholars" envisioned by
Stanford engineering professor
Frederick Terman, who once
observed: "It is not just a
coincidence that most of this type
of research -oriented electronics
industry in the Bay Area lies
within a 15 mile circle centered at
Stanford."
At the same time, no planning
was ever undertaken by Stanford
to house the thousands of workers
attracted to the Palo Alto area by
its industrial growth.
(2) What role hus this land use
policy played in creating the
current housing crisis? As of
January, 1 9G9, the Industrial Park
employed 17 ,930 people,
generating a demand for 13,37(1
units of housing (2/3 of Palo
Alto's 20,000 units). The total
demand generated by Stanford's
professional and commercial land
development policies would fill
4/5 of Palo Alto's total housing. If
we add to this the need for 8 , 65 4
units generated by Stanford's
12,000 full- and part-time
employees, and the additional
need for 3,282 units of
off-campus student housing, then
it is clear that there are not
enough homes in all.of Palo Alto
to satisfy the housing demand
created by Stanford alone!
(3) What are Stanford's current
development activities? Stanford
land is currently being used for
two development projects: the
Coyote Hill project; and
Dillingham's Palo Alto Square, at
the corner of Page Mill and El
Camino. Coyote Hill is the first of
the foothills overlooking the
campus. When fully developed, it
will bring 3000 to 5 000 new
workers to Palo Alto. Fairchild
Corporation has already begun
construction of its semi-conductor
plant there. Other firms had
planned to build there as well, but
a pending conflict-of-interest
lawsuit has scared away their
financing, at least for the time
being. However, Stanford has
already spent $2 million for roads

on Coyote Hill, so we may expect
the University to seek other firms.
Dillingham, the other project on
Stanford land, will bring 1500
new workers into the area.
(4) Whut is Stanford, doing to
help solve the housing crisis?
"Stanford trustees have
designated the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition as sponsor and
developer for approximately 200
units of low and moderate income
housing to be located on Stanford
land." (Stanford Daily, 9 /29 /70,
p. 1). While any construction of
low income housing is, in itself, a
positive action, it is obvious from
what we have already discussed
that 200 units of low moderate
income ho ising is not even a drop
in the bucket. It is also clear that
Stanford's current development
programs, discussed above, are
generating just by themselves a
need for many times 200 units of
housing. The Wright Committee
on Housing, which last May
recommended to the University's
trustees that Stanford begin
development of 000 to 2000 units
(not 2 00 ), stated that "alternative
A (that the University sponsor a
single trial development of limited
size, with no further commitment
at this time) would suggest a kind
of tokenism that might expose the
University to the charge of
hypocrisy; it would seem to
indicate no serious intention to
help solve a major problem which
the University has helped to
create."
The reasons for the Tenants'
Union's coming to Stanford are
evident. Stanford's land use in the
past and now, has created and is
continuing to exacerbate a very
severe housing shortage.
Stanford's "commitment" to
helping solve the crisis is utter
tokenism, especially in the
context of the fact that, in the
words of the Wright Committee,
"no further commitment at this
time" is even contemplated!
Clearly, Stanford will not
really begin to meet its
responsibilities in the area of
housing, unless it is forced to do
so. The Palo Alto Tenants' Union
will continue to fight for adequate
and decent housing in this area for
the people who work and study
here, and against the kind of
development policies which
Stanford has fostered.

time" is even contemplated!
Clearly, Stanford will not
really begin to meet its
responsibilities in the area of
housing, unless it is forced to do
so. The Palo Alto Tenants' Union
will continue to fight for adequate
and decent housing in this area for
the people who work and study
here, and against the kind of
development policies which
Stanford has fostered.

The Palo Alto Tenants' Union's
tent city at Stanford is
history now, after having been up
for a week between Mem Aud and
the Pavillion. Why did the
Tenants' Union come to Stanford
to dramatize the severe housing
shortage in the Mid-Peninsula? To
answer this question, we'll have to
answer some questions about

what Stanford's role in creating
the current housing crisis has
been, and what Stanford is now
doing to solve it.
(1) How hus Stanford used its
land resources ill the past? Three
thousand of Stanford's 8800 acres
have been set up as a land
development project, the largest
part of which is the Stanford

Industrial Park. War-related firms
such as Hewlett-Packard,
Lockheed, Varian Associates,
Watkins-Johnson, and others, are
located there. Similar companies,
such as Philco-Ford, Ampex,
Westinghouse, and General
Electric, have located in the area,
attracted by the "community of
technical scholars" envisioned by
Stanford engineering professor
Frederick Terman, who once
observed: "It is not just a
coincidence that most of this type
of research -oriented electronics
industry in the Bay Area lies
within a 15 mile circle centered at
Stanford."
At the same time, no planning
was ever undertaken by Stanford
to house the thousands of workers
attracted to the Palo Alto area by
its industrial growth.
(2) What role hus this land use
policy played in creating the
current housing crisis? As of
January, 1 9G9, the Industrial Park
employed 17 ,930 people,
generating a demand for 13,37(1
units of housing (2/3 of Palo
Alto's 20,000 units). The total
demand generated by Stanford's
professional and commercial land
development policies would fill
4/5 of Palo Alto's total housing. If
we add to this the need for 8 , 65 4
units generated by Stanford's
12,000 full- and part-time
employees, and the additional
need for 3,282 units of
off-campus student housing, then
it is clear that there are not
enough homes in all.of Palo Alto
to satisfy the housing demand
created by Stanford alone!
(3) What are Stanford's current
development activities? Stanford
land is currently being used for
two development projects: the
Coyote Hill project; and
Dillingham's Palo Alto Square, at
the corner of Page Mill and El
Camino. Coyote Hill is the first of
the foothills overlooking the
campus. When fully developed, it
will bring 3000 to 5 000 new
workers to Palo Alto. Fairchild
Corporation has already begun
construction of its semi-conductor
plant there. Other firms had
planned to build there as well, but
a pending conflict-of-interest
lawsuit has scared away their
financing, at least for the time
being. However, Stanford has
already spent $2 million for roads

on Coyote Hill, so we may expect
the University to seek other firms.
Dillingham, the other project on
Stanford land, will bring 1500
new workers into the area.
(4) Whut is Stanford, doing to
help solve the housing crisis?
"Stanford trustees have
designated the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition as sponsor and
developer for approximately 200
units of low and moderate income
housing to be located on Stanford
land." (Stanford Daily, 9 /29 /70,
p. 1). While any construction of
low income housing is, in itself, a
positive action, it is obvious from
what we have already discussed
that 200 units of low moderate
income ho ising is not even a drop
in the bucket. It is also clear that
Stanford's current development
programs, discussed above, are
generating just by themselves a
need for many times 200 units of
housing. The Wright Committee
on Housing, which last May
recommended to the University's
trustees that Stanford begin
development of 000 to 2000 units
(not 2 00 ), stated that "alternative
A (that the University sponsor a
single trial development of limited
size, with no further commitment
at this time) would suggest a kind
of tokenism that might expose the
University to the charge of
hypocrisy; it would seem to
indicate no serious intention to
help solve a major problem which
the University has helped to
create."
The reasons for the Tenants'
Union's coming to Stanford are
evident. Stanford's land use in the
past and now, has created and is
continuing to exacerbate a very
severe housing shortage.
Stanford's "commitment" to
helping solve the crisis is utter
tokenism, especially in the
context of the fact that, in the
words of the Wright Committee,
"no further commitment at this
time" is even contemplated!
Clearly, Stanford will not
really begin to meet its
responsibilities in the area of
housing, unless it is forced to do

will continue to fight for adequate
and decent housing in this area for
