## Call For Aid the 						uaw

(The following is the text of a press release from the United Auto
Workers.)
As the strike against General Motors entered its third week,
officials of the United Auto Workers Union announced that members
who walked off their jobs September 15 , in a dispute pver wages and
working conditions across the nation, will welcome the support and
assistance of students and other members of the academic
communities.
"We reject the 'hard-hat' philosophy which condemns the student
community and its efforts for peace and justice for everyone," said
the Union's Western Director, Paul Schrade. "That's the
Nixon-Reagan line and we oppose it."
The union's president, Leonard Woodcock has said that UAW will
continue to strike in the old-fashioned way, if the $120 million
international strike fund oecomes totally drained, by continuing
without benefits until General Motors agrees to terms on a new pact.
The union pays strikers a maximum weekly benefit of $40, plus the
cost of hospital, medical and surgical insurance. With 360,000 General
Motors workers on strike, the fund would be emptied in about six
weeks.
"That's an eventuality we've got to prepare for," said Schrade,
"and that's where the student community can make its greatest
contribution.
"Students in universities and colleges throughout California can
give legal and other types of assistance to strikers, collect money and
food, and conduct informational campaigns on campuses throughout
the state."
General Motors is the world's largest industrial corporation and
regards itself as all-powerful, according to Schrade. "GM respects only
the power of the dollar. We intend to reintroduce that corporation to
people power.
"Members of our union began that process," Schrade said, "by
closing GM factories across the nation. The economic reality of the
situation is this: General Motors will not build one more car until they
agree to a contract which is acceptable to their workers."
Schrade indicated that the Alliance for Labor Action (ALA), has
assigned Jim Kosik, a UAW member who is also a student, to
coordinate student community activities during the GM strike.
