"Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
My husband has a snore that could out-honk
the loudest fog horn in San Francisco Ray. Hut I
could never resort to the traditional pushing,
hitting and shouting "Wake up!"
So while awake one snore-filled night, 1
proceeded to gently stroke the underside of his
scrotum. Suddenly the snoring stopped, he
exhaled a sigh of contentment and that was the
last of the snoring. Since then 1 have done it a
number of times and it almost always works.
We were wondering if you had any ideas about
why it works."
ANSWER: A member of my research staff
informed me she deals with her problem snorer by
sighing loudly near his ear. His snoring stops
because he apparently incorporates her sighs into
his dreams and changes his breathing pattern. Your
method is probably effective for the same reason.
My apprentice told me she had tried your
technique successfully with her old man (who
happened to be in the room during our
conversation). He was genuinely surprised and
turned beet-red. "Yes," she said to him, "I've tried
it for the past few weeks and it usually works."
Well, I'm sure many more people will be tickled
by your suggestion and those who sleep more
soundly as a result will consider it a stroke of
genius.
"Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
I lea.*ned through your column that processed
yogurt may sometimes cause cataracts of the eyes.
But my weakness is yogurt. Could you recommend
the brand which would be least harmful?"
ANSWER: I reported a study from Science which
found that rats fed nothing but commercially
prepared yogurt all developed cataracts. Few
humans, though, would choose to eat an all-yogurt
diet and no case of cataracts in humans has ever
been traced to excessive yogurt consumption.

The yogurt study was discussed only to
emphasize that too much of anything may be
harmful (almost anything, anyway). Immediately
after writing that column I ate and thoroughly
enjoyed a generous serving of commercially
prepared yogurt.
"Dear Dr. Hip:
I have heard various stories regarding mescaline
and peyote use, the most prevalent being that it
absorbs your bone marrow.
Is this a fact or a fallacy?
ANSWER: A fantasy. Any psychedelic may
precipitate a bad trip (such as imagining your bone
marrow is being absorbed) but physical harm has
not been reported from these drugs.
Believing you have mescaline may itself be a
fantasy since recent analyses of street drugs have
shown the "mescaline" is usually an entirely
different drug—such as STP or LSD.
"Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
The recent letter about acne struck a responsive
chord in me because I've had this condition for 21
years. (I'm a 31-year-old vegetarian mother of 2.)
1 use hexachlorophene lotion to wash my face
and when I wear makeup (ick) 1 choose a type
that's supposed to be for problem skin. The closest
1 ever came to complete remission was when 1
went to the mountains for a week. The dry clean
air and good vibes really cleared it up.
I've heard that dermatologists dose you up with
antibiotics and ointments, give you a diet which
bans all your favorite foods and sock you with a
big bill. But they can't give you a bottle of clean
air."

proceeded to gently stroke the underside of his
scrotum. Suddenly the snoring stopped, he
exhaled a sigh of contentment and that was the
last of the snoring. Since then 1 have done it a
number of times and it almost always works.
We were wondering if you had any ideas about
why it works."
ANSWER: A member of my research staff
informed me she deals with her problem snorer by
sighing loudly near his ear. His snoring stops
because he apparently incorporates her sighs into
his dreams and changes his breathing pattern. Your
method is probably effective for the same reason.
My apprentice told me she had tried your
technique successfully with her old man (who
happened to be in the room during our
conversation). He was genuinely surprised and
turned beet-red. "Yes," she said to him, "I've tried
it for the past few weeks and it usually works."
Well, I'm sure many more people will be tickled
by your suggestion and those who sleep more
soundly as a result will consider it a stroke of
genius.
"Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
I lea.*ned through your column that processed
yogurt may sometimes cause cataracts of the eyes.
But my weakness is yogurt. Could you recommend
the brand which would be least harmful?"
ANSWER: I reported a study from Science which
found that rats fed nothing but commercially
prepared yogurt all developed cataracts. Few
humans, though, would choose to eat an all-yogurt
diet and no case of cataracts in humans has ever
been traced to excessive yogurt consumption.

The yogurt study was discussed only to
emphasize that too much of anything may be
harmful (almost anything, anyway). Immediately
after writing that column I ate and thoroughly
enjoyed a generous serving of commercially
prepared yogurt.
"Dear Dr. Hip:
I have heard various stories regarding mescaline
and peyote use, the most prevalent being that it
absorbs your bone marrow.
Is this a fact or a fallacy?
ANSWER: A fantasy. Any psychedelic may
precipitate a bad trip (such as imagining your bone
marrow is being absorbed) but physical harm has
not been reported from these drugs.
Believing you have mescaline may itself be a
fantasy since recent analyses of street drugs have
shown the "mescaline" is usually an entirely
different drug—such as STP or LSD.
"Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
The recent letter about acne struck a responsive
chord in me because I've had this condition for 21
years. (I'm a 31-year-old vegetarian mother of 2.)
1 use hexachlorophene lotion to wash my face
and when I wear makeup (ick) 1 choose a type
that's supposed to be for problem skin. The closest
1 ever came to complete remission was when 1
went to the mountains for a week. The dry clean
air and good vibes really cleared it up.
I've heard that dermatologists dose you up with
antibiotics and ointments, give you a diet which
bans all your favorite foods and sock you with a
big bill. But they can't give you a bottle of clean
air."

"Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
