# Birth Control Pill Use 'Normal' Health Center Director Reports
## 
### DOUGLAS BARR 
Stanford jjirls do not use birth
control pills more than would be
expected. The Director of Co well
Student Health Center, Dr. James
McClenahan, said, "In terms of
the community in general, the use
of the pill seems to be a normal
amount."
From 1 9 62 to 1 9 70, the pill
could only be prescribed at
Cowell for students either
married, about to be married
(within 60 days), or aged 21.
Stanford girls who needed the pill
went to Planned Parenthood in
Palo Alto. Mrs. Albert, director of
Planned Parent,hood's voluntarily
staffed clinics, said that Stanford
girls are welcome there for
pregnancy tests; she prefers that
they not come for contraceptive
care, considering Co well's new
policy and Planned Parenthood's
overcrowding.
Policy Changed
Cowell's policy was changed on
January 13 th, 1 970 , following an
18-month study on the legality of
prescribing the pill for minors.
The policy now reads:
"The Cowell Student Health
Center offers contraceptive care
to all registered students who
request it. The care includes
counseling and advising on
matters of contraception, and
examination and prescription of
contraceptive medication or
devices as indicated. Regular
follow-up care is also provided.
"As most students can be
considered as emancipated
minors, that is they are 15 years
of age or older and living away
from home and managing their
own financial affairs, a student,
herself, can give permission for

this type of examination and
treatment. As with other medical
and psychiatric care provided by
the Stanford Student Health
Center, contraceptive care is
conducted on the basis of an
individual relationship between
the patient and doctor and is
considered confidential."
Doctor as Adviser
Getting the pill at Cowell
means discussion and consultation
with the doctor about birth
control and the pill's possible
dangers. The second visit is for a
Pap smear testâ€”a necessary
standard cell test for cervical
cancer; if the results are negative,
a prescription is given, usually for
one of three brands of
low-estrogen pills.

No test is given for gonorrhea
or syphilis unless requested or
some indications show that it is
needed.
Counseling is free; Pap smear
evaluation averages about $7.50;
pills cost $2-3.00 per month. In
comparison, a diaphragm or
inter-uterine device (lUD) cost a
single fee of ten to fifteen dollars.
Students will generally need to
pay for treatment, as most
medical insurance does not cover
birth control.
