# 1100 Alumni To Feel Bill Collecting Pinch
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Over 1 4 00 students and former
students—those more than one year
delinquent in repaying their
government-funded National Defense
Student Loans—will be affected by the
hiring of professional collection
agencies. "About $458,000" is
involved, according to Joseph Jedd,
Student Accounting Manager.
The decision to retain two collection
agencies, described by Director of
Financial Aids Robert P. Huff as "the
price of federal support," was ratified
by the Board of Trustees at their
September meeting. It is the first time
the University has employed any
agency or attorney to collect student
loans.
The National Defense Student Loan
Program is the largest in operation here,
with almost $12 million loaned out to
over 1 0,000 students. The federal
government supplies 9 0 percent of the
funds used, the remainder of which
comes from the University. As a
participant in the program, the
University agreed to pursue delinquent
loans with "due diligence," which
includes turning delinquent loans over
to a bill collector, according to a 1967
government directive.
HEW Audits Critical
Although failure to comply with the
directive could have resulted in
suspension or termination of the
program here, the University did not
act until two highly critical audits were
made by the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare. Even now,
accounts will not be turned over to the
bill collectors unless they are over one
year delinquent, despite the
government's recommendation of only
1 20 days of waiting.
No Blood from Turnips
Finally, careful screenings by the
Controller's Office, Financial Aids
Office, and Accounting Department
prevented any "hardship" cases from
being turned over to the bill collectors.
"We gave them accounts that we n-allv

exhausted," Jedd said. "You can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip if the guy
doesn't have it."
As a result of this low-pressure
approach, a few accounts have been
delinquent for over twenty years. But
there are indications that even the
comparatively high-pressure approach
of the collection agencies (which were
thoroughly investigated as to ethics
before selection) will not be a
resounding success.
So far, the agencies have been
assigned a total of sixty cases. They
have collected exactly $10— $3.34 of
which were repaid to them as
commissions. ,
