# Cross Recovers
## Injured Will Return 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
With stringent security
precautions prevailing at a closed
Stanford Stadium, Stanford's
football team held its final heavy
workout yesterday in preparation
for Saturday's giant with USC.
The workout lasted a little less
than two hours and was
highlighted by some crisp hard
hits. Special emphasis was placed
on goal line defense and the
kicking game. Coach John Ralston
termed it, "A typical Wednesday
workout."
Having shaken off an
assortment of pulled muscles,
bruises and ankle injuries, the
Indians are expected to be at
nearly full strength for the game.
Following the Purdue debacle a
quarter of the team's starters had
been sidelined with injuries.
Jack Back?
But yesterday only split end
Jack Lasater was held out of the
workout. Lasater sprained his
ankle in the third quarter of the
Purdue game and is still doubtful
for the game. Still, Lasater, a
senior, has been invoked in the
last two heartbreakers to SC and
if he possibly can, he will play.
The biggest news on the injury
front is the dramatic recovery of
return specialist Eric Cross. Cross,
who has run back 1 3 punts for
190 yards and nine kickoffs for
2 32 yards, suffered a contusion in
his right thigh against Purdue and
was not expected to play
Saturday. But he has responded
quicker than expected to
treatment and should be almost at
full speed for the game.

On defense,tackle Dave Tipton,
who missed the Purdue game with
a deep shoulder bruise, is back in
the starting lineup. But
linebackers, Mike Simone and
lion Kadziel who were both out
last week with charley horse
problems are not yet fully
recovered.
Both Simone and Kadziel
worked out yesterday and will see
action this weekend. If they are
unable to start, Dennis Moore and
Tom Sones will take over for
them as they did a week ago.
Defensive back Mike Ewing is also
recovering well from a hamstring
injury, but Charles McLoud will
continue to start at his left
halfback spot.
On offense, the only other
problem had been tackle Steve
Jubb's bruised back which kept
him out of the Purdue game, but
he will start and should be at full
strength.
USC Healthy
Down in Los Angeles only one
starter is reported to be sidelined.
Giant defensive tackel Tody
Smith (6 -5 247) a member of last
year's "Wild Bunch" has missed
the last two games with a ankle
injury suffered against Nebraska.
His replacement, John Grant,
bruised his knee against Oregon
State last Saturday, but is still
expected to start.
Today the Cards will abandon
their full pads and work out in
shorts. The hour to hour and a
quarter practice will emphasize
the special teams and the two
minute offense. After today's

final whistle, the Cards will have
about 4 4 hours in which to
prepare their minds for the biggest
test, both physically and
emotionally, they will face all
season.

'SPLIT' END—Jack Lasater lounges on the Stanford bench last week after spraining his ankle on ; the
sideline pass late in the first half. Jack hasn't been in regular drills this week but has been frisking on the
sidelines and will probably see some action, at least, against USC. The senior receiver missed much of his
sophomore year with a shoulder injury and had it tightened up again surgically last spring.


THK FOE —Clarence Davis, the Pacific-B's leading rusher averaging
I 00.8 yards per game, heads (JSC's blockbuster ground attack which
has been cranking out 343 yards per game through four games.
Whether the Indians can stop USC runners is undoubtedly a
significant factor in Saturday's game; even if they do, they'll have to
contend with the able passing of Jimmy Jones, too. And while we're
on the subject of football, the athletic ticket office says Monday will
be the last day rooter tickers will be sold for the UCLA game in Los
Angeles. The office is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. today, Friday
and Monday.
