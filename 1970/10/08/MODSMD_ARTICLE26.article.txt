INDIAN POWER—Phantom
beings in the Los Angeles area,
sporting shorn heads to preserve
their invisibility in greater society
and working underground to
subvert the oppressive athletic
domination of a major private
institution within the Los Angeles
city limits, have been assaulting
the advertising power structure
recently with revolutionary zeal
and coyness. The anonymous
raiders claim, however, that
bureaucratic lackeys in control of
society have stepped up their
program of ecological disaster in
an effect to hide the revolutionary
acts from the people in swirls of
smog. But aside from that
insidious attack on the air of the
people, there have as yet been no
retaliations from the capitalist
establishments against which the
attack was indirectly directed.
