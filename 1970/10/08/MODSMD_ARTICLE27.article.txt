New Radical Offensive

NEW YORK — A tape recording said to be made by a
leader of the radical Weatherman group promises a "fall
offensive of youth resistance that will spread from Santa
Barbara to Boston, back to Kent and Kansas."
The voice on the tape was identified as that of
Bernardine Dohrn, fugitive leader of the group, by her
sister, Jennifer, at the headquarters of the Youth
International Party—Yippies—here, where the recording was
played for the press Tuesday. According to the tape, the
offensive began with the bombing of the police statue in
Chicago's Haymarket Square Monday.
"Now we are everywhere and next week families and
tribes will attack the enemy around the country," the voice
said.
The recording was received Tuesday, postmarked from
Chicago Monday, according to Yippie leader Jerry Rubin,
one of the Chicago 7 trial defendants.

Black Panther Shift

WASHINGTON — The Black Panther Party has changed its
emphasis from fighting racism to fighting capitalism, a
former editor of the Panthers' newspaper testified
Wednesday.
The target shift occurred, Frank B. Jones told a House
subcommittee investigating the Panthers, "because they
came to feel capitalism is the over all problem that causes
racism."
Jones, 31, operator of a bookstore in Richmond, Calif.,
joined the party in May 1968 after conversations with Huey
Newton, he said, "because I felt it was doing something
that needed to be done combatting racism."
He left the party in May 1 969, Jones related, "because it
was no longer emphasizing racism; it started opposing
capitalism."
When the Panthers changed "from a paramilitary,
self-defense organization to a political party," he said,
"there was a party purge to remove anyone who didn't
make an attempt to understand the political movives."

Egypt Adopts Hard Line

CAIRO — Egypt's National Assembly nominated Acting
President Anwar Sadat for a full six year term as president
Wednesday and pledged the new leadership would follow
the policies of Gamal Abdel Nasser.
However, there were indications in Cairo and elsewhere
that Nasser's successors were taking a tougher line toward
the United States and Israel than the late Egyptian
president took.

In Beirut, newspapers of both the right and the left
noted a tougher Egyptian stance.
"Egypt Stiffens After Nasser," declared the banner
headline in the right-wing Lebanese newspaper Al Nahar.
The independent right wing newspaper Al Hayat noted the
"beginning of a crisis between the United States and Egypt
after Nasser."
Travelers from Cairo reported in Beirut on Wednesday
they had seen brisk military activity on the Egyptian side of
the Suez Canal.

Bolivian Leftists Win

LA PAZ, Bolivia — Leftist Gen. Juan Jose Torres swept to
power Wednesday with a show of force that toppled his
rightist opponents. He promised cheering crowds that as
president he would give Bolivia "a popular nationalist
government."
Gen. Rogelio Miranda, the conservative army chief of
staff who forced President Alfredo Ovando Candia to resign
Tuesday, was said to have taken refuge in a foreign embassy
along with two members of his junta.
Torres' government appeared to have solid support from
students, farmers, workers and powerful segments of the
armed forces.
Thus Bolivia followed the pattern of a leftist military
regime that took over in Peru in 1 968. And Chile's
president-elect is Salvador Allende, the first Marxist to be
elected in Latin America. Bolivia, Peru and Chile are
bounded by Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, where military
rightist regimes are in power.

Diplomat Still Held

MONTREAL — A note believed to be from the abductors
of British diplomat James Richard Cross set a Thursday
noon deadline for meeting ransom demands, police
reported Wednesday night. An accompanying letter in
Cross' name said he was well.
Cross was seized at his home Monday by representatives
of the Quebec Liberation Front, which scorns British
influence in Canada and seeks to make the Province of
Quebec a separate nation.
The Liberation Front, known as FLQ, demanded
$5 00,000 in gold bullion and the release of 21 men it
described as political prisoners, so they could go to Cuba or
Algeria. Some of these men were arrested in connection
with FLQ activities, which have included various bombings
since 1 963.
The federal government, in collaboration with the
Quebec government, decided Tuesday to reject the ransom
demands.
