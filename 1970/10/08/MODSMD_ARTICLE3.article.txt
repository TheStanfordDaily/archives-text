## Ad Condemns 'Daily' Judgment 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
In a full-page advertisement inside
today's Daily, over 170 people in the
Stanford community
"declare . . . contempt" for the Daily's
publication last Friday of the column
"Snitches and Oppression" (see page
3).
The advertisement goes on to say,
"There is a recurring question whether
the Daily might not become a more
responsible voice if, like its
counterparts at Harvard and Yale, it
were deprived of institutional support
and had to earn the respect of
voluntary subscribers.
"While the signers of this statement
are not prepared to collectively urge
that the Daily be made independent,
the irresponsibility demonstrated by
the readers in this instance provides yet
another reason to re-examine the
relationship."
The advertisement has been signed
by professors and students from widely
ranging areas of the Stanford
community.

Explaining the reasons for its
publication, the advertisement states,
"Even a newspaper with a protected
financial base and a guaranteed
circulation needs the respect of its
readers to be effective, and in the long
run the Daily will respond to the
standards to which it is held by the
community."
Donald Kennedy, biology professor
and head of the department of
biological sciences, explained to the
Daily last night that he wanted "to
bring the pressure of community
opinion" on the Daily.
Kennedy added that he did not
believe there should be any "outside
control" exercised on the Daily's
editorial policy "within the bounds of a
standard," unless a "ridiculous
scenario" existed. Kennedy said that if
"there were an infinite series of the
kind of thing that ran on
Friday . . . and no responsiveness on
the part of the editors," control would
evolve "from the courts."
Herald Gunther, a law professor who
signed the advertisement, said "I would

much rather see the Daily operating
completely independently."
Gunther maintained that "the
advocacy of illegal action ought not to
be permitted," particularly when
"focused so as to convey a sense of
immediacy and the encouragement of a
specific action in a specific context."
The column in question, written by
Revolutionary Union member
Diarmuid McGuire, describes methods
of punishment applied to "snitches" in
jail, names two individuals on the
Stanford campus as "snitches," and
finally exhorts "Take care of snitches."
According to .James Siena, legal
adviser to President Lyman, members
of the president's office have consulted
among themselves concerning legal
problems raised by the article's
publication, but have not as yet called
for advice outside the University.
