From the Associated Press
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 - President
Nixon tonight proposed a standstill
cease-fire throughout Southeast Asia,
the immediate release of all prisoners of
war, and a broad international
conference to seek a settlement of the
Indochinese War.
In making several departures from
the previous American bargaining
position, the President said he hoped
his plan would "break the log-jam in all
the negotiations."
An administration official who
refused to be identified indicated that
the President was hopeful that his
suggestions will trigger renewed
exploration at the Paris peace talks.
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
spokesmen offered no immediate
comment on the new proposals.
Nixon, claiming "full support" of
the South Vietnamese, Cambodian and
Laotian governments, said in the
nationwide radio-television address:
"The time has come for the
government of North Vietnam to join
its neighbors in a proposal to quit
making war and to start making peace."
POW Release
The President asserted that the
United States is prepared to negotiate a
complete withdrawal of American
troops as part' of any settlement.
Officials indicated that the pullout
would be completed over a 12-month
period once an agreement is reached.
Nixon also advocated "the
immediate and unconditional release of
all prisoners of war held by both sides,"
declaring that such moves would "serve
to establish good faith, the intent to
make progress, and thus improve the
prospects for negotiation."
The fifth major point in the
President's plan, which will be
presented at the peace talks Thursday
by chief U.S. negotiator David K.E.
Bruce, calls on North Vietnam to
recognize that there are two sides to
the conflict in the South and that any
meaningful settlement must satisfy
both.
Thieu, Ky
The President employed tough
language only once during his
15-minute address. Referring to Viet
Cong suggestions reiterated in Paris as

recently as two weeks ago that would
rule out continued officeholding by
South Vietnamese President Thieu and
Vice President Ky, Nixon said:
"Let there be no mistake about one
essential point: the other side is not
merely objecting to a few personalities.
They want to dismantle the organized
non-Communist forces and insure the
takeover by one party, and they
demand the right to exclude whomever
they wish from government.
"This patently unreasonable demand
is totally unacceptable," he said.
Vietnamese Self-determination
While asserting that the United
States is prepared to be flexible on
many issues, the President said:
"We stand firm for the right of all
South Vietnamese people to determine
for themselves the kind of government
they want."
Nixon said the cease-fire he is
seeking "must be effectively supervised
by international observers" and that
safeguards against violations should be
provided.
"I propose that all armed forces
throughout Indochina cease firing their
weapons and remain in the positions
they now hold. This would be a
'cease-fire in place.' It would not in
itself be an end to the conflict, but it
would accomplish one goal all of us
have been working for: an end to the
killing," the President said.
Russia Notified
In the past, North Vietnam and the
Viet Cong have rejected a military
solution before a political settlement is
agreed upon.
Through diplomatic channels, Russia
was given advance word earlier in the
day of the general content of the
President's address. United States
officials recalled that last year Deputy
Soviet Foreign Minister Jacob Malik
spoke approvingly of a possible new
Geneva conference to deal with the
Vietnam War.
"An international conference is
needed to deal with the conflict in all
three states of Indochina," the
President said.
Larger Conference
"While we pursue the convening of
an Indochina peace conference, we will

continue negotiations in Paris. Our
proposal for a larger conference can be
discussed there as well as through other
diplomatic channels," the President
said.
Nixon indicated that troop
withdrawals would not be speeded up
from his present timetable, which
permits about 280,000 troops to
remain in South Vietnam after May,
1971 as part of the Vietnamization
plan.
Withdrawal Timetable
However, the President added:
"We are ready to negotiate an agreed
timetable for complete withdrawals as
part of an overall settlement. We are
prepared to withdraw all our forces as
part of a settlement based on the
principles I spelled out previously and
the proposals I am making tonight."
The President said that the United
States would be guided by three
principles in seeking a political
settlement:
—"We seek a political solution that
reflects the will of the South
Vietnamese people.
— "A fair political solution that

would reflect the existing relationship
of political forces.
—"We will abide by the outcome of
the political processes agreed upon."
Enthusiastic Reaction
Capitol Hill reacted enthusiastically
to the President's speech. Senate
Democratic leader Mike Mansfield, a
strong critic of United States
Indochinese policies, termed the speech
"an excellent statement."
"I approve of it," Mansfield said. "I
will do my very best to support it."
Republican Senate leader Hugh
Scott said that the President "has
written a new chapter in the diplomatic
history of the United States with his
bold move to end this unpopular war,
to establish peace in Southeast Asia,
and to reach a political settlement."
Senator John Sherman Cooper, one
of the authors of the Cooper-Church
Amendment to limit U.S. involvement
in Cambodia, said the Nixon plan was
"comprehensive and fair."
"The immediate stopping of all
warfare and killing and the exchange of
prisoners of war are humane and
difficult to be refused before the
world," he said.
