# Unruh: Reagan Stacks State Ecology Board
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Jess Unruh charged here today that
several Reagan appointees to a State
Commission for protecting the
California coast and beaches "have
direct interests in exploiting the very
areas they are supposed to be
preserving."
The Democratic gubernatorial
candidate said Reagan was "not a
public servant, but a handmaiden of
private interests, and a willing one at
that." Unruh supported his accusations
by citing the case of the California
Advisory Commission on Marine and
Coastal Resources.
The Assemblyman noted that
Preston Hotchkiss, one of the
Commissioners appointed by Reagan,
had an executive in his company lobby
against a coastal zoning bill which
would have affected his Bixby Ranch
Co. land development in Orange
County.
Companies Named
Other appointees included
employees of Chevron Oil Co., Kaiser

Refactories, Todd Shipyard, San Diego
Gas and Electric Co., Bechtel Corp.,
The Washington Fish and Oyster Corp.
and The Dillingham Corp., Unruh
stated.
The mention of Dillingham evoked
boos and hissing from the Tresidder
audience of about 300 people.
Dillingham Corp. plans to build a
controversial financial center at the
corner of El Camino Real and Page Mill
Road.
"It wasn't through his appointments
alone that Reagan sandbagged the
Commission. Reagan's budgets during
the last three years have allocated
token funds only to the Commission."
Unruh continued.
He quoted a letter from the
Commission Chairman, Robert Kreeger,
which stated, "The Commission has not
in the past been able to comply with its
statuatory responsibilities due to lack
of funds."
'Utterly Failed'
The letter also said the Commission
"utterly failed to undertake a
comprehensive investigation and study
of the coastal environment."
Unruh commented that California
needs a State Zoning Authority, a
masterplan to govern future
modifications of state coastlines, and
an interim authority to "freeze"
current projects which might damage
coastal areas. He promised to
implement these measures "as soon as I
get elected."
The Democratic hopeful also
believes that recent bills to protect the
coastlines, including Unruh's own bill
to ban off shore oil drilling, died in the
Republican - dominated Assembly on
orders from Reagan.
Re-election Money
He charged that the principle
financiers of the Governor's re-election
campaign are "the land speculators and
the oil men and the mining men."
Unruh holds that these men support
Reagan because they hope to delay
state and federal legislation which
would control private exploitation of
coastlines and tidal lands. "They have

Ronald Reagan," he stated. The
address by Unruh, billed in advance by
his spokesmen as a "major statement
on environmental policy," was delayed
for about a half-hour due to the late
arrival of the Assemblyman and the
aggressiveness of news cameramen
outside Tresidder.

one hope for delay, and that hope is
Ronald Reagan," he stated. The
address by Unruh, billed in advance by
his spokesmen as a "major statement
on environmental policy," was delayed
for about a half-hour due to the late
arrival of the Assemblyman and the
aggressiveness of news cameramen
outside Tresidder.
Jess Unruh charged here today that
several Reagan appointees to a State
Commission for protecting the
California coast and beaches "have
direct interests in exploiting the very
areas they are supposed to be
preserving."
The Democratic gubernatorial
candidate said Reagan was "not a
public servant, but a handmaiden of
private interests, and a willing one at
that." Unruh supported his accusations
by citing the case of the California
Advisory Commission on Marine and
Coastal Resources.
The Assemblyman noted that
Preston Hotchkiss, one of the
Commissioners appointed by Reagan,
had an executive in his company lobby
against a coastal zoning bill which
would have affected his Bixby Ranch
Co. land development in Orange
County.
Companies Named
Other appointees included
employees of Chevron Oil Co., Kaiser

Refactories, Todd Shipyard, San Diego
Gas and Electric Co., Bechtel Corp.,
The Washington Fish and Oyster Corp.
and The Dillingham Corp., Unruh
stated.
The mention of Dillingham evoked
boos and hissing from the Tresidder
audience of about 300 people.
Dillingham Corp. plans to build a
controversial financial center at the
corner of El Camino Real and Page Mill
Road.
"It wasn't through his appointments
alone that Reagan sandbagged the
Commission. Reagan's budgets during
the last three years have allocated
token funds only to the Commission."
Unruh continued.
He quoted a letter from the
Commission Chairman, Robert Kreeger,
which stated, "The Commission has not
in the past been able to comply with its
statuatory responsibilities due to lack
of funds."
'Utterly Failed'
The letter also said the Commission
"utterly failed to undertake a
comprehensive investigation and study
of the coastal environment."
Unruh commented that California
needs a State Zoning Authority, a
masterplan to govern future
modifications of state coastlines, and
an interim authority to "freeze"
current projects which might damage
coastal areas. He promised to
implement these measures "as soon as I
get elected."
The Democratic hopeful also
believes that recent bills to protect the
coastlines, including Unruh's own bill
to ban off shore oil drilling, died in the
Republican - dominated Assembly on
orders from Reagan.
Re-election Money
He charged that the principle
financiers of the Governor's re-election
campaign are "the land speculators and
the oil men and the mining men."
Unruh holds that these men support
Reagan because they hope to delay
state and federal legislation which
would control private exploitation of
coastlines and tidal lands. "They have
