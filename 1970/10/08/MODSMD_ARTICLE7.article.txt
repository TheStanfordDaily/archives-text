# Daily' Details Stance On McGuire Column
## 
### 
The majority of the Daily staff has decided
that it was wrong to print D. McGuire's column as it
ran in last Friday's paper. The article contained
passages that could be construed as threatening the
lives of two named individuals—and for that reason
we think it falls outside the broad boundaries of
what can justly be expressed.
We believe an individual has a right to advocate
the idea of violence and revolution. There will
continue to be a place for such expression in the
Daily's opinion pages.
We do not believe, however, that he has the
right to incite individuals to a specific criminal act.
For this reason we are declaring today a Daily
policy that letters or columns containing such
incitements will not be printed. Any such references
must be removed by the author before we will allow
the rest of the column to be published.
We wish to emphasize, however that our
decision on this matter did not come easily. The
issues involved cannot be drawn as simply as
President Lyman has sought to do in the past few
days. This is not an issue where one position can be
branded as responsible and the other irresponsible.
For, when the question of free expression is
involved, as it is here, the answer is never easily
found.
In the case of McGuire's column two
fundamental rights clash with one another. On the
one hand there is McGuire's right to be allowed to
express what he is thinking. On the other is the right
of the two individuals named to live in peace, without
the threat of murder hanging over their heads. In the
end one right has to be weighed more important.
What then should a person be kept from saying?
When is speech and expression no longer free?
Because the term "free speech" is so often
bantered about as if it meant that there is an absolute
right to say or write anything, some condemn any

attempt to put restrictions on expression.
We, however, do not think this is a reasonable
view. What if all slander and libel laws were repealed in
the name of free speech? Who, then could we believe?
And what if all of the conspiracy laws were taken
off of the statute books. How then could you
prosecute gangsters who plan "hits" but relax in
Miami Beach while their plans are carried out.
"When words are the triggers of [criminal]
actions, they fall beyond the pale of free speech,"
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once
wrote. We agree.
The statements made by McGuire could too
easily become "triggers" for muder. Therefore, we
will no longer allow such statements in the Daily.
Putting ourselves in the shoes of Ray White and Roger
Reed and attempting to maintain some degree of
sensitivity, we are forced to restrict this kind of
expression.
This editorial would have concluded here had
there been no advertisement on the facing page.
However, we feel obliged to respond to certain points
within the text of that ad which cause us concern.
First, the statement in the text of the ad that
"The editors have sought to justify their publication
of the article in the name of 'Free speech'. .." is
blatantly false. Monday's Daily carried two responses
from our editorial staff. The first expressed the
opinion of the majority of the staff that the McGuire
column should not have been printed as it was. The
second was a defence written by those who supported
the printing. The statement in the ad is clearly false.
Our second objection to the ad stems from the
statement made in it that the Daily receives "direct
subsidies from the University and forced
contributions from the students." While these
statements are technically true, they are irresponsibly
misleading.
The only financial subsidy the University has

ever given the Daily began this year. The University
now pays for the Dailys that professors receive. In
past years the students in effect paid for their
professors' papers. No objection to that condition
arose until last year when the students suddenly
found themselves unable to find enough copies of the
paper.
As for the allegation that we receive "forced
contributions from the students," it is important to
point out that the students themselves voted 3-2 to
collect this "forced" fee in an election last spring.
Like Lyman and those who have authored the
statement in the advertisement, we hope the Daily can
soon become independent of this support. We have
worked to that end for years, but have always
considered the financial uncertainties involved
prohibitive.
Our third objection to the ad focuses on its next
to last paragraph where it states, "We believe that it
lies within the power of the community to shape to a
substantial extent the policies of the Daily."
Though it is not clear what this implies, we
emphasize that the editorial position of a newspaper
cannot be dictated by the majority vote of a
community. We ask that the distinguished professors
who signed the ad ask themselves what consequences
the implications of their position would have on the
policies of the New York Times and the Washington
Post.
Our most vehement objection, however, is to the
last line of the ad where it reads that "the urging of
violence against anyone, named or un named is
intolerable in the Stanford Community." We fear that

this position would not allow us to continue to print
tracts advocating the idea of violent revolution—and
we feel such a restriction would be a dangerous blow
to free speech.
It is important that D. McGuire and the other
revolutionaries be allowed to express their opinions as
long as those opinions do not endanger another's life.
We re-emphasize that it is important to permit the
advocacy of the idea of violent revolution, but that
incitement to a specific criminal act must be censored.
We find it strange that professors within a
University that purports to be a center of free
expression advocate stricter rules governing
expression than does the U.S. Supreme Court.
Our final objection is to the tone of the entire
advertisement. The Daily is viewed as a monolithic
creature. We think that the diversity of opinion
expressed in the past and on this page should
demonstrate the injustice of that view. We are an
open paper. Anyone can work for us, and we urge
them to. Our opinion pages are open to the
commentaries of all members of the community.
And we urge all members of the community to take
advantage of this forum.
We on the Daily are not violent revolutionaries.
We think that violence is proving counterproductive
in the U.S. today, and we especially abhor it for that
reason. Still, we know a growing number of students
and Americans have taken to the path of the violent
revolutionary as D. McGuire has. We want to know
what he thinks, and we hope you do too. How can
we oppose him if we do not know what he thinks?

the idea of violence and revolution. There will
continue to be a place for such expression in the
Daily's opinion pages.
We do not believe, however, that he has the
right to incite individuals to a specific criminal act.
For this reason we are declaring today a Daily
policy that letters or columns containing such
incitements will not be printed. Any such references
must be removed by the author before we will allow
the rest of the column to be published.
We wish to emphasize, however that our
decision on this matter did not come easily. The
issues involved cannot be drawn as simply as
President Lyman has sought to do in the past few
days. This is not an issue where one position can be
branded as responsible and the other irresponsible.
For, when the question of free expression is
involved, as it is here, the answer is never easily
found.
In the case of McGuire's column two
fundamental rights clash with one another. On the
one hand there is McGuire's right to be allowed to
express what he is thinking. On the other is the right
of the two individuals named to live in peace, without
the threat of murder hanging over their heads. In the
end one right has to be weighed more important.
What then should a person be kept from saying?
When is speech and expression no longer free?
Because the term "free speech" is so often
bantered about as if it meant that there is an absolute
right to say or write anything, some condemn any

attempt to put restrictions on expression.
We, however, do not think this is a reasonable
view. What if all slander and libel laws were repealed in
the name of free speech? Who, then could we believe?
And what if all of the conspiracy laws were taken
off of the statute books. How then could you
prosecute gangsters who plan "hits" but relax in
Miami Beach while their plans are carried out.
"When words are the triggers of [criminal]
actions, they fall beyond the pale of free speech,"
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once
wrote. We agree.
The statements made by McGuire could too
easily become "triggers" for muder. Therefore, we
will no longer allow such statements in the Daily.
Putting ourselves in the shoes of Ray White and Roger
Reed and attempting to maintain some degree of
sensitivity, we are forced to restrict this kind of
expression.
This editorial would have concluded here had
there been no advertisement on the facing page.
However, we feel obliged to respond to certain points
within the text of that ad which cause us concern.
First, the statement in the text of the ad that
"The editors have sought to justify their publication
of the article in the name of 'Free speech'. .." is
blatantly false. Monday's Daily carried two responses
from our editorial staff. The first expressed the
opinion of the majority of the staff that the McGuire
column should not have been printed as it was. The
second was a defence written by those who supported
the printing. The statement in the ad is clearly false.
Our second objection to the ad stems from the
statement made in it that the Daily receives "direct
subsidies from the University and forced
contributions from the students." While these
statements are technically true, they are irresponsibly
misleading.
The only financial subsidy the University has

ever given the Daily began this year. The University
now pays for the Dailys that professors receive. In
past years the students in effect paid for their
professors' papers. No objection to that condition
arose until last year when the students suddenly
found themselves unable to find enough copies of the
paper.
As for the allegation that we receive "forced
contributions from the students," it is important to
point out that the students themselves voted 3-2 to
collect this "forced" fee in an election last spring.
Like Lyman and those who have authored the
statement in the advertisement, we hope the Daily can
soon become independent of this support. We have
worked to that end for years, but have always
considered the financial uncertainties involved
prohibitive.
Our third objection to the ad focuses on its next
to last paragraph where it states, "We believe that it
lies within the power of the community to shape to a
substantial extent the policies of the Daily."
Though it is not clear what this implies, we
emphasize that the editorial position of a newspaper
cannot be dictated by the majority vote of a
community. We ask that the distinguished professors
who signed the ad ask themselves what consequences
the implications of their position would have on the
policies of the New York Times and the Washington
Post.
Our most vehement objection, however, is to the
last line of the ad where it reads that "the urging of
violence against anyone, named or un named is
intolerable in the Stanford Community." We fear that

this position would not allow us to continue to print
tracts advocating the idea of violent revolution—and
we feel such a restriction would be a dangerous blow
to free speech.
It is important that D. McGuire and the other
revolutionaries be allowed to express their opinions as
long as those opinions do not endanger another's life.
We re-emphasize that it is important to permit the
advocacy of the idea of violent revolution, but that
incitement to a specific criminal act must be censored.
We find it strange that professors within a
University that purports to be a center of free
expression advocate stricter rules governing
expression than does the U.S. Supreme Court.
Our final objection is to the tone of the entire
advertisement. The Daily is viewed as a monolithic
creature. We think that the diversity of opinion
expressed in the past and on this page should
demonstrate the injustice of that view. We are an
open paper. Anyone can work for us, and we urge
them to. Our opinion pages are open to the
commentaries of all members of the community.
And we urge all members of the community to take
advantage of this forum.
We on the Daily are not violent revolutionaries.
We think that violence is proving counterproductive
in the U.S. today, and we especially abhor it for that
reason. Still, we know a growing number of students
and Americans have taken to the path of the violent
revolutionary as D. McGuire has. We want to know
what he thinks, and we hope you do too. How can
we oppose him if we do not know what he thinks?
The majority of the Daily staff has decided
that it was wrong to print D. McGuire's column as it
ran in last Friday's paper. The article contained
passages that could be construed as threatening the
lives of two named individuals—and for that reason
we think it falls outside the broad boundaries of
what can justly be expressed.
We believe an individual has a right to advocate
the idea of violence and revolution. There will
continue to be a place for such expression in the
Daily's opinion pages.
We do not believe, however, that he has the

the rest of the column to be published.
We wish to emphasize, however that our
decision on this matter did not come easily. The
issues involved cannot be drawn as simply as
President Lyman has sought to do in the past few
days. This is not an issue where one position can be
branded as responsible and the other irresponsible.
For, when the question of free expression is
involved, as it is here, the answer is never easily
found.
In the case of McGuire's column two
fundamental rights clash with one another. On the
one hand there is McGuire's right to be allowed to
express what he is thinking. On the other is the right
of the two individuals named to live in peace, without
the threat of murder hanging over their heads. In the
end one right has to be weighed more important.
What then should a person be kept from saying?
When is speech and expression no longer free?
Because the term "free speech" is so often
bantered about as if it meant that there is an absolute
right to say or write anything, some condemn any

attempt to put restrictions on expression.
We, however, do not think this is a reasonable
view. What if all slander and libel laws were repealed in
the name of free speech? Who, then could we believe?
And what if all of the conspiracy laws were taken
off of the statute books. How then could you
prosecute gangsters who plan "hits" but relax in
Miami Beach while their plans are carried out.
"When words are the triggers of [criminal]
actions, they fall beyond the pale of free speech,"
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once
wrote. We agree.
The statements made by McGuire could too
easily become "triggers" for muder. Therefore, we
will no longer allow such statements in the Daily.
Putting ourselves in the shoes of Ray White and Roger
Reed and attempting to maintain some degree of
sensitivity, we are forced to restrict this kind of
expression.
This editorial would have concluded here had
there been no advertisement on the facing page.
However, we feel obliged to respond to certain points
within the text of that ad which cause us concern.
First, the statement in the text of the ad that
"The editors have sought to justify their publication
of the article in the name of 'Free speech'. .." is
blatantly false. Monday's Daily carried two responses
from our editorial staff. The first expressed the
opinion of the majority of the staff that the McGuire
column should not have been printed as it was. The
second was a defence written by those who supported
the printing. The statement in the ad is clearly false.
Our second objection to the ad stems from the
statement made in it that the Daily receives "direct
subsidies from the University and forced
contributions from the students." While these
statements are technically true, they are irresponsibly
misleading.
The only financial subsidy the University has

ever given the Daily began this year. The University
now pays for the Dailys that professors receive. In
past years the students in effect paid for their
professors' papers. No objection to that condition
arose until last year when the students suddenly
found themselves unable to find enough copies of the
paper.
As for the allegation that we receive "forced
contributions from the students," it is important to
point out that the students themselves voted 3-2 to
collect this "forced" fee in an election last spring.
Like Lyman and those who have authored the
statement in the advertisement, we hope the Daily can
soon become independent of this support. We have
worked to that end for years, but have always
considered the financial uncertainties involved
prohibitive.
Our third objection to the ad focuses on its next
to last paragraph where it states, "We believe that it
lies within the power of the community to shape to a
substantial extent the policies of the Daily."
Though it is not clear what this implies, we
emphasize that the editorial position of a newspaper
cannot be dictated by the majority vote of a
community. We ask that the distinguished professors
who signed the ad ask themselves what consequences
the implications of their position would have on the
policies of the New York Times and the Washington
Post.
Our most vehement objection, however, is to the
last line of the ad where it reads that "the urging of
violence against anyone, named or un named is
intolerable in the Stanford Community." We fear that

this position would not allow us to continue to print
tracts advocating the idea of violent revolution—and
we feel such a restriction would be a dangerous blow
to free speech.
It is important that D. McGuire and the other
revolutionaries be allowed to express their opinions as
long as those opinions do not endanger another's life.
We re-emphasize that it is important to permit the
advocacy of the idea of violent revolution, but that
incitement to a specific criminal act must be censored.
We find it strange that professors within a
University that purports to be a center of free
expression advocate stricter rules governing
expression than does the U.S. Supreme Court.
Our final objection is to the tone of the entire
advertisement. The Daily is viewed as a monolithic
creature. We think that the diversity of opinion
expressed in the past and on this page should
demonstrate the injustice of that view. We are an
open paper. Anyone can work for us, and we urge
them to. Our opinion pages are open to the
commentaries of all members of the community.
And we urge all members of the community to take
advantage of this forum.
We on the Daily are not violent revolutionaries.
We think that violence is proving counterproductive
in the U.S. today, and we especially abhor it for that
reason. Still, we know a growing number of students
and Americans have taken to the path of the violent
revolutionary as D. McGuire has. We want to know
what he thinks, and we hope you do too. How can
we oppose him if we do not know what he thinks?
The majority of the Daily staff has decided
that it was wrong to print D. McGuire's column as it
ran in last Friday's paper. The article contained
passages that could be construed as threatening the
lives of two named individuals—and for that reason
we think it falls outside the broad boundaries of
what can justly be expressed.
We believe an individual has a right to advocate
the idea of violence and revolution. There will
continue to be a place for such expression in the
Daily's opinion pages.
We do not believe, however, that he has the
right to incite individuals to a specific criminal act.
For this reason we are declaring today a Daily
policy that letters or columns containing such
incitements will not be printed. Any such references
must be removed by the author before we will allow
the rest of the column to be published.
We wish to emphasize, however that our
decision on this matter did not come easily. The
issues involved cannot be drawn as simply as
