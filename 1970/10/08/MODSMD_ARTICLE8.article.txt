# A 						Dissenting View
## 
### 
The response to the McGuire column has taught us a lot. Most
people, it seems, become outraged only when they themselves begin
to feel uncomfortable. These people on the opposite page will smile
benignly at most protest, yet when the war comes home, when
trouble looms closer, they quickly draw the line and demand
obedience.
They tolerate dissent well enough, but please, they ask, don't
shame your cause with blunt thoughts or flashes of passion. Their
anger is at a refusal to be polite, a refusa' to argue on their level, and
above all a refusal to "understand" on their terms. To them McGuire
has lost his patience and behaved inexcusably. Pointing out names
shatters the calm rationality and the rarefied atmosphere of their
debates.
A newspaper must be on its guard and reject this pose of
neutrality. The Daily cannot remain free if it accepts the University's
guidelines. To be alive and effective, we must avoid the decorum that
these people insist on.
Our critics demand responsibility, but what does it mean? Do they
feel this paper should never print any writings if it appears the author
is teetering on the edge of advocating violence? Must we content
ourselves with publishing bland, hazy polemics with never any specific
names or incidents? To mutter emptily about injustices and never
voice any firm position, however unpopular, is a much greater
irresponsibility than the one our opponents cite.
From another viewpoint their criticism sounds naive. Do they
seriously hold the Daily accountable for the national climate of
violence in the face of our government's world-wide military
operations and the contributions of some of this university's
departments? To condemn the Daily is to hit just the tip of the
iceberg. The problem of over-publicized violence lies not with our

staff, but with the vast, news-hungry media that slips in Vietnam
firefights between commercials. The Daily is interested in exposing its
readers to stimulating thought, some of it conservative and some
revolutionary. We must have the freedom to continue doing this.
The inclusion of the names troubles us, for it is difficult to accept
the summary justice that McGuire calls for. To cut the names, though,
would weaken the column's message and leave it groundless and
dulled. In our opinion McGuire wrote his column precisely to point
out that his complaints about snitches were well-founded and to
demonstrate clearly his emotions on the subject.
The Daily cannot and should not foist its own editorial tastes on its
columnists. To claim that we support McGuire's method of "dealing
with snitches" simply because we printed the column is as ridiculous
as claiming, for example, that we side with Young Republican Don
Ayer's published columns.
The staff makes an earnest effort to balance its columnists, and we
must continue to do so. It's regrettable that because of the
administration's implied threats and a possible law suit, the staff must
consult with legal counsel at the first sign of trouble. The Daily's
editorial staff should not be governed by legal wizards but rather it
should follow a commitment to print as many columns as it can from
a wide range of viewpoints.
There is a point of information that we would like to share with
our critics who suggest the Daily should become independent to
insure its responsibility. Those who argue that the Daily should style
itself after the Harvard Crimson or the Yale Daily News, both of which
are independent, should remember that last year the Crimson
demanded editorially that the United States surrender unconditionally
to the Viet Cong.

Ayer's published columns.
The staff makes an earnest effort to balance its columnists, and we
must continue to do so. It's regrettable that because of the
administration's implied threats and a possible law suit, the staff must
consult with legal counsel at the first sign of trouble. The Daily's
editorial staff should not be governed by legal wizards but rather it
should follow a commitment to print as many columns as it can from
a wide range of viewpoints.
There is a point of information that we would like to share with
our critics who suggest the Daily should become independent to
insure its responsibility. Those who argue that the Daily should style
itself after the Harvard Crimson or the Yale Daily News, both of which
are independent, should remember that last year the Crimson
demanded editorially that the United States surrender unconditionally
to the Viet Cong.
P.S.R.
The response to the McGuire column has taught us a lot. Most
people, it seems, become outraged only when they themselves begin
to feel uncomfortable. These people on the opposite page will smile
benignly at most protest, yet when the war comes home, when
trouble looms closer, they quickly draw the line and demand
obedience.
They tolerate dissent well enough, but please, they ask, don't
shame your cause with blunt thoughts or flashes of passion. Their
anger is at a refusal to be polite, a refusa' to argue on their level, and
above all a refusal to "understand" on their terms. To them McGuire
has lost his patience and behaved inexcusably. Pointing out names
shatters the calm rationality and the rarefied atmosphere of their
debates.
A newspaper must be on its guard and reject this pose of
neutrality. The Daily cannot remain free if it accepts the University's
guidelines. To be alive and effective, we must avoid the decorum that
these people insist on.
Our critics demand responsibility, but what does it mean? Do they
feel this paper should never print any writings if it appears the author
is teetering on the edge of advocating violence? Must we content
ourselves with publishing bland, hazy polemics with never any specific
names or incidents? To mutter emptily about injustices and never
voice any firm position, however unpopular, is a much greater
irresponsibility than the one our opponents cite.
From another viewpoint their criticism sounds naive. Do they
seriously hold the Daily accountable for the national climate of
violence in the face of our government's world-wide military
operations and the contributions of some of this university's
departments? To condemn the Daily is to hit just the tip of the
iceberg. The problem of over-publicized violence lies not with our

staff, but with the vast, news-hungry media that slips in Vietnam
firefights between commercials. The Daily is interested in exposing its
readers to stimulating thought, some of it conservative and some
revolutionary. We must have the freedom to continue doing this.
The inclusion of the names troubles us, for it is difficult to accept
the summary justice that McGuire calls for. To cut the names, though,
would weaken the column's message and leave it groundless and
dulled. In our opinion McGuire wrote his column precisely to point
out that his complaints about snitches were well-founded and to
demonstrate clearly his emotions on the subject.
The Daily cannot and should not foist its own editorial tastes on its
columnists. To claim that we support McGuire's method of "dealing
with snitches" simply because we printed the column is as ridiculous
as claiming, for example, that we side with Young Republican Don
Ayer's published columns.
