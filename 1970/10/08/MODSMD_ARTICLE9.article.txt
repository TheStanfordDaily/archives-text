# Commitment To Action by bob grant
## 
### 
Last spring when the Stanford delegation flew
to Washington in response to the Cambodian
invasion, Henry Kissinger dismissed the
importance of the emotional response of students
and faculty as a fleeting phenomenon which would
pass within six weeks and have no lasting impact,
except perhaps as a memory of an early summer
vacation. Henry could very well be proved right by
the students themselves if we refuse to make of
our commitment more than a fleeting thing.
We really have three choices. The first and
easiest is to quit. This is what most people do;
they simply give up with rationalizations of
"politics is dirty," or "the only way to get real
change is to wait for the revolution," or "I've got
too many other things to do; I don't have the
time." Facile excuses like these are possible only if
the speaker does not have to pay the price of
quitting. The minorities, the draftees, the
unemployed, the ill housed, the un-fed and
mis-educated are the ones who pay for your
indifference.
If you have a humane concern for these people,
and I believe most people on this campus do, then
you simply cannot quit. As Allard Lowenstein so
well said:
"When they quit, what happens is that the
silence out of that whole group of people that
quit is filled right away by people who have
convinced themselves that they have the
answers. If you look at the people who then fill
the stage, the center stage of this country, it's
not very difficult to see what happens, it
becomes then a contest between people who in
fact see the only solution as polarizing the
country."
There is a second choice that a few are taking
and that is to become the violent revolutionary,
the advocate of bombing and trashing as the
only means to change the system. To me these
people are heading for a dead end of despair and
self destruction. Far from creating a climate ripe
for a revolution of the left, they are more likely to
generate a reaction to the right. Margaret Chase

Smith correctly described our country as one
which when given a choice between anarchy and
repression, will choose repression every time. And
once again, it will not be the revolutionaries who
will pay the costs for their actions; they'll be able
to return to their tenured faculty positions, their
Sting-Rays and Porches, and their wealthy family
wombs. The ones who will pay are the poor, the
unemployed, the unprotected.
The final choice we have is to become
politically involved, to actively work for specific
remedies of our ills. And there are a couple of
ways of doing this. We can continue to protest,
organize rallies, march to Washington or hold mass
meetings. I happen to think that mass
demonstrations are becoming marginally effective
if not actually counter-productive. More attention
was paid last year to Ralph Yarborough's defeat in
Texas than to the 100,000 people in Washington.
There seems to be only one sensible direction to
go, and that is to commit yourself to the
unpublicized, grass roots organizing that can be
such an effective influence on the political process.
It takes time and work and energy and serious
committment to the changes you want, but it is
the means by which reform can be effected. You
can make a contribution if you work, if you go
door to door to door. As, once again, Allard
Lowenstein said, "The stakes are so great, that it's
not an imposition; that you owe it to yourselves
and the country to do it." And it does not matter
at what level you begin—campus wide, local, state,
or national, just begin.
If you want to prove Henry Kissinger correct,
stay in the dorms this fall and forget about the
problems that do not affect you. But if you care
what happens to other people, then go out and get
involved. There are many ways you can do it: 1 )
Join a campaign and help elect a candidate. The
names and telephone numbers of campaign
managers are available through SCIP, the ASSU,
the League of Women Voters, and many other
organizations. 2) Run for office yourself. City
Council, Board of Education, even the ASSU
Senate seats can be taken with moderate amounts
of work. 3) Apply for a university committee.
Find out what land development and housing
problems are and try to come up with a solution.
Whatever you choose, be prepared for hard
work and little glamour. It is an unfortunate
characteristic of real world probh-ms that they are
not amenable to simplistic solutions or
unambiguous choices.
But the only way reform and change is going to
occur is if you choose to get involved. You get the
kind of world you work for. It's up to you.

characteristic of real world probh-ms that they are
not amenable to simplistic solutions or
unambiguous choices.
But the only way reform and change is going to
occur is if you choose to get involved. You get the
kind of world you work for. It's up to you.

Last spring when the Stanford delegation flew
to Washington in response to the Cambodian
invasion, Henry Kissinger dismissed the
importance of the emotional response of students
and faculty as a fleeting phenomenon which would
pass within six weeks and have no lasting impact,
except perhaps as a memory of an early summer
vacation. Henry could very well be proved right by
the students themselves if we refuse to make of
our commitment more than a fleeting thing.
We really have three choices. The first and
easiest is to quit. This is what most people do;
they simply give up with rationalizations of
"politics is dirty," or "the only way to get real
change is to wait for the revolution," or "I've got
too many other things to do; I don't have the
time." Facile excuses like these are possible only if
the speaker does not have to pay the price of
quitting. The minorities, the draftees, the
unemployed, the ill housed, the un-fed and
mis-educated are the ones who pay for your
indifference.
If you have a humane concern for these people,
and I believe most people on this campus do, then
you simply cannot quit. As Allard Lowenstein so
well said:
"When they quit, what happens is that the
silence out of that whole group of people that
quit is filled right away by people who have
convinced themselves that they have the
answers. If you look at the people who then fill
the stage, the center stage of this country, it's
not very difficult to see what happens, it
becomes then a contest between people who in
fact see the only solution as polarizing the
country."
There is a second choice that a few are taking
and that is to become the violent revolutionary,
the advocate of bombing and trashing as the
only means to change the system. To me these
people are heading for a dead end of despair and
self destruction. Far from creating a climate ripe
for a revolution of the left, they are more likely to
generate a reaction to the right. Margaret Chase

Smith correctly described our country as one
which when given a choice between anarchy and
repression, will choose repression every time. And
once again, it will not be the revolutionaries who
will pay the costs for their actions; they'll be able
to return to their tenured faculty positions, their
Sting-Rays and Porches, and their wealthy family
wombs. The ones who will pay are the poor, the
unemployed, the unprotected.
The final choice we have is to become
politically involved, to actively work for specific
remedies of our ills. And there are a couple of
ways of doing this. We can continue to protest,
organize rallies, march to Washington or hold mass
meetings. I happen to think that mass
demonstrations are becoming marginally effective
if not actually counter-productive. More attention
was paid last year to Ralph Yarborough's defeat in
Texas than to the 100,000 people in Washington.
There seems to be only one sensible direction to
go, and that is to commit yourself to the
unpublicized, grass roots organizing that can be
such an effective influence on the political process.
It takes time and work and energy and serious
committment to the changes you want, but it is
the means by which reform can be effected. You
can make a contribution if you work, if you go
door to door to door. As, once again, Allard
Lowenstein said, "The stakes are so great, that it's
not an imposition; that you owe it to yourselves
and the country to do it." And it does not matter
at what level you begin—campus wide, local, state,
or national, just begin.
If you want to prove Henry Kissinger correct,
stay in the dorms this fall and forget about the
problems that do not affect you. But if you care
what happens to other people, then go out and get
involved. There are many ways you can do it: 1 )
Join a campaign and help elect a candidate. The
names and telephone numbers of campaign
managers are available through SCIP, the ASSU,
the League of Women Voters, and many other
organizations. 2) Run for office yourself. City
Council, Board of Education, even the ASSU
Senate seats can be taken with moderate amounts
of work. 3) Apply for a university committee.
Find out what land development and housing
problems are and try to come up with a solution.
Whatever you choose, be prepared for hard
work and little glamour. It is an unfortunate
characteristic of real world probh-ms that they are
not amenable to simplistic solutions or
unambiguous choices.

Last spring when the Stanford delegation flew
to Washington in response to the Cambodian
invasion, Henry Kissinger dismissed the
importance of the emotional response of students
and faculty as a fleeting phenomenon which would
pass within six weeks and have no lasting impact,
except perhaps as a memory of an early summer
vacation. Henry could very well be proved right by
the students themselves if we refuse to make of
our commitment more than a fleeting thing.
We really have three choices. The first and
easiest is to quit. This is what most people do;
they simply give up with rationalizations of
"politics is dirty," or "the only way to get real
change is to wait for the revolution," or "I've got
too many other things to do; I don't have the
time." Facile excuses like these are possible only if
the speaker does not have to pay the price of
quitting. The minorities, the draftees, the
unemployed, the ill housed, the un-fed and
mis-educated are the ones who pay for your
indifference.
If you have a humane concern for these people,
and I believe most people on this campus do, then
you simply cannot quit. As Allard Lowenstein so
well said:
"When they quit, what happens is that the
silence out of that whole group of people that
quit is filled right away by people who have
convinced themselves that they have the
answers. If you look at the people who then fill
the stage, the center stage of this country, it's
not very difficult to see what happens, it
becomes then a contest between people who in
fact see the only solution as polarizing the
country."
There is a second choice that a few are taking
and that is to become the violent revolutionary,
the advocate of bombing and trashing as the
only means to change the system. To me these
people are heading for a dead end of despair and
self destruction. Far from creating a climate ripe
for a revolution of the left, they are more likely to
generate a reaction to the right. Margaret Chase

Smith correctly described our country as one
which when given a choice between anarchy and
repression, will choose repression every time. And
once again, it will not be the revolutionaries who
will pay the costs for their actions; they'll be able
to return to their tenured faculty positions, their
Sting-Rays and Porches, and their wealthy family
wombs. The ones who will pay are the poor, the
unemployed, the unprotected.
The final choice we have is to become
politically involved, to actively work for specific
remedies of our ills. And there are a couple of
ways of doing this. We can continue to protest,
organize rallies, march to Washington or hold mass
meetings. I happen to think that mass
demonstrations are becoming marginally effective
if not actually counter-productive. More attention
was paid last year to Ralph Yarborough's defeat in
Texas than to the 100,000 people in Washington.
There seems to be only one sensible direction to
go, and that is to commit yourself to the
unpublicized, grass roots organizing that can be
such an effective influence on the political process.
It takes time and work and energy and serious
committment to the changes you want, but it is
the means by which reform can be effected. You
can make a contribution if you work, if you go
door to door to door. As, once again, Allard
Lowenstein said, "The stakes are so great, that it's
not an imposition; that you owe it to yourselves
and the country to do it." And it does not matter
at what level you begin—campus wide, local, state,
or national, just begin.
If you want to prove Henry Kissinger correct,
stay in the dorms this fall and forget about the
problems that do not affect you. But if you care
what happens to other people, then go out and get
involved. There are many ways you can do it: 1 )
Join a campaign and help elect a candidate. The
names and telephone numbers of campaign
managers are available through SCIP, the ASSU,
the League of Women Voters, and many other
organizations. 2) Run for office yourself. City
Council, Board of Education, even the ASSU
Senate seats can be taken with moderate amounts
of work. 3) Apply for a university committee.
Find out what land development and housing
