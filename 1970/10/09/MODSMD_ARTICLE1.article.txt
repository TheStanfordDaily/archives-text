# Franklin Outspoken
## Universities Misuse Power 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Though academicians may differ
about political matters, almost all
would agree that a university should be
a de-politicized place for the free
interchange of pure ideas. H. Bruce
Franklin doesn't.
"Universities are essential sources of
power within our society, and thus
throughout the world," the associate
professor of English says."The
universities are not even independent
entities, for they need huge and
growing amounts of capital, and both
their tools and their products are highly
socialized and inter*
dependent." Franklin holds the view
that contradictions determine history.
He believes that the prime
contradiction in the world is between
the "oppressed people and the
oppressors." Universities, according to
Franklin, are now primarily tools of the
oppressors, and function to produce
people useful to the oppressors.
Franklin believes that Marxist
theory is "Correct, but must
continually be developed to fit specific
situations, as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao
have done."
Radical Activities
The 36 year-old professor has been
prominent in campus radical activities,
and has aided off campus groups such
as Venceremos College and the striking
Pittsburgh Des-Moines steel workers
last fall. He is a member of the

Revolutionary Union, a
Marxist-oriented group.
Hib classes, "Melville and Marx" this
quarter, for example, often become
question and answer sessions on
Marxist theory, and free-wheeling
discussions of radical ideas. Franklin
fields all questions, often straying far
from the original plan of the class. "I
get worried about going so far afield,
but I am more worried about not
answering questions. I might be accused
of avoiding ticklish questions if I didn't
answer them all."
Franklin moves around the
classroom as he lectures, gesticulates to
bring home a point, then stops to
concentrate on a question, then
resumes his movement.
Worked For SAC
Franklin graduated in English from
Amherst College in 1955, and went to
work as a tugboat mate in New York
Harbor. He served as a navigator and
intelligence officer in the Strategic Air
Command for three years where he
"began to get the first political ideas
that seen, d radical. "Part of our job,"
he says "was to convince the American
people that we were under imminent
threat of a soviet nuclear attack while
we knew that the Soviets didn't really
have the means to deliver nuclear
weapons on the United States. I began
to wonder what wrs going on."
He returned to school, this time to
Stanford, to begin work toward his

Ph.D. in English and American
Literature which he received in 1961.
He joined the faculty as an Assistant
professor in 1961, went to Johns
Hopkins University as a professor
1964 -1965, and returned to Stanford as
an associate professor in 1965 .
Franklin sees black and brown
people as the vanguard of present day
revolutionary thought. "In a
revolutionary struggle, societal roles are
upside-down. The most oppressed take
on the roles of leadership," he says.
Change In Universities
He sees a change in the makeup of
universities in present day society.
"Where formerly university students
were chosen elite, the sons of the ruling
class plus the most able sons of the
professional and middle classes, now
university students are the sons and
daughters of all the classes except the
lowest, which in the United States
means racial minorities. The most
significant development among the
student Left is the rapid rise of a
working-class orientation," he says.
Franklin was a faculty member of
the Stanford-in-France group in
1966-1967, and became acquainted
with several Vietnamese people living in
Paris. "This experience changed my
life," he says."The Vietnamese were so
full of love for us, for each other, and
for their people. It is difficult to


"... universities are important battlegrounds. It's not incon
ceivable that sons and daughters of the elite can attain rad
ical positions."
conceive of such people without
actually meeting them."
"The thing that really struck me was
that these people extended their love to
myself and my wife, two Americans
whom they had never met before "
He did not submit names for
consideration to the Presidential search
committee which selected Richard
Lyman. He did not nominate anyone
because he "wouldn't want to- see a
nice guy in that position. He'd get torn
to pieces. A college president is part of
a dinosaur, extinct, even though still
dangerous."
Franklin is also interested ui the
current attempts at labor organict.ig on
the campus. He sees the "university
preventing workers from organizing and
from knowing what's going on. The
National Labor Relations Board is
trying to take jurisdiction to prevent
organizing," he added. One of the
NLRB's methods, he explains, is to
force workers to bargain as one group.
"A lot of white collar workers at
Stanford, who would be in the large
group, don't even think of themselves
as workers. How can these diverse
groups ever be expected to decide on
one union?"
The former construction work* r.
factory worker and fishing boat crew
member teaches at one of the "centers
of elitist thought" because the
"universities are important
battlegrounds. It is not inconceivable
that sons and daughters of the elite can
attain radical positions."
Franklin has taught Marxist political
theory to workers, who, he finds are
"extremely responsive, and are
concerned with insuring the efficiency
of any movement they are involved
with. They want no amaturish
methods."
Franklin wrote his Ph.d dissertation
on Herman Melville, and has published
extensively on Melville. He is the editor
of several Melville novels, and a
collection of science fiction stories
entitled "Future Perfect."

1964 -1965, and returned to Stanford as

Franklin sees black and brown
people as the vanguard of present day
revolutionary thought. "In a
revolutionary struggle, societal roles are
upside-down. The most oppressed take
on the roles of leadership," he says.
Change In Universities
He sees a change in the makeup of
universities in present day society.
"Where formerly university students
were chosen elite, the sons of the ruling
class plus the most able sons of the
professional and middle classes, now
university students are the sons and
daughters of all the classes except the
lowest, which in the United States
means racial minorities. The most
significant development among the
student Left is the rapid rise of a
working-class orientation," he says.
Franklin was a faculty member of
the Stanford-in-France group in
1966-1967, and became acquainted
with several Vietnamese people living in
Paris. "This experience changed my
life," he says."The Vietnamese were so
full of love for us, for each other, and
for their people. It is difficult to


"... universities are important battlegrounds. It's not incon
ceivable that sons and daughters of the elite can attain rad
ical positions."
conceive of such people without
actually meeting them."
"The thing that really struck me was
that these people extended their love to
myself and my wife, two Americans
whom they had never met before "
He did not submit names for
consideration to the Presidential search
committee which selected Richard
Lyman. He did not nominate anyone
because he "wouldn't want to- see a
nice guy in that position. He'd get torn
to pieces. A college president is part of
a dinosaur, extinct, even though still
dangerous."
Franklin is also interested ui the
current attempts at labor organict.ig on
the campus. He sees the "university
preventing workers from organizing and
from knowing what's going on. The
National Labor Relations Board is
trying to take jurisdiction to prevent
organizing," he added. One of the
NLRB's methods, he explains, is to
force workers to bargain as one group.
"A lot of white collar workers at
Stanford, who would be in the large
group, don't even think of themselves
as workers. How can these diverse
groups ever be expected to decide on
one union?"
The former construction work* r.
factory worker and fishing boat crew
member teaches at one of the "centers
of elitist thought" because the
"universities are important
battlegrounds. It is not inconceivable
that sons and daughters of the elite can
attain radical positions."
Franklin has taught Marxist political
theory to workers, who, he finds are
"extremely responsive, and are
concerned with insuring the efficiency
of any movement they are involved
with. They want no amaturish
methods."
Franklin wrote his Ph.d dissertation
on Herman Melville, and has published
extensively on Melville. He is the editor
of several Melville novels, and a
collection of science fiction stories
entitled "Future Perfect."

Though academicians may differ
about political matters, almost all
would agree that a university should be
a de-politicized place for the free
interchange of pure ideas. H. Bruce
Franklin doesn't.
"Universities are essential sources of
power within our society, and thus
throughout the world," the associate
professor of English says."The
universities are not even independent
entities, for they need huge and
growing amounts of capital, and both
their tools and their products are highly
socialized and inter*
dependent." Franklin holds the view
that contradictions determine history.
He believes that the prime
contradiction in the world is between
the "oppressed people and the
oppressors." Universities, according to
Franklin, are now primarily tools of the
oppressors, and function to produce
people useful to the oppressors.
Franklin believes that Marxist
theory is "Correct, but must
continually be developed to fit specific
situations, as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao
have done."
Radical Activities
The 36 year-old professor has been
prominent in campus radical activities,
and has aided off campus groups such
as Venceremos College and the striking
Pittsburgh Des-Moines steel workers
last fall. He is a member of the

Revolutionary Union, a
Marxist-oriented group.
Hib classes, "Melville and Marx" this
quarter, for example, often become
question and answer sessions on
Marxist theory, and free-wheeling
discussions of radical ideas. Franklin
fields all questions, often straying far
from the original plan of the class. "I
get worried about going so far afield,
but I am more worried about not
answering questions. I might be accused
of avoiding ticklish questions if I didn't
answer them all."
Franklin moves around the
classroom as he lectures, gesticulates to
bring home a point, then stops to
concentrate on a question, then
resumes his movement.
Worked For SAC
Franklin graduated in English from
Amherst College in 1955, and went to
work as a tugboat mate in New York
Harbor. He served as a navigator and
intelligence officer in the Strategic Air
Command for three years where he
"began to get the first political ideas
that seen, d radical. "Part of our job,"
he says "was to convince the American
people that we were under imminent
threat of a soviet nuclear attack while
we knew that the Soviets didn't really
have the means to deliver nuclear
weapons on the United States. I began
to wonder what wrs going on."
He returned to school, this time to
Stanford, to begin work toward his

Literature which he received in 1961.

of any movement they are involved

methods."
Franklin wrote his Ph.d dissertation
on Herman Melville, and has published
extensively on Melville. He is the editor
of several Melville novels, and a
collection of science fiction stories
entitled "Future Perfect."

Though academicians may differ
about political matters, almost all
would agree that a university should be
a de-politicized place for the free
interchange of pure ideas. H. Bruce
Franklin doesn't.
"Universities are essential sources of
power within our society, and thus
throughout the world," the associate
professor of English says."The
universities are not even independent
entities, for they need huge and
growing amounts of capital, and both
their tools and their products are highly
socialized and inter*
dependent." Franklin holds the view
that contradictions determine history.
He believes that the prime
contradiction in the world is between
the "oppressed people and the
oppressors." Universities, according to
Franklin, are now primarily tools of the
oppressors, and function to produce
people useful to the oppressors.
Franklin believes that Marxist
theory is "Correct, but must
continually be developed to fit specific
situations, as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao
have done."
Radical Activities
The 36 year-old professor has been
prominent in campus radical activities,
and has aided off campus groups such
as Venceremos College and the striking
Pittsburgh Des-Moines steel workers
last fall. He is a member of the

Revolutionary Union, a
Marxist-oriented group.
Hib classes, "Melville and Marx" this
quarter, for example, often become
question and answer sessions on
Marxist theory, and free-wheeling
discussions of radical ideas. Franklin
fields all questions, often straying far
from the original plan of the class. "I
get worried about going so far afield,
but I am more worried about not
answering questions. I might be accused
of avoiding ticklish questions if I didn't
answer them all."
Franklin moves around the
classroom as he lectures, gesticulates to
bring home a point, then stops to
concentrate on a question, then
resumes his movement.
Worked For SAC
Franklin graduated in English from
Amherst College in 1955, and went to
work as a tugboat mate in New York
Harbor. He served as a navigator and
intelligence officer in the Strategic Air
Command for three years where he
"began to get the first political ideas
that seen, d radical. "Part of our job,"
he says "was to convince the American
people that we were under imminent
threat of a soviet nuclear attack while
we knew that the Soviets didn't really
have the means to deliver nuclear
weapons on the United States. I began
to wonder what wrs going on."
He returned to school, this time to
Stanford, to begin work toward his

Ph.D. in English and American
Literature which he received in 1961.
He joined the faculty as an Assistant
professor in 1961, went to Johns
Hopkins University as a professor
1964 -1965, and returned to Stanford as
an associate professor in 1965 .
Franklin sees black and brown
people as the vanguard of present day
revolutionary thought. "In a
revolutionary struggle, societal roles are
upside-down. The most oppressed take
on the roles of leadership," he says.
Change In Universities
He sees a change in the makeup of
universities in present day society.
"Where formerly university students
were chosen elite, the sons of the ruling
class plus the most able sons of the
professional and middle classes, now
university students are the sons and
daughters of all the classes except the
lowest, which in the United States
means racial minorities. The most
significant development among the
student Left is the rapid rise of a
working-class orientation," he says.
Franklin was a faculty member of
the Stanford-in-France group in
1966-1967, and became acquainted
with several Vietnamese people living in
Paris. "This experience changed my
life," he says."The Vietnamese were so
full of love for us, for each other, and
for their people. It is difficult to


"... universities are important battlegrounds. It's not incon
ceivable that sons and daughters of the elite can attain rad
ical positions."
conceive of such people without
actually meeting them."
"The thing that really struck me was
that these people extended their love to
myself and my wife, two Americans
whom they had never met before "
He did not submit names for
consideration to the Presidential search
committee which selected Richard
Lyman. He did not nominate anyone
because he "wouldn't want to- see a
nice guy in that position. He'd get torn
to pieces. A college president is part of
a dinosaur, extinct, even though still
dangerous."
Franklin is also interested ui the
current attempts at labor organict.ig on
the campus. He sees the "university
preventing workers from organizing and
from knowing what's going on. The
National Labor Relations Board is
trying to take jurisdiction to prevent
organizing," he added. One of the
NLRB's methods, he explains, is to
force workers to bargain as one group.
"A lot of white collar workers at
Stanford, who would be in the large
group, don't even think of themselves
as workers. How can these diverse
groups ever be expected to decide on
one union?"
The former construction work* r.
factory worker and fishing boat crew
member teaches at one of the "centers
of elitist thought" because the
"universities are important
battlegrounds. It is not inconceivable
that sons and daughters of the elite can
attain radical positions."
Franklin has taught Marxist political
theory to workers, who, he finds are
"extremely responsive, and are
concerned with insuring the efficiency
of any movement they are involved
with. They want no amaturish
methods."
