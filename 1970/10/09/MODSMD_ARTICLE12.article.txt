# Paris Close to Stanford-in-Tours

### LARRY LIEBERT 
Facilities at Stanford-in-France
are definitely more Wilbur than
Waldorf. Stanford students
seeking luxurious European living
would do better to pick the big
castle in England.
But those who do not mind a
European home as "institutional"
as Stanford dorms may find
reasons to pick the Tours campus.
Nearness to Paris is one of the
best.
It's only two hours by train or
a half-day's easy hitching to
Europe's capital. Paris is "worth"
as much time as can be spared for
it (as if a town's worth is
measured by tourist attractions).
Museums, monuments, concerts,
shops, and just walking orf the
Lefi Bank all make most students
in Tours wish they could spend
more time in the great city.
Paris's great drawback is the
difficulty in getting to know
anyone in such a huge city. One
can at least do a little better in
Tours. There are thousands of
French university students in
town. A handful of the students
regularly visit Stanford's campus,
offering instant contacts with the
French. But most of the college

students show as much apathy
toward meeting their American
counterparts as Stanford students
show toward going out to find the
French.
The campus also has a list of
local families who invite Stanford
students to elaborate home
dinners and chances for French
communication.
Some doubt exists that Tours
is any kind of "typical" French
town. People in other parts of
France often describe it as a kind
of French Palo Alto, a totally
bourgeois city. The street next to
campus looks like a University
Avenue of pastry shops, banks,
and Monoprix—the bastard
offspring of Woolworth's and
Macy's.
But Tours also has winding
streets of ancient neighborhoods,
friendly people in little shops, and
an old cathedral.
While the rear of
Stanford-in-France overlooks a
parking lot and neon signs, the
front looks out on heavy, aging
bridges crossing the Loire River.
And although students

constantly take off for Paris and
the north and south of France,
many also find unexcelled
chateaux to tour within biking
distance of the campus.
Free hours in Tours can be
spent on aimless walks, sitting in
cafes, or eating crepes.
Stanford-in-France has no
grounds to spread out on, which
makes for pretty close living in
the one big dorm building. Such
cramped quarters can create
misery for those irritated by
groupiness, or can give rise to
great friendships.
Meals at the campus are not
lessons for would-be gourmets. As
of last year, Stanford's contracts
with the Paris bureaucracy
required Stanford to serve the
same mediocre food served in
French dormitories. At least it's a
realistic experience in what
students are fed.
The campus's French staff is
personable and understanding,
although they are still a little

mystified by Stanford students'
general change from beer busts to
freak iness.
There are some outstanding
teachers on the French staff,
offering good courses in such
areas as French drama, literature,
and politics. The only failures in
the past have been in boring and
backward approaches to more
basic French courses, including
grammar, comprehension, and
translation.
But none of that is too
important since the few days of
courses in a week just fill in
between three- to four-day
weekends of travel.
Perhaps the lessened student
enthusiasm recently for
Stanford-in-France and other
overseas campuses comes from the
inevitable urge to make those
weekends seven days long. Once
one discovers how easy it is to
travel in Europe and how much
there is to do, it's hard to come
back for any school days at all.

TOURS—The city, while not the thriving metropolis of Paris, does offer to Stanford-in-France students a chance to meet and converse with
the French people.
