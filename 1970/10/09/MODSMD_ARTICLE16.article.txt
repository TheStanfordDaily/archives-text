# In The Heart of Vienna
## Culture Surrounds Austria Campus 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Stanford's Austrian campus, located quite literally in the heart of
Vienna, offers its students all the cultural advantages of the
Hapsburg Empire's capital city, easy access to Eastern European
countries—and, for those unused to it, the disadvantages of city
living.
Three floors of one building house the campus, which rents its
space from the Austrian Catholic organization Caritas. The building
is three blocks from the State Opera, three blocks from the Concert
House, and borders on Vienna's only red light district. The campus
moved to this location from the more isolated Semmering nearly
three years ago.
In addition to its normal academic program, the campus also
offers a required field trip each quarter.
Students returning from Vienna seem, in general, satisfied, if not
very happy with their experience overseas. The general feeling
towards the group experience varies considerably from group to
group.
While some students feel strongly about the "confinement" of
living in a city with no immediate access to lawns or playing fields,
most praise the cultural opportunities offered in Vienna.
Criticism
Certain aspects of the program have, however, come under sharp
criticism recently. Greg Phillips, a student just returned from
Austria, called the local courses "a waste of time." Phillips criticized

the German program as being "too limited," and with one exception
"not of a high standard."
One student, recently returned, stated, "It's absolutely amazing
that, except for the Viennese students on the fourth floor, we lived
in almost complete isolation from the University of Vienna, a
half-mile away. And the family program was almost non-existent."
The group just returned, Austria X, were told that the number of
families willing to invite Stanford students to dinners and outings
had diminished siu<\ previous students had often reneged after
accepting invitations.
Phillips commented that "the campus is excellent for anyone
interested in music," but added that he was somewhat put off b;
the austerity and coolness of the Viennese.
Life-Style Conflict
A partial reason for this coolness may stem from the sharp
contrast between the free-wheeling style of most Stanford students,
and the more traditionalist attitudes of many Viennese.
Minor criticisms have stressed the drab physical appearance of the
campus, particularly the students' rooms.
Most students return well satisfied with their experience at the
Austrian campus, as a wide range of comments indicates. There is a
recognition of the deficiencies of the program, and a few students
return fired up with a desire "to make a good program better,"
according to one student.

Life-Style Conflict
A partial reason for this coolness may stem from the sharp
contrast between the free-wheeling style of most Stanford students,
and the more traditionalist attitudes of many Viennese.
Minor criticisms have stressed the drab physical appearance of the

Most students return well satisfied with their experience at the
Austrian campus, as a wide range of comments indicates. There is a
recognition of the deficiencies of the program, and a few students

according to one student.

Stanford's Austrian campus, located quite literally in the heart of
Vienna, offers its students all the cultural advantages of the
Hapsburg Empire's capital city, easy access to Eastern European
countries—and, for those unused to it, the disadvantages of city
living.
Three floors of one building house the campus, which rents its
space from the Austrian Catholic organization Caritas. The building
is three blocks from the State Opera, three blocks from the Concert
House, and borders on Vienna's only red light district. The campus
moved to this location from the more isolated Semmering nearly
three years ago.
In addition to its normal academic program, the campus also
offers a required field trip each quarter.
Students returning from Vienna seem, in general, satisfied, if not
very happy with their experience overseas. The general feeling
towards the group experience varies considerably from group to
group.
While some students feel strongly about the "confinement" of
living in a city with no immediate access to lawns or playing fields,
most praise the cultural opportunities offered in Vienna.
Criticism
Certain aspects of the program have, however, come under sharp
criticism recently. Greg Phillips, a student just returned from
Austria, called the local courses "a waste of time." Phillips criticized

the German program as being "too limited," and with one exception
"not of a high standard."
One student, recently returned, stated, "It's absolutely amazing
that, except for the Viennese students on the fourth floor, we lived
in almost complete isolation from the University of Vienna, a
half-mile away. And the family program was almost non-existent."
