# Janis Joplin – A Personal Memory
## 
### SCOOPS CENAE 
Nobody's is a small Village bar
that lies, miraculously hidden (as
all hip New York bars are,
nowadays) in the Bleeker Street
jungle of far-out fashion stores
and gawking tourists. It's a
popular hangout for the
dropped-out set, and on most
summer nights, one can usually
find at least one rock superstar,
downing his troubles.
I remember that first night, the
first time I saw Janis. It was
summertime. The air was smoky,
the chatter gay, and booze was
flowing like mad. It must've been
past eleven- Nobody's never gets
crowded before eleven, and the
place was crowded that evening.
Suddenly, we heard
commotion from the front door,
and then the sould of hoarse
laughter. There was no mistaking
that sound. It was Janis. She was
dressed in purple and long, white
fur, with feathers in her hair and
shaded glasses.
The performer barrelled
through the door and towards the
bar like the entrance should've
had swinging doors and cowboys
side. She sauntered through a
gathering crowd of admirers,
smiling, stopping occasionally to
joke or give a hearty slap on the

back. She was laughing hoarsely as
she reached the bar.
"How ya doin' Jimmy?" she
shouted.
Jimmy, a tall Oriental who was
bartending, flashed a smile and
reached for a bottle.
I sat across the room, sipping
my beer quietly, watching. Had
read about this fur covered bundle
of feathers before, this "Port
Arthur wonder" about which the
rock world raved. I had watched
young girls almost faint with
exhaustion from overzealous
efforts to see her in concert.
Had seen their rooms, some of
which were completely
wallpapered with magazine and
newspaper prints bearing her
image. And had seen those ladies
turn from adolescent innocence to
hollow-eyed and cynical
limitations of the Janis they
believed existed. She was their
queen and understandably so.
In the past two years, she had
sold seven million dollars' worth
of records, broken up more rock
festivals than any singer in blues
history, and had recently been
crowned by the media, as queen
of white blues (whatever that
was.)
Standing there, laughing and
guzzling bourbon, Janis looked

little like a queen, and more like a
rough, old woman of the streets,
having a drink with her boys.
Everything about her seemed
unusually old, from the lines in
her forehead to the backslapping
and surprisingly rough horse-play
of which she seemed so fond. She
was also tender. At least four
times that evening, I saw her arms
around someone and each time
she released the person Janis burst
out giggling and bellowed hoarsely
for more booze.
Finally, after much chatter and
more drinks, she looked around
and slyly fastened her gaze on a
skinny, sullen faced adolescent,
who was drinking alone.
Stumbling from her stool, Janis
staggered to his table and pointed
a weaving finger in his direction.
"Come here, honey," she said.
He came. Once there, and
probably once again, after they
were in her apartment.

The most appropriate
testament to Janis Joplin I can
think of is that she was a
performer in the fullest sense.
Janis established her reputation
by being a performer and lived
solely, it seemed to perform.
Even in the early San Francisco
prediscovery days, when Janis
used to jam with then unknown
Jorma Kaukonen (now of the
Jefferson Airplane), she needed an
audience.
Jim McHenry, a former rock
entrepaneur and engineer
explained it to me once. "Back
then, it was like she was always
trying to prove something. I used
to tell her that she didn't have to
prove a thing but she laughed and
said I didn't know what I was
talking about . . . And when there
was somebody, just anybody in
the room, it was like magic.
Suddenly, her voice came alive."
It was no accident that
Columbia records after having
bought the Holding Company
from Mainstream records, chose
to make the group's next release a
live performance album.
John Simon (a Princeton grad
who produces such luminaries as
The Band) was agreed upon as a
album producer, and set about
coordinating the remote recording
of Big Brother and the Holding
company's performance.
Simon won't talk about it but
the resulting album, called "Cheap
Thrills" after some title hassles,
was a disaster. The groups' timing
was off, guitarist Sam Andrews
hadn't yet heard of taste and on
at least two songs on the album,
the band was simply out of tune.
All this was compounded by the
fact that remote rock recording
was a new thing in those days and
the elusive subtities that make the
difference between a good and
mediocre album had yet to be
mastered.
Simon, embarrassed, refused to
have his name put on the album
and with his grudging consent,
"Cheap Thrills" was released.
Janis saved the album. No one

bothered to talk about the terrible
backup band or poor recording
quality. The critics raved about
Janis the performer, remembered
Monterey and hailed the wild
eyed queen of the new blues who
had knocked them out at
Monterey and would do it again.
Three months and several
concerts later, the bastard album
was number one in the country.
By the summer of 1970, it had
sold over one million copies and
' was still selling.
Janis did a second album, a
studio thing with producer
Gabriel Mekler (Steppenwolf,
Three Dog Night) and a new band.
It sold an impressive half a million
copies but the critics were
un ex cited. Records somehow
never captured Janis. Her main
asset remained the stage and live
performance.

About the middle of the
summer, someone decided to have
a party for the performer, whose
performance had of late been
slipping. People just weren't
getting excited anymore, and
Janis's last few sets had been
uninspiring. Janis needed a good
party. She had just bombed on
the Dick Cavett show and was
preparing to go to L.A. and work
on a third Columbia album.
It was a typical party, with
several musician friends on hand,
some record company people and
the usual collection of onlookers
and groupies. Janis arrived at
about twelve, drunk, and shouting
that the new day would be in
honor of Tutti Frutti (her band).
Everyone, stoned and some,
slightly drunk, agreed and
someone broke out some cocaine
in honor of the occasion.
Some time after that, amid the
smoke and sound of Bessie Smith
album, Janis and I collided,
stared, squinting at each other for
some minutes.
I remember my surprise. She
looked old. Older than I'd
imagined. There was a smile on
her face, a tired smile, and I
remember wishing that I could've
seen her eyes, but they were
covered by the shades. A few
seconds passed.

"Hey, baby," she maoned
softly, "you know something?"
I was embarassed and high, and
still trying to recover from the age
on her face.
"No," I mumbled. "What?"
"You look like Teddy
Roosevelt."
I broke into a fit of giggling.
We slid to the floor and giggled
for a few minutes.
"Want to know something
else?" I asked, still giggling
hysterically, "y° u l°°k like Janis
Joplin."
She seemed to become
somewhat tense and looked
around the room. She got up and
staggered over to another duster
of bodies.
I left, thinking I had said
something terribly offensive.
Spoke briefly about it with John
Hill, (a Columbia producer who
does Pacific Gas and Electric and
Rav«.n) who nodded slowly and
said it was all understandable.
"There've been rumors floating
around about her voice," he said.
"I wouldn't be surprised if they
were true." His smile suddenly
flashed at that moment. "But no
matter what happens to that
voice, she's still great."
* * *
Five weeks later, having
about Janis' final silence, I still
can't agree with John about her
being great. My two brief
experiences with her leave me
thinking rather that she was
pathetic.
Anybody who says Janis was
happy was blind, and anyone who
believes him is both blind and
deaf. No one I've heard of who
knew Janis had ever seen her
happy. Perhaps that was why she
was so successful at singing the
blues. Her life was the blues.
I can't be any more than
instinctively sad that Janis is dead.
Because her life was so tortured
and because whe tried to
remember that she was from the
streets, I believe that Janis -Joplin
deserved all the peace in the
world, and perhaps more than
there is in our world.
I hope she has it now.
