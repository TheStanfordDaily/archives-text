# Mixed Bag Of Films
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
This weekend the usual variety
of films ranging from Chaplin's
"Modern Times" to a filmed rock
concert will be shown on campus.
Tonight the second film of the
Orson Welles Series (and the
second of Welles' career), "The
Magnificant Ambersons" will be
screened at 7, 8, and 9 in
Tresidder Union. Adapted by
Welles from Booth Tarkington's
novel, "The Magnificant
Amberson's" stars Joseph Cotton,
Agnes Moorehead, Anne Baxter
and Tim Holt. Despite brilliant
technical innovations and an
outstanding performance by
Agnes Moorehead, "The
Amberson's" failed to appeal to
the American public at the time it
was released in 1942 and was
written off as a failure.
Also this evening at 7:30 and
9:30 in Cubberley, the Volunteers
in Asia Film Series will feature
"All Quiet on the Western Front"
directed by Lewis Milestone ("Of
Mice and Men," "Les Miserables,"
Mutiny on the Bounty"). Adapted
from Remarque's novel? "All
Quiet on the Western Front" is
the story of a group of German
volunteers in World War I whose
romantic illusions of war were
shattered when the men realized
the senselessness of battle.)
Milestone's pacifist message justly
received Academy Awards in
1930 for Best Picture and Best
Director.
Cosmic Films is presenting a
program tonight and tomorrow

night at 8 and 10 in Memorial
Auditorium, "The T.A.M.I.
Show," billed as the "ultimate
rock film" (doubt). T.A.M.I. was
filmed on New Years Day in 1965
and features the Rolling Stones,
James Brown, Chuck Berry, "and
other greats."
Saturday, Tresidder Union will
show two excellent French films,
Jean Vigo's "L'Atalante" (1934),
and Jean Renoir's "A Day in the
Country" (1 938) at 7,8, and 9 in
Tresidder Union. Jean Vigo died
in 1934 at the age of 30 leaving
only a few films: "A propos de
Nice," "Zero de donduite," and
"L'Atalante," but those films
established him as one of the
foremost French directors.
Influenced by Rene Clair and the
French avant-garde, Vigo rebelled

against the established film form
and created truly unique films.
One of Chaplin's two greatest
nontalking comedies, "Modern
Times," (the other being "City
Lights") will be shown Saturday
evening at 8 and 10 in Cubberley.
His Marxist view of the
mechanized and modernized
society is a classic film that
shouldn't be missed.
The Sunday Flicks will present
its first film of the quarter this
Sunday evening in Memorial
Auditorium. "Boys in the Band"
is a rather decent screen
adaptation of a successful
Broadway production about a
homosexual's birthday party.
"Boys in the Band" or "Who's
Afraid of Lawrence Faggot?"
treats the subject of
homosexuality with a certain
amount of sensitivity and
honesty. The film has been
endorsed by the Gay Liberation.
* * *
Thirties and Forties film freaks
will bemoan the fact that Clive
Miller will not be performing
Tuesday evenings. He is by far the
most informed film connoisseur
this campus has ever seen and his
absence will leave a big hole in the
lives of those people who had
nothing better to do on Tuesday
evenings than relive the Golden
Days of Hollywood.

Milestone's pacifist message justly
received Academy Awards in
1930 for Best Picture and Best

Cosmic Films is presenting a
program tonight and tomorrow

night at 8 and 10 in Memorial
Auditorium, "The T.A.M.I.
Show," billed as the "ultimate
rock film" (doubt). T.A.M.I. was
filmed on New Years Day in 1965
and features the Rolling Stones,
James Brown, Chuck Berry, "and
other greats."
Saturday, Tresidder Union will
show two excellent French films,
Jean Vigo's "L'Atalante" (1934),
and Jean Renoir's "A Day in the
Country" (1 938) at 7,8, and 9 in
Tresidder Union. Jean Vigo died
in 1934 at the age of 30 leaving
only a few films: "A propos de
Nice," "Zero de donduite," and
"L'Atalante," but those films
established him as one of the
foremost French directors.
Influenced by Rene Clair and the
French avant-garde, Vigo rebelled

against the established film form
and created truly unique films.
One of Chaplin's two greatest
nontalking comedies, "Modern
Times," (the other being "City
Lights") will be shown Saturday
evening at 8 and 10 in Cubberley.
His Marxist view of the
mechanized and modernized
society is a classic film that
shouldn't be missed.
The Sunday Flicks will present
its first film of the quarter this
Sunday evening in Memorial
Auditorium. "Boys in the Band"
is a rather decent screen
adaptation of a successful
Broadway production about a
homosexual's birthday party.
"Boys in the Band" or "Who's
Afraid of Lawrence Faggot?"
treats the subject of
homosexuality with a certain
amount of sensitivity and
honesty. The film has been
endorsed by the Gay Liberation.

Thirties and Forties film freaks
will bemoan the fact that Clive
Miller will not be performing
Tuesday evenings. He is by far the
most informed film connoisseur
this campus has ever seen and his
absence will leave a big hole in the
lives of those people who had
nothing better to do on Tuesday
evenings than relive the Golden
Days of Hollywood.


CHILD PRODIGY NO MORE-Orson Welles' talents and girth
expanded rapidly since his boyhood days on the silver screen. His
number 2 film, "The Magnificent Ambersons" is showing at
Tresidder tonight.
This weekend the usual variety
of films ranging from Chaplin's
"Modern Times" to a filmed rock
concert will be shown on campus.
Tonight the second film of the
Orson Welles Series (and the
second of Welles' career), "The
Magnificant Ambersons" will be
screened at 7, 8, and 9 in
Tresidder Union. Adapted by
Welles from Booth Tarkington's
novel, "The Magnificant
Amberson's" stars Joseph Cotton,
Agnes Moorehead, Anne Baxter
and Tim Holt. Despite brilliant
technical innovations and an
outstanding performance by
Agnes Moorehead, "The
Amberson's" failed to appeal to
the American public at the time it
was released in 1942 and was
written off as a failure.
Also this evening at 7:30 and
9:30 in Cubberley, the Volunteers
in Asia Film Series will feature
"All Quiet on the Western Front"
directed by Lewis Milestone ("Of
Mice and Men," "Les Miserables,"
Mutiny on the Bounty"). Adapted
from Remarque's novel? "All
Quiet on the Western Front" is
the story of a group of German
volunteers in World War I whose
romantic illusions of war were
shattered when the men realized
the senselessness of battle.)
