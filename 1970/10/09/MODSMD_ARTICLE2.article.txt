# Sly, SC Highlight Weekend
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Sylvester Stewart and his Family Stone will make their long-awaited
appearance here tonight at 8 p.m. in Frost Ampitheater.
More commonly known as Sly, the former San Francisco DJ will bring his
flamboyant musical family along with Carp, a country-gospel group from Los
Angeles.
Known as wild showmen, Sly and the Family Stone use as a basic element
of its music the spiritual coming together which characterises soul gospel
sounds.
The Sly concert, which is being sponsored by the ASSU Special Events
Board, troubled its on-campus promoters, who were worried about the
possibilities of a non-appearance of the group. Organizers were also concerned
about an unusual level of disorder before, during, and after the concert itself.
In anticipation of these problems, the Board took some unusual measures to
guarantee Sly's arrival and his security on campus. A performance bond was
taken out on the group, which shoudl act to provide a strong financial
incentive for showing up.
In addition, Sly's parents, are rumored to be coming for the concert, which
would mark the first time the Stewarts have seen Sly in concert. As the group's
name suggests, many of its members are cousins, brothers, and sisters.
The Special Events Board, headed by Adam Levin, has arranged for tight
security at Frost tonight. In addition to heavily guarded gates, one hundred

Thirteen years is a long time. Think about it.
Thirteen years ago, Jim Plunkett, Randy Vataiia and Jackie Brown were kids in
grammar school. John Ralston was an assistant coach, believe it or not, at
UC-Berkeley. Dick Lyman was an assistant professor of history at Washington
University in St. Louis.
Thirteen years ago the people making athletic news at Stanford were guys like
Don Manoukian, Jack Douglas and Rick McMillen. For in 1957 these immortals
lead Stanford to a 6-4 season, but more importantly a 35-7 win over USC. Little
did they know that today, 13 years later they would still be the last Stanford
team to achieve such a feat.
For although Don Parrish, Gene Washington, Ray Handley and many others
have come and gone, none have been able to win against the Trojans. And
according to a lot of LA sportswriters, experts and even Stanford students (unless
some disaster befalls USC), there will be another clever article about how long 14
years is next October.
They point to a USC team which some consider to be their best in ten years
and say, "How can they be stopped?" The Trojans have gone through 25 regular
season games without losing and only a 21-21 tie with Nebraska three weeks ago
mars their record.
When talk turns to their running game, opponents shiver. With a cast of six
running backs, all of whom could probably start for most teams in the nation,


HEISMAN TROPHY CANDIDATE—Jim Plunkett drops back to pass against Purdue. Hillary Shockley (38) gets set to block
the Midwest hordes. Fans in the background look content knowing that their seats cost only what was printed on the ticket, a
far cry from tomorrow's action. One DAILY staffer parted with $15 for a rooter seat.
special security guards hired for
the performance will be on hand.
There will be special lighting used
to watch for fence jumpers. Some
members of the Black Student
Union will aid in keeping the stage
area clear and relatively
crowd-free.
Sly and the Family Stone first
achieved their status as major
performers at the Woodstock
festival in 1 969, where they
proved one of the most exciting

acts of the entire festival. Since
then, they have had a number of
hit record releases and have
performed extensively throughout
the country.
Currently the group has four
records on release: "A Whole New
Thing," "Dance to the Music,"
"Life," and "Stand".
Tickets for the concert will be
on sale at White Plaza today at the
student price of $3.75 and $5.00
for others. No student tickets will
be sold at the gate.


NO A.W.O.L.—SIy and the Family Stone will be present and
accounted for tonight in Frost Ampitheater, along with all the
members of Carp. No out of sight tonight!
they have averaged 343 yards on
the group per game.
Leading the cast is returning
All-Conference halfback, Clarence
Davis who picked up 1334 yards
last season and has already gained
410 in four games this year. He
has been compared to two other
former Trojans, Mike Garrett and
O.J. Simpson, who were both
winners of an award not given
much publicity recently,
something called the Heisman
Trophy.
At the fullback slot is veteran
Charlie Evans who goes at 6-1
212. But Evan's understudy,
sophomore Sam Cunningham has
picked up 301 yards in a reverse

role and has also snagged seven
catches, unusual for a backup
fullback. The other three reserves,
Lou Harris, Rod McNeil and Mike
Berry are also sure to see action.
The quarterback is a vastly
underrated Jimmy Jones. He
completed only 4 2 percent of his
passes last year, but when you win
this doesn't really maUer. He is
like the previous Trojan
quarterback Steve Sogge. He'isn't
flashy but he gets the job done, as
anyone who saw the last 5 5
seconds of last year's game can
testify.
Good Receivers
And with receivers like
All-American candidate Bob

Chandler and speedy split end
Sam Dickerson to throw to the SC
passing game cannot be
overlooked. In fact last week
Jones hit 15 of 21 for 30 4 yards
and three TD's (against Oregon
St.), a performance more typical
of some other passers we know.
Now before you run off and
try to scalp your tickets, read
further. There's no doubt that SC
will score. But in most football
games it's the team that scores
most who wins. And no one is
about to write off Stanford's
offense yet.
Jones' counterpart for the
Indians is a guy named Jim
Plunkett. You remember him. He
was the guy who was in grammar
school in 1957. In the thirteen
years since he has grown just a bit
and is now considered to be one
of the greatest quarterbacks in the
game along with some guy named
Muning or Manning or something
like that.
Two years ago Plunkett picked
up 273 yards but Simpson
nullified it all with a 220 yard
performance, and Troy went
home w-ith a 27-2 4 win. Last year
Plunkett upped his performance
to 296 yards and still couldn't
win. Now he get's his final chance
against SC.
He passed up a chance at pro
football by not graduating with
his class last spring. One reason he
said was to set an example to
other kids to not drop out. But a
lot of the decision is explained in

the "Beat SC" sticker on his
locker.
With receivers like Vataha, Bob
Moore, Demea Washington and a
slowed Jack Lasater, Plunkett
should give Troy's defense fits.
And with running backs like
Brown and Hillary Shockley who
have combined for 5 07 yards so
far, the offense is ready. Plunkett
is also expected to pick up some
yards on the ground, especially
with the pitchout option play
used to such advantage two
weekends ago against Oregon.
Suit Pending
With these offenses it's
conceivable that both teams'
defenses could form a coalition
and bargain for better working
conditions. There's no doubt both
teams will score more than once
and the question is which defense
can do the job better.
Leading the visitor's defense is
one Charlie Weaver, no relation to
Mt. Idyls finest citizen. Weaver is
a 6-2 215 defensive end who
many consider to be the "finest
defensive player on the West
Coast."
McKay claims he is one of the
few players in the country who
can cover both the quarterback
and the pitchman on the option
play. This could be an important
point considering that Plunkett's
option rollout is expected to be a
big offensive weapon.
The other defensive standouts
include tackle Tody Smith, who
has been hurt and is a doubtful

starter, end Willie Hall and middle
linebacker Greg Slough. But, the
big question has to be whether the
defensive back field can stop
Stanford's air attack.
Veteran Tyrone Hudson, Mike
Halvchak and Ron Ayala, the man
whose foot ended it all last year,
are adequate performers. But the
other backs will face a severe test.
Gets His Kicks
As many of you know, Ayala
will also handle the kicking
chores. He practices with a
weighted ball, kicking from the
goal line flag. He doesn't often
miss from within 35 yards.
Steve Horowitz has the ability
to win the game for the Tribe
with his foot as well. He
seemingly had done so last year. If
he can kick as he has at times, he
just might do it this time.
The kicking game won't be
very important though if the Card
defense can't contain SC. They'll
have to stop the Trojan's
backfield bulls from picking up five
and ten yar chunks every carry.
If they can do this, they may
nullify the passing attack which
operates most effectively as a
strategically-timed alternative to
the ground attack.
Enough said. Everything is
ready for another renewal of what
is rapidly becoming one of the
most heated rivalries in sports.
Get there early and bring a lot of
food and beverages and a strong
voice. One prediction can be made
safely. Nobody's going to fall
asleep.

HISTORY REPEATS?- Bill Meyers, Stanford offensive tackle, holds his head as if pondering some
momentous calamity. Has he forgotten to turn in his reg packet? Has he suddenly forseen another
frustrating last-second defeat to USC? Has it just struck him that the answer to one of political science's
cosmic questions holds manifold evil implications for mankind? Actually, he banged his head in the
Purdue game, according to the photographer. Bill and all the rest will be ready physically- one way or
another—for the Trojans tomorrow.

Thirteen years ago, Jim Plunkett, Randy Vataiia and Jackie Brown were kids in
grammar school. John Ralston was an assistant coach, believe it or not, at
UC-Berkeley. Dick Lyman was an assistant professor of history at Washington
University in St. Louis.
Thirteen years ago the people making athletic news at Stanford were guys like
Don Manoukian, Jack Douglas and Rick McMillen. For in 1957 these immortals
lead Stanford to a 6-4 season, but more importantly a 35-7 win over USC. Little
did they know that today, 13 years later they would still be the last Stanford
team to achieve such a feat.
For although Don Parrish, Gene Washington, Ray Handley and many others
have come and gone, none have been able to win against the Trojans. And
according to a lot of LA sportswriters, experts and even Stanford students (unless
some disaster befalls USC), there will be another clever article about how long 14
years is next October.
They point to a USC team which some consider to be their best in ten years
and say, "How can they be stopped?" The Trojans have gone through 25 regular
season games without losing and only a 21-21 tie with Nebraska three weeks ago
mars their record.
When talk turns to their running game, opponents shiver. With a cast of six
running backs, all of whom could probably start for most teams in the nation,

special security guards hired for
the performance will be on hand.
There will be special lighting used
to watch for fence jumpers. Some
members of the Black Student
Union will aid in keeping the stage
area clear and relatively
crowd-free.
Sly and the Family Stone first
achieved their status as major
performers at the Woodstock
festival in 1 969, where they
proved one of the most exciting

acts of the entire festival. Since
then, they have had a number of
hit record releases and have
performed extensively throughout
the country.
Currently the group has four
records on release: "A Whole New
Thing," "Dance to the Music,"
"Life," and "Stand".
Tickets for the concert will be
on sale at White Plaza today at the
student price of $3.75 and $5.00
for others. No student tickets will
be sold at the gate.

members of Carp. No out of sight tonight!
they have averaged 343 yards on
the group per game.
Leading the cast is returning
All-Conference halfback, Clarence
Davis who picked up 1334 yards
last season and has already gained
410 in four games this year. He
has been compared to two other
former Trojans, Mike Garrett and
O.J. Simpson, who were both
winners of an award not given
much publicity recently,
something called the Heisman
Trophy.
At the fullback slot is veteran
Charlie Evans who goes at 6-1
212. But Evan's understudy,
sophomore Sam Cunningham has
picked up 301 yards in a reverse

role and has also snagged seven
catches, unusual for a backup
fullback. The other three reserves,
Lou Harris, Rod McNeil and Mike
Berry are also sure to see action.
The quarterback is a vastly
underrated Jimmy Jones. He
completed only 4 2 percent of his
passes last year, but when you win
this doesn't really maUer. He is
like the previous Trojan
quarterback Steve Sogge. He'isn't
flashy but he gets the job done, as
anyone who saw the last 5 5
seconds of last year's game can
testify.
Good Receivers
And with receivers like
All-American candidate Bob

Chandler and speedy split end
Sam Dickerson to throw to the SC
passing game cannot be
overlooked. In fact last week
Jones hit 15 of 21 for 30 4 yards
and three TD's (against Oregon
St.), a performance more typical
of some other passers we know.
Now before you run off and
try to scalp your tickets, read
further. There's no doubt that SC
will score. But in most football
games it's the team that scores
most who wins. And no one is
about to write off Stanford's
offense yet.
Jones' counterpart for the
Indians is a guy named Jim
Plunkett. You remember him. He
was the guy who was in grammar
school in 1957. In the thirteen
years since he has grown just a bit
and is now considered to be one
of the greatest quarterbacks in the
game along with some guy named
Muning or Manning or something
like that.
Two years ago Plunkett picked
up 273 yards but Simpson
nullified it all with a 220 yard
performance, and Troy went
home w-ith a 27-2 4 win. Last year
Plunkett upped his performance
to 296 yards and still couldn't
win. Now he get's his final chance
against SC.
He passed up a chance at pro
football by not graduating with
his class last spring. One reason he
said was to set an example to
other kids to not drop out. But a
lot of the decision is explained in

the "Beat SC" sticker on his
locker.
With receivers like Vataha, Bob
Moore, Demea Washington and a
slowed Jack Lasater, Plunkett
should give Troy's defense fits.
And with running backs like
Brown and Hillary Shockley who
have combined for 5 07 yards so
far, the offense is ready. Plunkett
is also expected to pick up some
yards on the ground, especially
with the pitchout option play
used to such advantage two
weekends ago against Oregon.
Suit Pending
With these offenses it's
conceivable that both teams'
defenses could form a coalition
and bargain for better working
conditions. There's no doubt both
teams will score more than once
and the question is which defense
can do the job better.
Leading the visitor's defense is
one Charlie Weaver, no relation to
Mt. Idyls finest citizen. Weaver is
a 6-2 215 defensive end who
many consider to be the "finest
defensive player on the West
Coast."
McKay claims he is one of the
few players in the country who
can cover both the quarterback
and the pitchman on the option
play. This could be an important
point considering that Plunkett's
option rollout is expected to be a
big offensive weapon.
The other defensive standouts
include tackle Tody Smith, who
has been hurt and is a doubtful

starter, end Willie Hall and middle
linebacker Greg Slough. But, the
big question has to be whether the
defensive back field can stop
Stanford's air attack.
Veteran Tyrone Hudson, Mike
Halvchak and Ron Ayala, the man
whose foot ended it all last year,
are adequate performers. But the
other backs will face a severe test.
Gets His Kicks
As many of you know, Ayala
will also handle the kicking
chores. He practices with a
weighted ball, kicking from the
goal line flag. He doesn't often
miss from within 35 yards.
Steve Horowitz has the ability
to win the game for the Tribe
with his foot as well. He
seemingly had done so last year. If
he can kick as he has at times, he
just might do it this time.
The kicking game won't be
very important though if the Card
defense can't contain SC. They'll
have to stop the Trojan's
backfield bulls from picking up five
and ten yar chunks every carry.
If they can do this, they may
nullify the passing attack which
operates most effectively as a
strategically-timed alternative to
the ground attack.
Enough said. Everything is
ready for another renewal of what
is rapidly becoming one of the
most heated rivalries in sports.
Get there early and bring a lot of
food and beverages and a strong
voice. One prediction can be made
safely. Nobody's going to fall
asleep.

HISTORY REPEATS?- Bill Meyers, Stanford offensive tackle, holds his head as if pondering some
momentous calamity. Has he forgotten to turn in his reg packet? Has he suddenly forseen another
frustrating last-second defeat to USC? Has it just struck him that the answer to one of political science's
cosmic questions holds manifold evil implications for mankind? Actually, he banged his head in the
Purdue game, according to the photographer. Bill and all the rest will be ready physically- one way or
another—for the Trojans tomorrow.
Sylvester Stewart and his Family Stone will make their long-awaited
appearance here tonight at 8 p.m. in Frost Ampitheater.
More commonly known as Sly, the former San Francisco DJ will bring his
flamboyant musical family along with Carp, a country-gospel group from Los
Angeles.
Known as wild showmen, Sly and the Family Stone use as a basic element
of its music the spiritual coming together which characterises soul gospel
sounds.
The Sly concert, which is being sponsored by the ASSU Special Events
Board, troubled its on-campus promoters, who were worried about the
possibilities of a non-appearance of the group. Organizers were also concerned
about an unusual level of disorder before, during, and after the concert itself.
In anticipation of these problems, the Board took some unusual measures to
guarantee Sly's arrival and his security on campus. A performance bond was
taken out on the group, which shoudl act to provide a strong financial
incentive for showing up.
In addition, Sly's parents, are rumored to be coming for the concert, which
would mark the first time the Stewarts have seen Sly in concert. As the group's
name suggests, many of its members are cousins, brothers, and sisters.
The Special Events Board, headed by Adam Levin, has arranged for tight
security at Frost tonight. In addition to heavily guarded gates, one hundred

special security guards hired for
the performance will be on hand.
There will be special lighting used
to watch for fence jumpers. Some
members of the Black Student
Union will aid in keeping the stage
area clear and relatively
crowd-free.
Sly and the Family Stone first
achieved their status as major
performers at the Woodstock
festival in 1 969, where they
proved one of the most exciting

acts of the entire festival. Since
then, they have had a number of
hit record releases and have
performed extensively throughout
the country.
Currently the group has four
records on release: "A Whole New
Thing," "Dance to the Music,"
"Life," and "Stand".
Tickets for the concert will be
on sale at White Plaza today at the
student price of $3.75 and $5.00
for others. No student tickets will
be sold at the gate.

members of Carp. No out of sight tonight!
they have averaged 343 yards on
the group per game.
Leading the cast is returning
All-Conference halfback, Clarence
Davis who picked up 1334 yards
last season and has already gained
410 in four games this year. He
has been compared to two other
former Trojans, Mike Garrett and
O.J. Simpson, who were both
winners of an award not given
much publicity recently,
something called the Heisman
Trophy.
At the fullback slot is veteran
Charlie Evans who goes at 6-1
212. But Evan's understudy,
sophomore Sam Cunningham has
picked up 301 yards in a reverse

role and has also snagged seven
catches, unusual for a backup
fullback. The other three reserves,
Lou Harris, Rod McNeil and Mike
Berry are also sure to see action.
The quarterback is a vastly
underrated Jimmy Jones. He
completed only 4 2 percent of his
passes last year, but when you win
this doesn't really maUer. He is
like the previous Trojan
quarterback Steve Sogge. He'isn't
flashy but he gets the job done, as
anyone who saw the last 5 5
seconds of last year's game can
testify.
Good Receivers
And with receivers like
All-American candidate Bob

Chandler and speedy split end
Sam Dickerson to throw to the SC
passing game cannot be
overlooked. In fact last week
Jones hit 15 of 21 for 30 4 yards
and three TD's (against Oregon
St.), a performance more typical
of some other passers we know.
Now before you run off and
try to scalp your tickets, read
further. There's no doubt that SC
will score. But in most football
games it's the team that scores
most who wins. And no one is
about to write off Stanford's
offense yet.
Jones' counterpart for the
Indians is a guy named Jim
Plunkett. You remember him. He
was the guy who was in grammar
school in 1957. In the thirteen
years since he has grown just a bit
and is now considered to be one
of the greatest quarterbacks in the
game along with some guy named
Muning or Manning or something
like that.
Two years ago Plunkett picked
up 273 yards but Simpson
nullified it all with a 220 yard
performance, and Troy went
home w-ith a 27-2 4 win. Last year
Plunkett upped his performance
to 296 yards and still couldn't
win. Now he get's his final chance
against SC.
He passed up a chance at pro
football by not graduating with
his class last spring. One reason he
said was to set an example to
other kids to not drop out. But a
lot of the decision is explained in

the "Beat SC" sticker on his
locker.
With receivers like Vataha, Bob
Moore, Demea Washington and a
slowed Jack Lasater, Plunkett
should give Troy's defense fits.
And with running backs like
Brown and Hillary Shockley who
have combined for 5 07 yards so
far, the offense is ready. Plunkett
is also expected to pick up some
yards on the ground, especially
with the pitchout option play
used to such advantage two
weekends ago against Oregon.
Suit Pending
With these offenses it's
conceivable that both teams'
defenses could form a coalition
and bargain for better working
conditions. There's no doubt both
teams will score more than once
and the question is which defense
can do the job better.
Leading the visitor's defense is
one Charlie Weaver, no relation to
Mt. Idyls finest citizen. Weaver is
a 6-2 215 defensive end who
many consider to be the "finest
defensive player on the West
Coast."
McKay claims he is one of the
few players in the country who
can cover both the quarterback
and the pitchman on the option
play. This could be an important
point considering that Plunkett's
option rollout is expected to be a
big offensive weapon.
The other defensive standouts
include tackle Tody Smith, who
has been hurt and is a doubtful

starter, end Willie Hall and middle
linebacker Greg Slough. But, the
big question has to be whether the
defensive back field can stop
Stanford's air attack.
Veteran Tyrone Hudson, Mike
Halvchak and Ron Ayala, the man
whose foot ended it all last year,
are adequate performers. But the
other backs will face a severe test.
Gets His Kicks
As many of you know, Ayala
will also handle the kicking
chores. He practices with a
weighted ball, kicking from the
goal line flag. He doesn't often
miss from within 35 yards.
Steve Horowitz has the ability
to win the game for the Tribe
with his foot as well. He
seemingly had done so last year. If
he can kick as he has at times, he
just might do it this time.
The kicking game won't be
very important though if the Card
defense can't contain SC. They'll
have to stop the Trojan's
backfield bulls from picking up five
and ten yar chunks every carry.
If they can do this, they may
nullify the passing attack which
operates most effectively as a
strategically-timed alternative to
the ground attack.
Enough said. Everything is
ready for another renewal of what
is rapidly becoming one of the
most heated rivalries in sports.
Get there early and bring a lot of
food and beverages and a strong
voice. One prediction can be made
safely. Nobody's going to fall
asleep.

HISTORY REPEATS?- Bill Meyers, Stanford offensive tackle, holds his head as if pondering some
momentous calamity. Has he forgotten to turn in his reg packet? Has he suddenly forseen another
frustrating last-second defeat to USC? Has it just struck him that the answer to one of political science's
cosmic questions holds manifold evil implications for mankind? Actually, he banged his head in the
Purdue game, according to the photographer. Bill and all the rest will be ready physically- one way or
another—for the Trojans tomorrow.
Sylvester Stewart and his Family Stone will make their long-awaited
appearance here tonight at 8 p.m. in Frost Ampitheater.
More commonly known as Sly, the former San Francisco DJ will bring his
flamboyant musical family along with Carp, a country-gospel group from Los
Angeles.
Known as wild showmen, Sly and the Family Stone use as a basic element
of its music the spiritual coming together which characterises soul gospel
sounds.
The Sly concert, which is being sponsored by the ASSU Special Events
Board, troubled its on-campus promoters, who were worried about the
possibilities of a non-appearance of the group. Organizers were also concerned
about an unusual level of disorder before, during, and after the concert itself.
In anticipation of these problems, the Board took some unusual measures to
guarantee Sly's arrival and his security on campus. A performance bond was
taken out on the group, which shoudl act to provide a strong financial
incentive for showing up.
In addition, Sly's parents, are rumored to be coming for the concert, which
would mark the first time the Stewarts have seen Sly in concert. As the group's
name suggests, many of its members are cousins, brothers, and sisters.
The Special Events Board, headed by Adam Levin, has arranged for tight
security at Frost tonight. In addition to heavily guarded gates, one hundred

Thirteen years is a long time. Think about it.
Thirteen years ago, Jim Plunkett, Randy Vataiia and Jackie Brown were kids in
grammar school. John Ralston was an assistant coach, believe it or not, at
UC-Berkeley. Dick Lyman was an assistant professor of history at Washington
University in St. Louis.
Thirteen years ago the people making athletic news at Stanford were guys like
Don Manoukian, Jack Douglas and Rick McMillen. For in 1957 these immortals
lead Stanford to a 6-4 season, but more importantly a 35-7 win over USC. Little
did they know that today, 13 years later they would still be the last Stanford
team to achieve such a feat.
For although Don Parrish, Gene Washington, Ray Handley and many others
have come and gone, none have been able to win against the Trojans. And
according to a lot of LA sportswriters, experts and even Stanford students (unless
some disaster befalls USC), there will be another clever article about how long 14
years is next October.
They point to a USC team which some consider to be their best in ten years
and say, "How can they be stopped?" The Trojans have gone through 25 regular
season games without losing and only a 21-21 tie with Nebraska three weeks ago
mars their record.

members of Carp. No out of sight tonight!
they have averaged 343 yards on
the group per game.
Leading the cast is returning
All-Conference halfback, Clarence
Davis who picked up 1334 yards
last season and has already gained
410 in four games this year. He
has been compared to two other
former Trojans, Mike Garrett and
O.J. Simpson, who were both
winners of an award not given
much publicity recently,
something called the Heisman
Trophy.
At the fullback slot is veteran
Charlie Evans who goes at 6-1
212. But Evan's understudy,
sophomore Sam Cunningham has
picked up 301 yards in a reverse

role and has also snagged seven
catches, unusual for a backup
fullback. The other three reserves,
Lou Harris, Rod McNeil and Mike
Berry are also sure to see action.
The quarterback is a vastly
underrated Jimmy Jones. He
completed only 4 2 percent of his
passes last year, but when you win
this doesn't really maUer. He is
like the previous Trojan
quarterback Steve Sogge. He'isn't
flashy but he gets the job done, as
anyone who saw the last 5 5
seconds of last year's game can
testify.
Good Receivers
And with receivers like
All-American candidate Bob

Chandler and speedy split end
Sam Dickerson to throw to the SC
passing game cannot be
overlooked. In fact last week
Jones hit 15 of 21 for 30 4 yards
and three TD's (against Oregon
St.), a performance more typical
of some other passers we know.
Now before you run off and
try to scalp your tickets, read
further. There's no doubt that SC
will score. But in most football
games it's the team that scores
most who wins. And no one is
about to write off Stanford's
offense yet.
Jones' counterpart for the
Indians is a guy named Jim
Plunkett. You remember him. He
was the guy who was in grammar
school in 1957. In the thirteen
years since he has grown just a bit
and is now considered to be one
of the greatest quarterbacks in the
game along with some guy named
Muning or Manning or something
like that.
Two years ago Plunkett picked
up 273 yards but Simpson
nullified it all with a 220 yard
performance, and Troy went
home w-ith a 27-2 4 win. Last year
Plunkett upped his performance
to 296 yards and still couldn't
win. Now he get's his final chance
against SC.
He passed up a chance at pro
football by not graduating with
his class last spring. One reason he
said was to set an example to
other kids to not drop out. But a
lot of the decision is explained in

the "Beat SC" sticker on his
locker.
With receivers like Vataha, Bob
Moore, Demea Washington and a
slowed Jack Lasater, Plunkett
should give Troy's defense fits.
And with running backs like
Brown and Hillary Shockley who
have combined for 5 07 yards so
far, the offense is ready. Plunkett
is also expected to pick up some
yards on the ground, especially
with the pitchout option play
used to such advantage two
weekends ago against Oregon.
Suit Pending
With these offenses it's
conceivable that both teams'
defenses could form a coalition
and bargain for better working
conditions. There's no doubt both
teams will score more than once
and the question is which defense
can do the job better.
Leading the visitor's defense is
one Charlie Weaver, no relation to
Mt. Idyls finest citizen. Weaver is
a 6-2 215 defensive end who
many consider to be the "finest
defensive player on the West
Coast."
McKay claims he is one of the
few players in the country who
can cover both the quarterback
and the pitchman on the option
play. This could be an important
point considering that Plunkett's
option rollout is expected to be a
big offensive weapon.
The other defensive standouts
include tackle Tody Smith, who
has been hurt and is a doubtful

starter, end Willie Hall and middle
linebacker Greg Slough. But, the
big question has to be whether the
defensive back field can stop
Stanford's air attack.
Veteran Tyrone Hudson, Mike
Halvchak and Ron Ayala, the man
whose foot ended it all last year,
are adequate performers. But the
other backs will face a severe test.
Gets His Kicks
As many of you know, Ayala
will also handle the kicking
chores. He practices with a
weighted ball, kicking from the
goal line flag. He doesn't often
miss from within 35 yards.
Steve Horowitz has the ability
to win the game for the Tribe
with his foot as well. He
seemingly had done so last year. If
he can kick as he has at times, he
just might do it this time.
The kicking game won't be
very important though if the Card
defense can't contain SC. They'll
have to stop the Trojan's
backfield bulls from picking up five
and ten yar chunks every carry.
If they can do this, they may
nullify the passing attack which
operates most effectively as a
strategically-timed alternative to
the ground attack.
Enough said. Everything is
ready for another renewal of what
is rapidly becoming one of the
most heated rivalries in sports.
Get there early and bring a lot of
food and beverages and a strong
voice. One prediction can be made
safely. Nobody's going to fall
asleep.

HISTORY REPEATS?- Bill Meyers, Stanford offensive tackle, holds his head as if pondering some
momentous calamity. Has he forgotten to turn in his reg packet? Has he suddenly forseen another
frustrating last-second defeat to USC? Has it just struck him that the answer to one of political science's
cosmic questions holds manifold evil implications for mankind? Actually, he banged his head in the
Purdue game, according to the photographer. Bill and all the rest will be ready physically- one way or
another—for the Trojans tomorrow.
Sylvester Stewart and his Family Stone will make their long-awaited
appearance here tonight at 8 p.m. in Frost Ampitheater.
More commonly known as Sly, the former San Francisco DJ will bring his
flamboyant musical family along with Carp, a country-gospel group from Los
Angeles.
Known as wild showmen, Sly and the Family Stone use as a basic element
of its music the spiritual coming together which characterises soul gospel
sounds.
The Sly concert, which is being sponsored by the ASSU Special Events
Board, troubled its on-campus promoters, who were worried about the
possibilities of a non-appearance of the group. Organizers were also concerned
about an unusual level of disorder before, during, and after the concert itself.
In anticipation of these problems, the Board took some unusual measures to
guarantee Sly's arrival and his security on campus. A performance bond was
taken out on the group, which shoudl act to provide a strong financial
incentive for showing up.
In addition, Sly's parents, are rumored to be coming for the concert, which
would mark the first time the Stewarts have seen Sly in concert. As the group's
name suggests, many of its members are cousins, brothers, and sisters.
The Special Events Board, headed by Adam Levin, has arranged for tight
security at Frost tonight. In addition to heavily guarded gates, one hundred

Thirteen years is a long time. Think about it.
Thirteen years ago, Jim Plunkett, Randy Vataiia and Jackie Brown were kids in
grammar school. John Ralston was an assistant coach, believe it or not, at
UC-Berkeley. Dick Lyman was an assistant professor of history at Washington
University in St. Louis.
Thirteen years ago the people making athletic news at Stanford were guys like
Don Manoukian, Jack Douglas and Rick McMillen. For in 1957 these immortals
lead Stanford to a 6-4 season, but more importantly a 35-7 win over USC. Little
did they know that today, 13 years later they would still be the last Stanford
team to achieve such a feat.
For although Don Parrish, Gene Washington, Ray Handley and many others
have come and gone, none have been able to win against the Trojans. And
according to a lot of LA sportswriters, experts and even Stanford students (unless
some disaster befalls USC), there will be another clever article about how long 14
years is next October.
They point to a USC team which some consider to be their best in ten years
and say, "How can they be stopped?" The Trojans have gone through 25 regular
season games without losing and only a 21-21 tie with Nebraska three weeks ago
mars their record.
When talk turns to their running game, opponents shiver. With a cast of six
running backs, all of whom could probably start for most teams in the nation,

the performance will be on hand.
There will be special lighting used
to watch for fence jumpers. Some
members of the Black Student
Union will aid in keeping the stage
area clear and relatively

Sly and the Family Stone first
achieved their status as major
performers at the Woodstock
festival in 1 969, where they
proved one of the most exciting

acts of the entire festival. Since
then, they have had a number of
hit record releases and have
performed extensively throughout
the country.
Currently the group has four
records on release: "A Whole New
Thing," "Dance to the Music,"
"Life," and "Stand".
Tickets for the concert will be
on sale at White Plaza today at the
student price of $3.75 and $5.00
for others. No student tickets will
be sold at the gate.

testify.
Good Receivers
And with receivers like
All-American candidate Bob

Chandler and speedy split end
Sam Dickerson to throw to the SC
passing game cannot be
overlooked. In fact last week
Jones hit 15 of 21 for 30 4 yards
and three TD's (against Oregon
St.), a performance more typical
of some other passers we know.
Now before you run off and
try to scalp your tickets, read
further. There's no doubt that SC
will score. But in most football
games it's the team that scores
most who wins. And no one is
about to write off Stanford's
offense yet.
Jones' counterpart for the
Indians is a guy named Jim
Plunkett. You remember him. He
was the guy who was in grammar
school in 1957. In the thirteen
years since he has grown just a bit
and is now considered to be one
of the greatest quarterbacks in the
game along with some guy named
Muning or Manning or something
like that.
Two years ago Plunkett picked
up 273 yards but Simpson
nullified it all with a 220 yard
performance, and Troy went
home w-ith a 27-2 4 win. Last year
Plunkett upped his performance
to 296 yards and still couldn't
win. Now he get's his final chance
against SC.
He passed up a chance at pro
football by not graduating with
his class last spring. One reason he
said was to set an example to
other kids to not drop out. But a
lot of the decision is explained in

the "Beat SC" sticker on his
locker.
With receivers like Vataha, Bob
Moore, Demea Washington and a
slowed Jack Lasater, Plunkett
should give Troy's defense fits.
And with running backs like
Brown and Hillary Shockley who
have combined for 5 07 yards so
far, the offense is ready. Plunkett
is also expected to pick up some
yards on the ground, especially
with the pitchout option play
used to such advantage two
weekends ago against Oregon.
Suit Pending
With these offenses it's
conceivable that both teams'
defenses could form a coalition
and bargain for better working
conditions. There's no doubt both
teams will score more than once
and the question is which defense
can do the job better.
Leading the visitor's defense is
one Charlie Weaver, no relation to
Mt. Idyls finest citizen. Weaver is
a 6-2 215 defensive end who
many consider to be the "finest
defensive player on the West
Coast."
McKay claims he is one of the
few players in the country who
can cover both the quarterback
and the pitchman on the option
play. This could be an important
point considering that Plunkett's
option rollout is expected to be a
big offensive weapon.
The other defensive standouts
include tackle Tody Smith, who
has been hurt and is a doubtful

starter, end Willie Hall and middle
linebacker Greg Slough. But, the
big question has to be whether the
defensive back field can stop
Stanford's air attack.
Veteran Tyrone Hudson, Mike
Halvchak and Ron Ayala, the man
whose foot ended it all last year,
are adequate performers. But the
other backs will face a severe test.
Gets His Kicks
As many of you know, Ayala
will also handle the kicking
chores. He practices with a
weighted ball, kicking from the
goal line flag. He doesn't often
miss from within 35 yards.
Steve Horowitz has the ability
to win the game for the Tribe
with his foot as well. He
seemingly had done so last year. If
he can kick as he has at times, he
just might do it this time.
The kicking game won't be
very important though if the Card
defense can't contain SC. They'll
have to stop the Trojan's
backfield bulls from picking up five
and ten yar chunks every carry.
If they can do this, they may
nullify the passing attack which
operates most effectively as a
strategically-timed alternative to
the ground attack.
Enough said. Everything is
ready for another renewal of what
is rapidly becoming one of the
most heated rivalries in sports.
Get there early and bring a lot of
food and beverages and a strong
voice. One prediction can be made
safely. Nobody's going to fall
asleep.

HISTORY REPEATS?- Bill Meyers, Stanford offensive tackle, holds his head as if pondering some
momentous calamity. Has he forgotten to turn in his reg packet? Has he suddenly forseen another
frustrating last-second defeat to USC? Has it just struck him that the answer to one of political science's
cosmic questions holds manifold evil implications for mankind? Actually, he banged his head in the
Purdue game, according to the photographer. Bill and all the rest will be ready physically- one way or
another—for the Trojans tomorrow.
Sylvester Stewart and his Family Stone will make their long-awaited
appearance here tonight at 8 p.m. in Frost Ampitheater.
More commonly known as Sly, the former San Francisco DJ will bring his
flamboyant musical family along with Carp, a country-gospel group from Los
Angeles.
Known as wild showmen, Sly and the Family Stone use as a basic element
of its music the spiritual coming together which characterises soul gospel
sounds.
The Sly concert, which is being sponsored by the ASSU Special Events
Board, troubled its on-campus promoters, who were worried about the
possibilities of a non-appearance of the group. Organizers were also concerned
about an unusual level of disorder before, during, and after the concert itself.
In anticipation of these problems, the Board took some unusual measures to
guarantee Sly's arrival and his security on campus. A performance bond was
taken out on the group, which shoudl act to provide a strong financial
incentive for showing up.
In addition, Sly's parents, are rumored to be coming for the concert, which
would mark the first time the Stewarts have seen Sly in concert. As the group's
name suggests, many of its members are cousins, brothers, and sisters.
The Special Events Board, headed by Adam Levin, has arranged for tight
security at Frost tonight. In addition to heavily guarded gates, one hundred

Thirteen years is a long time. Think about it.
Thirteen years ago, Jim Plunkett, Randy Vataiia and Jackie Brown were kids in
grammar school. John Ralston was an assistant coach, believe it or not, at
UC-Berkeley. Dick Lyman was an assistant professor of history at Washington
University in St. Louis.
Thirteen years ago the people making athletic news at Stanford were guys like
Don Manoukian, Jack Douglas and Rick McMillen. For in 1957 these immortals
lead Stanford to a 6-4 season, but more importantly a 35-7 win over USC. Little
did they know that today, 13 years later they would still be the last Stanford
team to achieve such a feat.
For although Don Parrish, Gene Washington, Ray Handley and many others
have come and gone, none have been able to win against the Trojans. And
according to a lot of LA sportswriters, experts and even Stanford students (unless
some disaster befalls USC), there will be another clever article about how long 14
years is next October.
They point to a USC team which some consider to be their best in ten years
and say, "How can they be stopped?" The Trojans have gone through 25 regular
season games without losing and only a 21-21 tie with Nebraska three weeks ago
mars their record.
When talk turns to their running game, opponents shiver. With a cast of six
running backs, all of whom could probably start for most teams in the nation,


HEISMAN TROPHY CANDIDATE—Jim Plunkett drops back to pass against Purdue. Hillary Shockley (38) gets set to block
the Midwest hordes. Fans in the background look content knowing that their seats cost only what was printed on the ticket, a
far cry from tomorrow's action. One DAILY staffer parted with $15 for a rooter seat.
special security guards hired for
the performance will be on hand.
There will be special lighting used
to watch for fence jumpers. Some
members of the Black Student
Union will aid in keeping the stage
area clear and relatively
crowd-free.
Sly and the Family Stone first
achieved their status as major
performers at the Woodstock
festival in 1 969, where they
proved one of the most exciting

acts of the entire festival. Since
then, they have had a number of
hit record releases and have
performed extensively throughout
the country.
Currently the group has four
records on release: "A Whole New
Thing," "Dance to the Music,"
"Life," and "Stand".
Tickets for the concert will be
on sale at White Plaza today at the
student price of $3.75 and $5.00
for others. No student tickets will
be sold at the gate.


NO A.W.O.L.—SIy and the Family Stone will be present and
accounted for tonight in Frost Ampitheater, along with all the
members of Carp. No out of sight tonight!
they have averaged 343 yards on
the group per game.
Leading the cast is returning
All-Conference halfback, Clarence
Davis who picked up 1334 yards
last season and has already gained
410 in four games this year. He
has been compared to two other
former Trojans, Mike Garrett and
O.J. Simpson, who were both
winners of an award not given
much publicity recently,
something called the Heisman
Trophy.
At the fullback slot is veteran
Charlie Evans who goes at 6-1
212. But Evan's understudy,
sophomore Sam Cunningham has
picked up 301 yards in a reverse

role and has also snagged seven
catches, unusual for a backup
fullback. The other three reserves,
Lou Harris, Rod McNeil and Mike
Berry are also sure to see action.
The quarterback is a vastly
underrated Jimmy Jones. He
completed only 4 2 percent of his
passes last year, but when you win
this doesn't really maUer. He is
like the previous Trojan
quarterback Steve Sogge. He'isn't
flashy but he gets the job done, as
anyone who saw the last 5 5
seconds of last year's game can
testify.
