# Sly, SC Highlight Weekend

### DON TOLLEFSON 
Sylvester Stewart and his Family Stone will make their long-awaited
appearance here tonight at 8 p.m. in Frost Ampitheater.
More commonly known as Sly, the former San Francisco DJ will bring his
flamboyant musical family along with Carp, a country-gospel group from Los
Angeles.
Known as wild showmen, Sly and the Family Stone use as a basic element
of its music the spiritual coming together which characterises soul gospel
sounds.
The Sly concert, which is being sponsored by the ASSU Special Events
Board, troubled its on-campus promoters, who were worried about the
possibilities of a non-appearance of the group. Organizers were also concerned
about an unusual level of disorder before, during, and after the concert itself.
In anticipation of these problems, the Board took some unusual measures to
guarantee Sly's arrival and his security on campus. A performance bond was
taken out on the group, which shoudl act to provide a strong financial
incentive for showing up.
In addition, Sly's parents, are rumored to be coming for the concert, which
would mark the first time the Stewarts have seen Sly in concert. As the group's
name suggests, many of its members are cousins, brothers, and sisters.
The Special Events Board, headed by Adam Levin, has arranged for tight
security at Frost tonight. In addition to heavily guarded gates, one hundred

Thirteen years is a long time. Think about it.
Thirteen years ago, Jim Plunkett, Randy Vataiia and Jackie Brown were kids in
grammar school. John Ralston was an assistant coach, believe it or not, at
UC-Berkeley. Dick Lyman was an assistant professor of history at Washington
University in St. Louis.
Thirteen years ago the people making athletic news at Stanford were guys like
Don Manoukian, Jack Douglas and Rick McMillen. For in 1957 these immortals
lead Stanford to a 6-4 season, but more importantly a 35-7 win over USC. Little
did they know that today, 13 years later they would still be the last Stanford
team to achieve such a feat.
For although Don Parrish, Gene Washington, Ray Handley and many others
have come and gone, none have been able to win against the Trojans. And
according to a lot of LA sportswriters, experts and even Stanford students (unless
some disaster befalls USC), there will be another clever article about how long 14
years is next October.
They point to a USC team which some consider to be their best in ten years
and say, "How can they be stopped?" The Trojans have gone through 25 regular
season games without losing and only a 21-21 tie with Nebraska three weeks ago
mars their record.
When talk turns to their running game, opponents shiver. With a cast of six
running backs, all of whom could probably start for most teams in the nation,


HEISMAN TROPHY CANDIDATE—Jim Plunkett drops back to pass against Purdue. Hillary Shockley (38) gets set to block
the Midwest hordes. Fans in the background look content knowing that their seats cost only what was printed on the ticket, a
far cry from tomorrow's action. One DAILY staffer parted with $15 for a rooter seat.
