## USC Report 
### 
Note: The following is written by Mike Mitchell, assistant sports
editor of the Daily Trojan which is the local sheet at USC. Daily
sports completed the exchange of journalistic futility by dictating a
column to the Daily Trojan reflecting Stanford's view of tomorrow's
game.
The definition of such abstracts as pride and desire is something
which philosophers have debated for centuries. Often examples have
to suffice for the true meanings.
Stanford versus USC, the Rose Bowl, the national ratings—all have
something to do with pride and desire.
These two abstracts are not easily put into words but both the
Trojans and the Indians know what they are.
Trojan coach John McKay sees the pride and desire at work and he
knows that these virtues don't spring up overnight.
"Many of our players decided when they were in junior high school
that they wanted to go to USC," McKay said.
"They want to win for the school; it's one thing that they can
really do well."
Over at Stanford, the Indians have a more tangible reason for
wanting to win—revenge.
Magazines, newspapers and television have all carried the words of
quarterback Jim Plunkett who wants more than anything to beat the
Trojans and go to the Rose Bowl.
Plunkett wants to win so much that he turned down many
lucrative professional offers to return to Stanford even though his
family's financial condition is not good.
It seems obvious that Plunkett and Company were looking ahead
to USC one week too early as they were defeated by Purdue last
week.
This is another problem with which McKay is well acquainted.
"Football is not a faucet that you can turn on and off," said
McKay.
"You turn it on Tuesday and it builds up all week."
McKay knows that during the week players talk to friends who tell
them a weaker team such as Purdue will be a pushover and so they let
down and consequently lose.
And so the Trojan head coach believes that experience is a great
teacher. The Trojans got their lesson against Nebraska and the Indians
got theirs against the Boilermakers.
But there is no problem of getting up for this week's contest.
McKay will run his normal offense for the simple reason that it is
easier to run an offense that you are familiar with than one you are
not, according to McKay.
The Trojans will have to defend against both a strong passing
attack and a solid running game.
Against Oregon State and lowa, the defense could concentrate
more on the run because neither of those opponents had the kind of
effective passing threat that Plunkett poses.
The young defensive secondary has not been seriously tested until
now, but Saturday will certainly be a good one.
The Indians, in turn, will have to stop the Trojans own double
attack.
"For any team to beat us, and certainly any team might," said
McKay, "they will have to play us as a balanced team."
The Trojans will probably try to take advantage of the
inexperienced Indian secondary, much as they will challenge the USC
secondary.
But there won't be any keying on any one man nor any big pass
rush. Against two such well balanced offenses, the defense will have to
divide its resources evenly.
Beside Plunkett, McKay looks for big games from defensive ends
Dave Tipton and running back Jack Lasater.
Most of the Trojan starting lineup is ready and healthy. The one
big question mark is defensive lineman Tody Smith.
Tody has been out the last two weeks, but he started practicing
against this week. He favors a sore right ankle, but he seems to be
doing well.
McKay says he won't know until game time Saturday whether the
big man will play. Tody says he is ready now.
And so the stage is set.
Pride and desire will be there—on both sides.
The contest may not provide any concrete definitions to the
concepts of pride and desire, but the game itself should be a rather
definitive example.
