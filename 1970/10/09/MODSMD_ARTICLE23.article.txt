## All Sold Out 
### Fred Leeson 
When a few old friends get together to throw their annual party, it
would seem that a nice round number like 87,000 spaces should
suffice just fine.
But not this time.
The stadium for tomorrow's football game has been sold
out—technically—for weeks, students with tickets are expecting to
wait 10 and 12 hours by the stadium gates to get a good seat, and the
press is clamoring for mr e space. Some party
One enterprising gentleman prepared himself in advance for it by
allegedly buying blocks of tickets and selling them in turn for
whatever price he could get.
Maybe you've seen the ads in the papers: "Stanford-USC, Bigger
than the Rose Bowl" and some phone numbers listed below.
"We're quite sure who he is," said Stanford Ticket Manager Ted
(Harrow, "and I have a reasonable idea how he got the tickets."
Glarrow said there were many requests for blocks of 25 to 4 2
tickets, and purchasers said they were bringing in bus loads from other
cities.
Daily sports called the number yesterday to get some idea of what
the prices were.
"Ticket sales," said the telephone voice. "We have a few tickets left
over from a tour cancellation." End zone general admission tickets
were priced at $10.50. Stanford's price for the same ticket is/was $3.
You can guess, then, what the gentleman must have gotten for
good reserved seats, assuming he had some.
"I've been in tickets for 15 years," Glarrow said, "and I went
through a World Series with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1960. I'm not
naive about this kind of thing, but it never fails to rankle me."
The sports department has also been flooded with press requests,
like about three times the roughly 45 0 there is room for in the press
box.
As a result, dedicated scribes from the Gustine Standard, Grass
Valley Union, Orange Coast Daily Pilot, and Merced Mercury Sun
Standard—not to mention the Placentia Courier—have had to do
without.
So have some of the biggies, like Melvin Durslag of the Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner and the west coast stringer from Sports Illustrated.
The sports office has assured Sports Illustrated, however, that if the
magazine decides to send one of its main writers—like Dan
Jenkins—there'll be a space somewhere.
Likewise there's a space for Newsweek's Min Yee who not so
coincidently happened to write the friendly full-page feature on Jim
Plunkett in this week's issue.
For the edification of the trivialists, Stanford Stadium was built to
seat 90,000. Presumably the seats are still there, but official capacity
is now 87,206.
That's all the fire marshall allows these days. Then again the
maximum figure is planned for 1 6-inch rear ends, but as Glarrow ably
pointed out, not all rear ends these days fit into 16 inches of seat.
Student rooter tickets are said to be going for $15 . Some students
say they will take in Sly Friday night and then go over and sleep near
the stadium to make sure they get in early.
Again, some party.



DEFENSE—If you've bothered
reading any sports articles this
week you're aware of the
magnitude of USC's vaunted
running offense. Stanford tackle
Greg Sampson (91), above, rips
into Purdue's Otis Armstrong (24)
in a style that will have to be
commonplace tomorrow against
the Trojans if the Indians hope to
win. At right, dolly Jeannette
Jones holds her arms above her
head in—if you're the optimistic
type—a "V" for victory. If you're
the kind who has a history of
heart trouble or for any other
reason weren't able to get a ticket
for the game, there's water polo
this afternoon at 3 p.m. and again
tomorrow at 10 a.m.

"Ticket sales," said the telephone voice. "We have a few tickets left
over from a tour cancellation." End zone general admission tickets
were priced at $10.50. Stanford's price for the same ticket is/was $3.
You can guess, then, what the gentleman must have gotten for
good reserved seats, assuming he had some.
"I've been in tickets for 15 years," Glarrow said, "and I went
through a World Series with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1960. I'm not
naive about this kind of thing, but it never fails to rankle me."
The sports department has also been flooded with press requests,
like about three times the roughly 45 0 there is room for in the press
box.
As a result, dedicated scribes from the Gustine Standard, Grass
Valley Union, Orange Coast Daily Pilot, and Merced Mercury Sun
Standard—not to mention the Placentia Courier—have had to do
without.
So have some of the biggies, like Melvin Durslag of the Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner and the west coast stringer from Sports Illustrated.
The sports office has assured Sports Illustrated, however, that if the
magazine decides to send one of its main writers—like Dan
Jenkins—there'll be a space somewhere.
Likewise there's a space for Newsweek's Min Yee who not so
coincidently happened to write the friendly full-page feature on Jim
Plunkett in this week's issue.
For the edification of the trivialists, Stanford Stadium was built to
seat 90,000. Presumably the seats are still there, but official capacity
is now 87,206.
That's all the fire marshall allows these days. Then again the
maximum figure is planned for 1 6-inch rear ends, but as Glarrow ably
pointed out, not all rear ends these days fit into 16 inches of seat.
Student rooter tickets are said to be going for $15 . Some students
say they will take in Sly Friday night and then go over and sleep near
the stadium to make sure they get in early.
Again, some party.
