Peace Plan Denounced
PARIS — The United States submitted President Nixon's
Indochina plan at the Vietnam peace talks Thursday. Not
unexpectedly, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
denounced it.
But they conceded this was a preliminary reaction, and
U.S. Ambassador David K.E. Bruce said: "I am not
discouraged."
Bruce introduced the plan at the 8 7 th session of the
talks and said: "It is our most earnest hope that the
President's proposals will receive the most careful study and
considered response by your side."
North Vietnamese Ambassador Xuan Thuy hastened to
call the plan "an electoral gift certificate." Mrs. Nguyen Thi
Binh of the Viet Cong said the proposals were a means "of
legalizing American aggression in Indochina."
The Communist delegations—while making what
sounded like noises of rejection—reserved the right of
further commentary.
President Nixon said in Savannah, Ga., that world
reaction to his proposal was "overwhelmingly good." He
told newsmen he hoped North Vietnam will take it
seriously.
Agnew Blasts Dellums
FORT SMITH, Ark. — Vice President Sprio T. Agnew said
Thursday night that leading Democrats are fav* ing over
"an enthusiastic backer and supporter of the Black Panther
party."
In a prepared speech opening his Southern campaign
swing, Agnew singled out Ronald Dellums, Democratic
candidate for Congress in the Oakland, Calif., district, and
called on Democratic voters to repudiate Dellums and all
who aid him.
"This out and out radical was the sole beneficiary of a

special fund-raising cocktail party last week hosted by none
other than Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Harold
Hughes of lowa, Birch Bayh of Indiana, Fred Harris of
Oklahoma, Walter Mondale of Minnesota, Alan Cranston of
California and George McGovernof South Dakota."
Such democratic leaders, he said, "instead of running the
radicals out of their party, embrace them, fawn over them,
identify with them and raise money for them . . . They shall
answer to history for what they have done to the
Democratic party."
Agnew said Dellums was keynote speaker two years ago
at a birthday party for Black Panther Defc .se Minister
Huey P. Newton, at which Eldridge Cleaver, Bobby Seale
and H. Rap Brown also appeared.
Marshall Univ. 'Riot 9
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — About 100 city and state police
armed with tear gas and shotguns marched onto the
Marshall University campus early Friday and dispersed a
crowd they estimated at 2,000.
State police sprayed pepper gas and threw tear gas
canisters into the crowd that refused to leave the area. A
riot situation was declared by Mayor Robert Heinerman.
Police arrested at least three of the demonstrators.
The confrontation came student demonstrators gathered
on a main city street on the edge of the campus. City police
were sent in to disperse the crowd, but there was no
immediate response from the demonstrators.
Police fired four tear gas canisters at the crowd after
three firecrackers were thrown at police. One officer was
injured, police said.
Students in the crowd said they were protesting the
arrest earlier in the day of several students on narcotics
charges.
Marshall has an enrollment of about 8 ,5 00. Gov. Arch A.
Moore Jr. said he dispatched State Police reserve riot forces
to Huntington to assist.
