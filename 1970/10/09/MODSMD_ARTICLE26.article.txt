# Guerilla Leader Explains Policies
## 
### CAROL LEWIS 
"We have no intention of pushing
the Jews into the sea," comrade Sahli
of the Democratic Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine told an
audience in Tresidder Wednesday
evening.
"We are not involved in a purely
military struggle ... There are two
fronts* the military front, and more
importantly, the Palestinian—Jor
danians themselves."
Those peoples, displaced by the
formation of the Zionist state, must be
lifted out of the "mental inertia and
dependence forced upon them in the
refugee camps after the dispersal of
1948 ," claimed the representative of
the Marxist-Leninist oriented front.
Stating that the fight for power in
Jordan with King Hussein, a "lackey of
American imperialism," has
"disappointed expectations that the
struggle would be over in 48 hours,"
Sahli claimed that "We (the DPF) have
an army which is on every roof, behind
every door and window."

"We are more popular," asserted
Sahli, pointing to a New York Times
article discounting general Jordanian
support for Hussein over guerilla
commandos. "Hussein reigns as a
goldface military dictator .. . His only
friends are the generals and the army."
The army, Sahli added, "is a
mercenary force."
Sahli said his group's forces are not
aimed towards simply retrieving the
lands of the Palestinians; rather, they
are directed against imperialistic forces,
specifically the United States, and
reactionary forces currently
represented by King Hussein and the
Zionist forces.
Sahli carefully stated that it is the
Zionist movement and not the Israeli
people who are the enemies of his
liberation front.
As evidence of his group's success in
arousing displaced Palestinians, Sahli
cited worker strikes and the "People's
Militia."
Equally important are the directly

elected countils which fill both a
political and educational function.
"People could really learn the
meaning of voting ... of discussing
political issues ... of bearing
responsibility..." through these
councils, he stated.
Responding to questions, Sahli
criticized the recent hijackings by the
Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, as separate organization of
the same liberation movement, as
unjustifiable.
"Hijackings emphasize the individual
act of courage which the masses can
follow only behind a transistor radio.
There is no mass involvement."
He added that "the hijackings lead
to results and complexities beyond
control of the revolutionist."
Sahli minimized factional
differences within the liberation front
and condemned the "bourgeois news
media" for playing up tensions among
the separate groups.
The program was sponsored by the
Third World Student Union.

dependence forced upon them in the
refugee camps after the dispersal of
1948 ," claimed the representative of
the Marxist-Leninist oriented front.
Stating that the fight for power in
Jordan with King Hussein, a "lackey of
American imperialism," has
"disappointed expectations that the
struggle would be over in 48 hours,"
Sahli claimed that "We (the DPF) have
an army which is on every roof, behind
every door and window."

"We are more popular," asserted
Sahli, pointing to a New York Times
article discounting general Jordanian
support for Hussein over guerilla
commandos. "Hussein reigns as a
goldface military dictator .. . His only
friends are the generals and the army."
The army, Sahli added, "is a
mercenary force."
Sahli said his group's forces are not
aimed towards simply retrieving the
lands of the Palestinians; rather, they
are directed against imperialistic forces,
specifically the United States, and
reactionary forces currently
represented by King Hussein and the
Zionist forces.
Sahli carefully stated that it is the
Zionist movement and not the Israeli
people who are the enemies of his
liberation front.
As evidence of his group's success in
arousing displaced Palestinians, Sahli
cited worker strikes and the "People's
Militia."
Equally important are the directly

elected countils which fill both a
political and educational function.
"People could really learn the
meaning of voting ... of discussing
political issues ... of bearing
responsibility..." through these
councils, he stated.
Responding to questions, Sahli
criticized the recent hijackings by the
Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, as separate organization of
the same liberation movement, as
unjustifiable.
"Hijackings emphasize the individual
act of courage which the masses can
follow only behind a transistor radio.
There is no mass involvement."
He added that "the hijackings lead
to results and complexities beyond
control of the revolutionist."
Sahli minimized factional
differences within the liberation front
and condemned the "bourgeois news
media" for playing up tensions among
the separate groups.
The program was sponsored by the
Third World Student Union.
"We have no intention of pushing
the Jews into the sea," comrade Sahli
of the Democratic Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine told an
audience in Tresidder Wednesday
evening.
"We are not involved in a purely
military struggle ... There are two
fronts* the military front, and more
importantly, the Palestinian—Jor
danians themselves."
Those peoples, displaced by the
formation of the Zionist state, must be
lifted out of the "mental inertia and
dependence forced upon them in the
refugee camps after the dispersal of
1948 ," claimed the representative of
the Marxist-Leninist oriented front.
