# Police Warn Students Of Weekend Thefts
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
A rash of thefts and burglaries last
Saturday during the Purdue football
game have prompted campus security
officials to warn residents to lock their
vehicles and rooms this weekend.
The Public Safety Office is
concerned that the campus will again
be a target for thieves during the Sly
concert tonight and the USC game
tomorrow.
Last Saturday five automobiles and
several rooms were broken into during
the Purdue game. The total value of the
articles and cash taken was $2776 .
Stereo tape players, clothing and
other valuable loose articles were the
most frequent targets in the auto
burglaries.
The rooms that were entered were
unlocked and apparently chosen at
random.
Bruce Wiggins, director of public
safety, asked campus residents not to
drive to the concert or game if possible.
According to Wiggins this would not
only reduce traffic congestion but leave
fewer vehicles exposed to theives.
For those residents planning to drive
to the concert tonight, however, he
advised that a parking area at the
northwest corner of Galvoz and
Campus Drive has been lighted and
would be patrolled by Stanford Police.
Several dark areas adjacent to Palm
Drive will be blocked off, and concert
goers are urged to park in lighted areas.
Wiggins noted that most room
burglaries can be prevented by simply
locking your door, and when possible

the entire residence. In large domitory
complexes which are not locked during
the daytime, theives sometimes walk
the halls trying doors until they find an
unlocked one, Wiggins said.
Extra Stanford Police will be on
patrol tonight in the Frost Ampitheater
area where the concert will be held, but
according to Wiggins there are relatively
few men available during the daytime
to patrol residence areas.
In addition to the Stanford Police
contingent, there will be 75 ASSU
policemen and 5 0 Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputies on duty inside Frost.
About two dozen members of the
Black Students Union will be
protecting the stage itself.
