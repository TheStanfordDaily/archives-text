# Environmental Activists Prepare Recycling Project At SC Game
## 
### 
The Stanford Conservation Club will
lead one of the largest single recycling
programs ever at the USC-Stanford
football game tomorrow. Empty
beverage cans will be collected before,
during, and after the game at booths
opposite each of the gates to the
Stanford stadium. Bi-metal cans as well
as all-aluminum cans will be recycled.
The football fans are requested to
save their beverage cans when they are
emptied, rather than to throw them in
refuse barrels. At the end of the game
everyone is asked to carry his (and any
loose) cans from the stadium to the

specially designated recepticles outside
each of the eight stadium gates.
Volunteers willing to assist before,
during, or after the game are requested
to check in at the main gate at the
south end of the stadium at 10 :00 a.m.
Saturday for job assignment.
Ecology Action has a particular need
for the loan of boxes or other
recepticles for its recycling site and for
the donation of the use of trucks to
haul the scrap to the various industrial
salvage companies in the Bay Area.
