# Radical Terrorists Blamed For West Coast Bombings
## 
### 
SEATTLE (AP) â€” Predawn bomb
blasts jarred two military facilities and
a county courthouse on the West Coast
Thursday and authorities investigated a
possible conspiracy involving radical
terrorists.
There were no injuries and no
arrests, but police said they had leads in
one of the explosions.
The first blast, at 1:27 a.m., ripped
through a courtroom and rest room of
the Marin County Civic Center in San
Rafael, Calif., scene of the kidnaping
and fatal shooting of a judge Aug. 7.
The second blast, a little more than
an hour later, caused an estimated
$15 0,000 damage to a building housing
the Navy and Air Force ROTC
departments at the University of
Washington in Seattle.
At 4:17 a.m., the third explosion

shattered a section of the outside wall
of an Army National Guard Armory in
Santa Barbara, Calif.
"We certainly believe this bombing
is connected with the Weatherman
faction and other terrorist groups in
our nation today," said Santa Barbara
Police Chief A.W. Trembly.
California state police Lt. Fred
Baker said the Santa Barbara blast and
the other two explosions on the Pacific
Coast "would seem to indicate a
conspiracy."
Trembly did not elaborate, but said
his detectives and FBI agents had
several leads to the person who planted
the bomb.
The explosions occurred two days
after Bernardine Dohrn, a fugitive
leader of Weatherman, said the radical
offshoot of the Students for a
Democratic Society would soon launch
"a fall offensive."
In a tape recording played at a news

conference in New York, Miss Dohrn
said the campaign by youthful radicals
"will spread from Santa Barbara to
Boston, back to Kent State and
Kansas."
"Now we are everywhere," she
continued, "and next week families and
tribes will attack the enemy around the
country."
Miss Dohrn is among 12 members of
Weatherman indicted in April on
charges of conspiracy to cross state
lines to incite to riot.
The explosion on the campus in
Seattle, the 32 nd bombing in the city
this year, was the most destructive of
Thursday's three. It happened at 2:45
a.m., 25 minutes .-fter two anonymous
callers a man and a woman warned the
campus security police, the city fire
department and the Seattle Times that
it was coming.
Police evacuated a janitor from the
building, quickly searched it and then
sealed it off moments before the blast.
