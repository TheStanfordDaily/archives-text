# The 						Pill: Miracle Drug With Many Problems
## 
### DOUGLAS BARR 
More than 8 ,500,000 women in
America use the pill. But women are
confused and doubtful about its safety
and potential, and doctors are divided
on its medical and psychological
effects.
In the conflict for sexual equality,
people ask whether the pill makes
women more independent or whether it
Ls a chauvinistic device used to exploit
women with little regard for its
side-effects? Instead of women's risking
their health, ask feminists why not risk
men through birth control in males?
The medical community does not
question the pill's near complete
effectiveness. Instead discussion centers
on the risk of blood clotting.

Results of several studies showed
between 4 1 /2 and 10 times as much
risk of blood clotting in women who
use the pill.
Less Risk Than Pregancy
But all studies agree on two
definitive points: taking the pill
involves less risk than pregnancy, and
secondly women who have a history of
blood clotting, apoplexy, serious liver
diseases, breast cancer, estrogen
dependent tumors, or vaginal bleeding
of unknown cause should not take the
pill.
In the face of the mixed evidence
doctors have different views. Dr. James
McClenahan, Director of Cowell
Student Health Center, said, "Although
there are certain women who should

not take the pill, in general the medical
community still feels the pill is a safe
method."
But Dr. Sumner M. Kalman,
professor of pharmacology at the
School of Medicine, comments, "I
think it is OK for a girl who can't use
anything else, but certainly not ideal."
Cancer Risk
It is known that when the hormones
in the pill—estrogen and progestin—are
injected in large doses in some animals,
cancer develops. However, Dr.
McClenahan said, "Apparently there is
no evidence that there is an increased
danger of breast cancer with someone
using the pill." No evidence could be
available since cancer takes ten years to
develop and the pill has been in

widespread use for less f han nine years.
The list of minor medical problems
varies, but resembles the medical
problems of pregnancy: nausea,
nervousness and irritability before
menstruation, headache, fatigue,
pigmentation of skin, changes of weight
and six drive, menstrual flow abnormal,
breakthrough bleeding, spotting,
abnormal absence or supression of
menstrual discharge during and after
treatment, and breast
changes—tenderness, enlargement and
secretion.
Psychological Testing
Professor Rudolf H. Moos, professor
of psychiatry at the Medical School and
researcher at the Veterans
Administration hospital, last year

tested psychological reactions of 420
women using the pill against 298
women not. They were questioned on
their experiences of 47 minor
symptoms. All the women were
similar—about 25 years old, educated
through junior year of college, and
married three years.
Professor Moos said that oral
contraceptives actually contribute to
menstrual stability, and although the
effects are variable, about 80% of
women using the pill have no change in
menstration.
Dr. David Dorosin, chief psychiatrist
at Cowell, said that the psychological
effects of the pill affected only a
minority of users. But I)r. Betty
Hamburg, of the Department of
Psychiatry at the Medical School,
disagrees. "The dangers of the pill have
made (girls) anxious and at
times resistant to the notion of taking
it, and to people—such as their boy
friends—who are pushing them to take
it."

Hellan Dowden, spokesman for
Women's Liberation, said, "Women
have the basic right to control their
bodies. The use of contraceptive
methods like the pill means that
women are liberated from depending
on men to prevent conception. They
are further liberated from unwanted
pregnancies." She claimed that the pill
is the easiest and most effective device,
and should be provided free to all
women.
The pill causes complexities in
viewpoints. Medically, the danger is in
blood clotting. Doctors agree that the
pill contains potentially serious risks,
but they disagree on the strength of the
potential. Used correctly, the pill holds
little danger of cancer, sterility, or
malformed babies.
Dr. Kalman concluded, "The pill is a
first attempt at a useful
pharmacological device. The future will
bring agents that will interfere in a
more subtle wav."
More than 8 ,500,000 women in

available since cancer takes ten years to
develop and the pill has been in

widespread use for less f han nine years.
The list of minor medical problems
varies, but resembles the medical
problems of pregnancy: nausea,
nervousness and irritability before
menstruation, headache, fatigue,
pigmentation of skin, changes of weight
and six drive, menstrual flow abnormal,
breakthrough bleeding, spotting,
abnormal absence or supression of
menstrual discharge during and after
treatment, and breast
changes—tenderness, enlargement and
secretion.
Psychological Testing
Professor Rudolf H. Moos, professor
of psychiatry at the Medical School and
researcher at the Veterans
Administration hospital, last year

tested psychological reactions of 420
women using the pill against 298
women not. They were questioned on
their experiences of 47 minor
symptoms. All the women were
similar—about 25 years old, educated
through junior year of college, and
married three years.
Professor Moos said that oral
contraceptives actually contribute to
menstrual stability, and although the
effects are variable, about 80% of
women using the pill have no change in
menstration.
Dr. David Dorosin, chief psychiatrist
at Cowell, said that the psychological
effects of the pill affected only a
minority of users. But I)r. Betty
Hamburg, of the Department of
Psychiatry at the Medical School,
disagrees. "The dangers of the pill have
made (girls) anxious and at
times resistant to the notion of taking
it, and to people—such as their boy
friends—who are pushing them to take
it."

Hellan Dowden, spokesman for
Women's Liberation, said, "Women
have the basic right to control their
bodies. The use of contraceptive
methods like the pill means that
women are liberated from depending
on men to prevent conception. They
are further liberated from unwanted
pregnancies." She claimed that the pill
is the easiest and most effective device,
and should be provided free to all
women.
The pill causes complexities in
viewpoints. Medically, the danger is in
blood clotting. Doctors agree that the
pill contains potentially serious risks,
but they disagree on the strength of the
potential. Used correctly, the pill holds
little danger of cancer, sterility, or
malformed babies.
Dr. Kalman concluded, "The pill is a
first attempt at a useful
pharmacological device. The future will
bring agents that will interfere in a
more subtle wav."
More than 8 ,500,000 women in
America use the pill. But women are
confused and doubtful about its safety
and potential, and doctors are divided
on its medical and psychological
effects.
In the conflict for sexual equality,
people ask whether the pill makes
women more independent or whether it
Ls a chauvinistic device used to exploit
women with little regard for its
side-effects? Instead of women's risking
their health, ask feminists why not risk
men through birth control in males?
The medical community does not
question the pill's near complete
effectiveness. Instead discussion centers
on the risk of blood clotting.

Results of several studies showed
between 4 1 /2 and 10 times as much
risk of blood clotting in women who
use the pill.
Less Risk Than Pregancy
But all studies agree on two
definitive points: taking the pill
involves less risk than pregnancy, and
secondly women who have a history of
blood clotting, apoplexy, serious liver
diseases, breast cancer, estrogen
dependent tumors, or vaginal bleeding
of unknown cause should not take the
pill.
In the face of the mixed evidence
doctors have different views. Dr. James
McClenahan, Director of Cowell
Student Health Center, said, "Although
there are certain women who should

not take the pill, in general the medical
community still feels the pill is a safe
method."
But Dr. Sumner M. Kalman,
professor of pharmacology at the
School of Medicine, comments, "I
think it is OK for a girl who can't use
anything else, but certainly not ideal."
Cancer Risk
It is known that when the hormones
in the pill—estrogen and progestin—are
injected in large doses in some animals,
cancer develops. However, Dr.
McClenahan said, "Apparently there is
no evidence that there is an increased
danger of breast cancer with someone
using the pill." No evidence could be
available since cancer takes ten years to
develop and the pill has been in

widespread use for less f han nine years.
