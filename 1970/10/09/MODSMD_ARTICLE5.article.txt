## Students Can Turn America Around 
### larry diamond 
We have, to date, been a
glorious failure. The peace
movement now atrophies in a
quiet comer as the people grow
bored and weary of anti-war
protest.
Development of the ABM and
other futile weapons systems
advances with the support of «
cold war sentiment in a Congress
clearly out of touch with the 70's.
A system of military
conscription continues to jail
many of those whose consciences
will not allow them to serve in the
American military.
Destruction of the
environment proceeds at a
thorough and efficient pace as
government, caught in the middle
between industry and the people,
proves unequal to the legislative
challenge of ending population
growth and pollution.
No Togetherness
Reconciliation becomes a
hollow joke as the national

Administration seeks to heighten
the divisions between young and
old, black and white, left and
right, with rhetoric more
venomous than anything the
nation has heard since the days of
Joe Mc Carthy.
Freedom is sacrificed readily
and enthusiastically in t h e shoddy
rush of legislation to satisfy the
paranoia of Uptight America over
social unrest. Government unveils
the trappings of a police state
with ominous threats of more to
come to control the disorder.
City schools continue to
crumble both physically and
spiritually as funds for badly
needed books, buildings, and
educational innovation are denied.
Children continue to go
hungry; families continue to live
in shacks; proud men, skilled men,
continue the humiliating search
for employment in increasing
numbers—all in a nation that still
will not meet the needs of its
citizens.
Rotting America
In plain language, America
continues to rot, and we, its
youth, have been able to do little
to reverse the process. In defect,
we have retreated within our
fantasies and erased the ugliness
of the outside world simply by
ignoring it.
Life is easy at the Farm.
We too have grown weary of
protest that brings no change.
And those of us who have not
grown weary have grown violent
and destructive in our anger.
For most of us, our anger
seems too defrayed to collect
itself in another movement. We
are in a disarray.
And, as the new academic year
begins, we are also at a
cross-roads. Where to?

An obvious path is withdrawal
and surrender. Retreat within the
walls of the ivory tower and
watch the crazies of the right and
left do battle. (A tempting choice:
apathy is so innocent and com
fortable
Of course, we can join the
barricades and hasten a civil war.
Tear down the walls of the
establishment, or more
appropriately, blow them up. No
matter that we may blow up
innocent human beings in the
process. Revolution is inevitably a
deadly business, the crazies say.
It is also a hopeless one today.
The fact that each bomb brings us
closer to an irreversible police
state is recognized by all but the
few fanatics whose desperation
has clouded their vision and
destroyed their judgment.
There is always the path of
non-violent protest—the marches,
the demonstrations, the petitions,
the sit-ins. This path still carried
the potential for drama and
effectiveness in deciding some
issues, but appears most unlikely
to bring the major changes
necessary to reorder America.
Though the latter cannot be
ignored none of these paths offer
any substantial opportunity to
change America and reorient its
directions.
Massive Participation
There is only one path capable
of doing this —massive
participation in the electoral
process. We must learn to wield
and manipulate the only kind of
power that moves the
government: vote power.

The passage of the
McGovern-Hatfield amendment
could have ended the war more
swiftly and surely than any march
or petition ever could. Why did
we lose? We didn't have the vote
power in the Senate.
If we could replace ten hawks
with ten doves in the Senate, we
could end the war completely by
next year. By turning ten George
Murphy's out of the Senate, we
could defeat the ABM, the draft,
and the entire cold-war
philosophy which values military
hardware more than the
fulfillment of human needs.
By turning out 5 0 Charlie
Gubsers (Gubser is the incumbent
Congressman in this district) we
could move ahead with the urgent
task of rebuilding our cities and
our en vi r onment—and of
guaranteeing in the process a job
to every able-bodied man and
woman who could lend their
physical or technical resources to
the task.
By defeating the Charlie
Gubsers and George Murphys
across the nation, by electing men
like Stuart McLean and John
Tunney to assume leadership for
ending the war and its resulting
unemployment and restorjng the
environment, we could turn
America around. We could put a
halt to the incipient Nixon police
state and restore the freedoms we
are constitutionally guaranteed.
Collective Power
Less than a month remains
until election time. We have the
collective power—by ringing
doorbells and raising money—to

see that Stuart McLean and John
Tunney achieve dramatic victories
in this area. And we have the
power, by doing this, to join in a
movement that can change the
complexion of the Congress and
the direction of the country.
In the next month, and in the
coming years, we can remold
America, without jail sentences,
without bloodshed. But it can
only happen if we are willing to
come down off our white horses
and dirty our hands in the
political wars.
The political system is in
desperate need of a massive
infusion of new blood. Tired,
confused, and terribly
disorganized, the Democratic
Party is ripe for seizure by the
students of America. It can be
used as a vehicle to transform
America. It can be made
responsive to the needs of human
beings. And it can defeat Richard
Nixon, now, in a figurative sense;
in two years, in a literal sense.
Phony Purity
The only question that remains
is how ready we are to sacrifice
our phony purity and how deeply
we are willing to become involved
in the grinding work of the
electoral process.
Time is running out, for these
elections and for the nation. We
can make the political system
work, legitimately and peacefully,
if we will but have the daring and
courage to seize control of it.

work, legitimately and peacefully,
if we will but have the daring and

Rotting America
In plain language, America
continues to rot, and we, its
youth, have been able to do little
to reverse the process. In defect,
we have retreated within our
fantasies and erased the ugliness
of the outside world simply by
ignoring it.
Life is easy at the Farm.
We too have grown weary of
protest that brings no change.
And those of us who have not
grown weary have grown violent
and destructive in our anger.
For most of us, our anger
seems too defrayed to collect
itself in another movement. We
are in a disarray.
And, as the new academic year
begins, we are also at a
cross-roads. Where to?

An obvious path is withdrawal
and surrender. Retreat within the
walls of the ivory tower and
watch the crazies of the right and
left do battle. (A tempting choice:
apathy is so innocent and com
fortable
Of course, we can join the
barricades and hasten a civil war.
Tear down the walls of the
establishment, or more
appropriately, blow them up. No
matter that we may blow up
innocent human beings in the
process. Revolution is inevitably a
deadly business, the crazies say.
It is also a hopeless one today.
The fact that each bomb brings us
closer to an irreversible police
state is recognized by all but the
few fanatics whose desperation
has clouded their vision and
destroyed their judgment.
There is always the path of
non-violent protest—the marches,
the demonstrations, the petitions,
the sit-ins. This path still carried
the potential for drama and
effectiveness in deciding some
issues, but appears most unlikely
to bring the major changes
necessary to reorder America.
Though the latter cannot be
ignored none of these paths offer
any substantial opportunity to
change America and reorient its
directions.
Massive Participation
There is only one path capable
of doing this —massive
participation in the electoral
process. We must learn to wield
and manipulate the only kind of
power that moves the
government: vote power.

The passage of the
McGovern-Hatfield amendment
could have ended the war more
swiftly and surely than any march
or petition ever could. Why did
we lose? We didn't have the vote
power in the Senate.
If we could replace ten hawks
with ten doves in the Senate, we
could end the war completely by
next year. By turning ten George
Murphy's out of the Senate, we
could defeat the ABM, the draft,
and the entire cold-war
philosophy which values military
hardware more than the
fulfillment of human needs.
By turning out 5 0 Charlie
Gubsers (Gubser is the incumbent
Congressman in this district) we
could move ahead with the urgent
task of rebuilding our cities and
our en vi r onment—and of
guaranteeing in the process a job
to every able-bodied man and
woman who could lend their
physical or technical resources to
the task.
By defeating the Charlie
Gubsers and George Murphys
across the nation, by electing men
like Stuart McLean and John
Tunney to assume leadership for
ending the war and its resulting
unemployment and restorjng the
environment, we could turn
America around. We could put a
halt to the incipient Nixon police
state and restore the freedoms we
are constitutionally guaranteed.
Collective Power
Less than a month remains
until election time. We have the
collective power—by ringing
doorbells and raising money—to

see that Stuart McLean and John
Tunney achieve dramatic victories
in this area. And we have the
power, by doing this, to join in a
movement that can change the
complexion of the Congress and
the direction of the country.
In the next month, and in the
coming years, we can remold
America, without jail sentences,
without bloodshed. But it can
only happen if we are willing to
come down off our white horses
and dirty our hands in the
political wars.
The political system is in
desperate need of a massive
infusion of new blood. Tired,
confused, and terribly
disorganized, the Democratic
Party is ripe for seizure by the
students of America. It can be
used as a vehicle to transform
America. It can be made
responsive to the needs of human
beings. And it can defeat Richard
Nixon, now, in a figurative sense;
in two years, in a literal sense.
Phony Purity
The only question that remains
is how ready we are to sacrifice
our phony purity and how deeply
we are willing to become involved
in the grinding work of the
electoral process.

elections and for the nation. We
can make the political system

used as a vehicle to transform
America. It can be made

in two years, in a literal sense.
Phony Purity
The only question that remains
is how ready we are to sacrifice
our phony purity and how deeply
we are willing to become involved
in the grinding work of the
electoral process.
Time is running out, for these
elections and for the nation. We
can make the political system
work, legitimately and peacefully,
if we will but have the daring and
courage to seize control of it.
(Larry Diamond is a
sophomore and is active in Stuart
McLean's campaign for Congress).
We have, to date, been a
glorious failure. The peace
movement now atrophies in a
quiet comer as the people grow
bored and weary of anti-war
protest.
Development of the ABM and
other futile weapons systems
advances with the support of «
cold war sentiment in a Congress
clearly out of touch with the 70's.
A system of military
conscription continues to jail
many of those whose consciences
will not allow them to serve in the
American military.
Destruction of the
environment proceeds at a
thorough and efficient pace as
government, caught in the middle

proves unequal to the legislative
challenge of ending population
growth and pollution.
No Togetherness
Reconciliation becomes a
hollow joke as the national

Administration seeks to heighten
the divisions between young and
old, black and white, left and
right, with rhetoric more
venomous than anything the
nation has heard since the days of
Joe Mc Carthy.
Freedom is sacrificed readily
and enthusiastically in t h e shoddy
rush of legislation to satisfy the
paranoia of Uptight America over
social unrest. Government unveils
the trappings of a police state
with ominous threats of more to

City schools continue to
crumble both physically and

Children continue to go
hungry; families continue to live
in shacks; proud men, skilled men,
continue the humiliating search
for employment in increasing
numbers—all in a nation that still
will not meet the needs of its
citizens.
Rotting America
In plain language, America
continues to rot, and we, its
youth, have been able to do little
to reverse the process. In defect,
we have retreated within our
fantasies and erased the ugliness
of the outside world simply by
ignoring it.
Life is easy at the Farm.
We too have grown weary of
protest that brings no change.
And those of us who have not
grown weary have grown violent
and destructive in our anger.
For most of us, our anger
seems too defrayed to collect
itself in another movement. We
are in a disarray.
And, as the new academic year
begins, we are also at a
cross-roads. Where to?

An obvious path is withdrawal
and surrender. Retreat within the
walls of the ivory tower and
watch the crazies of the right and
left do battle. (A tempting choice:
apathy is so innocent and com
fortable
Of course, we can join the
barricades and hasten a civil war.
Tear down the walls of the
establishment, or more
appropriately, blow them up. No
matter that we may blow up
innocent human beings in the
process. Revolution is inevitably a
deadly business, the crazies say.
It is also a hopeless one today.
The fact that each bomb brings us
closer to an irreversible police
state is recognized by all but the
few fanatics whose desperation
has clouded their vision and
destroyed their judgment.
There is always the path of
non-violent protest—the marches,
the demonstrations, the petitions,
the sit-ins. This path still carried
the potential for drama and
effectiveness in deciding some
issues, but appears most unlikely
to bring the major changes
necessary to reorder America.
Though the latter cannot be
ignored none of these paths offer
any substantial opportunity to
change America and reorient its
directions.
Massive Participation
There is only one path capable
of doing this —massive
participation in the electoral
process. We must learn to wield
and manipulate the only kind of
power that moves the
government: vote power.

The passage of the
McGovern-Hatfield amendment
could have ended the war more
swiftly and surely than any march
or petition ever could. Why did
we lose? We didn't have the vote
power in the Senate.
If we could replace ten hawks
with ten doves in the Senate, we
could end the war completely by
next year. By turning ten George
Murphy's out of the Senate, we
could defeat the ABM, the draft,
and the entire cold-war
philosophy which values military
hardware more than the
fulfillment of human needs.
By turning out 5 0 Charlie
Gubsers (Gubser is the incumbent
Congressman in this district) we
could move ahead with the urgent
task of rebuilding our cities and
our en vi r onment—and of
guaranteeing in the process a job
to every able-bodied man and
woman who could lend their
physical or technical resources to
the task.
By defeating the Charlie
Gubsers and George Murphys
across the nation, by electing men
like Stuart McLean and John
Tunney to assume leadership for
ending the war and its resulting
unemployment and restorjng the
environment, we could turn
America around. We could put a
halt to the incipient Nixon police
state and restore the freedoms we
are constitutionally guaranteed.
Collective Power
Less than a month remains
until election time. We have the
collective power—by ringing
doorbells and raising money—to

see that Stuart McLean and John
Tunney achieve dramatic victories
in this area. And we have the
power, by doing this, to join in a
movement that can change the
complexion of the Congress and
the direction of the country.
In the next month, and in the
coming years, we can remold
America, without jail sentences,
without bloodshed. But it can
only happen if we are willing to
come down off our white horses
and dirty our hands in the
political wars.
The political system is in
desperate need of a massive
infusion of new blood. Tired,
confused, and terribly
disorganized, the Democratic
Party is ripe for seizure by the
students of America. It can be
used as a vehicle to transform
America. It can be made
responsive to the needs of human
beings. And it can defeat Richard

America, without jail sentences,
without bloodshed. But it can
only happen if we are willing to
come down off our white horses
and dirty our hands in the
political wars.
The political system is in
desperate need of a massive
infusion of new blood. Tired,
confused, and terribly
disorganized, the Democratic
Party is ripe for seizure by the
students of America. It can be
used as a vehicle to transform
America. It can be made
responsive to the needs of human
beings. And it can defeat Richard
Nixon, now, in a figurative sense;
in two years, in a literal sense.
Phony Purity
The only question that remains
is how ready we are to sacrifice
our phony purity and how deeply
we are willing to become involved
in the grinding work of the
electoral process.
Time is running out, for these
elections and for the nation. We
can make the political system
work, legitimately and peacefully,
if we will but have the daring and
courage to seize control of it.
