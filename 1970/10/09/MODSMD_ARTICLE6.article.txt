## Snitches And Censorship 
### bennion gilbert 
There is a prevalent feeling of caution among
liberals in America today; there is a fear that we
are entering a period of repression like that which
we experienced in the early fifties. But caution
should not be allowed to cause us to stop thinking,
for fear to stop others from speaking.
Here at Stanford we have an excellent example
of the result of the "caution." Supposedly liberal
faculty members and editors of the Daily have
taken the position that the answpr to a divergence
of viewpoints is censorship.
Men who could understand the betrayal of their
people by Quisling and Diem and the Greek junta
and could accept a violent response to that
betrayal cannot accept such a response here. The
institutionalized violence and betrayals of the
governments of occupied Norway, Vietnam, and
Greece is not considered to be legitimate by such
men, and the response of the armed people to
those government actions is applauded. There was
no liberal outcry at the death of Diem or Quisling,
nor would there be at the violent overthrow of the
Greek junta, but these same liberals who condone
violence abroad, tacitly assume that a similar
condition could not arise here and refuse to allow
any discussion of the matter. It seems clear that
the basis for the opposition to D. McGuire's article
was a visceral rather than an intellectual one.
The authors of this article do not claim that all
those opposed to violence are wrong. The men we
disagree with, however, are not opposed to
violence per se, but purport to choose which forms
of violence are legitimate and which are not.
Monopoly Violence
The fundamental basis of every state is its
attempt to monopolize violence, that monopoly
being called "law and order." The state considers
destruction of property as violence, and the
corporate rape of the environment as progress. The
Black Panthers are labeled violent, yet the
oppression of the slumlords, racist schools, and the
psychological destruction of millions of blacks is
euphemistically termed welfare policy.
When these conditions exist outside our own
country, liberals recognize them as violence and
deplore them, and can understand and support the
historical justice of the oppressed people's violent
response to the states' legitimized violence.
The liberals' response to D.'s article would have
us believe that there is no parallel between the
oppression in occupied Norway, Vietnam, and
Greece and oppression in the U.S. They would
probably have applauded D.'s article if it were

published in Athens, but here they not only
disagree with D., but also attempt to suppress the
dissemination of his article.
The Legal Objections
It should be mentioned in passing that the legal
basis for the objections to D.'s article and the
Daily's decision to cease printing such works in the
future are as fraudulent as substantive
disagreement with D. is lacking. In areas touching
upon freedom of expression, and especially
freedom of the press, the Supreme Court has
always allowed such freedoms "breathing room."
The Court has long struggled with drawing the line
which delimits protected expression and it seems
highly unlikely that the editors of the Daily can be
more successful in this, their first attempt.
While the Court has not always been our most
enlightened institution, it has never been so naive
as to act as the editors did on Thursday. Perhaps
this is because the Court could not so easily avoid
contact with fanatical legislators and the
machinery of oppression as can an editor of the
Stanford Daily. Perhaps it is because the Justices
have read the First Amendment to the
Constitution, which was written to preserve the
kind of dialogue censored here.
In a recent case, the Court reversed the
conviction of a black man for threatening the life
of the president. The Court said that "we must
interpret the language of Congress chose
(prohibiting threats against the president) 'against
the back-ground of a profound national
commitment to the principle that debate on public
issues should be uninhibited, robust, and
wide-open,and that it may well include vehement,
caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp
attacks..The language of the political
arena ... is often vituperative, abusive, and
inexact." The Court held that the defendant's
statement that he wanted to get L.B.J, "in his
sights" was merely political hyperbole and could
not, consistent with the First Amendment, be
punished. Watts v. United States, 394 U. 5705
(1969 ).
It is the authors' contention that D. is right,
that there are snitches and oppression in America,
and that the role of snitches must be exposed and
debated. Those who disagree must critically
respond to D.'s position and not dismiss it out of
hand as irresponsible journalism.

There is a prevalent feeling of caution among
liberals in America today; there is a fear that we
are entering a period of repression like that which
we experienced in the early fifties. But caution
should not be allowed to cause us to stop thinking,
for fear to stop others from speaking.
Here at Stanford we have an excellent example
of the result of the "caution." Supposedly liberal
faculty members and editors of the Daily have
taken the position that the answpr to a divergence
of viewpoints is censorship.
Men who could understand the betrayal of their
people by Quisling and Diem and the Greek junta
and could accept a violent response to that
betrayal cannot accept such a response here. The
institutionalized violence and betrayals of the
governments of occupied Norway, Vietnam, and
Greece is not considered to be legitimate by such
men, and the response of the armed people to
those government actions is applauded. There was
no liberal outcry at the death of Diem or Quisling,
nor would there be at the violent overthrow of the
Greek junta, but these same liberals who condone
violence abroad, tacitly assume that a similar
condition could not arise here and refuse to allow
any discussion of the matter. It seems clear that
the basis for the opposition to D. McGuire's article
was a visceral rather than an intellectual one.
The authors of this article do not claim that all
those opposed to violence are wrong. The men we
disagree with, however, are not opposed to
violence per se, but purport to choose which forms
of violence are legitimate and which are not.
Monopoly Violence
The fundamental basis of every state is its
attempt to monopolize violence, that monopoly
being called "law and order." The state considers
destruction of property as violence, and the
corporate rape of the environment as progress. The
Black Panthers are labeled violent, yet the
oppression of the slumlords, racist schools, and the
psychological destruction of millions of blacks is
euphemistically termed welfare policy.
When these conditions exist outside our own
country, liberals recognize them as violence and
deplore them, and can understand and support the
historical justice of the oppressed people's violent
response to the states' legitimized violence.
The liberals' response to D.'s article would have
us believe that there is no parallel between the
oppression in occupied Norway, Vietnam, and
Greece and oppression in the U.S. They would
probably have applauded D.'s article if it were

published in Athens, but here they not only
disagree with D., but also attempt to suppress the
dissemination of his article.
The Legal Objections
It should be mentioned in passing that the legal
basis for the objections to D.'s article and the
Daily's decision to cease printing such works in the
future are as fraudulent as substantive
disagreement with D. is lacking. In areas touching
upon freedom of expression, and especially
freedom of the press, the Supreme Court has
always allowed such freedoms "breathing room."
The Court has long struggled with drawing the line
which delimits protected expression and it seems
highly unlikely that the editors of the Daily can be
more successful in this, their first attempt.
While the Court has not always been our most
enlightened institution, it has never been so naive
as to act as the editors did on Thursday. Perhaps
this is because the Court could not so easily avoid
contact with fanatical legislators and the
machinery of oppression as can an editor of the
Stanford Daily. Perhaps it is because the Justices
have read the First Amendment to the
Constitution, which was written to preserve the
kind of dialogue censored here.
In a recent case, the Court reversed the
conviction of a black man for threatening the life
of the president. The Court said that "we must
interpret the language of Congress chose
(prohibiting threats against the president) 'against
the back-ground of a profound national
commitment to the principle that debate on public
issues should be uninhibited, robust, and
wide-open,and that it may well include vehement,
caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp
attacks..The language of the political
arena ... is often vituperative, abusive, and
inexact." The Court held that the defendant's
statement that he wanted to get L.B.J, "in his
sights" was merely political hyperbole and could
not, consistent with the First Amendment, be
punished. Watts v. United States, 394 U. 5705

There is a prevalent feeling of caution among
liberals in America today; there is a fear that we
are entering a period of repression like that which
we experienced in the early fifties. But caution
should not be allowed to cause us to stop thinking,
for fear to stop others from speaking.
Here at Stanford we have an excellent example
of the result of the "caution." Supposedly liberal
faculty members and editors of the Daily have
taken the position that the answpr to a divergence
of viewpoints is censorship.
Men who could understand the betrayal of their
people by Quisling and Diem and the Greek junta
and could accept a violent response to that
betrayal cannot accept such a response here. The
institutionalized violence and betrayals of the
governments of occupied Norway, Vietnam, and
Greece is not considered to be legitimate by such
men, and the response of the armed people to
those government actions is applauded. There was
no liberal outcry at the death of Diem or Quisling,
nor would there be at the violent overthrow of the
Greek junta, but these same liberals who condone
violence abroad, tacitly assume that a similar
condition could not arise here and refuse to allow
any discussion of the matter. It seems clear that
the basis for the opposition to D. McGuire's article
was a visceral rather than an intellectual one.
The authors of this article do not claim that all
those opposed to violence are wrong. The men we
disagree with, however, are not opposed to
violence per se, but purport to choose which forms
of violence are legitimate and which are not.
Monopoly Violence
The fundamental basis of every state is its
attempt to monopolize violence, that monopoly
being called "law and order." The state considers
destruction of property as violence, and the
corporate rape of the environment as progress. The
Black Panthers are labeled violent, yet the
oppression of the slumlords, racist schools, and the
psychological destruction of millions of blacks is
euphemistically termed welfare policy.
When these conditions exist outside our own
country, liberals recognize them as violence and
deplore them, and can understand and support the
historical justice of the oppressed people's violent
response to the states' legitimized violence.
The liberals' response to D.'s article would have
us believe that there is no parallel between the
oppression in occupied Norway, Vietnam, and
Greece and oppression in the U.S. They would
probably have applauded D.'s article if it were

published in Athens, but here they not only
disagree with D., but also attempt to suppress the
dissemination of his article.
The Legal Objections
It should be mentioned in passing that the legal
basis for the objections to D.'s article and the
Daily's decision to cease printing such works in the
future are as fraudulent as substantive
disagreement with D. is lacking. In areas touching
upon freedom of expression, and especially
freedom of the press, the Supreme Court has
always allowed such freedoms "breathing room."
The Court has long struggled with drawing the line
which delimits protected expression and it seems
highly unlikely that the editors of the Daily can be
more successful in this, their first attempt.
While the Court has not always been our most
enlightened institution, it has never been so naive
as to act as the editors did on Thursday. Perhaps
this is because the Court could not so easily avoid
contact with fanatical legislators and the
machinery of oppression as can an editor of the
Stanford Daily. Perhaps it is because the Justices
have read the First Amendment to the
Constitution, which was written to preserve the
kind of dialogue censored here.
In a recent case, the Court reversed the
conviction of a black man for threatening the life
of the president. The Court said that "we must
interpret the language of Congress chose
(prohibiting threats against the president) 'against
the back-ground of a profound national
commitment to the principle that debate on public
issues should be uninhibited, robust, and
wide-open,and that it may well include vehement,
caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp
attacks..The language of the political
arena ... is often vituperative, abusive, and
inexact." The Court held that the defendant's
statement that he wanted to get L.B.J, "in his

not, consistent with the First Amendment, be
punished. Watts v. United States, 394 U. 5705
