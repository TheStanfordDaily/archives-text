Editor, THE DAILY:
The lead editorial in
Thursday's Daily was excellent. It
answers nearly all of my concerns;
I hope it is equally satisfying to
the other signers of the
advertisement that appeared in
the same issue.
My pleasure at the position
you took makes it quite
unnecessary to deal with the
criticisms you later leveled at the
text of our ad. I think 1 can cover
most of the areas of apparent
difference by saying that our
purpose in placing the ad was an
entirely straightforward one,
namely, to express to the Daily's
editors what we felt to be* a
widely shared community
standard. We made no attempt to
dictate to the Daily, nor would
we approve if others did so. The
fact that our main objection has
been met persuades me, at least,
that the matter should be closed.

The appearance of a
supplementary list of names in
today's Daily simply reflects the
fact that the deadline was
Wednesday, and should not be
interpreted as an attempt to keep
things alive.

Kditor, THE DAILY:
Your October 5 article on
housing plans by Dave Spector
and Paul Grushkin quotes Don
Lee assaying "David Packard who
is a Stanford trustee and president
of Hewlett Packard, has $30 0
million in trust, drawing $15
million in interest. People are
profiting without social
responsibility." This is another
example of people "shooting off
their mouths without social
responsibility."
If Mr. Lee or the authors of

this article will check the facts,
they will find that (1 ) Mr. Packard
is not and has never been
president of Hewlett-Packard Co.
Mr. Packard resigned his position
as Chairman of the Board and
chief executive officer of
Hewlett-Packard to accept his
present position with the
Department of Defense at a
fraction of his Hewlett-Packard
salary. (2) Mr. Packard is not a
Stanford trustee and hasn't been
for several years. (3) He does not
have $300 million in trust but has
several million shares of stock
which al current prices is worth
nearer to $200 million. (4) He is
not drawing $15 million in
interest, but only whatever
dividends are paid on this stock,
which is approximately 10
percent of the income suggested
by Mr. Lee. This income has been
preassigned to 15 charitable and
edu rational organizations,
including Stanford.
