Once again, the campuses are
soon to be saturated with
literature bearing the smiling faces

of the politically ambitious who
so anxiously solicit the support of
the University students. Since
1960, those faces have been of
men; young, smiling, confident
with a row of gleaming white
teeth and an unbuttoned collar.
They are the purporters of
"change" and "progress," of

"communicating" and "uniting."
They ascribe to themselves the
lofty virtues of courage and
honesty as they go forth to fight
the incarnation of that which is
Evil and Corrupt. They are
knights in the twentieth century
on white horses who hold high the
banner of that which is Good.
All they seek is our vote.
Today's political aspirant is no
different, however, from his
predecessor from Tammany Hall.
Beneath the gleaming armor of
supposed Truth and Beauty is a
mind which feels itself capable of
prescribing action for others
through law. The slogans may be
appealing, his looks sexy to the
frustrated housewife, his
handshake firm to the students —
he remains, however, a creature of
politics.
Politics, that game and sport
which preaches that change comes
through prescribed regulated
channels, and that no matter how
severe the repression or horrible
the situation, it may be changed
only through voting.
Temples Of The State
Politics, the prostitute of that
which is principled for the sake of
expediency, to win the vote, to
defeat the opponent, to wheel and
deal in secluded temples of the
State.
Politics, the beast which feeds
us the milk that compromise is
necessary, that certain evil
institutions are a prior and
inseparable part of the Universe
such as war, facism and
exploitation.
Who is the political white
knight?
Not A Conservative
Rarely is he a conservative; the
conservative, though misguided
and obsolete, is at least honest

and sincere. No, those who ride
the political bandwagon are often
those who speak loudly and say
little - the most odious product of
the channeling process, the
ultimate among the reformists and
sell-outs, in short, the L iU eral.
First and foremost, the liberal
is a co-opter - he exploits issues he
neither raised nor was concerned
with prior to an election or
political campaign. He speaks from
his unbuttoned collar of a desire
to relate to youth; where was he
during the strikes, the
moratoriums or the countless
other actions wh°n and where he
could have done so? He speaks of
principle, while still upholding a
democratic system which
presumes that right and wrong are
questions of how many vote for
what, not an issue of morality and
conscience.
He speaks of "problems" while
failing to realize that those
"problems" are merely
symptoms of a deeply rooted
disease permeating the body
politic of which he is so smiling a
part. Finally, he preaches
"change," not defining what he
wants to change to, and ignoring
the fact that real change does not
come through stuffing a piece of
paper in a ballot box, but through
an alteration in attitudes coupled
with a moral commitment to
action.
Cheat And A Liar
We know he is a cheat and a
liar who will ultimately sell out to
that which he claims to despise;
we prefer our white knight over
his opponent only because we
believe the former to be less of a
cheat and a liar than is the latter.
We know he is deceptive; he is
found most of the time in press
clubs and cocktail parties with
other political hacks, rather than

on the picket line or out
leaf letting. We know he i£
authoritarian; his beaming
chuckling face occupies more time
and space than his catch-all
slogans and meaningless phrat/s
which were devised to "appeal"
rather than to educate.
We know that in his own way
he seeks a degree of control ovo
our lives, for he wishes to become
part of an institution which even
Abraham Lincoln admitted was
neither based on truth nor justice,
but on plain force — the
institution of government.
On His Way
His victory will send him on his
way, briefcase in hand, where, at
his oaken desk and carpeted
office, he may decide the fate of
his fellow man. Here, he may
manipulate and maneuver his way
up the power ladder, even more
confident that HIS way is right,
and others shall obey "for their
own good."
His defeat will send him
whining and howling into
temporary seclusion where he will
attempt to devise trickier slogans
and a host of new gimmicks until
the golden moment when he can
once again announce himself as
Savior.
In either case, we will never see
him again, save those few
moments when he must explain
himself to those who he must
perpetually trick and fool.
He is a hero for the mediocre
and friendless; a giant for the
timid; a tool for the financially
powerful. Is he, however, any
worse than those who work for
him, those who vote for him? He,
at least, possesses sufficient
foresight to manage to seize
power.
We are stupid enough to allow
him to do so.
