# Campus Workers List Labor Grievances
## 
### PHIL LIND 
Despite advances in the last two years University workers
feel that they have been ignored by the Stanford community.
They feel that there are still unsolved grievances in the areas
of wages, housing and health benefits.
"One thing I have against Stanford," one food service
employee explained, "is that they waited so long to raise the
wages. It wasn't until a lot of people started complaining and
there was talk of a union that we got increases. My work load
was doubled or tripled along with the increase, too."
Wages Increased
In the fall of 1969, for most departments, wages were
increased to a starting salary of $400 a month. But this still
remains below union scale.
In the maintenance department, some workers are
concerned about their wages too. "Wages for a small machine
operator at Stanford are about $60 a month less than
unskilled labor off campus," said a worker operating a
lawnmower.
According to workers, the University does not provide an
adequate medical plan. A worker can buy insurance from an
outside agency, such as Blue Cross, at a reduced rate but
many workers feel that their families should be included in

the University plan. The workers are not provided with any
dental plan.
Twenty Dollars Extra
A gardener said, "I have medical insurance because I work
for Stanford but I have to pay $20 a month extra for my
family. I have no dental protection at all and, for me and
some of my friends, dental bills are worse than doctor bills. I
know that workers in other places have good dental
protection."
There is also a housing crisis for workers at Stanford. A
Chicano gardener said that he has to commute from San Jose,
a 30-mile round trip. Most of the men he works with must do
the same, and a few live even further away.
Another gardener, also a Chicano, explained, "I have to get
up at 6 :00 a.m. to get to work in the morning and I don't get
home until usually 7 :00 p.m. I don't have very much time to
spend with my family."
Housing Plan
There is a housing plan for unmarried food service
employees according to one worker. For $36 a month and 8 0
cents a meal he lives in a one room apartment on campus.
He said, however, "The wages of a married worker are the
same as mine, pretty low, and they must live off campus. I

know of several married workers who live 20 miles away from
Stanford."
A great many employees, especially in food service and
maintenance, are minority group people, some of whom are
immigrants and do not as yet have citizenship. According to
almost all of the interviewed workers, these people feel
greatly intimidated and are reluctant to involve themselves
with a union or even speak out about their grievances.
Afraid of Speaking
Another Chicano gardener explained, "Many of the friends
I work with do not speak English very well if at all. They feel
very nervous about voicing themselves to white people that
don't speak Spanish because they either feel that they are
being laughed at or that they won't be understood."
A food service cook felt that his friends were too
dependent upon a steady job to support a union drive or to
complain about conditions.
Some workers were not receptive to an interview. A clerk
in the Main Library reflected on this point; "It's too bad but
they are afraid for their jobs."
Workers also expressed a desire for union representation.
"A union would increase our wages, provide us with a dental
plan and an adequate medical plan, relieve some of the
tension among workers, and provide a more secure
atmosphere," said a cook on the Row.

However, among clerical workers at Encina and the
libraries there is a great deal of concern as to who is going to
be the representative body. Stanford Employees Association
(SEA) has made it clear that it will exclude clerical workers
from the bargaining unit.
A woman clerical worker in the Main Library explained. "I
don't see any logical reason to keep us out of the union. It
just doesn't make sense."
USE Widely Supported
In the Main Library, United Stanford Employees (USE) is
the most widely supported group among clerks because USE
recognizes a need for them to be included in a union program.
However, intimidation exists here too, "We're among the
lowest paid workers at Stanford and very expendable. Many
women are afraid to stand behind USE and Fight SEA," said
another clerk.
Workers at the physical plant are generally in favor of
Teamster recognition though at this time it appears to them
that it is not likely. Most interviewed workers feel that a
union is needed at Stanford. They feel that it may be difficult
to achieve at this point because of workers' fears. It is not
clear as to which group is most widely supported except
among the clerical workers. But the hope is there and as a
food service cook said, "If we had a union, I'd be one of the
first to join."

immigrants and do not as yet have citizenship. According to
almost all of the interviewed workers, these people feel
greatly intimidated and are reluctant to involve themselves
with a union or even speak out about their grievances.
Afraid of Speaking
Another Chicano gardener explained, "Many of the friends
I work with do not speak English very well if at all. They feel
very nervous about voicing themselves to white people that
don't speak Spanish because they either feel that they are
being laughed at or that they won't be understood."
A food service cook felt that his friends were too
dependent upon a steady job to support a union drive or to
complain about conditions.
Some workers were not receptive to an interview. A clerk
in the Main Library reflected on this point; "It's too bad but
they are afraid for their jobs."
Workers also expressed a desire for union representation.
"A union would increase our wages, provide us with a dental
plan and an adequate medical plan, relieve some of the
tension among workers, and provide a more secure
atmosphere," said a cook on the Row.

However, among clerical workers at Encina and the
libraries there is a great deal of concern as to who is going to
be the representative body. Stanford Employees Association
(SEA) has made it clear that it will exclude clerical workers
from the bargaining unit.
A woman clerical worker in the Main Library explained. "I
don't see any logical reason to keep us out of the union. It
just doesn't make sense."
USE Widely Supported
In the Main Library, United Stanford Employees (USE) is
the most widely supported group among clerks because USE
recognizes a need for them to be included in a union program.
However, intimidation exists here too, "We're among the
lowest paid workers at Stanford and very expendable. Many
women are afraid to stand behind USE and Fight SEA," said
another clerk.
Workers at the physical plant are generally in favor of
Teamster recognition though at this time it appears to them
that it is not likely. Most interviewed workers feel that a
union is needed at Stanford. They feel that it may be difficult
to achieve at this point because of workers' fears. It is not
clear as to which group is most widely supported except
among the clerical workers. But the hope is there and as a
food service cook said, "If we had a union, I'd be one of the
first to join."

over Southern Cal; a little premature perhaps, but nonetheless correct.
Despite advances in the last two years University workers
feel that they have been ignored by the Stanford community.
They feel that there are still unsolved grievances in the areas
of wages, housing and health benefits.
"One thing I have against Stanford," one food service
employee explained, "is that they waited so long to raise the
wages. It wasn't until a lot of people started complaining and
there was talk of a union that we got increases. My work load
was doubled or tripled along with the increase, too."
Wages Increased
In the fall of 1969, for most departments, wages were
increased to a starting salary of $400 a month. But this still
remains below union scale.
In the maintenance department, some workers are
concerned about their wages too. "Wages for a small machine
operator at Stanford are about $60 a month less than
unskilled labor off campus," said a worker operating a
lawnmower.
According to workers, the University does not provide an
adequate medical plan. A worker can buy insurance from an
outside agency, such as Blue Cross, at a reduced rate but
many workers feel that their families should be included in

the University plan. The workers are not provided with any
dental plan.
Twenty Dollars Extra
A gardener said, "I have medical insurance because I work
for Stanford but I have to pay $20 a month extra for my
family. I have no dental protection at all and, for me and
some of my friends, dental bills are worse than doctor bills. I
know that workers in other places have good dental
protection."
There is also a housing crisis for workers at Stanford. A
Chicano gardener said that he has to commute from San Jose,
a 30-mile round trip. Most of the men he works with must do
the same, and a few live even further away.
Another gardener, also a Chicano, explained, "I have to get
up at 6 :00 a.m. to get to work in the morning and I don't get
home until usually 7 :00 p.m. I don't have very much time to
spend with my family."
Housing Plan
There is a housing plan for unmarried food service
employees according to one worker. For $36 a month and 8 0
cents a meal he lives in a one room apartment on campus.
He said, however, "The wages of a married worker are the
same as mine, pretty low, and they must live off campus. I

know of several married workers who live 20 miles away from
Stanford."

feel that they have been ignored by the Stanford community.
They feel that there are still unsolved grievances in the areas
of wages, housing and health benefits.
"One thing I have against Stanford," one food service
employee explained, "is that they waited so long to raise the
wages. It wasn't until a lot of people started complaining and
there was talk of a union that we got increases. My work load
was doubled or tripled along with the increase, too."
Wages Increased
In the fall of 1969, for most departments, wages were
increased to a starting salary of $400 a month. But this still
remains below union scale.
In the maintenance department, some workers are
concerned about their wages too. "Wages for a small machine
operator at Stanford are about $60 a month less than
unskilled labor off campus," said a worker operating a
lawnmower.
According to workers, the University does not provide an
adequate medical plan. A worker can buy insurance from an
outside agency, such as Blue Cross, at a reduced rate but
many workers feel that their families should be included in

the University plan. The workers are not provided with any
dental plan.
Twenty Dollars Extra
A gardener said, "I have medical insurance because I work
for Stanford but I have to pay $20 a month extra for my
family. I have no dental protection at all and, for me and
some of my friends, dental bills are worse than doctor bills. I
know that workers in other places have good dental
protection."
There is also a housing crisis for workers at Stanford. A
Chicano gardener said that he has to commute from San Jose,
a 30-mile round trip. Most of the men he works with must do
the same, and a few live even further away.
Another gardener, also a Chicano, explained, "I have to get
up at 6 :00 a.m. to get to work in the morning and I don't get
home until usually 7 :00 p.m. I don't have very much time to
spend with my family."
Housing Plan
There is a housing plan for unmarried food service
employees according to one worker. For $36 a month and 8 0
cents a meal he lives in a one room apartment on campus.
He said, however, "The wages of a married worker are the
same as mine, pretty low, and they must live off campus. I

know of several married workers who live 20 miles away from
Stanford."
A great many employees, especially in food service and
maintenance, are minority group people, some of whom are
immigrants and do not as yet have citizenship. According to
almost all of the interviewed workers, these people feel
greatly intimidated and are reluctant to involve themselves
with a union or even speak out about their grievances.
Afraid of Speaking
Another Chicano gardener explained, "Many of the friends
I work with do not speak English very well if at all. They feel
very nervous about voicing themselves to white people that
don't speak Spanish because they either feel that they are
being laughed at or that they won't be understood."
A food service cook felt that his friends were too
dependent upon a steady job to support a union drive or to
complain about conditions.
Some workers were not receptive to an interview. A clerk
in the Main Library reflected on this point; "It's too bad but
they are afraid for their jobs."
Workers also expressed a desire for union representation.
"A union would increase our wages, provide us with a dental
plan and an adequate medical plan, relieve some of the
tension among workers, and provide a more secure
atmosphere," said a cook on the Row.

However, among clerical workers at Encina and the
libraries there is a great deal of concern as to who is going to
be the representative body. Stanford Employees Association
(SEA) has made it clear that it will exclude clerical workers
from the bargaining unit.
A woman clerical worker in the Main Library explained. "I
don't see any logical reason to keep us out of the union. It
just doesn't make sense."
USE Widely Supported
In the Main Library, United Stanford Employees (USE) is
the most widely supported group among clerks because USE
recognizes a need for them to be included in a union program.
However, intimidation exists here too, "We're among the
lowest paid workers at Stanford and very expendable. Many
women are afraid to stand behind USE and Fight SEA," said
another clerk.
Workers at the physical plant are generally in favor of
Teamster recognition though at this time it appears to them
that it is not likely. Most interviewed workers feel that a
union is needed at Stanford. They feel that it may be difficult
to achieve at this point because of workers' fears. It is not
clear as to which group is most widely supported except
among the clerical workers. But the hope is there and as a
food service cook said, "If we had a union, I'd be one of the
first to join."
