# Wolpman Attacks Anti-commune Law

Radical lawyer Jim Wolpman
Thursday night branded the Palo
Alto anti-commune law an
attempt by conservative
businessmen to rid Palo Alto of
"hippies" and radical activists.
Speaking on KZSU, the
defense lawyer for many students
arrested during last spring's Off
ROTC Movement demonstrations
described the present legal efforts
to prevent the eviction of
commune dwellers as an "attempt
to head Palo Alto off at the pass"
at least in a legal sense.
Wolpman attacked the
rationale of the zoning laws which
limit the use of large Palo Alto
residences to a single family or use
by not more than four unrelated
individuals living together as a
family unit. He challenged the
distinction between five related

and five unrelated persons as well
as the houses' ability to house
more than five persons.
The laws constitute a violation
of various civil rights acts, he
claimed. To date, however, no
eviction notices have been served
on communes.
Wolpman also explained why
he presently is involved in a suit
to curtail the activities of the
alleged "Red Squad" of the Palo
Alto Police Dept.
He described the squad as a
group of Palo Alto detectives who
began two years ago to
photograph protestors and to
keep dossiere on them.
Wolpman deplored the practice
of keeping dossiers on political
activists. He termed the step
frightening, intimidating and a
threat to their freedom of speech.
Wolpman described his own
radical law commune as an
attempt to keep legal counsel "at
the same level as our clients."
"We're trying to change the
way the law is practiced a little
bit," he said.
"We do expouse some kind of
political positions," he stated. But
he said that he wanted to keep it
"open ended. I don't want to
commit myself to any line at this
time."
"We're outside the system and
that puts us with the radicals," he
summarized.
