Rumor central reports two
interpretations of Saturday's
bomb threats. The first holds that
Lyman wanted to make sure
alumni would recall fondly his
stern remarks if the football team
lost and send in some bread
anyway. If the team won, well,
the grads would write even bigger
checks.
Said one of the 80,000
observers, "I figure that the
speech was worth about $1 0 0,0 0 0
and the victory another
$5 00,000."
The second rumor is less
sophisicated but just as plausible.
Santa Clara deputies couldn't get
enough of their brother cops in so
they arranged the threat, and thus
guaranteed that more officers
could get to watch the game.
