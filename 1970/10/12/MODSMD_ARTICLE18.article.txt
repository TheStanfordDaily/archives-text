# Pictures of a Gone Weekend
## 
### 
"When it was all over ... I just
had to go to the bathroom and
cry."
It was that perfect. In fact, it
was too damn perfect. Stanford so
convincingly demolished SC that
you couldn't even get too carried
away. There weren't even any
heart attacks to count. It ended
with a sigh of relief.
We won! We had every break in
the book--and breaks that weren't
even in the book. We had Jim
Plunkett and the Rabbit, Ron
Kadziel and Jeff Siemon and a
fiery defense, but somehow it
wasn't the typical Stanford-USC
cliffhanger. When Bob Moore
caught the deflected pass, you
knew that God, or Lady Luck, or

possibly even the All-Father Odin
was on our side, but it was too
subtly indicated.
Too Damn Good
As a matter of fact, the whole
weekend was just too damn good
to be true.
The song says"you can't always
get what you want," but
somehow, for some
incomprehensible reason, Sly
came and vanished without a
riot .. . taking you higher and
higher into the night. By 10:00
the next morning the lines snaked
from the stadium back to Roscoe
Maples, and when the gates finally
opened the Indian onslaught
commenced and it didn't stop

until Steve Horowitz pounded
that last nail in the belly of the
Trojan Horse.
The smiling Santa Clara
deputies at the gates couldn't tear
the tickets in half and give them
back fast enough. The eager
crowd, high on Sly and Red
Mountain, its appetite for Trojan
blood whetted with Coors' Rocky
Mountain Spring Water and fired
up with innumerable J's, poured
through the floodgates at the
south end, and whistled down the
ramp. They swarmed into the
card-studded eastern stands like so
many lemmings, staking out
territory for friends and frats, and
unpacking smuggled solid and
liquid fuel.
And when it was over, the very
instant Horowitz knew that this
year his field goal would count,
the silence was incredibly
defening. And for Steve, it seemed
like a beautiful, personal
"Fuck-U, SC!"
In the Bag
There wasn't even the
traditional countdown as the
Phillips 66 clock ticked away the
final seconds of Jim Plunkett's
sweet revenge. There were nearly
three minutes to savor absolute,
in-the-bag victory—not celebration
or total anguish determined in
running seconds.
Just utter stoned silence as the
awesome realization swelled up
from the field and stands with the
fragrance of newly blossomed
roses. And then students began
happily wondering how to tell
parents and relatives, "Well, I'll
only be home for a week. Got to
get back to Pasadena."

For a while, there were some
doubts.
Would it come off? Sly? The
Game? Friday night was all
apprehension. It looked like it
could have been the greatest
weekend in history. It also could
have been the worst. 2000 people
waiting outside Frost as Carp
floundered through their set.
Then the dam burst and the
amphitheatre filled to the brim.
Stand
Leo. Squeezing
together . . . waiting. Sly. Wanting
people to do their thing, not sit
back and watch him to his.
"Stand" ... A bunch of college
students went down because they
stood. If that don't give you a
reason to stand, Nothin' can."
Stand! Higher . . . reach out! Bob
Moore did, as 90,0 00 stood and
he went over and pandemonium
broke as we realized that we could
do it after all.
Then the power went out, but
the faint throbbings of "Sex
Machine" eminated from the
Stage. Sly handled it like a pro.
Jimmy Jones got dumped for
thirty yards and he couldn't
handle it. Jeff Siemon growled
"Vidi, Vici, Veni," and the Trojan
protection popped open to let
him through.
For the first Saturday night
ever, the Stanford campus came
alive. The music, the cars loaded
with polluted compatriots
bombing from party to party, not
realizing until they went home to
crash how drunk and stoned they
really were. A truly rosy glow.
And the first success in the
history of abortive Wilbur
bashes . . . frosh smoking dope in
the courtyard after smoking all
afternoon in the stands.
There was no bomb. All the
local rads are also heavy football
fans. Was it all a ruse by the
Sheriff to get as many of his men
in to see the game as he could?

And when the Trojan band
goose-stepped off the field to the
echoes of a thunderous
"Sieg-Heil" from the Stanford
cards, the'Tncomparables" played
their gig, once and for all time
proving the superiority of the
Woodstock Nation over the forces
of Fascism.
There were the incredible treks
through the stands in search of
elusive Pepsi, and zealous sheriff
who attempted to clear the aisles
and was shamed off by the
incredulous looks of students.
And the ressurection of last year's
yell leaders made it reassuring to
know that "it's alright."
Five p.m. The Buck Club
"tailgating" consuming their
picnic dinners and leftover liquid
in the parking lot as if breaking a
13-year fast, still pu/zling over the
incredible victory, not to mention
the impromptu discotheque which
formed on the field after the
game. Trying to figure out what
happened to the mass hysteria
which would have accompanied
such an occasion had they been in
our place, back in the days when
most current Stanford students
hadn't even entered into
Teeny-bopperhood.
Elvis and Tommy
The last time this had
happened, back in 1 957 , Elvis had
barely begun bumping and
grinding his way into the minds
and libidos of American youth.
Listening to LSJUMB, the alums
got the story.
Sly said it right. "We haven't
been back in a long time. But now
we're back, just the same as when
we left." Only the alums never
would have known it.
But one thing was knowledge
common to all—and the alum who
watered his face in the john
could probably dig it, too.

Listening to LSJUMB, the alums
got the story.
Sly said it right. "We haven't
been back in a long time. But now
we're back, just the same as when
we left." Only the alums never
would have known it.
But one thing was knowledge
common to all—and the alum who
watered his face in the john
could probably dig it, too.

HIGHER—and higher Saturday than Friday.

"When it was all over ... I just
had to go to the bathroom and
cry."
It was that perfect. In fact, it
was too damn perfect. Stanford so
convincingly demolished SC that
you couldn't even get too carried
away. There weren't even any
heart attacks to count. It ended
with a sigh of relief.
We won! We had every break in
the book--and breaks that weren't
even in the book. We had Jim
Plunkett and the Rabbit, Ron
Kadziel and Jeff Siemon and a
fiery defense, but somehow it
wasn't the typical Stanford-USC
cliffhanger. When Bob Moore
caught the deflected pass, you
knew that God, or Lady Luck, or

possibly even the All-Father Odin
was on our side, but it was too
subtly indicated.
Too Damn Good
As a matter of fact, the whole
weekend was just too damn good
to be true.
The song says"you can't always
get what you want," but
somehow, for some
incomprehensible reason, Sly
came and vanished without a
riot .. . taking you higher and
higher into the night. By 10:00
the next morning the lines snaked
from the stadium back to Roscoe
Maples, and when the gates finally
opened the Indian onslaught
commenced and it didn't stop

until Steve Horowitz pounded
that last nail in the belly of the
Trojan Horse.
The smiling Santa Clara
deputies at the gates couldn't tear
the tickets in half and give them
back fast enough. The eager
crowd, high on Sly and Red
Mountain, its appetite for Trojan
blood whetted with Coors' Rocky
Mountain Spring Water and fired
up with innumerable J's, poured
through the floodgates at the
south end, and whistled down the
ramp. They swarmed into the
card-studded eastern stands like so
many lemmings, staking out
territory for friends and frats, and
unpacking smuggled solid and
liquid fuel.
And when it was over, the very
instant Horowitz knew that this
year his field goal would count,
the silence was incredibly
defening. And for Steve, it seemed
like a beautiful, personal
"Fuck-U, SC!"
In the Bag
There wasn't even the
traditional countdown as the
Phillips 66 clock ticked away the
final seconds of Jim Plunkett's
sweet revenge. There were nearly
three minutes to savor absolute,
in-the-bag victory—not celebration
or total anguish determined in
running seconds.
Just utter stoned silence as the
awesome realization swelled up
from the field and stands with the
fragrance of newly blossomed
roses. And then students began
happily wondering how to tell
parents and relatives, "Well, I'll
only be home for a week. Got to
get back to Pasadena."

For a while, there were some
doubts.
Would it come off? Sly? The
Game? Friday night was all
apprehension. It looked like it
could have been the greatest
weekend in history. It also could
have been the worst. 2000 people
waiting outside Frost as Carp
floundered through their set.
Then the dam burst and the
amphitheatre filled to the brim.
Stand
Leo. Squeezing
together . . . waiting. Sly. Wanting
people to do their thing, not sit
back and watch him to his.
"Stand" ... A bunch of college
students went down because they
stood. If that don't give you a
reason to stand, Nothin' can."
Stand! Higher . . . reach out! Bob
Moore did, as 90,0 00 stood and
he went over and pandemonium
broke as we realized that we could
do it after all.
Then the power went out, but
the faint throbbings of "Sex
Machine" eminated from the
Stage. Sly handled it like a pro.
Jimmy Jones got dumped for
thirty yards and he couldn't
handle it. Jeff Siemon growled
"Vidi, Vici, Veni," and the Trojan
protection popped open to let
him through.
For the first Saturday night
ever, the Stanford campus came
alive. The music, the cars loaded
with polluted compatriots
bombing from party to party, not
realizing until they went home to
crash how drunk and stoned they
really were. A truly rosy glow.
And the first success in the
history of abortive Wilbur
bashes . . . frosh smoking dope in
the courtyard after smoking all
afternoon in the stands.
There was no bomb. All the
local rads are also heavy football
fans. Was it all a ruse by the
Sheriff to get as many of his men
in to see the game as he could?

And when the Trojan band
goose-stepped off the field to the
echoes of a thunderous
"Sieg-Heil" from the Stanford
cards, the'Tncomparables" played
their gig, once and for all time
proving the superiority of the
Woodstock Nation over the forces
of Fascism.
There were the incredible treks
through the stands in search of
elusive Pepsi, and zealous sheriff
who attempted to clear the aisles
and was shamed off by the
incredulous looks of students.
And the ressurection of last year's
yell leaders made it reassuring to
know that "it's alright."
Five p.m. The Buck Club
"tailgating" consuming their
picnic dinners and leftover liquid
in the parking lot as if breaking a
13-year fast, still pu/zling over the
incredible victory, not to mention
the impromptu discotheque which
formed on the field after the
game. Trying to figure out what
happened to the mass hysteria
which would have accompanied
such an occasion had they been in
our place, back in the days when
most current Stanford students
hadn't even entered into
Teeny-bopperhood.
Elvis and Tommy
The last time this had
happened, back in 1 957 , Elvis had
barely begun bumping and
grinding his way into the minds
and libidos of American youth.
Listening to LSJUMB, the alums
got the story.
Sly said it right. "We haven't
been back in a long time. But now
we're back, just the same as when

game. Trying to figure out what
happened to the mass hysteria
which would have accompanied
such an occasion had they been in
our place, back in the days when
most current Stanford students
hadn't even entered into
Teeny-bopperhood.
Elvis and Tommy
The last time this had
happened, back in 1 957 , Elvis had
barely begun bumping and
grinding his way into the minds
and libidos of American youth.
Listening to LSJUMB, the alums
got the story.
Sly said it right. "We haven't
been back in a long time. But now
we're back, just the same as when
we left." Only the alums never
would have known it.
But one thing was knowledge
common to all—and the alum who
watered his face in the john
could probably dig it, too.

HIGHER—and higher Saturday than Friday.

"When it was all over ... I just
had to go to the bathroom and
cry."
It was that perfect. In fact, it
was too damn perfect. Stanford so
convincingly demolished SC that
you couldn't even get too carried
away. There weren't even any
heart attacks to count. It ended
with a sigh of relief.
We won! We had every break in
the book--and breaks that weren't
even in the book. We had Jim
Plunkett and the Rabbit, Ron
Kadziel and Jeff Siemon and a
fiery defense, but somehow it
wasn't the typical Stanford-USC
cliffhanger. When Bob Moore
caught the deflected pass, you
knew that God, or Lady Luck, or

possibly even the All-Father Odin
was on our side, but it was too
subtly indicated.
Too Damn Good
As a matter of fact, the whole
weekend was just too damn good
to be true.
The song says"you can't always
get what you want," but
somehow, for some
incomprehensible reason, Sly
came and vanished without a
riot .. . taking you higher and
higher into the night. By 10:00
the next morning the lines snaked
from the stadium back to Roscoe
Maples, and when the gates finally
opened the Indian onslaught
commenced and it didn't stop

until Steve Horowitz pounded
that last nail in the belly of the
Trojan Horse.
The smiling Santa Clara
deputies at the gates couldn't tear
the tickets in half and give them
back fast enough. The eager
crowd, high on Sly and Red
Mountain, its appetite for Trojan
blood whetted with Coors' Rocky
Mountain Spring Water and fired
up with innumerable J's, poured
through the floodgates at the
south end, and whistled down the
ramp. They swarmed into the
card-studded eastern stands like so
many lemmings, staking out
territory for friends and frats, and
unpacking smuggled solid and
liquid fuel.
And when it was over, the very
instant Horowitz knew that this
year his field goal would count,
the silence was incredibly
defening. And for Steve, it seemed
like a beautiful, personal
"Fuck-U, SC!"
In the Bag
There wasn't even the
traditional countdown as the
Phillips 66 clock ticked away the
final seconds of Jim Plunkett's
sweet revenge. There were nearly
three minutes to savor absolute,
in-the-bag victory—not celebration
or total anguish determined in
running seconds.
Just utter stoned silence as the
awesome realization swelled up
from the field and stands with the
fragrance of newly blossomed
roses. And then students began
happily wondering how to tell
parents and relatives, "Well, I'll
only be home for a week. Got to
get back to Pasadena."

For a while, there were some
doubts.
Would it come off? Sly? The
Game? Friday night was all
apprehension. It looked like it
could have been the greatest
weekend in history. It also could
have been the worst. 2000 people
waiting outside Frost as Carp
floundered through their set.
Then the dam burst and the
amphitheatre filled to the brim.
Stand
Leo. Squeezing
together . . . waiting. Sly. Wanting
people to do their thing, not sit
back and watch him to his.
"Stand" ... A bunch of college
students went down because they
stood. If that don't give you a
reason to stand, Nothin' can."
Stand! Higher . . . reach out! Bob
Moore did, as 90,0 00 stood and
he went over and pandemonium
broke as we realized that we could
do it after all.
Then the power went out, but
the faint throbbings of "Sex
Machine" eminated from the
Stage. Sly handled it like a pro.
Jimmy Jones got dumped for
thirty yards and he couldn't
handle it. Jeff Siemon growled
"Vidi, Vici, Veni," and the Trojan
protection popped open to let
him through.
For the first Saturday night
ever, the Stanford campus came
alive. The music, the cars loaded
with polluted compatriots
bombing from party to party, not
realizing until they went home to
crash how drunk and stoned they
really were. A truly rosy glow.
And the first success in the
history of abortive Wilbur
bashes . . . frosh smoking dope in
the courtyard after smoking all
afternoon in the stands.
There was no bomb. All the
local rads are also heavy football
fans. Was it all a ruse by the
Sheriff to get as many of his men
in to see the game as he could?

And when the Trojan band
goose-stepped off the field to the
echoes of a thunderous
"Sieg-Heil" from the Stanford
cards, the'Tncomparables" played
their gig, once and for all time
proving the superiority of the
Woodstock Nation over the forces
of Fascism.
There were the incredible treks
through the stands in search of
elusive Pepsi, and zealous sheriff
who attempted to clear the aisles
and was shamed off by the
incredulous looks of students.
And the ressurection of last year's
yell leaders made it reassuring to
know that "it's alright."
Five p.m. The Buck Club
"tailgating" consuming their
picnic dinners and leftover liquid
in the parking lot as if breaking a
13-year fast, still pu/zling over the
incredible victory, not to mention
the impromptu discotheque which
formed on the field after the
game. Trying to figure out what
happened to the mass hysteria
which would have accompanied

Five p.m. The Buck Club
"tailgating" consuming their
picnic dinners and leftover liquid
in the parking lot as if breaking a
13-year fast, still pu/zling over the
incredible victory, not to mention
the impromptu discotheque which
formed on the field after the
game. Trying to figure out what

barely begun bumping and
grinding his way into the minds
and libidos of American youth.
Listening to LSJUMB, the alums
got the story.
Sly said it right. "We haven't
been back in a long time. But now
we're back, just the same as when
we left." Only the alums never
would have known it.
But one thing was knowledge
common to all—and the alum who
watered his face in the john
could probably dig it, too.
