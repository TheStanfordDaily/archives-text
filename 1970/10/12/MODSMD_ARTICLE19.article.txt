# 'Troilus And Cressida' Opens Drama Department Season
## 
### 
Shakespeare's "Troilus and
Cressida" will open Stanford's
19 70-71 Drama Department
Productions at 8 p.m. Wednesday,
October 14, in the Little Theater.
This production will be
presented by Stanford director
John Chioles. Actors will be
drawn largely from MPA (Master
of Fine Arts) candidates in the
Department of Speech and
Drama. During the previous
summer, Professor Chioles
mounted a production of this
same play utilizing actors from

the Stanford Contemporary
Theater Workshop.
"Troilus and Cressida" was
first printed in 1609. It is thought
that the play was written between
"Hamlet" and "Othello." As with
most of his plays, Shakespeare
derives his story from earlier
works. This love story was taken
from Chaucer's poem "Troylus
and Crysede" and the story of the
siege of Troy primarily from Latin
translations of Homer's Iliad.
The plot of "Troilus and
Cressida" concerns the love of
Troilus, son of Troy's King Priam,
for the less than constant
Cressida, daughter of the priest
Calchas, who leaves his daughter
in the beleaguered Troy while he
flees to the Greeks with the
foreknowledge of Troy's defeat.
The story, however, appears to
have been less important to
Shakespeare than his contempt
and disgust at the realization of
how not only cities, but
judgement, character, and love
itself, may be laid waste in a war
where both sides are inexorably

committed to unjust ends.
Yet "Troilus and Cressida" is
not totally pessimistic. Positive
beliefs, values, and instincts are
asserted and celebrated, not
always diminished by event.
Professor Chioles sees "Troilus
and Cressida" as a true epic drama
"with sudden shifts from some
particular or personal questions to
discussion of the widest and most
universal principles."
He adds "It is a play containing
many contradictory thoughts and
emotions which produce a jarring
orchestration of cynicism and
romantic notion."
To play these dissonances to
the hilt, Chioles will employ
special sound design, projections,
and a nonrealistic setting designed
by Wendell Cole.
"Troilus and Cressida" will be
performed at 8 p.m. nightly in the
Little Theater from October 14
through October 17, and October
21 through October 24. A 2 p.m.
matinee is scheduled October 17.
Following "Troilus and
Cressida," the next production of
the season will be the West Coast
premier of the Schyler Watts
translation of Jean Giraudoux's
"Ondine" (opening December 2 ).
