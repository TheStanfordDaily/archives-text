# Stanford Prevails This Time, 24-14
## 
### FRED LEESON 
The roar this time when the clock
ran out was Stanford's.
The beauty of it was that Stanford
won offensively and defensively, and
USC played so well there could be no
excuses. The Trojans were beaten,
nothing else.
At the end they were beaten by a
Steve Horowitz field goal which put
Stanford ahead by 10, 24-14, and stole
any chance of USC victory.
Before that, the Trojans were beaten
by the Stanford defense which stopped
them twice at fourth and one situations

fnside the three and by Jim Plunkett's
superb passing which gained 2 75 yards.
"The two goal line situations were
the keys," said a hot, happy and calm
John Ralston afterward. "They didn't
make their fourth and ones and we
made ours. Reverse those and it could
have been different."
Running back Jackie Brown scored
two touchdowns from the one. Bob
Moore caught a 30 yard pass and ran it
another 2 0 for the first score. Stanford
was never behind, never tied.
Stanford didn't run well against
USC, but the passing game went so well
it didn't matter. Randy Vataha led all

receivers with 10 catches and 120
yards.
One of his catches—a fourth down
and three play from the SC 37—he
carried to the three, setting up
Stanford's last touchdown after an 89
yard drive.
The series followed USC's first
touchdown when it appeared that the
Trojans were about to take control of
the game.
Stanford's victory and Oregon's
41-40 upset of UCLA leaves the Tribe
as the only undefeated team in Pac-8
play.
The team with the fewest league
losses and ties will be the Rose Bowl
representative. It is too early yet to
devise a formula showing who must
beat whom for Stanford to go to the
Rose Bowl—and players and coaches
insist they'll be playing one game at a
time—but if the Indians win their
remaining five league games the bowl is
theirs.
Powerful Running Game
Southern Cal's powerful running
game—which had been averaging 34 3
yards per game—was held to 172, and
that was reduced to 105 after the
yardage was subtracted for the times
Jimmy Jones was dumped trying to
pass.
Jones completed 21 of 36 passes for
277 yards (two more than Plunkett)
and was still looking for Bob Chandler
and Sam Dickerson when time ran out.
The Trojans' leading rusher,
Clarence Davis, suffered a minor injury
near the end of the first half, but

fourth string tailback Rod McNeill took
his place and ran for 7 7 yards in the
second half.
Still, it was a magnificently prepared
defense \\ftich consistently stymied the
Trojans.
"We had agreed before that if we
couldn't go 110 percent we'd take
ourselves out and put somebody else
in," said tackle Greg Sampson. "We
knew we would have to gang tackle to
stop them."
USC's Mike Berry was thwarted in
the second quarter on a fourth down
and goal play from the Stanford one,
and in the fourth quarter Jim
Kauffman dropped Jones on the five on
a fourth and one play from the three.
Defensive Gains
Quarterback Jones suffered losses of
4 9 yards in the second half as
Stanford's pass rush broke through.
After a short punt by Steve Murray
in the fourth quarter, Bill Alexander
and Jody Graves downed Jones on
successive pass attempts, pushing him
back 28 yards from the Stanford 31.
From then it was over except for a
masterful 51 yard drive (three Plunkett
passes for 43 of them) which took
three minutes off the clock and set up
Horowitz for the 36 yard field goal.
USC led Stanford 22-17 in first
downs, 172 to 131 in yards rushing and
277 to 275 in net yards passing.
But Stanford won the statistical
battle last year. This time the Indians
won it on the scoreboard, and 86,000
people and a lot of football players will
remember it for a long time.

THUNDERCHICK Stanford's Dave Tipton, his helmet smeared with Trojan
maroon, moves in against the USC offense Saturday. The Tribe defensive
linemen- Tipton, Bill Alexander, Pete Lazetich and Jody Graves-picked up the
nickname "Thunderchickens" in practice and were praised by players and
c oaches for their massive defense work against the Trojan's powerful attack.
The roar this time when the clock
ran out was Stanford's.
The beauty of it was that Stanford
won offensively and defensively, and
USC played so well there could be no
excuses. The Trojans were beaten,
nothing else.
At the end they were beaten by a
Steve Horowitz field goal which put
Stanford ahead by 10, 24-14, and stole
any chance of USC victory.
Before that, the Trojans were beaten
by the Stanford defense which stopped
them twice at fourth and one situations

fnside the three and by Jim Plunkett's
superb passing which gained 2 75 yards.
"The two goal line situations were
the keys," said a hot, happy and calm
John Ralston afterward. "They didn't
make their fourth and ones and we
made ours. Reverse those and it could
have been different."
Running back Jackie Brown scored
two touchdowns from the one. Bob
Moore caught a 30 yard pass and ran it
another 2 0 for the first score. Stanford
was never behind, never tied.
Stanford didn't run well against
USC, but the passing game went so well
it didn't matter. Randy Vataha led all

receivers with 10 catches and 120
yards.
One of his catches—a fourth down
and three play from the SC 37—he
carried to the three, setting up
Stanford's last touchdown after an 89
yard drive.
The series followed USC's first
touchdown when it appeared that the
Trojans were about to take control of
the game.
Stanford's victory and Oregon's
41-40 upset of UCLA leaves the Tribe
as the only undefeated team in Pac-8
play.
The team with the fewest league
losses and ties will be the Rose Bowl
representative. It is too early yet to
devise a formula showing who must
beat whom for Stanford to go to the
Rose Bowl—and players and coaches
insist they'll be playing one game at a
time—but if the Indians win their
remaining five league games the bowl is
theirs.
Powerful Running Game
Southern Cal's powerful running
game—which had been averaging 34 3
yards per game—was held to 172, and
that was reduced to 105 after the
yardage was subtracted for the times
Jimmy Jones was dumped trying to
pass.
Jones completed 21 of 36 passes for
277 yards (two more than Plunkett)
and was still looking for Bob Chandler
and Sam Dickerson when time ran out.
The Trojans' leading rusher,
Clarence Davis, suffered a minor injury
near the end of the first half, but

fourth string tailback Rod McNeill took
his place and ran for 7 7 yards in the
second half.
Still, it was a magnificently prepared
defense \\ftich consistently stymied the
Trojans.
"We had agreed before that if we
couldn't go 110 percent we'd take
ourselves out and put somebody else
in," said tackle Greg Sampson. "We
knew we would have to gang tackle to
stop them."
USC's Mike Berry was thwarted in
the second quarter on a fourth down
and goal play from the Stanford one,
and in the fourth quarter Jim
Kauffman dropped Jones on the five on
a fourth and one play from the three.
Defensive Gains
Quarterback Jones suffered losses of
4 9 yards in the second half as
Stanford's pass rush broke through.
After a short punt by Steve Murray
in the fourth quarter, Bill Alexander
and Jody Graves downed Jones on
successive pass attempts, pushing him
back 28 yards from the Stanford 31.
From then it was over except for a
masterful 51 yard drive (three Plunkett
passes for 43 of them) which took
three minutes off the clock and set up
Horowitz for the 36 yard field goal.
USC led Stanford 22-17 in first
downs, 172 to 131 in yards rushing and
277 to 275 in net yards passing.
But Stanford won the statistical
battle last year. This time the Indians
won it on the scoreboard, and 86,000
people and a lot of football players will
remember it for a long time.

277 to 275 in net yards passing.
But Stanford won the statistical
battle last year. This time the Indians
won it on the scoreboard, and 86,000
people and a lot of football players will
remember it for a long time.

THUNDERCHICK Stanford's Dave Tipton, his helmet smeared with Trojan
maroon, moves in against the USC offense Saturday. The Tribe defensive
linemen- Tipton, Bill Alexander, Pete Lazetich and Jody Graves-picked up the
nickname "Thunderchickens" in practice and were praised by players and
c oaches for their massive defense work against the Trojan's powerful attack.
The roar this time when the clock
ran out was Stanford's.
The beauty of it was that Stanford
won offensively and defensively, and
USC played so well there could be no
excuses. The Trojans were beaten,
nothing else.
At the end they were beaten by a
Steve Horowitz field goal which put
Stanford ahead by 10, 24-14, and stole
any chance of USC victory.
Before that, the Trojans were beaten
by the Stanford defense which stopped
them twice at fourth and one situations

fnside the three and by Jim Plunkett's
superb passing which gained 2 75 yards.
"The two goal line situations were
the keys," said a hot, happy and calm
John Ralston afterward. "They didn't
make their fourth and ones and we
made ours. Reverse those and it could
have been different."
Running back Jackie Brown scored
two touchdowns from the one. Bob
Moore caught a 30 yard pass and ran it
another 2 0 for the first score. Stanford
was never behind, never tied.
Stanford didn't run well against
USC, but the passing game went so well
it didn't matter. Randy Vataha led all

receivers with 10 catches and 120
yards.
One of his catches—a fourth down
and three play from the SC 37—he
carried to the three, setting up
Stanford's last touchdown after an 89
yard drive.
The series followed USC's first
touchdown when it appeared that the
Trojans were about to take control of
the game.
Stanford's victory and Oregon's
41-40 upset of UCLA leaves the Tribe
as the only undefeated team in Pac-8
play.
The team with the fewest league
losses and ties will be the Rose Bowl
representative. It is too early yet to
devise a formula showing who must
beat whom for Stanford to go to the
Rose Bowl—and players and coaches
insist they'll be playing one game at a
time—but if the Indians win their
remaining five league games the bowl is
theirs.
Powerful Running Game
Southern Cal's powerful running
game—which had been averaging 34 3
yards per game—was held to 172, and
that was reduced to 105 after the
yardage was subtracted for the times
Jimmy Jones was dumped trying to
pass.
Jones completed 21 of 36 passes for
277 yards (two more than Plunkett)
and was still looking for Bob Chandler
and Sam Dickerson when time ran out.
The Trojans' leading rusher,
Clarence Davis, suffered a minor injury
near the end of the first half, but

fourth string tailback Rod McNeill took
his place and ran for 7 7 yards in the
second half.
Still, it was a magnificently prepared
defense \\ftich consistently stymied the
Trojans.
"We had agreed before that if we
couldn't go 110 percent we'd take
ourselves out and put somebody else
in," said tackle Greg Sampson. "We
knew we would have to gang tackle to
stop them."
USC's Mike Berry was thwarted in
the second quarter on a fourth down
and goal play from the Stanford one,
and in the fourth quarter Jim
Kauffman dropped Jones on the five on
a fourth and one play from the three.
Defensive Gains
Quarterback Jones suffered losses of
4 9 yards in the second half as
Stanford's pass rush broke through.
After a short punt by Steve Murray
in the fourth quarter, Bill Alexander
and Jody Graves downed Jones on
successive pass attempts, pushing him
back 28 yards from the Stanford 31.
From then it was over except for a
masterful 51 yard drive (three Plunkett
passes for 43 of them) which took
three minutes off the clock and set up
Horowitz for the 36 yard field goal.
USC led Stanford 22-17 in first
downs, 172 to 131 in yards rushing and
277 to 275 in net yards passing.
But Stanford won the statistical
battle last year. This time the Indians
won it on the scoreboard, and 86,000
people and a lot of football players will
remember it for a long time.
