### DAVID LEVINTHAL 
"Wind From the East,"
Jean-Luc Godard's most recent
film, is both an extension of his
current development and a radical
response to all of Western
film-making, of which much of
Godard's own work seemed to be
the vanguard.
"Wind From the East" is the
carefully outlined story of
nothing at all. The dialogue is a
radical diatribe and the action is
nonexistent.
If the film is not simply
brushed aside as a parody, then it
must be viewed as a serious
attempt at a Marxist-Leninist film.
Since the film claims that all the
movies we see today, including
those of Eastern Europe, are
produced by Nixon-Paramount,
then the only way to reach a true
workers film would be to destroy
the current cinema and along with
that our tastes and responses.
To this end "Wind From the
East" might be the first, and thus
rather immature, step to providing
an antidote for Western Culture.
Like a workers parody of United
States imperialism the acting and
message is so direct that it appears
crude and unsubtle. There are no
emotions other than hate, there
are no other goals except the
dictatorship of the proletariat.
The film is thus intolerable unless
its words and phrases are loved
and believed.
I chose to regard the film
seriously because it seemed too
easy to say that it was a satire. To
do so would render the film
harmless, would absorb it into the
genre of Western film and let it

pass. The screenplay is by Godard
and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, and thus
it seems we have to face the
reality of what Godard is saying,
take literally what is on the
screen, not call it a brutal parody
of student revolt. When a young
girl distributing radical literature
asks "will the people of the third
world please come forward . . ." it
seems only fair to be allowed to
laugh, as we laughed at
''Masculine-Feminine,"
"LaChinoise," or the radical
interludes of "One Plus One." We
were laughing at ourselves and our
liberal-radicalism.
Now Godard has taken the
genre of John Wayne the Western,
an outgrowth and the most
traditional aspect of Western
cinema and attempted to destroy
it with Marxian virtue. This is
certainly a logical step toward a
workers' cinema, the only
question is whether it is
worthwhile.
The film is bad; it tempts one
to feel that if he does not like it
he is not a true believer. If you are
willing to spend an hour and forty
minutes listening to a tape of an
S.D.S. meeting and watching a
home movie (another equivalent
being a fun-filled noon rally) then
you must really love the home
team, which in this instance is
Marxist-Leninist theory poorly
espoused.
We are being asked to trade
Western cinema or more basically
Western culture for a poor
attempt at revolutionary art.
Perhaps a good example is
forthcoming which will allow us
to reconsider.
