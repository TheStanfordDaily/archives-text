# A 						Long Time Coming, But It's Here
## 
### FRED LEESON 
There was downright
jubulation, but only for a few
minutes. The feeling after the win
among players and coaches was
not the noisy surprise of an upset
but more a glowing pleasure that
they had been right all along in
their confidence.
"Now let's be gracious," Coach
John Ralston told his players after
they had worked through the
milling throng of kids and finally
locked the door to the stadium
meeting room.
Ralston greeted each with a
hug and individual congratulations
as they came in.
"Humility in victory is the
greatest way to go," he said after
the team captains silenced the
shouting.
"It puts a lot of pressure now
on each league game, but this is
just the beginning. We're ready for
any pressure they can give us.
"I couldn't be prouder of any
group of guys than this one."
The door was unlocked.
Swarming kids fought to get in as
the players edged out and headed
up the road to the showers. Film
crews charged in to get to
Plunkett.
At the dressing room Richard

Lyman shook hands as each
player came in, and got a close
look at a bloody cut near Terrell
Smith's eyebrow which took four
stitches to close.
Hillary Shockley spoke of the
strong USC line he had spent the
afternoon running into. "They
were doing a lot of blitzing. It was
pretty touch in there. We could
have run more against them but
our passing was working so well."
"I thought I might have a
chance of going all the way," Eric
Cross said of his second quarter
punt return which he ran frm the
Stanford 3 4 to the USC 19,
setting up the Tribe's second
touchdown.
"But that last guy got me. The
whole game was just beautiful."
"I knew we were gonna do it,"
said guard Pete Lazetich with
convincing confidence. The SC
drives stopped inside the three?
"For some reason I knew we'd
stop them. I knew from the start
the guys were keyed up. No,
there'll be no more Purdues."
Then came Steve Horwitz, who
had some trying times in the two
previous losses to USC and who
came through Saturday with three
perfect extra points and a long
field goal which killed Trojan

chances.
"I really didn't have time to
worry on the field goal," he said.
"I guess I just blanked, or maybe
you could say it was cautious
optimism. It just had to be done. I
learned that after two years."
Jackie Brown described his
second touchdown from the one,
a play where he hit short of the
goal and kept going.
"We had about a half a foot to
go. I wasn't really sure what down
it was (fourth) but I figured, 'This
one has to make it.'
"The blocks were sustained so
I could keep my feet. I got hit but
I still had room to slide and
twist."
Linebacker Ron Kadziel
credited the excellent defensive
job to the linemen, Dave Tipton,
Lazetich, Larry Butler and Bill
Alexander.
"Those down linemen were
just incredible," Kadziel said.
"They just wanted it so bad."
Bob Moore, who put Stanford
ahead quickly on a 50 yard
scoring pass said he was sure he
stayed one-on-one, and that's
tough on any back. And give Jim
a yard and he'll hit you."
Jim Kauffman's tackle of
Jimmy Jones on a fourth down at

the Stanford three killed a 60
yard Trojan drive which was
nearly essential for USC hopes.
"I anticipated him to hand off
to one of the backs," he said. "I
just wanted to get in there as fast
as I could. It was just fortunate 1
got in there untouched.
"After 1 hit him I wasn't sure if
he kept going and scored or what.
I looked around and saw him on
the ground and really felt a surge
inside."
Another pressure play was
made by Demea Washington who
made a reception on third down
keeping Stanford's final drive
alive.
"Jim threw a little high, but it
didn't matter. 1 wasn't worried
because we ran that pattern two
times in a row, and the first time 1
was wide open.
"We know now we can beat
any team in the country, if we
want to."
Saturday was Ralston's first
win over USC. After some
thought he denied that it was his
most satisfying win.
"There were four of them as
equally fine. Two were up at Utah
State against Utah and Wyoming.
Then there were the '6 4 and '68
Cal wins.

would score as soon as he had the
ball.
"Their man was playing me
man for man. I thought I'd make
it and I was surprised that guy got
me at the goal. 1 was worried my
knee had hit outside the goal line.
Jim (Plunkett) was sharp all day
today."
Plunkett's primary receiver was
Randy Vataha who made 10
catches.
"It'll take three days to come
down," he said autographing his
way to the showers. "We're ready
to go now."
"I thought they'd bring their
monster man over, but they
didn't," which is why he was open
much of the afternoon. "They

"But this was a lot of fun,
too." And after a pause: "Now
we've got to be in a frenzy every
week."
As usual, quarterback Plunkett
was last to make it in, taking an
hour and a half to sign autographs
along the way.
"It was great for Coach
Ralston," he said. "Nobody
knows how badly he wanted it.
He doesn't have to make any
excuses this time."
The successful passing attack?
"They were so worried about
Jackie (Brown) and Hillary
(Shockley) they left Bob Moore
and our wide receivers wide
open."
Without prodding he
responded to the hyperbolic wit
of John McKay which, although it
really hadn't been unleashed full
strength against Stanford this
time, still hurt a little as it came
out during the week in the Los

Angeles newspapers "He can be as
funny as he wants now."
By then nearly all the other
players had finished dressing and
had left, many standing around in
the outside courtyard visiting with
relatives, friends and friends of
friends.
Inside about all that remained
of Stanford's greatest football
victory since who-knows-when
were squashed apple cores littered
on the floor with pieces of cut
tape and melting ice from the
soda cooler.
The last of the autograph
seekers were gone, the questions
were answered and the
quarterback glanced out of one of
the high windows as he disengaged
himself from the tape and padding
which protect his left shoulder.
"It's almost night," he said to
nobody in particular.
And that was the end of some
day.



THE UPS AND DOWNS—USC tailback Mike Berry (23), above, leaps for the Stanford goal line on a
fourth and one play. His leap was short—it isn't clear if he was actually tackled—and the Trojans gave up
the bail. Stanford's defense later held again at the three. USC quarterback Jimmy .Jones (8), right, stands
dejected at the sidelines after he was dumped for 29 yards of losses by Bill Alexander and Jody Graves on
successive plays in the fourth quarter. It was the first time that Jones has been on a losing team in his
college career.
