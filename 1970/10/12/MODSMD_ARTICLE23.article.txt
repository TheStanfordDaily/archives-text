## From The Stands Worth Every Minute

"I don't believe it. I just don't
believe it! We finally beat those
Fill in the blank with
your own favorite obscenity,
because everybody else did.
These were the feelings of
more than a few people following
Saturday's memorable victory.
High-flying Stanford students
screamed it as they
enthusiastically celebrated the end
of al3 year drought.

And USC fans and players
expressed sentiments of similar
disbelief, only a bit softer. For
this game that had burst their
long-lived balloon was not easy to
accept. It would be a long trip
home.
But for those who had made
more than one such sad trip back
from Los Angeles, all was joy
Saturday. In retrospect, the eight
or so hours of sunburn and
waiting in line, of warm beer and
16-inch seat allotments seemed
beautiful in every way.
The day had started serenely
enough with thousands waiting in
line before being admitted under
the scrutiny of wary,
bomb-hunting deputy sheriffs.
The monotony of the long wait
was only made easier by such
profound comments of people in
line as, "Wow it's just like
registration!" and "Boy, there
sure are a lot of weird people at
Stanford!"
For the first two hours in the
stadium, the only entertainment
was provided by the repeated
public address announcement
concerning the bomb threat,
which warned ignorant fans not to
suffer coronaries when Stanford's
cannon went off.
Following the usual pre-game
show and a bunch of obscene
cheers (evidence of 13 years of
frustration), everyone got down
to business.
In the early going, the
much-publicized SC backs did
pick up a couple of good gains.
This prompted one grandstand

expert to remark, "What did I tell
you, their bulls will run us out of
here." But as it turned out
Stanford's defense turned the tide
and ran them out of the stadium.
Hours of practice on goal line
stands finally paid off as the
Indians, not once, but twice
stopped the mighty Trojans inside
the five. Screams of disbelief and
uncontrollable enthusiasm swept
the rooters on both occasions.
The Stanford cannon went off
four times during the first half as
the Indians' offense did as
expected and piled up 1 \ early
points. But the "D" was doing the
impossible, holding the Trojan
football machine scoreless for 30
minutes.
As the fourth quarter rolled
along, smiles grew wider. For a
moment after an SC interception,
shades of last year's gloom hung
over the crowd, but the Tribe
defense quickly stopped any
Trojan hopes.
Only the clock remained to bv
conquered and as the final
seconds ran off in rhythm with
the swaying goal posts, victory
was ours.
Thirteen years of losses were
over. Thirteen thousand USC fans
could think about it on their way
home. It was hard to believe, but
very sweet.
Talk now turned to the
longevity of a 1 9-year period since
Stanford's last Rose Bowl
appearance in 1951 . Stanford isn't
there yet, but they're a lot closer
than before. Especially a lot closer
than USC. As one fan said, "Outta
sight!"


ON TOP, FlNALLYâ€”Stanford Coach John Ralston rides the
shoulders of his victorious football players after Saturday's decisive
2 4-14 over favored USC. It was Ralston s first win over the Trojans in
his eight years at Stanford and softens the memories of the past two
years when the Indians lost by three and two points.
