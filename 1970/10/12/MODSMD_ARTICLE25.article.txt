More Radical Bomb Threats
The nation's major airports beefed up security
arrangements Sunday, the first day of a week in which
the radical Weatherman has said it would begin a "fall
offensive."
In Chicano, an anonymous Weatherman author said
the underground group was attacking "all institutions
of American injustice and would seek to free "all
political prisoners" such as Black Panther leader Bobby
Seale and the Rev. Daniel Berrigan, a catholic priest
imprisoned in connection with the destruction of draft
records.
The Federal Aviation administration said bomb
threats had been made against airports from coast to
coast.
Thursday three bombings occurred on the West
Coast, one at an armory in Santa Barbara and the
others in a courthouse in San Rafael, Calif., and in
military training facilities on the campus of the
University of Washington in Seattle. Saturday a
courthouse in Queens, New York, was bombed.
Damage was substantial in every case.
Radical groups claimed responsibility for all four
bombings. Police said they appeared to be the work of
a conspiracy and Friday President Nixon ordered the
FBI to investigate the situation.
Puerto Rico Hard Hit
SAN JUAN — Puerto Rico is slowly recovering from
one of its worst catastrophes in history after floods left
at least 50 dead or missing, close to 10,000 homeless
and more than $50 million in damage.
The sun shone Sunday for the first time in more
than a week and the tropical depression that brought
all the rain to the Caribbean island had moved far out
into the Atlantic, the National Weather Service
reported.
Thousands of Puerto Ricans were cleaning debris
from inland towns, especially Barceloneta, west of San
Juan; Aibonito, a small town in the central mountain
range; and Coamo, on the south coast.

Civil defense volunteers, National Guardsmen, civic
groups, the Red Cross and thousands of citizens were
working around the clock helping the homeless.
USSR Hits Peace Plan
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State William P. Rogers
dismissed Moscow's negative reaction to U.S. peace
initiative in Indochina and the Middle East as "the
standard line opposition," and said Sunday he remains
hopeful meaningful negotiations can begin shortly.
"The public position they take in the press doesn't
necessarily coincide with the official attitude," Rogers
said. "It's certainly disappointing, but I hope in private
discussions they'll act differently."
The secretary was referring to weekend comments
in Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, which
called President Nixon's five-point peace proposal for
Indochina "a great fraud."
In view of the favorable reaction throughout the
world, Rogers said, "I don't understand how the Soviet
Union has the courage to make that suggestion."
Although Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird also
expressed hope the Communists would agree to
"negotiate in good conscience," he didn't appear as
confident as Rogers.
Both officials referred to Nixon's proposal as fair
and forthright and said if offers the best chance for
peace.
Egypt Denounces Ceasefire
CAIRO — Egypt declared Sunday it would not extend
the Middle East cease-fire unless Israel returns to U.N.
peace talks and Israel repeated it would not take part
in the talks until Egypt withdraws missiles from the
truce zone.
The stand taken by the new government of Egypt's
acting president, Anwar Sadat, countered the hope in
many capitals that the three cease-fire signers—lsrael,
Egypt and Jordan—would continue to honor the
standdown despite the collapse of negotiations.
The U.S.-sponsored 90-day cease-fire is to expire
Nov. 5.

An aide to Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud
Riad said Egypt's opposition to an extension did not
mean "that on the fifth of November we are going to
start shooting." But he added if Israel does not return
to the negotiations that began last month under U.N.
special envoy Gunnar V. Jarring, the cease-fire is a
commitment "we want to liberate ourselves from.
That's all."
Israel walked out after only one session at U.N.
headquarters, in New York. The government of
Premier Golda Meir said its representative would not
return until Egypt removed Soviet antiaircraft missiles
which it claimed were placed in the Suez Canal truce
zone after the cease-fire went into effect Aug. 7.
Ransom Demands Rejected
MONTREAL — Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa
refused Sunday night the ransom demands of terrorist
kidnapers who hold a British diplomat and a provincial
government minister under threat of death. He pleaded
for negotiations.
Bourassa broadcast his announcement minutes
before the 10 p.m. EDT deadline set by the abductors
for the execution of Pierre Laporte, Quebec labor
minister, if their terms were not met.
There was no word on the fate of either Laporte or
the Briton, James Richard Cross. Cross was kidnaped
last Monday and Laporte on Saturday.
The premier said his government wanted to save the
two men's lives but could not agree to terms until there
were means of insuring their safety.
Rhodes Hits Agnew
WASHINGTON — The youngest member of the
President's Commission on Campus Unrest said Sunday
he believes Vice President Spiro T. Agnew wants to be
president and is beyond the control of President
Nixon.
"I think the President is not necessarily running the
vice president," Joseph Rhodes said.
He also expressed doubt about Nixon's ability to
put the harness on Agnew's frequent condemnations of
campus activists.

the underground group was attacking "all institutions
of American injustice and would seek to free "all

The Federal Aviation administration said bomb

Thursday three bombings occurred on the West
Coast, one at an armory in Santa Barbara and the
others in a courthouse in San Rafael, Calif., and in

Damage was substantial in every case.
Radical groups claimed responsibility for all four
bombings. Police said they appeared to be the work of
a conspiracy and Friday President Nixon ordered the
FBI to investigate the situation.
Puerto Rico Hard Hit
SAN JUAN — Puerto Rico is slowly recovering from
one of its worst catastrophes in history after floods left
at least 50 dead or missing, close to 10,000 homeless
and more than $50 million in damage.
The sun shone Sunday for the first time in more
than a week and the tropical depression that brought
all the rain to the Caribbean island had moved far out
into the Atlantic, the National Weather Service
reported.
Thousands of Puerto Ricans were cleaning debris
from inland towns, especially Barceloneta, west of San
Juan; Aibonito, a small town in the central mountain
range; and Coamo, on the south coast.

Civil defense volunteers, National Guardsmen, civic
groups, the Red Cross and thousands of citizens were
working around the clock helping the homeless.
USSR Hits Peace Plan
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State William P. Rogers
dismissed Moscow's negative reaction to U.S. peace
initiative in Indochina and the Middle East as "the
standard line opposition," and said Sunday he remains
hopeful meaningful negotiations can begin shortly.
"The public position they take in the press doesn't
necessarily coincide with the official attitude," Rogers
said. "It's certainly disappointing, but I hope in private
discussions they'll act differently."
The secretary was referring to weekend comments
in Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, which
called President Nixon's five-point peace proposal for
Indochina "a great fraud."
In view of the favorable reaction throughout the
world, Rogers said, "I don't understand how the Soviet
Union has the courage to make that suggestion."
Although Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird also
expressed hope the Communists would agree to
"negotiate in good conscience," he didn't appear as
confident as Rogers.
Both officials referred to Nixon's proposal as fair
and forthright and said if offers the best chance for
peace.
Egypt Denounces Ceasefire
CAIRO — Egypt declared Sunday it would not extend
the Middle East cease-fire unless Israel returns to U.N.
peace talks and Israel repeated it would not take part
in the talks until Egypt withdraws missiles from the
truce zone.
The stand taken by the new government of Egypt's
acting president, Anwar Sadat, countered the hope in
many capitals that the three cease-fire signers—lsrael,
Egypt and Jordan—would continue to honor the
standdown despite the collapse of negotiations.
The U.S.-sponsored 90-day cease-fire is to expire
Nov. 5.

An aide to Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud
Riad said Egypt's opposition to an extension did not
mean "that on the fifth of November we are going to
start shooting." But he added if Israel does not return
to the negotiations that began last month under U.N.
special envoy Gunnar V. Jarring, the cease-fire is a
commitment "we want to liberate ourselves from.
That's all."
Israel walked out after only one session at U.N.
headquarters, in New York. The government of
Premier Golda Meir said its representative would not
return until Egypt removed Soviet antiaircraft missiles
which it claimed were placed in the Suez Canal truce
zone after the cease-fire went into effect Aug. 7.
Ransom Demands Rejected
MONTREAL — Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa
refused Sunday night the ransom demands of terrorist
kidnapers who hold a British diplomat and a provincial
government minister under threat of death. He pleaded
for negotiations.
Bourassa broadcast his announcement minutes
before the 10 p.m. EDT deadline set by the abductors
for the execution of Pierre Laporte, Quebec labor
minister, if their terms were not met.
There was no word on the fate of either Laporte or
the Briton, James Richard Cross. Cross was kidnaped
last Monday and Laporte on Saturday.
The premier said his government wanted to save the
two men's lives but could not agree to terms until there
were means of insuring their safety.
Rhodes Hits Agnew
WASHINGTON — The youngest member of the
President's Commission on Campus Unrest said Sunday
he believes Vice President Spiro T. Agnew wants to be
president and is beyond the control of President
Nixon.
"I think the President is not necessarily running the
vice president," Joseph Rhodes said.
He also expressed doubt about Nixon's ability to
put the harness on Agnew's frequent condemnations of
campus activists.

The Federal Aviation administration said bomb
threats had been made against airports from coast to
coast.
Thursday three bombings occurred on the West
Coast, one at an armory in Santa Barbara and the
others in a courthouse in San Rafael, Calif., and in
military training facilities on the campus of the
University of Washington in Seattle. Saturday a
courthouse in Queens, New York, was bombed.
Damage was substantial in every case.
Radical groups claimed responsibility for all four
bombings. Police said they appeared to be the work of
a conspiracy and Friday President Nixon ordered the
FBI to investigate the situation.
Puerto Rico Hard Hit
SAN JUAN — Puerto Rico is slowly recovering from
one of its worst catastrophes in history after floods left
at least 50 dead or missing, close to 10,000 homeless
and more than $50 million in damage.
The sun shone Sunday for the first time in more
than a week and the tropical depression that brought
all the rain to the Caribbean island had moved far out
into the Atlantic, the National Weather Service
reported.
Thousands of Puerto Ricans were cleaning debris
from inland towns, especially Barceloneta, west of San
Juan; Aibonito, a small town in the central mountain
range; and Coamo, on the south coast.

Civil defense volunteers, National Guardsmen, civic
groups, the Red Cross and thousands of citizens were
working around the clock helping the homeless.
USSR Hits Peace Plan
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State William P. Rogers
dismissed Moscow's negative reaction to U.S. peace
initiative in Indochina and the Middle East as "the
standard line opposition," and said Sunday he remains
hopeful meaningful negotiations can begin shortly.
"The public position they take in the press doesn't
necessarily coincide with the official attitude," Rogers
said. "It's certainly disappointing, but I hope in private
discussions they'll act differently."
The secretary was referring to weekend comments
in Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, which
called President Nixon's five-point peace proposal for
Indochina "a great fraud."
In view of the favorable reaction throughout the
world, Rogers said, "I don't understand how the Soviet
Union has the courage to make that suggestion."
Although Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird also
expressed hope the Communists would agree to
"negotiate in good conscience," he didn't appear as
confident as Rogers.
Both officials referred to Nixon's proposal as fair
and forthright and said if offers the best chance for
peace.
Egypt Denounces Ceasefire
CAIRO — Egypt declared Sunday it would not extend
the Middle East cease-fire unless Israel returns to U.N.
peace talks and Israel repeated it would not take part
in the talks until Egypt withdraws missiles from the
truce zone.
The stand taken by the new government of Egypt's
acting president, Anwar Sadat, countered the hope in
many capitals that the three cease-fire signers—lsrael,
Egypt and Jordan—would continue to honor the
standdown despite the collapse of negotiations.
The U.S.-sponsored 90-day cease-fire is to expire
Nov. 5.

An aide to Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud
Riad said Egypt's opposition to an extension did not
mean "that on the fifth of November we are going to
start shooting." But he added if Israel does not return
to the negotiations that began last month under U.N.
special envoy Gunnar V. Jarring, the cease-fire is a
commitment "we want to liberate ourselves from.
That's all."
Israel walked out after only one session at U.N.
headquarters, in New York. The government of
Premier Golda Meir said its representative would not
return until Egypt removed Soviet antiaircraft missiles
which it claimed were placed in the Suez Canal truce
zone after the cease-fire went into effect Aug. 7.
Ransom Demands Rejected
MONTREAL — Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa
refused Sunday night the ransom demands of terrorist
kidnapers who hold a British diplomat and a provincial
government minister under threat of death. He pleaded
for negotiations.
Bourassa broadcast his announcement minutes
before the 10 p.m. EDT deadline set by the abductors
for the execution of Pierre Laporte, Quebec labor
minister, if their terms were not met.
There was no word on the fate of either Laporte or
the Briton, James Richard Cross. Cross was kidnaped
last Monday and Laporte on Saturday.
The premier said his government wanted to save the
two men's lives but could not agree to terms until there
were means of insuring their safety.
Rhodes Hits Agnew
WASHINGTON — The youngest member of the
President's Commission on Campus Unrest said Sunday
he believes Vice President Spiro T. Agnew wants to be
president and is beyond the control of President
Nixon.
"I think the President is not necessarily running the
vice president," Joseph Rhodes said.
He also expressed doubt about Nixon's ability to
put the harness on Agnew's frequent condemnations of
campus activists.

More Radical Bomb Threats
The nation's major airports beefed up security
arrangements Sunday, the first day of a week in which
the radical Weatherman has said it would begin a "fall
offensive."
In Chicano, an anonymous Weatherman author said
the underground group was attacking "all institutions
of American injustice and would seek to free "all
political prisoners" such as Black Panther leader Bobby
Seale and the Rev. Daniel Berrigan, a catholic priest
imprisoned in connection with the destruction of draft
records.
