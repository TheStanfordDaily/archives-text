# Sly and Family Stone Play To Full House

### DON LINDEMANN 
Sly was satisfied, the police were
pleased, the organizers were happy and
receipts were ample from almost 9,000
paying customers, insuring future rock
concerts on campus. But crowd
confusion and security problems at the
concert with Sly and the Family Stone
Friday night in Frost amphitheater
have dimmed prospects for a future
evening outdoor concert.
Sly will collect more than $17,500
for the ASSU-sponsored concert, a
financial success despite some 2,000
freeloaders in attendance.
The gates were opened to everyone
at 8 :30 p.m. following repeated charges
on the fence by a crowd variously
estimated from 75 to 300 persons.
However, most of those with tickets
were already seated by this time after
waiting in long lines for up to an hour.
Gates Opened
According to Mark Randolph, one
of the concert organizers, the gates
were opened for two reasons.
"First, if we hadn't, there would
have been sufficient disruption to stop
the concert and we didn't think that
would be fair to those who had paid,"

said Randolph. "Secondly, we didn't
want people to get hurt trying to climb
over the fence."
Adam Levin, member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, was pleased with
the concert but said, "I think it's
doubtful that we will ever have another
concert of this kind in Frost
Amphitheater." He emphasized that a
similar program could be held in a
facility with fewer security problems,
such as Maples Pavilion.
"I'd like to make it clear that
nobody ripped down any fence," said
Levin. He felt the problems were
handled smoothly by security forces,
which included 50 deputy sheriffs from
Santa Clara County and some 7 5
student police.
Levin said the Sheriff's department
"told us it was the best organized rock
concert they've ever policed."
Levin and Randolph both praised
Leo Bazile, former chairman of the
BSU, and the BSU for help in
marshalling and ushering. Levin added
that the student police, formed by
several fraternities, "performed
magnificently."
