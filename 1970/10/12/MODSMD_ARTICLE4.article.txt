# Stadium Scare
## Lyman Warns Crowd Of Bomb Threat 
### 
"Football is Amerika at its Fascist
worstâ€”it is the Circus Maximus of the
Amerikan Empire," began the scrawled
message found at the Greyhound Bus
Depot in San Francisco at midnight
Friday. The note carried the chilling
message that the "stadium will be
blasted if the game goes on" and was
signed "The Bomb Squad
(Weatherman)."
A second, identical note was found
in Palo Alto the same night, outlining
the possibilities for a bombing at the
Stadium quite unrelated to the arm of
Jim Plunkett. Written in the familiar
script of the Weathermen, the note
read:
"Jim Plunkett went to Vietnam last
summer on a tour sponsored by the
Defense Department and the NCAA to
help troop morale. We will move
against the USC-Stanford game to help
the people's morale!
Escape from Reality
"When the U.S. government is
slaughtering people at home and
abroad, we will not allow football
games to divert people's minds from
this reality. The stadium will be blasted
if the game goes on. The blood of those
killed will be on the hands of those
who felt football was so essential to the
survival of the Amerikan Empire that
I hey chose to play the game.
"Free Bobby, free Erika, and all
political prisoners."

The Bomb Squad (Weatherman)
The jolt of the bomb threat was first
felt by Bob Beyers, director of the
University News Service. A phone call
at midnight from the San Francisco
Chronicle alerted Beyers who then
called director of Security, Bruce
Wiggins and President Lyman.
By 1 :30 a.m. Saturday morning,
Lyman had issued a statpment on the
threat outlining the security
precautions that had been taken. Plans
were made to search the stadium at
dawn as well as those entering the game
with packages.
Previous to the bomb threat, the
number of police present at the game
was estimated at about 125 Santa Clara
Deputies and 30 campus police.
Early Saturday morning,
tremendous lines stood outside the
stadium as police examined lemonade
coolers, sandwich bags and thermos
bottles.
In addition, hundreds of copies of
the Chronicle article dealing with the
treat were distributed, and the public
address system advised those who
might "see an object near you that you
cannot account for or identify to
contact the nearest security official."
The announcement unearthed nothing
more than a few heckles.
Lyman Addresses Crowd
Shortly before game time. Lyman

addressed the crowd. "No one is able to
ignore such threats in view of the
events elsewhere in the country," he
said. "On the other hand, blackmail
and threats must not be allowed to
paralyze a nation or an institution. If it
ever becomes established that such
tactics can succeed, we shall have
magnified enormously the capacity of a
malicious few to terrorize society,"
Lyman added as the crowd cheered.
The President then said the
spectators in the stadium were showing
their determination not to allow
themselves to be intimidated by the
"malicious few." The University
however, was concerned about the way
in which those determined 90,000
would get out of the stadium if a bomb
was indeed found. Said Beyers, "We
were worried that if a device were
found, how we could handle the force
of the crowd."

Neither Beyers or Wiggins would
elaborate on a plan that would have
been used if a bomb had been found
during the course of the game. When
asked about any security measures that
were in the workings other than those
outlined by President Lyman, Wiggins
declared, "There is nothing particularly
more unique about one Saturday or
another, and there is nothing super that
goes on."
A Santa Clara Deputy conceded
that, "it would be easy for someone to
sneak in a bomb small enough to cause
considerable damage," but such
speculation was seemingly not
worrisome to the Stanford fans of any
age. When Stanford officials distributed
the Chronicle articles dealing with the
bomb threat, Beyers said, "Older
people refused to read them, and the
younger people tended to read them
with amusement."
