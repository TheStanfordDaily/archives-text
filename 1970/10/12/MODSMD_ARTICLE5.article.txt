## Illusory Power 
### 
As Congressional and state
elections draw near, the Corporate
Liberalsâ€”locally and nationally
are attempting to channel the
youth movement that exploded
into a nationwide "strike" last
Spring into electoral campaigns,
liie energy with which the
national elite and its media court
youth reveals the purpose of
American electoral politics today:
to create the illusion that people
have a say in their government.
In elementary school most of
us were taught that democracy
means "majority vote." Many of
us, despite our commitment to
social change, still cling to this
anachronism. We live in a very
complex society. Democracy, to
have substance, must mean direct
control over the institutions
which shape our destinies.
Obviously voting is one form
through which local control can
be exercised, but an electoral
process cannot be democratic as
long as ultimate power is
concentrated in the hands of a
few.
Power in America is
concentrated even to the point
where a feeling of powerlessness
has its own intertia. Periodically
politicians appear on the scene
offering us power through their
election, but whether the liberal
politicians win or lose, they offer
little threat to the status quo.
Alternative
There is an alternative. In
Europe it's called the
extra-parliamentary opposition. In
America it's usually called the
Movement. The organization of
people to seize direct local control
over their environment is a
revolutionary strategy, but it can
effect social change long before
revolution is feasible.
The most appealing thing
about this "syndicalist" strategy is
that political action is closely tied

to the individual's particular
condition. Instead of voting for a
candidate whose thirtieth
platform plank has a 13% better
position on federally-funded
education, a student can directly
challenge the social function of
his University. Similarly, workers
can agitate for better working
conditions by demanding control
over production, while even union
elections do not provide the
prospect of improvement.
Of course, workers' control
and student-teacher control are in
the distant future for America.
The Movement must educate
people about the structural basis
of their problems, must provide
the organizational forms for
action, and must eventually fight
to wrest control of institutions
from the elite which runs them at
present. The magnitude of the
task should not discourage us,
however, for at each step
conditions can improve.
Too Distant
Many people turn to electoral
politics because revolutionary
change seems so distant. I
contend, however, that
extra-parliamentary activity, in
addition to building towards
revolution, creates the conditions
which force immediate change.
The particular office-holder or
decision-maker is not so
important as the social conditions
that threaten the stability of the
class to which he must ultimately
be responsible.
Many revolutionaries, viewing
the co-optive manner in which the
powers-that-be react and reform
when faced with social pressure,
decry all syndicalist movements as
merely reformist. This analysis
does not consider the structural
nature of the reforms demanded.
Demands for change which do not
focus on control can be co-opted,
but the progressive transfer of
power to large numbers of people
leads to further demands for
democratic power.
The strategy has its
shortcomings, too. Conceivably
workers could control production
in their own interests, but hurt
consumers. Researchers could be
quite satisfied conducting studies
which permit and actually
encourage genocide. There is no
way to guarantee the prevention
of such difficulties, though there
is room to experiment. One
should observe, however, that
neither consumers nor Vietnamese
have influence under the current
system of social and political
organization.
Vietnam
The War in Southeast Asia
seems to be the most crucial issue
at this time. Locally war industry
is dominant. Stanford itself is the
heart of local war industry. The
primary task for the movement at
this point is to attack the service
local institutions give to the war
effort, and to demand control
over our work and study. The
priorities, as Corporate Liberal
(classical fascist) John Gardner
would say, of our universities and
industries must be reversed. The
change, however, must not come
from the Corporate Liberal elite.
It can only come when workers,
researchers, and students are
ready to demand control.
