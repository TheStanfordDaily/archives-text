## Vasoline Smeared 
### 
Dear Dr. Hip:
Now is the time for all good scholars to go back
to those "hallowed halls of academe". Many of us
are no longer afraid of tests, prof or studies—its
the clubs, Mace, and tear gas that scares the hell
out of us. How about a short course on
self-preservation?
What are the latest remedies for a cracked skull,
a Maced face, tear-gassed eyes or bird-shot
buttocks. Also, what about some hints on
protecting ourselves. Should I still be carrying
Vasoline in my lunch bag?
ANSWER: Head injuries should always be
evaluated by a physician. Even though no external
wound is evident, serious damage may result from
a club to the head. Danger signals are nausea,
vomiting, headache, dizzyness or blurred vision.
Gunshot wounds, of course, also require
immediate medical care.
The best treatment for Mace or tear gas is cool
tap water and fresh air. Leave the petroleum jelly
(Vasoline) out of your lunch bag. Rather than
protecting you, the jelly will trap tear gas particles.
Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
Is there any any health reason why I shouldn't
get a tattoo? Like might it encourage skin cancer?
Betty from the Bronx
ANSWER: A recent Rolling Stone article by
Amie Hill indicates the art of tattooing is enjoying
a renaissance, especially among women. Amie
threw herself into her work and now has a dainty
tattoo around one of her fingers. She says a crust
remains for one or two weeks and that it's best to
keep the area covered with Vasoline (an
übiquitous product). Amie maintains she only has
the finger tattoo but I've known girls with tattoos
on other parts of the body. One had a small blue
heart just medial to the anterior superior spine of

Eugene shoenfeld m.d.

the pelvis. She'd tattooed herself while in high
school.
There's no reason to believe tattoos lead to skin
cancer, but diseases like syphilis or infectious
hepatitis may be communicated unless the
tattooing needles are properly sterilized. The
tattoo parlor mentioned in Amie's article uses a
physician's office sterilizer for their needles.
Dear Dr. Scheonfeld:
Re: the girl with pelvic inflammatory disease
caused by gonorrhea. I wonder if you would refer
her to Jethro Kloos' book Back Top Eden, in
particular P. 429 , for herbal and water treatment
of the infection. It's certainly worth a try. There
are alternatives.
ANSWER: Unless someone shows me some
proof for these statements, beyond their appearing
in print and bound between fine leather
covers—l'm sticking to penicillin and other
antibiotics.
I do believe other alternatives are possible but
they either haven't been proven or yet discovered.
Dear Dr. Hip Pocrates:
I am going on a fast for 4-5 days at the end of
which I plan to drop some acid. Will there be any
added risks or more physiological problems
beyond those when taking acid when well
nourished? I am taking vitamins.
ANSWER: Even under the most favorable
circumstances an LSD experience is physically
wearing. A four or five day fast will leave you in a
weekened condition and physical harm might then
result from taking LSD.

of the infection. It's certainly worth a try. There
are alternatives.
ANSWER: Unless someone shows me some
proof for these statements, beyond their appearing
in print and bound between fine leather
covers—l'm sticking to penicillin and other
antibiotics.
I do believe other alternatives are possible but
they either haven't been proven or yet discovered.
Dear Dr. Hip Pocrates:
I am going on a fast for 4-5 days at the end of
which I plan to drop some acid. Will there be any
added risks or more physiological problems
beyond those when taking acid when well
nourished? I am taking vitamins.
ANSWER: Even under the most favorable
circumstances an LSD experience is physically
wearing. A four or five day fast will leave you in a
weekened condition and physical harm might then
result from taking LSD.

Dear Dr. Hip:
Now is the time for all good scholars to go back
to those "hallowed halls of academe". Many of us
are no longer afraid of tests, prof or studies—its
the clubs, Mace, and tear gas that scares the hell
out of us. How about a short course on
self-preservation?
What are the latest remedies for a cracked skull,
a Maced face, tear-gassed eyes or bird-shot
buttocks. Also, what about some hints on
protecting ourselves. Should I still be carrying
Vasoline in my lunch bag?
ANSWER: Head injuries should always be
evaluated by a physician. Even though no external
wound is evident, serious damage may result from
a club to the head. Danger signals are nausea,
vomiting, headache, dizzyness or blurred vision.
Gunshot wounds, of course, also require
immediate medical care.
The best treatment for Mace or tear gas is cool
tap water and fresh air. Leave the petroleum jelly
(Vasoline) out of your lunch bag. Rather than
protecting you, the jelly will trap tear gas particles.
Dear Dr. Schoenfeld:
Is there any any health reason why I shouldn't
get a tattoo? Like might it encourage skin cancer?
Betty from the Bronx
ANSWER: A recent Rolling Stone article by
Amie Hill indicates the art of tattooing is enjoying
a renaissance, especially among women. Amie
threw herself into her work and now has a dainty
tattoo around one of her fingers. She says a crust
remains for one or two weeks and that it's best to
keep the area covered with Vasoline (an
übiquitous product). Amie maintains she only has
the finger tattoo but I've known girls with tattoos
on other parts of the body. One had a small blue
heart just medial to the anterior superior spine of

Eugene shoenfeld m.d.

the pelvis. She'd tattooed herself while in high
school.
There's no reason to believe tattoos lead to skin
cancer, but diseases like syphilis or infectious
hepatitis may be communicated unless the
tattooing needles are properly sterilized. The
tattoo parlor mentioned in Amie's article uses a
physician's office sterilizer for their needles.
Dear Dr. Scheonfeld:
Re: the girl with pelvic inflammatory disease
caused by gonorrhea. I wonder if you would refer
her to Jethro Kloos' book Back Top Eden, in
particular P. 429 , for herbal and water treatment
of the infection. It's certainly worth a try. There
are alternatives.
