it's about . . . it's about to drive

Putting salt in beer, some say,

all salt can do is make it salty.
Because Bud is already just about
perfect.
So save the salt for the popcorn, please. We put heart, soul and our exclusive Beechwood
Ageing into Budweiser. All you need to enjoy it is a glass . . . or drink it right from the can,

Putting salt in beer, some say,

all salt can do is make it salty.
Because Bud is already just about
perfect.
