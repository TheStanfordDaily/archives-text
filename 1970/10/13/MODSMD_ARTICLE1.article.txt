# Draft Calls May End By Mid-1973; Nixon Affirms Troop Withdrawals
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The Pentagon yesterday ordered an
immediate start on all-out preparations
to end draft calls by mid-197 3 while
President Nixon announced that the
authorized ceiling on America troops in
Vietnam will be reduced by 4 0,000
men, bringing the troop level to
34 4,000 by the end of 1970.
Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird, who previously had set a 1973
target for ending reliance on the draft,
told reporters "we're going to go all out
in the Department of Defense to reach
the goal of a zero draft" in three years.
Special services counselor Mark
Edwards told the Daily that he feels the
draft announcement was made "with
an eye on the elections. Nixon is
already on record as being opposed to
the draft. There has been much talk in
Congress of ending the draft earlier,
such as just before the 1 97 2 elections.
Now I think the Pentagon is trying to
head off the draft repeal people, and I
think they are also trying to hedge on
Nixon's pledge to end the draft."
Visiting Professor Walter Oi, a
research director on Nixon's Gates
Commission on draft and manpower
needs, told the Daily "My
interpretation (of the draft
announcement) is simple. Up to this
date draft law has been extended for
four years; now that extension is
unacceptable to the country and to

Congress, and the Administration feels
that a two year extension is all they can
hope for. This is the correct view of the
political realities." Laird, when asked
whether the announcements were
aimed at helping Republicans in the
coming congressional elections, replied
with a smile, "I don't know how you
came to that conclusion."
The end to draft calls would not end
the draft system, which would continue
to operate in order to meet any
emergency manpower needs.
Law Expires
The present draft law expires in
June 1971, and according to Edward,
"there is a large minority in Congress
which opposed the continuation of the
draft system. However, the chances of
getting repeal now, while the Vietnam
War continues, are not too good.
"Hearings concerning the draft law
will begin about March of next year.
They will be abbreviated hearings
because the people in control are
working hand in glove with the
Department of Defense, who certainly
want to continue the draft," he said.
Presently bills exist in both houses
aimed at changing from the draft
system to a volunteer army. President
Nixon is also expected to ihis type of
introduce legislation early next year.
Spur Action
Laird made public a memorandum

to the service secretaries and Adm.
Thomas H. Moorer, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, to spur actions
"that should be taken now" to move
toward the zero draft goal.
In addition to stepped up emphasis
on military recruiting, other supports
may be required for additional
enlistments in both the active forces
and the reserve and National Guard
components, Laird's memorandum
said.
He requested top service officials to
review recommendations of a "Project
Volunteer Committee" within the
Pentagon for various ways to improve
the attractiveness of military careers.
And he asked his senior subordinates
to identify priority steps that will be
required to meet the zero draft
objective.
Early Action
With an eye toward Congress, Laird
said early Capitol Hill action is needed
on legislation to boost by 20 percent
the base pay for low-ranked enlisted
men.
On troop withdrawals from
Vietnam, Laird noted that the goal of
reaching 38 4,000 men by Oct. 15
already has been surpassed and that the
U.S. force level there will be "several
thousand below" that figure when Oct.
15 arrives.
The new troop cutback in Vietnam
apparently does not change Nixon's

goal, announced last spring, to cut U.S.
forces in the war zone by next May to
28 4,000 men, close to half the number
of Americans in Vietnam when the
present administration took office in
January, 1969.
Meet Ceiling
"We will meet or beat the 28 4,000
ceiling for May ILaird said.
The White House press secretary,
Ronald L. Ziegler, said the reduction
through Christmas was decided on as
Nixon and his advisers reviewed the
Indochina situation while preparing last
week's five-point peace proposal.
Nixon attributed the action in a
statement to "continued progress of
the Vietnamization program."
