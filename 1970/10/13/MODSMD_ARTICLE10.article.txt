## The 						Perpetual Crises 
### 
Barry wood

Earth Day (April 22) is now
several months behind us. The
press is quiet. Special ecology
issues of magazines have ceased
appearing. No one is upset by
DDT, internal combustion
engines, endangered species, or
defoliation warfare.
This, as I see it, is the situation
of the environmental movement
in the Autumn Quarter of 1 970.
The alarmists no longer predict

eco- catastrophe, and the
literature of ecology is relegated
to the back corner of the
bookstore.
Having spent the summer
driving some 10,0 0 0 miles across
this continent, I return convinced
that the world is still racing down
a twisted suicidal path into some
kind of oblivion. I say "some
kind" because I am not ready to
predict the death of the human
race. But there are many kinds of
death.
Summer
I spent this summer talking to
scores of people about the
environment, encountering only
three who had any significant
grasp of how bad things are. One
was a Canadian housewife who led
her community against the new
Standard Oil development near
Hamilton. The second was an old
friend who now works on
pollution control in the Canadian
government. The third started a
course on pollution last week'
from which point his real horror
dates.
A number of people will not
read this column, or any others I
may write, because the press is
silent on environment. I am stirring
up an issue which is out of style.
I am pushing a dead issue, like last
year's best seller.
Most crises rise to a pitch and
then subside. Like Cuba, Berlin,
Cambodia, The Middle East. But,
to lump environment with such
crises would be an error of the
worst kind.
Since E-day
Since Earth Day, 5 months
ago, the population of California
has increased by 15 0,000, that of
the U.S. by about one million,
and the world has added 45
million people— most of them
deprived and hungry.
Since Earth Day we have
buried 90 million tons of garbage,
dumped a shipload of lethal nerve
gas into the Atlantic, and
prepared to bury atomic wastes
with a radioactive half-life of
5 0,000 years in abandoned salt
mines.
We have left it up to the
government to police the
polluters, and are pleased with the
ban on DDT. Meanwhile, a dozen
more lethal pesticides are being
poured into the soil and are
collecting in our fat.
Since Earth Day 4 million cars
have rolled off the assembly lines,
and half a million acres have
disappeared under pavement.
Bills Die
The government of California
is enough to dispel our sweet
illusions. The Milias
Environmental Bill of Rights has
been killed by the Senate, along
with the Wilson Bill for Seacoast
Conservation and the Milias Bill
on Solid Waste.
The Sierra Club, it seems, is

about to lose the long battle over
Mineral King, which means a new
and wonderful Disneyland is
about to emerge in a National
Forest. Mountain View is
preparing to buy garbage from
San Francisco to fill in 5 4 4 acres
of marshland under the
euphemism of "Shoreling
Regional Park.'' The
"development" of Bay land is
justified by an appeal to our
creeping population statistics.
The California Water Plan,
which has been termed an
ecological disaster for the Bay
Area, is still going forward,
supported by Ronald
Reagan—who is from southern
California where the water will be
shipped. And the Tahoe Basin
Regional Planning Commission,
after a promisiong program for
the Nevada shore, has run into
severe difficulties over the
summer, which means that
thousands of acres of California
shore may be indiscriminatly
developed before ecologically
sound controls are established.
Environment is more than air,
land and water. There is, for
example, the virtually untouched
area of social ecology. What about
the deteriorating environment of
our cities? What about mental and
emotional diseases caused by the
paradoxical mixture of
overcrowding and urban
loneliness?
Mental Ecology
Or what about what might be
termed mental ecology—the
problem of providing a
satisfactory intellectual
environment in a world
increasingly regulated,
computerized, and manipulated?
Here again there is a physical
dimension—population pressures
on outmoded institutions. Too
many people leads to'
regimentation and
standardization.
Someone has suggested a
phrase: The Age of Perpetual
Crisis. More and more we are
entering that Age, and more and
more of our problems are
constellating themselves around
the relationship of Man to his
environment. We have walked on
the moon. We have brought back
a crippled capsule. But we cannot
manage Spaceship Earth.
We are out of step and out of
touch with our world—the real,
concrete world of nature—the
good brown earth, the living trees,
and the wild running things.
Nature is something trampled
beneath the feet of our armies,
something surviving just in front
of the bulldozer, something
slowly blackening in the smog or
dying in oil. We delude ourselves
if we think this world is anything
but a reflection of the state of our
own souls.

Earth Day (April 22) is now
several months behind us. The
press is quiet. Special ecology
issues of magazines have ceased
appearing. No one is upset by
DDT, internal combustion
engines, endangered species, or
defoliation warfare.
This, as I see it, is the situation
of the environmental movement
in the Autumn Quarter of 1 970.
The alarmists no longer predict

eco- catastrophe, and the
literature of ecology is relegated
to the back corner of the
bookstore.
Having spent the summer
driving some 10,0 0 0 miles across
this continent, I return convinced
that the world is still racing down
a twisted suicidal path into some
kind of oblivion. I say "some
kind" because I am not ready to
predict the death of the human
race. But there are many kinds of
death.
Summer
I spent this summer talking to
scores of people about the
environment, encountering only
three who had any significant
grasp of how bad things are. One
was a Canadian housewife who led
her community against the new
Standard Oil development near
Hamilton. The second was an old
friend who now works on
pollution control in the Canadian
government. The third started a
course on pollution last week'
from which point his real horror
dates.
A number of people will not
read this column, or any others I
may write, because the press is
silent on environment. I am stirring
up an issue which is out of style.
I am pushing a dead issue, like last
year's best seller.
Most crises rise to a pitch and
then subside. Like Cuba, Berlin,
Cambodia, The Middle East. But,
to lump environment with such
crises would be an error of the
worst kind.
Since E-day
Since Earth Day, 5 months
ago, the population of California
has increased by 15 0,000, that of
the U.S. by about one million,
and the world has added 45
million people— most of them
deprived and hungry.
Since Earth Day we have
buried 90 million tons of garbage,
dumped a shipload of lethal nerve
gas into the Atlantic, and
prepared to bury atomic wastes
with a radioactive half-life of
5 0,000 years in abandoned salt
mines.
We have left it up to the
government to police the
polluters, and are pleased with the
ban on DDT. Meanwhile, a dozen
more lethal pesticides are being
poured into the soil and are
collecting in our fat.
Since Earth Day 4 million cars
have rolled off the assembly lines,
and half a million acres have
disappeared under pavement.
Bills Die
The government of California
is enough to dispel our sweet
illusions. The Milias
Environmental Bill of Rights has
been killed by the Senate, along
with the Wilson Bill for Seacoast
Conservation and the Milias Bill
on Solid Waste.
The Sierra Club, it seems, is

about to lose the long battle over
Mineral King, which means a new
and wonderful Disneyland is
about to emerge in a National
Forest. Mountain View is
preparing to buy garbage from
San Francisco to fill in 5 4 4 acres
of marshland under the
euphemism of "Shoreling
Regional Park.'' The
"development" of Bay land is
justified by an appeal to our
creeping population statistics.
The California Water Plan,
which has been termed an
ecological disaster for the Bay
Area, is still going forward,
supported by Ronald
Reagan—who is from southern
California where the water will be
shipped. And the Tahoe Basin
Regional Planning Commission,
after a promisiong program for
the Nevada shore, has run into
severe difficulties over the
summer, which means that
thousands of acres of California
shore may be indiscriminatly
developed before ecologically
sound controls are established.
Environment is more than air,
land and water. There is, for
example, the virtually untouched
area of social ecology. What about
the deteriorating environment of
our cities? What about mental and
emotional diseases caused by the
paradoxical mixture of
overcrowding and urban
loneliness?
Mental Ecology
Or what about what might be
termed mental ecology—the
problem of providing a
satisfactory intellectual
environment in a world
increasingly regulated,
computerized, and manipulated?
Here again there is a physical
dimension—population pressures
on outmoded institutions. Too
many people leads to'
regimentation and
standardization.
Someone has suggested a
phrase: The Age of Perpetual
Crisis. More and more we are
entering that Age, and more and
more of our problems are
constellating themselves around
the relationship of Man to his
environment. We have walked on
the moon. We have brought back
a crippled capsule. But we cannot
manage Spaceship Earth.
We are out of step and out of
touch with our world—the real,
concrete world of nature—the
good brown earth, the living trees,
and the wild running things.
Nature is something trampled
beneath the feet of our armies,
something surviving just in front
of the bulldozer, something
slowly blackening in the smog or
dying in oil. We delude ourselves
if we think this world is anything
but a reflection of the state of our
own souls.

Earth Day (April 22) is now
several months behind us. The
press is quiet. Special ecology
issues of magazines have ceased
appearing. No one is upset by
DDT, internal combustion
engines, endangered species, or
defoliation warfare.
This, as I see it, is the situation
of the environmental movement
in the Autumn Quarter of 1 970.
The alarmists no longer predict

eco- catastrophe, and the
literature of ecology is relegated
to the back corner of the
bookstore.
Having spent the summer
driving some 10,0 0 0 miles across
this continent, I return convinced
that the world is still racing down
a twisted suicidal path into some
kind of oblivion. I say "some
kind" because I am not ready to
predict the death of the human
race. But there are many kinds of
death.
Summer
I spent this summer talking to
scores of people about the
environment, encountering only
three who had any significant
grasp of how bad things are. One
was a Canadian housewife who led
her community against the new
Standard Oil development near
Hamilton. The second was an old
friend who now works on
pollution control in the Canadian
government. The third started a
course on pollution last week'
from which point his real horror
dates.
A number of people will not
read this column, or any others I
may write, because the press is
silent on environment. I am stirring
up an issue which is out of style.
I am pushing a dead issue, like last
year's best seller.
Most crises rise to a pitch and
then subside. Like Cuba, Berlin,
Cambodia, The Middle East. But,
to lump environment with such
crises would be an error of the
worst kind.
Since E-day
Since Earth Day, 5 months
ago, the population of California
has increased by 15 0,000, that of
the U.S. by about one million,
and the world has added 45
million people— most of them
deprived and hungry.
Since Earth Day we have
buried 90 million tons of garbage,
dumped a shipload of lethal nerve
gas into the Atlantic, and
prepared to bury atomic wastes
with a radioactive half-life of
5 0,000 years in abandoned salt
mines.
We have left it up to the
government to police the
polluters, and are pleased with the
ban on DDT. Meanwhile, a dozen
more lethal pesticides are being
poured into the soil and are
collecting in our fat.
Since Earth Day 4 million cars
have rolled off the assembly lines,
and half a million acres have
disappeared under pavement.
Bills Die
The government of California
is enough to dispel our sweet
illusions. The Milias
Environmental Bill of Rights has
been killed by the Senate, along
with the Wilson Bill for Seacoast
Conservation and the Milias Bill
on Solid Waste.
The Sierra Club, it seems, is

about to lose the long battle over
Mineral King, which means a new
and wonderful Disneyland is
about to emerge in a National
Forest. Mountain View is
preparing to buy garbage from
San Francisco to fill in 5 4 4 acres
of marshland under the
euphemism of "Shoreling
Regional Park.'' The
"development" of Bay land is
justified by an appeal to our
creeping population statistics.
The California Water Plan,
which has been termed an
ecological disaster for the Bay
Area, is still going forward,
supported by Ronald
Reagan—who is from southern
California where the water will be
shipped. And the Tahoe Basin
Regional Planning Commission,
after a promisiong program for
the Nevada shore, has run into
severe difficulties over the
summer, which means that
thousands of acres of California
shore may be indiscriminatly
developed before ecologically
sound controls are established.
Environment is more than air,
land and water. There is, for
example, the virtually untouched
area of social ecology. What about
the deteriorating environment of
our cities? What about mental and
emotional diseases caused by the
paradoxical mixture of
overcrowding and urban
loneliness?
Mental Ecology
Or what about what might be
termed mental ecology—the
problem of providing a
satisfactory intellectual
environment in a world
increasingly regulated,
computerized, and manipulated?
Here again there is a physical
dimension—population pressures
on outmoded institutions. Too
many people leads to'
regimentation and
standardization.
Someone has suggested a
phrase: The Age of Perpetual
Crisis. More and more we are
entering that Age, and more and
more of our problems are
constellating themselves around
the relationship of Man to his
environment. We have walked on
the moon. We have brought back
a crippled capsule. But we cannot
manage Spaceship Earth.
We are out of step and out of
touch with our world—the real,
concrete world of nature—the
good brown earth, the living trees,
and the wild running things.
Nature is something trampled
beneath the feet of our armies,
something surviving just in front
of the bulldozer, something
slowly blackening in the smog or
dying in oil. We delude ourselves
if we think this world is anything
but a reflection of the state of our
own souls.
