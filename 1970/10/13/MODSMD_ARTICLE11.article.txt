# Film Festival Opens Next Week
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
The 14 th Annual San
Francisco International Film
Festival will begin next
Wednesday night with the
premiere of "The Great White
Hope" at the Palace of Fine Arts
Theatre.
In addition to the screening of
2 6 feature films, afternoon
programs have been arranged for
each of the thirteen days of the
festival. Included in the special
day-time presentations will be
parts one and two of the Russian
"War and Peace", a new directors
series, a Murnau retrospective, and
appearances by Paul Newman,
Martin Ritt, David Lean, Rosalind
Russell and Ratyajet Ray.
Tickets may be picked up in
advance at the Geary Theatre Box
Office, 415 Geary in San

Francisco, from 10 a.m. until 6
p.m. Monday through Saturday. If
you are interested in seeing any of
the programs, I advise you to get
your tickets now because I doubt
that any of them will be left the
day of the performances. The
schedule for the Film Festival will
be printed later this week in the
DAILY.
