** STUDENT CENTER **
Stanford students are learning
Bengali, doing anthropological
field work in Mexico, making a
study of municipal government,
researching the chemistry of
ceramic glazes, and studying
Satyagraha—the concept of
non-violence and the spirit. All of
these projects have recently
received academic credit at
Stanford through SCIRE, the
Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education.
Often ideas without students
come to SCIRE. Right now there
are opportunities to become
involved in a study of the San
Mateo Penal system or to initiate
a project in conjunction with the
Community Medicine
Department's health projects in
Livingston and Alviso, California.
In order to explain SCIRE'S
program in detail and to discuss
future group and individual
projects, a faculty and student
member of the Policy Board will
be eating dinner and speaking at
several of the residences this
week:

Tues., Larkcn, Stern, Prof. David
Abernethy and Dave DeWolf
Wed., Roble, Prof. Bob Madix and
Bob Jaffe
Thurs., Arroyo, Wilbur, Prof. Sid
Drell and Sue Block
BSU ****
The BSU will hold informal
informational talks starting
tonight around the dorms this
week. The purpose is to better
acquaint the general Stanford
community with the nature of the
BSU, its goals, programs, and a bit
of its history.
