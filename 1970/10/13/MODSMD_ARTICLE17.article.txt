Bombings Hit Rochester
ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Police blamed unnamed
conspirators for the predawn, rapid-fire dynamite
bombings of six buildings, including two
governmental structures Monday. The government
buildings were the fifth and sixth in the nation to be
bombed since last Thursday.
"We are working on the assumption that the
bombings were done by three separate groups
working together," Police Commissioner John A.
Mastrella said of the Rochester explosions.
He said the blasts, within 25 minutes of each other
in scattered sections of the city, indicated more than
one person was involved.
The explosions severly damaged a federal office
building, and the Monroe County office building.
Two churches with largely black memberships, a
grocery store and private home had less damage.
One man was slightly injured by flying glass.
There was no immediate connection made
between the home, the governmental buildings,
churches and grocery and why all six may have been
targets.
Except for Mastrella's statement, local police have
been cautious in laying blame for the bombings.
Both local and federal officials have refused to
speculate whether the radical Weatherman faction of
Students for a Democratic Society may have had a
hand in the bombings.
Professor Arrested
BROCKPORT, N.Y. — A speech professor was
arrested Monday after Brockport State College
received its third bomb threat in two days.
Dr. William H. Owens, 49, chairman of the
college's speech department, pleaded guilty in a town

court to aggravated harassment, a misdemeanor. Bail
was set at $2,000 for his sentencing Friday night.
State Police said they used a call-tracing device to
establish that the threat had been telephoned from
Owens' bachelor apartment.
Investigators said Owens gave them a statement
which listed "completely personal reasons" for
making the call. They declined to divulge the full
contents.
"We're satisfied this was a one-man thing," a State
Police spokesman said. "We found no connection
between the professor and dissident groups, either on
or off the campus."
Kidnappers Give Options
MONTREAL — Terrorist kidnapers holding as
hostages a British envoy and a Quebec cabinet
minister gave authorities three life-and-death options
Monday.
The federal government, fearing more political
abductions, moved troops into Ottawa to bolster
police security for officials and foreign diplomats.
The Canadian French separatists who seized the
two hostages last week gave provincial authorities
these choices:
—If all ransom demands are rejected, both British
Trade Commissioner James Richard Cross and
Quebec Labor Minister Pierre Laporte will be killed.
—If two demands are met the release of 23
"political prisoners" and a halt to the police
investigation-Cross will be freed but Laporte will still
be held under threat of death.
—If all demands are met both men will be released.
One of several communiques received from two
cells of the radical Quebec Liberation Front (FLQ)
said "we are setting no deadlines. However, if you
show evident bad faith, we will return to action."

Egypt Accuses US
CAIRO — Egypt accused the United States on
Monday of "armtwisting" to force Cairo's new
leaders to abandon the idea of continued warfare
against Israel. Premier Golda Meir said in Tel Aviv the
Israelis would be ready if Egypt decides to renew the
fighting.
The two countries have reached a standoff on
extension of the 90-day Suez Canal ceasefire beyond
the Nov. 5 expiration date. Egypt insists Israel rejoin
the United Nations peace talks. Israel demands a
pullback of Egyptian anti-aircraft missiles it and the
United States charge have been moved into the canal
standstill area.
Acting President Anwar Sadat of Egypt said the
United States has been putting pressure on Egypt's
leadership since the death of President Gamal Abdel
Nasser two weeks ago. But he added: "They must
know that exertion of any pressure upon Egypt only
reinforces its steadfastness."
As examples of a U.S. "armtwisting policy" to
force Egypt to give up liberation of Israeli-occupied
Egyptian territories or continued war against Israel,
state-owned Cairo radio cited "America's withdrawal
from Big Four talks, continuous supply of weapons
to Israel ... and reinforcement of the American 6 th
Fleet in the Mediterranean."
Canada Recognizes China
TOKYO — Canada is expected to announce
recognition of Communist China Tuesday, Japanese
news reports said Monday.
The reports, quoting Japanese government sources,
said Canada and Communist China reached agreement
to establish formal diplomatic relations. The reports
could not be confirmed immediately.

Two churches with largely black memberships, a
grocery store and private home had less damage.
One man was slightly injured by flying glass.
There was no immediate connection made
between the home, the governmental buildings,
churches and grocery and why all six may have been
targets.
Except for Mastrella's statement, local police have
been cautious in laying blame for the bombings.
Both local and federal officials have refused to
speculate whether the radical Weatherman faction of
Students for a Democratic Society may have had a
hand in the bombings.
Professor Arrested
BROCKPORT, N.Y. — A speech professor was
arrested Monday after Brockport State College
received its third bomb threat in two days.
Dr. William H. Owens, 49, chairman of the
college's speech department, pleaded guilty in a town

court to aggravated harassment, a misdemeanor. Bail
was set at $2,000 for his sentencing Friday night.
State Police said they used a call-tracing device to
establish that the threat had been telephoned from
Owens' bachelor apartment.
Investigators said Owens gave them a statement
which listed "completely personal reasons" for
making the call. They declined to divulge the full
contents.
"We're satisfied this was a one-man thing," a State
Police spokesman said. "We found no connection
between the professor and dissident groups, either on
or off the campus."
Kidnappers Give Options
MONTREAL — Terrorist kidnapers holding as
hostages a British envoy and a Quebec cabinet
minister gave authorities three life-and-death options
Monday.
The federal government, fearing more political
abductions, moved troops into Ottawa to bolster
police security for officials and foreign diplomats.
The Canadian French separatists who seized the
two hostages last week gave provincial authorities
these choices:
—If all ransom demands are rejected, both British
Trade Commissioner James Richard Cross and
Quebec Labor Minister Pierre Laporte will be killed.
—If two demands are met the release of 23
"political prisoners" and a halt to the police
investigation-Cross will be freed but Laporte will still
be held under threat of death.
—If all demands are met both men will be released.
One of several communiques received from two
cells of the radical Quebec Liberation Front (FLQ)
said "we are setting no deadlines. However, if you
show evident bad faith, we will return to action."

Egypt Accuses US
CAIRO — Egypt accused the United States on
Monday of "armtwisting" to force Cairo's new
leaders to abandon the idea of continued warfare
against Israel. Premier Golda Meir said in Tel Aviv the
Israelis would be ready if Egypt decides to renew the
fighting.
The two countries have reached a standoff on
extension of the 90-day Suez Canal ceasefire beyond
the Nov. 5 expiration date. Egypt insists Israel rejoin
the United Nations peace talks. Israel demands a
pullback of Egyptian anti-aircraft missiles it and the
United States charge have been moved into the canal
standstill area.
Acting President Anwar Sadat of Egypt said the
United States has been putting pressure on Egypt's
leadership since the death of President Gamal Abdel
Nasser two weeks ago. But he added: "They must
know that exertion of any pressure upon Egypt only
reinforces its steadfastness."
As examples of a U.S. "armtwisting policy" to
force Egypt to give up liberation of Israeli-occupied
Egyptian territories or continued war against Israel,
state-owned Cairo radio cited "America's withdrawal
from Big Four talks, continuous supply of weapons
to Israel ... and reinforcement of the American 6 th
Fleet in the Mediterranean."
Canada Recognizes China
TOKYO — Canada is expected to announce
recognition of Communist China Tuesday, Japanese
news reports said Monday.
The reports, quoting Japanese government sources,
said Canada and Communist China reached agreement
to establish formal diplomatic relations. The reports
could not be confirmed immediately.

Bombings Hit Rochester
ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Police blamed unnamed
conspirators for the predawn, rapid-fire dynamite
bombings of six buildings, including two
governmental structures Monday. The government

Dr. William H. Owens, 49, chairman of the
college's speech department, pleaded guilty in a town

court to aggravated harassment, a misdemeanor. Bail
was set at $2,000 for his sentencing Friday night.
State Police said they used a call-tracing device to
establish that the threat had been telephoned from
Owens' bachelor apartment.
Investigators said Owens gave them a statement
which listed "completely personal reasons" for
making the call. They declined to divulge the full
contents.
"We're satisfied this was a one-man thing," a State
Police spokesman said. "We found no connection
between the professor and dissident groups, either on
or off the campus."
Kidnappers Give Options
MONTREAL — Terrorist kidnapers holding as
hostages a British envoy and a Quebec cabinet
minister gave authorities three life-and-death options
Monday.
The federal government, fearing more political
abductions, moved troops into Ottawa to bolster
police security for officials and foreign diplomats.
The Canadian French separatists who seized the
two hostages last week gave provincial authorities
these choices:
—If all ransom demands are rejected, both British
Trade Commissioner James Richard Cross and
Quebec Labor Minister Pierre Laporte will be killed.
—If two demands are met the release of 23
"political prisoners" and a halt to the police
investigation-Cross will be freed but Laporte will still
be held under threat of death.
—If all demands are met both men will be released.
One of several communiques received from two
cells of the radical Quebec Liberation Front (FLQ)
said "we are setting no deadlines. However, if you
show evident bad faith, we will return to action."

Egypt Accuses US
CAIRO — Egypt accused the United States on
Monday of "armtwisting" to force Cairo's new
leaders to abandon the idea of continued warfare
against Israel. Premier Golda Meir said in Tel Aviv the
Israelis would be ready if Egypt decides to renew the
fighting.
The two countries have reached a standoff on
extension of the 90-day Suez Canal ceasefire beyond
the Nov. 5 expiration date. Egypt insists Israel rejoin
the United Nations peace talks. Israel demands a
pullback of Egyptian anti-aircraft missiles it and the
United States charge have been moved into the canal
standstill area.
Acting President Anwar Sadat of Egypt said the
United States has been putting pressure on Egypt's
leadership since the death of President Gamal Abdel
Nasser two weeks ago. But he added: "They must
know that exertion of any pressure upon Egypt only
reinforces its steadfastness."
As examples of a U.S. "armtwisting policy" to
force Egypt to give up liberation of Israeli-occupied
Egyptian territories or continued war against Israel,
state-owned Cairo radio cited "America's withdrawal
from Big Four talks, continuous supply of weapons
to Israel ... and reinforcement of the American 6 th
Fleet in the Mediterranean."
