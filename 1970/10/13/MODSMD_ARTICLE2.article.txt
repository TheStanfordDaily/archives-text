# SC Game Collection
## Can Recycling Efforts Succeed 
### ROBYN STICKNEY 
Fifty-thousand cans were collected;
that's 5,000 pounds of steel, tin and
aluminum or 1,000 cubic feet of
salvaged metal that didn't make it into
the Bay last weekend. It all happened
during the SC-Stanford game, when the
Stanford Conservation Group (SCG)
and Ecology Action mounted an
offensive drive of their own against
pollution aided by Stanford rooters.
Although the plea to save all
soft-drink cans for recycling reached
only 1 0,000 people at the game, one in
five (Including Jim Flunkett) carried
cans to boxes manned by enthusiastic
volunteers at each gate. After the game
about 100 people stayed to scour the
stands for over an hour, leaving the
stadium cleaner than after any game to
date.
Three times volunteer workers
loaded a truck (donated by Hertz) and
ran their cache to the M & T Chemical
Co., in South San Francisco, which will
turn the cans back into raw material for
industrial use. This processing saves
power at the rate of 5,000 kilo-watt
hours compared to the amount of
power necessary to process an equal
amount of raw steel.
But the aims of the conservation
effort were far greater than a day's haul
of salvaged metal. Piles of trash
