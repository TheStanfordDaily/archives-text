# Harvey Hukari Reviews Turmoil
## 
### ED KOHN 
His hair is a little shorter now, and
combed off to one side; his pants,
though still bell-bottomed, are solid,
not striped; and his gestures seem more
measured. But the bearing, and the
political stance, and the flowing, if
acerbic, wit have not changed under the
standards of regular employment.
Harvey H. Hukari Jr., one of the
University's most outspoken
conservative graduates, is alive and well,
and working as a reporter for
KQED-TV's "Newsroom," an hour-long
news dialogue aired five nights a week
at 7 p.m.
Vilified
During his three years as a student
here Hukari was perhaps one of the
most vilified personalities on campus.
He was subject to frequent abuse from
all points on the political spectrum, and
his group's headquarters, the Free
Market, was firebombed last year.
Despite the animosity for him on
campus, Hukari was responsible for
building up "the best large-college
chapter of the YAF (Young Americans
for Freedom) in the country." And last
November, at the chapter's height of
recognition, he led a dramatii
membership-card burning at the
Tresidder Union press conference to
protest many YAF's longstanding
"traditionalist" policies.

Immediately following their
withdrawal from the national YAF,
Hukari and his followers formed the
Free Campus Movement (FCM). He has
since been denounced by the national
YAF organization and by many of its
40,000 members for his "libertarian"
tendencies. Now, in his absence, the
organization continued to flourish,
publishing a weekly newspaper, the

"One of the things that I have become more firmly convinced of is that
much of the disorder we have experienced over the past couple of
years. . . is such a tremendous and enormous waste of both facilities and
money that could be used for educational improvements. It's just
incredible to think about it in perspective of being outside the Stanford
community now . . .
"When you think of all those broken windows and the time and money
spent, I become more sympathetic with the people who have become
distrustful of the University and don't want to contribute money to it.
They see this as a waste and some kind of perversion of the academic
mission of the University where it is no longer a place of ideas and
dialogue but becomes a kind of battleground for this one quarter of the
year. . .
"That's sad, and it makes me sadder now that I'm away from
it.. . (Spring Quarter) is kind of a futile exercise. "

Arena, holding meetings, and planning
a series of seminars on conservative
thought.
Sitting and talking quietly in the

strangely informal KQED news studios,
Hukari voiced alarm about the
University's ability to govern itself in
the wake of continuous "outside"
interference:
"The University is being attacked
from the outside," he said. "I see it
being attacked not so much from the
right or the alumni as much as by
people outside the Stanford

community who may at one time have
been connected with it — former
students, Free University, Pacific
Studies Center, Bay Area
Revolutionary Union people. These are
the people who are attacking the right
and ability of the University to govern
itself."
Hukari expressed strong support for
President Lyman before he was
appointed and reiterated his support
for Lyman's policies during a recent
interview with the Daily:
Unite All Elements
"I think the way to reduce campus
disorders, and maybe Lyman can, is to
unite all elements of the community,
regardless of their different political
predilections. I don't think it's a
difficult task once you point out that
the liberals, conservatives, moderates
students, the non-political students'
rights are very much threatened by the
radical challenge from the outside.
"It weakens the ability of the
University to make the necessary
changes, it weakens it financially, and it

weakens it as far as the outside
community is concerned."
Lyman, he said, "has a good
approach in the sense that he's very
much in the liberal academic tradition,
and I think he can be respected for
that.
"At the same time, he can also stand
up and articulate his viewpoint very
forcefully and with a great deal of
effectiveness to counteract a great
many of these radical arguments and
charges from the Left."
'New Barbarians'
Hukari, who covered some of the
summer disturbances in Palo Alto for
KQED, denounced "the new barbarians
from the Left" who, he said,
"attempted to destroy Palo Alto much
as they did Stanford."
Besides covering some of the Palo
Alto disturbances, Hukari says he is
attempting to "cover Middle America."
He has not been able to spend much
time at this, however, since he has
mostly been assigned to general stories.
One of his articles concerning a
surplus of prunes on the market,
opened with this lead sentence:
"Prunes are back in the news again."
Hukari reports that one of the other
newsmen immediately stopped him and
tongue in cheek asked, "When were
prunes last in the news?"
Hukari has remained politically
active since beginning work for KQED.
Presently he is working as a campaign
volunteer for a black youth worker
running for the California State
Assembly from a district in San
Francisco. He aLso continues to
contribute to "Human Events," a
national weekly conservative
newspaper.
Adds Balance
He says KQED hired him for two
reasons. First, he said, they needed a
young newsman. And they felt they
needed someone with a conservative
viewpoint, someone who could add
balance to the program, which, he
pointed out, has a definite "liberal
slant."
Hukari says that all of the newsmen
appearing on the show with him are
liberal Democrats. However, he said
with some relief that some of the
station employees not seen on the air,
such as the engineers, are Republicans.
