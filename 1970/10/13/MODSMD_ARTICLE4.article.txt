# ASSU Senate Elections Tomorrow; 40 Representatives To Be Elected
## 
### NICHOLAS DUNGAN 
With the ASSU Student Senate
elections beginning tomorrow, several
slates have surfaced from the long list
of more than 120 candidates.
The Daily has learned of at least five
slates sponsored by the Coalition for a
Reasonable Senate, the Arena, a
so-called Polish Student Union,
Students for Senate Innovation, and a
large, untitled left-of-center slate.
The 40-member Student Senate will
be made up of graduate and
undergraduate students in numbers
proportional to their size and academic
field. 20 seats will be divided among six
graduate divisions, and the other 20
among three undergraduate groupings.
The Senate's function is to divide
student fees among campus
organizations. Last year the Senate had
a budget of $4 0,000.
The slate-backed candidates
represent roughly half of the students
running, and the rest at this moment
are running singly. Some candidates are
on two slates. Last year a BSU slate
made a strong showing and turned out
to be the largest voting bloc in the
Senate.
The Coalition for a Reasonable
Senate, consisting of Young
Republicans and moderate Democrats,
is running a six man slate: Don Ayer,
Roman Buhler, John Grant, Tom Rees,
Dean Swartz, and Bob Thompson.
The President of the Polish Student
Union, Peter Antoniak, is running with
three other students from graduate
engineering who represent a
"moderate" view—John Delaney,
William Hudson, and Ellen Mayliew.
The Arena will endorse a list of 1 7
candidates in tomorrow's edition of the
paper. Their candidates include: Steven
Guerra, Chris Mocker, Buzz Thompson,
Harries Clichy Peterson, Jr., William
Bell, Rick Peral, Hall Daily, Robert
I/evine, Richard Ilka, Rexford Stark,
Raymond White, Peter Antoniak, Noel
Casey, and Tom Mahon.

Another candidate slate calling itself
the Students for Senate Innovation will
sponsor Buzz Thompson, William Bell,
Dan Furniss, and Ann Vanderstoep.
The final slate at this time is the
largest group and is made up of several
BSU, Asian American, Radical Caucus,
International Association,
"Independent" and one Chicano
candidate. The forty-six candidates are
as follows:
Spyros Cavouniois, Olivier Koenig, John
Schaefer, Tony Reid, Yale Braunstein, Mel
Hendrix, Gilles Kahn, Reginald McGhee,
Bennett Robinson, Maurice Schlumberger,
Mark Weiss, Daniel Bendor, Timothy
Coburn, Arthur Wilson, Owen Blank,
Anthony Rogers, Michael Caramanis, Kermit
Lucas, Geraldine Foote, Mike Holman, James
Jefferson, Douglas McHenry, Jimmy
Richardson, Robert Wilson, Sharon Winslow,
John Winesberry, Isabel Alegria, Jim Baer,

Fogel, Gayle Hanlon, Channing Johnson,
Donald Lee, Nelson Nagai, Allan Sibley,
John Shoch, Lew Soffer, David Steiner,
Richard Strubbe, Mark Venezia, Chris

School Lounge. Two additional polling

may vote for only candidates running
in this area. A voter should rank his
candidate according to preference.
Graduates in engineering and earth
sciences will have six seats, graduates in
humanities and sciences will also have
six seats, graduates in medicine and
others unaffliated will have two, and
graduates in law, business, and
education will have two each.
Undergraduates in engineering and
earth sciences will have two seats,

With the ASSU Student Senate
elections beginning tomorrow, several
slates have surfaced from the long list
of more than 120 candidates.
The Daily has learned of at least five
slates sponsored by the Coalition for a
Reasonable Senate, the Arena, a
so-called Polish Student Union,
Students for Senate Innovation, and a
large, untitled left-of-center slate.
The 40-member Student Senate will
be made up of graduate and
undergraduate students in numbers
proportional to their size and academic
field. 20 seats will be divided among six
graduate divisions, and the other 20
among three undergraduate groupings.
The Senate's function is to divide
student fees among campus
organizations. Last year the Senate had
a budget of $4 0,000.
The slate-backed candidates
represent roughly half of the students
running, and the rest at this moment
are running singly. Some candidates are
on two slates. Last year a BSU slate
made a strong showing and turned out
to be the largest voting bloc in the
Senate.
The Coalition for a Reasonable
Senate, consisting of Young
Republicans and moderate Democrats,
is running a six man slate: Don Ayer,
Roman Buhler, John Grant, Tom Rees,
Dean Swartz, and Bob Thompson.
The President of the Polish Student
Union, Peter Antoniak, is running with
three other students from graduate
engineering who represent a
"moderate" view—John Delaney,
William Hudson, and Ellen Mayliew.
The Arena will endorse a list of 1 7
candidates in tomorrow's edition of the
paper. Their candidates include: Steven
Guerra, Chris Mocker, Buzz Thompson,
Harries Clichy Peterson, Jr., William
Bell, Rick Peral, Hall Daily, Robert
I/evine, Richard Ilka, Rexford Stark,
Raymond White, Peter Antoniak, Noel
Casey, and Tom Mahon.

Another candidate slate calling itself
the Students for Senate Innovation will
sponsor Buzz Thompson, William Bell,
Dan Furniss, and Ann Vanderstoep.
The final slate at this time is the
largest group and is made up of several
BSU, Asian American, Radical Caucus,
International Association,
"Independent" and one Chicano
candidate. The forty-six candidates are
as follows:
Spyros Cavouniois, Olivier Koenig, John
Schaefer, Tony Reid, Yale Braunstein, Mel
Hendrix, Gilles Kahn, Reginald McGhee,
Bennett Robinson, Maurice Schlumberger,
Mark Weiss, Daniel Bendor, Timothy
Coburn, Arthur Wilson, Owen Blank,
