# Today In The ‘Daily’

### 
Shirley Temple (Black) is apparently celebrating today for its the
twenty-first anniversary of her filing for divorce from John Agar.
Miss Temple is quoted as having said at the time "We have both tried
hard, we really did. But it just didn't work. ' Dare to struggle . .
Call our news office at 321-2300 x 4632 with reports of
disengagement (such as the U.S., from Indochina.) Call our business
office to place any of those legal notices necessary for your next
divorce.
Hungry Daily staffers may feast today at noon in the office.
