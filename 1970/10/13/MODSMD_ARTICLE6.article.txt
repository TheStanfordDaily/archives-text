## Fable For Our Time 
### 
Jeff blum

Once upon a time there was a
girl named Little Red Trashing
Hood who lived on the edge of a
large dark Eucalyptus forest. One
day while tripping through the
forest, Red Trashing Hood
decided to go visit her
grandmother who lived in a lively
white house on the other side of
the forest.
Red Trashing Hood had been
trying to figure out a way to end

the violence of the Vietnamese,
Laotian and Cambodian Wars, and
she thought that Grandma might
be able to help.
When Little Red Trashing
Hood arrived at her grandmother's
house she found Grandma in bed
with the Department of Defense.
Grandma was startled by her
arrival and exclaimed, "Why Little
Red Trashing Hood, what are you
doing here?" Red Trashing Hood
replied, "I just came to visit you.
What's that five-sided think you're
holding?" Grandma looked down
embarrassingly at the Pentagon
which had been ejaculating funds
into her operating budget. "It's
nothing dear."
Red Trashing Hood felt a little
nervous at this point so she
decided to change the topic.
"What have you been doing lately
besides using make up?" Grandma
replied, "Oh, just the things I
usually do. I've been busy
defending the academic freedom
and integrity of the forest. There
are those who would like to cut it
down and use it for their own
political purposes, you know."
Red Trashing Hood agreed that
would be bad and suggested,
"Why don't we make a firm rule
that no one can cut down a single
tree."
"The Board of Lumberjacks
would never accept that, and we
certainly can't afford to alienate
them," came Grandma's reply.
What Big ...
At that point Red Trashing
Hood noticed that the lights in
the room were very bright. She
told her grandmother this, and
Grandma added, "Not only have I
improved the lighting inside the
house, but I have mounted bright
lights throughout the forest." Red
TYashing Hood, remembering that
she had seen some of these on the
way over, exclaimed, "Grandma,
what big floodlights you have!"
"The better to see you with,
my dear." Then Red Trashing
Hood saw the walls which were

covered with hundreds of
photographs, each of which was a
picture of herself. "Grandma,
what a big batch of photographs
you have!"
"The better to remember you
with, my dear." By now Grandma
was beginning to lick her chops
and Red Trashing Hood was
feeling quite upset. She walked
into the laboratory to see if there
were still more pictures of her,
and there she found .. . radar
jammers, bomber planes, infra-red
detectors, tear gas grenades and a
whole host of other weapons.
Almost in tears she ran back into
the bedroom and exclaimed,
"Grandma, what big war research
you have!" Grandma lunged off
the bed and shrieked, "The better
to destroy you with my dear!"
She ripped off her disguise, and
there stood naked the despicable
wolf, Richard W. Lyman.
Little Red Trashing Hood
threw up her arms in dismay and
ran out the door with the wolf
chasing closely behind her.
Fortunately a group of friendly
Indians were nearby at the time,
and they rescued Red Trashing
Hood by using an axe to cut short
the wolf's tenure as president.
Little Red Trashing Hood was safe
for the time being.
But the story does not end
happily ever after. The deposed
wolf was soon replaced with
another just like him, and the real
Grandma was never found.
Eventually it was learned that
Grandma had never really existed
at all. She was merely a myth that
concealed the fact that the lovely
white house on the other side of
the forest had always been
occupied by a succession of
wolves, each one like the others
before him.
The moral of the story is ALL
PIGS ARE WOLVES EVEN
WHEN THEY APPEAR IN
GRANDMOTHERS' CLOTHING.

Once upon a time there was a
girl named Little Red Trashing
Hood who lived on the edge of a
large dark Eucalyptus forest. One
day while tripping through the
forest, Red Trashing Hood
decided to go visit her
grandmother who lived in a lively
white house on the other side of
the forest.
Red Trashing Hood had been
trying to figure out a way to end

the violence of the Vietnamese,
Laotian and Cambodian Wars, and
she thought that Grandma might
be able to help.
When Little Red Trashing
Hood arrived at her grandmother's
house she found Grandma in bed
with the Department of Defense.
Grandma was startled by her
arrival and exclaimed, "Why Little
Red Trashing Hood, what are you
doing here?" Red Trashing Hood
replied, "I just came to visit you.
What's that five-sided think you're
holding?" Grandma looked down
embarrassingly at the Pentagon
which had been ejaculating funds
into her operating budget. "It's
nothing dear."
Red Trashing Hood felt a little
nervous at this point so she
decided to change the topic.
"What have you been doing lately
besides using make up?" Grandma
replied, "Oh, just the things I
usually do. I've been busy
defending the academic freedom
and integrity of the forest. There
are those who would like to cut it
down and use it for their own
political purposes, you know."
Red Trashing Hood agreed that
would be bad and suggested,
"Why don't we make a firm rule
that no one can cut down a single
tree."
"The Board of Lumberjacks
would never accept that, and we
certainly can't afford to alienate
them," came Grandma's reply.
What Big ...
At that point Red Trashing
Hood noticed that the lights in
the room were very bright. She
told her grandmother this, and
Grandma added, "Not only have I
improved the lighting inside the
house, but I have mounted bright
lights throughout the forest." Red
TYashing Hood, remembering that
she had seen some of these on the
way over, exclaimed, "Grandma,
what big floodlights you have!"
"The better to see you with,
my dear." Then Red Trashing
Hood saw the walls which were

covered with hundreds of
photographs, each of which was a
picture of herself. "Grandma,
what a big batch of photographs
you have!"
"The better to remember you
with, my dear." By now Grandma
was beginning to lick her chops
and Red Trashing Hood was
feeling quite upset. She walked
into the laboratory to see if there
were still more pictures of her,
and there she found .. . radar
jammers, bomber planes, infra-red
detectors, tear gas grenades and a
whole host of other weapons.
Almost in tears she ran back into
the bedroom and exclaimed,
"Grandma, what big war research
you have!" Grandma lunged off
the bed and shrieked, "The better
to destroy you with my dear!"
She ripped off her disguise, and
there stood naked the despicable
wolf, Richard W. Lyman.
Little Red Trashing Hood
threw up her arms in dismay and
ran out the door with the wolf
chasing closely behind her.
Fortunately a group of friendly
Indians were nearby at the time,
and they rescued Red Trashing
Hood by using an axe to cut short
the wolf's tenure as president.
