WASHINGTON - For the last
five months Curtis Tarr, the new
director of the Selective Service
system, has been engineering a
full-scale drive to convert the
image of the draft machine from
one of the inept, unfair,
discriminatory bureaucracy it was
under Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, to
an efficient, modern, benevolent
agency which is seeking to meet
the needs of the military while
being as fair to everybody as it
possibly can.
The image is a good one, with a
face-lifting on every level. The
new image doesn't change the fact
that the Selective Service System
is in the business of deciding
which young lads are going to
become cannon-fodder or
pencil-pushers for the armed
forces.
Respect for Rulings
But Tarr has eliminated the
most obvious and blatant
inequities and rhetoric that used
to anger liberals about Gen.
Hershey's operation.
One area in which this is
especially clear is the respect
which the new director has shown
for the unfavorable rulings
recently handed down against the
Selective Service System by the
Supreme Court. In June, when the
Supreme Court ruled that
conscientious objectors need not
base their claims of religious
grounds, Tarr swiftly responded
by drafting the first interpretation
of the law and regulations ever
done by the Selective Service

System, embodying the spirit, and
indeed, in several instances, the
actual words of the Supreme
Court decision.
In contrast, when, in 1 965 , the
high court ruled that church
membership and belief in a
Supreme Being were not
prerequisites for CO status, Cen.
Hershey's only response was to
issue, unexplained, three years
later, a new version of the CO
form which eliminated references
to church membership and belief
in a Supreme Being.
Liberal and Modern
The system's new "liberal and
modern" image is also reflected
by changes which have been made
in the system's house organ,
Selective Service News. Gen.
Hershey's amusing but grisly front
page, right wing editorials have
been eliminated and the news has

taken on a totally new look. The
format has changed from an
old-fashioned, four-column
letterpress job to a more fluid
three-column offset format,
printed in dark blue ink on pastel
blue paper. Tarr has moved his
column to the inside pages, and
the copy has lost its humorous
nature. The News used to be
packed with wonderful trivialties
which read like a Ripley's Believe
It Or Not for the war machine.
This fascinating copy has been
dropped, and the News now
concentrates on hard news about
the functioning of this system.
Tarr also makes sure that the
articles mention recent court
decisions which have come down
against the system whenever they
are relevant, another innovation
for the News.
Tarr's response to the Supreme
Court's action in January, which
eliminated punitive induction of
violators of draft rules, became
clear in late June, when the
Selective Service regulations were
amended to allow induction of
men whose numbers had been
reached but who had failed to
report to a Pre-induction physical
when ordered to.
Confronted with the large
number of men who fail to report
to physicals, and the unwillingness
of the Justice Department to
prosecute these men for violation
of the draft law, Tarr amended
the regulations in such a way that
serious resistors could be weeded
out from procrastinators and men
who are not certain that they are
willing to face prison.
While the new Supreme Court
ruling and Tarr's guidelines for
judging CO cases have doubled the
number of new alternative service
registrants per month over the
summer and have caused several
draft board members to resign,
the overall effect of these actions
on the efficient functioning of the
system has been nil. Less than one
percent of the current registrant
pool is involved in the issue of
conscientious objection.

discriminatory bureaucracy it was
under Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, to
an efficient, modern, benevolent
agency which is seeking to meet
the needs of the military while
being as fair to everybody as it
possibly can.
The image is a good one, with a
face-lifting on every level. The
new image doesn't change the fact
that the Selective Service System
is in the business of deciding
which young lads are going to
become cannon-fodder or
pencil-pushers for the armed
forces.
Respect for Rulings
But Tarr has eliminated the
most obvious and blatant
inequities and rhetoric that used
to anger liberals about Gen.
Hershey's operation.
One area in which this is
especially clear is the respect
which the new director has shown
for the unfavorable rulings
recently handed down against the
Selective Service System by the
Supreme Court. In June, when the
Supreme Court ruled that
conscientious objectors need not
base their claims of religious
grounds, Tarr swiftly responded
by drafting the first interpretation
of the law and regulations ever
done by the Selective Service

System, embodying the spirit, and
indeed, in several instances, the
actual words of the Supreme
Court decision.
In contrast, when, in 1 965 , the
high court ruled that church
membership and belief in a
Supreme Being were not
prerequisites for CO status, Cen.
Hershey's only response was to
issue, unexplained, three years
later, a new version of the CO
form which eliminated references
to church membership and belief
in a Supreme Being.
Liberal and Modern
The system's new "liberal and
modern" image is also reflected
by changes which have been made
in the system's house organ,
Selective Service News. Gen.
Hershey's amusing but grisly front
page, right wing editorials have
been eliminated and the news has

taken on a totally new look. The
format has changed from an
old-fashioned, four-column
letterpress job to a more fluid
three-column offset format,
printed in dark blue ink on pastel
blue paper. Tarr has moved his
column to the inside pages, and
the copy has lost its humorous
nature. The News used to be
packed with wonderful trivialties
which read like a Ripley's Believe
It Or Not for the war machine.
This fascinating copy has been
dropped, and the News now
concentrates on hard news about
the functioning of this system.
Tarr also makes sure that the
articles mention recent court
decisions which have come down
against the system whenever they
are relevant, another innovation
for the News.
Tarr's response to the Supreme
Court's action in January, which
eliminated punitive induction of
violators of draft rules, became
clear in late June, when the
Selective Service regulations were
amended to allow induction of
men whose numbers had been
reached but who had failed to
report to a Pre-induction physical
when ordered to.
Confronted with the large
number of men who fail to report
to physicals, and the unwillingness
of the Justice Department to
prosecute these men for violation
of the draft law, Tarr amended
the regulations in such a way that
serious resistors could be weeded
out from procrastinators and men
who are not certain that they are
willing to face prison.
While the new Supreme Court
ruling and Tarr's guidelines for
judging CO cases have doubled the
number of new alternative service
registrants per month over the
summer and have caused several
draft board members to resign,
the overall effect of these actions
on the efficient functioning of the
system has been nil. Less than one
percent of the current registrant
pool is involved in the issue of
conscientious objection.
