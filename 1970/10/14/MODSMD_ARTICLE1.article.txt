# Explosion Damages Harvard Study Center
## 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A bomb
exploded early this morning in Harvard
University's Center for International
Affairs, which houses a Ford
Foundation-funded research operation,
the Development Advisory Service.
There were no immediate reports of
injuries.
„taff members of the Harvard
Crimson, the student newspaper, said
the bomb went off in the basement of
the building. They reported extensive
damage to the interior area near the
bomb, including shredded concrete,
bent steel rods, and a demolished
ceiling. A number of windows were also
blown out by the blast.
University officials could not
immediately estimate the cost of
repairs.
One Crimson reporter said police
were notified about 12:30 a.m. that a
bomb was set to explode. The reporter
said Harvard police went to the center
and got at least one person out of the
building before the blast. A Cambridge
police lieutenant declined to verify the
report.
The October issue of "Ramparts"
magazine and recent articles in the
Crimson strongly criticized the
Development Advisory Service,
charging it with manipulating political
institutions in developing nations.
A year ago, members of the
Weatherman faction of Students for a
Democratic Society entered the
building, attacked several staff
members and scrawled slogans on the
walls.
David Ransom, the author of the
October "Ramparts" article explained
his criticism of Development Advisory
Service when contacted by the Daily
early this morning.
The Stanford M.A. described the
branch of the study center as "an
essentially elitist group of trained

American technocrats that makes
policy in the Third World Countries.
"Its allegiance is to its patrons, tht
big businessmen who direct the Ford
Foundation," he added. "These are the
men that stand behind American
puppets in Third World countries from
Liberia to Indonesia."
Asked whether he thought this
morning's bombings were
"constructive," Ransom replied: "If
people feel that the U.S. would be best
out of Vietnam, then consistent with
that would be a position that the
Development Advisory Service would
be best out of Indonesia."

Weatherman faction of Students for a
Democratic Society entered the
building, attacked several staff
members and scrawled slogans on the
walls.
David Ransom, the author of the
October "Ramparts" article explained
his criticism of Development Advisory
Service when contacted by the Daily
early this morning.
The Stanford M.A. described the
branch of the study center as "an
essentially elitist group of trained

American technocrats that makes
policy in the Third World Countries.
"Its allegiance is to its patrons, tht
big businessmen who direct the Ford
Foundation," he added. "These are the
men that stand behind American
puppets in Third World countries from
Liberia to Indonesia."
Asked whether he thought this
morning's bombings were
"constructive," Ransom replied: "If
people feel that the U.S. would be best
out of Vietnam, then consistent with
that would be a position that the
Development Advisory Service would
be best out of Indonesia."
