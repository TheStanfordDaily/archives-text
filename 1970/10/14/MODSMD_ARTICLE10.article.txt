# Election Corrections
## 
### 
Ellen Mayhew, Bill Hudson,
and John Delaney are not
affiliated with Peter Antoniak
of the Polish Student Union.
The Daily was led to believe
that the students were
members of a slate as reported
in yesterday's paper. The three
are running on an independent
moderate ticket.
The Daily also omitted
three names from the group of
17 candidates the Arena is
endorsing. These are: Ernesto
Rael, Mark Venezia, and

Archie Schrotenboer.
The list of candidates for
the Senate printed in Monday's
issue has been updated by
elections commissioner Chris
Banks to include: Lou Soffer,
Anthony Reid, and Barry
Whitesides, all undergraduates
in humanities and sciences.
Voting will take place today
and tomorrow from 8 :45 a.m.
to 4:15 p.m. at five places on
campus. Students may vote for
only candidates running for
Senate in his specific area.
