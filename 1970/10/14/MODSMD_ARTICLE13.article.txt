# Machiavelli, Aestheticism In Florence
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
About half an hour outside of
Florence on Old Siena Road
stands the house where Niccolo
Machiavelli lived and wrote when
the return of the Medici to power
had exiled him from his native
Florence.
Probably more important for
Stanford students is that right
across the road from Niccolo's old
house stands an inn which serves
some of the best wine and food
and more wine in the Florentine
area. It is probably true that the
place is supported by Stanford
students and many consider it
their second home in Florence â€”
second that is to Villa San Paolo
where Stanford-in-Italy is located.
I bring up Machiavelli's house

and the inn across the street not
only because it is usually an
essential part of the Florentine
experiences and hangovers of
Stanford-in-Italy students, but
more because it illustrates
something very fundamental
about the nature of Florentine
experience. Even when you try to
do something as totally
non-intellectual and unaesthetic as
getting drunk, it is impossible to
separate yourself from some
element of the rich culture of the
Florentine Renaissance.
Dr. Guelfo Frulla, Director of
Studies at "the Villa," said at our
farewell banquet, "What we have
tried to cultivate at the Villa is an
aesthetic approach to life."
It is this purpose of "the Viila"

which I believe leads both to most
of its satisfactions and
dissatisfactions.
Florence A Museum
For the Stanford student
Florence is not a city but a very
large and densely populated
museum. For this reason, perhaps
one of the most gratifying
sensations, after having lived and
studied in Florence for six months
is to feel that one has come to
know to some degree, the
founders and giants of perhaps the
greatest intellectual revolution in
the history of man.
Yet at the same time, "the
aesthetic approach of life" in
Florence creates a great gulf,
physical as well as mental,
between a student's life in
Florence and the life he led at
Stanford. The Florentine
experience is not viewed by most
students as a new direction in life
but rather an interlude in his life
which will eventually end.
Villa San Paolo
Considering more concrete
matters, the Villa itself is exactly
what its name implies, a large
mansion with beautiful grounds

and a garden overlooking the
town of Florence.
Florence is only three hours
away from Rome by train, three
hours from Venice, and an
overnight train ride from either
Paris or Vienna.
As far as the administration of
the Villa goes, it is hard to find
any fault. I feel I should mention
the administrators for any
understanding of what life at the
Villa is like is impossible without
considering them.
Villa Administration
Dr. Ginseppe Mammarella is
the head administrator at the
Villa, and so cool, eloquent, and
suave that one would expect to
find him in public relations or
politics. He planned field trips to
Venice and Greece which, for
many people, were the high points
of their overseas stay.
Doctor Frulla, the Director of
Studies, is an incredible person.
Like Zorba the Greek in his
child-like wonder and excitement
about things, he entertains for
hours on end by simply talking to
students.
Dr. Grazia Lanzillo sponsors
cultural and not-so-cultural events

such as a Renaissance feast with
15 courses and seven wines. To
judge the success of the feast one
only has to know that the
fifteenth course had to be served
to a majority of the students
under the table.
Meeting the People
As far as contacts with the
Italian people go, it is usually up
to the student how many he
establishes. While a majority of
students usually doesn't want to
be troubled with Italians hanging
around asking for dates, one
group of Italians most students
know well is Fabrizio and his
friends, who as might be
expected, hang out at the local
bar, Bepe's.
The eliche, essentially true,
about overseas campuses is that
how good they are depends upon
the group. At Villa San Paolo,
how well the student adapts
himself to the "aesthetic approach
to life" and how well he
overcomes the inertia soaked into
him by the Italian sun also will
determine whether he enjoys six
months in the living museum that
is Florence.
