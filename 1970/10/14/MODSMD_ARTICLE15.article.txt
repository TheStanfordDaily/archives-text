# Where Are The Stooges?
## 
### RINGO DEON 
This is a serious question.
Where are the Stooges? Curly and
Shemp are, of course, dead.
Nevertheless, Moe Howard and
Larry Fine are fine, I think. And
Curly Joe.
Some Stooge fans don't like
Joe. He's OK by me, though. Moe
and Larry got old and the
hammers don't bounce so good
off their heads any more. Curly
Joe is their ideal campanion. He
would be your best friend if you
were in the mental ward.
The original Curly was a
genius, a madman. Sadism to
warm the heart of every
American. Woo-woo-woo-woo.
Moe and Larry are constants.
Moe has been described as the
most brilliant man since Hitler.
Larry is my favorite. He is beyond
description.
Are the Three Stooges
surrealists? I have never heard this
question asked.
Yesterday I called the Stooges'
manager in Hollywood. They
don't wanna do student films. Be
sure to watch them on TV,
though.
("Snow White and The Three
Stooges" will be shown tonight at
7:30 and 10:00 in Cubberly
Auditorium)
