Ehrlich Denounces Racism
SAN FRANCISCO - Dr. Paul Ehrlich, author of
"The Population Bomb," said Tuesday that "white
racism and the American 'welfare state' are major
factors in reducing our children's chances of
survival."
They "bar the United States from assuming
leadership in a worldwide attempt to deal with the
environment crisis," said the Stanford University
biologist.
He told a national conference of Actuaries of
Public Practice that in its relations with the rest of
the world, the United States "suffers from a vast
credibility gap."
"We walk peace and wage war; we talk equality
and persecute our nonwhite citizens; we talk
democracy and permit a privileged few to run the
country for their own benefit; we talk feeding the
world and let many of our own citizens go hungry,"
Ehrlich said.
"We are busily stealing, not only from the other
passengers on 'Spaceship Earth,' but from our
descendants as well," he said.
Obscenity Report Rejected
WASHINGTON — The Senate heard the recent report
of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography
denounced Tuesday as a repulsive example of
"marsh mallow-headed thinking," then voted
overwhelmingly to reject all its major findings.
The 60-5 vote for a resolution condemning the
report came moments after its chief sponsor, Sen.
John L. McClellan, D-Ark., declared:

"I fear that if we allow and encourage the flow of
obscene material, there will be no stopping these sex
offenders. This filth is stimulating to them, they feed
on it and the commission would guarantee that they
have their fill."
In their findings, 15 of the 18-member commission
said there is no evidence that exposure to
pornography is a significant cause of crime or leads to
immoral or unnatural sex acts.
They recommended that "federal, state and local
legislation prohibiting the sale, exhibition or
distribution of sexual materials to consenting adults
should be repealed."
The resolution, which expresses the sense of the
Senate but has no legal force, follows closely a letter
signed by 34 Republican senators urging President
Nixon to "disavow" the commission's findings.
Canada — Red China Pact
OTTAWA — Canada and Red China agreed Tuesday
to establish diplomatic relations at once and to
exchange ambassadors within six months.
Ottawa broke relations with Nationalist China.
Nationalist China, with headquarters on Formosa,
announcing it in turn had severed relations with
Ottawa, declared Canada had ignored "its friendship
of long standing with the government of the Republic
of China."
Canada's action came just 20 years after Britain
took a similar course. But Britain and Red China
never had exchanged ambassadors, allowing their
embassies to be headed by secondary diplomats.
Forty-six nations now recognize Red China and 67
have relations with the Nationalist government. The

United States recognizes the Nationalist of President
Chiang Kai-shek and opposed Canada's move to begin
the talks with Peking in Stockholm in January 1 969.
The White House in Washington would only say
Canada and the United States had discussed the
question for some time.
New Bomb Threats
WASHINGTON — The government tightened security
at federal buildings and offices throughout the nation
Tuesday after a series of terrorist bombings.
A spokesman for the General Services
Administration, manager of federal civilian
installations, said he did not know whether the alert
was prompted by any secret information that might
warn of further attacks; nor did he know how long
the alert might last.
The GSA placed guards on patrol outside federal
buildings and in parking areas; locked all but the main
entrances; and began denying entrance to persons
carrying "suspicious packages" unless they permitted
inspection of the parcels.
Sea Lions Dying
SAN FRANCISCO - A mysterious ailment is killing
sea lions in unprecedented numbers in the San
Francisco Bay Area, and intensive studies are being
made in efforts to find out why.
About 30 deaths have been logged in recent weeks,
some 10 times greater than the ordinary mortality
rate, authorities said Tuesday.

In their findings, 15 of the 18-member commission
said there is no evidence that exposure to
pornography is a significant cause of crime or leads to
immoral or unnatural sex acts.
They recommended that "federal, state and local
legislation prohibiting the sale, exhibition or
distribution of sexual materials to consenting adults
should be repealed."
The resolution, which expresses the sense of the
Senate but has no legal force, follows closely a letter
signed by 34 Republican senators urging President
Nixon to "disavow" the commission's findings.
Canada — Red China Pact
OTTAWA — Canada and Red China agreed Tuesday
to establish diplomatic relations at once and to
exchange ambassadors within six months.
Ottawa broke relations with Nationalist China.
Nationalist China, with headquarters on Formosa,
announcing it in turn had severed relations with
Ottawa, declared Canada had ignored "its friendship
of long standing with the government of the Republic
of China."
Canada's action came just 20 years after Britain
took a similar course. But Britain and Red China
never had exchanged ambassadors, allowing their
embassies to be headed by secondary diplomats.
Forty-six nations now recognize Red China and 67
have relations with the Nationalist government. The

United States recognizes the Nationalist of President
Chiang Kai-shek and opposed Canada's move to begin
the talks with Peking in Stockholm in January 1 969.
The White House in Washington would only say
Canada and the United States had discussed the
question for some time.
New Bomb Threats
WASHINGTON — The government tightened security
at federal buildings and offices throughout the nation
Tuesday after a series of terrorist bombings.
A spokesman for the General Services
Administration, manager of federal civilian
installations, said he did not know whether the alert
was prompted by any secret information that might
warn of further attacks; nor did he know how long
the alert might last.
The GSA placed guards on patrol outside federal
buildings and in parking areas; locked all but the main
entrances; and began denying entrance to persons
carrying "suspicious packages" unless they permitted
inspection of the parcels.
Sea Lions Dying
SAN FRANCISCO - A mysterious ailment is killing
sea lions in unprecedented numbers in the San
Francisco Bay Area, and intensive studies are being
made in efforts to find out why.
About 30 deaths have been logged in recent weeks,
some 10 times greater than the ordinary mortality
rate, authorities said Tuesday.
Ehrlich Denounces Racism
SAN FRANCISCO - Dr. Paul Ehrlich, author of
"The Population Bomb," said Tuesday that "white
racism and the American 'welfare state' are major
factors in reducing our children's chances of
survival."
They "bar the United States from assuming
leadership in a worldwide attempt to deal with the
environment crisis," said the Stanford University
biologist.
He told a national conference of Actuaries of
Public Practice that in its relations with the rest of
the world, the United States "suffers from a vast
credibility gap."
"We walk peace and wage war; we talk equality
and persecute our nonwhite citizens; we talk
democracy and permit a privileged few to run the
country for their own benefit; we talk feeding the
world and let many of our own citizens go hungry,"
Ehrlich said.
"We are busily stealing, not only from the other
passengers on 'Spaceship Earth,' but from our
descendants as well," he said.
Obscenity Report Rejected
WASHINGTON — The Senate heard the recent report
of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography
denounced Tuesday as a repulsive example of
"marsh mallow-headed thinking," then voted
overwhelmingly to reject all its major findings.
The 60-5 vote for a resolution condemning the
report came moments after its chief sponsor, Sen.
John L. McClellan, D-Ark., declared:

"I fear that if we allow and encourage the flow of
obscene material, there will be no stopping these sex
offenders. This filth is stimulating to them, they feed
on it and the commission would guarantee that they
have their fill."
In their findings, 15 of the 18-member commission
said there is no evidence that exposure to
