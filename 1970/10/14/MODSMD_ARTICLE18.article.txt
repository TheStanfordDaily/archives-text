# McCloskey, Gomperts Speak In Forum '70
## 
### 
Incumbent Congressman Pete
McCloskey and his Democratic
opponent Robert Gomperts opposed
one another last night in debate at the
Stanford Community Forum '70. The
debate featured general agreement on
most issues, with differences in basic
approach.
The audience was disappointed to
learn that two other scheduled
debaters, Ron Dellums and John
Healy—both congressional candidates
from the Berkeley area—were occupied
with affairs in Berkeley and were
unable to appear.
McCloskey opened with a statement
on the need for a basic change in
priorities from those of containment of
Communism, and Americans' concern
only for personal conveniences. He
stated that Republicans who had been
in the previous Congress would be in
more advantageous position to change
national priorities, than would a new
Democrat who would have to spend his
first year in "apprenticeship."
Gomperts expressed his concern
over new repressive legislation, and
maintained that he was very concerned
that the only way the government
could see to exercise control was to
abandon constitutional rights.

McCloskey condemned student
violence as being harmful to the search
for peace in Vietnam and felt it
reduced further communication with
President Nixon.
The establishment of a volunteer
army, in replacement for the draft, was
advocated by Gomperts. However,
McCloskey stated that a volunteer army
would not be possible.

schools, and strengthening
environmental control measures.
Tunney will speak for fifteen
minutes and then answer questions
from Larry Diamond, Don Ayer,
