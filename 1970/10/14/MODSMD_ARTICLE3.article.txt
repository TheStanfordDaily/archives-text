# Senate Elections Important
## Lyman Urges Student Vote 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
President Richard Lyman
emphasized last night the need for a
University President to rise above the
"sea of routine" in his job and to "get
out of building 10 and find out what's
happening."
Commenting on the possibilities of
University restructuring Lyman said, "I
think that whenever you have a fair
number of vacancies, there are obvious
opportunities to take a fresh look at
activities." The remarks were made
during Lyman's weekly press conference
on KZSU.
(At present the positions of Provost,
Vice-President for Business Affairs,
Dean of the Medical School and
Vice-President for Medical Affairs, Dean
of Students, and two additional
deanships are vacant.)
Widely Varying Topics
Lyman opened the news conference,
whose panel covered a number of topics
ranging from bomb threats to the
Stanford Repertory Theater, by
emphasizing the need for student
participation in the upcoming Student
Senate elections.
"In student government, as in other
kinds of government, one tends to get
the kind of government one deserves,"
Lyman said. "Politics is a business that
requires a good deal of patience ... if
people aren't willing to work at it, they
leave the field in command of those who
are willing to work at it.
"Those are not necessarily the most
representative people," he continued.
Chris Hocker, co-editor of the Arena,
a newspaper associated with the
libertarian Free Campus Movement at
Stanford, asked whether the "hopeless

bureaucracy" of the Associated
Students' government was not an
argument for a voluntary student
government.
In response, Lyman said, "I would be
ill-advised to try to get involved in
telling the students how to run their
student government.
"More Democracy" As Cure
"I can't help thinking that the cure
for the problems of a democracy is
usually more democracy, not less," he
added.
Larry Liebert, KZSU and Daily
staffer, questioned Lyman on the
current status of a proposal to increase
the Night Security section of the
Stanford Police Department from 9 to
39 men, a move involving perhaps a
$200 ,000 budget increase.
Terming the police force "quite
undermanned," Lyman said that,
although there is no change thus far

between this year and last, "We will be
spending more money on
security ... but exactly how is not clear
He added that it would not be
incorrect to suggest an increase of
$200,000 in this funding, "and possibly
more in the future.'.'
The presence of unmarked police
cars cruising around the campus was
brought up by Neuman, who stated that
he had been tailed by a 1969 beige Ford
with the l ; cense ZHW-089 on occasions
both last year and recently this year.
Lyman denied knowledge of their
presence, and asked Neuman for
information after the program.
(The Daily called the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office last night to see
if they knew of this vehicle. After
investigating, Officer Kahn told the
Daily that the car was registered in the
University's name. The University Police
Department confirmed that it is theirs.)

Widely Varying Topics
Lyman opened the news conference,
whose panel covered a number of topics
ranging from bomb threats to the
Stanford Repertory Theater, by
emphasizing the need for student
participation in the upcoming Student
Senate elections.
"In student government, as in other
kinds of government, one tends to get
the kind of government one deserves,"
Lyman said. "Politics is a business that
requires a good deal of patience ... if
people aren't willing to work at it, they
leave the field in command of those who
are willing to work at it.
"Those are not necessarily the most
representative people," he continued.
Chris Hocker, co-editor of the Arena,
a newspaper associated with the
libertarian Free Campus Movement at
Stanford, asked whether the "hopeless

bureaucracy" of the Associated
Students' government was not an
argument for a voluntary student
government.
In response, Lyman said, "I would be
ill-advised to try to get involved in
telling the students how to run their
student government.
"More Democracy" As Cure
"I can't help thinking that the cure
for the problems of a democracy is
usually more democracy, not less," he
added.
Larry Liebert, KZSU and Daily
staffer, questioned Lyman on the
current status of a proposal to increase
the Night Security section of the
Stanford Police Department from 9 to
39 men, a move involving perhaps a
$200 ,000 budget increase.
Terming the police force "quite
undermanned," Lyman said that,
although there is no change thus far

between this year and last, "We will be
spending more money on
security ... but exactly how is not clear
He added that it would not be
incorrect to suggest an increase of
$200,000 in this funding, "and possibly
more in the future.'.'
The presence of unmarked police
cars cruising around the campus was
brought up by Neuman, who stated that
he had been tailed by a 1969 beige Ford
with the l ; cense ZHW-089 on occasions
both last year and recently this year.
Lyman denied knowledge of their
presence, and asked Neuman for
information after the program.
(The Daily called the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office last night to see
if they knew of this vehicle. After
investigating, Officer Kahn told the
Daily that the car was registered in the
University's name. The University Police
Department confirmed that it is theirs.)
President Richard Lyman
emphasized last night the need for a
University President to rise above the
"sea of routine" in his job and to "get
out of building 10 and find out what's
happening."
Commenting on the possibilities of
University restructuring Lyman said, "I
think that whenever you have a fair
number of vacancies, there are obvious
opportunities to take a fresh look at
activities." The remarks were made
during Lyman's weekly press conference
on KZSU.
(At present the positions of Provost,
Vice-President for Business Affairs,
Dean of the Medical School and
Vice-President for Medical Affairs, Dean
of Students, and two additional
deanships are vacant.)
