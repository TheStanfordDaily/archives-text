### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Angela Davis, the
black militant and former philosophy
professor sought for nearly two months
in connection with a California
courthouse shootout, was arrested here
by the FBI Tuesday night.
The 2 6-year-old former University
of California at Los Angeles faculty
member has been accused of supplying
the weapons used by Jonathan P.
Jackson, 17, for a courtroom breakout
in which four persons, including the
judge, were shot to death Aug. 7 in San
Rafael, Calif.

She and a Negro male companion,
David Rudolph Poindexter, Jr., 36,
were picked up in a mid-Manhattan
motel.
The FBI said Miss Da"is, an avowed
Communist who was placed on the
bureau's 10 most wanted list after
being charged in connection with the
California shooting, and Poindexter
spent several days in the motel.
Awaits Arraignment
Miss Davis, was taken from the
motel to FBI headquarters here and
then to the Women's House of
Detention to await arraignment
Wednesday on charges of unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution.
The FBI said it traced Miss Davis
through a car owned by Poindexter
who was charged with harboring a
fugitive.
An academically brilliant protege of
Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse,
she became an assistant professor of
philosophy at UCLA last year and was
ordered discharged by a majority of the
Board of Regents

The regents were overruled by a
Superior Court judge and then appealed
to the California Supreme Court.

Quentin convicts James D. McClain and
William A. Christmas and young
Jackson were killed in a kidnap-escape
plot.
All four of the guns used in the
break a sawed-off shotgun, two pistols
and a carbine were traced to Miss Davis.

own name in Southern California gun
shops over the past two years, police
said.
Jackson took the guns into the
courtroom, where the judge, prosecutor
and three women jurors were abducted.
Tlie shootings took place in a driveway
as the fugitives attempted to flee in a

NEW YORK (AP) — Angela Davis, the
black militant and former philosophy
professor sought for nearly two months
in connection with a California
courthouse shootout, was arrested here
by the FBI Tuesday night.
The 2 6-year-old former University
of California at Los Angeles faculty
member has been accused of supplying
the weapons used by Jonathan P.
Jackson, 17, for a courtroom breakout
in which four persons, including the
judge, were shot to death Aug. 7 in San
Rafael, Calif.

She and a Negro male companion,
David Rudolph Poindexter, Jr., 36,
were picked up in a mid-Manhattan
motel.
The FBI said Miss Da"is, an avowed
Communist who was placed on the
bureau's 10 most wanted list after
being charged in connection with the
California shooting, and Poindexter
spent several days in the motel.
Awaits Arraignment
Miss Davis, was taken from the
motel to FBI headquarters here and
then to the Women's House of
Detention to await arraignment
Wednesday on charges of unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution.
The FBI said it traced Miss Davis
through a car owned by Poindexter
who was charged with harboring a
fugitive.
An academically brilliant protege of
Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse,
she became an assistant professor of
philosophy at UCLA last year and was
ordered discharged by a majority of the
Board of Regents

The regents were overruled by a
Superior Court judge and then appealed
to the California Supreme Court.
Regents Rejection
While the appeal was pending, the
regents voted not to reappoint Miss
Davis,
The charges against Miss Davis were
filed Aug. 14, one week after Superior
Court Judge Harold J. Haley, San
Quentin convicts James D. McClain and
William A. Christmas and young
Jackson were killed in a kidnap-escape
plot.
All four of the guns used in the
break a sawed-off shotgun, two pistols
and a carbine were traced to Miss Davis.
She had purchased them under her
own name in Southern California gun
shops over the past two years, police
said.
Jackson took the guns into the
courtroom, where the judge, prosecutor
and three women jurors were abducted.
