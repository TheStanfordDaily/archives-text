# 'Arena' Reveals Plans For State-Wide Issue
## 
### PETER MEIC 
For at least three weeks the Arena,
the newspaper of the Free Campus
Movement (FCM), will have a
state-wide audience.
Today the first Stanford edition of
the quarter is scheduled to be released
on campus; later this week or early
next week, another edition, though
somewhat altered, of the Arena will be
distributed throughout the state.
Christopher Hocker, a co-editor of
both editions, explained that 1 00,000
copies of the Arena will be released at
major college campuses around
California.
This special state-wide edition is
being funded by a "state-wide
youth-oriented organization composed
basically of moderate to conservative
students," according to Hocker.
Even though he insisted that the
California edition is not the work of
one person, Hocker did allude to a
Stanford alumnus whom he refused to
identify. Apparently, the state-wide
edition is both the financial and
conceptual responsibility of this
unnamed alumnus.
The purpose of the state-wide Arena
is, stated Hocker, to "put libertarian

and conservative thinking back on the
campus."
The Arena will have a weekly
state-wide issue at least until the
November 3 elections. One of its
primary purposes is to promote the
candidacy of those people it finds
politically and philosophically
acceptable.
Hocker, along with co-editor Buzz
Thompson, insists that the paper will be
independent. If they feel that their
views are "being managed" by their
backer, they intend to halt publication.
The status of the state-wide edition
following the election has still not been
determined for several reasons
including financial uncertainties.
The Stanford campus edition may
also be discontinued after the
November elections for financial
reasons. However, until such a time,
Hocker states that the avowed purpose
of both editions is to be "one sided,
but factual."
The staff feels that their paper is
pro-libertarian rather than anti-radical.
The Arena is currently supporting a
17-man slate for the ASSU student
senate; however, not all endorsed
candidates are members of FCM.
