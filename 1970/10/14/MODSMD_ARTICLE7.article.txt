# Stanford's Incomparable Band Scores Each Halftime
## 
### LOUISE LIBBY 
Not far behind the Athletic
Department building is the home of the
incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB).
It is a squat, sickly-green structure,
condemned before the 1906
earthquake and, as legend would have
it, presently held together by floor
varnish alone. Known as the Bank
Shack, the small building faithfully
disgorges its inhabitants for halftime
shows.
Thriving on the enthusiasm and
ribald humor of its members, rather
than on its meager administrative
support, the Stanford Band is a unique
and exciting organization. The 135
players and five staff members make up
the largest band in University history.
Under Manager Ken Peterson (alias
Kenny-Pooh), the students run their
own band, select the contemporary
music, and in a brain-storming session
called SMUT (Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers), work out the marching
formations. Most of the songs are less
than five years old, as witnessed by
Saturday's Woodstock show. The one
exception was "At the Hop," which no
doubt appealed as much to current
students as it did to sentimental
alumni.
Dr. Arthur P. Barnes arranges and
directs the music, assisted by Mr. Glen
Daum. Onfield directing is the work of
exuberant drum major Geordie Lawry.
During Monday night rehearsals, the
Shack is jammed with clamorous
players and instruments. To improve
th" acoustics, the walls are lined with
egg cartons, and decorated with an
astounding array of pilfered signs, one
of which reads, ironically, WOMEN

(there are none in the Band) and
another $500 REWARD FOR
INFORMATION LEADING TO THE
ARREST AND CONVICTION OF
ANY PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR
CAUSING DAMAGE TO SIGNS
ERECTED BY CLACKAMAS
COUNTY.
No Money
The players obviously enjoy what
they are doing. In the words of Dave
Ruiz, assistant manager and solo
trumpeter in Dr. Barnes' arrangement
of the national anthem: "Everybody is
willing to put in time. The band
members must put in more time per
unit than any other group."
John Sabl, cymbal player, succinctly
stated, "We do it because it's fun. If we
didn't like it we wouldn't do it."
They do put out. Seventy bandsmen
made it to the Stanford-Arkansas game
in September at their own expense,
many by hitch-hiking. The Band had
asked the Athletic Department for
$3500 of the $6000 needed to make
the trip. They got $1500 from the
Athletic Department and nothing from
the Music Department.
Nowhere To Stay
"We had to raise the rest of the
money ourselves—by begging,"
commented Dave Ruiz. "The Band
really showed it's an enthusiastic
organization."
However, the money drive brought
in $1200 in solicited donations from
local firms and alumni, mostly in $5
and $1 0 amounts.
Once in Arkansas, there was no
money for housing or transportation in
Little Rock. Therefore the players
spent two nights on the floor of the

Hall High School gym, until Governor
Rockefeller, taking the Band under his
benevolent wing, arranged for housing
at the Little Rock Air Force Base at
about 40 cents a day
Arkansas apparently loved the
Band's halftime performance—a
California surfing show poking fun at
traditional stodgy band halftimes. The
Band has put all of the subsequent fan
mail on its bulletin board, including the
telegram from Stephen Stills of Crosby,
Stills, Nash, & Young.
Band Camp Banned
From the university it represented,
the Stanford Band has received no
official thanks. Peterson regretfully
summarized the situation: "We have
had little administration support on
some vital issues, for example, Band
Camp."
Band Camp is a sore subject. In
previous years, band members and
interested freshmen have gathered at
school about three days early to start
practicing the first show. Band Camp
allows newcomers to get to know the
band, without committing themselves
to being in the Band, and the camp is,
according to Manager Peterson,
"absolutely crucial to a successful and
proficient marching performance."
Letters are mailed to those freshmen
who have indicated band on their
activities preference cards.
Practice Denied
This year, however, Assistant Dean
of Undergraduate Studies Doug Davis
informed the Band that there would be
no Band Camp and denied any contact
with students who had indicated an
interest in band until little more than a
week before their arrival on campus.

This decision was made, Davis
indicated, on the grounds that camp
obligated newcomers to one
organization before they had a chance
to explore all that the University had to
offer. Among other things, the
elimination of camp deprived the Band
of approximately 18 hours of practice
time, and greatly overburdened the
staff and all bandsmen during the first
two weeks of school.
The Band is far from wealthy. Band
uniforms, which were new four years
ago, are insufficient for the number of
players. The drummers and tuba
players march in vests instead of
blazers. (By contrast, the UCLA band is
reputed to have two sets of uniforms.)
Recognition Due
"These are merely minor
annoyances, however. If the Band was
more solvent," Ken Peterson says,"the
Band would use the money to make
more appearances on behalf of the
University. It would also reimburse
members for their expenses in
connection with the Arkansas game."
"Also, the Band would repay the
courtesies shown it by other school
bands. While hosting Stanford, for
instance, the UCLA band treats our
hand to dinner. That Stanford cannot
begin to return this generosity is a
negative reflection on the University."
Furthermore, the Band cannot
provide its own public- relations, yet it
continues to perform at as many
athletic events and alumni functions as
it can. It also performs for students on
campus and charitable organizations off
campus. According to bandsmen, the
Band's service to the University is quite
obviously not commensurate with its
finances or policy support from same.

No Money
The players obviously enjoy what
they are doing. In the words of Dave
Ruiz, assistant manager and solo
trumpeter in Dr. Barnes' arrangement
of the national anthem: "Everybody is
willing to put in time. The band
members must put in more time per
unit than any other group."
John Sabl, cymbal player, succinctly
stated, "We do it because it's fun. If we
didn't like it we wouldn't do it."
They do put out. Seventy bandsmen
made it to the Stanford-Arkansas game
in September at their own expense,
many by hitch-hiking. The Band had
asked the Athletic Department for
$3500 of the $6000 needed to make
the trip. They got $1500 from the
Athletic Department and nothing from
the Music Department.
Nowhere To Stay
"We had to raise the rest of the
money ourselves—by begging,"
commented Dave Ruiz. "The Band
really showed it's an enthusiastic
organization."
However, the money drive brought
in $1200 in solicited donations from
local firms and alumni, mostly in $5
and $1 0 amounts.
Once in Arkansas, there was no
money for housing or transportation in
Little Rock. Therefore the players
spent two nights on the floor of the

Hall High School gym, until Governor
Rockefeller, taking the Band under his
benevolent wing, arranged for housing
at the Little Rock Air Force Base at
about 40 cents a day
Arkansas apparently loved the
Band's halftime performance—a
California surfing show poking fun at
traditional stodgy band halftimes. The
Band has put all of the subsequent fan
mail on its bulletin board, including the
telegram from Stephen Stills of Crosby,
Stills, Nash, & Young.
Band Camp Banned
From the university it represented,
the Stanford Band has received no
official thanks. Peterson regretfully
summarized the situation: "We have
had little administration support on
some vital issues, for example, Band
Camp."
Band Camp is a sore subject. In
previous years, band members and
interested freshmen have gathered at
school about three days early to start
practicing the first show. Band Camp
allows newcomers to get to know the
band, without committing themselves
to being in the Band, and the camp is,
according to Manager Peterson,
"absolutely crucial to a successful and
proficient marching performance."
Letters are mailed to those freshmen
who have indicated band on their
activities preference cards.
Practice Denied
This year, however, Assistant Dean
of Undergraduate Studies Doug Davis
informed the Band that there would be
no Band Camp and denied any contact
with students who had indicated an
interest in band until little more than a
week before their arrival on campus.

This decision was made, Davis
indicated, on the grounds that camp
obligated newcomers to one
organization before they had a chance
to explore all that the University had to
offer. Among other things, the
elimination of camp deprived the Band
of approximately 18 hours of practice
time, and greatly overburdened the
staff and all bandsmen during the first
two weeks of school.
The Band is far from wealthy. Band
uniforms, which were new four years
ago, are insufficient for the number of
players. The drummers and tuba
players march in vests instead of
blazers. (By contrast, the UCLA band is
reputed to have two sets of uniforms.)
Recognition Due
"These are merely minor
annoyances, however. If the Band was
more solvent," Ken Peterson says,"the
Band would use the money to make
more appearances on behalf of the
University. It would also reimburse
members for their expenses in
connection with the Arkansas game."
"Also, the Band would repay the
courtesies shown it by other school
bands. While hosting Stanford, for
instance, the UCLA band treats our
hand to dinner. That Stanford cannot
begin to return this generosity is a
negative reflection on the University."
Furthermore, the Band cannot
provide its own public- relations, yet it
continues to perform at as many
athletic events and alumni functions as
it can. It also performs for students on
campus and charitable organizations off
campus. According to bandsmen, the
Band's service to the University is quite
obviously not commensurate with its
finances or policy support from same.

WHAT'S USC'S RUBBER BAND UP TO? Looking a little grim, but hardly
silenced, Stanford's incomparable bandsmen ponder thier next caustic—and
probably obscene—retort.
Not far behind the Athletic
Department building is the home of the
incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB).
It is a squat, sickly-green structure,
condemned before the 1906
earthquake and, as legend would have
it, presently held together by floor
varnish alone. Known as the Bank
Shack, the small building faithfully
disgorges its inhabitants for halftime
shows.
Thriving on the enthusiasm and
ribald humor of its members, rather
than on its meager administrative
support, the Stanford Band is a unique
and exciting organization. The 135
players and five staff members make up
the largest band in University history.
Under Manager Ken Peterson (alias
Kenny-Pooh), the students run their
own band, select the contemporary
music, and in a brain-storming session
called SMUT (Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers), work out the marching
formations. Most of the songs are less

members must put in more time per
unit than any other group."
John Sabl, cymbal player, succinctly
stated, "We do it because it's fun. If we
didn't like it we wouldn't do it."
They do put out. Seventy bandsmen
made it to the Stanford-Arkansas game
in September at their own expense,
many by hitch-hiking. The Band had
asked the Athletic Department for
$3500 of the $6000 needed to make
the trip. They got $1500 from the
Athletic Department and nothing from
the Music Department.
Nowhere To Stay
"We had to raise the rest of the
money ourselves—by begging,"
commented Dave Ruiz. "The Band
really showed it's an enthusiastic
organization."
However, the money drive brought
in $1200 in solicited donations from
local firms and alumni, mostly in $5
and $1 0 amounts.
Once in Arkansas, there was no
money for housing or transportation in
Little Rock. Therefore the players
spent two nights on the floor of the

Hall High School gym, until Governor
Rockefeller, taking the Band under his
benevolent wing, arranged for housing
at the Little Rock Air Force Base at
about 40 cents a day
Arkansas apparently loved the
Band's halftime performance—a
California surfing show poking fun at
traditional stodgy band halftimes. The
Band has put all of the subsequent fan
mail on its bulletin board, including the
telegram from Stephen Stills of Crosby,
Stills, Nash, & Young.
Band Camp Banned
From the university it represented,
the Stanford Band has received no
official thanks. Peterson regretfully
summarized the situation: "We have
had little administration support on
some vital issues, for example, Band
Camp."
Band Camp is a sore subject. In
previous years, band members and
interested freshmen have gathered at
school about three days early to start
practicing the first show. Band Camp
allows newcomers to get to know the
band, without committing themselves
to being in the Band, and the camp is,
according to Manager Peterson,
"absolutely crucial to a successful and
proficient marching performance."
Letters are mailed to those freshmen
who have indicated band on their
activities preference cards.
Practice Denied
This year, however, Assistant Dean
of Undergraduate Studies Doug Davis
informed the Band that there would be
no Band Camp and denied any contact
with students who had indicated an
interest in band until little more than a
week before their arrival on campus.

This decision was made, Davis
indicated, on the grounds that camp
obligated newcomers to one
organization before they had a chance
to explore all that the University had to
offer. Among other things, the
elimination of camp deprived the Band
of approximately 18 hours of practice
time, and greatly overburdened the
staff and all bandsmen during the first
two weeks of school.
The Band is far from wealthy. Band
uniforms, which were new four years
ago, are insufficient for the number of
players. The drummers and tuba
players march in vests instead of
blazers. (By contrast, the UCLA band is
reputed to have two sets of uniforms.)
Recognition Due
"These are merely minor
annoyances, however. If the Band was
more solvent," Ken Peterson says,"the
Band would use the money to make
more appearances on behalf of the
University. It would also reimburse
members for their expenses in
connection with the Arkansas game."
"Also, the Band would repay the
courtesies shown it by other school
bands. While hosting Stanford, for
instance, the UCLA band treats our
hand to dinner. That Stanford cannot
begin to return this generosity is a
negative reflection on the University."
Furthermore, the Band cannot
provide its own public- relations, yet it
continues to perform at as many
athletic events and alumni functions as
it can. It also performs for students on
campus and charitable organizations off
campus. According to bandsmen, the
Band's service to the University is quite
obviously not commensurate with its
finances or policy support from same.

WHAT'S USC'S RUBBER BAND UP TO? Looking a little grim, but hardly
silenced, Stanford's incomparable bandsmen ponder thier next caustic—and
probably obscene—retort.
Not far behind the Athletic
Department building is the home of the
incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB).
It is a squat, sickly-green structure,
condemned before the 1906
earthquake and, as legend would have
it, presently held together by floor
varnish alone. Known as the Bank
Shack, the small building faithfully
disgorges its inhabitants for halftime
shows.
Thriving on the enthusiasm and
ribald humor of its members, rather
than on its meager administrative
support, the Stanford Band is a unique
and exciting organization. The 135
players and five staff members make up
the largest band in University history.
Under Manager Ken Peterson (alias
Kenny-Pooh), the students run their
own band, select the contemporary
music, and in a brain-storming session
called SMUT (Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers), work out the marching
formations. Most of the songs are less
than five years old, as witnessed by
Saturday's Woodstock show. The one
exception was "At the Hop," which no
doubt appealed as much to current
students as it did to sentimental
alumni.
Dr. Arthur P. Barnes arranges and
directs the music, assisted by Mr. Glen
Daum. Onfield directing is the work of
exuberant drum major Geordie Lawry.
During Monday night rehearsals, the
Shack is jammed with clamorous
players and instruments. To improve
th" acoustics, the walls are lined with
egg cartons, and decorated with an
astounding array of pilfered signs, one
of which reads, ironically, WOMEN

(there are none in the Band) and
another $500 REWARD FOR
INFORMATION LEADING TO THE
ARREST AND CONVICTION OF
ANY PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR
CAUSING DAMAGE TO SIGNS
