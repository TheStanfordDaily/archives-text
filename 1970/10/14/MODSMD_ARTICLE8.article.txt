# Stanford-in-Britain
## Scandal Site Attracts Students 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Perched upon a high bluff
overlooking the Thames River
Valley, Stanford-in-Britain
combines luxurious surroundings
with English countryside charm
and a generally challenging
curriculum.
Occupying Cliveden House, the
former palatial estate of the Astor
family, Stanford-in-Britain enjoys
what reputed to be the most
beautiful surroundings and most
complete facilities of any overseas
campus.
New students at the English

campus are astounded by the
beautiful setting. Although the
buildings are interesting,
especially the "public" rooms on
the first floor which are open to
tourists, the grounds of the estate
are overwhelming.
In addition to a swimming
pool, tennis court, tea garden and
indoor squash court, formal
gardens branch off the huge
manicured lawns. The pathways
through the woods or along the
mile of riverfrontage within the
grounds are favorite afternoon
retreats for transplanted

Stanfordites.
During most of the year,
"straight" English and American
tourists mingle with students
playing touch football or reading
on the lawns in their jeans and
tennis shoes.
Inside, the tourists gaze at the
unused formal dining room, the
libraries and the main hall with its
suits of armor and tapestries.
Most of the English tourists
come to see the site of the
infamous Profumo scandal in
1 963, especially the swimming
pool where Christine Keeler took
her nude swim.
While the tourists meander
through the British campus, the
students spend most of their time
literally underground.
Beneath the main buildings and
along corridors are a series of
rooms where student life is
focused. In this area there are two
game rooms, a commons area with
a record player, a bar with the
"telly," a small store, the wine
cellar and the student dining
room.
Cliveden is located 25 miles
West of London between the

towns of Maidenhead and Slough.
Easy access to London by rail or
motorway adds to the campus's
appeal.
"I can leave for London after
lunch and be back for dinner if I
want to," remarked one former
Cliveden coed.
Before the campus was moved
almost two years ago, students
from the old manor at Harlaxton
almost had to stay overnight when
traveling to London.
Former Britain residents are
critical of the limited
opportunities they had to meet
local residents. Students claim
that the family exchange plan
exists on paper only. Many
returnees also criticize the
inadequacy of exchange programs
with British schools. The
relationship between the campus
and the nearby town of
Maidenhead, however, has
generally been good.
Some students criticize the
double campus' wage standards.
The campus staff is paid on a
British wage scale while the
administrators receive much
higher American-scaled salaries.


COUNTRYSIDE STUDENT GHETTO-Students even study in the
palatial surroundings of the Britain campus which includes a working
18 th century clocktower which chimes and bongs at all hours.
