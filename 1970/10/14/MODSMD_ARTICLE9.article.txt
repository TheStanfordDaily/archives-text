# Hospital To Build Emergency Heliport
## 
### 
Stanford University Hospital
officials have asked permission
from Palo Alto to establish an
emergency helicopter pad near the
hospital, to be used for the
transportation of premature
infants and other critically ill
patients to the hospital. The pad
would be located* about 7 00 ft.
from the hospital, between a
parking lot and the Welch RcL
office complex.
In a letter to City Manager
George Morgan, associate
administrator for the hospital
Frank R. Vitale commented:
"Over the past several years,
we have transported
infants. . . from as far south as
King City and as far east as Reno
by ambulance. Many of these
infants have been critically ill, and
the delay in transporting them to
Stanford has generally resulted in
undue damage to the infants."
Vitale also mentioned that the
'copter flights would be
"infrequent", and that they
would be made by a California
Highway Patrol Helicopter
through special arrangements
made with the CHP.
The helicopter would also be
used to round out the hospital's

disaster and Civil Defense plans,
and could be used in emergency
olood transportation for use in
open heart surgery.
