iTHEY SHOOT CHRISTIANS, DON'T THEY? |
Our brothers anil sisters at Berkeley have been threatened with physical violence.
There are those in the Berkeley scene who claim they will liquidate the Jesus move
ment. But their claims are empty threats. They may indeed begin physical per
secution, but the Jesus movement will continue its advance. The movement will go
on as long as its leader remains alive—eternally. This will not be the first attempt
to "liquidate the Jesus movement"—they tried that at the cross.
But why is our leader, Jesus, so intent upon perpetrating his movement? Because
most people, whether they are actively anti-Christ or indifferent (which is equally
anti-Christ), are fundamentally bored, lonely, and weary of life. Life has degener
ated into chemicals, unstable emotions, empty bodies, and ego-trips. Jesus is abso
lutely no part of their Ijves. But Jesus loves them and has suffered deatli for them—
and ho is willing to continue to suffer so that they might be liberated from the death
FOOLS THAT WE ARE
And why are we willing to follow Jesus into suffering in order to accomplish his
mission of liberation? Because Jesus lias changed our minds about a lot of things,
and we can no longer tolerate the foolishness and futility that is passed out as
wisdom at this university. We are tired of the "enlightenment" of this age which is
blindly ignorant of its intellectual slavery to materialism and its contradictory
obligation to ethical relativism. We are tired of seeing people's lives wasted and
unfulfilled because of their submission to. the established world order.
77/ E ESTABIJSHMENT
Cod has called us out of this world establishment, and we as Christians are
anxious to call others out of this establishment. Jesus' message was that none of us
need any longer accept the values, the fears, the behavior responses, and the atti
tudes that the world establishment nurtures. We need no longer share in the world
establishment's destruction. And we who have accepted the truth of this message
are anxious to proclaim to others that they too can be freed from the ways and
ends of the world system in which they find themselves trapped. Jesus is the unique
solution to the guilt and hate which burden us down—and we who have been
freed will boldly proclaim that you can be free as well.
Expect to hear from us this year. But don't hold your stereotypes up to us yet. I'm
afraid we will disappoint you. The brothers and sisters at Stanford are real people;
perhaps the only real people you will meet. You might even find them attractively
mysterious—quite unexplainable merely in terms of themselves (i.e., you may have
to introduce a God-factor). If you plan on labeling them anti-revolutionary or pro
establishment then you will have to misrepresent them. If you plan on marking
them as "anarchists" or discontents then you obviously don't know any of them.
We don't want any part of your power polities—it is only more of man's foolish
ness which claims to be vital but fails miserably in that it fails to even consider
the vital basic need of man. That is what we as Christians will be doing this year
at Stanford: proclaiming when ever we can Cod's message to man as to what we
need and how that need is met. We will attempt to bring the wandering community
mentality back to the central issue of all time—what do we do with Jesus? Today at
the noon rally and throughout the year, this the question we will continually raise.
Simply because it is the one question at tliis university that deserves an answer. And
(like it or not) the only question which demands an answer.
