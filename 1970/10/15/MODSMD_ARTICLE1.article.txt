# Manning Discusses Unrest
## 
### JULIE FLEECE 
Dean Bayless Manning of the Law
School, who has announced his
resignation effective at the end of this
school year, thinks a younger man
should take over. Manning, only 4 7 , has
initiated many innovations during his
eight years here which have improved
the already good reputation of the Law
School.
However, Manning cites further
rapid developments in legal education
as his main reason for leaving the
deanship. "I've been around the
carousel once," he said in a Daily
interview.
Dean Manning has attracted national
attention recently for the
announcement of his resignation and
for his participation on President
Nixon's Commission on Campus
Unrest. The nine-member commission,
headed by former Pennsylvania Gov.
William Scranton, spent the entire
summer in meetings and hearings and
released its 367-page report on Sept.
26. Appendices to the report on the
killings at Kent State University and at
Jackson State College were released the
following week.
In brief, the report was a
strongly-worded condemnation of both
student and police violence as
"criminal," and asked the President to
use his moral influence to initiate a
nationwide cease-fire between factions
on and off college campuses. The
commission termed the unrest on the
campuses "a crisis of understanding"
and urged the President to fulfill his
campaign promise to "bring us
togehter."

When asked if he was completely
satisfied with the result of the
commission's work, Manning responded
quickly, "Yes, I really am."
The report received a fair amount of
criticism when it was released, but
Manning dismissed much of the
criticism as "manifestly invalid"
because the critics had not really read
the report. He said that so far there had
been no serious, reflective criticisms of
the report by anyone who had read it
carefully.
Responding to criticism that the
report is too general, Manning replied
that the report makes specific
suggestions in several areas. As an
example, he mentioned
recommendations to police and
national guard units in the report. "I
think they're likely to have an
immediate operational impact,"' he
said.
Statements of Obvious
While Manning agreed that several of
the suggestions are indeed "statements
of the obvious," as some critics have
claimed, he feels they may do some
good. He pointed out thai although the
Ten Commandments are not heeded all
the time they are still statements of the
obvious which provide good advice.
"When a strong moral voice is
heard ... it does influence people,"
Manning said. He indicated that it may
be a long, slow process to achieve the
deep attitudinal changes necessary on
all sides in the campus crisis, but felt
that "it's not going to be as popular to
stand up and scream at
students . . . administrators . . . and
cops."

The commission was under a
tremendous time pressure to complete
its report. The members were not
appointed until June 13, and were told
to file their report in by Oct. 1.
According to Manning, there was a
"wheel-spinning period" at the
beginning to organize a staff and collect
information.
Project 'Took Off'
Then, from the first of August,
Manning said the project "took off like
a rocket" and the panel worked nearly
full-time for the remainder of the
summer.
Rumors circulated during the
summer that there were serious
divisions among the nine members.
Manning denied any hint of this, and
said that a general consensus developed
throughout the meetings.
"It was a most remarkable
experience in that regard," Manning
said. He indicated that the amount of
convergence of the nine perspectives
proved surprising.
It was also charged by
administration critics that the White
House tried to discount the report
before it was issued. Manning, a veteran
of Washington political circles, said that
there was just the "normal flak,
background noise" during the meetings.
Manning stressed, "There was
absolutely no effort of any kind from
the White House to influence the
substance of the report."
Legal Pressure
The commission felt a different
pressure, however, in preparing the
appendices on the killings at Kent State

and Jackson State. Manning said the
members were "exceedingly careful" in
preparing the Kent State report,
because a grand jury is now making a
criminal inquiry into the tragedy.
The commission took pains not to
jeopardize the proceedings of the grand
jury which will decide whether or not
any indictments against individuals are
warranted. Manning, for the same
reasons, declined comment on the
possible outcome of the hearings
except to say that it is a very serious
inquiry and will not result in a
whitewash.
There is also a Federal grand jury
investigating the shootings at Jackson
State, but Manning explained that this
grand jury can only rule on whether or

not a civil rights statute was violated. A
county grand jury had already cleared
the Mississippi policemen of criminal
blame.
The commission's report was
therefore less guarded in placing the
blame for the tragedy on the lawmen.
The report also stated that "racial
animosity" was a "substantial
contributing factor" in the tragedy.
In evaluating the commission's
work, Manning said he was "very happy
to have participated" in it. He said the
report "will stand as a reasonable
document for a long time."
One big question right now is what
Manning will do once he relinquishes
the deanship in June. "1 haven't the
faintest idea." he said.

Manning said the project "took off like

divisions among the nine members.
Manning denied any hint of this, and

"It was a most remarkable

said. He indicated that the amount of
convergence of the nine perspectives
proved surprising.

administration critics that the White
House tried to discount the report

and Jackson State. Manning said the
members were "exceedingly careful" in
preparing the Kent State report,
because a grand jury is now making a
criminal inquiry into the tragedy.
The commission took pains not to
jeopardize the proceedings of the grand
jury which will decide whether or not
any indictments against individuals are
warranted. Manning, for the same
reasons, declined comment on the
possible outcome of the hearings
except to say that it is a very serious
inquiry and will not result in a
whitewash.
There is also a Federal grand jury
investigating the shootings at Jackson
State, but Manning explained that this
grand jury can only rule on whether or

not a civil rights statute was violated. A
county grand jury had already cleared
the Mississippi policemen of criminal
blame.
The commission's report was
therefore less guarded in placing the
blame for the tragedy on the lawmen.
The report also stated that "racial
animosity" was a "substantial
contributing factor" in the tragedy.
In evaluating the commission's
work, Manning said he was "very happy
to have participated" in it. He said the
report "will stand as a reasonable
document for a long time."
One big question right now is what
Manning will do once he relinquishes
the deanship in June. "1 haven't the
faintest idea." he said.


RETIRING—Dean Bay less Manning of the I,aw School, who announced his
resignation for the end of this year, believes that "a younger man should take
over."
Dean Bayless Manning of the Law
School, who has announced his
resignation effective at the end of this
school year, thinks a younger man
should take over. Manning, only 4 7 , has
initiated many innovations during his
eight years here which have improved
the already good reputation of the Law
School.
However, Manning cites further
rapid developments in legal education
as his main reason for leaving the
deanship. "I've been around the
carousel once," he said in a Daily
interview.
Dean Manning has attracted national
attention recently for the
announcement of his resignation and
for his participation on President
Nixon's Commission on Campus
Unrest. The nine-member commission,
headed by former Pennsylvania Gov.
William Scranton, spent the entire
summer in meetings and hearings and
released its 367-page report on Sept.
26. Appendices to the report on the
killings at Kent State University and at
Jackson State College were released the
following week.
In brief, the report was a
strongly-worded condemnation of both
student and police violence as
"criminal," and asked the President to
use his moral influence to initiate a
nationwide cease-fire between factions
on and off college campuses. The
commission termed the unrest on the
campuses "a crisis of understanding"
and urged the President to fulfill his
campaign promise to "bring us
togehter."

When asked if he was completely
satisfied with the result of the
commission's work, Manning responded
quickly, "Yes, I really am."
The report received a fair amount of
criticism when it was released, but
Manning dismissed much of the
criticism as "manifestly invalid"
because the critics had not really read
the report. He said that so far there had
been no serious, reflective criticisms of
the report by anyone who had read it
carefully.
Responding to criticism that the
report is too general, Manning replied
that the report makes specific
suggestions in several areas. As an
example, he mentioned
recommendations to police and
national guard units in the report. "I
think they're likely to have an
immediate operational impact,"' he
said.
Statements of Obvious
While Manning agreed that several of
the suggestions are indeed "statements
of the obvious," as some critics have
claimed, he feels they may do some
good. He pointed out thai although the
Ten Commandments are not heeded all
the time they are still statements of the
obvious which provide good advice.
"When a strong moral voice is
heard ... it does influence people,"
Manning said. He indicated that it may
be a long, slow process to achieve the
deep attitudinal changes necessary on
all sides in the campus crisis, but felt
that "it's not going to be as popular to
stand up and scream at
students . . . administrators . . . and
cops."

The commission was under a
tremendous time pressure to complete
its report. The members were not
appointed until June 13, and were told
to file their report in by Oct. 1.
According to Manning, there was a
"wheel-spinning period" at the
beginning to organize a staff and collect
information.

for his participation on President
Nixon's Commission on Campus
Unrest. The nine-member commission,
headed by former Pennsylvania Gov.
William Scranton, spent the entire
summer in meetings and hearings and
released its 367-page report on Sept.
26. Appendices to the report on the
killings at Kent State University and at
Jackson State College were released the
following week.
In brief, the report was a
strongly-worded condemnation of both
student and police violence as
"criminal," and asked the President to
use his moral influence to initiate a
nationwide cease-fire between factions
on and off college campuses. The
commission termed the unrest on the
campuses "a crisis of understanding"
and urged the President to fulfill his
campaign promise to "bring us
togehter."

When asked if he was completely
satisfied with the result of the
commission's work, Manning responded
quickly, "Yes, I really am."
The report received a fair amount of
criticism when it was released, but
Manning dismissed much of the
criticism as "manifestly invalid"
because the critics had not really read
the report. He said that so far there had
been no serious, reflective criticisms of
the report by anyone who had read it
carefully.
Responding to criticism that the
report is too general, Manning replied
that the report makes specific
suggestions in several areas. As an
example, he mentioned
recommendations to police and
national guard units in the report. "I
think they're likely to have an
immediate operational impact,"' he
said.
Statements of Obvious
While Manning agreed that several of
the suggestions are indeed "statements
of the obvious," as some critics have
claimed, he feels they may do some
good. He pointed out thai although the
Ten Commandments are not heeded all
the time they are still statements of the
obvious which provide good advice.
"When a strong moral voice is
heard ... it does influence people,"
Manning said. He indicated that it may
be a long, slow process to achieve the
deep attitudinal changes necessary on
all sides in the campus crisis, but felt
that "it's not going to be as popular to
stand up and scream at
students . . . administrators . . . and
cops."

The commission was under a
tremendous time pressure to complete
its report. The members were not
appointed until June 13, and were told
to file their report in by Oct. 1.
According to Manning, there was a
"wheel-spinning period" at the
beginning to organize a staff and collect
information.
Project 'Took Off'
Then, from the first of August,
Manning said the project "took off like
a rocket" and the panel worked nearly
full-time for the remainder of the
summer.
Rumors circulated during the
summer that there were serious
divisions among the nine members.
Manning denied any hint of this, and
said that a general consensus developed
throughout the meetings.
"It was a most remarkable
experience in that regard," Manning
said. He indicated that the amount of
convergence of the nine perspectives
proved surprising.
It was also charged by
administration critics that the White
House tried to discount the report
before it was issued. Manning, a veteran
of Washington political circles, said that
there was just the "normal flak,
background noise" during the meetings.
Manning stressed, "There was
absolutely no effort of any kind from
the White House to influence the
substance of the report."
Legal Pressure
The commission felt a different
pressure, however, in preparing the
appendices on the killings at Kent State

and Jackson State. Manning said the
members were "exceedingly careful" in
preparing the Kent State report,
because a grand jury is now making a
criminal inquiry into the tragedy.
The commission took pains not to
jeopardize the proceedings of the grand
jury which will decide whether or not
any indictments against individuals are
warranted. Manning, for the same
reasons, declined comment on the
possible outcome of the hearings
except to say that it is a very serious
inquiry and will not result in a
whitewash.
There is also a Federal grand jury
investigating the shootings at Jackson
State, but Manning explained that this
grand jury can only rule on whether or

not a civil rights statute was violated. A
county grand jury had already cleared
the Mississippi policemen of criminal
blame.
The commission's report was
therefore less guarded in placing the
blame for the tragedy on the lawmen.
The report also stated that "racial
animosity" was a "substantial
contributing factor" in the tragedy.
In evaluating the commission's
work, Manning said he was "very happy
to have participated" in it. He said the
report "will stand as a reasonable
document for a long time."
One big question right now is what
Manning will do once he relinquishes
the deanship in June. "1 haven't the
faintest idea." he said.

Dean Bayless Manning of the Law

resignation effective at the end of this

the already good reputation of the Law

However, Manning cites further
rapid developments in legal education
as his main reason for leaving the
deanship. "I've been around the
