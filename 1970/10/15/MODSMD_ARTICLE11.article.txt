# 'loss of confidence'
## Where To From Here? 
### 
(Editor's note: The following is from the Sept. 21 issue of I.F.
Stone's Bi-Weekly.)
As a young newspaperman during the world depression I never felt
the despair I am beginning to feel now about the future of our
country. When I try to analyze the difference I think one reason is
that then even the revolutionaries had rational goals, not just a blind
frustrated urge to destroy. And, of course, the election of 1932 soon
provided a fresh, electric and responsive leadership. It was as if in
1968 McCarthy of Bobby Kennedy had won the election and
transformed despair into hope overnight.
Today there is a loss of confidence that extends into every sector
of society, even those which usually find it reassuring to have a
Republican President. The feeble little stock boomlet that Nixon and
the Federal Reserve are trying to pump up for November, at the
expense of letting up on the fight against inflation, barely covers over
a precarious business situation. The banks are carrying on their books
many businesses which are overripe for the bankruptcy courts, lest a
general collapse engulf the banks with them. The social landscape does
not encourage long-range investment. Black and chicano minorities are
in revolt, and an urban guerrilla movement confronts us in the cities
and on the campuses. Another Kent State could set off a tidal wave of
violence on the nation's campuses. The police have become targets for
snipers, as have firemen. Guns are ready everywhere. A tiny minority
of firebrand youngsters is making good on its threat to "bring the war
home."

It begins to look as if it may be easy to break down the fabric of
American society. To rebuild it will be very hard. Anarchy and
barbarity, race war and gang rule, not Utopia, lie at the end of the
road on which our instant revolutionaries would put us. The power of
the guerrillas is that they can start a widening chain reaction it is
almost impossible to prevent. The inescapable counter-measures
necessitated by a rash of bombings threatens to precipitate wider
clashes in the ghettos and on the campuses, mobilizing whole
communities in war with the police and the National Guard. One
looks on, helpless to avoid the collision one sees coming.
The panic, hysteria, and hate which may .soon be set loose can
hardly provide the crucible in which to create that New Man of whom
Mao and Che dreamed. The reforms society needs all require — no
matter under what "system" — an increase in every man's concern for
his fellows, a greater readiness to understand, to forgive and to share.
Without these qualities, communism has already failed. You cannot
beat men into angels, nor make them better by calling them "pigs."
But how do you preach to youth the sanctity of human life v/hen
established society, in its institutionalized violence and exploitation,
treats it so lightly? How often have we heard it said here in
Washington, in cold-blooded defense of bombing North Nietnam that
"hurting them" would force them to make peace? Now our country is
hurting.
Unreal Arithmetic
There is no moral arithmetic to cancel out the crime of murder.
But how do you answer those who say coolly of the young man who
died in that Army Mathematics building at Wisconsin, "What if he had
been drafted and died in Vietnam?" How do you restore the moral
bearings of the young when we now learn from the private papers in
the John F. Kennedy library that he and former Senator Smathers of
Florida on many occasions discussed the feasibility of arranging the
assassination of Fidel Castro? The craziest of our mixed-up kids are no
crazier than the end-justifies-the-means morality of American
imperialism.
Human society, as it grows more complex, grows more vulnerable.
Hijackings, bombings, snipers and political kidnappings; fedayeen,
Tupamaros, and Weathermen, all reflect the power this gives a
desperate few. But technology is not the essence of their power. At its
inner core is a sustaining moral indignation which gives these few the
strength to live and die as outlaws. They will not be stopped until this
inner sense of righteousness is undermined, and this can be done only
by society's willingness to take a fresh look at the morality of iis own
behavior, and to begin to right the wrongs which provoke th~
resistance. Isaiah says, "Zion shall be redeemed by justice." Rereading
that sublime poetry on vacation last August, I felt that the prophet
here offered us the cryptic key to the problem of terrorism
everywhere, in the Middle East as at home.
Society's moral weakness is its double standard. The sufferings of
the hijacked in the desert aroused world-wide sympathy and their
release worldwide relief. But how many stopped to think that several
hundred thousand of the Arab refugees from Palestine have been
living for two decades in a similar stinking horror in desert camps
stifling by day, freezing by night, on a beggar's pittance? The papers
are full of proposals to deal with the hijackers but little about the
need to deal with the grievances behind them. The editorial outburst
about Arab "barbarism" hardly accords with the testimony of all the
hijacked travellers — including the Israeli — that the commandos
treated them kindly. Such exaggeration is not the path to peace. I
covered the Jewish tenor against the British in Palestine in the
postwar '40s. I know that if the present situation were reversed, and
Jews were in the refugee camps, and no one cared, Jewish commandos
would be hijacking planes to call attention to their plight, and those
of us who are Jews would feel the same thrill over these exploits as
the Arabs do over theirs. What surer way to reconciliation than
honestly to recognize ourselves in the visage of our enemy'.
Deal With The Greivance
The permanent answer to the Arab hijackings was indicated
courageously by the Washington Post in an editorial Sept. 13, "A
Palestinian State Now." The way to deprive the fedayeen of their
motive force is to deal with the grievance which fuels it. The way to
deal with those who have nothing to lose is to give them something to
lose. To erect a Palestinian Arab state alongside the Jewish state
would be to redeem Zion by justice.
Men are moral beings, and to take from the terrorists their
moral justification is the only way to strike at the heart of the terror
spreading around the globe. A society operates by habit and consent,
and if these begin to break down, it is helpless. Police are effective
only if they confront occasional and peripheral disorder. If even a
sizeable minority declines to obey the rules, the task of law and order
becomes insuperable. This is especially true when the authorities
confront dedicated, scattered terrorists so loosely organized that they
are hard to infiltrate and cannot be crushed by striking at their head,
for they have no centralized direction. They are like the Hydra of
fable, which grew two new heads for each one Hercules cut off.
If by some miracle, we could acquire new leadership in the White
House, if that leadership recognized the evils of our society and
mobilized to deal with them, we could not only separate the mass of
the youth, the blacks, the Chicanos and the other discontened from
the desperadoes but deprive the desperadoes themselves of the
self-righteousness that sustains them. I imagine an America with a new
Roosevelt, with a President who said—and made us feel he meant
it—"We are embarking on a 10-year crusade to wipe out racism,
illiteracy, pollution, urban blight and war. To do so we are
withdrawing from Vietnam and cutting our military down to
bare-bones size. Come and help us build a new and shining America."
Hi ink what we could do with the zeal that now moves some of our
best youth to destruction

Washington, in cold-blooded defense of bombing North Nietnam that
"hurting them" would force them to make peace? Now our country is
hurting.
Unreal Arithmetic
There is no moral arithmetic to cancel out the crime of murder.
But how do you answer those who say coolly of the young man who
died in that Army Mathematics building at Wisconsin, "What if he had
been drafted and died in Vietnam?" How do you restore the moral
bearings of the young when we now learn from the private papers in
the John F. Kennedy library that he and former Senator Smathers of
Florida on many occasions discussed the feasibility of arranging the
assassination of Fidel Castro? The craziest of our mixed-up kids are no
crazier than the end-justifies-the-means morality of American
imperialism.
Human society, as it grows more complex, grows more vulnerable.
Hijackings, bombings, snipers and political kidnappings; fedayeen,
Tupamaros, and Weathermen, all reflect the power this gives a
desperate few. But technology is not the essence of their power. At its
inner core is a sustaining moral indignation which gives these few the
strength to live and die as outlaws. They will not be stopped until this
inner sense of righteousness is undermined, and this can be done only
by society's willingness to take a fresh look at the morality of iis own
behavior, and to begin to right the wrongs which provoke th~
resistance. Isaiah says, "Zion shall be redeemed by justice." Rereading
that sublime poetry on vacation last August, I felt that the prophet
here offered us the cryptic key to the problem of terrorism
everywhere, in the Middle East as at home.
Society's moral weakness is its double standard. The sufferings of
the hijacked in the desert aroused world-wide sympathy and their
release worldwide relief. But how many stopped to think that several
hundred thousand of the Arab refugees from Palestine have been
living for two decades in a similar stinking horror in desert camps
stifling by day, freezing by night, on a beggar's pittance? The papers
are full of proposals to deal with the hijackers but little about the
need to deal with the grievances behind them. The editorial outburst
about Arab "barbarism" hardly accords with the testimony of all the
hijacked travellers — including the Israeli — that the commandos
treated them kindly. Such exaggeration is not the path to peace. I
covered the Jewish tenor against the British in Palestine in the
postwar '40s. I know that if the present situation were reversed, and
Jews were in the refugee camps, and no one cared, Jewish commandos
would be hijacking planes to call attention to their plight, and those
of us who are Jews would feel the same thrill over these exploits as
the Arabs do over theirs. What surer way to reconciliation than
honestly to recognize ourselves in the visage of our enemy'.
Deal With The Greivance
The permanent answer to the Arab hijackings was indicated
courageously by the Washington Post in an editorial Sept. 13, "A
Palestinian State Now." The way to deprive the fedayeen of their
motive force is to deal with the grievance which fuels it. The way to
deal with those who have nothing to lose is to give them something to
lose. To erect a Palestinian Arab state alongside the Jewish state
would be to redeem Zion by justice.
Men are moral beings, and to take from the terrorists their
moral justification is the only way to strike at the heart of the terror
spreading around the globe. A society operates by habit and consent,
and if these begin to break down, it is helpless. Police are effective
only if they confront occasional and peripheral disorder. If even a
sizeable minority declines to obey the rules, the task of law and order
becomes insuperable. This is especially true when the authorities
confront dedicated, scattered terrorists so loosely organized that they
are hard to infiltrate and cannot be crushed by striking at their head,
for they have no centralized direction. They are like the Hydra of
fable, which grew two new heads for each one Hercules cut off.
If by some miracle, we could acquire new leadership in the White
House, if that leadership recognized the evils of our society and
mobilized to deal with them, we could not only separate the mass of
the youth, the blacks, the Chicanos and the other discontened from
the desperadoes but deprive the desperadoes themselves of the
self-righteousness that sustains them. I imagine an America with a new
Roosevelt, with a President who said—and made us feel he meant
it—"We are embarking on a 10-year crusade to wipe out racism,
illiteracy, pollution, urban blight and war. To do so we are
withdrawing from Vietnam and cutting our military down to
bare-bones size. Come and help us build a new and shining America."
Hi ink what we could do with the zeal that now moves some of our
best youth to destruction

(Editor's note: The following is from the Sept. 21 issue of I.F.
Stone's Bi-Weekly.)
As a young newspaperman during the world depression I never felt
the despair I am beginning to feel now about the future of our
country. When I try to analyze the difference I think one reason is
that then even the revolutionaries had rational goals, not just a blind
frustrated urge to destroy. And, of course, the election of 1932 soon
provided a fresh, electric and responsive leadership. It was as if in
1968 McCarthy of Bobby Kennedy had won the election and
transformed despair into hope overnight.
Today there is a loss of confidence that extends into every sector
of society, even those which usually find it reassuring to have a
Republican President. The feeble little stock boomlet that Nixon and
the Federal Reserve are trying to pump up for November, at the
expense of letting up on the fight against inflation, barely covers over
a precarious business situation. The banks are carrying on their books
many businesses which are overripe for the bankruptcy courts, lest a
general collapse engulf the banks with them. The social landscape does
not encourage long-range investment. Black and chicano minorities are
in revolt, and an urban guerrilla movement confronts us in the cities
and on the campuses. Another Kent State could set off a tidal wave of
violence on the nation's campuses. The police have become targets for
snipers, as have firemen. Guns are ready everywhere. A tiny minority
of firebrand youngsters is making good on its threat to "bring the war
home."

i. 112. stone

It begins to look as if it may be easy to break down the fabric of
American society. To rebuild it will be very hard. Anarchy and
barbarity, race war and gang rule, not Utopia, lie at the end of the
road on which our instant revolutionaries would put us. The power of
the guerrillas is that they can start a widening chain reaction it is
almost impossible to prevent. The inescapable counter-measures
necessitated by a rash of bombings threatens to precipitate wider
clashes in the ghettos and on the campuses, mobilizing whole
communities in war with the police and the National Guard. One
looks on, helpless to avoid the collision one sees coming.
The panic, hysteria, and hate which may .soon be set loose can
hardly provide the crucible in which to create that New Man of whom
Mao and Che dreamed. The reforms society needs all require — no
matter under what "system" — an increase in every man's concern for
his fellows, a greater readiness to understand, to forgive and to share.
Without these qualities, communism has already failed. You cannot
beat men into angels, nor make them better by calling them "pigs."
But how do you preach to youth the sanctity of human life v/hen
established society, in its institutionalized violence and exploitation,
treats it so lightly? How often have we heard it said here in
Washington, in cold-blooded defense of bombing North Nietnam that
"hurting them" would force them to make peace? Now our country is

The permanent answer to the Arab hijackings was indicated
courageously by the Washington Post in an editorial Sept. 13, "A
Palestinian State Now." The way to deprive the fedayeen of their
motive force is to deal with the grievance which fuels it. The way to
deal with those who have nothing to lose is to give them something to
lose. To erect a Palestinian Arab state alongside the Jewish state
would be to redeem Zion by justice.
Men are moral beings, and to take from the terrorists their
moral justification is the only way to strike at the heart of the terror
spreading around the globe. A society operates by habit and consent,
and if these begin to break down, it is helpless. Police are effective
only if they confront occasional and peripheral disorder. If even a
sizeable minority declines to obey the rules, the task of law and order
becomes insuperable. This is especially true when the authorities
confront dedicated, scattered terrorists so loosely organized that they
are hard to infiltrate and cannot be crushed by striking at their head,
for they have no centralized direction. They are like the Hydra of
fable, which grew two new heads for each one Hercules cut off.
If by some miracle, we could acquire new leadership in the White
House, if that leadership recognized the evils of our society and
mobilized to deal with them, we could not only separate the mass of
the youth, the blacks, the Chicanos and the other discontened from
the desperadoes but deprive the desperadoes themselves of the
self-righteousness that sustains them. I imagine an America with a new
Roosevelt, with a President who said—and made us feel he meant
it—"We are embarking on a 10-year crusade to wipe out racism,
illiteracy, pollution, urban blight and war. To do so we are
withdrawing from Vietnam and cutting our military down to
bare-bones size. Come and help us build a new and shining America."
Hi ink what we could do with the zeal that now moves some of our
best youth to destruction

(Editor's note: The following is from the Sept. 21 issue of I.F.
Stone's Bi-Weekly.)
As a young newspaperman during the world depression I never felt
the despair I am beginning to feel now about the future of our
country. When I try to analyze the difference I think one reason is
that then even the revolutionaries had rational goals, not just a blind
frustrated urge to destroy. And, of course, the election of 1932 soon
provided a fresh, electric and responsive leadership. It was as if in
1968 McCarthy of Bobby Kennedy had won the election and
transformed despair into hope overnight.
Today there is a loss of confidence that extends into every sector
of society, even those which usually find it reassuring to have a
Republican President. The feeble little stock boomlet that Nixon and
the Federal Reserve are trying to pump up for November, at the
expense of letting up on the fight against inflation, barely covers over
a precarious business situation. The banks are carrying on their books
many businesses which are overripe for the bankruptcy courts, lest a
general collapse engulf the banks with them. The social landscape does
not encourage long-range investment. Black and chicano minorities are
in revolt, and an urban guerrilla movement confronts us in the cities
and on the campuses. Another Kent State could set off a tidal wave of
violence on the nation's campuses. The police have become targets for
snipers, as have firemen. Guns are ready everywhere. A tiny minority
of firebrand youngsters is making good on its threat to "bring the war
home."

i. 112. stone

It begins to look as if it may be easy to break down the fabric of
American society. To rebuild it will be very hard. Anarchy and
barbarity, race war and gang rule, not Utopia, lie at the end of the
road on which our instant revolutionaries would put us. The power of
the guerrillas is that they can start a widening chain reaction it is
almost impossible to prevent. The inescapable counter-measures
necessitated by a rash of bombings threatens to precipitate wider
clashes in the ghettos and on the campuses, mobilizing whole
communities in war with the police and the National Guard. One
looks on, helpless to avoid the collision one sees coming.
The panic, hysteria, and hate which may .soon be set loose can
hardly provide the crucible in which to create that New Man of whom
Mao and Che dreamed. The reforms society needs all require — no
matter under what "system" — an increase in every man's concern for
his fellows, a greater readiness to understand, to forgive and to share.
Without these qualities, communism has already failed. You cannot
beat men into angels, nor make them better by calling them "pigs."
But how do you preach to youth the sanctity of human life v/hen
established society, in its institutionalized violence and exploitation,
treats it so lightly? How often have we heard it said here in
Washington, in cold-blooded defense of bombing North Nietnam that
"hurting them" would force them to make peace? Now our country is
hurting.
Unreal Arithmetic
There is no moral arithmetic to cancel out the crime of murder.
But how do you answer those who say coolly of the young man who
died in that Army Mathematics building at Wisconsin, "What if he had
been drafted and died in Vietnam?" How do you restore the moral
bearings of the young when we now learn from the private papers in
the John F. Kennedy library that he and former Senator Smathers of
Florida on many occasions discussed the feasibility of arranging the
assassination of Fidel Castro? The craziest of our mixed-up kids are no
crazier than the end-justifies-the-means morality of American
imperialism.
Human society, as it grows more complex, grows more vulnerable.
Hijackings, bombings, snipers and political kidnappings; fedayeen,
Tupamaros, and Weathermen, all reflect the power this gives a
desperate few. But technology is not the essence of their power. At its
inner core is a sustaining moral indignation which gives these few the
strength to live and die as outlaws. They will not be stopped until this
inner sense of righteousness is undermined, and this can be done only
by society's willingness to take a fresh look at the morality of iis own
behavior, and to begin to right the wrongs which provoke th~
resistance. Isaiah says, "Zion shall be redeemed by justice." Rereading
that sublime poetry on vacation last August, I felt that the prophet
here offered us the cryptic key to the problem of terrorism
everywhere, in the Middle East as at home.
Society's moral weakness is its double standard. The sufferings of
the hijacked in the desert aroused world-wide sympathy and their
release worldwide relief. But how many stopped to think that several
hundred thousand of the Arab refugees from Palestine have been
living for two decades in a similar stinking horror in desert camps
stifling by day, freezing by night, on a beggar's pittance? The papers
are full of proposals to deal with the hijackers but little about the
need to deal with the grievances behind them. The editorial outburst
about Arab "barbarism" hardly accords with the testimony of all the
hijacked travellers — including the Israeli — that the commandos
treated them kindly. Such exaggeration is not the path to peace. I
covered the Jewish tenor against the British in Palestine in the
postwar '40s. I know that if the present situation were reversed, and
Jews were in the refugee camps, and no one cared, Jewish commandos
would be hijacking planes to call attention to their plight, and those
of us who are Jews would feel the same thrill over these exploits as
the Arabs do over theirs. What surer way to reconciliation than
honestly to recognize ourselves in the visage of our enemy'.

the Federal Reserve are trying to pump up for November, at the
expense of letting up on the fight against inflation, barely covers over
a precarious business situation. The banks are carrying on their books
many businesses which are overripe for the bankruptcy courts, lest a
general collapse engulf the banks with them. The social landscape does
not encourage long-range investment. Black and chicano minorities are
in revolt, and an urban guerrilla movement confronts us in the cities
and on the campuses. Another Kent State could set off a tidal wave of
violence on the nation's campuses. The police have become targets for
snipers, as have firemen. Guns are ready everywhere. A tiny minority
of firebrand youngsters is making good on its threat to "bring the war
home."

It begins to look as if it may be easy to break down the fabric of
American society. To rebuild it will be very hard. Anarchy and
barbarity, race war and gang rule, not Utopia, lie at the end of the
road on which our instant revolutionaries would put us. The power of
the guerrillas is that they can start a widening chain reaction it is
almost impossible to prevent. The inescapable counter-measures
necessitated by a rash of bombings threatens to precipitate wider
clashes in the ghettos and on the campuses, mobilizing whole
communities in war with the police and the National Guard. One
looks on, helpless to avoid the collision one sees coming.
The panic, hysteria, and hate which may .soon be set loose can
hardly provide the crucible in which to create that New Man of whom
Mao and Che dreamed. The reforms society needs all require — no
matter under what "system" — an increase in every man's concern for
his fellows, a greater readiness to understand, to forgive and to share.
Without these qualities, communism has already failed. You cannot
beat men into angels, nor make them better by calling them "pigs."
But how do you preach to youth the sanctity of human life v/hen
established society, in its institutionalized violence and exploitation,
treats it so lightly? How often have we heard it said here in
Washington, in cold-blooded defense of bombing North Nietnam that
"hurting them" would force them to make peace? Now our country is
hurting.
Unreal Arithmetic
There is no moral arithmetic to cancel out the crime of murder.
But how do you answer those who say coolly of the young man who
died in that Army Mathematics building at Wisconsin, "What if he had
been drafted and died in Vietnam?" How do you restore the moral
bearings of the young when we now learn from the private papers in
the John F. Kennedy library that he and former Senator Smathers of
Florida on many occasions discussed the feasibility of arranging the
assassination of Fidel Castro? The craziest of our mixed-up kids are no
crazier than the end-justifies-the-means morality of American
imperialism.
Human society, as it grows more complex, grows more vulnerable.
Hijackings, bombings, snipers and political kidnappings; fedayeen,
Tupamaros, and Weathermen, all reflect the power this gives a
desperate few. But technology is not the essence of their power. At its
inner core is a sustaining moral indignation which gives these few the
strength to live and die as outlaws. They will not be stopped until this
inner sense of righteousness is undermined, and this can be done only
by society's willingness to take a fresh look at the morality of iis own
behavior, and to begin to right the wrongs which provoke th~
resistance. Isaiah says, "Zion shall be redeemed by justice." Rereading
that sublime poetry on vacation last August, I felt that the prophet
here offered us the cryptic key to the problem of terrorism
everywhere, in the Middle East as at home.
Society's moral weakness is its double standard. The sufferings of
the hijacked in the desert aroused world-wide sympathy and their
release worldwide relief. But how many stopped to think that several
hundred thousand of the Arab refugees from Palestine have been
living for two decades in a similar stinking horror in desert camps
stifling by day, freezing by night, on a beggar's pittance? The papers
are full of proposals to deal with the hijackers but little about the
need to deal with the grievances behind them. The editorial outburst
about Arab "barbarism" hardly accords with the testimony of all the
hijacked travellers — including the Israeli — that the commandos
treated them kindly. Such exaggeration is not the path to peace. I
covered the Jewish tenor against the British in Palestine in the
postwar '40s. I know that if the present situation were reversed, and
Jews were in the refugee camps, and no one cared, Jewish commandos
would be hijacking planes to call attention to their plight, and those
of us who are Jews would feel the same thrill over these exploits as
the Arabs do over theirs. What surer way to reconciliation than
honestly to recognize ourselves in the visage of our enemy'.
Deal With The Greivance
The permanent answer to the Arab hijackings was indicated
courageously by the Washington Post in an editorial Sept. 13, "A
Palestinian State Now." The way to deprive the fedayeen of their
motive force is to deal with the grievance which fuels it. The way to
deal with those who have nothing to lose is to give them something to
lose. To erect a Palestinian Arab state alongside the Jewish state
would be to redeem Zion by justice.
Men are moral beings, and to take from the terrorists their
moral justification is the only way to strike at the heart of the terror
spreading around the globe. A society operates by habit and consent,
and if these begin to break down, it is helpless. Police are effective
only if they confront occasional and peripheral disorder. If even a
sizeable minority declines to obey the rules, the task of law and order
becomes insuperable. This is especially true when the authorities
confront dedicated, scattered terrorists so loosely organized that they
are hard to infiltrate and cannot be crushed by striking at their head,
for they have no centralized direction. They are like the Hydra of
fable, which grew two new heads for each one Hercules cut off.
If by some miracle, we could acquire new leadership in the White
House, if that leadership recognized the evils of our society and
mobilized to deal with them, we could not only separate the mass of
the youth, the blacks, the Chicanos and the other discontened from
the desperadoes but deprive the desperadoes themselves of the
self-righteousness that sustains them. I imagine an America with a new
Roosevelt, with a President who said—and made us feel he meant
it—"We are embarking on a 10-year crusade to wipe out racism,
illiteracy, pollution, urban blight and war. To do so we are
withdrawing from Vietnam and cutting our military down to
bare-bones size. Come and help us build a new and shining America."
Hi ink what we could do with the zeal that now moves some of our
best youth to destruction

Stone's Bi-Weekly.)
As a young newspaperman during the world depression I never felt
the despair I am beginning to feel now about the future of our
country. When I try to analyze the difference I think one reason is
that then even the revolutionaries had rational goals, not just a blind
frustrated urge to destroy. And, of course, the election of 1932 soon
provided a fresh, electric and responsive leadership. It was as if in
1968 McCarthy of Bobby Kennedy had won the election and
transformed despair into hope overnight.
Today there is a loss of confidence that extends into every sector
of society, even those which usually find it reassuring to have a
Republican President. The feeble little stock boomlet that Nixon and
the Federal Reserve are trying to pump up for November, at the
expense of letting up on the fight against inflation, barely covers over
a precarious business situation. The banks are carrying on their books
many businesses which are overripe for the bankruptcy courts, lest a
