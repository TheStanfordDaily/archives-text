## Free Speech For Real? 
### 
One of the conditions of working in the defense
industry is the absence of free speech. This is a
result of the government's concern about security
leaks coupled with the paranoid personalities of
the individuals who typically rise to management
positions in defense.
After the Cambodian invasion last spring
engineers in several Peninsula companies
attempted to raise the political consciousness of
their fellow workers by leafletting and holding
informational forums on company premises during
lunch hours. With few exceptions their requests
were denied by management, which seems
committed to the peculiar notion that their
companies are non-political institutions serving the
government's needs. Most engineers who dared to
leaflet outside their companies were soon
threatened with layoffs if they continued.
The extent to which defense companies will
suppress any form of employee dissent is
sometimes hard to believe. There appeared in the
Palo Alto Times an advertisement signed by about
200 scientists and engineers expressing respectful
opposition to Nixon's decision to invade
Cambodia. Several weeks later, a group (not
connected with the ad) consisting of Stanford
computer science students and peninsula engineers
sponsored a teach-in on the war in Indochina, held
jluring lunch hour in a Sunnyvale park.
It was attended by about 100 engineers,
including several from a prominent defense
contractor to which I shall refer as Standard
Electronics. One of them noticed at the teach-in a
Standard security guard in plainclothes, who

appeared to be comparing the faces of those
present with a collection of small photographs he
had brought with him.
Subsequent events disclosed alarming facts.
Apparently someone in Standard's security
department had recorded the names of the
Standard employees who had signed the ad in the
P.A. Times. When the teach-in was announced
several weeks later, Standard decided to find out
which of their employees would attend, and sent
the guard with photographs of those who had
signed the ad. A week later Standard's managers
received lists of those engineers in their
departments who had attended the teach-in.
Frequently an engineer's freedom to express
himself is determined more by the political
attitudes of his superiors than by established
corporate policy. At the Lockheed Missies & Space
Co. in Sunnyvale, an engineer whom I shall call
Mr. Jones grew irritated during his five years of
continuous employment there at the racist jokes
and statements of his co-workers and supervisor.
During this time he was becoming involved in civil
rights activities through his church, and recently
he decided to invite his supervisor and an
upper-level manager (Mr. Smith) to a seminar on
minority employment he was giving there. Neither
man came, but Jones received a layoff notice
shortly thereafter.

University-Military-Industrial Police Complex by
Archimedes, a former graduate student in
electrical ennineerinn, and a member of the New
Left Project.)
