Nixon's Proposals
Editor, THE DAILY:
The longer the Vietnam war
goes on, the dimmer its original
causes become to most
Americans. In his speeches on the
war President Nixon has
consistently depended on the fact
that most of his listeners either

cannot remember, or never knew,
why Indochina became a bloody
battleground after 1956. In his
famous "Vietnarnization" speech
of Nov. 3, 1969, he referred to a
massacre in North Vietnam that
never took place, and blamed the
war on North Vietnamese
aggression, although North
Vietnam's troops didn't move
south until well after the fighting
began and only after U.S. forces
were already on the scene.
Now President Nixon has
responded to the other side's
recent peace proposal with an
offer of a cease-fire, exchange of
war prisoners, and the possiblity
of an eventual withdrawal of all
U.S. troops from Vietnam. But he
stood adamant on the one issue
that is crucial to peace in
Indochina: American support of
the puppet government in Saigon.
In 195 4 we installed Ngo Dinh
Diem as head of the Saigon
regime. Backed by billions of
dollars in U.S. aid, Diem pluged
his country into corruption,
destroyed the traditional structure
of local government, imprisoned
tens of thousands of South
Vietnamese citizens for political
"crimes", executed untold
numbers of them and sent
thousands into exile. When his
tyranny became intolerable and it
appeared evident that the
elections called for by the Geneva
agreements would never be held,
South Vietnamese opposition to
the Diem regime burst into open
warfare.
Since Diem's assassination in
1963 the U.S. has supported his
successors with steadily increasing
firepower, until today South
Vietnam's hardwood forests are
denuded wastes, its hills are bared
and leveled, thousands of villages
are in ruins and their inhabitants
in refugee camps, the countryside
is scarred with bomb craters, farm
land has been made sterile, and
millions of human beings have
been killed or crippled. Once
beautiful Cambodia is being

pounded daily by our bombers
and "there are no towns left in
Laos", according to a report in
this morning's newspaper. Last
week, while President Nixon was
telling the Yugoslavs, the British,
the Spaniards and the Irish about
his devotion to peace, our planes
were flying 700 bombing sorties a
day over Laos.
I fervently hope that North
Vietnam and the NLF will accept
the offer of an immediate
cease-fire, so that the killing and
the terror can stop. But it seems
absurd to expect that after all
these years of agony they will
agree to a settlement that would
involve keeping America's puppet
dictators, Thieu and Ky, in power.
Were the other side to accept
Nixon's proposal they would have
gained nothing for all their
sacrifice. Since the President said
he would stand firm in support of
the Saigon generals, his "peace
proposal" may have been only the
more consummately sknuul act of
public relations.

How come only two pictures
of Bruce Franklin in Friday's
Daily? This fighting Prof, deserves
more, much more: The last time I
saw him was actually at a fistfight
early this summer. His gang of
Revolutionary Unionists were
beating the crap out of a smaller
gang of Progressive Laborites who.,
had tried to pass out leaflets at
Tresidder. One of the R.U. girls
explained to me "that nobody
wanted their leaflets anyway",
but as usual Bruce had a better
explanation: "They beat up one
of our girls with a tire iron last
week." Incidentally his side won
the fight, and we weren't pestered
with any more P.L. leaflets all
summer.

battleground after 1956. In his
famous "Vietnarnization" speech
of Nov. 3, 1969, he referred to a
massacre in North Vietnam that
never took place, and blamed the
war on North Vietnamese
aggression, although North
Vietnam's troops didn't move
south until well after the fighting
began and only after U.S. forces
were already on the scene.
Now President Nixon has
responded to the other side's
recent peace proposal with an
offer of a cease-fire, exchange of
war prisoners, and the possiblity
of an eventual withdrawal of all
U.S. troops from Vietnam. But he
stood adamant on the one issue
that is crucial to peace in
Indochina: American support of
the puppet government in Saigon.
In 195 4 we installed Ngo Dinh
Diem as head of the Saigon
regime. Backed by billions of
dollars in U.S. aid, Diem pluged
his country into corruption,
destroyed the traditional structure
of local government, imprisoned
tens of thousands of South
Vietnamese citizens for political
"crimes", executed untold
numbers of them and sent
thousands into exile. When his
tyranny became intolerable and it
appeared evident that the
elections called for by the Geneva
agreements would never be held,
South Vietnamese opposition to
the Diem regime burst into open
warfare.
Since Diem's assassination in
1963 the U.S. has supported his
successors with steadily increasing
firepower, until today South
Vietnam's hardwood forests are
denuded wastes, its hills are bared
and leveled, thousands of villages
are in ruins and their inhabitants
in refugee camps, the countryside
is scarred with bomb craters, farm
land has been made sterile, and
millions of human beings have
been killed or crippled. Once
beautiful Cambodia is being

pounded daily by our bombers
and "there are no towns left in
Laos", according to a report in
this morning's newspaper. Last
week, while President Nixon was
telling the Yugoslavs, the British,
the Spaniards and the Irish about
his devotion to peace, our planes
were flying 700 bombing sorties a
day over Laos.
I fervently hope that North
Vietnam and the NLF will accept
the offer of an immediate
cease-fire, so that the killing and
the terror can stop. But it seems
absurd to expect that after all
these years of agony they will
agree to a settlement that would
involve keeping America's puppet
dictators, Thieu and Ky, in power.
Were the other side to accept
Nixon's proposal they would have
gained nothing for all their
sacrifice. Since the President said
he would stand firm in support of
the Saigon generals, his "peace
proposal" may have been only the
more consummately sknuul act of
public relations.
