## Colin Pittendrigh—'Larger Than Life' 
### BROOKE SHEARER 
After only one quarter ol
teaching at Stanford, Biology
Professor Colin S. Pittendrigh is
supposed to be one of the most
popular teachers on campus.
"Pittendrigh," says one
collegue, "is larger than life. He's
not afraid to be emotional.
You've heard his lectures, you
know what I mean. To my mind
he is one of the greatest lecturers
in Biology, and 1 studied under
George Wald ... He has the same
enthusiasm in his private life as he
does in his lectures ... He pulls
people along with him. He's one

of the most lovable people I
know."
One Ph.D. candidate says,
"He's a truly charming man. He
has a wandering, inquisitive mind.
I'd call him a Rennaissance Man,
but that's not quite right."
Pittendrigh, or Pitt, as his
collegues call him, came to
Stanford's Biology Department
last fall after 22 years at
Princeton, four of which he spent
as Dean of Princeton's Graduate
School.
"I got tired of deaning," says
Pitt, "I didn't have all the talents
that a dean should have such as,
keeping one's temper and keeping

the stacks of paper off of one's
desk. Besides I wanted to get back
to teaching.
Not Sure
"I'm excited about the Human
Biology program. It was one of
the attractive things in coming
here. I am, however, worried
about it. Nobody has ever done
such a program before. We're not
sure what ought to be done. We
all have intuitive feelings, but we
need more faculty discussion
among the six or seven of us who
are teaching. We're going to have u
go around the circuit once or
twice before we thoroughly know
what we're doing."

After two decades of teaching
Princeton men, Pitt's first reaction
to Stanford was in response to its
coeds. "There was an uptightness
al Princeton," he says. "Which is
not evident here. The social life is
more relaxed here but the
stiffness at Princeton will
probably evaporate very quickly
now that they have gone coed."
Pitt criticizes Stanford's
advising system, which he claims
is "wholly inadequate. Students
and faculty don't know the facts
or requirements and students are
misinformed about what to take
when. People seem to wander
around all over the place."
Clocks
Pittendrigh, 52, is an authority
on the physiological rhythms in
plants and animals called
"biological clocks." These
oscillations function in
approximately 24-hour cycles and
regulate the heart rate, body
temperature and various other
aspects of metabolism in all living
organisms.
"Pitt is personally responsible
for putting the field of 'biological
clocks' on solid footing," says
Donald Kennedy, chairman of the
Biology Department. He has set
up a nine-man lab and is centering
his research on two questions-1 )
What controls the innate
"biological clocks," and 2 ) What
arethey for - i.e. what do they
measure?
To illustrate the meaning of
"biological clocks" Pittendrigh
uses the starling. "They have
annual clocks," he explains, "as
do a number of other creatures. If
we place them in conditions of
constant temperature and
constant light, they grow,
reproduce in the Spring, and
behave as they would normally if
they had all the cues from the
outside. A similar clock measures
time for chrysanthemums,
migrating birds and animals which
hibernate."
Botany Honors
The son of an English
boiler-maker, Pitt attended British
public schools, graduating with
first class honors in botany from
the University of Durham in
1910. He earned a second degree

in Trinidad and worked in a
Malaria Research Station there for
three years.
After serving as an advisor to
the Brazilian government on
malaria problems, he went to
study at Columbia University.
There he worked under the noted
evolutionist and geneticist,
Theodore Dobzhansky. "He was
the most inspiring lecturer I ever
had," says Pitt.
He finished his dissertation in
19-18 and joined the Princeton
faculty as an assistant professor.
In 1 95 0 he became an associate
professor and a U.S. citizen.
"Among the reasons why 1 was
nationalized," he explains, "is my
wife. She was a New Yorker.
Another reason was that one of
my parents was dead and the
other died while I was at
Columbia, so there was no one to
pull me back home. Also, there
were more opportunities in
America. I was happy to get out
of the academic class system in
England. I didn't attend Oxford
or Cambridge, so I had little
chance of a career in the British
university system."
In 1943, the 25 year-old
Pittendrigh married a girl three
years out of Barnard College.
Margaret Pittendrigh, seven
months his senior, followed her
husband to Trinidad. The next
year she gave birth to their first of
two children, a daughter they
named Robin.
Robin, now 26, is teaching and
studying for a Masters in Fine
Arts in Boulder, Colorado. Their
son, 2 2 year-old Sandy, is married
and lives in Palo Alto. His wife is
expecting a child next month.
Although the Pittendrigh house
is empty of offspring, "it is so
crowded all the time that it's like
a hotel," claims Mrs. Pittendrigh.
"We have old friends from
Princeton and professional people
visiting us all the time."
Mrs. Pittendrigh also writes
short stories. "If I have the time I
want to send off a mystery story
which I've completed to a fiction
magazine," she says, "but right
now I don't have even the time to
write a cover letter." Mrs.
Pittendrigh drives a jeep wagon,
refusing "to buy another new car

until a new engine has been
designed which will be able to run
on lead-free gasoline. And
besides," she adds, "the heavy
jeep reminds of of our cabin in
Montana, where we spend
vacations and Colin fishes for
trout."
Her husband, a model worthy
of admiration to many, has no
heroes of his own. "1 try to avoid
hero worship," he says. "There
are no public figures in the world
at large who turn me on. People
whom 1 respect are John Gardner
and Robert Goheen (a classics
professor who became President
of Princeton at 37 )."
Popular Core
This fall he lectures on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
at 9 a.m. and again at 5 p.m. on
Monday evenings, each time to a
Cubberley Auditorium crowded
with undergraduates in the

Human Biology program. Last
Spring he taught "Man and
Nature" to an oversized class of
427.
This course was the first series
of four core courses which
comprise the Human Biology
Program, which he helped to
design. The program has replaced
Western Civilization, as an
undergraduate "must." More
students elect the core biology
series, now that they are free from
the Western Civ. requirement,
than any other core courses in the
University. Two-thirds of last
year's Sophomore class registered
for the program.
Pitt's explanation for students'
preference for the life sciences is
their interest in "man—his
functions, behavior, evolution and
social patterns. Such information
is mory desirable as essential than
recorded history. We don't seem
to learn much from history, do
we?" he adds.

last fall after 22 years at
Princeton, four of which he spent
as Dean of Princeton's Graduate
School.
"I got tired of deaning," says
Pitt, "I didn't have all the talents
that a dean should have such as,
keeping one's temper and keeping

the stacks of paper off of one's
desk. Besides I wanted to get back
to teaching.
Not Sure
"I'm excited about the Human
Biology program. It was one of
the attractive things in coming
here. I am, however, worried
about it. Nobody has ever done
such a program before. We're not
sure what ought to be done. We
all have intuitive feelings, but we
need more faculty discussion
among the six or seven of us who
are teaching. We're going to have u
go around the circuit once or
twice before we thoroughly know
what we're doing."

After two decades of teaching
Princeton men, Pitt's first reaction
to Stanford was in response to its
coeds. "There was an uptightness
al Princeton," he says. "Which is
not evident here. The social life is
more relaxed here but the
stiffness at Princeton will
probably evaporate very quickly
now that they have gone coed."
Pitt criticizes Stanford's
advising system, which he claims
is "wholly inadequate. Students
and faculty don't know the facts
or requirements and students are
misinformed about what to take
when. People seem to wander
around all over the place."
Clocks
Pittendrigh, 52, is an authority
on the physiological rhythms in
plants and animals called
"biological clocks." These
oscillations function in
approximately 24-hour cycles and
regulate the heart rate, body
temperature and various other
aspects of metabolism in all living
organisms.
"Pitt is personally responsible
for putting the field of 'biological
clocks' on solid footing," says
Donald Kennedy, chairman of the
Biology Department. He has set
up a nine-man lab and is centering
his research on two questions-1 )
What controls the innate
"biological clocks," and 2 ) What
arethey for - i.e. what do they
measure?
To illustrate the meaning of
"biological clocks" Pittendrigh
uses the starling. "They have
annual clocks," he explains, "as
do a number of other creatures. If
we place them in conditions of
constant temperature and
constant light, they grow,
reproduce in the Spring, and
behave as they would normally if
they had all the cues from the
outside. A similar clock measures
time for chrysanthemums,
migrating birds and animals which
hibernate."
Botany Honors
The son of an English
boiler-maker, Pitt attended British
public schools, graduating with
first class honors in botany from
the University of Durham in
1910. He earned a second degree

in Trinidad and worked in a
Malaria Research Station there for
three years.
After serving as an advisor to
the Brazilian government on
malaria problems, he went to
study at Columbia University.
There he worked under the noted
evolutionist and geneticist,
Theodore Dobzhansky. "He was
the most inspiring lecturer I ever
had," says Pitt.
He finished his dissertation in
19-18 and joined the Princeton
faculty as an assistant professor.
In 1 95 0 he became an associate
professor and a U.S. citizen.
"Among the reasons why 1 was
nationalized," he explains, "is my
wife. She was a New Yorker.
Another reason was that one of
my parents was dead and the
other died while I was at
Columbia, so there was no one to
pull me back home. Also, there
were more opportunities in
America. I was happy to get out
of the academic class system in
England. I didn't attend Oxford
or Cambridge, so I had little
chance of a career in the British
university system."
In 1943, the 25 year-old
Pittendrigh married a girl three
years out of Barnard College.
Margaret Pittendrigh, seven
months his senior, followed her
husband to Trinidad. The next
year she gave birth to their first of
two children, a daughter they
named Robin.
Robin, now 26, is teaching and
studying for a Masters in Fine
Arts in Boulder, Colorado. Their
son, 2 2 year-old Sandy, is married
and lives in Palo Alto. His wife is
expecting a child next month.
Although the Pittendrigh house
is empty of offspring, "it is so
crowded all the time that it's like
a hotel," claims Mrs. Pittendrigh.
"We have old friends from
Princeton and professional people
visiting us all the time."
Mrs. Pittendrigh also writes
short stories. "If I have the time I
want to send off a mystery story
which I've completed to a fiction
magazine," she says, "but right
now I don't have even the time to
write a cover letter." Mrs.
Pittendrigh drives a jeep wagon,
refusing "to buy another new car

until a new engine has been
designed which will be able to run
on lead-free gasoline. And
besides," she adds, "the heavy
jeep reminds of of our cabin in
Montana, where we spend
vacations and Colin fishes for
trout."
Her husband, a model worthy
of admiration to many, has no
heroes of his own. "1 try to avoid
hero worship," he says. "There
are no public figures in the world
at large who turn me on. People
whom 1 respect are John Gardner
and Robert Goheen (a classics
professor who became President
of Princeton at 37 )."
Popular Core
This fall he lectures on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
at 9 a.m. and again at 5 p.m. on
Monday evenings, each time to a
Cubberley Auditorium crowded
with undergraduates in the

Human Biology program. Last
Spring he taught "Man and
Nature" to an oversized class of
427.
This course was the first series
of four core courses which
comprise the Human Biology
Program, which he helped to
design. The program has replaced
Western Civilization, as an
undergraduate "must." More
students elect the core biology
series, now that they are free from
the Western Civ. requirement,
than any other core courses in the
University. Two-thirds of last
year's Sophomore class registered
for the program.
Pitt's explanation for students'
preference for the life sciences is
their interest in "man—his
functions, behavior, evolution and
social patterns. Such information
is mory desirable as essential than
recorded history. We don't seem
to learn much from history, do
we?" he adds.


Colin Pittendrigh
After only one quarter ol
teaching at Stanford, Biology
Professor Colin S. Pittendrigh is
supposed to be one of the most
popular teachers on campus.
"Pittendrigh," says one
collegue, "is larger than life. He's

he is one of the greatest lecturers
in Biology, and 1 studied under
George Wald ... He has the same
enthusiasm in his private life as he

people along with him. He's one

of the most lovable people I

"He's a truly charming man. He

to Stanford was in response to its
coeds. "There was an uptightness
al Princeton," he says. "Which is
not evident here. The social life is
more relaxed here but the
stiffness at Princeton will
probably evaporate very quickly
now that they have gone coed."
Pitt criticizes Stanford's
advising system, which he claims
is "wholly inadequate. Students
and faculty don't know the facts
or requirements and students are
misinformed about what to take
when. People seem to wander
around all over the place."
Clocks
Pittendrigh, 52, is an authority
on the physiological rhythms in
plants and animals called
"biological clocks." These
oscillations function in
approximately 24-hour cycles and
regulate the heart rate, body
temperature and various other
aspects of metabolism in all living
organisms.
"Pitt is personally responsible
for putting the field of 'biological
clocks' on solid footing," says
Donald Kennedy, chairman of the
Biology Department. He has set
up a nine-man lab and is centering
his research on two questions-1 )
What controls the innate
"biological clocks," and 2 ) What
arethey for - i.e. what do they
measure?
To illustrate the meaning of
"biological clocks" Pittendrigh
uses the starling. "They have
annual clocks," he explains, "as
do a number of other creatures. If
we place them in conditions of
constant temperature and
constant light, they grow,
reproduce in the Spring, and
behave as they would normally if
they had all the cues from the
outside. A similar clock measures
time for chrysanthemums,
migrating birds and animals which
hibernate."
Botany Honors
The son of an English
boiler-maker, Pitt attended British
public schools, graduating with
first class honors in botany from
the University of Durham in
1910. He earned a second degree

in Trinidad and worked in a
Malaria Research Station there for
three years.
After serving as an advisor to
the Brazilian government on
malaria problems, he went to
study at Columbia University.
There he worked under the noted
evolutionist and geneticist,
Theodore Dobzhansky. "He was
the most inspiring lecturer I ever
had," says Pitt.
He finished his dissertation in
19-18 and joined the Princeton
faculty as an assistant professor.
In 1 95 0 he became an associate
professor and a U.S. citizen.
"Among the reasons why 1 was
nationalized," he explains, "is my
wife. She was a New Yorker.
Another reason was that one of
my parents was dead and the
other died while I was at
Columbia, so there was no one to
pull me back home. Also, there
were more opportunities in
America. I was happy to get out
of the academic class system in
England. I didn't attend Oxford
or Cambridge, so I had little
chance of a career in the British
university system."
In 1943, the 25 year-old
Pittendrigh married a girl three
years out of Barnard College.
Margaret Pittendrigh, seven
months his senior, followed her
husband to Trinidad. The next
year she gave birth to their first of
two children, a daughter they
named Robin.
Robin, now 26, is teaching and
studying for a Masters in Fine
Arts in Boulder, Colorado. Their
son, 2 2 year-old Sandy, is married
and lives in Palo Alto. His wife is
expecting a child next month.
Although the Pittendrigh house
is empty of offspring, "it is so
crowded all the time that it's like
a hotel," claims Mrs. Pittendrigh.
"We have old friends from
Princeton and professional people
visiting us all the time."
Mrs. Pittendrigh also writes
short stories. "If I have the time I
want to send off a mystery story
which I've completed to a fiction
magazine," she says, "but right
now I don't have even the time to
write a cover letter." Mrs.
Pittendrigh drives a jeep wagon,
refusing "to buy another new car

until a new engine has been
designed which will be able to run
on lead-free gasoline. And
besides," she adds, "the heavy
jeep reminds of of our cabin in
Montana, where we spend
vacations and Colin fishes for
trout."
Her husband, a model worthy
of admiration to many, has no
heroes of his own. "1 try to avoid
hero worship," he says. "There
are no public figures in the world
at large who turn me on. People
whom 1 respect are John Gardner
and Robert Goheen (a classics
professor who became President
of Princeton at 37 )."
Popular Core
This fall he lectures on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
at 9 a.m. and again at 5 p.m. on
Monday evenings, each time to a
Cubberley Auditorium crowded
with undergraduates in the

Human Biology program. Last
Spring he taught "Man and
Nature" to an oversized class of
427.
This course was the first series
of four core courses which
comprise the Human Biology
Program, which he helped to
design. The program has replaced
Western Civilization, as an
undergraduate "must." More
students elect the core biology
series, now that they are free from
the Western Civ. requirement,
than any other core courses in the
University. Two-thirds of last
year's Sophomore class registered
for the program.
Pitt's explanation for students'
preference for the life sciences is
their interest in "man—his
functions, behavior, evolution and
social patterns. Such information
is mory desirable as essential than
recorded history. We don't seem
to learn much from history, do
we?" he adds.


Colin Pittendrigh
After only one quarter ol
teaching at Stanford, Biology
Professor Colin S. Pittendrigh is
supposed to be one of the most
popular teachers on campus.
"Pittendrigh," says one
collegue, "is larger than life. He's
not afraid to be emotional.
You've heard his lectures, you
know what I mean. To my mind
he is one of the greatest lecturers
in Biology, and 1 studied under
George Wald ... He has the same
enthusiasm in his private life as he
does in his lectures ... He pulls
people along with him. He's one

of the most lovable people I
know."
One Ph.D. candidate says,
"He's a truly charming man. He
has a wandering, inquisitive mind.
I'd call him a Rennaissance Man,
but that's not quite right."
Pittendrigh, or Pitt, as his
collegues call him, came to
Stanford's Biology Department
last fall after 22 years at
Princeton, four of which he spent
as Dean of Princeton's Graduate
School.
"I got tired of deaning," says
Pitt, "I didn't have all the talents
that a dean should have such as,
keeping one's temper and keeping

the stacks of paper off of one's
desk. Besides I wanted to get back
to teaching.
Not Sure
"I'm excited about the Human
Biology program. It was one of
the attractive things in coming
here. I am, however, worried
about it. Nobody has ever done
such a program before. We're not
sure what ought to be done. We
all have intuitive feelings, but we
need more faculty discussion
among the six or seven of us who
are teaching. We're going to have u
go around the circuit once or
twice before we thoroughly know
what we're doing."

Biology Department. He has set
up a nine-man lab and is centering
his research on two questions-1 )
What controls the innate
"biological clocks," and 2 ) What
arethey for - i.e. what do they
measure?
To illustrate the meaning of
"biological clocks" Pittendrigh
uses the starling. "They have
annual clocks," he explains, "as
do a number of other creatures. If
we place them in conditions of
constant temperature and
constant light, they grow,
reproduce in the Spring, and
behave as they would normally if
they had all the cues from the
outside. A similar clock measures
time for chrysanthemums,
migrating birds and animals which
hibernate."
Botany Honors
The son of an English
boiler-maker, Pitt attended British
public schools, graduating with
first class honors in botany from
the University of Durham in
1910. He earned a second degree

in Trinidad and worked in a
Malaria Research Station there for
three years.
After serving as an advisor to
the Brazilian government on
malaria problems, he went to
study at Columbia University.
There he worked under the noted
evolutionist and geneticist,
Theodore Dobzhansky. "He was
the most inspiring lecturer I ever
had," says Pitt.
He finished his dissertation in
19-18 and joined the Princeton
faculty as an assistant professor.
In 1 95 0 he became an associate
professor and a U.S. citizen.
"Among the reasons why 1 was
nationalized," he explains, "is my
wife. She was a New Yorker.
Another reason was that one of
my parents was dead and the
other died while I was at
Columbia, so there was no one to
pull me back home. Also, there
were more opportunities in
America. I was happy to get out
of the academic class system in
England. I didn't attend Oxford
or Cambridge, so I had little
chance of a career in the British
university system."
In 1943, the 25 year-old
Pittendrigh married a girl three
years out of Barnard College.
Margaret Pittendrigh, seven
months his senior, followed her
husband to Trinidad. The next
year she gave birth to their first of
two children, a daughter they
named Robin.
Robin, now 26, is teaching and
studying for a Masters in Fine
Arts in Boulder, Colorado. Their
son, 2 2 year-old Sandy, is married
and lives in Palo Alto. His wife is
expecting a child next month.
Although the Pittendrigh house
is empty of offspring, "it is so
crowded all the time that it's like
a hotel," claims Mrs. Pittendrigh.
"We have old friends from
Princeton and professional people
visiting us all the time."
Mrs. Pittendrigh also writes
short stories. "If I have the time I
want to send off a mystery story
which I've completed to a fiction
magazine," she says, "but right
now I don't have even the time to
write a cover letter." Mrs.
Pittendrigh drives a jeep wagon,
refusing "to buy another new car

until a new engine has been
designed which will be able to run
on lead-free gasoline. And
besides," she adds, "the heavy
jeep reminds of of our cabin in
Montana, where we spend
vacations and Colin fishes for
trout."
Her husband, a model worthy
of admiration to many, has no
heroes of his own. "1 try to avoid
hero worship," he says. "There
are no public figures in the world
at large who turn me on. People
whom 1 respect are John Gardner
and Robert Goheen (a classics
professor who became President
of Princeton at 37 )."
Popular Core
This fall he lectures on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
at 9 a.m. and again at 5 p.m. on
Monday evenings, each time to a
Cubberley Auditorium crowded
with undergraduates in the

Human Biology program. Last
Spring he taught "Man and
Nature" to an oversized class of
427.
This course was the first series
of four core courses which
comprise the Human Biology
Program, which he helped to
design. The program has replaced
Western Civilization, as an
undergraduate "must." More
students elect the core biology
series, now that they are free from
the Western Civ. requirement,
than any other core courses in the
University. Two-thirds of last
year's Sophomore class registered
for the program.
Pitt's explanation for students'
preference for the life sciences is
their interest in "man—his
functions, behavior, evolution and
social patterns. Such information
is mory desirable as essential than
recorded history. We don't seem
to learn much from history, do
we?" he adds.


Colin Pittendrigh
After only one quarter ol
teaching at Stanford, Biology
Professor Colin S. Pittendrigh is
supposed to be one of the most
popular teachers on campus.
"Pittendrigh," says one
collegue, "is larger than life. He's
not afraid to be emotional.
You've heard his lectures, you
know what I mean. To my mind
he is one of the greatest lecturers
in Biology, and 1 studied under
George Wald ... He has the same
enthusiasm in his private life as he
does in his lectures ... He pulls
people along with him. He's one

of the most lovable people I
know."
One Ph.D. candidate says,
"He's a truly charming man. He
has a wandering, inquisitive mind.
I'd call him a Rennaissance Man,
but that's not quite right."
Pittendrigh, or Pitt, as his
collegues call him, came to
Stanford's Biology Department
last fall after 22 years at
Princeton, four of which he spent
as Dean of Princeton's Graduate
School.
"I got tired of deaning," says
Pitt, "I didn't have all the talents
that a dean should have such as,
keeping one's temper and keeping

the stacks of paper off of one's
desk. Besides I wanted to get back
to teaching.
Not Sure
"I'm excited about the Human
Biology program. It was one of
the attractive things in coming
here. I am, however, worried
about it. Nobody has ever done
such a program before. We're not
sure what ought to be done. We
all have intuitive feelings, but we
need more faculty discussion
among the six or seven of us who
are teaching. We're going to have u
go around the circuit once or
twice before we thoroughly know
what we're doing."

After two decades of teaching
Princeton men, Pitt's first reaction
to Stanford was in response to its
coeds. "There was an uptightness
al Princeton," he says. "Which is
not evident here. The social life is
more relaxed here but the
stiffness at Princeton will
probably evaporate very quickly
now that they have gone coed."
Pitt criticizes Stanford's
advising system, which he claims
is "wholly inadequate. Students
and faculty don't know the facts
or requirements and students are
misinformed about what to take
when. People seem to wander
around all over the place."
Clocks
Pittendrigh, 52, is an authority
on the physiological rhythms in
plants and animals called
"biological clocks." These
oscillations function in
approximately 24-hour cycles and
regulate the heart rate, body
temperature and various other
aspects of metabolism in all living
organisms.
"Pitt is personally responsible
for putting the field of 'biological
clocks' on solid footing," says
Donald Kennedy, chairman of the
Biology Department. He has set
up a nine-man lab and is centering
his research on two questions-1 )
What controls the innate
"biological clocks," and 2 ) What
