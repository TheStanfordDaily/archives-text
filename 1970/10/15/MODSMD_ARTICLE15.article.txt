# Law School Admissions Tighten Up
## 
### MIKE GRUNDY 
Every year it becomes
increasingly difficult to get in to
Stanford Law School.
As the number of applicants
for admission to the law school
grows, Associate Dean W.T.

Keogh, in charge of admissions,
says it becomes "extremely
difficult" to choose 4 00
applicants for admission out of an
expected 2 70 0 applicants. "Of
those who make application, at
least 1,000 would make good law

students anywhere," Keogh said.
The Stanford Law School aims
at an entering class of 160
students. "We invite around 400
to accept those positions," Keogh
continued.
When asked how a candidate
potential is measured in
admissions, Keogh said, "a careful
consideration of the candidate's
undergraduate record and his Law
School Aptitude Test (LSAT)
scores is a good predictor, but not
infallible."
The process of accepting an
entering class takes at least four
months, from January to April.
"A committee meets and goes
over every application very
carefully," Keogh commented.
When asked if female
applicants are considered on a
different basis, Keogh said,
"Female applicants are treated
precisely the same as
males . . . Every applicant has an
equal chance." There art- now
roughly 8 0 women in the
Stanford Law School.
When asked how decisions are

made between so many qualified
applicants, Keogh said, "with
great inner turmoil. It is
extremely difficult. We do the
best we can, having to choose
between extremely qualified
applicants," Keogh continued.
"We are looking for
intellectually qualified men to
join a community of legal
scholars. Any geographic
distribution that occurs is purely
by chance," Keogh said.
Is a Stanford undergraduate
candidate for law school given
special consideration? Keogh said,
"No, however all schools are rated
differently with respect to a
candidate's record."
Keogh noted that there is no
way of assuring a student will be
successful in law school, but "his
activities, record, scores, and
energetic productivity are good
grounds for success."
"A candidate's political views
are not considered at all, and we
usually obtain quite a diversity of
views," Keogh said.

for admission to the law school
grows, Associate Dean W.T.

Keogh, in charge of admissions,
says it becomes "extremely
difficult" to choose 4 00
applicants for admission out of an
expected 2 70 0 applicants. "Of
those who make application, at
least 1,000 would make good law

students anywhere," Keogh said.
The Stanford Law School aims
at an entering class of 160
students. "We invite around 400
to accept those positions," Keogh
continued.
When asked how a candidate
potential is measured in
admissions, Keogh said, "a careful
consideration of the candidate's
undergraduate record and his Law
School Aptitude Test (LSAT)
scores is a good predictor, but not
infallible."
The process of accepting an
entering class takes at least four
months, from January to April.
"A committee meets and goes
over every application very
carefully," Keogh commented.
When asked if female
applicants are considered on a
different basis, Keogh said,
"Female applicants are treated
precisely the same as
males . . . Every applicant has an
equal chance." There art- now
roughly 8 0 women in the
Stanford Law School.
When asked how decisions are

made between so many qualified
applicants, Keogh said, "with
great inner turmoil. It is
extremely difficult. We do the
best we can, having to choose
between extremely qualified
applicants," Keogh continued.
"We are looking for
intellectually qualified men to
join a community of legal
scholars. Any geographic
distribution that occurs is purely
by chance," Keogh said.
Is a Stanford undergraduate
candidate for law school given
special consideration? Keogh said,
"No, however all schools are rated
differently with respect to a
candidate's record."
Keogh noted that there is no
way of assuring a student will be
successful in law school, but "his
activities, record, scores, and
energetic productivity are good
grounds for success."
"A candidate's political views
are not considered at all, and we
usually obtain quite a diversity of
views," Keogh said.
