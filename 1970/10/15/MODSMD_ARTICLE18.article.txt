# German Campus Centrally Located
## 
### SARAH CRAWFORD 
Imagine that you are sitting on
a hillside covered with green fields
and trees, looking off into the
mist-shrouded distance. Imagine
that you can see a small
red-roofed village, founded, let's
say, around the year 1100.
Imagine that behind you on the
hill is the former house of a
duchess on a 30-acre estate.
Imagine that you live there.
It doesn't sound much like
Stanford, our own red-roofed
village, but it is. It's
Stanford-in-Germany, otherwise
known as Landgut Burg, near the
medieval-like village of
Beutelsbach, a town rich in
tradition, Old World charm, and
friendly people.
Many of the town's buildings
date back to the sixteenth
century, including a
Kathaus-recently-turned museum,
originally built in 1577.
Stanford-in-Germany, fondly
called the Burg, is about a mile
from this small town and fifteen

miles east-northeast of Stuttgart,
which is located right in the
middle of Europe. By bus, train,
or car, several hours' journey will
bring you to Paris, Amsterdam,
Vienna, Florence, Bonn, Prague,
or good skiing in Switzerland.
One of the most popular
features of the German campus is
the family program with the
people of Beutelsbach. Students
may "adopt" families, or vice
versa, and get to know more
about the culture and customs of
the people. Some students choose
to stay with their families during
the three-week break between
quarters. Some have the
opportunity to go on family trips
or just learn recipes. The
Beutelsbachers, and most
Germans, are eager to talk with
students, as long as the students
are willing to make the first move.
Listening to a group of Burg
alumni rehashing experiences, you
are likely to hear of the many
advantages and few disadvantages
of the Stanford-in-Germany

campus, perhaps because there are
few bad things.
Among the things heard are:
"Germany's centrally
located . . . it's the only campus
with a small village connected
with it . . . good guest lecturers";
"There are good groups and bad
groups. Mine was one of the
best"; ". . . it's not all paradise".

"In what area would you rate
Austria above Germany?"
"None"; "You can be a part of
the country, a student. People
don't treat you like a tourist. You
are a student and that's something
different." About Stuttgart,
which has its own opera and
ballet, two theatres, a symphony
orchestra, and several museums

and art galleries housed in castles
and ancient buildings, you hear:
"There's a fantastic zoo . . . and
i here is culture."
One student said, "I was there
180 days and 1 traveled 8 5 of
them. And my grade point went
up."
The student reactions,in short,
good.

to stay with their families during
the three-week break between
quarters. Some have the
opportunity to go on family trips
or just learn recipes. The
Beutelsbachers, and most
Germans, are eager to talk with
students, as long as the students
are willing to make the first move.
Listening to a group of Burg
alumni rehashing experiences, you
are likely to hear of the many
advantages and few disadvantages
of the Stanford-in-Germany

campus, perhaps because there are
few bad things.
Among the things heard are:
"Germany's centrally
located . . . it's the only campus
with a small village connected
with it . . . good guest lecturers";
"There are good groups and bad
groups. Mine was one of the
best"; ". . . it's not all paradise".

"In what area would you rate
Austria above Germany?"
"None"; "You can be a part of
the country, a student. People
don't treat you like a tourist. You
are a student and that's something
different." About Stuttgart,
which has its own opera and
ballet, two theatres, a symphony
orchestra, and several museums

and art galleries housed in castles
and ancient buildings, you hear:
"There's a fantastic zoo . . . and
i here is culture."
One student said, "I was there
180 days and 1 traveled 8 5 of
them. And my grade point went
up."
The student reactions,in short,
good.
Imagine that you are sitting on
a hillside covered with green fields
and trees, looking off into the
mist-shrouded distance. Imagine
that you can see a small
red-roofed village, founded, let's
say, around the year 1100.
Imagine that behind you on the
hill is the former house of a
duchess on a 30-acre estate.
Imagine that you live there.
It doesn't sound much like
Stanford, our own red-roofed
village, but it is. It's
Stanford-in-Germany, otherwise
known as Landgut Burg, near the
medieval-like village of
Beutelsbach, a town rich in
tradition, Old World charm, and
friendly people.
Many of the town's buildings
date back to the sixteenth
century, including a
Kathaus-recently-turned museum,
originally built in 1577.
Stanford-in-Germany, fondly
called the Burg, is about a mile
from this small town and fifteen

miles east-northeast of Stuttgart,
which is located right in the
middle of Europe. By bus, train,
or car, several hours' journey will
bring you to Paris, Amsterdam,
Vienna, Florence, Bonn, Prague,
or good skiing in Switzerland.
One of the most popular
features of the German campus is
the family program with the
people of Beutelsbach. Students
may "adopt" families, or vice
versa, and get to know more
about the culture and customs of
the people. Some students choose
to stay with their families during
the three-week break between
quarters. Some have the
opportunity to go on family trips
or just learn recipes. The
