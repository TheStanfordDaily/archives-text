# ID Photo Schedule Begins This Week
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Stanford students have been
strongly urged to have their
student ID photos taken early in
the week that they are
alphabetically assigned, or risk
long lines and considerable
inconvenience.
The caution comes from Peter
Dahl, Assistant Registrar, who in a
letter to the Daily, stated "I am
concerned that students may wait
until Friday of each week to have
their pictures taken.
"This choice," Dahl continued,
"will result in long lines, frayed
nerves, and bad tempers. So, I ask
all students who wish to have
their pictures- taken to act on that
desire quickly. Our motto is: Do
It Now!"
According to Dahl, on
Monday—the first day of the
project, some 230 photos were
processed. However, Dahl pointed
out that the entire project
involves over 1 2,5 00 students- all
students registered in any way
with Stanford.
About 4 5 00 pictures have
already been taken by the
University Food Service. Some
8000 photos accordingly must be
taken, which, under ideal
conditions, wold mean about 535

per day.
The published schedule allows
designated segments of the
alphabet to have their pictures
taken any time during a one-week
period. This, in theory, allows
students with heavy class
schedules ample freedom in
choosing a convenient time for
their photos. "However,"
commented Dahl, "this plan also
allows ample room for
procrastination."
Dahl added that any student
may have his picture taken at any
time during the next three weeks,
regardless of the published
schedule, so long as this practice
does not result in long lines.
The schedule is: October
12-16, A-G; October 19-23, H-0;
October 26-30, P-Z: and
November 2-6, All students. The
Photo Reproduction Annex will
be open Monday through Friday
from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
including the lunch hour.
The purpose of the new card,
restated Dahl, is solely to ensure
that those who purport to be
Stanford students are in fact
Stanford students. This form of
identification "will also be useful
to students in proving their
student status off-campus."

be open Monday through Friday

The purpose of the new card,
restated Dahl, is solely to ensure
that those who purport to be
Stanford students are in fact
Stanford students. This form of
identification "will also be useful
to students in proving their
student status off-campus."
Stanford students have been
strongly urged to have their
student ID photos taken early in
the week that they are
alphabetically assigned, or risk
long lines and considerable
inconvenience.
The caution comes from Peter
Dahl, Assistant Registrar, who in a
letter to the Daily, stated "I am
concerned that students may wait
until Friday of each week to have
their pictures taken.
"This choice," Dahl continued,
"will result in long lines, frayed
nerves, and bad tempers. So, I ask
all students who wish to have
their pictures- taken to act on that
desire quickly. Our motto is: Do
It Now!"
According to Dahl, on
Monday—the first day of the
project, some 230 photos were
processed. However, Dahl pointed
out that the entire project
involves over 1 2,5 00 students- all
students registered in any way
with Stanford.
About 4 5 00 pictures have
already been taken by the
University Food Service. Some
8000 photos accordingly must be
taken, which, under ideal
conditions, wold mean about 535

per day.
The published schedule allows
designated segments of the
alphabet to have their pictures
taken any time during a one-week
period. This, in theory, allows
students with heavy class
schedules ample freedom in
choosing a convenient time for
their photos. "However,"
commented Dahl, "this plan also
allows ample room for
procrastination."
Dahl added that any student
may have his picture taken at any
time during the next three weeks,
regardless of the published
schedule, so long as this practice
does not result in long lines.
The schedule is: October
12-16, A-G; October 19-23, H-0;
October 26-30, P-Z: and
November 2-6, All students. The
Photo Reproduction Annex will
be open Monday through Friday
