# ROTC Freshmen Receiving Credit Despite Faculty's Spring Vote
## 
### 
Despite a faculty vote last spring to
deny academic credit to freshmen
ROTC courses, freshmen cadets in the
Army and Navy programs receive full
credit for classes in which they are
currently enrolled.
Army officials claim that the
University failed to give a year's
cancellation notice, and thus credit
must be granted to three freshmen who
had been admitted previous to the May
7, 1 970, Academic Senate vote.
Twenty Navy freshmen are currently
enrolled in a stepped-up program which
will graduate them along with the
current sophomore class. There are no
freshman NROTC classes, but the
freshmen will receive full credit for
their classes with sophomores.
According to Col. Stanley Ramey,
Army ROTC commander, Army
freshmen are in a similar situation and
are taking sophomore classes for credit.
Faculty Vote
The faculty group last June voted 36
to 8 to terminate credit for ROTC
classes, with a provision for possible
credit for students then currently
enrolled in ROTC programs. At the
same time, the group asked the
President's Advisory Committee on
ROTC to make recommendations "as
to the termination or retention and, if
retained, future conduct of any ROTC

programs at Stanford . . Since credit
had been terminated, the committee did
not consider that issue.
However the Daily learned in
interviews with Captain John S. Duck,
who is in charge of the Navy ROTC
program this year, and Registrar Harvey
Hall that all Navy and Army freshmen
cadets continue to receive credit for
their work, in an apparent
contradiction with the Academic
Senate vote.
"To use an old Navy expression,"
said Captain Duck, "we're playing
'get-along.' We're trying to keep these
guys from getting screwed up."
Freshmen Receive Credit
Registrar Harvey Hall stated that
freshmen in sophomore ROTC courses
receive credit for those courses. Hall
said that he would continue to grant
credit to freshmen "as long as it's okay
with the Navy Science or Military
Science department."
The freshmen will be taking ROTC
classes along with the current
sophomore class throughout their first
three years here, finishing their ROTC
classes after their junior year. They will
make-up the classes they would
normally take during their freshman
year through directed reading and
off-campus work, according to Navy
spokesmen.

In eary June the Academic Senate
voted to allow no new enrollments in
any ROTC program after August 31,
1970. On July 30 the Academic
Council made up of all assistant,
associate, and full professors along with
some administrators, voted to uphold
the June decision.
However, during the summer a
compromise arrangement was reached
allowing freshmen in non-credit ROTC
programs. These students had been
admitted to the ROTC programs before
the June faculty decisions.
Placement Problems
ROTC officials were unable to place
the freshmen at other colleges with
their scholarships and the University
could not find funds to match the
ROTC scholarships. The Advisory
Committee thus concluded that the
freshmen should be admitted in an
accelerated, three-year, non-credit
program.
Only the Army has balked at the
University's proposals. President
Lyman announced on Oct. 1,
"Discussions (on ROTC removal) with
the Army have gone less smoothly."' He
said that Army officials claimed a
year's notice was necessary to begin the
phase-out. "We have, therefore,
informed the Army that freshmen
instruction, without credit, will be
offered this year," Lyman said.

Lyman criticized the Army's slow
progress by saying, "We hope they will
agree, as the Navy has done, to phase
out their program in a way that will do
the least possible damage to the
students involved."
He added, "The simplest way to do
that would be to allow the present
sophomore, junior, and senior classes to
complete their military training and
education on schedule, and to
accelerate by one year the training of
the freshmen class. We have not yet
received an answer from the Army,"
Lyman concluded.
Air Force announced early last May
that it would end its program
voluntarily by June 1971, and the Navy
agreed to a timetable that would phase
out by June 197 3.
