# KZSU To Increase Broadcasting Power
## 
### 
Stanford University radio
station KZSU has received
permission from the Federal
Communications Commission to
transfer their antenna site to the
Stanford foothills, according to
station manager Dave Hosley.
The transfer, according to
Hosley, will be linked with a new
four bay antenna, which will
increase the station's effective
radiated power from its present
eight watts to an estimated 36
watts. Actual wattage will remain
at 1 0 watts.

KZSU chief engineer Mark
Lawrence will begin immediately
on the construction of the new
site, about a half mile south of the
intersection of Junipero Serra
Blvd. and Mayfield Avenue, near
the radar. Lawrence estimates the
project will be completed in about
a month.
The site transfer and the
addition of the new antenna, four
times as powerful as the present
one on top of Memorial
Auditorium, will greatly increase
the KZSU FM broadcast pattern.
