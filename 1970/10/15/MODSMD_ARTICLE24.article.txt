# S.F. Symphony Preview
## 
### PEDRO RAMET 
When one of the regularly
scheduled conductors fell sick in
1963, it was Seiji O/.awa who was
called in to lead the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra. Since then
he has directed orchestras all over
the world including the Cleveland
Orchestra, the New York
Philharmonic and the Toronto
Symphony Orchestra, where he
filled the post of musical director
before coming to San Francisco.
Variety is the keynote with
Ozawa, and will be so again as the
San Francisco Symphony
Association begins its thirty-first
season. Many of the works to be
performed are works with which
Ozawa has already demonstrated a
profound familiarity, (e.g. the
Berlioz "Symphonic l Fantastique"
and the Takemitsu "Asterism")
and we may look forward to the
coming season with enthusiasm.
Guest artists abound, from
Maestro Josef Krips, to whom the

San Francisco Symphony is much
indebted for the years he spent
here, to the flamboyant young
pianist, John Browning, who will
perform the Prokofiev Piano
Concerto No. 1 on January 1 3. Of
special interest is the program of
February 17, in which gifted
soprano Elly Ameling will join
Maestro Krips in a Mozart-Mahler
program.
The Mozart Symphony (No.
35, "Haffner") which opens that
concert has long been a favorite of
conductors (Toscanini and Walter
among them) and audiences alike,
and the program will close with
Mahler's fourth symphony, the
most prominent of what Glen
Gould and others call "the thin
Mahler", referring to the
comparatively thin texture when
contrasted with the Mahler
symphonies nos. 2 and 8.
Sopranos Jane Marsh and
Judith Raskin will also be making
appearances with the orchestra

this season, the former in a
cantata by the contemporary
composer, Alberto Ginastera.
It will be a good season for
violinists too, bringing us first
Isaac Stern in the Beethoven
violin concerto, then the Russian
violinist, Igor Oistrakh, (January
6) for Lalo's bouyant
"Symphonic Espagnole", Niklaus
Wyss, guest conductor in the
Brahms violin concerto.
Those in the know will be
delighted to learn that the
underexposed but dazzling
pianist, Leon Fleisher, will appear
on May 12 playing the Ravel
Concerto for left hand, on a
program that will also bring the
French-American compose, Darius
Milhaud, to the podium in a
performance of his own recent
"Music for Prague".
"With-it"
Also due to drop in at the
Opera House is the very much
"with-it" guitarist, Christopher
Parkening, whose scholarly
research on the composers he
performs does much to commend
him to his listening audiences.
Okko Kamu, whose recent
recording of the Sibelius second
Symphony was hailed for its
freshness and vitality, will
perform that symphony on April
28, coupling with it pieces by
Berlioz and Bach. Another
Sibelius symphony, the Fifth, will
also be played this season, on
January 27, this time under the
direction of the British conductor,
Lor in Maazel.
It is an old story that young
conductors don't have the
repertory that conductors have
who have been in the business
fifty to sixty years. But for the
comparatively short time that

Ozawa has been around, he is to
be commended for having put
together a diverse and exciting
program. The Baroque-oriented
will be treated this season to the
delightful (Iluck overture,
"Iphigenia in Aulis".
The more pop-oriented will
appreciate hearing "Also Sprach
Zarathustra" on the same billing
with the Corky Siegel Blues Band.
The omnipresent Bach-Stokowski,
purported by some to be an
illegitimate son of Johann
Sebastian Bach, is making an
"appearance" with the perennial
favorite, the Toccata and Fugue in
D minor.
My own favorite for this season
is "The Birds" by Ottorino
Respighi, coming March 10.
Respighi, who studied with
Rimsky-Korsakov, drew much of
his inspiration from Renaissance
composers and"The Birds" is an
impressionistic suite based on the
airs and dances of Pasquini, Gallot
and Rameau.
This is also presumably the
first time that Professor Harold
Schmidt and the Stanford
University Chorus will be singing
twice at San Francisco. As usual
the chorus will appear on the last
program, this year in a concert
presentation of The Damnation of
Faust by Hector Berlioz. They
will also intone the Haydn Te
Deum and Leonard Bernstein's
Chichester Psalms on the opening
program on December 2 .
Student-price tickets for the
Wednesday night Forum series are
now on sale. Prices for the entire
series of 2 4 Wednesday night
concerts start at $32.00, for a 12
concert series at $16.00. For
