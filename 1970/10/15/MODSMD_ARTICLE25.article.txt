# 'Pirates Of Penzance' Flawed, But Delightful
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
If you have ever doubted that
the whole can be greater than the
sum of its parts, the Lamplighters
production of "The Pirates of
Penzance," playing now at the
Presentation Theater in San
Francisco, should settle the
matter once and for all. It is a
show so imperfect in detail, and
yet so delightful as a whole that
one wonders how they managed
it.
One of the truly wonderful
things about Gilbert and Sullivan
is that you can get away with a lot
and still come out looking good.
The lamplighters is a company
which could best be characterized
as "semi-pro." This means that,
while in general the performance
is quite competant, there is
usually enough sloppiness so that
you don't mistake them for the
D'Ovly Carte. I hate to use the
cliche, but it seems that in this
case the Lamplighters have made
up in enthusiasm what they
lacked in technique, and the result
is surprisingly good.
Director Orva Hoskinson
deserves most of the credit for the
show being the success that it it.
There is a real Gilbert and Sullivan
mystique, an unwritten code that
says that each show must be done
a certain way, that certain way
being the way that the D'Oyly
Carte does it. Fortunately, Mr.
Hoskinson either doesn't know
how D'Oyly Carte does it, or,
more likely, he doesn't care.
Mr. Hoskinson takes the script
and plays it for every laugh it's
got. When D'Oyly Carte does
"Pirates," it is amusing; when Mr.
Hoskinson does it, it is hilarious.
Perhaps the D'Oyly Carte version
is more authentic; perhaps we're
not nineteenth century English men,
and can benefit from a bit of
no n-authentic originality. Mr.
Hoskinson has skillfully
manipulated his performers,
making clever use of the cramped
stage of the Presentation Theater
(which is, in reality, the
auditorium of a girls' Catholic
high school), and has given a bit
more zing to what is still, after a
hundred years, still a rather zingy
show.
Unfortunately, Mr. Hoskinson
is a shade better than most of his

performers. The Lamplighters
seem to have trouble with acting
or with singing—seldom with
both, but almost always with one
or the other.
Before I proceed to discuss the
individual performances, I think it
is proper to point out that all of
the principles have been
double-cast. This means that there
are two actors trained for each of
the major roles. Obviously, I have
seen only one of these actors in
each role. When you go to see it,
you may very well catch the
second platoon.
The night I saw it, Frederid
was played by Michael Epstein.
Mr. Epstein has a very nice tenor
voice, which is quite pleasant
when he doesn't try to push it too
hard. However, as an actor Mr.
Epstein is less than ideal. He is
very tall, and tends to walk with
his head thrust forward, face
down, so that he gives one the
impression that he is imitating
Snoopy imitating a vulture. Mr.
Epstein does fine when he is
supposed to be despondent, but
he is something of a failure when
he tries to look heroic.
Playing opposite Mr. Epstein,
in the part of Mabel, was Peggy
Overshiner. Miss Overshiner is a
very funny Mabel, all wide-eyed
innocence with the brain of a fox.
She has a very difficult number in
the first act a colorature show
piece that is probably the closest
thing in the Gilbert and Sullivan
repertoire to a real live aria. As
with everything else in the show.
Director Hoskinson chose to play
this one for laughs, treating it as a
parody of grand opera style, so it
was hard to tell just what Miss
Overshiner was capable of doing
with it.
Although Sir Arthur Sullivan
wrote for a full orchestra, the
Lamplighters have been forced to
make do with a single piano, the
price of orchestras being what
they are nowadays. Leßoy Miller
played all of the music for the
show single-handed, quite an
accomplishment. Yet for all of
Mr. Miller's efforts, the lack of an
orchestra really did hurt,
especially in the finales when the
chorus has stopped singing and
the single piano had to carry the
momentum generated by
thirty-five voices.
