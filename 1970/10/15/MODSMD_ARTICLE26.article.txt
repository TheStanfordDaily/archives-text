# Cal Tjader, Smoke To Appear Sunday
## 
### ROBYN STICKNEY 
A jazz experience is happening
this Sunday afternoon at Frost
Amphitheater. Two of the most
exciting groups of the jazz era, Cal
Tjader Quintet and 'Smoke', are
playing a tribute to the living
spirit of Jimi Hendrix, with
proceeds going to help make up a
$20,000 deficit in the government
grant to the war on poverty.
Cal Tjader has been one of the
most fluent musicians on the San
Francisco jazz scene, and his
quintet features a cool 'electric
sound' with a contemporary
spicing of electric piano and
fender bass, rapidly becoming the
new trend in this jazz era. The
progressive jazz group 'Smoke'
provides vibrant contrast with
devastating improvisations and
rythmic pattern o which are more
than challenging to older jazz
styles.
Jazz, one (112 the few authentic
art forms of America, is suffering
from the revolution going on in
the music world. Many of its
artists have been caught up in the
myth of drugs, marijuana, and
starvation. The concert, Sunday,

is a continuing attempt to keep
this art form alive and available to
all the people.
In an interview, members of
the Quintet stressed their two-fold
purpose in giving the concert; as a
tribute to Hendrix and a benefit.
"It's the way the people are
saying goodbye to Jimi. He lived
his life through his music; we
want to pay a tribute to him
through ours," they said. Hendrix
died one month ago after taking
nine sleeping pills.
The program is being jointly
sponsored by the BSU and the
Economic Opportunity
Commission of San Mateo
County, who are backing a
number of fund-raising activities
for the war on poverty. This
concert will be one of many
efforts in their fight to deep
anti-poverty programs alive.
The concert will be held
Sunday, October 18, from 2-4
p.m. at Frost. Tickets are available
at Stanford Tresidder Union
Office, Discount Records-Menlo
Park, and Kepler's Book Store,
Menlo Park. Donations are $2 in
advance, $2.5 oat the gate.

Jazz, one (112 the few authentic
art forms of America, is suffering
from the revolution going on in
the music world. Many of its
artists have been caught up in the
myth of drugs, marijuana, and
starvation. The concert, Sunday,

is a continuing attempt to keep
this art form alive and available to
all the people.
In an interview, members of
the Quintet stressed their two-fold
purpose in giving the concert; as a
tribute to Hendrix and a benefit.
"It's the way the people are
saying goodbye to Jimi. He lived
his life through his music; we
want to pay a tribute to him
through ours," they said. Hendrix
died one month ago after taking
nine sleeping pills.
The program is being jointly
sponsored by the BSU and the
Economic Opportunity
Commission of San Mateo
County, who are backing a
number of fund-raising activities
for the war on poverty. This
concert will be one of many
efforts in their fight to deep
anti-poverty programs alive.
The concert will be held
Sunday, October 18, from 2-4
p.m. at Frost. Tickets are available
at Stanford Tresidder Union
Office, Discount Records-Menlo
Park, and Kepler's Book Store,
Menlo Park. Donations are $2 in
advance, $2.5 oat the gate.
