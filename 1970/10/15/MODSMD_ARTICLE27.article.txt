## Poloists Face UCLA 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
Off to their best start in many
years, the Stanford water polo
team hosts defending national
champion UCLA tomorrow at
3:00 in the Stanford pool.
Tuesday, the Indians ran their
record to 9-1 with al4 -7 win over
Foothill Junior College.
In a game last Friday which
was overshadowed by the
approaching USC football game,
the Cards won their league opener
with a 9-8 overtime victory over
UC Berkeley. Led by junior Rick
Massimino who scored six goals
and by junior goalie Peter Gadd,
the Tribe outlasted Cal in an
extremely physical contest which
saw 89 fouls called.
Stanford had led at the end of
each of the first three periods,
4-2, 5-4, and 7-6 but the Bears
tied it up 7-7 in the final quarter
to send the game into overtime.
Overtime Antics
The rough pattern of the
contest carried over into the extra
period and a couple more of Cal's
5 0 fouls gave the Cards two
penalty shots. Massimino
connected on both penalty

attempts and Gadd stopped all
but one of many Cal shots to save
the win.
An elated Coach Jim Gaughran
said, "It was a great team effort in
which no one let down."
Gaughran was particularly pleased
with the performance of his
reserves who were forced into
action when several starters fouled
out.
Aggies Dropped
On Saturday morning,
Stanford upped their non-league
record to 7-1 with a 9-6 win over
UC Davis. The Indians had
defeated the Aggies 10-6 a week
earlier at the Northern California
Open Tournament. The Tribe won
the consolation title at the
tournament but suffered their

only loss of the year, a 10-3
defeat by San Jose State.
Against Davis, Stanford
jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead.
After leading 4-2 at the half and
5-2 early in the third period, the
Indians gave up three straight
scores which knotted it at 5-5.
Early in the fourth period the
Indians got into even deeper
trouble when super-star
Massimino fouled out.
Missing Massimino
After Massimino's departure
the Cards rallied for four last
period goals and an easy 9-6 win.
Especially impressive in the late
going were Bill Simkinsand Mike
Davis who successfully took up
the slack for the missing
Massimino.

Foothill Junior College.
In a game last Friday which
was overshadowed by the
approaching USC football game,
the Cards won their league opener
with a 9-8 overtime victory over
UC Berkeley. Led by junior Rick
Massimino who scored six goals
and by junior goalie Peter Gadd,
the Tribe outlasted Cal in an
extremely physical contest which
saw 89 fouls called.
Stanford had led at the end of
each of the first three periods,
4-2, 5-4, and 7-6 but the Bears
tied it up 7-7 in the final quarter
to send the game into overtime.
Overtime Antics
The rough pattern of the
contest carried over into the extra
period and a couple more of Cal's
5 0 fouls gave the Cards two
penalty shots. Massimino
connected on both penalty

attempts and Gadd stopped all
but one of many Cal shots to save
the win.
An elated Coach Jim Gaughran
said, "It was a great team effort in
which no one let down."
Gaughran was particularly pleased
with the performance of his
reserves who were forced into
action when several starters fouled
out.
Aggies Dropped
On Saturday morning,
Stanford upped their non-league
record to 7-1 with a 9-6 win over
UC Davis. The Indians had
defeated the Aggies 10-6 a week
earlier at the Northern California
Open Tournament. The Tribe won
the consolation title at the
tournament but suffered their

only loss of the year, a 10-3
defeat by San Jose State.
Against Davis, Stanford
jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead.
After leading 4-2 at the half and
5-2 early in the third period, the
Indians gave up three straight
scores which knotted it at 5-5.
Early in the fourth period the
Indians got into even deeper
trouble when super-star
Massimino fouled out.
Missing Massimino
After Massimino's departure
the Cards rallied for four last
period goals and an easy 9-6 win.
Especially impressive in the late
going were Bill Simkinsand Mike
Davis who successfully took up
the slack for the missing
Massimino.
