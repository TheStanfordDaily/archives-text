# Runners Win At Sacramento
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Stanford's varsity cross country squad won the Sacramento
Invitational Meet for the third consecutive year last Saturday by
placing four runners in the first 10 of 150 contestants.
Junior Robert Coe topped all the finishers over the tough 4.8 mile
course with a time of 25:23. Senior Don Kardong completed the race
seven seconds behind his teammate to take second.
Bernie Lahde and Arvid Kretz, both juniors, placed sixth and
eighth, respectively. Sophomore Rick Geisler capped Stanford's
scoring in the meet by placing 16th.
California State at Fullerton placed second in the meet with 88
points and was not able to threaten Stanford's winning total of 33.
Two Don't Show
San Jose State took third place and Humboldt State was a distant
fourth. San Diego State and Chico State, both teams that were
expected to give Stanford trouble, chose not to compete in the meet.
Coach Marshall Clark commented on the competition: "No school
there was strong enough to mount a threat for the team
championship, although there certainly were some fine individual
runners in the meet."
The times in the meet were slow, but that was due mainly to the
hot and humid weather. A soft, sandy course also plagued the runners
and they received a harsh physical beating.
Clark was proud of his runners' performances under the adverse
conditions and plans to emphasize more conditioning work for his
men.
Weak Depth
Coach Clark is concerned about the fact that his other five
non-scoring runners at Sacramento finished in places ranging from
5 7 th to 81 st. This surprising lack of depth will have to be corrected if
the squad is to make a strong showing in the tough Pac-8 conference
this season.
Stanford's freshmen runners competed as a team in the junior
college division at the Invitational and took fifth place. Clark was
especially pleased with Neil Bernstein, Dan Cautley and Peter
Fitsmaurice, who finished ninth, 10th and 11th in a field of
approximately 15 0.
Robert Hayman and Robert Schuchard completed the placing for
Stanford to give the frosh a 122 point total.
The entire Indian cross country team suffered a grave loss before
the Sacramento race when sophomore Decker Underwood was
seriously injured in a motorcycle accedent.
Underwood Out
The rapidly improving eighth man on the team underwent an
operation Saturday and has suffered severe ligament damage.
Underwood is definitely out for the season and may never run
competitively again, according to Coach Clark.
The Indian chief hopes to regroup his forces effectively in order to
face USC and San Jose State on the Stanford Golf Course this
Saturday at 10 a.m. It will be the varsity's only home appearance this
season.
The Tribe meets UCLA and California in league races in Los
Angeles and Berkeley, and then gets its first look at the northern
schools—Oregon and Oregon State, Washington and Washington
State—at the Pac-8 Championships to be held Nov. 14 in Pullman,
Wash.
Oregon and Washington State are expected to be the league
powerhouses again this year, although the Cougars were hurt badly by
graduation. Last year Oregon, WSU and Stanford ran one, two, three,
with the Ducks and Cougars well ahead of everybody else.
Stanford's other scheduled race will be in the Mt. San Antonio
College Invitational Oct. 30 at Walnut, Calif.

placing four runners in the first 10 of 150 contestants.
Junior Robert Coe topped all the finishers over the tough 4.8 mile
course with a time of 25:23. Senior Don Kardong completed the race
seven seconds behind his teammate to take second.
Bernie Lahde and Arvid Kretz, both juniors, placed sixth and
eighth, respectively. Sophomore Rick Geisler capped Stanford's
scoring in the meet by placing 16th.
California State at Fullerton placed second in the meet with 88
points and was not able to threaten Stanford's winning total of 33.
Two Don't Show
San Jose State took third place and Humboldt State was a distant
fourth. San Diego State and Chico State, both teams that were
expected to give Stanford trouble, chose not to compete in the meet.
Coach Marshall Clark commented on the competition: "No school
there was strong enough to mount a threat for the team
championship, although there certainly were some fine individual
runners in the meet."
The times in the meet were slow, but that was due mainly to the
hot and humid weather. A soft, sandy course also plagued the runners
and they received a harsh physical beating.
Clark was proud of his runners' performances under the adverse
conditions and plans to emphasize more conditioning work for his
men.
Weak Depth
Coach Clark is concerned about the fact that his other five
non-scoring runners at Sacramento finished in places ranging from
5 7 th to 81 st. This surprising lack of depth will have to be corrected if
the squad is to make a strong showing in the tough Pac-8 conference
this season.
Stanford's freshmen runners competed as a team in the junior
college division at the Invitational and took fifth place. Clark was
especially pleased with Neil Bernstein, Dan Cautley and Peter
Fitsmaurice, who finished ninth, 10th and 11th in a field of
approximately 15 0.
Robert Hayman and Robert Schuchard completed the placing for
Stanford to give the frosh a 122 point total.
The entire Indian cross country team suffered a grave loss before
the Sacramento race when sophomore Decker Underwood was
seriously injured in a motorcycle accedent.
Underwood Out
The rapidly improving eighth man on the team underwent an
operation Saturday and has suffered severe ligament damage.
Underwood is definitely out for the season and may never run
competitively again, according to Coach Clark.
The Indian chief hopes to regroup his forces effectively in order to
face USC and San Jose State on the Stanford Golf Course this
Saturday at 10 a.m. It will be the varsity's only home appearance this
season.
The Tribe meets UCLA and California in league races in Los
Angeles and Berkeley, and then gets its first look at the northern
schools—Oregon and Oregon State, Washington and Washington
State—at the Pac-8 Championships to be held Nov. 14 in Pullman,
Wash.
Oregon and Washington State are expected to be the league
powerhouses again this year, although the Cougars were hurt badly by
graduation. Last year Oregon, WSU and Stanford ran one, two, three,
with the Ducks and Cougars well ahead of everybody else.
Stanford's other scheduled race will be in the Mt. San Antonio
College Invitational Oct. 30 at Walnut, Calif.
