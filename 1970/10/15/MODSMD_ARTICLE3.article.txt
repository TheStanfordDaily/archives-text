TOKYO (AP) — North Vietnam
Wednesday rejected "categorically"
President Nixon's Indochina peace
plan. U.S. officials claimed the
announcement was a bargaining ploy
and not the last word by North
Vietnam on Nixon's offer.
The statement, issued as the Paris
peace conference prepared to meet
Thursday for the second time on the
Nixon plan, said: "The Vietnamese
people and the government of the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam
sternly condemn and categorically
reject the deceptive 'peace' proposal
made by the Nixon administration."
Referring to Nixon's proposal to
convene a Geneva-type international
conference on Indochina, the
statement said it is "nothing but a
cunning trick aimed at fooling public
opinion, hiding the fact that the United
States is obdurately maintaining its
aggressive stand against Vietnam,
and Cambodia.
The statement added: "the
Vietnamese people are resolved to

endure all sacrifices and hardships,
persist in and promote the fight on the
military, political and diplomatic fronts
till complete victory."
North Vietnamese Ambassador
Xuan Thuy called the proposal "an
electoral gift certificate." Mrs. Nguyen
Thi Bi.h of the Viet Cong said the plan
was a means "of legalizing American
aggression in Indochina."
The statement issued in Hanoi said
Nixon "was vague on two fundamental
problems" U.S. troop pullout and the
political situation in South Vietnam.
Nixon "linked the U.S. troop
withdrawal with the overall settlement
of the Indochinese problem, thus
posing more conditions for the
withdrawal of American troops," it
said.
"On the political problem in South
Vietnam, the U.S. viewpoint on the
'right to self-determination' boils down
essentially to maintaining the
Thieu-Ky-Khicm puppet clique-lackeys
of the United States, opposing the
formation of the provisional coalition

government and asking for the right of
the Saigon puppet administration to
organize fraudulent elections," it said.
After an initial study of the Hanoi
statement, State Department officials
said Washington does not regard it as
the last word by way of North
Vietnam's position toward the Nixon
offer.
A North Vietnamese spokesman said
the plan would be criticized at future
sessions.
Nixon's program included these
points:
—A standstill cease-fire throughout
Indochina under international
supervision.
—An Indochina peace conference to
settle the Vietnamese, Laotian and
Cambodian disputes.
—Negotiations on a timetable for
troop withdrawals.
—A political settlement reflecting
the current balance of forces in South
Vietnam.
—The immediate release of all
prisoners of war by both sides.
