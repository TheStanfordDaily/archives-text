## Tribe Prepares For WSU 
### 
With the superlatives still
reverberating after the stellar
upset of USC last week,
Stanfor< s football team is getting
ready for Washington State.
Which may not be the joke it
sounds, since the Tribe hasn't
beaten the Cougars in the Palouse
since 1 95 6 or something.
Two years ago Stanford let
down after a narrow loss to USC
and stumbled to a 21-21 tie.
Last year the Indians let down
after a narrower loss to USC and
beat Washington State 4 9-0. But
that was here.
"We're kinda going back to the
old drawing board and working on
fundamentals," Coach John
Ralston said of this week's
practice.
Injury Check
Meanwhile, the injury list has
shrunk a bit from last week
although Mike Ewing re-pulled a
leg muscle in practice Tuesday
and probably won't play in
Spokane. Tom Sones has pinched
nerve trouble and Jim Kehl has
the flu.
Jack Lasater, who didn't play
against the Trojans, has been
going through light drills this
week but has stayed away from
the rough stuff.
In polls, you've probably
noticed, Stanford climbed to
ninth following the USC victory
while the Trojans dropped to 11 th
and 12 th, depending which one
you believe.

Should the Indians defeat Ohio
State in the Rose Bowl, some
experts figure the Cards will jump
all the way to eighth.
Jim Plunkett maintains his
prominence in national statistics
released yesterday, holding second
place in total offense and forward
passing.
Plunkett's total yardage
average is 273.2, a mere 3.4 yards
a game behind Bob Parker of the
Air Force. Archie Manning, Tribe

fans might be interested, has
climbed to 10 th in total offense
with a 214.8 average.
Davidson's Mark Thompson
leads the "passing department with
an average of 18.7 passes per
game, just a half a pass ahead of
Plunkett. Stanford's passing
offense is ranked fourth behind
Oregon, Air Force and San Diego
State.
The Indians are 13th in total
offense, averaging 420.4 yards.

Notre Dame leads with 5 4 4.5 .
With 10 receptions last week,
Randy Vataha vaulted to 21st
among national receivers with 25
catches in 5 games. Notre Dame's
Tom Gatewood leads with a
nine-catch average.
Jackie Leads
In team statistics, Jackie
Brown has caught up with fellow
running back iliilary Shockley in
scoring and has taken a slight lead
in rushing.
Jackie's pair of touchdowns
against the Trojans gives him five
touchdowns — same as
Shockley—and Brown's rushing
total is 30 2 yards in five games to
Hillary's 292 .
Plunkett's passing percentage
has risen to .5 26 and presently he
has thrown 91 passes for 1289
yards.
Right now, the ace Indian
quarterback is only 214 yards
away from setting a new NCAA
career record for total offense,
currently held by Steve Ramsey
with 6,335 yards.
You all remember Steve
Ramsey, the pride of North Texas
State. An "average" game for Jim
against Washington State and the
record will be his.
