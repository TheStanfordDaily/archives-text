Chinese Test H-Bomb
WASHINGTON — Communist China has resumed nuclear
testing with a three megaton atmospheric blast after more
than a year's lapse, the Atomic Energy Commission
announced Wednesday. It also said Soviet Russia had
apparently set off a six megaton underground nuclear
detonation, its largest since the limited test ban treaty
became effective in 1963.
At the same time, the AEC reported the United States
had itself touched off an underground nuclear blast
Wednesday — the first time in history three nations
presumably conducted tests on the same day.
The U.S. nuclear explosion was described as equivalent
to the detonation of 20,000 to 200 ,000 tons of TNT. A
megaton is equivalent to one million tons of TNT.
Hope Fades In Quebec
MONTREAL - Hopes faded for the early release of James
Richard Cross, British trade commissioner in Montreal, and
Pierre Laporte, Quebec's labor minister, who were kidnaped
by the Quebec Liberation Front last week.
The front's negotiator, Robert Lemieus, a Montreal
Lawyer, refused to resume Wednesday's discussions unless
the government altered its position. The provincial
government has refused the major request, the release of 23
convicted terrorists or those jailed awaiting trial, so they
could go to Cuba or Algeria.
$250,000 Bail Set
NKW YORK — Angela Davis, the black revolutionist
captured here and accused of flight to avoid murder and
kidnap charges in California, was first held in $25 0,0 00 bail
Wednesday, then released by federal authorities and
immediately rearrested by city police.
The action was a prelude to legal moves to return her to

California to answer charges connected with a courthouse
gunfight in which four persons perished.
The 2 6 year old Marxist scholar and former UCLA
professor has been accused of buying the guns used in the
shootout Aug. 7 in the Marin County Courthouse at San
Rafael. Superior Court Judge Harold J. Haley, taken
hostage; two convicts, and the youth who invaded the
courtroom with the weapons, all died in the shootout.
Miss Davis had been sought for nearly two months and
had been on the FBl's 1 0 most wanted list. She and a male
companion were arrested Tuesday night at a Manhattan
motel.
Blast Dedicated To Davis
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Harvard University's Center for
International Affairs was bombed Wednesday morning. A
women's radical group claimed credit for the attack, saying
it was dedicated to Angela Davis.
Miss Davis, sought since August on murder and kidnap
charges, was arrested in New York Tuesday night several
hours before the Harvard bombing.
No one was injured in the explosion on the top floor of
the ivy-covered brick building that has been the target of
past radical student attacks. State police estimated damage
at $40,000.
A telephone caller with a female voice warned campus
police to have the building evacuated before the bombing.
Articles in "Ramparts" and the Harvard Crimson have
charged the Development Advisory Service, housed in the
center, with manipulating political institutions in
developing countries.
In a letter to the Associated Press Boston office, "The
Proud Eagle Tribe, a group of revolutionary women,"
claimed responsibility for the bombing and for summer
disturbances in the Boston area.
"This our tribe's first action, is part of a national fall
offensive by tribes of kids all over to attack the enemy
everywhere he shows his ugly face."

No one was injured in the explosion on the top floor of
the ivy-covered brick building that has been the target of
past radical student attacks. State police estimated damage
at $40,000.
A telephone caller with a female voice warned campus
police to have the building evacuated before the bombing.
Articles in "Ramparts" and the Harvard Crimson have
charged the Development Advisory Service, housed in the
center, with manipulating political institutions in
developing countries.
In a letter to the Associated Press Boston office, "The
Proud Eagle Tribe, a group of revolutionary women,"
claimed responsibility for the bombing and for summer
disturbances in the Boston area.
"This our tribe's first action, is part of a national fall
offensive by tribes of kids all over to attack the enemy
everywhere he shows his ugly face."
Chinese Test H-Bomb
WASHINGTON — Communist China has resumed nuclear
testing with a three megaton atmospheric blast after more
than a year's lapse, the Atomic Energy Commission
announced Wednesday. It also said Soviet Russia had
apparently set off a six megaton underground nuclear
detonation, its largest since the limited test ban treaty
became effective in 1963.
At the same time, the AEC reported the United States
had itself touched off an underground nuclear blast
Wednesday — the first time in history three nations
presumably conducted tests on the same day.
The U.S. nuclear explosion was described as equivalent
to the detonation of 20,000 to 200 ,000 tons of TNT. A
megaton is equivalent to one million tons of TNT.
Hope Fades In Quebec
MONTREAL - Hopes faded for the early release of James
Richard Cross, British trade commissioner in Montreal, and
Pierre Laporte, Quebec's labor minister, who were kidnaped
by the Quebec Liberation Front last week.
The front's negotiator, Robert Lemieus, a Montreal
Lawyer, refused to resume Wednesday's discussions unless
the government altered its position. The provincial
government has refused the major request, the release of 23
convicted terrorists or those jailed awaiting trial, so they
could go to Cuba or Algeria.
$250,000 Bail Set
NKW YORK — Angela Davis, the black revolutionist
captured here and accused of flight to avoid murder and
kidnap charges in California, was first held in $25 0,0 00 bail
Wednesday, then released by federal authorities and
immediately rearrested by city police.
The action was a prelude to legal moves to return her to

California to answer charges connected with a courthouse
gunfight in which four persons perished.
The 2 6 year old Marxist scholar and former UCLA
professor has been accused of buying the guns used in the
shootout Aug. 7 in the Marin County Courthouse at San
Rafael. Superior Court Judge Harold J. Haley, taken
hostage; two convicts, and the youth who invaded the
courtroom with the weapons, all died in the shootout.
Miss Davis had been sought for nearly two months and
had been on the FBl's 1 0 most wanted list. She and a male
companion were arrested Tuesday night at a Manhattan
motel.
Blast Dedicated To Davis
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Harvard University's Center for
International Affairs was bombed Wednesday morning. A
women's radical group claimed credit for the attack, saying
it was dedicated to Angela Davis.
Miss Davis, sought since August on murder and kidnap
charges, was arrested in New York Tuesday night several
hours before the Harvard bombing.
