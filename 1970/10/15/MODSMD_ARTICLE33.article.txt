# Tunney Cancels Speaking Date
## 
### 
John Tunney will not be speaking
here today. The reasons for his speech
cancellation are disputed, however.
A reputable source informed the
Daily last night that San Jose Mercury
political editor Harry Farrell will charge
in a column today that Tunney pulled
out of the engagement because "he did
not want to be interviewed by a Gubser
supporter, a student militant, and a
person he didn't know."
But aides for the Senate candidate
vehemently denied the charge. Youth
Director Bob Klein explained that
campaign officials decided to cancel
when they realized that Tunney would
be speaking in a small auditorium "witn
insufficient media coverage."
Klein said: "We had asked the
University for the maximum exposure
to students in Memorial Auditorium.
But we were given the Art Auditorium
instead. So, we decided that if we had
to have the small auditorium we would
need good media coverage."
Leo Ba/.ile, a Stanford coordinator
for the candidate said later that "some
fundraiser" was judged to be more
important considering media coverage.
Bob Beyers of the University News
Service noted, however, that Tunney
forces in San Francisco have known for
some time about the extent of the news
coverage.
The students who were scheduled to
question Tunney were Young
Republicans head Don Ayers, former
Daily editor Margie Wolf, and Larry
Diamond.
