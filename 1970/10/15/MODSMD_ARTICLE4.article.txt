# Irregularities Charged
## Senate Elections Delayed 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
All ballots cast in yesterday's ASSU
Senate election have been declared
invalid by Elections Commissioner
Chris Banks, who then postponed the
election until Tuesday, October 20 and
Wednesday, October 21.
Banks made his decision in response
to numerous complaints about
irregularities on the Senate ballot. A
news release by the Commissioner
stated that "there were many
typographical errors on the ballot,
including mistakes in the spelling of
candidates' names and their proper
listing on the ballot."
According to Banks, the ballots were
proofread before the election, but the
errors escaped the attention of the
reader. Banks also pointed to illegal
electioneering as a reason for
postponement of the election. He
charged that campaign posters had been
hung too close to the election tables.
In his statement, the Commissioner
stated that "it is a firm rule . . . that
there will be no electioneering within
1 00 feet of the polling places."
Registration Rolls
The commissioner also moved to
stop students from voting outside their
division. An unofficial observer told the
Daily that he believes that as many as
25 people cast their ballots for
candidates outside their division during
a ten minute period yesterday.

However, on Tuesday, each polling
place will be provided with a list of
students and their majors to serve as a
registration roll.
In all previous elections, no attempt
has ever been made to certify the major
of a voter. Bob Grant of the ASSU
Council of Presidents told the Daily
that the cost of obtaining computer
printoffs would be prohibitive. Banks
did not mention that any great expense
was involved in obtaining registration
rolls from the Registrar's Office.
Report Irregularities
Banks' statement concluded that
" ... it is much to my regret that this

decision had to be made, but in the
interest of conducting as fair and
equitable election as possible, it was
unavoidable."
No changes will be made in the
present ballot other than those
requested by the candidates concerning
the spelling of their names.
All candidates should come to the
ASSU office, examine the posted ballot
to insure that their names are spelled
properly and that they are listed in the
proper division. All irregularities must
be reported to the Elections
Commissioner by Thursday, October
15 at 5 p.m.
