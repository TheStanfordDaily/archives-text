# Draft Guidance
## Procedures For Delaying Induction 
### 
(The material in this urticle was
compiled by Elise Becket,
President of the Graduate
Students Association, and Norton
Tooby, a teacher's assistant in the
Law School and a member of the
Law Commune.)
The following memo was
written to assist men who wished
to delay an induction order us
long as possible. Since it now
appears that men with lottery
numbers higher than 200 will not
be called this year, many men
with higher numbers will wish to
expedite their re-classification to

I-A in order to accept their
liability for call-up this year.
Information in this memo is not
intended to be a substitute for
counseling. Changes in the
regulations and practices of the
Selective Service System occur
frequently, and written
information may soon become
outdated or may not apply in
your particular case. If you have
any questions about your draft
situation you can find a
hnowledgable counselor in room
324, Old Union or by calling ext.
3381.
As you are probably well
aware, the recent changes in the
draft have increased the likelihood
that graduate students with
lottery numbers below 200 will
receive induction orders. You may
already have been called for a
physical exam. But even if you
pass the physical, there are still a
number of procedures within the
Selective Service System provided

for by law which will delay the
issuance of an induction notice.
If you receive an induction
order after you enter school this
fall, you can request a
postponement of induction until
next June. Unless the President
changes the present executive
order, this postponement must be
granted. While this merely defers
the induction date, and does not
change your classification, or
permit you further rights of
appeal, it may have at least two
advantages:

1. There are special research
programs in the Army you may
be able to enter, which usually
require an M.A. degree.
2. Who knows what may
happen by next June? Nixon
claims he wants eventually to
end the draft, and perhaps he'll
do it by then (or more likely,
fewer draftees will be going to
Vietnam).
By utilizing some or all of the
procedures listed below, you can
delay issuance of an induction
order and increase your chances
of obtaining a postponement of
induction for the academic year.
The sequence of events starts
when you receive your first 1-A
classification. You have 30 days
from the mailing date stamped on
your card to request a personal
appearance before your board.
You cannot be sent an induction
notice while this and the
following procedures are in
progress. If you wish the
maximum delay, wait up to 30
days (but not over 30 days!) to
send a letter to your local board
requesting a personal appearance.
In this letter you can explain why
you want the personal
appearance, but you need not.
You need only say "I request a
personal appearance." If there is
any doubt whatever that you will
be able to appear when your
appearance is scheduled, your
request should say: "I wish to
request a personal appearance
and, if necessary, an appeal with
regard to my classification." (Men
who for any reason fail to appear
for a personal appearance may
find they have lost their right to
appeal if they have not mentioned
an appeal in their request for a
personal appearance.)
It is important to keep a
carbon or xerox copy of
everything you send your board,
and to mail letters "Certified Mail,
Return Receipt Requested." This
costs 4 5 cents but provides proof
of when materials were sent and
received.
In the same letter in which you
request a personal appearance,
you may wish to ask for an
appointment with the
Government Appeal Agent (a
local lawyer who volunteers to
talk to registrants about their
draft situation). Ask that his

appointment be scheduled for a
time prior to your personal
appearance, e.g. "I request an
appointment with the
Government Appeal Agent before
my personal appearance is
scheduled." If possible, check
with a counselor about the
Government Appeal Agent at
your local board before requesting
an appointment.
Classifications
The eight most common
classifications men claim other
than I-A are:
i-A-O: Conscientious Objector
opposed to combatant duty
and available for
noncombatant duty only
(usually medical corps).
I-O: Conscientious Objector
opposed to both combatant
and noncombatant military
duty and available for
assignment to civilian
alternative service.
If you are thinking of applying
for either a I-A-0 or a 1-0 try to
get a copy of Handbook for
Conscientious Objectors ($l.O 0)
and Guide to the Draft by Tatum
& Ti.chinsky, ($1.95 ). You can get
these books or the name of a
bookstore that stocks them from
a local draft counselor. Be sure to
talk to a draft counselor or draft
lawyer as soon as possible if you
are seriously considering filing a
Form 150 (Special Form for
Conscientious Objectors). A C.O.
claim will re-open your case and
reinstate your appeal rights, if it is
made prior to issuance of an
induction order. It is important
when making a claim to include
two things in the initial letter: 1)
a statement that you are a
Conscientious Objector and 2) a
request for the form 150. YOU
SHOULD TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THAT THE
LONGER YOU WAIT THE LESS
YOUR CHANCE OF
OBTAINING THESE
CLASSIFICATIONS.
I-Y: Qualified for service only
in time of war or declared state
of national emergency for
physical, mental, or
administrative reasons.
IV-F: Deferment for a man not
qualified for any service for
physical, mental, or
administrative reasons.
If you claim a I-Y or IV-F, you
should first check whether the
condition which may disqualify
you is listed in the Army Medical
Standards. A draft counselor or
lawyer will have a copy of these
standards. It is essential to get
into your file complete
documentation of your disabilities
from your physician, psychiatrist,
etc. If you have not yet been
ordered for a pre-Induction
Physical Examination, you may
request an interview with your
local board's Medical Advisor or
under a new Local Board
Memorandum you may request a
pre-Induction Physical
Examination. Be sure to take
copies of all documentation with
you to the interview or
examination, keeping at least one
set in your own files.
I-S (C): Emergency student
deferment until end of
academic year. Available to
some graduate students
depending upon location of
local board and Federal Court
decisions in their districts. See
a draft counselor if you think
you may qualify.
11-S: For graduates in Medical
or allied fields. Some
exceptions in extremely rare
cases.
IV-D: For theological students
planning to enter the ministry.
If you have any questions
about these classifications, see
a counselor.

11-A: (hardship). It is the
assumption of the Selective
Service System that a hardship
is imposed on anyone who is
drafted. To qualify for 111-A
one must prove that induction
would cause an extreme
hardship. This extreme
hardship might be a) financial
b) emotional (such as wife,
child, relative, etc. emotionally
dependent on the registrant) or
c) situation involving personal
service or care (such as an
invalid dependent upon the
registrant). Documentation of
situation is essential.
New (11-A and 11-C)
occupational and (111-A)
fatherhood deferments were
eliminated recently by
presidential order. It is still
possible to get renewals, or
occasionally a new
classificationâ€”if the original
request was submitted before
April 23 , 1 970.
Unless you are a sole surviving
son (IV-A), in the reserves (I-D),
or an elected official or judge
(IV-B), that just about covers the
possible classifications. The
deferments covered here have not
been listed in the order in which
you should consider them. Every
situation is different.
After your personal appearance
you will receive a new
classification card. If you get your
requested classification,
congratulations! If you receive
another I-A, you again have 30
days in which to appeal. The
appeal letter is written to your
local board, requesting that the
State Appeal Board review your
case. All you have to say is "I
request an appeal," but if you
wish you can also add corrections
and clarifications to information
considered by the local board or
which they refused to consider.
Also, in the same letter you may
wish to request that an
appointment with the
Government Appeal Agent be
scheduled for you before your file
is sent out to the Appeal Board. If
you saw him before your personal
appearance, this request may not
be honored, but there is no harm
in trying.
Local Board
If at this time you are living in
a different place from your local
board, you have the option of
transferring your appeal to the
Appeal Board in the area in which
you now live. This is an issue to
discuss with a draft counselor
familiar with the two Appeal
Boards involved. There are four
Appeal Boards in California:
Sacramento, San Francisco, Los
Angeles, and San Diego.
At any time you can ask your
local board to reopen your case
and consider new information.
You must present strong evidence
that your circumstances have
sufficiently changed. If your
board reopens your file you have
new rights to personal appearance
and appeal, even if they reject
your new claim. Thus, reopening
produces a major delay in your
case. A good time to consider
requesting your board to reopen
your case is after your file has
been sent to the appeal board but
before you receive an induction
notice. After an induction order it
is almost impossible to persuade
the board to reopen your case.
If you need to find out exactly
what is in your file, you can go to
your local board and look at it. If
you are unable to go in person,
you can authorize someone else to
go for you. Simply send a letter to
the individual you wish to do the
checking addressed to your local
board. For example:
July 20,1 970
Local Board No. 9 4
Pasadena, Calif.
TX'ar Sirs,
I give John Public, my father,
permission to review my file and

copy any information therein.
John Public, Jr.
SS 0 4 -9 4 -4 8 -2 8 8 7
When the person you have
authorized brings the letter to the
draft board it will be entered into
your file, and for a year he will
have the right to read anything in
it.
Summary
Here is a common scenario of
moves and countermoves.
Local Board: Sends you a I-A
Within 30 days request a
personal appearance and
appointment with the
Government Appeal Agent to be
scheduled before the personal
appearance.
Local Board: Schedules
appointment with Agent
Go if convenient. If not
possible write the board
explaining why you cannot
attend.
Local Board: Schedules
Personal Appearance
Send draft board as much
supporting evidence as possible
(now is a good time to read Face
to Face with You; Draft Board by
Allan Blackman). Go to
appearance if at all possible. If
you can't make it, write a letter to
board explaining why; ask that
your file to sent to Appeal Board.
Local Board: 1. Gives you the
classification, 2. Sends you a new
I-A
1. Celebrate. 2. Within 30 days
request an appeal and another
appointment with Agent to be
scheduled BEFORE they send
your file out.
Local Board: Sends your file
out to the Appeal Board

If you ever want to apply for
another classification, send
request after file is sent out to
appeal board but before it returns.
Appeal Board: 1. Gives you the
classification. 2. Turn you down,
but not unanimously (very
unlikely!). 3. Turns you down
unanimously
1. Celebrate. 2 . Within 30 days
ask for appeal with National
Board. 3. Either request a
reopening, or wait for an
induction notice.
Local Board: Sends you an
induction notice
If in school, request a
postponement. If not, at this
point registrant has to decide
whether or not he can accept
induction. If not he should discuss
the alternatives with a good
counselor or attorney.
Try to contact a draft
counselor or draft lawyer if at all
possible. Some draft lawyers and
counselors give free clinics or
classes which you can find out
about from a draft counselor. If
you need to retain a lawyer, you
can then do so. In the Bay Area
free legal counsel is possible
through the Selective Service
Lawyers Panel at the time a man
is arraigned for a violation of draft
law.
Each situation is specialâ€”yours
is probably not covered by the
general information given so far.
