Tokenism'
(The following is an open letter
to president Richard Lyman.)
With regard to the two days in
early November intended for use
by Stanford students and faculty
in participating in political
campaign work, members of the
Free Campus Movement have the
following opinions to express:
1 . Many students and faculty,
rightly or wrongly, have no desire
to actively participate in the
political process. They resent the
fact that their activities will be
interrupted, without their advice
or consent, by an administrative
act that can only be termed
political tokenism. The Free
Campus Movement does not take
a position for or against the
decision, but we accept it for
what it is.

2. The decision to grant a
two-day leave of absence in the
name of political relevance is no
more than a sop thrown to those
who desire political involvement.
Evidence has shown that a
last -minute influx of
inexperienced students not only
will do little to help the candidate
or the issue, but will actually be a
detriment. To be meaningful, the
political leave should be at least
two weeks; as it is, the two days
serve only to lend an attractive
aura of Liberalism ond
educational progressivism to the
Stanford administration.
3. Most importantly, the
administration has chosen to
ignore the 6000 individuals who
make up the university staff. This
action is particularly
discriminatory because, while
students and faculty could
conceivably set aside several hours
each day for political
involvement, a staff member has
no such opportunity. The
assumption that students and
faculty are interested in the
political process while staff
members are not, or that staff
members are somehow not
deserving of the opportunity to
participate while students and
faculty are, is unconscionably
elitist. The administration,
however, implies by its action that
it indeed holds this assumption.
By way of illustration, if the
administration of Hewlett-Packard
decided to grant a two-day leave
to management personnel but not
to production workers, the
blatancy of this discrimination
would be evident. The same
situation is occurring at Stanford,
but the so-called "liberals" are
oblivious to the inequality.
We of the Free Campus
Movement strongly urge that the
workers of Stanford University be
given the two days off on
November 2 and 3. Barring this,
the entire proposal should be
reconsidered, as it is prejudicial to
the rights of fiOOO members of the
Stanford Community.

to management personnel but not
to production workers, the
blatancy of this discrimination
would be evident. The same
situation is occurring at Stanford,
but the so-called "liberals" are
oblivious to the inequality.
We of the Free Campus
Movement strongly urge that the
workers of Stanford University be
given the two days off on
November 2 and 3. Barring this,
the entire proposal should be
reconsidered, as it is prejudicial to
the rights of fiOOO members of the
Stanford Community.
Free Campus Movement
Tokenism'
(The following is an open letter
to president Richard Lyman.)
With regard to the two days in
early November intended for use
by Stanford students and faculty
in participating in political
campaign work, members of the
Free Campus Movement have the
following opinions to express:
1 . Many students and faculty,
rightly or wrongly, have no desire
to actively participate in the
political process. They resent the
fact that their activities will be
interrupted, without their advice
or consent, by an administrative
act that can only be termed
political tokenism. The Free
Campus Movement does not take
a position for or against the
decision, but we accept it for
what it is.

2. The decision to grant a
two-day leave of absence in the
name of political relevance is no
more than a sop thrown to those
who desire political involvement.
Evidence has shown that a
last -minute influx of
inexperienced students not only
will do little to help the candidate
or the issue, but will actually be a
detriment. To be meaningful, the
political leave should be at least
two weeks; as it is, the two days
serve only to lend an attractive
aura of Liberalism ond
educational progressivism to the
Stanford administration.
3. Most importantly, the
administration has chosen to
ignore the 6000 individuals who
make up the university staff. This
action is particularly
discriminatory because, while
students and faculty could
conceivably set aside several hours
each day for political
involvement, a staff member has
no such opportunity. The
assumption that students and
faculty are interested in the
political process while staff
members are not, or that staff
members are somehow not
deserving of the opportunity to
participate while students and
faculty are, is unconscionably
elitist. The administration,
however, implies by its action that
it indeed holds this assumption.
By way of illustration, if the
administration of Hewlett-Packard
decided to grant a two-day leave
to management personnel but not
to production workers, the
blatancy of this discrimination
would be evident. The same
situation is occurring at Stanford,
but the so-called "liberals" are
oblivious to the inequality.
