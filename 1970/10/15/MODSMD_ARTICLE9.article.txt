## Age Of Paranoia

It was the Age of Anxiety but
now it has evolved - and swiftly â€¢
into the Age of Paranoia, with
rock stars isolated in their
Manhattan hideouts or Beverly
Hills mansions, presidents
rejecting reports which challenge
their pre-conceived ideas and
nobody at all believing anyone.
First James Bond and then
Mission: Impossible and
Alexander Munday (the folk
heroes of the second television
generation) have convinced us of
the possibility of absolutely
anything and removed the stout
old Missouri ethic of "Show me!"
Anything is possible in this most
impossible of all possible worlds,
so Angela Davis could be in
Birmingham, pick up a $1200
check (where did she cash it?) and
vanish five minutes ahead of the
police who several days later had
to admit she wasn't there at all,
despite their original claim of an
eyewitness informer.
Outlaw Virus
ESP Records, a New York
firm, is releasing an album by
Charles Manson, Linda Kasabian is
writing a book and the memoirs
of Albert Speer are so tame as to
cause hardly a stir except in the
rarefied atmosphere of World War
II and German historical circles.
Canada conducts a serious study
on the feasibility of legalizing
marijuana, a Canadian official
predicts it will be done within five
years, and in Los Angeles, police
club long haired patrons of the
rock concerts if they appear to be
smoking something from other
than Marlboro country.
Every wack-out with a grudge
wraps himself in the flag of "the
movement" or "the revolution"
(and then becomes the specific by
which every establishment crazy
judges it) and a Berkeley
policeman is murdered, and
murder is never anything but
murder. It's like a plague, an
outlaw virus gone past control and
eating away at the heart of
everything. The rich get richer and
the poor get poorer, as my father
used to say, but today the far-outs
get further out and the hard hats
get harder headed. And on one of

the UHF channels, there's a TV
show with a genuine Country-
Western singer and a hippie,
hillbilly band. Cultural
cross-fertilization, all right.
The Rock Festivals
John Canady, the New York
Times critic, in an interview with
Edwin Newman on KQED, says
no art can be justified if it doesn't
sustain itself; opera is performed
in museums (chief of which is the
Metropolital Opera House), and
the new rock music is a thrilling
example of the impossibility of
suppressing art. Canady says he
would rather watch the true
expressiveness of young people
dancing to rock than see the
ballet. In most major cities
(including this one), he will have
to go to very informal
establishments, indeed, to indulge
his taste, since rock music for
dancing cannot be presented in
the Civic Auditorium, Harmon
Gym and many other places.
This summer the rock festivals
showed that young people have a
deep and abiding desire to gather
together in huge numbers (for
comfort? safety? reinforcement of
their own image? joy, perhaps?)
anywhere at all. Even, it turned
out, at festivals which were halted
by law and from which electricity
for the bands was removed. And
the doctor at Powder Ridge said
his biggest problem was the
absence of music.
We adults yearn for the good
old days when right was right and
wrong was wrong and why won't
they take advantage of what our
money has built for them and
study? And the young people
yearn for a simple life, too, with
just as many contradictions and
paradoxes, rustic music energized
from a plug in the wall and a 60
cyclc current. When they showed
the preparations on TV for the
huge battle between Cromwell's
pike-wielding infantry and the
Cavalier's light-hearted charges,
the presence of Landrovers and
station wagons on the set didn't
even look out of place.
"Rejoice! Rejoice! We have no
choice!" Crosby, Stills, Nash and
Young sing, defining art in the
face of technology while charging
$10 a seat for concerts and
wearing $5 00 fur jackets. And a
young girl, spare changing on a

city street, is subjected to a
citizen's arrest by a city official
because she won't give him her
parents' phone number. Selective
enforcement is the rule. Would
she be permitted to effect a
citizen's arrest on him for
jaywalking?
The Circular World
Linear thought splinters in the
face of the circular world which is
rounder than even that Genoan
sailor believed those few short
centuries ago. Far out depends on
where you are and it becomes
harder and harder to structure
rules and regulations in a world of
constantly shifting ideas and
values, where steam may now save
us from gasoline many years after
the Stanley brothers and Andrew
Doble broke their hearts and
spent their fortunes trying where
a conscious drive to induce young
people to drink beer is under way
and with the danger from
cigarettes known to all, the coffin
nail may be replaced by the cigar,
too late to indulge in pure
Havana. Will we yet recognize
Castro to placate the tobacco
companies?
The jazz festivals, outposts of
new music and avant-garde ideas
in their time, are now citadels of
conservatism, increasingly
purveyors of YMCA Muzak and
occasions for rejection of today
(much less the promise of
tomorrow) and Miles Davis'
booking agency (now Bill
Graham) asks him to turn them
down.
"Is there never to be a place
where a man that's drunk can lay
his head?" Thomas Mitchell cried
out in John Ford's great study of
paranoia, the film version of
O'Neill's "The Long Voyage
Home." And the average man is
more and more like Gippo Nolan
in Ford's other classic, "The
Informer," who said "the Irish
think I'm with the English and the
English think I'm with the
Irish ..."
Who's the Hero?
Can a house divided against
itself in so many ways, on so
many levels, continue to endure?
Can there even be in this age one
nation indivisable when Berkeley
is not only 3000 miles from New
Haven but several eons in time as

well? The real heroes of Kent
State, says A 1 Capp, whose
Dogpatch was just as much our
birthplace as Gasoline Alley, were
the National Guard who fired on
the students. Who is the victim
and who is the hero in these days
are are they not all victims rather
of a world they never made,
struggling, like Anatole Broyard's
beetle, to get straight?
We've gone now from the
bohemian to the hippster, from
the beatnik to the hippie and
where we go next is
unpredictable. Abbie Hoffman
sayd "Bring the war home. Kill
your parents." And Jerry Rubin
humorlessly transforms that into
"Be prepared to kill your
parents." The put-on is taken
seriously and the truth disappears
in a world whose kaleidoscope
shifts make referents impossible.
And anyway, how can
anything be far out now?
