# Study To Clarify Faculty Discipline
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
After lengthy discussion, the
Faculty Senate yesterday agreed that
existing procedures for faculty
self-discipline should be studied and
clarified.
In a motion carried by voice vote
without dissent, the Senate moved that
its Committee on Committees consider
mechanisms "to set up a range of
penalties" and procedures "for the
adjudication of appeal from these
penalties."
Legislation passed in October, 1968,
establishes the two extreme boundaries
for penalties. These two are censure
and "procedures leading to dismissal."
The Senate now hopes to establish
intermediate sanctions.
A committee created this summer
by the Stanford chapter of the America
Association of University Professors is
currently studying several aspects of
faculty self-discipline. The existing
on-campus mechanisms for dealing with
this question are the Stanford Judicial
Council, a joint student-faculty group,
and the Advisory Board, an elected
faculty group.
In his address to the faculty body,
President Richard Lyman outlined the
preparations for the upcoming
negotiations with the federal
government on the question on indirect
cost returns for federally-financed
research projects.
Shadowing Budget Concerns
Lyman described these negotiations
as being "under the shadow" of both
University and government budget and
finance concerns.
Tightening money may cause the
government to reduce research project
funding for indirect costs - costs for
equipment, and laboratory facilities,
for instance - so that the burden of
these costs will fall on the University.
A study of the University's
negotiating posture towards the
government was completed last June,
Lyman reported.
Lyman also noted that the Army has
accepted the Senate's proposals for the

phasing-out of its ROTC program.
Discussion followed on the current
status of freshmen receiving credit for
sophomore-level ROTC courses. (See

The third point in Lyman's address
concerned the prospective
establishment of a Consultative
Committee on the Provostship. Citing
the "urgency" of the need to appoint a
Provost, Lyman said "I would rather
have a consultative committee."
While noting that this committee
would accept suggestions from all
interested parties, he said that their
primary responsibility would be "to
receive suggestions from me, consider
an investigate these suggestions, and
report back to me."
Lyman stated that the prospective
committee would operate with the
"active collaboration" of the
Committee on Committees and, he
hoped, with the collaboration of the
student government.
In other actions, the Steering
Committee of the Senate recommended
that a representative from the San Jose
