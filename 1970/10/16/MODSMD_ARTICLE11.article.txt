## Extremists In America 
### jonathan dedmon j. edgar hoover 
(The following is an open letter to students from FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover.)
As a 197 0 college student, you belong to the best educated, most
sophisticated, most poised generation in our history.
The vast majority of you, I am convinced, sincerely love America
and want to make it a better country.
You do have ideas of your own—and that's good. You see things
wrong in our society which we adults perhaps have minimized or
overlooked.
You are outspoken and frank and hate hypocrisy. That is good too.
There's nothing wrong with student dissent or student demands for
changes in society or the display of student unhappiness over aspects
of our national policy. Student opinion is a legitimate aspect of public
opinion in our society.
Danger of Extremism
But there is real ground for concern about the extremism which led
to violence, lawlessness and disrespect for the rights of others on
many college campuses during the past year.
The extremists are a small minority of students and faculty
members who have lost faith in America. They ridicule the flag, poke
fun at American institutions, seek to destroy our society. They are
not interested in genuine reform. They take advantage of the tensions,
strife and often legitimate frustrations of students to promote campus
chaos. They have no rational, intelligent plan of the future either for
the university or the nation.
The extremists are of wide variety : adherents of the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) including the Weatherman; members of the
Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), the Trotskyist youth group; the
Communist Party's Young Workers Liberation League (YWLL). Or
they may be associated with the Student Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam (SMC), a Trotskyist dominated antiwar
group.
Learn to Recognize
Many are not associated with any national group. They (sic) key
point is not so much the identification of extremists but learning to
recognize and understand the mentality of extremism which believes
in violence and destruction.
Based on our experience in the FBI, here are some of the ways in
which extremists will try to lure you into their activities:
1. They'll encourage you to lose respect for your parents and the
older generation. This will be one of their first attacks, trying to cut
you off from home. You'll hear much about the "failures" and
"hypocrisy" of your parents and theij friends. The older generation
has made mistakes. But—your parents and millions of other adults
worked hard, built, sacrified and suffered to make America what it is
today. It is their country too. You may disagree with them, but don't
discredit their contributions.
College Irrelevant
2. They'll try to convert you to the idea that your college is
"irrelevant" and a "tool of the establishment." The attack against the
college administration often is bitter, arrogant and unreasoning.
SDSers, for example, have sought to disrupt the colleges by
demanding the right to select professors, determine the curriculum
and set grading standards.
3. They'll ask you to abandon your basic common sense. Campus
extremism thrives on specious generalizations, wild accusations and
unverified allegations. Complex issues of state are wrapped in slogans
and cliches. Dogmatic statements are issued as if they were the final
truth. You should carefully examine the facts. Don't blindly follow
courses of action suggested by extremists. Don't get involved in a
cause just because it seems "fashionable" or the "thing to do."
Rational discussion and rational analysis are needed more than ever
before.
4. They'll try to envelop you in a mood of negativism, pessimism and
alienation toward yourself, your school, your nation. This is one of
the most insidious of New Left poisons. SDS and its allies judge
America exclusively from its flaws. They see nothing good, positive
and constructive. This leads to a philosophy of bitterness, defeatism
and rancor. I would like you to know your country more intimately. I
would want you to look for the deeper unifying forces in America,
the moods of national character, determination and sacrifice which
are working to correct these flaws. The real strength of our nation is
the power of morality, decency and conscience which rights the
wrong, corrects error and works for equal opportunity under the law.
Democratic Powerlessness
5. They'll ask you to believe that you, as a student and citizen, are
powerless by democratic means to effect change in our society.
Remember the books on American history you have read. They tell
the story of the creative self-renewal of this nation through change.
Public opinion, time after time, has brought new policies, goals and
methods. The individual is not helpless or caught in "bureaucracy" as
these extremists claim.
6. They'll encourage you to hurl bricks and stones instead of logical
argument at those who disagree with your views. I remember an old
saying: "He who strikes the first blow has run out of ideas." Violence
is as ancient as the cave man; as up-to-date as the Weatherman. Death
and injury, fear, distrust, animosity, polarization,
counterviolence—these arise from violence. The very use of violence
shows the paucity of rational thought in the SDS, its inability to come
up with any intelligent critique of our society.
Personally, I don't think the outlook for campus unrest this year is
as bleak as some prophets of pessimism proclaim. The situation at
some colleges is serious but certainly not hopeless.
Along with millions of other adults, I'm betting on the vast
majority of students who remain fair-minded, tolerant, inquisitive, but
also firm about certain basic principles of human dignity, respect for
the rights of others and a willingness to learn. I am confident our faith
has not been misplaced.

(The following is an open letter to J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, from Johnathan Dedmon, a junior.)
As a 1970 adult, you belong to the wealthiest, most powerful
generation in our history.
The vast majority of you, we are convinced, sincerely love America
and want to make it a better country.
But there is real ground for concern about the extremism which led
to violence, lawlessness, and disrespect for the rights of others on
many college campuses during the past year.
The extremists are a small group of people who have lost faith in
America. They ridicule the flag by waving it ad nauseum in the face of
serious errors in American foreign policy, they poke fun at American
institutions by loudly defending them in spite of serious flaws, and
they seek to destroy our society by refusing to admit and correct
serious malfunctions within it.
The extremists are of a wide variety: adherents to the Defense
Department, the Vice-Presidency, the John Birch Society, individual
policemen scattered across the country, soldiers in Vietnam. Or they
may be long to Rev. Maclntyre's Committee for Victory in Vietnam, a
fascist dominated war group.
The key point is not so much the identification of extremists, but
learning to recognize the mentality of extremism which believes in
violence and destruction, as in Vietnam.
Based on our experiences here at college, here are some of the ways
extremists will try to lure you into their activities:
1. They 11 encourage you to respect institutions of and for
themselves, beyond all reason, with slogans such as "America, love it
or leave it." This will be one of their first attacks, trying to cut you
off from the failures of those institutions. You'll hear much of the
extremism and disrespect of our generation. Our generation has made
mistakes but it has "worked hard, built sacrificed and suffered" to put

Lyndon Johnson in retirement and drastically alter this country's
consciousness of what is happening in Vietnam. As you say, "You
may disagree with us, but don't discredit our contributions."
2. They'll try to convert you to the idea that our college is a tool
of the radicals. As you say, "The attack against the college
administration often is bitter, arrogant and unreasoning." Witness
Spiro Agnew's attack on Yale President Kingman Brewster.
3. As you say, Mr. Hoover, "They'll ask you to abandon your basic
common sense. Extremism thrives on specious generalizations wild
accusations, and unverified allegations. Complex issues of state are
wrapped in slogans and cliches." "Radlibs," "The Yellow Peril," "The
Red Menace," "Effete snobs," these are only a few of the specious
generalizations slogans and cliches the extremist indulges in.
4. They'll encourage you to totally respect the law enforcement
officer. You point out that "most college students have good friends
who are policemen." Many college students also have good friends at
Kent and Jackson State.
5. As you say, "They'll tell you that any action is honorable and
right if it's 'sincere' or 'idealistic' in motivation." Here is one of the
more seductive Old Right appeals - that if the napalm bombadier's or
My Lai marine's heart is in the right place, if they're "defending the
freedom", if he is doing something for "humanity" or a "higher
cause," then this act, even if immoral,is justifiable. But as you say Mr.
Hoover, "Remember that acts have consequences. The alleged
sincerity of the perpetrator does not absolve him from responsibility.
His acts may affect the rights, lives, and property of others. Just being
an American does not confer immunity or grant license to violate
international law. Just because you don't like your fellow man doesn't
mean you can violate him with impunity.
6. They'll try to make you believe that you as a student or citizen
have some power by democratic means to constitute change. Tell the
black, unemployed worker on welfare that he has some say in what
has happened to his life, Mr. Hoover.
7. They'll encourage you to wave flags and put your hand on your
heart instead of logical argument at those who disagree with their
views. Violence is as ancient as the cave man; as up to date as the U.S.
Army. The very use of violence shows the paucity of rational thought
in the government, its inability to come up with any intelligent
critique of international affairs.
Mr. Hoover, in your letter to college students, you have pointed
out many elements of extremism which in fact are true. Yet what to us
is incredible is that the only groups you call as extremists are those
groups whose violence to fellow man has been infinitesimally small as
compared to what has been done in Vietnam. You cry out against the
violent extremism which would bum down a Bank of America
building, yet you would overlook the violent extremism which has
burned down a whole nation and which has decimated a whole
population, not to mention 30,000 of our own, and which creates the
violent extremism here at home. Would there have been a Kent State
if there hadn't been a Cambodia?
It is this inability to see that the violent extremism at home which
you condemn is only the symptom of the disease of violent extremism
which this mtry is perpetrating abroad that makes many of us here
at college feci our faith in your generation has been misplaced.
