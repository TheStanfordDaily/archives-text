# Dornbusch Catalyzes Changes In Academia
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
"The man is a dynamo," said a colleague, with a taint touch of
friendly awe in his voice. "It's exhausting just to watch him."
Sanford Dornbusch, chairman of the Third Academic Senate, has
left anextremely strong impression on friends, students and colleagues
in his eleven years at Stanford. One of the latter describes him as
"fenatic and incisive." His Sociology I anecdotes have reached almost
legendary fame in some circles, and his ability to be deeply involved in
a large number of projects simultaneously has become his trademark.
"He exudes surety in his judgements," said another longtime
faculty colleague, "but, even so, he has the remarkable ability to be
influenced by other points of view, and change his mind.
"He has conisderable self-faith . . . and an unbelievable energy
level," the colleague added.

Dornbusch, 4 4, is on the steering committee for the new Human
Biology program, the Committee on African Studies, and was a
member of the Faculty Advisory Committee on Presidential Selection,
one of the groups who recommended Richard Lyman to the Trustees.He
is also a former head of Stanford's Chapter of the American
Association of University Professors, and helped organize last year's
Moratoriums.
"He always seems to be willing to take on more responsibility, he
never seems to tire," said Vincent Siciliano, a student member of the
Human Biology steering committee.
Although he has considerable reputation as a mover and shaker
involved in plans and programs throughout the University, his
popularity as a teacher is hardly negligible - a fact attested to
somewhat by the lingering fame of his anecdotes among the student
body, and the size of the Sociology 1 class.
"Wow, what an incredible circus performance," one student
commented during his 'Sanctification and Justification' oration last
week. "Even when he's not saying anything you're listening."
Graduated from Syracuse University in 1 948 , Dornbusch taught at
a number of Universities around the country before coming to
Stanford as head of the Sociology Department in 1 959. In an
interview he described the University as an institution which "tries to
rise above the transient, the immediate, and the relevant to
represent... an arena for disciplined intelligence.
"Not a Field of Action"
"It isn't really a field of action," he continued,with the overlay of
a New York accent in his voice. "It's very ineffective in the area of
direct action. Universities are taking direct action in trying to get
more money from the Federal Government. I think their success there
is an accurate witness to the extent of their political clout.
"I think it's incumbent upon us to keep rethinking what our goals
are. The University has to have its own set of goals, and watch that
those goals aren't diverted," he said.
During the interview, Dornbusch discussed in some detail the
dangers he saw sacing universities at the moment. "The greatest and
most immediate danger," he said, "is a lack of concensus on the
practice of making and accepting decisions. I don't believe that
democratic processes, administrative processes, or any other kinds of
processes necessarily lead to good decisions.
"But I'd rather take compromises and second-best decisions by
processes that can be changed than have a situation - which we're on

the verge of when people say 'We don't accept that decision and we
will grind the machine to a halt unless we win.'
"Even if I agree with the reason they feel this way, I think they are
more of an immediate danger than the original problems which led to
this concern."
Speaking to the Faculty Senate during the crises of last Spring,
Dornbusch declared that "Rule by a succession of morally convinced
minorities would be worse than our current lousy system of univeristy
decision making."
"Worse Than McCarthy Era
After cataloguing in the interview a number of perils confronting
universities - their potential repudiation by society, the current attack
upon the humanities - Dornbusch declared that the atmosphere now
surrounding universities is "in some ways worse than the McCarthy
era. Now you have to worry about freedom of expression in so many
forms.
"Most faculty" are scared stiff... not that their immediate
self-interest is going to be attacked, but rather that certain values
they're taken for "granted are now under attack, and many people
don't realize the importance of those values - like objectivity, mutual
respect, willingness to listen to the other side.
"I'd like the university to be a place where facist pigs can speak
their piece without any problems," he added.
Displaying at times during the interview an air of practised
sociability, Dornbusch often paused and looked out the window for
long seconds while framing his answer to a question.
When the subject of the Faculty Senate was brought up,
Dornbusch was strongly enthusiastic in his evaluation of its
performance during the two years of its existence.
"It's much better than any previous institution for expressing
faculty opinion - and that doesn't mean that it's performed well," he
remarked.
"The thing that's good about it is that it's big enough and diverse
enough so that all factions of the faculty have been represented. It's

small enough so that one can talk to another any they can really learn
the facts on the various issues."
Dornbusch feels very strongly that the perspectives of all the
faculty should be represented on the Senate. "They should not let the
Senate be completely seperate from their perspectives," he said. "The
faculty ought to provide at least some energizing force."
For a man so quick and assured in deciding on his courses of
action, Dornbusch's start in the field of sociology was fairly typical.
A Book for Each Topic
"Because I was a junior when I came back to Syracuse, they said I
had to have a major. So I went to the Navy library and took out a
book on every topic I thought I might conceivably major in.
"The book I took out for sociology was The Making of Society,
edited by V.F. Calvertson. It had selections from Jesus, Nietsche,
Marx, Hitler ... everything under the sun. I thought "Here's a way I
can make a choice and not make a choice.
"I didn't realize till later that that's not the way sociology was."
Dornbusch's latest major project, is not a major new innovation in
the University curriculum, nor is it a dramatic suggestion for
revamping of the structure of University Governance. Instead, it's the
construction of a Youruba mud shrine, a literal outgrowth of his
course last Spring in the "Sociology of Religion". According to
informed sources, the shrine is almost complete - but Dornbusch still
visits it at six a.m. some mornings to plaster mud on its walls.
Married in 195 0 to Barbara Farnham, Dornbusch describes his wife
as "someone who has been fighting the women's liberation battle ever
since we met."
Dornbusch mentioned quite seriously the benefit of his talks with
his two teenage sons. "I learn a lot from them," he said. "I think it
helps me."
When one of Dornbusch's colleagues was asked if they thought he
would ever slow down, the reply was, "He's been an activist all his life
- he's always doing one thing with his right hand and another with his
left."
"He'll burn out rather than slow down."
