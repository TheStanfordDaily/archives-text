# Trips to Russia Foster Understanding
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
In 1961, a crackly telephone
call came from Stan ford-in-Italy.
"Dad," the voice said, "A bunch
of people are trying to organize a
trip to the Soviet Union during
three-week break, and I want to
go." On the line in Palo Alto was
Dr. Paul Handley, now Associate
Director of Overseas Dampuses.
His reply to this request, from his
daughter was a firm, "Don't go!"
The next correspondence Dr.
Handley received from his
daughter was a postcard mailed
from Moscow.
Dr. Handley's experience in
1961 has been followed by the
parents of about 600 other
Stanford students overseas.
During the past ten years, more
than 20 trips to the Soviet Union

and Eastern Europe have been
organized at the five overseas
campuses.
No Direct Connection
The Overseas Campus Office
has no direct connection with the
Russia trips, but visa information,
travel agency bookings, and
discussions with people who have
been past participants in the
programs are available at the
various campuses.
"Not every overseas group
organizes a trip to the Soviet
Union," Handley said, "the trip
varies as the interest of the groups
varies." For the past ten years the
"interest of the groups" in the
Russian excursion has remained
high. The trip is the most popular
singular activity for three-week
break at the Italian campus.
The trip usually attracts
between twenty and thirty
students from the campuses that
have breaks which coincide. The
trip lasts about four weeks and is
organized in December, March,
June, and September through an
Italian or Austrian tourist agency.
The itinerary for the trip has
remained relatively constant in
the past years. Warsaw, Prague,
Berlin, Budapest, Bucharest,
Leningrad, Moscow and Kiev are
usually visited. Tensions behind
the Iron Curtain have more than
once affected the trips.
In the early sixties, Berlin was
left out of the itinerary as the
world accustomed itself to
looking at the Soviet sector of
Berlin over the top of a wall.
Five Days in Prague
In 1968, a Stanford tour spent
five care-free days exploring
Prague. June, another group
stayed in Prague less than
twenty-four hours, carefully
guided away from bullet-riddled
Wenceslaus Square.
Student impressions of the trip

change drasticly with the seasons.
Marion Brewer remembers "the
surreal image of Leningrad on
Christmas Eve with amber lights
twinkling in the perfect icecicles
hanging on every snow-covered
tree."
Anne Richardson recalls the
"fat Russians lying along the
Black Sea in swimming suits
drinking beer." "They were all
health crazy," she laughed, "and
in the afternoon they'd pile into a
bus and head for some
foul-smelling sulphur springs to
broil themselves."
With the winter paradise and
the soft summer sun came bits of
drugerous work. Women waiting
in sub-zero weather to buy four
frozen tomatoes at the open
market. Women bent over in the
eerie light of the midnight sun
sweeping Red Square by hand.
Effort To Understand
To many, the trip is an effort
to understand the "other side".
Jeff Leep commented on why he
went on the trip saying, "Now I
can go home and convince my dad
that the commies aren't coming to
get him." Steve Seay more
candidly talked of the influence of
the trip on his parents, "I just
wanted to freak out old Charlie
and Sadie."
Parents aren't the only ones
freaked by the trip. Expectations
of a Utopian socialist state aren't
borne out in the reality of Soviet
life. Marie Stanislaw admitted,
"All the people WERE
somber-looking and dressed in
gray." While not a Utopia, the
scene is foreign to the western
tastes and experiences.
"Oh," wailed Jeff Leep, I'd
pay ten rubles for a Coke!" He
could have too since the black
market exchange rate was about
five times the official value of the
Russian dollar. On the same black
market, a button-down collared

shirt would bring twenty-five
rubles.
The one scene that survives in
the minds of those who have seen
Russia is the line of people
waiting to enter Lenin's tomb in
Red Wquare. Backed up more
than a mile every day of the year,
men, women, and children wait
silently for a chance to walk
slowly by the illuminated body of
Lenin. The chills felt by a
foreigner are perhaps the result of
the air-conditioning in the tomb,
but as Marie Stanislaw put it,
"The revolution live all around
them" and Lenin is perhaps as
alive today as he was in 1917.
Whatever the image that
remains of the Soviet Union for
those Stanford students who have
made the trip, perhaps Fedor
Tiutchev best describes the feeling
of the "white nights" of
Leningrad when he wrote in 1855 ,
"Homeland of patience, land of
the Russian people, like first love,
the heart of Russia will not forget
you."
