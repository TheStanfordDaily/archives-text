# Freshmen Must Take SLAT Today
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
How much have you really
gotten into life at Stanford? Have
you ever asked yourself that
question? Probably not, as classes
are wasting enough of your time.
But be that as it isn't, a
Stanford professor has now
devised a test to see how much
the average Stanford freshman has
become acculturated to life at
Stanford. The test is the SLAT
test, or Stanford Lingo
Achievement Test, invented by
Prof. Cy Kopath of the
psychology department.
The test is a multiple choice
and the definitions of words
commonly used at Stanford are
asked. Prof. Kopath has been so

kind as to let the Daily print the
test in order that any reader can
see how much he's into or out of
life at Stanford. Well, let's get

The correct answer to all

questions was b except for
question No. 3 where the answer
was d.
8 correct- You're a big red rooter.
3 to 7 - mediocre.
1 to 2 correct—You are currently
enrolled at SC.
How much have you really
gotten into life at Stanford? Have
you ever asked yourself that
question? Probably not, as classes
are wasting enough of your time.
But be that as it isn't, a
Stanford professor has now
devised a test to see how much
the average Stanford freshman has
become acculturated to life at
Stanford. The test is the SLAT
test, or Stanford Lingo
Achievement Test, invented by
Prof. Cy Kopath of the
psychology department.
The test is a multiple choice
and the definitions of words
commonly used at Stanford are
asked. Prof. Kopath has been so

kind as to let the Daily print the
test in order that any reader can
see how much he's into or out of
life at Stanford. Well, let's get
started.
