# Pill Could Be Made Safer If Dosage Were Decreased

Lowering dosage of the pill may significantly
increase its safety.
A British study earlier this year showed that
low estrogen pills cut deaths by a half, and blood
clotting by a quarter. Three times as many women
died from blood clotting by using pills containing
75 or more micrograms as died using only 50
micrograms.
Approximately the same dosages are now
prescribed for all women. Dr. Sumner M. Kalman,
professor of pharmacology at Stanford's School of
Medicine, thinks dosages should be individually
prescribed, depending on a woman's individual
needs.
Individual Differences
Dr. Kalman said, "Individuals ranging widely in
the ability to metabolize and excrete a given drug.
In extreme cases, one woman will probably have as
much as 10 times the concentration of the drug in
her body as her neighbor, though both get the
same dosage schedule. We know this to be true for
every drug and for every hormone for which we
have adequate date. Why should we put all persons
on the same dosage schedule?"
Presently, the pill dosage prevents ovulation in
all women,which in turn prevents conception. Dr.
Kalman said, "It should not be necessary for a
woman to get a dose that will block ovulation in
any member of her species."
With a lower dosage, pregnancy and abortions
will probably increase. Dr. Kalman said, "If the
process of finding the correct dose for a given
patient places her at risk for a time, we should
share that risk. We could do this if we and the

patient were willing to terminate an unwanted
pregnancy. Abolition of laws relating to abortion
would make our dosage scheduling of orally-active
contraceptives more rational."
New Abortion Plans
Professor Paul R. Erlich, biological science
professor and author of The Population Bomb,
agrees with Dr. Kalman on the need for revised
abortion laws. He said, "As with any other drugs,
there are certain risks associated with birth control
pills, and these risks have to be carefully balanced
against the very real benefits of using the pill,
which include avoiding the risks associated with
pregnancy and childbearing.
If subsidized voluntary abortion was available
to all women," he continued. "We could have a
much safer pill because we could accept a slightly
higher risk of accidental pregnancy. Therefore,
people like Ronald Reagan, who oppose humane
abortion laws, are putting pressure on American
women to take more dangerous contraceptive pills
than would otherwise be necessary. Obviously, no
woman should be taking the pill without being
under the supervision of her physician."
Liberalization of abortion laws would lower the
number of women's lives lost in operations, as
doctors would be more able to perform abortions.
Lowering the dosage of the pill appears to be a
necessary progressive step toward avoiding blood
clottingâ€”and the dosages must be individually
determined.
A lower dosage will predicate pregnancies,
which will demonstrate and need for new abortion
laws; otherwise, deaths lost by illegal abortions
and pregnancies will outweigh lives saved by a
lower dosage.
