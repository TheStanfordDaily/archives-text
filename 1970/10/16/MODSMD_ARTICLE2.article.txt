# Possibility of Bombings Causes Official Concern
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
University officials are worried over
the current wave of bombings across
the country, yet they find themselves
helpless in defending against the
attacks.
"I'm very worried. It's really an
impossible question," said John
Schwartz, special assistant to the
president for student disciplinary
affairs.
"I'm not so crazy to think that we
will definitely get through the year
without any threats," said Police Chief
Thomas Bell.
Aside from installing new smoke
detection devices and some burglar
alarm systems, campus officials feel
powerless to stop bomb attempts since
all that is necessary is one person who
can easily plant a charge during
daylight hours and leave unnoticed.

Schwartz revealed that many
University departments and offices
have kept duplicate records on
microfilm, computer tape, or regular
file in other locations for safe keeping.
The Center for International Affairs at
Harvard had followed the same
procedure before it was bombed early
in the morning on October 14.
Schwartz cited the dangers of
accidental fire as the chief motive for
the duplicate files when they were
initiated several years ago. However,
times have changed, he admitted, "and
it's prudent for a University that is so
open as we are to safeguard its
documents against the threat of fire."
Asked what targets seemed the most
likely, Bell replied, "You never really
know. Why did they get the Behaviorial
Sciences Center?" he asked in reference
to a firebombing last spring that
destroyed part of the hilltop research
Center for the Study of the Behaviorial
Sciences.
No Challenging Answers
"It's hard to answer some of those
things," Bell continued. "You have to
give the kind of answer that isn't a
challenge."
Schwartz said that the
administration has gone over with
police the best ways to evacuate
buildings, but even these plans are
tentative. "Our ideas are pretty general
since it all depends on the time of day,
the size of the area, and the occupancy
of the building," he explained.
Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig added, "There are no
precautions that you can take that will
prevent it." He suggested that "the best
protection that the University can have
is people willing to report any
information that they hear."
Few Specific Plans
The police can do little to foil a
bomb attempt in advance, and so the
department has come up with few
specific plans to deal with the problem.
"We don't take any extra precautions
unless there are direct threats," Bell
said.
In recent history there have been
five major arson attempts on campus.
During the winter and spring of 1968
the Navy ROTC building was
firebombed twice. The first attack
partially destroyed the structure, and
the second attempt, made while the

building was being rebuilt, burned
down the N ROTC headquarters
completely.
On July 5 , 1968 the president's
office was gutted by a fire believed set
by arsonists, and last May arsonists
burned part of the Behavioral Sciences
Center located in the hills behind Lake
Lagunita.
The Free Campus Movement
headquarters, the Free Market was
unsuccessfully firebombed last spring.
According to Schwartz, the Trustees
authorized the administration to spend
up to $200,000 above its present
security budget if necessary. Schwartz
said that none of the funds had been
spent yet, but that a number of plans
for more patrolmen were under
consideration.
Schwartz said that the president's
staff had discussed the threat of
bombing. "We're clearly concerned
enough to be talking about what we
can do. There's no rush or panic."

said that none of the funds had been
spent yet, but that a number of plans
for more patrolmen were under
consideration.
Schwartz said that the president's
staff had discussed the threat of
bombing. "We're clearly concerned
enough to be talking about what we
can do. There's no rush or panic."
University officials are worried over
the current wave of bombings across
the country, yet they find themselves
helpless in defending against the
attacks.
"I'm very worried. It's really an
impossible question," said John
Schwartz, special assistant to the
president for student disciplinary
affairs.
"I'm not so crazy to think that we
will definitely get through the year
without any threats," said Police Chief
Thomas Bell.
Aside from installing new smoke
detection devices and some burglar
alarm systems, campus officials feel
powerless to stop bomb attempts since
all that is necessary is one person who
can easily plant a charge during
daylight hours and leave unnoticed.

Schwartz revealed that many
University departments and offices
have kept duplicate records on
microfilm, computer tape, or regular
file in other locations for safe keeping.
The Center for International Affairs at
Harvard had followed the same
procedure before it was bombed early
in the morning on October 14.
Schwartz cited the dangers of
accidental fire as the chief motive for
the duplicate files when they were
initiated several years ago. However,
times have changed, he admitted, "and
it's prudent for a University that is so
open as we are to safeguard its
documents against the threat of fire."
Asked what targets seemed the most
likely, Bell replied, "You never really
know. Why did they get the Behaviorial
Sciences Center?" he asked in reference
to a firebombing last spring that
destroyed part of the hilltop research
Center for the Study of the Behaviorial
Sciences.
No Challenging Answers
"It's hard to answer some of those
things," Bell continued. "You have to
give the kind of answer that isn't a
challenge."
Schwartz said that the
administration has gone over with
police the best ways to evacuate
buildings, but even these plans are
tentative. "Our ideas are pretty general
since it all depends on the time of day,
the size of the area, and the occupancy
of the building," he explained.
Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig added, "There are no
precautions that you can take that will
prevent it." He suggested that "the best
protection that the University can have
is people willing to report any
information that they hear."
Few Specific Plans
The police can do little to foil a
bomb attempt in advance, and so the
department has come up with few
specific plans to deal with the problem.
"We don't take any extra precautions
unless there are direct threats," Bell
said.
In recent history there have been
five major arson attempts on campus.
During the winter and spring of 1968
the Navy ROTC building was
firebombed twice. The first attack
partially destroyed the structure, and
the second attempt, made while the

building was being rebuilt, burned
down the N ROTC headquarters
completely.
On July 5 , 1968 the president's
office was gutted by a fire believed set
by arsonists, and last May arsonists
burned part of the Behavioral Sciences
Center located in the hills behind Lake
Lagunita.
The Free Campus Movement
headquarters, the Free Market was
unsuccessfully firebombed last spring.
According to Schwartz, the Trustees
authorized the administration to spend
up to $200,000 above its present
security budget if necessary. Schwartz
said that none of the funds had been
spent yet, but that a number of plans
for more patrolmen were under
consideration.
