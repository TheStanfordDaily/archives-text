# A 						Black Experience: Ballets Africains
## 
### AGUIBOU YAN YANSANE 
To justify the enslavement of
Africans in the Western
Hemisphere, as well as the foreign
domination of Africans on their
continent, the spurious and
grossly unscientific concept of
inferiority of Africans (and all
those whose roots could be traced
to Africa) vis-a-vis people of
European stock appeared on the
scene of human relation, defended
by the colonialists and racists.
Thus, skin color was made the

scapegoat of what in fact is
cultural, economic, political
exploitation.
It is to show the weaknesses of
these myths about Africa that the
"Ballets Africains, Ensemble
artistique et culturel de la
Republique de Guinee" has been
constituted since 1947 to be the
authentic messengers of African
culture, to interpret and to
disseminate the African
folklore—first drawings of any
group character.

The "Ballets Africains,"
despite its misleading name is not
a ballet in the classical sense; the
program is not at all an academic
display of boring and faded
combinations, but rather one of
the world's most exciting and
fascinating rythmic
entertainments whose vitality fills
the stage and overwhelms the
audience.
They are made up of forty-five
young, vibrant, very handsome
men and women who have been
selected from the ninety-six
regional dance groups, sponsored
by the Guinean ministry of youth,
culture and arts. Each one of
them is a full-fledged artist - singer
- dancer. Each artist is a success
by himself.
They use mostly all African
instruments but also the European
guitar. Their stories are usually
commentaries on present day
situations and problems, historic
reminiscences, tales of evil and
spirit, circumstances of seductive
romances, etc.
They sing songs of old and
modern Africa. They write and
perform plays aimed at
interpreting precolonial Africa,
colonial history pointing out the
exploitive and destructive aspects
of European penetration,
conquest and settlement, while at
the same time glorifying the
resistence of African leaders.
Sundiata is one illustrating
example of their endeavor, that is
why it was the most highly
applauded play at the Pan-African
Festival of Algiers in 1969.
The 2.50 hour program is
divided in two parts separated by
an intermission: the first part
includes the opening, "Sundiata,"
"M'Balia Camara," and Tiranke;
the second part includes the
initiation ceremonies, "Koma",
night of Cora and finale.
'The Lion King'
The "Ballet Africains" stage
adaptation of Sundiata shows the
audience the misery of a crippled

son born to rule, the misery of his
followers, his mother Sogolon
Kedju, his half brother and
intimate friend Mande Bory, his
sisters Djamaru and Koloukon, his
talented griot Balla Fasseke
Kuyate, the misery due to an
arrogant and unnecessary
ostentation of the court in light of
the oppression of peoples of
Kankaba. Sundiata is seen making
superhuman efforts to use his legs,
and recover from his paralysis,
and the miracle occurs while
courtisans are rejoicing under the
resentful look of the jealous ruling
half-brother.
The "Ballets Africains"
interpretation of M'Balia starts
with a scene of forced labor
"requested" by the French
colonial rulers market demand for
raw-materials during the
Franco-Prussian and the two
World Wars. The scene shows the
brutalities and various abuses
perpetrated on the peasants by
the African middleman, the
kaki-dressed colonial guards and
policemen, and the ambitious
courtier of the chiefs. These
middlemen are real equivalent of
the slave overseers in the New
World.
M'Balia is performed in a series
of songs expressing people's
indignation, their strong will and
faith in continuing the struggle to
free themselves from colonialism
and also to reaffirm their
determination to unite in memory
of the brave and intrepid country
lady who fell for them.
It is noticeable that the
transition between Sundiata and
M'Balia is not a very distinct one.
Sundiata presents West African
history at the apex of its glory;
M'Balia is one interpretation of
the conflict resulting in the
meeting of Africans and
Europeans at the advent of
colonialism. Though the
succession of "Sundiata" and
"M'Balia" in order to project the
historic evolution of Sub-Saharan
West Africa is a judicious and

excellent device, it is perhaps
opportune to make a clear
demarcation for an uninformed
audience like the American public
on Africa's history. The African
"balanyis" or balafon or
xylophone like instruments very
well admired of the international
scene are not seen, but are heard
in the background. Perhaps they
should by carried on the stage?
Despite these few remarks,
M'Balia is a worthwhile play
about Africa's cultural and
political reconversion. It is also an
interesting piece of black
experience.
Rite Of Initiation
The whole ceremony of
initiation in "Koma" which used
to take place in Rio Nunez by
Boke in Guinee is presided over
by a chief, a very agile and supple
magician assisted by two big-time
buck deputies. The whole scene
displays strength and robustness
where Africa energy is seen at
work. Despite its seemingly brutal
allure, it is art, there is no wrong
or miscalculated gesture. For the
uninformed audience, the troupe
seems at this point to be
intoxicated, which they are, but
on ritual, on cadence, on rythm,
on time, on dance, on life. It is at
this point that the dancers carry
the audience beyond this poor
writer's ability to describe.
The "Ballets Africains" 197 0
performance is what we qualify in
Guinee as "Akamalikhi" or in
today's equivalent, "it is
together." The whole show might
cure either temporarily or for
good, many of us who are indeed
intellectually and spiritually drop
outs. A first class production!
Nothing like the performances of
the previous years! Although their
language is foreign, their emotions
are universal.
(The Ballets Africains will be
appearing on October 22 at the
Berkeley Community Theater and
on October 23, 24, and 25 at the
Masonic Auditorium.)

To justify the enslavement of
Africans in the Western
Hemisphere, as well as the foreign
domination of Africans on their
continent, the spurious and
grossly unscientific concept of
inferiority of Africans (and all
those whose roots could be traced
to Africa) vis-a-vis people of
European stock appeared on the
scene of human relation, defended
by the colonialists and racists.
Thus, skin color was made the

scapegoat of what in fact is
cultural, economic, political
exploitation.
It is to show the weaknesses of
these myths about Africa that the
"Ballets Africains, Ensemble
artistique et culturel de la
Republique de Guinee" has been
constituted since 1947 to be the
authentic messengers of African
culture, to interpret and to
disseminate the African
folklore—first drawings of any
group character.

The "Ballets Africains,"
despite its misleading name is not
a ballet in the classical sense; the
program is not at all an academic
display of boring and faded
combinations, but rather one of
the world's most exciting and
fascinating rythmic
entertainments whose vitality fills
the stage and overwhelms the
audience.
They are made up of forty-five
young, vibrant, very handsome
men and women who have been
selected from the ninety-six
regional dance groups, sponsored
by the Guinean ministry of youth,
culture and arts. Each one of
them is a full-fledged artist - singer
- dancer. Each artist is a success
by himself.
They use mostly all African
instruments but also the European
guitar. Their stories are usually
commentaries on present day
situations and problems, historic
reminiscences, tales of evil and
spirit, circumstances of seductive
romances, etc.
They sing songs of old and
modern Africa. They write and
perform plays aimed at
interpreting precolonial Africa,
colonial history pointing out the
exploitive and destructive aspects
of European penetration,
conquest and settlement, while at
the same time glorifying the
resistence of African leaders.
Sundiata is one illustrating
example of their endeavor, that is
why it was the most highly
applauded play at the Pan-African
Festival of Algiers in 1969.
The 2.50 hour program is
divided in two parts separated by
an intermission: the first part
includes the opening, "Sundiata,"
"M'Balia Camara," and Tiranke;
the second part includes the
initiation ceremonies, "Koma",
night of Cora and finale.
'The Lion King'
The "Ballet Africains" stage
adaptation of Sundiata shows the
audience the misery of a crippled

son born to rule, the misery of his
followers, his mother Sogolon
Kedju, his half brother and
intimate friend Mande Bory, his
sisters Djamaru and Koloukon, his
talented griot Balla Fasseke
Kuyate, the misery due to an
arrogant and unnecessary
ostentation of the court in light of
the oppression of peoples of
Kankaba. Sundiata is seen making
superhuman efforts to use his legs,
and recover from his paralysis,
and the miracle occurs while
courtisans are rejoicing under the
resentful look of the jealous ruling
half-brother.
The "Ballets Africains"
interpretation of M'Balia starts
with a scene of forced labor
"requested" by the French
colonial rulers market demand for
raw-materials during the
Franco-Prussian and the two
World Wars. The scene shows the
brutalities and various abuses
perpetrated on the peasants by
the African middleman, the
kaki-dressed colonial guards and
policemen, and the ambitious
courtier of the chiefs. These
middlemen are real equivalent of
the slave overseers in the New
World.
M'Balia is performed in a series
of songs expressing people's
indignation, their strong will and
faith in continuing the struggle to
free themselves from colonialism
and also to reaffirm their
determination to unite in memory
of the brave and intrepid country
lady who fell for them.
It is noticeable that the
transition between Sundiata and
M'Balia is not a very distinct one.
Sundiata presents West African
history at the apex of its glory;
M'Balia is one interpretation of
the conflict resulting in the
meeting of Africans and
Europeans at the advent of
colonialism. Though the
succession of "Sundiata" and
"M'Balia" in order to project the
historic evolution of Sub-Saharan
West Africa is a judicious and

excellent device, it is perhaps
opportune to make a clear
demarcation for an uninformed
audience like the American public
on Africa's history. The African
"balanyis" or balafon or
xylophone like instruments very
well admired of the international
scene are not seen, but are heard
in the background. Perhaps they
should by carried on the stage?
Despite these few remarks,
M'Balia is a worthwhile play
about Africa's cultural and
political reconversion. It is also an
interesting piece of black
experience.
Rite Of Initiation
The whole ceremony of
initiation in "Koma" which used
to take place in Rio Nunez by
Boke in Guinee is presided over
by a chief, a very agile and supple
magician assisted by two big-time
buck deputies. The whole scene
displays strength and robustness
where Africa energy is seen at
work. Despite its seemingly brutal
allure, it is art, there is no wrong
or miscalculated gesture. For the
uninformed audience, the troupe
seems at this point to be
intoxicated, which they are, but
on ritual, on cadence, on rythm,
on time, on dance, on life. It is at
this point that the dancers carry
the audience beyond this poor
writer's ability to describe.
The "Ballets Africains" 197 0
performance is what we qualify in
Guinee as "Akamalikhi" or in
today's equivalent, "it is
together." The whole show might
cure either temporarily or for
good, many of us who are indeed
intellectually and spiritually drop
outs. A first class production!
Nothing like the performances of
the previous years! Although their
language is foreign, their emotions
are universal.
(The Ballets Africains will be
appearing on October 22 at the
Berkeley Community Theater and
on October 23, 24, and 25 at the
Masonic Auditorium.)

To justify the enslavement of
Africans in the Western
Hemisphere, as well as the foreign
domination of Africans on their
continent, the spurious and
grossly unscientific concept of
inferiority of Africans (and all
those whose roots could be traced
to Africa) vis-a-vis people of
European stock appeared on the
scene of human relation, defended
by the colonialists and racists.
Thus, skin color was made the

scapegoat of what in fact is
cultural, economic, political
exploitation.
It is to show the weaknesses of
these myths about Africa that the
"Ballets Africains, Ensemble
artistique et culturel de la
Republique de Guinee" has been
constituted since 1947 to be the
authentic messengers of African
culture, to interpret and to
disseminate the African
folklore—first drawings of any
group character.

The "Ballets Africains,"
despite its misleading name is not
a ballet in the classical sense; the
program is not at all an academic
display of boring and faded
combinations, but rather one of
the world's most exciting and
fascinating rythmic
entertainments whose vitality fills
the stage and overwhelms the
audience.
They are made up of forty-five
young, vibrant, very handsome
men and women who have been
selected from the ninety-six
regional dance groups, sponsored
by the Guinean ministry of youth,
culture and arts. Each one of
them is a full-fledged artist - singer
- dancer. Each artist is a success
by himself.
They use mostly all African
instruments but also the European
guitar. Their stories are usually
commentaries on present day
situations and problems, historic
reminiscences, tales of evil and
spirit, circumstances of seductive
romances, etc.
They sing songs of old and
modern Africa. They write and
perform plays aimed at
interpreting precolonial Africa,
colonial history pointing out the
exploitive and destructive aspects
of European penetration,
conquest and settlement, while at
the same time glorifying the
resistence of African leaders.
Sundiata is one illustrating
example of their endeavor, that is
why it was the most highly
applauded play at the Pan-African
Festival of Algiers in 1969.
The 2.50 hour program is
divided in two parts separated by
an intermission: the first part
includes the opening, "Sundiata,"
"M'Balia Camara," and Tiranke;
the second part includes the
initiation ceremonies, "Koma",
night of Cora and finale.
'The Lion King'
The "Ballet Africains" stage
adaptation of Sundiata shows the
audience the misery of a crippled

son born to rule, the misery of his
followers, his mother Sogolon
Kedju, his half brother and
intimate friend Mande Bory, his
sisters Djamaru and Koloukon, his
talented griot Balla Fasseke
Kuyate, the misery due to an
arrogant and unnecessary
ostentation of the court in light of
the oppression of peoples of
Kankaba. Sundiata is seen making
superhuman efforts to use his legs,
and recover from his paralysis,
and the miracle occurs while
courtisans are rejoicing under the
resentful look of the jealous ruling
half-brother.
The "Ballets Africains"
interpretation of M'Balia starts
with a scene of forced labor
"requested" by the French
colonial rulers market demand for
raw-materials during the
Franco-Prussian and the two
World Wars. The scene shows the
brutalities and various abuses
perpetrated on the peasants by
the African middleman, the
kaki-dressed colonial guards and
policemen, and the ambitious
courtier of the chiefs. These
middlemen are real equivalent of
the slave overseers in the New
World.
M'Balia is performed in a series
of songs expressing people's
indignation, their strong will and
faith in continuing the struggle to
free themselves from colonialism
and also to reaffirm their
determination to unite in memory
of the brave and intrepid country
lady who fell for them.
It is noticeable that the
transition between Sundiata and
M'Balia is not a very distinct one.
Sundiata presents West African
history at the apex of its glory;
M'Balia is one interpretation of
the conflict resulting in the
meeting of Africans and
Europeans at the advent of
colonialism. Though the
succession of "Sundiata" and
"M'Balia" in order to project the
historic evolution of Sub-Saharan
West Africa is a judicious and

excellent device, it is perhaps
opportune to make a clear
demarcation for an uninformed
audience like the American public
on Africa's history. The African
"balanyis" or balafon or
xylophone like instruments very
well admired of the international
scene are not seen, but are heard
in the background. Perhaps they
should by carried on the stage?
Despite these few remarks,
M'Balia is a worthwhile play
about Africa's cultural and
political reconversion. It is also an
interesting piece of black
experience.
Rite Of Initiation
The whole ceremony of
initiation in "Koma" which used
to take place in Rio Nunez by
Boke in Guinee is presided over
by a chief, a very agile and supple
magician assisted by two big-time
buck deputies. The whole scene
displays strength and robustness
where Africa energy is seen at
work. Despite its seemingly brutal
allure, it is art, there is no wrong
or miscalculated gesture. For the
uninformed audience, the troupe
seems at this point to be
intoxicated, which they are, but
on ritual, on cadence, on rythm,
on time, on dance, on life. It is at
this point that the dancers carry
the audience beyond this poor
writer's ability to describe.
The "Ballets Africains" 197 0
performance is what we qualify in
Guinee as "Akamalikhi" or in
today's equivalent, "it is
together." The whole show might
cure either temporarily or for
good, many of us who are indeed
intellectually and spiritually drop
outs. A first class production!
Nothing like the performances of
the previous years! Although their
language is foreign, their emotions
are universal.
(The Ballets Africains will be
appearing on October 22 at the
Berkeley Community Theater and
on October 23, 24, and 25 at the
Masonic Auditorium.)
