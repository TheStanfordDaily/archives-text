# "flavors" for Poetry Palate
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL Flavors by Mason Williams $2.95 , Doubleday Company, Inc 
Flavors need not come in the
form of ice cream cones and
chicken soup. Words are flavors,
places are flavors, people are
flavors, and emotions are flavors.

A person is made up of a
combination of many flavors
which season him and mold his
personality. This being the case,
each of us can be summarized in a
sort of cookbook.

Mason Williams, probably best
known for his work with the

Smothers Brothers as writer and
performer and as composer of
Classical Gas, has put together a
volume of poetry, photographs,
drawings, games, and prose which
capture some important flavors of
the author's personality. What has
evolved is a book that is
entertaining and great fun to read
j along with a masterful portrait of
the artist.
The poetry is penned with an
extremely light touch, a mood
which pervades the entire
collection of prose and poetry.
Though the diction of the various
poems is not sophisticated, the
ideas occasionally do get into
some "heavy" themes like God
and love. The majority of the
poems however flow in a lighter
vein and deal with such
earthshaking topics as "Them
Beaver Cleavers," "Them Sticker
Gitters," "The Prince's Panties,"
or "The Tomato Vendetta." A
few of the poems are actually
lyrics from songs Williams has
composed; Smothers Brothers
fans may find some familiar.
Experiences in the service and
other memories from childhood
to the present are recounted in a
long section of the anthology
simply titled "Autobiography."
This is the longest prose section of
the book and in it Williams
literally drives the reader through
his life using the cars he has
owned to unify various events and
paint canvases of his emotions at
various points.
Little more can be said about
Williams' book since the only way
to appreciate something as
subjective as poetry is to read it.
To get a true taste of the flavors
which make up the man, one must
read the book, but perhaps one of
the poems summarizes the overall
Mason Williams flavor extremely
well. The last stanza of "City,"
reads:
"Cities go
From one
To minus zero
They're put together well
Exactly wrong
Just like
Their throng."

evolved is a book that is
entertaining and great fun to read
j along with a masterful portrait of
the artist.
The poetry is penned with an
extremely light touch, a mood
which pervades the entire
collection of prose and poetry.
Though the diction of the various
poems is not sophisticated, the
ideas occasionally do get into
some "heavy" themes like God
and love. The majority of the
poems however flow in a lighter
vein and deal with such
earthshaking topics as "Them
Beaver Cleavers," "Them Sticker
Gitters," "The Prince's Panties,"
or "The Tomato Vendetta." A
few of the poems are actually
lyrics from songs Williams has
composed; Smothers Brothers
fans may find some familiar.
Experiences in the service and
other memories from childhood
to the present are recounted in a
long section of the anthology
simply titled "Autobiography."
This is the longest prose section of
the book and in it Williams
literally drives the reader through
his life using the cars he has
owned to unify various events and
paint canvases of his emotions at
various points.
Little more can be said about
Williams' book since the only way
to appreciate something as
subjective as poetry is to read it.
To get a true taste of the flavors
which make up the man, one must
read the book, but perhaps one of
the poems summarizes the overall
Mason Williams flavor extremely
well. The last stanza of "City,"
reads:
"Cities go
From one
To minus zero
They're put together well
Exactly wrong
Just like
Their throng."
