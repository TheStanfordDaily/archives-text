# At Home: Poloists, Harriers
## Poloists Face Past Champs 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
Stanford's water polo teain
takes on last year's national
champions at 3 p.m. at Encina
pool.
Coach Jim Gaughran is
anticipating a good season for the
Cards this year, but the four-team
Rac-8 includes 1969's national
champs, UCLA, and last year's
runners up, Berkeley.
Gaughran says his team is
"developing" and points out it has
already upset Berkeley; four and
sometimes five of his starters are
juniors.
Stanford has three strong
candidates for All-America honors
this year, Rich Massimino, Bill
Simpkinsand Peter Gadd.
Massimino leads the team in
scoring, Simpkins excells as a
playmaker and as a defenseman,
and goalie Gadd so far has been
one of Stanford's main keys to
early success.
The Indians are trying several
new tactics this season, including
a fast break and a three-to-four
man defense in Stanford's small
pool.
The aim of the fast break is to
give Card attackers a temporary
man advantage when they can get
it and the new defense gives some
of the players a chance to stay
back and rest a bit.
Stanford's only real weakness,
according to Gaughran, is lack of
experience. Most Card water
poloists play only during the fall,
while their adversaries at USC,

UCLA and Berkeley play AAU
summer water polo. Massimino,
Gad and Simkins were the only
Indians who played last summer.
Water polo fans and initiates
interested in the action and
passing of soccer and the control
and finesse of basketball will have

one of their better opportunities
of the season this afternoon at 3
p.m. when Stanford battles the
Bruins.
Saturday at 10 a.m. the Tribe
hosts De Anza Junior College in
Encina pool.


ENCOURAGEMENT:Stanford water polo coach Jim Gaughran gave
last moment inspiration to his swimmers last week who went on to
upset Berkeley 9-S. Today UCLA paddles into Encina Pool and it
figures to take everything Gaughran and his polo players can offer to
bump off the powerful Bruins, defending NCAA water polo
champions. The match gets underway at 3 p.m., and Stanfordians can
take in all the action for a mere 50 cents.
