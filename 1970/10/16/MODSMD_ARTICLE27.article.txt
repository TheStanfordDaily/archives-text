# Only Local Show For Card Runners

### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Coach Marshall Clark's varsity
cross country team will host USC
and San Jose State tomorrow at
10 a.m. in Stanford's only home
appearance of the season.
The three squads will compete
on a six mile layout that will
wander over the Stanford Golf
Course. The Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
of national fame will be present
tomorrow to support Stanford's
runners.
The bandsmen plan to
continue their relentless assault on
USC by rendering their double
time version of the William Tell
Overture as the weary harriers
head down the home stretch.
Heavy Toll
Sacramento's Invitational Meet
inflected a heavy physical beeting
on the Cards, and Clark is concern
ed with the fact that his men are
suffering from sore muscles and
tendons. Stanford is definitely not
in top shape for the meet, but
USC has also been bothered by
injuries.
The Stanford meet will be the
first competition for the USC
9quad this season. The Trojan's
top runner, Fred Ritcherson, has
been injured and is a doubtful
starter.
Ritcherson, an All-American as
a sophomore, won a four way
meet involving the Indians last

year and has always been a threat
in Pac-8 competition. His
abscence from tomorrow's race
would improve the Card's chances
considerably.
Coach Clark expects the race
to be extremely close. "None of
the three teams has good depth,
and the race could be decided by
the top few individual runners on
each squad. Bob Coe and Don
Kardong are healthy and 1 think
that we pose a serious threat to
USC."
San Jose State has a few strong
runners led by Gary Hansen, but
the team as a whole should not
seriously challenge USC and
Stanford for the team
championship.
Watch The Top
In the past, Stanford has ceded
the top positions to USC and won
the meets with outstanding depth.
Clark asserts that this must not be
the case this year if the Indians
are to win. "Last year USC took
the first and third positions and
we still beat them. If they place
one-two on us tomorrow we will
not be able to take the meet."
Clark is optimistic, however,
that his top runners (Kardong,
Coe, Arvid Kretz, and Bernie
Lahde) will be able to place high
enough to win the meet and make
up for Stanford's lack of depth.
The race will begin by the
stables on the golf course
tomorrow at ten.

the meets with outstanding depth.
Clark asserts that this must not be
the case this year if the Indians
are to win. "Last year USC took
the first and third positions and
we still beat them. If they place
one-two on us tomorrow we will
not be able to take the meet."
Clark is optimistic, however,
that his top runners (Kardong,
Coe, Arvid Kretz, and Bernie
Lahde) will be able to place high
enough to win the meet and make
up for Stanford's lack of depth.
The race will begin by the
stables on the golf course
tomorrow at ten.
Coach Marshall Clark's varsity
cross country team will host USC
and San Jose State tomorrow at
10 a.m. in Stanford's only home
appearance of the season.
The three squads will compete
on a six mile layout that will
wander over the Stanford Golf
Course. The Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
of national fame will be present
tomorrow to support Stanford's
runners.
The bandsmen plan to
continue their relentless assault on
USC by rendering their double
time version of the William Tell
Overture as the weary harriers
head down the home stretch.
Heavy Toll
Sacramento's Invitational Meet
inflected a heavy physical beeting
on the Cards, and Clark is concern
ed with the fact that his men are
suffering from sore muscles and
tendons. Stanford is definitely not
in top shape for the meet, but
USC has also been bothered by
injuries.
The Stanford meet will be the
first competition for the USC
9quad this season. The Trojan's
top runner, Fred Ritcherson, has
been injured and is a doubtful
starter.
Ritcherson, an All-American as
a sophomore, won a four way
meet involving the Indians last

year and has always been a threat
in Pac-8 competition. His
abscence from tomorrow's race
would improve the Card's chances
considerably.
Coach Clark expects the race
to be extremely close. "None of
the three teams has good depth,
and the race could be decided by
the top few individual runners on
each squad. Bob Coe and Don
Kardong are healthy and 1 think
that we pose a serious threat to
USC."
San Jose State has a few strong
runners led by Gary Hansen, but
the team as a whole should not
seriously challenge USC and
Stanford for the team
championship.
Watch The Top
In the past, Stanford has ceded
the top positions to USC and won
the meets with outstanding depth.
Clark asserts that this must not be
the case this year if the Indians
are to win. "Last year USC took
the first and third positions and
we still beat them. If they place
one-two on us tomorrow we will
not be able to take the meet."
