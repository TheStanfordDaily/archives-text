# And On The Road...
## Stanford Confronts Palouse, WSU 
### FRED LEESON 
In a Stanford dressing room
four years ago, then-head coach
Bert Clark of Washington State hit
the low point of his worst season
and said, "Who wants to go to
Pullman, Washington?"
Apparently Mr. Clark didn't
think many football players
wanted to.
And maybe with Stanford's
past performances on the Palouse
(winless there since the John
Brodie days of 1 956) some local
players aren't to keyed to go to
either, even though this time it's
Spokane—"Lilac City."
Bert Clark wasn't around long
after his remark about Pullman,
and thus Stanford meets a
Washington State in Transition
tomorrow as it hopes to up its
Pac-8 record to 3 -0.
The Indians are 20 point
favorites to do so. They beat the
Cougars 49-0 here last season.
But then there's Jim Sweeney
to think about, a confirmed
optimist who took over at
Pullman three years ago, convinced
that he could attract good talent

just from Washington and
Montana if he had too.
His success hasn't been
immediate as it was in his earlier
coaching days in Kalispell and
Bozeman,Mont., as a 1-4 record so
far indicates.
But he's had some unexpected
problems.
Last spring, for example,
arsonists burned down the stands
at his ballyard, which explains
why tomorrow's game will be
played in Spokane's Joe Albi
Stadium (capacity: 36,000)
instead of at Pullman.
And he found quickly that the
Pac-8 is a rougher conference than
the Big Sky where he did so well
with Montana State.
But he's still building and now
in his third year has put together
half a ball club. He still needs a
defense.
Sweeney's Cougars are second
only to USC in total offense in
the Pac-8, a fact which has been a
weekly surprise to statistics
watchers.
The Cougars have been
averaging 429 yards a game, well

balanced between passing and
rushing.
Trouble is, they're last in team
defense, giving up 450 yards per
game.
Eunningbacks Bernard Jackson
and Bob Ewen pace WSU's ground
game with 425 and 397 yards
respectively through five games.
Quarterback Ty Paine likes to
throw the ball, too, and has
completed 58 passes for 88 3 yards
to keep opponents from keying
on the running game.
He has also thrown 12
interceptions in five games which
have tended to hurt now and then.
The Cougars' other big scoring
threat is kicker Don Sweet who
has hit 7-11 field goals and is a
threat from the 40 in.

Stanford, meanwhile, which
has been averaging 4 20 yards
offensively per game—just nine
behind the Cougars-is eagerly
awaiting that WSU defense,
hoping to find the same holes
Kansas, Michigan State, Oregon
and Arizona State did.
Mike Ewing has also been listed
as a doubtful Indian starter after
he pulled a hamstring muscle
again in practice Tuesday, and
Jack Lasater might not see action
either, if you figure that Coach
John Ralston will be trying to
have his club in top shape for
UCLA next week.
But then it's dangerous to
think that far ahead, as the Tribe
has learned once, and Ralston said

Saturday (in keeping with the
one-at-a-time theory) that WSU
was Stanford's next major
obstacle.
Meanwhile, Cal and UCLA and
USC and Washington. will be
facing each other with a strong
probability that a couple of them
are bound to lose, which in the
long run could help Stanford's
Rose Bowl hopes.
But in the longer run (if you
let your imagination wander)—like
another 20 years of ecological
disaster—we may be hearing four
California coaches crying, "Who
wants to come to California,
anyway 1 " while a greying Jim
Sweeney puts together his fifth
consecutive bowl team.
