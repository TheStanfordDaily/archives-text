# 'Daily Cal' May Fold
## Cal Newspaper Fears Censorship 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
The Daily Californian, student
newspaper of the University of
California at Berkeley, said in an
editorial this week that regents'
censorship may force it out of business.
The editorial followed an ultimatum
by the UC Board of Regents requiring
the University system's nine-student
newspapers to come up with
"acceptable" censorship guidelines by
January.
Bruce Koon, the Daily Cal's
editor-in-chief, accused the Regents of
wanting "nothing less than prior
censorship," and warned that any
attempt to enforce such censorship
would lead to the newspaper's death.
According to Koon, the only
alternative is to operate without
student body funds or campus
facilities, which would be impossible.
The Regents' order was in response
to the complaints of Regent John
Canaday of Los Angeles that the
newspapers were "instruments of
socio-political advocacy" and often
printed "lewd and obscene articles and
photographs." Canaday referred
specifically to the appearance in the
UCLA Daily Bruin of a photograph

depicting a seminude couple apparently
engaged in a sexual act in a cemetery.
In June 1970, Canaday drew up a
resolution that called for an end of all
student and university support of
newspapers. University administrators
called the resolution "premature," and
the regents established the January
deadline.
Both the Daily Bruin and the Daily
Cal have submitted proposed
guidelines. The UCLA guidelines, which
set up a "citizen review board" to
oversee the newspaper's quality,
banned publication of "legally
obscene" material, and called for
eventual financial independence for the
Bruin were approved by Chancellor
Charles E. Young on September 30.
The guidelines submitted by the
Daily Californian, which were
considerably less stringent and detailed,
were rejected on September 2 4 .
Koon said yesterday he has not
submitted a second set of guidelines.
"The Regents are not so much
interested in achieving a better quality
newspaper as much as asserting control
over the student press," Monday's
editorial charged. "With Regent
guidelines imposed, the Daily

Californian is no longer a student
newspaper."
"The Regents will decide for the
students what they should find
acceptable and what they should find
offensive .. . The present staff will not
work under a system of prior
censorship in any form."
Although reorganizing the Daily Cal
on an independent basis has been
seriously discussed for over three years,
Koon said that "the conditions of
independence have gotten all muddled
up. At this time, we could not survive
as an independent newspaper."
Independence would deprive the Daily
Cal of its subsidies, office space,
equipment, and the use of the name
Daily Californian, which is property of
the University.
What happens next, according to
Koon, depends on whether the Regents
"feel they've gotten enough mileage
out of it," or decide to press the issue
further. And, says Koon, if the Regents
are adamant in their demand for prior
censorship, the Daily Cal may seek
outside support. "If we have no
alternative," he added, "then it's an
issue we can rally people around."
