Crime Bill Signed
WASHINGTON — Pledging to win the war against
organized crime and anarchist terrorism, President
Nixon Thursday signed legislation giving federal
authorities strong tools against mobsters and bombers.
Flanked by Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell and FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover, Nixon deplored the recent
wave of bombings and said those responsible must be
brought to justice.
Even before the signing, opponents of certain
provisions in the measure said they would challenge the
bill in court.
Lawrence Speiser, national legislative director of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said his group feared
the bill's provisions would be used not against
organized crime but "against militant groups, Black
Panthers and others the administration considers as
dissident."
The bill makes participation in a fatal bombing a
capital offense, gives the FBI immediate jurisdiction in
campus bombings and allows agents to use electronic
surveillance in bombing investigations, with court
permission.
Tunney Leads Murphy
The latest California poll shows Democrat John V.
Tunney leading over Republican George Murphy's
attempt to win re-election to the U.S. Senate but
Murphy says he'll pull a repeat performance of his
1964 victory over Democrat Peirre Salinger.
Tunney's comment on his poll standing was, "I shall
win, but it won't be easy."
The poll showed Tunney with 46 percent of the
vote, Murphy with 4 4 percent, 6 percent undecided
and 2 percent favoring other candidates. The poll was
taken last week.
In other campaign developments yesterday;
—Gov. Reagan, campaigning for re-election, won a
standing ovation from a highway patrol audience after
,telling them they are the men who "hold back the

jungle." The Republican governor who cut a pay raise
for the patrol from 10 percent to 8 percent won an
even bigger ovation from the audience than his
Democratic rival, Jess Unruh, who supported the full
10 percent raise. Unruh addressed the same audience
earlier.
—Meanwhile, Unruh told newsmen Reagan's
administration had been "planless" and "aimless." The
Inglewood Democrat said the problems of high
property taxes, crime, welfare, unemployment,
pollution and rising school costs were all worse in 1970
than they had been when Reagan assumed office.
Students Lose Aid
WASHINGTON — Some 434 students at 8 6 colleges
and universities have lost federal financial aid because
they participated in campus disorders, the Office of
Education said Thursday.
Most of the penalized students attended small
colleges rather than the major universities that
experienced the most severe disruptions, according to a
government report covering the period since June
1969.
Soviet Plane Hijacked
TRABZON, Turkey — A Jewish father and his son
carrying shotguns, pistols and grenades hijacked a
Soviet airliner Thursday and forced it to fly across the
border into Turkey. The plane landed at this coastal
town with the stewardess shot to death and three other
crewmen wounded.
It was the first known successful hijacking of a
Soviet passenger plane although there have been at
least four other attempts. Moscow promptly asked
Turkey to extradite the hijackers and return the plane.
Officials identified the hijackers as Brazinskas
Koroyero, 46, and his son Algedas, 18. They
surrendered to police and asked for political asylum.

Heart Transplant Here
STANFORD, Calif. - Richard J. Cope, 45, of East
Patchogue, N.Y., received a transplanted heart
Thursday in a Stanford Medical Center operation by a
team headed by Dr. Norman E. Shumway.
Cope, a retired engineer, became the 26 th heart
transplant patient at Stanford.
'People's Park 9
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal court jury cleared a
former Alameda County deputy sheriff Thursday of
charges stemming from shotgun injuries to two persons
in the May, 1969, "People's Park" riot, but the jury
failed to reach a verdict in the case of a third injured
man.
The verdicts raised the possibility of as many as four
trials for Lawrence Riche in U.S. District Court.
Riche was acquitted Sept. 16 of a similar charge of
violating the civil rights of another man by firing at
him. A third trial has already been scheduled for
charges stemming from injuries to a fifth man.
A retrial because of the hung jury Thursday night
would probably require a fourth trial, a court official
said.
Agriculture
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration has
turned down a task force recommendation that a new
consumer agency be set up in the Agriculture
Department to handle meat and poultry inspection.
The inspection programs now are built into what
the task force calls the "complex organization" of the
department's Consumer and Marketing Service. The
report says inspection is too big a job for the agency.
"There is an inherent difference in the nature of
marketing and regulatory programs which creates an
internal administrative conflict," the report said.
