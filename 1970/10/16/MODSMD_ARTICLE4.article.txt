# BSU Meetings Promote White Awareness
## 
### GREGORY VAIL 
In its continuing efforts to inform
the University community of its
purposes and goals, the Black Students
Union (BSU) held a series of informal
discussion groups on Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday throughout campus
dorms.
One such meeting was held in
Trancos lounge on Tuesday, was led by
BSU member James Jefferson.
Approximately 75 students attended
the meeting.
Jefferson emphasized an essential
BSU prupose was to "ensure black
survival." He said that while the BSU
has no formal platform, it prefers to
give active support to "programs that

are real for Stanford students."
Although most black students belong
to the BSU, Jefferson was quick to
point out that a complete spectrum of
political beliefs is represented within
the organization.
The black student described a broad
range of on and off campus BSU
activities. In recent months the
students have directed a large portion
of their energies into promoting
cultural and educational programs in
East Palo Alto. On campus, the BSU is
engaged in promoting community
awareness of black culture through a
combination of plays, music programs,
speakers, and other events.
Exclusivity Attached
During the course of the meeting,
some Trancos freshmen accused the
BSU of "reverse racism" as evidenced
by its "exclusive" membership rules.
Jefferson replied that such impressions
have been nurtured by the media
including the Daily, which, he said,
implied that BSIFs the first open
meeting this fall was closed.
Mutual Problems
"The fact that the BSU does have
closed meetings is due to the needs of
black students to discuss mutual
problems on a collective basis", he said.
Asked if the BSU has any affiliation
with other campus groups such as
MECHA, Jefferson stated that it has no
official ties with other organizations,
but would form a coalition with them
if a common cause developed.
Turning to another aspect of campus
politics he noted that BSU members are
running for the ASSU Senate, but that
the organization is not officially
fielding a slate of its own.

All BSU members present expressed
annoyance at some whites "activists"
who "go off to the hills and get high"
while blacks are getting harassed on
campus. They said that the BSU is
attempting to avoid rhetoric and
instead attack the substance of the
problems they are trying to solve.
The BSU representatives also
outlined a variety of grievances:
— The 3.5 percent black
representation in the student body is,
in their words, "ridiculously small".
They believe that it should be increased
to a more representative 13-14 percent.
—Concerning admissions policies in
general, Jefferson said that the
contention that underqualified blacks
were being admitted was "total
bullshit;" he cited in support of his
statement the fact that blacks at
Stanford have a higher collective GPA
that white students.
"Basing qualifications of black
students on SAT scores is worthless,
since such tests are culturally biased
towards white middle class values,"
Jefferson said.
Funding Hit
—The increasing lack of financial aid
for students from low-income families
was also deplored. According to the
BSU members present, the bulk of the
financial aid is going to white students
from families in the top one-quarter of
the economic scale - those who need it
least.
— Finally, the black students
attacked the Afro-American Studies
Program. They said that it had no
provision for a direct major in the
subject, that its "program" status leaves
it the orphan child of other

departments, and that its original
$135 ,000 budget has been slashed to
$35,000, "barely enough to pay two
T.A.'s."
Stanford has referred to the
Afro-American Studies Program as a
$500,000 project, however, this refers
to $5 00,000 of General Motors stock,
dividends from which finance the
program.
Some white students asked how
they might rid themselves of the
underlying racism inbred by society.
Jefferson replied that to do so, one
must make a deep self-analysis. He
continued to say that whites'

encounters with black culture could be
valuable in persuading parents and
friends to end their racism.
However, the other BSU
representatives were more skeptical
about the chances of racial harmony.
They cited repeated harassment by
police, the burning last spring of a
notebook on a BSU member's door in
Serra House, and other incidents to
substantiate their feelings. Asked
whether Stanford was racist, one BSU
member replied that "Stanford is the
same as any white, private insitiution
dedicated to the preservation of the
white establishment."

about the chances of racial harmony.
They cited repeated harassment by
police, the burning last spring of a
notebook on a BSU member's door in
Serra House, and other incidents to
substantiate their feelings. Asked
whether Stanford was racist, one BSU
member replied that "Stanford is the
same as any white, private insitiution
dedicated to the preservation of the
white establishment."
In its continuing efforts to inform
the University community of its
purposes and goals, the Black Students
Union (BSU) held a series of informal
discussion groups on Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday throughout campus
dorms.
One such meeting was held in
Trancos lounge on Tuesday, was led by
BSU member James Jefferson.
Approximately 75 students attended
the meeting.
Jefferson emphasized an essential
BSU prupose was to "ensure black
survival." He said that while the BSU
has no formal platform, it prefers to
give active support to "programs that

are real for Stanford students."
Although most black students belong
to the BSU, Jefferson was quick to
point out that a complete spectrum of
political beliefs is represented within
the organization.
The black student described a broad
range of on and off campus BSU
activities. In recent months the
students have directed a large portion
of their energies into promoting
cultural and educational programs in
East Palo Alto. On campus, the BSU is
engaged in promoting community
awareness of black culture through a
combination of plays, music programs,
speakers, and other events.
Exclusivity Attached
During the course of the meeting,
some Trancos freshmen accused the
BSU of "reverse racism" as evidenced
by its "exclusive" membership rules.
Jefferson replied that such impressions
have been nurtured by the media
including the Daily, which, he said,
implied that BSIFs the first open
meeting this fall was closed.
Mutual Problems
"The fact that the BSU does have
closed meetings is due to the needs of
black students to discuss mutual
problems on a collective basis", he said.
Asked if the BSU has any affiliation
with other campus groups such as
MECHA, Jefferson stated that it has no
official ties with other organizations,
but would form a coalition with them
if a common cause developed.
Turning to another aspect of campus
politics he noted that BSU members are
running for the ASSU Senate, but that
the organization is not officially
fielding a slate of its own.

All BSU members present expressed
annoyance at some whites "activists"
who "go off to the hills and get high"
while blacks are getting harassed on
campus. They said that the BSU is
attempting to avoid rhetoric and
instead attack the substance of the
problems they are trying to solve.
The BSU representatives also
outlined a variety of grievances:
— The 3.5 percent black
representation in the student body is,
in their words, "ridiculously small".
They believe that it should be increased
to a more representative 13-14 percent.
—Concerning admissions policies in
general, Jefferson said that the
contention that underqualified blacks
were being admitted was "total
bullshit;" he cited in support of his
statement the fact that blacks at
Stanford have a higher collective GPA
that white students.
"Basing qualifications of black
students on SAT scores is worthless,
since such tests are culturally biased
towards white middle class values,"
Jefferson said.
Funding Hit
—The increasing lack of financial aid
for students from low-income families
was also deplored. According to the
BSU members present, the bulk of the
financial aid is going to white students
from families in the top one-quarter of
the economic scale - those who need it
least.
— Finally, the black students
attacked the Afro-American Studies
Program. They said that it had no
provision for a direct major in the
subject, that its "program" status leaves
it the orphan child of other

departments, and that its original
$135 ,000 budget has been slashed to
$35,000, "barely enough to pay two
T.A.'s."
Stanford has referred to the
Afro-American Studies Program as a
$500,000 project, however, this refers
to $5 00,000 of General Motors stock,
dividends from which finance the
program.
Some white students asked how
they might rid themselves of the
underlying racism inbred by society.
Jefferson replied that to do so, one
must make a deep self-analysis. He
continued to say that whites'

encounters with black culture could be
valuable in persuading parents and
friends to end their racism.

Some white students asked how
they might rid themselves of the
underlying racism inbred by society.
Jefferson replied that to do so, one
must make a deep self-analysis. He
continued to say that whites'

encounters with black culture could be
valuable in persuading parents and
friends to end their racism.
However, the other BSU
representatives were more skeptical
about the chances of racial harmony.
They cited repeated harassment by
police, the burning last spring of a
notebook on a BSU member's door in
Serra House, and other incidents to
substantiate their feelings. Asked
whether Stanford was racist, one BSU
member replied that "Stanford is the
same as any white, private insitiution
dedicated to the preservation of the
white establishment."
In its continuing efforts to inform
the University community of its
purposes and goals, the Black Students
Union (BSU) held a series of informal
discussion groups on Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday throughout campus
dorms.
One such meeting was held in
Trancos lounge on Tuesday, was led by
BSU member James Jefferson.
Approximately 75 students attended
the meeting.
Jefferson emphasized an essential
BSU prupose was to "ensure black
survival." He said that while the BSU
has no formal platform, it prefers to
give active support to "programs that

are real for Stanford students."
Although most black students belong
to the BSU, Jefferson was quick to
point out that a complete spectrum of
political beliefs is represented within
the organization.
The black student described a broad
range of on and off campus BSU
activities. In recent months the
students have directed a large portion
of their energies into promoting
cultural and educational programs in
East Palo Alto. On campus, the BSU is
engaged in promoting community
awareness of black culture through a
combination of plays, music programs,
speakers, and other events.
Exclusivity Attached
During the course of the meeting,
some Trancos freshmen accused the
BSU of "reverse racism" as evidenced
by its "exclusive" membership rules.
Jefferson replied that such impressions
have been nurtured by the media
including the Daily, which, he said,
implied that BSIFs the first open
meeting this fall was closed.
Mutual Problems
"The fact that the BSU does have
closed meetings is due to the needs of
black students to discuss mutual
problems on a collective basis", he said.
Asked if the BSU has any affiliation
with other campus groups such as
MECHA, Jefferson stated that it has no
official ties with other organizations,
but would form a coalition with them
if a common cause developed.
Turning to another aspect of campus
politics he noted that BSU members are
running for the ASSU Senate, but that
the organization is not officially
fielding a slate of its own.

All BSU members present expressed
annoyance at some whites "activists"
who "go off to the hills and get high"
while blacks are getting harassed on
campus. They said that the BSU is
attempting to avoid rhetoric and
instead attack the substance of the
problems they are trying to solve.
The BSU representatives also
outlined a variety of grievances:
— The 3.5 percent black
representation in the student body is,
in their words, "ridiculously small".
They believe that it should be increased
to a more representative 13-14 percent.
—Concerning admissions policies in
general, Jefferson said that the
contention that underqualified blacks
were being admitted was "total
bullshit;" he cited in support of his
statement the fact that blacks at
Stanford have a higher collective GPA
that white students.
"Basing qualifications of black
students on SAT scores is worthless,
since such tests are culturally biased
towards white middle class values,"
Jefferson said.
Funding Hit
—The increasing lack of financial aid
for students from low-income families
was also deplored. According to the
BSU members present, the bulk of the
financial aid is going to white students
from families in the top one-quarter of
the economic scale - those who need it
least.
— Finally, the black students
attacked the Afro-American Studies
Program. They said that it had no
provision for a direct major in the
subject, that its "program" status leaves
it the orphan child of other

departments, and that its original
$135 ,000 budget has been slashed to
$35,000, "barely enough to pay two
T.A.'s."
Stanford has referred to the
Afro-American Studies Program as a
$500,000 project, however, this refers
to $5 00,000 of General Motors stock,
dividends from which finance the
program.
Some white students asked how
they might rid themselves of the
underlying racism inbred by society.
Jefferson replied that to do so, one
must make a deep self-analysis. He
continued to say that whites'

encounters with black culture could be
valuable in persuading parents and
friends to end their racism.
