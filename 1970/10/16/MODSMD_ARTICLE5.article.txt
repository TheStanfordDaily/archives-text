# Lyman Confirms ROTC Credit Status For Frosh

President Richard Lyman yesterday
confirmed that all of the 25 freshmen
enrolled in ROTC will receive credit for
sophomore and upperclass level studies.
He told the Faculty Senate that the
freshmen will take an accelerated,
three-year program.
Sociology Professor Sanford
Dornbusch, chairman of the Faculty
Senate, told the Daily last night, "It is
my impression that most (Senate
members) felt that President Lyman
had fulfilled the various mandates and
actions of the Senate and Academic
Council regarding ROTC."
Confusion arose Regarding c redit for
the freshman because the Faculty

Senate terminated credit (except for
those in the program at that time) for
ROTC classes last May. A month after
that decision, the Faculty Senate
approved the idea that no ROTC
students would be admitted after
Aguust 31 , 1970.
However, University and Navy
officials negotiated a compromise
during the summer allowing freshmen
into ROTC this year because the late
date of the Senate action made it
impossible for the freshmen to be
placed elsewhere on ROTC classes.
