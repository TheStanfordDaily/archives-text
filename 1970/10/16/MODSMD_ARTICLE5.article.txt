# Lyman Confirms ROTC Credit Status For Frosh
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
President Richard Lyman yesterday
confirmed that all of the 25 freshmen
enrolled in ROTC will receive credit for
sophomore and upperclass level studies.
He told the Faculty Senate that the
freshmen will take an accelerated,
three-year program.
Sociology Professor Sanford
Dornbusch, chairman of the Faculty
Senate, told the Daily last night, "It is
my impression that most (Senate
members) felt that President Lyman
had fulfilled the various mandates and
actions of the Senate and Academic
Council regarding ROTC."
Confusion arose Regarding c redit for
the freshman because the Faculty

Senate terminated credit (except for
those in the program at that time) for
ROTC classes last May. A month after
that decision, the Faculty Senate
approved the idea that no ROTC
students would be admitted after
Aguust 31 , 1970.
However, University and Navy
officials negotiated a compromise
during the summer allowing freshmen
into ROTC this year because the late
date of the Senate action made it
impossible for the freshmen to be
placed elsewhere on ROTC classes.
Confusion
Confusion arose during the summer
when former President Kenneth Pltzer
wrote the Navy: "I believe that the
faculty of this University will probably
be amenable to petitions for credit for
some of the naval science courses from
those students who will be (newly)
enrolled in the fall of 1970."
He subsequently approved a News
Service release stating that "30 entering
freshmen will be allowed to take
NROTC training at Stanford this fall
on a non-credit basis." Only 21 of the
NROTC scholarship holders actually
enrolled.
In a telegram on September 25 to an
assistant secretary of the Army, Lyman
said that the Navy agreed to the prior
faculty actions on ROTC although, "I
now understand that the Army is not
prepared to make similar arrangements
and that it is the view of the Army that
the only acceptable arrangements for
our entering freshman class are those
specified in the current contract."
Army Cadets
In accord with the Army contract,
which required a year's notice prior to
termination, two ROTC scholarship
winners and two other freshmen are
now taking a sophomore-level course
for credit and will take a freshman
course on a non-credit basis during
Winter Quarter. They will then be in
phase with upperclass cadets.
Lyman added in this telegram, "To
avoid any further misunderstanding, let
me make it clear that this proposal
contemplates the final withdrawal of
Army ROTC at Stanford in June, 1973.
It accommodates the present freshman
class, but contemplates no freshman
admissions beyond that."

The telegram also said that freshman
"instruction would be without
academic credit, except for cases of
individual students who may petition
for credit on the grounds of academic
hardship and except to the extent that
freshman instruction can be phased
into the instruction of upperclassmen,
whose military science courses are now
offered for credit."
When an initial group of about seven
entering cadets enrolled in the
sophomore-level classes submitted
petitions for credit after the start of
classes, Registrar Harvey Hall was
advised by Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig that this should be given.

approved the idea that no ROTC
students would be admitted after
Aguust 31 , 1970.
However, University and Navy
officials negotiated a compromise
during the summer allowing freshmen
into ROTC this year because the late
date of the Senate action made it
impossible for the freshmen to be
placed elsewhere on ROTC classes.
Confusion
Confusion arose during the summer
when former President Kenneth Pltzer
wrote the Navy: "I believe that the
faculty of this University will probably
be amenable to petitions for credit for
some of the naval science courses from
those students who will be (newly)
enrolled in the fall of 1970."
He subsequently approved a News
Service release stating that "30 entering
freshmen will be allowed to take
NROTC training at Stanford this fall
on a non-credit basis." Only 21 of the
NROTC scholarship holders actually
enrolled.
In a telegram on September 25 to an
assistant secretary of the Army, Lyman
said that the Navy agreed to the prior
faculty actions on ROTC although, "I
now understand that the Army is not
prepared to make similar arrangements
and that it is the view of the Army that
the only acceptable arrangements for
our entering freshman class are those
specified in the current contract."
Army Cadets
In accord with the Army contract,
which required a year's notice prior to
termination, two ROTC scholarship
winners and two other freshmen are
now taking a sophomore-level course
for credit and will take a freshman
course on a non-credit basis during
Winter Quarter. They will then be in
phase with upperclass cadets.
Lyman added in this telegram, "To
avoid any further misunderstanding, let
me make it clear that this proposal
contemplates the final withdrawal of
Army ROTC at Stanford in June, 1973.
It accommodates the present freshman
class, but contemplates no freshman
admissions beyond that."

The telegram also said that freshman
"instruction would be without
academic credit, except for cases of
individual students who may petition
for credit on the grounds of academic
hardship and except to the extent that
freshman instruction can be phased
into the instruction of upperclassmen,
whose military science courses are now
offered for credit."
When an initial group of about seven
entering cadets enrolled in the
sophomore-level classes submitted
petitions for credit after the start of
classes, Registrar Harvey Hall was
advised by Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig that this should be given.
President Richard Lyman yesterday
confirmed that all of the 25 freshmen
enrolled in ROTC will receive credit for
sophomore and upperclass level studies.
He told the Faculty Senate that the
freshmen will take an accelerated,
three-year program.
Sociology Professor Sanford
Dornbusch, chairman of the Faculty
Senate, told the Daily last night, "It is
my impression that most (Senate
members) felt that President Lyman
had fulfilled the various mandates and
actions of the Senate and Academic
Council regarding ROTC."
Confusion arose Regarding c redit for
the freshman because the Faculty

Senate terminated credit (except for
those in the program at that time) for
ROTC classes last May. A month after
that decision, the Faculty Senate
approved the idea that no ROTC
students would be admitted after
Aguust 31 , 1970.
