# porno + the bomb
## Obscene Obstinacy 
### jesse cedarbaum 
Wednesday morning's papers
bore two very interesting, though
unrelated, headlines. One
concerned itself with the bombing
of the Center for International
Affairs at Harvard, the other with
the Senate's rejection of the latest
report on the relative merits of
pornography.
Now, you might ask yourself,

what the hell could these two
occurrences possibly have to do
with one another?
The rejection of the
pornography report came as no
surprise. It is not the first
governmental report to be
rejected, nor will it be the last.
And it is a well-known fact that
the findings of the commission

which prepared the report are not
exactly commensurate with the
Protestant Ethic from which our
Nation draws its moral
sustenance.
Erstwhile Lawmakers
However, it is significant to
note that even with all the
advance publicity, it still took our
erstwhile lawmakers forty minutes
to decide that the prono
commission had returned a
document which represented
nothing but "marshmallow-head
ed thinking."
It took forty minutes for an
effete group of non-professionals
to discredit three years' work by a
corps of objective, supposedly
intelligent researchers whom they
themselves had appointed.
That's tantamount to John
Mitchell saying that although all
the facts on dope aren't in yet, he
knows that the "killer weed" will
indeed prove fatal.
Father Knows Best
But Father Knows Best, and
three years of research in this
country and the indisputable
evidence stemming from the
legalization of smut in Denmark
(where sex crimes, are down to a
mere drivel compared to previous
levels), all leading to the
conclusion that filth is not
harmful, let alone dirty, hold no
water next to their esteemed
judgements. Such obstinacy is
perhaps more obscene than the
substance of the report itself.
So the Report of the
Commission Pornography has
been consigned to the same
odious fate as the somewhat less
erotic works of Scranton, Kerner,
et. al. And certain liberals wonder
why the days of "rational
dialogue" are over.
Increased Radicalism
For it is such "irrational
monologueing" as the Senate's
treatment of the smut report
which makes events like the
Harvard bombing understandable.
If legal, sanctioned criticism of
the existing status quo cannot be
tolerated by those in power, the
reaction to uninvited criticism
cannot be much better. The result
of such actions is, on the one
hand, to produce a disillusioned
apathy in some, and on the other
hand, to inspire increased
radicalism in others.
The only recourse that seems
to be open to those who find
themselves outside the "system"
and who find their rhetoric
blocked by Agnew's alliteration
and Mitchell's mastication, is to
9eek ever more violent means of
expressing their dissent. The
current wave of bombings across
the nation is a product of this
kind of desperation.
Beat Goes Underground
But slashing at the tips of the
Establishment's tentacles
accomplishes nothing. Within
hours after the bombing of the
Army's research facility at the
University of Wisconsin this
summer, the entire operation had
been re-established at a secret
location nearby and continued to
function uninterrupted. The only
purpose served by this type of
attack is to drive the beast into an
underground cocoon from which
it will doubtless emerge much
more menacing and ruthless than
before.
Just where this leaves those
who still wish to see changes
wrought in America society, even
though they are reticent to resort
to or condone full-scale violence,
is uncertain. However, as disgust
at actions similar to that the
Senate has just taken grows, the
outrage that many feel at terrorist
attacks and bobmings is likely to
lessen, thus enhancing the
atmosphere for further insane
destruction which accomplishes
nothing except to bolster the egos
of a miniscule cult of
pro to-revolutionaries.
