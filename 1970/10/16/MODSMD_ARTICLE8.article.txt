Vientiane, Laos â€” Shells of men smiling idiot
grimaces into somewhere between life and death,
they stumble and shuffle, moan through the
streets of the city in search of pennies to buy a fix.
There have been a dozen of them here tonight, all
of them know faces, but maybe later a new one.
There are always new ones.
"I don't know why I started," one of the newer
ones whines through rusty black teeth, "and I
don't know how to stop. My family won't have
me; I have no friends. When I don't have the
money, oh, the sickness, the terrible sickness."
He whines on, his voice rising and rising and all
those in the large Chinese soup kitchen are
watching and listening, but he doesn't know or
doesn't care. The Thai boys from across the
Mekong who wait tables giggle among themselves
and with their customers.
He stinks even at a distance. His baggy clothes
from someone's cast-off bundle have turned a
dusty oil black and they shine where the filth is
polished at the seams; ripped, splotched, spattered
and mouldering. The boys are afraid to touch
them.
Why Can't I Stop?
"I have a wife and five children, but my wife
told me to go away and never come home, so I
went. And now look at me. Oh, why can't I stop?"
There seems always to be one of the dozen
junkies here. They have come and go and will
come again to squat on their heels before eating
patrons, perhaps mumbling supplication, perhaps
just to watch with shrewd eyes for that sign of
recognition that brings five kips, As the
night wanes toward early morning they'll finally
have enough for the early fix. It's grimly marginal
at best.
There are more than 15 0 legal opium dens in
Vientiane but "God alone knows the real total,"
said one resident. Opium smoking is legal here, if
you have the license and frequent the licensed
dens, but few have the dollar license and few dens
require it anyway. Nobody cares, and certainly not
Vientiane's junkies because it's not the opium they
need but the leavings, more and more,of it.

The leavings are one of the things called heroin
here, one of the by-products from the various uses
of opium. After a few pipes (a pipe is one filling
and burning of the bowl) a residue, said to be high
in morphine content, collects in the stem. It is
scraped out, dried and sold to the junkies who
crave more than the mellow sap of the poppy.
Much cheaper, a deadly addiction is the quick
result. It can be eaten, smoked, or injected when
dissolved. The first is most common.
"No, no special addiction here," a police
sergeant says, "just some no good people who
don't want to work so they stay drunk," he
explains and giggles. "You want me to chase these
men away for you? We Lao people are very
tolerant," he assures and laughs again. "It's a mark
of goodness that we give them money to eat so
they won't die."
Soup Kitchen
But they aren't alive really, and they don't use
the money for eating. Instead they come through
the soup kitchen a last time before its closing to
scoop the remainders of fried noodles, rice soup,
Chinese tomato sauce and bits of sugarless
doughnuts into plastic bags where it becomes an
orange mass that curls the lips of the Thai boys.
The money will buy tomorrow's first fix.
Oldtimers here say there's always been a junkie
population; after all, opium is about as old as man
in Asia, but in the last year they note a radical
growth in numbers. "Any self-respecting opium
addict wouldn't touch the stuff," sniffs a
westerner-addict, but the Americans and their war
started interfering with the opium supply until it
got so expensive that the poorest addicts turned to
junk rather than the good stuff. Now they can't
come down even though the price of opium has."
In the dead hours of Vientiane's night they go
somewhere to sleep, usually in the entryway of a
building, sometimes on the front porch of a Lao
house; the Laos are tolerant that way. Sometimes
during the daylight you see them sprawled out
against a times they are, all the way.
