This is
the "something good"
\ you've been
looking for.
When you go shopping for "something really good" in stereo
equipment, you usually have to pay more than you expected,
or settle for something less than you expected.
The KLH'ModelTwenty-Four changes that situation radically.
The Model Twenty-Four is a complete stereo music system.
Its performance and sound quality are close—very close—to
that of the best equipment that KLH, or anyone else, makes.
But it costs only a fraction of what it sounds like. And it fits
gracefully into any living room.
There's nothing missing from the Model Twenty-Four. It
has a sensitive, drift-free FM stereo tuner, a custom-made
Garrard record changer with Pickering cartridge and diamond
stylus, plus jacks for external equipment and for making tape
recordings. The solid-state circuitry is powerful enough for
any living room, and the unobtrusive speaker cabinets contain
a pair of full-range, two-speaker systems.
The modest size and price of the Twenty-Four are the result
of advanced engineering instead of corner-cutting. Everything
from its components to its oiled-walnut cabinetry is designed
to provide a genuine surprise rather than that "nice for the
money" feeling.
Come see and hear how little it can cost for something
really good.

This is
the "something good"
\ you've been
looking for.
When you go shopping for "something really good" in stereo
equipment, you usually have to pay more than you expected,
or settle for something less than you expected.
The KLH'ModelTwenty-Four changes that situation radically.
The Model Twenty-Four is a complete stereo music system.
Its performance and sound quality are close—very close—to
that of the best equipment that KLH, or anyone else, makes.
But it costs only a fraction of what it sounds like. And it fits
gracefully into any living room.
There's nothing missing from the Model Twenty-Four. It
has a sensitive, drift-free FM stereo tuner, a custom-made
Garrard record changer with Pickering cartridge and diamond
stylus, plus jacks for external equipment and for making tape
recordings. The solid-state circuitry is powerful enough for
any living room, and the unobtrusive speaker cabinets contain
a pair of full-range, two-speaker systems.
The modest size and price of the Twenty-Four are the result
of advanced engineering instead of corner-cutting. Everything
from its components to its oiled-walnut cabinetry is designed
to provide a genuine surprise rather than that "nice for the
money" feeling.
Come see and hear how little it can cost for something
really good.
