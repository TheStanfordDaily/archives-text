# Jing Lyman-Veteran Political Worker
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
Jing Lyman is an alive sort of person with a sense
of fun and a sense of purpose. She fulfills all the
"Better Homes and Gardens" cliches of the ideal
suburban matron—and then in her spare time she goes
out to be a person in her own right.
"Each of us has an obligation to develop an
interest—to be knowledgeable in some political
sphere," the five-foot-ten Stanford first lady
maintains.
Jing Lyman discovered her issue in 1958 , when she
became involved in the fight against Proposition 14, a
referendum (later declared unconsitiutional) to
prohibit open housing legislation. "I sort of backed
into my issue," she recalls.
Although the proposition passed by a two-to-one
margin statewide, voters in the mid-peninsula area
soundly defeated it. Propelled by their limited
success, the campaigners formed the Mid-Peninsula
Citizens For Fair Housing (MPCFH).
Over the past decade Mrs. Lyman has expanded
her involvement in area housing problems. Asa result
she is now president of the MPCFH and chairman of
the more recently formed Fair Housing Task Force of
the Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition.
Money And Racism
The 4 5-year old activist says that the
mid-peninsula's housing problems revolve around
economic and racial biases.
"Unless you have an income of $12-13,000 a year,
you simply cannot buy a house in the mid-peninsula
area," she says. In addition, a MPCFH study of
Mountain View shows "overt discrimination" exists
in 40 percent of the cases, she notes.
Ira Hall, Stanford trustee director of the
Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition, notes that Mrs.
Lyman's leadership, understanding of political
institutions and 'stick-to-it-iveness" make her
effective. "She's very much involved in the solution
of many of the pressing problems, especially housing,
in this area."

Although the Urban Coalition is sponsoring the
construction of 200 new housing units at Stanford,
Mrs. Lyman, a member of the executive committee,
emphasizes that she will abstain from voting on
management of the program to avoid a conflict of
interest.
While denying that Stanford should provide
housing for all its workers, she admits that "Stanford
has created the employment picture that creates the
desperate need for this housing."
Mrs. Lyman is unimpressed with the Palo Alto
Tenants' Union (PATU),a group that has accused the
University of tokenism in building only 200 units to
deal with the housing crisis. She feels that Stanford is
making a good start, and can provide impetus to
surrounding communities to take responsibility for
this problem.
Fed Up
"I get very, very fed up with charges from people
who have not dealt with these problems over the
years and seen the changes that have occurred."
Violence and scare tactics are counter-productive, she
feels.
Sitting in her modernistic book-filled living room,
she talks wistfully about the conflict between the
preservation of open space and reality of how people
live. The bulletins of the Sierra Club and the
Audubon Society lie on the coffee table along with
"Nature Conservancy News."
"This (she gestures at the room) is unacceptable
when others live in congestion. This will pollute us
all. You can't divorce segments of a community into
crowded, unhealthy conditions. It just won't work
that way."
Committed Atmosphere
Jing Lyman grew up in an atmosphere where social
problems were considered important. Her mother
worked on the Quaker-run American Friends Service
Committee and her teacher-father worked for the
Roosevelt government.
She believes in mixing things up; races, ethnic
groups, generations, economic classes and ideas.
"Mixes are dynamic, exciting. We make a mistake in

saying that you've got to do this because you're
that."
Sexual sterotyping is as dangerous as racial
stereotyping according the dark-haired mother of
four. "So many women have been plodding along in a
homemaker's rut and they forget that they can do
and learn."
Women
So, Mrs. Lyman also has "backed into" the
problems of job opportunities and continuing
education for women.
While disclaiming any allegiance to a "woman's lib
line," Mrs. Lyman expouses many of the basic points
of the movement. Stanford's quota of women is
"unfortunate," she says, but the real problem starts
further back. "Little girls are taught that there are
certain things that little girls do and little boys are
taught that there are certain things that little boys do
and that's it."
Many faculty wives were "just spinning their
wheels" after their children were grown because
"they did not have any direction for the use of their
competence. Lack of self-confidence is the wives
basic problem," she says.
The "understanding and supportiveness" of her
husband has made her participation in community
affairs possible, she says, "his willingness to do some
of the humdrum housework has helped."
Mrs. Lyman gave up a career as an elementary
school teacher (she taught wood shop to five to
ten-year-olds) when her first child was born, but she
doeai't regret it. "Teaching wasn't really what I
wanted," she says, although community education is
a backbone of her housing campaigns. She believes
that people should feel free to change directions in
their lives when they want to.
Mrs. Lyman insists that her husband's
appointment as University president will not limit
what she says for herself, though. It will, of necessity,
encroach on her "free time." She confesses to being
scared of the job, but adds, "Neither of us are
daunted easily.
