Cable T.V.
The President's Ad Hoc
Committee on Cable Television
will hold an open meeting
tomorrow at 3:15 p.m. in the
Forum room of the Meyer
Library. All interested members
of the community are invited to
present thier views on what
requirements any CATV
franchises have been granted for
Menlo Park and East Palo Alto
and many of the good head-end
antenna sites are on Stanford
land, Stanford may be able to
influence these systems for the
better. The committee members
are very njuch concerned with the
question of community access to
the system, and 'bridging' the
Bayshore freeway to tie
communities on both sides
together.

Ideas such as making college
courses available by TV, data
transmission, library access, etc.
are being discussed and ideas and
comments from the community
are being solicited.
Medical Costs
Rapidly rising hospital costs
have severely hampered further
study for several unsuspecting
Stanford students this past year
when their available funds had to
be spent for unexpected and
uninsured medical and hospital
bills.
Dr. James McClenahan at
Cowell Student Health Center and
Ken Kaufman with the Student
Loan Program strongly urge all
students to investigate their
medical insurance coverage to
make certain that should disaster
strike, the already grave problems
are not compounded by an
inability to meet inflationary
hospital costs.
Students may in some cases
have adequate coverage under
their parent's medical insurance;
though this should be carefully
checked both with the parent and
his insurance company.
Other students should
investigate either coverage offered
by the University or any
competitive, but comprehensive,
medical Insurance. McClenahan
and Kaufman cannot stress
enough the importance of
adequate and sensible protection.
