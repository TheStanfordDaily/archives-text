# Final 'Persuasion' For Shondells
## 
### 
Police in Steamboat Springs,
Colorado, today announced the
tragic death of the popular
"youth culture" rock group
Tommy James and the Shondells,
apparently from a drug overdose.
"We can't be sure until the
coroner flies up from Denver,"
said Sheriff Peter "Redeye"
Punkineater, "but it sure looks
like oregano to me."
Oregano is a leafy drug similar
in appearance to marijuana, which
first made a wide-scale appearance
during President Nixon's
"Operation Intercept." Due to its
only recent popularity, it does
not appear on any FDA
"dangerous drug" list, but is
described by New Orleans
trumpeter A 1 Hirtz, who struggled
to "kick" the habit for the past
six months, as "a real killer, man,
a real killer." Recently, in a
speech to Republican donors in
Winnemucca, Nevada,
Vice-President Agnew attacked

"between-the-lines drug songs like
'Parsley, Sage, Oregano, and
Thyme' which obviously
encourages the use of such drugs.
"Street slang for oregano includes
such terms as "woodie," "easy
rider," and "frug."
Reaction was swift across the
underground Woodstock Nation,
despite a general response of "Oh
no!," "Who's next?," and "What
time is it?" Wrote social critic
Ralph J. Plesin' in the San
Francisco "Chronicle" early
edition: "I saw it coming for
years, from the first time they
blew my mind on the old Dick
Clark show. All that
"hanky-panky "—a terribly
self-destructive, agonizingly
self-searching lyrical content. Who
can blame the kids for messing
around with dope? Look at how
their parents drink! Somebody
offered me a joint at Monterey
two years ago, but I said no. Rock
music has changed the world, but
the world wants its pennies
back."
Rolling Stone magazine,
in a special supplement now at the
presses, traces the development of
the Shondells, in an article by
critic Lester Bangs, from "what
appeared to be just another
jerk-off group singing "My Baby
Does The Hanky-Panky" to what
perhaps became, in such
thinly-veiled revolution songs as
"Crystal Blue Persuasion," the
ultimate expression of youth
dissatisfaction and a solid step
inside the mainstream of good old
rock'n'roll."
Other reactions, at a glance:
Vice-President Spiro T.
Agnew:" I caught my duaghter
Kim listening to that record just a
while ago, Everybody knows that
"hanky-panky" is the new "in"
expression among liberal-radicals
for raping and looting. The song is
obviously about the Weatherman
rampage ' on the streets of
Chicago."
A groupie in New York:
"Lester bangs who?"
French motion picture director
Jean-Luc Godard, whose next
movie, "One Plus One Plus One
Equals One Hundred and Eleven,"
was to feature the Shondells:
"Freudemocracy! Marxsex!"
Unavailable for comment were
rock stars Buddy Holly, Richie
Valens and the Big Bopper.
Rock entrepreneur Bill
Graham: "These motherfuckin'
kids don't understand what a
great motherfuckin' performer is.
These guys were great
motherfuckin' performers. Next
week at the Fillmore, on

Thursday, Friday and Saturday,
with free posters and apples on
Sunday, we'll have Max Kerensky
and the Rebels, Trash, and a great
new group out of Borneo that'll
blow a few minds, I'll tell you."
President Nixon made no
direct comment but did allow his
press secretary to circulate the
following cryptic note among
newsmen:
"Sew shall ye sew, sew shall ye
weave."
In Steamboat Springs, Sheriff
Punkineater described the scene
from the top of a matress on his
flatbed truck. "Well," he said,
"they was all laid out on the floor
and this Tommy fella had this
here poem in his hand, and the
other fellas, they was all laid out
on the floor too, like they had
lost a contact lens or sumpin'.
They was cook in' some spaghetti
in the kitchenett, so me'n some of
the boys figure it was oregano,
sure enough."
Shondell's poem, released to
the press just twenty minutes
later, reads:
"My name is Antonioni
I don'/ eat no baloney
I just eat salami on rye.
The people in town,
They look at me and frown,
And say, "What'syour name?"
and I say,
My name is Antonioni,
I don 7 eat no baloney.
I just eat salami..."
At this point the handwriting
becomes illegible.

conference in the plush offices of
Cosmic Truth Record in New
York, Irish nobleman and
company president Lord I.
Lovapeace o'The Action had this
to say about the fast-flying
theories that the poem was in fact
unfinished, due to consternation
over that last illegible scrawl:
"As far as we at Cosmic Truth
are concerned," he said, "this
poem is probably the greatest
artistic effort of Tommy's career,
a searing indictment of the cold
face of small-town middle
America to our beautiful young
people. And with careful editing
of practice studio tapes the boys
made while they were here living
out this karma, we are sure that
we can reconstruct the poem into
the great hit single it should be.
"We'll just get our engineers to
find the same syllables in some of
the left-over studio tracks, adjust
the tape speed for correct pitch,
and use some of Tommy's
extensive musical notations in
Esperanto ... he was self-taught,

you know, didn't read a note of
music in English ... a genius! At
this point the good Lord left the
room, tears in his eyes and a
half-peeled onion in his hand,
which he had nervously wrung
during his short statement.
The record is now being
broken, i.e., introduced, on
Denver radio station KRAP.
Reports popular d.j. "Bullwinkle"
Whooogooseda Moose: The
requests are fantastic, and the hits
just keep on a' comin'!"
Charges flew for frenzied
minutes on end that Cosmic Truth
had in fact hired the Monkees to
do the instrumental back-up on
the record, and that the nearly
unintelligible words were in fact
Beatle Paul McCartney's last
public address (at Queen
Victoria's coronation shortly
before his own alleged death)
played backwards. "Ridiculous!"
snorted fellow Beatle and guitarist
Stu Sutcliffe from the Star Club
in Hamburg, Germany. "Paul's
just as alive as I am!"
Lord O'The Action denied all
the charges as "ludicrous and
heart-breaking in this time of
travail and recession-uhh,
depression, umm ... sadness,"
and Ralph J. Pleasin', in a late

edition of the "Chronicle" wrote:
"Somebody offered me a joint at
Monterey two years ago but 1
turned him down..." He
concluded that he was "convinced
that all is not hunky-dory in the
state of Colorado."
James was the son of a wealthy
milkman from Grosse Point
Farms, Michigan. Other members
of the group, first discovered in
the motel room by teen-age hero
Mark Rudd, who was questioned
by police and later released, were:
Faisal Al-eyoop, the Arab of the
group, organist, and age given as
22; Fender Bassman, about whom
no information was available at
presstime; Toussaint L'Ouverture,
black of the group, flautist and
age unknown; veteran British
rocker Charles Dickens, who had
just joined the group two days
ago, age unknown and Englishman
of the group; A Quang Fart, a
deaf-mute North Vietnamese
Regular on rhythm guitar,
thumb-tuba and machete, the
Oppressed people of the group;
and Maximilian Bonaparte
Alcatraz, age 39, drummer and
Indian of the group:
Said Eric Burdon in London:
"And Indians too."

HAPPY TRIALS—Tommy James and the Shondells have taken off for
good this time, but anyone who listened carefully to "I Think We're

Police in Steamboat Springs,
Colorado, today announced the
tragic death of the popular
"youth culture" rock group
Tommy James and the Shondells,
apparently from a drug overdose.
"We can't be sure until the
coroner flies up from Denver,"
said Sheriff Peter "Redeye"
Punkineater, "but it sure looks

Oregano is a leafy drug similar
in appearance to marijuana, which
first made a wide-scale appearance
during President Nixon's
"Operation Intercept." Due to its
only recent popularity, it does
not appear on any FDA
"dangerous drug" list, but is
described by New Orleans
trumpeter A 1 Hirtz, who struggled
to "kick" the habit for the past
six months, as "a real killer, man,
a real killer." Recently, in a
speech to Republican donors in
Winnemucca, Nevada,
Vice-President Agnew attacked

"between-the-lines drug songs like
'Parsley, Sage, Oregano, and
Thyme' which obviously
encourages the use of such drugs.
"Street slang for oregano includes
such terms as "woodie," "easy
rider," and "frug."
Reaction was swift across the
underground Woodstock Nation,
despite a general response of "Oh
no!," "Who's next?," and "What
time is it?" Wrote social critic
Ralph J. Plesin' in the San
Francisco "Chronicle" early
edition: "I saw it coming for
years, from the first time they
blew my mind on the old Dick

"hanky-panky "—a terribly

In Steamboat Springs, Sheriff

"they was all laid out on the floor

HAPPY TRIALS—Tommy James and the Shondells have taken off for
good this time, but anyone who listened carefully to "I Think We're

Police in Steamboat Springs,
Colorado, today announced the
tragic death of the popular
"youth culture" rock group
Tommy James and the Shondells,
apparently from a drug overdose.
"We can't be sure until the
coroner flies up from Denver,"
said Sheriff Peter "Redeye"
Punkineater, "but it sure looks
like oregano to me."
Oregano is a leafy drug similar
in appearance to marijuana, which
first made a wide-scale appearance
during President Nixon's
"Operation Intercept." Due to its
only recent popularity, it does
not appear on any FDA
"dangerous drug" list, but is
described by New Orleans
trumpeter A 1 Hirtz, who struggled
to "kick" the habit for the past
six months, as "a real killer, man,
a real killer." Recently, in a
speech to Republican donors in
Winnemucca, Nevada,
Vice-President Agnew attacked

"between-the-lines drug songs like
'Parsley, Sage, Oregano, and
Thyme' which obviously
encourages the use of such drugs.
"Street slang for oregano includes
such terms as "woodie," "easy
rider," and "frug."
Reaction was swift across the
underground Woodstock Nation,
despite a general response of "Oh
no!," "Who's next?," and "What
time is it?" Wrote social critic
Ralph J. Plesin' in the San
Francisco "Chronicle" early
edition: "I saw it coming for
years, from the first time they
blew my mind on the old Dick
Clark show. All that
"hanky-panky "—a terribly
self-destructive, agonizingly
self-searching lyrical content. Who
can blame the kids for messing
around with dope? Look at how
their parents drink! Somebody
offered me a joint at Monterey
two years ago, but I said no. Rock
music has changed the world, but
the world wants its pennies
back."
Rolling Stone magazine,
in a special supplement now at the
presses, traces the development of
the Shondells, in an article by
critic Lester Bangs, from "what

thinly-veiled revolution songs as

dissatisfaction and a solid step
