# 'Troilus And Cressida' A Dud
## 
### 
By STEVEN UNGAR
The Speech and Drama
Department opened its 1 970-71
season Wednesday with a
resounding thud.
I don't understand what line of
reasoning led to the decision to
open the year with "Troilus and
Cressida," but it must surely have
been very interesting. In fact, if
you could develop it into a play,
it would probably be better than
"Troilus and Cressida."
"Troilus and Cressida" is poor
enough to suggest the idea that
Shakespeare may have written
Marlowe's plays. It is probably his
least-produced play, although that
honor might belong to "Titus
Andro nicus."

As far as we can tell, the play
premiered in 1602, and was an
immediate flop. The first
production we know of after
Shakespeare's death was
re-written version by John Dryden
in 1697. That, too, was a flop.
The next known production was
in Munich, in 1898.
With a record like that, one
must wonder just what kind of
death-wish pervades the Speech
and Drama Department. "TSroilus
and Cressida" was not ignored for
two hundred years because it was
mis-understood; U was well
understood: It's terrible.
I am not going to go into the
details of why I think "Troilus
and Cressida" is weak as a play, as
a piece of literature, as epic, as
comedy, as poetry, or as anything
else. Suffice it to say that even a
good production of this play is
doomed.
And the Drama Department
production is good. It is strong in
just about every area—acting,
directing, design. But it's fighting
an uphill battle. When the basic
material is poor, it is very, very
hard to make it look good.
Director John Chioles had the
hardest joy of all. His efforts to
let the play say something,
anything, are evident throughout
the performance. The play suffers
from little character development,
a desultory plot, and almost no
action. Mr. Chioles has tried to
make it somewhat contemporary,
or perhaps timeless is a better
word. If you make the sets and
costumes as non-specific as
possible, any Great TYuths that

may have lay hidden somewhere
in the text have a better chance of
leaking out. (Of course, for this to
work, they have to be there.)
It was probably the best tactic
to use. You can't play it for
laughs, because it's not funny
enough; you can't play it for
drama because it's too dull; you
can't play it as a tragedy because
nothing of significance happens to
the main characters. If you have
to do it (why, why?) you are best
off just putting it on the stage,
have the actors move around in
some reasonable way, concentrate
on those isolated scenes that seem
to have a structure, and hope
someone in the audience will find
something meaningful in it.
Some of the window dressing is
really very nice. The abstract set
by Wendell Cole is clean and
handsome, the costumes by
William Eddelman are
interestingly eclectic, and Mr.
Chioles has made good use of
projections, both pictures and
text, that help quite a bit in
cleaning up some of the confusion
inherent in the script.
The actors are generally quite
competent. Robin Breon is pretty
good as Troilus, son of King Priam
of Troy, and lover of Cressida.
He isn't quite strong enough in
some of his more dramatic scenes,

and it's hard to imagine him as a
warrior. His Greek rival Diomedes,
excellently played by Chris
Bennion, looks like he could eat
him for breakfast.
Adrienne Moloney is very good
as Cressida, the only female role
of substance in the play. She,
along with Dick Leonard as her
pimping uncle Pandarus, seem to
have the most fun with their
parts. Mr. Leonard's
interpretation is very interesting,
very quiet, and rather subtle.
In the program Mr. Chioles has
seen fit to include a four hundred
word essay explaining the play.
His final sentence is: "Hence the
theatre must alter its systemic
need for consistency to
encompass such a work as 'Troilus
and Cressida.' " Yes, John, it
certainly must, but I don't think
it will. It wouldn't be worth the
effort.
You can see this Elizabethan
classic in the Little Theater
through October 2 J.

By STEVEN UNGAR
The Speech and Drama
Department opened its 1 970-71
season Wednesday with a
resounding thud.
I don't understand what line of
reasoning led to the decision to
open the year with "Troilus and
Cressida," but it must surely have
been very interesting. In fact, if
you could develop it into a play,
it would probably be better than
"Troilus and Cressida."
"Troilus and Cressida" is poor
enough to suggest the idea that
Shakespeare may have written
Marlowe's plays. It is probably his
least-produced play, although that
honor might belong to "Titus
Andro nicus."

As far as we can tell, the play
premiered in 1602, and was an
immediate flop. The first
production we know of after
Shakespeare's death was
re-written version by John Dryden
in 1697. That, too, was a flop.
The next known production was
in Munich, in 1898.
With a record like that, one
must wonder just what kind of
death-wish pervades the Speech
and Drama Department. "TSroilus
and Cressida" was not ignored for
two hundred years because it was
mis-understood; U was well
understood: It's terrible.
I am not going to go into the
details of why I think "Troilus
and Cressida" is weak as a play, as
a piece of literature, as epic, as
comedy, as poetry, or as anything
else. Suffice it to say that even a
good production of this play is
doomed.
And the Drama Department
production is good. It is strong in
just about every area—acting,
directing, design. But it's fighting
an uphill battle. When the basic
material is poor, it is very, very
hard to make it look good.
Director John Chioles had the
hardest joy of all. His efforts to
let the play say something,
anything, are evident throughout
the performance. The play suffers
from little character development,
a desultory plot, and almost no
action. Mr. Chioles has tried to
make it somewhat contemporary,
or perhaps timeless is a better
word. If you make the sets and
costumes as non-specific as
possible, any Great TYuths that

may have lay hidden somewhere
in the text have a better chance of
leaking out. (Of course, for this to
work, they have to be there.)
It was probably the best tactic
to use. You can't play it for
laughs, because it's not funny
enough; you can't play it for
drama because it's too dull; you
can't play it as a tragedy because
nothing of significance happens to
the main characters. If you have
to do it (why, why?) you are best
off just putting it on the stage,
have the actors move around in
some reasonable way, concentrate
on those isolated scenes that seem
to have a structure, and hope
someone in the audience will find
something meaningful in it.
Some of the window dressing is
really very nice. The abstract set
by Wendell Cole is clean and
handsome, the costumes by
William Eddelman are
interestingly eclectic, and Mr.
Chioles has made good use of
projections, both pictures and
text, that help quite a bit in
cleaning up some of the confusion
inherent in the script.
The actors are generally quite
competent. Robin Breon is pretty
good as Troilus, son of King Priam
of Troy, and lover of Cressida.
He isn't quite strong enough in
some of his more dramatic scenes,

and it's hard to imagine him as a
warrior. His Greek rival Diomedes,
excellently played by Chris
Bennion, looks like he could eat
him for breakfast.
Adrienne Moloney is very good
as Cressida, the only female role
of substance in the play. She,
along with Dick Leonard as her
pimping uncle Pandarus, seem to
have the most fun with their
parts. Mr. Leonard's
interpretation is very interesting,
very quiet, and rather subtle.
In the program Mr. Chioles has
seen fit to include a four hundred
word essay explaining the play.
His final sentence is: "Hence the
theatre must alter its systemic
need for consistency to
encompass such a work as 'Troilus
and Cressida.' " Yes, John, it
certainly must, but I don't think
it will. It wouldn't be worth the
effort.

The Speech and Drama
Department opened its 1 970-71
season Wednesday with a
resounding thud.
I don't understand what line of
reasoning led to the decision to
open the year with "Troilus and
Cressida," but it must surely have
been very interesting. In fact, if
you could develop it into a play,
it would probably be better than
"Troilus and Cressida."
"Troilus and Cressida" is poor
enough to suggest the idea that
Shakespeare may have written
Marlowe's plays. It is probably his
least-produced play, although that
honor might belong to "Titus
Andro nicus."

As far as we can tell, the play
premiered in 1602, and was an
immediate flop. The first
production we know of after
Shakespeare's death was
re-written version by John Dryden
in 1697. That, too, was a flop.
The next known production was
in Munich, in 1898.
With a record like that, one
must wonder just what kind of
death-wish pervades the Speech
and Drama Department. "TSroilus
and Cressida" was not ignored for
two hundred years because it was
mis-understood; U was well
understood: It's terrible.
I am not going to go into the
details of why I think "Troilus
and Cressida" is weak as a play, as
a piece of literature, as epic, as
comedy, as poetry, or as anything
else. Suffice it to say that even a
good production of this play is
doomed.
And the Drama Department
production is good. It is strong in
just about every area—acting,
directing, design. But it's fighting
an uphill battle. When the basic
material is poor, it is very, very
hard to make it look good.
Director John Chioles had the
hardest joy of all. His efforts to
let the play say something,
anything, are evident throughout
the performance. The play suffers
from little character development,
a desultory plot, and almost no
action. Mr. Chioles has tried to
make it somewhat contemporary,
or perhaps timeless is a better
word. If you make the sets and
costumes as non-specific as
possible, any Great TYuths that

may have lay hidden somewhere
in the text have a better chance of
leaking out. (Of course, for this to
work, they have to be there.)
It was probably the best tactic
to use. You can't play it for
laughs, because it's not funny
enough; you can't play it for
drama because it's too dull; you
can't play it as a tragedy because
nothing of significance happens to
the main characters. If you have
to do it (why, why?) you are best
off just putting it on the stage,
have the actors move around in
some reasonable way, concentrate
on those isolated scenes that seem
to have a structure, and hope
someone in the audience will find
something meaningful in it.
Some of the window dressing is
really very nice. The abstract set
by Wendell Cole is clean and
handsome, the costumes by
William Eddelman are
interestingly eclectic, and Mr.
Chioles has made good use of
projections, both pictures and
text, that help quite a bit in
cleaning up some of the confusion
inherent in the script.
The actors are generally quite
competent. Robin Breon is pretty
good as Troilus, son of King Priam
of Troy, and lover of Cressida.
He isn't quite strong enough in
some of his more dramatic scenes,

and it's hard to imagine him as a
warrior. His Greek rival Diomedes,
excellently played by Chris
Bennion, looks like he could eat
him for breakfast.
Adrienne Moloney is very good
as Cressida, the only female role
of substance in the play. She,
along with Dick Leonard as her
pimping uncle Pandarus, seem to
have the most fun with their
parts. Mr. Leonard's
interpretation is very interesting,
very quiet, and rather subtle.
In the program Mr. Chioles has
seen fit to include a four hundred
word essay explaining the play.
His final sentence is: "Hence the
theatre must alter its systemic
need for consistency to
encompass such a work as 'Troilus
and Cressida.' " Yes, John, it
certainly must, but I don't think
it will. It wouldn't be worth the
effort.
You can see this Elizabethan
classic in the Little Theater
