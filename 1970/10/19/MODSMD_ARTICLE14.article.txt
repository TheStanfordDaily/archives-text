# Bard's 'Dream'
## 
### 
The new Shakespeare Company will perform A Midsummer
Night's Dream in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Tuesday Oct. 20 at
8:15. This Bay Area Theatre group, based in San Francisco, has been
performing around the Bay Area for more than three years under the
direction of Margrit Roma and Clarence Ricklefs. This interracial
Shakespearian group is guided and inspired by the passionate
conviction that live theatre can help change the climate of the
country.
The company describes why they feel Shakespeare is so relevant
to these times in these words: "Daily proximity to civil war,
brutality, ideological intolerance, conspiracy and its bloody
repression determined the life of Shakespeare's time. No wonder
that we today in the U.S. feel that only a Shakespeare can find
words to express the horror of our age—senseless wars, the bombing
and burning of children in foreign lands; at home assassinations, the
repression and persecution of people with different skins, black,
brown, red, yellow; violence giving birth to more violence.
The Black Student Union and the Stanford Community Against
War and Fascism are sponsoring this performance in the hope that
through this artistic medium some of the problems of our times can
be put into sharper focus. The New Shakespeare Company has
informed us that they intend to donate their honorarium to the
Bobby Seale Defense Fund.
"Midsummer Night's Dream" is playing this Tuesday night at
8:15 at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Tickets are available at the door,
student tickets $ 1.5 0, general, $ 2.5 0.
