# Plunkett Tops All
## 'Defenseless' Cougs Ripped 
### FRED LEESON 
SPOKANE — Jody Graves sat in
Spokane's airport Saturday
evening and asked, without
condescension, "Why can't a
football team throw in the towel
like a boxer?"
What happened, you see, is the
Indians made the big play right at
the start. Then they made
another, and another and
another.. .
First Jack Schultz ran a pass
interception 46 yards for a
touchdown. Then Jim Plunkett
ran 39 yards for a score, tossed
five yards to Hillary Shockley for
another touchdown, then 9 6
yards to Randy Vataha for
another.
Then Jackie Brown raced 66
yards to score and Eric Cross went
25 yards—breaking a tackle by a
drunk fan—for another.
And there was a 51 yard gain
by Reggie Sanderson, a 70 yard
pass play from Jesse Freitas to
Jim Kehl—not to mention two
Sanderson touchdowns from one
and three yards and another one
yarder by Kehl.
Add a field goal and a few
extra points and Stanford had
won 63-16 and quarterback
Plunkett had accounted for more
total offense yardage than any
other major college player in
history.
The Record
It was fitting the play that gave
him the record was the 96 yard
pass to Vataha. Stanford had
recovered a fumble on its one, and
Plunkett backtracked to his
endzone and fired a long spiral
into the autumn sun.
Vataha pulled it in 5 5 yards
from where it was thrown and
carried it the final 5 0 , completing
the longest scoring pass in
Stanford history.
"I saw him running all the
way," Jim said afterward. "That
really turns you on."
Plunkett completed 10 of 14
passes for 22 4 yards and added 51
more on the ground, 39 on his
free-lance scoring run.
The day's other extraordinary
play was the 25 yard run by Cross
during which a spectator leaped
from the stands and attempted to
tackle Eric on the WSU two.
"I didn't know whether to run
over him or dodge him or what,"
Cross said. "First I figured I'd go
around him."

Eric had eluded a number of
Cougar tacklers before
confronting this additional
adversary. "Then 1 decided to hit
him."
Cross ran over him for the
touchdown and the frustrated
tackier was escorted away to be
booked by Spokane police.
Statistics reflect the liberties
Stanford took with the Cougar
defense: 337 yards passing, 321
yards rushing for 65 8 total yards
and an average gain of 9.2 yards
for every play.
Stanford failed to score only
three times when it had the ball.
Steve Murray's only punt went 4 9
yards, the Cougars picked off one
Freitas pass and the Cards lost the
ball once on downs.
The first-team offense played
hardly half the game and Freitas
took over the rest of the way,
completing five of 12 passes for
113 yards.
Jackie Brown, playing before
friends who came from his
Yakima home, carried just once in
the second half and raced
untouched for his 66 yard
touchdown.

Reggie Sanderson led reserve
rushers with 7 6 yards, 51 coming
on one jaunt; Jim Merrill, who
was awarded the game ball, picked
up 38.
Another Record
Washington State drew a cheer
for setting one school record
during the game—giving up the
most points in one game in WSU's
7 4 year football history.
Cougar Coach Jim Sweeney
came into the Stanford dressing
room and told the Indians, "You
are a great team," and later said,
"Jim Plunkett is the best college
football player I've ever seen."
He didn't have much else to
say.
Meanwhile Coach John Ralston
was worried about a knee injury
to Tim McClure and told his
players they would have to
prepare for UCLA next week
much the way they got ready for
use.
The Rose Bowl? "1 have
nothing to say about it. We're
thinking about UCLA next
week."

A SIMPLE CEREMONY .. . Jim Plunkett receives the football with
which he broke the NCAA career total offense record from an official
(blocked by newsman) after throwing a 96 yard touchdown pass in
Spokane. The Stanford senior now has 6630 total yards, surpassing
the old 6569 mark held by Steve Ramsey of North Texas State. "I'm
glad it came," he said of the record. "It felt good." At left, Jim
catches his breath on the sideline after his 39 yard touchdown run
which preceeded his record-breaking pass. He ran for 51 yards against
Washington State, giving him 275 total yards while playing only half
the game.

tackle Eric on the WSU two.
"I didn't know whether to run
over him or dodge him or what,"
Cross said. "First I figured I'd go
around him."

Eric had eluded a number of
Cougar tacklers before
confronting this additional
adversary. "Then 1 decided to hit
him."
Cross ran over him for the
touchdown and the frustrated
tackier was escorted away to be
booked by Spokane police.
Statistics reflect the liberties
Stanford took with the Cougar
defense: 337 yards passing, 321
yards rushing for 65 8 total yards
and an average gain of 9.2 yards
for every play.
Stanford failed to score only
three times when it had the ball.
Steve Murray's only punt went 4 9
yards, the Cougars picked off one
Freitas pass and the Cards lost the
ball once on downs.
The first-team offense played
hardly half the game and Freitas
took over the rest of the way,
completing five of 12 passes for
113 yards.
Jackie Brown, playing before
friends who came from his
Yakima home, carried just once in
the second half and raced
untouched for his 66 yard
touchdown.

Reggie Sanderson led reserve
rushers with 7 6 yards, 51 coming
on one jaunt; Jim Merrill, who
was awarded the game ball, picked
up 38.
Another Record
Washington State drew a cheer
for setting one school record
during the game—giving up the
most points in one game in WSU's
7 4 year football history.
Cougar Coach Jim Sweeney
came into the Stanford dressing
room and told the Indians, "You
are a great team," and later said,
"Jim Plunkett is the best college
football player I've ever seen."
He didn't have much else to
say.
Meanwhile Coach John Ralston
was worried about a knee injury
to Tim McClure and told his
players they would have to
prepare for UCLA next week
much the way they got ready for
use.
The Rose Bowl? "1 have
nothing to say about it. We're
thinking about UCLA next
week."

A SIMPLE CEREMONY .. . Jim Plunkett receives the football with
which he broke the NCAA career total offense record from an official
(blocked by newsman) after throwing a 96 yard touchdown pass in
Spokane. The Stanford senior now has 6630 total yards, surpassing
the old 6569 mark held by Steve Ramsey of North Texas State. "I'm
glad it came," he said of the record. "It felt good." At left, Jim
catches his breath on the sideline after his 39 yard touchdown run
which preceeded his record-breaking pass. He ran for 51 yards against
Washington State, giving him 275 total yards while playing only half
the game.
SPOKANE — Jody Graves sat in
Spokane's airport Saturday
evening and asked, without
condescension, "Why can't a
football team throw in the towel
like a boxer?"
What happened, you see, is the
Indians made the big play right at
the start. Then they made
another, and another and
another.. .
First Jack Schultz ran a pass
interception 46 yards for a
touchdown. Then Jim Plunkett
ran 39 yards for a score, tossed
five yards to Hillary Shockley for
another touchdown, then 9 6
yards to Randy Vataha for
another.
Then Jackie Brown raced 66
yards to score and Eric Cross went
25 yards—breaking a tackle by a
drunk fan—for another.
And there was a 51 yard gain
by Reggie Sanderson, a 70 yard
pass play from Jesse Freitas to
Jim Kehl—not to mention two
Sanderson touchdowns from one
and three yards and another one
yarder by Kehl.
Add a field goal and a few
extra points and Stanford had
won 63-16 and quarterback
Plunkett had accounted for more
total offense yardage than any
other major college player in
history.
The Record
It was fitting the play that gave
him the record was the 96 yard
pass to Vataha. Stanford had
recovered a fumble on its one, and
Plunkett backtracked to his
endzone and fired a long spiral
into the autumn sun.
Vataha pulled it in 5 5 yards
from where it was thrown and
carried it the final 5 0 , completing
the longest scoring pass in
Stanford history.
"I saw him running all the
way," Jim said afterward. "That
really turns you on."
Plunkett completed 10 of 14
passes for 22 4 yards and added 51
more on the ground, 39 on his
free-lance scoring run.
The day's other extraordinary
play was the 25 yard run by Cross
during which a spectator leaped
from the stands and attempted to
tackle Eric on the WSU two.
"I didn't know whether to run
over him or dodge him or what,"

A SIMPLE CEREMONY .. . Jim Plunkett receives the football with
which he broke the NCAA career total offense record from an official
(blocked by newsman) after throwing a 96 yard touchdown pass in
Spokane. The Stanford senior now has 6630 total yards, surpassing
the old 6569 mark held by Steve Ramsey of North Texas State. "I'm
glad it came," he said of the record. "It felt good." At left, Jim
catches his breath on the sideline after his 39 yard touchdown run
which preceeded his record-breaking pass. He ran for 51 yards against
Washington State, giving him 275 total yards while playing only half
the game.
SPOKANE — Jody Graves sat in
Spokane's airport Saturday
evening and asked, without
condescension, "Why can't a
football team throw in the towel
like a boxer?"
What happened, you see, is the
Indians made the big play right at
the start. Then they made
another, and another and
another.. .
First Jack Schultz ran a pass
interception 46 yards for a
touchdown. Then Jim Plunkett
ran 39 yards for a score, tossed
five yards to Hillary Shockley for
another touchdown, then 9 6
yards to Randy Vataha for
another.
Then Jackie Brown raced 66
yards to score and Eric Cross went
25 yards—breaking a tackle by a
drunk fan—for another.
And there was a 51 yard gain
by Reggie Sanderson, a 70 yard
pass play from Jesse Freitas to
Jim Kehl—not to mention two
Sanderson touchdowns from one
and three yards and another one
yarder by Kehl.
Add a field goal and a few
extra points and Stanford had
won 63-16 and quarterback
Plunkett had accounted for more
total offense yardage than any
other major college player in
history.
The Record
It was fitting the play that gave
him the record was the 96 yard
pass to Vataha. Stanford had
recovered a fumble on its one, and
Plunkett backtracked to his
endzone and fired a long spiral
into the autumn sun.
Vataha pulled it in 5 5 yards
from where it was thrown and
carried it the final 5 0 , completing
the longest scoring pass in
Stanford history.
"I saw him running all the
way," Jim said afterward. "That
really turns you on."
Plunkett completed 10 of 14
passes for 22 4 yards and added 51
more on the ground, 39 on his
free-lance scoring run.
The day's other extraordinary
play was the 25 yard run by Cross
during which a spectator leaped
from the stands and attempted to
tackle Eric on the WSU two.
"I didn't know whether to run
over him or dodge him or what,"
Cross said. "First I figured I'd go
around him."

Eric had eluded a number of
Cougar tacklers before
confronting this additional
adversary. "Then 1 decided to hit
him."
Cross ran over him for the
touchdown and the frustrated
tackier was escorted away to be
booked by Spokane police.
Statistics reflect the liberties
Stanford took with the Cougar
defense: 337 yards passing, 321
yards rushing for 65 8 total yards
and an average gain of 9.2 yards
for every play.
Stanford failed to score only
three times when it had the ball.
Steve Murray's only punt went 4 9
yards, the Cougars picked off one
Freitas pass and the Cards lost the
ball once on downs.
The first-team offense played
hardly half the game and Freitas
took over the rest of the way,
completing five of 12 passes for
113 yards.
Jackie Brown, playing before
friends who came from his
Yakima home, carried just once in
the second half and raced
untouched for his 66 yard
touchdown.

Reggie Sanderson led reserve
rushers with 7 6 yards, 51 coming
on one jaunt; Jim Merrill, who
was awarded the game ball, picked
up 38.
Another Record
Washington State drew a cheer
for setting one school record
during the game—giving up the
most points in one game in WSU's
7 4 year football history.
Cougar Coach Jim Sweeney
came into the Stanford dressing
room and told the Indians, "You
are a great team," and later said,
"Jim Plunkett is the best college
football player I've ever seen."
He didn't have much else to
say.
Meanwhile Coach John Ralston
was worried about a knee injury
to Tim McClure and told his
players they would have to
prepare for UCLA next week
much the way they got ready for
use.
The Rose Bowl? "1 have
nothing to say about it. We're
thinking about UCLA next
week."
