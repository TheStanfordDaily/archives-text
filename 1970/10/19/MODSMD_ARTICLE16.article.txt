# Stanford Poloists Split Pair
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
Stanford's water polo team
suffered its second defeat Friday,
this time at the hands of a very
experienced UCLA squad. The
score was 10-6.
Stanford played well
offensively, getting several good
scoring opportunities. However,
the Indians' shooting was
inaccurate and when they did get
a good shot the UCLA goalie,
Kevin Craig, came up with the
stop.
Craig, a sophomore, was first
string All-America goalie at UCLA
last year as a freshman, and was
Ail-America high school goalie as
a junior and senior.
Rick Sick
Rick Massimino, considered
Stanford's most "physical" player
as well as its primary scoring
threat, played almost the whole
game with a temperature of 101
degrees and suffered a cut near his
left eye with six minutes left in
the second quarter and the score
tied 2-2.
Up to that point the game had
been close with Bill Simpkins
scoring two first-quarter goals to
lead the aggressive Stanford
attack.
After Massimino's short
departure because of the injury,
the UCLAns scored three quick
goals to take a 5-2 lead. UCLA's
Greg Arth scored on a mid-pool
shot which goalie Peter Gadd
couldn't handle.
Down 6-4 in the third quarter
after Simpkins scored his third
goal the Bruins surged back with
four goals in four minutes.
The Bruins' drive was aided by
Stanford's fumbling offensive
passing attack and a leaky defense
inside the four yard line.
Massimino scored his only goal
with two minutes left on a
penalty shot, making the final
score 10-5.
Tenth Win
The Indians bounced back
Saturday morning with a strong
performance and romped over
DeAnza Junior College, 10-7.
Massimino did not play but the
rest of the Tribe played well.
Simpkins, Mike Davis and Mike
Collins were the standouts.
The Cards passed well and
capitalized on several fast breaks.

By the fourth quarter the reserves
were playing.
The defense also played well as
their opponents found it difficult
to penetrate and had to rely on
fast breaks and penalty shots.
Stanford's record is now 10-2.

The Cards passed well and
capitalized on several fast breaks.

By the fourth quarter the reserves
were playing.
The defense also played well as
their opponents found it difficult
to penetrate and had to rely on
fast breaks and penalty shots.
Stanford's record is now 10-2.

LINE UP: Stanford and UCLA water polo players get set for action
Friday afternoon. The Indians stayed with the defending national
champs for half the game, then saw the Bruins pull away For a 10-5
win.
Stanford's water polo team
suffered its second defeat Friday,
this time at the hands of a very
experienced UCLA squad. The
score was 10-6.
Stanford played well
offensively, getting several good
scoring opportunities. However,
the Indians' shooting was
inaccurate and when they did get
a good shot the UCLA goalie,
Kevin Craig, came up with the
stop.
Craig, a sophomore, was first
string All-America goalie at UCLA
last year as a freshman, and was
Ail-America high school goalie as
a junior and senior.
Rick Sick
Rick Massimino, considered
Stanford's most "physical" player
as well as its primary scoring
threat, played almost the whole
game with a temperature of 101
degrees and suffered a cut near his
left eye with six minutes left in
the second quarter and the score
tied 2-2.
Up to that point the game had
been close with Bill Simpkins
scoring two first-quarter goals to
lead the aggressive Stanford
attack.
After Massimino's short
departure because of the injury,
the UCLAns scored three quick
goals to take a 5-2 lead. UCLA's
Greg Arth scored on a mid-pool
shot which goalie Peter Gadd
couldn't handle.
Down 6-4 in the third quarter
after Simpkins scored his third
goal the Bruins surged back with
four goals in four minutes.
The Bruins' drive was aided by
Stanford's fumbling offensive
passing attack and a leaky defense
inside the four yard line.
Massimino scored his only goal
with two minutes left on a
penalty shot, making the final
score 10-5.
Tenth Win
The Indians bounced back
Saturday morning with a strong
performance and romped over
DeAnza Junior College, 10-7.
Massimino did not play but the
rest of the Tribe played well.
Simpkins, Mike Davis and Mike
Collins were the standouts.
