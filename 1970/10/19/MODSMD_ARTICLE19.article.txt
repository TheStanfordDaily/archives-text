Reagan Faces Nation
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Reagan defended his record
against campus violence Sunday while his Democratic
foe, Jess Unruh, argued "I'm more a tough liner,
a hardliner" on campus unrest than Reagan.
The two made separately taped, tandom
appearances on a nationally televised news interview,
"Face the Nation," on CBS.
In Sunday's interview, Unruh complained that
"the conventional wisdom of the press" insists on
labeling him as a liberal—something Unruh said puts
"a pretty big millstone around my neck."
"I think I'm more a tough liner, a hardliner on
campus dissent that the governor is. I was supporting
throwing those people off campus before he was even
elected," Unruh said. "But that doesn't come through
because people insist on talking about conservatives
and liberals."
Reagan accepted being labeled as a
conservative—"in the sense that the word conservative
is used these days."
Reagan said he thought his administration has
been most effective in the area of controlling violent
crime and violence on campus.
"It was not true that 1 campaigned in 1 96 6 on the
basis that I would solve all those problems," he said.
Reagan said his argument then was that the
previous Democratic administration was not doing
anything about crime and campus trouble "and we
did stop appeasing and start opposing in the area of
campus violence."
Unruh became irked when the questioning of him
dealt heavily with Reagan's 16-point lead in public
opinions polls, defections by big Democratic
contributors and Reagan's smooth appearance on
television.
He could only win, he replied, "if you would start
asking me questions about the condition of welfare in
this state . . . about taxes . . . about unemployment."
B-52 Bombing Extended
SAIGON — American B-5 2 bombers extended their
raids on North Vietnamese supply routes from Laos
into Cambodia for the first time in more than a week,
the U.S. Command announced Sunday. Enemy forces
concentrated on the allies' pacification and
Vietnamization programs in South Vietnam.

Communiques covering a 2 4-hour period reported
at least four Americans and eight South Vietnamese
killed and 2 5 Americans and 66 Vietnamese wounded
in an ambush, a terrorist attack and 14 rocket and
mortar attacks. Fourteen enemy were reported killed.
The American casualties included troops of the
2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, which is being
deactivated as part of President Nixon's 40,000-man
cutback to be completed by the Christmas season.
The American infantrymen came under a mortar
attack in the Central Highlands 14 miles northeast of
An Khe.
A U.S. Command communique said the 852
stratofortresses, America's largest warplanes, hit in
Laos and Cambodia Saturday. They were joined by
smaller tactical fighter-bombers.
A spokesman said the Cambodian raids were the
first there since Oct. 8.
'Strike Back 9 —Nixon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is expected to
renew his call to the silent majority to strike back at
dissidents and radicals at the ballot box when he hits
the campaign trail again Monday on behalf of
Republican candidates.
The President set the theme for his role in the
closing weeks of the campaign during a whirlwind
15-hour barnstorming tour Saturday into Vermont,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
He urged "the great majority" to reject with their
votes the rock-throwing and obscenity shouting
tactics of a small minority.
"One vote is worth one hundred obscene slogans,"
he told a crowd in Teterboro, N.J.
Monday Nixon sets out on a two-day campaign
trip into Ohio, North Dakota, Missouri, Tennessee,
North Carolina and Indiana in an effort to help GOP
candidates for Congress and governor.
Hijackers 9 Fate Unknown
ANKARA, Turkey — A Trabzon provincial court
refused Sunday to order the arrest of a Lithuanian
father and son who hijacked a Soviet airliner. The
court ruled provisionally that the crime was political.
That did not mean that Pranas Stasio Brazinskas
and his son Algedas went free, or that their request
for political asylum would be accepted by the
Turkish government.

"They are still under strict custody. They have
merely not been charged by the Trabzon court with
any crime," the officials Anatolia news agency
reported.
The court's action passed the case to the Justice
Minister. It will decide whether the crime was
political, and thus drop the case, or to hold that it
was not political and instruct the public prosecutor
what charges to file against the two.
That would return the matter to the courts for
final decision. If the courts again held that the crime
was politically motivated, the father and son would
go free. Article 9 of the Turkish criminal code says a
foreigner accused of foreign crimes with a political
motive will not be brought to trial or extradited.
The Soviet Union has demanded extradition of the
two, who hijacked an Aeroflot plane to Irabzon while
it was on a 100-mile flight Friday between two Soviet
cities on the east coast of the Black Sea. A hostess
was killed and three crew members were wounded.
If the father and son were set free, the government
would not be obliged to grant asylum. But the two
would not be extradited. They would be free to leave
Turkey and seek asylum elsewhere.
Agnew Security Increased
WASHINGTON — Measures to insure Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew's safety appear to have been
tightened in recent weeks in a climate of national
concern over violence.
Precautions include X-rays of baggage, a helicopter
cover for a motorcade and tight sealing off of
portions of buildings while he is in them.
There have been no incidents—but there was a
bomb threat, telephoned to a newspaper in
Jacksonville, Fla. No bomb was found in the
auditorium where Agnew appeared on schedule.
That the security precautions have extended to
other high administration officials was illustrated
during a Florida trip last week by Secretary of
Transportation John A. Volpe. A press aide to Rep. J.
Herbert Burke, R-Fla., told newsmen he could not
reveal at which airport in Fort Lauderdale Volpe
would land on a flight from Tampa.
"We are told it was for security reasons and we are
honoring it," said the press aide, Gene Curella. He
linked the precaution to the kidnapping of two
officials in Canada.

B-52 Bombing Extended
SAIGON — American B-5 2 bombers extended their
raids on North Vietnamese supply routes from Laos
into Cambodia for the first time in more than a week,
the U.S. Command announced Sunday. Enemy forces
concentrated on the allies' pacification and
Vietnamization programs in South Vietnam.

Communiques covering a 2 4-hour period reported
at least four Americans and eight South Vietnamese
killed and 2 5 Americans and 66 Vietnamese wounded
in an ambush, a terrorist attack and 14 rocket and
mortar attacks. Fourteen enemy were reported killed.
The American casualties included troops of the
2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, which is being
deactivated as part of President Nixon's 40,000-man
cutback to be completed by the Christmas season.
The American infantrymen came under a mortar
attack in the Central Highlands 14 miles northeast of
An Khe.
A U.S. Command communique said the 852
stratofortresses, America's largest warplanes, hit in
Laos and Cambodia Saturday. They were joined by
smaller tactical fighter-bombers.
A spokesman said the Cambodian raids were the
first there since Oct. 8.
'Strike Back 9 —Nixon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is expected to
renew his call to the silent majority to strike back at
dissidents and radicals at the ballot box when he hits
the campaign trail again Monday on behalf of
Republican candidates.
The President set the theme for his role in the
closing weeks of the campaign during a whirlwind
15-hour barnstorming tour Saturday into Vermont,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
He urged "the great majority" to reject with their
votes the rock-throwing and obscenity shouting
tactics of a small minority.
"One vote is worth one hundred obscene slogans,"
he told a crowd in Teterboro, N.J.
Monday Nixon sets out on a two-day campaign
trip into Ohio, North Dakota, Missouri, Tennessee,
North Carolina and Indiana in an effort to help GOP
candidates for Congress and governor.
Hijackers 9 Fate Unknown
ANKARA, Turkey — A Trabzon provincial court
refused Sunday to order the arrest of a Lithuanian
father and son who hijacked a Soviet airliner. The
court ruled provisionally that the crime was political.
That did not mean that Pranas Stasio Brazinskas
and his son Algedas went free, or that their request
for political asylum would be accepted by the
Turkish government.

"They are still under strict custody. They have
merely not been charged by the Trabzon court with
any crime," the officials Anatolia news agency
reported.
The court's action passed the case to the Justice
Minister. It will decide whether the crime was
political, and thus drop the case, or to hold that it
was not political and instruct the public prosecutor
what charges to file against the two.
That would return the matter to the courts for
final decision. If the courts again held that the crime
was politically motivated, the father and son would
go free. Article 9 of the Turkish criminal code says a
foreigner accused of foreign crimes with a political
motive will not be brought to trial or extradited.
The Soviet Union has demanded extradition of the
two, who hijacked an Aeroflot plane to Irabzon while
it was on a 100-mile flight Friday between two Soviet
cities on the east coast of the Black Sea. A hostess
was killed and three crew members were wounded.
If the father and son were set free, the government
would not be obliged to grant asylum. But the two
would not be extradited. They would be free to leave
Turkey and seek asylum elsewhere.
Agnew Security Increased
WASHINGTON — Measures to insure Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew's safety appear to have been
tightened in recent weeks in a climate of national
concern over violence.
Precautions include X-rays of baggage, a helicopter
cover for a motorcade and tight sealing off of
portions of buildings while he is in them.
There have been no incidents—but there was a
bomb threat, telephoned to a newspaper in
Jacksonville, Fla. No bomb was found in the
auditorium where Agnew appeared on schedule.
That the security precautions have extended to
other high administration officials was illustrated
during a Florida trip last week by Secretary of
Transportation John A. Volpe. A press aide to Rep. J.
Herbert Burke, R-Fla., told newsmen he could not
reveal at which airport in Fort Lauderdale Volpe
would land on a flight from Tampa.
"We are told it was for security reasons and we are
honoring it," said the press aide, Gene Curella. He
linked the precaution to the kidnapping of two
officials in Canada.
Reagan Faces Nation
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Reagan defended his record
against campus violence Sunday while his Democratic
foe, Jess Unruh, argued "I'm more a tough liner,

The two made separately taped, tandom
appearances on a nationally televised news interview,
"Face the Nation," on CBS.
In Sunday's interview, Unruh complained that
"the conventional wisdom of the press" insists on
labeling him as a liberal—something Unruh said puts
"a pretty big millstone around my neck."
"I think I'm more a tough liner, a hardliner on
campus dissent that the governor is. I was supporting
throwing those people off campus before he was even
elected," Unruh said. "But that doesn't come through
because people insist on talking about conservatives
and liberals."
Reagan accepted being labeled as a
conservative—"in the sense that the word conservative
is used these days."
Reagan said he thought his administration has

the U.S. Command announced Sunday. Enemy forces
concentrated on the allies' pacification and
Vietnamization programs in South Vietnam.

Communiques covering a 2 4-hour period reported
at least four Americans and eight South Vietnamese
killed and 2 5 Americans and 66 Vietnamese wounded
in an ambush, a terrorist attack and 14 rocket and
mortar attacks. Fourteen enemy were reported killed.
The American casualties included troops of the
2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, which is being
deactivated as part of President Nixon's 40,000-man
cutback to be completed by the Christmas season.
The American infantrymen came under a mortar
attack in the Central Highlands 14 miles northeast of
An Khe.
A U.S. Command communique said the 852
stratofortresses, America's largest warplanes, hit in
Laos and Cambodia Saturday. They were joined by
smaller tactical fighter-bombers.
A spokesman said the Cambodian raids were the
first there since Oct. 8.
'Strike Back 9 —Nixon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is expected to
renew his call to the silent majority to strike back at
dissidents and radicals at the ballot box when he hits
the campaign trail again Monday on behalf of
Republican candidates.
The President set the theme for his role in the
closing weeks of the campaign during a whirlwind
15-hour barnstorming tour Saturday into Vermont,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
He urged "the great majority" to reject with their
votes the rock-throwing and obscenity shouting
tactics of a small minority.
"One vote is worth one hundred obscene slogans,"
he told a crowd in Teterboro, N.J.
Monday Nixon sets out on a two-day campaign
trip into Ohio, North Dakota, Missouri, Tennessee,
North Carolina and Indiana in an effort to help GOP
candidates for Congress and governor.
Hijackers 9 Fate Unknown
ANKARA, Turkey — A Trabzon provincial court
refused Sunday to order the arrest of a Lithuanian
father and son who hijacked a Soviet airliner. The
court ruled provisionally that the crime was political.
That did not mean that Pranas Stasio Brazinskas
and his son Algedas went free, or that their request
for political asylum would be accepted by the
Turkish government.

"They are still under strict custody. They have
merely not been charged by the Trabzon court with
any crime," the officials Anatolia news agency
reported.
The court's action passed the case to the Justice
Minister. It will decide whether the crime was
political, and thus drop the case, or to hold that it
was not political and instruct the public prosecutor
what charges to file against the two.
That would return the matter to the courts for
final decision. If the courts again held that the crime
was politically motivated, the father and son would
go free. Article 9 of the Turkish criminal code says a
foreigner accused of foreign crimes with a political
motive will not be brought to trial or extradited.
The Soviet Union has demanded extradition of the
two, who hijacked an Aeroflot plane to Irabzon while
it was on a 100-mile flight Friday between two Soviet
cities on the east coast of the Black Sea. A hostess
was killed and three crew members were wounded.
If the father and son were set free, the government
would not be obliged to grant asylum. But the two
would not be extradited. They would be free to leave
Turkey and seek asylum elsewhere.
Agnew Security Increased
WASHINGTON — Measures to insure Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew's safety appear to have been
tightened in recent weeks in a climate of national
concern over violence.
Precautions include X-rays of baggage, a helicopter
cover for a motorcade and tight sealing off of
portions of buildings while he is in them.
There have been no incidents—but there was a
bomb threat, telephoned to a newspaper in
Jacksonville, Fla. No bomb was found in the
auditorium where Agnew appeared on schedule.
That the security precautions have extended to
other high administration officials was illustrated
during a Florida trip last week by Secretary of
Transportation John A. Volpe. A press aide to Rep. J.
Herbert Burke, R-Fla., told newsmen he could not
reveal at which airport in Fort Lauderdale Volpe
would land on a flight from Tampa.
"We are told it was for security reasons and we are
honoring it," said the press aide, Gene Curella. He
linked the precaution to the kidnapping of two
officials in Canada.
Reagan Faces Nation
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Reagan defended his record
against campus violence Sunday while his Democratic
foe, Jess Unruh, argued "I'm more a tough liner,
a hardliner" on campus unrest than Reagan.
The two made separately taped, tandom
appearances on a nationally televised news interview,
"Face the Nation," on CBS.
In Sunday's interview, Unruh complained that
"the conventional wisdom of the press" insists on
labeling him as a liberal—something Unruh said puts
"a pretty big millstone around my neck."
"I think I'm more a tough liner, a hardliner on
campus dissent that the governor is. I was supporting
throwing those people off campus before he was even
elected," Unruh said. "But that doesn't come through
because people insist on talking about conservatives
and liberals."
Reagan accepted being labeled as a
conservative—"in the sense that the word conservative
is used these days."
Reagan said he thought his administration has
been most effective in the area of controlling violent
crime and violence on campus.
"It was not true that 1 campaigned in 1 96 6 on the
basis that I would solve all those problems," he said.
Reagan said his argument then was that the
previous Democratic administration was not doing
anything about crime and campus trouble "and we
did stop appeasing and start opposing in the area of
campus violence."
Unruh became irked when the questioning of him
dealt heavily with Reagan's 16-point lead in public
opinions polls, defections by big Democratic
contributors and Reagan's smooth appearance on
television.
He could only win, he replied, "if you would start
asking me questions about the condition of welfare in
this state . . . about taxes . . . about unemployment."
