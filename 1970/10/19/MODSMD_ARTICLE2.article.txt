MONTREAL (AP) â€” Prime Minister
Pierre Elliott Trudeau predicted
Sunday night more terrorism from the
French-Canadian separatists who
kidnaped and killed provincial labor
minister Pierre Laporte. But he added
"these vicious men" would not shake
the Canadian will.
Terrorists of the Quebec Liberation
Front also were holding James R.
Cross, a British diplomat. Police said
they received a letter Sunday written
by Cross in which he said he was "still
alive and in good health."
"We must expect that these vicious
men may attempt again to shake our
will in the days ahead," Trudeau said in
a nationwide broadcast address. "I
speak for all of you when I say that any
such attempt shall fail."
Trudeau said the terrorists were
"beneath contempt."
"Those responsible for this crime
will be found and will be deal| with in
the calm and dispassionate atmosphere

of Canadian courts," the prime minister
said. "The FLQ has sown the seeds of
its own destruction. It has revealed that
it has no mandate but terror, no
policies but violence and no solutions
but murder."
Two Warrants Issued
Quebec provincial police issued late
Sunday an all-points bulletin naming
two men wanted for the kidnaping of
Laporte and Cross, British trade
commissioner in Montreal. Laporte was
found shot to death earlier in the day.
A police spokesman said warrants
have been issued charging Marc
Carbonneau, 37, and Paul Rose, 27,
with kidnaping in both cases.
Communiques from the kidnapers have
indicated two separate cells of the
Quebec Liberation Front were
operating independently in the
kidnapings, and there was no
immediate explanation why the two
men were charged together with both
abductions. Both men names in the
bulletin were described as French

speaking Canadians. Police said
Carbonneau was a taxi driver and Rose
a school teacher.
4 ln Cold Blood'
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre
Elliott Trudeau said the shooting of
Laporte, 49, was "conceived in cold
blood and executed in a like manner."
He expressed a "deep sense of shame"
that the killing had taken place in
Canada.
Police said the letter from Cross,
also 49, was found in a Montreal
church Sunday with a communique
from the front, known as FLQ, the
initials for its French name.
"I am still alive and in good health,"
the letter said in part.
"The only danger for my life is if
the police find out where I am and
want to intervene. The FLQ will not
give up and I will be the first dead.
FLQ Outlawed
"The authorities will never find the
place where I am held in captivity. I am
a prisoner like the FLQ members and
prisoners in jail."
The Trudeau government has in
effect outlawed the Liberation Front.
The killing reinforced its goal of
putting the organization's activists
behind bars. Nearly 300 persons have
been seized in the province, mostly in
the Montreal area, since the War
Measures Act went into effect early
Friday.
The events that led up to the
discovery of the body started with an
anonymous telephone call to radio
station CKAC at 7 p.m. Saturday that a
package could be found at St. Hubert
near the air base.
In a second call at 9:3U the caller
asked why nothing had been done
about the package. This time a station
employee went to the area and found a

hand-printed note in Place des Arts.
The note and a rough map indicated
where the car could be found.
The radio station notified the police,
who found a pale green Chevrolet, the
car used to kidnap Laporte. Police did
not search the car for fear that it was
booby-trapped. After an army bomb
squad was called in, the car was opened
and Laporte's body was found covered
with blood from the head wound.
