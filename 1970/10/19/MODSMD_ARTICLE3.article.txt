"The problem with the average
student in politics is that he tends to do
what makes him feel good and not
what gets results," claims Don Ayer,
president of the Young Republicans.
To bring this sobering influence to
campus politics, the YR's have hosted a
number of Republican headliners
including Sens. Hatfield, Percy, and

Last April, Don Ayer ran
unsuccessfully as a liberal anti-war

conservative, Jackson Booth, in a
