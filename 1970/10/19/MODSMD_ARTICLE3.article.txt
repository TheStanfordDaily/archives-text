# YR's Fight Traditional Image
## 
### SALLY GEISLER 
"The problem with the average
student in politics is that he tends to do
what makes him feel good and not
what gets results," claims Don Ayer,
president of the Young Republicans.
To bring this sobering influence to
campus politics, the YR's have hosted a
number of Republican headliners
including Sens. Hatfield, Percy, and
Scott, but the group has trouble
shaking its staid, conservative
reputation.
Says Ayer, "Our organization is
fighting the traditional Republican
image. In fact, we offer no
rubber-stamp support of Republican
candidates."
month, the officers endorsed
Wilson Riles, a Democrat, over Max

Rafferty, a conservative Republican,
for California state school
superintendent. Ayer and the other
leaders feel that Rafferty is a
"politician out of the nineteenth
century." Their vote of confidence in
Riles was as much as rejection of
Rafferty's extreme conservatism as an
endorsement of Rile's progressive
leadership.
The YR Past
The Young Republicans were not
always so ideologically receptive, as
their reputation will testify. Although
there are conservatives in the group,
they no longer dominate it.
Roman Buhler, who was defeated by
conservative Roger Reed for YR
president last winter, commented,
"When I joined the YR's in 1968 with

the expressed intention ol making the
group more liberal, I was viewed with
suspicion. Ironically, when I ran for
president, the club was moving left."
Reed eventually resigned under what
he called "liberal harassment" within
the group. Buhler said, "It's too bad
that some progressive YR's acquired a
conservative reputation while reforming
the club, but I think the change was
worth the effort."
The YR's And 'Moderation'
Last April, Don Ayer ran
unsuccessfully as a liberal anti-war
candidate for president of the
California Young Republicans;
subsequently, in May, he defeated a
conservative, Jackson Booth, in a
hard-fought election for the Stanford
YR president.
The Young Republicans are strong
advocates of "moderation." The
members do not accept militant
disruption as a tactic, and they
maintain that they can accomplish
concrete political change by remaining
within the present political framework
Violent Confrontations
Public relations chairman Bill Bell
stated: "Violent confrontations of this
decade have usually made the system
more enclosed and inflexible."
Said Ayer, "the students do have the
potential to do something constructive
if they can avoid the simplistic view of
the world crisis—that is, to refrain from
believing that all issues are only black
and white, being contested by
good-guys, the intelligensia, against the
bad guys, all politicians."
He cited the turmoil of last spring as
a prime example of this
"Armegeddon-type view."
Student Image
Because of their conservative image,
the group finds a lack of willingness on
the part of many students to discuss
controversial issues.
Too often this "Republicans aren't
cool" generalization alienates students
who are interested in politics but find
the moderate view unpopular. Ayer
feels that many students who would
support the group will not become
involved because "they can't get past
the name."
Commenting on radicals. Ayer said,
"Extremists seem to feel that their grasp
of political reality is complete and
accurate, and respond with paranoid
disdain to anyone whose analysis is
slightly different."
The Other People
Remarked Ayer, "What militant
groups seem to ignore is the fact that
other people in the world are just as
sincere, intelligent, and a good deal
more humble than themselves." The

YR's feel that this "cocky closed
mindedness" must be overcome before
any changes can be made in the
political system.
Referring to the present political
scene, Ayer said, "Some of the
members support the Vice President
with his fiery rhetoric—then there are
the rest of us."
Since the group has not officially
endorsed any of this fall's candidates,
each YR is free to work individually in
any of the campaigns. As a result, no
rigid policies are set by the group, and
the members shy away from any kind
of group criteria.
Buhler commented, "We see our
party as a tool, and not a confining
doctrine. We are Republicans because
we find greater opportunities for
national change through that party
affiliation.
"We are not effete snobs," stated
Ayer. "We feel that the most efficient
and least intimidating method to
modify the system we all want to
change is through this democratic
ground work. It will change and we will
do it."

affiliation.
"We are not effete snobs," stated
Ayer. "We feel that the most efficient
and least intimidating method to
modify the system we all want to
change is through this democratic
ground work. It will change and we will
do it."

"The problem with the average
student in politics is that he tends to do
what makes him feel good and not
what gets results," claims Don Ayer,
president of the Young Republicans.
To bring this sobering influence to
campus politics, the YR's have hosted a
number of Republican headliners
including Sens. Hatfield, Percy, and
Scott, but the group has trouble
shaking its staid, conservative
reputation.
Says Ayer, "Our organization is
fighting the traditional Republican
image. In fact, we offer no
rubber-stamp support of Republican
candidates."
month, the officers endorsed
Wilson Riles, a Democrat, over Max

Rafferty, a conservative Republican,
for California state school
superintendent. Ayer and the other
leaders feel that Rafferty is a
"politician out of the nineteenth
century." Their vote of confidence in
Riles was as much as rejection of
Rafferty's extreme conservatism as an
endorsement of Rile's progressive
leadership.
The YR Past
The Young Republicans were not
always so ideologically receptive, as
their reputation will testify. Although
there are conservatives in the group,
they no longer dominate it.
Roman Buhler, who was defeated by
conservative Roger Reed for YR
president last winter, commented,
"When I joined the YR's in 1968 with

the expressed intention ol making the
group more liberal, I was viewed with
suspicion. Ironically, when I ran for
president, the club was moving left."
Reed eventually resigned under what
he called "liberal harassment" within
the group. Buhler said, "It's too bad
that some progressive YR's acquired a
conservative reputation while reforming
the club, but I think the change was
worth the effort."
The YR's And 'Moderation'
Last April, Don Ayer ran
unsuccessfully as a liberal anti-war
candidate for president of the
California Young Republicans;
subsequently, in May, he defeated a
conservative, Jackson Booth, in a
hard-fought election for the Stanford
YR president.
The Young Republicans are strong
advocates of "moderation." The
members do not accept militant
disruption as a tactic, and they
maintain that they can accomplish
concrete political change by remaining
within the present political framework
Violent Confrontations
Public relations chairman Bill Bell
stated: "Violent confrontations of this
decade have usually made the system
more enclosed and inflexible."
Said Ayer, "the students do have the
potential to do something constructive
if they can avoid the simplistic view of
the world crisis—that is, to refrain from
believing that all issues are only black
and white, being contested by
good-guys, the intelligensia, against the
bad guys, all politicians."
He cited the turmoil of last spring as
a prime example of this
"Armegeddon-type view."
Student Image
Because of their conservative image,
the group finds a lack of willingness on
the part of many students to discuss
controversial issues.
Too often this "Republicans aren't
cool" generalization alienates students
who are interested in politics but find
the moderate view unpopular. Ayer
feels that many students who would
support the group will not become
involved because "they can't get past
the name."
Commenting on radicals. Ayer said,
"Extremists seem to feel that their grasp
of political reality is complete and
accurate, and respond with paranoid
disdain to anyone whose analysis is
slightly different."
The Other People
Remarked Ayer, "What militant
groups seem to ignore is the fact that
other people in the world are just as
sincere, intelligent, and a good deal
more humble than themselves." The

YR's feel that this "cocky closed
mindedness" must be overcome before
any changes can be made in the
political system.
Referring to the present political
scene, Ayer said, "Some of the
members support the Vice President
with his fiery rhetoric—then there are
the rest of us."
Since the group has not officially
endorsed any of this fall's candidates,
each YR is free to work individually in
any of the campaigns. As a result, no
rigid policies are set by the group, and
the members shy away from any kind
of group criteria.
Buhler commented, "We see our
party as a tool, and not a confining
doctrine. We are Republicans because
we find greater opportunities for
national change through that party
affiliation.
"We are not effete snobs," stated
Ayer. "We feel that the most efficient
and least intimidating method to

Buhler commented, "We see our
party as a tool, and not a confining
doctrine. We are Republicans because
we find greater opportunities for
national change through that party
affiliation.
"We are not effete snobs," stated
Ayer. "We feel that the most efficient
and least intimidating method to
modify the system we all want to
change is through this democratic
ground work. It will change and we will
do it."

"The problem with the average
student in politics is that he tends to do
what makes him feel good and not
what gets results," claims Don Ayer,
president of the Young Republicans.
To bring this sobering influence to
campus politics, the YR's have hosted a
number of Republican headliners
including Sens. Hatfield, Percy, and
Scott, but the group has trouble
shaking its staid, conservative
reputation.
Says Ayer, "Our organization is
fighting the traditional Republican
image. In fact, we offer no
rubber-stamp support of Republican
candidates."
month, the officers endorsed
Wilson Riles, a Democrat, over Max

Rafferty, a conservative Republican,
for California state school
superintendent. Ayer and the other
leaders feel that Rafferty is a
"politician out of the nineteenth
century." Their vote of confidence in
Riles was as much as rejection of
Rafferty's extreme conservatism as an
endorsement of Rile's progressive
leadership.
The YR Past
The Young Republicans were not
always so ideologically receptive, as
their reputation will testify. Although
there are conservatives in the group,
they no longer dominate it.
Roman Buhler, who was defeated by
conservative Roger Reed for YR
president last winter, commented,
"When I joined the YR's in 1968 with

the expressed intention ol making the
group more liberal, I was viewed with
suspicion. Ironically, when I ran for
president, the club was moving left."
Reed eventually resigned under what
he called "liberal harassment" within
the group. Buhler said, "It's too bad
that some progressive YR's acquired a
conservative reputation while reforming
the club, but I think the change was
worth the effort."
The YR's And 'Moderation'
Last April, Don Ayer ran
unsuccessfully as a liberal anti-war
candidate for president of the
California Young Republicans;
subsequently, in May, he defeated a
conservative, Jackson Booth, in a
hard-fought election for the Stanford
YR president.
The Young Republicans are strong
advocates of "moderation." The
members do not accept militant
disruption as a tactic, and they
maintain that they can accomplish
concrete political change by remaining
within the present political framework
Violent Confrontations
Public relations chairman Bill Bell
stated: "Violent confrontations of this
decade have usually made the system
more enclosed and inflexible."
Said Ayer, "the students do have the
potential to do something constructive
if they can avoid the simplistic view of
the world crisis—that is, to refrain from
believing that all issues are only black
and white, being contested by
good-guys, the intelligensia, against the
bad guys, all politicians."
He cited the turmoil of last spring as
a prime example of this
"Armegeddon-type view."
Student Image
Because of their conservative image,
the group finds a lack of willingness on
the part of many students to discuss
controversial issues.
Too often this "Republicans aren't
cool" generalization alienates students
who are interested in politics but find
the moderate view unpopular. Ayer
feels that many students who would
support the group will not become
involved because "they can't get past
the name."
Commenting on radicals. Ayer said,
"Extremists seem to feel that their grasp
of political reality is complete and
accurate, and respond with paranoid
disdain to anyone whose analysis is
slightly different."
The Other People
Remarked Ayer, "What militant
groups seem to ignore is the fact that
other people in the world are just as
sincere, intelligent, and a good deal
more humble than themselves." The

YR's feel that this "cocky closed
mindedness" must be overcome before
any changes can be made in the
political system.
Referring to the present political
scene, Ayer said, "Some of the
members support the Vice President
with his fiery rhetoric—then there are
the rest of us."
Since the group has not officially
endorsed any of this fall's candidates,
each YR is free to work individually in
any of the campaigns. As a result, no
rigid policies are set by the group, and
the members shy away from any kind
of group criteria.
Buhler commented, "We see our
party as a tool, and not a confining
doctrine. We are Republicans because
we find greater opportunities for
national change through that party
affiliation.
"We are not effete snobs," stated
Ayer. "We feel that the most efficient
and least intimidating method to
modify the system we all want to
change is through this democratic
ground work. It will change and we will
do it."
