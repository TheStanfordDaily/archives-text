# More Students Need Aid
## Money For Scholarships Drying Up 
### 
According to its director, the Financial Aids Office is
currently caught in a serious double bind: the number of
students who need aid is increasing just as the sources of aid
are drying up.
This year 39.5 percent of the undergraduate student
body is receiving financial aid, a substantial increase over
the 1960 figure of 26 percent. As the tuition, room and
board costs continue to increase over the next few years the
office assumes that more and more students will require
increasing amounts of aid.
Robert Huff, director of the Financial Aids Office, said
that a student's eligibility is figured on the basis of a
formula derived by the College Scholarship Service, a
division of the College Board (Educational Testing Service.)
The formula takes into account the parents' income, minus
additional expenses caused by other children, illness, debts,
etc. The amount that the parents are able to contribute is
then determined.
This expected contribution is weighed against the cost of
attending the University, which is currently figured at
$4110 annually. This amount includes tuition, room and
board, transportation, books, and personal expenses. If
there is a discrepancy between the money that the parents
and student can be expected to contribute and the cost of
attending school, this amount is given to the student in the
form of a gift, a loan, or a work-study program.
The first $1000 of aid is given to the student in the form
of "self-help"; that is, either a loan or a job. The student
generally has a choice between these two forms of aid. Any
additional need is covered by an outright gift.
Support Dropping
About three percent of this year's freshman class are on
"sponsored projects"; they either are supported by
corporations or by private foundations. A critical problem
for the Financial Aids Office is that both foundations and
corporations seem to be pulling out of scholarship
programs, under the assumption that federal programs are
coping with the growing need for scholarships.
Federal contributions to the scholarship program,
however, have reached a plateau, at least for the immediate
future. In fact, the amount of federal aid intended for
scholarships declined by $100,000 during the last year.
Federal programs increasingly are geared to students from
low income homes with incomes under $1 0,000, and only a
small number of Stanford students requiring aid fit into this
category.
As a result of the widespread cut-back in federal funds
and private donations, the University must now provide 38
percent of all scholarship money from its general operating
funds. A few yearsago.it provided only 22 percent.
Federal Increase Asked
Huff, the director of the Financial Aids Office, reports
that he is now spending almost .ill his time trying to obtain
more money from outside sources for scholarships. He is

currently requesting an additional $5 00,000 for
scholarships next year from the federal government,
although he does not expect to receive this much in
additional funding.
With most private donors, Huff feels that an important
element for continued support is individual donor-recipient
contact. He urged all students who are receiving this type of
aid to stay in touch with their donor.
Aid for minority group students is handled in much the
say way as that for other students, with one important
exception: minority students are not expected to
contribute $1 000 in "self help" during their freshmen year.
Beginning in their sophomore year, however, they must
either take out loans or work for this amount, just as other
scholarship recipients must do.
'Free Year'
Huff says that the reason for the first 'year free' is that
the administration feels many students coming from
financially-deprived backgrounds will have anough
difficulty adjusting to the school without the additional
burden of a job, or worrying about a loan. There are
currently 160 minority freshmen on aid.
Athletic scholarships are handled somewhat differently
from ordinary financial aid procedures. They are financed
by a group of alumni known as the Stanford Buck Club.
This organization grants (16) scholarships a year without
regard to need, although many do go to students who
require aid. Other athletic scholarships are gr? ted on the
basis of need which is determined by the Financial Aids
Office.
Some departments, such as Petroleum Engineering, also
have special scholarship endowments.
Parental Cut-off
Huff reports he also faces the problem of students who
either refuse to be supported by their parents, or whose
parents refuse to support them. The number of students in
these categories has been increasing over the past few years.
There is no definite policy for dealing with these
students. Generally, a thorough investigation of each
situation Is conducted. In most cases, Huff has found the
problem is only a temporary one. If it is permanent,
however, the Financial Aids Office attempts to ensure that
the student can stay in school. Usually, aid to these
students will take the form of loans or work-study projects,
rather than out-right grants.
One solution to the financial aid problem, which will go
into effect next year, is to increase the number of
on-campus jobs tied to scholarships. Many
non-scholarship students are currently holding jobs at the
University which could be granted to scholarship students
as part of their scholarship package.
Huff says he would like to see two different formulae
used to determine need: one for loans or jobs, and a
separate one to determine eligibility for outright grants.
