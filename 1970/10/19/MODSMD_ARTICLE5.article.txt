From Liberation News Service
The fall term is here, and in a
state of trepidation and queasy
pessimism, university officials are
gnashing their teeth over the dark
unknown. "The question is of
course," said Chancellor Lawrence
Chalmers of the University of
Kansas, "Where will the small
group of dedicated anarchists
focus their attention?"
College administrators are
freaking. They know, according to
a recent report in the Wall Street
Journal, that the "major issues
that have sparked campus

disorders in the recent past — the
war in Vietnam, the draft and
racial problems - are all still
present." Furthermore, some
parents are having second
thoughts about sending their
children away to college this year
where they may be shot down by
the National Guard or by other
law enforcers. (New admissions at
Kent State, for example, are down
10 percent.)
Administrators are worried
that on top of everything else,
their colleges may go bankrupt.
At a recent round - table
discussion at the New York Times
office over "the problems facing
the university today," Dr. Samuel
Gould, who just resigned as
chancellor of the State University
of New York, told 10 other
university presidents:
"Support for public higher
education is going to be difficult
to maintain and increase ... so
many questions are being asked
about whether or not institutions
that have unrest and campus
difficulties shoudl really be
supported by the taxpayer."
Who's Paying
Who's going to pay for the
universities if they are closing
down all the time, if they are
producing radicals instead of
corporation executives? What
happens when bombs destroy the
research centers that do the work
the Army pays handsomely for?
What happens when high-ranking
military officers are no longer
turned out of ROTC because
ROTC has been driven off the
campuses? What's going to happen
when students demand open
admissions and a relevant
curriculum, and when they don't
get it, strike?
These problems have driven
frightened university officials into
a summer of "extensive security
preparation."
A quickie course in "riot
control" was taught by military
police officers this summer at
Fort Gordon, Ga., to
representatives of nine American
colleges, including the University
of California at Santa Barbara,
where several thousand
"dissidents" engaged in a struggle

that resulted in the Bank of
America being burnt to the
ground last spring.
Columbia University sent its
chief security office, Warren
Munroe, on a trip this summer in
the hopes he would learn
something about warfare from
European police.
Wall Street Journal
Their discussions touched on
such matters as "the use of shields
against rocks, the use of water and
high-intensity lights to break up
mobs, and ways to identify
lawbreakers in a crowd for later
arrest," the Wall Street Journal
reported.
Compared to the wooden
"dumdum" bullets and the lead
bean bag shot from the "stun
gun" already out of the field in
Berkeley and elsewhere in this
country, the above discussion

College Administrators Are Freaking
...They Know That The \Major Issues 9
...Are All Still Present.

sounds rather tame. Asked about
more specific tips he'd picked up,
Monroe replied that it would be
"best to keep quiet about things
like that - surprise is a good
weapon against some of these
student militants."
A recent article in U.S. News
and World Report outlines some
results of this summer's "security
preparation" (those that aren't to
be kept secret and used later to
surprise students):
A new law affecting all public
institutions in Ohio provides
mandatory one-year suspension
for any student or faculty
member convicted in a court of
law of campus disruption. The
State Board of Regents in lowa
now requires a one-year
suspension or dismissal for any
student, faculty or staff member
who is found guilty of violating
"new and stiffer rules of personal
conduct."

Authority has been given to
college presidents in lowa and
California to ban students from
their campuses temporarily if, in
the opinion of the presidents, the
students are likely to be serious
disturbers.
To keep "outside agitators" off
campus, more and more schools
are providing students with
photo-identification cards.
Many campuses are doubling
the number of security police on
campus.
In Texas, the legislature gave
universities the power to
commission campus police so that
they could, ifnecessary, carry guns
and make arrests.
Pre-School Screen
A few schools are trying to
screen out troublemakers before
they get in. Rollins College in
Florida sent this letter of

admission to the parents of an
incoming freshman: "It is my
hope that you will discuss with
your daughter your expectations
of her attitudes and conduct as a
college student prior to the time
that she arrives . . . Should there
be a permissive attitude on her
part or on your part regarding
either campus disruption or drug
usage, I believe your daughter
should give serious consideration
to delaying her college
attendance."
In Los Angeles, Police Chief
Edward Davis has talked about
swearing in members of the
faculty to help keep the peace at
UCLA in the event of big trouble.
Under a little-used California
law, any male over 18 can be
deputized at any time. If he then
does not come to the aid of
police, he can be arrested. A
spokesman for Davis said the
situation would have to be

"critical" before this idea wac
tried.
All 38 officers of the police
department at the University of
Georgia in Athens are students
attending the university. They are
credited with having done a good
job of maintaining order last year.
Often after a major
disturbance, it is difficult to prove
a case against offenders due to
lack of identification. As an aid in
disciplinary or court proceedings,
several colleges are experimenting
with video-tape, which records
both sight and sound. Others plan
to use still or motion-picture
cameras. It has also been
suggested that rioters be sprayed
with a long-lasting dye so they can
be readily identified.
State institutions that shut
down during the school term in
Ohio are likely to be penalized
financially. The Ohio Board of
Regents threatens to withhold
state support for the period in
which any public college or
university is closed.
Faculty members are forbidden
to strike or boycott classes at
Wisconsin state universities under
a uniform employment contract
adopted by the Board of Regents
on Aug. 14. Violation of the
contract could result in
suspension with out pay,
forfeiture of salary, or
termination of employment.
Law and order won't prevail on
campuses this fall and the
university officials know it. But
they are caught in a maze of riot
control, blue ribbon commissions,
beefed-up security forces, new
and better ID's, bigger and better
locks, and screens for "potential
troublemakers." They'll try
cooptation and when that fails
they'll use repression. And that's
why the student body president
of Jackson State College, where
two blacks were shot to death and
a dozen others wounded by police
last May in what was called by the
President's Commission on
Campus Unrest an "unreasonable,
unjustified overreaction," told the
commission that unless conditions
were changed the campus troubles
of last spring "may be only like a
Saturday night fish-fry."

A quickie course in "riot

police officers this summer at
Fort Gordon, Ga., to

A recent article in U.S. News
and World Report outlines some
results of this summer's "security
preparation" (those that aren't to
be kept secret and used later to
surprise students):
A new law affecting all public
institutions in Ohio provides
mandatory one-year suspension
for any student or faculty
member convicted in a court of
law of campus disruption. The
State Board of Regents in lowa
now requires a one-year
suspension or dismissal for any
student, faculty or staff member
who is found guilty of violating
"new and stiffer rules of personal
conduct."

Authority has been given to
college presidents in lowa and
California to ban students from
their campuses temporarily if, in
the opinion of the presidents, the
students are likely to be serious
disturbers.
To keep "outside agitators" off
campus, more and more schools
are providing students with
photo-identification cards.
Many campuses are doubling
the number of security police on
campus.
In Texas, the legislature gave
universities the power to
commission campus police so that
they could, ifnecessary, carry guns
and make arrests.
Pre-School Screen
A few schools are trying to
screen out troublemakers before
they get in. Rollins College in
Florida sent this letter of

admission to the parents of an
incoming freshman: "It is my
hope that you will discuss with
your daughter your expectations
of her attitudes and conduct as a
college student prior to the time
that she arrives . . . Should there
be a permissive attitude on her
part or on your part regarding
either campus disruption or drug
usage, I believe your daughter
should give serious consideration
to delaying her college
attendance."
In Los Angeles, Police Chief
Edward Davis has talked about
swearing in members of the
faculty to help keep the peace at
UCLA in the event of big trouble.
Under a little-used California
law, any male over 18 can be
deputized at any time. If he then
does not come to the aid of
police, he can be arrested. A
spokesman for Davis said the
situation would have to be

"critical" before this idea wac
tried.
All 38 officers of the police
department at the University of
Georgia in Athens are students
attending the university. They are
credited with having done a good
job of maintaining order last year.
Often after a major
disturbance, it is difficult to prove
a case against offenders due to
lack of identification. As an aid in
disciplinary or court proceedings,
several colleges are experimenting
with video-tape, which records
both sight and sound. Others plan
to use still or motion-picture
cameras. It has also been
suggested that rioters be sprayed
with a long-lasting dye so they can
be readily identified.
State institutions that shut
down during the school term in
Ohio are likely to be penalized
financially. The Ohio Board of
Regents threatens to withhold
state support for the period in
which any public college or
university is closed.
Faculty members are forbidden
to strike or boycott classes at
Wisconsin state universities under
a uniform employment contract
adopted by the Board of Regents
on Aug. 14. Violation of the
contract could result in
suspension with out pay,
forfeiture of salary, or
termination of employment.
Law and order won't prevail on
campuses this fall and the
university officials know it. But
they are caught in a maze of riot
control, blue ribbon commissions,
beefed-up security forces, new
and better ID's, bigger and better
locks, and screens for "potential
troublemakers." They'll try
cooptation and when that fails
they'll use repression. And that's
why the student body president
of Jackson State College, where
two blacks were shot to death and
a dozen others wounded by police
last May in what was called by the
President's Commission on
Campus Unrest an "unreasonable,
unjustified overreaction," told the
commission that unless conditions
were changed the campus troubles
of last spring "may be only like a
Saturday night fish-fry."

The fall term is here, and in a
state of trepidation and queasy
pessimism, university officials are
gnashing their teeth over the dark
unknown. "The question is of
course," said Chancellor Lawrence
Chalmers of the University of
Kansas, "Where will the small
group of dedicated anarchists
focus their attention?"
College administrators are
freaking. They know, according to
a recent report in the Wall Street
Journal, that the "major issues
that have sparked campus

disorders in the recent past — the
war in Vietnam, the draft and
racial problems - are all still
present." Furthermore, some
parents are having second
thoughts about sending their
children away to college this year
where they may be shot down by
the National Guard or by other
law enforcers. (New admissions at
Kent State, for example, are down
10 percent.)
Administrators are worried
that on top of everything else,
their colleges may go bankrupt.
At a recent round - table
discussion at the New York Times
office over "the problems facing
the university today," Dr. Samuel
Gould, who just resigned as
chancellor of the State University
of New York, told 10 other
university presidents:
"Support for public higher
education is going to be difficult
to maintain and increase ... so
many questions are being asked
about whether or not institutions
that have unrest and campus
difficulties shoudl really be
supported by the taxpayer."
Who's Paying
Who's going to pay for the
universities if they are closing
down all the time, if they are
producing radicals instead of
corporation executives? What
happens when bombs destroy the
research centers that do the work
the Army pays handsomely for?
What happens when high-ranking
military officers are no longer
turned out of ROTC because
ROTC has been driven off the
campuses? What's going to happen
when students demand open
admissions and a relevant
curriculum, and when they don't
get it, strike?
These problems have driven
frightened university officials into
a summer of "extensive security
preparation."

campus, more and more schools
are providing students with
photo-identification cards.
Many campuses are doubling
the number of security police on
campus.
In Texas, the legislature gave
universities the power to
commission campus police so that
they could, ifnecessary, carry guns
and make arrests.
Pre-School Screen
A few schools are trying to
screen out troublemakers before
they get in. Rollins College in
Florida sent this letter of

admission to the parents of an
incoming freshman: "It is my
hope that you will discuss with
your daughter your expectations
of her attitudes and conduct as a
college student prior to the time
that she arrives . . . Should there
be a permissive attitude on her
part or on your part regarding
either campus disruption or drug
usage, I believe your daughter
should give serious consideration
to delaying her college
attendance."
In Los Angeles, Police Chief
Edward Davis has talked about
swearing in members of the
faculty to help keep the peace at
UCLA in the event of big trouble.
Under a little-used California
law, any male over 18 can be
deputized at any time. If he then
does not come to the aid of
police, he can be arrested. A
spokesman for Davis said the
situation would have to be

"critical" before this idea wac
tried.
All 38 officers of the police
department at the University of
Georgia in Athens are students
attending the university. They are
credited with having done a good
job of maintaining order last year.
Often after a major
disturbance, it is difficult to prove
a case against offenders due to
lack of identification. As an aid in
disciplinary or court proceedings,
several colleges are experimenting
with video-tape, which records
both sight and sound. Others plan
to use still or motion-picture
cameras. It has also been
suggested that rioters be sprayed
with a long-lasting dye so they can
be readily identified.
State institutions that shut
down during the school term in
Ohio are likely to be penalized
financially. The Ohio Board of
Regents threatens to withhold
state support for the period in
which any public college or
university is closed.
Faculty members are forbidden
to strike or boycott classes at
Wisconsin state universities under
a uniform employment contract
adopted by the Board of Regents
on Aug. 14. Violation of the
contract could result in
suspension with out pay,
forfeiture of salary, or
termination of employment.
Law and order won't prevail on
campuses this fall and the
university officials know it. But
they are caught in a maze of riot
control, blue ribbon commissions,
beefed-up security forces, new
and better ID's, bigger and better
locks, and screens for "potential
troublemakers." They'll try
cooptation and when that fails
they'll use repression. And that's
why the student body president
of Jackson State College, where
two blacks were shot to death and
a dozen others wounded by police
last May in what was called by the
President's Commission on
Campus Unrest an "unreasonable,
unjustified overreaction," told the
commission that unless conditions
were changed the campus troubles
of last spring "may be only like a
Saturday night fish-fry."

The fall term is here, and in a
state of trepidation and queasy
pessimism, university officials are
gnashing their teeth over the dark
unknown. "The question is of
course," said Chancellor Lawrence
Chalmers of the University of
Kansas, "Where will the small
group of dedicated anarchists
focus their attention?"
College administrators are
freaking. They know, according to
a recent report in the Wall Street
Journal, that the "major issues
that have sparked campus

disorders in the recent past — the
war in Vietnam, the draft and
racial problems - are all still
present." Furthermore, some
parents are having second
thoughts about sending their
children away to college this year
where they may be shot down by
the National Guard or by other
law enforcers. (New admissions at
Kent State, for example, are down
10 percent.)
Administrators are worried
that on top of everything else,
their colleges may go bankrupt.
At a recent round - table
discussion at the New York Times
office over "the problems facing
the university today," Dr. Samuel
Gould, who just resigned as
chancellor of the State University
of New York, told 10 other
university presidents:
"Support for public higher
education is going to be difficult
to maintain and increase ... so
many questions are being asked
about whether or not institutions
that have unrest and campus
difficulties shoudl really be
supported by the taxpayer."
Who's Paying
Who's going to pay for the
universities if they are closing
down all the time, if they are
producing radicals instead of
corporation executives? What
happens when bombs destroy the
research centers that do the work
the Army pays handsomely for?
What happens when high-ranking
military officers are no longer
turned out of ROTC because
ROTC has been driven off the
campuses? What's going to happen
when students demand open
admissions and a relevant
curriculum, and when they don't
get it, strike?
These problems have driven
frightened university officials into
a summer of "extensive security
preparation."
A quickie course in "riot
control" was taught by military
police officers this summer at
Fort Gordon, Ga., to
representatives of nine American
colleges, including the University
of California at Santa Barbara,
where several thousand
"dissidents" engaged in a struggle

that resulted in the Bank of
America being burnt to the
ground last spring.
Columbia University sent its
chief security office, Warren
Munroe, on a trip this summer in
the hopes he would learn
something about warfare from
European police.
Wall Street Journal
Their discussions touched on
such matters as "the use of shields
against rocks, the use of water and
high-intensity lights to break up
mobs, and ways to identify
lawbreakers in a crowd for later
arrest," the Wall Street Journal
reported.
Compared to the wooden
"dumdum" bullets and the lead
bean bag shot from the "stun
gun" already out of the field in
Berkeley and elsewhere in this

more specific tips he'd picked up,
Monroe replied that it would be
"best to keep quiet about things

A recent article in U.S. News

university is closed.
Faculty members are forbidden
to strike or boycott classes at
Wisconsin state universities under
a uniform employment contract
adopted by the Board of Regents
on Aug. 14. Violation of the
contract could result in
suspension with out pay,
forfeiture of salary, or
termination of employment.
Law and order won't prevail on
campuses this fall and the
university officials know it. But
they are caught in a maze of riot
control, blue ribbon commissions,
beefed-up security forces, new
and better ID's, bigger and better
locks, and screens for "potential
troublemakers." They'll try
cooptation and when that fails
they'll use repression. And that's
why the student body president
of Jackson State College, where
two blacks were shot to death and
a dozen others wounded by police
last May in what was called by the
President's Commission on
Campus Unrest an "unreasonable,
unjustified overreaction," told the
commission that unless conditions
were changed the campus troubles
of last spring "may be only like a
Saturday night fish-fry."

The fall term is here, and in a
state of trepidation and queasy
pessimism, university officials are
gnashing their teeth over the dark
unknown. "The question is of
course," said Chancellor Lawrence
Chalmers of the University of
Kansas, "Where will the small
group of dedicated anarchists
focus their attention?"
College administrators are
freaking. They know, according to
a recent report in the Wall Street
Journal, that the "major issues
that have sparked campus

disorders in the recent past — the
war in Vietnam, the draft and
racial problems - are all still
present." Furthermore, some
parents are having second
thoughts about sending their
children away to college this year
where they may be shot down by
the National Guard or by other
law enforcers. (New admissions at
Kent State, for example, are down
10 percent.)
Administrators are worried
that on top of everything else,
their colleges may go bankrupt.
At a recent round - table
discussion at the New York Times
office over "the problems facing
the university today," Dr. Samuel
Gould, who just resigned as
chancellor of the State University
of New York, told 10 other
university presidents:
"Support for public higher
education is going to be difficult
to maintain and increase ... so
many questions are being asked
about whether or not institutions
that have unrest and campus
difficulties shoudl really be
supported by the taxpayer."
Who's Paying
Who's going to pay for the
universities if they are closing
down all the time, if they are
producing radicals instead of
corporation executives? What
happens when bombs destroy the
research centers that do the work
the Army pays handsomely for?
What happens when high-ranking
military officers are no longer
turned out of ROTC because
ROTC has been driven off the
campuses? What's going to happen
when students demand open
admissions and a relevant
curriculum, and when they don't
get it, strike?
These problems have driven
frightened university officials into
a summer of "extensive security
preparation."
A quickie course in "riot
control" was taught by military
police officers this summer at
Fort Gordon, Ga., to
representatives of nine American
colleges, including the University
of California at Santa Barbara,
where several thousand
"dissidents" engaged in a struggle

that resulted in the Bank of
America being burnt to the
ground last spring.
Columbia University sent its
chief security office, Warren
Munroe, on a trip this summer in
the hopes he would learn
something about warfare from
European police.
Wall Street Journal
Their discussions touched on
such matters as "the use of shields
against rocks, the use of water and
high-intensity lights to break up
mobs, and ways to identify
lawbreakers in a crowd for later
arrest," the Wall Street Journal
reported.
Compared to the wooden
"dumdum" bullets and the lead
bean bag shot from the "stun
gun" already out of the field in
Berkeley and elsewhere in this
country, the above discussion

...Are All Still Present.

sounds rather tame. Asked about
more specific tips he'd picked up,
Monroe replied that it would be
"best to keep quiet about things
like that - surprise is a good
weapon against some of these
student militants."
A recent article in U.S. News
and World Report outlines some
results of this summer's "security
preparation" (those that aren't to
be kept secret and used later to
surprise students):
A new law affecting all public
institutions in Ohio provides
mandatory one-year suspension
for any student or faculty
member convicted in a court of
law of campus disruption. The
State Board of Regents in lowa
now requires a one-year
suspension or dismissal for any
student, faculty or staff member
who is found guilty of violating
"new and stiffer rules of personal
conduct."

Authority has been given to
college presidents in lowa and
California to ban students from
their campuses temporarily if, in
the opinion of the presidents, the
students are likely to be serious
disturbers.
To keep "outside agitators" off
campus, more and more schools
are providing students with
photo-identification cards.
Many campuses are doubling
the number of security police on
campus.
In Texas, the legislature gave
universities the power to
commission campus police so that
they could, ifnecessary, carry guns
and make arrests.
Pre-School Screen
A few schools are trying to
screen out troublemakers before
they get in. Rollins College in
Florida sent this letter of

admission to the parents of an
incoming freshman: "It is my
hope that you will discuss with
your daughter your expectations
of her attitudes and conduct as a
college student prior to the time
that she arrives . . . Should there
be a permissive attitude on her
part or on your part regarding
either campus disruption or drug
usage, I believe your daughter
should give serious consideration
to delaying her college
attendance."
In Los Angeles, Police Chief
Edward Davis has talked about
swearing in members of the
faculty to help keep the peace at
UCLA in the event of big trouble.
Under a little-used California
law, any male over 18 can be
deputized at any time. If he then
does not come to the aid of
police, he can be arrested. A
spokesman for Davis said the
situation would have to be

"critical" before this idea wac
tried.
All 38 officers of the police
department at the University of
Georgia in Athens are students
attending the university. They are
credited with having done a good
job of maintaining order last year.
Often after a major
disturbance, it is difficult to prove
a case against offenders due to
lack of identification. As an aid in
disciplinary or court proceedings,
several colleges are experimenting
with video-tape, which records
both sight and sound. Others plan
to use still or motion-picture
cameras. It has also been
suggested that rioters be sprayed
with a long-lasting dye so they can
be readily identified.
State institutions that shut
down during the school term in
Ohio are likely to be penalized
financially. The Ohio Board of
Regents threatens to withhold
state support for the period in
which any public college or
university is closed.
