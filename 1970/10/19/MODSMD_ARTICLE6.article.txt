## Toward a Better Epistemology

Perhaps we can talk. now. While
football keeps the lid on.
The other night we argued
again. Of Maoism and my
skepticism. I was told, "You
shouldn't just try to disprove
everything I say. In order to really
learn something, you have to
throw yourself into it, accept it,
and work it into your life."
I'm sorry. That is not how
anyone learns anything. That is
how religions are embraced.
Scientifically, you observe
objective situations, compile data,
make a tentative theory, and TRY
TO DISPROVE IT. You drop it
from skyscrapers and jump up and
down upon it to see if it holds
together at all.
This is not the way the basic
political questions are being
handled. A new book comes out
that says everything we've been
dying to hear, so it's a good book,
no matter how inadequate its
analysis. Who Rules America
graces every radical bibliography
("Blasts the myth of a classless
society!"), but it reads more like a
Who's Who than a discussion of
the mechanism of policy-making.
Furthermore, books which make
valuable points, but do not concur
with the radical analysis are
discarded as "total bullshit." If
they are read, they are read to
find out "what the enemy is
thinking."
I do not agree with Galbraith's
dismissal of the profit motive in
New Industrial State, but his
emphasis on the trend toward
planning, and the necessity for
large corporations to control
resource markets is valuable for
understanding modern capitalism.
Marxist economists like Joan
Robinson and Harry Magdoff
understand this.
"Where do good ideas come
from?"
"From social practice."
Obviously, if you are going to
try to attack capitalism by
organizing in a tenants' union,
most of your ideas will come from
the action involved. The same
goes for organizing against
counter-insurgency research.
But not all good ideas come
from social practice. Einstein's
good ideas in theoretical physics
came from thought experiments.
That's physical science, not social
science. 0.K., but I maintain,

as Marx did, that the method
ology and rigor of physical science
inquiry can be applied to social
problems. Karl Marx's good ideas
came from long hours in the
British Museum.
I bring this up because of the
pervasive anti-intellectualism in
the Movement today. Most of
John Lewis' good ideas on
Vietnam and China came from
primary sources, government
documents, Hong Kong
dispatches. Patient research and
the use of social science tools of
analysis. We had another
argument culminating with:
Me: Do you think John Lewis
would be a better China scholar if
he dodged police at Lytton Plaza
on Saturday nights?

Rad-rev friend: Yes.
The sloppiness and dogmatism
in left thinking is depressing, not
for aesthetic reasons, but because
it can lead to stupid action.
Correct analysis is important in
order to formulate working
strategy.
This is most evident in the
Weatherman case. Weatherman
analysis asserts 1) That there are
no groups to organize in America.
Everyone has been bought off. 2)
That the revolution is going to
come from the outside as the
economic empire is dismantled in
the Third World, 3) That the best
strategy is to speed that
"revolution from outside" by
terrorism, even to the point of
provoking fascism.

All this even though 1) There
have been some successes in
community and working class
organizing already. 2) It is not at
all clear that if all Third World
investment were nationalized
tomorrow, the house would fall
down in America. 3) History gives
no reason to believe that bringing
on fascism would weaken any
empire or catalyze revolution.
But the analysis made,
slogans shouted, patron saints
invoked. Bombs are thrown. No
one i*; mobilized. Some people get
hurt who don't have to get hurt.
And the Movement gets hurt.

Perhaps we can talk. now. While
football keeps the lid on.
The other night we argued
again. Of Maoism and my
skepticism. I was told, "You
shouldn't just try to disprove
everything I say. In order to really
learn something, you have to
throw yourself into it, accept it,
and work it into your life."
I'm sorry. That is not how
anyone learns anything. That is
how religions are embraced.
Scientifically, you observe
objective situations, compile data,
make a tentative theory, and TRY
TO DISPROVE IT. You drop it
from skyscrapers and jump up and
down upon it to see if it holds
together at all.
This is not the way the basic
political questions are being
handled. A new book comes out
that says everything we've been
dying to hear, so it's a good book,
no matter how inadequate its
analysis. Who Rules America
graces every radical bibliography
("Blasts the myth of a classless
society!"), but it reads more like a
Who's Who than a discussion of
the mechanism of policy-making.
Furthermore, books which make
valuable points, but do not concur
with the radical analysis are
discarded as "total bullshit." If
they are read, they are read to
find out "what the enemy is
thinking."
I do not agree with Galbraith's
dismissal of the profit motive in
New Industrial State, but his
emphasis on the trend toward
planning, and the necessity for
large corporations to control
resource markets is valuable for
understanding modern capitalism.
Marxist economists like Joan
Robinson and Harry Magdoff
understand this.
"Where do good ideas come
from?"
"From social practice."
Obviously, if you are going to
try to attack capitalism by
organizing in a tenants' union,
most of your ideas will come from
the action involved. The same
goes for organizing against
counter-insurgency research.
But not all good ideas come
from social practice. Einstein's
good ideas in theoretical physics
came from thought experiments.
That's physical science, not social
science. 0.K., but I maintain,

as Marx did, that the method
ology and rigor of physical science
inquiry can be applied to social
problems. Karl Marx's good ideas
came from long hours in the
British Museum.
I bring this up because of the
pervasive anti-intellectualism in
the Movement today. Most of
John Lewis' good ideas on
Vietnam and China came from
primary sources, government
documents, Hong Kong
dispatches. Patient research and
the use of social science tools of
analysis. We had another
argument culminating with:
Me: Do you think John Lewis
would be a better China scholar if
he dodged police at Lytton Plaza
on Saturday nights?

Rad-rev friend: Yes.
The sloppiness and dogmatism
in left thinking is depressing, not
for aesthetic reasons, but because
it can lead to stupid action.
Correct analysis is important in
order to formulate working
strategy.
This is most evident in the
Weatherman case. Weatherman
analysis asserts 1) That there are
no groups to organize in America.
Everyone has been bought off. 2)
That the revolution is going to
