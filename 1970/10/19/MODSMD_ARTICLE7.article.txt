# Human Survival Questionable, Barbara Ward Forecasts

### PHIL REVZIN 
"Survival to the year 2000
looks rather in doubt," economist
Barbara Ward warned Saturday
flight, becuase the "white tribes of
W«itern Europe and North
America have learned to apply
extraordinary power in using
resources, but have not increased
in wisdom one iota" in human
relationships.
The contributing editor of The
Economist told a near capacity
crowd in Cummings Art
Auditorium that "hitherto man
would make limited messes; now
he has the capacity to make the
final mistake."

Miss Ward delivering the first
of three Camp Memorial lectures
on "A World Out of Balance"
sketched the background of
industrialization which has
created a crisis of "unthinking
ology." The expert of
tfi jaW-world nations added that
"there's no use thinking about the
developed countries and the
under-developed countries apart.
Thei* isn't 'us' and 'them', it's
just«i together."
Miss Ward, currently Albert
Schweitzer Professor in
Humanities at Columbia
University said that at the

beginning of the rush to
industrialization, "society created
a system of dynamic rewards for
those people in the system who
could already take care of
themselves."
Speaking throughout without
notes, Miss Ward outlined three
basic changes in European culture
which led to expanding
industrialism. These were
movements of large numbers of
people, improved agricultural
technology, and improved
technology for manufacturing
appliances.
