# Four Arrested In Kent State Roundup
## 
### 
RAVENNA, Ohio — The student
body president and an associate
professor at Kent State University were
among the first of 25 persons to be
booked Monday in a special grand jury
probe of the Kent State riot last May.
Craig Morgan, 20, a senior and
student body president, was arrested in
student government offices on the
campus. He was charged with
second-degree riot during disturbances
on the campus May 1 -4. Details of the
charge were not given.
Dr. Thomas S. Lough, 42, an
associate professor of sociology and
anthropology, surrendered on a count
of inciting to riot May 4, the day four
Kent students were killed in a clash
with Ohio National Guardsmen.
Morgan and Lough were named in
secret indictments handed down Friday
by a special state grand jury that
investigated the campus rioting. The
grand jury, in a report issued Friday,
also exonerated the guard with regard
to the deaths and said a major cause of
the campus disorders was
administration permissiveness and
laxity in discipline.
Among the others indicted was
Richard Felber, 21, of Akron, a former
Kent student, charged with first-degree
rioting, attempting to burn a campus
ROTC building, striking a fireman and
interfering with a fireman at the scene
of a fire.
Jerry H. Rupe, 22, of Ravenna,
serving a three-month sentence in the
Stark County jail at Canton for
possession of narcotics and narcotics
instruments, was indicted for arson,
first-degree riot, striking a fireman and
interfering with a fireman at the scene
of a fire.
Kent State President Robert I. White
Monday rejected a student demand that
the school oppose any indictments
handed down by the jury, saying that
indictments "are part of our judicial
system."

White also turned down demands
that ROTC, defense research and a
police training program be removed
from the campus. He warned that
students should not expect formal
reception or prompt response from his
office on future "demands."
Attorney William Kunstler, who has
agreed to coordinate the defense of
those indicted, spoke to students in
Kent Monday night.
"Society had to restor to the use of
law to condone murder and the use of
the courts to condone silence,"
Kunstler, defense attorney for the
Chicago 7, told a crowd of more than
1,000 students at a private club.
Kunstler presented a plan of action
to students and called for unity.
"We want to put on a defense that is
an offense," Kunstler told the chanting,
applauding students, adding that he
plans to coordinate a common defense
for any or all of the 25 persons indicted
who wish it.

student body president, was arrested in
student government offices on the
campus. He was charged with
second-degree riot during disturbances
on the campus May 1 -4. Details of the
charge were not given.
Dr. Thomas S. Lough, 42, an
associate professor of sociology and
anthropology, surrendered on a count
of inciting to riot May 4, the day four
Kent students were killed in a clash
with Ohio National Guardsmen.
Morgan and Lough were named in
secret indictments handed down Friday
by a special state grand jury that
investigated the campus rioting. The
grand jury, in a report issued Friday,
also exonerated the guard with regard
to the deaths and said a major cause of
the campus disorders was
administration permissiveness and
laxity in discipline.
Among the others indicted was
Richard Felber, 21, of Akron, a former
Kent student, charged with first-degree
rioting, attempting to burn a campus
ROTC building, striking a fireman and
interfering with a fireman at the scene
of a fire.
Jerry H. Rupe, 22, of Ravenna,
serving a three-month sentence in the
Stark County jail at Canton for
possession of narcotics and narcotics
instruments, was indicted for arson,
first-degree riot, striking a fireman and
interfering with a fireman at the scene
of a fire.
Kent State President Robert I. White
Monday rejected a student demand that
the school oppose any indictments
handed down by the jury, saying that
indictments "are part of our judicial
system."

White also turned down demands
that ROTC, defense research and a
police training program be removed
from the campus. He warned that
students should not expect formal
reception or prompt response from his
office on future "demands."
Attorney William Kunstler, who has
agreed to coordinate the defense of
those indicted, spoke to students in
Kent Monday night.
"Society had to restor to the use of
law to condone murder and the use of
the courts to condone silence,"
Kunstler, defense attorney for the
Chicago 7, told a crowd of more than
1,000 students at a private club.
Kunstler presented a plan of action
to students and called for unity.
"We want to put on a defense that is
an offense," Kunstler told the chanting,
applauding students, adding that he
plans to coordinate a common defense
for any or all of the 25 persons indicted
who wish it.
