Stereotypes
We wish to thank Jonathan
Dedmon and Stan Krute for their
contributions to promoting racial
stereotypes in the Friday, October
16 "SLAT" article. It's always
nice to find white liberals with a
sense of huinor regarding peoples
of color, and the alternative
definition of "Mem Chu" as "Fu
Man Chu's elder brother who died
at an early age in a head-on
rickshaw accident" shows Mr.
Dedmon's prowess at such humor.
It was especially rewarding to
talk to Mr. Krute, who so expertly
drew the short, buck-toothed,
pig-tailed, slant-eyed "Mem Chu"
character that accompanied the
article. Upon being questioned
over the phone as to how he came
to draw such a vivid
characterization, Mr. Krute's
initial response was that he only
illustrated what Mr. Dedmon had
written. This attitude then gave
way to one of an indignant "gee,
you sound so pissed ... so what if
I drew him the way I did . . . after
all, 1 didn't mean anything by
it . . . you making a big thing out
of nothing . . ."
We wonder if Mr. Krute would
have just as nonchlantly drawn a
"happy nigger" if the article had
indicated "Mem Rufus," or a
slumbering, sombrero-wearing
Mexican if "Mem Taco" were
written. For that matter, if the
names existed, would Mr.
Dedmon have dared to write
"Mem Rufus: Aunt Jemima's
third son who choked to death
after consuming five watermelons
in one sitting," or "Mem Taco:
Frito Bandido's second cousin
who suffocated trying to get his
sombrero off his head"? Nobody
would dare draw or write "Happy
niggers," or "Frito Bandidos," but
"Fu Man Chu" and the general
Oriental stereotype is desperately
preserved in American
mythology—to such an extent, in
fact, that "innocent" liberals can
become indignant when someone
complains about their usage.
We suppose that "no one
meant any harm" and that we
"should learn to take a little
joke." Unfortunately, too many
Asians have had their minds
ravaged by such "harmless jokes."
The psychological subjugation of
peoples of color usually comes in
the form of such "humor" . . .
and it's time this society realized
that none of us ever thought it
was particularly funny.

'Insulted'
Editor, THE DAILY:
Concerning the Freshman
SLAT article in the October Kith
issue, I should like to say how
very insulted I was at the peculiar
caricature of the stereotyped
Asian, "Mem Chu." As an Asian
American woman, I have seen
what this type of degrading image
has done to our men.
In believing this somewhat
subhuman cartoon of themselves
which the white man has told him
is right, the Asian American man
became afraid to even be seen

with his own women. Then, since
we women were subtly forced to
believe that myth, many of us
prostituted ourselves to the white
man by fulfilling the submissive,
exotic, Oriental female role.
Well, let me tell you,
Honorable Sir, that we Asian
Americans are catching onto your
games (we've played them so
long). This kind of ridiculing
couched in poor, cheap humor
can no longer be tolerated or
ignored. And we will not accept
such racist attitudes any longer
because there is something called
self-pride and honor that we most
sincerely care about.

It's interesting (actually damn
annoying to me) to see that white
liberals decrying overt and
institutional racism still have a
minority to kick around.
Reds are so far down that you
can't make fun of them. Blacks
and browns are too heavy to
caricature. But yellows—al,
yellows! They can take a good
joke, right? Ha, ha.
Since your racism is so
ingrained that you cannot see it
unless someone kicks you in the
ass, I'd like to point out that the
stereotyping of racial minorities is
a significant perpetuating force
for racism. The portrayal of
Asians as buck-toothed, slant-eved
idiots with beanie caps and
pigtails by Stan Krute is nothing
but stereotyping-and a fairly
humiliating one at that.
In fact, this very kind of
stereotyping made Asian
immigrants so paranoid when they
first came to your country
(whoops, our country) that they
tried to turn as white as snow.
You know—cut our hair short,
train our children to speak
without an accent, abandon our
customs (but we were allowed to
keep our food cause whites dig it).
Well, Mr. Krute and company,
if you'll take a look around this
campus you'll see that Asians
(whether foreign or domestic) do
not have pigtails and buck teeth.
It's precisely your kind of

Last Thursday's open letter to
Lyman from the Free Campus
Movement pointed out that the
Stanford administration has
ignored campus workers in regard
to the two days off for political
activity. The fact that we are
ignored is certainly true, although
this will he changed.
But then, the FCM, a group of
right wing extremists, has the
audacity to speak for Stanford
workers and "strongly urge" that
we be given the time off also.
Since when did the FCM begin to
speak for Stanford workers? FCM
has never done anything in the
past except to attempt to subvert

Last year, when Stanford
workers and students were

The next time that someone
from the FCM gets an
uncontrollable desire to speak for
Stanford workers, I suggest that
they stick their bourgeois heads
back into the Wall Street Journal
and figure out new ways to
exploit people. Stanford workers
are well able to speak for
themselves.

Unmarked Cars
Fditor, THE DAILY:
Your report October 14 th of
the unmarked patrol car question
on Tuesday's KZSU broadcast was
quite misleading. President Lyman
was asked about "unmarked Palo
Alto Police cars operating on
campus." We are not aware of any
such operation on the campus as
stated in The Daily. The car with
license number ZHW 089 is used
by the Stanford Police
Department. That Department has
seven cars all of which are the
same color. Five of these cars have
spotlights on the roof for
purposes of traffic control. The
other two cars do not have
spotlights because they are used
primarily as utility vehicles rather
than patrol cars. One of the cars is
used by Chief Bell for his
transportation around the
campus. The second car, license
number ZHW 08 9, is used during
the daytime in routine
investigation of crime reports on
campus and during the night-time
by the supervisor of the
night wat chmen in order to
transport the watchmen to their
various posts about the campus.
When, on several occasions, a
car was needed for a slake-out on
Plum Tree Lane or Lasuen in an
attempt to catch people stealing
tape decks and hubcaps from cars
parked on those roads, one of
those two automobiles without
the spot lights was used.

Fditor, THE DAILY:
Your report October 14 th of
the unmarked patrol car question
on Tuesday's KZSU broadcast was
quite misleading. President Lyman
was asked about "unmarked Palo
Alto Police cars operating on
campus." We are not aware of any
such operation on the campus as
stated in The Daily. The car with
license number ZHW 089 is used
by the Stanford Police
Department. That Department has
seven cars all of which are the
same color. Five of these cars have
spotlights on the roof for
purposes of traffic control. The
other two cars do not have
spotlights because they are used
primarily as utility vehicles rather
than patrol cars. One of the cars is
used by Chief Bell for his

number ZHW 08 9, is used during
the daytime in routine

Stereotypes
We wish to thank Jonathan
Dedmon and Stan Krute for their
contributions to promoting racial
stereotypes in the Friday, October
16 "SLAT" article. It's always
nice to find white liberals with a
sense of huinor regarding peoples
of color, and the alternative
definition of "Mem Chu" as "Fu
Man Chu's elder brother who died
at an early age in a head-on
rickshaw accident" shows Mr.
Dedmon's prowess at such humor.
It was especially rewarding to
talk to Mr. Krute, who so expertly
drew the short, buck-toothed,
pig-tailed, slant-eyed "Mem Chu"
character that accompanied the
article. Upon being questioned
over the phone as to how he came
to draw such a vivid
characterization, Mr. Krute's
initial response was that he only
illustrated what Mr. Dedmon had
written. This attitude then gave
way to one of an indignant "gee,
you sound so pissed ... so what if
I drew him the way I did . . . after
all, 1 didn't mean anything by
it . . . you making a big thing out
of nothing . . ."
We wonder if Mr. Krute would
have just as nonchlantly drawn a
"happy nigger" if the article had
indicated "Mem Rufus," or a
slumbering, sombrero-wearing
Mexican if "Mem Taco" were
written. For that matter, if the
names existed, would Mr.
Dedmon have dared to write
"Mem Rufus: Aunt Jemima's
third son who choked to death
after consuming five watermelons
in one sitting," or "Mem Taco:
Frito Bandido's second cousin
who suffocated trying to get his
sombrero off his head"? Nobody
would dare draw or write "Happy
niggers," or "Frito Bandidos," but
"Fu Man Chu" and the general
Oriental stereotype is desperately
preserved in American
mythology—to such an extent, in
fact, that "innocent" liberals can
become indignant when someone
complains about their usage.
We suppose that "no one
meant any harm" and that we
"should learn to take a little

Last Thursday's open letter to

But then, the FCM, a group of

audacity to speak for Stanford

Since when did the FCM begin to
speak for Stanford workers? FCM
has never done anything in the
past except to attempt to subvert
worker's movements.

Last year, when Stanford
workers and students were
picketing in support of the GE

every attempt to disrupt the

Later in the year, when Nixon

FCM is doing nothing about

done nothing to help in the

The only thing that FCM has done

was asked about "unmarked Palo

seven cars all of which are the

Stereotypes
We wish to thank Jonathan
Dedmon and Stan Krute for their
contributions to promoting racial
stereotypes in the Friday, October
16 "SLAT" article. It's always
nice to find white liberals with a
sense of huinor regarding peoples
of color, and the alternative
definition of "Mem Chu" as "Fu
Man Chu's elder brother who died
at an early age in a head-on
rickshaw accident" shows Mr.
Dedmon's prowess at such humor.
It was especially rewarding to
talk to Mr. Krute, who so expertly
drew the short, buck-toothed,
pig-tailed, slant-eyed "Mem Chu"
character that accompanied the
article. Upon being questioned
over the phone as to how he came
to draw such a vivid
characterization, Mr. Krute's
initial response was that he only
illustrated what Mr. Dedmon had
written. This attitude then gave
way to one of an indignant "gee,
you sound so pissed ... so what if
I drew him the way I did . . . after
all, 1 didn't mean anything by
it . . . you making a big thing out
of nothing . . ."
We wonder if Mr. Krute would
have just as nonchlantly drawn a
"happy nigger" if the article had
indicated "Mem Rufus," or a
slumbering, sombrero-wearing
Mexican if "Mem Taco" were
written. For that matter, if the
names existed, would Mr.
Dedmon have dared to write
"Mem Rufus: Aunt Jemima's
third son who choked to death
after consuming five watermelons
in one sitting," or "Mem Taco:
Frito Bandido's second cousin
who suffocated trying to get his
sombrero off his head"? Nobody
would dare draw or write "Happy
niggers," or "Frito Bandidos," but
"Fu Man Chu" and the general
Oriental stereotype is desperately
preserved in American
mythology—to such an extent, in
fact, that "innocent" liberals can
become indignant when someone
complains about their usage.
We suppose that "no one
meant any harm" and that we
"should learn to take a little

It's interesting (actually damn

Reds are so far down that you

caricature. But yellows—al,

joke, right? Ha, ha.
Since your racism is so
ingrained that you cannot see it
unless someone kicks you in the
ass, I'd like to point out that the
stereotyping of racial minorities is
a significant perpetuating force
for racism. The portrayal of
Asians as buck-toothed, slant-eved
idiots with beanie caps and
pigtails by Stan Krute is nothing
but stereotyping-and a fairly
humiliating one at that.
In fact, this very kind of
stereotyping made Asian
immigrants so paranoid when they
first came to your country
(whoops, our country) that they
tried to turn as white as snow.
You know—cut our hair short,
train our children to speak

Well, Mr. Krute and company,

was asked about "unmarked Palo

seven cars all of which are the

Stereotypes
We wish to thank Jonathan
Dedmon and Stan Krute for their
contributions to promoting racial
stereotypes in the Friday, October
16 "SLAT" article. It's always
nice to find white liberals with a
sense of huinor regarding peoples
of color, and the alternative
definition of "Mem Chu" as "Fu
Man Chu's elder brother who died
at an early age in a head-on
rickshaw accident" shows Mr.
Dedmon's prowess at such humor.
It was especially rewarding to
talk to Mr. Krute, who so expertly
drew the short, buck-toothed,
pig-tailed, slant-eyed "Mem Chu"
character that accompanied the
article. Upon being questioned
over the phone as to how he came
to draw such a vivid
characterization, Mr. Krute's
initial response was that he only
illustrated what Mr. Dedmon had
written. This attitude then gave
way to one of an indignant "gee,
you sound so pissed ... so what if
I drew him the way I did . . . after
all, 1 didn't mean anything by
it . . . you making a big thing out
of nothing . . ."
We wonder if Mr. Krute would
have just as nonchlantly drawn a
"happy nigger" if the article had
indicated "Mem Rufus," or a
slumbering, sombrero-wearing
Mexican if "Mem Taco" were
written. For that matter, if the
names existed, would Mr.
Dedmon have dared to write
"Mem Rufus: Aunt Jemima's
third son who choked to death
after consuming five watermelons
in one sitting," or "Mem Taco:
Frito Bandido's second cousin
who suffocated trying to get his
sombrero off his head"? Nobody
would dare draw or write "Happy
niggers," or "Frito Bandidos," but
"Fu Man Chu" and the general
Oriental stereotype is desperately
preserved in American
mythology—to such an extent, in
fact, that "innocent" liberals can
become indignant when someone
complains about their usage.
We suppose that "no one
meant any harm" and that we
"should learn to take a little
joke." Unfortunately, too many
Asians have had their minds
ravaged by such "harmless jokes."
The psychological subjugation of
peoples of color usually comes in

what this type of degrading image

In believing this somewhat

became afraid to even be seen

we women were subtly forced to
believe that myth, many of us
prostituted ourselves to the white

exotic, Oriental female role.
