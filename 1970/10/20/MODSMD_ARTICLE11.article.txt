## Horn Of Plenty 
### 
The following questions were
asked by students at the
University of Alabama. Things are
changing in the old South:
QUESTION: I have noticed
that guys stoned on grass are
usually horny, but girls aren't.
Any comments?
ANSWER: Maybe their horns
don't show.
QUESTION: Do you really
have a research team? How many
people are on it? How does one get
to be a member?
ANSWER: My "research team"
includes a "laboratory assistant",
an "apprentice" and assorted and
sordid friends, relatives and
readers. If you wish to join my
research staff consider yourself a
member.
QUESTION: What do you
think of extra-marital relations?
ANSWER: I think that people
should determine their own moral
code and allow others to do the
same.
QUESTION: How substantial
is the evidence that LSD causes
chromosome damage which is
likely to effect one's future
progeny even before pregnancy
has occured?
ANSWER: Despite a recent
Journal of the AMA lead article
with a misleading title, evidence
of such damage is flimsy. So, for
that matter, is evidence that LSD
causes any chromosome damage
at all.
QUESTION: A recent
newspaper article reported
Pentagon researchers had found
marijuana in large doses caused
irreversible brain damage in
laboratory animals. Is this just
propaganda?
ANSWER: Any substance in
sufficient quantity, including
water, can cause irreversible
damage to the body. The U.S.
Health, Education and Welfare
Department states several more
years of research will be necessary
before they are prepared to
comment on this question.
Previous extensive studies of
marijuana, including the British
Hemp Commission and LaOuardia
Reports, found no impairment
with moderate usage. Many of us
though have suspected for a long
time that brain damage is
epidemic in the Pentagon.
QUESTION: What is the
danger of taking successive
amphetamines to stay speedy
while studying?
ANSWER: Amphetamines
rapidly produce "tolerance", the
pharmacologic phenomenon of
the necessity to take more and
more of the drug to achieve the
same desired effect. When the
effect of amphetamines wears off,
depression follows and some
people keep taking more speed to
avoid this unpleasant feeling.
Soon they become strung out on

the drug. Toxic paranoid
psychoses, overdoses,
malnutrition, tooth decay and
personality changes all may result
from a chronic amphetamine
habit.
QUESTION: Can a person stay
healthy on 1 1/2 or 2 hours of
sleep per night?
ANSWER: Not unless he also
sleeps 5 or 6 hours per dayâ€”with
rare exceptions.
QUESTION: Does PCP cause
pinpoint brain lesions?
ANSWER: Not to rny

knowledge. PCP (Sernyl), an
animal tranquilizer, is the usual
component of capsules or tablets
falsely sold as PHC.
QUESTION: Do LSD or other
psychedelics cause memory loss?
ANSWER: I can't remember
reading any such report.
QUESTION: Does mescaline
cause flashbacks as LSD can?
ANSWER: Flashbacks from
mescaline use have not been
reported and would be unusual
these days to a person who has
taken mescaline and not LSD.
Also unusual would be finding

Eugene schoenfeld m.d.

real mescaline on the black
market.
QUESTION: 1 had hepatitis 10
years ago and the physician said
my liver was 30 to 50% damaged.
Is this permanent? I believe the
type was infectious hepatitis.
ANSWER: Hepatitis (serum or
infectious) weakens the liver and
makes it more susceptible to
future damage.
