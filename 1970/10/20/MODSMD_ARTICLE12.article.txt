# Tjader Outshines Smoke
## 
### DAVID L. GLASS 
Someone once described Gertrude Stein's
writing as "a cold black suet-roll of uniform
consistency and interminable length."
Without going into the obvious Freudian
implications of this metaphor, let me say
that it struck me as a particularly apt
description of what 1 heard Sunday in the
alfresco Frost Amphitheatre, as I soaked up
the California sun, the sweet smell of grass
(two kinds), and the music of Smoke-not
necessarily in that order.
A stunning exception to the mediocrity
was the Cal Tjader Quintet, the concert's
main event. But as the program began with
an undistinguished rock group—and was
further delayed by a bit of political
sermonizing, purporting to explain (not very
clearly) how programs like this will help to
reallocate $150 billion in funds to the poor
people—it was almost two hours before the
Tjader group mounted the stage.
Nevertheless, two hours of tedium could
hardly dilute my enjoyment of Cal Tjader's

obvious mastery of the jazz idiom. The
group's performance was characterized by
professionalism, polish, and first-rate
musicianship—elusive qualities, but very
much evident in the Cal Tjader Quintet.
Michael Smith on congos was nothing
short of fabulous. Functioning in a dual role,
he stole the show with his excellent
improvisations, but just as easily conceded
center stage and set the background for his
compatriots' explorations.
The abysmally low attendance figures
point at the depth of the general apathy in
the Bay Area to all forms of progressive jazz.
Despite its reputation as a music center, San
Francisco is far behind even Los Angeles as a
jazz city. Cal Tjader deserved better.
The Tjader group's quality was especially
marked in comparison with the feature act,
Smoke. While Smoke displayed great
potential, it lacked Tjader's subtle
professionalism—the on-stage harmony that
takes time to develop.
Smoke is a sextet of basically competent

musicians whose music attempts to explore
daring and creative new paths. The word
"attempts" is the key, for it is in execution
that they fail. They're on to something, but
they're not big enough to handle it—yet.
The Gertrude Stein reference occurred to
me during their first number, which lasted a
full 45 minutes by my watch, which I felt
called upon to consult frequently, if only to
alleviate the boredom. This is a dangerously
protracted length for a basically
improvisatory type of music, even if the
improviser is named Johann Sebastian Bach.
In this case, the result was the
aforementioned suet-roll.
The music strayed as far from
conventional tonality as anything I've heard
in the popular realm—yet again, the
innovation was totally lacking in a higher
artistic purpose. The problem with many
popular performers—or, for that matter,
with "serious" composers—is that in striving
to be "different" they lose track of their
purpose which should be the creation of
stimulating, enjoyable music.

obvious mastery of the jazz idiom. The
group's performance was characterized by
professionalism, polish, and first-rate
musicianship—elusive qualities, but very
much evident in the Cal Tjader Quintet.
Michael Smith on congos was nothing
short of fabulous. Functioning in a dual role,
he stole the show with his excellent
improvisations, but just as easily conceded
center stage and set the background for his
compatriots' explorations.
The abysmally low attendance figures
point at the depth of the general apathy in
the Bay Area to all forms of progressive jazz.
Despite its reputation as a music center, San
Francisco is far behind even Los Angeles as a
jazz city. Cal Tjader deserved better.
The Tjader group's quality was especially
marked in comparison with the feature act,
Smoke. While Smoke displayed great
potential, it lacked Tjader's subtle
professionalism—the on-stage harmony that
takes time to develop.
Smoke is a sextet of basically competent

musicians whose music attempts to explore
daring and creative new paths. The word
"attempts" is the key, for it is in execution
that they fail. They're on to something, but
they're not big enough to handle it—yet.
The Gertrude Stein reference occurred to
me during their first number, which lasted a
full 45 minutes by my watch, which I felt
called upon to consult frequently, if only to
alleviate the boredom. This is a dangerously
protracted length for a basically
improvisatory type of music, even if the
improviser is named Johann Sebastian Bach.
In this case, the result was the
aforementioned suet-roll.
The music strayed as far from
conventional tonality as anything I've heard
in the popular realm—yet again, the
innovation was totally lacking in a higher
artistic purpose. The problem with many
popular performers—or, for that matter,
with "serious" composers—is that in striving
to be "different" they lose track of their
purpose which should be the creation of
stimulating, enjoyable music.

CAL TJADER—Hot but smooth music melted away a less-than-ambitious afternoon at Frost
amphitheatre. The concert, including "Smoke" was sponsored by the BSU.
Someone once described Gertrude Stein's
writing as "a cold black suet-roll of uniform
consistency and interminable length."
Without going into the obvious Freudian
implications of this metaphor, let me say
that it struck me as a particularly apt
description of what 1 heard Sunday in the
alfresco Frost Amphitheatre, as I soaked up
the California sun, the sweet smell of grass
(two kinds), and the music of Smoke-not
necessarily in that order.
A stunning exception to the mediocrity
was the Cal Tjader Quintet, the concert's
main event. But as the program began with
an undistinguished rock group—and was
further delayed by a bit of political
sermonizing, purporting to explain (not very
clearly) how programs like this will help to
reallocate $150 billion in funds to the poor
people—it was almost two hours before the
Tjader group mounted the stage.
Nevertheless, two hours of tedium could
hardly dilute my enjoyment of Cal Tjader's

obvious mastery of the jazz idiom. The
group's performance was characterized by
professionalism, polish, and first-rate
musicianship—elusive qualities, but very
