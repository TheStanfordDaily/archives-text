# Stanford—In—Washington
## D.C. Interns Get Insight Into 'System' 
### 
"What's a CHOB?"
"You mean you can talk as
long as you want for nothing on
this phone after five?"
"Is Georgetown always full of
Virginia teenagers on Saturday
nights?"
During the past summer, 78
Stanford students found out the
answers to these and other
questions during their stay in
Washington, D.C., with the
Stanford-in-Washington program.
First-Hand Glimpse
Working in the offices of
Senators, Congressmen, Federal
agencies, Presidential
Commissions, and
non-governmental organizations,
the students were able to get a
first-hand glimpse of the
"democratic process" in action.
Conversely, government
officials were able to gauge
student opinion and advice on the
wide variety of issues.
Capitol Hill was the home-base
for 5 6 of the interns. Working
either on the Senate or House
side, an intern's duties varied
according to his personal in
initiative and the attitudes of his
employer. Some interns were able
to draft important position papers
for members of Congress, while
others helped answer constituent

mail, did case work, tabulated
questionnaires from the district
and assisted in the offices' clerical
operations.
Congressmen Speak
To supplement the experience
of helping in a legislative office,
Stanford-in-Washington (SIW)
arranged for representatives from
all aspects of official Washington
life to address the interns. As a
result, Senator Frank Church
(D-Idaho), Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development George
Romney, Congressmen Richard
Boiling (D-Mo.), F. Bradford
Morse (R-Mass.), and Deputy
Secretary of Defense David
Packard, among others, spoke to
and with students on a variety of
issues.
House-Senate Program
In addition to SIWs offerings,
interns could also avail themselves
(with their employer's permission)
of the offerings of the House and
Senate Intern Program's speakers.
Several informal parties and
get-togethers provided a basic
social life for interns, sponsored
both by SIW, other interns, and
the Bi-Partisan Intern Program.
Stanford-in-Washington
provided some help in assisting
students trying to find housing in
the Washington, D.C., area for the
summer. Stanford alumni in the
Capital provided a big assist in this
and other ways, often opening
their own homes to students.
Application Procedures
Stanford-in-Washington will be
holding a meeting today at 4 p.m.

in Tresidder 2 7 4-5 , to explain
how the program works and how
it can help students find
government jobs in Washington,
Sacramento, and local
government. Application forms
will be available at that time.
Stanford-in-Washington does
not itself secure jobs for students

as much as suggest to them which
Congressmen, agencies, and
private organizations might be in
need of interns during the
summer. SIW acts as a lobbying
agency in forwarding the
applications of qualified students
to their selected potential
°mployers.

In addition to SIWs offerings,
interns could also avail themselves
(with their employer's permission)
of the offerings of the House and
Senate Intern Program's speakers.
Several informal parties and
get-togethers provided a basic
social life for interns, sponsored
both by SIW, other interns, and
the Bi-Partisan Intern Program.
Stanford-in-Washington
provided some help in assisting
students trying to find housing in
the Washington, D.C., area for the
summer. Stanford alumni in the
Capital provided a big assist in this
and other ways, often opening
their own homes to students.
Application Procedures
Stanford-in-Washington will be
holding a meeting today at 4 p.m.

in Tresidder 2 7 4-5 , to explain
how the program works and how
it can help students find
government jobs in Washington,
Sacramento, and local
government. Application forms
will be available at that time.
Stanford-in-Washington does
not itself secure jobs for students

as much as suggest to them which
Congressmen, agencies, and
private organizations might be in
need of interns during the
summer. SIW acts as a lobbying
agency in forwarding the
applications of qualified students
to their selected potential
°mployers.
"What's a CHOB?"
"You mean you can talk as
long as you want for nothing on
this phone after five?"
"Is Georgetown always full of
Virginia teenagers on Saturday
nights?"
During the past summer, 78
Stanford students found out the
answers to these and other
questions during their stay in
Washington, D.C., with the
Stanford-in-Washington program.
First-Hand Glimpse
Working in the offices of
Senators, Congressmen, Federal
agencies, Presidential
Commissions, and
non-governmental organizations,
the students were able to get a
first-hand glimpse of the
"democratic process" in action.
Conversely, government
officials were able to gauge
student opinion and advice on the
wide variety of issues.
Capitol Hill was the home-base
for 5 6 of the interns. Working
either on the Senate or House
side, an intern's duties varied
according to his personal in
initiative and the attitudes of his
employer. Some interns were able
to draft important position papers
for members of Congress, while
others helped answer constituent

mail, did case work, tabulated
questionnaires from the district
and assisted in the offices' clerical
operations.
Congressmen Speak
To supplement the experience
of helping in a legislative office,
Stanford-in-Washington (SIW)
arranged for representatives from
all aspects of official Washington
life to address the interns. As a
result, Senator Frank Church
(D-Idaho), Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development George
Romney, Congressmen Richard
Boiling (D-Mo.), F. Bradford
Morse (R-Mass.), and Deputy
Secretary of Defense David
Packard, among others, spoke to
and with students on a variety of
issues.
