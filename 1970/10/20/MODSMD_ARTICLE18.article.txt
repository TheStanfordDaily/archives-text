Communists In Thieu Regime
Compiled from the New York Times
An analysis made by the CIA last May indicates that more than 30,000
Vietnamese Communist agents have infiltrated the South Vietnamese government
in positions including an aide to President Thieu, a former province chief and high
officials of the police and of military intelligence.
Although the study does not assert the imminent failure of the South
Vietnamese government, a resurgence of Communist strength is almost certain as
US troop withdrawals proceed.
It also implies that the government has little chance of enduring over the long
run because of the great extent of Communist penetration. The New York Times
printed news of the story in Monday morning's edition.
The report suggests that Vietnamese Communists decided to shift long-range
strategy from intense military activity to political erosion, stepping up their
infiltration of secret agents into various branches of the Saigon government. The
goal is said to be 50,000 positions, or 5 percent of South Vietnamese military and
police forces.
The study was apparently based on new information about the Communist spy
organization in South Vietnam and on a fresh analysis of captured documents and
interrogations of prisoners and defectors during the last two or three years. It
questions a key aspect of US war policy—that of Vietnamization.
With characteristic optimism, high White House officials contended that the
report exaggerated the extent of infiltration, and they rejected it as inaccurate and
"overly pessimistic."
The Communist infiltration apparatus has been virtually impregnable, while the
US and Saigon have been hard pressed to keep agents alive in areas under
Communist control. The report adds that the enemy network could not exist
without the tacit complicity of the majority of South Vietnamese soldiers and
policemen. The CIA cited prevalent feelings of fear, sympathy and apathy as
evidence that the Saigon government can not command the deep loyalty of men it
depends upon for its defense.
Nixon At Ohio State
COLUMBUS — The campaigning President Nixon, decrying political terrorism and
campus violence, said Monday, "It's time to draw the line and say we're not going
to put up with this."
He strayed from his announced path almost at the start of a two-day six-state
campaign swing with a side trip to Ohio State University, scene of frequent
campus violence last spring. There he spent 25 minutes among 1 ,000 or more
students shaking hands and exchanging remarks.
Nixon, in a speech at the downtown Statehouse, dwelled on domestic violence
and student disorders.
His trip to the Ohio State campus, where National Guardsmen did two tours of
duty before it was closed in the face of violence last May, was unannounced but
students quickly flocked around him.
A loud cheer drowned out an obscene chant as Nixon climbed to the trunk of
his car, waved and reached down to shake hands with students.
"They were glad that I came," he later told newsmen.
"They wanted to talk and were willing to listen.

"I think that they are turned off this year for violence ... I am very proud of
them."
Most of the crowd cheered and applauded but one dissenting group standing to
the side chanted:
"One, two, three, four. We don't want your ... war."
The President took note when he told the gathering he knows the public is
concerned when there are shouted obscenities "such as this crowd over here is
doing."
"It is time for the great silent majority of America to stand up and be
counted."
"In any society that provides a means of peaceful change, there is no cause that
justifies resort to violence and lawlessness."
Gesturing toward his hecklers, Nixon said: "They are not the youth of America
today and they will not be the majority of the youth of America tomorrow.
Nixon's two-day swing also will bring him into North Dakota, Missouri,
Tennessee, North Carolina and Indiana.
Lindsay Endorses Goldberg
NEW YORK — Mayor John V. Lindsay, an enrolled Republican, endorsed
Democrat Arthur J. Goldberg for governor Monday, breaking with GOP Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller who is seeking a fourth term.
Lindsay, however, made it plain that he did not intend to join the Democratic
party.
"I am a Republican and I intend to remain a Republican," he told the news
conference where he made his announcement.
The mayor, who said in September he will retire from political life at the end
of his present term in 1973, told newsmen he based his endorsement on his view
of which candidate would do the most for New York Ctyy. He also said he saw the
need to fight what he called a nationwide swing to the rfght.
Lindsay has long been on the outs with Rockefeller because, in his view, the
governor failed to devote enough effort and money to the problems of the city.
Goldberg, who was present along with many supporters at the news session,
praised Lindsay for "performing an act of political courage" by endorsing the top
of the Democratic state ticket.
Gov. Rockefeller, informed that the mayor had endorsed Goldberg, shrugged it
off saying, "it's a free country."
Capital Campaign Funds
WASHINGTON — Labor groups are pumping a rich stream of campaign cash
through a hidden fund set up in the nation's capital for Sen. Harrison A. Williams,
D-N.J., who is in line to become chairman of the Senate Labor Committee if he is
re-elected.
A dozen other Senate campaigns, including those of Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D-Mont., and Minority Leader Hugh Scott, R-Pa., are also using hidden
committees to get money from both party coffers and special interest groups.
The District of Columbia does not require public disclosure of campaign
contributions raised here. As a result, so-called "D.C. committees" are now widely
used each election year by incumbent senators and congressmen.

Vietnamese Communist agents have infiltrated the South Vietnamese government
in positions including an aide to President Thieu, a former province chief and high
officials of the police and of military intelligence.
Although the study does not assert the imminent failure of the South
Vietnamese government, a resurgence of Communist strength is almost certain as
US troop withdrawals proceed.
It also implies that the government has little chance of enduring over the long
run because of the great extent of Communist penetration. The New York Times
printed news of the story in Monday morning's edition.
The report suggests that Vietnamese Communists decided to shift long-range
strategy from intense military activity to political erosion, stepping up their
infiltration of secret agents into various branches of the Saigon government. The
goal is said to be 50,000 positions, or 5 percent of South Vietnamese military and
police forces.
The study was apparently based on new information about the Communist spy
organization in South Vietnam and on a fresh analysis of captured documents and
interrogations of prisoners and defectors during the last two or three years. It
questions a key aspect of US war policy—that of Vietnamization.
With characteristic optimism, high White House officials contended that the
report exaggerated the extent of infiltration, and they rejected it as inaccurate and
"overly pessimistic."
The Communist infiltration apparatus has been virtually impregnable, while the
US and Saigon have been hard pressed to keep agents alive in areas under
Communist control. The report adds that the enemy network could not exist
without the tacit complicity of the majority of South Vietnamese soldiers and
policemen. The CIA cited prevalent feelings of fear, sympathy and apathy as
evidence that the Saigon government can not command the deep loyalty of men it
depends upon for its defense.
Nixon At Ohio State
COLUMBUS — The campaigning President Nixon, decrying political terrorism and
campus violence, said Monday, "It's time to draw the line and say we're not going
to put up with this."
He strayed from his announced path almost at the start of a two-day six-state
campaign swing with a side trip to Ohio State University, scene of frequent
campus violence last spring. There he spent 25 minutes among 1 ,000 or more
students shaking hands and exchanging remarks.
Nixon, in a speech at the downtown Statehouse, dwelled on domestic violence
and student disorders.
His trip to the Ohio State campus, where National Guardsmen did two tours of
duty before it was closed in the face of violence last May, was unannounced but
students quickly flocked around him.
A loud cheer drowned out an obscene chant as Nixon climbed to the trunk of
his car, waved and reached down to shake hands with students.
"They were glad that I came," he later told newsmen.
"They wanted to talk and were willing to listen.

"I think that they are turned off this year for violence ... I am very proud of
them."
Most of the crowd cheered and applauded but one dissenting group standing to
the side chanted:
"One, two, three, four. We don't want your ... war."
The President took note when he told the gathering he knows the public is
concerned when there are shouted obscenities "such as this crowd over here is
doing."
"It is time for the great silent majority of America to stand up and be
counted."
"In any society that provides a means of peaceful change, there is no cause that
justifies resort to violence and lawlessness."
Gesturing toward his hecklers, Nixon said: "They are not the youth of America
today and they will not be the majority of the youth of America tomorrow.
Nixon's two-day swing also will bring him into North Dakota, Missouri,
Tennessee, North Carolina and Indiana.
Lindsay Endorses Goldberg
NEW YORK — Mayor John V. Lindsay, an enrolled Republican, endorsed
Democrat Arthur J. Goldberg for governor Monday, breaking with GOP Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller who is seeking a fourth term.
Lindsay, however, made it plain that he did not intend to join the Democratic
party.
"I am a Republican and I intend to remain a Republican," he told the news
conference where he made his announcement.
The mayor, who said in September he will retire from political life at the end
of his present term in 1973, told newsmen he based his endorsement on his view
of which candidate would do the most for New York Ctyy. He also said he saw the
need to fight what he called a nationwide swing to the rfght.
Lindsay has long been on the outs with Rockefeller because, in his view, the
governor failed to devote enough effort and money to the problems of the city.
Goldberg, who was present along with many supporters at the news session,
praised Lindsay for "performing an act of political courage" by endorsing the top
of the Democratic state ticket.
Gov. Rockefeller, informed that the mayor had endorsed Goldberg, shrugged it
off saying, "it's a free country."
Capital Campaign Funds
WASHINGTON — Labor groups are pumping a rich stream of campaign cash
through a hidden fund set up in the nation's capital for Sen. Harrison A. Williams,
D-N.J., who is in line to become chairman of the Senate Labor Committee if he is
re-elected.
A dozen other Senate campaigns, including those of Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D-Mont., and Minority Leader Hugh Scott, R-Pa., are also using hidden
committees to get money from both party coffers and special interest groups.
The District of Columbia does not require public disclosure of campaign
contributions raised here. As a result, so-called "D.C. committees" are now widely
used each election year by incumbent senators and congressmen.

officials of the police and of military intelligence.
Although the study does not assert the imminent failure of the South
Vietnamese government, a resurgence of Communist strength is almost certain as
US troop withdrawals proceed.
It also implies that the government has little chance of enduring over the long
run because of the great extent of Communist penetration. The New York Times
printed news of the story in Monday morning's edition.
The report suggests that Vietnamese Communists decided to shift long-range
strategy from intense military activity to political erosion, stepping up their
infiltration of secret agents into various branches of the Saigon government. The
goal is said to be 50,000 positions, or 5 percent of South Vietnamese military and
police forces.
The study was apparently based on new information about the Communist spy
organization in South Vietnam and on a fresh analysis of captured documents and
interrogations of prisoners and defectors during the last two or three years. It
questions a key aspect of US war policy—that of Vietnamization.
With characteristic optimism, high White House officials contended that the
report exaggerated the extent of infiltration, and they rejected it as inaccurate and
"overly pessimistic."
The Communist infiltration apparatus has been virtually impregnable, while the
US and Saigon have been hard pressed to keep agents alive in areas under
Communist control. The report adds that the enemy network could not exist
without the tacit complicity of the majority of South Vietnamese soldiers and
policemen. The CIA cited prevalent feelings of fear, sympathy and apathy as
evidence that the Saigon government can not command the deep loyalty of men it
depends upon for its defense.
Nixon At Ohio State
COLUMBUS — The campaigning President Nixon, decrying political terrorism and
campus violence, said Monday, "It's time to draw the line and say we're not going
to put up with this."
He strayed from his announced path almost at the start of a two-day six-state
campaign swing with a side trip to Ohio State University, scene of frequent
campus violence last spring. There he spent 25 minutes among 1 ,000 or more
students shaking hands and exchanging remarks.
Nixon, in a speech at the downtown Statehouse, dwelled on domestic violence
and student disorders.
His trip to the Ohio State campus, where National Guardsmen did two tours of
duty before it was closed in the face of violence last May, was unannounced but
students quickly flocked around him.
A loud cheer drowned out an obscene chant as Nixon climbed to the trunk of
his car, waved and reached down to shake hands with students.
"They were glad that I came," he later told newsmen.
"They wanted to talk and were willing to listen.

"I think that they are turned off this year for violence ... I am very proud of
them."
Most of the crowd cheered and applauded but one dissenting group standing to
the side chanted:
"One, two, three, four. We don't want your ... war."
The President took note when he told the gathering he knows the public is
concerned when there are shouted obscenities "such as this crowd over here is
doing."
"It is time for the great silent majority of America to stand up and be
counted."
"In any society that provides a means of peaceful change, there is no cause that
justifies resort to violence and lawlessness."
Gesturing toward his hecklers, Nixon said: "They are not the youth of America
today and they will not be the majority of the youth of America tomorrow.
Nixon's two-day swing also will bring him into North Dakota, Missouri,
Tennessee, North Carolina and Indiana.
Lindsay Endorses Goldberg
NEW YORK — Mayor John V. Lindsay, an enrolled Republican, endorsed
Democrat Arthur J. Goldberg for governor Monday, breaking with GOP Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller who is seeking a fourth term.
Lindsay, however, made it plain that he did not intend to join the Democratic
party.
"I am a Republican and I intend to remain a Republican," he told the news
conference where he made his announcement.
The mayor, who said in September he will retire from political life at the end
of his present term in 1973, told newsmen he based his endorsement on his view
of which candidate would do the most for New York Ctyy. He also said he saw the
need to fight what he called a nationwide swing to the rfght.
Lindsay has long been on the outs with Rockefeller because, in his view, the
governor failed to devote enough effort and money to the problems of the city.
Goldberg, who was present along with many supporters at the news session,
praised Lindsay for "performing an act of political courage" by endorsing the top
of the Democratic state ticket.
Gov. Rockefeller, informed that the mayor had endorsed Goldberg, shrugged it
off saying, "it's a free country."
Capital Campaign Funds
WASHINGTON — Labor groups are pumping a rich stream of campaign cash
through a hidden fund set up in the nation's capital for Sen. Harrison A. Williams,
D-N.J., who is in line to become chairman of the Senate Labor Committee if he is
re-elected.
A dozen other Senate campaigns, including those of Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D-Mont., and Minority Leader Hugh Scott, R-Pa., are also using hidden
committees to get money from both party coffers and special interest groups.
The District of Columbia does not require public disclosure of campaign
contributions raised here. As a result, so-called "D.C. committees" are now widely
used each election year by incumbent senators and congressmen.
Communists In Thieu Regime

An analysis made by the CIA last May indicates that more than 30,000

in positions including an aide to President Thieu, a former province chief and high
officials of the police and of military intelligence.
