# Secret Draft Memo Revealed
## 
### 
Today's Daily contains the text of a
hitherto unpublished confidential
Selective Service memo proposing a
number of government
counter measures to draft resistance,
refusal, and "gaming" the draft lottery.
The memo appears to be directed at
groups like the Beaver 55 and UNDO,
anti-war groups which have already
taken direct action against draft boards.
The Selective Service officials who
wrote the memo see themselves faced
with variations on two basic forms of
anti-draft insurgency. One is illegal
physical destruction or immobilization
of various parts of the conscription
apparatus by such means as turning in
or destroying draft cards, destruction
of draft files in local board offices,
demonstrations and sit-ins at draft
boards, and "trashing" of local board
offices.
The other is abnormal utilization of

legal regular channels. Much of this
second anti-draft strategy requires
lawyers or experienced draft counselors
for its successful implementation.
Inductions can be transferred around
the country and all procedural delays
used to slow down the induction
process and confuse the bureaucracy
with its own red tape. Large numbers
of people can visit the local board
asking questions and thereby creating a
"mill-in" situation. Registrants for the
draft have been known to send their
board great quantities of material for
inclusion in the file on their case. These
and other tactics to dodge the draft and
stop its workings, the national Selective
Service is planning in the memo to
combat.
Summer Daily editor Bill Evers
obtained the memo, but wishes to keep
his source anonymous. The text of the
memo appears on page 2 .
