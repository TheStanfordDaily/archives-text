# Students Criticize Plan
## Lyman Wants Provost Soon 
### RALPH KOSTANT BILL FREIVOGEL 
President Lyman is pressing for
swift selection of a new provost, but
his efforts are running into some
student criticism.
In his pretaped weekly press
conference to be broadcast over KZSU
tonight, Lyman proposes that he
appointed both the student and faculty
members of a committee that would
consult with him over the selection of
the University's new chief academic
officer.
But last night, three student leaders
criticized the President's plan to

appoint the student consultants
without first discussing the procedure
with the ASSU Committee On
Nominations. Lyman wants to appoint
the two students from the Trustee's
Academic Affairs Committee and one
from the nominations committee to his
panel.
John Shoch, former ASSU Senate
Speaker was harshest in his criticism,
while Council of Presidents member Pat
Shea and former Daily editor Margie
Wolf added their mild objections.
Shoch stated that Lyman was
circumventing the Student Senate,
which usually appoints students to
search committees. "This is a clear
example of Lyman trying to
consolidate the power of the
President's Office," Shoch commented.
"No student can represent the
student body unless his appointment is
approved by the Senate," he
concluded.
Lyman holds that Margie Wolf and
Bob McClaine, student members of the
Academic Affairs Committee, were
named to their positions by the
Student Senate. "They were nominated
by the Committee on Nominations and
confirmed by the Senate for positions
of great responsibility," the President
commented. "As long as I can't be
accused of choosing a patsie or
weighting the committee, I don't see
why there should be any objection to
the selection of these students."
Shoch acknowledged that the
students in question were appointed to
their positions by the Senate, but said
that "they were chosen with very
specific purposes in mind."

The new Senate will not be elected
until this week, and could conceivably
take several weeks to fill the student
seats on the consulting committee.
Shoch, however, would nbt accept this
argument as justifying Lyman's action.
"Lyman's method is more
efficient," Shoch stated, "but he has
chosen to ignore completely the fact
that these things (the appointments)
aren't done that way."
Though she will be a member of the
consulting committee, Margie Wolf
expressed mild criticism of the
President's proposal. "I feel he should
have brought his plan before the
Committee on Nominations," she said.
"I understand his reasons for not
wanting to follow the normal search
procedures for student members of a
committee, and I think the Committee
would too, if he would consult them."
Shea likewise termed student
selection plan "a defensable position,
since "the matter is of an academic
nature and the people in question have
been ratified by both the Committee
on Nominations and the Student
Senate."
"The expediency necessary in
selecting the new Provost prompted
this action," Shea explained,
emphasizing that the Student Senate
"does not appear functional for the
next three weeks."
"I share John Shochs concern of
bypassing the Committee on
Nominations and Senate ratification,
but I plan on presenting this issue to
the Student Senate at its first meeting
and hope they will approve this action
in light of the circumstances," he
added.
