# Linus Pauling-Orange Juice Freak
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Few scientists believed that a lack of
vitamins could cause mental illness —
until Linus Pauling thought so.
When the 7 0-year-old winner of
both the Nobel peace and chemistry
prizes adopted that idea, other
scientists had to reconsider.
One former skeptic, Dr. Seymour
Ketz of Boston's Massachusetts General
Hospital, explained, "Anything that
Linus Pauling says should be treated
with a great deal of interest because he
has such a brilliant and provocative
mind."
As he begins his second year as a
Stanford professor, Dr. Pauling is
devoting much of his mind, time, and
influence to this new field of
"orthomolecular psychiatry."
The theory suggests mental disorders
including schizophrenia are caused by

imbalances of substances in the brain.
These may be triggered by a diet
insufficient for a particular person as
well as stress and genetic disposition.
Constantly rolling his swivel-chair
around his small office in the Stauffer
Chemistry Lab, Dr. Pauling explained
the hunches which first interested him
in such projects:
"I have a sort of general theory of

'I have a sort of general theory of the
universe. As I read I try to fit every
thing I read into the general picture.
If I read something that doesn't fit, I
wonder about it

the universe. As I read 1 try to fit
everything 1 read into the general
picture.
"If I read something that doesn't fit,
I wonder about it. Or if I think
something that seems to be now does
fit, I try to follow through."
More than fifteen years ago, studies
using niacin to treat schizophrenia
interested him in applying his skills in
chemistry and biology to mental
diseases.
When he came to Stanford from the
University of California at San Diego

last year, Pauling brought his senior
researchers with him to continue the
project.
With the help of computer analysis
they study the urine of hundreds of
subjects to learn genetic composition.
That project takes up about half of
Dr. Pauling's "scientific time." He also
continues his theoretical work on
molecular and nuclear structure.

He hinted he will soon release some
new information on the classic medical
problem: how to cure the common
cold.
Dr. Pauling explained, "My wife and
I carried on tests in our own laboratory
at home on the absorption of absorbic
acid."
In other words, he and his wife
drink a lot of orange juice. They take
three grams of Vitamin C every day,
fifty times the recommended amount.
Me points out the necessary amount
of Vitamin C may be different for each

person. But he insists the dosage he and
his wife use has warded off all colds in
the three or four years he has been
"serious" about the project.
Dr. Pauling's enthusiasm for the old
home remedy, Vitamin C goes beyond
dispassionate science. When asked his
prescription for world betterment, he
once replied, "Drink more orange
juice."
But that was not the kind of social
action that won Dr. Pauling the 1962
Nobel Peace Prize. From the time
atomic bombs were dropped on Japan
in 1 945 , Dr. Pauling has crusaded
against weapons and the arms race.
He said the public at first did not
understand the dangers of nuclear
fallout. As a scientist understanding
both the biological and physiological
risks, Pauling felt obligated to devote
half of his time to educating laymen.
"Many scientists thought of me as a
spokesman for the scientists on the
matter."
Now, when he visits a campus, he
devotes at least one speech in his
lecture series to his critique of the
military and his opposition to the
Vietnam War. He denounces the "evil
war" with the passionate
pronunciation, "ee-vill."
During last spring's Stanford
protests, Pauling expressed support for
peaceful sit-ins but opposed any
violence.
