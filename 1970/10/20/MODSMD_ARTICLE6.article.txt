# SRI At Irvine Damaged In Blast

### ED KOHN 
IRVINE, Oct. 19 - An
early-morning explosion ripped through
two greenhouses at the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) facilities here,
causing an estimated $60,U00 damage.
No one was injured in the blast,
which was caused by "some type of
device placed in one of the building's
air purifiers," according to the Orange
County Sheriff's Dept. Their
investigation was continuing tonight.
U.S. Marshals, Orange County
deputies and private guards stood over
the remains of the two 2 0 by 60-foot
greenhouses, which were described as a
"total loss" by Dale Hutchinson, SRl's
assistant executive director.
The $1 million facility was opened
in June, according to Ronald Deutsch,
SRl's manager of media relations in
Menlo Park. He said that no note
explaining the motive for the apparent
bombing was found, and that no
warning of the impending explosion
was given.
John Bull, news editor of the New
University, the UC - Irvine campus
newspaper, said that no one was
claiming credit for the explosion. The
research facility borders on the campus,
and there is no fence around the
greenhouses. SRI officials, he said, were
tight-lipped about the blast.
Agricultural Research
Deutsch said that about half of the
$60,000 loss was caused by the
destruction of the greenhouses, while
the remainder resulted from damage to
the agricultural research being
conducted. He said that the
experiments being conducted concern
certain chemicals' ability to control
plant viruses frequently found in
southern California and testing
compounds designed to improve the
yeild and quality of crops.
Deutsch said that in general the
Irvine laboratories research air and
water pollution problems.
"If there is anything related to the
Defense Department, it is
infinitesimal," he said, referring to the

Irvine operation. Leonard Seigel, a
member of the Pacific Studies Center,
said that the Defense Department did
not list SRI-Irvine as a facility handling
its research. The Associated Press also
reported that the Irvine branch has no
Defense Department contracts.
Independent
SRI, with corporate headquarters in
Menlo Park, has an annual budget of
nearly $60 million. It served all ties
with the University and bought its own
independence in an action that became
effective in May.
The Irvine branch employs about 65
people. The greenhouses are located in
an isolated area in the rear of the
facility.
SRl's Palo Alto operations were the
target of protracted student
demonstrations during Spring Quarter,
196 9 , when several hundred
demonstrators protested against
war-related Defense Department
research being conducted there.
Possible Detonator Found
Today's explosion was first reported
by a security guard in one of the
buildings in front of the greenhouses at
3:45 a.m. He went to the greenhouses,
saw the results of the blast, and phoned
the sheriff's office. At the time, he
reported a strong odor of natural gas,
Deutsch said.
Bull said that he saw deputies
examining what appeared to be a
home-made detonator and some
batteries near the demolished
greenhouses. However, deputies at the
scene refused to identify cÂ» discuss the
objects in question.
Recently, there had been rumors on
the Irvine campus that defoliation
experiments were being carried out in
the greenhouses, Bull said. However,
SRI officials denied that defoliation or
other Defense Department experiments
were being conducted in them.
Bull also said that there had been no
recent protests against the research
being carried out at the Irvine facility
and that it had not been the center of
any recent campus controversy.
