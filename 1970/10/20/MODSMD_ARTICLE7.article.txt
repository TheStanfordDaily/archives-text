# Draft Memo On Handling Protesters
## 
### 
This memorandum was prepared by the national
office of the Selective Service System for confidential
circulation among members of its Youth Advisory
Committees which met June '28 through July 2, to
discuss problems of the draft system and to draw
numbers for the 1971 lottery. This is the first time this
memorandum has been published.—Bill Evers
(This material is for discussion purposes only and
should not be released.)
In the belief that the draft should have been reformed
or eliminated years ago, individuals as well as highly
organized groups are attempting to undermine the
Selective Service System. Such groups as UNDO and
Beaver 5 5 are advocating the use of certain actions
which pose a threat to the System. Following is a
discussion of several of these techniques and possible
proposals for their correction. You are asked to evaluate
the correction measures and make your own suggestions.
(UNDO is the Union for National Draft Opposition, a
nation-wide draft resistance organization which was
founded at Princeton at the time of the Cambodia strike
last spring. The Beaver 55 is a so-called ultra-resistance
group. It has destroyed draft files at Selective Service
local boards and led a raid on Dow Chemical's
headquarters where the Beavers erased computer tapes
on which were stored all of the data from Dow's
biological and chemical warfare research
program. -Editor's Note.)
Legal Attack- The Oakland Experience
A major thrust of the resistance movement is to
destroy the draft by exploiting its reliance on the
judicial system. Oakland, California has become the
symbol of success for this effort, and resistors hope not
only to expand the Oakland experience but to duplicate
it across the country. It is believed, for instance, that
Rochester and northern Alabama are hopeful prospects.
It is a simple matter for a registrant living outside the
Bay Area to transfer his induction to Oakland with only
a one-night residency. When he then refuses induction
there, he can expect a two-year delay in his trial, by
which time the amnesty movement may save him. Even
when brought to trial, he has an excellent chance of
winning because of the excellence of a growing
fraternity of anti-draft lawyers. Even if he loses, some
judges in the district are sufficiently lenient that they
will often place the defendent on two years probation. If
they send him to jail, the average sentence is only 18
months, far less than the five-year or six-year term
permitted.
A. To prevent an increasing flow into Oakland,
Rochester, etc., it is recommended that Selective Service
tighten up residency requirements for transfers of
induction. Regulation 1632.9, which allows a transfer
only when it would otherwise work a hardship upon the

registrant and when the registrant can show "good
reason for his absence" from his local board, has
apparently become a dead letter. While Selective Service
cannot sponsor an investigative service, the regulations
place a clear burden of proof on the registrant and he
should be required to produce more than a mailing
address, e.g., proof of employment, school or other
activity in the area. In addition, if the original local
board is within a reasonable distance, the registrant
should be expected to return there unless he can
otherwise show hardship. Appeal from a denial should
be allowed to the State Director, although the
regulations do not specifically permit it.
A number of cases are now being lost because of
procedural irregularities at the local board or because
clerks and State Directors have difficulty in organizing
the cumbersome files for effective use by U.S.
Attorneys. National Headquarters could possibly help in
the preparation of files for prosecution.
C. It is imperative that State Directors, who have not
already done so, promptly insure that their local boards
are properly constituted since cases have been lost on
this basis.
D. Perhaps worthy of consideration is the notion that
either governmental Appeal Agents (perhaps on an
employed basis) or additional attorneys be hired at the
state level to give greater assistance to local clerks and
state directors (who must forward cases for prosecution
to the U.S. Attorneys' office) in resolving legal tangles.
An impressive number of lawyers are now lining up on
the other side-legal panels, for instance, in Los Angeles
and New York—and it seems unrealistic to expect the
Justice Department personnel, already under-staffed, to
balance the scales.
E. If local board clerks are to be held to standards of
excellence, administrative inspections of local boards
warrant consideration on at least an annual basis. During
this inspection, an independent team would determine
whether the local board had all required publications,
whether the board was properly constituted, whether
the clerk had particular problems that should be

considered higher up and most critically, whether the
files, checked randomly, prove that proper records are
being maintained. These inspections could be viewed not
only as a tool to improve the management but also as an
important measure for personnel advancement.
Legal 'Mill-ins' at Local Boards
Resistors believe that local board activities can easily
be disrupted on any particular day by overwhelming the
clerk with large numbers of people asking questions.
Legally, there are few solutions. One might seek
prosecution for violation of section 12(a), MSSA, but
success is unlikely. The problem really has to be solved
in a practical way.
A. Efforts can be made, for instance, to limit the
number of questioners in an office so that regular work
can continue.
B. Clerks might be instructed by the State Director to
open their doors to visitors only during specified hours,
similar to a bank. In cases of large boards, a clerk can be
posted in an outer office to answer queries.
Sit-ins, Demonstrations at Local Boards
A more serious disruption can occur when anti-draft
groups stage a sit-in within the local board or a
demonstration outside. If they in fact hinder the
processes of the board, they are in violation of the law
and, in the extreme, can be removed by the police. As
these confrontations only spawn bad publicity and more
demonstrations, however, it seems advisable to tolerate
or ignore the demonstrators as much as possible, even if
they occasionally interfere with board operations. This
tolerance does require fortitude by the clerks and State
Directors which must be encouraged by the National
Headquarters through various meetings and
communications. A limited number of these sit-ins do
not really break down the system and they are far better
than a "trashing" of the local board, which can follow
police confrontations.
Destroying Local Boards
Effective security is clearly the first step against
violence. As long as the Vietnam war continues, Beaver
55 and other groups will try to attack the "War
Machine" where it is most vulnerable, and if local draft
boards are not adequately secured, they are obvious
targets.
A. Several states are experimenting now with alarm
systems at an apparently reasonable cost. These systems
should be studied more closely at the national level and
then assistance should be given to the states to develop
their programs, particularly for the larger boards.
B. It is also possible that National Headquarters
should study alternative means and costs of duplicating
records. Microfilming and computers might offer a
solution.
Flooding Local Boards with Junk Mail
A tactic of growing popularity among resistance
groups is to deluge the local board clerk with irrelevant
materials which the sender asks to be included in his file.
There are no legal prohibitions against this move, and it
creates obvious problems for the local board.
Regulation 1641.7, which spells out status changes
which the registrant must report, does not state whether
materials can be thrown away by the board, but it is
clear that a test of relevancy can be read into the
regulation and that the irrelevant can be pushed aside. A
problem in applying the test is that during an appeal, a
registrant can claim that important materials have been
left out of his file without his knowledge.
One solution might be to establish a test of relevancy
in an institution from National Headquarters. Those
materials which were then found irrelevant by the clerk
might be returned to the sender—at his expense. As an
alternative, the board could notify the sender that the
material was irrelevant and would be held 15 days for
pick-up or destruction by the board. The major idea is to
place the burden on the sender, where it should be, and
not on the filing system of Selective Service.
Turning-in, Destroying Draft Cards
There is much hypocrisy in this area, as in the alleged
case of a registrant who obtained six draft cards so that
he could convince different friends that he was turning
his card in, but massive draft card turn-ins such as the
Charlottesville pledge are effective public symbols of
protest. Further, prosecution is now considered
impractical because of the judicial difficulties.
At least four options suggest themselves:
A. Rescind 1623.5, which requires personal
possession of SS Form 2 and Form 110. The original
purpose of the draft card was apparently to provide a
means of checking whether a young man was registered.
The only argument in favor of keeping the draft card law
is that in the event of a large anti-registration drive, the
lack of a card can be used as prime facie evidence of a
failure to register.
B. A second option is to introduce legislation which
would nullify the effect of the recent Gutknecht
decision of the Supreme Court. The case can be read to
mean that Congress did not intend to allow acceleration
of induction for delinquents. Thus a clear restatement of
Congressional intent would allow such acceleration.
C. Thirdly, impose an administrative fine for
delinquents administered by Selective Service or by
another designated agency.
D. Send the draft cards to the local draft boards for
inclusion in the registrant's file. Although no clear action
would result, it could obviously sway the board should
the registrant later ask for special consideration and

might thus be perceived as a potential threat. This, of
course, is a minimum solution and amounts to a
continuation of the present condition. It also is of
questionable legality in light of Gutknecht.
Organizing High School Students
Not to Register
The high schools offer a tempting target for
anti-establishment groups today. UNDO organizers plan
a major anti-draft campaign and attempt to persuade
high school students not to register. No one actually
knows how large the problem is. One state is apparently
running a quiet test in some areas, and its results might
be significant. But, we can be sure that if the war
continues, the difficulty will grow.
A. The first and most obvious step—one that is
needed even in the absence of an anti-draft campaign (is
a greatly expanded high school counseling program on
the opportunities of military service). High school
students are often uncertain of the possibilities and
rarely gain full understanding during their registration
visit to the draft board.

4 Effective security is clearly
the first step against violence
... if local boards are not
adequately secured, they are
obvious targets. 9

B. Concurrently, it is also possible that alternative
ways of checking individual registrations may be found.
One approach, for instance, is to provide each local
board with the list of all 18 year olds in public schools in
its jurisdiction. A second possibility is to check the files
against driver registrations and, in some states, against
voter rolls.
End-of-year Classification Problems
It is possible that many deferred registrants, wishing
to "game" the lottery, will attempt to relinquish their
deferments toward the end of 1 970, with the hope that
their limited exposure in the 1970 prime age group will
move them down to the lower priority age group for
1971. The most obvious example of this nominal
vulnerability to the 1 97 0 draft is the student who drops
out of school in December this year and who notifies his
local board that his 11-S deferment no longer applies.
With only a few days left in the 1 97 0 calendar, there is
little or no opportunity for the local board to reclassify
the registrant into I-A, wait the required length of time
for a personal appearance or appeal, order him for a
pre-induction physical examination and send out the
induction notice before the year ends. This problem,
with the many factual variations together with other
year-end loopholes, must be dealt with by National
Headquarters and local boards before the problems
surface toward the end of the year. SSS Regulation,
Section 1631.7 is at the crux of the issue.
Registrants with high random sequence numbers, who
relinquish the basis for their deferments immediately
prior to one of the last scheduled board meetings for
1970, may have an advantage under the Lottery System.
This registrant, with more knowledge and protection
than the registrant who has entered the 19 70 pool
earlier, has made the easy calculation that his random
sequence number will not be reached by his local board.
He hopes to game the system by being reclassified I-A at
the last board meeting. With this nominal exposure in
1 970, he would be assigned to a lower priority group for
1971.
A. If Selective Service wishes to maximize equity it
might instruct boards to not reclassify high number
registrants who requested I-A after a specific date(e.g.,
November 15) until the new year when they would go
into the 1971 Selective Group.
B. If the legal problems of the first alternative prove
difficult, Selective Service might request appropriate
legislation to allow it to issue the instructions
contemplated by the above alternative. This request will
obviously alert high random sequence number registrants
to the possibility for gaming the system this year.
Moreover, timely passage of the requested legislation is
not assured.
C. As an alternative to legislation, Selective Service
might seek an Executive Order, under paragraph 6(d) (3)
of the statute, amending the regulations to authorize the
Director to postpone reclassification for students coming
out of a 11-S deferment late in the year.
While an Executive Order is easier to secure than
legislation, it could not close the loophole for registrants
coming off deferments other than those classified as 11-S.
The issuance of an Executive Order on these limited
grounds might draw attention to the fact that registrants
coming off occupational deferments could not be
similarly postponed.
D. Selective Service can decide that the unfairness is
not compelling, and that no action need be taken to
prevent high random sequence number registrants from
dropping into the pool late in 1 9 70.
E. Independent of this decision, Selective Service can,
and probably should instruct boards to conscientiously
reclassify, in 1970, all registrants who reached random
sequence numbers and who no longer qualify for
deferments. They should not be allowed to "back" into
the 19 71 Selection Group.

C. It is imperative that State Directors, who have not
already done so, promptly insure that their local boards
are properly constituted since cases have been lost on
this basis.
D. Perhaps worthy of consideration is the notion that
either governmental Appeal Agents (perhaps on an
employed basis) or additional attorneys be hired at the
state level to give greater assistance to local clerks and
state directors (who must forward cases for prosecution
to the U.S. Attorneys' office) in resolving legal tangles.
An impressive number of lawyers are now lining up on
the other side-legal panels, for instance, in Los Angeles
and New York—and it seems unrealistic to expect the
Justice Department personnel, already under-staffed, to
balance the scales.
E. If local board clerks are to be held to standards of
excellence, administrative inspections of local boards
warrant consideration on at least an annual basis. During
this inspection, an independent team would determine
whether the local board had all required publications,
whether the board was properly constituted, whether
the clerk had particular problems that should be

considered higher up and most critically, whether the
files, checked randomly, prove that proper records are
being maintained. These inspections could be viewed not
only as a tool to improve the management but also as an
important measure for personnel advancement.
Legal 'Mill-ins' at Local Boards
Resistors believe that local board activities can easily
be disrupted on any particular day by overwhelming the
clerk with large numbers of people asking questions.
Legally, there are few solutions. One might seek
prosecution for violation of section 12(a), MSSA, but
success is unlikely. The problem really has to be solved
in a practical way.
A. Efforts can be made, for instance, to limit the
number of questioners in an office so that regular work
can continue.
B. Clerks might be instructed by the State Director to
open their doors to visitors only during specified hours,
similar to a bank. In cases of large boards, a clerk can be
posted in an outer office to answer queries.
Sit-ins, Demonstrations at Local Boards
A more serious disruption can occur when anti-draft
groups stage a sit-in within the local board or a
demonstration outside. If they in fact hinder the
processes of the board, they are in violation of the law
and, in the extreme, can be removed by the police. As
these confrontations only spawn bad publicity and more
demonstrations, however, it seems advisable to tolerate
or ignore the demonstrators as much as possible, even if
they occasionally interfere with board operations. This
tolerance does require fortitude by the clerks and State
Directors which must be encouraged by the National
Headquarters through various meetings and
communications. A limited number of these sit-ins do
not really break down the system and they are far better
than a "trashing" of the local board, which can follow
police confrontations.
Destroying Local Boards
Effective security is clearly the first step against
violence. As long as the Vietnam war continues, Beaver
55 and other groups will try to attack the "War
Machine" where it is most vulnerable, and if local draft
boards are not adequately secured, they are obvious
targets.
A. Several states are experimenting now with alarm
systems at an apparently reasonable cost. These systems
should be studied more closely at the national level and
then assistance should be given to the states to develop
their programs, particularly for the larger boards.
B. It is also possible that National Headquarters
should study alternative means and costs of duplicating
records. Microfilming and computers might offer a
solution.
Flooding Local Boards with Junk Mail
A tactic of growing popularity among resistance
groups is to deluge the local board clerk with irrelevant
materials which the sender asks to be included in his file.
There are no legal prohibitions against this move, and it
creates obvious problems for the local board.
Regulation 1641.7, which spells out status changes
which the registrant must report, does not state whether
materials can be thrown away by the board, but it is
clear that a test of relevancy can be read into the
regulation and that the irrelevant can be pushed aside. A
problem in applying the test is that during an appeal, a
registrant can claim that important materials have been
left out of his file without his knowledge.
One solution might be to establish a test of relevancy
in an institution from National Headquarters. Those
materials which were then found irrelevant by the clerk
might be returned to the sender—at his expense. As an
alternative, the board could notify the sender that the
material was irrelevant and would be held 15 days for
pick-up or destruction by the board. The major idea is to
place the burden on the sender, where it should be, and
not on the filing system of Selective Service.
Turning-in, Destroying Draft Cards
There is much hypocrisy in this area, as in the alleged
case of a registrant who obtained six draft cards so that
he could convince different friends that he was turning
his card in, but massive draft card turn-ins such as the
Charlottesville pledge are effective public symbols of
protest. Further, prosecution is now considered
impractical because of the judicial difficulties.
At least four options suggest themselves:
A. Rescind 1623.5, which requires personal
possession of SS Form 2 and Form 110. The original
purpose of the draft card was apparently to provide a
means of checking whether a young man was registered.
The only argument in favor of keeping the draft card law
is that in the event of a large anti-registration drive, the
lack of a card can be used as prime facie evidence of a
failure to register.
B. A second option is to introduce legislation which
would nullify the effect of the recent Gutknecht
decision of the Supreme Court. The case can be read to
mean that Congress did not intend to allow acceleration
of induction for delinquents. Thus a clear restatement of
Congressional intent would allow such acceleration.
C. Thirdly, impose an administrative fine for
delinquents administered by Selective Service or by
another designated agency.
D. Send the draft cards to the local draft boards for
inclusion in the registrant's file. Although no clear action
would result, it could obviously sway the board should
the registrant later ask for special consideration and

might thus be perceived as a potential threat. This, of
course, is a minimum solution and amounts to a
continuation of the present condition. It also is of
questionable legality in light of Gutknecht.
Organizing High School Students
Not to Register
The high schools offer a tempting target for
anti-establishment groups today. UNDO organizers plan
a major anti-draft campaign and attempt to persuade
high school students not to register. No one actually
knows how large the problem is. One state is apparently
running a quiet test in some areas, and its results might
be significant. But, we can be sure that if the war
continues, the difficulty will grow.
A. The first and most obvious step—one that is
needed even in the absence of an anti-draft campaign (is
a greatly expanded high school counseling program on
the opportunities of military service). High school
students are often uncertain of the possibilities and
rarely gain full understanding during their registration
visit to the draft board.

4 Effective security is clearly
the first step against violence
... if local boards are not
adequately secured, they are
obvious targets. 9

B. Concurrently, it is also possible that alternative
ways of checking individual registrations may be found.
One approach, for instance, is to provide each local
board with the list of all 18 year olds in public schools in
its jurisdiction. A second possibility is to check the files
against driver registrations and, in some states, against
voter rolls.
End-of-year Classification Problems
It is possible that many deferred registrants, wishing
to "game" the lottery, will attempt to relinquish their
deferments toward the end of 1 970, with the hope that
their limited exposure in the 1970 prime age group will
move them down to the lower priority age group for
1971. The most obvious example of this nominal
vulnerability to the 1 97 0 draft is the student who drops
out of school in December this year and who notifies his
local board that his 11-S deferment no longer applies.
With only a few days left in the 1 97 0 calendar, there is
little or no opportunity for the local board to reclassify
the registrant into I-A, wait the required length of time
for a personal appearance or appeal, order him for a
pre-induction physical examination and send out the
induction notice before the year ends. This problem,
with the many factual variations together with other
year-end loopholes, must be dealt with by National
Headquarters and local boards before the problems
surface toward the end of the year. SSS Regulation,
Section 1631.7 is at the crux of the issue.
Registrants with high random sequence numbers, who
relinquish the basis for their deferments immediately
prior to one of the last scheduled board meetings for
1970, may have an advantage under the Lottery System.
This registrant, with more knowledge and protection
than the registrant who has entered the 19 70 pool
earlier, has made the easy calculation that his random
sequence number will not be reached by his local board.
He hopes to game the system by being reclassified I-A at
the last board meeting. With this nominal exposure in
1 970, he would be assigned to a lower priority group for
1971.
A. If Selective Service wishes to maximize equity it
might instruct boards to not reclassify high number
registrants who requested I-A after a specific date(e.g.,
November 15) until the new year when they would go
into the 1971 Selective Group.
B. If the legal problems of the first alternative prove
difficult, Selective Service might request appropriate
legislation to allow it to issue the instructions
contemplated by the above alternative. This request will
obviously alert high random sequence number registrants
to the possibility for gaming the system this year.
Moreover, timely passage of the requested legislation is
not assured.
C. As an alternative to legislation, Selective Service
might seek an Executive Order, under paragraph 6(d) (3)
of the statute, amending the regulations to authorize the
Director to postpone reclassification for students coming
out of a 11-S deferment late in the year.
While an Executive Order is easier to secure than
legislation, it could not close the loophole for registrants
coming off deferments other than those classified as 11-S.
The issuance of an Executive Order on these limited
grounds might draw attention to the fact that registrants
coming off occupational deferments could not be
similarly postponed.
D. Selective Service can decide that the unfairness is
not compelling, and that no action need be taken to
prevent high random sequence number registrants from
dropping into the pool late in 1 9 70.
E. Independent of this decision, Selective Service can,
and probably should instruct boards to conscientiously
reclassify, in 1970, all registrants who reached random
sequence numbers and who no longer qualify for
deferments. They should not be allowed to "back" into
the 19 71 Selection Group.
This memorandum was prepared by the national
office of the Selective Service System for confidential
circulation among members of its Youth Advisory
Committees which met June '28 through July 2, to
discuss problems of the draft system and to draw
numbers for the 1971 lottery. This is the first time this
memorandum has been published.—Bill Evers
(This material is for discussion purposes only and
should not be released.)
In the belief that the draft should have been reformed
or eliminated years ago, individuals as well as highly
organized groups are attempting to undermine the
Selective Service System. Such groups as UNDO and
Beaver 5 5 are advocating the use of certain actions
which pose a threat to the System. Following is a
discussion of several of these techniques and possible
proposals for their correction. You are asked to evaluate
the correction measures and make your own suggestions.
(UNDO is the Union for National Draft Opposition, a
nation-wide draft resistance organization which was
founded at Princeton at the time of the Cambodia strike
last spring. The Beaver 55 is a so-called ultra-resistance
group. It has destroyed draft files at Selective Service
local boards and led a raid on Dow Chemical's
headquarters where the Beavers erased computer tapes
on which were stored all of the data from Dow's
biological and chemical warfare research
program. -Editor's Note.)
Legal Attack- The Oakland Experience
A major thrust of the resistance movement is to
destroy the draft by exploiting its reliance on the
judicial system. Oakland, California has become the
symbol of success for this effort, and resistors hope not
only to expand the Oakland experience but to duplicate
it across the country. It is believed, for instance, that
Rochester and northern Alabama are hopeful prospects.
It is a simple matter for a registrant living outside the
Bay Area to transfer his induction to Oakland with only
a one-night residency. When he then refuses induction
there, he can expect a two-year delay in his trial, by
which time the amnesty movement may save him. Even
when brought to trial, he has an excellent chance of
winning because of the excellence of a growing
fraternity of anti-draft lawyers. Even if he loses, some
judges in the district are sufficiently lenient that they
will often place the defendent on two years probation. If
they send him to jail, the average sentence is only 18
months, far less than the five-year or six-year term
permitted.
A. To prevent an increasing flow into Oakland,
Rochester, etc., it is recommended that Selective Service
tighten up residency requirements for transfers of
induction. Regulation 1632.9, which allows a transfer
only when it would otherwise work a hardship upon the

registrant and when the registrant can show "good
reason for his absence" from his local board, has
apparently become a dead letter. While Selective Service
cannot sponsor an investigative service, the regulations
place a clear burden of proof on the registrant and he
should be required to produce more than a mailing
address, e.g., proof of employment, school or other
activity in the area. In addition, if the original local
board is within a reasonable distance, the registrant
should be expected to return there unless he can
otherwise show hardship. Appeal from a denial should
be allowed to the State Director, although the
regulations do not specifically permit it.
A number of cases are now being lost because of
procedural irregularities at the local board or because
clerks and State Directors have difficulty in organizing
the cumbersome files for effective use by U.S.
Attorneys. National Headquarters could possibly help in
the preparation of files for prosecution.
C. It is imperative that State Directors, who have not
already done so, promptly insure that their local boards
are properly constituted since cases have been lost on
this basis.
D. Perhaps worthy of consideration is the notion that
either governmental Appeal Agents (perhaps on an

materials which the sender asks to be included in his file.
There are no legal prohibitions against this move, and it
creates obvious problems for the local board.
Regulation 1641.7, which spells out status changes
which the registrant must report, does not state whether
materials can be thrown away by the board, but it is
clear that a test of relevancy can be read into the
regulation and that the irrelevant can be pushed aside. A
problem in applying the test is that during an appeal, a
registrant can claim that important materials have been
left out of his file without his knowledge.
One solution might be to establish a test of relevancy
in an institution from National Headquarters. Those
materials which were then found irrelevant by the clerk
might be returned to the sender—at his expense. As an
alternative, the board could notify the sender that the
material was irrelevant and would be held 15 days for
pick-up or destruction by the board. The major idea is to
place the burden on the sender, where it should be, and
not on the filing system of Selective Service.
Turning-in, Destroying Draft Cards
There is much hypocrisy in this area, as in the alleged
case of a registrant who obtained six draft cards so that
he could convince different friends that he was turning
his card in, but massive draft card turn-ins such as the
Charlottesville pledge are effective public symbols of
protest. Further, prosecution is now considered
impractical because of the judicial difficulties.
At least four options suggest themselves:
A. Rescind 1623.5, which requires personal
possession of SS Form 2 and Form 110. The original
purpose of the draft card was apparently to provide a
means of checking whether a young man was registered.
The only argument in favor of keeping the draft card law
is that in the event of a large anti-registration drive, the
lack of a card can be used as prime facie evidence of a
failure to register.
B. A second option is to introduce legislation which
would nullify the effect of the recent Gutknecht
decision of the Supreme Court. The case can be read to
mean that Congress did not intend to allow acceleration
of induction for delinquents. Thus a clear restatement of
Congressional intent would allow such acceleration.
C. Thirdly, impose an administrative fine for
delinquents administered by Selective Service or by
another designated agency.
D. Send the draft cards to the local draft boards for
inclusion in the registrant's file. Although no clear action
would result, it could obviously sway the board should
the registrant later ask for special consideration and

might thus be perceived as a potential threat. This, of
course, is a minimum solution and amounts to a
continuation of the present condition. It also is of
questionable legality in light of Gutknecht.
Organizing High School Students
Not to Register
The high schools offer a tempting target for
anti-establishment groups today. UNDO organizers plan
a major anti-draft campaign and attempt to persuade
high school students not to register. No one actually
knows how large the problem is. One state is apparently
running a quiet test in some areas, and its results might
be significant. But, we can be sure that if the war
continues, the difficulty will grow.
A. The first and most obvious step—one that is
needed even in the absence of an anti-draft campaign (is
a greatly expanded high school counseling program on
the opportunities of military service). High school
students are often uncertain of the possibilities and
rarely gain full understanding during their registration
visit to the draft board.

4 Effective security is clearly
the first step against violence
... if local boards are not
adequately secured, they are
obvious targets. 9

B. Concurrently, it is also possible that alternative
ways of checking individual registrations may be found.
One approach, for instance, is to provide each local
board with the list of all 18 year olds in public schools in
its jurisdiction. A second possibility is to check the files
against driver registrations and, in some states, against
voter rolls.
End-of-year Classification Problems
It is possible that many deferred registrants, wishing
to "game" the lottery, will attempt to relinquish their
deferments toward the end of 1 970, with the hope that
their limited exposure in the 1970 prime age group will
move them down to the lower priority age group for
1971. The most obvious example of this nominal
vulnerability to the 1 97 0 draft is the student who drops
out of school in December this year and who notifies his
local board that his 11-S deferment no longer applies.
With only a few days left in the 1 97 0 calendar, there is
little or no opportunity for the local board to reclassify
the registrant into I-A, wait the required length of time
for a personal appearance or appeal, order him for a
pre-induction physical examination and send out the
induction notice before the year ends. This problem,
with the many factual variations together with other
year-end loopholes, must be dealt with by National
Headquarters and local boards before the problems
surface toward the end of the year. SSS Regulation,
Section 1631.7 is at the crux of the issue.
Registrants with high random sequence numbers, who
relinquish the basis for their deferments immediately
prior to one of the last scheduled board meetings for
1970, may have an advantage under the Lottery System.
This registrant, with more knowledge and protection
than the registrant who has entered the 19 70 pool
earlier, has made the easy calculation that his random
sequence number will not be reached by his local board.
He hopes to game the system by being reclassified I-A at
the last board meeting. With this nominal exposure in
1 970, he would be assigned to a lower priority group for
1971.
A. If Selective Service wishes to maximize equity it
might instruct boards to not reclassify high number
registrants who requested I-A after a specific date(e.g.,
November 15) until the new year when they would go
into the 1971 Selective Group.
B. If the legal problems of the first alternative prove
difficult, Selective Service might request appropriate
legislation to allow it to issue the instructions
contemplated by the above alternative. This request will
obviously alert high random sequence number registrants
to the possibility for gaming the system this year.
Moreover, timely passage of the requested legislation is
not assured.
C. As an alternative to legislation, Selective Service
might seek an Executive Order, under paragraph 6(d) (3)
of the statute, amending the regulations to authorize the
Director to postpone reclassification for students coming
out of a 11-S deferment late in the year.
While an Executive Order is easier to secure than
legislation, it could not close the loophole for registrants
coming off deferments other than those classified as 11-S.
The issuance of an Executive Order on these limited
grounds might draw attention to the fact that registrants
coming off occupational deferments could not be
similarly postponed.
D. Selective Service can decide that the unfairness is
not compelling, and that no action need be taken to
prevent high random sequence number registrants from
dropping into the pool late in 1 9 70.
E. Independent of this decision, Selective Service can,
and probably should instruct boards to conscientiously
reclassify, in 1970, all registrants who reached random
sequence numbers and who no longer qualify for
deferments. They should not be allowed to "back" into
the 19 71 Selection Group.
This memorandum was prepared by the national
office of the Selective Service System for confidential
circulation among members of its Youth Advisory
Committees which met June '28 through July 2, to
discuss problems of the draft system and to draw
numbers for the 1971 lottery. This is the first time this
memorandum has been published.—Bill Evers
(This material is for discussion purposes only and
should not be released.)
In the belief that the draft should have been reformed
or eliminated years ago, individuals as well as highly
organized groups are attempting to undermine the
Selective Service System. Such groups as UNDO and
Beaver 5 5 are advocating the use of certain actions
which pose a threat to the System. Following is a
discussion of several of these techniques and possible
proposals for their correction. You are asked to evaluate
the correction measures and make your own suggestions.
(UNDO is the Union for National Draft Opposition, a
nation-wide draft resistance organization which was
founded at Princeton at the time of the Cambodia strike
last spring. The Beaver 55 is a so-called ultra-resistance
group. It has destroyed draft files at Selective Service
local boards and led a raid on Dow Chemical's
headquarters where the Beavers erased computer tapes
on which were stored all of the data from Dow's
biological and chemical warfare research
program. -Editor's Note.)
Legal Attack- The Oakland Experience
A major thrust of the resistance movement is to
destroy the draft by exploiting its reliance on the
judicial system. Oakland, California has become the
symbol of success for this effort, and resistors hope not
only to expand the Oakland experience but to duplicate
it across the country. It is believed, for instance, that
Rochester and northern Alabama are hopeful prospects.
It is a simple matter for a registrant living outside the
Bay Area to transfer his induction to Oakland with only
a one-night residency. When he then refuses induction
there, he can expect a two-year delay in his trial, by
which time the amnesty movement may save him. Even
when brought to trial, he has an excellent chance of
winning because of the excellence of a growing
fraternity of anti-draft lawyers. Even if he loses, some
judges in the district are sufficiently lenient that they
will often place the defendent on two years probation. If
they send him to jail, the average sentence is only 18
months, far less than the five-year or six-year term
permitted.
A. To prevent an increasing flow into Oakland,
Rochester, etc., it is recommended that Selective Service
tighten up residency requirements for transfers of
induction. Regulation 1632.9, which allows a transfer
only when it would otherwise work a hardship upon the

registrant and when the registrant can show "good
reason for his absence" from his local board, has
apparently become a dead letter. While Selective Service
cannot sponsor an investigative service, the regulations
place a clear burden of proof on the registrant and he
should be required to produce more than a mailing
address, e.g., proof of employment, school or other
activity in the area. In addition, if the original local
board is within a reasonable distance, the registrant
should be expected to return there unless he can
otherwise show hardship. Appeal from a denial should
be allowed to the State Director, although the
regulations do not specifically permit it.
A number of cases are now being lost because of
procedural irregularities at the local board or because
clerks and State Directors have difficulty in organizing
the cumbersome files for effective use by U.S.
Attorneys. National Headquarters could possibly help in
the preparation of files for prosecution.
C. It is imperative that State Directors, who have not
already done so, promptly insure that their local boards
are properly constituted since cases have been lost on
this basis.
D. Perhaps worthy of consideration is the notion that
either governmental Appeal Agents (perhaps on an
employed basis) or additional attorneys be hired at the
state level to give greater assistance to local clerks and
state directors (who must forward cases for prosecution
to the U.S. Attorneys' office) in resolving legal tangles.
An impressive number of lawyers are now lining up on
the other side-legal panels, for instance, in Los Angeles
and New York—and it seems unrealistic to expect the
Justice Department personnel, already under-staffed, to
balance the scales.
E. If local board clerks are to be held to standards of
excellence, administrative inspections of local boards
warrant consideration on at least an annual basis. During
this inspection, an independent team would determine
whether the local board had all required publications,
whether the board was properly constituted, whether
the clerk had particular problems that should be

considered higher up and most critically, whether the
files, checked randomly, prove that proper records are
being maintained. These inspections could be viewed not
only as a tool to improve the management but also as an
important measure for personnel advancement.
Legal 'Mill-ins' at Local Boards
Resistors believe that local board activities can easily
be disrupted on any particular day by overwhelming the
clerk with large numbers of people asking questions.
Legally, there are few solutions. One might seek
prosecution for violation of section 12(a), MSSA, but
success is unlikely. The problem really has to be solved
in a practical way.
A. Efforts can be made, for instance, to limit the
number of questioners in an office so that regular work
can continue.
B. Clerks might be instructed by the State Director to
open their doors to visitors only during specified hours,
similar to a bank. In cases of large boards, a clerk can be
posted in an outer office to answer queries.
Sit-ins, Demonstrations at Local Boards
A more serious disruption can occur when anti-draft
groups stage a sit-in within the local board or a
demonstration outside. If they in fact hinder the
processes of the board, they are in violation of the law
and, in the extreme, can be removed by the police. As
these confrontations only spawn bad publicity and more
demonstrations, however, it seems advisable to tolerate
or ignore the demonstrators as much as possible, even if
they occasionally interfere with board operations. This
tolerance does require fortitude by the clerks and State
Directors which must be encouraged by the National
Headquarters through various meetings and
communications. A limited number of these sit-ins do
not really break down the system and they are far better
than a "trashing" of the local board, which can follow
police confrontations.
Destroying Local Boards
Effective security is clearly the first step against
violence. As long as the Vietnam war continues, Beaver
55 and other groups will try to attack the "War
Machine" where it is most vulnerable, and if local draft
boards are not adequately secured, they are obvious
targets.
A. Several states are experimenting now with alarm
systems at an apparently reasonable cost. These systems
should be studied more closely at the national level and
then assistance should be given to the states to develop
their programs, particularly for the larger boards.
B. It is also possible that National Headquarters
should study alternative means and costs of duplicating
records. Microfilming and computers might offer a
solution.
Flooding Local Boards with Junk Mail
A tactic of growing popularity among resistance
groups is to deluge the local board clerk with irrelevant
materials which the sender asks to be included in his file.
There are no legal prohibitions against this move, and it

B. Concurrently, it is also possible that alternative
ways of checking individual registrations may be found.
One approach, for instance, is to provide each local
board with the list of all 18 year olds in public schools in
its jurisdiction. A second possibility is to check the files
against driver registrations and, in some states, against
voter rolls.
End-of-year Classification Problems
It is possible that many deferred registrants, wishing
to "game" the lottery, will attempt to relinquish their
deferments toward the end of 1 970, with the hope that
their limited exposure in the 1970 prime age group will
move them down to the lower priority age group for
1971. The most obvious example of this nominal
vulnerability to the 1 97 0 draft is the student who drops
out of school in December this year and who notifies his
local board that his 11-S deferment no longer applies.
With only a few days left in the 1 97 0 calendar, there is
little or no opportunity for the local board to reclassify
the registrant into I-A, wait the required length of time
for a personal appearance or appeal, order him for a
pre-induction physical examination and send out the
induction notice before the year ends. This problem,
with the many factual variations together with other
year-end loopholes, must be dealt with by National
Headquarters and local boards before the problems
surface toward the end of the year. SSS Regulation,
Section 1631.7 is at the crux of the issue.
Registrants with high random sequence numbers, who
relinquish the basis for their deferments immediately
prior to one of the last scheduled board meetings for
1970, may have an advantage under the Lottery System.
This registrant, with more knowledge and protection
than the registrant who has entered the 19 70 pool
earlier, has made the easy calculation that his random
sequence number will not be reached by his local board.
He hopes to game the system by being reclassified I-A at
the last board meeting. With this nominal exposure in
1 970, he would be assigned to a lower priority group for
1971.
A. If Selective Service wishes to maximize equity it
might instruct boards to not reclassify high number
registrants who requested I-A after a specific date(e.g.,
November 15) until the new year when they would go
into the 1971 Selective Group.
B. If the legal problems of the first alternative prove
difficult, Selective Service might request appropriate
legislation to allow it to issue the instructions
contemplated by the above alternative. This request will
obviously alert high random sequence number registrants
to the possibility for gaming the system this year.
Moreover, timely passage of the requested legislation is
not assured.
C. As an alternative to legislation, Selective Service
might seek an Executive Order, under paragraph 6(d) (3)
of the statute, amending the regulations to authorize the
Director to postpone reclassification for students coming
out of a 11-S deferment late in the year.
While an Executive Order is easier to secure than
legislation, it could not close the loophole for registrants
coming off deferments other than those classified as 11-S.
The issuance of an Executive Order on these limited
grounds might draw attention to the fact that registrants
coming off occupational deferments could not be
similarly postponed.
D. Selective Service can decide that the unfairness is
not compelling, and that no action need be taken to
prevent high random sequence number registrants from
dropping into the pool late in 1 9 70.
E. Independent of this decision, Selective Service can,
and probably should instruct boards to conscientiously
reclassify, in 1970, all registrants who reached random
sequence numbers and who no longer qualify for
deferments. They should not be allowed to "back" into
the 19 71 Selection Group.
This memorandum was prepared by the national
office of the Selective Service System for confidential
circulation among members of its Youth Advisory
Committees which met June '28 through July 2, to
discuss problems of the draft system and to draw
numbers for the 1971 lottery. This is the first time this
memorandum has been published.—Bill Evers
(This material is for discussion purposes only and
should not be released.)
In the belief that the draft should have been reformed
or eliminated years ago, individuals as well as highly
organized groups are attempting to undermine the
Selective Service System. Such groups as UNDO and
Beaver 5 5 are advocating the use of certain actions
which pose a threat to the System. Following is a
discussion of several of these techniques and possible
proposals for their correction. You are asked to evaluate
the correction measures and make your own suggestions.
(UNDO is the Union for National Draft Opposition, a
nation-wide draft resistance organization which was
founded at Princeton at the time of the Cambodia strike
last spring. The Beaver 55 is a so-called ultra-resistance
group. It has destroyed draft files at Selective Service
local boards and led a raid on Dow Chemical's
headquarters where the Beavers erased computer tapes
on which were stored all of the data from Dow's
biological and chemical warfare research
program. -Editor's Note.)
Legal Attack- The Oakland Experience
A major thrust of the resistance movement is to
destroy the draft by exploiting its reliance on the
judicial system. Oakland, California has become the
symbol of success for this effort, and resistors hope not
only to expand the Oakland experience but to duplicate
it across the country. It is believed, for instance, that
Rochester and northern Alabama are hopeful prospects.
It is a simple matter for a registrant living outside the
Bay Area to transfer his induction to Oakland with only
a one-night residency. When he then refuses induction
there, he can expect a two-year delay in his trial, by
which time the amnesty movement may save him. Even
when brought to trial, he has an excellent chance of
winning because of the excellence of a growing
fraternity of anti-draft lawyers. Even if he loses, some
judges in the district are sufficiently lenient that they
will often place the defendent on two years probation. If
they send him to jail, the average sentence is only 18
months, far less than the five-year or six-year term
permitted.
A. To prevent an increasing flow into Oakland,
Rochester, etc., it is recommended that Selective Service
tighten up residency requirements for transfers of
induction. Regulation 1632.9, which allows a transfer
only when it would otherwise work a hardship upon the

registrant and when the registrant can show "good
reason for his absence" from his local board, has
apparently become a dead letter. While Selective Service
cannot sponsor an investigative service, the regulations
place a clear burden of proof on the registrant and he
should be required to produce more than a mailing
address, e.g., proof of employment, school or other
activity in the area. In addition, if the original local
board is within a reasonable distance, the registrant
should be expected to return there unless he can
otherwise show hardship. Appeal from a denial should
be allowed to the State Director, although the
regulations do not specifically permit it.
A number of cases are now being lost because of
procedural irregularities at the local board or because
clerks and State Directors have difficulty in organizing
the cumbersome files for effective use by U.S.
Attorneys. National Headquarters could possibly help in
the preparation of files for prosecution.
C. It is imperative that State Directors, who have not
already done so, promptly insure that their local boards
are properly constituted since cases have been lost on
this basis.
D. Perhaps worthy of consideration is the notion that
either governmental Appeal Agents (perhaps on an
employed basis) or additional attorneys be hired at the
state level to give greater assistance to local clerks and
state directors (who must forward cases for prosecution
to the U.S. Attorneys' office) in resolving legal tangles.
An impressive number of lawyers are now lining up on
the other side-legal panels, for instance, in Los Angeles
and New York—and it seems unrealistic to expect the
Justice Department personnel, already under-staffed, to
balance the scales.
E. If local board clerks are to be held to standards of
excellence, administrative inspections of local boards
warrant consideration on at least an annual basis. During
this inspection, an independent team would determine
whether the local board had all required publications,
whether the board was properly constituted, whether
the clerk had particular problems that should be

considered higher up and most critically, whether the
files, checked randomly, prove that proper records are
being maintained. These inspections could be viewed not
only as a tool to improve the management but also as an
important measure for personnel advancement.
Legal 'Mill-ins' at Local Boards
Resistors believe that local board activities can easily
be disrupted on any particular day by overwhelming the
clerk with large numbers of people asking questions.
Legally, there are few solutions. One might seek
prosecution for violation of section 12(a), MSSA, but
success is unlikely. The problem really has to be solved
in a practical way.
A. Efforts can be made, for instance, to limit the
number of questioners in an office so that regular work
can continue.
B. Clerks might be instructed by the State Director to
open their doors to visitors only during specified hours,
similar to a bank. In cases of large boards, a clerk can be
posted in an outer office to answer queries.
Sit-ins, Demonstrations at Local Boards
A more serious disruption can occur when anti-draft
groups stage a sit-in within the local board or a
demonstration outside. If they in fact hinder the
processes of the board, they are in violation of the law
and, in the extreme, can be removed by the police. As
these confrontations only spawn bad publicity and more
demonstrations, however, it seems advisable to tolerate
or ignore the demonstrators as much as possible, even if
they occasionally interfere with board operations. This
tolerance does require fortitude by the clerks and State
Directors which must be encouraged by the National
Headquarters through various meetings and
communications. A limited number of these sit-ins do
not really break down the system and they are far better
than a "trashing" of the local board, which can follow
police confrontations.
Destroying Local Boards
Effective security is clearly the first step against
violence. As long as the Vietnam war continues, Beaver
55 and other groups will try to attack the "War
Machine" where it is most vulnerable, and if local draft
boards are not adequately secured, they are obvious
targets.
A. Several states are experimenting now with alarm
systems at an apparently reasonable cost. These systems
should be studied more closely at the national level and
then assistance should be given to the states to develop
their programs, particularly for the larger boards.
B. It is also possible that National Headquarters
should study alternative means and costs of duplicating
records. Microfilming and computers might offer a
solution.
Flooding Local Boards with Junk Mail
A tactic of growing popularity among resistance
groups is to deluge the local board clerk with irrelevant
materials which the sender asks to be included in his file.
There are no legal prohibitions against this move, and it
creates obvious problems for the local board.
Regulation 1641.7, which spells out status changes
which the registrant must report, does not state whether
materials can be thrown away by the board, but it is
clear that a test of relevancy can be read into the
regulation and that the irrelevant can be pushed aside. A
problem in applying the test is that during an appeal, a
registrant can claim that important materials have been
left out of his file without his knowledge.
One solution might be to establish a test of relevancy
in an institution from National Headquarters. Those
materials which were then found irrelevant by the clerk
might be returned to the sender—at his expense. As an
alternative, the board could notify the sender that the
material was irrelevant and would be held 15 days for
pick-up or destruction by the board. The major idea is to
place the burden on the sender, where it should be, and
not on the filing system of Selective Service.
Turning-in, Destroying Draft Cards
There is much hypocrisy in this area, as in the alleged
case of a registrant who obtained six draft cards so that
he could convince different friends that he was turning
his card in, but massive draft card turn-ins such as the
Charlottesville pledge are effective public symbols of
protest. Further, prosecution is now considered
impractical because of the judicial difficulties.
At least four options suggest themselves:
A. Rescind 1623.5, which requires personal
possession of SS Form 2 and Form 110. The original
purpose of the draft card was apparently to provide a
means of checking whether a young man was registered.
The only argument in favor of keeping the draft card law
is that in the event of a large anti-registration drive, the
lack of a card can be used as prime facie evidence of a
failure to register.
B. A second option is to introduce legislation which
would nullify the effect of the recent Gutknecht
decision of the Supreme Court. The case can be read to
mean that Congress did not intend to allow acceleration
of induction for delinquents. Thus a clear restatement of
Congressional intent would allow such acceleration.
C. Thirdly, impose an administrative fine for
delinquents administered by Selective Service or by
another designated agency.
D. Send the draft cards to the local draft boards for
inclusion in the registrant's file. Although no clear action
would result, it could obviously sway the board should
the registrant later ask for special consideration and

might thus be perceived as a potential threat. This, of
course, is a minimum solution and amounts to a
continuation of the present condition. It also is of
questionable legality in light of Gutknecht.
Organizing High School Students
Not to Register
The high schools offer a tempting target for
anti-establishment groups today. UNDO organizers plan
a major anti-draft campaign and attempt to persuade
high school students not to register. No one actually
knows how large the problem is. One state is apparently
running a quiet test in some areas, and its results might
be significant. But, we can be sure that if the war
continues, the difficulty will grow.
A. The first and most obvious step—one that is
needed even in the absence of an anti-draft campaign (is
a greatly expanded high school counseling program on
the opportunities of military service). High school
students are often uncertain of the possibilities and
rarely gain full understanding during their registration
visit to the draft board.

E. Independent of this decision, Selective Service can,
and probably should instruct boards to conscientiously
reclassify, in 1970, all registrants who reached random
sequence numbers and who no longer qualify for
deferments. They should not be allowed to "back" into
the 19 71 Selection Group.
This memorandum was prepared by the national
office of the Selective Service System for confidential
circulation among members of its Youth Advisory
Committees which met June '28 through July 2, to
discuss problems of the draft system and to draw
numbers for the 1971 lottery. This is the first time this
memorandum has been published.—Bill Evers

In the belief that the draft should have been reformed
or eliminated years ago, individuals as well as highly
organized groups are attempting to undermine the
Selective Service System. Such groups as UNDO and
Beaver 5 5 are advocating the use of certain actions
which pose a threat to the System. Following is a
discussion of several of these techniques and possible
proposals for their correction. You are asked to evaluate
the correction measures and make your own suggestions.
(UNDO is the Union for National Draft Opposition, a
nation-wide draft resistance organization which was
founded at Princeton at the time of the Cambodia strike
last spring. The Beaver 55 is a so-called ultra-resistance
group. It has destroyed draft files at Selective Service
local boards and led a raid on Dow Chemical's
headquarters where the Beavers erased computer tapes
on which were stored all of the data from Dow's
biological and chemical warfare research
program. -Editor's Note.)
Legal Attack- The Oakland Experience
A major thrust of the resistance movement is to
destroy the draft by exploiting its reliance on the
judicial system. Oakland, California has become the
symbol of success for this effort, and resistors hope not
only to expand the Oakland experience but to duplicate
it across the country. It is believed, for instance, that
Rochester and northern Alabama are hopeful prospects.
It is a simple matter for a registrant living outside the
Bay Area to transfer his induction to Oakland with only
a one-night residency. When he then refuses induction
there, he can expect a two-year delay in his trial, by
which time the amnesty movement may save him. Even
when brought to trial, he has an excellent chance of
winning because of the excellence of a growing
fraternity of anti-draft lawyers. Even if he loses, some
judges in the district are sufficiently lenient that they
will often place the defendent on two years probation. If
they send him to jail, the average sentence is only 18
months, far less than the five-year or six-year term
permitted.
A. To prevent an increasing flow into Oakland,
Rochester, etc., it is recommended that Selective Service
tighten up residency requirements for transfers of
induction. Regulation 1632.9, which allows a transfer
only when it would otherwise work a hardship upon the

registrant and when the registrant can show "good
reason for his absence" from his local board, has
apparently become a dead letter. While Selective Service
cannot sponsor an investigative service, the regulations
place a clear burden of proof on the registrant and he
should be required to produce more than a mailing
address, e.g., proof of employment, school or other
activity in the area. In addition, if the original local
board is within a reasonable distance, the registrant
should be expected to return there unless he can
otherwise show hardship. Appeal from a denial should
be allowed to the State Director, although the
regulations do not specifically permit it.
A number of cases are now being lost because of
procedural irregularities at the local board or because
clerks and State Directors have difficulty in organizing
the cumbersome files for effective use by U.S.
Attorneys. National Headquarters could possibly help in
the preparation of files for prosecution.
C. It is imperative that State Directors, who have not
already done so, promptly insure that their local boards
are properly constituted since cases have been lost on
this basis.
D. Perhaps worthy of consideration is the notion that
either governmental Appeal Agents (perhaps on an
employed basis) or additional attorneys be hired at the
state level to give greater assistance to local clerks and
state directors (who must forward cases for prosecution
to the U.S. Attorneys' office) in resolving legal tangles.
An impressive number of lawyers are now lining up on
the other side-legal panels, for instance, in Los Angeles
and New York—and it seems unrealistic to expect the
Justice Department personnel, already under-staffed, to
balance the scales.
E. If local board clerks are to be held to standards of
excellence, administrative inspections of local boards
warrant consideration on at least an annual basis. During
this inspection, an independent team would determine
whether the local board had all required publications,
whether the board was properly constituted, whether
the clerk had particular problems that should be

considered higher up and most critically, whether the
files, checked randomly, prove that proper records are
being maintained. These inspections could be viewed not
only as a tool to improve the management but also as an
important measure for personnel advancement.
Legal 'Mill-ins' at Local Boards
Resistors believe that local board activities can easily
be disrupted on any particular day by overwhelming the
clerk with large numbers of people asking questions.
Legally, there are few solutions. One might seek
prosecution for violation of section 12(a), MSSA, but
success is unlikely. The problem really has to be solved
in a practical way.
A. Efforts can be made, for instance, to limit the
number of questioners in an office so that regular work
can continue.
B. Clerks might be instructed by the State Director to
open their doors to visitors only during specified hours,
similar to a bank. In cases of large boards, a clerk can be
posted in an outer office to answer queries.
Sit-ins, Demonstrations at Local Boards
A more serious disruption can occur when anti-draft
groups stage a sit-in within the local board or a
demonstration outside. If they in fact hinder the
processes of the board, they are in violation of the law
and, in the extreme, can be removed by the police. As
these confrontations only spawn bad publicity and more
demonstrations, however, it seems advisable to tolerate
or ignore the demonstrators as much as possible, even if
they occasionally interfere with board operations. This
tolerance does require fortitude by the clerks and State
Directors which must be encouraged by the National
Headquarters through various meetings and
communications. A limited number of these sit-ins do
not really break down the system and they are far better
than a "trashing" of the local board, which can follow
police confrontations.
Destroying Local Boards
Effective security is clearly the first step against
violence. As long as the Vietnam war continues, Beaver
55 and other groups will try to attack the "War
Machine" where it is most vulnerable, and if local draft
boards are not adequately secured, they are obvious
targets.
A. Several states are experimenting now with alarm
systems at an apparently reasonable cost. These systems
should be studied more closely at the national level and
then assistance should be given to the states to develop
their programs, particularly for the larger boards.
B. It is also possible that National Headquarters
should study alternative means and costs of duplicating
records. Microfilming and computers might offer a
solution.
Flooding Local Boards with Junk Mail
A tactic of growing popularity among resistance
groups is to deluge the local board clerk with irrelevant
materials which the sender asks to be included in his file.
There are no legal prohibitions against this move, and it
creates obvious problems for the local board.
Regulation 1641.7, which spells out status changes
which the registrant must report, does not state whether
materials can be thrown away by the board, but it is
clear that a test of relevancy can be read into the
regulation and that the irrelevant can be pushed aside. A
problem in applying the test is that during an appeal, a
registrant can claim that important materials have been
left out of his file without his knowledge.
One solution might be to establish a test of relevancy
in an institution from National Headquarters. Those
materials which were then found irrelevant by the clerk
might be returned to the sender—at his expense. As an
alternative, the board could notify the sender that the
material was irrelevant and would be held 15 days for
pick-up or destruction by the board. The major idea is to
place the burden on the sender, where it should be, and
not on the filing system of Selective Service.
Turning-in, Destroying Draft Cards
There is much hypocrisy in this area, as in the alleged
case of a registrant who obtained six draft cards so that
he could convince different friends that he was turning
his card in, but massive draft card turn-ins such as the
Charlottesville pledge are effective public symbols of
protest. Further, prosecution is now considered
impractical because of the judicial difficulties.
At least four options suggest themselves:
A. Rescind 1623.5, which requires personal
possession of SS Form 2 and Form 110. The original
purpose of the draft card was apparently to provide a
means of checking whether a young man was registered.
The only argument in favor of keeping the draft card law
is that in the event of a large anti-registration drive, the
lack of a card can be used as prime facie evidence of a
failure to register.
B. A second option is to introduce legislation which
would nullify the effect of the recent Gutknecht
decision of the Supreme Court. The case can be read to
mean that Congress did not intend to allow acceleration
of induction for delinquents. Thus a clear restatement of
Congressional intent would allow such acceleration.
C. Thirdly, impose an administrative fine for
delinquents administered by Selective Service or by
another designated agency.
D. Send the draft cards to the local draft boards for
inclusion in the registrant's file. Although no clear action
would result, it could obviously sway the board should
the registrant later ask for special consideration and

might thus be perceived as a potential threat. This, of
course, is a minimum solution and amounts to a
continuation of the present condition. It also is of
questionable legality in light of Gutknecht.
Organizing High School Students
Not to Register
The high schools offer a tempting target for
anti-establishment groups today. UNDO organizers plan
a major anti-draft campaign and attempt to persuade
high school students not to register. No one actually
knows how large the problem is. One state is apparently
running a quiet test in some areas, and its results might
be significant. But, we can be sure that if the war
continues, the difficulty will grow.
A. The first and most obvious step—one that is
needed even in the absence of an anti-draft campaign (is
a greatly expanded high school counseling program on
the opportunities of military service). High school
students are often uncertain of the possibilities and
rarely gain full understanding during their registration
visit to the draft board.

4 Effective security is clearly
the first step against violence
... if local boards are not
adequately secured, they are
obvious targets. 9

B. Concurrently, it is also possible that alternative
ways of checking individual registrations may be found.
One approach, for instance, is to provide each local
board with the list of all 18 year olds in public schools in
its jurisdiction. A second possibility is to check the files
against driver registrations and, in some states, against
voter rolls.
End-of-year Classification Problems
It is possible that many deferred registrants, wishing
to "game" the lottery, will attempt to relinquish their
deferments toward the end of 1 970, with the hope that
their limited exposure in the 1970 prime age group will
move them down to the lower priority age group for
1971. The most obvious example of this nominal
vulnerability to the 1 97 0 draft is the student who drops
out of school in December this year and who notifies his
local board that his 11-S deferment no longer applies.
With only a few days left in the 1 97 0 calendar, there is
little or no opportunity for the local board to reclassify
the registrant into I-A, wait the required length of time
for a personal appearance or appeal, order him for a
pre-induction physical examination and send out the
induction notice before the year ends. This problem,
with the many factual variations together with other
year-end loopholes, must be dealt with by National
Headquarters and local boards before the problems
surface toward the end of the year. SSS Regulation,
Section 1631.7 is at the crux of the issue.
Registrants with high random sequence numbers, who
relinquish the basis for their deferments immediately
prior to one of the last scheduled board meetings for
1970, may have an advantage under the Lottery System.
This registrant, with more knowledge and protection
than the registrant who has entered the 19 70 pool
earlier, has made the easy calculation that his random
sequence number will not be reached by his local board.
He hopes to game the system by being reclassified I-A at
the last board meeting. With this nominal exposure in
1 970, he would be assigned to a lower priority group for
1971.
A. If Selective Service wishes to maximize equity it
might instruct boards to not reclassify high number
registrants who requested I-A after a specific date(e.g.,
November 15) until the new year when they would go
into the 1971 Selective Group.
B. If the legal problems of the first alternative prove
difficult, Selective Service might request appropriate
legislation to allow it to issue the instructions
contemplated by the above alternative. This request will
obviously alert high random sequence number registrants
to the possibility for gaming the system this year.
Moreover, timely passage of the requested legislation is
not assured.
C. As an alternative to legislation, Selective Service
might seek an Executive Order, under paragraph 6(d) (3)
of the statute, amending the regulations to authorize the
Director to postpone reclassification for students coming
out of a 11-S deferment late in the year.
While an Executive Order is easier to secure than
legislation, it could not close the loophole for registrants
coming off deferments other than those classified as 11-S.
The issuance of an Executive Order on these limited
grounds might draw attention to the fact that registrants
coming off occupational deferments could not be
similarly postponed.
D. Selective Service can decide that the unfairness is
not compelling, and that no action need be taken to
prevent high random sequence number registrants from
dropping into the pool late in 1 9 70.
E. Independent of this decision, Selective Service can,
and probably should instruct boards to conscientiously
reclassify, in 1970, all registrants who reached random
sequence numbers and who no longer qualify for
deferments. They should not be allowed to "back" into
the 19 71 Selection Group.

otherwise show hardship. Appeal from a denial should
be allowed to the State Director, although the
regulations do not specifically permit it.
A number of cases are now being lost because of
procedural irregularities at the local board or because
clerks and State Directors have difficulty in organizing
the cumbersome files for effective use by U.S.
Attorneys. National Headquarters could possibly help in
the preparation of files for prosecution.
C. It is imperative that State Directors, who have not
already done so, promptly insure that their local boards
are properly constituted since cases have been lost on
this basis.
D. Perhaps worthy of consideration is the notion that
either governmental Appeal Agents (perhaps on an
employed basis) or additional attorneys be hired at the
state level to give greater assistance to local clerks and
state directors (who must forward cases for prosecution
to the U.S. Attorneys' office) in resolving legal tangles.
An impressive number of lawyers are now lining up on
the other side-legal panels, for instance, in Los Angeles
and New York—and it seems unrealistic to expect the
Justice Department personnel, already under-staffed, to
balance the scales.
E. If local board clerks are to be held to standards of
excellence, administrative inspections of local boards
warrant consideration on at least an annual basis. During
this inspection, an independent team would determine
whether the local board had all required publications,
whether the board was properly constituted, whether
the clerk had particular problems that should be

considered higher up and most critically, whether the
files, checked randomly, prove that proper records are
being maintained. These inspections could be viewed not
only as a tool to improve the management but also as an
important measure for personnel advancement.
Legal 'Mill-ins' at Local Boards
Resistors believe that local board activities can easily
be disrupted on any particular day by overwhelming the
clerk with large numbers of people asking questions.
Legally, there are few solutions. One might seek
prosecution for violation of section 12(a), MSSA, but
success is unlikely. The problem really has to be solved
in a practical way.
A. Efforts can be made, for instance, to limit the
number of questioners in an office so that regular work
can continue.
B. Clerks might be instructed by the State Director to
open their doors to visitors only during specified hours,
similar to a bank. In cases of large boards, a clerk can be
posted in an outer office to answer queries.
Sit-ins, Demonstrations at Local Boards
A more serious disruption can occur when anti-draft
groups stage a sit-in within the local board or a
demonstration outside. If they in fact hinder the
processes of the board, they are in violation of the law
and, in the extreme, can be removed by the police. As
these confrontations only spawn bad publicity and more
demonstrations, however, it seems advisable to tolerate
or ignore the demonstrators as much as possible, even if
they occasionally interfere with board operations. This
tolerance does require fortitude by the clerks and State
Directors which must be encouraged by the National
Headquarters through various meetings and
communications. A limited number of these sit-ins do
not really break down the system and they are far better
than a "trashing" of the local board, which can follow
police confrontations.
Destroying Local Boards
Effective security is clearly the first step against
violence. As long as the Vietnam war continues, Beaver
55 and other groups will try to attack the "War
Machine" where it is most vulnerable, and if local draft
boards are not adequately secured, they are obvious
targets.
A. Several states are experimenting now with alarm
systems at an apparently reasonable cost. These systems
should be studied more closely at the national level and
then assistance should be given to the states to develop
their programs, particularly for the larger boards.
B. It is also possible that National Headquarters
should study alternative means and costs of duplicating
records. Microfilming and computers might offer a
solution.
Flooding Local Boards with Junk Mail
A tactic of growing popularity among resistance
groups is to deluge the local board clerk with irrelevant
materials which the sender asks to be included in his file.
There are no legal prohibitions against this move, and it
creates obvious problems for the local board.
Regulation 1641.7, which spells out status changes
which the registrant must report, does not state whether
materials can be thrown away by the board, but it is
clear that a test of relevancy can be read into the
regulation and that the irrelevant can be pushed aside. A
problem in applying the test is that during an appeal, a
registrant can claim that important materials have been
left out of his file without his knowledge.
One solution might be to establish a test of relevancy
in an institution from National Headquarters. Those
materials which were then found irrelevant by the clerk
might be returned to the sender—at his expense. As an
alternative, the board could notify the sender that the
material was irrelevant and would be held 15 days for
pick-up or destruction by the board. The major idea is to
place the burden on the sender, where it should be, and
not on the filing system of Selective Service.
Turning-in, Destroying Draft Cards
There is much hypocrisy in this area, as in the alleged
case of a registrant who obtained six draft cards so that
he could convince different friends that he was turning
his card in, but massive draft card turn-ins such as the
Charlottesville pledge are effective public symbols of
protest. Further, prosecution is now considered
impractical because of the judicial difficulties.
At least four options suggest themselves:
A. Rescind 1623.5, which requires personal
possession of SS Form 2 and Form 110. The original
purpose of the draft card was apparently to provide a
means of checking whether a young man was registered.
The only argument in favor of keeping the draft card law
is that in the event of a large anti-registration drive, the
lack of a card can be used as prime facie evidence of a
failure to register.
B. A second option is to introduce legislation which
would nullify the effect of the recent Gutknecht
decision of the Supreme Court. The case can be read to
mean that Congress did not intend to allow acceleration
of induction for delinquents. Thus a clear restatement of
Congressional intent would allow such acceleration.
C. Thirdly, impose an administrative fine for
delinquents administered by Selective Service or by
another designated agency.
D. Send the draft cards to the local draft boards for
inclusion in the registrant's file. Although no clear action
would result, it could obviously sway the board should
the registrant later ask for special consideration and

might thus be perceived as a potential threat. This, of
course, is a minimum solution and amounts to a
continuation of the present condition. It also is of
questionable legality in light of Gutknecht.
Organizing High School Students
Not to Register
The high schools offer a tempting target for
anti-establishment groups today. UNDO organizers plan
a major anti-draft campaign and attempt to persuade
high school students not to register. No one actually
knows how large the problem is. One state is apparently
running a quiet test in some areas, and its results might
be significant. But, we can be sure that if the war
continues, the difficulty will grow.
A. The first and most obvious step—one that is
needed even in the absence of an anti-draft campaign (is
a greatly expanded high school counseling program on
the opportunities of military service). High school
students are often uncertain of the possibilities and
rarely gain full understanding during their registration
visit to the draft board.

4 Effective security is clearly
the first step against violence
... if local boards are not
adequately secured, they are
obvious targets. 9

B. Concurrently, it is also possible that alternative
ways of checking individual registrations may be found.
One approach, for instance, is to provide each local
board with the list of all 18 year olds in public schools in
its jurisdiction. A second possibility is to check the files
against driver registrations and, in some states, against
voter rolls.
End-of-year Classification Problems
It is possible that many deferred registrants, wishing
to "game" the lottery, will attempt to relinquish their
deferments toward the end of 1 970, with the hope that
their limited exposure in the 1970 prime age group will
move them down to the lower priority age group for
1971. The most obvious example of this nominal
vulnerability to the 1 97 0 draft is the student who drops
out of school in December this year and who notifies his
local board that his 11-S deferment no longer applies.
With only a few days left in the 1 97 0 calendar, there is
little or no opportunity for the local board to reclassify
the registrant into I-A, wait the required length of time
for a personal appearance or appeal, order him for a
pre-induction physical examination and send out the
induction notice before the year ends. This problem,
with the many factual variations together with other
year-end loopholes, must be dealt with by National
Headquarters and local boards before the problems
surface toward the end of the year. SSS Regulation,
Section 1631.7 is at the crux of the issue.
Registrants with high random sequence numbers, who
relinquish the basis for their deferments immediately
prior to one of the last scheduled board meetings for
1970, may have an advantage under the Lottery System.
This registrant, with more knowledge and protection
than the registrant who has entered the 19 70 pool
earlier, has made the easy calculation that his random
sequence number will not be reached by his local board.
He hopes to game the system by being reclassified I-A at
the last board meeting. With this nominal exposure in
1 970, he would be assigned to a lower priority group for
1971.
A. If Selective Service wishes to maximize equity it
might instruct boards to not reclassify high number
registrants who requested I-A after a specific date(e.g.,
November 15) until the new year when they would go
into the 1971 Selective Group.
B. If the legal problems of the first alternative prove
difficult, Selective Service might request appropriate
legislation to allow it to issue the instructions
contemplated by the above alternative. This request will
obviously alert high random sequence number registrants
to the possibility for gaming the system this year.
Moreover, timely passage of the requested legislation is
not assured.
C. As an alternative to legislation, Selective Service
might seek an Executive Order, under paragraph 6(d) (3)
of the statute, amending the regulations to authorize the
Director to postpone reclassification for students coming
out of a 11-S deferment late in the year.
While an Executive Order is easier to secure than
legislation, it could not close the loophole for registrants
coming off deferments other than those classified as 11-S.
The issuance of an Executive Order on these limited
grounds might draw attention to the fact that registrants
coming off occupational deferments could not be
similarly postponed.
D. Selective Service can decide that the unfairness is
not compelling, and that no action need be taken to
prevent high random sequence number registrants from
dropping into the pool late in 1 9 70.
E. Independent of this decision, Selective Service can,
and probably should instruct boards to conscientiously
reclassify, in 1970, all registrants who reached random
sequence numbers and who no longer qualify for
deferments. They should not be allowed to "back" into
the 19 71 Selection Group.
This memorandum was prepared by the national
office of the Selective Service System for confidential
circulation among members of its Youth Advisory
Committees which met June '28 through July 2, to
discuss problems of the draft system and to draw
numbers for the 1971 lottery. This is the first time this
memorandum has been published.—Bill Evers
(This material is for discussion purposes only and
should not be released.)
In the belief that the draft should have been reformed
or eliminated years ago, individuals as well as highly
organized groups are attempting to undermine the
Selective Service System. Such groups as UNDO and
Beaver 5 5 are advocating the use of certain actions
which pose a threat to the System. Following is a
discussion of several of these techniques and possible
proposals for their correction. You are asked to evaluate
the correction measures and make your own suggestions.
(UNDO is the Union for National Draft Opposition, a
nation-wide draft resistance organization which was
founded at Princeton at the time of the Cambodia strike
last spring. The Beaver 55 is a so-called ultra-resistance
group. It has destroyed draft files at Selective Service
local boards and led a raid on Dow Chemical's
headquarters where the Beavers erased computer tapes
on which were stored all of the data from Dow's
biological and chemical warfare research
program. -Editor's Note.)
Legal Attack- The Oakland Experience
A major thrust of the resistance movement is to
destroy the draft by exploiting its reliance on the
judicial system. Oakland, California has become the
symbol of success for this effort, and resistors hope not
only to expand the Oakland experience but to duplicate
it across the country. It is believed, for instance, that
Rochester and northern Alabama are hopeful prospects.
It is a simple matter for a registrant living outside the
Bay Area to transfer his induction to Oakland with only
a one-night residency. When he then refuses induction
there, he can expect a two-year delay in his trial, by
which time the amnesty movement may save him. Even
when brought to trial, he has an excellent chance of
winning because of the excellence of a growing
fraternity of anti-draft lawyers. Even if he loses, some
judges in the district are sufficiently lenient that they
will often place the defendent on two years probation. If
they send him to jail, the average sentence is only 18
months, far less than the five-year or six-year term
permitted.
A. To prevent an increasing flow into Oakland,
Rochester, etc., it is recommended that Selective Service
tighten up residency requirements for transfers of
induction. Regulation 1632.9, which allows a transfer
only when it would otherwise work a hardship upon the

registrant and when the registrant can show "good
reason for his absence" from his local board, has
apparently become a dead letter. While Selective Service
cannot sponsor an investigative service, the regulations
place a clear burden of proof on the registrant and he
should be required to produce more than a mailing
address, e.g., proof of employment, school or other
activity in the area. In addition, if the original local
board is within a reasonable distance, the registrant
should be expected to return there unless he can
otherwise show hardship. Appeal from a denial should
be allowed to the State Director, although the
regulations do not specifically permit it.
A number of cases are now being lost because of
procedural irregularities at the local board or because

the cumbersome files for effective use by U.S.

then assistance should be given to the states to develop
their programs, particularly for the larger boards.
B. It is also possible that National Headquarters
should study alternative means and costs of duplicating
records. Microfilming and computers might offer a
solution.
Flooding Local Boards with Junk Mail
A tactic of growing popularity among resistance
groups is to deluge the local board clerk with irrelevant
materials which the sender asks to be included in his file.
There are no legal prohibitions against this move, and it
creates obvious problems for the local board.
Regulation 1641.7, which spells out status changes
which the registrant must report, does not state whether
materials can be thrown away by the board, but it is
clear that a test of relevancy can be read into the
regulation and that the irrelevant can be pushed aside. A
problem in applying the test is that during an appeal, a
registrant can claim that important materials have been
left out of his file without his knowledge.
One solution might be to establish a test of relevancy
in an institution from National Headquarters. Those
materials which were then found irrelevant by the clerk
might be returned to the sender—at his expense. As an
alternative, the board could notify the sender that the
material was irrelevant and would be held 15 days for
pick-up or destruction by the board. The major idea is to
place the burden on the sender, where it should be, and
not on the filing system of Selective Service.
Turning-in, Destroying Draft Cards
There is much hypocrisy in this area, as in the alleged
case of a registrant who obtained six draft cards so that
he could convince different friends that he was turning
his card in, but massive draft card turn-ins such as the
Charlottesville pledge are effective public symbols of
protest. Further, prosecution is now considered
impractical because of the judicial difficulties.
At least four options suggest themselves:
A. Rescind 1623.5, which requires personal
possession of SS Form 2 and Form 110. The original
purpose of the draft card was apparently to provide a
means of checking whether a young man was registered.
The only argument in favor of keeping the draft card law
is that in the event of a large anti-registration drive, the
lack of a card can be used as prime facie evidence of a
failure to register.
B. A second option is to introduce legislation which
would nullify the effect of the recent Gutknecht
decision of the Supreme Court. The case can be read to
mean that Congress did not intend to allow acceleration
of induction for delinquents. Thus a clear restatement of
Congressional intent would allow such acceleration.
C. Thirdly, impose an administrative fine for
delinquents administered by Selective Service or by
another designated agency.
D. Send the draft cards to the local draft boards for
inclusion in the registrant's file. Although no clear action
would result, it could obviously sway the board should
the registrant later ask for special consideration and

might thus be perceived as a potential threat. This, of
course, is a minimum solution and amounts to a
continuation of the present condition. It also is of
questionable legality in light of Gutknecht.
Organizing High School Students
Not to Register
The high schools offer a tempting target for
anti-establishment groups today. UNDO organizers plan
a major anti-draft campaign and attempt to persuade
high school students not to register. No one actually
knows how large the problem is. One state is apparently
running a quiet test in some areas, and its results might
be significant. But, we can be sure that if the war
continues, the difficulty will grow.
A. The first and most obvious step—one that is
needed even in the absence of an anti-draft campaign (is
a greatly expanded high school counseling program on
the opportunities of military service). High school
students are often uncertain of the possibilities and
rarely gain full understanding during their registration
visit to the draft board.

4 Effective security is clearly
the first step against violence
... if local boards are not
adequately secured, they are
obvious targets. 9

B. Concurrently, it is also possible that alternative
ways of checking individual registrations may be found.
One approach, for instance, is to provide each local
board with the list of all 18 year olds in public schools in
its jurisdiction. A second possibility is to check the files
against driver registrations and, in some states, against
voter rolls.
End-of-year Classification Problems
It is possible that many deferred registrants, wishing
to "game" the lottery, will attempt to relinquish their
deferments toward the end of 1 970, with the hope that
their limited exposure in the 1970 prime age group will
move them down to the lower priority age group for
1971. The most obvious example of this nominal
vulnerability to the 1 97 0 draft is the student who drops
out of school in December this year and who notifies his
local board that his 11-S deferment no longer applies.
With only a few days left in the 1 97 0 calendar, there is
little or no opportunity for the local board to reclassify
the registrant into I-A, wait the required length of time
for a personal appearance or appeal, order him for a
pre-induction physical examination and send out the
induction notice before the year ends. This problem,
with the many factual variations together with other
year-end loopholes, must be dealt with by National
Headquarters and local boards before the problems
surface toward the end of the year. SSS Regulation,
Section 1631.7 is at the crux of the issue.
Registrants with high random sequence numbers, who
relinquish the basis for their deferments immediately
prior to one of the last scheduled board meetings for
1970, may have an advantage under the Lottery System.
This registrant, with more knowledge and protection
than the registrant who has entered the 19 70 pool
earlier, has made the easy calculation that his random
sequence number will not be reached by his local board.
He hopes to game the system by being reclassified I-A at
the last board meeting. With this nominal exposure in
1 970, he would be assigned to a lower priority group for
1971.
A. If Selective Service wishes to maximize equity it
might instruct boards to not reclassify high number
registrants who requested I-A after a specific date(e.g.,
November 15) until the new year when they would go
into the 1971 Selective Group.
B. If the legal problems of the first alternative prove
difficult, Selective Service might request appropriate
legislation to allow it to issue the instructions
contemplated by the above alternative. This request will
obviously alert high random sequence number registrants
to the possibility for gaming the system this year.
Moreover, timely passage of the requested legislation is
not assured.
C. As an alternative to legislation, Selective Service
might seek an Executive Order, under paragraph 6(d) (3)
of the statute, amending the regulations to authorize the
Director to postpone reclassification for students coming
out of a 11-S deferment late in the year.
While an Executive Order is easier to secure than
legislation, it could not close the loophole for registrants
coming off deferments other than those classified as 11-S.
The issuance of an Executive Order on these limited
grounds might draw attention to the fact that registrants
coming off occupational deferments could not be
similarly postponed.
D. Selective Service can decide that the unfairness is
not compelling, and that no action need be taken to
prevent high random sequence number registrants from
dropping into the pool late in 1 9 70.
E. Independent of this decision, Selective Service can,
and probably should instruct boards to conscientiously
reclassify, in 1970, all registrants who reached random
sequence numbers and who no longer qualify for
deferments. They should not be allowed to "back" into
the 19 71 Selection Group.
This memorandum was prepared by the national
office of the Selective Service System for confidential
circulation among members of its Youth Advisory
Committees which met June '28 through July 2, to
discuss problems of the draft system and to draw
numbers for the 1971 lottery. This is the first time this
memorandum has been published.—Bill Evers
(This material is for discussion purposes only and
should not be released.)
In the belief that the draft should have been reformed
or eliminated years ago, individuals as well as highly
organized groups are attempting to undermine the
Selective Service System. Such groups as UNDO and
Beaver 5 5 are advocating the use of certain actions
which pose a threat to the System. Following is a
discussion of several of these techniques and possible
proposals for their correction. You are asked to evaluate
the correction measures and make your own suggestions.
(UNDO is the Union for National Draft Opposition, a
nation-wide draft resistance organization which was
founded at Princeton at the time of the Cambodia strike
last spring. The Beaver 55 is a so-called ultra-resistance
group. It has destroyed draft files at Selective Service
local boards and led a raid on Dow Chemical's
headquarters where the Beavers erased computer tapes
on which were stored all of the data from Dow's
biological and chemical warfare research
program. -Editor's Note.)
Legal Attack- The Oakland Experience
A major thrust of the resistance movement is to
destroy the draft by exploiting its reliance on the
judicial system. Oakland, California has become the
symbol of success for this effort, and resistors hope not
only to expand the Oakland experience but to duplicate
it across the country. It is believed, for instance, that
Rochester and northern Alabama are hopeful prospects.
It is a simple matter for a registrant living outside the
Bay Area to transfer his induction to Oakland with only
a one-night residency. When he then refuses induction
there, he can expect a two-year delay in his trial, by
which time the amnesty movement may save him. Even
when brought to trial, he has an excellent chance of
winning because of the excellence of a growing
fraternity of anti-draft lawyers. Even if he loses, some
judges in the district are sufficiently lenient that they
will often place the defendent on two years probation. If
they send him to jail, the average sentence is only 18
months, far less than the five-year or six-year term
permitted.
A. To prevent an increasing flow into Oakland,
Rochester, etc., it is recommended that Selective Service
tighten up residency requirements for transfers of
induction. Regulation 1632.9, which allows a transfer
only when it would otherwise work a hardship upon the

registrant and when the registrant can show "good
reason for his absence" from his local board, has
apparently become a dead letter. While Selective Service
cannot sponsor an investigative service, the regulations
place a clear burden of proof on the registrant and he
should be required to produce more than a mailing
address, e.g., proof of employment, school or other
activity in the area. In addition, if the original local
board is within a reasonable distance, the registrant
should be expected to return there unless he can
otherwise show hardship. Appeal from a denial should
be allowed to the State Director, although the
regulations do not specifically permit it.
A number of cases are now being lost because of
procedural irregularities at the local board or because
clerks and State Directors have difficulty in organizing
the cumbersome files for effective use by U.S.
Attorneys. National Headquarters could possibly help in
the preparation of files for prosecution.
C. It is imperative that State Directors, who have not
already done so, promptly insure that their local boards
are properly constituted since cases have been lost on
this basis.
D. Perhaps worthy of consideration is the notion that
either governmental Appeal Agents (perhaps on an
employed basis) or additional attorneys be hired at the
state level to give greater assistance to local clerks and
state directors (who must forward cases for prosecution
to the U.S. Attorneys' office) in resolving legal tangles.
An impressive number of lawyers are now lining up on
the other side-legal panels, for instance, in Los Angeles
and New York—and it seems unrealistic to expect the
Justice Department personnel, already under-staffed, to
balance the scales.
E. If local board clerks are to be held to standards of
excellence, administrative inspections of local boards
warrant consideration on at least an annual basis. During
this inspection, an independent team would determine
whether the local board had all required publications,
whether the board was properly constituted, whether
the clerk had particular problems that should be

considered higher up and most critically, whether the
files, checked randomly, prove that proper records are
being maintained. These inspections could be viewed not
only as a tool to improve the management but also as an
important measure for personnel advancement.
Legal 'Mill-ins' at Local Boards
Resistors believe that local board activities can easily
be disrupted on any particular day by overwhelming the
clerk with large numbers of people asking questions.
Legally, there are few solutions. One might seek
prosecution for violation of section 12(a), MSSA, but
success is unlikely. The problem really has to be solved
in a practical way.
A. Efforts can be made, for instance, to limit the
number of questioners in an office so that regular work
can continue.
B. Clerks might be instructed by the State Director to
open their doors to visitors only during specified hours,
similar to a bank. In cases of large boards, a clerk can be
posted in an outer office to answer queries.
Sit-ins, Demonstrations at Local Boards
A more serious disruption can occur when anti-draft
groups stage a sit-in within the local board or a
demonstration outside. If they in fact hinder the
processes of the board, they are in violation of the law
and, in the extreme, can be removed by the police. As
these confrontations only spawn bad publicity and more
demonstrations, however, it seems advisable to tolerate
or ignore the demonstrators as much as possible, even if
they occasionally interfere with board operations. This
tolerance does require fortitude by the clerks and State
Directors which must be encouraged by the National
Headquarters through various meetings and
communications. A limited number of these sit-ins do
not really break down the system and they are far better
than a "trashing" of the local board, which can follow
police confrontations.
Destroying Local Boards
Effective security is clearly the first step against
violence. As long as the Vietnam war continues, Beaver
55 and other groups will try to attack the "War
Machine" where it is most vulnerable, and if local draft
boards are not adequately secured, they are obvious
targets.
A. Several states are experimenting now with alarm
systems at an apparently reasonable cost. These systems
should be studied more closely at the national level and
then assistance should be given to the states to develop
their programs, particularly for the larger boards.
B. It is also possible that National Headquarters
should study alternative means and costs of duplicating
records. Microfilming and computers might offer a
