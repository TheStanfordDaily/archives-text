# Schwartz: Prosecutor Or Protector?
## 
### CAROL LEWIS 
Prosecutor or protector—what does it mean to be the
special Assistant to the University President?
This is the question former tax-lawyer and physicist
John J. Schwartz must now consider.
Described by University spokesmen as "disciplinary
affairs coordinator," viewed by some students as Stanford's
full-time prosecuting attorney, Schwartz includes insurance
of student rights as part of his new job.
However, his most publicized duty is the researching and
filing of complaints for the administration with the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC). This includes charges still
to be pressed for campus disruptions last spring.
For this reason alone it's a job that comes with built-in
difficulties and Schwartz confesses that many faculty
friends have said, "You must be out of your mind to take
the job." Schwartz' feelings are quite serious; "We have a
chance to make a system of self-government work. Some of
us just have to roll up our sleeves and try."
Schwartz also added, slowly and with lawyer-like
precision, "President Lyman will not be directing the
manner in which I present cases or my decisions on which
cases warrant complaint."
Schwartz would "like to avoid the term" of University
prosecutor. He dismisses the possibilities of Perry Mason
court proceedings remarking, "I don't intent to challenge
the credibility of witnesses. . . the University has an
obligation to explain why we brought charges, not to enter
into courtroom battle."
Student Rights
Whether the courtroom battle can be avoided is to be
seen. Undeniably Schwartz assumes his position at a time
when campus confrontations have left
student-administration relations tenuous and student rights
unclear.
On many college campuses judicial proceedings still
exclude the possibility for a student to present a defense.
On other campuses, such as the University of Texas, the
student body hires and pays a permanent attorney to
defend students.

As for Stanford, Schwartz says,"It may well be that
some students are not convinced we are concerned about
the safety of rights ... but, we are."
Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter, student rights
before the SJC are well-defined and include the right to
prepare a defense.
Schwartz argued against any claim that students were at
a disadvantage when faced with administration lawyers
pressing charges. Students, he said, did not have diffii ulty
obtaining counsel. Schwartz pointed to the Old Union and
ROTC cases which were dropped "on basis of excellent
work by downtown lawyers who volunteered their service."
Schwartz also denied all rumors that his office would in
any way bypass the SJC or Student Conduct Legislative
Council which together bear responsibility for
promulgation and adjudication of student conduct
regulations.
Acutely aware that there are doubts about the purpose
of his office, Schwartz hopes to talk with students about
his responsibilities.
One of those responsibilities this year will be
recommending amendments for the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. "There are a lot of things wrong with it,"says
Schwartz.
Who Can Complain?
One "fairly explosive issue" involves the filing of
complaints. At the present time an SJC self-defined reling
list three sources from which complaints may come: the
administration - a member of faculty, staff, or student body
who has been "directly and adversely affected by student
misconduct;" or any student who believes he has been
subject to disciplinary action without a hearing before the
SJC.
Problems came up last spring when students filed
complaints based on their observations of demonstrators
throwing rocks. Because it was unclear if these students
were "directly and adversely affected," many of the cases
were dropped.
There is, Schwartz feels, an absolute need for the charter


PROSECUTOR-"I think it is in everyone's
interest to take cure of incidents as soon as
possible. "


PROTECTOR-'lt may well be that some students

safety of rights . . . but, we are. "
itself to define who is able to press cnarges. When and if
placed before the students in form of proposed
amendment, Schwartz anticipates a wide variety of
response.
Another amendment Schwartz may consider is the
possible expansion of SJC jurisdiction. Presently the SJC
does not handle staff discipline; it is unclear about faculty
discipline; and it is unclear about responsibility for
adjudication of alleged violations committed during
"emergency conditions" in which the University president
has power to promulgate and enforce regulations.
Though Schwartz felt he was not ready to outline the
scope of a possible jurisdiction amendment, he did say that
"all three questions should be explicitly dealt with one way
or the other."
Still another problem Schwartz would like to solve is the
pile-up of work before the SJC at the end of each quarter
created by the limited ability of the SJC to obtain student
cooperation. "Council presently requires cooperation by
holding graduation or registration for the following
quarter" Schwartz explained. The result is students ignoring
charges until the very end of the quarter.

Avoiding the word subpoena, Schwartz spoke of the
need for "a sanction imposed by the court without waiting
until the end of the quarter." Hesitating briefly Schwartz
explained "that would probably have to be some form of
probation or suspension."
He continued, "I think it is in everyone's interest to take
care of incidents as soon as possible."
In charges not brought by the university, Schwartz has
volunteered to act as "friend of the courts" should they
request it. He would then perform duties as a non-partisan
judicial aide, "only with consent of complainant and
defendant" he added.
Through studying loopholes- in the charter, clarifying
"innumerable regulations, rules, practices and policies" and
speaking with outside civic groups, John Schwartz hopes to
show that he's quite serious when he says "We like to think
we are doing everything we can to insure the rights of
students."
Nevertheless, along with $90,000 worth of new building
lights, more cameras, and a possible enlarged police force,
Schwartz's appointment as legal representative for the
university administration may not have alleviated doubts
about student rights in all Stanford minds.

itself to define who is able to press cnarges. When and if
placed before the students in form of proposed
amendment, Schwartz anticipates a wide variety of
response.
Another amendment Schwartz may consider is the
possible expansion of SJC jurisdiction. Presently the SJC
does not handle staff discipline; it is unclear about faculty
discipline; and it is unclear about responsibility for
adjudication of alleged violations committed during
"emergency conditions" in which the University president
has power to promulgate and enforce regulations.
Though Schwartz felt he was not ready to outline the
scope of a possible jurisdiction amendment, he did say that
"all three questions should be explicitly dealt with one way
or the other."
Still another problem Schwartz would like to solve is the
pile-up of work before the SJC at the end of each quarter
created by the limited ability of the SJC to obtain student
cooperation. "Council presently requires cooperation by
holding graduation or registration for the following
quarter" Schwartz explained. The result is students ignoring
charges until the very end of the quarter.

Avoiding the word subpoena, Schwartz spoke of the
need for "a sanction imposed by the court without waiting
until the end of the quarter." Hesitating briefly Schwartz
explained "that would probably have to be some form of
probation or suspension."
He continued, "I think it is in everyone's interest to take
care of incidents as soon as possible."
In charges not brought by the university, Schwartz has
volunteered to act as "friend of the courts" should they
request it. He would then perform duties as a non-partisan
judicial aide, "only with consent of complainant and
defendant" he added.
Through studying loopholes- in the charter, clarifying
"innumerable regulations, rules, practices and policies" and
speaking with outside civic groups, John Schwartz hopes to
show that he's quite serious when he says "We like to think
we are doing everything we can to insure the rights of
students."
Nevertheless, along with $90,000 worth of new building
lights, more cameras, and a possible enlarged police force,
Schwartz's appointment as legal representative for the
university administration may not have alleviated doubts
about student rights in all Stanford minds.
Prosecutor or protector—what does it mean to be the
special Assistant to the University President?
This is the question former tax-lawyer and physicist
John J. Schwartz must now consider.
Described by University spokesmen as "disciplinary
affairs coordinator," viewed by some students as Stanford's
full-time prosecuting attorney, Schwartz includes insurance
of student rights as part of his new job.
However, his most publicized duty is the researching and
filing of complaints for the administration with the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC). This includes charges still
to be pressed for campus disruptions last spring.
For this reason alone it's a job that comes with built-in
difficulties and Schwartz confesses that many faculty
friends have said, "You must be out of your mind to take
the job." Schwartz' feelings are quite serious; "We have a
chance to make a system of self-government work. Some of
us just have to roll up our sleeves and try."
Schwartz also added, slowly and with lawyer-like
precision, "President Lyman will not be directing the
manner in which I present cases or my decisions on which
cases warrant complaint."
Schwartz would "like to avoid the term" of University
prosecutor. He dismisses the possibilities of Perry Mason
court proceedings remarking, "I don't intent to challenge
the credibility of witnesses. . . the University has an
obligation to explain why we brought charges, not to enter
into courtroom battle."
Student Rights
Whether the courtroom battle can be avoided is to be
seen. Undeniably Schwartz assumes his position at a time
when campus confrontations have left
student-administration relations tenuous and student rights
unclear.
On many college campuses judicial proceedings still
exclude the possibility for a student to present a defense.
On other campuses, such as the University of Texas, the
student body hires and pays a permanent attorney to
defend students.

As for Stanford, Schwartz says,"It may well be that
some students are not convinced we are concerned about
the safety of rights ... but, we are."
Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter, student rights
before the SJC are well-defined and include the right to
prepare a defense.
Schwartz argued against any claim that students were at
a disadvantage when faced with administration lawyers
pressing charges. Students, he said, did not have diffii ulty
obtaining counsel. Schwartz pointed to the Old Union and
ROTC cases which were dropped "on basis of excellent
work by downtown lawyers who volunteered their service."
Schwartz also denied all rumors that his office would in
any way bypass the SJC or Student Conduct Legislative
Council which together bear responsibility for
promulgation and adjudication of student conduct
regulations.
Acutely aware that there are doubts about the purpose
of his office, Schwartz hopes to talk with students about
his responsibilities.
One of those responsibilities this year will be
recommending amendments for the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. "There are a lot of things wrong with it,"says
Schwartz.
Who Can Complain?
One "fairly explosive issue" involves the filing of
complaints. At the present time an SJC self-defined reling
list three sources from which complaints may come: the
administration - a member of faculty, staff, or student body
who has been "directly and adversely affected by student
misconduct;" or any student who believes he has been
subject to disciplinary action without a hearing before the
SJC.
Problems came up last spring when students filed
complaints based on their observations of demonstrators
throwing rocks. Because it was unclear if these students
were "directly and adversely affected," many of the cases
were dropped.
There is, Schwartz feels, an absolute need for the charter

when campus confrontations have left
student-administration relations tenuous and student rights
unclear.
On many college campuses judicial proceedings still
exclude the possibility for a student to present a defense.
On other campuses, such as the University of Texas, the
student body hires and pays a permanent attorney to
defend students.

As for Stanford, Schwartz says,"It may well be that
some students are not convinced we are concerned about
the safety of rights ... but, we are."
Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter, student rights
before the SJC are well-defined and include the right to
prepare a defense.
Schwartz argued against any claim that students were at
a disadvantage when faced with administration lawyers
pressing charges. Students, he said, did not have diffii ulty
obtaining counsel. Schwartz pointed to the Old Union and
ROTC cases which were dropped "on basis of excellent
work by downtown lawyers who volunteered their service."
Schwartz also denied all rumors that his office would in
any way bypass the SJC or Student Conduct Legislative
Council which together bear responsibility for
promulgation and adjudication of student conduct
regulations.
Acutely aware that there are doubts about the purpose
of his office, Schwartz hopes to talk with students about
his responsibilities.
One of those responsibilities this year will be
recommending amendments for the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. "There are a lot of things wrong with it,"says
Schwartz.
Who Can Complain?
One "fairly explosive issue" involves the filing of
complaints. At the present time an SJC self-defined reling
list three sources from which complaints may come: the
administration - a member of faculty, staff, or student body
who has been "directly and adversely affected by student
misconduct;" or any student who believes he has been
subject to disciplinary action without a hearing before the
SJC.
Problems came up last spring when students filed
complaints based on their observations of demonstrators
throwing rocks. Because it was unclear if these students
were "directly and adversely affected," many of the cases
were dropped.
There is, Schwartz feels, an absolute need for the charter


PROSECUTOR-"I think it is in everyone's
interest to take cure of incidents as soon as
possible. "


PROTECTOR-'lt may well be that some students

safety of rights . . . but, we are. "
itself to define who is able to press cnarges. When and if
placed before the students in form of proposed
amendment, Schwartz anticipates a wide variety of
response.
Another amendment Schwartz may consider is the
possible expansion of SJC jurisdiction. Presently the SJC
does not handle staff discipline; it is unclear about faculty
discipline; and it is unclear about responsibility for
adjudication of alleged violations committed during
"emergency conditions" in which the University president
has power to promulgate and enforce regulations.
Though Schwartz felt he was not ready to outline the
scope of a possible jurisdiction amendment, he did say that
"all three questions should be explicitly dealt with one way
or the other."
Still another problem Schwartz would like to solve is the
pile-up of work before the SJC at the end of each quarter
created by the limited ability of the SJC to obtain student
cooperation. "Council presently requires cooperation by
holding graduation or registration for the following
quarter" Schwartz explained. The result is students ignoring
charges until the very end of the quarter.

Avoiding the word subpoena, Schwartz spoke of the
need for "a sanction imposed by the court without waiting
until the end of the quarter." Hesitating briefly Schwartz
explained "that would probably have to be some form of
probation or suspension."
He continued, "I think it is in everyone's interest to take
care of incidents as soon as possible."
In charges not brought by the university, Schwartz has
volunteered to act as "friend of the courts" should they
request it. He would then perform duties as a non-partisan
judicial aide, "only with consent of complainant and
defendant" he added.
Through studying loopholes- in the charter, clarifying
"innumerable regulations, rules, practices and policies" and
speaking with outside civic groups, John Schwartz hopes to
show that he's quite serious when he says "We like to think
we are doing everything we can to insure the rights of
students."
Nevertheless, along with $90,000 worth of new building
lights, more cameras, and a possible enlarged police force,
Schwartz's appointment as legal representative for the
university administration may not have alleviated doubts
about student rights in all Stanford minds.
Prosecutor or protector—what does it mean to be the
special Assistant to the University President?
This is the question former tax-lawyer and physicist
John J. Schwartz must now consider.
Described by University spokesmen as "disciplinary
affairs coordinator," viewed by some students as Stanford's
full-time prosecuting attorney, Schwartz includes insurance
of student rights as part of his new job.
However, his most publicized duty is the researching and
filing of complaints for the administration with the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC). This includes charges still
to be pressed for campus disruptions last spring.
For this reason alone it's a job that comes with built-in
difficulties and Schwartz confesses that many faculty
friends have said, "You must be out of your mind to take
the job." Schwartz' feelings are quite serious; "We have a
chance to make a system of self-government work. Some of
us just have to roll up our sleeves and try."
Schwartz also added, slowly and with lawyer-like
precision, "President Lyman will not be directing the
manner in which I present cases or my decisions on which
cases warrant complaint."
Schwartz would "like to avoid the term" of University
prosecutor. He dismisses the possibilities of Perry Mason
court proceedings remarking, "I don't intent to challenge
the credibility of witnesses. . . the University has an
obligation to explain why we brought charges, not to enter
into courtroom battle."
