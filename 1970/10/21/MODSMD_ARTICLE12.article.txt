Kent Roundup Continues
KENT, Ohio — More indictments returned by a
special state grand jury investigating the May
disturbances at Kent State University were served
Tuesday as student and faculty organizations called for a
federal grand jury probe.
Four days of disorders ended May 4 with the
shooting deaths of four students and wounding of nine
in a confrontation between Ohio National Guard troops
and rock-throwing anti-war demonstrators on the Kent
State campus.
The state grand jury indicted 25 persons, but
exonerated the National Guard in its report issued
Friday. Seven of the indictments had been served by
Tuesday afternoon.
The KSU Faculty Senate, Student Senate and
Graduate Student Council called for the federal
investigation in a joint statement in which they said the
state jury exceeded "the boundaries of its legal
responsibilities."
Two former Kent State students and a man who
never attended the university turned themselves in to the
Portage County sheriff at Ravenna Tuesday and were
served with indictments.
Nixon Stumps Again
FORT WAYNE — President Nixon took his
Republican campaign into three more states Tuesday. In
the South he hit out at compulsory school bussing, and in
the Midwest he urged Indiana voters to give him another
GOP senator.
Nixon found rain at every stop but crowds plentiful,
and he declared, "When they'll stand in the rain, that
means we're going to win."
Nixon who spent Monday night in Kansas City, where
fog was the rule, went on from there Tuesday morning
to fly through choppy rain clouds to Johnson City,
Tenn.; Asheville, N.C., and Fort Wayne, Ind., before
heading back to Washington.
Despite the weather, crowds of up to 15,000 and
more greeted him at each stop.
In reaffirming before an Asheville audience his
long-standing opposition to compulsory busing to
achieve school desegregation, he drew his strongest
applause by asserting his leaning toward "the
neighborhood school" the one closest to a student's
home.
In predominatly Republican eastern Tennessee the
first border state on his pre-election intinerary he regaled
against senators who would vote against presidential

nominees for federal judgeships who are strict in
interpreting the meaning of the Constitution.
A anew Hits Commentators
CHICAGO — Viee President Spiro T. Agnew said
Tuesday that it would be "interesting" to have news
commentators appear voluntarily on a panel show and
be quizzed by elected public officials about the
broadcasters' opinions on subjects in the news.
"The people who are watching that tube have a right
to know what your opinions are if you happen to be a
man who is telling the news every night," Agnew told
two television interviewers in Chicago as he would up a
two-day campaign visit to Illinois.
The vice president, who flew back East later to keep a
campaign engagement in Baltimore, said newsmen can
select parts of the news they wish to emphasize and by
their language "can convey a point of view that is not an
editorial yet is colored by your own viewpoint."
"It wouid be very interesting," Agner said, "to have a
show a panel type show where senators from either
party, representatives, I suppose maybe a couple of
governors could sit down with someone who has a
national reputation as a commentator ... and just
examine him in depth on where he stands personally on
the issues he talks about every day."
My Lai Prosecution Rests
FT. HOOD,Tex. — The government abruptly cut
short its assault case Tuesday against Sgt. David
Mitchell after three prosecution witnesses appeared at
his court martial and none was able to say whether the
defendant shot a single Vietnamese civilian at My Lai.
The defense tentatively was scheduled to open its
presentation Wednesday providing it could collect its
witnesses on short notice. Defense attorney Ossie Brown
told newsmen: "I think everybody was caught by
surprise."
The government had seven witnesses still on call when
the prosecutor, Capt. Michael Swan, announced at the
outset of the afternoon session on the second day of
testimony: "The prosecution rests."
"Have you talked to Washington about this?" he was
asked.
"Negative," Swain replied. None of the three
witnesses for the government was able to say whether
Mitchell actually cut down with rifly fire any of the
more than 100 unarmed Vietnamese civilians alleged to
have been slain by American troops at My Lai in 1968.
