# McCloskey Talks Ecology
## 
### RANDY LEWIS 
Politicians usually address
themselves to every issue of interest to
voters and expected benefit to
themselves. On Monday night,
Congressman Pete McCloskey expressed
views that he said might not benefit
himself, but that he nevertheless
supports—in a speech sponsored by
Zero Population Growth.
Dr. Paul Ehrlich, the biology
department crusader, introduced
McCloskey to 300 people in Cubberly's
overheated auditorium. Ehrlich
applauded the Congressman as a fighter
for environmental programs, before
ecology was fashionable.
The Representative espouses his
avant-garde views although "The
politician who urges new and
innovative ideas may well be defeated
in the next election."
"We should not increase the number

of people on this planet until it is
proven that Earth can support more
people." He attacked the government's
family planning programs as
"ineffective and unsuccessful," and
defended the individual's right to limit
his offspring.
"It is the right of every woman to be
able to control her own body,"
Congressman McCloskey said, and
described outdated abortion laws; just
ten states allow abortions for a woman
in early pregnancy. "It is in the best
interests of the nation to make
abortion free to all who can't afford
it." He recognized the need for a
national abortion law, but said that
"bills pertaining to abortion are not
likely to make it through any
committees as they now stand in the
House."
In the question period, McCloskey
commented on several issues not
covered in his speech:

Agnew—"Some politicians take
advantage of the fears, concerns, and
frustrations of the people to stimulate
political reaction. If the Vice-President
continues, I will personally lead a
'dump-Agnew' movement for 1972
starting immediately."
Bussing—"The 'local school' concept
should be followed as far as possible.
'Rule of Reason' should prevail."
Reagan—"Despite my disagreement
with him, Governor Reagan has done a
lot to increase the effieency of the
government of California." "He is the
most potentially dangerous man in the
Republican party."
Birth-control Laws—"When you
come to children having intercourse, I
don't think any government's laws will
have any effect."
Where are you going from here?—"l
think I'll go out and have a beer."

Politicians usually address
themselves to every issue of interest to
voters and expected benefit to
themselves. On Monday night,
Congressman Pete McCloskey expressed
views that he said might not benefit
himself, but that he nevertheless
supports—in a speech sponsored by
Zero Population Growth.
Dr. Paul Ehrlich, the biology
department crusader, introduced
McCloskey to 300 people in Cubberly's
overheated auditorium. Ehrlich
applauded the Congressman as a fighter
for environmental programs, before
ecology was fashionable.
The Representative espouses his
avant-garde views although "The
politician who urges new and
innovative ideas may well be defeated
in the next election."
"We should not increase the number

of people on this planet until it is
proven that Earth can support more
people." He attacked the government's
family planning programs as
"ineffective and unsuccessful," and
defended the individual's right to limit
his offspring.
"It is the right of every woman to be
able to control her own body,"
Congressman McCloskey said, and
described outdated abortion laws; just
ten states allow abortions for a woman
in early pregnancy. "It is in the best
interests of the nation to make
abortion free to all who can't afford
it." He recognized the need for a
national abortion law, but said that
"bills pertaining to abortion are not
likely to make it through any
committees as they now stand in the
House."
In the question period, McCloskey
commented on several issues not
covered in his speech:

Agnew—"Some politicians take
advantage of the fears, concerns, and
frustrations of the people to stimulate
political reaction. If the Vice-President
continues, I will personally lead a
'dump-Agnew' movement for 1972
starting immediately."
Bussing—"The 'local school' concept
should be followed as far as possible.
'Rule of Reason' should prevail."
Reagan—"Despite my disagreement
with him, Governor Reagan has done a
lot to increase the effieency of the
government of California." "He is the
most potentially dangerous man in the
Republican party."
Birth-control Laws—"When you
come to children having intercourse, I
don't think any government's laws will
have any effect."
Where are you going from here?—"l
think I'll go out and have a beer."
