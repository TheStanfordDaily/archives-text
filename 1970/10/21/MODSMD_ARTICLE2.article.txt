## 
### 
SANTA CRUZ (AP) — Authorities
pressed a search Tuesday night for the
killers of a wealthy eye surgeon, his
wife, two sons and secretary after
finding the family station wagon,
believed used as a getaway ear, burning
beside railroad tracks.
The five were found shot to death
Monday night, their bodies dumped in
a swimming pool at the doctor's
luxurious hilltop mansion.
They were I)r. Victor M. Ohta, 45;
his wife, Virginia, 43; sons Derrick 12,
and Taggart, 11, and the secretary,
Dorothy Cadwallader, 38.
Authorises said they found Mrs.
Ohta's station wagon Tuesday at a
Southern Pacific railroad tunnel in a

heavily wooded canyon 15 miles north
of the scene of the slaying. The SP
engineer said the .car was not on the
tracks when he passed the location at 3
p.m. but was there burning at 4:45
p.m.
A sheriff's spokesman earlier had
said the train struck the car.
Victims Hooded, Bound
Sheriff's deputies launched a search
and set up road blocks in the area, but
said they were discounting reports that
two men were seen fleeing from the
1968 green Oldsmobile. They did not
say why.
The bound and hooded bodies of
the murder victims were dumped into
the Ohta swimming pool where they
were discovered by firemen arriving to
fight a deliberately set fire in the
$250,000 hilltop mansion.
Prior to the discovery of Mrs. Ohta's
station wagon, Sheriff's Lt. Kenneth
Pittenger said no clues were evident.
Authorities would not speculate as
to whether the crimes were linked.
Arson
Fire fighters, summoned by
patrolling sheriff's deputies who
spotted the flames, had found the main
driveway, a steep, winding cut into the
hillside, blocked by the secretary's
Lincoln Continental.
A lane which gives access from the
other side was blocked by Dr. Ohta's
Rolls-Royce.
Sheriff Douglas James indicated
more than one person was believed to
be involved.

The intense fire, set in several parts
of the house, left only the home's shell
of flagstones standing.
'Like An Execution'
The wrists of the five victims were
bound in front of them with bright
scarves, red and other colors, and the
heads of three were swathed in scarves.
Two loose scarves in the pool indicated
the other two had been similarly
hooded.
Each was shot once in the back of
the head with a .30-caliber weapon. Dr.
Ohta had been shot also in the upper
part of the bake. All were fully clothed.
James and Pittenger said blood
spattered on the fiagstoned sundeck
facing the 30-by-20-foot pool indicated
the killings occurred there.
"It was like an execution," said
Pittenger.
Second Mass Slaying
Asked if it appeared to be ritualistic,
James said "There is a p> ssibility of
that, but here are ma~y possibilities."
It was the second mass slaying in
California in two years. Actress Sharon
Tate and six others were found shot
and stabbed to death in the Benedict
Canyon area of Los Angeles in August
1 969.
Hippie-style cult leader Charles M.
Manson and three young woman
followers are on trial in Los Angeles for
murder conspiracy in that case.
Officers searched what was left of
the house and four-acre plot on top of
a stefcp ridge. The location is four miles
southeast of Santa Cruz and 8 0 miles
south of San Francisco.


LIBERATION—Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, Erika Huggins and the Chicago 7 have often been supported on this kind of
poster as highly deserving candidates for freedom. However, the freeing intended for Puppies seems to be of a distinctly less
significant and gratifying sort.
