# Lyman Explains Why Staff Must Work On Nov. 3
## 
### 
The only justification for the
Princeton plan, whereby students are
allowed days off school before the
elections, is that students don't live
where they vote, president Richard
Lyman said in a KZSU press conference
last night.
Responding to a question from Chris
Hocker of the Arena as to why
students, but not staff, will be given
two days off to work in the November
elections, Lyman said that staff
members are not in the same position
as students may be in, such as living
3000 miles from Stanford. In order to
avoid "being labelled carpetbaggers",
he said students should be allowed
flexible scheduling and should be free
to work in their home communities.
Stanford's two day election plan
results from the recommendation of a
special committee appointed last May
under former President Kenneth Pitzer.
Lyman said the results of the plan will
be carefully evaluated to judge whether

such plans may be feasible in the
future.
Chicanismo representative David
Garcia asked Lyman to comment on
the higher concentration of minorities
in certain campus residences. Said
Lyman, "I just hope we can strike a
reasonable balance when minority
students don't feel that they are
suppressed by isolation on one hand,
and where they are present in enough
different places so that their impact is
fell by Stanford as a whole and not just
by one section of Stanford."
Referring to rumors of cuts in the
minority financial aid program Lyman
said, "1 worry about the limitations on
the financial aid we have because I'm
afraid we may end up a University that
is composed of mostly of very well to
do students and then with a minority
of very impoverished students. I don't
mean when 1 say that to suggest that 1
intend or have any notion of cutting
down on the aid available to minority
students todav."
