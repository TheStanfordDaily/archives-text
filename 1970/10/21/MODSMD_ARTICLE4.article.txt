# Cowell Psychiatric Staff Offers Aid
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
If Cowell Health Center only
provided overseas immunization shots,
allergy shots, and"the pill," most
students would still be satisfied. But
1000 students, or roughly one-twelfth
of the student population, sought
psychiatric assistance last year and
according to the Mental Health and
Psychiatric Services (MHPS) director
Dr. David Dorosin, things are even
busier this fall.
"Seniors and first-year grad students
constitute the highest percentage of
those who utilize our facilities," said
Dorosin, who is entering his third year
as director of MHPS. "Most people see
us as a center that deals with a bunch
of anxious freshmen, but that's simply
not the case."
Dr. Dorosin said that many students
decide to seek psychiatric assistance
only after they've experienced "feeling
of high-level anxiety or depression, and
fear that they might lose control of
themselves.

"Some of the people we see, I wish
we'd seen earlier," he commented.
Depression
The depression of which Dr. Dorosin
speaks results mainly from personal
crises or the failure to live up to high
expectations. "Breaking up with a guy
or a girl is seen as having more
profound implications," said Dorosin.
"It results in the serious questioning of
personal adequacy. These students
inscribe their personal saga in the
context of how they feel today."
Dorosin dismissed academic pressure
as a major cause of depression, saying
"problems related to them (the
students) being people" have more
impact upon the individual.
Depressed people may harbor ideas
of suicide, according to Dorosin, and he
views these feelings of desperation,
especially in the young, as particularly
tragic. "They have their health, their
youth, and their future, yet they
contemplate an irreversible act to solve
reversible problems."

i Last year there were two student
suicides â€” one in the summer session
and one during the regular academic
year. Dorosin knows of twenty or
thirty unsuccessful attempts, all of
which were automatically referred to
the MHPS.
"Depression is treatable through
psychotherapy and drugs," said
Dorosin, citing the frequent use of
tranquilizers and a nti-depressants.
"Depression is a state, not a fate."
Homosexuality?
The MHPS' seemingly limited
exposure to homosexuality focuses
mainly on people who are concerned
about what they see as homosexual
tendencies.
"For the most part," observes
Dorosin, "other human needs are being
met. Two roommates who tell each other
things they've never told anyone else
before may discover some very tender
feelings between them. Then there is a
wonderment of homosexuality.
"Can you like, admire or envy
another guy? Is that homosexuality? I
personally don't think so."
Of the "real" homosexuals who have
sought assistance, many experience
crises similar to their heterosexual
counterparts. "A guy breaks up with a
guy," observed Dorosin. "They
(homosexuals) have the same basic
problems."
Dorosin expressed mixed emotions
when asked about encounter groups
and their effect upon the people in
them. "There are some very gifted
people doing encounter therapy," he
said, and the group technique can be
very powerful.
"But. it's who's using this technique
that's important. Before anybody
decides to take part in this sort of
experience, he should know about the
leader, his qualifications, and the
devices he intends to employ.

"I have no objection to intimacy,"
he continued, "but coercive intimacy,
or demeaning or intrusive techniques
can be harmful to the individuals
involved."
Dorosin acknowledged that a
number of students have come to him
and other members of his staff as a
result of bad experiences in encounter
groups. Dorosin described these
"psychiatric casualties" as people who
"used a group as therapy and not as a
growth experience. As a result, they
felt disappointed with the group.
"People who have these specific
problems should consult a psychiatrist
at Co well."
Intimidated
Dorosin pointed out that many
students who should seek psychiatric
consultation are driven away because
"seeing a professional is threatening,
and seeing a psychiatrist has the
erroneous connotation that the patient
is severely ill.
The Daily also suggested, last Spring,
that there had been a compromise in
our standards of confidentiality. 1 want
to emphasize that information is
released only at the request of the
'ndividual student."
The Mil PS staff consists of
psychiatrists, psychiatric social
workers, and a psychologist. 'Hie
services are free, and because of the
expanding staff, which has now moved
some of its offices to the Kims on 535
Salvitierra, appointments are generally
very easy to obtain.
Other members of the MIIPS staff
include, Dr. Vince D'Andrea, former
Director of Psychiatry in the Peace
Corps, Mr. Curt Baldwin, a social
worker who deals mainly with black
and minority groups students, Mrs.
Jewelle Gibbs, also a social worker, Mrs.
Charlotte Diegal, a psychiatric social
worker, and Dr. Marvin Cerst, a
psychiatrist.
