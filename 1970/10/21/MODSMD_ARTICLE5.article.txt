# Today In The 'Daily'
## 
### 
Today is election day. Not the real election day, when we get
to choose between Sir Ronald and Big Daddy; that comes next
month. But an election day, nonetheless.
A final golden opportunity to vote for the senate candidates
of your choice begins at 8:45 a.m. today at the Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Med School Lounge, Physics Tank, and the
Biz School Lounge. These locations will remain open until 4:15
p.m.
Two additional polling places will be open for shorter hours:
the Comp Center and the Law School Lounge. They will be
open from 10 a.m. â€¢ 2 p.m.
Notices of election discrepencies will be accepted gladly by
the DAILY news office at x 4632. If you had to rip off this
paper because one wasn't delivered to your dorm or frat, call
our friendly business office at 327-4150.
