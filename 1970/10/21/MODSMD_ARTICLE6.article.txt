## Make Hay While the Revolution Shines

Daily Pennsylvania.)
Not unknown for its predatory
ability to make fortunes out of
newly discovered products,
America's marketing
establishment is now making hay
out of our movement.
The same people who sold Ub
Mickey Mouse watches and
Hopalong Cassidy shirts are now
hawking a bill of goods that
includes such flashily marketable

items as peace, love, music, and
maybe even a little cinemagraphic
revolution. They have proposed
and we have accepted a fairy-tale
world in which appearances often
supercede truths and in which our
actions are dictated more by our
publicized roles than by our
considered intentions.
We are in the awkward position
of having created a
political-cultural movement whose
political side has failed to keep

pace with the profitability of its
cultural counterpart. Political
change still isn't selling very well,
but all the cultural gimcracks that
have grown up around the
political nucleus have become
eminently marketable
commodities.
'Light Revolution'
While the Resistance lives from
hand-to-mouth and the Panthers
struggle to raise astronomical
amounts of bail money, Madison

Avenue sells us "light revolution"
at a mark-up through myriads of
pretentious boutiques and
presumptuous "youth-oriented"
movies. All those expensive
leather fringes, purple shirts, and
factory-bleached denims are
attractive items, but they become
insidious when we begin to attach
more than a sartorial significance
to the act of wearing nifty duds.
"Youth-oriented" films also
fall into the same category of

"cultural rip-offs" if we view
them as anything more than
superficial entertainment. To pay
three or four dollars to watch
other people participate in a three
day bachannalia complete with
bare breasts and bottoms in living
color smacks of revolutionary 1
masturbation rather than cultural
awakening. We can't really attain
love or peace by watching the film
documentary of a youthful
version of the Rotarians' last
convention in Atlantic City.
Time Magazine
The problem arises in rejecting
the voyeuristic habits that years
of Television and Time Magazine
have instilled in each of us. We are
too used to deriving our identities
from the media and the
marketplace, rather than from
ourselves, too accustomed to the
blatant exploitation of our
self-images in the same way that
miracle plastics are promoted. In
fact, even a rejection of that
exploitation may result in a
profitable event when the facts
are turned over to our country's
image makers. Thus, the backers
of the Woodstock festival
recouped their widely-publicized
festival losses through their highly
successful movie, even though the
movie failed to deal with the fact
that at peast 300 000 supposedly
"peace-loving" individuals had
crashed the festival gates in order
to avoid purchasing their own
illusions.
Thus, the question is one of
buying our own image. It's all
right if THEY believe in the whole
"youth revolution" symbolic mess
and rush out to buy tailored bells
and ten dollar stylings to make
long hair look short, but it
becomes dangerous when WE
begin to buy and believe in the
cultural scrapple that gets served
up like fast cars and long
cigarettes. When that happens our
vaunted "youth movement" will
be on its way to an expensively
corrupt senility.

have grown up around the
political nucleus have become
eminently marketable
commodities.
'Light Revolution'
While the Resistance lives from
hand-to-mouth and the Panthers
struggle to raise astronomical
amounts of bail money, Madison

Avenue sells us "light revolution"
at a mark-up through myriads of
pretentious boutiques and
presumptuous "youth-oriented"
movies. All those expensive
leather fringes, purple shirts, and
factory-bleached denims are
attractive items, but they become
insidious when we begin to attach
more than a sartorial significance
to the act of wearing nifty duds.
"Youth-oriented" films also
fall into the same category of

"cultural rip-offs" if we view
them as anything more than
superficial entertainment. To pay
three or four dollars to watch
other people participate in a three
day bachannalia complete with
bare breasts and bottoms in living
color smacks of revolutionary 1
masturbation rather than cultural
awakening. We can't really attain
love or peace by watching the film
documentary of a youthful
version of the Rotarians' last
convention in Atlantic City.
Time Magazine
The problem arises in rejecting
the voyeuristic habits that years
of Television and Time Magazine
have instilled in each of us. We are
too used to deriving our identities
from the media and the
marketplace, rather than from
ourselves, too accustomed to the
blatant exploitation of our
self-images in the same way that
miracle plastics are promoted. In
fact, even a rejection of that
exploitation may result in a
profitable event when the facts
are turned over to our country's
image makers. Thus, the backers
of the Woodstock festival
recouped their widely-publicized
festival losses through their highly
successful movie, even though the
movie failed to deal with the fact
that at peast 300 000 supposedly
"peace-loving" individuals had
crashed the festival gates in order
to avoid purchasing their own
illusions.
Thus, the question is one of
buying our own image. It's all
right if THEY believe in the whole
"youth revolution" symbolic mess
and rush out to buy tailored bells
and ten dollar stylings to make
long hair look short, but it
becomes dangerous when WE
begin to buy and believe in the
cultural scrapple that gets served
up like fast cars and long
cigarettes. When that happens our
vaunted "youth movement" will
be on its way to an expensively
corrupt senility.

Not unknown for its predatory
ability to make fortunes out of
newly discovered products,
America's marketing
establishment is now making hay
out of our movement.
The same people who sold Ub
Mickey Mouse watches and
Hopalong Cassidy shirts are now
hawking a bill of goods that
includes such flashily marketable

items as peace, love, music, and
maybe even a little cinemagraphic
revolution. They have proposed
and we have accepted a fairy-tale
world in which appearances often
supercede truths and in which our
actions are dictated more by our
publicized roles than by our
considered intentions.
We are in the awkward position
of having created a
political-cultural movement whose
political side has failed to keep

pace with the profitability of its
cultural counterpart. Political
change still isn't selling very well,
but all the cultural gimcracks that
have grown up around the
political nucleus have become
eminently marketable
commodities.
