Daily
Nonâ€”Partisan?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Approximately ten days ago
the Daily refused to print a
column that I had written on the
grounds that I was a candidate for
the ASSU Senate and the
elections were in the near future.
The Daily editors and I then
negotiated on running the column
unsigned, but I later withdrew the
column on the basis of timeliness.
Since that time the Daily ran a
column (quite a good one)
co-authored by Elise Becket, a
candidate from the Law School.
And today there is a front page
advertisement (some claim it is a
story) from the Young
Republicans featuring several
candidates from their slate.
Am I correct in assuming that
Mr. Miller (news editor Frank
Miller) is not bound by the rules
requiring non-partisan columns in
the pre-election period? Does the
Daily staff see no conflict in its
actions?

Apology
Editor, THE DAILY:
As I tried to explain to Doug
Toms on Sunday, I apologize for
any unconscious racism in my
cartoon of October 16.

Call For Help
(The following is the text of a
letter received by the ASSU
Council of Presidents.)
Wanblee, South Dakota is a
small town located on the eastern
end of the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation. Though our town has
a population of 70 0 there are only
two grocery stores a post office a

laundromat and a health center.
There are no recreational or
educational facilities with the
exception of two elementary
schools and a Headstart school.
We, the Wanblee Wicoskalaka
Club are a group of 14 young
women between the ages of 2 0
and 30 years, Indian and
Non-Indian, mostly housewives
and mothers. We first organized
out of sheer desperation for
something to do. Our original goal
was mainly for self improvement.
We soon realized that others in
our town felt the same.
We have undertaken the
project of starting a library for
our town, since the nearest public
library is 45 miles away. We do
have some money we raised
through bingo games and club
dues. We have a contribution of
some books and some furniture.
But we have found that we cannot
meet all of the expenses of
purchasing supplies to renovate
the building and acquire more
books and furniture without your
help.
We are appealing to you for
books, money, furniture, paint
and anything you think might be
useful to our library.
Francine Red Willow, Chairman
& Members of the Wanblee
Wicoskalaka Club
(If you have any bocks you would
like to contribute, bring them to
the ASSU Office in TMU.
Contributions to pay for shipping
costs will be gladly accepted.)
Nice Things
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to extend my
congratulations to all of those
who worked so hard to have
military training, taught by
military officers removed from
campus. For the second year we
have been foiled by 'he
administration. This is not the
kind of action that is conducive to
non-violent protest.

I suspect that the kind of
cooperation that the
administration can expect from
students will reflect the
cooperation that the university
gives the students. When the rocks
start to fly, I am going to hide. If
the school stays open this quarter,
we might even go to the Rose
Bowl. It would be nice, but I ami
afraid the time for nice things has
been pre-empted.
