# Freshmen Politically Uncertain

"My Dad getb really uptight about violence. He
doesi't really care about dope, but violence,
whew! I don't think he would mind anything that
I did at Stanford," says one freshman," except
destroying other people's property."
Expecting the University to be a seething mass
of political activity, this year's freshman class is
ready for politics, but quite uncertain about the
degree to which they want to be involved.
Their own uncertainty about violence as a
political weapon and their parents' fierce backlash
against the past Spring's protesting have created a
dilemma for the Class of 1 97 4.
Essentially, they seem to believe in activism,
but not violence.
"I thought there would be a radical around
every corner," says a Mirlo freshman. "I thought
that professors would preach revolution, so I was
surprised to find how conservative this University
was."
Confused and Worried
Interviews with freshmen at Branner, Trancos,
Mirlo, and Loro reveal that both parents and
students exaggerated the events of last Spring.
Incoming students were confused over and worried
about these reports, and some parents even
discouraged their offspring from entering
Stanford.
"My parents were getting all the Alumni Mags
last spring," said Tom Armstrong of Trancos, "and
they were really scared." A type of parental
paranois about "outside agitation" influenced
some parents. Lis Hudson of Branner says, "My
mother is positive that there was a 'center' where

students were being indoctrinated, and she believes
that the people who were causing the riots weren't
students."
In many cases, parents, relatives, and family
friends exerted considerable pressure on the
incoming freshmen to think twice about Stanford
after the nights of violence in the Spring.
"My parents would rather have had me not go
to school this year—or at least they would have
preferred me to go somewhere up in the sticks,"
commented one Loro freshman. The parents of
the Dallas frosh, after announcing that their son,
Porter, would attend Stanford, were told by a
friend, "If you send him to that place it will be
like a one-way ticket to hell."
Palm Tree Lane
In at least these two instances, the lure of the
forbidden California palm trees overcame the grim
rhetoric of worried parents. Freshmen do,
however, echo their parents concerns about
violence and the destruction of property. Few
condone violence; most believe it unwarranted.
"I might agree with what student activists
said," claimed a Mirlo coed* "but if they espoused
violent tactics, I would turn against them and their
political movement. I should think that after Kent
State most people would realize that violence does
not bring answers."
Loro's Kevin disagrees. "I think that violence
can be justified," he declared, "if one goes through
all the peaceful rallies and demonstrations, and the
people still don't respond. The issue, however,
would have to be pretty important, and violence
definitely a last resort."

But his roommate and a second friend present
side with the Mirlo coed. They do not condone
violence.
One Loro student declared, "As long as an
education is being sold here, I'll be buying it."
Another added, "The first thing that a person
forgets is that his parents or somebody else is
paying for that education." He did admit that
whatever pressures parents exert on the student's
own values are extensively eroded as the academic
year progresses.
"You have to take in everything now, get
everybody's viewpoint. Now, my only
responsibility is to myself. I really have no
obligation to my parents or anyone else," thought
a freshman from lowa.
"Think For Yourself"
A Branner coed agreed. "You have to think for
yourself," she pointed out. "Thinking for yourself
doesn't invalidate what parents and others say, but
I think twice about everything now."
"If I find something that is really important to
me, I'll march and demonstrate," said one Mirlo
co-ed. "But I'm not that sure now. I'd have to
think about it really hard," replied a Houston
freshman. "I'd have to examine the goals. My
parents would be upset, but I'd hope that I
wouldn't get into something I couldn't explain and
justify."
Whether the generation which the Class of '74
represents will be another silent generation—or one
committed to effecting social change—is only a
point of conjecture now. There is no question that
the university environment will play the critical
role.

GREAT EXPECTATIONS—"My parents were getting all the Alumni mags last
Spring, and they were really scared." Parental paranoia notwithstanding, frosh
are discovering that the University is not yet the hotbed of radicalism they had
expected.
