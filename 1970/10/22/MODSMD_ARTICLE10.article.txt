# Card Runners Beat SC, San Jose State
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Captain Don Kardong and
Arvid Kretz took the top two
places in Stanford's triangular
meet here last Saturday with USC
and San Jose State to give the
Indians an important victory in
their second effort of the season.
Junior Robert Coe finished
fourth in the race for Stanford,
coming in ten seconds behind San
Jose State's top runner, Gary
Hanson. The highest placing that
USC could manage was sixth.
Coach Marshall Clark was
pleasantly surprised by the strong
performances of Brian
Mittelstaedt and Duncan
Mac Donald who finished eighth
and ninth. Normally middle
distance men, Mittelstaedt and
Mad Donald excelled at the
grueling six mile distance and
displaced a cluster of four USC
runners to give Stanford the meet
championship.
Rick Geisler came in 16 th for
the Cards, and freshmen Peter
Fitzmaurice and Neil Bernstein
finished 19th and 33nd. Bernie
Lahde did not compete due to
hampering leg injuries.
Coach Clark attributed the
easy victory (Stanford 24, USC
46, San Jose State 56) to the fact
that Saturday's meet was the first
competition for USC this year.
USC packed their top six runners
into eight places, though, and
could prove a threat in the Pac-8

meet with tnat type of depth. San
Jose State had two fine individual
runners that finished third and
fifth, but they could not mount a
team threat to the Indians.
Stanford meets UCLA in a dual
meet in Los Angeles this
Saturday, and Clark is
approaching the meet with
cautions optimism. UCLA
defeated the Cards by one point
here last year, after being edged
by Stanford by four points the
year before. Clark expects the
meet this Saturday to be just as
close as the past two contests.
UCLA lost four of their top
five runners from last season, but
have strengthened their squad
with junior college and freshmen
prospects. Last week, the Bruins
mauled a good Cal team at
Berkeley, as two UCLA runners
broke the course record.
In discussing the Bruin's
strength, Clark said, "Like us,
UCLA depends on their top
runners. I think that they areata
better racing edge, although we
have more experience. It promises
to be a very tough meet."
The meet will be run on a 5 5
mile course that wanders through
the UCLA campus. The course is
very hilly and will provide a severe
test for Stanford's men who are
accustomed to a flatter layout.
The race will begin at 10 a.m. on
the track and any Stanford
students down for the football
game are encouraged to attend.
