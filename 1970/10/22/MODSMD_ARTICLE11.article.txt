# Bright Season In Store For Indian Tennis Team
## 
### HALL DAILY 
One year ago veteran Stanford
tennis coach, Dick Gould,
predicted that the Braves would
finish in the top six in national
competition. Last June at the
NCAA Tennis finals, Stanford
finished fifth.
It was the best finish for the
Stanfordians since 1942. And the
Indian netters also revenged two
earlier season losses to Southern
Cal by outpointing the Trojans in
the NCAA finals.
This year Gould figures
Stanford to be one of the top
three teams nationally. With six of
seven starters coming back, the
Indians should have the
experience and depth necessary to
challenge the SC-UCLA

dominance of Pac-8, West Coast,
and national intercollegiate tennis.
Heralded sophomore Roscoe
Tanner lived up to others'
expectations this summer as he
captured the National Amateur
Clay Court Championships by
defeating Marcelo Lara, top USC
prospect, and Haroon Rahim,
UCLA' premier player.
Tanner, first freshmen ever to
reach the NCAA finals in both
singles and doubles, was also
named to the All-American Team.
Number two varsity standout,
sophomore Rick Fisher won the
Western Pennsylvania Doubles
Championships with Tanner and
"played consistently in his
toughest matches while gaining
confidence and experience,"
according to Coach Gould.
Sophomore Gerry Groslimond,
whose 17-2 varsity record topped
last year's club victory skein, aveng
ed a previous loss to SC's George
Taylor in the NCAA's and will be
ranked sixth nationally in the
Juniors.
Highly-touted Stan Pasarell had
a great summer with impressive
victories over Canadian Davis
Cupper Peter Bruwash, Cal's Bob

Alloo, and German Davis Cupper
Jurgen Fossenbender.
Other experienced netmen
returning include seniors Paul
Marienthal and Bill Atkins, 1969
co-captains and seasoned regulars;
junior standouts Chris Chapin,
Rich Evans, ailing John Wright,
former Junior Davis Cupper
MacClaflin, and Bill Rompf; and
sophomore stalwarts Jim Healy,
Wes Hampton, and Jeremy Levin.
Heading the list of recruits
from the class of '74 is Alex
"Sandy" Mayer from Woodmere,
New York. Mayer's list of tributes
begins with solid victories over
UCLA's Bob Kreiss, International
Orange Bowl Champion Harold
Solomon, USC's Dick Bornstedt,
and California veteran Bob
Potthast.
Sandy was a finalist in both
singles and doubles at the
National Juniors and won the
doubles. Ranked third nationally,
he is reigning Eastern Hard Court
Champion and an excellent
doubles player.
Another top prospect is Paul
Sidone from Pebble Beach. Paul
holds an impressive list of
victories to his credit and "has
lots of potential," Gould says.
Paul is eleventh ranked in the
national juniors.
Coach Gould will also be
looking for help from another
nationally ranked freshmen
Tim Noonan of Springfied, Ohio.
