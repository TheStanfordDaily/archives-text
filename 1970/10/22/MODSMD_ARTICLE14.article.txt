Police Station Attacked
CAIRO, ILL. — Police said sniper fire crackled
in numerous spots around this racially divided town
yesterday night, temporarily pinning police behind an
armor barricade in their station.
Some police, armed with pistols, carbines
submachine guns, took cover behind buildings near
the station and blasted back at the snipers.
Police Sgt. Frank Canupp said thousands of rounds
had been fired—"and I mean thousands."
"The shooting is all over town," Canupp said by
telephone. "Everywhere. This is one of the worst
nights we've ever had."
Joe Culver, a newsman for the Cairo Evening
Citizen, was inside the police station, which was
surrounded by two sheets of thick steel plating. He
said hundreds of rounds had been fired into the
building.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Tensions had risen Wednesday after a fire that
officials termed "deninitely arson" razed a Veterans
of Foreign Wars hall and a white railroad worker was
seriously stabbed by a black man at the scene of the
fire.
Shooting erupted as night fell.
Dohrn Goes To Algiers
ALGIERS — Black Panther leader Eldridge
Cleaver said today a "Miss Dohrn" had joined him
and Dr. Timothy Leary in exile here but refused to
say if she was Bernardine Dohrn, the student radical
on the FBl's list of 10 most wanted persons.
He said he would explain everything at a news
conference later in the day but would not say
whether the Miss Dohrn was Bernardine or as reports
outside Algeria said her sister Jenifer.
A newsman talking to Cleaver by telephone
Wednesday understood him to refer to Bernardine
Dohrn. But when he was contacted iater, Cleaver
said: "I talked about Miss Dohrn. Everything will be
explained at the press conference."
In the first conversation Cleaver had spoken of the
flight to Algiers of "Miss Dohrn" as "a blow to
American imperialism" and as showing FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover and his organization "as the .paper
tipers thpy are."

Rumors had been circulating for several days that
Bernardine Dohrn, 28, who replaced Black Panther
militant Angela Davis on the FBI list after Miss Davis
was arrested last week, had arrived in this haven for
top political refugees.
Ceasefire Rejected
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu has
summoned his military and political leaders to a
weekend conference, touching off speculation about
the possibility that the United States and South
Vietnam will soon declare a unilateral cease-fire in
South Vietnam. But the White House in Washington
denied it.
Saigon newspapers reported yesterday that Thieu
already had instructed all provincial governors and
mayors to provide maximum protection in their areas
in preparation for a cease-fire.
Informed sources said Thieu's instructions were to
eliminate Viet Cong or their sympathizers who might
try to claim land was under their control following
the cease-fire.
A one-sided truce would appear to be an extension
of President Nixon's peace proposal made Oct. 7.
Among other things, Nixon proposed a cease-fire
proclaimed by both sides. North Vietnam and the
Viet Cong rejected the proposal.
In Washington, however, the presidential press
secretary, Ronald L. Ziegler, said "we plan no
announcement beyond the ones we already have
made on Vitenam." This referred to Nixon's peace
plan.
Ziegler said the United States believes that
negotiation "is the quickest way to gain a peace in
Vietnam and Indochina and that is the path we are
pursuing."
Living Costs Rise
WASHINGTON — Living costs advanced more
swiftly last month and the purchasing power of
millions of workers showed the biggest annual drop in
,more than six years, the government said yesterday.
The price rise of four-tenths of one percent and the
cut in workers' earnings buying power soarkpri anew

the political debate over whether President Nixon's
anti-inflation policies are working.
"We certainly are not discouraged by this," said
chief White House economic adviser Paul McCracken,
'noting that the rise in living costs in the third quarter
of 1 970 had slowed despite the September jump.
But Democratic National Chairman Lawrence F.
O'Brien said "Mr. Nixon and his Republican
economic advisers have fa.led. It is time for the voters
to render their verdict."
AFL-CIO President George Meany, representing
some 1 3.6 million union members, also blamed Nixon
for rising prices, falling purchasing power and
increased unemployment.
The $1 .5 9 drop over the year was the biggest since
the bureau started keeping tabs on the figure in
January 1964.
The bureau's assistant commissioner, Dr. Joel
Popkin, said the sharp drop in hours of work,
earnings and purchasing power may have been
exaggerated because the figures were compiled in the
week including Labor Day. Many workers got the day
off but without pay, he said.
The September price report said the rise was
largely caused by higher costs for clothing, houses
and consumer services, while food prices did not drop
as much as usual for the month. The four-tenths
rise was double the August gain of two-tenths which
the White House had hailed as "the most solid
evidence we've yet had" that Nixon's economic
restrictions are curbing inflation.

Borlaug, a quiet scientist who has made harvests more

cut in workers' earnings buying power soarkpri anew

the political debate over whether President Nixon's
anti-inflation policies are working.
"We certainly are not discouraged by this," said
chief White House economic adviser Paul McCracken,
'noting that the rise in living costs in the third quarter
of 1 970 had slowed despite the September jump.
But Democratic National Chairman Lawrence F.
O'Brien said "Mr. Nixon and his Republican
economic advisers have fa.led. It is time for the voters
to render their verdict."
AFL-CIO President George Meany, representing
some 1 3.6 million union members, also blamed Nixon
for rising prices, falling purchasing power and
increased unemployment.
The $1 .5 9 drop over the year was the biggest since
the bureau started keeping tabs on the figure in
January 1964.
The bureau's assistant commissioner, Dr. Joel
Popkin, said the sharp drop in hours of work,
earnings and purchasing power may have been
exaggerated because the figures were compiled in the
week including Labor Day. Many workers got the day
off but without pay, he said.
The September price report said the rise was
largely caused by higher costs for clothing, houses
and consumer services, while food prices did not drop
as much as usual for the month. The four-tenths
rise was double the August gain of two-tenths which
the White House had hailed as "the most solid
evidence we've yet had" that Nixon's economic
restrictions are curbing inflation.

Police Station Attacked
CAIRO, ILL. — Police said sniper fire crackled
in numerous spots around this racially divided town
yesterday night, temporarily pinning police behind an
armor barricade in their station.
Some police, armed with pistols, carbines
submachine guns, took cover behind buildings near
the station and blasted back at the snipers.
Police Sgt. Frank Canupp said thousands of rounds
had been fired—"and I mean thousands."
"The shooting is all over town," Canupp said by
telephone. "Everywhere. This is one of the worst
nights we've ever had."
Joe Culver, a newsman for the Cairo Evening
Citizen, was inside the police station, which was
surrounded by two sheets of thick steel plating. He
said hundreds of rounds had been fired into the
building.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Tensions had risen Wednesday after a fire that
officials termed "deninitely arson" razed a Veterans
of Foreign Wars hall and a white railroad worker was
seriously stabbed by a black man at the scene of the
fire.
Shooting erupted as night fell.
Dohrn Goes To Algiers
ALGIERS — Black Panther leader Eldridge
Cleaver said today a "Miss Dohrn" had joined him
and Dr. Timothy Leary in exile here but refused to
say if she was Bernardine Dohrn, the student radical
on the FBl's list of 10 most wanted persons.
He said he would explain everything at a news
conference later in the day but would not say
whether the Miss Dohrn was Bernardine or as reports
outside Algeria said her sister Jenifer.
A newsman talking to Cleaver by telephone
Wednesday understood him to refer to Bernardine
Dohrn. But when he was contacted iater, Cleaver
said: "I talked about Miss Dohrn. Everything will be
explained at the press conference."
In the first conversation Cleaver had spoken of the
flight to Algiers of "Miss Dohrn" as "a blow to
American imperialism" and as showing FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover and his organization "as the .paper
tipers thpy are."

Rumors had been circulating for several days that
Bernardine Dohrn, 28, who replaced Black Panther
militant Angela Davis on the FBI list after Miss Davis
was arrested last week, had arrived in this haven for
top political refugees.
Ceasefire Rejected
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu has
summoned his military and political leaders to a
weekend conference, touching off speculation about
the possibility that the United States and South
Vietnam will soon declare a unilateral cease-fire in
South Vietnam. But the White House in Washington
denied it.
Saigon newspapers reported yesterday that Thieu
already had instructed all provincial governors and
mayors to provide maximum protection in their areas
in preparation for a cease-fire.
Informed sources said Thieu's instructions were to
eliminate Viet Cong or their sympathizers who might
try to claim land was under their control following
the cease-fire.
A one-sided truce would appear to be an extension
of President Nixon's peace proposal made Oct. 7.
Among other things, Nixon proposed a cease-fire
proclaimed by both sides. North Vietnam and the
Viet Cong rejected the proposal.
In Washington, however, the presidential press
secretary, Ronald L. Ziegler, said "we plan no
announcement beyond the ones we already have
made on Vitenam." This referred to Nixon's peace
plan.
Ziegler said the United States believes that
negotiation "is the quickest way to gain a peace in
Vietnam and Indochina and that is the path we are
pursuing."

Wednesday understood him to refer to Bernardine
Dohrn. But when he was contacted iater, Cleaver
said: "I talked about Miss Dohrn. Everything will be
explained at the press conference."
In the first conversation Cleaver had spoken of the
flight to Algiers of "Miss Dohrn" as "a blow to
American imperialism" and as showing FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover and his organization "as the .paper

Rumors had been circulating for several days that
Bernardine Dohrn, 28, who replaced Black Panther
militant Angela Davis on the FBI list after Miss Davis
was arrested last week, had arrived in this haven for
top political refugees.
Ceasefire Rejected
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu has
summoned his military and political leaders to a
weekend conference, touching off speculation about
the possibility that the United States and South
Vietnam will soon declare a unilateral cease-fire in
South Vietnam. But the White House in Washington
denied it.
Saigon newspapers reported yesterday that Thieu
already had instructed all provincial governors and
mayors to provide maximum protection in their areas
in preparation for a cease-fire.
Informed sources said Thieu's instructions were to
eliminate Viet Cong or their sympathizers who might
try to claim land was under their control following
the cease-fire.
A one-sided truce would appear to be an extension
of President Nixon's peace proposal made Oct. 7.
Among other things, Nixon proposed a cease-fire
proclaimed by both sides. North Vietnam and the
Viet Cong rejected the proposal.
In Washington, however, the presidential press
secretary, Ronald L. Ziegler, said "we plan no
announcement beyond the ones we already have
made on Vitenam." This referred to Nixon's peace
plan.
Ziegler said the United States believes that
negotiation "is the quickest way to gain a peace in
Vietnam and Indochina and that is the path we are
pursuing."
Living Costs Rise
WASHINGTON — Living costs advanced more
swiftly last month and the purchasing power of
millions of workers showed the biggest annual drop in
,more than six years, the government said yesterday.
The price rise of four-tenths of one percent and the
cut in workers' earnings buying power soarkpri anew

the political debate over whether President Nixon's
anti-inflation policies are working.
"We certainly are not discouraged by this," said
chief White House economic adviser Paul McCracken,
'noting that the rise in living costs in the third quarter
of 1 970 had slowed despite the September jump.
But Democratic National Chairman Lawrence F.
O'Brien said "Mr. Nixon and his Republican
economic advisers have fa.led. It is time for the voters
to render their verdict."
AFL-CIO President George Meany, representing
some 1 3.6 million union members, also blamed Nixon
for rising prices, falling purchasing power and
increased unemployment.
The $1 .5 9 drop over the year was the biggest since
the bureau started keeping tabs on the figure in
January 1964.
The bureau's assistant commissioner, Dr. Joel
Popkin, said the sharp drop in hours of work,
earnings and purchasing power may have been
exaggerated because the figures were compiled in the
week including Labor Day. Many workers got the day
off but without pay, he said.
The September price report said the rise was
largely caused by higher costs for clothing, houses
and consumer services, while food prices did not drop
as much as usual for the month. The four-tenths
rise was double the August gain of two-tenths which
the White House had hailed as "the most solid
evidence we've yet had" that Nixon's economic
restrictions are curbing inflation.

Police Station Attacked
CAIRO, ILL. — Police said sniper fire crackled
in numerous spots around this racially divided town
yesterday night, temporarily pinning police behind an
armor barricade in their station.

submachine guns, took cover behind buildings near
the station and blasted back at the snipers.
Police Sgt. Frank Canupp said thousands of rounds
had been fired—"and I mean thousands."
"The shooting is all over town," Canupp said by
telephone. "Everywhere. This is one of the worst
nights we've ever had."
Joe Culver, a newsman for the Cairo Evening
Citizen, was inside the police station, which was
surrounded by two sheets of thick steel plating. He
said hundreds of rounds had been fired into the
building.
