# Accounting Method Allows Immediate Utility Of Funds

### JEFF WORK 
A major re-distribution of funds
derived from Stanford's leasing of
industrial park land will inject an
annual $892,000 into the University
budget.
Formerly Stanford has leased
property in the industrial park to
individual firms for a total sum of $5 0
million, but has not derived the
maximum benefit from its lease.
The industrial park lease has
historically been a pre-paid proposition,
generating $4 0 million. In the past,
Stanford has been able to employ only
the compounded interest on this
principle, amounting to $10 million
over a fifty year period.
However, the problem has been that
the $4 0 million principle has never
been touched by the University. It is, in
effect, part of Stanford's endowment,
and therefore only the annual interest
could be employed _

A proposal from Yale Braunstein, a
graduate student in Economics, Bob
Grant, ASSU Council of Presidents
member, and Ken Cuthbertson, Vice
President of Finance and (J. L. Bach,
Professor of Economics officially
proposed two years ago by trustee Fred
Merrill has altered the financial
structure.
Stanford will now receive monetary
benefit from both the principle and the
interest annually. In economic terms,
this re-structuring is labeled
"amortizing the principle."
The amortizing has been structured
so that by the end of the fifty-year
lease, all the principle will have been
used up, and the property will once
again be up for lease.
Roughly $1 million will be injected
into Stanford's yearly operating
budget, it is predicted. "In fairness,"
noted Bob Grant, "this is a much better
