# Soquel Massacre Widens Town-Hippie Rift
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. â€” "I knew it
would happen with all those long-hairs
on dope in the area," remarked a local
businessman yesterday.
Already-strained relations between
young people and long-time area
residents in this seaside community
have been pushed to the breaking point
by the senseless, brutal murder Mor 'ay
night of a prominent physician and his
family.
The victims in what Santa Cruz
County Sheriff Doug James termed,
"the most gruesome crime in the
history of Santa Cruz County" were
Dr. Victor M. Ohta, 45, his wife,
Virginia, 43, their sons, Derrick, 12,
and Taggart, 11, and the doctor's
secretary, Dorothy Cadwallader, 38.
The five were tied up, blindfolded
and led to the edge of the Ohta home
swimming pool where they were shot in
the back of the head and thrown in the
water. The Ohta's $250,000 hilltop
house was then set afire and the killers
fled after blocking the driveway with
cars to impede police and fire units.
No motive has been established by
police, although this reporter learned
yesterday that a note was left by the
killers in the doctor's maroon
Rolls-Royce. (Us contents were
released late last night, see related news
story.)
Hippies Blamed
Local residents, however, are already
accusing the local "hippie" population
which is scattered through the rugged
mountains surrounding the area.
"It's a hippie killing," remarked
Vernon Berlin, the owner of radio
station KSCO, "They had to be dope
crazed to kill the children."

Santa Cruz "hippies" deny the
charge, and claim that they have been
made the scapegoat by the police, the
town and the news media.
"Ohta wasn't a capitalist pig," said
one University of California at Santa
Cruz (UCSC) student.
The student added that Ohta gave
"$ 10,0 0 0 a year to the symphony" and
frequented student hangouts in
downtown Santa Cruz, notably The
Catalyst, a large coffee house a few
doors from the Sheriff's Department.
According to several young people,
Ohta provided some financial support
for The Catalyst, along with other
businessmen. Local newsmen deny this,
but one commented cryptically, "He
was seen there too often . .
Many local people feel that there
wouldn't have been such a "hippie
problem" if UCSC hadn't opened near
the town in 1965.
UCSC Brought Problem
"The University brought in the drug
problem and the hippies with it,"
remarked a volunteer fireman.
Since then the local residents have
had a number of problems with the
newcomers. A friend of the Ohta
family said Mrs. Ohta had told her in
August they had had some trouble with
"hippie types." She said on one
occasion Dr. Ohta chased six off his
property.
The young people, on the other
hand, complain of police harassment.
They also charge that the City of Santa
Cruz is trying to get rid of them, and
cite the city's new anti-hitchhiking
ordinance as the latest example of
official repression.
Area residents feel that not enough
has been done about the hippie influx.

They recall incidents this summer
involving a "cult" which skinned dogs
alive and left the carcasses in prominent
places.
In one instance, two skinned dogs
were reportedly left on top of a car in
front of the local California Highway
Patrol headquarters, which is near the
scene of the killings.
Town Shaken
The small town of Soquel, a few
miles east of Santa Cruz, overwhich the
Ohta home looks has been deeply
shaken by the tragedy.
Ernest Negro, Soquel Assistant Fire
Chief lives a half mile below the Ohta
residence. He was the first person to
arrive on the scene after the fire was
reported.
He immediately realized that
something was wrong when he found
the road blocked and asked that police
units be sent. Five minutes later, the
bodies of the slain victims were found
in the swimming pool. Since then,
Negro, like many other Soquel
residents, won't venture outside at
night.

The Ohta family was well-liked by
seemingly all of the residents in the
area. Mrs. Ohta and the children were
active members of the local Catholic
church.
Larry of the Soquel Texaco service
station (he did not want his last name
published) said that he didn't feel the
area was safe to live in anymore.
"We've never had such a terrible
thing happen here before," he said, "I
just can't understand it, they were good
people .. . you've got to be on dope to
do that (murder them)."
Friends recalled that Dr. Ohta was a
kind person, who often stopped to chat
with patients and friends when he met
them on the street. People in The
Catalyst reported that he got along well
with the young people there.
A fashionable dresser, he wore mod
clothing but not to extremes.
Each group in the area has its own
theory as to how the family died.
Canyon residents nearby tend to feel
that three or four people "on an LSD

trip" came down out of the hills and
slaughtered the family.
Theories
A local businessman said that he
believed that the killers came early in
the day looking for money. He cited
the fact that Mrs. Ohta did not pick up
the children at school. Instead they
were brought home by Ohta's
secretary. When Dr. Ohta arrived but
still couldn't produce any sizable
amount of money, everyone was killed.
The Sheriff's Dept. discounts the
robbery theory on the basis that
jewelry and other valuables were not
taken.
A UCSC student had a more unusual
theory. He felt that the family was
killed to get the police off the backs of
the young people.
He admitted, however, that he could
not explain why the Ohtas were
chosen.
Speculative theories aside, the police
have not ventured any possible motives.
Their investigation has centered around

the numerous small communes and
campsites that abound in the canyons
and Redwood forests of the Santa Cruz
mountains.
Sheriff James said that the "indigent
transit population" was being
questioned as his department followed
up all leads.
For the communal dwellers and
campers this has meant more
harassment, not less, as the police set
up roadblocks, and searched the forests
with dogs and mounted posses.
One San Francisco radio station,
KSAN, has been warning "long-hairs"
to avoid the Santa Cruz area entirely.
No trouble has been reported as a result
of the murders, but informed Santa
Cruz sources report that gun
registrations have soared in the past few
days.
There is no doubt that Santa Cruz
area residents are deeply divided over
the issues surrounding the life style and
culture of the people living in the hills.
' The slayings may have widened this
division into an unbreachable chasm.
