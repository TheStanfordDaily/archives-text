# Plunkett, Manning Vie For Heisman
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
For any of you who didn't travel to
Spokane Saturday, you might've
watched the TV game between Notre
Dame and Missouri. And if you
watched long enough you must have
noticed number seven for the Fightin'
Irish, one Joe Theismann.
Less than five years ago he
pronounced his name Thees-man. But
when the sports information director at
Notre Dame heard this, lie informed
Joe that the pronounciation must be
changed to Thighs-man, to rhyme with
Heisman.
If not believable, it is at least a good
story that points out the lengths people
will go to for an 18", fifty pound

bronze trophy sculpted in the image of
a Fordhamhalfback and named for one
John W. Heisman.
Heisman coached at Auburn,
Clemson, Georgia Tech, Penn, and
Washington, lefferson & Rice, but lis
major claim to fame is as inventor of
the center snap.
Every year since 1935, the $252
trophy named for him has been
awarded to the "country's outstanding
collegiate football player," as voted on
by about 1375 sportswriters and
broadcasters nationwide. The winner
receives the award at a gala banquet at
New York's Downtown Athletic Club.
According to the script, the player
should marry his high
school sweetheart, kiss his mother
goodbye, and enter the wars of
professional football as an instant
star.
But in recent years, things have
not gone as they always should
and some winners haven't fared so
well in the pros. Terry Baker,
John Huarte, Gary Beban and
Steve Spurrier were all Heisman
winners in the 60's, but none have
done much more than warm the
bench and cool their egos since.
For although the trophy is
supposed to be won on the field,
the battle is often fought between
the publicity departments of the
candidates respective schools. Yes,
that infallible institution of the
establishment, the PR man, even
controls one of the highest awards
in the virgin territories of amateur
athletics.
And so the publicity men had
armed themselves for this season's
Heisman battle long before a
single pass had been thrown.
Publicity Parade
Leading the publicity parade
for the Heisman is Archie
Manning, the University of
Mississippi's freckle-faced
Ail-American kid. Manning is a
6 '3 " 203 pound city management
major from Drew, Mississippi, and
as one pro scout says, "He's the
nicest kid you could ever meet."
Yes sir, Archie's the kind of
kid who could melt any hot
Southern belle's heart. You can
just see the Heisman trophy on his
fireplace between his rebel flag
and the girl back home's picture.
Oh, he just has to win! At least

the majority of Southerners seem
to think so.
According to some people who
attended a convention of sports
information directors earlier this
summer in Chicago, the South will
vote Manning, come hell or
desegregation. In fact Mississippi's
sports information department
went as far as to have a song
titled, "The Ballad of Archie
Who" recorded to help the cause.
The record is just a high point
in a long line of items put out for
Manning. Buttons such as "Archie
for Heisman Trophy", and
"Archie for Governor", were
produced in large numbers by
Mississippi's Athletic Department
earlier this year.
Their latest effort is a
newspaper-sized sheet pushing
Manning which was put out by a
Memphis, Tennessee public
relations firm and which has been
mailed to spor tsw r iters
nationwide at their homes, instead
of their offices.
Stanford's Candidate
Although you couldn't tell it
from all the literature, buttons
and other goodies put out for
Manning, there are some others in
the running. Among them
surprisingly enough, is Jim
Plunkett, Stanford's first bona fide
candidate in many a year.
Plunkett joins Manning,
Theismann, and probably Rex
Kern and Jack Tatum from Ohio
State as the frontrunners.
None have received the
publicity Manning has, but all are

considered to be as good or better
than him where it counts, on the
field. Still the battle at this point
should really come down to
between Plunkett and Manning.
Luckily, the South is not the
major voting block in the country
with the largest and most
influential chunk of votes coming
from people in the metropolitan
New York area. Accordingly,
national exposure such as the
recent Manning article in Sports
Illustrated or the Plunkett one in
Newsweek carries a lot of weight.
Hopefully some of the voters
might take a minute to look at
some of the statistics of the major
candidates, as well as the
opponents that their schools face.
Numbers Game
Following Saturday's
performance against Washington
State, Plunkett is now the all time
carrer total offense leader in
collegiate football with 6 630
yards. Manning is 13 th on the all
time list with 518 6 yards.
Through the first six games of
this season, Plunkett is second in
the nation in total offense and
eighth in passing. Manning is sixth
in total offense and seventh in
passing. But something which
statistics never show is the relative
strength of the teams or the
opponents they face.
Following their upset, by
Southern Mississippi, Mississippi
has dropped from fifth to 13th in
the rankings. But despite their
thrasing of Washington State,
Stanford climbed up only one
notch from ninth to eighth.

"Thus far, I believe, Jim Plunkett is the best college
quarterback I've ever seen"-BUD WIL KINS ON.

All too often the rankings seem
to be based on won-lost
percentages without taking into
consideration the relative strength
of the opponents. Although
Stanford has two patsies in San
Jose State and Washington State,
Mississippi's schedule includes
such biggies as Memphis State,
Vanderbilt, Mississippi State and
believe it or not, the University of
Tennessee at Chattanooga.
Ole Miss Loses
And Southern Mississippi
despite their 30-14 win over Ole
Miss cannot be considered too
tough after losses to Auburn
33-14 and to San Diego State,
41-14. Still even in defeat,
Manning had a good day
statistically at least, hitting on 30
of 5 6 for 341 yards and both
Mississippi touchdowns. And
Mississippi fans can always
compare this loss to our Purdue
disaster.
Enough rationalizations. The
statistics, polls, etc. are close
enough and both Plunkett and
Manning are undeniably brilliant
quarterbacks. The season is only
half over but it seems as if a lot of
people have already decided who
to vote for. I can't really see how.
Plunkett and Manning both
have some big tests ahead of
them. The Rebels have Houston
and LSU ahead of them while
Stanford must overcome UCLA
and Air Force, as well as Cal and
Washington. Hopefully some
poeple will wait and see what
happens before deciding.

Manning which was put out by a
Memphis, Tennessee public
relations firm and which has been
mailed to spor tsw r iters
nationwide at their homes, instead
of their offices.
Stanford's Candidate
Although you couldn't tell it
from all the literature, buttons
and other goodies put out for
Manning, there are some others in
the running. Among them
surprisingly enough, is Jim
Plunkett, Stanford's first bona fide
candidate in many a year.
Plunkett joins Manning,
Theismann, and probably Rex
Kern and Jack Tatum from Ohio
State as the frontrunners.
None have received the
publicity Manning has, but all are

considered to be as good or better
than him where it counts, on the
field. Still the battle at this point
should really come down to
between Plunkett and Manning.
Luckily, the South is not the
major voting block in the country
with the largest and most
influential chunk of votes coming
from people in the metropolitan
New York area. Accordingly,
national exposure such as the
recent Manning article in Sports
Illustrated or the Plunkett one in
Newsweek carries a lot of weight.
Hopefully some of the voters
might take a minute to look at
some of the statistics of the major
candidates, as well as the
opponents that their schools face.
Numbers Game
Following Saturday's
performance against Washington
State, Plunkett is now the all time
carrer total offense leader in
collegiate football with 6 630
yards. Manning is 13 th on the all
time list with 518 6 yards.
Through the first six games of
this season, Plunkett is second in
the nation in total offense and
eighth in passing. Manning is sixth
in total offense and seventh in
passing. But something which
statistics never show is the relative
strength of the teams or the
opponents they face.
Following their upset, by
Southern Mississippi, Mississippi
has dropped from fifth to 13th in
the rankings. But despite their
thrasing of Washington State,
Stanford climbed up only one
notch from ninth to eighth.

"Thus far, I believe, Jim Plunkett is the best college
quarterback I've ever seen"-BUD WIL KINS ON.

All too often the rankings seem
to be based on won-lost
percentages without taking into
consideration the relative strength
of the opponents. Although
Stanford has two patsies in San
Jose State and Washington State,
Mississippi's schedule includes
such biggies as Memphis State,
Vanderbilt, Mississippi State and
believe it or not, the University of
Tennessee at Chattanooga.
Ole Miss Loses
And Southern Mississippi
despite their 30-14 win over Ole
Miss cannot be considered too
tough after losses to Auburn
33-14 and to San Diego State,
41-14. Still even in defeat,
Manning had a good day
statistically at least, hitting on 30
of 5 6 for 341 yards and both
Mississippi touchdowns. And
Mississippi fans can always
compare this loss to our Purdue
disaster.
Enough rationalizations. The
statistics, polls, etc. are close
enough and both Plunkett and
Manning are undeniably brilliant
quarterbacks. The season is only
half over but it seems as if a lot of
people have already decided who
to vote for. I can't really see how.
Plunkett and Manning both
have some big tests ahead of
them. The Rebels have Houston
and LSU ahead of them while
Stanford must overcome UCLA
and Air Force, as well as Cal and
Washington. Hopefully some
poeple will wait and see what
happens before deciding.
For any of you who didn't travel to
Spokane Saturday, you might've
watched the TV game between Notre
Dame and Missouri. And if you
watched long enough you must have
noticed number seven for the Fightin'
Irish, one Joe Theismann.
Less than five years ago he
pronounced his name Thees-man. But
when the sports information director at
Notre Dame heard this, lie informed
Joe that the pronounciation must be
changed to Thighs-man, to rhyme with
Heisman.
If not believable, it is at least a good
story that points out the lengths people
will go to for an 18", fifty pound

bronze trophy sculpted in the image of
a Fordhamhalfback and named for one
John W. Heisman.
Heisman coached at Auburn,
Clemson, Georgia Tech, Penn, and
Washington, lefferson & Rice, but lis
major claim to fame is as inventor of
the center snap.
Every year since 1935, the $252
trophy named for him has been
awarded to the "country's outstanding
collegiate football player," as voted on
by about 1375 sportswriters and
broadcasters nationwide. The winner
receives the award at a gala banquet at
New York's Downtown Athletic Club.
According to the script, the player
should marry his high
school sweetheart, kiss his mother
goodbye, and enter the wars of
professional football as an instant
star.
But in recent years, things have
not gone as they always should
and some winners haven't fared so
well in the pros. Terry Baker,
John Huarte, Gary Beban and
Steve Spurrier were all Heisman
winners in the 60's, but none have
done much more than warm the
bench and cool their egos since.
For although the trophy is
supposed to be won on the field,
the battle is often fought between
the publicity departments of the
candidates respective schools. Yes,
that infallible institution of the
establishment, the PR man, even
controls one of the highest awards
in the virgin territories of amateur
athletics.
And so the publicity men had
armed themselves for this season's
Heisman battle long before a
single pass had been thrown.
Publicity Parade
Leading the publicity parade
for the Heisman is Archie
Manning, the University of
Mississippi's freckle-faced
Ail-American kid. Manning is a
6 '3 " 203 pound city management
major from Drew, Mississippi, and
as one pro scout says, "He's the
nicest kid you could ever meet."
Yes sir, Archie's the kind of
kid who could melt any hot
Southern belle's heart. You can
just see the Heisman trophy on his
fireplace between his rebel flag
and the girl back home's picture.
Oh, he just has to win! At least

the majority of Southerners seem
to think so.
According to some people who
attended a convention of sports
information directors earlier this
summer in Chicago, the South will
vote Manning, come hell or
desegregation. In fact Mississippi's
sports information department
went as far as to have a song
titled, "The Ballad of Archie
Who" recorded to help the cause.
The record is just a high point
in a long line of items put out for
Manning. Buttons such as "Archie
for Heisman Trophy", and
"Archie for Governor", were
produced in large numbers by
Mississippi's Athletic Department
earlier this year.
Their latest effort is a
newspaper-sized sheet pushing
Manning which was put out by a
Memphis, Tennessee public

For any of you who didn't travel to
Spokane Saturday, you might've
watched the TV game between Notre
Dame and Missouri. And if you
watched long enough you must have
noticed number seven for the Fightin'
Irish, one Joe Theismann.
Less than five years ago he
pronounced his name Thees-man. But
when the sports information director at
Notre Dame heard this, lie informed
Joe that the pronounciation must be
changed to Thighs-man, to rhyme with
Heisman.
If not believable, it is at least a good
story that points out the lengths people
will go to for an 18", fifty pound

bronze trophy sculpted in the image of
a Fordhamhalfback and named for one
John W. Heisman.
Heisman coached at Auburn,
Clemson, Georgia Tech, Penn, and
Washington, lefferson & Rice, but lis
major claim to fame is as inventor of
the center snap.
Every year since 1935, the $252
trophy named for him has been
awarded to the "country's outstanding
collegiate football player," as voted on
by about 1375 sportswriters and
broadcasters nationwide. The winner
receives the award at a gala banquet at
New York's Downtown Athletic Club.
According to the script, the player
should marry his high
school sweetheart, kiss his mother
goodbye, and enter the wars of
professional football as an instant
star.
But in recent years, things have
not gone as they always should
and some winners haven't fared so
well in the pros. Terry Baker,
John Huarte, Gary Beban and
Steve Spurrier were all Heisman
winners in the 60's, but none have
done much more than warm the
bench and cool their egos since.
For although the trophy is
supposed to be won on the field,
the battle is often fought between
the publicity departments of the
candidates respective schools. Yes,
that infallible institution of the
establishment, the PR man, even
controls one of the highest awards
in the virgin territories of amateur
athletics.
And so the publicity men had
armed themselves for this season's
Heisman battle long before a
single pass had been thrown.
Publicity Parade
Leading the publicity parade
for the Heisman is Archie
Manning, the University of
Mississippi's freckle-faced
Ail-American kid. Manning is a
6 '3 " 203 pound city management
major from Drew, Mississippi, and
as one pro scout says, "He's the
nicest kid you could ever meet."
Yes sir, Archie's the kind of
kid who could melt any hot
Southern belle's heart. You can
just see the Heisman trophy on his
fireplace between his rebel flag
and the girl back home's picture.
Oh, he just has to win! At least

the majority of Southerners seem
to think so.
According to some people who
attended a convention of sports
information directors earlier this
summer in Chicago, the South will
vote Manning, come hell or
desegregation. In fact Mississippi's
sports information department
went as far as to have a song
titled, "The Ballad of Archie
Who" recorded to help the cause.
The record is just a high point
in a long line of items put out for
Manning. Buttons such as "Archie
for Heisman Trophy", and
"Archie for Governor", were
produced in large numbers by
Mississippi's Athletic Department
earlier this year.
Their latest effort is a
newspaper-sized sheet pushing
Manning which was put out by a
Memphis, Tennessee public
relations firm and which has been
mailed to spor tsw r iters
nationwide at their homes, instead
of their offices.
Stanford's Candidate
Although you couldn't tell it
from all the literature, buttons
and other goodies put out for
Manning, there are some others in
the running. Among them
surprisingly enough, is Jim
Plunkett, Stanford's first bona fide
candidate in many a year.
Plunkett joins Manning,
Theismann, and probably Rex
Kern and Jack Tatum from Ohio
State as the frontrunners.
None have received the
publicity Manning has, but all are

considered to be as good or better
than him where it counts, on the
field. Still the battle at this point
should really come down to
between Plunkett and Manning.
Luckily, the South is not the
major voting block in the country
with the largest and most
influential chunk of votes coming
from people in the metropolitan
New York area. Accordingly,
national exposure such as the
recent Manning article in Sports
Illustrated or the Plunkett one in
Newsweek carries a lot of weight.
Hopefully some of the voters
might take a minute to look at
some of the statistics of the major
candidates, as well as the
opponents that their schools face.
Numbers Game
Following Saturday's
performance against Washington
State, Plunkett is now the all time
carrer total offense leader in
collegiate football with 6 630
yards. Manning is 13 th on the all
time list with 518 6 yards.
Through the first six games of
this season, Plunkett is second in
the nation in total offense and
eighth in passing. Manning is sixth
in total offense and seventh in
passing. But something which
statistics never show is the relative
strength of the teams or the
opponents they face.
Following their upset, by
Southern Mississippi, Mississippi
has dropped from fifth to 13th in
the rankings. But despite their
thrasing of Washington State,
Stanford climbed up only one
notch from ninth to eighth.

"Thus far, I believe, Jim Plunkett is the best college
quarterback I've ever seen"-BUD WIL KINS ON.

All too often the rankings seem
to be based on won-lost
percentages without taking into
consideration the relative strength
of the opponents. Although
Stanford has two patsies in San
Jose State and Washington State,
Mississippi's schedule includes
such biggies as Memphis State,
Vanderbilt, Mississippi State and
believe it or not, the University of
Tennessee at Chattanooga.
Ole Miss Loses
And Southern Mississippi
despite their 30-14 win over Ole
Miss cannot be considered too
tough after losses to Auburn
33-14 and to San Diego State,
41-14. Still even in defeat,
Manning had a good day
statistically at least, hitting on 30
of 5 6 for 341 yards and both
Mississippi touchdowns. And
Mississippi fans can always
compare this loss to our Purdue
disaster.
Enough rationalizations. The
statistics, polls, etc. are close
enough and both Plunkett and
Manning are undeniably brilliant
quarterbacks. The season is only
half over but it seems as if a lot of
people have already decided who
to vote for. I can't really see how.
Plunkett and Manning both
have some big tests ahead of
them. The Rebels have Houston
and LSU ahead of them while
Stanford must overcome UCLA
and Air Force, as well as Cal and
Washington. Hopefully some
poeple will wait and see what
happens before deciding.

earlier this year.
Their latest effort is a
newspaper-sized sheet pushing
Manning which was put out by a
Memphis, Tennessee public
relations firm and which has been
mailed to spor tsw r iters
nationwide at their homes, instead
of their offices.
Stanford's Candidate
Although you couldn't tell it
from all the literature, buttons
and other goodies put out for
Manning, there are some others in
the running. Among them
surprisingly enough, is Jim
Plunkett, Stanford's first bona fide
candidate in many a year.
Plunkett joins Manning,
Theismann, and probably Rex
Kern and Jack Tatum from Ohio
State as the frontrunners.
None have received the
publicity Manning has, but all are

considered to be as good or better
than him where it counts, on the
field. Still the battle at this point
should really come down to
between Plunkett and Manning.
Luckily, the South is not the
major voting block in the country
with the largest and most
influential chunk of votes coming
from people in the metropolitan
New York area. Accordingly,
national exposure such as the
recent Manning article in Sports
Illustrated or the Plunkett one in
Newsweek carries a lot of weight.
Hopefully some of the voters
might take a minute to look at
some of the statistics of the major
candidates, as well as the
opponents that their schools face.
Numbers Game
Following Saturday's
performance against Washington
State, Plunkett is now the all time
carrer total offense leader in
collegiate football with 6 630
yards. Manning is 13 th on the all
time list with 518 6 yards.
Through the first six games of
this season, Plunkett is second in
the nation in total offense and
eighth in passing. Manning is sixth
in total offense and seventh in
passing. But something which
statistics never show is the relative
strength of the teams or the
opponents they face.
Following their upset, by
Southern Mississippi, Mississippi
has dropped from fifth to 13th in
the rankings. But despite their
thrasing of Washington State,
Stanford climbed up only one
notch from ninth to eighth.

"Thus far, I believe, Jim Plunkett is the best college
quarterback I've ever seen"-BUD WIL KINS ON.

All too often the rankings seem
to be based on won-lost
percentages without taking into
consideration the relative strength
of the opponents. Although
Stanford has two patsies in San
Jose State and Washington State,
Mississippi's schedule includes
such biggies as Memphis State,
Vanderbilt, Mississippi State and
believe it or not, the University of
Tennessee at Chattanooga.
Ole Miss Loses
And Southern Mississippi
despite their 30-14 win over Ole
Miss cannot be considered too
tough after losses to Auburn
33-14 and to San Diego State,
41-14. Still even in defeat,
Manning had a good day
statistically at least, hitting on 30
of 5 6 for 341 yards and both
Mississippi touchdowns. And
Mississippi fans can always
compare this loss to our Purdue
disaster.
Enough rationalizations. The
statistics, polls, etc. are close
enough and both Plunkett and
Manning are undeniably brilliant
quarterbacks. The season is only
half over but it seems as if a lot of
people have already decided who
to vote for. I can't really see how.
Plunkett and Manning both
have some big tests ahead of
them. The Rebels have Houston
and LSU ahead of them while
Stanford must overcome UCLA
and Air Force, as well as Cal and
Washington. Hopefully some
poeple will wait and see what
happens before deciding.
For any of you who didn't travel to
Spokane Saturday, you might've
watched the TV game between Notre
Dame and Missouri. And if you
watched long enough you must have
noticed number seven for the Fightin'
Irish, one Joe Theismann.
Less than five years ago he
pronounced his name Thees-man. But
when the sports information director at
Notre Dame heard this, lie informed
Joe that the pronounciation must be
changed to Thighs-man, to rhyme with
Heisman.
If not believable, it is at least a good
story that points out the lengths people
will go to for an 18", fifty pound

bronze trophy sculpted in the image of
a Fordhamhalfback and named for one
John W. Heisman.
Heisman coached at Auburn,
Clemson, Georgia Tech, Penn, and
Washington, lefferson & Rice, but lis
major claim to fame is as inventor of
the center snap.
Every year since 1935, the $252
trophy named for him has been
awarded to the "country's outstanding
collegiate football player," as voted on
by about 1375 sportswriters and
broadcasters nationwide. The winner
receives the award at a gala banquet at
New York's Downtown Athletic Club.
According to the script, the player
should marry his high
school sweetheart, kiss his mother
goodbye, and enter the wars of
professional football as an instant
star.
But in recent years, things have
not gone as they always should
and some winners haven't fared so
well in the pros. Terry Baker,
John Huarte, Gary Beban and
Steve Spurrier were all Heisman
winners in the 60's, but none have
done much more than warm the
bench and cool their egos since.
For although the trophy is
supposed to be won on the field,
the battle is often fought between
the publicity departments of the
candidates respective schools. Yes,
that infallible institution of the
establishment, the PR man, even
controls one of the highest awards
in the virgin territories of amateur
athletics.
And so the publicity men had
armed themselves for this season's
Heisman battle long before a
single pass had been thrown.
Publicity Parade
Leading the publicity parade
for the Heisman is Archie
Manning, the University of
Mississippi's freckle-faced
Ail-American kid. Manning is a
6 '3 " 203 pound city management
major from Drew, Mississippi, and
as one pro scout says, "He's the
nicest kid you could ever meet."
Yes sir, Archie's the kind of
kid who could melt any hot
Southern belle's heart. You can
just see the Heisman trophy on his
fireplace between his rebel flag
and the girl back home's picture.
Oh, he just has to win! At least

the majority of Southerners seem
to think so.
According to some people who
attended a convention of sports
information directors earlier this
summer in Chicago, the South will
vote Manning, come hell or
desegregation. In fact Mississippi's
sports information department
went as far as to have a song
titled, "The Ballad of Archie
Who" recorded to help the cause.
The record is just a high point
in a long line of items put out for
Manning. Buttons such as "Archie
for Heisman Trophy", and
"Archie for Governor", were
produced in large numbers by
Mississippi's Athletic Department
earlier this year.
Their latest effort is a
newspaper-sized sheet pushing
Manning which was put out by a
Memphis, Tennessee public
relations firm and which has been
mailed to spor tsw r iters
