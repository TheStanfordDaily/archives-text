# Tarot Card Clue
## Murder Note Found At Scene 
### 
SANTA CRUZ (AP) — A note signed
with the names of the four knights on
fortune-telling tarot cards and declaring
war against enemies of "natural life on
this planet" was found at the hilltop
home where five persons were slain
execution-style, officers said
Wednesday.
Santa Cruz County Under-sheriff
Paul W. Tara said the typewritten note
was found under the windshield wiper
of the Rolls Royce belonging to Dr.
Victor M. Ohta, slain Monday night
with his wife, two sons and secretary.
The note said:
"Today World War 111 will begin as
brought to you by the People of the
Free Universe. From this day forward
anyone and/or company who misuses
the natural environment or destroys
same will suffer the penalty of death by
the People of the Free Universe.
"I and my comrades from this day
forth will fight until death or freedom,
against anything or anyone who does
not support natural life on this planet,
materialism must die or mankind will."
The note was signed: "Knight of
Wands, "Knight of Cups, Knight of
Pentacles, Knight of Swords."
Tarot Cards
The knights are the four suits of
tarot cards, used to tell one's fortune
depending on which direction the large
cards fall.
The pentacle is a divice associated
with witchcraft, in fiction often used to
summon up the devil or his servants
from the nether regions.

Tara said "the note itself is in the
hands of some of the most competent
analysts in the state."
He said there were no other notes,
and that the reason the existence of the
note was withheld until now was to
keep people from becoming alarmed.
Following the account of the note's
contents, he said:
"We recognize the shock this
senseless act has brought to our
citizenry. We trust that the sober
judgment of our residents will prevail
over any emotional reaction.
"The successful conclusion of this
tragic crime will be based on the
combined efforts of a rational, logical
citizenry, responses to the tedious
processes required of competent law
enforcement personnel."
Search Spreads
Meanwhile, the search for the killers
spread to youth communes in the hills
north of Santa Cruz.
Authorities were looking for three
young persons—two men and a
woman—seen near the killers' car
parked alongside a mountain road
Tuesday. The car was found seven miles
from the burned mansion.
The car, registered in Mrs. Ohta's
name, was spotted on a mountain road
with an orange knapsack in the back
seat a few minutes before it was
abandoned in a railroad tunnel and
rammed by a switch engine. An
attempt had been made to burn the car,
officers said.

The road and the railroad tracks are
both on the side of a redwood canyon
that is a popular camping spot for
young transients. Small communes
abound there and in the nearby
redwood forests of the Santa Cruz
Mountains.
No Motive
A friend of the Ohta family said
Mrs. Ohta had told her in August they
had had some trouble with "hippie
types." She said on one occasion Dr.
Ohta chased six off his porch.
Investigators said they still had no
motive for the killings and that the
area's "indigent transient population"
was being questioned. They added that
was not the only area of investigation.

The communes are scattered in the
forest north of Santa Cruz through the
famous Big Basin redwood park, about
60 miles south of San Francisco.
Speculation that the killers may
have left a note was raised at a news
conference Wednesday by replies to
questions by Sheriff Douglas James.
Asked if a note was found in blood,
he gave a firm "No," but he dismissed a
question about any other type of note
with a "no comment."
Slain with Ohta, 45, were his wife,
Virginia, 43; sons Derrick, 12 and
Taggart, 11, and secretary Dorothy
Cadwallader, 38.
Officers set up special patrols on
roads surrounding the canyon after the
car was found.

Slain with Ohta, 45, were his wife,
Virginia, 43; sons Derrick, 12 and

Cadwallader, 38.

roads surrounding the canyon after the
car was found.
SANTA CRUZ (AP) — A note signed
with the names of the four knights on
fortune-telling tarot cards and declaring
war against enemies of "natural life on
this planet" was found at the hilltop
home where five persons were slain
execution-style, officers said
Wednesday.
Santa Cruz County Under-sheriff
Paul W. Tara said the typewritten note
was found under the windshield wiper
of the Rolls Royce belonging to Dr.
Victor M. Ohta, slain Monday night
with his wife, two sons and secretary.
The note said:
"Today World War 111 will begin as
brought to you by the People of the
Free Universe. From this day forward
anyone and/or company who misuses
the natural environment or destroys
same will suffer the penalty of death by
the People of the Free Universe.
"I and my comrades from this day
forth will fight until death or freedom,
against anything or anyone who does
not support natural life on this planet,
materialism must die or mankind will."
The note was signed: "Knight of
Wands, "Knight of Cups, Knight of
Pentacles, Knight of Swords."
Tarot Cards
The knights are the four suits of
tarot cards, used to tell one's fortune
depending on which direction the large
cards fall.
The pentacle is a divice associated
with witchcraft, in fiction often used to
summon up the devil or his servants
from the nether regions.

Tara said "the note itself is in the
hands of some of the most competent
analysts in the state."
He said there were no other notes,
and that the reason the existence of the
note was withheld until now was to
keep people from becoming alarmed.
Following the account of the note's
contents, he said:
"We recognize the shock this
senseless act has brought to our
citizenry. We trust that the sober
judgment of our residents will prevail
over any emotional reaction.
"The successful conclusion of this
tragic crime will be based on the
combined efforts of a rational, logical
citizenry, responses to the tedious
processes required of competent law
enforcement personnel."
Search Spreads
Meanwhile, the search for the killers
spread to youth communes in the hills
north of Santa Cruz.
Authorities were looking for three
young persons—two men and a
woman—seen near the killers' car
parked alongside a mountain road
Tuesday. The car was found seven miles
from the burned mansion.
The car, registered in Mrs. Ohta's
name, was spotted on a mountain road
with an orange knapsack in the back
seat a few minutes before it was
abandoned in a railroad tunnel and
rammed by a switch engine. An
attempt had been made to burn the car,
officers said.

The road and the railroad tracks are
both on the side of a redwood canyon
that is a popular camping spot for
young transients. Small communes
abound there and in the nearby
redwood forests of the Santa Cruz
Mountains.
No Motive
A friend of the Ohta family said
Mrs. Ohta had told her in August they
had had some trouble with "hippie
types." She said on one occasion Dr.
Ohta chased six off his porch.
Investigators said they still had no
motive for the killings and that the
area's "indigent transient population"
was being questioned. They added that
was not the only area of investigation.

The communes are scattered in the
forest north of Santa Cruz through the
famous Big Basin redwood park, about
60 miles south of San Francisco.
Speculation that the killers may
have left a note was raised at a news
conference Wednesday by replies to
questions by Sheriff Douglas James.
Asked if a note was found in blood,
he gave a firm "No," but he dismissed a
question about any other type of note
with a "no comment."
