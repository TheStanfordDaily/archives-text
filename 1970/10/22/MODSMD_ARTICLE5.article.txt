# Weekend Guide To Bruin Smogsville
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Quite a tribe of Indians and
other team supporters should be
driving, riding, hitching, or flying
to that megalopolis that about
eight million people call
home—Los Angeles this weekend
to watch our red shirts carve
another notch in that arrow aimed
at the Rose Bowl. Since this may
be the first trip to that wonderful
smog reserve for many, it might
be helpful to point out just a few

things there are to do in L.A.that
might make the weekend more
interesting.
Aside from a gas mask and
health insurance there is little in
the way of special supplies you'll
need for your trip. It might be
wise to take a heavy coat for
Saturday night's game since the
Coliseum can get very nippy once
the sun burns its way through the
blanket of smog and over the
horizon.
L.A. Art Museum
If you arrive Friday afternoon
or parly Friday evening, the L.A.
County art museum will prove
very worthwhile. It is open until
nine and since its opening a few
years back has been filled with a
rather impressive mixed
collection—both in time period
and media. The fountains at the
museum make the trip at night
doubly entertaining.
After the museum, The Street,
which is sort of a mini-Ghiradelli
which contains only local craft
shops should prove of interest. It
is located at 662 N. LaPeer Drive.

+ block south of Santa Monica
Blvd. in Los Angeles. The top
floor of The Street contains the
discotheque The Factory, often a
favorite watering place for the
stars. Davey Jones, formerly of
the Monkees created the street as
a place where local craftsmen
would be able to show their wares
in a non-commercial atmosphere.
Cafe Figaro
Walking distance from The
Street at 9010 Melrose Blvd. is the
Cafe Figaro. Starting at about
11:00 p.m. this coffee house
collects more hip people than
anywhere in Los Angeles and is
often a favorite of many
entertainers. Although there is no
formal entertainment, watching
the people is usually a trip in
itself. On one night I had Bill
Cosby and two members of the
Fifth Dimension sitting at the
next table.
Saturday should provide an
opportunity to satisfy all of your
tourist urges. I don't recommend
making the trip to Disneyland for
two reasons unless you are really

intent on making the trip. First of
all you will probably be too
exhausted to enjoy the game since
Disneyland is an all day affair and
about 4 0 miles out of LA.
Secondly, Disneyland instituted
some policies against long hairs
this summer. I'm not sure if they
are still in effect but I'd avoid the
place on principle.
Universal Tour Studio
If you've never been in a movie
studio, Universal Studios in North
Hollywood has an excellent tour.
Though a rather commercial
operation, they do give excellent
insight into how films are made,
and most of the tourists I know
who have taken the tour have
really dug it. It takes about four
hours.
For something less touristy
you might try Griffith Park which
overlooks Los Angeles. There is a
zoo, observatory, stables, picnic
grounds, hiking trails, bicycle
rentals, a carousel, and plenty of
greenery. Take a picnic lunch and
spend the day there.
If you decide to take a ride out
to the beach via Sunset (a main
drag of TV fame) stop at Will
Rogers Park on your way. This is
the ranch and home of Will
Rogers and often on Saturday
afternoons you can watch polo
played on the grounds. Best of all
it's free and a great place to fly a
kite.

After the Indian victory over
the Bruins, it could be interesting
to drive through Westwood
Village and gloat. The climate of
the village has changed in recent
years from that of a rather
straight college town to a
community approaching the
ambience of Telegraph Avenue.
Vendors stroll the streets with
pushcarts selling pretzels and
candy, minstrels stop in front of
the lines waiting for theatres and
give concerts, and lots of people
just walk around. As far as a place
to go, the village has taken over
much of the function of the
Sunset Strip of years past.
There will probably be a few
hearty souls who will be able to
get up Sunday morning. The most
notable stop for breakfast or
brunch would be Nate 4 n Al's
Delicatessin on Beverly Drive in
Beverly Hills. The line of Rolls
Royces and Cadillacs outside
point to the fact that it is the
nesting place for many of the
"power elite" who make their
home there.
As you make your way north
once again out of the smog and
traffic and into the quieter
reaches of the ivory tower, you
may think to yourself that you'd
have to be a little crazy to put up
with all of that smog and all of
those people. You don't have to
be, but it helps.
