Danilo Dolci, internationally
known social reformer and Italian
pacifist, will speak tonight at 7 :30
p.m. in TMU Large Lounge. Dolci
came to Sicily in 1952 after
leaving a career as an architect and
since that time has been waging a
day-by-day militant crusade
against disease, unemployment,
poverty, illiteracy and violence in
western Sicily.

To help overcome human and
material waste, Dolci and his
co-workers at his Center for Study
and Action have engaged in
hunger strikes, sit-ins, protest
marches, clandestine radio
broadcasts, and an internationally
famous "strike-in-reverse."
Dolci is currently
concentrating on pressuring the
Italian government to rehabilitate
the forgotten peoples and villages
victimized by the 1967 Sicilian
earthquake.
His other achievements include
the construction of Jato Dam to
aid 18 impoverished villages in
western Sicily, the acceleration of
the fight against the Mafia, the
introduction of twentieth century
farming techniques which have
greatly increased land
productivity, and the elimination
of some of western Sicily's worst
slum areas.
