# Redwood City Clinic Treats Area Poor
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
"It would hurt our image if we became known
as a hippie clinic," said Summers Got I as she
explained why People's Medical Center (PMC) had
decided it could treat only poor residents living
near the new clinic in Redwood City.
Begun last spring by several Stanford doctors,
students and former students, PMC's original idea
was to serve all of the Movement people who were
unhappy with the "mechanical care' given by
local institutions or unable to pay the high cost ol
such care. This concept was changed when the
Center decided to locate in a racially mixed
poverty area of 1 5,000 people in Redwood City.
"It was a hard decision to make," explained
Miss Goff, "But we feel we have more than enough
people who can't afford any medical care at all in
this area."
The Center is located in an old two-story
building that once was a store. It has been
remodeled so that the first floor now has two
examining rooms, a waiting room, business office,
laboratory, X-ray treatment room and a large
child-care area.
With the downstairs almost completed, the
Center will officially open Monday, although some
patients have already been treated. Eventually, the
second floor will contain a pharmacy, more
treatment rooms and some staff facilities.
Full Time Staff
The Center has two doctors, a nurse, a secretary
and a lab technician on full-time salaries. They
each receive $22 0 a month. PMC hopes to raise

this to $500 when, and if, the money becomes
available.
PMC's two doctors are Dr. Norton Kalishman
and Dr. Michael Jacobs, both of whom took their
residency at Stanford Hospital.
Jacobs is an internist, while Kalishman is a
pediatrician. Other doctors are available for
consultation and referrals, but the Center is
looking for a full-time dentist.
PMC offers low cost medical treatment
including lab testing, X-ray treatments and minor
surgery on the premises. The pharmacy will offer
discount drug prescriptions to PMC patients. In
addition, the children of patients and staff are
entertained in the child care center.
Follow Up
Staff members stressed that PMC will follow
through on its clinical work by sending trained
volunteers into the community to determine the
causes of family health problems.
So far, 15 Community Service Volunteers have
been trained to do this follow up work. All speak
or are learning Spanish, and five more volunteers
will be trained soon.
When further testing or consultations are
necessary, PMC will offer free transportation to
other institutions which are inaccessable without a
car.
A large number of volunteers, many of them
white Stanford students, worked to build the
Center. To date there has been very little
indication from the community as to how they
view the new facility. No one is discouraged,
however, and staffers expect that it will take a few

months to gain the confidence of the area
residents.
Bi-Lingual Publication
PMC was encouraged to locate in Redwood
City by Venceremos College, an accredited
two-year institution started by the Chicano
community. The College helped the clinic organize
its services to fulfill the needs of the local area and
structure itself so that it would be controlled by
the community it serves.
"We haven't shown anything to the community
yet," said Don Friedman, a conscientious objector
from Palo Alto. He thought that community
support would come quite quickly, however, once
the Center was in full operation.
PMC is publishing Solution, a tabloid
newspaper, once a month in both Spanish and
English. The newspaper carries health and first-aid
tips along with quotations from Che Guevara and
articles supporting Los Siete de la Raza, currently
on trial in San Francisco.
The staff feels that good health conditions in
the community are tied to social, political and
economic issues. Solution attempts to focus on
this relationship and at the same time try to
involve the community in the clinic and other
projects.
Several staff members stated that they didn't
expect to be working at the clinic very long. They
said that as quickly as possible members of the
immediate area should take over and make PMC a
true part of the local community.
