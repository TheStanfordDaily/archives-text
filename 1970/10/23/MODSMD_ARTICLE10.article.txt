## Bike Hang-up: 'Epidemic Of Trauma' 
###

Motorcycle accidents — a
leading cause of death among
college students—may have a
psychological basis, and indeed
give evidence of a recognizable
clinical disorder, according to a
Medical School psychiatrist.
"Over the past few years I have
observed a group of patients
manifesting unusual emotional
investment in the motorcycle and
sharing a number of general
characteristics... that I have
designated the 'motorcycle
syndrome'," explained Dr.
Armand M. Nicholi in a report to
the American Psychiatric
Association last spring.
"Most people don't realize how
much a part of the Now
Generation motorcycles are,"
Nicholi said last week. "The
problem is widespread
internationally."
Nicholi emphasized that not all
motorcyclists— including those
who have accidents—suffer from
the syndrome.
Five million motorcycles,
Nicholi said, will be in use this
year, as compared with fewer than
half a million in 1956. "Injuries
and fatalities have escalated to
what physicians now refer to as
'an epidemic of trauma'— this year
5 000 people will be killed and
close to a million injured in such
accidents."

The motorcycle, driven by
only ten percent of the number of
students who drive automobiles,
accounts for 100 percent more
injuries, Nicholi said.
Tragic Toll'
"This tragic toll of injury and
death will continue as long as
research focuses on the vehicle
only and neglects the driver," he
said. "Physicians have thus far
paid little attention to what is
undoubtedly the most significant
causal factor of all—the
psychological."
Based on an in-depth study of
nine motorcyclists, all college
students, "most of whom were
seen in intensive psychotherapy
from one to three years," Nicholi
has put together an outline of the
motorcycle syndrome.
Of the subjects studied, he
said, "One or more serious
motorcycle accidents was
common among them. The
motorcycle obtruded into their
daily activities, their repetitive
dreams, and their conscious and
unconscious fantasies."
The Syndrome
Characteristics of the
motorcycle syndrome include:
Unusual preoccupation with
the motorcycle. "When the
patient is not actually riding a
motorcycle, he tends to daydream
continuously of doing so. The
mere sound of a distant

motorcycle stimulates vivid
fantasies."
A history of accident-prone
ness extending to early childhood.
Persistent fear of bodily injury.
"Conscious and unconscious fears
of mutilation and death haunt
these patients. They openly
discuss fear of castration. As with
most fantasies, this one has some
basis in reality: the loss of testicle
in a cycle accident is not
unknown."
A distant, conflict-ridden
relationship with the father and a
strong identification with the
mother. "Each patient within my
sample feared his father and as a
young boy learned to avoid him."
Extreme passivity and inability
to compete. "Although endowed
with obvious potential, these
patients, because of an inability to
risk failure, refuse to compete
academically, athletically, or
socially. They study only under
pressure of exams, participate
only in noncompetitive athletics,
and form relationships only with
those taking the initiative . ..
"When they do engage in
political activity, they adhere to
the more radical, extreme,
irrational, and defiant part of the
group . . . more commonly,
however, anger is directed inward,
causing apathy, withdrawal, and
depression . . .
Insomnia, Blindness, Masturbation
"Insomnia, sometimes

accompanied by fantasies of going
blind, disturbs the late hours. The
resultant anxiety may lead to
masturbation, or a sudden
motorcycle ride through the
night. .. They go to bed at dawn,
wake about three in the
afternoon, and then begin a
routine of aimless wandering.
Sleep, drugs, television, and
alcohol provide escape from a
monotonous, painful reality."
A defective self-image. "They
reveal deep-seated, often
unconscious, feelings of being
ugly, unintelligent, fat,weak,
feminine, and defective and
frequently express a sense of
having 'something missing.' "
Poor impulse control.
Fear of and counterphobic
involvement with aggressive girls.
"These patients characteristically
depend on and fear tall,
broad-shouldered, sexually
aggressive girls, girls who initiate
relationships by expressing
admiration for the motorcycle or
by asking to ride it."
Impotence and intense
homosexual concerns. "The
sexual history ranges from a few
traumatic unsucessful experiences
for some to promiscuous activity
for others. When sexual activity is
mechanically successful the
promiscuous subjects describe the
experience as physically and
emotionally ungratifying. They
often attempt to alleviate anxiety
resulting from failure to perform
sexually by riding the
mo torcycle."
Masculine Self
Nicholi points out that certain
aspects of the motorcycle's

appeal—the thrusting of the rider's
body into space, the intrusion of
the deafening noise into other
people's ears, the practice of
keeping motorcycles in girl
friends' garages—suggest genital or
phallice elements, but says,
"Clinical evidence proves such
approaches to be limited in scope
and far too superficial...Clinical
material does make it clear,
however, that the motorcycle
serves as an extension of what the
patient considers his masculine
self."
The machine both pleases and
terrifies, Nicholi said. "While fully
conscious that the motorcycle
provides pleasures of full
expression of masculinity, even to
the physical sense of orgasm, the
patient also acutely senses its
potential danger."
Both pleasures and the two
basic fears—fear of bodily injury
and of loss of control—are
described 'in remarkably similar
terms," he said.
The problem, he added, is not
peculiar to this country—since the
publication of his report last May
he has received several hundred
requests for reprints, many of
them from Europe.
"The syndrome does not, of
course, affect everyone who
enjoys riding a motorcycle," he
said. And"the sense of rejection,
pervasive anger, and brooding
resentment" that go with this
syndrome "characterize not only
the patients described but a large
proportion of young people
today."

however, that the motorcycle
serves as an extension of what the
patient considers his masculine
self."
The machine both pleases and
terrifies, Nicholi said. "While fully
conscious that the motorcycle
provides pleasures of full
expression of masculinity, even to
the physical sense of orgasm, the
patient also acutely senses its
potential danger."
Both pleasures and the two
basic fears—fear of bodily injury
and of loss of control—are
described 'in remarkably similar
terms," he said.
The problem, he added, is not
peculiar to this country—since the
publication of his report last May
he has received several hundred
requests for reprints, many of
them from Europe.
"The syndrome does not, of
course, affect everyone who
enjoys riding a motorcycle," he
said. And"the sense of rejection,
pervasive anger, and brooding
resentment" that go with this
syndrome "characterize not only
the patients described but a large
proportion of young people
today."

Motorcycle accidents — a
leading cause of death among
college students—may have a
psychological basis, and indeed
give evidence of a recognizable
clinical disorder, according to a
Medical School psychiatrist.
"Over the past few years I have
observed a group of patients
manifesting unusual emotional
investment in the motorcycle and
sharing a number of general
characteristics... that I have
designated the 'motorcycle
syndrome'," explained Dr.
Armand M. Nicholi in a report to
the American Psychiatric
Association last spring.
"Most people don't realize how
much a part of the Now
Generation motorcycles are,"
Nicholi said last week. "The
problem is widespread
internationally."
Nicholi emphasized that not all
motorcyclists— including those
who have accidents—suffer from
the syndrome.
Five million motorcycles,
Nicholi said, will be in use this
year, as compared with fewer than
half a million in 1956. "Injuries
and fatalities have escalated to
what physicians now refer to as
'an epidemic of trauma'— this year
5 000 people will be killed and
close to a million injured in such
accidents."

The motorcycle, driven by
only ten percent of the number of
students who drive automobiles,
accounts for 100 percent more
injuries, Nicholi said.
Tragic Toll'
"This tragic toll of injury and
death will continue as long as
research focuses on the vehicle
only and neglects the driver," he
said. "Physicians have thus far
paid little attention to what is
undoubtedly the most significant
causal factor of all—the
psychological."
Based on an in-depth study of
nine motorcyclists, all college
students, "most of whom were
seen in intensive psychotherapy
from one to three years," Nicholi
has put together an outline of the
motorcycle syndrome.
Of the subjects studied, he
said, "One or more serious
motorcycle accidents was
common among them. The
motorcycle obtruded into their
daily activities, their repetitive
dreams, and their conscious and
unconscious fantasies."
The Syndrome
Characteristics of the
motorcycle syndrome include:
Unusual preoccupation with
the motorcycle. "When the
patient is not actually riding a
motorcycle, he tends to daydream
continuously of doing so. The
mere sound of a distant

motorcycle stimulates vivid
fantasies."
A history of accident-prone
ness extending to early childhood.
Persistent fear of bodily injury.
"Conscious and unconscious fears
of mutilation and death haunt
these patients. They openly
discuss fear of castration. As with
most fantasies, this one has some
basis in reality: the loss of testicle
in a cycle accident is not
unknown."
A distant, conflict-ridden
relationship with the father and a
strong identification with the
mother. "Each patient within my
sample feared his father and as a
young boy learned to avoid him."
Extreme passivity and inability
to compete. "Although endowed
with obvious potential, these
patients, because of an inability to
risk failure, refuse to compete
academically, athletically, or
socially. They study only under
pressure of exams, participate
only in noncompetitive athletics,
and form relationships only with
those taking the initiative . ..
"When they do engage in
political activity, they adhere to
the more radical, extreme,
irrational, and defiant part of the
group . . . more commonly,
however, anger is directed inward,
causing apathy, withdrawal, and
depression . . .
Insomnia, Blindness, Masturbation
"Insomnia, sometimes

accompanied by fantasies of going
blind, disturbs the late hours. The
resultant anxiety may lead to
masturbation, or a sudden
motorcycle ride through the
night. .. They go to bed at dawn,
wake about three in the
afternoon, and then begin a
routine of aimless wandering.
Sleep, drugs, television, and
alcohol provide escape from a
monotonous, painful reality."
A defective self-image. "They
reveal deep-seated, often
unconscious, feelings of being
ugly, unintelligent, fat,weak,
feminine, and defective and
frequently express a sense of
having 'something missing.' "
Poor impulse control.
Fear of and counterphobic
involvement with aggressive girls.
"These patients characteristically
depend on and fear tall,
broad-shouldered, sexually
aggressive girls, girls who initiate
relationships by expressing
admiration for the motorcycle or
by asking to ride it."
Impotence and intense
homosexual concerns. "The
sexual history ranges from a few
traumatic unsucessful experiences
for some to promiscuous activity
for others. When sexual activity is
mechanically successful the
promiscuous subjects describe the
experience as physically and
emotionally ungratifying. They
often attempt to alleviate anxiety
resulting from failure to perform
sexually by riding the
mo torcycle."
Masculine Self
Nicholi points out that certain
aspects of the motorcycle's

appeal—the thrusting of the rider's
body into space, the intrusion of
the deafening noise into other
people's ears, the practice of
keeping motorcycles in girl
friends' garages—suggest genital or
phallice elements, but says,
"Clinical evidence proves such
approaches to be limited in scope
and far too superficial...Clinical
material does make it clear,
however, that the motorcycle
serves as an extension of what the
patient considers his masculine
self."
The machine both pleases and
terrifies, Nicholi said. "While fully

Poor impulse control.
Fear of and counterphobic
involvement with aggressive girls.
"These patients characteristically
depend on and fear tall,
broad-shouldered, sexually
aggressive girls, girls who initiate
relationships by expressing
admiration for the motorcycle or
by asking to ride it."
Impotence and intense
homosexual concerns. "The
sexual history ranges from a few
traumatic unsucessful experiences
for some to promiscuous activity
for others. When sexual activity is
mechanically successful the
promiscuous subjects describe the
experience as physically and
emotionally ungratifying. They
often attempt to alleviate anxiety
resulting from failure to perform
sexually by riding the

Masculine Self
Nicholi points out that certain
aspects of the motorcycle's

appeal—the thrusting of the rider's
body into space, the intrusion of
the deafening noise into other
people's ears, the practice of
keeping motorcycles in girl
friends' garages—suggest genital or
phallice elements, but says,
"Clinical evidence proves such
approaches to be limited in scope
and far too superficial...Clinical
material does make it clear,
however, that the motorcycle
serves as an extension of what the
patient considers his masculine
self."
The machine both pleases and
terrifies, Nicholi said. "While fully
conscious that the motorcycle
provides pleasures of full
expression of masculinity, even to
the physical sense of orgasm, the
patient also acutely senses its
potential danger."
Both pleasures and the two
basic fears—fear of bodily injury
and of loss of control—are
described 'in remarkably similar
terms," he said.
The problem, he added, is not
peculiar to this country—since the
publication of his report last May
he has received several hundred
requests for reprints, many of
them from Europe.
"The syndrome does not, of
course, affect everyone who
enjoys riding a motorcycle," he
said. And"the sense of rejection,
pervasive anger, and brooding
resentment" that go with this
syndrome "characterize not only
the patients described but a large
proportion of young people
today."

Harvard Crimson.)
Motorcycle accidents — a
leading cause of death among
college students—may have a
psychological basis, and indeed
give evidence of a recognizable
clinical disorder, according to a
Medical School psychiatrist.
"Over the past few years I have
observed a group of patients
manifesting unusual emotional
investment in the motorcycle and
sharing a number of general
characteristics... that I have
designated the 'motorcycle
syndrome'," explained Dr.
Armand M. Nicholi in a report to
the American Psychiatric
Association last spring.
"Most people don't realize how
much a part of the Now
Generation motorcycles are,"
Nicholi said last week. "The
problem is widespread
internationally."
Nicholi emphasized that not all
motorcyclists— including those
who have accidents—suffer from
the syndrome.
Five million motorcycles,
Nicholi said, will be in use this
year, as compared with fewer than
half a million in 1956. "Injuries
and fatalities have escalated to
what physicians now refer to as
'an epidemic of trauma'— this year
5 000 people will be killed and
close to a million injured in such
accidents."

The motorcycle, driven by
only ten percent of the number of
students who drive automobiles,
accounts for 100 percent more
injuries, Nicholi said.
Tragic Toll'
"This tragic toll of injury and
death will continue as long as
research focuses on the vehicle
only and neglects the driver," he
said. "Physicians have thus far
paid little attention to what is
undoubtedly the most significant
causal factor of all—the
psychological."
Based on an in-depth study of
nine motorcyclists, all college
students, "most of whom were
seen in intensive psychotherapy
from one to three years," Nicholi
has put together an outline of the
motorcycle syndrome.
Of the subjects studied, he
said, "One or more serious
motorcycle accidents was
common among them. The
motorcycle obtruded into their
daily activities, their repetitive
dreams, and their conscious and
unconscious fantasies."
The Syndrome
Characteristics of the
motorcycle syndrome include:
Unusual preoccupation with
the motorcycle. "When the
patient is not actually riding a
motorcycle, he tends to daydream
continuously of doing so. The
mere sound of a distant

motorcycle stimulates vivid
fantasies."
A history of accident-prone
ness extending to early childhood.
Persistent fear of bodily injury.
"Conscious and unconscious fears
of mutilation and death haunt
these patients. They openly
discuss fear of castration. As with
most fantasies, this one has some
basis in reality: the loss of testicle
in a cycle accident is not
unknown."
A distant, conflict-ridden
relationship with the father and a
strong identification with the
mother. "Each patient within my
sample feared his father and as a
young boy learned to avoid him."
Extreme passivity and inability
to compete. "Although endowed
with obvious potential, these
patients, because of an inability to
risk failure, refuse to compete
academically, athletically, or
socially. They study only under
pressure of exams, participate
only in noncompetitive athletics,
and form relationships only with
those taking the initiative . ..
"When they do engage in
political activity, they adhere to
the more radical, extreme,
irrational, and defiant part of the
group . . . more commonly,
however, anger is directed inward,
causing apathy, withdrawal, and
depression . . .
Insomnia, Blindness, Masturbation
"Insomnia, sometimes

accompanied by fantasies of going
blind, disturbs the late hours. The
resultant anxiety may lead to
masturbation, or a sudden
motorcycle ride through the
night. .. They go to bed at dawn,
wake about three in the
afternoon, and then begin a
routine of aimless wandering.
Sleep, drugs, television, and
alcohol provide escape from a
monotonous, painful reality."
A defective self-image. "They
reveal deep-seated, often
unconscious, feelings of being
ugly, unintelligent, fat,weak,
feminine, and defective and
frequently express a sense of
having 'something missing.' "
Poor impulse control.
Fear of and counterphobic

mother. "Each patient within my
sample feared his father and as a
young boy learned to avoid him."
Extreme passivity and inability
to compete. "Although endowed
with obvious potential, these
patients, because of an inability to
risk failure, refuse to compete
academically, athletically, or
socially. They study only under
pressure of exams, participate
only in noncompetitive athletics,
and form relationships only with
those taking the initiative . ..
"When they do engage in
political activity, they adhere to
the more radical, extreme,
irrational, and defiant part of the
group . . . more commonly,
however, anger is directed inward,
causing apathy, withdrawal, and
depression . . .
Insomnia, Blindness, Masturbation
"Insomnia, sometimes

accompanied by fantasies of going
blind, disturbs the late hours. The
resultant anxiety may lead to
masturbation, or a sudden
motorcycle ride through the
night. .. They go to bed at dawn,
wake about three in the
afternoon, and then begin a
routine of aimless wandering.
Sleep, drugs, television, and
alcohol provide escape from a
monotonous, painful reality."
A defective self-image. "They
reveal deep-seated, often
unconscious, feelings of being
ugly, unintelligent, fat,weak,
feminine, and defective and
frequently express a sense of
having 'something missing.' "
Poor impulse control.
Fear of and counterphobic
involvement with aggressive girls.
"These patients characteristically
depend on and fear tall,
broad-shouldered, sexually
aggressive girls, girls who initiate
relationships by expressing
admiration for the motorcycle or
by asking to ride it."
Impotence and intense
homosexual concerns. "The
sexual history ranges from a few
traumatic unsucessful experiences
for some to promiscuous activity
for others. When sexual activity is
mechanically successful the
promiscuous subjects describe the
experience as physically and
emotionally ungratifying. They
often attempt to alleviate anxiety
resulting from failure to perform
sexually by riding the
mo torcycle."
Masculine Self
Nicholi points out that certain
aspects of the motorcycle's

appeal—the thrusting of the rider's
body into space, the intrusion of
the deafening noise into other
people's ears, the practice of
keeping motorcycles in girl
friends' garages—suggest genital or
phallice elements, but says,
"Clinical evidence proves such
approaches to be limited in scope
and far too superficial...Clinical
material does make it clear,
however, that the motorcycle
serves as an extension of what the
patient considers his masculine
self."
The machine both pleases and
terrifies, Nicholi said. "While fully
conscious that the motorcycle
provides pleasures of full
expression of masculinity, even to
the physical sense of orgasm, the
patient also acutely senses its
potential danger."
Both pleasures and the two
basic fears—fear of bodily injury
and of loss of control—are
described 'in remarkably similar
terms," he said.
The problem, he added, is not
peculiar to this country—since the
publication of his report last May
he has received several hundred
requests for reprints, many of
them from Europe.
"The syndrome does not, of
course, affect everyone who
enjoys riding a motorcycle," he
said. And"the sense of rejection,
pervasive anger, and brooding
resentment" that go with this
syndrome "characterize not only
the patients described but a large
proportion of young people
today."
