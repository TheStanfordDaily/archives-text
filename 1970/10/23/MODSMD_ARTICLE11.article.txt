# A 						Request

We of the Daily opinion page staff would like to take
advantage of this hole on the page to make a small request.
Each day we receive several columns and letters to the
editors. Invariably a large number of these are hastily scribbled
on scraps of paper or the backs of gum wrappers, or are typed
single spaced running from one edge of the paper to the other.
Our letters policy, which appears from time to time on our
pages, explicitly states, "letters and articles must be typed,
double-spaced, on a CO space line. "That means set your margins
at 10 and 7 0. This is to enable us to figure out exactly how long
these items are so that they will not have to be butchered on the
late-night cutting block to make the paper piece together.
If you want to see your opinions or whatever appear in print
with an absolute minimum of hassle, please follow these
guidelines and it will make things a lot easier for all of us.
Thanks.
Jesse, Tayloe, Buzz and Phil
