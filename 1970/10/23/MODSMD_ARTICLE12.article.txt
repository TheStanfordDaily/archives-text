## Degrees Mean Little 
### 
Russell kirk

Once upon a time, an
American college degree was some
sort of measurement of
proficiency, at least. But
nowadays the average college
degree sgnifies very little; as
things are going, it may signify
nothing - especially when
permanent employment is in
question.
There writes to me a professor
of one of the sciences, formerly a
colleague of mine, disheartened
by the average undergraduate
today: "Despite all the fine,
brave, optimistic words about the
high quality of entering freshmen
during the past few years," he
remarks, "there is no real
improvement; and in attitude, the
mamority have regressed. They all
crave knowledge and
understanding, so they say; but
they want it by the revelation
route not through study and
thought."
Schooling And Occupation
An editorial in a recent number
of the magazine Science touches
candidly on such questions. "In
the future," writes Mr. Dael
Wolfle, the publisher of Science,
"the relation between years of
schooling and occupation
performance may become even
less close, for the disruptions that
now afflict schools and colleges
and the growing demand for
ungraded courses and completely
free elective programs are likely to
make the time a student is
enrolled in school and college an
even poorer predictor of his adult
competence."
Mr. Wolfle says that as college
degrees cease to signify aptitude
for anything, employers must
develop their own methods for
evaluating applicants for posts. We
are suffering from
"overeducation": as Mr. Wolfle
puts it, "Overemphasis on
academic degrees discriminates
against potential workers who
have the necessary abilities but

lack the required credentials, and
it transfers part of the cost of
employee selection to educational
budgets and to the substantial
number of young people who
remain in college to secure
employment credentials rather
than to acquire greater
competence or further
education."
Dulled Minds
Upon a good many young
people, I venture to add, too
many years of schooling exert an
adverse influence: their minds are
dulled by being in the classroom
almost continuously from the age
of 5, say, to the age of 27 (which
is the minimum length of sentence
served by those of the rising
generation so unhappy as to work
straight through to the Ph.D.).
For myself, I prefer to employ
young men or women who
haven't gone to college at all, or
who (though undergraduates just
now) still are intellectually lively
enough for me to rouse their
imagination.
If half of the students now
enrolled on our campuses were to
drop out, not only would our
colleges and universities become
establishments with higher
standards and better order, but
the drop-outs themselves would
be more content â€¢ and, in the long
run, better off. I do advise any
parents whose offspring dislike
college that, for heaven's sake,
they ought to let those sons and
daughters do something else than
linger bored about the Ivory
Tower.
Let them work, at any sort of
job; they may seek higher
education later. Or, if funds are
available, let them knock about
the world for a year or two:
wandering through Yugoslavia,
say, is a good deal more innocent
than joining a crowd of
discontented ideologues or a circle
of marijuana-addicts in some
dormitory. No souls are saved by
academic degrees.
