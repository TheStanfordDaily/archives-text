# ANNUAL REPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY OMBUDSMAN 1969-70
## 
### 
The office of the University Ombudsman at Stanford started its operations on
February 4, 1970. This report summarizes the activities of our office between its
inception and the end of the academic year 1969-70. The report is being issued
at this time to inform the Stanford community of our work and to introduce
our functions to newcomers to the campus.
The Background and Functions of the Ombudsman's Office
The proposal for the establishment of an Ombudsman at Stanford emanated
from the Committee of Fifteen in May, 1969. It was accepted by President
Pitzer, who then delegated the Provost to appoint a search committee. On the
recommendation of this committee (consisting of one student, one staff mem
ber, one administrator and a member of the faculty), the President appointed
Herant Katchadourian, M.D., as the first Stanford University Ombudsman for
the period from February 1, 1970, to June 30, 1971.
The purpose of the office of the Ombudsman as envisioned by the Committee
of Fifteen was as follows.
"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests and rights of members
of the Stanford community from injustices or abuses of discretion, from
gross inefficiency, from unnecessary delay and complication in the admin
istration of university rules and regulations, and from inconsistency, un
fairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's experience
with university activities. The Ombudsman exists to receive, examine, and
channel the complaints and grievances of members of the Stanford com
munity, and to secure expeditious and impartial redress."
The functions of the Ombudsman as proposed by the Committee of Fifteen
and as implemented in our operations so far can only be stated in relatively
broad terms. While the outer limits of the Ombudsman's authority are fixed,
much of his functions are left deliberately vague and flexible to permit adapta
tion to the specific and changing needs of the Stanford community. Thus, to a
large extent, the Ombudsman does what he is asked to do even though he may
also bring his own personal perspective to bear on University problems. In more
specific terms, the Ombudsman's duties and functions involve the following.
1. His primary obligation is to carry out the task described above; namely, to
hear complaints by members of the Stanford community pertaining to Univer
sity operations. In addition to individuals, any committee, tribunal or officer of
the University may also refer a case to his attention. When he suspects a viola
tion by the University of its own rules and regulations, he investigates the
complaint and brings it to the attention of those responsible. When he becomes
convinced that there has been a miscarriage of justice he vigorously pursues the
matter in order to have the injustice rectified. In this process he may directly
take the issue up with any University official including the President. Where he
fails to get satisfaction, the Ombudsman may issue a public criticism to permit
the community to be the final judge in the matter.
2. Another function of the office of the Ombudsman is to act as an informa
tion center and to direct people to appropriate channels. In a vast and complex
institution such as Stanford, it is not easy to always know where to go to get
information or assistance. Particularly when one needs to act in haste, there
often is an understandable sense of bewilderment and irritation at not knowing
whom to see or ending up seeing the wrong person.
We do not always know where to direct each and every person immediately
but it is easier for us to find out. This also gives us the opportunity to detect
deficiencies in existing channels of communication and to propose that such
avenues be established where none now exist.
Unlike in the first category of functions described above where the Ombuds
man may or may not elect to pursue a matter, we make no evaluations of the
merit of a case where the person merely wishes to find out where to take his
problem.
In this regard our task would be greatly facilitated if administrators would
keep us informed of any changes in their service operations and grievance pro
cedures.
3. In a limited way. the Ombudsman also acts as a facilitator for individuals
and groups who wish to introduce changes and innovations. If convinced of the
merits of a project, he places whatever skills he may have at the disposal of its
proponents or finds others who can be of similar help. He then may act as an
additional advocate for the proposal and help facilitate its acceptance and im
plementation. The Ombudsman may also respond to Administration requests to
conduct inquiries into matters consistent with the basic aims and purposes of his
office.
4. Finally, the Ombudsman makes his own observations concerning Univer
sity functions and makes recommendations to the appropriate authorities.
As is evident from the above, the Ombudsman has a broad mandate and a
potentially vast area of work. His operations are, however, restricted by a num
ber of jurisdictional and practical constraints. For instance:
a. He has no authority to reverse decisions or hold public hearings on his own
initiative.
b. He has no jurisdiction on matters involving persons outside the Stanford
community and the University, or members of the Stanford community and
outside authorities.
c. As a part-time (three days a week) Ombudsman and being assisted by one
full-time person only, the volume and scope of his activities are necessarily
limited. He operates on a very modest budget and has no access to funds to
directly assist individuals or groups.
d. He does not belong to any administrative hierarchy and cannot impose his
decisions on anyone. His powers are that of persuasion and private and public
criticism. While this arrangement may appear to greatly curtail his authority, it is
also a blessing in disguise since as Ombudsman he gives no orders to anyone, nor
does he take orders from anyone. Furthermore, he does have access on a con
fidential basis to all University files and information pertinent to the clarifica
tion of a given case. Incidentally, even though this particular Ombudsman hap
pens to be a psychiatrist, he does not render clinical services in this capacity.
Method of Operation
Any member of the Stanford Community is welcome to see the Ombudsman
tor any problem, grievance, or suggestions he may have related to University
functions. We must emphasize, however, that our function is not to substitute
tor nor to duplicate existing University services. Persons coming to us must do so
either because they do not know where else to go or because they have in fact
exhausted all available channels yet have not found satisfaction.
To contact the Ombudsman, one may write, call, or see him personally, by
appointment or by simply dropping in. We will hear all initial communications
and then determine if there is in fact a legitimate grievance and if so whether we
can be reasonably expected to help rectify the situation. The Ombudsman is not
obliged to pursue any complaint that he finds unjustified or support any pro
posal thai he deems inappropriate. If a complaint or proposal is accepted for
further inquiry, the Ombudsman will pursue the matter until the matter is
clarified, resolved, or proves to be beyond his capacity to deal with. In any case
he will report back to the individual his findings and conclusions. The Ombuds
man consults with others and asks for their assistance only by permission of the
plaintiff. He maintains minimal files that are confidential and makes every effort
to avoid making his office one more bureaucratic station.
The University Ombudsman for the academic year 1970-71 will continue to
be Herant Katchadourian, M.D., Associate Professor of psychiatry. His assistant
is Miss Ann Fdmonds. The Ombudsman is on duty during regular working hours
on Wednesday, Thursdays, and Fridays. On Mondays and Tuesdays, Miss Fd
monds is available to receive initial inquiries and respond to questions.
We are located in Room 81B at the west end of the Inner Ouad. Our tele
phone extensions are 3628 and 3629. Appointments are preferable but not
mandatory. There are no forms to fill out!
Activities During 1969-70
We started our operations early in February of 1970. The events of last May
and the Ombudsman's involvement in activities related to campus protest severe
ly curtailed our regular functions toward the latter part of the spring quarter.
I he office was then closed for (he summer. The following figures thus actually
cover our operations over a period of about three months only.

During this period, HI problems or issues were brought to us. In most in
stances we were approached by a single individual but sometimes several persons
came together for a given grievance. Occasionally these persons were in turn the
spokesmen for larger groups. Thus, the number of persons who actually con
tacted the Ombudsman was closer to a hundred and many of them were seen
more than once. In attempting to clarify or resolve the problems raised, the
Ombudsman had to see another 80 or so individuals; in 26 cases, one additional
person was seen; in 15 cases. 2 persons; in 4 cases. 3 persons; in one case, 4
persons; and in 2 cases, 5 more persons had to be contacted.
Only in 33 instances no one other than the plaintiff was seen. Thus, on the
average, for each person that comes to the Ombudsman, he must in turn see one
additional person. A breakdown of the Ombudsman's activities for this period of
three months is as follows.
A. Reasons for Contacting the Ombudsman
1. Grievances: There were 64 instances in this category constituting 80 per
cent of the cases that were brought to our attention.
2. Suggestions and Proposals: In I 1 cases (13 percent), the individuals had no
specific grievance in the above sense, but they wanted to convey to us
certain suggestions and in some cases more extensive proposals with the
hope that we would present them to the appropriate University officials.
3. Requests for Information: Five instances (7 percent) were outright re
quests for information.
B. Area of Complaint
1. Academic Matters: Almost a third of the issues brought to us were related
to academic activities (26 cases, 32 percent). They included conflicts over
grades, tenure, academic programs, and theses.
2. Student Services and Activities: Ten cases (I 2 percent) involved such mat
ters as athletics, films on campus, one of the campus shops, and inade
quate payment to a research subject.
3. Residences and Dining Halls: Nine cases (11 percent), dealt with theft,
dogs in dining halls, individual cooking facilities, and the selection of
resident advisers.
4. Buildings and Grounds: Nine cases (1 1 percent) were related to road re
pairs, lighting on campus, parking problems and use of pesticides.
5. Staff Benefits: Six cases (7 percent) had to do with educational benefits
for staff and staff dependents, retirement benefits and inadequate office
hours in one of the University services.
6. University Policies and Procedures: Six cases (7 percent) were involved
with administrative matters not covered by any of the above and included
functions of campus policemen, participation of lab technicians in research
planning, and the scheduling of University publications.
7. Tuition and financial Aid: Six cases (7 percent).
8. Admissions: Four cases (5 percent) had to do with admissions into various
programs within the University. (Admissions to Stanford as such is not
within our purview).
9. Other: Five cases (6 percent). Two of these cases involved problems with
non-University agencies and were thus outside our jurisdiction. There were
also two requests for funding of projects and one request for work in the
Ombudsman's Office.
C. Source of Complaints
1. Students: By far the majority of the persons who came to see the Ombuds
man were students (73 percent). Of these, two-thirds were undergraduates
and a third,graduate students.
2. Staff: Twenty-one percent were staff members. A few of them were mem
bers of the administration.
3. Faculty: Only five faculty members (6 percent) used our services. Most of
them came for matters other than the redress of grievances.
D. Outcome
1. Exchange of Information and Advice: In one out of five instances (22
percent) the interaction with the Ombudsman involved giving or receiving
information or advice only.
2. Referred Elsewhere: In about an equal number of times (20 percent) the
person was referred elsewhere. In most cases they were sent to persons
they had not contacted before but in some instances they went back to
channels they had already explored but had done so inadequately in the
opinion ot the Ombudsman. In a number of cases we know the problem to
have been subsequently resolved.
3. I*roblems Resolved: In another 20 percent of cases, the Ombudsman ac
cepted the grievance as legitimate and was able to successfully help rectify
it. In a few cases the issue involved a proposed change rather than a
grievance as such. It must be reemphasized that the Ombudsman cannot
reverse decisions and in that sense he never resolves a problem on his own.
In each instance, some other person has to bring about the necessary
change. It is also probable, of course, that some of these matters may have
been settled anyway. The cases placed in this category are then only those
where, in our judgment, the intervention of the Ombudsman played a
significant role.
4. Problems Not Resolved: In seven cases (8 percent), the Ombudsman con
ceded the legitimacy of a complaint but failed to settle it. For instance, we
set out to recover $7.50 for a student but finally gave up because we could
not locate the graduate student who we felt underpaid her as a research
subject. In other cases, the complaint was accepted as valid by all involved
yet nothing could be done because of lack of University funds (e.g., road
repairs).
5. Outcome Pending: Fourteen grievances or proposals are still under investi
gation. Some ot these are likely to get settled, others will undoubtedly
languish on.
6. Grievance Rejected: In ten cases (12 percent), the Ombudsman felt the
complaint was groundless or the proposal lacking in merit. While in some
cases this conclusion was reached on the basis of the complaint alone, in
most instances further inquiries were necessary to establish this. We must
emphasize that we do not operate as a tribunal, and no one's complaint is
merely tossed out. Where we fail to see a legitimate problem, no effort is
spared to explain the basis for this conclusion. Besides, our refusal to
pursue a case does not necessarily imply that it is groundless. Nor does our
failure or refusal to recognize a grievance as legitimate mean that we do
not attempt to help resolve or alleviate the situation. In short, our basic
task is to assist rather than merely pass judgment.
Additional Activities of the Ombudsman
I he activities described so far accounted for the major share of the Ombuds
man s work during the past academic year. However, a number of additional
tasks deserve mention.
1. Either prompted by the complaints brought to him or spontaneously, the
Ombudsman has sent a number of memoranda to University officials pertaining
to matters of general interest. These dealt with the presence of non-University
police on campus, educational benefits for staff dependents, and the use of
students for advising and counseling other students.
We have initiated and will continue to pursue a comprehensive review of
existing grievance procedures in the University. One reason we have failed to
complete this task so tar is because a number of these procedures were in the
process of being revised.
2. In response to President Pitzer's request the Ombudsman chaired an inter
im study group that explored the advisability of establishing a commission on
dissent at Stanford: an activity which absorbed most of his time during the
month of May. I lie report of the Interim Study Group was submitted to Presi
dent Pitzer on June 1, 1970. It has subsequently been released and copies are on
file in the Undergraduate and Main libraries at the reference desks under the title
Report of the Interim Study Group. Budgetary limitations do not permit us to
make tree copies ot this report generally available to the Stanford community.
3. We were involved in a number of other and sundry activities such as
correspondence and visits with other Ombudsmen, including Mr. Alfred Bex
elius, the Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman, and persons and institutions inter
ested in the concept ot the Ombudsman. We also made some effort to keep up
with events on campus by attending meetings, demonstrations and reading the
pertinent literature put out by various groups, committees and the News Service.
Financial support for this publication comes from the University Relations Office.

Evaluation
By whom and how are the Ombudsman's services to be evaluated? This is
particularly important for us since at Stanford the office is new and as yet not
well established. Our mandate states that we be responsible to the "Stanford
Community." While in general terms one can hardly take issue with this, trans
lating it into operational terms is more problematic. The responsibilities of the
Ombudsman to the Administration are also unclear. While he does not report to
any one person in the University hierarchy, the financial support for his office
comes exclusively from the central administration. Whether the office is main
tained or not will thus presumably depend at least in part on whether the
University finds its services sufficiently worthwhile. Finally, the Ombudsman
must decide for himself how useful his own functions are.
Despite the above ambiguities, the primary responsibility of the Ombudsman
must be to those that actually come to see him, and they should be the first
hand judges of his work. Toward the end of our current term we plan to contact
those who came to see us for such an evaluation. In the absence of such data, at
this time, we shall have to fall back on the less reliable alternative of self-assess
ment.
1. Volume of Activity: Given the novelty of the office and the fact that we
made no concerted effort to advertise our services, we had a fair amount to do.
If in the future there is a substantial increase in the demand for our services, we
will either have to have more help or must become more discriminating in
choosing the cases that we will elect to follow through.
2. Success in Settling Grievances: Our record of resolving only one out of
four grievances is less than overwhelming at first glance. However, one ought to
be suspicious of too successful an Ombudsman since the chances are he would be
doing work that others ought to do. Grievances that reach the Ombudsman must
involve the most tangled and intractable problems, not the run of the mill issues
that are routinely settled across the campus all the time.
3. The Scope and Nature of Our Interactions: The majority of the persons
who came to us were reasonable individuals with sensible problems. Where we
disagreed or were unable to help, they responded with tact and understanding.
We have probably failed to reach large numbers of persons who could have
used our services. In the basements of our buildings, and the corners of our
offices there are countless men and women who share only minimally of those
benefits that the rest of us take for granted. These persons have no access to the
corridors of power and the microphones in White Plaza. Almost certainly, they
also have never heard of the University Ombudsman. This is a serious failing on
our part since if the Ombudsman only greases the wheel that squeaks within his
limited earshot, he surely would have failed in his functions.
On the other hand, it has been at times a test of the Ombudsman's patience
to deal with persons whose expectations from the University stagger the imagina
tion. Since the institution does have certain caretaking functions, it is unrealistic
to expect the University to be mother, daughter, wife, and mistress to all men
and their counterparts to all women at all times.
So far as our dealings with University officials were concerned, we were
always received courteously and listened to even though we did not always get
what we wanted. The President and Provost repeatedly expressed their interest
and support in the work of the Ombudsman and we saw every University official
we wished to see for a given matter. But there were also a number of frustra
tions. Money, for one thing, seems to be in such short supply that proposals that
are likely to be even modestly costly run into immediate resistance.
Also although there is a remarkably widespread receptivity to change at Stan
ford, actually implementing a specific innovation seems to be another matter.
When one attempts to do this, it soon enough becomes clear that Item A cannot
change if Item B does not change also and what appeared to be a simple issue at
the outset turns out to be interlocked with more than one could tackle.
Particularly with regard to staff members, the University appears at times to
give only what it has to rather than responding to actual needs. Admittedly
while there are practical limits to what can be done, one would think, for
instance, that the extensive concern for the educational needs of the students
could in some measure be extended to other members of the community as well,
in particular to those whose needs are so blatant. In this regard, the University
community as a whole rather than the Administration as such must shoulder the
blame.
4. The Grand Affairs of the University and the World: Given the turmoil on
campuses and the crises facing the outside world, one may wonder if the Om
budsman is not wasting his time by recovering a dollar over here, extracting an
apology over there and so on. Judging by our report so far we have not even
mentioned discrimination, violence, war and other crucial issues of today. Does
this mean we feel Stanford has no problems in these areas?
We certainly consider it our business to deal with specific instances of dis
crimination be it on the basis of race, sex, or ethnic background that involve the
University. But we cannot act effectively merely on the basis of feelings and
hearsay. In dealing with such allegations, subjectively perceived truth is not an
adequate substitute for evidence.
Where such issues are raised in more abstract or general terms or where
conflicts involve entire groups, the Ombudsman's role becomes ambiguous and
his capabilities questionable. One evening last May, as the Ombudsman watched
the turmoil in front of the Old Union, a faculty wife asked him in a voice full of
urgency and irritation why he was not doing "something." He would have dearly
liked to know what that "something" could possibly have been. Even without
such external expectation, it is difficult for the Ombudsman to stand by when
the University community is in the grips of serious turmoil. Yet to heedlessly get
involved threatens the Ombudsman's neutrality and without apparent benefit at
that.
Thus the issue as to whether the Ombudsman should narrowly restrict himself
to the redress of personal grievances or become involved in more public issues
remains unresolved. Even in his involvement in an activity such as the work of
the Interim Study Group the Ombudsman could be charged with doing too
much or too little in these areas. I must add, however, that from a personal point
of view, I found my association with the members of the Interim Study Group
to be the single most rewarding experience of the past year.
Finally, the choice between maintaining confidentiality and making our work
public presents another dilemma. The charge of the Committee of Fifteen
specifies that the Ombudsman is ". . .obliged to respect confidences and personal
privacy," a directive that coincides with the inclinations of this particular Om
budsman. However, such confidentiality severely limits the potential benefits of
our olfice. In Sweden, where the concept of the Ombudsman originated, the
Ombudsman's files are open to the public and so are the findings of his investiga
tions, complete with the names of all parties involved. It is felt that the fear of
such public disclosure helps keep public officials efficient and honest. Otherwise,
only those very few that come to the Ombudsman's attention stand to learn
from the experience.
As the present report demonstrates, at Stanford we remain committed to
maintaining confidentiality. We will, however, during the forthcoming year, oc
casionally issue bulletins that point out common problems without dealing with
the identities of the parties involved. These communications will be in addition
to quarterly reports to the community of our activities.
We are grateful for the confidence of all those who came to see us and are
appreciative of the support and good will of many more. During this past year
we have met men and women in the student body, faculty, staff and administra
tion of this University whose efforts on behalf of the Stanford community go
beyond all calls of duty: they are our true Ombudsmen.
