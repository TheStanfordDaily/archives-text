# World Indoor Records
## Hip Capitalism At Its Best 
### CHRIS PECK 
To many a concerned college
graduate, colloquially referred to
as "unkempt-hippy-peace
freaks-bent-on-destroy-
ing-society", the schism between
capitalistic exploitation and
radical social ideology seems
irreconcilable.
But freaks have to eat too, and
the schism between an empty

billfold trying to buy food for a
socially aware but empty stomach
nurtures a reconciliation between
opposing ideologies. The result, at
World Indoor Records in Palo
Alto, is capitalism turned hip and
some hip people turned
capitalists.
Roy Bennett has long, kinky
hair, wears a blue workshirt,and
went to grad school for a semester
and then quit because that was all
he could stand. Now Roy talks
about overheads, volume selling
and expansion in the finest
tradition of J.C. Penny.
But World Indoor Records,
Roy Bennett's shop, is a special
kind of capitalistic enterprise.
"It's a store, " Bennett describes,
"fundamentally a capitalistic
enterprise, but our goals aren't the
same as a small capitalist."
Not Money Oriented
What would first make J.C.
Penny shudder about Toy's store
is Bennett's attitude towards
money. "I'm not personally
interested in getting rich," he
says, "so it's really simple to sell
records to lower prices than
everybody else." You just don't
make as much money."
Milton Friedman might frown
on the economics of such an
enterprise, but the redeeming
social value of such an
economically pornographic
venture outweighs any tinge of
mismanagement. Instead of
profits, World Indoor Records

professes service to the
community as foremost in its list
of priorities.
"My store is here to support
people in the community who
might otherwise have trouble
finding jobs." Roy was once one
of those people who couldn't find
a job when he came to California
in 1 967.
Granny's Cottage
The shop was born last April
when Bennett amassed what little
capital he had and bought 400
records. "I got the idea from
Leopold's in Berkeley," he says.
The present store looks like
Granny's Cottage in Little Red
Riding hood.
Inside, cantaloupe crates serve
as record racks, homemade
partitions and speakers create a
sort of underground Better
Homes and Gardens atmosphere.
If the store proves successful,
Bennett proposes that the
profits "be used in the
community. "The community"
Roy and his friends contemplate
"has a number of projects that
might come up which we could
help. The People's Medical Center
in Redwood City for example."
The general hip community,
Stanford students, and high
schoolers keep the Lytton and
Kipling record shop alive. Of
straight customers Bennett shrugs
his enlightened capitalist's
shoulders, "Their money is just as
good as anybody else's, right?"

What World Indoor Records
must ultimately do to stay in
business is sell hordes of hit tunes
to anybody who walks up the
weathered steaps of the store.
"The only way we can stay in
business, "Roy admits, "is if we
have high volume sales."
Uncle Scrooge and any other
web-footed pennypinchers need
only compare prices between
World Indoor and the other
record stores in the area to
discover where they should
waddle for rock and jazz albums.
Discount Records asks $3.99
for Led Zepplin 1111, Stage Fright
by The Band, and other new
releases. World Indoor will sell the
same releases for $3.57. Town &
Country sells Woodstock tor
$9.98, World Indoor the same for
$8.62.
Even if these prices are too
high, a less expensive starvation
budget record library can be had
from the used record department.
World Indoor gets to the world
outdoors only through the Daily,
the Barb, and by word of mouth.
"In the long run, "Roy Bennett
says, "word of mouth is the best.
But right now we need a little
more." As an alternative to what
some think are undesirable
economic structures in today's
society, the hip capitalists at
World Indoor Records will
provide music for their ears.
