# SWOPSI--Action-Oriented Education
## 
### TOM QUINN 
When students cry after
"relevance" in education they
usually mean that they want more
action-oriented study. SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops On Social
and Political Issues) provides it.
Students are not the only
beneficiaries. That society should
benefit from study is a core
principle of the SWOPSI program.
SWOPSI offers informality in
2 2 courses designed to stimulate
those who seek (action-oriented)
education along with University
credit.
For a SWOPSI workshop to
btain credit, it is currently
necessary to present the workshop
either as an Undergradute Special
through the Undergraduate
Studies Board or through the
Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education
(SCIRE).
"There hasn't been too much
trouble getting credit for the
courses this year, except in a few
instances," said Nick Corff,
part-time director of SWOPSI.
A wide spectrum of the
University community is

participating in the workshops:
full professors, graduate students,
some outside people as well as
undergraduates. However, before
a course can be offered for credit,
it must be sponsored by a member
of the faculty.
Although most of the
community has responded
vigorously, there apparently has
been little response from social
science professors.
"However, the students'
response has been tremendous,"
Corff said. "The workshop on
Teaching and Learning in
Alternative Schools has 9 5
students; 'Police: A Closer Look,'
led by two graduate students has
8 4 enrolled; and the workshop on
Societal Effects of Mass
Communications has 45
students," Corff continued.
Funding Limited
However, SWOPSI funding
appears to be running out. The
workshops now have a $15,000
budget of funds from a Ford
Foundation grant and a University
Fellows' innovation fund. The
present budget can handle
classroom expenses, but probably

not all of SWOPSI's printing
expenses, critical because of the
workshops' action-oriented
nature.
SWOPSI hopes to attract more
money from various other
sources. Corff said that "Right
now, 'Police: A Closer Look' is
trying to obtain a federal grant for
research to improve
police-community relations."
But at present, the University
handles all SWOPSI funding
through a University account with
a estimated budget having a 10
percent leeway.
"Ideally, SWOPSI directors
would like the money free of
strings because of the irregular
cost of publishing its reports.
However, the University officials
don't fuss too much about
adjusting the budget," Corff
stated.
SWOPSI Success
Since the workshops' inception
a year ago, SWOPSI is considered
to be successful, as evidenced by
the numerous, significant reports
published by the original
workshops. A 380-page report on
Pollution in the Bay Area has

received much attention. A report
on logging in urban counties has
resulted in passage of legislation
by the California Assembly to
regulate tree-cutting. SWOPSI's
Pescadero Dam report was
instrumental in that dam's not
being built.
Though these successes have
been lauded by many, others have
claimed that SWOPSI's goals are
basically short-ranged and its
research is therefore not as
valuable or permanent as in
conventional courses.
Corff does not agree. "SWOPSI
channels student energy into
producing programs that are
relevant," he said. "Although the
courses are action-oriented, what
the students are getting out of
them academically is fantastic.
For example, many Stanford
students don't know how . to
research problems; but they know
how after a SWOPSI workshop."
A Rational Approach
"The volume of science learned
in SWOPSI will be retained. It will

be learned for a specific
purpose . . .The academic
purposes alone are too cold and
the knowledge often doesn't last."
SWOPSI hopes to retain an
average of 2 5 workshops per
quarter and, in accordance, 25 are
scheduled for the Winter and
Spring Quarters. Corff hopes that
the workshops will get sufficient
University funding but realizes
that the current budget cutbacks
and general belt-tightening will
probably affect SWOPSI too.
What SWOPSI leaders want most
is to make the program a
permanent part of the community
with a status equal or similar to
University departments.
In justification of SWOPSI,
Corff said that "carefully
researched knowledge is a most
potent thing in the hands of
students with regard to change. If
one has the answers, it will be
difficult to deny them. Most of
what has passed has been
emotional; SWOPSI is attempting
to look for answers in a more
rational sort of way."

instrumental in that dam's not
being built.
Though these successes have
been lauded by many, others have
claimed that SWOPSI's goals are
basically short-ranged and its
research is therefore not as
valuable or permanent as in
conventional courses.
Corff does not agree. "SWOPSI
channels student energy into
producing programs that are
relevant," he said. "Although the
courses are action-oriented, what
the students are getting out of
them academically is fantastic.
For example, many Stanford
students don't know how . to
research problems; but they know
how after a SWOPSI workshop."
A Rational Approach
"The volume of science learned
in SWOPSI will be retained. It will

be learned for a specific
purpose . . .The academic
purposes alone are too cold and
the knowledge often doesn't last."
SWOPSI hopes to retain an
average of 2 5 workshops per
quarter and, in accordance, 25 are
scheduled for the Winter and
Spring Quarters. Corff hopes that
the workshops will get sufficient
University funding but realizes
that the current budget cutbacks
and general belt-tightening will
probably affect SWOPSI too.
What SWOPSI leaders want most
is to make the program a
permanent part of the community
with a status equal or similar to
University departments.
In justification of SWOPSI,
Corff said that "carefully
researched knowledge is a most
potent thing in the hands of
students with regard to change. If
one has the answers, it will be
difficult to deny them. Most of
what has passed has been
emotional; SWOPSI is attempting
to look for answers in a more
rational sort of way."
When students cry after
"relevance" in education they
usually mean that they want more
action-oriented study. SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops On Social
and Political Issues) provides it.
Students are not the only
beneficiaries. That society should
benefit from study is a core
principle of the SWOPSI program.
SWOPSI offers informality in
2 2 courses designed to stimulate
those who seek (action-oriented)
education along with University
credit.
For a SWOPSI workshop to
btain credit, it is currently
necessary to present the workshop
either as an Undergradute Special
through the Undergraduate
Studies Board or through the
Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education
(SCIRE).
"There hasn't been too much
trouble getting credit for the
courses this year, except in a few
instances," said Nick Corff,
part-time director of SWOPSI.
A wide spectrum of the
University community is

participating in the workshops:
full professors, graduate students,
some outside people as well as
undergraduates. However, before
a course can be offered for credit,
it must be sponsored by a member
of the faculty.
Although most of the
community has responded
vigorously, there apparently has
been little response from social
science professors.
"However, the students'
response has been tremendous,"
Corff said. "The workshop on
Teaching and Learning in
Alternative Schools has 9 5
students; 'Police: A Closer Look,'
led by two graduate students has
8 4 enrolled; and the workshop on
Societal Effects of Mass
Communications has 45
students," Corff continued.
Funding Limited
However, SWOPSI funding
appears to be running out. The
workshops now have a $15,000
budget of funds from a Ford
Foundation grant and a University
Fellows' innovation fund. The
present budget can handle
classroom expenses, but probably

not all of SWOPSI's printing
expenses, critical because of the
workshops' action-oriented
nature.
SWOPSI hopes to attract more
money from various other
sources. Corff said that "Right
now, 'Police: A Closer Look' is
trying to obtain a federal grant for
research to improve
police-community relations."
But at present, the University
handles all SWOPSI funding
through a University account with
a estimated budget having a 10
percent leeway.
"Ideally, SWOPSI directors
would like the money free of
strings because of the irregular
cost of publishing its reports.
However, the University officials
don't fuss too much about
adjusting the budget," Corff
stated.
SWOPSI Success
Since the workshops' inception
a year ago, SWOPSI is considered
to be successful, as evidenced by
the numerous, significant reports
published by the original
workshops. A 380-page report on
Pollution in the Bay Area has

received much attention. A report
on logging in urban counties has
resulted in passage of legislation
by the California Assembly to
regulate tree-cutting. SWOPSI's
Pescadero Dam report was
instrumental in that dam's not
being built.

Alternative Schools has 9 5
students; 'Police: A Closer Look,'
led by two graduate students has
8 4 enrolled; and the workshop on
Societal Effects of Mass
Communications has 45
students," Corff continued.
Funding Limited
However, SWOPSI funding
appears to be running out. The
workshops now have a $15,000
budget of funds from a Ford
Foundation grant and a University
Fellows' innovation fund. The
present budget can handle
classroom expenses, but probably

not all of SWOPSI's printing
expenses, critical because of the
workshops' action-oriented
nature.
SWOPSI hopes to attract more
money from various other
sources. Corff said that "Right
now, 'Police: A Closer Look' is
trying to obtain a federal grant for
research to improve
police-community relations."
But at present, the University
handles all SWOPSI funding
through a University account with
a estimated budget having a 10
percent leeway.
"Ideally, SWOPSI directors
would like the money free of
strings because of the irregular
cost of publishing its reports.
However, the University officials
don't fuss too much about
adjusting the budget," Corff
stated.
SWOPSI Success
Since the workshops' inception
a year ago, SWOPSI is considered
to be successful, as evidenced by
the numerous, significant reports
published by the original
workshops. A 380-page report on
Pollution in the Bay Area has

received much attention. A report
on logging in urban counties has
resulted in passage of legislation
by the California Assembly to
regulate tree-cutting. SWOPSI's
Pescadero Dam report was
instrumental in that dam's not
being built.
Though these successes have
been lauded by many, others have
claimed that SWOPSI's goals are
basically short-ranged and its
research is therefore not as
valuable or permanent as in
conventional courses.
Corff does not agree. "SWOPSI
channels student energy into
producing programs that are
relevant," he said. "Although the
courses are action-oriented, what
the students are getting out of
them academically is fantastic.
For example, many Stanford
students don't know how . to
research problems; but they know
how after a SWOPSI workshop."
A Rational Approach
"The volume of science learned
in SWOPSI will be retained. It will

be learned for a specific
purpose . . .The academic
purposes alone are too cold and
the knowledge often doesn't last."
SWOPSI hopes to retain an
average of 2 5 workshops per
quarter and, in accordance, 25 are
scheduled for the Winter and
Spring Quarters. Corff hopes that
the workshops will get sufficient
University funding but realizes
that the current budget cutbacks
and general belt-tightening will
probably affect SWOPSI too.
What SWOPSI leaders want most
is to make the program a
permanent part of the community
with a status equal or similar to
University departments.
In justification of SWOPSI,
Corff said that "carefully
researched knowledge is a most
potent thing in the hands of
students with regard to change. If
one has the answers, it will be
difficult to deny them. Most of
what has passed has been
emotional; SWOPSI is attempting
to look for answers in a more
rational sort of way."
When students cry after
"relevance" in education they
usually mean that they want more
action-oriented study. SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops On Social
and Political Issues) provides it.
Students are not the only
beneficiaries. That society should
benefit from study is a core
principle of the SWOPSI program.
SWOPSI offers informality in
2 2 courses designed to stimulate
those who seek (action-oriented)
education along with University
credit.
For a SWOPSI workshop to
btain credit, it is currently
necessary to present the workshop
either as an Undergradute Special
through the Undergraduate
Studies Board or through the
Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education
(SCIRE).
"There hasn't been too much
trouble getting credit for the
courses this year, except in a few
instances," said Nick Corff,
part-time director of SWOPSI.
A wide spectrum of the
University community is

participating in the workshops:
full professors, graduate students,
some outside people as well as
undergraduates. However, before
a course can be offered for credit,
it must be sponsored by a member
of the faculty.
Although most of the
community has responded
vigorously, there apparently has
been little response from social
science professors.
"However, the students'
response has been tremendous,"
Corff said. "The workshop on
Teaching and Learning in
Alternative Schools has 9 5
students; 'Police: A Closer Look,'
led by two graduate students has
8 4 enrolled; and the workshop on
Societal Effects of Mass
Communications has 45
