Topless.
Condor.
North Beach.
Bottomless. Davie Rosenburg claims credit for
having made all of these as much of a household
word as household word. (You thought I was going
to say Agnew, didn't you?)
Rosenburg who is the press agent for the Condor
Club in North Beach, spoke at Stanford Tuesday
afternoon accompanied by two of the club's
pectoral performers, Lola Raquel and Sunny.
Bill Rivers, at whose course, "Problems in the
Mass Media," Rosenburg spoke, now claims that
because of Lola and Sunny, his is the only course at
Stanford which is rated X.
"You've got to promote yourself as well as your
product," said Rosenburg, who has gained national
recognition through such publicity stunts as anti-bra
day which got busted, a topless Santa Claus at
Christmas time which got busted, and recently
dropping a pair of panties on the desk of the head
of the Alcoholic Beverage Commission, which
believe it or not, also got busted, I guess this goes to
show that you can't go topless without a bust.
Rosenburg even found the time to pull a stunt
before class, taking Lola and Sunny over to the
practice field to meet Jim Plunkett.
"He was so nice!" exclaimed Lola, who at
4 4-23-36 was clad in a tight red and white striped
poorboy with a Stanford Indian (decal, that is)
affixed to each breast. Lola says that Jim made
some nice passes but did not say whether they were
the kind that get you the Heisman trophy or into
trouble.
Apparently Coach John Ralston wasn't too
impressed with the whole affair, but this didn't
seem to bother Rosenburg.
"Let Ralston sue me," says Rosenburg, "just so

the Condor's in big print. We could have made every
paper in the country if we had had the girls run out
nude and leap on Plunkett and gotten a picture of
it,"he continued, "we just didn't want to get
arrested today."
There are two sets of people Rosenburg dislikes,
women press agents and politicians.
"All politicians are hypocrites," claims
Rosenburg, pointing out that just after the
Administration's denunciation of the pornography
report, Attorney General John Mitchell's press
secretary was in the Condor looking at the show
with eyes so wide open, "you'd think he'd never
seen it before."
Rosenburg also dislikes designer Rudy Gernreich,
although admitting that he owes Rudy a lot for
inventing the topless swimsuit. "I challenged him to
a debate one time," explains Rosenburg. "I told him
that I'd bring one of my girls, and he could bring
one of his friends and we'd see what happened."
Rosenburg also touched on the subject of silicon
injections the aftermath of which, says Rosenburg,
was that the "whole topless industry simply grew."
Commenting on what lies in store for nudity on
the stage, Rosenburg explained. "All-male nude
shows are just on the verge of making a big
entrance."
Yet Davie appears to be ready. "I've already got
my first publicity stunt," he boasts. "We're going to
picket 'Fruit of the Loom."
Lola and Sunny said that they really "got good
vibes from the class."
"It made us want to go back to school," sighed
Sunny.
Lola and Sunny added that the whole class
should stop by the Condor and see them. Dave
Rosenburg also claims that the drinks at the Condor
are always on the house for Bill Rivers.
So the next time you're down around North
Beach, stop by the Condor, ask for Lola or Sunny,
and tell them Bill Rivers sent you.

Stanford which is rated X.
"You've got to promote yourself as well as your
product," said Rosenburg, who has gained national
recognition through such publicity stunts as anti-bra
day which got busted, a topless Santa Claus at
Christmas time which got busted, and recently
dropping a pair of panties on the desk of the head
of the Alcoholic Beverage Commission, which
believe it or not, also got busted, I guess this goes to
show that you can't go topless without a bust.
Rosenburg even found the time to pull a stunt
before class, taking Lola and Sunny over to the
practice field to meet Jim Plunkett.
"He was so nice!" exclaimed Lola, who at
4 4-23-36 was clad in a tight red and white striped
poorboy with a Stanford Indian (decal, that is)
affixed to each breast. Lola says that Jim made
some nice passes but did not say whether they were
the kind that get you the Heisman trophy or into
trouble.
Apparently Coach John Ralston wasn't too
impressed with the whole affair, but this didn't
seem to bother Rosenburg.
"Let Ralston sue me," says Rosenburg, "just so

the Condor's in big print. We could have made every
paper in the country if we had had the girls run out
nude and leap on Plunkett and gotten a picture of
it,"he continued, "we just didn't want to get
arrested today."
There are two sets of people Rosenburg dislikes,
women press agents and politicians.
"All politicians are hypocrites," claims
Rosenburg, pointing out that just after the
Administration's denunciation of the pornography
report, Attorney General John Mitchell's press
secretary was in the Condor looking at the show
with eyes so wide open, "you'd think he'd never
seen it before."
Rosenburg also dislikes designer Rudy Gernreich,
although admitting that he owes Rudy a lot for
inventing the topless swimsuit. "I challenged him to
a debate one time," explains Rosenburg. "I told him
that I'd bring one of my girls, and he could bring
one of his friends and we'd see what happened."
Rosenburg also touched on the subject of silicon
injections the aftermath of which, says Rosenburg,
was that the "whole topless industry simply grew."
Commenting on what lies in store for nudity on
the stage, Rosenburg explained. "All-male nude
shows are just on the verge of making a big
entrance."
Yet Davie appears to be ready. "I've already got
my first publicity stunt," he boasts. "We're going to
picket 'Fruit of the Loom."
Lola and Sunny said that they really "got good
vibes from the class."
"It made us want to go back to school," sighed
Sunny.
Lola and Sunny added that the whole class
should stop by the Condor and see them. Dave
Rosenburg also claims that the drinks at the Condor
are always on the house for Bill Rivers.
So the next time you're down around North
Beach, stop by the Condor, ask for Lola or Sunny,
and tell them Bill Rivers sent you.
