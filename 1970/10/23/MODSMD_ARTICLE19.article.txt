# SLAC Gun Turret Ready
## 
### CHARLES HORN 
New things are added to the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) all the time, and
their latest addition has to be the
ultimate in originality. The Center
has managed to acquire a gun, and
not just any old slouch of a gun,
either. SLAC is the proud owner
of a 5 in. naval cannon complete
with turret and rotating base.
The discovery of the gun came
at the climax to a series of wild
rumors that SLAC had decided to
take no chances in beefing up its
defenses. In the wake of the rash
of bombings around the country,
it was rumored that someone had
found the ultimate in safeguards
against radical attack.
With this gun in full operation,

downtown Palo Alto, the
Stanford hills, or White Plaza
could be decisively liquidated
with little more than the squint of
an eye and the push of a button.
A casual look at the gun,
located in a parking lot near the
Computer Center, would seem to
support such contentions. Taken
from a destroyer being dismantled
at Mare Island, the cannon is of
the sort used to sink battleships.
SLAC received it from the
government for the price of
trucking it down from the
shipyard; obstensibly the gun was
left on the turret, because to take
it off would have cost SLAC the
price of the labor.
Parts from the gun were to be
used in the operation of the

Center, especially the rotating
base which was to be used for
winding magnetic coils. However,
funds have run low at the Center,
and the various projects in mind
have been scrapped.
Not so with the gun. What has
caused all the excitement was the
fact that it has only recently been
in full view for all to see.
It stood for a year behind the
Cryogenics lab where few were
able to see it; however, with the
construction of a new access road
to the lab, it was recently moved
to its present place in front of the
Comp. Center. At that time
somebody stumbled upon it and
spread the word around that
SLAC had decided to take no
chances in its defensive setup.
