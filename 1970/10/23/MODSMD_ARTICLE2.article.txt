# University Liberals Now Assuming Defensive Posture Against Violence

It is a time for prophets. If protest
is prophetic, its ultimate aim is
restoration, renewal, and redemption."
The words are B. Davie Napier's.
The time is November, 1 967. Some of
this year's seniors, then freshmen, were
sitting in the pews of Memorial Church.
Columbia 1 968, Cornell 1969, and
Stanford's own sharp springs of
discontent were as yet unrealized.
'7 think we need to revolutionary
voice, and we need to listen to it, but I
hope we can contain it; I think we
can."
B. Davie Napier, September, 1968.
Columbia and the Old Union Sit-in had
passed. More was to come, but the first
alarm signals were going up, and the
desire to control dissent and protest
was being voiced alongside the wish to
hear and heed them.
The first alarms have passed now,
and the desire for control has caught up
with and perhaps outstripped the hope
for reform. The need for reform is not
omitted from the words of liberal
University spokesmen, but talks to
students, faculty and alumni
increasingly stress the dangers facing
the University, and its need to protect
itself against them.
The University is on the defensive,
and now its liberal spokesmen are
rushing to protect its battlements.
Hardened Attitudes
Attitudes of liberal academicians
towards the widening surge of campus
unrest have hardened as the violence of
dissenters has increased. Hard-line
actions to protect academic freedom

have supplanted the benign
permissiveness of former days.
Hesitancy to criticize the radical
adventures which followed the voices
of change has vanished.
Liberal permissiveness was at no
time more evident than during

News Analysis

Stanford's first major sit-in in the
spring of 1 968 . At that time, professors
voted to adopt the students' demands
and to grant amnesty to the sitters-in.
A similar attitude prevailed after the
1 969 sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL). Despite repeated
statements that prosecution of
protesters was imminent, no charges
resulted from the nine-day sit-in.
Several days later, radicals
abondoned their gentlemanly tactics,
and violently broke in Encina Hall. The
change in response was immediately
clear, as several prominent University
liberals went with police to the building
to evict the radicals.
More Vociferous
Since then, the voices of University
liberals decrying violent tactics have
increased in vociferousness; nowhere is
this more evident than in President
Richard Lyman's 1 970 Convocation
address.
"Clearly," Lyman began, "college
students and other university people
must help accomplish the needed
changes." But this plea for change was
followed by paragraph after paragraph
detailing the dangers facing the
politicized University.

"It may just be," he went on to say,
"that you have entered the University
at a moment in history when, on top of
everything else, its body is being fought
over and its soul imperilled . . .
"If the political voice of youth is to
be the voice of the Wisconsin bombers,

nihilism and despair will be the only
winners ...
"There's something particularly
contemptible about academic
apologists for violence," he added.
In a recent conversation with the
Daily, Lyman noted the shift in
concern. "There is a concern to defend
the University," he stated, "now that
attacks are more clearly recognized.
There is a greater tendency to realize

that, while things need changing, some
things need defending too."
Other University figures who have
played a prominent part in the reforms
of the past, are now more clearly
sorting themselves out from the tactics
of radical and revolutionary change.
They are alligning themselves
against those tactics, which they feel
endanger the University, even though
this may mean a temporary muting of
their cries for reform.
"I think the University is justified in
defending itself," says Napier, Dean of
Memorial Chapel said recently, "and
this will inevitably restrain the
protesting voice. We're going through a
period of transition.
"But this doesn't mean that in six
months or a year we won't come back
to the same rate of innovation we have
had in the past."
