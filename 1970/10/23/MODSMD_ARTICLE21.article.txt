The film that catapulted
Wilfred Brambell to stardom, "A
HARD DAYS NIGHT" is being
shown this evening at 7, 9 , and 11

in Dinkelspiel. United Artists
advised the director Richard
Lester to get the picture out as
quickly as possible because they
felt that by June 1 964 no one
would have heard of the Beatles.

Much to the chagrin of Sprio
Agnew and the Catholic Church,
the Beatles became very popular
and continued to write songs and
make movies.
Director Lester di'scribing the
Beatles' popularity; '"Hie only
way we could defend ourselves
(during the concert sequence) was
by upending the Arriflex camera
tripod and holding it with the
spikes outstretched against their
charge." "A HARD DAYS
NIGHT" is an entertaining
document of the Beatles and fans
of seven years ago. (Seven years
ago the Beatles' short hair was
long and fans were stranger than
performers. The Chaparral needs
the money so go.
The Orson Welles Series
continues this week with "MR.
ARKADIN" (1 962) which will be
shown at 7 , 8 , and 9 in Tresidder
Union.
A 1948 Howard Hawks horse
opera, "RED RIVER" starring
Montgomery CI i ft as John
Wayne's stepson will be presented
this evening in Cubberley at 7 :30
and 9:30 by the VIA Film Series.
"RED RIVER" is actually an
exciting classic Western epic

filmed in the C.B. DeMille
tradition. Six thousand head of
cattle were rented at $10 a day
each making "RED RIVER" one
of the most expensive Westerns
ever made. Trivia, number 409.
Saturday, Tresidder Union will
present the fifth film of a series of
French films before the new wave.
"THE BAKER'S WIFE" made by
Marcel Pagnol in 1 938 was
described by the N.Y. Times as
"one of the very greatest pictures
ever made: pagan, poetic, and
incomparably witty." The film
will be shown at 7,8, and 9 in
Tresidder Union.
An excellent Japanese film,
directed bv Hiroshi Teshingahara
in 1 964 , "WOMEN IN THE
DUNES" will be shown Saturday
at 8 and 10 in Cubberley. The
film according to Stanley
Kauffmann concerns "the story of
an ultracon temporary office
worker who goes to a lonely
beach on his vacation to pursue
his hobby of insect-collecting. He
stumbles on an isolated,
impoverished fishing village which
has built its house in deep pits in
the dunes to protect them from
the weather. He stays overnight as

the guest of a woman in such a
house."
"In the morning the ladder is
not thrown down for him to
leave; the village is short of
manpower and he is kept a
working prisoner. He is to help
shovel sand into buckets, which
are drawn up, to keep houses
from slowly being buried. He is
also presumably to beget children
with the woman. He is thus
press-ganged into the survival and
continuity of the struggling
village. His evolution in the pit
house, is in story and symbol, the
material of the film." Male
chauvinists take note.
A Hitchcock thriller
"NOTORIOUS" starring Ingrid
Bergman and Cary Grant is being
sponsored by the Stanford Law
School Film Society at 7:30 and
10 "There's nothing better than a
good Alfred Hitchcock" M.K.E.
"BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE
SUNDANCE KID" will not be
shown at the Sunday Flicks
because it's a "racist flick." "THE
STRANGER" starring Marcello
Mastroianni will be shown instead
at 7 :30 this Sunday in Memorial
Auditorium.
