# Krosnick A Disappointment
## 
### DAVID L. GLASS 
I last heard Joel Krosnick perform some three
or four years ago, and as a result looked forward to
his recital last Friday in Dinkelspiel with much
eagerness. Alas, except for his hair, which
apparently hasn't been cut since then (right on!),
he was disappointing.
The disappointment was keen, as the program
held much promise - both from the excellent
selection of works and from the added attraction
of Charles Wuorinen, one of our more gifted
young composers and winner of the 1970 Pulitzer
Prize in Music, as piano accompanist.
The program began with Beethoven's C major
Sonata, Op. 102 No. 1, an attractive and relatively
unproblematic piece. From the beginning,
Krosnick appeared to be struggling, sometimes
seeming on the verge of losing control, and on the
whole mastered by the music, rather than vice
versa. Perhaps he had inadequate time for
rehearsal, not an uncommon problem for an artist
who concertizes extensively. Moreover, he seemed
noticeably flat, particularly in the higher register; I
suspect the instrument was improperly tuned
before starting.
Wuorimen's accompaniment was facile and
graceful enough, but on louder passages he
drowned the cello completely. This was equally
Krosnick's fault, though; his tone was hesitant and
two-dimensional, lacking in the fullness of which
he is capable.
The next selection was a 1 969 composition by
Wuroinun, "Adapting to the Times." The title is a
mystery to me, except that it appeared to sum up
the audience's problem. Yet it was hardly a radical
piece, by contemporary standards. The piece is a
study in contrasts, exploring the coloristic effects
achieved as tones and musical ideas are
interchanged between the two instruments, and
ranging from percussive to lyrical in its statements.
However, as a whole it didn't hang together well;
it was overly long for its material, and often
seemed to lack a sense of direction.
Still, it is a pleasure to hear new music. I, for
one, resent the attitude of many people that the
concert hall should adopt the dictum of New

York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which only
shows work by artists who have been dead for at
least fifty years.
Following intermission, Bach's Sonata No. 3 in
G minor, a delicious, if relatively minor tidbit from
the Master was given a reading. Krosnick's playing
suffered from a lack of precision, which gave a
noodley effect to the longer passages. It just
wasn't his night, I guess.
However, all was redeemed with the final
selection, Elliot Carter's Sonata (1948 ), a
milestone of contemporary music. I can only urge
the disturbingly large number of people who left
after the Bach to buy Krosnick's new recording of
this piece on the Nonesuch label (as I will), and
listen to it over and over.
I had the privilege of meeting Elliot Carter
several years ago, and was treated to an
explanation of this piece. Carter's approach to
writing for the cello is somewhat unique in that he
seeks to concentrate its operation in the higher
registers, thus avoiding conflict with the piano
which tends to dominate in the lower registers.
Also, there is little or no imitation; the two
instruments go their own way, with the structure
and logic of the piece resulting from Carter's
skillful contrapuntal weaving of the two lines.
This, I might add, is the key to much of Carter's
later music.
Carter is widely considered our greatest living
American composer, and the Cello Sonata is a
cornerstone of this reputation. Krosnick's
performance of it was, quite simply, the finest I've
ever heard, by several orders of magnitude. He
seemed to find himself completely; all of his
earlier hesitation disappeared and his tone regained
its richness. Not a nuance was left unexplored as
Krosnick brought out every bit of drama, color
and lyricism, aided by Wuorinen's extremely
intelligent and empathetic accompaniment.
Lovers of chamber music should make note of
next Sunday's (Oct. 25) program in the Arts at
Stanford Series. The Guarneri String Quartet will
be performing at 3 p.m. in Dinkelspiel, and I think
it's safe to say you will never hear a better quartet
anywhere.

selection, Elliot Carter's Sonata (1948 ), a
milestone of contemporary music. I can only urge
the disturbingly large number of people who left
after the Bach to buy Krosnick's new recording of
this piece on the Nonesuch label (as I will), and
listen to it over and over.
I had the privilege of meeting Elliot Carter
several years ago, and was treated to an
explanation of this piece. Carter's approach to
writing for the cello is somewhat unique in that he
seeks to concentrate its operation in the higher
registers, thus avoiding conflict with the piano
which tends to dominate in the lower registers.
Also, there is little or no imitation; the two
instruments go their own way, with the structure
and logic of the piece resulting from Carter's
skillful contrapuntal weaving of the two lines.
This, I might add, is the key to much of Carter's
later music.
Carter is widely considered our greatest living
American composer, and the Cello Sonata is a
cornerstone of this reputation. Krosnick's
performance of it was, quite simply, the finest I've
ever heard, by several orders of magnitude. He
seemed to find himself completely; all of his
earlier hesitation disappeared and his tone regained
its richness. Not a nuance was left unexplored as
Krosnick brought out every bit of drama, color
and lyricism, aided by Wuorinen's extremely
intelligent and empathetic accompaniment.
Lovers of chamber music should make note of
next Sunday's (Oct. 25) program in the Arts at
Stanford Series. The Guarneri String Quartet will
be performing at 3 p.m. in Dinkelspiel, and I think
it's safe to say you will never hear a better quartet
anywhere.
I last heard Joel Krosnick perform some three
or four years ago, and as a result looked forward to
his recital last Friday in Dinkelspiel with much
eagerness. Alas, except for his hair, which
apparently hasn't been cut since then (right on!),
he was disappointing.
The disappointment was keen, as the program
held much promise - both from the excellent
selection of works and from the added attraction
of Charles Wuorinen, one of our more gifted
young composers and winner of the 1970 Pulitzer
Prize in Music, as piano accompanist.
The program began with Beethoven's C major
Sonata, Op. 102 No. 1, an attractive and relatively
unproblematic piece. From the beginning,
Krosnick appeared to be struggling, sometimes
seeming on the verge of losing control, and on the
whole mastered by the music, rather than vice
versa. Perhaps he had inadequate time for
rehearsal, not an uncommon problem for an artist
who concertizes extensively. Moreover, he seemed
noticeably flat, particularly in the higher register; I
suspect the instrument was improperly tuned
before starting.
Wuorimen's accompaniment was facile and
graceful enough, but on louder passages he
drowned the cello completely. This was equally
Krosnick's fault, though; his tone was hesitant and
two-dimensional, lacking in the fullness of which
he is capable.
The next selection was a 1 969 composition by
Wuroinun, "Adapting to the Times." The title is a
mystery to me, except that it appeared to sum up
the audience's problem. Yet it was hardly a radical
piece, by contemporary standards. The piece is a
study in contrasts, exploring the coloristic effects
achieved as tones and musical ideas are
interchanged between the two instruments, and
ranging from percussive to lyrical in its statements.
However, as a whole it didn't hang together well;
it was overly long for its material, and often
seemed to lack a sense of direction.
Still, it is a pleasure to hear new music. I, for
one, resent the attitude of many people that the
concert hall should adopt the dictum of New

York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which only
shows work by artists who have been dead for at
least fifty years.
Following intermission, Bach's Sonata No. 3 in
G minor, a delicious, if relatively minor tidbit from
the Master was given a reading. Krosnick's playing
suffered from a lack of precision, which gave a
noodley effect to the longer passages. It just
wasn't his night, I guess.
However, all was redeemed with the final
selection, Elliot Carter's Sonata (1948 ), a
milestone of contemporary music. I can only urge
