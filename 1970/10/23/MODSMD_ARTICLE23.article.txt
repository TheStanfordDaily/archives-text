# Kilty Great In 'Dear Love'
## 
### 
This Monday Jerome Kilty's
"Dear Love" opened for a limited
engagement at the Geary Theatre.
"Dear Love" is a play about the
two year courtship of Robert
Browning and Elizabeth Barrett,
based upon their poems, sonnets,
and several hundred letters
written during those two years.
Since Mr. Browning and Miss
Barrett wrote each other at least
once a day, and often two or
three times, Mr. Kilty in writing
this play had much excellent
material upon which to draw.
Certainly incorporating the works
of two of England's greatest poets
into one's play gives a play merit
from the beginning.
The play is more than just the
writings of the Brownings. It is
also a demonstration of the skill
of Mr. Kilty who has beautifully
blended his writing with that of
the Brownings. He has added the
proper amounts of biography to

allow the audience to know
Robert and Elizabeth and to
appreciate the feeling expressed
through their letters.
As for the performance the
actual acting, well here again Mr.
Kilty must be complimented; for,
not only has he written "Dear
Love," he also has taken on the
part of Robert Browning. Mr.
Kilty obviously does a fine job.
He has gotten completely into his
part. Jerome Kilty smiles and
laughs and shouts and whispers
exactly as Robert Browning
should.
On the other hand, Myrna Loy
does not convince me that she is
Elizabeth Barrett. She may be
Myrna Loy playing Miss Barrett,
but she herself is not the poetess.
The fact that she is acting is
apparent. I have the feeling that if
some other actress played the role
and were to give a performance
equal to that of Jerome Kilty's,

"Dear Love" would be a great
play.
To say that I think "Dear
Love" could be a great play does
not mean that I feel the play has
no other problems besides Myrna
Loy's less than superior acting. A
very noticeable one is the extent
to which the play deals with
Elizabeth Barrett's pretend dog
Flush. Biting Robert Browning
once is cute, twice somewhat
unnecessary. The Kidnapping of
Hush gives depth to the character
of Elizabeth Barrett; however, I'm
not at all sure the it adds to the
play. Probably the kidnapping (or
more properly, dognapping)
wouldn't bother me if Flush's
hostility for Mr. Browning hadn't
been doted upon in earlier parts
of the play.
Well, the play ends Saturday,
October 31. It's playing at the
(leary Theatre. See what you
think.
