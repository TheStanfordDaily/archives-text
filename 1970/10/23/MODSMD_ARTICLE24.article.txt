# Diversity, Continuity In Art Exhibit
## 
### ROBBIE FARB 
In a one-man show at the
Stanford Art Gallery, Professor
Matt kahn displays diversity of
theme with a continuity of style.
Using the media of "relief"
weaving and paint, Professor Kahn
creates the wholeness of the
artist's vision in his exhibit which
includes social commentaries,
religious interpretations, and
whimsical notion. The paintings
are not designs for the tapestries,
Kahn emphasizes, but "they do
react to one another and serve as a
whole and continuing statement."
Kahn's style is both abstract
and classical. In an interview, he
confessed to frequent use of his
camera in searching for natural
forms, digging for new imagery.
The circle appears often in his
works, for the artist sees that
symbol everywhere in nature. For
Kahn, it is the common
denominator which can embody
both toylike fantasy, as illustrated
by his paingint "Sucker," as well
as skeletal grimness, as depicted in
"Dead Ahead."
Kahn retains an emphasis on
drawing, resulting in his sparing
use of color. His choice of color is
intuitive rather than arbitrary.
The intense red wings of the
"Herald," for example,
deliberately convey a regal vision
of strength. His works incorporate
a great subtlety, utilizing line and
color to create a personal vision,
by way of suggestion, for the
spectator encountering Kahn's
abstractions.
Kahn's work is classical in
terms of its simplicity as well as
its balance. In the mode of
asceticism, he restricts his
symbolic language to the basic
forms: circle, square, rectangle,
and triangle. But diversity, rather
than the expected monotony
result. The juxtaposition of
"Banner One," "Banner Two,"
and "Effigy," for example,
demonstrates the delicate balance
of line and color, reminescent of
Piet Mondrian, which Kahn has
achieved.
Although there is some
carry-over of linear techniques
into tapestry work, Kahn
emphasizes the distinctive raised
sculptural qualities of "relief"
weaving. The compelling symbolic
impact of tapestries such as

"Avanti" and "Burning Bush" is
achieved by the reinforcement of
color gradations with the
gradations of the plane. In
Seurat-like fashion, dark colors
gradually merge into lighter ones
with corresponding changes in thf
height of the wool-pile. The result
is an exciting tactile richness
which viewers cannot resist. Much
to the dismay of Professor Kahn,
hands of spectators inevitably
reach out to stroke the tapestry
surface.
In contrast to his tapestries,
Kahn's paintings, done in mixed
media on watercolor paper, have
more than a decorative purpose.
The painting media offers more of
a personal satisfaction to the artist
bacause, unlike the slow and
costly art of weaving, it allows
immediate results. Some of
Kahn's works — "Mace," "Dead
Ahead," and "Vigilanti"—express
a fear of authority, its threat of
violence, the dangers of an
approaching 198 4. In "Oracle,"
the double image of a menorah
suggests a wary mood oi propnecy
coupled with a religious
mysticism, according to Kahn. A
note of gaiety is interjected,
however, by works such as
"M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E."
Kahn is far from being
one-dimensional in his appeal. His
abstract technique permits great
freedom of interpretation.
Whether or not one notes, for
example, an ironic touch in the
identical figures of the "Three
Wise Men" who, through black
button eyes, peak at the world
from a sharply narrowed field of
vision, one can still appreciate the
aesthetic merits of the painting.
The artist's vision is sure to inspire
flights of fancy in the imaginative
mind of the most casual onlooker.
The Matt Kahn Show will be
on exhibit in the Stanford Art
Gallery through November 1. The
gallery is open daily except
Mondays.

religious interpretations, and
whimsical notion. The paintings
are not designs for the tapestries,
Kahn emphasizes, but "they do
react to one another and serve as a
whole and continuing statement."
Kahn's style is both abstract
and classical. In an interview, he
confessed to frequent use of his
camera in searching for natural
forms, digging for new imagery.
The circle appears often in his
works, for the artist sees that
symbol everywhere in nature. For
Kahn, it is the common
denominator which can embody
both toylike fantasy, as illustrated
by his paingint "Sucker," as well
as skeletal grimness, as depicted in
"Dead Ahead."
Kahn retains an emphasis on
drawing, resulting in his sparing
use of color. His choice of color is
intuitive rather than arbitrary.
The intense red wings of the
"Herald," for example,
deliberately convey a regal vision
of strength. His works incorporate
a great subtlety, utilizing line and
color to create a personal vision,
by way of suggestion, for the
spectator encountering Kahn's
abstractions.
Kahn's work is classical in
terms of its simplicity as well as
its balance. In the mode of
asceticism, he restricts his
symbolic language to the basic
forms: circle, square, rectangle,
and triangle. But diversity, rather
than the expected monotony
result. The juxtaposition of
"Banner One," "Banner Two,"
and "Effigy," for example,
demonstrates the delicate balance
of line and color, reminescent of
Piet Mondrian, which Kahn has
achieved.
Although there is some
carry-over of linear techniques
into tapestry work, Kahn
emphasizes the distinctive raised
sculptural qualities of "relief"
weaving. The compelling symbolic
impact of tapestries such as

"Avanti" and "Burning Bush" is
achieved by the reinforcement of
color gradations with the
gradations of the plane. In
Seurat-like fashion, dark colors
gradually merge into lighter ones
with corresponding changes in thf
height of the wool-pile. The result
is an exciting tactile richness
which viewers cannot resist. Much
to the dismay of Professor Kahn,
hands of spectators inevitably
reach out to stroke the tapestry
surface.
In contrast to his tapestries,
Kahn's paintings, done in mixed
media on watercolor paper, have
more than a decorative purpose.
The painting media offers more of
a personal satisfaction to the artist
bacause, unlike the slow and
costly art of weaving, it allows
immediate results. Some of
Kahn's works — "Mace," "Dead
Ahead," and "Vigilanti"—express
a fear of authority, its threat of
violence, the dangers of an
approaching 198 4. In "Oracle,"
the double image of a menorah
suggests a wary mood oi propnecy
coupled with a religious
mysticism, according to Kahn. A
note of gaiety is interjected,
however, by works such as
"M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E."
Kahn is far from being
one-dimensional in his appeal. His
abstract technique permits great
freedom of interpretation.
Whether or not one notes, for
example, an ironic touch in the
identical figures of the "Three
Wise Men" who, through black
button eyes, peak at the world
from a sharply narrowed field of
vision, one can still appreciate the
aesthetic merits of the painting.
The artist's vision is sure to inspire
flights of fancy in the imaginative
mind of the most casual onlooker.
The Matt Kahn Show will be
on exhibit in the Stanford Art
Gallery through November 1. The
gallery is open daily except
Mondays.


"Dead Ahead" Matt Kahn
In a one-man show at the
