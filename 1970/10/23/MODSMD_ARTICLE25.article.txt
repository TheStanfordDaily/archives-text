# Marijuana Maniac's Guide To The Garden Of Grass
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
A Child's Garden of Grass or
The Official Handbook for
Marijuana Users is certainly not
the most important book to be
published this year. However it is
good for a few laughs if you've
got a couple of hours and
ninety-five cents to blow. It's also
good if you have to read a book
for your speed reading course,
which is why I read it.
Written by Jack S. Margolis
and Richard Clorfene of Canter's
Delicatessen in Hollywood, the
book humorously treats just
about every aspect of grass, from
how it feels to be stoned to games
to play when you're stoned. One
such game is "Bridges," in which a
person tries to name all the
bridges he can think of. As the
book points out, "The main
advantage of this game is that it's
over quickly."
For when you're really out of
it, the book suggests much simpler
games, such as the old favorite,
"Try-and-find-your-foot."
The authors claim to have
never tried marijuana, and that
they know all they learned from
their friend, Ernie Lundquist.*
Yet the authors' description of
what it feels like to be stoned is so
exact that you almost feel stoned
reading the book. This is
especially true if you're having a
joint after each chapter.
However this soon results in
your deciding either that the book

is so terribly funny that the best
thing you can do is tear out the
pages five at a time and eat them,
or else that going to get something
to eat is a better idea than reading
this silly book.
The book goes on to describe
the "Holy Three," the three best
things to do while stoned: eating,
listening to music, and making
love. The book describes the
munchies perfectly, finally raising
the often asked question, "By the
way, has anyone else noticed how
difficult it is to find a good
Icelandic restaurant these days?"
One will also marvel at how
accurately listening to music when
you're stoned is described.
As for making love, most of us
at Stanford will just have to take
their word as to what it's like.
The book deals with many
metaphysical problems, such as
man's eternal quest for the
answers to two questions: "What
is the meaning and purpose of
life?" and "Where can I get a good
aphrodisiac?"
Yet the book also has many
practical aspects, such as how to
roll a joint and where you can get
a good aphrodisiac. For those
whose joints look like mine do
(friends refer to my joints as
Acapulco Edsels) and those who
have my looks, these practical
aspects may be particularly useful.
One question which keeps
recurring to the Stanford student
as he reads this book is the

question which occurred to the
man who was reading
pornography in a brothel. Why
read about it when you could just
as easily be doing it? The answer
of course is that if you're reading
it for a speed reading course it's
pretty hard to get a
words-read-per-minute count out
of simply being wrecked.
The main point of view of the
book, if it has one, is that
marijuana smoking is fun, no great
revelation, and that the only
danger from marijuana smoking is
getting busted.
*1 have never tried grass either
or even read this book for that
matter, but my friend Harvey
Sparhawk told me all about both.
