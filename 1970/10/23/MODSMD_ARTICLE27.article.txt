# The 						Big Ones Just Keep Coming

Remember the close ones.'
Those heart-stoppers with last
minute heroice deciding the
game? Last year Stanford was
involved in more than one. Three
that come to mind are USC,
Purdue and UCLA. Unfortunately
the first two ended in losses while
the third was a tie.
Saturday night Stanford gets a
chance to avenge that 20-20 tie.
And this time it will be against a

UCLA team that seems intent on
duplicating Stanford's last minute
decisions of last year.
After expected wins over
Oregon State, Pittsburgh and
Northwestern, UCLA took on
second ranked Texas in Austin.
They almost shocked the
defending national champs and
lead 17-13 in the fourth quarter.
But with only 1 2 seconds left
in the game, Texas came up with a
4 5 yard touchdown pass to win
20-17.'

'Then against Oregon, UCLA
lead 4 0-21 with 4 :32 left to play.
But 2 9 and 4 0 yard touchdown
passes cut it to 10-35. And then
with 30 seconds left, a 15 yard
TD pass gave Oregon a remarkable
41-40 victo.*/.
Finally juit J week ago, UCLA
and Cal were involved in one of
the most controversial games in
football history. With less than
four minutes left, Cal lead 21-lh
and had possession. After a punt
the Bruins took over and started a
long drive.
Close Call
Two controversial pass
interference calls made under the
new bump and run provision gave
UCLA the ball deep in Cal
territory with time running out.
As the final seconds ticked off,
Bruin quarterback Dennis
Dummit rolled out from the three
yard line and headed for the goal
line flag.
Although films show that he
touched his knee on the two yard
line he was still given the
touchdown and the game, with
four seconds on the scoreboard.
It will be hard for Saturday's
game to equal these last minute
heroics. Still the last time
Stanford played in the Coliseum,
they were involved in a game
which outdid any of UCLA's past
three.
And last year's loss to USC was
another in a long line of losses
suffered by Stanford in the Los
Angeles Coliseum. Not since a
1962, 17-7 win over UCLA have
the Cards won there.
But this appears to be the year
in which Stanford breaks its
jinxes. Both the USC and the
"Curse of the Palouse" jinxes have
been destroyed in consecutive
weekend. Hopefully Saturday will
mark a third such event in a row.
Bruins Ail
Two months ago, Stanford
would've been highly favored over
a UCLA team hit hard by
graduation. Gone were such
standouts as running back Greg

Jones and receivers George
Farmer, Gwen Cooper and Mike
Garratt. On defense All-Coast
linebacker Mike Ballou and
all-coast tackle Floyd Reese were
gone.
Add to this the loss of
All-Coast tailback Mickey
Cureton, who suffered a freak
neck injury, and veteran defensive
back Danny Graham, who is now
playing pro baseball, and it's
obvious they had a lot ot
problems to overcome.
But Coach Tommy Pro thro has
overcome a lot of problems in his
fifteen years of coaching and he
appears to have done so again.
Even with their lost, last second
to Texas and Oregon, the Bruins
are ranked 1 6 th in the nation and
have a 4 -2 record.
Leading their offense is last
year's most valuable player,
quarterback Dennis Dummit. So
far this season lie has hit on 99 of
198 passes for 1 395 yards, and
with five games left he should
surpass his 1 969 total of 19 63
yard passing.
Good Balance
So far the big surprise for
UCLA has been the performance
of their running backs. Led by
senior halfback Arthur Sims' 4 08
yards, the Bruins have piled up
1 096 yards on the ground; a good
total considering their
pass-oriented offense.
On defense, the UCLAns
appear to be strongest in their
secondary, an area very vital
against the Indians. Veterans Ron
Carver and Doug Huff lead a good
defensive backfield. And
linebackers Greg Snyder, and Bob
Pifferini are also tough. Against
Cal, Pifferini accounted for 13
tackles despite being slowed by a
pulled muscle.
As the season progresses, the
injury list has mounted for
Stanford. Two reserves, defensive
guard Tim McLure and defensive
back Mark Brown were operated
on for knee injuries this week and
are out for the year. Defensive
back Mike Ewing and split end

Jack Lasater continue to be
question marks.
Three more Indians starters,
Pete Lazetich, Mike Simone and
Demed Washington have also been
slowed but will start. For UCLA,
Pifferini and flanker Brad Lyman

appear to be the only major
problems, but both should play.
It should be another great one.
The combination of the Coliseum,
nightime, 80,000 fans and two
fine teams always makes for
excitement. And with the inside

track to the Rose Bowl going to
the winner, both teams will be
ready.
And anyone who was there a
year ago knows it won't be over
until the clock reads 0 :00. Or will
it even then?

REMEMBER STEVE? A year ago this week Steve Horowitz kicked one field goal against UCLA and had
another—no fault of his-blocked as the game ended. Above he gets one off against Washington State for
Stanford's first three of 63 points. He could be in the pressure cooker against hte Bruins again tomorrow
night. That's Steve Murray holding.

in which Stanford breaks its
jinxes. Both the USC and the
"Curse of the Palouse" jinxes have
been destroyed in consecutive
weekend. Hopefully Saturday will
mark a third such event in a row.
Bruins Ail
Two months ago, Stanford
would've been highly favored over
a UCLA team hit hard by
graduation. Gone were such
standouts as running back Greg

Jones and receivers George
Farmer, Gwen Cooper and Mike
Garratt. On defense All-Coast
linebacker Mike Ballou and
all-coast tackle Floyd Reese were
gone.
Add to this the loss of
All-Coast tailback Mickey
Cureton, who suffered a freak
neck injury, and veteran defensive
back Danny Graham, who is now
playing pro baseball, and it's
obvious they had a lot ot
problems to overcome.
But Coach Tommy Pro thro has
overcome a lot of problems in his
fifteen years of coaching and he
appears to have done so again.
Even with their lost, last second
to Texas and Oregon, the Bruins
are ranked 1 6 th in the nation and
have a 4 -2 record.
Leading their offense is last
year's most valuable player,
quarterback Dennis Dummit. So
far this season lie has hit on 99 of
198 passes for 1 395 yards, and
with five games left he should
surpass his 1 969 total of 19 63
yard passing.
Good Balance
So far the big surprise for
UCLA has been the performance
of their running backs. Led by
senior halfback Arthur Sims' 4 08
yards, the Bruins have piled up
1 096 yards on the ground; a good
total considering their
pass-oriented offense.
On defense, the UCLAns
appear to be strongest in their
secondary, an area very vital
against the Indians. Veterans Ron
Carver and Doug Huff lead a good
defensive backfield. And
linebackers Greg Snyder, and Bob
Pifferini are also tough. Against
Cal, Pifferini accounted for 13
tackles despite being slowed by a
pulled muscle.
As the season progresses, the
injury list has mounted for
Stanford. Two reserves, defensive
guard Tim McLure and defensive
back Mark Brown were operated
on for knee injuries this week and
are out for the year. Defensive
back Mike Ewing and split end

Jack Lasater continue to be
question marks.
Three more Indians starters,
Pete Lazetich, Mike Simone and
Demed Washington have also been
slowed but will start. For UCLA,
Pifferini and flanker Brad Lyman

appear to be the only major
problems, but both should play.
It should be another great one.
The combination of the Coliseum,
nightime, 80,000 fans and two
fine teams always makes for
excitement. And with the inside

track to the Rose Bowl going to
the winner, both teams will be
ready.
And anyone who was there a
year ago knows it won't be over
until the clock reads 0 :00. Or will
it even then?

REMEMBER STEVE? A year ago this week Steve Horowitz kicked one field goal against UCLA and had
another—no fault of his-blocked as the game ended. Above he gets one off against Washington State for
Stanford's first three of 63 points. He could be in the pressure cooker against hte Bruins again tomorrow
night. That's Steve Murray holding.
Remember the close ones.'
Those heart-stoppers with last
minute heroice deciding the
game? Last year Stanford was
involved in more than one. Three
that come to mind are USC,
Purdue and UCLA. Unfortunately
the first two ended in losses while
the third was a tie.
Saturday night Stanford gets a
chance to avenge that 20-20 tie.
And this time it will be against a

UCLA team that seems intent on
duplicating Stanford's last minute
decisions of last year.
After expected wins over
Oregon State, Pittsburgh and
Northwestern, UCLA took on
second ranked Texas in Austin.
They almost shocked the
defending national champs and
lead 17-13 in the fourth quarter.
But with only 1 2 seconds left
in the game, Texas came up with a
4 5 yard touchdown pass to win
20-17.'

'Then against Oregon, UCLA
lead 4 0-21 with 4 :32 left to play.
But 2 9 and 4 0 yard touchdown
passes cut it to 10-35. And then
with 30 seconds left, a 15 yard
TD pass gave Oregon a remarkable
41-40 victo.*/.
Finally juit J week ago, UCLA
and Cal were involved in one of
the most controversial games in
football history. With less than
four minutes left, Cal lead 21-lh
and had possession. After a punt
the Bruins took over and started a
long drive.
Close Call
Two controversial pass
interference calls made under the
new bump and run provision gave
UCLA the ball deep in Cal
territory with time running out.
As the final seconds ticked off,
Bruin quarterback Dennis
Dummit rolled out from the three
yard line and headed for the goal
line flag.
Although films show that he
touched his knee on the two yard
line he was still given the
touchdown and the game, with
four seconds on the scoreboard.
It will be hard for Saturday's
game to equal these last minute
heroics. Still the last time
Stanford played in the Coliseum,
they were involved in a game
which outdid any of UCLA's past
three.
And last year's loss to USC was
another in a long line of losses
suffered by Stanford in the Los
Angeles Coliseum. Not since a
1962, 17-7 win over UCLA have
the Cards won there.
But this appears to be the year
in which Stanford breaks its

Pifferini and flanker Brad Lyman

appear to be the only major
problems, but both should play.
It should be another great one.
The combination of the Coliseum,
nightime, 80,000 fans and two
fine teams always makes for
excitement. And with the inside

track to the Rose Bowl going to
the winner, both teams will be
ready.
And anyone who was there a
year ago knows it won't be over
until the clock reads 0 :00. Or will
it even then?

REMEMBER STEVE? A year ago this week Steve Horowitz kicked one field goal against UCLA and had
another—no fault of his-blocked as the game ended. Above he gets one off against Washington State for
Stanford's first three of 63 points. He could be in the pressure cooker against hte Bruins again tomorrow
night. That's Steve Murray holding.
Remember the close ones.'
Those heart-stoppers with last
minute heroice deciding the
game? Last year Stanford was
involved in more than one. Three
that come to mind are USC,
Purdue and UCLA. Unfortunately
the first two ended in losses while
the third was a tie.
Saturday night Stanford gets a
chance to avenge that 20-20 tie.
And this time it will be against a

UCLA team that seems intent on
duplicating Stanford's last minute
decisions of last year.
After expected wins over
Oregon State, Pittsburgh and
Northwestern, UCLA took on
second ranked Texas in Austin.
They almost shocked the
defending national champs and
lead 17-13 in the fourth quarter.
But with only 1 2 seconds left
in the game, Texas came up with a
4 5 yard touchdown pass to win
20-17.'

'Then against Oregon, UCLA
lead 4 0-21 with 4 :32 left to play.
But 2 9 and 4 0 yard touchdown
passes cut it to 10-35. And then
with 30 seconds left, a 15 yard
TD pass gave Oregon a remarkable
41-40 victo.*/.
Finally juit J week ago, UCLA
and Cal were involved in one of
the most controversial games in
football history. With less than
four minutes left, Cal lead 21-lh
and had possession. After a punt
the Bruins took over and started a
long drive.
Close Call
Two controversial pass
interference calls made under the
new bump and run provision gave
UCLA the ball deep in Cal
territory with time running out.
As the final seconds ticked off,
Bruin quarterback Dennis
Dummit rolled out from the three
yard line and headed for the goal
line flag.
Although films show that he
touched his knee on the two yard
line he was still given the
touchdown and the game, with
four seconds on the scoreboard.
It will be hard for Saturday's
game to equal these last minute
heroics. Still the last time
Stanford played in the Coliseum,
they were involved in a game
which outdid any of UCLA's past
three.
And last year's loss to USC was
another in a long line of losses
suffered by Stanford in the Los
Angeles Coliseum. Not since a
1962, 17-7 win over UCLA have
the Cards won there.
But this appears to be the year
in which Stanford breaks its
jinxes. Both the USC and the
"Curse of the Palouse" jinxes have
been destroyed in consecutive
weekend. Hopefully Saturday will
mark a third such event in a row.
Bruins Ail
Two months ago, Stanford
would've been highly favored over
a UCLA team hit hard by
graduation. Gone were such
standouts as running back Greg

Jones and receivers George
Farmer, Gwen Cooper and Mike
Garratt. On defense All-Coast
linebacker Mike Ballou and
all-coast tackle Floyd Reese were
gone.
Add to this the loss of
All-Coast tailback Mickey
Cureton, who suffered a freak
neck injury, and veteran defensive
back Danny Graham, who is now
playing pro baseball, and it's
obvious they had a lot ot
problems to overcome.
But Coach Tommy Pro thro has
overcome a lot of problems in his
fifteen years of coaching and he
appears to have done so again.
Even with their lost, last second
to Texas and Oregon, the Bruins
are ranked 1 6 th in the nation and
have a 4 -2 record.
Leading their offense is last
year's most valuable player,
quarterback Dennis Dummit. So
far this season lie has hit on 99 of
198 passes for 1 395 yards, and
with five games left he should
surpass his 1 969 total of 19 63
yard passing.
Good Balance
So far the big surprise for
UCLA has been the performance
of their running backs. Led by
senior halfback Arthur Sims' 4 08
yards, the Bruins have piled up
1 096 yards on the ground; a good
total considering their
pass-oriented offense.
On defense, the UCLAns
appear to be strongest in their
secondary, an area very vital
against the Indians. Veterans Ron
Carver and Doug Huff lead a good
defensive backfield. And
linebackers Greg Snyder, and Bob
Pifferini are also tough. Against
Cal, Pifferini accounted for 13
tackles despite being slowed by a
pulled muscle.
As the season progresses, the
injury list has mounted for
Stanford. Two reserves, defensive
guard Tim McLure and defensive
back Mark Brown were operated
on for knee injuries this week and
are out for the year. Defensive
back Mike Ewing and split end

Jack Lasater continue to be
question marks.
Three more Indians starters,
Pete Lazetich, Mike Simone and
Demed Washington have also been
slowed but will start. For UCLA,
Pifferini and flanker Brad Lyman

appear to be the only major
problems, but both should play.
It should be another great one.
