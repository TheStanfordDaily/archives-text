## Icemen Lose Opener 
### 
The Stanford hockey team lost
its opening game of the year 8-6
Tuesday night to a
well-coordinated Belmont senior
team. The game was marred by
officiating that was questionable
at best and several scuffles, one of
which resulted in a fight.
The Card pucksters jumped to
an early 1-0 lead as Rick Jaros
scored after taking a pass from
Tom Bedford. But Belmont came
back and tallied three times to
make the score 3-1 at the end of
the first period.
Stanford held its own in the
second frame as each team scored
twice. The second line of Dave
McCaffery, Rich Jaros, and Tom
Bedford scored their second goal
of the evening and freshman Willy
McLivaine scored on a rebound.
However, the Indian defense was
obviously suffering from a lack of
experience.
In the third period the game

blew wide open as Will McLivainp
added his second goal on a fine
shot into the upper right hand
corner. After another Belmont
score, player-coach-captain Pat
Leonard knocked in a loose puck
to close the gap to one at 6-5.
Belmont then tallied on a
disputed goal.
As the final buzzer drew near it
looked as though Belmont would
win. But with only 29 seconds left
in the game the Indians were
awarded a penalty shot. Rich
Jaros made good, and Stanford
trailed 7-6. In a strategic move
coach Pat Leonard removed goalie

Rick Bragden who had turned in
an excellent performance in the
nets.
But, the move backfired as the
Belmont team scored on an empty
goal.
Although coming out on the
short end of a close game, the
team is not playing as well as it did
at the close of last season. This
year's team has better depth than
previously, but players are still
needed badly. Anyone interested
in playing or managing should call
Chris Counihan at 491 -31 22 .
Practices are at 10 p.m. Sunday
nights. Rides can be arranged.
