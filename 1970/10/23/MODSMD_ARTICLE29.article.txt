## Jinxes And Such 
### Fred Leeson 
"The Los Angeles Coliseum has been a lonely
place over years," John Ralston told his players
last week after their win in Spokane.
If you're up on these kinds of things you don't
need to be reminded that John Ralston has never
beaten UCLA through his first seven years at
Stanford. Or that he has never won a game in the
Coliseum, either.
All that, of course, is just additional spice for
another critical game in Stanford's quest for the
Rose Bowl and it undoubtedly means little to the
game itself.

But while on the subject there may—repeat,
may—be another condiment worth tossing in: the
possibility that John Ralston would particularly
relish beating Tom Prothro.
There are those who know the coach who say,
as one put it, he has "a sort of personal vendetta"
against Prothro.
Another, in more conservative language,
suggests "there's no love lost between Coach
Ralston and Prothro, although you'd never get him
to say it."
The second part, anyway, seems to be accurate.
Would Ralston consider a win over UCLA to be
all the more satisfying because it would be a win
over Tom He met the question the other
day with a pause.
"No, not at all. Just UCLA. Tom Prothro is a
fine fellow."
Tom Prothro, you may remember, is familiar
with controversy, although his last couple years
have been more calm than some earlier ones.
He left Oregon State in 1965 after taking the
Beavers to the Rose Bowl, joined UCLA and took
the Bruins to Pasadena in 1 966.
During the '66 season he was accused of wiring
(lary Be ban's helmet with electronic devices so
that plays could be transmittal to his quater
back in an intersectional game. Then after the
Stanford game in Palo Alto the same year, a
photographer sold a series of pictures to a national

publication which rather convincingly made
Prothro's assistants look as if they were using and
arm signals to call plays, which isn't legal.
Bag Of Tricks
Prothro reportedly spends a lot of time
thinking up freak plays and ways to surprise his
opposition, and some have wondered if that
controversial play against Cal last week on which
Dennis Dummit scored after his knee had
apparently hit the ground wasn't another Prothro
special planned in advance and carried to the field
nestled in his black briefcase.
"I take chances only when I'm the underdog,"
he said a few years ago, which probably should be
noted by the indians as they take their nine point
favoring into the Coliseum.
"He's apt to do anything in a football game,"
Ralston said the other day.
Weekly Reading
Prothro has spent the week saying that his
Bruins won't blitz Plunkett, that he's worried
about his bad pass defense, that he's more worried
about Stanford than he was about Texas when he
faced the then top-ranked Longhorns.
"He'll say anything during the week," Ralston
noted.
What he really means won't be known until the
game is on.
Another interesting dimension to the game is
that Dick Vermeil, former assistant coach under
Ralston, is now an assistant at UCLA. He left two
years ago to work for the Los Angeles Rams and
showed up this season at Westwood.
"He worked with Plunkett and Moore and that
group," Ralston said, "so he's pretty familiar with
the way we block."
Meanwhile, there are those jinxes. Two weeks
ago the Indians hadn't beaten USC in l.'l years.
Last week the Indians hadn't beaten Washington
State at home in 14 years. This week Ralston has
never won in I he Coliseum or beaten UCLA.
"A (bird one in a row would be nice," he said.

opposition, and some have wondered if that
controversial play against Cal last week on which
Dennis Dummit scored after his knee had
apparently hit the ground wasn't another Prothro
special planned in advance and carried to the field
nestled in his black briefcase.
"I take chances only when I'm the underdog,"
he said a few years ago, which probably should be
noted by the indians as they take their nine point
favoring into the Coliseum.
"He's apt to do anything in a football game,"
Ralston said the other day.
Weekly Reading
Prothro has spent the week saying that his
Bruins won't blitz Plunkett, that he's worried
about his bad pass defense, that he's more worried
about Stanford than he was about Texas when he
faced the then top-ranked Longhorns.
"He'll say anything during the week," Ralston
noted.
What he really means won't be known until the
game is on.
Another interesting dimension to the game is
that Dick Vermeil, former assistant coach under
Ralston, is now an assistant at UCLA. He left two
years ago to work for the Los Angeles Rams and
showed up this season at Westwood.
"He worked with Plunkett and Moore and that
group," Ralston said, "so he's pretty familiar with
the way we block."
Meanwhile, there are those jinxes. Two weeks
ago the Indians hadn't beaten USC in l.'l years.
Last week the Indians hadn't beaten Washington
State at home in 14 years. This week Ralston has
never won in I he Coliseum or beaten UCLA.
"A (bird one in a row would be nice," he said.
"The Los Angeles Coliseum has been a lonely
place over years," John Ralston told his players
last week after their win in Spokane.
If you're up on these kinds of things you don't
need to be reminded that John Ralston has never
beaten UCLA through his first seven years at
Stanford. Or that he has never won a game in the
Coliseum, either.
All that, of course, is just additional spice for
another critical game in Stanford's quest for the
Rose Bowl and it undoubtedly means little to the
game itself.

But while on the subject there may—repeat,
may—be another condiment worth tossing in: the
possibility that John Ralston would particularly
relish beating Tom Prothro.
There are those who know the coach who say,
as one put it, he has "a sort of personal vendetta"
against Prothro.
Another, in more conservative language,
suggests "there's no love lost between Coach
Ralston and Prothro, although you'd never get him
to say it."
The second part, anyway, seems to be accurate.
Would Ralston consider a win over UCLA to be
all the more satisfying because it would be a win
over Tom He met the question the other
day with a pause.
"No, not at all. Just UCLA. Tom Prothro is a
fine fellow."
Tom Prothro, you may remember, is familiar
with controversy, although his last couple years
have been more calm than some earlier ones.
He left Oregon State in 1965 after taking the
Beavers to the Rose Bowl, joined UCLA and took
the Bruins to Pasadena in 1 966.
During the '66 season he was accused of wiring
(lary Be ban's helmet with electronic devices so
that plays could be transmittal to his quater
back in an intersectional game. Then after the
Stanford game in Palo Alto the same year, a
photographer sold a series of pictures to a national

publication which rather convincingly made
Prothro's assistants look as if they were using and
arm signals to call plays, which isn't legal.

thinking up freak plays and ways to surprise his
