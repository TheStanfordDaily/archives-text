# Proposed Expressway Meets With Criticism
## 
### BOB LITTRMAN 
A State Highway Department
proposal for Willow Expressway met
widespread criticism at public hearings
yesterday in Palo Alto. The proposed
expressway would run from the
Dumbarton Bridge to Sand Mill Road
through Palo Alto, Stanford, and Menlo
Park, and would require the demolition
of 433 residential units.
The hearings, at the Community
Center, drew a crowd of more than
200, almost all of whom were
homeowners and tenants who will be
displaced if the expressway is built.
Nearly all of the speakers during the
three hours of public discussion
opposed the proposal. Reasons given
generally fell into the following five
catagories: the expressway is not
needed, it will stimulate
overdevelopment and crowding, it will
worsen the area's housing crisis, it will
destroy the beauty and tranquility of
San Francisquito Creek, and it
threatens the environment with air and
noise pollution.
The expressway proposal is a
revision of a route «iH' pted in 19fi?

the Willow Freeway. The freeway plan
was never acted upon due to opposition
from Menlo Park.
Agreement with the new proposal
was expressed by representatives of
Menlo Park and the Menlo Park
Chamber of Commerce. Support also
came from Palo Alto City Councilman
Frank Gallagher and Stanford Real
Estate Manager Boyd Smith. Both
warned, however, that construction
should not begin until all affected
residents have been satisfactorily
relocated.
Opposition groups included local
housing, ecology, conservation, senior
citizens, tenants union, and
neighborhood organizations. League of
Women Voters President Dorothy
(ireen said, "There is already a shortage
of low and moderate income housing in
Palo Alto. It is estimated that a family
would need an annual income of at
U-ast $15,00(1 in order to find adequate
housing in the area. The coming of the
expressway would seem inevitable to
confound every aspect of the
problem."
