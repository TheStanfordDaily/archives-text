# Proposed Expressway Meets With Criticism
## 
### BOB LITTRMAN 
A State Highway Department
proposal for Willow Expressway met
widespread criticism at public hearings
yesterday in Palo Alto. The proposed
expressway would run from the
Dumbarton Bridge to Sand Mill Road
through Palo Alto, Stanford, and Menlo
Park, and would require the demolition
of 433 residential units.
The hearings, at the Community
Center, drew a crowd of more than
200, almost all of whom were
homeowners and tenants who will be
displaced if the expressway is built.
Nearly all of the speakers during the
three hours of public discussion
opposed the proposal. Reasons given
generally fell into the following five
catagories: the expressway is not
needed, it will stimulate
overdevelopment and crowding, it will
worsen the area's housing crisis, it will
destroy the beauty and tranquility of
San Francisquito Creek, and it
threatens the environment with air and
noise pollution.
The expressway proposal is a
revision of a route «iH' pted in 19fi?

the Willow Freeway. The freeway plan
was never acted upon due to opposition
from Menlo Park.
Agreement with the new proposal
was expressed by representatives of
Menlo Park and the Menlo Park
Chamber of Commerce. Support also
came from Palo Alto City Councilman
Frank Gallagher and Stanford Real
Estate Manager Boyd Smith. Both
warned, however, that construction
should not begin until all affected
residents have been satisfactorily
relocated.
Opposition groups included local
housing, ecology, conservation, senior
citizens, tenants union, and
neighborhood organizations. League of
Women Voters President Dorothy
(ireen said, "There is already a shortage
of low and moderate income housing in
Palo Alto. It is estimated that a family
would need an annual income of at
U-ast $15,00(1 in order to find adequate
housing in the area. The coming of the
expressway would seem inevitable to
confound every aspect of the
problem."
Ida Morris, representing the Willow
Road Neighborhood Group, said: "We
feel that the expressway will only
increase the overdevelopment of the
Midpeninsula and particularly of Menlo
Park. We think that it is being built for
the convenience of business and
industry, not fur the use of people of
Menlo Park."
Janet Owens, speaking for the
Mic peninsula Citizens for Fair Housing
said, "We recommend that construction
should be stopped until the housing
vacancy rate is up to five to seven
percent." Presently the vacancy rate in
Palo Alto is variously estimated from
two percent to less than one percent.

Steven Sowards of the Stanford
Conservation Group called the Willow
Expressway a waste of millions of
dollars toward "a 195 o's vision of
transportation solutions." He said the
expressway would bankrupt University
plans for low and moderate income
housing.
Citizens also expressed an interest in
continuing the hearings at night when
more of the residents who would be
displaced could attend. The highway
department spokesman at first objected
that it would take 30 days to schedule
another meeting, but later agreed that
he would try to do so as soon as
possible.

Palo Alto. It is estimated that a family
would need an annual income of at
U-ast $15,00(1 in order to find adequate
housing in the area. The coming of the
expressway would seem inevitable to
confound every aspect of the
problem."
Ida Morris, representing the Willow
Road Neighborhood Group, said: "We
feel that the expressway will only
increase the overdevelopment of the
Midpeninsula and particularly of Menlo
Park. We think that it is being built for
the convenience of business and
industry, not fur the use of people of
Menlo Park."
Janet Owens, speaking for the
Mic peninsula Citizens for Fair Housing
said, "We recommend that construction
should be stopped until the housing
vacancy rate is up to five to seven
percent." Presently the vacancy rate in
Palo Alto is variously estimated from
two percent to less than one percent.

Steven Sowards of the Stanford
Conservation Group called the Willow
Expressway a waste of millions of
dollars toward "a 195 o's vision of
transportation solutions." He said the
expressway would bankrupt University
plans for low and moderate income
housing.
Citizens also expressed an interest in
continuing the hearings at night when
more of the residents who would be
displaced could attend. The highway
department spokesman at first objected
that it would take 30 days to schedule
another meeting, but later agreed that
he would try to do so as soon as
possible.

'RIGHT ON—The Radical Tour of Stanford prowled the campus night. The tour,
which began at the Old Union courtyard, visited scenes of revolutionary interest
around campus, including Hoover Library, Encina Hall, the ROTC building, the
Biz School, the President's office, research labs, Aero & Astro building, and the
DAILY office.
A State Highway Department
proposal for Willow Expressway met
widespread criticism at public hearings
yesterday in Palo Alto. The proposed
expressway would run from the
Dumbarton Bridge to Sand Mill Road
through Palo Alto, Stanford, and Menlo
Park, and would require the demolition
of 433 residential units.
The hearings, at the Community
Center, drew a crowd of more than
200, almost all of whom were
homeowners and tenants who will be
displaced if the expressway is built.
Nearly all of the speakers during the
three hours of public discussion
opposed the proposal. Reasons given
generally fell into the following five
catagories: the expressway is not
needed, it will stimulate
overdevelopment and crowding, it will
worsen the area's housing crisis, it will
destroy the beauty and tranquility of
San Francisquito Creek, and it
threatens the environment with air and
noise pollution.
The expressway proposal is a
revision of a route «iH' pted in 19fi?

the Willow Freeway. The freeway plan
was never acted upon due to opposition
from Menlo Park.
Agreement with the new proposal
was expressed by representatives of
Menlo Park and the Menlo Park
Chamber of Commerce. Support also
came from Palo Alto City Councilman
Frank Gallagher and Stanford Real
Estate Manager Boyd Smith. Both
warned, however, that construction
should not begin until all affected
residents have been satisfactorily
relocated.
Opposition groups included local
housing, ecology, conservation, senior
citizens, tenants union, and
neighborhood organizations. League of
Women Voters President Dorothy
(ireen said, "There is already a shortage
of low and moderate income housing in
Palo Alto. It is estimated that a family
would need an annual income of at
U-ast $15,00(1 in order to find adequate
housing in the area. The coming of the
expressway would seem inevitable to
