# Papooses Face Bruins
## Plunkett Slips In Statistics 
### 
How could somebody pass for
224 yards, set a new NCAA
record and drop from second to
eighth in national passing
statistics?
By not staying in long enough
to complete a whole lot of passes,
that's how, and that's what
happened to Jim Plunkett last
week in Spokane.
Jim completed 10 of 1 4 passes
before coming out and as a result
his completion average dropped
from 18 plus to 16.8 passes per
game.
For the first time this season
he's now behind Archie Manning
who holds seventh spot with 1 7
passes per game.
Jim Second
Plunkett remains second in the
nation in total offense, averaging
273.5 yards per game. Bill Craigo
of University of Texas at El Paso
is the leader with a 275.6 mark.
Pacific's John Read leads
completions with 18.3 average.

In team statistics Stanford is
seventh in total offense (460 );
second in forward passing offense
(28 8.5 ); and 10 th in scoring
(33.7).
Other Pacific-8 quarterbacks
gradually ascending in the
compilations are Sonny Sixkiller
of Washington, now third in
forward passing with 18
completions per game and
Oregon's Dan Fouts is 12 th with a
15.2 average.
Oregon leads the country in
passing offense, Stanford is
second, Washington is seventh and
UCLA is ninth.
In team statistics, Jackie
Brown leads rushers with 382
yards and an average of 5 .3 yards
per carry. Hillary Shockley is
second with 305 yards and a 3.6
average.
Plunkett leads total offense
with 1641 yards, 1513 passing
and 128 rushing.
Jackie Brown and Shockley are
tied for the team scoring lead with

36 points on six touchdowns,
followed by Steve Horowitz with
32 points on 20 of 25 PATs and
four of seven field goals.
Randy Vataha leads receivers
with 28 receptions and 486 yards.
Bob Moore is second with 360
yards on 18 catches and Jackie
Brown has caught 20 for 235
yards.
Steve Murray and Phil Satre
lead the club with two pass
interceptions.
Siemon Leads Tacklers
Jeff Siemon leads the defense
with 66 tackles, followed by Ben
Barnes with 46, Larry Butler with
43, Bill Alexander with 38, Pete
Lazetich and Ron Kadziel with
35, Jack Schultz with 33 and Tom
Sones and Charles McCloud with
32.
In another football
development, Coach Bill
Moultrie's freshman football team
enters its first fracas tomorrow at
Westwood against the UCLA
Bru babes.
His starting offensive line-up is
expected to look like this:
Tacles: Reuben Manmouth,
260; Keith Rowen, 234.

Tight end: Barry Shernoch,
210.
Guards: Bruce Blackstone,
210; Steve White, 2-2 5.
Center: Lynn Austin, 245.
Split end: Tom Lasater, 170.
Quarterback: Eric Test, 200 .
Running back: Jim Ferguson,
185.
Fullback: Randy Hankamer,
198.
Flanker: Reggie Ishman, 180.
Split end Lasater is the brother
of varsity split end Jack, and
another frosh player, linebacker
John Snider, is the brother of
former Indian Malcolm Snider
who currently plays for the
Atlanta Falcons.
The Papooses have been hit by
a few injuries including a leg
problem that has hampered
running back John Winesberry.
Coach Multrie, whose squad is
limited to four games and six
weeks worth of workouts, has
been getting assistance from ten
other coaches, mainly former
players and grad students.
He termed his crop of rookies
as one of the best in Stanford
history.
Other freshman games will be
with San Jose State, USC and Cal.


THE DEFENDER—Stanford's talented goalie Peter Gadd, the Tribe's
last line of defense against offensive water polo types (just kidding,
gentlemen), is expected to get a roueh workout as Stanford faces (JSC

and UCLA this weekend in Los Angeles. Both the Bruins and Trojan. l
are perennial national powers, and the Tribe needs to knock them off
to get into the NCAA finals next month.


WE TRY AGAIN—This time, folks, it's Arvid Kretz and Don Kardong
finishing in a tie for first place in last week's cross country race against
USC and San Jose State. They were intended to appear in yesterday's
cross country picture, as avid caption readers will remember, but
those things happen. Kardong, Kretz and the rest .of Stanford's
runners are in Los Angeles this weekend racing against UCLA, which
figures to be a close contest.

In another football
development, Coach Bill
Moultrie's freshman football team
enters its first fracas tomorrow at
Westwood against the UCLA
Bru babes.
His starting offensive line-up is
expected to look like this:
Tacles: Reuben Manmouth,
260; Keith Rowen, 234.

Tight end: Barry Shernoch,
210.
Guards: Bruce Blackstone,
210; Steve White, 2-2 5.

Split end: Tom Lasater, 170.
Quarterback: Eric Test, 200 .
Running back: Jim Ferguson,
185.
Fullback: Randy Hankamer,
198.
Flanker: Reggie Ishman, 180.
Split end Lasater is the brother
of varsity split end Jack, and
another frosh player, linebacker
John Snider, is the brother of
former Indian Malcolm Snider
who currently plays for the
Atlanta Falcons.
The Papooses have been hit by
a few injuries including a leg
problem that has hampered
running back John Winesberry.
Coach Multrie, whose squad is
limited to four games and six
weeks worth of workouts, has
been getting assistance from ten
other coaches, mainly former
players and grad students.
He termed his crop of rookies
as one of the best in Stanford
history.
Other freshman games will be
with San Jose State, USC and Cal.


THE DEFENDER—Stanford's talented goalie Peter Gadd, the Tribe's
last line of defense against offensive water polo types (just kidding,
gentlemen), is expected to get a roueh workout as Stanford faces (JSC

and UCLA this weekend in Los Angeles. Both the Bruins and Trojan. l
are perennial national powers, and the Tribe needs to knock them off
to get into the NCAA finals next month.


WE TRY AGAIN—This time, folks, it's Arvid Kretz and Don Kardong
finishing in a tie for first place in last week's cross country race against
USC and San Jose State. They were intended to appear in yesterday's
cross country picture, as avid caption readers will remember, but
those things happen. Kardong, Kretz and the rest .of Stanford's
runners are in Los Angeles this weekend racing against UCLA, which
figures to be a close contest.
How could somebody pass for
224 yards, set a new NCAA
record and drop from second to
eighth in national passing
statistics?
By not staying in long enough
to complete a whole lot of passes,
that's how, and that's what
happened to Jim Plunkett last
week in Spokane.
Jim completed 10 of 1 4 passes
before coming out and as a result
his completion average dropped
from 18 plus to 16.8 passes per
game.
For the first time this season
he's now behind Archie Manning
who holds seventh spot with 1 7
passes per game.

Plunkett remains second in the
nation in total offense, averaging
273.5 yards per game. Bill Craigo

completions with 18.3 average.

In team statistics Stanford is
seventh in total offense (460 );
second in forward passing offense
(28 8.5 ); and 10 th in scoring
(33.7).
Other Pacific-8 quarterbacks
gradually ascending in the
compilations are Sonny Sixkiller
of Washington, now third in
forward passing with 18
completions per game and
Oregon's Dan Fouts is 12 th with a
15.2 average.

another frosh player, linebacker
John Snider, is the brother of
former Indian Malcolm Snider
who currently plays for the
Atlanta Falcons.
The Papooses have been hit by
a few injuries including a leg
problem that has hampered
running back John Winesberry.

limited to four games and six
weeks worth of workouts, has
been getting assistance from ten
other coaches, mainly former
players and grad students.
He termed his crop of rookies
as one of the best in Stanford
history.
Other freshman games will be
with San Jose State, USC and Cal.


THE DEFENDER—Stanford's talented goalie Peter Gadd, the Tribe's
last line of defense against offensive water polo types (just kidding,
gentlemen), is expected to get a roueh workout as Stanford faces (JSC

and UCLA this weekend in Los Angeles. Both the Bruins and Trojan. l
are perennial national powers, and the Tribe needs to knock them off
to get into the NCAA finals next month.


WE TRY AGAIN—This time, folks, it's Arvid Kretz and Don Kardong
finishing in a tie for first place in last week's cross country race against
USC and San Jose State. They were intended to appear in yesterday's
cross country picture, as avid caption readers will remember, but
those things happen. Kardong, Kretz and the rest .of Stanford's
runners are in Los Angeles this weekend racing against UCLA, which
figures to be a close contest.
How could somebody pass for
224 yards, set a new NCAA
record and drop from second to
eighth in national passing
statistics?
By not staying in long enough
to complete a whole lot of passes,
that's how, and that's what
happened to Jim Plunkett last
week in Spokane.
Jim completed 10 of 1 4 passes
before coming out and as a result
his completion average dropped
from 18 plus to 16.8 passes per
game.
For the first time this season
he's now behind Archie Manning
who holds seventh spot with 1 7
passes per game.
Jim Second
Plunkett remains second in the
nation in total offense, averaging
273.5 yards per game. Bill Craigo
of University of Texas at El Paso
is the leader with a 275.6 mark.
Pacific's John Read leads
completions with 18.3 average.

In team statistics Stanford is
seventh in total offense (460 );
second in forward passing offense
(28 8.5 ); and 10 th in scoring
(33.7).
Other Pacific-8 quarterbacks
gradually ascending in the
compilations are Sonny Sixkiller
of Washington, now third in
forward passing with 18
completions per game and
Oregon's Dan Fouts is 12 th with a
15.2 average.
Oregon leads the country in
passing offense, Stanford is
second, Washington is seventh and
UCLA is ninth.
In team statistics, Jackie
Brown leads rushers with 382
yards and an average of 5 .3 yards
per carry. Hillary Shockley is
second with 305 yards and a 3.6
average.
Plunkett leads total offense
with 1641 yards, 1513 passing
and 128 rushing.
Jackie Brown and Shockley are
tied for the team scoring lead with

36 points on six touchdowns,
followed by Steve Horowitz with
32 points on 20 of 25 PATs and
four of seven field goals.
Randy Vataha leads receivers
with 28 receptions and 486 yards.
Bob Moore is second with 360
yards on 18 catches and Jackie

Barnes with 46, Larry Butler with
43, Bill Alexander with 38, Pete
Lazetich and Ron Kadziel with
35, Jack Schultz with 33 and Tom
Sones and Charles McCloud with
32.
In another football
development, Coach Bill
Moultrie's freshman football team

Westwood against the UCLA
Bru babes.
His starting offensive line-up is
expected to look like this:
Tacles: Reuben Manmouth,
260; Keith Rowen, 234.

Tight end: Barry Shernoch,
210.
Guards: Bruce Blackstone,
210; Steve White, 2-2 5.
