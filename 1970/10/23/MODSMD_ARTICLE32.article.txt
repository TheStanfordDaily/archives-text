# Shaeffer Passes Pace SAE Squad
## 
### 
Offense dominated the action
as the Intramural League swung
into the second week of its
football season. Scores in the 30's
and 40's were common, and in
only a few cases did the winning
team score less than four
touchdowns.
In Monday's games, sore-armed
Dave Shaeffer threw for four
touchdowns and ran for a fifth as
he led the SAE team past the
Alpha Sigs, 32-6; ATO managed
to hold the powerful Theta Delts
scoreless for one play, but the
second play proved too difficult
to stop and the Delts rolled to
their second straight shutout,
32-0.
The Stars, fresh off a triple
overtime win over a tough
Manzanita team, eked out a 7-2
win over the Freaks. In other
games, Phi Sig beat Alpha Delt,

27-6, Lagunita busted Twain,
25-6, and Loro crushed Madera,
30-7.
Tuesday was a continuation of
the same pattern as DU, with
Mark Wilson scoring on two long
interceptions and a pass, outlasted
Sigma Chi in a wild one, 37-28.
Defensive-minded Beta Chi held
the Phi Kaps to 39 points but
neglected to score any themselves;
Toro ate up Arcos, 41-6; and,
Cedro edged past Trancos, 6 -0.
Wednesday's games were a lot
closer: Comp Sci slipped by Biz I,
13-12; the KA's topped the Kappa
Sigs, 21-6; and Ya Ya's defeated
an undernourished Cuadro team,
19-6.
