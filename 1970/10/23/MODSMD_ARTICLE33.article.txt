Stanford's varsity water polo
team traveis to the Southland
today to play USC and UCLA
over the weekend.
Boasting a 1 -1 league record
and a 9-2 season mark, the Tribe
will seek revenge for an earlier
10-5 loss to the Uclans and a
victory over the Trojans thus
keeping alive Stanford's hopes for
a place in the NCAA finals.
"These games are really
critical. One win this weekend
would probably assure us of an
NCAA berth," Coach Jim
Gaughran said.
Gaughran, an eleven-year
coach, will be banking on an
effective offensive corps led by
high-scoring Rick Massimino.
"Massimino had a 102 degree
temperature when he played
against UCLA last week. He's
been in Co well all week, but he
ought to be ready for the games,"
Gaughran explained.
Backing up Massimino will be
Bill Simpkins, former
All-American in Junior College,
Rob Woolley, All-Pac-8 second
team last year, junior Mike Davis,
and goalie Peter Gadd.
"Against UCLA, the team lost
its confidence after the two
missed penalty shots and a few
poor short shots. We also gave up
two goals after fumbling our fast
breaks," Gaughran said.
The Bruins have beaten SCS-2
earlier in the season and are the
leaders. As defending

NCAA champs, UCLA will be
tough to beat especially in their
home pool.
"We have a good chance
against both USC and UCLA,"
Coach Gaughran concluded.
The Indians will get a second
shot at the Trojans Nov. 7 when
USC comes to Encina pool. The
Tribe's other rough game will be a

rematch against Cal—who they
beat earlier here—Nov. 20 in
Berkeley.
Stanford's next home action
will be Oct. 27 at 3:30 p.m.
against the University of Pacific.
Two days later the Indians play
their only night game of the
season in an 8 p.m. home match
with DeAnza A.F.
