Murder Suspect Identified
SANTA CRUZ — A long-haired young neighbor of Dr.
Victor M. Ohta was charged Thursday with the methodical
murder of the wealthy eye surgeon and four others in a
hilltop mansion.
John Linley Frazier, 24, also known as John Linley
Pascal, was charged in a warrant and was at large authorities
said. Frazier had lived in a small, run-down cottage within
walking distance of Ohta's home, when the murders were
committed.
Dist. Atty. Peter Chang said no other warrants have been
issued. It is possible, Chang said, that one person could have
killed all five persons, dumped their bodies into the
swimming pool, set the house - afire and blocked the
driveway with cars at two points.
Ray Belgard, chief district attorney's investigator, filed
an affidavit supporting the warrant in which he quotes
Frazier's wife as saying he left his cottage with a loaded
pistol and a back pack Saturday two days before the
murders.
In addition, it says Frazier told a friend that he "had
tampered with the Ohta car and that people who lived like
the Ohtas were materialistic and 'should be snuffed.' "
Sheriff James described Frazier, as white, about 5 foot
7, with long brown hair and a light-colored beard.
SLF. Funeral Bombed
SAN FRANCISCO - An anti-personel bomb exploded
Thursday outside a church filled with 125 mourners and
policemen 15 minutes before scheduled funeral services for
a slain officer.
No one was injured.
The device shattered a stained glass window and twisted
its wrought iron grill, shoved up a section of roof and blew
plaster and stucco off the walls. It also hurled nails over
several homes to a street a block away.
One police officer said it was "truly amazing" that no
one was injured. Some spectators and newsmen outside
were showered with flying fragments of dirt, stone and bits
of metal.
The blast went off at 9:45 a.m., 15 minutes before
services were to begin for policeman Harold L. Hamilton,

32 fatally wounded Monday in a gun battle at a bank
holdup.
Mayor Joseph L. Alioto said the city will offer a $5,000
reward for information leading to arrest and conviction.
Russians Hold Generals
MOSCOW — Two U.S. Army generals, seized by the
Russians after their plane strayed across the Soviet-Turkish
border, were being held in communicado Thursday as the
Soviet Union launched an investigation into the incident.
A U.S. Embassy official said it is "quite unlikely" that
the generals will be released soon.
With them in the six seat utility plane were a Turkish
escort officer and the American pilot.
The plane apparently wandered off course Wednesday
during bad weather and crossed the heavily fortified border.
Details on how it was intercepted were not immediately
made public.
U.S. officials in Turkey said the generals were making an
inspection flight from Erzurum to Kars, just 4 0 miles from
the Soviet frontier.
In custody apparently in the town of Leninakan, Soviet
Armenia, where the plane landed, are Maj. Gen. Edward
C.D. Scherrer, 57, commander of the joint U.S. Military
Mission to Turkey,
Army Chief Assassinated
SANTIAGO, Chile — Terrorists blocked an automobile
carrying the commander-in-chief of Chile's army at a busy
intersection Thursday and gunned him down. Maj. Gen.
Rene Schneider, 57, was reported in critical condition
Thursday night after emergency surgery.
Political organizations backing Marxist Salvador Allende
for president blamed the assassination attempt on
"ultrarightwing groups . . in league with foreign elements
who see their interests affected" by Allende's victory.
Allende's victory as Latin America's first democratically
elected Marxist president was virtually assured Thursday
night when the Senate approved a constitutional provision
containing "effective democratic guarantees" which
Allende had to promise to observe in return for Christian
Democratic support.

its wrought iron grill, shoved up a section of roof and blew
plaster and stucco off the walls. It also hurled nails over
several homes to a street a block away.
One police officer said it was "truly amazing" that no

Russians Hold Generals
MOSCOW — Two U.S. Army generals, seized by the
Russians after their plane strayed across the Soviet-Turkish
border, were being held in communicado Thursday as the
Soviet Union launched an investigation into the incident.
A U.S. Embassy official said it is "quite unlikely" that
the generals will be released soon.
With them in the six seat utility plane were a Turkish
escort officer and the American pilot.
The plane apparently wandered off course Wednesday
during bad weather and crossed the heavily fortified border.
Details on how it was intercepted were not immediately
made public.
U.S. officials in Turkey said the generals were making an
inspection flight from Erzurum to Kars, just 4 0 miles from
the Soviet frontier.
In custody apparently in the town of Leninakan, Soviet
Armenia, where the plane landed, are Maj. Gen. Edward
C.D. Scherrer, 57, commander of the joint U.S. Military
Mission to Turkey,
Army Chief Assassinated
SANTIAGO, Chile — Terrorists blocked an automobile
carrying the commander-in-chief of Chile's army at a busy
intersection Thursday and gunned him down. Maj. Gen.
Rene Schneider, 57, was reported in critical condition
Thursday night after emergency surgery.
Political organizations backing Marxist Salvador Allende
for president blamed the assassination attempt on
"ultrarightwing groups . . in league with foreign elements
who see their interests affected" by Allende's victory.
Allende's victory as Latin America's first democratically
elected Marxist president was virtually assured Thursday
night when the Senate approved a constitutional provision
containing "effective democratic guarantees" which
Allende had to promise to observe in return for Christian
Democratic support.
Murder Suspect Identified
SANTA CRUZ — A long-haired young neighbor of Dr.
Victor M. Ohta was charged Thursday with the methodical
murder of the wealthy eye surgeon and four others in a
hilltop mansion.
John Linley Frazier, 24, also known as John Linley
Pascal, was charged in a warrant and was at large authorities
said. Frazier had lived in a small, run-down cottage within
walking distance of Ohta's home, when the murders were
committed.
Dist. Atty. Peter Chang said no other warrants have been
issued. It is possible, Chang said, that one person could have
killed all five persons, dumped their bodies into the
swimming pool, set the house - afire and blocked the
driveway with cars at two points.
Ray Belgard, chief district attorney's investigator, filed
an affidavit supporting the warrant in which he quotes
Frazier's wife as saying he left his cottage with a loaded
pistol and a back pack Saturday two days before the
murders.
In addition, it says Frazier told a friend that he "had
tampered with the Ohta car and that people who lived like
the Ohtas were materialistic and 'should be snuffed.' "
Sheriff James described Frazier, as white, about 5 foot
7, with long brown hair and a light-colored beard.
SLF. Funeral Bombed
SAN FRANCISCO - An anti-personel bomb exploded
Thursday outside a church filled with 125 mourners and
policemen 15 minutes before scheduled funeral services for
a slain officer.
No one was injured.
