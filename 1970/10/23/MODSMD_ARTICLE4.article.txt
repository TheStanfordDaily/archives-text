# Alternative To Dorms
## Jordan House First Co-operative 
### LOUISE LIBBY 
The 3 4 inhabitants of Jordan House
are taking part in an experiment in
group living that offers the personal
closeness that dormitories generally
lack.
They were seeking a more
meaningful University living experience
so they gathered into a co-op house.
What they found in the large white
dwelling on Mayfield Avenue is "a
fantastically family-like thing."
The co-op came into being because
two freshmen. Rick and Jess, decided a
year ago that the conventional
alternatives to University housing were
inadequate. An ad in the Daily turned
up others who were unhappy with the
impersonality of dorm living.
Considering that co-operative
housing is not a new idea. Rick, who is
house president as well as founding
father, believes "it's about time
Stanford had it." He hopes to live there
for the rest of his time at the
University.
The $300 each person pays to live at
Jordan goes for rent to the University
and food. Although this is cheaper than
dorm living, the reason people want to
live in co-op is not financial.
Mellow
One boy calls living at Jordan a
"mellowing experience. It's really hang
loose, with no authority."
Anabelle enjoys "how close people
are now, and how we do things
together. Last Saturday night, for
instance, we danced to soul music until
\ or 5 a.m."
Bill remarks that he gets more
studying done than he did in the dorm.
"We sit around a fire in the evenings
and study together. You really feel at
home."

Outside, Jordan has a lawn. Inside,
there is a front hall, a living room big
enough to accomodate the non-credit
house seminar on yoga, a dining room,
and a room for anything. Some people
hope to get a potter's wheel, which
would offer, along with the piano and
the interior decorating, "a great outlet
for creativity." A spiral staircase curves

"UV are getting together more than any other group living on
earn/) us. "

up from the front hall to the third
floor, with an inscription along the
inside reading: "May you forget your
cares as you go up these stairs." Rooms
are distinctive, a contrast to the
barracks-like sameness of dorm rooms.
Work Shared
Work is shared equally. Since there
is no employed maintenance staff,
everyone takes turns at cooking,
washing dishes, house-cleaning, and
shopping. Jennifer, one of the first to
be interested in the co-op idea,
approves of Jordan's system.
"You know all the people here not
just by talking to them, but by working
with them and doing things together.
You aren't you by yourself, but you in
relation to the house."
"Anyway, jobs aren't totally
structured," Jennifer points out.
"People help each other rtut."
Jess'thinks that the work won't be a
problem. "They know that petty
hassles can screw everything up.
Everybody's pulling for it to work, so
they do their chores."
Varied Menu
One of the major chores is cooking,
which generally requires the entire
afternoon. The dinners concocted by
'lie chefs are worth the time, however.

Menus range from Chinese, Italian, and
Mexican food to ham and cherries
jubilee. Last Thursday evening, the
kitchen crew produced banana
daiquiris, shish Kabob, and flaming
Baked Alaska.
"Cooking is hard for those of us
who have no experience," explains one
non-domestic-looking male. "So

sometimes dinner is a little late tor
people with night classes."
Unlike the University food service,
the people working in Jordan's
high-ceilinged and spacious kitchen
cook for a small number of people, so
"there has not been a bad meal yet."
Beyond the initial idea of a more
meaningful living unit, Jordan is not a
theme house. It is not a commune,
since, firstly, it is University-sponsored

and therefore respectable, and
secondly, because possessions are not.
owned by the whole group, Stereos, for
instance, remain the property of the
individual who brought them to the
house. There is a feeling of closeness
and sharing, however, that is
commune-like.
"This isn't the place for people who
want a lot of solitude," a girl says. Jess,
on the other hand, does feel that
"people respect each other's privacy.
They know it's hard to be communal
all the time." Above all, those living in
Jordan feel that they are open and
friendly to each other and to guests and
outsiders.
Togetherness is mood of the
house. They even get hypnotized
togeher. Doubtless, the physical
comforts of eating and sleeping at
Jordan are added benefits. But the
reason for living there is that "we are
getting together more than any other
group living on campus."
