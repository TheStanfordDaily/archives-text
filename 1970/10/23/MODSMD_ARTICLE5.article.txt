## Ripping Off The System

The road that leads to the
point where one can condone
ripping off the supermarket tor
casual groceries began, of course,
with the idea that it was okay to
cheat on income taxes and screw
the phone company. Lives there a
citizen with soul so dead who
never delighted in the phone
company's mistake in returning
his dime in the phone booth or in
the casual chance to make a toll
call they couldn't trace?
But we all thought of that as
harmless in the olden times, a
casual bit of personal Robin Hood
which wasn't really evil, rather
like a "white lie" (ever think of
the racial implications of that
expression?) and which didn't
mean that we were dishonest at
all. Just that we got rooked
enough by the phone company so
that we were just getting a little
bit of our own back, eh?
Over the years since World War
11, that philosophy has extended
its grip until it is now accepted
among many young people that it
is all right to clout a book from
the campus bookstore, steal a slab
of cheese from the Safeway or
grab somebody else's bottle of
milk off the porch: My need is
greater than yours.
Nuthin' to Lose'
But then, generally speaking,
those who espouse this attitude
are in the position Dylan speaks
of — "if you ain't got nothin', you
got nothin' to lose"— and so do
not see it as a personal threat now
or in the future. "My friends and I
beat the buses and the street cars
whenever we can," a
non-establishment journalist told
me, "it's the only way we can
survive and it's okay because the
city should not charge for
transportation anyway."
This is a very real concept
today all over the country and it
is close to bring epidemic
regarding the retail stores.
Newspaoer racks have had to
become minature strong boxes to
survive and the plethora and TV

cameras, peep holes and mirrors in
stores guarding against pilferage is
all too obvious.
That is why it struck me with
particular poignancy the other
day to read, on a vending box
owned by one of the underground
local papers, one which
encourages the whole atmosphere
of selective morality and personal
judgment, the following legend
painged in white: "People, Please
don't steal any papers or hurt this
machine. My family has to eat,
just like yours."
The Underground Too
I've since seen it on a number
of underground newspaper
vending boses, not only in the
streets of Berkeley but elsewhere.
And it is, I submit, just as much a
token of the acceptance of the
profit system as any landlord's
lease, corporation stock dividend
or bank loan interest. The week I
first saw it, I heard a
pseu do-youth culture radio
commercial on KSAN for the
Bank of America and the
combination of both extremes
moving towards a common
meeting point blew my mind.
Since man first ground down a
stone, lashed it to a stick and used
it as a weapon in the jungle of life,
those among us who have
willingly allowed another to take
what is ours without asking have
been few. Men draw the line
somewhere: money, property,
woman, weapon, food. The
primitive who retains the secret of
his name jealously is only at the
first step.
Some years ago when a
celebrated episode of stealing hit
the newspapers (a law student
ripped off a textbook from a
bookstore and was pinched), a
radical friend of mine defended
the action on the grounds that the
bookstore made an exorbitant
profit (by his judgment) on the
sale of books. How do I know
when you are in my house that
you won't decide unilaterally that
I own too many books for one
person and grab what you want? I
asked him. Ah, but that was
another matter.

Another poignant example of
the implicit contradiction about
rights of possession prevalent
today is the position of a
student-operated record store
which has no moral objection to
selling or even distributing bootleg
records, a pure form of stealing,
but which leaflets its community
begging them not to steal records
from the shelves. It depends, I
guess, on whose ox is gored,
which suggests that the Aquarian
age is not quite so divorced from
age-old natural laws as some of its
exponents might wish to think.
Does not a man own what he
makes with his hands or his brain
at least to the extent of a primary
interest? That question is going to
have to be faced by those who are
advocating free concerts, free
music, free everything, sooner or
later. In the world of music it is a
particularly pressing problem
because rock groups command
high fees which make admission
prices rise, while a vocal segment
of their audience insists that the
music belongs to the people and
as such should be free.
But again it might be argued
that there is a difference between
scratching an itch and tearing the
flesh to pieces. When the Rolling
Stones charged huge fees to
appear, it dictated high prices and
when Mick Jagger denied
responsibility (even though his
contract said "the artist" had to
approve the prices) it was
dishonest.
Matter of Greed
It was the love of money that
was the root of all evil and
gluttony that was a sin. No one
really objects to paying for what
he wants, or needs but when the
price includes a generous dab of
pure greed, whether it be the high
rent for a decaying flat or
anything else, then man's basic
paranoia comes rushing to the
surface. The state, the system and
individuals all combine to exploit
us in a certain sense and in a
deeper one, man has a necessity
and therefore the right to feed his
family which is so innocently
stated in the legend on the
underground newspaper vendinp
box.

It is a fascinating situation,
another aspect of the fascinating
time in which we live, as values
and ideas and assumptions are
clashing and being revised and
reconsidered. The effect of The
Diggers' free food in the park and
the rock bands' free music has
been far deeper than perhaps they
dreamed at the time. That it all
culminated in the tragedy at
Altamont is only a reflection in
microcosm of the perversity of
our entire civilization in which,
somehow, a basic Haw turns even
our best dreams into nightmares.
A Step Forward
Out of it all, inevitably, come
turmoil and strife but also comes
the thrust to make things better
and even if that thrust is fated to
follow the myth of Sisyphus, still
there are benefits. To find former
Governor Scranton and Secretary

Hickel advocating serious dialogue
with students as essential to
solving the country's problems is a
step forward despite the reaction
of the Reagan-Hayakawa hard
hats.
Exclusivity in the name of
right or left, young or old, rich or
poor is but another label for
elitism and snobism and the
assumption of an appointed
mission, the same kind of thing
that has gotten us into trouble
throughout history.
How nice it would be if the
author of that legend on the
vending box could discuss the
problem with the President. It
would be good for both of them,
since, essentially, they both are
after the same thing even though
they define it differently.
