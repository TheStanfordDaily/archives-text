## Lumpers And Splitters

"There is, even in a conflict with a foe with whom
we have little in common, the possibility and
necessity of living in a dimension of meaning in
which the urgencies of the struggle are
subordinated to a sense of awe before the vastness
of the historical drama in which we are jointly
involved..."
Reinhold Niebuhr in
The Irony of American History
The idea for this column developed out of a
course I took last Fall from Professor David Potter
of the History Department. It was entitled The
American Character, and, as its title indicates, was
based on the premise that certain qualities typify
and pervade the American experience.
As Professor Potter put it, there , are both
"lumpers" and "splitters" amongst historians;
those who concentrate on the elements of
sameness and continuity, and those who
emphasize the aspects of contrast and change. 1 he
national character approach is by nature a
"lumpers" discipline, for it focuses on the ways in
which people are alike. This column will be
written from a "lumpers" perspective. For we who
find ourselves in the latter third of the 2Oth
century, the forces of accelerating change and
growing alienation sometimes seem overpowering.
In the confused vortex of these times, it is easy to
forget that we are our parents children, our
ancestors descendants, in a spiritual as well as an
hereditary sense.
In this column 1 will attempt each week to
bring out some of the many ways in which the
thinking and events of today find close relation to
what has gone before. I will focus on the impulses
which seem most basic to this generation; peace,
freedom, ecology, and especially the search for
self. By putting the various elements of our
situation in perspective I hope to show that our
age is perhaps less singular than most of us tend to
believe.
Fallible Humans
There will be no effort made to whitewash any
particular point of view, to the discredit of those
who would contend with it. At the same time, no
claim is made to impartiality. For I have not one,
but three axes to grind; three central arguments
which are generally overlooked or rejected
outright by the groups to whom they pertain. In
sum, their effect is to condemn no one, but to
reduce all protagonists to the status of fallible
human beings.
The first of these is directed to the great mass
of middle Americans who tend to see any one left
of Hubert Humphrey as an alien perverter of
American culture. They cannot understand how
one could voluntarily move from the "immortal
truths" of our heritage to the radical analysis
increasingly heard today. Their most common
explanation for this transition is that our youth
have been corrupted by agents of a foreign power.
To the contrary, 1 will argue that the discontent
and unrest so prevalent today is in total concert
with the reality of our history. It two terms had to
be selected to sum up our national experience as
distinguished from what went before, they would

be freedom and equality in that order. And that is
what everyone is so up-tight about today.
No Endorsement
Again, this is not an endorsement of any
viewpoint, for the wisdom of the ideals is another
matter entirely. It is only to say that Patrick
Henry and David Harris, William Lloyd Garrison
and Huey Newton are branches on the same
philosophical tree.
Point two is directed at radicals who make a
fetish of their anti-Americanism, and rest secure in
the embrace of their revolutionary dogma. Though
they can't give an epistemological justification for
their beliefs, they are nonetheless skewered on the
notion that the truth of the revolution transcends
history and time. Their's is a truth unlike the prior
truths of George Washington, the Single Tax, and
Grand-Pa's All-Purpose Elixir. Eor where the silver
plating has worn off the othersâ€”or at least begun
to tarnish, the sterling finish of the Revolution will
never lose its lustre. How naive can you get?
By demonstrating the ways in which radical
thought is a product of circumstances, 1 hope to
reveal the boring presumption in their
self-righteous fervor.
Finally, to an academic community largely
preoccupied with secular learning and the
solutions to worldly problems, I will try to point
out the extent to which we are guided by
traditional religious patterns of thought. To a great
extent, the process of secularization in America
has amounted to calling the same things by
different names.
The age-old expectation of a Millenium and the
accompanying anticipation of new reign of peace
and tranquility has been supplanted; first by the
Utopian ventures of the last century, and today by
perfectionist efforts like the Vietnam Moratorium
and the socially-oriented Great Society.
Where America once truly represented the New
World, God's earthly kingdom, it is today imbued
with a philosophy of secular progress. Where
Scripture was the basis for millenial expectations,
history is the reason we now believe that things
should, by rights, keep getting better all the time.
The ancient quest to regain the Garden ot Eden
found constant expression in a 200 year westward
trek across an unsettled wilderness. Indeed, there
are cases of individuals claiming to have tound in
the wilderness the very spot from which our
progenitors were cast out.
The celebration of nature throughout our
history is closely linked to this aspiration for a
renewed innocence. The ecology movement is, as
well as a practical matter, the latest and perhaps
most dramatic expression of this drive.
In sum, 1 will strive each week to bring
elements of continuity into an atmosphere
dominated by isolation and disjunction. 1 will not
hesitate to take sides against the elements in our
society which most actively promote a fragmented
social view. Hut in the main my point will be
positive; that amidst all the discord there persists
what can be called an American Way.
