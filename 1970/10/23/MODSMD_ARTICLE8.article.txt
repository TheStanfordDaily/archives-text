Hook, New York University professor of philosophy and head of

American colleges and universities today face the gravest crisis in
their history. Some university presidents to the contrary
notwithstanding, it is not a crisis caused by lack of money. It is a crisis
caused by the lack of a coherent educational philosophy, by a
betrayal of the primary commitment of the university to the quest for
truth and integrity in inquiry, in learning, and teaching. All the money
in the world cannot remedy the failure of nerve and intelligence
entailed by the loss of central purpose.
Nor is the crisis one of student unrest—if unrest is related to the
pursuit of an education, to interest in ideas and beliefs. Intellectual
unrest is not a problem but a virtue, and no university can have too
much of it if it is engaged in genuine educational tasks.
The problem and threat is not academic unrest but academic
disruption and violence which flow from substituting for the academic
goals of learning, the political goals of action. Some administrators
who have abetted the erosion of the academic ideal are Peeking to
muddy the waters by pretending that the public is getting fed up with
controversy, and that the chief threat to academic freedom today
comes from without and not from within. This is noisome hogwash.
The objection is not to controversy, for intellectual controversy is
the lifyof mina. The public objection is to how controversy is carried
on—to the use of bombs, arson, vandalism, physical assault and other
expressions of violent strife and turmoil.
Academic Violence
Most of the problems that plague the American campus today and
threaten its future as a genuine educational institution can be traced
to the view that unless "the major social and foreign policy problems
of our society" are met satisfactorily, campus disruption and violence
will continue. Leading university administrators have endorsed this
proposition. One of them has even proclaimed that academic violence
in part "derives from the distance separating the American dream
from the American reality."
This view and the actions that flow from it lead first to the
political polarization of the campus, then to the political alienation of
the campus from the democratic community. If unchecked it will
result in academic genocide—the destruction of academic freedom.
What is wrong with it? Many things. First, there will always be a
disparity between the American dream and reality, even if, as we raise
our sights higher, we redefine the meaning and content of that dream.
There will always be social and foreign policy problems in an open
society of uncoerced opinion, so that we are confronted by a
perspective of unending academic violence if we accept this view.
Second, it perverts the university's function, which is to study
these social and political problems and to analyze alternative
purported solutions to them. It transforms an agenda of study into an
agenda of action, and therewith converts the university into a political
organization agitating for the adoption of partisan political goals. It
not only prejudices the university's tax exempt status, but invites
political reprisals from a public that does not share its political
commitments.
Influential Fraction
Third, and most important, it violates the fundamental principles
of political democracy by threatening to resort to force and violence
unless the community adopts the solutions to social and foreign
policy problems advocated not by the majority of the electorate, but
by an elite minority.
To whose satisfaction must the "major social and foreign policy
problems of our society" be met before we have surcease of campus
violence and turmoil? Even if there were complete unanimity among
students and faculty on how these problems are to be is
far from being the case—what right would they have to make
ultimatistic demands on the community that the solutions they

advocate be adopted? Such decisions are for the representative
legislative bodies of a democracy to make.
The political process is open to students and faculty on the same
footing as all other qualified citizens to express their point of view. It
shows profound contempt on their part for democratic due process to
use or to threaten or even to condone violence, when they have failed
to persuade or convince the electorate.
Subversive Threats
Suppose the trade unionists or the farmers of the nation, who are
also minorities but much more numerous than students, were to
threaten violence unless "the major social and foreign policy problems
of our society" were met to their satisfaction? Everybody would
recognize such threats as subersive of the democratic process, as
harbingers of fascist rule no matter what the revolutionary rhetoric in
which such threats were clothed.
Fourth, actually the university community is not homogeneous.
The most militant of the student factions are small minorities. They
make no bones about their hostility to democracy, their scorn for
rational process. Their heroes are the leaders of the most ruthless
dictatorships—Lenin, Mao-Tse-tung, Castro, Ho Chi Minh, Che
Guevara. They openly declare that "our major social and foreign
problems of our society" can never be solved to their satisfaction, for
their goal is the destruction of our society. How, then account for
their influence, for their ability to create a major crisis in American
higher education?
There are many reasons. Among them are the build-up and great
publicity extremist student groups and their irresponsible leaders have
received in the mass media. Liberal students who do not threaten to
blow up computers are not news, no matter how intelligent their
programs of educational reform. Much more important is
administrative cowardise, and in consequence of this cowardice,
administrative connivance.
A Campus Scenario
The scenario runs something like this. Different extremist groups
vie with each other in making all sorts of demands on the university
under the threat of tearing the university apart. In hopes of winning
them over or purchasing peace, the administration, often with the
support of the faculty, yields to threats, grants amnesty for previous
defiance of rules governing student conduct. The mood of peace at
any price, together with actual physical fear of harassment, become
dominant.
The extremists escalate their demands until administrations and
faculties, to avoid further confrontation, yield on issues that
politicalize the campus. The university is saved by destroying or
transforming its raison d'etre. The prestige of a handful of extremists is
thereby enhanced while those who disagree with them appear
ineffectual. Violence and the threat of violence seem to pay. When
violence gets out of hand, and measures of meeting it also get out of
hand (as at Kent State), a sense of collective guilt weakens the will to
resistance of almost all administrators and faculty bodies against
arbitrary demands to politicalize the university.
Fifth, an obvious consequence of the politicization of the
university is the erosion of academic freedom—of the right to teach
and the right to learn—of faculty and students. Once the university as
a corporate body takes a political stand, members of the faculty who
disagree with that stand are harassed.
When classes are suspended for purposes of political demonstration
or colleges are closed down by strikes, the teacher's freedom to teach
has been abridged and the right of students freely to attend their
classes destroyed. Even before recent events led some prestigious
universities to mobilize all their educational resources in order to
influence Congress to take political action, or to strike in behalf of
causes that had nothing to do with educational issues (like the Yale
strike in behalf of the Black Panthers) or to announce the closing
down of the university in the fall (as at Princeton) to permit
electioneering for so-called "peace candidates," the intimidation by
extremist students of faculty members and students had become
widespread.

to persuade or convince the electorate.
Subversive Threats
Suppose the trade unionists or the farmers of the nation, who are
also minorities but much more numerous than students, were to
threaten violence unless "the major social and foreign policy problems
of our society" were met to their satisfaction? Everybody would
recognize such threats as subersive of the democratic process, as
harbingers of fascist rule no matter what the revolutionary rhetoric in
which such threats were clothed.
Fourth, actually the university community is not homogeneous.
The most militant of the student factions are small minorities. They
make no bones about their hostility to democracy, their scorn for
rational process. Their heroes are the leaders of the most ruthless
dictatorships—Lenin, Mao-Tse-tung, Castro, Ho Chi Minh, Che
Guevara. They openly declare that "our major social and foreign
problems of our society" can never be solved to their satisfaction, for
their goal is the destruction of our society. How, then account for
their influence, for their ability to create a major crisis in American
higher education?
There are many reasons. Among them are the build-up and great
publicity extremist student groups and their irresponsible leaders have
received in the mass media. Liberal students who do not threaten to
blow up computers are not news, no matter how intelligent their
programs of educational reform. Much more important is
administrative cowardise, and in consequence of this cowardice,
administrative connivance.
A Campus Scenario
The scenario runs something like this. Different extremist groups
vie with each other in making all sorts of demands on the university
under the threat of tearing the university apart. In hopes of winning
them over or purchasing peace, the administration, often with the
support of the faculty, yields to threats, grants amnesty for previous
defiance of rules governing student conduct. The mood of peace at
any price, together with actual physical fear of harassment, become
dominant.
The extremists escalate their demands until administrations and
faculties, to avoid further confrontation, yield on issues that
politicalize the campus. The university is saved by destroying or
transforming its raison d'etre. The prestige of a handful of extremists is
thereby enhanced while those who disagree with them appear
ineffectual. Violence and the threat of violence seem to pay. When
violence gets out of hand, and measures of meeting it also get out of
hand (as at Kent State), a sense of collective guilt weakens the will to
resistance of almost all administrators and faculty bodies against
arbitrary demands to politicalize the university.
Fifth, an obvious consequence of the politicization of the
university is the erosion of academic freedom—of the right to teach
and the right to learn—of faculty and students. Once the university as
a corporate body takes a political stand, members of the faculty who
disagree with that stand are harassed.
When classes are suspended for purposes of political demonstration
or colleges are closed down by strikes, the teacher's freedom to teach
has been abridged and the right of students freely to attend their
classes destroyed. Even before recent events led some prestigious
universities to mobilize all their educational resources in order to
influence Congress to take political action, or to strike in behalf of
causes that had nothing to do with educational issues (like the Yale
strike in behalf of the Black Panthers) or to announce the closing
down of the university in the fall (as at Princeton) to permit
electioneering for so-called "peace candidates," the intimidation by
extremist students of faculty members and students had become
widespread.

Hook, New York University professor of philosophy and head of

President Nixon to all college presidents this fall. The second half will

American colleges and universities today face the gravest crisis in
their history. Some university presidents to the contrary
notwithstanding, it is not a crisis caused by lack of money. It is a crisis
caused by the lack of a coherent educational philosophy, by a
betrayal of the primary commitment of the university to the quest for
truth and integrity in inquiry, in learning, and teaching. All the money
in the world cannot remedy the failure of nerve and intelligence
entailed by the loss of central purpose.
Nor is the crisis one of student unrest—if unrest is related to the
pursuit of an education, to interest in ideas and beliefs. Intellectual
unrest is not a problem but a virtue, and no university can have too
much of it if it is engaged in genuine educational tasks.
The problem and threat is not academic unrest but academic
disruption and violence which flow from substituting for the academic
goals of learning, the political goals of action. Some administrators
who have abetted the erosion of the academic ideal are Peeking to
muddy the waters by pretending that the public is getting fed up with
controversy, and that the chief threat to academic freedom today
comes from without and not from within. This is noisome hogwash.
The objection is not to controversy, for intellectual controversy is
the lifyof mina. The public objection is to how controversy is carried
on—to the use of bombs, arson, vandalism, physical assault and other
expressions of violent strife and turmoil.
Academic Violence
Most of the problems that plague the American campus today and
threaten its future as a genuine educational institution can be traced
to the view that unless "the major social and foreign policy problems
of our society" are met satisfactorily, campus disruption and violence
will continue. Leading university administrators have endorsed this
proposition. One of them has even proclaimed that academic violence
in part "derives from the distance separating the American dream
from the American reality."
This view and the actions that flow from it lead first to the
political polarization of the campus, then to the political alienation of
the campus from the democratic community. If unchecked it will
result in academic genocide—the destruction of academic freedom.
What is wrong with it? Many things. First, there will always be a
disparity between the American dream and reality, even if, as we raise
our sights higher, we redefine the meaning and content of that dream.
There will always be social and foreign policy problems in an open
society of uncoerced opinion, so that we are confronted by a
perspective of unending academic violence if we accept this view.
Second, it perverts the university's function, which is to study
these social and political problems and to analyze alternative
purported solutions to them. It transforms an agenda of study into an
agenda of action, and therewith converts the university into a political
organization agitating for the adoption of partisan political goals. It
not only prejudices the university's tax exempt status, but invites
political reprisals from a public that does not share its political
commitments.
Influential Fraction
Third, and most important, it violates the fundamental principles
of political democracy by threatening to resort to force and violence
unless the community adopts the solutions to social and foreign
policy problems advocated not by the majority of the electorate, but
by an elite minority.
To whose satisfaction must the "major social and foreign policy
problems of our society" be met before we have surcease of campus
violence and turmoil? Even if there were complete unanimity among
students and faculty on how these problems are to be is
far from being the case—what right would they have to make
ultimatistic demands on the community that the solutions they

advocate be adopted? Such decisions are for the representative
legislative bodies of a democracy to make.
The political process is open to students and faculty on the same
footing as all other qualified citizens to express their point of view. It
shows profound contempt on their part for democratic due process to
use or to threaten or even to condone violence, when they have failed
to persuade or convince the electorate.

entailed by the loss of central purpose.
Nor is the crisis one of student unrest—if unrest is related to the
pursuit of an education, to interest in ideas and beliefs. Intellectual
unrest is not a problem but a virtue, and no university can have too
much of it if it is engaged in genuine educational tasks.
The problem and threat is not academic unrest but academic
disruption and violence which flow from substituting for the academic
goals of learning, the political goals of action. Some administrators
who have abetted the erosion of the academic ideal are Peeking to
muddy the waters by pretending that the public is getting fed up with
controversy, and that the chief threat to academic freedom today
comes from without and not from within. This is noisome hogwash.
The objection is not to controversy, for intellectual controversy is
the lifyof mina. The public objection is to how controversy is carried
on—to the use of bombs, arson, vandalism, physical assault and other
expressions of violent strife and turmoil.
Academic Violence
Most of the problems that plague the American campus today and
threaten its future as a genuine educational institution can be traced
to the view that unless "the major social and foreign policy problems
of our society" are met satisfactorily, campus disruption and violence
will continue. Leading university administrators have endorsed this
proposition. One of them has even proclaimed that academic violence
in part "derives from the distance separating the American dream
from the American reality."
This view and the actions that flow from it lead first to the
political polarization of the campus, then to the political alienation of
the campus from the democratic community. If unchecked it will
result in academic genocide—the destruction of academic freedom.
What is wrong with it? Many things. First, there will always be a
disparity between the American dream and reality, even if, as we raise
our sights higher, we redefine the meaning and content of that dream.
There will always be social and foreign policy problems in an open
society of uncoerced opinion, so that we are confronted by a
perspective of unending academic violence if we accept this view.
Second, it perverts the university's function, which is to study
these social and political problems and to analyze alternative
purported solutions to them. It transforms an agenda of study into an
agenda of action, and therewith converts the university into a political
organization agitating for the adoption of partisan political goals. It
not only prejudices the university's tax exempt status, but invites
political reprisals from a public that does not share its political
commitments.
Influential Fraction
Third, and most important, it violates the fundamental principles
of political democracy by threatening to resort to force and violence
unless the community adopts the solutions to social and foreign
policy problems advocated not by the majority of the electorate, but
by an elite minority.
To whose satisfaction must the "major social and foreign policy
problems of our society" be met before we have surcease of campus
violence and turmoil? Even if there were complete unanimity among
students and faculty on how these problems are to be is
far from being the case—what right would they have to make
ultimatistic demands on the community that the solutions they

advocate be adopted? Such decisions are for the representative
legislative bodies of a democracy to make.
The political process is open to students and faculty on the same
footing as all other qualified citizens to express their point of view. It
shows profound contempt on their part for democratic due process to
use or to threaten or even to condone violence, when they have failed
to persuade or convince the electorate.
Subversive Threats
Suppose the trade unionists or the farmers of the nation, who are
also minorities but much more numerous than students, were to
threaten violence unless "the major social and foreign policy problems
of our society" were met to their satisfaction? Everybody would
recognize such threats as subersive of the democratic process, as
harbingers of fascist rule no matter what the revolutionary rhetoric in
which such threats were clothed.
Fourth, actually the university community is not homogeneous.
The most militant of the student factions are small minorities. They
make no bones about their hostility to democracy, their scorn for
rational process. Their heroes are the leaders of the most ruthless
dictatorships—Lenin, Mao-Tse-tung, Castro, Ho Chi Minh, Che
Guevara. They openly declare that "our major social and foreign
problems of our society" can never be solved to their satisfaction, for
their goal is the destruction of our society. How, then account for
their influence, for their ability to create a major crisis in American
higher education?
There are many reasons. Among them are the build-up and great
publicity extremist student groups and their irresponsible leaders have
received in the mass media. Liberal students who do not threaten to
blow up computers are not news, no matter how intelligent their
programs of educational reform. Much more important is
administrative cowardise, and in consequence of this cowardice,
administrative connivance.
A Campus Scenario
The scenario runs something like this. Different extremist groups
vie with each other in making all sorts of demands on the university
under the threat of tearing the university apart. In hopes of winning
them over or purchasing peace, the administration, often with the
support of the faculty, yields to threats, grants amnesty for previous
defiance of rules governing student conduct. The mood of peace at
any price, together with actual physical fear of harassment, become
dominant.
The extremists escalate their demands until administrations and
faculties, to avoid further confrontation, yield on issues that
politicalize the campus. The university is saved by destroying or
transforming its raison d'etre. The prestige of a handful of extremists is
thereby enhanced while those who disagree with them appear
ineffectual. Violence and the threat of violence seem to pay. When
violence gets out of hand, and measures of meeting it also get out of
hand (as at Kent State), a sense of collective guilt weakens the will to
resistance of almost all administrators and faculty bodies against
arbitrary demands to politicalize the university.
Fifth, an obvious consequence of the politicization of the
university is the erosion of academic freedom—of the right to teach
and the right to learn—of faculty and students. Once the university as
a corporate body takes a political stand, members of the faculty who
disagree with that stand are harassed.
When classes are suspended for purposes of political demonstration
or colleges are closed down by strikes, the teacher's freedom to teach
has been abridged and the right of students freely to attend their
classes destroyed. Even before recent events led some prestigious
universities to mobilize all their educational resources in order to
influence Congress to take political action, or to strike in behalf of
causes that had nothing to do with educational issues (like the Yale
strike in behalf of the Black Panthers) or to announce the closing
down of the university in the fall (as at Princeton) to permit
electioneering for so-called "peace candidates," the intimidation by
extremist students of faculty members and students had become
widespread.

American colleges and universities today face the gravest crisis in
their history. Some university presidents to the contrary

caused by the lack of a coherent educational philosophy, by a

dictatorships—Lenin, Mao-Tse-tung, Castro, Ho Chi Minh, Che
Guevara. They openly declare that "our major social and foreign
problems of our society" can never be solved to their satisfaction, for
their goal is the destruction of our society. How, then account for
their influence, for their ability to create a major crisis in American
higher education?
There are many reasons. Among them are the build-up and great
publicity extremist student groups and their irresponsible leaders have
received in the mass media. Liberal students who do not threaten to
blow up computers are not news, no matter how intelligent their
programs of educational reform. Much more important is
administrative cowardise, and in consequence of this cowardice,
administrative connivance.
A Campus Scenario
The scenario runs something like this. Different extremist groups
vie with each other in making all sorts of demands on the university
under the threat of tearing the university apart. In hopes of winning
them over or purchasing peace, the administration, often with the
support of the faculty, yields to threats, grants amnesty for previous
defiance of rules governing student conduct. The mood of peace at
any price, together with actual physical fear of harassment, become
dominant.
The extremists escalate their demands until administrations and
faculties, to avoid further confrontation, yield on issues that
politicalize the campus. The university is saved by destroying or
transforming its raison d'etre. The prestige of a handful of extremists is
thereby enhanced while those who disagree with them appear
ineffectual. Violence and the threat of violence seem to pay. When
violence gets out of hand, and measures of meeting it also get out of
hand (as at Kent State), a sense of collective guilt weakens the will to
resistance of almost all administrators and faculty bodies against
arbitrary demands to politicalize the university.
Fifth, an obvious consequence of the politicization of the
university is the erosion of academic freedom—of the right to teach
and the right to learn—of faculty and students. Once the university as
a corporate body takes a political stand, members of the faculty who
disagree with that stand are harassed.
When classes are suspended for purposes of political demonstration
or colleges are closed down by strikes, the teacher's freedom to teach
has been abridged and the right of students freely to attend their
classes destroyed. Even before recent events led some prestigious
universities to mobilize all their educational resources in order to
influence Congress to take political action, or to strike in behalf of
causes that had nothing to do with educational issues (like the Yale
strike in behalf of the Black Panthers) or to announce the closing
down of the university in the fall (as at Princeton) to permit
electioneering for so-called "peace candidates," the intimidation by
extremist students of faculty members and students had become
widespread.
Sidney hook

(The following column is the first half of a statement by Sidney
Hook, New York University professor of philosophy and head of
University Centers for Rational Alternatives. This article was sent by
President Nixon to all college presidents this fall. The second half will
be published in Monday morning's Daily.)
American colleges and universities today face the gravest crisis in
their history. Some university presidents to the contrary
notwithstanding, it is not a crisis caused by lack of money. It is a crisis
caused by the lack of a coherent educational philosophy, by a
betrayal of the primary commitment of the university to the quest for
truth and integrity in inquiry, in learning, and teaching. All the money
in the world cannot remedy the failure of nerve and intelligence
entailed by the loss of central purpose.
Nor is the crisis one of student unrest—if unrest is related to the
pursuit of an education, to interest in ideas and beliefs. Intellectual
unrest is not a problem but a virtue, and no university can have too
much of it if it is engaged in genuine educational tasks.
The problem and threat is not academic unrest but academic
disruption and violence which flow from substituting for the academic
goals of learning, the political goals of action. Some administrators
who have abetted the erosion of the academic ideal are Peeking to
muddy the waters by pretending that the public is getting fed up with
controversy, and that the chief threat to academic freedom today
comes from without and not from within. This is noisome hogwash.
The objection is not to controversy, for intellectual controversy is
the lifyof mina. The public objection is to how controversy is carried
on—to the use of bombs, arson, vandalism, physical assault and other
expressions of violent strife and turmoil.
Academic Violence
Most of the problems that plague the American campus today and
threaten its future as a genuine educational institution can be traced
to the view that unless "the major social and foreign policy problems
of our society" are met satisfactorily, campus disruption and violence
will continue. Leading university administrators have endorsed this
proposition. One of them has even proclaimed that academic violence
in part "derives from the distance separating the American dream
from the American reality."
This view and the actions that flow from it lead first to the
political polarization of the campus, then to the political alienation of
the campus from the democratic community. If unchecked it will
result in academic genocide—the destruction of academic freedom.
What is wrong with it? Many things. First, there will always be a
disparity between the American dream and reality, even if, as we raise
our sights higher, we redefine the meaning and content of that dream.
There will always be social and foreign policy problems in an open
society of uncoerced opinion, so that we are confronted by a
perspective of unending academic violence if we accept this view.
Second, it perverts the university's function, which is to study
these social and political problems and to analyze alternative
purported solutions to them. It transforms an agenda of study into an
agenda of action, and therewith converts the university into a political
organization agitating for the adoption of partisan political goals. It
not only prejudices the university's tax exempt status, but invites
political reprisals from a public that does not share its political
commitments.
Influential Fraction
Third, and most important, it violates the fundamental principles
of political democracy by threatening to resort to force and violence
unless the community adopts the solutions to social and foreign
policy problems advocated not by the majority of the electorate, but
by an elite minority.
To whose satisfaction must the "major social and foreign policy
problems of our society" be met before we have surcease of campus
violence and turmoil? Even if there were complete unanimity among
students and faculty on how these problems are to be is
far from being the case—what right would they have to make
ultimatistic demands on the community that the solutions they

advocate be adopted? Such decisions are for the representative
legislative bodies of a democracy to make.
The political process is open to students and faculty on the same
footing as all other qualified citizens to express their point of view. It
shows profound contempt on their part for democratic due process to
use or to threaten or even to condone violence, when they have failed
to persuade or convince the electorate.
Subversive Threats
Suppose the trade unionists or the farmers of the nation, who are
also minorities but much more numerous than students, were to
threaten violence unless "the major social and foreign policy problems
of our society" were met to their satisfaction? Everybody would
recognize such threats as subersive of the democratic process, as
harbingers of fascist rule no matter what the revolutionary rhetoric in
which such threats were clothed.
Fourth, actually the university community is not homogeneous.
The most militant of the student factions are small minorities. They
make no bones about their hostility to democracy, their scorn for
rational process. Their heroes are the leaders of the most ruthless
dictatorships—Lenin, Mao-Tse-tung, Castro, Ho Chi Minh, Che
Guevara. They openly declare that "our major social and foreign
problems of our society" can never be solved to their satisfaction, for
their goal is the destruction of our society. How, then account for
their influence, for their ability to create a major crisis in American
higher education?
There are many reasons. Among them are the build-up and great
publicity extremist student groups and their irresponsible leaders have
