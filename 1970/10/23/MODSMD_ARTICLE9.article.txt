## Beware Of Due Process 
###

The status of the Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) at Stanford may still be
unsettled, but one thing is perfectly clear: the
STANFORD ADMINISTRATION WILL DO
WHATEVER IT THINKS IT CAN GET
AWAY WITH.
Each year, as campus political issues reach
the stage of confrontation, moderate-liberal
leadership counsels peace and good faith.
Channels are open, they declare, and they
urge radicals to work within the established
framework.
Yet each year, when "due process" is left
to itself, beyond the range of political force,
the workable channels disappear, as the
administration carefully rolls back past
decisions. Those who opted for "peace" in
times of protest retain their "don't rock the
boat" posture (heads up their asses), leaving
campus radicals to their disorganized anger.
Those who consider this analysis harsh
should consider the history of the ROTC
issue. In February, 1969, the Academic
Senate voted to terminate ROTC credit
beginning with the class of 1974 (this year's
freshmen). Amindst the turmoil of the April
Third Movement,? the entire faculty upheld
this position. However, as interest in the
University's relationship with the War seemed

to diminish, the administration forced
through a new policy, reviving ROTC,
narrowly approved by the faculty under
severe administration pressure.
The Left's Campaign
At this point the Left mounted a campaign
to remove ROTC entirely. Under student
pressure, and shocked by the Invasion of
Cambodia, the faculty voted last May to
remove credit from ROTC (except for those
already in the program) and to phase out the
entire ROTC program.
This summer, however, as only broken
windows remained as a remander of last
Spring's activity, the University announce that
Freshmen would be able to take ROTC on
non-credit, three-year program. October 1, a
University press release headlined Richard
Lyman's statement that "A few freshmen will
take Army ROTC on a non-credit basis this
year." October 15 Lyman said, according to
the lead of an October 15 press release, that
"Freshmen are not expected to receive
academic credit for freshman level work."
As it stands now, the administration has
reversed last year's decision. Freshmen will
participate in ROTC, and will actually receive
credit for courses which arbitrarily are not
"freshman level work." Pernicious as this may

seem by itself, its real meaning is more
ominous. If the administration gets away with
this, maybe it will attempt to reinstate the
entire program next year.
PR Campaign
Perhaps as important as the university's
calculated backstepping is the public relations
campaign which has attempted to cover it.
Each time an announcement is made about
FtOTC, University news releases highlight the
anti-ROTC aspects, failing to indicate how
current announcements actually are moves
toward renewing ROTC. And, in cases, the
releases will even deliberately misrepresent
(LIE), as on October 1 or July 24.
The liberals who counsel patience in times
of crisis are now on the spot. Radicals,
dissatisfied by the narrow scope of the ROTC
issue last year, will probably react slowly,
tieing ROTC to other University involvement
in maintaining the Empire. However, as the
campus heats up fewer people will listen to
the liberals. THERE CAN BE NO "GOOD
FAITH" WHEN THE ISSUES AT HAND
REFLECT FUNDAMENTAL CONFLICTS
OF INTEREST.
