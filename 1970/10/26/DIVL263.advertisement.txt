Last spring it took an invasion into Cambodia, the executions at Kent State and
Jackson, and all the energies of the Radical Movement to stir even a fraction of
Stanford's so-called "seriously sequested, pusillanimously sensate snobs." But it
is easy to see how they re gonna keep you down on the Farm after you ve seen
reality — Nixon, Agnew, Reagan, Murphy, J. Edgar and the Mitchells (to name
a few) have reconvinced you "to do your own thing, and stop meddling into the
grown-ups' thing, or you'll get spanked.
The promise and early blooms of the spring have wilted into the apathy of the
fall, as much among the dedicated faculty as the involved student body.
Before it's too late, take some time out to consider all that you're not doing and
whether you couldn't give up some time out of your business as usual schedule to
try to make a difference in the coming elections. There are many peace candidates
who need your help. It's up to you to find out how you car. make yourself effec
