# Housing Crisis Looms As Major Issue
## 
### Bill Cooke ROBERTA FARB Bill Cooke BOB LITTERMAN 
The shortage of low and moderate income housing
in the nid-peninsula has reached crisis proportions and
is getting worse. In the words of Mid-peninsula Urban
Coalition director Ira Hall, "what you have is a
criminal situation."
In a series of articles beginning today, the Daily will
attempt to describe the problem, its causes, its effects,
and what is being done about it. The first article is an
attempt to define the low and moderate income
housing shortage, and to describe some of the
consequences in the mid-peninsula.
"The (housing) situation in the mid-Peninsula area
is particularly acute," according to Stanford's Wright
Committee report. Because of the disproportionate

Low-Cost Dwellings

demand for housing by middle and upper-income
families in this area, brought here by industrial
development and the resulting population growth, the
prices of both new and existing homes have risen far
beyond the means of moderate-income families to say
nothing of those of low income.
Prices Rising
"Many moderate-income families are now living in
homes which, at present-day prices, they could no
longer afford to buy, and which will on re-sale go to
middle-income households. In some communities,
including Palo Alto, even families earning as much as
$15,000 cannot afford to buy most homes that come
on the market.
"In other communities, the problem is aggravated
by restrictive zoning regulations requiring minimum
lot sizes. Almost invariably, new housing is built for
the middle-income market, whether it be homes for
families or apartments for couples. The result is that
low/moderate income families, as a group, are being
squeezed out of the area. Since the bulk of minority
families are in these income groups, the exclusion of
minorities is continuing at the same time."
Coalition Report
A similar view is held by the Urban Coalitionwhich
published a 1970 report which said, "The combined
effect of high new home prices, high existing home
prices, high interest, taxes and insurance charges, and
absence of a significant supply of rental units for
families, is that the moderate income families as a
group have lost the capacity to compete effectively for
housing in the Mid-Peninsula area.
"It is apparent from market prices that most
moderate income families in the area could not afford
to purchase their own homes at current prices. When
they must sell, they will be replaced in their homes by
middle-income families. Thus moderate-income

families will decline in absolute numbers, and even
faster will they decline as a percentage of the
population, which will continue to grow at a modest
rate for some time.
"The proposition of the poor, as well as their
absolute numbers, will also drop. The middle-income
demand is so strong that it not only holds
middle-income units for families at that level, but even
reaches down to take for middle-income occupancy,
homes which had been serving moderate-income
families. By the same token, mo derate-in come families
are competing for units occupied by poor families.
Furthermore, some pockets of poor-family occupancy
is blighted areas are targets for clearance by the
concerned city governments."
Vacancy Rate
One measure of demand for housing is the vacancy
rate. This figure is the percentage of total housing
units unoccupied at one point in time. According to
the Santa Clara County Housing Report of 1969, "it is
conventionally accepted by housing market analysts
that 'normal' vacancies should be about five percent
for single family houses and about seven to eight
percent for multi-family or rental units."
The mid-peninsula vacancy rate is estimated at less
than two percent, with Palo Alto probably less than
one percent. In addition, according to Janet Owens,
low income housing specialist for the Mid-Peninsula
Citizens For Fair Housing. (MCFH) "Because people
double up in many houses, if the vacancy rate is
anywhere near zero, you can almost be sure it is really
below zero."
Racial Discrimination
The low and moderate income housing shortage
also leads to an increase in the related problem of
racial discrimination. According to MCFH fair housing
director, Marylin Nyborg, "Racial discrimination has
always existed in the mid-peninsula and continues to
exist. When there is a balanced housing market people
are more likely to overlook their prejudices, but if a
landlord feels certain he can always fill his vacancies,
he is likely to be more discriminating in whom he will
rent to."
A recent MCFH survey found that 41 percent of
the apartments in Mountain View practice racial
discrimination.
Palo Alto Report
The city government of Palo Alto seems to most
observers, to have been very alow to acknowledge the
housing problem. Even so, a report this summer by the
city managers office admitted that "Palo Alto's
already short supply of low cost housing is being
diminished, primarily in and around the downtown
area, as a result of clearance, demolition and
remodeling activity."
It continued,"the average worker in Palo Alto
cannot afford to buy or rent in the community. This
increases the distance that each worker must commute

every day, and, in the absence of adequate public
transportation clogs the existing streets and creates a
demand for higher capacity traffic arteries which, in
some cases, require the demolition of housing units."
The significant problem, however, is not the
increased commuting but the inequalities of the tax
base of the surrounding communities, according to
Urban Coalition director Ira Hall. He says, "There is a
discrepancy between Palo Alto and other areas. People
who work here are required to live as far away as San
Jose, Milpitas, and Cupertino. Some people object to
the problems of commuting, such as increased smog,
but the primary objection is the disparity in the
quality of municipal services and schools.
Regional Tax Base
"If we had a regional tax base than the situation
would not be nearly as bad, but with so many small
municipalities each city must pay for its own services.
When it gets to the point where you keep bringing in
people who you can't house, you must recognize that
you are creating a bad situation somewhere else."
Hall's criticism is mild compared with that of some.
According to a Palo Alto Tenant's Union booklet,
"Palo Alto employs 12 2 percent of the county's
work force, but houses only five percent of the
county's people. 78 percent of the people who work
in Palo Alto cannot afford to live in the city. This
problem will intensify as Palo Alto's development
proceeds. ... A new, bigger, richer, and whiter Palo
Alto is being built."
Many people disagree with the tenants' union
analysis. Stanford Manager of Real Estate, Boyd
Smith, says,"I don't think Palo Alto has deliberately
excluded the laborer. Since the late fifties there has
been a large influx of low income people of various
races which has created this shortage of housing at the
low income level."
"I don't think the mid-peninsula situation is any
different than the nation wide situation. The city of
Palo Alto is a very desirable place to live ... It is that
which has driven the price of real estate up in this
area."
Charles Walker, a member of the Palo Alto city
manager's office, also feels the city has been fair. "!
would be hard pressed to show that the economic mix
is changing. I think something like 1200 families in
Palo Alto are receiving some sort of federal welfare
assistance. That seems to indicate to me that we do
have a sizable number of low income residents." Larry
Livingston, a regional planner hired by Stanford,
disagrees. "The reservoirs of low and moderate income
housing are in the city areas. We are suburbia with a
great deal of employment which exacerbates the
problem. Good quality development has always been
in effect and there has always been exclusion of poor
people from this area.
"There will never be enough low and moderate
income housing here. In the future, there will be more
jobs and less housing . .. the pinch will increase."

While many a weary commuter
across the nation faces a
one-to-two-hour marathon to work
each morning, this man mounts his
bicycle and barring pedestrian jams,
arrives five minutes later at his
classroom or office.
"This man" is a Stanford professor
or permanent staff officer—one of

Faculty Residences

2,000 inhabitants of the San Juan, Pine
Hill, Frenchman's Hill area owned by
the university.
Being but a bicycle ride away from
work is only one of many advantages
enjoyed by Stanford community
dwellers. Campus housing is so
financially attractive that it is a major
recruiting device for new faculty, notes
Robert Summers of the Stanford
Business Office.
Housing Demand Increases
As the demand for more
ho using—especially low-cost

housing—increases, Stanford's bastion
of sheltered community-living faces an
influx of diversified cultural and
occupational groups. In the past, the
lack of social and economic variety
branded the area as a "ghetto." But it
was understandably a desirable
"ghetto."
The Wright Committee Report on
University Housing, presented to the
Board of Trustees last June,
recommends that Stanford build
low-income housing for university
employees and for workers in the area.
In September, a developer was selected
to begin the first round of housing near
Frenchman's Hill. More housing will
follow as finances become available.
The ultimate goal is to integrate
subsidized housing into the faculty
section to achieve a true social mixture.
Future projects will be built on
larger tracts, and school and
playground facilities will be used by the
economically, socially, and racially
mixed community.
University Sets Example
The university hopes to set an
example for the peninsula so that other

HOME ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL
municipalties will take appropriate
action, says Professor Gordon Wright.
Many campus residents favor the
entry cf low-cost housing because it
will help modify the unrealistic picture
of life often adopted by their children.
Communications associate professor
Edwin Parker, a resident of
Frenchman's Hill, said he preferred that
his children grow up with children from
a wider range of income and
occupational groups. He would like to
see more blacks and minority groups
living in the area.
Not everyone agrees with Dr. Parker.
A petition circulated by Frenchman's
Hill residents last spring asked that the
land now earmarked for low cost
housing be reserved for "single-family,
individual unit housing which is similar
in character to that now being
constructed on Frenchman's Hill."
Proposal Studied
Business Professor William Massy, an
executive board member of the
Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association, told the Daily last night
that his organization was conducting an
impartial study of proposed
low-income housing on Site B, a section
of land adjacent to Frenchman's Hill.
The investigation will deal with such
problems as the ability of the area's
schools to absorb the additional
students such housing would bring to
the district.
Dr. Massy indicated that there was
still some faculty opposition to
building low-income housing on Site B.
The Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association was formed last year at the
height of the low-income housing
controversy.
In spite of the unincorporated status
of the Stanford housing, residents do
have a sizeable voice in community
management, says Professor Wright. In
the early days—San Juan evened in
1891—faculty members had no voice
and the area was virtually a "company
town."

The Campus Homeowners'
Association, acting as a pressure group,
can now approach the university, which
administers its residential community
with a city-manager type of
government. Talk of annexation to Palo
Alto persists, however. Some residents
favor the latter proposal because it
assures elected representation unlike
the Homeowners' Association, which
acts solely as an advisory body.
Yet few faculty members can pass
up the fringe benefits attached to
campus housing. Permanent faculty
members with the rank of professor,
associate professor, or assistant
professor are presently eligible to own
campus homes. After three years of
employment, permanent staff officers
of equivalent rank may be approved for
ownership eligiblity by the president of
the university.
Flexible Loan Program
A flexible loan program provides for
construction, purchase, remodeling,
and repair of homes. Interest rates for
new loans are one percentage point
below mortgage rates for comparable
single-family residences in the local
commercial market.
Although the maximum loan for
new construction is normally 90
percent of the actual cost, the President
may authorize loans up to 100 percent,
if the borrower demonstrates genuine
financial need.
A ground lease entitles the holder to
the use of the improvements on the
leased property for the eighty year
term of the lease. Community services
are maintained through a ground rent
charge.
Campus homes must remain in the
Stanford family. Departing
homeowners must sell their residences
to another eligible faculty or staff
member.
This rule, explains Professor Wright
also applies to families of divorced
faculty members.

land now earmarked for low cost
housing be reserved for "single-family,
individual unit housing which is similar
in character to that now being
constructed on Frenchman's Hill."
Proposal Studied
Business Professor William Massy, an
executive board member of the
Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association, told the Daily last night
that his organization was conducting an
impartial study of proposed
low-income housing on Site B, a section
of land adjacent to Frenchman's Hill.
The investigation will deal with such
problems as the ability of the area's
schools to absorb the additional
students such housing would bring to
the district.
Dr. Massy indicated that there was
still some faculty opposition to
building low-income housing on Site B.
The Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association was formed last year at the
height of the low-income housing
controversy.
In spite of the unincorporated status
of the Stanford housing, residents do
have a sizeable voice in community
management, says Professor Wright. In
the early days—San Juan evened in
1891—faculty members had no voice
and the area was virtually a "company
town."

The Campus Homeowners'
Association, acting as a pressure group,
can now approach the university, which
administers its residential community
with a city-manager type of
government. Talk of annexation to Palo
Alto persists, however. Some residents
favor the latter proposal because it
assures elected representation unlike
the Homeowners' Association, which
acts solely as an advisory body.
Yet few faculty members can pass
up the fringe benefits attached to
campus housing. Permanent faculty
members with the rank of professor,
associate professor, or assistant
professor are presently eligible to own
campus homes. After three years of
employment, permanent staff officers
of equivalent rank may be approved for
ownership eligiblity by the president of
the university.
Flexible Loan Program

construction, purchase, remodeling,
and repair of homes. Interest rates for
new loans are one percentage point

The shortage of low and moderate income housing
in the nid-peninsula has reached crisis proportions and
is getting worse. In the words of Mid-peninsula Urban
Coalition director Ira Hall, "what you have is a
criminal situation."
In a series of articles beginning today, the Daily will
attempt to describe the problem, its causes, its effects,
and what is being done about it. The first article is an
attempt to define the low and moderate income
housing shortage, and to describe some of the
consequences in the mid-peninsula.
"The (housing) situation in the mid-Peninsula area
is particularly acute," according to Stanford's Wright
Committee report. Because of the disproportionate

Low-Cost Dwellings

demand for housing by middle and upper-income
families in this area, brought here by industrial
development and the resulting population growth, the
prices of both new and existing homes have risen far
beyond the means of moderate-income families to say
nothing of those of low income.
Prices Rising
"Many moderate-income families are now living in
homes which, at present-day prices, they could no
longer afford to buy, and which will on re-sale go to
middle-income households. In some communities,
including Palo Alto, even families earning as much as
$15,000 cannot afford to buy most homes that come
on the market.
"In other communities, the problem is aggravated
by restrictive zoning regulations requiring minimum
lot sizes. Almost invariably, new housing is built for
the middle-income market, whether it be homes for
families or apartments for couples. The result is that
low/moderate income families, as a group, are being
squeezed out of the area. Since the bulk of minority
families are in these income groups, the exclusion of
minorities is continuing at the same time."
Coalition Report
A similar view is held by the Urban Coalitionwhich
published a 1970 report which said, "The combined
effect of high new home prices, high existing home
prices, high interest, taxes and insurance charges, and
absence of a significant supply of rental units for
families, is that the moderate income families as a
group have lost the capacity to compete effectively for
housing in the Mid-Peninsula area.
"It is apparent from market prices that most
moderate income families in the area could not afford
to purchase their own homes at current prices. When
they must sell, they will be replaced in their homes by
middle-income families. Thus moderate-income

families will decline in absolute numbers, and even
faster will they decline as a percentage of the
population, which will continue to grow at a modest
rate for some time.
"The proposition of the poor, as well as their
absolute numbers, will also drop. The middle-income
demand is so strong that it not only holds
middle-income units for families at that level, but even
reaches down to take for middle-income occupancy,
homes which had been serving moderate-income
families. By the same token, mo derate-in come families
are competing for units occupied by poor families.
Furthermore, some pockets of poor-family occupancy
is blighted areas are targets for clearance by the
concerned city governments."
Vacancy Rate
One measure of demand for housing is the vacancy
rate. This figure is the percentage of total housing
units unoccupied at one point in time. According to
the Santa Clara County Housing Report of 1969, "it is
conventionally accepted by housing market analysts
that 'normal' vacancies should be about five percent
for single family houses and about seven to eight
percent for multi-family or rental units."
The mid-peninsula vacancy rate is estimated at less
than two percent, with Palo Alto probably less than
one percent. In addition, according to Janet Owens,
low income housing specialist for the Mid-Peninsula
Citizens For Fair Housing. (MCFH) "Because people
double up in many houses, if the vacancy rate is
anywhere near zero, you can almost be sure it is really
below zero."
Racial Discrimination
The low and moderate income housing shortage
also leads to an increase in the related problem of
racial discrimination. According to MCFH fair housing
director, Marylin Nyborg, "Racial discrimination has
always existed in the mid-peninsula and continues to
exist. When there is a balanced housing market people
are more likely to overlook their prejudices, but if a
landlord feels certain he can always fill his vacancies,
he is likely to be more discriminating in whom he will
rent to."
A recent MCFH survey found that 41 percent of
the apartments in Mountain View practice racial
discrimination.
Palo Alto Report
The city government of Palo Alto seems to most
observers, to have been very alow to acknowledge the
housing problem. Even so, a report this summer by the
city managers office admitted that "Palo Alto's
already short supply of low cost housing is being
diminished, primarily in and around the downtown
area, as a result of clearance, demolition and
remodeling activity."
It continued,"the average worker in Palo Alto
cannot afford to buy or rent in the community. This
increases the distance that each worker must commute

every day, and, in the absence of adequate public
transportation clogs the existing streets and creates a
demand for higher capacity traffic arteries which, in
some cases, require the demolition of housing units."
The significant problem, however, is not the
increased commuting but the inequalities of the tax
base of the surrounding communities, according to
Urban Coalition director Ira Hall. He says, "There is a
discrepancy between Palo Alto and other areas. People
who work here are required to live as far away as San
Jose, Milpitas, and Cupertino. Some people object to
the problems of commuting, such as increased smog,
but the primary objection is the disparity in the
quality of municipal services and schools.
Regional Tax Base
"If we had a regional tax base than the situation
would not be nearly as bad, but with so many small
municipalities each city must pay for its own services.
When it gets to the point where you keep bringing in
people who you can't house, you must recognize that
you are creating a bad situation somewhere else."
Hall's criticism is mild compared with that of some.
According to a Palo Alto Tenant's Union booklet,
"Palo Alto employs 12 2 percent of the county's
work force, but houses only five percent of the
county's people. 78 percent of the people who work
in Palo Alto cannot afford to live in the city. This
problem will intensify as Palo Alto's development
proceeds. ... A new, bigger, richer, and whiter Palo
Alto is being built."
Many people disagree with the tenants' union
analysis. Stanford Manager of Real Estate, Boyd
Smith, says,"I don't think Palo Alto has deliberately
excluded the laborer. Since the late fifties there has
been a large influx of low income people of various
races which has created this shortage of housing at the
low income level."
"I don't think the mid-peninsula situation is any
different than the nation wide situation. The city of
Palo Alto is a very desirable place to live ... It is that
which has driven the price of real estate up in this
area."
Charles Walker, a member of the Palo Alto city
manager's office, also feels the city has been fair. "!
would be hard pressed to show that the economic mix
is changing. I think something like 1200 families in
Palo Alto are receiving some sort of federal welfare
assistance. That seems to indicate to me that we do
have a sizable number of low income residents." Larry
Livingston, a regional planner hired by Stanford,
disagrees. "The reservoirs of low and moderate income
housing are in the city areas. We are suburbia with a
great deal of employment which exacerbates the
problem. Good quality development has always been
in effect and there has always been exclusion of poor
people from this area.
"There will never be enough low and moderate
income housing here. In the future, there will be more
jobs and less housing . .. the pinch will increase."

While many a weary commuter
across the nation faces a
one-to-two-hour marathon to work
each morning, this man mounts his
bicycle and barring pedestrian jams,
arrives five minutes later at his
classroom or office.
"This man" is a Stanford professor
or permanent staff officer—one of

Faculty Residences

2,000 inhabitants of the San Juan, Pine
Hill, Frenchman's Hill area owned by
the university.
Being but a bicycle ride away from
work is only one of many advantages
enjoyed by Stanford community
dwellers. Campus housing is so
financially attractive that it is a major
recruiting device for new faculty, notes
Robert Summers of the Stanford
Business Office.
Housing Demand Increases
As the demand for more
ho using—especially low-cost

housing—increases, Stanford's bastion
of sheltered community-living faces an
influx of diversified cultural and
occupational groups. In the past, the
lack of social and economic variety
branded the area as a "ghetto." But it
was understandably a desirable
"ghetto."
The Wright Committee Report on
University Housing, presented to the
Board of Trustees last June,
recommends that Stanford build
low-income housing for university
employees and for workers in the area.
In September, a developer was selected
to begin the first round of housing near
Frenchman's Hill. More housing will
follow as finances become available.
The ultimate goal is to integrate
subsidized housing into the faculty
section to achieve a true social mixture.
Future projects will be built on
larger tracts, and school and
playground facilities will be used by the
economically, socially, and racially
mixed community.

example for the peninsula so that other

beyond the means of moderate-income families to say
nothing of those of low income.
Prices Rising
"Many moderate-income families are now living in
homes which, at present-day prices, they could no
longer afford to buy, and which will on re-sale go to
middle-income households. In some communities,
including Palo Alto, even families earning as much as
$15,000 cannot afford to buy most homes that come
on the market.
"In other communities, the problem is aggravated
by restrictive zoning regulations requiring minimum
lot sizes. Almost invariably, new housing is built for
the middle-income market, whether it be homes for
families or apartments for couples. The result is that
low/moderate income families, as a group, are being
squeezed out of the area. Since the bulk of minority
families are in these income groups, the exclusion of
minorities is continuing at the same time."
Coalition Report
A similar view is held by the Urban Coalitionwhich
published a 1970 report which said, "The combined
effect of high new home prices, high existing home
prices, high interest, taxes and insurance charges, and
absence of a significant supply of rental units for
families, is that the moderate income families as a
group have lost the capacity to compete effectively for
housing in the Mid-Peninsula area.
"It is apparent from market prices that most
moderate income families in the area could not afford
to purchase their own homes at current prices. When
they must sell, they will be replaced in their homes by
middle-income families. Thus moderate-income

families will decline in absolute numbers, and even
faster will they decline as a percentage of the
population, which will continue to grow at a modest
rate for some time.
"The proposition of the poor, as well as their
absolute numbers, will also drop. The middle-income
demand is so strong that it not only holds
middle-income units for families at that level, but even
reaches down to take for middle-income occupancy,
homes which had been serving moderate-income
families. By the same token, mo derate-in come families
are competing for units occupied by poor families.
Furthermore, some pockets of poor-family occupancy
is blighted areas are targets for clearance by the
concerned city governments."
Vacancy Rate
One measure of demand for housing is the vacancy
rate. This figure is the percentage of total housing
units unoccupied at one point in time. According to
the Santa Clara County Housing Report of 1969, "it is
conventionally accepted by housing market analysts
that 'normal' vacancies should be about five percent
for single family houses and about seven to eight
percent for multi-family or rental units."
The mid-peninsula vacancy rate is estimated at less
than two percent, with Palo Alto probably less than
one percent. In addition, according to Janet Owens,
low income housing specialist for the Mid-Peninsula
Citizens For Fair Housing. (MCFH) "Because people
double up in many houses, if the vacancy rate is
anywhere near zero, you can almost be sure it is really
below zero."
Racial Discrimination
The low and moderate income housing shortage
also leads to an increase in the related problem of
racial discrimination. According to MCFH fair housing
director, Marylin Nyborg, "Racial discrimination has
always existed in the mid-peninsula and continues to
exist. When there is a balanced housing market people
are more likely to overlook their prejudices, but if a
landlord feels certain he can always fill his vacancies,
he is likely to be more discriminating in whom he will
rent to."
A recent MCFH survey found that 41 percent of
the apartments in Mountain View practice racial
discrimination.
Palo Alto Report
The city government of Palo Alto seems to most
observers, to have been very alow to acknowledge the
housing problem. Even so, a report this summer by the
city managers office admitted that "Palo Alto's
already short supply of low cost housing is being
diminished, primarily in and around the downtown
area, as a result of clearance, demolition and
remodeling activity."
It continued,"the average worker in Palo Alto
cannot afford to buy or rent in the community. This
increases the distance that each worker must commute

every day, and, in the absence of adequate public
transportation clogs the existing streets and creates a
demand for higher capacity traffic arteries which, in
some cases, require the demolition of housing units."
The significant problem, however, is not the
increased commuting but the inequalities of the tax
base of the surrounding communities, according to
Urban Coalition director Ira Hall. He says, "There is a
discrepancy between Palo Alto and other areas. People
who work here are required to live as far away as San
Jose, Milpitas, and Cupertino. Some people object to
the problems of commuting, such as increased smog,
but the primary objection is the disparity in the
quality of municipal services and schools.
Regional Tax Base
"If we had a regional tax base than the situation
would not be nearly as bad, but with so many small
municipalities each city must pay for its own services.
When it gets to the point where you keep bringing in
people who you can't house, you must recognize that
you are creating a bad situation somewhere else."
Hall's criticism is mild compared with that of some.
According to a Palo Alto Tenant's Union booklet,
"Palo Alto employs 12 2 percent of the county's
work force, but houses only five percent of the
county's people. 78 percent of the people who work
in Palo Alto cannot afford to live in the city. This
problem will intensify as Palo Alto's development
proceeds. ... A new, bigger, richer, and whiter Palo
Alto is being built."
Many people disagree with the tenants' union
analysis. Stanford Manager of Real Estate, Boyd
Smith, says,"I don't think Palo Alto has deliberately
excluded the laborer. Since the late fifties there has
been a large influx of low income people of various
races which has created this shortage of housing at the
low income level."
"I don't think the mid-peninsula situation is any
different than the nation wide situation. The city of
Palo Alto is a very desirable place to live ... It is that
which has driven the price of real estate up in this
area."
Charles Walker, a member of the Palo Alto city
manager's office, also feels the city has been fair. "!
would be hard pressed to show that the economic mix
is changing. I think something like 1200 families in
Palo Alto are receiving some sort of federal welfare
assistance. That seems to indicate to me that we do
have a sizable number of low income residents." Larry
Livingston, a regional planner hired by Stanford,
disagrees. "The reservoirs of low and moderate income
housing are in the city areas. We are suburbia with a
great deal of employment which exacerbates the
problem. Good quality development has always been
in effect and there has always been exclusion of poor
people from this area.
"There will never be enough low and moderate
income housing here. In the future, there will be more
jobs and less housing . .. the pinch will increase."

While many a weary commuter
across the nation faces a
one-to-two-hour marathon to work
each morning, this man mounts his
bicycle and barring pedestrian jams,
arrives five minutes later at his
classroom or office.
"This man" is a Stanford professor
or permanent staff officer—one of

Faculty Residences

2,000 inhabitants of the San Juan, Pine
Hill, Frenchman's Hill area owned by
the university.
Being but a bicycle ride away from
work is only one of many advantages
enjoyed by Stanford community
dwellers. Campus housing is so
financially attractive that it is a major
recruiting device for new faculty, notes
Robert Summers of the Stanford
Business Office.
Housing Demand Increases
As the demand for more
ho using—especially low-cost

housing—increases, Stanford's bastion
of sheltered community-living faces an
influx of diversified cultural and
occupational groups. In the past, the
lack of social and economic variety
branded the area as a "ghetto." But it
was understandably a desirable
"ghetto."
The Wright Committee Report on
University Housing, presented to the
Board of Trustees last June,
recommends that Stanford build
low-income housing for university
employees and for workers in the area.
In September, a developer was selected
to begin the first round of housing near
Frenchman's Hill. More housing will
follow as finances become available.
The ultimate goal is to integrate
subsidized housing into the faculty
section to achieve a true social mixture.
Future projects will be built on
larger tracts, and school and
playground facilities will be used by the
economically, socially, and racially
mixed community.
University Sets Example
The university hopes to set an
example for the peninsula so that other

HOME ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL
municipalties will take appropriate
action, says Professor Gordon Wright.
Many campus residents favor the
entry cf low-cost housing because it
will help modify the unrealistic picture
of life often adopted by their children.
Communications associate professor
Edwin Parker, a resident of
Frenchman's Hill, said he preferred that
his children grow up with children from
a wider range of income and
occupational groups. He would like to
see more blacks and minority groups
living in the area.
Not everyone agrees with Dr. Parker.
A petition circulated by Frenchman's
Hill residents last spring asked that the
land now earmarked for low cost
housing be reserved for "single-family,
individual unit housing which is similar
in character to that now being
constructed on Frenchman's Hill."
Proposal Studied
Business Professor William Massy, an
executive board member of the
Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association, told the Daily last night
that his organization was conducting an
impartial study of proposed
low-income housing on Site B, a section
of land adjacent to Frenchman's Hill.
The investigation will deal with such
problems as the ability of the area's
schools to absorb the additional
students such housing would bring to
the district.
Dr. Massy indicated that there was
still some faculty opposition to
building low-income housing on Site B.
The Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association was formed last year at the
height of the low-income housing
controversy.
In spite of the unincorporated status
of the Stanford housing, residents do
have a sizeable voice in community
management, says Professor Wright. In
the early days—San Juan evened in
1891—faculty members had no voice
and the area was virtually a "company
town."

The Campus Homeowners'
Association, acting as a pressure group,
can now approach the university, which
administers its residential community
with a city-manager type of
government. Talk of annexation to Palo
Alto persists, however. Some residents
favor the latter proposal because it
assures elected representation unlike
the Homeowners' Association, which
acts solely as an advisory body.
Yet few faculty members can pass
up the fringe benefits attached to
campus housing. Permanent faculty
members with the rank of professor,
associate professor, or assistant
professor are presently eligible to own
campus homes. After three years of
employment, permanent staff officers
of equivalent rank may be approved for
ownership eligiblity by the president of
the university.
Flexible Loan Program
A flexible loan program provides for
construction, purchase, remodeling,
and repair of homes. Interest rates for
new loans are one percentage point
below mortgage rates for comparable
single-family residences in the local
commercial market.
Although the maximum loan for
new construction is normally 90
percent of the actual cost, the President
may authorize loans up to 100 percent,
if the borrower demonstrates genuine
financial need.
A ground lease entitles the holder to
the use of the improvements on the
leased property for the eighty year
term of the lease. Community services
are maintained through a ground rent
charge.
Campus homes must remain in the
Stanford family. Departing
homeowners must sell their residences
to another eligible faculty or staff
member.
This rule, explains Professor Wright
also applies to families of divorced
faculty members.
The shortage of low and moderate income housing
in the nid-peninsula has reached crisis proportions and
is getting worse. In the words of Mid-peninsula Urban
Coalition director Ira Hall, "what you have is a
criminal situation."
In a series of articles beginning today, the Daily will
attempt to describe the problem, its causes, its effects,
and what is being done about it. The first article is an
attempt to define the low and moderate income
housing shortage, and to describe some of the
consequences in the mid-peninsula.
"The (housing) situation in the mid-Peninsula area
is particularly acute," according to Stanford's Wright
Committee report. Because of the disproportionate

Low-Cost Dwellings

demand for housing by middle and upper-income
families in this area, brought here by industrial
development and the resulting population growth, the
prices of both new and existing homes have risen far
beyond the means of moderate-income families to say
nothing of those of low income.
Prices Rising
"Many moderate-income families are now living in

Housing Demand Increases
As the demand for more
ho using—especially low-cost

housing—increases, Stanford's bastion
of sheltered community-living faces an
influx of diversified cultural and

lack of social and economic variety
branded the area as a "ghetto." But it
was understandably a desirable

The Wright Committee Report on

recommends that Stanford build
low-income housing for university
employees and for workers in the area.

municipalties will take appropriate
action, says Professor Gordon Wright.
Many campus residents favor the
entry cf low-cost housing because it
will help modify the unrealistic picture
of life often adopted by their children.
Communications associate professor
Edwin Parker, a resident of
Frenchman's Hill, said he preferred that
his children grow up with children from
a wider range of income and
occupational groups. He would like to
see more blacks and minority groups
living in the area.
Not everyone agrees with Dr. Parker.
A petition circulated by Frenchman's
Hill residents last spring asked that the
land now earmarked for low cost
housing be reserved for "single-family,
individual unit housing which is similar
in character to that now being
constructed on Frenchman's Hill."
Proposal Studied
Business Professor William Massy, an
executive board member of the
Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association, told the Daily last night
that his organization was conducting an
impartial study of proposed
low-income housing on Site B, a section
of land adjacent to Frenchman's Hill.
The investigation will deal with such
problems as the ability of the area's
schools to absorb the additional
students such housing would bring to
the district.
Dr. Massy indicated that there was
still some faculty opposition to
building low-income housing on Site B.
The Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association was formed last year at the
height of the low-income housing
controversy.
In spite of the unincorporated status
of the Stanford housing, residents do
have a sizeable voice in community
management, says Professor Wright. In
the early days—San Juan evened in
1891—faculty members had no voice
and the area was virtually a "company
town."

The Campus Homeowners'
Association, acting as a pressure group,
can now approach the university, which
administers its residential community
with a city-manager type of
government. Talk of annexation to Palo
Alto persists, however. Some residents
favor the latter proposal because it
assures elected representation unlike
the Homeowners' Association, which
acts solely as an advisory body.
Yet few faculty members can pass
up the fringe benefits attached to
campus housing. Permanent faculty
members with the rank of professor,
associate professor, or assistant
professor are presently eligible to own
campus homes. After three years of
employment, permanent staff officers
of equivalent rank may be approved for
ownership eligiblity by the president of
the university.
Flexible Loan Program
A flexible loan program provides for
construction, purchase, remodeling,
and repair of homes. Interest rates for
new loans are one percentage point
below mortgage rates for comparable
single-family residences in the local
commercial market.
Although the maximum loan for
new construction is normally 90
percent of the actual cost, the President
may authorize loans up to 100 percent,
if the borrower demonstrates genuine
financial need.
A ground lease entitles the holder to
the use of the improvements on the
leased property for the eighty year
term of the lease. Community services
are maintained through a ground rent
charge.
Campus homes must remain in the
Stanford family. Departing
homeowners must sell their residences
to another eligible faculty or staff
member.
This rule, explains Professor Wright
also applies to families of divorced
faculty members.
The shortage of low and moderate income housing
in the nid-peninsula has reached crisis proportions and
is getting worse. In the words of Mid-peninsula Urban
Coalition director Ira Hall, "what you have is a
criminal situation."
In a series of articles beginning today, the Daily will
attempt to describe the problem, its causes, its effects,
and what is being done about it. The first article is an
attempt to define the low and moderate income
housing shortage, and to describe some of the
consequences in the mid-peninsula.
"The (housing) situation in the mid-Peninsula area
is particularly acute," according to Stanford's Wright
Committee report. Because of the disproportionate

Low-Cost Dwellings

demand for housing by middle and upper-income
families in this area, brought here by industrial
development and the resulting population growth, the
prices of both new and existing homes have risen far
beyond the means of moderate-income families to say
nothing of those of low income.
Prices Rising
"Many moderate-income families are now living in
homes which, at present-day prices, they could no
longer afford to buy, and which will on re-sale go to
middle-income households. In some communities,
including Palo Alto, even families earning as much as
$15,000 cannot afford to buy most homes that come
on the market.
"In other communities, the problem is aggravated
by restrictive zoning regulations requiring minimum
lot sizes. Almost invariably, new housing is built for
the middle-income market, whether it be homes for
families or apartments for couples. The result is that
low/moderate income families, as a group, are being
squeezed out of the area. Since the bulk of minority
families are in these income groups, the exclusion of
minorities is continuing at the same time."
Coalition Report
A similar view is held by the Urban Coalitionwhich
published a 1970 report which said, "The combined
effect of high new home prices, high existing home
prices, high interest, taxes and insurance charges, and
absence of a significant supply of rental units for
families, is that the moderate income families as a
group have lost the capacity to compete effectively for
housing in the Mid-Peninsula area.
"It is apparent from market prices that most
moderate income families in the area could not afford
to purchase their own homes at current prices. When
they must sell, they will be replaced in their homes by
middle-income families. Thus moderate-income

families will decline in absolute numbers, and even
faster will they decline as a percentage of the
population, which will continue to grow at a modest
rate for some time.
"The proposition of the poor, as well as their
absolute numbers, will also drop. The middle-income
demand is so strong that it not only holds
middle-income units for families at that level, but even
reaches down to take for middle-income occupancy,
homes which had been serving moderate-income
families. By the same token, mo derate-in come families
are competing for units occupied by poor families.
Furthermore, some pockets of poor-family occupancy
is blighted areas are targets for clearance by the
concerned city governments."
Vacancy Rate
One measure of demand for housing is the vacancy
rate. This figure is the percentage of total housing
units unoccupied at one point in time. According to
the Santa Clara County Housing Report of 1969, "it is
conventionally accepted by housing market analysts
that 'normal' vacancies should be about five percent
for single family houses and about seven to eight
percent for multi-family or rental units."
The mid-peninsula vacancy rate is estimated at less
than two percent, with Palo Alto probably less than
one percent. In addition, according to Janet Owens,
low income housing specialist for the Mid-Peninsula
Citizens For Fair Housing. (MCFH) "Because people
double up in many houses, if the vacancy rate is
anywhere near zero, you can almost be sure it is really
below zero."
Racial Discrimination
The low and moderate income housing shortage
also leads to an increase in the related problem of
racial discrimination. According to MCFH fair housing
director, Marylin Nyborg, "Racial discrimination has
always existed in the mid-peninsula and continues to
exist. When there is a balanced housing market people
are more likely to overlook their prejudices, but if a
landlord feels certain he can always fill his vacancies,
he is likely to be more discriminating in whom he will
rent to."
A recent MCFH survey found that 41 percent of
the apartments in Mountain View practice racial
discrimination.
Palo Alto Report
The city government of Palo Alto seems to most
observers, to have been very alow to acknowledge the
housing problem. Even so, a report this summer by the
city managers office admitted that "Palo Alto's
already short supply of low cost housing is being
diminished, primarily in and around the downtown
area, as a result of clearance, demolition and
remodeling activity."
It continued,"the average worker in Palo Alto
cannot afford to buy or rent in the community. This
increases the distance that each worker must commute

every day, and, in the absence of adequate public
transportation clogs the existing streets and creates a
demand for higher capacity traffic arteries which, in
some cases, require the demolition of housing units."
The significant problem, however, is not the
increased commuting but the inequalities of the tax
base of the surrounding communities, according to
Urban Coalition director Ira Hall. He says, "There is a
discrepancy between Palo Alto and other areas. People
who work here are required to live as far away as San
Jose, Milpitas, and Cupertino. Some people object to
the problems of commuting, such as increased smog,
but the primary objection is the disparity in the
quality of municipal services and schools.
Regional Tax Base
"If we had a regional tax base than the situation
would not be nearly as bad, but with so many small
municipalities each city must pay for its own services.
When it gets to the point where you keep bringing in
people who you can't house, you must recognize that
you are creating a bad situation somewhere else."
Hall's criticism is mild compared with that of some.
According to a Palo Alto Tenant's Union booklet,
"Palo Alto employs 12 2 percent of the county's
work force, but houses only five percent of the
county's people. 78 percent of the people who work
in Palo Alto cannot afford to live in the city. This
problem will intensify as Palo Alto's development
proceeds. ... A new, bigger, richer, and whiter Palo
Alto is being built."
Many people disagree with the tenants' union
analysis. Stanford Manager of Real Estate, Boyd
Smith, says,"I don't think Palo Alto has deliberately
excluded the laborer. Since the late fifties there has
been a large influx of low income people of various
races which has created this shortage of housing at the
low income level."
"I don't think the mid-peninsula situation is any
different than the nation wide situation. The city of
Palo Alto is a very desirable place to live ... It is that
which has driven the price of real estate up in this
area."
Charles Walker, a member of the Palo Alto city
manager's office, also feels the city has been fair. "!
would be hard pressed to show that the economic mix
is changing. I think something like 1200 families in
Palo Alto are receiving some sort of federal welfare
assistance. That seems to indicate to me that we do
have a sizable number of low income residents." Larry
Livingston, a regional planner hired by Stanford,
disagrees. "The reservoirs of low and moderate income
housing are in the city areas. We are suburbia with a
great deal of employment which exacerbates the
problem. Good quality development has always been
in effect and there has always been exclusion of poor
people from this area.
"There will never be enough low and moderate
income housing here. In the future, there will be more
jobs and less housing . .. the pinch will increase."

minorities is continuing at the same time."
Coalition Report
A similar view is held by the Urban Coalitionwhich
published a 1970 report which said, "The combined
effect of high new home prices, high existing home
prices, high interest, taxes and insurance charges, and
absence of a significant supply of rental units for
families, is that the moderate income families as a
group have lost the capacity to compete effectively for
housing in the Mid-Peninsula area.
"It is apparent from market prices that most
moderate income families in the area could not afford
to purchase their own homes at current prices. When
they must sell, they will be replaced in their homes by
middle-income families. Thus moderate-income

families will decline in absolute numbers, and even
faster will they decline as a percentage of the
population, which will continue to grow at a modest
rate for some time.
"The proposition of the poor, as well as their
absolute numbers, will also drop. The middle-income
demand is so strong that it not only holds
middle-income units for families at that level, but even
reaches down to take for middle-income occupancy,
homes which had been serving moderate-income
families. By the same token, mo derate-in come families
are competing for units occupied by poor families.
Furthermore, some pockets of poor-family occupancy
is blighted areas are targets for clearance by the
concerned city governments."
Vacancy Rate
One measure of demand for housing is the vacancy
rate. This figure is the percentage of total housing
units unoccupied at one point in time. According to
the Santa Clara County Housing Report of 1969, "it is
conventionally accepted by housing market analysts
that 'normal' vacancies should be about five percent
for single family houses and about seven to eight
percent for multi-family or rental units."
The mid-peninsula vacancy rate is estimated at less
than two percent, with Palo Alto probably less than
one percent. In addition, according to Janet Owens,
low income housing specialist for the Mid-Peninsula
Citizens For Fair Housing. (MCFH) "Because people
double up in many houses, if the vacancy rate is
anywhere near zero, you can almost be sure it is really
below zero."
Racial Discrimination
The low and moderate income housing shortage
also leads to an increase in the related problem of
racial discrimination. According to MCFH fair housing
director, Marylin Nyborg, "Racial discrimination has
always existed in the mid-peninsula and continues to
exist. When there is a balanced housing market people
are more likely to overlook their prejudices, but if a
landlord feels certain he can always fill his vacancies,
he is likely to be more discriminating in whom he will
rent to."
A recent MCFH survey found that 41 percent of
the apartments in Mountain View practice racial
discrimination.
Palo Alto Report
The city government of Palo Alto seems to most
observers, to have been very alow to acknowledge the
housing problem. Even so, a report this summer by the
city managers office admitted that "Palo Alto's
already short supply of low cost housing is being
diminished, primarily in and around the downtown
area, as a result of clearance, demolition and
remodeling activity."
It continued,"the average worker in Palo Alto
cannot afford to buy or rent in the community. This
increases the distance that each worker must commute

every day, and, in the absence of adequate public
transportation clogs the existing streets and creates a
demand for higher capacity traffic arteries which, in
some cases, require the demolition of housing units."
The significant problem, however, is not the
increased commuting but the inequalities of the tax
base of the surrounding communities, according to
Urban Coalition director Ira Hall. He says, "There is a
discrepancy between Palo Alto and other areas. People
who work here are required to live as far away as San
Jose, Milpitas, and Cupertino. Some people object to
the problems of commuting, such as increased smog,
but the primary objection is the disparity in the
quality of municipal services and schools.
Regional Tax Base
"If we had a regional tax base than the situation
would not be nearly as bad, but with so many small
municipalities each city must pay for its own services.
When it gets to the point where you keep bringing in
people who you can't house, you must recognize that
you are creating a bad situation somewhere else."
Hall's criticism is mild compared with that of some.
According to a Palo Alto Tenant's Union booklet,
"Palo Alto employs 12 2 percent of the county's
work force, but houses only five percent of the
county's people. 78 percent of the people who work
in Palo Alto cannot afford to live in the city. This
problem will intensify as Palo Alto's development
proceeds. ... A new, bigger, richer, and whiter Palo
Alto is being built."
Many people disagree with the tenants' union
analysis. Stanford Manager of Real Estate, Boyd
Smith, says,"I don't think Palo Alto has deliberately
excluded the laborer. Since the late fifties there has
been a large influx of low income people of various
races which has created this shortage of housing at the
low income level."
"I don't think the mid-peninsula situation is any
different than the nation wide situation. The city of
Palo Alto is a very desirable place to live ... It is that
which has driven the price of real estate up in this
area."
Charles Walker, a member of the Palo Alto city
manager's office, also feels the city has been fair. "!
would be hard pressed to show that the economic mix
is changing. I think something like 1200 families in
Palo Alto are receiving some sort of federal welfare
assistance. That seems to indicate to me that we do
have a sizable number of low income residents." Larry
Livingston, a regional planner hired by Stanford,
disagrees. "The reservoirs of low and moderate income
housing are in the city areas. We are suburbia with a
great deal of employment which exacerbates the
problem. Good quality development has always been
in effect and there has always been exclusion of poor
people from this area.
"There will never be enough low and moderate
income housing here. In the future, there will be more
jobs and less housing . .. the pinch will increase."

While many a weary commuter
across the nation faces a
one-to-two-hour marathon to work
each morning, this man mounts his
bicycle and barring pedestrian jams,
arrives five minutes later at his
classroom or office.
"This man" is a Stanford professor
or permanent staff officer—one of

2,000 inhabitants of the San Juan, Pine
Hill, Frenchman's Hill area owned by
the university.
Being but a bicycle ride away from
work is only one of many advantages
enjoyed by Stanford community
dwellers. Campus housing is so
financially attractive that it is a major
recruiting device for new faculty, notes
Robert Summers of the Stanford
Business Office.
Housing Demand Increases
As the demand for more
ho using—especially low-cost

housing—increases, Stanford's bastion
of sheltered community-living faces an
influx of diversified cultural and
occupational groups. In the past, the
lack of social and economic variety
branded the area as a "ghetto." But it
was understandably a desirable
"ghetto."
The Wright Committee Report on
University Housing, presented to the
Board of Trustees last June,
recommends that Stanford build
low-income housing for university
employees and for workers in the area.
In September, a developer was selected
to begin the first round of housing near
Frenchman's Hill. More housing will
follow as finances become available.
The ultimate goal is to integrate
subsidized housing into the faculty
section to achieve a true social mixture.
Future projects will be built on
larger tracts, and school and
playground facilities will be used by the
economically, socially, and racially
mixed community.
University Sets Example
The university hopes to set an
example for the peninsula so that other

HOME ON FRENCHMAN'S HILL
municipalties will take appropriate
action, says Professor Gordon Wright.
Many campus residents favor the
entry cf low-cost housing because it
will help modify the unrealistic picture
of life often adopted by their children.
Communications associate professor
Edwin Parker, a resident of
Frenchman's Hill, said he preferred that
his children grow up with children from
a wider range of income and
occupational groups. He would like to
see more blacks and minority groups
living in the area.
Not everyone agrees with Dr. Parker.
A petition circulated by Frenchman's
Hill residents last spring asked that the
land now earmarked for low cost
housing be reserved for "single-family,
individual unit housing which is similar
in character to that now being
constructed on Frenchman's Hill."
Proposal Studied
Business Professor William Massy, an
executive board member of the
Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association, told the Daily last night
that his organization was conducting an
impartial study of proposed
low-income housing on Site B, a section
of land adjacent to Frenchman's Hill.
The investigation will deal with such
problems as the ability of the area's
schools to absorb the additional
students such housing would bring to
the district.
Dr. Massy indicated that there was
still some faculty opposition to
building low-income housing on Site B.
The Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association was formed last year at the
height of the low-income housing
controversy.
In spite of the unincorporated status
of the Stanford housing, residents do
have a sizeable voice in community
management, says Professor Wright. In
the early days—San Juan evened in
1891—faculty members had no voice
and the area was virtually a "company
town."

The Campus Homeowners'
Association, acting as a pressure group,
can now approach the university, which
administers its residential community
with a city-manager type of
government. Talk of annexation to Palo
Alto persists, however. Some residents
favor the latter proposal because it
assures elected representation unlike
the Homeowners' Association, which
acts solely as an advisory body.
Yet few faculty members can pass
up the fringe benefits attached to
campus housing. Permanent faculty
members with the rank of professor,
associate professor, or assistant
professor are presently eligible to own
campus homes. After three years of
employment, permanent staff officers
of equivalent rank may be approved for
ownership eligiblity by the president of
the university.
Flexible Loan Program
A flexible loan program provides for
construction, purchase, remodeling,
and repair of homes. Interest rates for
new loans are one percentage point
below mortgage rates for comparable
single-family residences in the local
commercial market.
Although the maximum loan for
new construction is normally 90
percent of the actual cost, the President
may authorize loans up to 100 percent,
if the borrower demonstrates genuine
financial need.
A ground lease entitles the holder to
the use of the improvements on the
leased property for the eighty year
term of the lease. Community services
are maintained through a ground rent
charge.
Campus homes must remain in the
Stanford family. Departing
homeowners must sell their residences
to another eligible faculty or staff
member.
This rule, explains Professor Wright
also applies to families of divorced
faculty members.
The shortage of low and moderate income housing
in the nid-peninsula has reached crisis proportions and
is getting worse. In the words of Mid-peninsula Urban
Coalition director Ira Hall, "what you have is a
criminal situation."
In a series of articles beginning today, the Daily will
attempt to describe the problem, its causes, its effects,
and what is being done about it. The first article is an
attempt to define the low and moderate income
housing shortage, and to describe some of the
consequences in the mid-peninsula.
"The (housing) situation in the mid-Peninsula area
is particularly acute," according to Stanford's Wright
Committee report. Because of the disproportionate

Low-Cost Dwellings

demand for housing by middle and upper-income
families in this area, brought here by industrial
development and the resulting population growth, the
prices of both new and existing homes have risen far
beyond the means of moderate-income families to say
nothing of those of low income.
Prices Rising
"Many moderate-income families are now living in
homes which, at present-day prices, they could no
longer afford to buy, and which will on re-sale go to
middle-income households. In some communities,
including Palo Alto, even families earning as much as
$15,000 cannot afford to buy most homes that come
on the market.
"In other communities, the problem is aggravated
by restrictive zoning regulations requiring minimum
lot sizes. Almost invariably, new housing is built for
the middle-income market, whether it be homes for
families or apartments for couples. The result is that
low/moderate income families, as a group, are being
squeezed out of the area. Since the bulk of minority
families are in these income groups, the exclusion of
minorities is continuing at the same time."
Coalition Report
A similar view is held by the Urban Coalitionwhich
published a 1970 report which said, "The combined

housing—increases, Stanford's bastion
of sheltered community-living faces an
influx of diversified cultural and

lack of social and economic variety
branded the area as a "ghetto." But it
was understandably a desirable
"ghetto."
The Wright Committee Report on
University Housing, presented to the
Board of Trustees last June,
recommends that Stanford build
low-income housing for university
employees and for workers in the area.
In September, a developer was selected
to begin the first round of housing near
Frenchman's Hill. More housing will
follow as finances become available.
The ultimate goal is to integrate
subsidized housing into the faculty
section to achieve a true social mixture.
Future projects will be built on

economically, socially, and racially

municipalties will take appropriate
action, says Professor Gordon Wright.
Many campus residents favor the
entry cf low-cost housing because it
will help modify the unrealistic picture
of life often adopted by their children.
Communications associate professor
Edwin Parker, a resident of
Frenchman's Hill, said he preferred that
his children grow up with children from
a wider range of income and
occupational groups. He would like to
see more blacks and minority groups
living in the area.
Not everyone agrees with Dr. Parker.
A petition circulated by Frenchman's
Hill residents last spring asked that the
land now earmarked for low cost
housing be reserved for "single-family,
individual unit housing which is similar
in character to that now being
constructed on Frenchman's Hill."
Proposal Studied
Business Professor William Massy, an
executive board member of the
Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association, told the Daily last night
that his organization was conducting an
impartial study of proposed
low-income housing on Site B, a section
of land adjacent to Frenchman's Hill.
The investigation will deal with such
problems as the ability of the area's
schools to absorb the additional
students such housing would bring to
the district.
Dr. Massy indicated that there was
still some faculty opposition to
building low-income housing on Site B.
The Frenchman's Hill Homeowners'
Association was formed last year at the
height of the low-income housing
controversy.
In spite of the unincorporated status
of the Stanford housing, residents do
have a sizeable voice in community
management, says Professor Wright. In
the early days—San Juan evened in
1891—faculty members had no voice
and the area was virtually a "company
town."

The Campus Homeowners'
Association, acting as a pressure group,
can now approach the university, which
administers its residential community
with a city-manager type of
government. Talk of annexation to Palo
Alto persists, however. Some residents
favor the latter proposal because it
assures elected representation unlike
the Homeowners' Association, which
acts solely as an advisory body.
Yet few faculty members can pass
up the fringe benefits attached to
campus housing. Permanent faculty
members with the rank of professor,
associate professor, or assistant
professor are presently eligible to own
campus homes. After three years of
employment, permanent staff officers
of equivalent rank may be approved for
ownership eligiblity by the president of
the university.
Flexible Loan Program
A flexible loan program provides for
construction, purchase, remodeling,
and repair of homes. Interest rates for
new loans are one percentage point
below mortgage rates for comparable
single-family residences in the local
commercial market.
Although the maximum loan for
new construction is normally 90
percent of the actual cost, the President
may authorize loans up to 100 percent,
if the borrower demonstrates genuine
financial need.
A ground lease entitles the holder to
the use of the improvements on the
leased property for the eighty year
term of the lease. Community services
are maintained through a ground rent
charge.
Campus homes must remain in the
Stanford family. Departing
homeowners must sell their residences
to another eligible faculty or staff
member.
This rule, explains Professor Wright
also applies to families of divorced
faculty members.
The shortage of low and moderate income housing
in the nid-peninsula has reached crisis proportions and
is getting worse. In the words of Mid-peninsula Urban
Coalition director Ira Hall, "what you have is a
criminal situation."
In a series of articles beginning today, the Daily will
attempt to describe the problem, its causes, its effects,
and what is being done about it. The first article is an
attempt to define the low and moderate income
housing shortage, and to describe some of the
consequences in the mid-peninsula.
"The (housing) situation in the mid-Peninsula area
is particularly acute," according to Stanford's Wright
Committee report. Because of the disproportionate

Low-Cost Dwellings

demand for housing by middle and upper-income
families in this area, brought here by industrial
development and the resulting population growth, the
prices of both new and existing homes have risen far
beyond the means of moderate-income families to say
nothing of those of low income.
Prices Rising
"Many moderate-income families are now living in
homes which, at present-day prices, they could no
longer afford to buy, and which will on re-sale go to
middle-income households. In some communities,
including Palo Alto, even families earning as much as
$15,000 cannot afford to buy most homes that come
on the market.
"In other communities, the problem is aggravated
by restrictive zoning regulations requiring minimum
lot sizes. Almost invariably, new housing is built for
the middle-income market, whether it be homes for
families or apartments for couples. The result is that
low/moderate income families, as a group, are being
squeezed out of the area. Since the bulk of minority
families are in these income groups, the exclusion of
minorities is continuing at the same time."
Coalition Report
A similar view is held by the Urban Coalitionwhich
published a 1970 report which said, "The combined
effect of high new home prices, high existing home
prices, high interest, taxes and insurance charges, and
absence of a significant supply of rental units for
families, is that the moderate income families as a
group have lost the capacity to compete effectively for
housing in the Mid-Peninsula area.
"It is apparent from market prices that most
moderate income families in the area could not afford
to purchase their own homes at current prices. When
they must sell, they will be replaced in their homes by
middle-income families. Thus moderate-income

families will decline in absolute numbers, and even
faster will they decline as a percentage of the
population, which will continue to grow at a modest
rate for some time.
"The proposition of the poor, as well as their
absolute numbers, will also drop. The middle-income
demand is so strong that it not only holds
middle-income units for families at that level, but even
reaches down to take for middle-income occupancy,
homes which had been serving moderate-income
families. By the same token, mo derate-in come families
are competing for units occupied by poor families.
Furthermore, some pockets of poor-family occupancy
is blighted areas are targets for clearance by the
concerned city governments."
Vacancy Rate
One measure of demand for housing is the vacancy
rate. This figure is the percentage of total housing
units unoccupied at one point in time. According to
the Santa Clara County Housing Report of 1969, "it is
conventionally accepted by housing market analysts
that 'normal' vacancies should be about five percent
for single family houses and about seven to eight
percent for multi-family or rental units."
The mid-peninsula vacancy rate is estimated at less
than two percent, with Palo Alto probably less than
one percent. In addition, according to Janet Owens,
low income housing specialist for the Mid-Peninsula
Citizens For Fair Housing. (MCFH) "Because people
double up in many houses, if the vacancy rate is
anywhere near zero, you can almost be sure it is really
below zero."
Racial Discrimination
The low and moderate income housing shortage
also leads to an increase in the related problem of
racial discrimination. According to MCFH fair housing
director, Marylin Nyborg, "Racial discrimination has
always existed in the mid-peninsula and continues to
exist. When there is a balanced housing market people
are more likely to overlook their prejudices, but if a
landlord feels certain he can always fill his vacancies,
he is likely to be more discriminating in whom he will
rent to."
A recent MCFH survey found that 41 percent of
the apartments in Mountain View practice racial
discrimination.
Palo Alto Report
The city government of Palo Alto seems to most
observers, to have been very alow to acknowledge the
housing problem. Even so, a report this summer by the
city managers office admitted that "Palo Alto's
already short supply of low cost housing is being
diminished, primarily in and around the downtown
area, as a result of clearance, demolition and
remodeling activity."
It continued,"the average worker in Palo Alto
cannot afford to buy or rent in the community. This
increases the distance that each worker must commute

every day, and, in the absence of adequate public
transportation clogs the existing streets and creates a
demand for higher capacity traffic arteries which, in
some cases, require the demolition of housing units."
The significant problem, however, is not the
increased commuting but the inequalities of the tax
base of the surrounding communities, according to
Urban Coalition director Ira Hall. He says, "There is a
discrepancy between Palo Alto and other areas. People
who work here are required to live as far away as San
Jose, Milpitas, and Cupertino. Some people object to
the problems of commuting, such as increased smog,
but the primary objection is the disparity in the
quality of municipal services and schools.
Regional Tax Base
"If we had a regional tax base than the situation
would not be nearly as bad, but with so many small
municipalities each city must pay for its own services.
When it gets to the point where you keep bringing in
people who you can't house, you must recognize that
you are creating a bad situation somewhere else."
Hall's criticism is mild compared with that of some.
According to a Palo Alto Tenant's Union booklet,
"Palo Alto employs 12 2 percent of the county's
work force, but houses only five percent of the
county's people. 78 percent of the people who work
in Palo Alto cannot afford to live in the city. This
problem will intensify as Palo Alto's development
proceeds. ... A new, bigger, richer, and whiter Palo
Alto is being built."
Many people disagree with the tenants' union
analysis. Stanford Manager of Real Estate, Boyd
Smith, says,"I don't think Palo Alto has deliberately
excluded the laborer. Since the late fifties there has
been a large influx of low income people of various
races which has created this shortage of housing at the
low income level."
"I don't think the mid-peninsula situation is any
different than the nation wide situation. The city of
Palo Alto is a very desirable place to live ... It is that
which has driven the price of real estate up in this
area."
Charles Walker, a member of the Palo Alto city
manager's office, also feels the city has been fair. "!
would be hard pressed to show that the economic mix
is changing. I think something like 1200 families in
Palo Alto are receiving some sort of federal welfare
assistance. That seems to indicate to me that we do
have a sizable number of low income residents." Larry
Livingston, a regional planner hired by Stanford,
disagrees. "The reservoirs of low and moderate income
housing are in the city areas. We are suburbia with a
great deal of employment which exacerbates the
problem. Good quality development has always been
in effect and there has always been exclusion of poor
people from this area.
"There will never be enough low and moderate
income housing here. In the future, there will be more
jobs and less housing . .. the pinch will increase."

While many a weary commuter
across the nation faces a
one-to-two-hour marathon to work
each morning, this man mounts his
bicycle and barring pedestrian jams,
arrives five minutes later at his
classroom or office.
"This man" is a Stanford professor
or permanent staff officer—one of

Faculty Residences

2,000 inhabitants of the San Juan, Pine
Hill, Frenchman's Hill area owned by
the university.
Being but a bicycle ride away from
work is only one of many advantages
enjoyed by Stanford community
dwellers. Campus housing is so
financially attractive that it is a major
recruiting device for new faculty, notes
Robert Summers of the Stanford
Business Office.
Housing Demand Increases
As the demand for more
ho using—especially low-cost

housing—increases, Stanford's bastion
of sheltered community-living faces an
influx of diversified cultural and
occupational groups. In the past, the
lack of social and economic variety
branded the area as a "ghetto." But it
