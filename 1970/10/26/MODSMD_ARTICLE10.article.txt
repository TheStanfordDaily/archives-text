6 Daily 9 Biased
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to protest the
undiscriminating, undesirable, and
unjournalistic anti-administration
bias expressed by the DAILY and
some of its staff members. The
most recent, and one of the least
subtle, was the editorial tag added
lo the end of all otherwise
excellent interview by Carol Lewis
of John J. Schwartz. This non
sequitur, and the connection
between Schwartz and the
decision to spend $90,000 to
improve university security that it
implied, is generally recognized by
most journalists to be one of the
fundamental signs of bad
reportage, even when the article
carries a by-line. As a reporter
myself I sympathize with Carol
Lewis's attempts to find a good
conclusion to a basically
themeless story, but I resent the
moral tag that she inserted. At
least conservative newspapers,
such as the one for which I
worked, manage to confine their
opinions to the editorial page. It
would be greatly appreciated if
the Daily were to make an effort
to adhere to standards of tactful
journalism.

Bookstore Failure
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have always considered the
Stanford Bookstore a dismal,
infuriating failure. This feeling
was exacerbated yesterday, when
I went to buy some Shakespearian
plays. Of the nine I wanted, only
one was in stock.
I was told that the other eight
had been "dropped" because they
didn't sell. The mind-boggling
force of this situation slowly
dawned on me as I gazed at the
long rows of greeting cards, the
phonograph records, the
overpriced bric-a-brac, the stereo
applainces and TV sets.
"0, reform it altogether!"
(Hamlet, 111, ii ,4 0 ). The
Bookstore should stop competing
with Discount Records, Cost-Pius,
the Emporium, and Alec's and
commence providing decent
service as a bookseller.
Aside from being a damned
inconvenience, the Bookstore is a
disgrace to the University.

Police Car
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the KZSU reporter who
asked the question about
unmarked police vehicles on the
October 13 press conference, I
would like to clear some of the
confusion which has since closed
in on the issue. First, I did not as
implied in the October 14 DAILY
article, state that the vehicle
(ZHW 09) was tailing me
specifically. I simply stated that it
was observed shadowing a KZSU
remote crew in Palo Alto last
February during the TDA (The
Day Chicago 7 trial)
rallies. Because we had observed it
operating in Palo Alto and
monitored it transmitting on a
frequency reserved for the Palo
Alto police, we assumed that it
belonged to Palo Alto. This leaves
open the question of just what a
Stanford vehicle was doing there.
Second: In your October 19
issue you carried a letter from
John J. Schwartz (special assistant
to President Lyman) stating that
ZHW 089 is one of two cars
identical to those 'used for
traffic control" with lights and
sirens. This is not so, those two
vehicles are Chrysler corporation
cars (Plymouths, I think) licensed
008 BDM and 009 BDM (new
plates) respectively. ZHW 08 9 is a
Ford.
Third: there are other vehicles,
such as a blue 1963 Cadillac with
a communications antenna, which
have been observed by KZSU
personnel on campus and driven
by men known to us as Stanford
police officers. Why dx>es the
University find it necessary to
subject us to such surveillance?
Fourth: we have observed
twice in the past week a vehicle
with U.S. Gov't licence plates Gl 1
50588 , a green 1970 Falcon with
two large flashing lights and a
siren, the vehicle is marked lIU.S.
GOVERNMENT INTERAGENCY

MOTOR POOL." It was parked in
front of Encina Hall from noon to
one Tuesday, October 20. Why
does the University find it
necessary to invite such vehicles
on campus? Why does the
Government find it necessary to
dispatch vehicles to the campus?
I, for one, find the presence of
such vehicles offensive and
demand an explanation of the
need for unmarked agents among
us and for what could only be
described as outside agitators with
lights and sirens around us.
In closing, I do not believe that
any of the items listed above is a
direct, personal threat to me, but
I feel the community should be
aware of these facts. When I see
these vehicles liberally spotted
around campus I can only
comment on the prevalent
Orwellian atmosphere. 198 4 is
fourteen years away and right on
schedule.

'Feeble Attempt 9
Editor, THE DAILY:
Leonard Siegel's feeble attempt
to* breathe life into the remains of
the ROTC issue ("Beware of Due
Process"—DAlLY, October 23)
merits attention only because its
distortions and omissions might
confuse some who have not
followed the issue closely since
the Spring. The facts are as
follows:
1. The Air Force ROTC unit
will leave the Campus June, 1971.
2. The Navy unit will leave the
Campus in June, 1973, when the
present Sophomore class
graduates. No freshmen will be
admitted to the program after this
year, and first-year Naval Science
is not being offered for this year's
freshmen. Instead, the limited
number of freshmen who were
admitted before the faculty
decision was made (about 20) and
who decided to come to Stanford
are enrolled in second-year Naval
Science so that their military
studies can be completed by June
1973. They will receive credit for
Naval Science courses that are
offered for credit to others. I have
yet to hear an argument against
this practice that is not so
cramped, bureaucratic, and
punitive as to constitute its own
rebuttal.
3. The situation with respect to
Army ROTC is similar to the
Navy arrangements with the single
exception that the Army has
insisted that the existing contract
obligates the University to offer
first-year Military Science. That is
an accurate reading of the
contract and we are complying
with the Army's insistence that
we honor the contract we signed.
Hence, the course will be offered,
without credit, to the four
students who want it. The Army,
like the Navy, will admit no
further freshmen and will end all
military instruction at Stanford in
June of 1 973.
These facts were given to the
Senate by President Lyman and
were reported in the press. There
is no reason for anyone who has
been paying attention to be
confused about them. The fact
that Mr. Siegel likes to state his
conclusions in capital letters may
make them more visible, but
certainly not more weighty.

'Feeble Attempt 9
Editor, THE DAILY:
Leonard Siegel's feeble attempt
to* breathe life into the remains of
the ROTC issue ("Beware of Due
Process"—DAlLY, October 23)
merits attention only because its
distortions and omissions might
confuse some who have not
followed the issue closely since
the Spring. The facts are as
follows:
1. The Air Force ROTC unit
will leave the Campus June, 1971.
2. The Navy unit will leave the
Campus in June, 1973, when the
present Sophomore class
graduates. No freshmen will be
admitted to the program after this
year, and first-year Naval Science
is not being offered for this year's
freshmen. Instead, the limited
number of freshmen who were
admitted before the faculty
decision was made (about 20) and
who decided to come to Stanford
are enrolled in second-year Naval
Science so that their military
studies can be completed by June
1973. They will receive credit for
Naval Science courses that are
offered for credit to others. I have
yet to hear an argument against
this practice that is not so
cramped, bureaucratic, and
punitive as to constitute its own
rebuttal.
3. The situation with respect to
Army ROTC is similar to the
Navy arrangements with the single
exception that the Army has
insisted that the existing contract
obligates the University to offer
first-year Military Science. That is
an accurate reading of the
contract and we are complying
with the Army's insistence that
we honor the contract we signed.
Hence, the course will be offered,
without credit, to the four
students who want it. The Army,
like the Navy, will admit no
further freshmen and will end all
military instruction at Stanford in
June of 1 973.
These facts were given to the
Senate by President Lyman and
were reported in the press. There
is no reason for anyone who has
been paying attention to be
confused about them. The fact
that Mr. Siegel likes to state his
conclusions in capital letters may
make them more visible, but
certainly not more weighty.

I would like to protest the
undiscriminating, undesirable, and
unjournalistic anti-administration
bias expressed by the DAILY and
some of its staff members. The
most recent, and one of the least
subtle, was the editorial tag added
lo the end of all otherwise
excellent interview by Carol Lewis
of John J. Schwartz. This non
sequitur, and the connection
between Schwartz and the
decision to spend $90,000 to
improve university security that it
implied, is generally recognized by
most journalists to be one of the
fundamental signs of bad
reportage, even when the article
carries a by-line. As a reporter
myself I sympathize with Carol
Lewis's attempts to find a good
conclusion to a basically
themeless story, but I resent the
moral tag that she inserted. At
least conservative newspapers,
such as the one for which I
worked, manage to confine their
opinions to the editorial page. It
would be greatly appreciated if
the Daily were to make an effort
to adhere to standards of tactful

Bookstore Failure
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have always considered the
Stanford Bookstore a dismal,
infuriating failure. This feeling
was exacerbated yesterday, when
I went to buy some Shakespearian
plays. Of the nine I wanted, only
one was in stock.
I was told that the other eight
had been "dropped" because they
didn't sell. The mind-boggling
force of this situation slowly
dawned on me as I gazed at the
long rows of greeting cards, the
phonograph records, the
overpriced bric-a-brac, the stereo
applainces and TV sets.
"0, reform it altogether!"
(Hamlet, 111, ii ,4 0 ). The
Bookstore should stop competing
with Discount Records, Cost-Pius,
the Emporium, and Alec's and
commence providing decent
service as a bookseller.
Aside from being a damned
inconvenience, the Bookstore is a
disgrace to the University.

As the KZSU reporter who
asked the question about
unmarked police vehicles on the
October 13 press conference, I
would like to clear some of the
confusion which has since closed
in on the issue. First, I did not as
implied in the October 14 DAILY
article, state that the vehicle
(ZHW 09) was tailing me
specifically. I simply stated that it
was observed shadowing a KZSU
remote crew in Palo Alto last
February during the TDA (The
Day Chicago 7 trial)
rallies. Because we had observed it
operating in Palo Alto and
monitored it transmitting on a
frequency reserved for the Palo
Alto police, we assumed that it
belonged to Palo Alto. This leaves
open the question of just what a
Stanford vehicle was doing there.
Second: In your October 19
issue you carried a letter from
John J. Schwartz (special assistant
to President Lyman) stating that
ZHW 089 is one of two cars
identical to those 'used for
traffic control" with lights and
sirens. This is not so, those two
vehicles are Chrysler corporation
cars (Plymouths, I think) licensed
008 BDM and 009 BDM (new
plates) respectively. ZHW 08 9 is a
Ford.
Third: there are other vehicles,
such as a blue 1963 Cadillac with
a communications antenna, which
have been observed by KZSU
personnel on campus and driven
by men known to us as Stanford
police officers. Why dx>es the
University find it necessary to
subject us to such surveillance?
Fourth: we have observed

excellent interview by Carol Lewis
of John J. Schwartz. This non

Bookstore Failure
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have always considered the
Stanford Bookstore a dismal,
infuriating failure. This feeling
was exacerbated yesterday, when
I went to buy some Shakespearian
plays. Of the nine I wanted, only
one was in stock.
I was told that the other eight
had been "dropped" because they
didn't sell. The mind-boggling
force of this situation slowly
dawned on me as I gazed at the
long rows of greeting cards, the
phonograph records, the
overpriced bric-a-brac, the stereo
applainces and TV sets.
"0, reform it altogether!"
(Hamlet, 111, ii ,4 0 ). The
Bookstore should stop competing
with Discount Records, Cost-Pius,
the Emporium, and Alec's and
commence providing decent
service as a bookseller.
Aside from being a damned
inconvenience, the Bookstore is a
disgrace to the University.

Police Car
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the KZSU reporter who
asked the question about
unmarked police vehicles on the
October 13 press conference, I
would like to clear some of the
confusion which has since closed
in on the issue. First, I did not as
implied in the October 14 DAILY
article, state that the vehicle
(ZHW 09) was tailing me
specifically. I simply stated that it
was observed shadowing a KZSU
remote crew in Palo Alto last
February during the TDA (The
Day Chicago 7 trial)
rallies. Because we had observed it
operating in Palo Alto and
monitored it transmitting on a
frequency reserved for the Palo
Alto police, we assumed that it
belonged to Palo Alto. This leaves
open the question of just what a
Stanford vehicle was doing there.
Second: In your October 19
issue you carried a letter from
John J. Schwartz (special assistant
to President Lyman) stating that
ZHW 089 is one of two cars
identical to those 'used for
traffic control" with lights and
sirens. This is not so, those two
vehicles are Chrysler corporation
cars (Plymouths, I think) licensed
008 BDM and 009 BDM (new
plates) respectively. ZHW 08 9 is a
Ford.
Third: there are other vehicles,
such as a blue 1963 Cadillac with
a communications antenna, which
have been observed by KZSU
personnel on campus and driven
by men known to us as Stanford
police officers. Why dx>es the
University find it necessary to
subject us to such surveillance?
Fourth: we have observed
twice in the past week a vehicle
with U.S. Gov't licence plates Gl 1
50588 , a green 1970 Falcon with
two large flashing lights and a
siren, the vehicle is marked lIU.S.
GOVERNMENT INTERAGENCY

MOTOR POOL." It was parked in
front of Encina Hall from noon to
one Tuesday, October 20. Why
does the University find it
necessary to invite such vehicles
on campus? Why does the
Government find it necessary to
dispatch vehicles to the campus?
I, for one, find the presence of
such vehicles offensive and
demand an explanation of the
need for unmarked agents among
us and for what could only be
described as outside agitators with
lights and sirens around us.
In closing, I do not believe that
any of the items listed above is a
direct, personal threat to me, but
I feel the community should be
aware of these facts. When I see
these vehicles liberally spotted
around campus I can only
comment on the prevalent
Orwellian atmosphere. 198 4 is
fourteen years away and right on
schedule.

'Feeble Attempt 9
Editor, THE DAILY:
Leonard Siegel's feeble attempt
to* breathe life into the remains of
the ROTC issue ("Beware of Due
Process"—DAlLY, October 23)
merits attention only because its
distortions and omissions might
confuse some who have not
followed the issue closely since
the Spring. The facts are as
follows:
1. The Air Force ROTC unit
will leave the Campus June, 1971.
2. The Navy unit will leave the
Campus in June, 1973, when the
present Sophomore class
graduates. No freshmen will be
admitted to the program after this
year, and first-year Naval Science
is not being offered for this year's
freshmen. Instead, the limited
number of freshmen who were
admitted before the faculty
decision was made (about 20) and
who decided to come to Stanford
are enrolled in second-year Naval
Science so that their military
studies can be completed by June
1973. They will receive credit for
Naval Science courses that are
offered for credit to others. I have
yet to hear an argument against
this practice that is not so
cramped, bureaucratic, and
punitive as to constitute its own
rebuttal.
3. The situation with respect to
Army ROTC is similar to the
Navy arrangements with the single
exception that the Army has
insisted that the existing contract
obligates the University to offer
first-year Military Science. That is
an accurate reading of the
contract and we are complying
with the Army's insistence that
we honor the contract we signed.
Hence, the course will be offered,
without credit, to the four
students who want it. The Army,
like the Navy, will admit no
further freshmen and will end all
military instruction at Stanford in
June of 1 973.
These facts were given to the
Senate by President Lyman and
were reported in the press. There
is no reason for anyone who has
been paying attention to be
confused about them. The fact
that Mr. Siegel likes to state his
conclusions in capital letters may
make them more visible, but
certainly not more weighty.

MOTOR POOL." It was parked in
front of Encina Hall from noon to
one Tuesday, October 20. Why
does the University find it
necessary to invite such vehicles
on campus? Why does the
Government find it necessary to
dispatch vehicles to the campus?
I, for one, find the presence of

In closing, I do not believe that

comment on the prevalent

'Feeble Attempt 9
Editor, THE DAILY:
Leonard Siegel's feeble attempt
to* breathe life into the remains of
the ROTC issue ("Beware of Due
Process"—DAlLY, October 23)
merits attention only because its
distortions and omissions might
confuse some who have not
followed the issue closely since
the Spring. The facts are as
follows:
1. The Air Force ROTC unit
will leave the Campus June, 1971.
2. The Navy unit will leave the
Campus in June, 1973, when the
present Sophomore class
graduates. No freshmen will be
admitted to the program after this
year, and first-year Naval Science
is not being offered for this year's
freshmen. Instead, the limited
number of freshmen who were
admitted before the faculty
decision was made (about 20) and
who decided to come to Stanford
are enrolled in second-year Naval
Science so that their military
studies can be completed by June
1973. They will receive credit for
Naval Science courses that are
offered for credit to others. I have
yet to hear an argument against
this practice that is not so
cramped, bureaucratic, and
punitive as to constitute its own
rebuttal.
3. The situation with respect to
Army ROTC is similar to the
Navy arrangements with the single
exception that the Army has
insisted that the existing contract
obligates the University to offer
first-year Military Science. That is
an accurate reading of the
contract and we are complying
with the Army's insistence that
we honor the contract we signed.
Hence, the course will be offered,
without credit, to the four
students who want it. The Army,
like the Navy, will admit no
further freshmen and will end all
military instruction at Stanford in
June of 1 973.
These facts were given to the
Senate by President Lyman and
were reported in the press. There
is no reason for anyone who has
been paying attention to be
confused about them. The fact
that Mr. Siegel likes to state his
conclusions in capital letters may
make them more visible, but
certainly not more weighty.

6 Daily 9 Biased
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to protest the
undiscriminating, undesirable, and
unjournalistic anti-administration
bias expressed by the DAILY and
some of its staff members. The
most recent, and one of the least
subtle, was the editorial tag added
lo the end of all otherwise
excellent interview by Carol Lewis
of John J. Schwartz. This non
sequitur, and the connection
between Schwartz and the
decision to spend $90,000 to
improve university security that it
implied, is generally recognized by
most journalists to be one of the
fundamental signs of bad
reportage, even when the article
carries a by-line. As a reporter
myself I sympathize with Carol
Lewis's attempts to find a good
conclusion to a basically
themeless story, but I resent the
moral tag that she inserted. At
least conservative newspapers,
such as the one for which I
worked, manage to confine their
opinions to the editorial page. It
would be greatly appreciated if
the Daily were to make an effort
to adhere to standards of tactful
journalism.

Bookstore Failure
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have always considered the
Stanford Bookstore a dismal,
infuriating failure. This feeling
was exacerbated yesterday, when
I went to buy some Shakespearian
plays. Of the nine I wanted, only
one was in stock.
I was told that the other eight
had been "dropped" because they
didn't sell. The mind-boggling
force of this situation slowly
dawned on me as I gazed at the
long rows of greeting cards, the
phonograph records, the
overpriced bric-a-brac, the stereo
applainces and TV sets.
"0, reform it altogether!"
(Hamlet, 111, ii ,4 0 ). The
Bookstore should stop competing
with Discount Records, Cost-Pius,
the Emporium, and Alec's and
commence providing decent
service as a bookseller.
Aside from being a damned
inconvenience, the Bookstore is a
disgrace to the University.

English
Police Car
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the KZSU reporter who
asked the question about
unmarked police vehicles on the
October 13 press conference, I
would like to clear some of the
confusion which has since closed
in on the issue. First, I did not as
implied in the October 14 DAILY
article, state that the vehicle
(ZHW 09) was tailing me
specifically. I simply stated that it
was observed shadowing a KZSU
remote crew in Palo Alto last
February during the TDA (The
Day Chicago 7 trial)
rallies. Because we had observed it
operating in Palo Alto and
monitored it transmitting on a
frequency reserved for the Palo
Alto police, we assumed that it
belonged to Palo Alto. This leaves
open the question of just what a
Stanford vehicle was doing there.
Second: In your October 19
issue you carried a letter from
John J. Schwartz (special assistant
to President Lyman) stating that
ZHW 089 is one of two cars
identical to those 'used for
traffic control" with lights and
sirens. This is not so, those two
vehicles are Chrysler corporation
cars (Plymouths, I think) licensed
008 BDM and 009 BDM (new
plates) respectively. ZHW 08 9 is a
Ford.
Third: there are other vehicles,
such as a blue 1963 Cadillac with
a communications antenna, which
have been observed by KZSU
personnel on campus and driven
by men known to us as Stanford
police officers. Why dx>es the
University find it necessary to
subject us to such surveillance?
Fourth: we have observed
twice in the past week a vehicle
with U.S. Gov't licence plates Gl 1
50588 , a green 1970 Falcon with
two large flashing lights and a
siren, the vehicle is marked lIU.S.
