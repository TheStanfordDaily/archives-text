# Magic Lantern Films Tonight
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
MAGIC LANTERN, the first
noteworthy collection of
American student films, is being
presented this evening at 7 :30 and
9:30 in Memorial Auditorium. A
perfectly balanced program,
MAGIC LANTERN consists of
eleven films ranging from
documentaries to experimental
films, eight of which have won
prizes at film festivals across the
country.
Distributors of student film
series have had a tendency to
include, in addition to too many
"experimental" films,
unimaginative amateurish shorts.
Just because one is new at film
making and lacking in capital
doesn't mean that the film
produced has to look like an
impoverished home movie. What is
evident today in not only student
produced films but also studio
financed features is a lack of
respect for and knowledge of film
making as a craft and art. Many
people have also forgotten that a
film still has a certain obligation
to be entertaining to the audience
it's imposing itself on.

Where are the films of the new
wave of talented young film
makers, who fill film schools and
threaten to make intelligent
movies'? Some of them can be
found in MAGIC LANTERN
which is unique in the quality and
diversity of the films arranged in
an hour and a half program.
"METANOMEN," one of two
exceptional experimental films
Scott Bartlett has included in
MAGIC LANTERN, is seven
minutes of black and white
superimposed, burned and
negative images synchronized to
the music of Ravi Shankar. The
result is a total synthesis of sight
and sound. Bartlett's other film
"OFE-ON" is a color montage of
more than just abstract images. It
is, like "METANOMEN," a
sensory experience.
"SEAN," winner of first prize
of four different festivals, is a
black and white documentary
starring the hippest four year old
kid living in the Haight. When
asked if he turns on, he replies,
"No, but I smoke grass." He's

then asked what it's like and says,
"Give me some and I'll eat it."
Sean expresses his opinions on
cops ("They bust you"), shoes
("They're creepy"), big people
who wear shoes ("They're
creepy") and as a result we yet a
good idea of what goes on in the
head of the children of the
disenchanted generation.
John Newton's "RABBITT
HUNT" is a beautifully
photographed color film about
the consequences of a rabbit hunt
on the mind of a small boy. The
photographic techniques
employed by Newton are on the
level of a professional.
Two short comedies are
strategically placed in different
parts of the program which
effectively serve to vary the pace.
"THE GUEST" is about a guest
and his imaginary (?) encounter
with his two hostesses and "A
QUICKIE" is just that; a fast f--k
on film.
"VIDA TIJEDO" is an
excellent experimental film by
Laurie Grundberg who utilizes
stock footage of South Americans

at a festival and then
superimposed, dyed and filtered
the figures to create a surrealistic
effect.
"DOOR TO DOOR" is the
only drag in the series of
entertaining, fast moving films.
The ten minute film of a guy
trying to sell Encyclopedia
Africanus in a Black
neighborhood has its moments of
humor, but it's too long and reeks
of that home movie quality.
"AIRPLANE GLUE I LOVE
YOU," previewed last week at the
James Dean films is a clever
comedy about a twenty-five year
old model airplane maker who
returns to grade school. A product
of Howard Lester's imagination,
"AIRPLANE GLUE" has been
awarded prizes at ten film festivals
including an honorable mention at
the National Student Eilm
Eestival.
I hope you'll attend MAGIC
LATERN to express your support
of talented film makers and to
encourage distribution of films
that otherwise couldn't find a
market.

"No, but I smoke grass." He's

then asked what it's like and says,
"Give me some and I'll eat it."
Sean expresses his opinions on
cops ("They bust you"), shoes
("They're creepy"), big people
who wear shoes ("They're
creepy") and as a result we yet a
good idea of what goes on in the
head of the children of the
disenchanted generation.
John Newton's "RABBITT
HUNT" is a beautifully
photographed color film about
the consequences of a rabbit hunt
on the mind of a small boy. The
photographic techniques
employed by Newton are on the
level of a professional.
Two short comedies are
strategically placed in different
parts of the program which
effectively serve to vary the pace.
"THE GUEST" is about a guest
and his imaginary (?) encounter
with his two hostesses and "A
QUICKIE" is just that; a fast f--k
on film.
"VIDA TIJEDO" is an
excellent experimental film by
Laurie Grundberg who utilizes
stock footage of South Americans

at a festival and then
superimposed, dyed and filtered
the figures to create a surrealistic
effect.
"DOOR TO DOOR" is the
only drag in the series of
entertaining, fast moving films.
The ten minute film of a guy
trying to sell Encyclopedia
Africanus in a Black
neighborhood has its moments of
humor, but it's too long and reeks
of that home movie quality.
"AIRPLANE GLUE I LOVE
YOU," previewed last week at the
James Dean films is a clever
comedy about a twenty-five year
old model airplane maker who
returns to grade school. A product
of Howard Lester's imagination,
"AIRPLANE GLUE" has been
awarded prizes at ten film festivals
including an honorable mention at
the National Student Eilm
Eestival.
I hope you'll attend MAGIC
LATERN to express your support
of talented film makers and to
encourage distribution of films
that otherwise couldn't find a
market.

Auditorium, 7 :45.
MAGIC LANTERN, the first
noteworthy collection of
American student films, is being
presented this evening at 7 :30 and
9:30 in Memorial Auditorium. A
perfectly balanced program,
MAGIC LANTERN consists of
eleven films ranging from
documentaries to experimental
films, eight of which have won
prizes at film festivals across the
country.
Distributors of student film
series have had a tendency to
include, in addition to too many
"experimental" films,
unimaginative amateurish shorts.
Just because one is new at film
making and lacking in capital
doesn't mean that the film
produced has to look like an
impoverished home movie. What is
evident today in not only student
produced films but also studio
financed features is a lack of
respect for and knowledge of film
making as a craft and art. Many
people have also forgotten that a
film still has a certain obligation
to be entertaining to the audience
it's imposing itself on.

Where are the films of the new
wave of talented young film
makers, who fill film schools and
threaten to make intelligent
movies'? Some of them can be
found in MAGIC LANTERN
which is unique in the quality and
diversity of the films arranged in
an hour and a half program.
"METANOMEN," one of two
exceptional experimental films
Scott Bartlett has included in
MAGIC LANTERN, is seven
minutes of black and white
superimposed, burned and
negative images synchronized to
the music of Ravi Shankar. The
result is a total synthesis of sight
and sound. Bartlett's other film
"OFE-ON" is a color montage of
more than just abstract images. It
is, like "METANOMEN," a
sensory experience.
"SEAN," winner of first prize
of four different festivals, is a
black and white documentary
starring the hippest four year old
kid living in the Haight. When
asked if he turns on, he replies,
"No, but I smoke grass." He's

then asked what it's like and says,
"Give me some and I'll eat it."

"THE ROUND UP" directed
by Jancsco Miklos
(Hungarian). Presented by
the International
Association. Bishop
Auditorium, 7 :45.
MAGIC LANTERN, the first
noteworthy collection of
American student films, is being
presented this evening at 7 :30 and
9:30 in Memorial Auditorium. A
perfectly balanced program,
MAGIC LANTERN consists of
eleven films ranging from
documentaries to experimental
films, eight of which have won
prizes at film festivals across the
country.
Distributors of student film
series have had a tendency to
include, in addition to too many
"experimental" films,
unimaginative amateurish shorts.
Just because one is new at film
making and lacking in capital
doesn't mean that the film
produced has to look like an
impoverished home movie. What is
evident today in not only student
produced films but also studio
financed features is a lack of
respect for and knowledge of film
making as a craft and art. Many
people have also forgotten that a
film still has a certain obligation
to be entertaining to the audience
it's imposing itself on.

Where are the films of the new
wave of talented young film
makers, who fill film schools and
threaten to make intelligent
movies'? Some of them can be
found in MAGIC LANTERN
which is unique in the quality and
diversity of the films arranged in
an hour and a half program.
"METANOMEN," one of two
exceptional experimental films
Scott Bartlett has included in
MAGIC LANTERN, is seven
minutes of black and white
superimposed, burned and
negative images synchronized to
the music of Ravi Shankar. The
result is a total synthesis of sight
and sound. Bartlett's other film
"OFE-ON" is a color montage of
more than just abstract images. It
is, like "METANOMEN," a
sensory experience.
"SEAN," winner of first prize
of four different festivals, is a
black and white documentary
starring the hippest four year old
kid living in the Haight. When
asked if he turns on, he replies,
"No, but I smoke grass." He's

then asked what it's like and says,
"Give me some and I'll eat it."
Sean expresses his opinions on
cops ("They bust you"), shoes
("They're creepy"), big people
who wear shoes ("They're
creepy") and as a result we yet a
good idea of what goes on in the
head of the children of the
disenchanted generation.
John Newton's "RABBITT
HUNT" is a beautifully
photographed color film about
the consequences of a rabbit hunt
on the mind of a small boy. The
photographic techniques
employed by Newton are on the
level of a professional.
Two short comedies are
strategically placed in different
parts of the program which
effectively serve to vary the pace.
"THE GUEST" is about a guest
and his imaginary (?) encounter
with his two hostesses and "A
QUICKIE" is just that; a fast f--k
on film.
"VIDA TIJEDO" is an
excellent experimental film by
Laurie Grundberg who utilizes
stock footage of South Americans

at a festival and then
superimposed, dyed and filtered
the figures to create a surrealistic
effect.
"DOOR TO DOOR" is the
only drag in the series of
entertaining, fast moving films.
The ten minute film of a guy
trying to sell Encyclopedia
Africanus in a Black
neighborhood has its moments of
humor, but it's too long and reeks
of that home movie quality.
"AIRPLANE GLUE I LOVE
YOU," previewed last week at the
James Dean films is a clever
comedy about a twenty-five year
old model airplane maker who
returns to grade school. A product
of Howard Lester's imagination,
"AIRPLANE GLUE" has been
awarded prizes at ten film festivals
including an honorable mention at
the National Student Eilm
Eestival.
I hope you'll attend MAGIC
LATERN to express your support
of talented film makers and to
encourage distribution of films
that otherwise couldn't find a
market.
