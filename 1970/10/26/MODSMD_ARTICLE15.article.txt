# AWAKEN TO A WORLD OF WONDERS!
## Ballets Africains Earthy And Exciting 
### LORI GOETZ 
The Ballets Africains is an
experience no one should have
missed. Not only is it a valuable
and educational presentation of
African history and culture; it is
also an incredibly rich artistic
production. The Ballets Africains
is not, as the name might imply, a
series of dances relying on highly
structured and refined
movements. It is a fusion of
media, integrating dance, music
(performed on stage with the
dangers), acting, pantomime,

chants and songs, into an earthy
and alive presentation of African
culture.
The program is divided into
two parts. The first half deals
primarily with African history and
politics; the second with African
tribal customs and ritual. Both
halves are didactic-the African
legends carry the distinct political
message that African peoples want
unity under their own leadership,
and the second clearly teaches and
reinforces tribal codes of
morality.
What is significant is that in

this fusion between politics and
art, neither is degraded.
Particularly for American
audiences, The Ballets Africains
serve an educational function, and
within the troupe's home country,
New Guinea, similar troupes serve
the same function of political and
moral education. And yet, this
political content in no way
reduces the rich artistic value of
the production.
The success of the show
seemed to be primarily dependent
on two factors. One was the
music, which consisted mainly of
drums. Their driving insistent
rhythm affected the audience as
well as the performers, drawing
them into the performance and
bridging the gap between
themselves and the performers.
The second was the quality of
the dancers themselves. There was
a remarkable degree of unity
between the dancers and the
dance. The movements were so
internalized, so without
se 1 f-consciousness or
self-awareness, that they appeared
to be totally spontaneous. The
result was both superb dancing,
and for the observer, the feeling
that he was not watching a well
rehearsed performance, but that
he was participating in an actual
celebration or ritual.
Soundiata
The Friday night show began
with the legend of Soundiata, the
Lion-King. Paralyzed as a young
boy, he regains use of his legs
thorugh painful efforts that are
convincingly portrayed. With the
help of the army he has gathered,
he regains the throne that is
rightfully his, and goes on to
unify many parts of Africa into a
great empire.
It is in the celebration of
Soundiata and his unifying army
that the troupe begins to reveal its
great abilities. The stage is flooded
with people, movement, and
color, but the well patterned
choreography avoids any sense of
confusion. The dancers themselves
reveal unmatched strength and
acrobatic ability as they rejoice
over the unity of Africa under
African leadership.
This strong sense of African
unity is carried over into the
second dance, M'Balia Camara.
M'Balia is an African woman who
leads her people in a revolutionary
struggle against colonialism and
dies in the fight for liberation.
The piece brilliantly depicts
the village chief as the lacky he is,
and it is highlighted by a moving
dance in which the women of the
village rally to the call of M'Balia.

Their slow swaying movements,
indicative of the suffering of an
oppressed people, are gradually
transformed into rapid, energetic
movements of anger and
determination as they respond to
M'Balia's courage and devotion.
This is followed by Tiranke, a
whimsical piece about a young girl
wavering between three suitors
which provides a welcome relief
from the intensity of the earlier
dances.
Initiation Rites
After intermission, the
program again picks up its tempo
with Koma and the Sacred Forest.
The dance depicts the preparation
for initiation rites and the
appearance of Koma, the God of
the Sacred Forest. It effectively
shows the initiation not as a form
of barbarism, as so many people
think, but rather as an attempt to
teach the young to live life in
harmony with nature.
Among the initiates, however,
is one young man who tries to
seduce a young girl by taking her
into the Sacred Forest. Such
activity is strictly forbidden by
tribal morality, and the couple
finds themselves surrounded,
haunted, and cursed by the
invisible guardians of virtue in the
forest.
This is by far the most
spectacular part of the show. The
guardians appear in a variety of
fantastic ritualistic dress and the
tempo does not let up for a
moment. The young couple,
particularly the girl, express their
combined terror and longing for
each other with an intensity of
movement that almost makes the
observer feel exhausted.
The Sacred Forest is climaxed
by the entrance of the topless
girls. They sweep around the front
of the stage in a series of rapid
sidewards motions that constitute
one of the most effectively
choreographed moments in the
entire production, and their
vitality and exuberance are
beautiful.
Unfortunately, the topless
dancers and the gymnastical feats
seemed to be the only things
capable of provoking spontaneous
applause among the Friday night
audience—subtler and more lyrical
moments seemed to pass they by.
Their appreciation was evident,
however, during the Finale, when
they joined in the rhythmical
clapping of the troupe and
flooded around the foot of the
stage with cries of "More" and
"Bravo." It was an appreciation
and response that the Ballets
Afrieains fully deserved.

beautiful.
Unfortunately, the topless
dancers and the gymnastical feats
seemed to be the only things
capable of provoking spontaneous
applause among the Friday night
audience—subtler and more lyrical
moments seemed to pass they by.
Their appreciation was evident,
however, during the Finale, when
they joined in the rhythmical
clapping of the troupe and
flooded around the foot of the
stage with cries of "More" and
"Bravo." It was an appreciation
and response that the Ballets
Afrieains fully deserved.

The Ballets Africains is an
experience no one should have
missed. Not only is it a valuable
and educational presentation of
African history and culture; it is
also an incredibly rich artistic
production. The Ballets Africains
is not, as the name might imply, a
series of dances relying on highly
structured and refined
movements. It is a fusion of
media, integrating dance, music
(performed on stage with the
dangers), acting, pantomime,

chants and songs, into an earthy
and alive presentation of African
culture.
The program is divided into
two parts. The first half deals
primarily with African history and
politics; the second with African
tribal customs and ritual. Both
halves are didactic-the African
legends carry the distinct political
message that African peoples want
unity under their own leadership,
and the second clearly teaches and
reinforces tribal codes of
morality.
What is significant is that in

this fusion between politics and
art, neither is degraded.
Particularly for American
audiences, The Ballets Africains
serve an educational function, and
within the troupe's home country,
New Guinea, similar troupes serve
the same function of political and
moral education. And yet, this
political content in no way
reduces the rich artistic value of
the production.
The success of the show
seemed to be primarily dependent
on two factors. One was the
music, which consisted mainly of
drums. Their driving insistent
rhythm affected the audience as
well as the performers, drawing
them into the performance and
bridging the gap between
themselves and the performers.
The second was the quality of
the dancers themselves. There was
a remarkable degree of unity
between the dancers and the
dance. The movements were so
internalized, so without
se 1 f-consciousness or
self-awareness, that they appeared
to be totally spontaneous. The
result was both superb dancing,
and for the observer, the feeling
that he was not watching a well
rehearsed performance, but that
he was participating in an actual
celebration or ritual.
Soundiata
The Friday night show began
with the legend of Soundiata, the
Lion-King. Paralyzed as a young
boy, he regains use of his legs
thorugh painful efforts that are
convincingly portrayed. With the
help of the army he has gathered,
he regains the throne that is
rightfully his, and goes on to
unify many parts of Africa into a
great empire.
It is in the celebration of
Soundiata and his unifying army
that the troupe begins to reveal its
great abilities. The stage is flooded
with people, movement, and
color, but the well patterned
choreography avoids any sense of
confusion. The dancers themselves
reveal unmatched strength and
acrobatic ability as they rejoice
over the unity of Africa under
African leadership.
This strong sense of African
unity is carried over into the
second dance, M'Balia Camara.
M'Balia is an African woman who
leads her people in a revolutionary
struggle against colonialism and
dies in the fight for liberation.
The piece brilliantly depicts
the village chief as the lacky he is,
and it is highlighted by a moving
dance in which the women of the
village rally to the call of M'Balia.

Their slow swaying movements,
indicative of the suffering of an
oppressed people, are gradually
transformed into rapid, energetic
movements of anger and
determination as they respond to
M'Balia's courage and devotion.
This is followed by Tiranke, a
whimsical piece about a young girl
wavering between three suitors
which provides a welcome relief
from the intensity of the earlier
dances.
Initiation Rites
After intermission, the
program again picks up its tempo
with Koma and the Sacred Forest.
The dance depicts the preparation
for initiation rites and the
appearance of Koma, the God of
the Sacred Forest. It effectively
shows the initiation not as a form
of barbarism, as so many people
think, but rather as an attempt to
teach the young to live life in
harmony with nature.
Among the initiates, however,
is one young man who tries to
seduce a young girl by taking her
into the Sacred Forest. Such
activity is strictly forbidden by
tribal morality, and the couple
finds themselves surrounded,
haunted, and cursed by the
invisible guardians of virtue in the
forest.
This is by far the most
spectacular part of the show. The
guardians appear in a variety of
fantastic ritualistic dress and the
tempo does not let up for a
moment. The young couple,
particularly the girl, express their
combined terror and longing for
each other with an intensity of
movement that almost makes the
observer feel exhausted.
The Sacred Forest is climaxed
by the entrance of the topless
girls. They sweep around the front
of the stage in a series of rapid
sidewards motions that constitute
one of the most effectively
choreographed moments in the
entire production, and their
vitality and exuberance are
beautiful.

moment. The young couple,
particularly the girl, express their
combined terror and longing for
each other with an intensity of
movement that almost makes the
observer feel exhausted.
The Sacred Forest is climaxed
by the entrance of the topless
girls. They sweep around the front
of the stage in a series of rapid
sidewards motions that constitute
one of the most effectively
choreographed moments in the
entire production, and their
vitality and exuberance are
beautiful.
Unfortunately, the topless
dancers and the gymnastical feats
seemed to be the only things
capable of provoking spontaneous
applause among the Friday night
audience—subtler and more lyrical
moments seemed to pass they by.
Their appreciation was evident,
however, during the Finale, when
they joined in the rhythmical
clapping of the troupe and
flooded around the foot of the
stage with cries of "More" and
"Bravo." It was an appreciation
and response that the Ballets
Afrieains fully deserved.

The Ballets Africains is an
experience no one should have
missed. Not only is it a valuable
and educational presentation of
African history and culture; it is
also an incredibly rich artistic
production. The Ballets Africains
is not, as the name might imply, a
series of dances relying on highly
structured and refined
movements. It is a fusion of
media, integrating dance, music
(performed on stage with the
dangers), acting, pantomime,

chants and songs, into an earthy
and alive presentation of African
culture.
The program is divided into
two parts. The first half deals
primarily with African history and
politics; the second with African
tribal customs and ritual. Both
halves are didactic-the African
legends carry the distinct political
message that African peoples want
unity under their own leadership,
and the second clearly teaches and
reinforces tribal codes of
morality.
What is significant is that in

this fusion between politics and
art, neither is degraded.
Particularly for American
audiences, The Ballets Africains
serve an educational function, and
within the troupe's home country,
New Guinea, similar troupes serve
the same function of political and
moral education. And yet, this
political content in no way
reduces the rich artistic value of
the production.
The success of the show
seemed to be primarily dependent
on two factors. One was the
music, which consisted mainly of
drums. Their driving insistent
rhythm affected the audience as
well as the performers, drawing
them into the performance and
bridging the gap between
themselves and the performers.
The second was the quality of
the dancers themselves. There was
a remarkable degree of unity
between the dancers and the
dance. The movements were so
internalized, so without
se 1 f-consciousness or
self-awareness, that they appeared
to be totally spontaneous. The
result was both superb dancing,
and for the observer, the feeling
that he was not watching a well
rehearsed performance, but that
he was participating in an actual
celebration or ritual.
Soundiata
The Friday night show began
with the legend of Soundiata, the
Lion-King. Paralyzed as a young
boy, he regains use of his legs
thorugh painful efforts that are
convincingly portrayed. With the
help of the army he has gathered,
he regains the throne that is
rightfully his, and goes on to
unify many parts of Africa into a
great empire.
It is in the celebration of
Soundiata and his unifying army
that the troupe begins to reveal its
great abilities. The stage is flooded
with people, movement, and
color, but the well patterned
choreography avoids any sense of
confusion. The dancers themselves
reveal unmatched strength and
acrobatic ability as they rejoice
over the unity of Africa under
African leadership.
This strong sense of African
unity is carried over into the
second dance, M'Balia Camara.
M'Balia is an African woman who
leads her people in a revolutionary
struggle against colonialism and
dies in the fight for liberation.
The piece brilliantly depicts
the village chief as the lacky he is,
and it is highlighted by a moving
dance in which the women of the
village rally to the call of M'Balia.

Their slow swaying movements,
indicative of the suffering of an
oppressed people, are gradually
transformed into rapid, energetic
movements of anger and
determination as they respond to
M'Balia's courage and devotion.
This is followed by Tiranke, a
whimsical piece about a young girl
wavering between three suitors
which provides a welcome relief
from the intensity of the earlier
dances.
Initiation Rites
After intermission, the
program again picks up its tempo
with Koma and the Sacred Forest.
The dance depicts the preparation
for initiation rites and the
appearance of Koma, the God of
the Sacred Forest. It effectively
shows the initiation not as a form
of barbarism, as so many people
think, but rather as an attempt to
teach the young to live life in
harmony with nature.
Among the initiates, however,
is one young man who tries to
seduce a young girl by taking her
into the Sacred Forest. Such
activity is strictly forbidden by
tribal morality, and the couple
finds themselves surrounded,
haunted, and cursed by the
invisible guardians of virtue in the
forest.
This is by far the most
spectacular part of the show. The
guardians appear in a variety of
fantastic ritualistic dress and the
tempo does not let up for a
moment. The young couple,
particularly the girl, express their
combined terror and longing for
each other with an intensity of
movement that almost makes the
observer feel exhausted.
