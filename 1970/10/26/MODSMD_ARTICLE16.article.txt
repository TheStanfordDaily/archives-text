### FELICITY BARRINGER 
"So it goes."—from Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt
Vonnegut, Jr.
Day is following uneventful day; task following
unmomentous task. Stanford is deep into its quarter of rest.
Something built into Autumn Quarter is driving people away
from the campus or within themselves. The reality of day
following uneventful day, of blissful or stifling calm, of time
alone now rules the campus.
Gone is the urgency of Spring. Gone, for the moment at
least, the omnipresent demands for political consciousness.
Football commands whatever energy this quarter has seen;
people can forgo politics for a while. The Rose Bowl is closer
than the Revolution.
Escapism is hovering in the air. Weekends see a mass
exodus-to Yosemite, to the beach, to the south-away. The
air is changing, brisk; a few leaves are falling. Stanford is too
big for those looking within themselves; too small for those
looking out at the world.
The rain came early this year. It waited around long
enough to let people know that it was coming-then it fell,
drab and methodical.
So it goes.
Wander up near the knoll. There's organ music flowing
from the Music building. The same notes, over and over.
Wander down by the lake. They've started dumping the
crates and the poles that will eventually be the fuel for the
Big Game bonfire. Now kids are using it as a fort.
There are burrs all over the bottom of Lake Lag. They
catch on your socks when you go walking down there.
Leafletters are still prowling White Plaza, telling you to
work for Riles, or Tunney, or to vote for their Student Senate
candidate. But there are no noon rallies any more. There are
problem sets to do. Books to read. Thoughts to think.
So it goes.
Freshmen are well into their new gran'falloons. Freshman
dorms, Western Civ (that isn't really Western Civ), Freshman
seminars, all the faces that will keep reappearing for the next
three years. And there are more gran'falloons to
come-Overseas groups, Labs—more faces, more
acquaintances.
Older students are passing those faces on Quad, smiling
with vague recognition, and trying to remember which
gran'fallon that face belonged to.
Last year there was the Moratorium. This year there are
the elections. Last year hundreds turned out to choose

between the black and the white, and say no, we do not
agree. This year there is the greyness of reality, of men who
are sort of good and sort of bad, the greyness of having no
absolutes.
Well, even if there are no absolutes, there still are problem
sets to do, there still are books to read, there still are
assignments to finish.
So it goes.
I wandered into the dining room the other day, insipid,
uninspired, to see a familiar bearded figure bent over his
books. I asked what he'd like to be doing, what would turn
him on at that point in time.
He looked up, thought a few seconds, and said, "Getting
on my bicycle, riding it up to the foothills, turning around
and looking back at campus. Then riding down to the beach.
Running naked along the beach for ten miles or so. Diving
into the surf, and then having scuba gear on, and going
looking for things."
I was caught up in his flight of fancy, and followed him
over the foothills. I murmured some response.
"Yeah," he said. "Back to differential equations."
The campus is back to differential equations. There's
football on the lawns behind Wilbur, basketball behind Roble,
pot parties in Stern, booking everywhere.
Stillness, too. Everywhere.
So it goes.
