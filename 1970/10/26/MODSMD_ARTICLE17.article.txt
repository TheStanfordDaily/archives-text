# Some Night For The Tribe

### FRED LEESON 
LOS ANGELES-Stanford's
dressing room Yiear the end of the
curving tunnel in the Coliseum
wasn't exactly subdued around 11
p.m. Saturday night.
"It feels good!" came one
shout. "We did it, we did it!"
came another. And so they went.
"I'm smellin' roses . . ."
"We're walking on top of L.A.
tonight, believe me!"
"Hey, where's John Hall?
Where's John Hall?" shouted
Mike Simone.
Bill Meyers, down at the other
end of the room placed himself by
the door and said resolutely,
"John Hall isn't getting into this
room."
Hall Marks
John Hall, lest you wonder, is
that distinguished Los Angeles
columnist who predicted last
week that Stanford's so-called
Thunder Chickens would lay an
egg against UCLA.
"Once a Stanford man, always
scared," he ended his piece. The
fact he didn't show up was
undoubtedly a significant factor
toward his continued good health.
"I'm not sure I can handle too
many more of these," said John
Ralston after Stanford's 9-7 win
over the Bruins. "But it's nice
when you win them."
Though Stanford's offense
cranked out 481 yds. and got place
kicker Steve Horowitz into
field-goal range five times this win
came from the defense which
stymied Bruin runners and kept
Dennis Dummit from creating
passing havoc, though he
completed 18 throws.
"I tell you, these defensive
backs are just great," said
defensive tackle Dave Tipton.

"When Dummit had to stop
back there and pump two and
three times it wasn't because of us
rushing him. His receivers were
covered."
"Don't listen to him," said
safety Jim Kauffman. "Their rush
was just tremendous."
Close Work
"With the front line putting
that kind of pressure on it's not
too tough," added defensive back
Charles McCloud. Kauffman,
McCloud, Ben Barnes, Jack
Schultz and Mike Ewing were
particularly adept at blanketing
Dummit's receivers when the
Bruins took to the air in
desperation during the last two
minutes.
"I was just running around like
a chicken with his head cut off,"
Kauffman said. "It was like one
continuous play."
UCLA, which had used up all
its times out to stop the clock

when Stanford had the ball, reeled
off nine plays, most coming
without even pause for a huddle.
"They were sort of tired,"
McCloud said.
"When they started out I
couldn't even move their tackle I
had," Tipton said. "Then he
started getting tired and 1 began
budging him, and by the end I was
moving right through him."
Dummit was dumped seven
times, most coming right at the
end.
"Hey there Greg," Tipton
yelled to Greg Sampson as the
latter went by. "We were meeting
back there a couple times weren't
we? Us meeting right back there
with Dennis!"
For Ralston, it was his first win
over UCLA in eight attempts. This
year he also beat USC, which he
had never done before, either.
"That's nice," he said of
knocking off both Los Angeles
schools. "It's not easy to do."

The Stanford coach spent the
last couple minutes at the other
end of the field from where
UCLA had the ball. "I was
standing where I thought they had
to come to be within field goal
range," he said.
A break for Stanford when the
Indians had to give up the ball was
that center John Sande downed
Steve Murray's 48 yard punt on
the UCLA three, which didn't give
Dummit much room to work.
"They teach us that if the guy
signals for a fair catch to run right
by him," Sande said. "That way if
he catches it you might scare him,
and if he lets it go you can down
it.
"One guy blocked me but I got
past him and just went for the
goal line."
"At least we didn't lay an egg,"
said quarterback Jim Plunkett. "I
thought it would be much more
wide open."
During the week tight end Bob

Moore related an experience
occurring after last year's 20-20
tie with UCLA.
Discussion
"We (Plunkett and Moore) sat
down a half an hour after
everybody had left and he said
nothing like that would ever
happen again, that he just
wouldn't allow it. We knew we
were so close to the Rose Bowl
and beating USC and UCLA."
This time it didn't happen.
Plunkett didn't exactly tear
UCLA apart, but he did get
Stanford into field goal position
when it was essential and he had
another long drive stopped at the
one on a fumble.
"I'm glad it happened," he
said, looking in retrospect at the
victories over USC and UCLA.
Reflecting on the content of his
discussion with Moore he said, "I
don't know what I'd be doing or
saying now if it hadn't worked
out that way."

ON THE RUNâ€”Stanford managed to balance its running and passing attack Saturday night against UCLA, but it still didn't
get the Indians a touchdown. But then they didn't need one, as it turned out. Below, Jim Plunkett gets hit from behind, one
of the two times he got trapped. At right, Jackie Brown, who led all rushers with 106 yards, attempts to elude a Bruin tackier
who appears to be doing painful things to his neck and shoulders. Brown's longest run was a 31 yard trip on a fake punt play
in the first quarter. A fumble later stopped the same drive on the UCLA one.
