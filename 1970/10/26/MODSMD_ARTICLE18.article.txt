# Poloists Lose Pair In L.A.
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's varsity water polo
seven were dunked twice last
weekend first by USC 6-5 and
then by UCLA 10-2. Both
contests were dominated by the
referee's whistle.
"Refs down south just call
fouls differently than we're used
to at Stanford and in Northern
California," Coach Jim Gaughran
after the UCLA game.
In both games, Rick
Massimino—the Cardinals' premier
scoring threat held four fouls by
the end of the first quarter. And
at UCLA, Mike Davis also had
four fouls after the first eight
minutes.
"Our offense is based on the
scoring strength of Rick and Mike.
Obviously, the offensive fouls
they got surprised us and hurt us
since we had to take them out,"
Gaughran said.
Against Troy on Friday,
Stanford jumped off to a quick
lead on Rob Woolley's first
quarter goal with an assist from
Massimino.
Then the whistle blew. A major
foul was called on the Braves for
interference with an SC shot
inside the 4-yard line. The Trojans
cashed in on the break and tied it
up at the end of the first period
with Dennis Needleman's penalty
shot.
Following an early second
quarter goal by Needleman again.
Rick Massimino converted on a
penalty shop to tie the score at
2-2. Then with 3:13 left in the
half, Massimino fouled out.
Before tne half ended, USC
had scored twice more, once on a
contested foul shot and held a
tenuous 4-2 lead.
The third period saw the
Trojans capitalize on another
penalty score the fourth- and
expand their lead to 6-3. The
InHiane "ii-iire came on Mill

Simpkins' penalty throw. Both
SC's scores came from Dennis
Needleman, his third and fourth
goals.
Leading a fourth quarter surge,
Mike Davis scored two goals with
6:45 and 2:03 left in the game.
But again the ref's whistle
signalled the end of Stanford's
chances and the game—USC 6,
Stanford 5.
Needing a victory against the
Bruins Saturday morning to assure
the Cards of an NCAA berth,
Coach Gaughran exhorted his
players to play a steady game with
tight defense. Unfortunately, the
Indians again played
over-zealously and were penalized
with countless questionable
violations.
"The reis caught us off
balance. We never had a chance to
really play them (UCLA). Some
of the offensive fouls were highly
questionable and we felt some of
UCLA's players weren't called for
fouling when they should have
been," Gaughran complained.
At halftime, Stanford's
infractions totaled 21 while
UCLA had only 10.
In the first quarter, the Indians
allowed only two goals, one on a
penalty toss, and played an
aggressive offense without
registering a goal.
When the second period began,
Gaughran had benched Massimino
with four fouls. Goalie Peter Gadd
played excellently early in the
quarter making several great saves.
Then Mike Davis scored for
Stanford after Hill Simpkins had
failed to net a penalty throw.
With the score 2-1 in its favor,
UCLA went on a rampage
devastating the Indian defense
scoring four goals in three minutes
thus grabbing a fi-l halftime
bulge.
At this point, Stanford had lost
all momentum and confidence.

and four starters had over three
fouls.
In an anti-climactic second
half, UCLA tossed in four more
goals to Stanford's one. The
Cards' lone score came on
Massimino's third quarter penalty
shot.

"The bigger pools at USC and
UCLA were hard, for our team to
adjust to. The extra swimming
tired us out too fast," Gaughran
explained.
"But we're not out of the
league race yet. With our last two
conference games at home, we're
still in it," Coach Gaughran said.

In an anti-climactic second
half, UCLA tossed in four more
goals to Stanford's one. The
Cards' lone score came on
Massimino's third quarter penalty
shot.

"The bigger pools at USC and
UCLA were hard, for our team to

tired us out too fast," Gaughran
explained.

conference games at home, we're

Stanford's varsity water polo
seven were dunked twice last
weekend first by USC 6-5 and
then by UCLA 10-2. Both
contests were dominated by the
referee's whistle.
"Refs down south just call
fouls differently than we're used
to at Stanford and in Northern
California," Coach Jim Gaughran
after the UCLA game.
In both games, Rick
Massimino—the Cardinals' premier
scoring threat held four fouls by
the end of the first quarter. And
at UCLA, Mike Davis also had
four fouls after the first eight
minutes.
"Our offense is based on the
scoring strength of Rick and Mike.
Obviously, the offensive fouls
they got surprised us and hurt us
since we had to take them out,"
Gaughran said.
Against Troy on Friday,
Stanford jumped off to a quick
lead on Rob Woolley's first
quarter goal with an assist from
Massimino.
Then the whistle blew. A major
foul was called on the Braves for
interference with an SC shot
inside the 4-yard line. The Trojans
cashed in on the break and tied it
up at the end of the first period
with Dennis Needleman's penalty
shot.
Following an early second
quarter goal by Needleman again.
Rick Massimino converted on a
penalty shop to tie the score at

contested foul shot and held a
tenuous 4-2 lead.
The third period saw the
Trojans capitalize on another
penalty score the fourth- and
expand their lead to 6-3. The
InHiane "ii-iire came on Mill

Needleman, his third and fourth

Leading a fourth quarter surge,
Mike Davis scored two goals with
6:45 and 2:03 left in the game.
But again the ref's whistle

chances and the game—USC 6,
Stanford 5.
Needing a victory against the
Bruins Saturday morning to assure
the Cards of an NCAA berth,
Coach Gaughran exhorted his
players to play a steady game with
tight defense. Unfortunately, the
Indians again played
over-zealously and were penalized
with countless questionable
violations.
"The reis caught us off
balance. We never had a chance to
really play them (UCLA). Some
of the offensive fouls were highly
questionable and we felt some of
UCLA's players weren't called for
fouling when they should have
been," Gaughran complained.
At halftime, Stanford's
infractions totaled 21 while
UCLA had only 10.
In the first quarter, the Indians

with four fouls. Goalie Peter Gadd
played excellently early in the
quarter making several great saves.
Then Mike Davis scored for
