ON THE RUN—Stanford managed to balance its running and passing attack Saturday night against UCLA,
but it still didn't get the Indians a touchdown. But then they didn't need one, as it turned out. Below, Jim
Plunkett gets hit from behind, one of the two times he got trapped. At right, Jackie Brown, who led all
rushers with 106 yards, attempts to elude a Bruin tackier who appears to be doing painful things to his neck
and shoulders. Brown's longest run was a 31 yard trip on a fake punt play in the first quarter. A fumble
later stopped the same drive on the UCLA one.

DUMP DUMMlT—Stanford's Jody Graves (65) battles to obstruct a pass thrown
by UCLA quarterback Dennis Dummit. Dummit completed 18 of 35 passes but
got sacked seven times, most coming in the critical moments of the fourth
quarter. Dave Tipton (76) moves in the background. The Bruins were forced to
the air as they were limited to 25 total yards rushing.
