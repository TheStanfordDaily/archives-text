# UCLA Chances Nipped In Bud

### FRED LEESON 
Steve Horowitz, whose right toot
has been a bone of contention for three
years, may have kicked Stanford to the
Rose Bowl with three field goals
Saturday night.
His goals, each 30 yards or farther,
were Stanford's only scores in its 9-7
co me-from-be hind football victory over
UCLA before 8 3-518 in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
"We knew we were going to win,"
Horowitz said afterward, seemingly
unshaken by the pressure
accompanying his 30 yard kick that
wiped out UCLA's 7-6 lead with 4:5 7
left in the game. "I'm surprised it was
that close."
The Bruins were thought by
many—but not Stanford Coach John
Ralston—to be last major obstacle in
the way to Stanford's first Rose Bowl
trip since 1951.
The Indians remain the only
undefeated team in Pac-8 play with a
4 -0 record. Oregon is second at 4 -1.
Stanford's clearest path to the bowl
is to win its final three league games
against Oregon State, Washington and
California.

However, since the Indians beat
Oregon 33-10 earlier in the season they
can lose any one of those three league
games and still go to Pasadena.
Coach Ralston continues his refusal
to speak of the Rose Bowl and
maintains the biggest game on his mind
right now is Oregon State, which visits
Stanford next Saturday.
Both UCLA and USC are virtually
eliminated from Rose Bowl
competition with two league losses.
Oregon upset USC 10-7 in Eugene
Saturday.
With excellent passing quarterbakes
Jim Plunkett and Dennis Dummit
facing each other, the Stanford-UCLA
match was expected to be an open,
high-scoring game.
But the defenses—particularly
Stanford's—took over instead. Stanford
never did score a touchdown and the
Bruins got their only score after they
picked up a fumbled Stanford pitch out
on the Tribe's 15 .
Horowitz—whose name still recalls
futile memories to many despite his
emergence as a fine placekicker through
work and diligence—did all Stanford's
scoring.
He drilled through a 38 yard field
