# UCLA Chances Nipped In Bud
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Steve Horowitz, whose right toot
has been a bone of contention for three
years, may have kicked Stanford to the
Rose Bowl with three field goals
Saturday night.
His goals, each 30 yards or farther,
were Stanford's only scores in its 9-7
co me-from-be hind football victory over
UCLA before 8 3-518 in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
"We knew we were going to win,"
Horowitz said afterward, seemingly
unshaken by the pressure
accompanying his 30 yard kick that
wiped out UCLA's 7-6 lead with 4:5 7
left in the game. "I'm surprised it was
that close."
The Bruins were thought by
many—but not Stanford Coach John
Ralston—to be last major obstacle in
the way to Stanford's first Rose Bowl
trip since 1951.
The Indians remain the only
undefeated team in Pac-8 play with a
4 -0 record. Oregon is second at 4 -1.
Stanford's clearest path to the bowl
is to win its final three league games
against Oregon State, Washington and
California.

However, since the Indians beat
Oregon 33-10 earlier in the season they
can lose any one of those three league
games and still go to Pasadena.
Coach Ralston continues his refusal
to speak of the Rose Bowl and
maintains the biggest game on his mind
right now is Oregon State, which visits
Stanford next Saturday.
Both UCLA and USC are virtually
eliminated from Rose Bowl
competition with two league losses.
Oregon upset USC 10-7 in Eugene
Saturday.
With excellent passing quarterbakes
Jim Plunkett and Dennis Dummit
facing each other, the Stanford-UCLA
match was expected to be an open,
high-scoring game.
But the defenses—particularly
Stanford's—took over instead. Stanford
never did score a touchdown and the
Bruins got their only score after they
picked up a fumbled Stanford pitch out
on the Tribe's 15 .
Horowitz—whose name still recalls
futile memories to many despite his
emergence as a fine placekicker through
work and diligence—did all Stanford's
scoring.
He drilled through a 38 yard field
goal to culminate the Indians' first
drive in the game, then followed
up with a 35 yarder with nine
minutes left in the half to give
Stanford a 6-0 lead at the break.
He missed two other attempts
of 27 and 4 4 yards in the third
quarter.
Quarterback Plunkett
completed 18 of 37 passes for 263
yards and ran for 31 more, giving
him 293 total yards. He moved
the Tribe 481 yards but couldn't
get into the endzonc.
One drive of 79 yards ended in
a Stanford fumble on the UCLA
1.
The Bruins, due to the Indians'
magnificent defense, never did
keep a long drive going.
Stanford defenders held UCLA
to a mere 25 total yards on the
ground and never gave up a first
down rushing.
Dummit completed 18 of 35
passes for 24 4 yards, but when
the pressure was intense he could
not move the ball.
Down 9-7 with 4:5 2 left in the
game, UCLA had possession of
the ball twice. The first time the
Bruins netted five yards in three
plays and had to punt.
The second time, with 2:17
left, Dummit took his club from
the UCLA three to the 4 0 and
attempted to pass nine times.
Three were complete, three
were incomplete and three times
he was smashed by Stanford's

defensive line and never got the
ball away.
He was dumped seven times
during the game by Larry Butler,
Pete Lazetich, Bill Alexander,
Greg Sampson, Dave Tipton and
Jody Graves.
Meanwhile, Charles McCloud,
Ben Barnes, Jack Schultz and Jim
Kauffman had Dummit's receivers
magnificently covered during the
Bruins' final desperate attempts to
get within field goal range.
Stanford forced UCLA to punt
10 times.
The Indians rushed for 219
yards, Jackie Brown gianing 106
to lead the attack. Brown also
caught three passes.
Big play of Stanford's last
scoring drive was a third and five
pass to Randy Vataha from the
Stanford 4 3 to the Bruin 14. The
series started on the Indian 20.
Plunkett threw one pass
incomplete in the endzone and on
third down found all his receivers
covered and had to scramble back
to the line of scrimmage to set up
the field goal from the right hash
mark.
Horowitz was nearly the hero
last year in Los Angeles when his
field goal in the last minute gave
Stanford a 24-23 lead over USC.
But the Trojans kicked a goal with
no time left to pull out the win.
But Saturday night thousands
chanted "Horowitz, Horowitz,
Horowitz" as the clock ran out
and the scoreboard read Horowitz
9. UCLA 7.

However, since the Indians beat
Oregon 33-10 earlier in the season they
can lose any one of those three league
games and still go to Pasadena.
Coach Ralston continues his refusal
to speak of the Rose Bowl and
maintains the biggest game on his mind
right now is Oregon State, which visits
Stanford next Saturday.
Both UCLA and USC are virtually
eliminated from Rose Bowl
competition with two league losses.
Oregon upset USC 10-7 in Eugene
Saturday.
With excellent passing quarterbakes
Jim Plunkett and Dennis Dummit
facing each other, the Stanford-UCLA
match was expected to be an open,
high-scoring game.
But the defenses—particularly
Stanford's—took over instead. Stanford
never did score a touchdown and the
Bruins got their only score after they
picked up a fumbled Stanford pitch out
on the Tribe's 15 .
Horowitz—whose name still recalls
futile memories to many despite his
emergence as a fine placekicker through
work and diligence—did all Stanford's
scoring.
He drilled through a 38 yard field
goal to culminate the Indians' first
drive in the game, then followed
up with a 35 yarder with nine
minutes left in the half to give
Stanford a 6-0 lead at the break.
He missed two other attempts
of 27 and 4 4 yards in the third
quarter.
Quarterback Plunkett
completed 18 of 37 passes for 263
yards and ran for 31 more, giving
him 293 total yards. He moved
the Tribe 481 yards but couldn't
get into the endzonc.
One drive of 79 yards ended in
a Stanford fumble on the UCLA
1.
The Bruins, due to the Indians'
magnificent defense, never did
keep a long drive going.
Stanford defenders held UCLA
to a mere 25 total yards on the
ground and never gave up a first
down rushing.
Dummit completed 18 of 35
passes for 24 4 yards, but when
the pressure was intense he could
not move the ball.
Down 9-7 with 4:5 2 left in the
game, UCLA had possession of
the ball twice. The first time the
Bruins netted five yards in three
plays and had to punt.
The second time, with 2:17
left, Dummit took his club from
the UCLA three to the 4 0 and
attempted to pass nine times.
Three were complete, three
were incomplete and three times
he was smashed by Stanford's

defensive line and never got the
ball away.
He was dumped seven times
during the game by Larry Butler,
Pete Lazetich, Bill Alexander,
Greg Sampson, Dave Tipton and
Jody Graves.
Meanwhile, Charles McCloud,
Ben Barnes, Jack Schultz and Jim
Kauffman had Dummit's receivers
magnificently covered during the
Bruins' final desperate attempts to
get within field goal range.
Stanford forced UCLA to punt
10 times.
The Indians rushed for 219
yards, Jackie Brown gianing 106
to lead the attack. Brown also
caught three passes.
Big play of Stanford's last
scoring drive was a third and five
pass to Randy Vataha from the
Stanford 4 3 to the Bruin 14. The
series started on the Indian 20.
Plunkett threw one pass
incomplete in the endzone and on
third down found all his receivers
covered and had to scramble back
to the line of scrimmage to set up
the field goal from the right hash
mark.
Horowitz was nearly the hero
last year in Los Angeles when his
field goal in the last minute gave
Stanford a 24-23 lead over USC.
But the Trojans kicked a goal with
no time left to pull out the win.
But Saturday night thousands
chanted "Horowitz, Horowitz,
Horowitz" as the clock ran out
and the scoreboard read Horowitz
9. UCLA 7.
Steve Horowitz, whose right toot
has been a bone of contention for three
years, may have kicked Stanford to the
Rose Bowl with three field goals
Saturday night.
His goals, each 30 yards or farther,
were Stanford's only scores in its 9-7
co me-from-be hind football victory over
UCLA before 8 3-518 in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
"We knew we were going to win,"
Horowitz said afterward, seemingly
unshaken by the pressure
accompanying his 30 yard kick that
wiped out UCLA's 7-6 lead with 4:5 7
left in the game. "I'm surprised it was
that close."
The Bruins were thought by
many—but not Stanford Coach John
Ralston—to be last major obstacle in
the way to Stanford's first Rose Bowl
trip since 1951.
The Indians remain the only
undefeated team in Pac-8 play with a
4 -0 record. Oregon is second at 4 -1.
Stanford's clearest path to the bowl
is to win its final three league games

up with a 35 yarder with nine
minutes left in the half to give
Stanford a 6-0 lead at the break.
He missed two other attempts
of 27 and 4 4 yards in the third
quarter.
Quarterback Plunkett
completed 18 of 37 passes for 263
yards and ran for 31 more, giving
him 293 total yards. He moved
the Tribe 481 yards but couldn't
get into the endzonc.
One drive of 79 yards ended in
a Stanford fumble on the UCLA
1.
The Bruins, due to the Indians'
magnificent defense, never did
keep a long drive going.
Stanford defenders held UCLA
to a mere 25 total yards on the
ground and never gave up a first
down rushing.
Dummit completed 18 of 35
passes for 24 4 yards, but when
the pressure was intense he could
not move the ball.
Down 9-7 with 4:5 2 left in the
game, UCLA had possession of
the ball twice. The first time the
Bruins netted five yards in three
plays and had to punt.
The second time, with 2:17
left, Dummit took his club from
the UCLA three to the 4 0 and
attempted to pass nine times.
Three were complete, three
were incomplete and three times
he was smashed by Stanford's

defensive line and never got the
ball away.
He was dumped seven times
during the game by Larry Butler,
Pete Lazetich, Bill Alexander,
Greg Sampson, Dave Tipton and
Jody Graves.
Meanwhile, Charles McCloud,
Ben Barnes, Jack Schultz and Jim
Kauffman had Dummit's receivers
magnificently covered during the
Bruins' final desperate attempts to
get within field goal range.
Stanford forced UCLA to punt
10 times.
The Indians rushed for 219
yards, Jackie Brown gianing 106
to lead the attack. Brown also
caught three passes.
Big play of Stanford's last
scoring drive was a third and five
pass to Randy Vataha from the
Stanford 4 3 to the Bruin 14. The
series started on the Indian 20.
Plunkett threw one pass
incomplete in the endzone and on
third down found all his receivers
covered and had to scramble back
to the line of scrimmage to set up
the field goal from the right hash
mark.
Horowitz was nearly the hero
last year in Los Angeles when his
field goal in the last minute gave
Stanford a 24-23 lead over USC.
But the Trojans kicked a goal with
no time left to pull out the win.
But Saturday night thousands
chanted "Horowitz, Horowitz,
Horowitz" as the clock ran out
and the scoreboard read Horowitz
9. UCLA 7.
Steve Horowitz, whose right toot
has been a bone of contention for three
years, may have kicked Stanford to the
Rose Bowl with three field goals
Saturday night.
His goals, each 30 yards or farther,
were Stanford's only scores in its 9-7
co me-from-be hind football victory over
UCLA before 8 3-518 in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
"We knew we were going to win,"
Horowitz said afterward, seemingly
unshaken by the pressure
accompanying his 30 yard kick that
wiped out UCLA's 7-6 lead with 4:5 7
left in the game. "I'm surprised it was
that close."
The Bruins were thought by
many—but not Stanford Coach John
Ralston—to be last major obstacle in
the way to Stanford's first Rose Bowl
trip since 1951.
The Indians remain the only
undefeated team in Pac-8 play with a
4 -0 record. Oregon is second at 4 -1.
Stanford's clearest path to the bowl
is to win its final three league games
against Oregon State, Washington and
California.

However, since the Indians beat
Oregon 33-10 earlier in the season they
can lose any one of those three league
games and still go to Pasadena.
Coach Ralston continues his refusal
to speak of the Rose Bowl and
maintains the biggest game on his mind
right now is Oregon State, which visits
Stanford next Saturday.
Both UCLA and USC are virtually
eliminated from Rose Bowl
competition with two league losses.
Oregon upset USC 10-7 in Eugene
Saturday.
With excellent passing quarterbakes
Jim Plunkett and Dennis Dummit
facing each other, the Stanford-UCLA
match was expected to be an open,
high-scoring game.
But the defenses—particularly
Stanford's—took over instead. Stanford
never did score a touchdown and the
Bruins got their only score after they
picked up a fumbled Stanford pitch out
on the Tribe's 15 .
Horowitz—whose name still recalls
futile memories to many despite his
emergence as a fine placekicker through
work and diligence—did all Stanford's
scoring.
He drilled through a 38 yard field
goal to culminate the Indians' first
drive in the game, then followed
up with a 35 yarder with nine
minutes left in the half to give
Stanford a 6-0 lead at the break.
He missed two other attempts
of 27 and 4 4 yards in the third
