## Horowitz Does It 
### Fred Leeson 
Six mammoth banks of arc lamps bleached the
damp ryegrass a peculiar light green and echoes of
handclaps, thuds and thumps of footballs and
players echoed throughout the tremendous bowl
of 85,000 vacant seats, reaching row after pastel
row to the darkness.
The Friday night workout at the Coliseum
came to its end but Steve Horowitz was still
kicking, working with center John Sande and
holder Steve Murray some 45 yards from the goal
post.
He made his first attempt at that distance and
missed his second.
His next to last try slammed into the crossbar
and bounced back 15 yards. His last one grazed
the right upright and tumbled off to the side.
"I'd better get those out of my system before
tomorrow night," he said.
When tomorrow night was over Horowitz had
kicked three field goals of fiveattempts from the
painted grass and his nine points were all Stanford
managed in its 9-7 win over UCLA.
Quest For Relevance
He came out of the shower afterward and
found a perspiring coterie of reporters anxious for
him to say something. By his grin one knew he was
happy but his calm responses made it seem that he
was far less concerned with the pressure around his
last field goal than everybody else was.
"Once we get past their 35," he explained, "I
grab my tee and start counting downs and stuff."
How does he cope with having to be ready at any
time to provide three points with just one kick? "I
pace a lot," he replied.
His concentration is better than he would
imply. Before his last kick, with Stanford down
7-6, with five minutes left and with the offense
sputtering on the UCLA 13, John Ralston waved
down his pacing kicker for last-moment
encouragement.
Steve Comes Through
"You'll kick this one just like every night in
practice," Ralston said and advised him to expect
a 1 0-man rush.

Horowitz doesn't even remember the coach
speaking to him.
"He's taken a lot from the press and we kid him
a lot, too, but he comes through for us," Ralston
said.
Horowitz was a linebacker when he came to
Stanford and had done some kicking in high
school. He started kicking for Stanford two years
ago when proficient Bill Shoemaker broke his leg.
"I was all they had," Horowitz said.
He gained notoriety of sorts when he missed
three attempts within reasonable range hi
sophomore year when Stanford lost 2 7 -24 to USC
before 81,000 in Palo Alto.
That performance, coupled with an errant point
after touchdown kick every now and then has
made a lot of fans grimace at the prospect of
having Horowitz's right foot decide an important
game.
Guilt Purged
"Right now I'm glad I did what I did (switching
from linebacker to kicker)" Horowitz said
Saturday. "Sometimes I feel guilty standing
around during practice, but I'm glad it worked
out."
Still, he said, during a game "I'm anxious to get
back in the locker room."
A couple other players squeezed past the circle
of reporters and one mentioned a party.
"We had a party all arranged for my house after
the S.C. game last year," Horowitz explained.
"Somehow we never quite made it. This time I
guess we will."
Of his two misses Saturday, "The first one was
fumbled on the set, and that threw off my timing.
But that second one I just kicked wide."
The questions kept coming and the pens kept
going. Field goals are either kicked or they aren't,
they're either good or not good, and maybe
Horowitz thought he had said about all he could
say about them.
"I think you ought to talk to Plunkett and
some of the other fellows," he said. How's t.iat for
vour modest hero?
