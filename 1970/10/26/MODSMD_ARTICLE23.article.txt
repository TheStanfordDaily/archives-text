Detroit 'Shoot-Out s
DETROIT (AP) — Fifteen blacks were charged
yesterday with the murder of a Negro policeman whose
death set off a nine-hour armed standoff between
police and militants.
Twelve of the 15 had surrendered early yesterday
after their safety was assured by community leaders
who stood between some 200 heavily armed police and
the militants' rifles that pointed from a sandbagged
second story window of a Black Panther organization
headquarters.
Seven men and eight women were arraigned on
charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
Two youths were charged with assault and battery
in a clash with police two blocks from the building,
which served as headquarters for the National
Committee to Combat Fascism, a Panther organizing
group.
Panthers said the arrest of those two, who were
selling Black Panther literature, led to the shootings in
which one patrolman was killed and another wounded,
the only casualties of the confrontation.
During the standoff, three cars, including two police
vehicles, were burned and some cars were stoned at the
out-skirts of the area. Police said no arrests were made
in connection with those incidents.
Chuck Holt, NCCF coordinator in Detroit, said
police had been harassing the Panthers since they
moved to the West Side from the East Side a week
before. After the call, he told crowds of youths near
police to go home.
GoodelVs Defense
NEW YORK (AP) — Republican Sen. Charles E.
Goodell, stung by White House disavowal of his
candidacy and a poll showing him trailing, pledged last
night to continue in the race.
Saying that his "political blood had been spilled"
and his demise decreed by "hard-hatted militants in the
White House," Goodell maintained that he would not
give way to try to prevent a possible victory by
Conservative dandidate James Buckley.
The Democrat in the campaign, Richard L. Ottinger,
has maintained that votes for Goodell would help
Buckley.
With a somber expression, Goodell told a television
audience that "this is a very agonizing moment for
me." He reviewed the attacks on him by Vice President

Spiro T. Agnew and the. White House, the
psychological effect of a newspaper poll showing him
trailing and then said:
"I will stay. I shall continue to stand for election to
the U.S. Senate."
Goodell said that to quit the contest now would be
"obeisant to the forces of the right."
He charged that "my political blood has been spilled
by the sword of political retribution wielded by the
vice president," and claimed he was the rightwing's No.
1 target.
When Goodell finished his emotion-packed 2 0
minute speech, Republican Sens. Jacob K. Javits of
New York and Charles Percy of Illinois came on screen
to pledge their support.
In the final minute, Goodell apologized to viewers
for preempting "Lassie" locally on CBS television.
In Washington, neither Nixon, Agnew nor the
chairmen of the Republican and Democratic
committees had any comment.
The senator seeks election to his office for the first
time, having been appointed in 1968 by Gov. Nelson
A. Rockefeller to fill the term of the slain Democratic
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
Kent State
KENT, Ohio (AP) — A prosecutor for the special
state grand jury that probed last May's violence at Kent
State University said yesterday he was misquoted in a
newspaper story that said he believed National
Guardsmen "should have shot all" the troublemakers
on campus.
A story, written by a Detroit Free Press reporter
and carried in the Akron Beacon Journal on Saturday,
quoted special prosecutor Seabury Ford as saying:
"There is no question that these guardsmen would
have been killed up there is they had not turned
around and fired."
Four students were killed and nine wounded in a
confrontation with National Guardsmen on May 4,
climaxing four days of protests at the campus and in
the city of Kent over the American incursion into
Cambodia. The special grand jury has indicted 25
persons, 14 of whom have been arrested. No
Guardsmen were indicted.
"These kids have declared war on society," the
story quoted Ford as saying. "People had better wake
up."
At his home in Aurora, north of Akron, Ford said
yesterday, "All I have to say today is that I've been

misquoted and I don't care to comment at this time.
Asked what he objected to in particular, Ford said,
"That's what I don't want to comment on at this time.
I'm still under the court order which prohibits persons
involved with the grand jury from talking to newsmen
and I should not have given the interview."
Cal Admissions
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gov. Reagan said yesterday
the state should think about changing its state college
and university admission policies to eliminate students
who "are just marking time."
"We're going to have to review our thinking," the
Republican governor said in response to a question
about the growing difficulty of finding room for
students on state campuses.
"Can we guarantee forever that anyone who wants
to get into college can go? You have many young
people in there that are not really interested, that are
just marking time.
"Students should be there only if they're
interested." Reagan didn't suggest specific alternatives
to present admission policies, which require a certain
academic ranking in the potential student's high school
class.
UAW Optimistic
DETROIT (AP) — Contending the two sides are more
than halfway home in troublesome local working
agreements, United Auto Workers President Leonard
Woodcock is urging stepped-up economic bargaining to
end a six-week-old General Motors strike.
The strike began Sept. 15 to support the UAW's
wide-ranging demands for increased wages and fringe
benefits. It has idled more than 400 ,000 workers at
GM plants across the United States and Canada.
D.C. Bomb Blast
WASHINGTON (AP) - A bomb hidden in a package
exploded on a conveyor in the main Post Office
building here last night, police said.
A postal employee, identified as Walter Smith, 30,
was taken to a hospital but released. "He was more
frightened than anything else," a hospital spokesman
said.
Police had no immediate assessment of damage in
the building, about two blocks north of the Capitol.
