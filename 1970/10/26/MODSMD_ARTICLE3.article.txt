# Walker Claims Overseas Program 'Healthy'
## 
### PHIL MYERS 
Despite the use of Mills College
coeds to fill vacancies at the Stanford
Overseas campuses, program director
Robert Walker doesn't "see any real
signs of ill health" in the overseas
program.
Ten Mills girls are presently studying
at the German campus and
approximately that number will head
for Stanford-in-Austria this coming
March.
A San Jose Mercury article last
Tuesday claimed that an increased
desire to participate in political activity
at home was causing Stanford students
to drop out of the overseas program
thus necessitating the use of girls from
the Oakland college. It quoted Walker
as saying "So many (students) were
feeling this so deeply, so emotionally
they wanted to stay here to make their
presence felt."
Overseas Program Healthy
Walker claims his phone interview
with Mercury staffer Chuck Anderson
was poorly reported, and in a Daily

interview Friday explained the use of
the Mills girls and commented on the
general health of Stanford's Overseas
campus program, the nation's largest.
Walker sees the current vacancies at
the German and Austrian campuses as a
"fluctuation of interest towards
different campuses" rather than as
representative of any general decline of
the program. He did concede that "the
program had a disproportionate
number of drops last spring" and that
there is a lessened tendency of students
to follow through after being selected
to go.
However, the "problem is primarily
a shortage of women," he said.
Practice has shown that the
campuses function better socially as the
male to female ratio approaches one to
one. For this reason a lower ration
(5 :3 ) is maintained overseas than at the
home campus. As a result, the available
"pool of women is much more acutely
used" that that of men.
Vacancies Well Publicized
Walker claimed that vacancies were
well publicized on campus and that the

failures of a "very intensive effort" to
find Stanford females to go abroad
necessitated the turn to Mills.
The arrangement with Mills is
"strictly ad hoc" Walker said, seeming
to contradict the Mercury report that
the arrangement, a "cooperative
program" in its terms, is expected to
continue. The Mercury attributed its
statement to unnamed "Stanford
officials."
By the end of last Winter quarter,
the latest application period, the
Overseas campus office had received
415 applications from men and 25 6
from women for a total of 671 . This
total is "well in line" with that of past
years Walker stated, claiming that 700
applications is about the most that ever
come in for the 400 slots.
Following last Spring's disorders an
usually high number of students
already selected to go abroad from that
Winter application group dropped out
of the program.
Dropouts Increase
The overseas campus office has not
done any systematic survey of the

drops to discover why they cancelled.
Walker speculated that a wide "variety
of factors" was to blame. The
decreasing cost of summer travel for
students in Europe is "one of the
numerous" factors involved, and one of
the lesser, he said. Walker speculated
that "women generally won't do it (go
overseas)."
Walker also cited the "fear of being
too far from where the action is" as a
possible reason for the drop as well as
the recession.
The current financial picture
nationally could well have been
involved, he also speculated. Students
this year cannot afford to lose a
summer's income and parents'
resources are lessened. The increased
costs at school this year also might
come into play.
Dr. Robert North, professor of
Political Science, who accompanied one
group to Austria last year, speculates
that the drops from the program might
have been stimulated by a change in
conditions at home.
