## Class Notes For America's Future

1 969 (late) - 1973.
Radical activities are felt
throughout U.S. After Cambodian
turmoil activism other than
ecological goes underground. On
the average during this time
governmental buildings bombed
once a month. On the popular
front Agnewism is gaining support
and mass law and order rallies are
held by Agnew during the 1972
Nixon campaign. Rallies take
place in 12 ballparks throughout
the middle east and midwest.
Nixon's 1972 victory is smashing
as Vietnam is almost totally
dropped as a political topic. (Asof
Jan. 1 972 the U.S. has 16,000
men in Vietnam all in an "advisor
status", continued to supply
South Vietnam, peace talks had
broken off, 8,000 advisors in
Cambodia, and the bombing of
Laos continued.) After Nixon's

victory (accompanied by 3/5
Republican majority in Congress)
bombing and revolutionary
activity stopped throughout the
country except New York City
and Washington D.C. Throughout
1973, 1 7 buildings were blown up
in these two cities. The Law &
Order rallies continued even
though the election was over.
August 23,1973
Four blasts hit Washington
D.C. (Congress is in joint session
to discuss the Brazilian Crisis,
Nixon at the White House—to
appear there in one hour-Agnew
at a rally in Tampa) and the
Capitol is destroyed. The building
is totally demolished, and all in
attendance die. Nixon places
Washington under martial law and
calls for an immediate governors'
conference in Richmond, Virginia
- which is also placed under
martial law. Because most of the
Congress has died in the blast the
Legislatures of each state are to
send 5 representatives to act as an
interim congress. Congressional
elections will take place in four
months.
August 30,1 973
Nixon's helicopter explodes in
mid-air on return trip to
Washington (bomb, shot down,
mechanical failure?). At 2 :30 p.m.
EST Spiro Agnew is sworn in as
the 38th President of the United
States of America. He places the
Country under martial law. Elect
ions suspended for one year to
secure order in the country and
campaign procedures may start in
six months. There is some outcry
from the left wing, but it is not
that great.
October 17,1973
(With martial law still in effect)
23 Weathermen after a military
trial are executed at Fort Dix.
March 6,1974
At this point, about March 6th,
a peoples army sets out from

Berkeley: their purpose is to
assassinate Agnew. The 30,000
member force is stopped in a brief
clash is Utah. Most are given 20
year sentences. 8 7 leaders are
executed: it is treason to attempt
the overthrow of the United
States Government. Martial
continues with frequent bombings
occurring in (mostly vacant)
government buildings throughout
the country.
July 4,1974
Martial law is suspended in the
U.S. and the courts reopen.
Elections will take place in
February.

5 0 years minimum to even imply
the overthrow of the United
States Government or any kind of
civil violence.
April 1975
Campaigns for Congress begin.
October 1975
Congress and Senate elected
with a 4/5 Republican majority.
January 1976
By this time the legislatures of
all states but Massachusetts are at
least 2/3 Agnewist. On the 24 th
Congress abolishes the first ten
amendments to the Constitution
stating that their ambiguity is
suspect and that they are archaic.

The 28 th Amendment is also
adopted giving the Congress
power to make Federal laws on
any subject outside the
Constitution. The first few laws
deal with the rights of the U.S.
citizens and states that it is illegal
to infringe upon those rights. The
29 th Amendment is then adopted
and gives Congress power to
suspend any constitutional
amendment for a limited time
given special cause. All state
legislatures vote in favor of all
three amendments.
July 4,197 6
The 2 00th anniversary of the
Revolution on July 4th 177 6 is

newly constructed 1 million seat
stadium.
Nov. 197 6
Agnew is re-elected.
December 1976
A rash of bombings occurs
along the Canadian border in the
United States. Agnew threatens a
limited policing action to clear
out radicals in Canada.
July 197 7
The biggest 4 th celebration in
history takes place near Columbus
Ohio as 6 million people arrive to
hear Agnew speak at the new 2
million seat stadium.
August 1 97 7
The Canadian-U.S. situation
grows tense as U.S. threatens to
purge Canada unless it turns over
the "revolutionaries it is
harboring". Canada denies
knowledge of any revolutionaries
and resents being harassed by the
United States.
September 12,1977
Canada refuses to meet any
U.S. demands and is attacked by 2
million in ground forces and air
support. She falls in two days.

England and France are then
obliterated by a salvo of atomic
bombs for attempting to help
Canada. The bombs come from
both the U.S. and Russia. The
same is the fate of China as 12
major cities are destroyed.

By this time the U.S. has
annexed Canada, the Formosan
government is re-established in
China, and on Dec. 4th thru the
7th Israel is conquered by the

March 1977
Through strenous efforts by
