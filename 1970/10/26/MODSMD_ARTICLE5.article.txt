# straight hang-ups
## Adjusting To Gay Life 
### 
The ratio was one of the reasons I was glad to come to Stanford. I
thought it would be "positive re-enforcement" for heterosexuality. So
I worked at being straight. I went out a fair amount and instead of
admitting that I was gay I accused myself of being frigid. For much as
I tried, and liked a guy, I never fell in love with him.
Eventually (and I was slow despite my Stanford brilliance), I
realized that just making up my mind couldn't make me straight. And
by playing this masquerade not only was I hurting myself, but also the
guys I was going out with. I then admitted my feelings to myself, but
that was like crashing into a wall. The guilt feelings weren't nearly so
strong as the horror I had at feeling myself to be the only one.
Meanwhile my closest friends didn't know. I was afraid of telling them
partly in fear of rejection, but more for fear they would take the
announcement as a pass (I have been told straight people are often
afraid that homosexuals will attack and rape someone of the same sex,
if not in reality at least in their mind).
Then I met a gay man and we talked. And as I accepted being gay,
the world seemed to turn over, and I almost couldn't remember why I
had ever wanted to be straight. Life improved. We went to bars
together. God, to see that gay women do exist other than in scattered
novels, and that some look nice, was almost unbelievable. But I was
terrified to go to the bars
Once more people had to assume a covering, a style, unnatural to
them, and one of the qualities about homosexuality that has always
appealed to me is its frequent breakdown of role-playing. Each person
is equally responsible for the relationship. And the bars denied that
for me; yet again people had to fight themselves and learn to act cool.
But then I'd get lonely at Stanford and return to the bars. Once
inside, I'd think there was something wrong with me for not being
able to put on an impressive show.
Women's Liberation
Meanwhile I avoided Women's Liberation much as I believed in it
because I didn't want their movement to be degraded and labelled by
my presence even if I remained hidden. Somehow by beginning to
accept myself more, I told one of my best friends. She was surprised -
I had done a good acting job, and yet she wasn't surprised in that the
knowledge made some of my apparent inconsistencies fit together.
She thought it was fine and only different than being straight in the
formation of different experiences and perspectives of the world. I
was touched. And I felt more together.

When I went home I went to GLF (Gay Liberation Front) meetings.
Finally my political sense and personal merged and here were some of
the nicest, friendliest people I'd ever seen. Hardly one fulfilled any of
the "Dyke" stereotypes,and no one had black boots and a whip. Most
of them had had it hard enough, they, we, were going to be nice to
each other. And when we had a dance, often there would be circle
dances so on one would be left out.
Then when I returned here I started going to the city. I now saw
Women's Liberation as very much my own cause. I also joined the
newly forming Gay Woman's Liberation. I told my friends and they
were glad that I'd come out, and was so much happier. Still I've got
the small town syndrome and am still a closet queen to the extent I
don't want to include my name here.
The Road To Here
The road to the present is often easier to describe than to figure
out where my feet are. I am glad to be gay, though I don't hold it up
as people do a religion. Fine if you are, fine if you aren't; but damn, if
you are, don't let other people like psychiatrists mess you up about it.
But I also want to clear up two myths - first I've heard some men
say, all a Lesbian needs is one night in bed with a virile man. That
statement shows the public perspective of a Lesbian as a woman who
lacks something, rather than one who loves another woman. (Any one
who can love in this society should be praised.) But a discussion about
that gets wishy-washy and I can't give it justice.
And other myth people believe is that gay women hate men, That's
ridiculous. Some do, but some straight women hkte men, and straight
men hate women. That myth also implies that the only way two
people can relate is in bed, and that I refuse to accept. One of the
values of Gay Liberation, Gay Woman's Liberation and Woman's
Liberation is their denial that sexual identity depends on a dominance
that forces people to step on others to prove themselves. That's got to
go.
As to what's happening, there are meetings of the various groups
and maybe someday something might happen here. The Gay Student
Union at Berkeley will be holding a dance for both women and men
on October 30th in the Pauley Ballroom at 9 p.m. "The Cleveland
Wrecking Company" and "Loose Gravel" will be performing. Hope to
see lots of Stanford people there.

When I went home I went to GLF (Gay Liberation Front) meetings.
Finally my political sense and personal merged and here were some of
the nicest, friendliest people I'd ever seen. Hardly one fulfilled any of
the "Dyke" stereotypes,and no one had black boots and a whip. Most
of them had had it hard enough, they, we, were going to be nice to
each other. And when we had a dance, often there would be circle
dances so on one would be left out.
Then when I returned here I started going to the city. I now saw
Women's Liberation as very much my own cause. I also joined the
newly forming Gay Woman's Liberation. I told my friends and they
were glad that I'd come out, and was so much happier. Still I've got
the small town syndrome and am still a closet queen to the extent I
don't want to include my name here.
The Road To Here
The road to the present is often easier to describe than to figure
out where my feet are. I am glad to be gay, though I don't hold it up
as people do a religion. Fine if you are, fine if you aren't; but damn, if
you are, don't let other people like psychiatrists mess you up about it.
But I also want to clear up two myths - first I've heard some men
say, all a Lesbian needs is one night in bed with a virile man. That
statement shows the public perspective of a Lesbian as a woman who
lacks something, rather than one who loves another woman. (Any one
who can love in this society should be praised.) But a discussion about
that gets wishy-washy and I can't give it justice.
And other myth people believe is that gay women hate men, That's
ridiculous. Some do, but some straight women hkte men, and straight
men hate women. That myth also implies that the only way two
people can relate is in bed, and that I refuse to accept. One of the
values of Gay Liberation, Gay Woman's Liberation and Woman's
Liberation is their denial that sexual identity depends on a dominance
that forces people to step on others to prove themselves. That's got to
go.
As to what's happening, there are meetings of the various groups
and maybe someday something might happen here. The Gay Student
Union at Berkeley will be holding a dance for both women and men
on October 30th in the Pauley Ballroom at 9 p.m. "The Cleveland
Wrecking Company" and "Loose Gravel" will be performing. Hope to
see lots of Stanford people there.

The ratio was one of the reasons I was glad to come to Stanford. I
thought it would be "positive re-enforcement" for heterosexuality. So
I worked at being straight. I went out a fair amount and instead of
admitting that I was gay I accused myself of being frigid. For much as
I tried, and liked a guy, I never fell in love with him.
Eventually (and I was slow despite my Stanford brilliance), I
realized that just making up my mind couldn't make me straight. And
by playing this masquerade not only was I hurting myself, but also the
guys I was going out with. I then admitted my feelings to myself, but
that was like crashing into a wall. The guilt feelings weren't nearly so
strong as the horror I had at feeling myself to be the only one.
Meanwhile my closest friends didn't know. I was afraid of telling them
partly in fear of rejection, but more for fear they would take the
announcement as a pass (I have been told straight people are often
afraid that homosexuals will attack and rape someone of the same sex,
if not in reality at least in their mind).
Then I met a gay man and we talked. And as I accepted being gay,
the world seemed to turn over, and I almost couldn't remember why I
had ever wanted to be straight. Life improved. We went to bars
together. God, to see that gay women do exist other than in scattered
novels, and that some look nice, was almost unbelievable. But I was
terrified to go to the bars
Once more people had to assume a covering, a style, unnatural to
them, and one of the qualities about homosexuality that has always
appealed to me is its frequent breakdown of role-playing. Each person
is equally responsible for the relationship. And the bars denied that
for me; yet again people had to fight themselves and learn to act cool.
But then I'd get lonely at Stanford and return to the bars. Once
inside, I'd think there was something wrong with me for not being
able to put on an impressive show.
Women's Liberation
Meanwhile I avoided Women's Liberation much as I believed in it
because I didn't want their movement to be degraded and labelled by
my presence even if I remained hidden. Somehow by beginning to
accept myself more, I told one of my best friends. She was surprised -
I had done a good acting job, and yet she wasn't surprised in that the
knowledge made some of my apparent inconsistencies fit together.
She thought it was fine and only different than being straight in the
formation of different experiences and perspectives of the world. I
was touched. And I felt more together.

The ratio was one of the reasons I was glad to come to Stanford. I
thought it would be "positive re-enforcement" for heterosexuality. So
I worked at being straight. I went out a fair amount and instead of
admitting that I was gay I accused myself of being frigid. For much as
I tried, and liked a guy, I never fell in love with him.
Eventually (and I was slow despite my Stanford brilliance), I
realized that just making up my mind couldn't make me straight. And
by playing this masquerade not only was I hurting myself, but also the
guys I was going out with. I then admitted my feelings to myself, but
that was like crashing into a wall. The guilt feelings weren't nearly so
strong as the horror I had at feeling myself to be the only one.
Meanwhile my closest friends didn't know. I was afraid of telling them
partly in fear of rejection, but more for fear they would take the
announcement as a pass (I have been told straight people are often
afraid that homosexuals will attack and rape someone of the same sex,
if not in reality at least in their mind).
Then I met a gay man and we talked. And as I accepted being gay,
the world seemed to turn over, and I almost couldn't remember why I
had ever wanted to be straight. Life improved. We went to bars
together. God, to see that gay women do exist other than in scattered
novels, and that some look nice, was almost unbelievable. But I was
terrified to go to the bars
Once more people had to assume a covering, a style, unnatural to
them, and one of the qualities about homosexuality that has always
appealed to me is its frequent breakdown of role-playing. Each person
is equally responsible for the relationship. And the bars denied that
for me; yet again people had to fight themselves and learn to act cool.
But then I'd get lonely at Stanford and return to the bars. Once
inside, I'd think there was something wrong with me for not being
able to put on an impressive show.
Women's Liberation
Meanwhile I avoided Women's Liberation much as I believed in it
because I didn't want their movement to be degraded and labelled by
my presence even if I remained hidden. Somehow by beginning to
accept myself more, I told one of my best friends. She was surprised -
I had done a good acting job, and yet she wasn't surprised in that the
knowledge made some of my apparent inconsistencies fit together.
She thought it was fine and only different than being straight in the
formation of different experiences and perspectives of the world. I
was touched. And I felt more together.

When I went home I went to GLF (Gay Liberation Front) meetings.
Finally my political sense and personal merged and here were some of
the nicest, friendliest people I'd ever seen. Hardly one fulfilled any of
the "Dyke" stereotypes,and no one had black boots and a whip. Most
of them had had it hard enough, they, we, were going to be nice to
each other. And when we had a dance, often there would be circle
dances so on one would be left out.
Then when I returned here I started going to the city. I now saw
Women's Liberation as very much my own cause. I also joined the
newly forming Gay Woman's Liberation. I told my friends and they
were glad that I'd come out, and was so much happier. Still I've got
the small town syndrome and am still a closet queen to the extent I
don't want to include my name here.
The Road To Here
The road to the present is often easier to describe than to figure
out where my feet are. I am glad to be gay, though I don't hold it up
as people do a religion. Fine if you are, fine if you aren't; but damn, if
you are, don't let other people like psychiatrists mess you up about it.
But I also want to clear up two myths - first I've heard some men
say, all a Lesbian needs is one night in bed with a virile man. That
statement shows the public perspective of a Lesbian as a woman who
lacks something, rather than one who loves another woman. (Any one
who can love in this society should be praised.) But a discussion about
that gets wishy-washy and I can't give it justice.
And other myth people believe is that gay women hate men, That's
ridiculous. Some do, but some straight women hkte men, and straight
men hate women. That myth also implies that the only way two
people can relate is in bed, and that I refuse to accept. One of the
values of Gay Liberation, Gay Woman's Liberation and Woman's
Liberation is their denial that sexual identity depends on a dominance
that forces people to step on others to prove themselves. That's got to
go.
As to what's happening, there are meetings of the various groups
and maybe someday something might happen here. The Gay Student
Union at Berkeley will be holding a dance for both women and men
on October 30th in the Pauley Ballroom at 9 p.m. "The Cleveland
Wrecking Company" and "Loose Gravel" will be performing. Hope to
see lots of Stanford people there.
