## conrad Lockheed's Story 
### 
On Wednesday, Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation comes to
Stanford to recruit engineers to
help the Lockheed management
conduct its business.
To encourage the Stanford
community to voice its opinion to
President Lyman so that he may
meditate on the present ordering
of our university's priorities, we
are pleased to present the
following introduction to that
Southeast Santa Clara County
corporation, Lockheed Aircraft.
This discussion of Lockheed's role
in American militarism is intended
to stimulate the community to
reflect on the wisdom of
continuing to send Stanford boys
to support Lockheed's war effort.
The Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation has been the nation's
number one defence contractor in
6 out of the last 10 years. With 8 8
percent of its sales going to the
government, Lockheed in fiscal
year 1969 received 5 .5 percent of
all funds awarded by the Defense
Department.
In the same year, one division
of Lockheed received more
money for research and
development than any other
entire company in the
country—the Lockheed Missies
and Space Company (LMSC). It
occupies 625 acres of a former
peach orchard in Sunnyvale, a
Research Laboratory in the
Stanford Industrial Park, and
4000 acres in the Santa Cruz
mountains which it uses for
weapons testing. The largest
employer in Santa Clara County,
LMSC once employed as many as
27,000 workers, but recent
layoffs are expected to bring
employment below 17,000 by the
end of this year.
Lockheed's Contributions
LMSC's primary contributions
to the defense effort have been
the Agena satellite and the Polaris
and Poseidon missiles. The Agena
has been launched over 300 times,
including the series of the Air
Force's secret spy satellites which
relay reconnaissance data from
North Vietnam. In develoment
and production at LMSC since
1954, the Polaris is the
nuclear-armed missile carried on
our nuclear submarines. The
Poseidon is a MIRV-equipped
version of the Polaris for which
LMSC has a $2 billion contract
extending through 1974.

For 4 years LMSC conducted
company financed studies of a
successor to the Poseidon. In
fiscal year 1969 the Navy
formulated its concept for the
Underwater Long-Range Missile
System (ULMS), which is to have
over twice the range of Poseidon,
providing increased flexibility in
deployment around the world.
Not surprisingly, the initial
development contracts for the
ULMS went to LMSC. According
to one authoritative source, "With
the conceptual study contract
from the Strategic Systems
Project Office of the Naval
Material Comnjand already in
hand, plus its experience with
Polaris and Poseidon, Lockheed
must be regarded as the only
serious contender for the missile
engineering and production
follow-on job." It is estimated
that deployment of 600 ULMS
missiles will cost in excess of $12
billion, comparable to that of the
controversial ABM system.
Because of these programs,
LMSC is financially fairly
stable—that is, compared to the
other divisions of Lockheed
aircraft. In March, Lockheed
asked the Defense Department for
$641 million to keep it from
going bankrupt. Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard bent
over backward trying to comply
with Lockheed's request. He
persuaded 24 of the nation's
largest banks to underwrite loans,
convinced Congress to approve a
$200 million assistance payment,
and even offered to buy $100
million of Lockheed's inventory.
Packard's Interest
It is not surprising that Packard
is so interested in preserving
Lockheed. The primary reason is
the C-5 A transport aircraft, which
ironically is also the primary
source of Lockheed's financial
problems. The C-5 A is the world's
largest airplane, designed
specifically for contingencies such
as those precipitating the
incursions into Lebanon and the
Dominican Republic of the past
decade. Said President Lyndon
Johnson, "For the first time, our
fighting men will be able to travel
with their equipment to any spot
on the globe where we might be
forced to stand—rapidly and more
efficiently than ever." A more
succinct appraisal was given by
General James Ferguson, Chief of

the Air Force Systems Command,
who described the C-5 A as "an
extremely versatile instrument of
national policy."
Another new Lockheed
product of major interest to the
Defense Department is the
Cheyenne helicopter, intended to
provide the Army with a high
speed, heavily armed helicopter
for fire support of ground forces
under all conditions of weather
and lighting. The Cheyenne
incorporates a number of
technological advances, including
an infrared night vision sensor, a
laser rangefinder, automatic
terrain-following radar, and
computer controlled navigation
and gunfire control systems. This
last system has the feature that
the guns automatically point
wherever the pilot looks—all he
has to do is turn his head and press
a button.
Cheyenne's Significance
The importance of the
Cheyenne was explained by
General William B. Bunker, who
negotiated the Cheyenne contract.
He said the Cheyenne "is
exceptionally well suited to the
type of conflict we are currently
fighting in Southeast Asia."
Furthermore, "it is the only type
of aircraft that makes sense for
use by South American countries
faced with the insurgent guerilla
threat."
Other Lockheed airplanes have
been supporting the war effort for
years. The C-13 0 transport has
delivered more troops and cargo

within Vietnam than all other
aircraft combined. Between
Vietnam and the United States
the C-141 has achieved a similar
record. F-ICi fighters have filled
the skies of Vietnam since 1965.
A version of the C-121 presently
flies intelligence missions from
Northern Japan down to
Thailand, eavesdropping on
Russia, Communist China, North
Korea, and North Vietnam. The
U-2, which gained fame when it
was shot down over Russia in
1960, and the Sr-71, which flies
faster than three times the speed
of sound, fly reconnaissance
missions over North Vietnam and
Communist China from the Udorn
airbase in Thailand.
Contributions of LMSC include
the YO-3A quiet reconnaissance
aircraft already in use in Vietnam,
and the Twister, which Lockheed
envisions as the tank of the
198 0 's. Other current contracts
include work on a "super-secret
truck spotting device" for use
over Cambodia and Laos to detect
Communist supply lines, and
work on the ' Hudson Moon"
underground nuclear testing
program. LMSC's diversification
into non-military information
systems has resulted in the
Medical Information System
(which has not yet been sold after
five years of development) and
the Drug Decision Program, which
is already in use by over 4 0 school
systems around the country.
