## 'Common Sense' Proposals 
### 
(The following column is the second half of a statement by Sidney
Hook, New York University professor of philosophy and head of
University Centers for Rational Alternatives. This article was sent
earlier this fall by President Nixon to all college presidents.)
It is no exaggeration to say that on many American campuses
today academic freedom has been severely crippled. Certain extremist
groups have interfered with the rights of students and faculty to hear
views that disagree with or challenge their own. The aftermath of the
so-called Free Speech Movement at Berkeley is that in many areas free
speech has disappeared at that campus. And not only at Berkeley.
At scores of universities speakers are shouted down, sometimes
assaulted. While spokesmen for movements hostile to the government
have unlimited freedom to incite to violent action in opposing
government policies, spokesmen for these policies are often barred
from campuses or can appear only under heavy police escort.
By and large, in these institutions faculty and administration either
remain silent or issue ineffectual releases mildly deprecating the worst
excesses. Even when official guests of the university have been
insulted or scandalously mistreated, they seem loath to introduce or
enforce disciplinary action. On some campuses fanatical student
extremists have disrupted with relative impunity classes of professors
of whom they have disapproved.
And most shameful of all, these students have faculty allies who
encourage and extenuate attacks on the academic freedom of their
colleagues.
Politicized Universities
It is clearly demonstrable that universities which permit themselves
to be politicalized are betraying their mission to serve as "citadels of
reason, sanity, and civility in a deeply troubled world." Although
opportunistic administrators with flexible backbones have opened the
doors to the academic vandals, in the last analysis it has been the
faculties who have been chiefly responsible for the decline in
academic freedom. For they have lacked the moral courage to uphold
the professional standards of their calling as teachers.
It remains to be asked: what is to be done? What measures must be
adopted to insure a change in the climate of violence and
confrontation that has engulfed so many of our colleges and
universities?
The following tactical proposals have emerged out of a union of
experience and common sense. They are not to be blindly followed
anywhere or everywhere, but are to be adapted to specific
emergencies.
Constituent Assembly
I—The first thing to do is to convoke an assembly of the
constituent bodies of the university community—faculty, students and
administrators—or their representatives. Its chief order of business
should be to draft the principles that are to serve as guidelines
affecting the expression of dissent on any matter of interest to the
academy whether great or small. The principles should then be
followed by specific rules of implementation that spell out
clearly—among other things—the kinds of conduct and behavior that
shall constitute prima facte violations of the limits of legitimate
dissent.
2—The rules implementing the principles should make provision for
the establishment of a representative faculty-student discipline
committee. The procedures for conducting hearings and the rules of
behavior for defendants, complainants and witnesses should be
explicitly endorsed by the academic community or its representatives.
The rules should clearly set forth the sanctions to be invoked against
members of the academic community, not only students but teachers

as well, who disrupt the judicial proceedings of the discipline
committee.
3—Violations of rules should be promptly punished by the
appropriate sanctions.
Forcible Disruption
4—ln the event of forcible disruption of the academic process, the
first line of defense should be faculty and student marshals, equipped
with cameras, empowered by the academic community to maintain
order, report participants, and remain in liaison with the responsible
officers of the university.
s—When a situation acquires a gravity beyond the power of faculty
and student marshals to cope with it, the administrative authorities,
after consultation with the executive or other appropriate committee
of the academic community, should apply to the courts for injunctive
relief without suspending their own sanctions.
6—lf the court injunction is disregarded, its enforcement should be
left to the civil authorities.
Student Violence
7—lf and when matters reach an extreme pass and hazards to life
and limb from student violence—arson, assault, vandalism—can be
contained only by use of police power, faculty and student marshals
should accompany law enforcement officers so that their mission can
be accomplished without force where resistance is not offered, and
with minimum force where it is.
B—Where the scale of violence, for example, through intervention
by large outside non-student forces, takes on a magnitude that makes
the previous steps inadequate or creates an atmosphere in which
teaching and learning are impossible, the university may have to shut
down for a limited period, and the perservation of life and academic
property entrusted to the civil authorities. In such a case, before
reopening, academic sanctions against those found guilty of violence
or inciting to violence, whether students or members of the faculty,
should be strictly enforced. Amnesty for "crimes of academic
genocide" can only invite their repetition.
These measures are designed to preserve or restore peace on the
campuses, to forestall costly and senseless acts of violence, and to
obviate the inescapable punitive legislation which continued violence
will precipitate. I wish to conclude, however, with the reminder that
in the long run the most serious threat to the integrity of teaching and
learning comes not from the criminal violence of extremists but from
measures of appeasement and capitulation in the vain hope of curbing
their frenzy.
Bewildered and Hysterical
The wounds that the academy may inflict on itself in its
bewildered and hysterical efforts to ward off further attacks by its
enemies, chiefly the enemies within its own walls, may prove most
dangerous to the survival of academic freedom without which the
university is undeserving of its name.
The history of American higher education is a history of change.
Violence has never played an appreciable role in that history. It need
not play a role today if it is recognized that the primary function of
higher education is the quest for knowledge, wisdom and vision, not
the conquest of political power; that the university is not responsible
for the existence of war, poverty and other evils; and that the solution
of these and allied problems lies in the hands of the democratic
citizenry and not of a privileged elite.
The universities can by indirection help in their solution by
providing the knowledge, wisdom, and vision required lor intelligent
action—but only if it retains its relative autonomy and objectivity, and
freedom from partisan political bias.
