# 'the green revolution'
## Behind The Nobel Prize 
### 
For the first time since Martin
Luther King won it in 1964, an
American has been chosen to
receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The
recipient is not a politician or
diplomat or civil rights leader or
nuclear scientist as previous
American winners have been. He
follows a seemingly more humble
calling: Plant pathology.
His name is Norman Ernest
Borlaug, and he is head of the
Rockefeller Agricultural Institute
in Mexico. Besides having the
fortuitous gift of Norweigan
ancestry, Borlaug is a leading light
in a phenomenon which has been
dubbed the "Green Revolution."
The "Green Revolution" is the
outcome of some twenty-five
years of scientific research aimed
at developing grain varieties which
could absorb high amounts of
fertilizer. Traditional
long-stemmed grains become so
top-heavy that they fall over once
a certain level of fertilizer
application has been passed. The
resolution to this dilemma lay in
the development of sturdy,
short-strawed grains. It was a
group of Japanese scientists who
were the first ones to isolate the
crucial dwarfing gene. In 1947,
the U.S. Department of
Agriculture brought the gene to
the United States and soon
adapted it to growing conditions
on the Pacific Northwest.
A few years before, in 1944,
the Rockefeller Foundation set up
an agricultural research institute
in Mexico city at the invitation of
the Mexican government. The
purpose of this institute was to
develop hybrids suitable to

conditions which prevailed in
Mexico and other underdeveloped
countries.
Dr. Borlaug succeeded Dr.
George Harrar — who later
became President of the
Rockefeller Foundation — as
director of the Institute. He led
the researchers in the
development of highly adaptable,
high-yielding varieties of wheat
which were, eventually, to find
themselves equally at home in the
hot plains of Pakestan and India
and the rugged mountains of
Turkey.
Large Surpluses
While Dr. Borlaug and his
compatriots were doing their
experiments, the United States
was exporting vast quantities of
grain and accumulating enormous
surpluses. In the post-war years,
American farmers were still
producing at their wartime pace,
and there were millions of hungry
people in the world.
Clearly, the traditional
international marketplace - which
had already broken down severely
in the depression years - could not
effectively move the wheat from
the granaries of Kansas and
Minnesota to the bakeries of
Palermo and Calcutta. Thus a host
of new devices were created: the
Marshall Plan, the Mutual Security
Agency, and, most important,
Public Law 48 0, which provided
for concessional sales of American
commodities for local currency,
the proceeds going to American
military expenditures,
propaganda, cultural and
educational "exchanges" and
other such worthy endeavors.
Throughout the fifties and
early sixties, the American farmer
got his price supports - though not
as high as he perhaps wished - and
the Indians got fed - though not
nearly as much as they needed.
And in the process, institutions
such as AID got a lot of rupees to
fool around with.
Turning Point
1966 marked a turning point.
In that year, and in 1967,
monsoon failures led to severe
deficits in India's grain

production. Heavy PL 480
shipments drained off what had
been America's huge surplus. At
this point, the work of Dr.
Borlaug and of the
Ford-Rockefeller sponsored
International Rice Research
Institute at Los Banos in the
Philippines entered the scene with
their "miracle grains".
The miracle grains hold out the
promise of making
grain-importing nations
self-suffieient or even surplus
producers. Dr. Borlaut's work
should bring peace of mind to all
those who made a profession or
hobby of worrying about famine.
To those people it should seem
quite right and natural that Dr.
Borlaut has received the Peace
Prize.
But the "Green Revolution"
brings with it a host of new
problems. First, it will most likely
transform nations of small
landowners and tenants into
nations of large-scale mechanized
capitalist-type farms with huge
dispossessed rural proletariats.
Second it will probably never
occur in poorer, less
commercialized regions — the
result will be ahost of "Appalachias"
Glut on Grain
Third, there will most likely to
a glut on the world grain markets.
Prices will plummet. Governments
will either strangle themselves in
subsidy programs - or else sweat
the money out of the urban
masses in exorbitant good prices -
in order to keep the green
revolutionary farmers in business.
Also on the short end of the stick
will be the American farmer
whose export outlets will shrivel
up.
Already, the "Green
Revolution" is showing streaks of
red. Dispossessed peasants in India
have tried to seize land only to be
arrested by the hundreds. Miracle

grain technology produced an
ecological disaster in East
Pakistan, and a balance of
payments crisis in the Philippines.
Dr. Borlaug did precisely what
he set out to do: produce
high-yielding grain varieties. But
as for peace, only one thing seems
certain; that the peace and
security of the peasant village, for
what it was worth, the vision
which inspired that most
emminent of Mexicans, 'Miliano
Zapata, will be destroyed if not
by the bomb, by the tractor.

grain technology produced an
ecological disaster in East
Pakistan, and a balance of
payments crisis in the Philippines.
Dr. Borlaug did precisely what
he set out to do: produce
high-yielding grain varieties. But
as for peace, only one thing seems
certain; that the peace and
security of the peasant village, for
what it was worth, the vision
which inspired that most
emminent of Mexicans, 'Miliano
Zapata, will be destroyed if not
by the bomb, by the tractor.

graduate and a member of the
New Left Project.)
For the first time since Martin
Luther King won it in 1964, an
American has been chosen to
receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The
recipient is not a politician or
diplomat or civil rights leader or
nuclear scientist as previous
American winners have been. He
follows a seemingly more humble
calling: Plant pathology.
His name is Norman Ernest
Borlaug, and he is head of the
Rockefeller Agricultural Institute
in Mexico. Besides having the
fortuitous gift of Norweigan
ancestry, Borlaug is a leading light
in a phenomenon which has been
dubbed the "Green Revolution."
The "Green Revolution" is the
outcome of some twenty-five
years of scientific research aimed
at developing grain varieties which
could absorb high amounts of
fertilizer. Traditional
long-stemmed grains become so
top-heavy that they fall over once
a certain level of fertilizer
application has been passed. The
resolution to this dilemma lay in
the development of sturdy,
short-strawed grains. It was a
group of Japanese scientists who
were the first ones to isolate the
crucial dwarfing gene. In 1947,
the U.S. Department of
Agriculture brought the gene to
the United States and soon
adapted it to growing conditions
on the Pacific Northwest.
A few years before, in 1944,
the Rockefeller Foundation set up
an agricultural research institute
in Mexico city at the invitation of
the Mexican government. The
purpose of this institute was to
develop hybrids suitable to

conditions which prevailed in
Mexico and other underdeveloped
countries.
Dr. Borlaug succeeded Dr.
George Harrar — who later
became President of the
Rockefeller Foundation — as
director of the Institute. He led
the researchers in the
development of highly adaptable,
high-yielding varieties of wheat
which were, eventually, to find
themselves equally at home in the
hot plains of Pakestan and India
and the rugged mountains of
Turkey.
Large Surpluses
While Dr. Borlaug and his
compatriots were doing their
experiments, the United States
was exporting vast quantities of
grain and accumulating enormous
surpluses. In the post-war years,
American farmers were still
producing at their wartime pace,
and there were millions of hungry
people in the world.
Clearly, the traditional
international marketplace - which
had already broken down severely
in the depression years - could not
effectively move the wheat from
the granaries of Kansas and
Minnesota to the bakeries of
Palermo and Calcutta. Thus a host
of new devices were created: the
Marshall Plan, the Mutual Security
Agency, and, most important,
Public Law 48 0, which provided
for concessional sales of American
commodities for local currency,
the proceeds going to American
military expenditures,
propaganda, cultural and
educational "exchanges" and
other such worthy endeavors.
Throughout the fifties and
early sixties, the American farmer
got his price supports - though not
as high as he perhaps wished - and
the Indians got fed - though not
nearly as much as they needed.
And in the process, institutions
such as AID got a lot of rupees to
fool around with.
Turning Point
1966 marked a turning point.
In that year, and in 1967,
monsoon failures led to severe
deficits in India's grain

production. Heavy PL 480
shipments drained off what had
been America's huge surplus. At
this point, the work of Dr.
Borlaug and of the
Ford-Rockefeller sponsored
International Rice Research
Institute at Los Banos in the
Philippines entered the scene with
their "miracle grains".
The miracle grains hold out the
promise of making
grain-importing nations
self-suffieient or even surplus
producers. Dr. Borlaut's work
should bring peace of mind to all
those who made a profession or
hobby of worrying about famine.
To those people it should seem
quite right and natural that Dr.
Borlaut has received the Peace
Prize.
But the "Green Revolution"
brings with it a host of new
problems. First, it will most likely
transform nations of small
landowners and tenants into
nations of large-scale mechanized
capitalist-type farms with huge
dispossessed rural proletariats.
Second it will probably never
occur in poorer, less
commercialized regions — the
result will be ahost of "Appalachias"

production. Heavy PL 480
shipments drained off what had
been America's huge surplus. At
this point, the work of Dr.
Borlaug and of the
Ford-Rockefeller sponsored
International Rice Research
Institute at Los Banos in the
Philippines entered the scene with
their "miracle grains".
The miracle grains hold out the
promise of making
grain-importing nations
self-suffieient or even surplus
producers. Dr. Borlaut's work
should bring peace of mind to all
those who made a profession or
hobby of worrying about famine.
To those people it should seem
quite right and natural that Dr.
Borlaut has received the Peace
Prize.
But the "Green Revolution"
brings with it a host of new
problems. First, it will most likely
transform nations of small
landowners and tenants into
nations of large-scale mechanized
capitalist-type farms with huge
dispossessed rural proletariats.
Second it will probably never
occur in poorer, less
commercialized regions — the
result will be ahost of "Appalachias"
Glut on Grain
Third, there will most likely to
a glut on the world grain markets.
Prices will plummet. Governments
will either strangle themselves in
subsidy programs - or else sweat
the money out of the urban
masses in exorbitant good prices -
in order to keep the green
revolutionary farmers in business.
Also on the short end of the stick
will be the American farmer
whose export outlets will shrivel
up.
Already, the "Green
Revolution" is showing streaks of
red. Dispossessed peasants in India
have tried to seize land only to be
arrested by the hundreds. Miracle

grain technology produced an
ecological disaster in East
Pakistan, and a balance of
payments crisis in the Philippines.
Dr. Borlaug did precisely what
he set out to do: produce
high-yielding grain varieties. But
as for peace, only one thing seems
certain; that the peace and
security of the peasant village, for
what it was worth, the vision
which inspired that most
emminent of Mexicans, 'Miliano
Zapata, will be destroyed if not
by the bomb, by the tractor.

For the first time since Martin
Luther King won it in 1964, an
American has been chosen to
receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The
recipient is not a politician or
diplomat or civil rights leader or
nuclear scientist as previous
American winners have been. He
follows a seemingly more humble
calling: Plant pathology.
His name is Norman Ernest
Borlaug, and he is head of the
Rockefeller Agricultural Institute
in Mexico. Besides having the
fortuitous gift of Norweigan
ancestry, Borlaug is a leading light
in a phenomenon which has been
dubbed the "Green Revolution."
The "Green Revolution" is the
outcome of some twenty-five
years of scientific research aimed
at developing grain varieties which
could absorb high amounts of
fertilizer. Traditional
long-stemmed grains become so
top-heavy that they fall over once
a certain level of fertilizer
application has been passed. The
resolution to this dilemma lay in
the development of sturdy,
short-strawed grains. It was a
group of Japanese scientists who
were the first ones to isolate the
crucial dwarfing gene. In 1947,
the U.S. Department of
Agriculture brought the gene to
the United States and soon
adapted it to growing conditions
on the Pacific Northwest.
A few years before, in 1944,
the Rockefeller Foundation set up
an agricultural research institute
in Mexico city at the invitation of
the Mexican government. The
purpose of this institute was to
develop hybrids suitable to

conditions which prevailed in
Mexico and other underdeveloped
countries.
Dr. Borlaug succeeded Dr.
George Harrar — who later
became President of the
Rockefeller Foundation — as
director of the Institute. He led
the researchers in the
development of highly adaptable,
high-yielding varieties of wheat
which were, eventually, to find
themselves equally at home in the
hot plains of Pakestan and India
and the rugged mountains of
Turkey.
Large Surpluses
While Dr. Borlaug and his
compatriots were doing their
experiments, the United States
was exporting vast quantities of
grain and accumulating enormous
surpluses. In the post-war years,
American farmers were still
producing at their wartime pace,
and there were millions of hungry
people in the world.
Clearly, the traditional
international marketplace - which
had already broken down severely
in the depression years - could not
effectively move the wheat from
the granaries of Kansas and
Minnesota to the bakeries of
Palermo and Calcutta. Thus a host
of new devices were created: the
Marshall Plan, the Mutual Security
Agency, and, most important,
Public Law 48 0, which provided
for concessional sales of American
commodities for local currency,
the proceeds going to American
military expenditures,
propaganda, cultural and
educational "exchanges" and
other such worthy endeavors.
Throughout the fifties and
early sixties, the American farmer
got his price supports - though not
as high as he perhaps wished - and
the Indians got fed - though not
nearly as much as they needed.
And in the process, institutions
such as AID got a lot of rupees to
fool around with.
Turning Point
1966 marked a turning point.
In that year, and in 1967,
monsoon failures led to severe
deficits in India's grain

production. Heavy PL 480
shipments drained off what had
been America's huge surplus. At
