# Hard Hats Don't Fit Image

Opinions and political persuasions
among construction workers at
Stanford appear to be as widely
divergent as those of students and
faculty on any contemporary college
campus.
Recent Daily interviews reveal little
support for the popular stereotype of
"pro-war, neo-fascist" hard-hats.
Hard-hats currently working at
Stanford are generally opposed to the
Vietnam war - in direct contrast to New
York workers.
The construction men at Escondido
Village and Campus Drive are a friendly
group, willing to discuss issues of major
concern. The majority have worked
hard all their lives and realize, in the
words of one worker, that "the only
way the working man gets ahead is to
fight the bosses when he has to."
"Worker solidarity" became
apparent during Daily interviews with
the hard-hat workers. "I heard that the
General Motors plant in Fremont
pushes the workers till they burst and
pays them almost nothing,"
commented a laborer whose cousin
works at GM. "It's hard for those men
to strike and not get any pay. I hope
they win their demands and real soon."
The foreman of the common
laborers crew agreed, adding "We have
a strong union. It got that way because
men died fighting for it. Working on an
assembly line is tiring, and those men
are making a lot of money for the
company. They deserve to get some of
it too. But they'll have to fight for it."
Opinions Diverge
Union organizing was one topic that
the interviewed workers basically
agreed upon. On national politics and
campus demonstrations, however, there
was a wide diversity of opinions.
"I fought in Korea and Vietnam
both. It made me sick to see people
demonstrating against me because I was
fighting a war," said one of the
members of the carpenters union.
A black laborer answered his

statement: "The demonstrating isn't
against you or the soldiers in Vietnam,
it's against the administration's policy
and the reasons we're there to begin
with." He continued on the subject of
U.S. foreign policy in general: "The
Vietnam war isn't the main issue
though. Our whole system of
controlling South America, Central
America, and Africa is the real issue.
Before we clean up other coutries I
hope we clean up the mess in our own.
I'm concerned about my people who
don't live as well as they ought to be
able to."
Anti- Violence
Another worker said, "I think the
war is bad too. But the property
damage that sometimes goes on isn't
going to get us out of there. I know
that we are destroying the land in
Vietnam but destroying property here
only gets people mad at the
demonstrators."
Another black laborer added, "If the
revolutionary movement becomes
stronger, then we'll get closer and
closer to a military state. Eventually
there may be a bloody mess. If we did
have a military state like Nazi
Germany, I don't know what the rest
of the people would do."
Another member of the carpenter's
union was afraid of bombings. "I
supported that national student strike
last year because it was mostly
non-violent. But I draw the line at
those senseless bombings. I know that
the bombers are just a few people and
probably not even students, but I really
get mad at that."
Black Panthers
When asked about the Black Panther
Party and other revolutionary groups
most of the workers were indifferent.
One worker said that the Panthers do
some good work and some bad work.
"Their programs of feeding people and
giving them clothes and medical care
have been needed for a long time. But
when they break windows of
department stores and restaurants
they're only hurting themselves."

A black laborer said that he
supported the 10 point platform of the
Black Panthers. "The Panthers do very
good things for people in ghettos."
Political Prisoners
Another question of concern to
people in this country today is that of
political prisoners. A Chicano laborer
commented, "I think if they are guilty
of a crime they should be locked up
and if they are innocent they will be
freed. I don't think there are any
political prisoners." Three or four other
workers agreed.
Another Chicano laborer, however,
felt that "Los Siete de la Raza" were
political prisoners. "I lived in the
mission district and I know what those
people have to go through. Besides,
how can they be common criminals
when they've practically been proven
innocent? Some people in prisons
today shouldn't be there."
Two workers working on Campus
Drive felt that political prisoners exist
but that they should be in jail.

should not be on the streets,"
commented one. The other added that
"As long as they don't hurt anyone
revolutionaries are OK - but then
they're not really revolutionaries. When
they bomb buildings and destroy
property they're no good."
However, they toned down their
harshness a bit when asked about Los
Siete. "If they're proven innocent then
it was wrong for them to spend so
much time in jail. I don't know if
they're innocent yet, though," said
one, and the other agreed.
At Escondido Village the black
laborer said, "Huey Newton, Bobby
Seale, Angela Davis, and Ericka Huggins
are all political prisoners in jail on
trumped-up charges. All of the Panthers

are being victimized. I hope things get
better soon but it doesn't look that
way. Things will probably get worse
and then I don't know what will
happen."
Such were the opinions of some
hard-hat workers on the Stanford
campus. Some were very heated about
the campus demonstrations, some
mildly opposed, and some in support of
non-violent demonstrating. All but
three workers were anti-Vietnam war.
They were not violent men and
certainly not against sutdents in
general. They were not closed to
discussion; indeed, they were much
more open than many students are.
Certainly these men did not represent
the attitudes of the hard-hat myth that
so much has been written about.

laborer said, "Huey Newton, Bobby
Seale, Angela Davis, and Ericka Huggins
are all political prisoners in jail on
trumped-up charges. All of the Panthers

are being victimized. I hope things get
better soon but it doesn't look that
way. Things will probably get worse
and then I don't know what will
happen."
Such were the opinions of some
hard-hat workers on the Stanford
campus. Some were very heated about
the campus demonstrations, some
mildly opposed, and some in support of
non-violent demonstrating. All but
three workers were anti-Vietnam war.
They were not violent men and
certainly not against sutdents in
general. They were not closed to
discussion; indeed, they were much
more open than many students are.
Certainly these men did not represent
the attitudes of the hard-hat myth that
so much has been written about.
Opinions and political persuasions
among construction workers at
Stanford appear to be as widely
divergent as those of students and
faculty on any contemporary college
campus.
Recent Daily interviews reveal little
support for the popular stereotype of
"pro-war, neo-fascist" hard-hats.
Hard-hats currently working at
Stanford are generally opposed to the
Vietnam war - in direct contrast to New
York workers.
The construction men at Escondido
Village and Campus Drive are a friendly
group, willing to discuss issues of major
concern. The majority have worked
hard all their lives and realize, in the
words of one worker, that "the only
way the working man gets ahead is to
fight the bosses when he has to."
"Worker solidarity" became
apparent during Daily interviews with
the hard-hat workers. "I heard that the
General Motors plant in Fremont
pushes the workers till they burst and
pays them almost nothing,"
commented a laborer whose cousin
works at GM. "It's hard for those men
to strike and not get any pay. I hope
they win their demands and real soon."
The foreman of the common
laborers crew agreed, adding "We have
a strong union. It got that way because
men died fighting for it. Working on an
assembly line is tiring, and those men
are making a lot of money for the
company. They deserve to get some of
it too. But they'll have to fight for it."
Opinions Diverge
Union organizing was one topic that
the interviewed workers basically
agreed upon. On national politics and
campus demonstrations, however, there
was a wide diversity of opinions.
"I fought in Korea and Vietnam
both. It made me sick to see people
demonstrating against me because I was
fighting a war," said one of the
members of the carpenters union.
A black laborer answered his

statement: "The demonstrating isn't
against you or the soldiers in Vietnam,
it's against the administration's policy
and the reasons we're there to begin
with." He continued on the subject of
U.S. foreign policy in general: "The
Vietnam war isn't the main issue
though. Our whole system of
controlling South America, Central
America, and Africa is the real issue.
Before we clean up other coutries I
hope we clean up the mess in our own.
I'm concerned about my people who
don't live as well as they ought to be
able to."
Anti- Violence
Another worker said, "I think the
war is bad too. But the property
damage that sometimes goes on isn't
going to get us out of there. I know
that we are destroying the land in
Vietnam but destroying property here
only gets people mad at the
demonstrators."
Another black laborer added, "If the
revolutionary movement becomes
stronger, then we'll get closer and
closer to a military state. Eventually
there may be a bloody mess. If we did
have a military state like Nazi
Germany, I don't know what the rest
of the people would do."
Another member of the carpenter's
union was afraid of bombings. "I
supported that national student strike
last year because it was mostly
non-violent. But I draw the line at
those senseless bombings. I know that
the bombers are just a few people and
probably not even students, but I really
get mad at that."
Black Panthers
When asked about the Black Panther
Party and other revolutionary groups
most of the workers were indifferent.
One worker said that the Panthers do
some good work and some bad work.
"Their programs of feeding people and
giving them clothes and medical care
have been needed for a long time. But
when they break windows of
department stores and restaurants
they're only hurting themselves."

A black laborer said that he
supported the 10 point platform of the
Black Panthers. "The Panthers do very
good things for people in ghettos."
Political Prisoners
Another question of concern to
people in this country today is that of
political prisoners. A Chicano laborer
commented, "I think if they are guilty
of a crime they should be locked up
and if they are innocent they will be
freed. I don't think there are any
political prisoners." Three or four other
workers agreed.
Another Chicano laborer, however,
felt that "Los Siete de la Raza" were
political prisoners. "I lived in the
mission district and I know what those
people have to go through. Besides,
how can they be common criminals
when they've practically been proven
innocent? Some people in prisons
today shouldn't be there."
Two workers working on Campus
Drive felt that political prisoners exist
but that they should be in jail.

"As long as they don't hurt anyone
revolutionaries are OK - but then
they're not really revolutionaries. When
they bomb buildings and destroy
property they're no good."
However, they toned down their
harshness a bit when asked about Los
Siete. "If they're proven innocent then
it was wrong for them to spend so

they're innocent yet, though," said
one, and the other agreed.

should not be on the streets,"
commented one. The other added that
"As long as they don't hurt anyone
revolutionaries are OK - but then
they're not really revolutionaries. When
they bomb buildings and destroy
property they're no good."
However, they toned down their
harshness a bit when asked about Los
Siete. "If they're proven innocent then
it was wrong for them to spend so
much time in jail. I don't know if
they're innocent yet, though," said
one, and the other agreed.
At Escondido Village the black
laborer said, "Huey Newton, Bobby
Seale, Angela Davis, and Ericka Huggins
are all political prisoners in jail on
trumped-up charges. All of the Panthers

are being victimized. I hope things get
better soon but it doesn't look that
way. Things will probably get worse
and then I don't know what will
happen."
Such were the opinions of some
hard-hat workers on the Stanford
campus. Some were very heated about
the campus demonstrations, some
mildly opposed, and some in support of
non-violent demonstrating. All but
three workers were anti-Vietnam war.
They were not violent men and
certainly not against sutdents in
general. They were not closed to
discussion; indeed, they were much
more open than many students are.
Certainly these men did not represent
the attitudes of the hard-hat myth that
so much has been written about.
Opinions and political persuasions
among construction workers at
Stanford appear to be as widely
divergent as those of students and
faculty on any contemporary college
campus.
Recent Daily interviews reveal little
support for the popular stereotype of
"pro-war, neo-fascist" hard-hats.
Hard-hats currently working at
Stanford are generally opposed to the
Vietnam war - in direct contrast to New
York workers.
The construction men at Escondido
Village and Campus Drive are a friendly
group, willing to discuss issues of major
concern. The majority have worked
hard all their lives and realize, in the
words of one worker, that "the only
way the working man gets ahead is to
fight the bosses when he has to."
"Worker solidarity" became
apparent during Daily interviews with
the hard-hat workers. "I heard that the
General Motors plant in Fremont
pushes the workers till they burst and
pays them almost nothing,"
commented a laborer whose cousin
works at GM. "It's hard for those men
to strike and not get any pay. I hope
they win their demands and real soon."
The foreman of the common
laborers crew agreed, adding "We have
a strong union. It got that way because
men died fighting for it. Working on an
assembly line is tiring, and those men
are making a lot of money for the
company. They deserve to get some of
it too. But they'll have to fight for it."
Opinions Diverge
Union organizing was one topic that
the interviewed workers basically
agreed upon. On national politics and
campus demonstrations, however, there
was a wide diversity of opinions.
"I fought in Korea and Vietnam
both. It made me sick to see people
demonstrating against me because I was
fighting a war," said one of the
members of the carpenters union.
A black laborer answered his

statement: "The demonstrating isn't
against you or the soldiers in Vietnam,
it's against the administration's policy
and the reasons we're there to begin
with." He continued on the subject of
U.S. foreign policy in general: "The
Vietnam war isn't the main issue
though. Our whole system of
controlling South America, Central
America, and Africa is the real issue.
Before we clean up other coutries I
hope we clean up the mess in our own.
I'm concerned about my people who
don't live as well as they ought to be
able to."
Anti- Violence
Another worker said, "I think the
war is bad too. But the property
damage that sometimes goes on isn't
going to get us out of there. I know
that we are destroying the land in
Vietnam but destroying property here
only gets people mad at the
demonstrators."
Another black laborer added, "If the
revolutionary movement becomes
stronger, then we'll get closer and
closer to a military state. Eventually
there may be a bloody mess. If we did
have a military state like Nazi
Germany, I don't know what the rest
of the people would do."
Another member of the carpenter's
union was afraid of bombings. "I
supported that national student strike
last year because it was mostly
non-violent. But I draw the line at
those senseless bombings. I know that
the bombers are just a few people and
probably not even students, but I really
get mad at that."
Black Panthers
When asked about the Black Panther
Party and other revolutionary groups
most of the workers were indifferent.
One worker said that the Panthers do
some good work and some bad work.
"Their programs of feeding people and
giving them clothes and medical care
have been needed for a long time. But
when they break windows of
department stores and restaurants
they're only hurting themselves."

A black laborer said that he
supported the 10 point platform of the
Black Panthers. "The Panthers do very
good things for people in ghettos."
Political Prisoners
Another question of concern to
people in this country today is that of
political prisoners. A Chicano laborer
commented, "I think if they are guilty
of a crime they should be locked up
and if they are innocent they will be
freed. I don't think there are any
political prisoners." Three or four other
workers agreed.
Another Chicano laborer, however,
felt that "Los Siete de la Raza" were
political prisoners. "I lived in the
mission district and I know what those
people have to go through. Besides,
how can they be common criminals
when they've practically been proven
innocent? Some people in prisons
today shouldn't be there."
Two workers working on Campus
Drive felt that political prisoners exist
but that they should be in jail.

commented, "I think if they are guilty
of a crime they should be locked up
and if they are innocent they will be
freed. I don't think there are any
political prisoners." Three or four other
workers agreed.
Another Chicano laborer, however,
felt that "Los Siete de la Raza" were
political prisoners. "I lived in the
mission district and I know what those
people have to go through. Besides,
how can they be common criminals
when they've practically been proven
innocent? Some people in prisons
today shouldn't be there."
Two workers working on Campus
Drive felt that political prisoners exist
but that they should be in jail.

UP, UP AND AWAY — A crane operator raises another load to the top of a new
campus building. Very few of the workers interviewed had pro-war feelings and
many supported non-violent forms of protest.

workers expressed strong anti-war sentiment, although in general, opinions were as varied as those of students.
should not be on the streets,"
commented one. The other added that
"As long as they don't hurt anyone
revolutionaries are OK - but then
they're not really revolutionaries. When
they bomb buildings and destroy
property they're no good."
However, they toned down their
harshness a bit when asked about Los
Siete. "If they're proven innocent then
it was wrong for them to spend so
much time in jail. I don't know if
they're innocent yet, though," said
one, and the other agreed.
At Escondido Village the black
laborer said, "Huey Newton, Bobby
Seale, Angela Davis, and Ericka Huggins
are all political prisoners in jail on
trumped-up charges. All of the Panthers

are being victimized. I hope things get
better soon but it doesn't look that
way. Things will probably get worse
and then I don't know what will
happen."
Such were the opinions of some
hard-hat workers on the Stanford
campus. Some were very heated about
the campus demonstrations, some
mildly opposed, and some in support of
non-violent demonstrating. All but
three workers were anti-Vietnam war.
They were not violent men and
certainly not against sutdents in
general. They were not closed to
discussion; indeed, they were much
more open than many students are.
Certainly these men did not represent
the attitudes of the hard-hat myth that
so much has been written about.
