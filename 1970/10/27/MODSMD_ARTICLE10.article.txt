# Loss Of Liquor License Dries Up Faculty Spirits
## 
### CHARLIE HORN RALPH KOSTANT 
Many students believe that the
Stanford Faculty Club is a place
where their mentors get together
during the evenings to get drunk,
have wild parties and engage in
other indiscretions.
In reality, few faculty members
meet at the Club at all. While
attendence at lunch tends to run
in the neighborhood of 350-the
noon meal is served on an
all-you-can-eat basis for $1.75
only about fifty people show up
for dinner. At all other hours, the
club atmosphere resembles that of
the tomb of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford.
As for getting drunk, the major
reason the Club is so lifeless is
that it has no liquor license. Not
all the faculty members who quit
the Club did so to avoid alcohol
withdrawal, but the prime social
attraction of the building behind
Tresidder expired with the old
liquor license.
Prior to the death of John
Barleycorn, an evening "happy
hour" allowed faculty to come
together for a drink and informal
conversation. The Club provided a
meeting place for men and women
who otherwise might rarely see
each other.
The informality associated
with the before-dinner cocktail

hour evaporated as quickly as
alcohol when the license was lost.
In past years the club has become,
in the words of one member, "a
very fancy cafeteria."
With the general disinterest in
the Club, financial solvency has
been preserved only through the
raising of meal prices and dues.
The consensus among faculty
who do not go to the Club is that
the scene there is somewhat dull,
that socializing without alcohol is
difficult, and that the club is
unduly formal. Members complain
that the meals do not have much
variety. The only people who do
seem to use the club in the
evening are the higher-ups in the
Administration and academic
departments. For them, the
atmosphere is relaxing and the
prices acceptable.
The Faculty Club, according to
Manager Forrest Tregey, is a
"separate private membership
organization." Its only official tie
with the University is that it is
located on University land.
Treger denied reports that
revenues from Tresidder help
subsidize the Club. He stated that
the Faculty Club is "completely
self-suffieient," meeting its
expenses through Club dues and
from meals.
But through the Faculty Club

may be sound financially, it is
spiritually a floundering
institution. Tregey expects the
Club to receive a new liquor
license soon. Others are not so
sure. What is apparent is that as
long as it is dry, Faculty members
will leave the Club nig!, and dry.
As Psychology Professor
Zimbardo observes soberly, "Why
does the faculty need a clubV
Essentially it should be a place
where faculty can go to meet
other faculty and to socialize.
This business with the liquor
license is ridiculous, since it takes
away the major social justification
for going there. Without that, and
without any sort of recreational
facilities, it simply becomes too
formal a place to relax. Besides,
most of the type of things which
would really help the place
without liquor are unprintable."
In short, the present conditions
of the Faculty Club are enough to
drive a man to drink, but not at
the Faculty Club.


STRANGE SCENES —such as this have entertained noontime
passerbys in White Plaza recently. Shown above are two members of
the East Bay Sharks, a meandering street theatre troupe.

with the before-dinner cocktail

hour evaporated as quickly as
alcohol when the license was lost.
In past years the club has become,
in the words of one member, "a
very fancy cafeteria."
With the general disinterest in
the Club, financial solvency has
been preserved only through the
raising of meal prices and dues.
The consensus among faculty
who do not go to the Club is that
the scene there is somewhat dull,
that socializing without alcohol is
difficult, and that the club is
unduly formal. Members complain
that the meals do not have much
variety. The only people who do
seem to use the club in the
evening are the higher-ups in the
Administration and academic
departments. For them, the
atmosphere is relaxing and the
prices acceptable.
The Faculty Club, according to
Manager Forrest Tregey, is a
"separate private membership
organization." Its only official tie
with the University is that it is
located on University land.
Treger denied reports that
revenues from Tresidder help
subsidize the Club. He stated that
the Faculty Club is "completely
self-suffieient," meeting its
expenses through Club dues and
from meals.
But through the Faculty Club

may be sound financially, it is
spiritually a floundering
institution. Tregey expects the
Club to receive a new liquor
license soon. Others are not so
sure. What is apparent is that as
long as it is dry, Faculty members
will leave the Club nig!, and dry.
As Psychology Professor
Zimbardo observes soberly, "Why
does the faculty need a clubV
Essentially it should be a place
where faculty can go to meet
other faculty and to socialize.
This business with the liquor
license is ridiculous, since it takes
away the major social justification
for going there. Without that, and
without any sort of recreational
facilities, it simply becomes too
formal a place to relax. Besides,
most of the type of things which
would really help the place
without liquor are unprintable."
In short, the present conditions
of the Faculty Club are enough to
drive a man to drink, but not at
the Faculty Club.


STRANGE SCENES —such as this have entertained noontime
passerbys in White Plaza recently. Shown above are two members of
the East Bay Sharks, a meandering street theatre troupe.
Many students believe that the
Stanford Faculty Club is a place
where their mentors get together
during the evenings to get drunk,
have wild parties and engage in
other indiscretions.
In reality, few faculty members
meet at the Club at all. While
attendence at lunch tends to run
in the neighborhood of 350-the
noon meal is served on an
all-you-can-eat basis for $1.75
only about fifty people show up
for dinner. At all other hours, the
club atmosphere resembles that of
the tomb of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford.
As for getting drunk, the major
reason the Club is so lifeless is
that it has no liquor license. Not
all the faculty members who quit
the Club did so to avoid alcohol
withdrawal, but the prime social
attraction of the building behind
Tresidder expired with the old
liquor license.
Prior to the death of John
Barleycorn, an evening "happy
hour" allowed faculty to come
together for a drink and informal
conversation. The Club provided a
meeting place for men and women
who otherwise might rarely see
each other.
