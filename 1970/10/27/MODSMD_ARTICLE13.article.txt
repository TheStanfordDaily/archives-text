# Bradley, Rutherford Debate Way To Better Environment

Environmental issues
dominated the debate Friday
between State Senator Clark
Bradley and John Rutherford, his
opponent in the race for the 14 th
district (which includes Stanford).
Both men advocate stronger
pollution controls.
Bradley called Proposition 18,
a plan to divert gas taxes for a
pollution study, impractical. The
money diverted would be "just a
drop in the bucket", and would
hamper highway construction.
Rutherford then asked if that was
Bradley's only objection. The
senator suggested he might change

his view if there were more
money.
The Southern Crossing, a
proposed bridge to be built about
4 miles south of the present
Oakland bridge, has aroused
controversy recently. Bradley
supports the bridge. He said,
"there is no scientific basis for
environmental damage" in its
construction.
Rutherford countered with
Governor Reagan's statement that
the Southern Crossing "sets our
feet in concrete for about thirty
years." The philosophy behind
such construction, according to
Rutherford based on a tripling of
the present Bay area population,

is devastating. "We must begin lo
phase the automobile out of
proposed regional transit
programs."
On the creation of a state
coastline agency to regulate
conservation and development,
Bradley stated that the
assumption is "that there are
twelve hundred miles in coastline
and beaches." However, about a
third of that figure is under
government control. Other parts
are held privately. Bradley prefers
state parks and beaches as being
of greatest benefit to the public,
and has always voted for new
acquisitions.
