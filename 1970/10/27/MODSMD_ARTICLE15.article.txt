Two Temples Bombed
ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Bomb explosions damaged two
Jewish temples on Rochester's east side early Tuesday, 15
days after a series of blasts hit several buildings in this city.
TTie blasts occurred minutes apart at the Light of Israel
Sephardic Center and Temple Beth Sholo. No injuries were
reported.
Rabbi Solomon Cohen of the Sephardic center said most
of the damage to his buildings was confined to one corner
and that the explosion blew a small hole in one wall.
Rabbi Cohen said it appeared the explosive had been
placed in a window casement of the center. He estimated
the damage at between $40,000 and $50,000. The
bombings occurred about six miles apart. The Sephardic
Center is in northeast Rochester and the other temple in
the southeast quadrant.
At Temple Beth Sholom, the damage apparently was
confined to the rear of an 8-year-old addition. The
sanctuary area was not reported damaged.
Egypt Accuses U.S.
NEW YORK — Egypt accused the United States on
Monday of joining Israel in a policy of "military aggression
and political deceit" that blocked peace in the Middle East.
Mahmoud Riad, the Egyptian foreign minister, made
the charges in opening a U.N. General Assembly debate on
the Arab-Israeli deadlock on peace negotiations.
Abba Eban, the Israeli foreign minister, said outside the
assembly that Riad delivered a "violent and dishonorable
tirade" to the 127-nation assembly. There was no
comment from the United States. Eban was expected to
present his case probably on Tuesday.
In Tel Aviv, Gen. Aharon Yariv, chief of Israeli's
military intelligence, told a news conference Egypt and the
Soviet Union had established one of the most advanced
missile systems in the world in the Suez Canal zone.
He estimated that 500 to 600 missiles had been
deployed in the zone, about half of them in launchers.
Ali Scores TKO
ATLANTA — Muhammed Ali, coming back from 3V6 years
of idleness and frustration, battered young Jerry Quarry
into a bloody mess Monday night and won a third round
knockout victory that sent him again in pursuit of the
heavy-weight championship he has never lost.
Referee Tony Perez stopped the bout after the third
round ended with blood gushing from an ugly gash over
Quarry's left eye.
Decision of the fight based on New York rules, was a
technical knockout at the end of the third round.
The announcer, Johnnie Addie, announced to a
screaming crowd of 5,000 in the ramshackle Atlanta

Municipal Auditorium that Perez found the injury too
severe for the fighter to continue.
It was a straight right hand that opened the wound near
the end of the third round, but it was only an act of mercy
that stopped the fight at the end.
Confident and appearing almost arrogant, Ali made a
mockery of the No. 1 heavy-weight challenger with left
jabs that struck out like an adder's tongue and a right that
almost made the ring rock when it landed.
"It was more than a win for a fighter- it was a social
victory," said Ali, who was stripped of his crown in 1967
when he refused to take the step for military service.
Frazier Possibly Insane
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. — The attorney defending the man
charged with the Ohta family mass murder said Monday his
bearded young client "changed radically" after a head
injury six months ago and that today "he does not know
right from wrong."
However, Asst. Public Defender James Jackson added at
a news conference that he does not intend to change John
Linley Frazier's current "not guilty " plea to insanity— at
least he said, "not at this time." Jackson said Frazier
denied the murders to him and said he did not know the
Ohta family. He added Frazier had used drugs.
Jackson said Frazier's actions "are not like those of a
normal person," adding, "He does not understand the gas
chamber. And he does not know right from wrong."
Jackson said Frazier "changed radically" after an auto
accident last May in which Frazier suffered a head injury.
He said it "correlates in time with the sudden
transformation of Frazier . . . which has been noted by a
number of his associates."
One person, described as a close friend, told a newsman
that Frazier was "a fairly straight family-oriented sort of a
guy" until about May, when he quit his job as an auto
mechanic and "turned almost overnight into another
wired-up hippie."
Deferment Policy Set
WASHINGTON — Draft Director Curtis W. Tarr
established a policy Monday permitting men to drop
certain deferments at will.
The policy means a man with a student, occupational
fatherhood or hardship deferment can abandon it
whenever it is to his advantage, without awaiting the end
of the condition under which it was granted.
He could, for example, choose to enter the 1A
manpower pool late in a year when it is apparent his draft
lottery number will not be reached.
Exposure for even part of the year counts for the entire
year and if a man ends the year in 1 A status without being
drafted, he is moved into less vulnerable categories in the
following years.

Egypt Accuses U.S.
NEW YORK — Egypt accused the United States on
Monday of joining Israel in a policy of "military aggression
and political deceit" that blocked peace in the Middle East.
Mahmoud Riad, the Egyptian foreign minister, made
the charges in opening a U.N. General Assembly debate on
the Arab-Israeli deadlock on peace negotiations.
Abba Eban, the Israeli foreign minister, said outside the
assembly that Riad delivered a "violent and dishonorable
tirade" to the 127-nation assembly. There was no
comment from the United States. Eban was expected to
present his case probably on Tuesday.
In Tel Aviv, Gen. Aharon Yariv, chief of Israeli's
military intelligence, told a news conference Egypt and the
Soviet Union had established one of the most advanced
missile systems in the world in the Suez Canal zone.
He estimated that 500 to 600 missiles had been
deployed in the zone, about half of them in launchers.
Ali Scores TKO
ATLANTA — Muhammed Ali, coming back from 3V6 years
of idleness and frustration, battered young Jerry Quarry
into a bloody mess Monday night and won a third round
knockout victory that sent him again in pursuit of the
heavy-weight championship he has never lost.
Referee Tony Perez stopped the bout after the third
round ended with blood gushing from an ugly gash over
Quarry's left eye.
Decision of the fight based on New York rules, was a
technical knockout at the end of the third round.
The announcer, Johnnie Addie, announced to a
screaming crowd of 5,000 in the ramshackle Atlanta

Municipal Auditorium that Perez found the injury too
severe for the fighter to continue.
It was a straight right hand that opened the wound near
the end of the third round, but it was only an act of mercy
that stopped the fight at the end.
Confident and appearing almost arrogant, Ali made a
mockery of the No. 1 heavy-weight challenger with left
jabs that struck out like an adder's tongue and a right that
almost made the ring rock when it landed.
"It was more than a win for a fighter- it was a social
victory," said Ali, who was stripped of his crown in 1967
when he refused to take the step for military service.
Frazier Possibly Insane
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. — The attorney defending the man
charged with the Ohta family mass murder said Monday his
bearded young client "changed radically" after a head
injury six months ago and that today "he does not know
right from wrong."
However, Asst. Public Defender James Jackson added at
a news conference that he does not intend to change John
Linley Frazier's current "not guilty " plea to insanity— at
least he said, "not at this time." Jackson said Frazier
denied the murders to him and said he did not know the
Ohta family. He added Frazier had used drugs.
Jackson said Frazier's actions "are not like those of a
normal person," adding, "He does not understand the gas
chamber. And he does not know right from wrong."
Jackson said Frazier "changed radically" after an auto
accident last May in which Frazier suffered a head injury.
He said it "correlates in time with the sudden
transformation of Frazier . . . which has been noted by a
number of his associates."
One person, described as a close friend, told a newsman
that Frazier was "a fairly straight family-oriented sort of a
guy" until about May, when he quit his job as an auto
mechanic and "turned almost overnight into another
wired-up hippie."
Deferment Policy Set
WASHINGTON — Draft Director Curtis W. Tarr
established a policy Monday permitting men to drop
certain deferments at will.
The policy means a man with a student, occupational
fatherhood or hardship deferment can abandon it
whenever it is to his advantage, without awaiting the end
of the condition under which it was granted.
He could, for example, choose to enter the 1A
manpower pool late in a year when it is apparent his draft
lottery number will not be reached.
Exposure for even part of the year counts for the entire
year and if a man ends the year in 1 A status without being
drafted, he is moved into less vulnerable categories in the
following years.

Two Temples Bombed
ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Bomb explosions damaged two
Jewish temples on Rochester's east side early Tuesday, 15
days after a series of blasts hit several buildings in this city.
TTie blasts occurred minutes apart at the Light of Israel
Sephardic Center and Temple Beth Sholo. No injuries were
reported.
Rabbi Solomon Cohen of the Sephardic center said most
of the damage to his buildings was confined to one corner
and that the explosion blew a small hole in one wall.
Rabbi Cohen said it appeared the explosive had been
placed in a window casement of the center. He estimated
the damage at between $40,000 and $50,000. The
bombings occurred about six miles apart. The Sephardic
Center is in northeast Rochester and the other temple in
the southeast quadrant.
At Temple Beth Sholom, the damage apparently was
confined to the rear of an 8-year-old addition. The
sanctuary area was not reported damaged.

ATLANTA — Muhammed Ali, coming back from 3V6 years
of idleness and frustration, battered young Jerry Quarry
into a bloody mess Monday night and won a third round
knockout victory that sent him again in pursuit of the
heavy-weight championship he has never lost.
Referee Tony Perez stopped the bout after the third
round ended with blood gushing from an ugly gash over
Quarry's left eye.
Decision of the fight based on New York rules, was a
technical knockout at the end of the third round.
The announcer, Johnnie Addie, announced to a
screaming crowd of 5,000 in the ramshackle Atlanta

Municipal Auditorium that Perez found the injury too
severe for the fighter to continue.
It was a straight right hand that opened the wound near
the end of the third round, but it was only an act of mercy
that stopped the fight at the end.
Confident and appearing almost arrogant, Ali made a
mockery of the No. 1 heavy-weight challenger with left
jabs that struck out like an adder's tongue and a right that
almost made the ring rock when it landed.
"It was more than a win for a fighter- it was a social
victory," said Ali, who was stripped of his crown in 1967
when he refused to take the step for military service.
Frazier Possibly Insane
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. — The attorney defending the man
charged with the Ohta family mass murder said Monday his
bearded young client "changed radically" after a head
injury six months ago and that today "he does not know
right from wrong."
However, Asst. Public Defender James Jackson added at
a news conference that he does not intend to change John
Linley Frazier's current "not guilty " plea to insanity— at
least he said, "not at this time." Jackson said Frazier
denied the murders to him and said he did not know the
Ohta family. He added Frazier had used drugs.
Jackson said Frazier's actions "are not like those of a
normal person," adding, "He does not understand the gas
chamber. And he does not know right from wrong."
Jackson said Frazier "changed radically" after an auto
accident last May in which Frazier suffered a head injury.
He said it "correlates in time with the sudden
transformation of Frazier . . . which has been noted by a
number of his associates."
One person, described as a close friend, told a newsman
that Frazier was "a fairly straight family-oriented sort of a
guy" until about May, when he quit his job as an auto
mechanic and "turned almost overnight into another
wired-up hippie."
Deferment Policy Set
WASHINGTON — Draft Director Curtis W. Tarr
established a policy Monday permitting men to drop
certain deferments at will.
The policy means a man with a student, occupational
fatherhood or hardship deferment can abandon it
whenever it is to his advantage, without awaiting the end
of the condition under which it was granted.
He could, for example, choose to enter the 1A
manpower pool late in a year when it is apparent his draft
lottery number will not be reached.
Exposure for even part of the year counts for the entire
year and if a man ends the year in 1 A status without being
drafted, he is moved into less vulnerable categories in the
following years.

Two Temples Bombed
ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Bomb explosions damaged two
Jewish temples on Rochester's east side early Tuesday, 15
days after a series of blasts hit several buildings in this city.
TTie blasts occurred minutes apart at the Light of Israel
Sephardic Center and Temple Beth Sholo. No injuries were
reported.
Rabbi Solomon Cohen of the Sephardic center said most
of the damage to his buildings was confined to one corner
and that the explosion blew a small hole in one wall.
Rabbi Cohen said it appeared the explosive had been
placed in a window casement of the center. He estimated
the damage at between $40,000 and $50,000. The
bombings occurred about six miles apart. The Sephardic
Center is in northeast Rochester and the other temple in
the southeast quadrant.
At Temple Beth Sholom, the damage apparently was
confined to the rear of an 8-year-old addition. The
sanctuary area was not reported damaged.
Egypt Accuses U.S.
NEW YORK — Egypt accused the United States on
Monday of joining Israel in a policy of "military aggression
and political deceit" that blocked peace in the Middle East.
Mahmoud Riad, the Egyptian foreign minister, made
the charges in opening a U.N. General Assembly debate on
the Arab-Israeli deadlock on peace negotiations.
Abba Eban, the Israeli foreign minister, said outside the
assembly that Riad delivered a "violent and dishonorable
tirade" to the 127-nation assembly. There was no
comment from the United States. Eban was expected to
present his case probably on Tuesday.
In Tel Aviv, Gen. Aharon Yariv, chief of Israeli's
military intelligence, told a news conference Egypt and the
Soviet Union had established one of the most advanced
missile systems in the world in the Suez Canal zone.
He estimated that 500 to 600 missiles had been
deployed in the zone, about half of them in launchers.
