# Arson Fire
## Irvine B Of A Destroyed 
### ED KOHN 
IRVINE, Oct. 26 - A fire,
apparently the work of an arsonist,
destroyed the Bank of America branch
office adjacent to the University of
California at Irvine early this morning.
It was the second Bank of America
branch to be burned-out in California
since February.
There were no injuries. Damage to
the building, which was completely
gutted, was estimated at $1 25 ,000.
Orange County Fire Marshall Jay
Trotter said the blaze broke out inside
the bank and was deliberately set. His
investigation was continuing.
"The fire started in the northeast
corner of the bank office, near two
doors," Trotter said. "Some type of
accelerant was used."
There was no indication of an
explosion at this morning's fire. I,ast
week, two greenhouses belonging to the
Stanford Research Institute near the
Irvine campus were bombed, causing
almost $6 0,000 in damages. A
university car was also successfully
firebombed.
Messages Left
Several messages, including "All
power to the people," "Death to the
pigs," and "Pigs out of Hillcrest" wue
painted on the outside walls of the
building.
The "Pigs out of Hillcrest" slogan

was an apparent reference to the site of
a rock concert that had been broken up
by police late Sunday. < After about
40 arrests were made, rock-and-bottle
throwing errupted. The Fullerton
Police Department's Tactical Squad was
called in to quell the disturbance, and
several persons reported that they were
severely beaten by the officers.
Hillcrest is about 25 miles north of
Irvine.
Second Total Loss
The Irvine fire was the second total
loss suffered by the Bank of America,
the largest bank in the world, in less
than a year. On Feb. 26, the Isla Vista
branch adjacent to the UC - Santa
Barbara campus was repeatedly
firebombed until it burned to the
ground. One student, Kevin Moran, was
killed in disturbances related to that
burning. Bank of America offices
frequently have been targets of
demonstrations in other cities
throughout the country.
Nine other businesses near the bank
suffered smoke damage. The branch is
located directly opposite the main gate
to the Irvine campus, 5 0 miles south of
Los Angeles.
No bank records or customer
accounts, which were being stored in
fire-proof vaults, were lost in the blaze.
'Die bank was providing shuttle service
for its customers to its nearest branch
office this morning.

Ken Jones, a publicist with the
bank's San Francisco corporate offices,
said that a temporary building would
be in place and operational within 48
hours. He estimated that $75,000 of
the $125 ,000 total damage was to
fixtures inside the building.
Many student groups on the Irvine
campus denounced the arson, including
the Associated Students, the Black
Student Union and MECHA. Radical
groups also condemned the move.
There had been no agitation against the
bank since a rally held last May.
The chancellor of the Irvine campus,
Daniel G. Aldrich Jr., later issued a
statement condemming the burning:
"... In no way does the responsible
campus community — or any part of it
— consider arson or any act of violence
or vandalism as a legitimate expression
of political dissent. Such actions are
criminal and must be treated as such."
John Bull, news editor of the
campus newspaper, the New University,
reported the campus was calm and
most students did not become aware of
the fire until mid-morning. He said
there were no plans to close the
university following the latest arson.
This afternoon, about 5 00 students
signed a petition condemning the
burning and offering to "help clean up
and rebuild the bank." A copy of their
petition was presented to a Bank of
America representative here.

Second Total Loss
The Irvine fire was the second total
loss suffered by the Bank of America,
the largest bank in the world, in less
than a year. On Feb. 26, the Isla Vista
branch adjacent to the UC - Santa
Barbara campus was repeatedly
firebombed until it burned to the
ground. One student, Kevin Moran, was
killed in disturbances related to that
burning. Bank of America offices
frequently have been targets of
demonstrations in other cities
throughout the country.
Nine other businesses near the bank
suffered smoke damage. The branch is
located directly opposite the main gate
to the Irvine campus, 5 0 miles south of
Los Angeles.
No bank records or customer
accounts, which were being stored in
fire-proof vaults, were lost in the blaze.
'Die bank was providing shuttle service
for its customers to its nearest branch
office this morning.

Ken Jones, a publicist with the
bank's San Francisco corporate offices,
said that a temporary building would
be in place and operational within 48
hours. He estimated that $75,000 of
the $125 ,000 total damage was to
fixtures inside the building.
Many student groups on the Irvine
campus denounced the arson, including
the Associated Students, the Black
Student Union and MECHA. Radical
groups also condemned the move.
There had been no agitation against the
bank since a rally held last May.
The chancellor of the Irvine campus,
Daniel G. Aldrich Jr., later issued a
statement condemming the burning:
"... In no way does the responsible
campus community — or any part of it
— consider arson or any act of violence
or vandalism as a legitimate expression
of political dissent. Such actions are
criminal and must be treated as such."
John Bull, news editor of the
campus newspaper, the New University,
reported the campus was calm and
most students did not become aware of
the fire until mid-morning. He said
there were no plans to close the
university following the latest arson.
This afternoon, about 5 00 students
signed a petition condemning the
burning and offering to "help clean up
and rebuild the bank." A copy of their
petition was presented to a Bank of
America representative here.
IRVINE, Oct. 26 - A fire,
apparently the work of an arsonist,
destroyed the Bank of America branch
office adjacent to the University of
California at Irvine early this morning.
It was the second Bank of America
branch to be burned-out in California
since February.
There were no injuries. Damage to
the building, which was completely
gutted, was estimated at $1 25 ,000.
Orange County Fire Marshall Jay
Trotter said the blaze broke out inside
the bank and was deliberately set. His
investigation was continuing.
"The fire started in the northeast
corner of the bank office, near two
doors," Trotter said. "Some type of
accelerant was used."
There was no indication of an
explosion at this morning's fire. I,ast
week, two greenhouses belonging to the
Stanford Research Institute near the
Irvine campus were bombed, causing
almost $6 0,000 in damages. A
university car was also successfully
firebombed.
