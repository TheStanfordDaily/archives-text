# Election Politics Yields To Apathy
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
In Spring 1970, the University
acceded to student demands and
adopted the "Princeton Plan", giving
students a four-day election weekend
to permit large-scale participation in
political campaigning.
The situation appeared tailor-made
for the Movement for a New Congress
(MNC), the Princeton-founded
peace-candidate campaign organization.
For a while, it was; MNC organizers
signed up over 600 Stanford volunteers
in a few weeks.
But with elections only a week
away, Movement recruiters have
encountered a surprising amount of
apathy among students here. Arthur
Bushkin, MNC regional coordinator,
says of the election resees: "the
indications are that it's not going to be
taken advantage of".
Nevertheless, MNC is stepping up
the pace of its activities in an effort to
involve as many students as possible in
the political process. Today, 7000
circulars are being distributed to let the
uninvolved know where and when the
campaigning is going on. And over 45 0
of the involved—those who signed up
last Spring, and stayed committed
through the Summer — are hard at
work for the peace candidate of their
choice.
Reordering Priorities
The Movement for a New Congress
grew out of the conviction of many
students that the withdrawal of U.S.
military forces from Southeast Asia and
the complete reordering of national
priorities will only come about with the
election of a new, "peace-oriented"
Congress. "Our primary function," says
Stanford MNC chapter leader Howard
Hoffman, "is to channel all the energies
of the people who want to work for
peace-oriented candidates."
The Stanford chapter is supporting
the campaigns of John Tunney (D.,
U.S. Senate), Stuart McLean (D.,

Congress), Paul McCloskey (R.,
Congress), Wilson Riles (StateSupt. of
Public Instruction), Arlen Gregorio (D.,
State Senate), and John Rutherford(D.,
State Senate), "not necessarily in that
order", according to Hoffman. The
emphasis is decidedly on the Tunney
campaign — a "crucial" race, according
to Bushkin, and the contest with the
greatest chance of MNC victory.
Although candidate support is up to
the local chapter, the MNC regional
office in Palo Alto handles much of the
planning and coordination, and all of
the fund-raising, for the 34 Northern
California chapters. MNC is funded
entirely by volunteer contributions,
many of which are from the
Universities National Anti-War Fund, a
member (along with MNC) of the
nationwide "Coalition for a Responsible
Congress".

MNC's national headquarters is at
Princeton University, where the
computerized processing of Spring's
volunteers was performed.
MNC's activities for this week will
include canvassing, preparation of
"get-out-the-vote kits", and the massive
effort planned for election day. Prime
target area is heavily Democratic,
"peace-oriented" East Palo Alto.
MNC can be reached for more
information at 329-9160. "We can use
as many people as turn out", says
Bushkin.
Harsh Words
For those who reject the idea of
working within "the system", Bushkin
had harsh words yesterday. "To me,"
he said, "that's a form of elitism. The
guys fighting in Nam, the people in the
slums starving to death — they don't
have the luxury of intellectual debate."

But one student, who will be
working for Tunney, McLean, and Riles
this week, voiced skepticism over
MNC's approach: "It's easy to claim
that by canvassing and feeling great
emotional concern over political issues
and campaigns, that somehow we're
doing something to affect the political
system . . . when we aren't
accomplishing anything."
Another student voiced his
uncertainty, and expressed a feeling
that may be common to all students
involved in MNC: "My emotions about
politics are very mixed . . . But if you
don't believe in violence, if you aren't
looking toward revoltuion, if you call
yourself a liberal, you should be trying
to do something — which means
working in the political system,
realizing that you may not have any
impact ... almost to clear your own
conscience as much as anything else."

office in Palo Alto handles much of the
planning and coordination, and all of
the fund-raising, for the 34 Northern
California chapters. MNC is funded
entirely by volunteer contributions,
many of which are from the
Universities National Anti-War Fund, a
member (along with MNC) of the
nationwide "Coalition for a Responsible
Congress".

MNC's national headquarters is at
Princeton University, where the
computerized processing of Spring's
volunteers was performed.
MNC's activities for this week will
include canvassing, preparation of
"get-out-the-vote kits", and the massive
effort planned for election day. Prime
target area is heavily Democratic,
"peace-oriented" East Palo Alto.

Bushkin.
Harsh Words
For those who reject the idea of
working within "the system", Bushkin
had harsh words yesterday. "To me,"
he said, "that's a form of elitism. The
guys fighting in Nam, the people in the
slums starving to death — they don't
have the luxury of intellectual debate."

But one student, who will be
working for Tunney, McLean, and Riles
this week, voiced skepticism over
MNC's approach: "It's easy to claim
that by canvassing and feeling great
emotional concern over political issues
and campaigns, that somehow we're
doing something to affect the political
system . . . when we aren't
accomplishing anything."
Another student voiced his
uncertainty, and expressed a feeling
that may be common to all students
involved in MNC: "My emotions about
politics are very mixed . . . But if you
don't believe in violence, if you aren't
looking toward revoltuion, if you call
yourself a liberal, you should be trying
to do something — which means
working in the political system,
realizing that you may not have any
impact ... almost to clear your own
conscience as much as anything else."
In Spring 1970, the University
acceded to student demands and
adopted the "Princeton Plan", giving
students a four-day election weekend
to permit large-scale participation in
political campaigning.
The situation appeared tailor-made
for the Movement for a New Congress
(MNC), the Princeton-founded
peace-candidate campaign organization.
For a while, it was; MNC organizers
signed up over 600 Stanford volunteers
in a few weeks.
But with elections only a week
away, Movement recruiters have
encountered a surprising amount of
apathy among students here. Arthur
Bushkin, MNC regional coordinator,
says of the election resees: "the
indications are that it's not going to be
taken advantage of".
Nevertheless, MNC is stepping up
the pace of its activities in an effort to
involve as many students as possible in
the political process. Today, 7000
circulars are being distributed to let the
uninvolved know where and when the
campaigning is going on. And over 45 0
of the involved—those who signed up
last Spring, and stayed committed
through the Summer — are hard at
work for the peace candidate of their
choice.
Reordering Priorities
The Movement for a New Congress
grew out of the conviction of many
students that the withdrawal of U.S.
military forces from Southeast Asia and
the complete reordering of national
priorities will only come about with the
election of a new, "peace-oriented"
Congress. "Our primary function," says
Stanford MNC chapter leader Howard
Hoffman, "is to channel all the energies
of the people who want to work for
peace-oriented candidates."
The Stanford chapter is supporting
the campaigns of John Tunney (D.,
U.S. Senate), Stuart McLean (D.,

Congress), Paul McCloskey (R.,
Congress), Wilson Riles (StateSupt. of
Public Instruction), Arlen Gregorio (D.,
State Senate), and John Rutherford(D.,
State Senate), "not necessarily in that
order", according to Hoffman. The
emphasis is decidedly on the Tunney
campaign — a "crucial" race, according
to Bushkin, and the contest with the
greatest chance of MNC victory.
Although candidate support is up to
the local chapter, the MNC regional
office in Palo Alto handles much of the
planning and coordination, and all of
the fund-raising, for the 34 Northern
