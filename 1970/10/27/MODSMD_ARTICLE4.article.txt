# Mid-Peninsula Development Produces Housing Shortage
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The shortage of low and moderate
income housing in the mid-peninsula is
only one facet of land development
policies which go back at least twenty
years. The responsibility for the
problem lies not only with
discriminatory local and federal
housing policies, but to a significant
degree with Stanford, which exerted
considerable leadership in the
development of the entire area.
"There is no question that the
Stanford Shopping Center and
Industrial Park have made Palo Alto
what it is today," says Charles Walker,
a member of the city manager's office.
The Promised Land, a booklet
published last year by the Grass Roots
organization and which is, according to
regional planner Larry Livingston, "by
far the best study yet made of
mid -pen i nsu 1 a land develop
ment .. . muckraking in the tradition
of Upton Sinclare," explains how
Stanford was involved.
Planning Controlled
According to The Promised Land,
"The severe shortage of low-income
housing in the Mid-Peninsula
especially in and near the Palo
Alto-Stanford community is no
accident. . . When Stanford decided in
1951 to build the new electronics
industry and its own engineering school
by leasing part of its land for the
Industrial Park, the population of Palo
Alto expanded as new employees built
homes.
"A comfortable alliance of the
wealthy residents of hill towns, the
trustees of Stanford and the vigilant
City Council of Palo Alto controlled a
huge portion of land through
ownership of the power of zoning. The
resulting high prices of land and the
low-density zoning created a wealthy
class enclave stretching from the
foothills through central Palo Alto.
"The very wealthy could afford
Atherton or Woodside, the middle
income faculty and Industrial Park
employees got Stanford land for
housing or a pleasant place in the hills
or central Palo Alto, and the rest were
squeezed north or south or to the east
of Bayshore Freeway. High prices, and
occasionally blatant discrimination and
outright eviction of the poor, enforced
the das separation."
Government Blame
Livingston, who is presently
preparing a land us<> study for the

university, places blame for the
problem also on the Federal Housing
Authority. "The FHA," he says,
"began after World War II to control
housing construction by its use of
guaranteed loans.
"It decided that all housing should
be suburban, middle-income, single
family detached type units. It didn't
build any housing for the elderly or the
poor. Of this vast program of subsidies,
the people who needed the most got
nothing.
"Worst of all the FHA supported a
policy of positive racial segregation.
They would not insure loans unless the
developer would guarantee that no
minority be admitted. This policy
wasn't changed until 1962."
Suburban Sprawl
The mid-peninsula was rapidly
growing during this period of FHA
housing development and contains
much evidence of the sprawl which
usually resulted from such policies. The
situation here, however, became worse
than most places. Suburban areas are
usually predominantly residential with
some industry, but in the mid-peninsula
and especially in Palo Alto there
developed a great concentration of
employment.
Because the area became
industrialized, but contained mostly
middle and upper income housing, the
situation has developed where Palo
Alto has only one-third as much
housing as jobs.
According to the Moulton
Committee's housing report, "The

University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing
both because of the housing needs of
its students, faculty and staff, and
because its land development
programs .. . have significantly
increased demand for local housing."
University At Fault
The report estimated the unsatisfied
demand for low-income units alone in
the Palo Alto Stanford area at about
4,000 and judged that about 70 percent
of this shortage was directly
attributable to university operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
Boyd Smith, Stanford's manager of
real estate, disagrees with those who
would blame university policies for the
problem. "It is my personal feeling that
even if there had never been any
university development in the region
from San Francisco to San Jose,
employment and housing would have
been what they are today and you
would have had the same housing
pinch."
"It's a regional problem," he says,
"and in the aggregate I don't think that
Stanford developments have created
the low and moderate income housing
crisis in this area."
Continued Expansion
Throughout the 1960's Stanford has
continued to devleop its lands,
including expansion in the Industrial
Park and the agreement to lease land
for the Dillingham development at the
corner of Page Mill and El Camino.
