# 'disaster management'
## A 						Lockheed Hardware Catalogue 
### 
A silent, flying Viet-Cong
sniffer, a 60 mile-an-hour
tank-of-the-future, and training in
"disaster management" of drugs
for junior high school students are
some of the more interesting
programs currently underway at
the Lockheed Missies and Space
Company (LMSC) in Sunnyvale.
Engineering students will be
talking with Lockheed recruiters
at the Placement Center
tomorrow. This information is
intended to help them, as well as
other members of the Stanford
community, decide about
Lockheed.
The YO-3A is an airplane
specifically designed for "quiet,
night aerial surveillance over the
battlefields of Southeast Asia."
The project originated in the
Southeast Asian Affairs
Directorate of DoD's Advanced

Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
in 1966. LMSC produced two
prototypes which were sent to
South Vietnam and which
"operated highly successfully
during the 1 968 Tet offensive."
The contract called for an
aircraft that could fly undetected
over enemy positions at night.
Lockheed's counterinsurgency
specialists met the "challenge" by
combining an unpowered sailplane
with a slowly-turning engine and a
six-bladed wooden propellor.
Equipped with special advanced
sensors for detecting people at
night, the YO-3A can fly silently
and undetected at treetop level.
According to Lt. General Austin
W. Betts, Chief of Army R&D,
"What we are looking for is
individual Viet Cong on the
ground."
LMSC received over $ 18

million for production of 11
aircraft, which were built at a
leased facility in Menlo Park. Last
month they were sent over to
Vietnam after testing at Eort Ord.
A new toy which is expected
to serve in Southeast Asia is the
Twister, a new type of tank that
can charge through sand, mud,
and rice paddies at twice the
speed of existing combat vehicles.
Twister was developed after
five years of computer-simulated
war games, using scenarios in
three different types of combat
environments--Europe, Korea,
and the Middle East. Of particular
interest was the ability to
negotiate the dense undergrowth,
rice paddies, and unpaved roads
characteristic of the Vietnamese
terrain. The Army was interested
enough to reward LMSC's
ingenuity with a $3 million

contract in January of 19 68 for
the delivery of three Twister
prototypes.
But Lockheed is involved in
more than just counterinsurgency
and war toys. As part of a "major
diversification move" LMSC
established an information
systems organization which last
year introduced its Drug Decision
program.
Already in use by about 4 0
school districts around the
country, the program is designed
to create in junior high school
students "an awareness of the real
problems connected with drug
abuse" through the use of a color
movie, a "programmed text," and
a role-playing game which
"requires the student to function
as an active decision maker. He
must make decisions to protect
his community from a simulated
drug attack, and he must decide
on the approach to treatment and
rehabilitation of drug users."
Lockheed seems too impatient
to wait until college to start
training its military-industrial
technocrats: "The student's
involvement in the learning
process is enhanced by the use of
gaming, simulation, and role
playing. Widely used in training
industry managers and military
commanders, these techniques
build learning through active
decision making."
The program consists of five
parts:
"In Phase I the student views
motion pictures of natural and
man-made disasters and learns
that some characteristics are
common to both kinds of disaster.
He is introduced to the concept
that communities must anticipate
and detect disasters and that the
effects of disasters can be
controlled by application of
suitable disaster management
techniques. Finally, he sees the
escalating infiltration of illegal
drugs into the community as a
new kind of disaster as potentially
dangerous as a hurricane or an
epidemic. Later, he will have to
defend his 'community' against a
simulated drug attack."
"In Phase II the student begins
to equip himself as an effective
drug-disaster manager as he
assimilates data on the effects of
drugs on the human body."
"In Phase 111 the student is
specifically concerned with legal
aspects of drug abuse. He sees the
defenses that society has erected
through legislation to protect
itself."
"In Phase IV the student is

'bob barkan

given an opportunity to practice
and demonstrate what he has
learned about the medical and
legal aspects of drugs. This phase
consists of the Drug Attack Game
(a board game similar to
Monopoly), where student players
assume the role of a law
enforcement agent, health officer,
or mayor. In the assumed role the
student is confronted with a
simulated drug attack, and he is
called upon to apply the
knowledge he has gained in Phases
I, 11, and 111 to stop the attack
and treat its victims."
"In Phase V the student
participates in role-playing,
wherein he and other students in
the class act out the story of a
drug-dependent person who has
been committed to a
rehabilitation center for
treatment. One of the major roles
that each student plays during this
four-day phase is that of a
member of a board responsible for
release of drug abusers who have
been committed to the
rehabilitation facility for
treatment. In this role the student
must decide . . . whether or not an
individual should be released from
the rehabilitation facility or
retained for further treatment. In
reaching his own decision, the
student recognizes that he must
consider the welfare of the
individual as well as the
requirements of society."
One is tenfpted to wish that
Lockheed had not tried to
diversify out of defense work. But
"from at i*wst one educator's
point of view, the movement of
an aerospace firm into the
educational field is a welcome
event. Edward Bispo, a consultant
in program development for the
California Office of
Compensatory Education, put it
like this:
'They have a very efficient
systematic and innovative
approach to problems. They have
introduced new areas to
education, such as gaming and
simulation. They have brought to
education a level of sophistication
that the business world has.'
Engineering students interested
in talking to Lockheed
representatives about working on
counterinsurgency airplanes,
supertanks, and drug propoganda
should come to the Placement
Center tomorrow at 12 :45. Other
Stanford students are also
cordially invited to attend and
engage in stimulating discussion.

A silent, flying Viet-Cong
sniffer, a 60 mile-an-hour
tank-of-the-future, and training in
"disaster management" of drugs
for junior high school students are
some of the more interesting
programs currently underway at
the Lockheed Missies and Space
Company (LMSC) in Sunnyvale.
Engineering students will be
talking with Lockheed recruiters
at the Placement Center
tomorrow. This information is
intended to help them, as well as
other members of the Stanford
community, decide about
Lockheed.
The YO-3A is an airplane
specifically designed for "quiet,
night aerial surveillance over the
battlefields of Southeast Asia."
The project originated in the
Southeast Asian Affairs
Directorate of DoD's Advanced

Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
in 1966. LMSC produced two
prototypes which were sent to
South Vietnam and which
"operated highly successfully
during the 1 968 Tet offensive."
The contract called for an
aircraft that could fly undetected
over enemy positions at night.
Lockheed's counterinsurgency
specialists met the "challenge" by
combining an unpowered sailplane
with a slowly-turning engine and a
six-bladed wooden propellor.
Equipped with special advanced
sensors for detecting people at
night, the YO-3A can fly silently
and undetected at treetop level.
According to Lt. General Austin
W. Betts, Chief of Army R&D,
"What we are looking for is
individual Viet Cong on the
ground."
LMSC received over $ 18

million for production of 11
aircraft, which were built at a
leased facility in Menlo Park. Last
month they were sent over to
Vietnam after testing at Eort Ord.
A new toy which is expected
to serve in Southeast Asia is the
Twister, a new type of tank that
can charge through sand, mud,
and rice paddies at twice the
speed of existing combat vehicles.
Twister was developed after
five years of computer-simulated
war games, using scenarios in
three different types of combat
environments--Europe, Korea,
and the Middle East. Of particular
interest was the ability to
negotiate the dense undergrowth,
rice paddies, and unpaved roads
characteristic of the Vietnamese
terrain. The Army was interested
enough to reward LMSC's
ingenuity with a $3 million

contract in January of 19 68 for
the delivery of three Twister
prototypes.
But Lockheed is involved in
more than just counterinsurgency
and war toys. As part of a "major
diversification move" LMSC
established an information
systems organization which last
year introduced its Drug Decision
program.
Already in use by about 4 0
school districts around the
country, the program is designed
to create in junior high school
students "an awareness of the real
problems connected with drug
abuse" through the use of a color
movie, a "programmed text," and
a role-playing game which
"requires the student to function
as an active decision maker. He
must make decisions to protect
his community from a simulated
drug attack, and he must decide
on the approach to treatment and
rehabilitation of drug users."
Lockheed seems too impatient
to wait until college to start
training its military-industrial
technocrats: "The student's
involvement in the learning
process is enhanced by the use of
gaming, simulation, and role
playing. Widely used in training
industry managers and military
commanders, these techniques
build learning through active
decision making."
The program consists of five
parts:
"In Phase I the student views
motion pictures of natural and
man-made disasters and learns
that some characteristics are
common to both kinds of disaster.
He is introduced to the concept
that communities must anticipate
and detect disasters and that the
effects of disasters can be
controlled by application of
suitable disaster management
techniques. Finally, he sees the
escalating infiltration of illegal
drugs into the community as a
new kind of disaster as potentially
dangerous as a hurricane or an
epidemic. Later, he will have to
defend his 'community' against a
simulated drug attack."
"In Phase II the student begins
to equip himself as an effective
drug-disaster manager as he
assimilates data on the effects of
drugs on the human body."
"In Phase 111 the student is
specifically concerned with legal
aspects of drug abuse. He sees the
defenses that society has erected
through legislation to protect
itself."
"In Phase IV the student is

'bob barkan

given an opportunity to practice
and demonstrate what he has
learned about the medical and
legal aspects of drugs. This phase
consists of the Drug Attack Game
(a board game similar to
Monopoly), where student players
assume the role of a law
enforcement agent, health officer,
or mayor. In the assumed role the
student is confronted with a
simulated drug attack, and he is
called upon to apply the
knowledge he has gained in Phases
I, 11, and 111 to stop the attack
and treat its victims."
"In Phase V the student
participates in role-playing,
wherein he and other students in
the class act out the story of a
drug-dependent person who has
been committed to a
rehabilitation center for
treatment. One of the major roles

The program consists of five
parts:
"In Phase I the student views
motion pictures of natural and
man-made disasters and learns
that some characteristics are
common to both kinds of disaster.
He is introduced to the concept
that communities must anticipate
and detect disasters and that the
effects of disasters can be
controlled by application of
suitable disaster management
techniques. Finally, he sees the
escalating infiltration of illegal
drugs into the community as a
new kind of disaster as potentially
dangerous as a hurricane or an
epidemic. Later, he will have to
defend his 'community' against a
simulated drug attack."
"In Phase II the student begins
to equip himself as an effective
drug-disaster manager as he
assimilates data on the effects of
drugs on the human body."
"In Phase 111 the student is
specifically concerned with legal
aspects of drug abuse. He sees the
defenses that society has erected
through legislation to protect
itself."
"In Phase IV the student is

'bob barkan

given an opportunity to practice
and demonstrate what he has
learned about the medical and
legal aspects of drugs. This phase
consists of the Drug Attack Game
(a board game similar to
Monopoly), where student players
assume the role of a law
enforcement agent, health officer,
or mayor. In the assumed role the
student is confronted with a
simulated drug attack, and he is
called upon to apply the
knowledge he has gained in Phases
I, 11, and 111 to stop the attack
and treat its victims."
"In Phase V the student
participates in role-playing,
wherein he and other students in
the class act out the story of a
drug-dependent person who has
been committed to a
rehabilitation center for
treatment. One of the major roles
that each student plays during this
four-day phase is that of a
member of a board responsible for
release of drug abusers who have
been committed to the
rehabilitation facility for
treatment. In this role the student
must decide . . . whether or not an
individual should be released from
the rehabilitation facility or
retained for further treatment. In
reaching his own decision, the
student recognizes that he must
consider the welfare of the
individual as well as the
requirements of society."
One is tenfpted to wish that
Lockheed had not tried to
diversify out of defense work. But
"from at i*wst one educator's
point of view, the movement of
an aerospace firm into the
educational field is a welcome
event. Edward Bispo, a consultant
in program development for the
California Office of
Compensatory Education, put it
like this:
'They have a very efficient
systematic and innovative
approach to problems. They have
introduced new areas to
education, such as gaming and
simulation. They have brought to
education a level of sophistication
that the business world has.'
Engineering students interested

representatives about working on
counterinsurgency airplanes,

should come to the Placement
Center tomorrow at 12 :45. Other
Stanford students are also

A silent, flying Viet-Cong
sniffer, a 60 mile-an-hour
tank-of-the-future, and training in
"disaster management" of drugs
for junior high school students are
some of the more interesting
programs currently underway at
the Lockheed Missies and Space
Company (LMSC) in Sunnyvale.
Engineering students will be
talking with Lockheed recruiters
at the Placement Center
tomorrow. This information is
intended to help them, as well as
other members of the Stanford
community, decide about
Lockheed.
The YO-3A is an airplane
specifically designed for "quiet,
night aerial surveillance over the
battlefields of Southeast Asia."
The project originated in the
Southeast Asian Affairs
Directorate of DoD's Advanced

Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
in 1966. LMSC produced two
prototypes which were sent to
South Vietnam and which
"operated highly successfully
during the 1 968 Tet offensive."
The contract called for an
aircraft that could fly undetected
over enemy positions at night.
Lockheed's counterinsurgency
specialists met the "challenge" by
combining an unpowered sailplane
with a slowly-turning engine and a
six-bladed wooden propellor.
Equipped with special advanced
sensors for detecting people at
night, the YO-3A can fly silently
and undetected at treetop level.
According to Lt. General Austin
W. Betts, Chief of Army R&D,
"What we are looking for is
individual Viet Cong on the
ground."
LMSC received over $ 18

million for production of 11
aircraft, which were built at a
leased facility in Menlo Park. Last
month they were sent over to
Vietnam after testing at Eort Ord.
A new toy which is expected
to serve in Southeast Asia is the
Twister, a new type of tank that
can charge through sand, mud,
and rice paddies at twice the
speed of existing combat vehicles.
Twister was developed after
five years of computer-simulated
war games, using scenarios in
three different types of combat
environments--Europe, Korea,
and the Middle East. Of particular
interest was the ability to
negotiate the dense undergrowth,
rice paddies, and unpaved roads
characteristic of the Vietnamese
terrain. The Army was interested
enough to reward LMSC's
ingenuity with a $3 million

contract in January of 19 68 for
the delivery of three Twister
prototypes.
But Lockheed is involved in
more than just counterinsurgency
and war toys. As part of a "major
diversification move" LMSC
established an information
systems organization which last
year introduced its Drug Decision
program.
Already in use by about 4 0
school districts around the
country, the program is designed
to create in junior high school
students "an awareness of the real
problems connected with drug
abuse" through the use of a color
movie, a "programmed text," and
a role-playing game which
"requires the student to function
as an active decision maker. He
must make decisions to protect
his community from a simulated
drug attack, and he must decide
on the approach to treatment and
rehabilitation of drug users."
Lockheed seems too impatient
to wait until college to start
training its military-industrial
technocrats: "The student's
involvement in the learning
process is enhanced by the use of
gaming, simulation, and role
playing. Widely used in training
industry managers and military
commanders, these techniques
build learning through active
decision making."

Twister was developed after
five years of computer-simulated
war games, using scenarios in
three different types of combat
environments--Europe, Korea,
and the Middle East. Of particular
interest was the ability to
negotiate the dense undergrowth,
rice paddies, and unpaved roads
characteristic of the Vietnamese
terrain. The Army was interested
enough to reward LMSC's
ingenuity with a $3 million

contract in January of 19 68 for
the delivery of three Twister
prototypes.
But Lockheed is involved in
more than just counterinsurgency
and war toys. As part of a "major
diversification move" LMSC
established an information
systems organization which last
year introduced its Drug Decision
program.
Already in use by about 4 0
school districts around the
country, the program is designed
to create in junior high school
students "an awareness of the real
problems connected with drug
abuse" through the use of a color
movie, a "programmed text," and
a role-playing game which
"requires the student to function
as an active decision maker. He
must make decisions to protect
his community from a simulated
drug attack, and he must decide
on the approach to treatment and
rehabilitation of drug users."
Lockheed seems too impatient
to wait until college to start
training its military-industrial
technocrats: "The student's
involvement in the learning
process is enhanced by the use of
gaming, simulation, and role
playing. Widely used in training
industry managers and military
commanders, these techniques
build learning through active
decision making."
The program consists of five
parts:
"In Phase I the student views
motion pictures of natural and
man-made disasters and learns
that some characteristics are
common to both kinds of disaster.
He is introduced to the concept
that communities must anticipate
and detect disasters and that the
effects of disasters can be
controlled by application of
suitable disaster management
techniques. Finally, he sees the
escalating infiltration of illegal
drugs into the community as a
new kind of disaster as potentially
dangerous as a hurricane or an
epidemic. Later, he will have to
defend his 'community' against a
simulated drug attack."
"In Phase II the student begins
to equip himself as an effective
drug-disaster manager as he
assimilates data on the effects of
drugs on the human body."
"In Phase 111 the student is
specifically concerned with legal
aspects of drug abuse. He sees the
defenses that society has erected
through legislation to protect
itself."
"In Phase IV the student is

'bob barkan

given an opportunity to practice
and demonstrate what he has
learned about the medical and
legal aspects of drugs. This phase
consists of the Drug Attack Game
(a board game similar to
Monopoly), where student players
assume the role of a law
enforcement agent, health officer,
or mayor. In the assumed role the
student is confronted with a
simulated drug attack, and he is
called upon to apply the
knowledge he has gained in Phases
I, 11, and 111 to stop the attack
and treat its victims."
"In Phase V the student
participates in role-playing,
wherein he and other students in
the class act out the story of a
drug-dependent person who has
been committed to a
rehabilitation center for
treatment. One of the major roles
that each student plays during this
four-day phase is that of a
member of a board responsible for
release of drug abusers who have
been committed to the
rehabilitation facility for
treatment. In this role the student
must decide . . . whether or not an
individual should be released from
the rehabilitation facility or
retained for further treatment. In
reaching his own decision, the
student recognizes that he must
consider the welfare of the
individual as well as the
requirements of society."
One is tenfpted to wish that
Lockheed had not tried to
diversify out of defense work. But
"from at i*wst one educator's
point of view, the movement of
an aerospace firm into the
educational field is a welcome
event. Edward Bispo, a consultant
in program development for the
California Office of
Compensatory Education, put it
like this:
'They have a very efficient
systematic and innovative
approach to problems. They have
introduced new areas to
education, such as gaming and
simulation. They have brought to
education a level of sophistication
that the business world has.'
Engineering students interested
in talking to Lockheed
representatives about working on
counterinsurgency airplanes,
supertanks, and drug propoganda
should come to the Placement
Center tomorrow at 12 :45. Other
Stanford students are also
cordially invited to attend and
engage in stimulating discussion.
