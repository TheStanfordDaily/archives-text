In response to student requests last spring for a Princeton type two
week recess, the Academic Senate approved a two day recess for
November 2 and 3 to permit students to participate in electoral
campaign*, fejther here or at their home, .In order to help you select the
candidates you would like to wprt for, the Student Committee for
Involvement in Politics wtfl tfe distributing the Election Extra paper
published by the League of Women Voters which reviews all of the
candidates,and ballot issues. Most of the candidates have organizations
or contacts on campus, normally at the SCIP House at 534 Salvatierra.
If one of the candidates appears attractive to you, sign up and help
him out. The following is an incomplete list of where you can contact
the campaigns:
1. Peace and Freedom Party: San Francisco 5 86 -4528.
2. Democratic Headquarters: 329-4618 ; Unruh Headquarters:
32 9-0313; Tunney: George Piggott 941-7356; Zan Hensen 322-0628;

Williams 327 -1 71 1 ; Rutherford Headquarters: 941 -1 465 ; Croft
Headquarters: 329-0313 or 328-2650.
3. Socialist Workers Party: Sharon CabanissB63-5197.

My personal preference is the Stu McLean congressional race in
Santa Clara County. The McLean campaign is managed by Chris Harte
(22) who is finishing his undergraduate degree at Stanford this fall,
Cathy Cooper (21 ) who graduated last year, and Larry Diamond (19),
a sophomore. McLean is the Democratic peace has
worked with Saul Alinsky and the grape strikers in the valley. He is
running against Charles Gubser, the Republican incumbent of 18 years
and a strong Nixon supporter. McLean apparently is offering the first
serious challenge Gubser has had to face in years.
The hopeful aspect of this campaign is that it is especially
susceptible to student influence. There are over 600 precincts in the
10 th Congressional District. One person could easily canvass a
precinct before the election and return on election day to be sure
those contacted had voted.

If one of the candidates appears attractive to you, sign up and help
him out. The following is an incomplete list of where you can contact
the campaigns:
1. Peace and Freedom Party: San Francisco 5 86 -4528.
2. Democratic Headquarters: 329-4618 ; Unruh Headquarters:
32 9-0313; Tunney: George Piggott 941-7356; Zan Hensen 322-0628;

My personal preference is the Stu McLean congressional race in
Santa Clara County. The McLean campaign is managed by Chris Harte
(22) who is finishing his undergraduate degree at Stanford this fall,
Cathy Cooper (21 ) who graduated last year, and Larry Diamond (19),
a sophomore. McLean is the Democratic peace has
worked with Saul Alinsky and the grape strikers in the valley. He is
running against Charles Gubser, the Republican incumbent of 18 years
and a strong Nixon supporter. McLean apparently is offering the first
serious challenge Gubser has had to face in years.
The hopeful aspect of this campaign is that it is especially
susceptible to student influence. There are over 600 precincts in the
10 th Congressional District. One person could easily canvass a
precinct before the election and return on election day to be sure
those contacted had voted.
