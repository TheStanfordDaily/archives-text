## Foreign Student Problems 
### 
A friend of mine recently went to Europe to work there. He had all
the usual problems with forms and red tape and what not. So one day
he confessed to me that he had just realized that a foreign student
needed a visa to live in the United States.
Most of the people at Stanford are more aware of the hard realities
of life than my friend was. But few know anything more than the
roughest facts on their 1100 fellow foreign students at Stanford.
Still the condition of a foreign student is so totally different of
that of an American student at Stanford that a very urgent question
comes to mind: here is a big group, 10 percent of the student body;
its existence is massively ignored, its activity rarely acknowledged;
how can one be completely ignorant and unconcerned about such an
important minority group and simultaneously claim a genuine interest
and a sincere understanding when it comes to other minority groups
at Stanford?
Same Problems
I want to show some of the problems of daily concern to a foreign
student. Most of them are totally unknown to an American student:
1. Needless to say, many scholarships are reserved for American
students. So most of the foreigners are supported by their
government. But this support is not very generous because dollars are
scarce outside of the U.S.
This support is conditional: for example a student might sign a

gilles kahn

contract to work for a company or a government agency when he
comes back, or accept a scholarship which obliges him to leave the
U.S. for two years after getting his degree.
This support is generally limited in time. Most governments have an
optimistic idea of the time required to get a Ph.D.
Citizenship Delays
2. The authorization to stay in the U.S w has to be renewed every
year. Immigration offices can refuse without further explanation the
renewal of this authorization. Similarly, obtaining the U.S. citizenship
can be delayed an arbitrarily long time for immigrants. These same
immigrants however are subject to the draft although they are not yet
and may never become American citizens.
3. Who among their American friends is in charge of reporting their
activities to the appropriate intelligence service? Or is there no one?
And who among their compatriots is in charge of reporting to the
appropriate intelligence service back home? Or is there noone? These
questions exist in the minds of people who come from countries
where American intelligence has intervened often . . .
4. In case of really deep trouble, whom can a foreign student count
on? His family is not in Massachusetts, he cannot reach any relatives
by phone, nobody is ready to send him a check to pay his dental fees,
or the name of a friendly lawyer.
5. Insurance companies refuse to insure foreign drivers except at
prohibitive rates. Foreigners are not hired where an American citizen
could be hired. The possibility to work is strictly regulated and
limited for a foreigner. When it comes to summer jobs, foreigners can
hardly find any outside the University.
Obvious Problems
This list shows only obvious problems and none of them required a
paragraph of explanations. But language difficulties, cultural shock,
feeling of isolation aren't empty words. They just seem to be more
difficult concepts to get through. You have to experience them to
realize fully what they mean. But difficulties are not always where
American students believe they should be: when one of his fellow
American student bitterly complains about the excessive competition
in the University you shall witness the smile of a French or a Japanese
student.
Now to sum up, maybe you think that most foreigners are
scientists or engineers and some kind of psychological freaks? It is
true that everything pushes them into devoting themselves exclusively
to their studies, to finish quickly and come back home. But no, sorry,
that's not it. Foreign students are no more than American students'
machines that swallow knowledge at one end and redeliver it at the
other end. Most of them aren't ready to open a parenthesis in their
life for the duration of their stay in the U.S., or to put to sleep the
development of their personality, or to silence their political
convictions.
In short, they refuse to be considered as exotic objects displayed
on some Stanford shelf to increase-tTle 'self-satisfaction of the 'real'
students and the pride of tin Stanford administrator who can show
them to his visitors.

life for the duration of their stay in the U.S., or to put to sleep the
development of their personality, or to silence their political
convictions.

on some Stanford shelf to increase-tTle 'self-satisfaction of the 'real'
students and the pride of tin Stanford administrator who can show

A friend of mine recently went to Europe to work there. He had all
the usual problems with forms and red tape and what not. So one day
he confessed to me that he had just realized that a foreign student
needed a visa to live in the United States.
Most of the people at Stanford are more aware of the hard realities
of life than my friend was. But few know anything more than the
roughest facts on their 1100 fellow foreign students at Stanford.
Still the condition of a foreign student is so totally different of
that of an American student at Stanford that a very urgent question
comes to mind: here is a big group, 10 percent of the student body;
its existence is massively ignored, its activity rarely acknowledged;
how can one be completely ignorant and unconcerned about such an
important minority group and simultaneously claim a genuine interest
and a sincere understanding when it comes to other minority groups
at Stanford?
Same Problems
I want to show some of the problems of daily concern to a foreign
student. Most of them are totally unknown to an American student:
1. Needless to say, many scholarships are reserved for American
students. So most of the foreigners are supported by their
government. But this support is not very generous because dollars are
scarce outside of the U.S.
This support is conditional: for example a student might sign a

gilles kahn

contract to work for a company or a government agency when he
comes back, or accept a scholarship which obliges him to leave the
U.S. for two years after getting his degree.
This support is generally limited in time. Most governments have an
optimistic idea of the time required to get a Ph.D.
Citizenship Delays
2. The authorization to stay in the U.S w has to be renewed every
year. Immigration offices can refuse without further explanation the
renewal of this authorization. Similarly, obtaining the U.S. citizenship
can be delayed an arbitrarily long time for immigrants. These same
immigrants however are subject to the draft although they are not yet
and may never become American citizens.
3. Who among their American friends is in charge of reporting their
activities to the appropriate intelligence service? Or is there no one?
And who among their compatriots is in charge of reporting to the
appropriate intelligence service back home? Or is there noone? These
questions exist in the minds of people who come from countries
where American intelligence has intervened often . . .
4. In case of really deep trouble, whom can a foreign student count
on? His family is not in Massachusetts, he cannot reach any relatives
by phone, nobody is ready to send him a check to pay his dental fees,
or the name of a friendly lawyer.
5. Insurance companies refuse to insure foreign drivers except at
prohibitive rates. Foreigners are not hired where an American citizen
could be hired. The possibility to work is strictly regulated and
limited for a foreigner. When it comes to summer jobs, foreigners can
hardly find any outside the University.
Obvious Problems
This list shows only obvious problems and none of them required a
paragraph of explanations. But language difficulties, cultural shock,
feeling of isolation aren't empty words. They just seem to be more
difficult concepts to get through. You have to experience them to
realize fully what they mean. But difficulties are not always where
American students believe they should be: when one of his fellow
American student bitterly complains about the excessive competition
in the University you shall witness the smile of a French or a Japanese
student.
Now to sum up, maybe you think that most foreigners are
scientists or engineers and some kind of psychological freaks? It is
true that everything pushes them into devoting themselves exclusively
to their studies, to finish quickly and come back home. But no, sorry,
that's not it. Foreign students are no more than American students'
machines that swallow knowledge at one end and redeliver it at the
other end. Most of them aren't ready to open a parenthesis in their
life for the duration of their stay in the U.S., or to put to sleep the
