If you know a girl
considering an
ABORTION
this message might
even save her life!
It is no longer necessary for unfortu
nate girls to be ruthlessly exploited
for profit by quacks and inept butch
ers. Now they can have perfectly
legal abortions under strict hospital
care. The new California Therapeutic
Abortion Act provides that all serv
ices be performed by physicians in
accredited hospitals.
Last year it is estimated some
700,000 illegal abortions were per
formed in the United States. Almost
without exception exorbitant prices
were charged, hospital facilities
were not available and a complete
medical staff was not present to
cope with emergencies.
Some of those girls died unneces
sarily. Others suffered severe infec
tions. Still others will never again
be able to bear a child due to in
competent treatment.
The National Abortion Council for
Therapeutic Abortions and Family
Planning wants to make sure that
all girls receive humane and sani
tary treatment YOU CAN HELP.
If you know of a pregnant girl who
is considering sneaking off to have
her abortion in a germ infected
apartment or office tell her to call
us. Our counseling service is free.
We recommend only:
the most reputable physicians; doc
tors offering fair and reasonable
prices; services which will be com
pletely within the law; services per
formed at accredited hospitals.
