# More Units?
## Housing Plans Unclear 
### BOB LITTERMAN Third In A Series 
The Wright Committee report,
published last May, recommended that,
"the University adopt plans for the
phased development of 600 to 2000
low/moderate income units."
This recommendation was based
upon four considerations facing the
University: (1) partial responsibility for
the severe housing shortage; (2)
ownership of the largest piece of
undeveloped land in the mid peninsula;
(3) leadership role in the area; and (4)
self-interest in developing good
relations with nearby communities.
The report said, "The committee
believes that when the University (or
any other institution, including a
municipality) contributes to creating a
severe social problem. The committee
does not share the view that the
University can meet that obligation
merely by offering ideas, expertise, and
moral encouragement to the
surrounding communities as they
attempt to grapple with the difficulties.
Suitable Land
"In the mid-Peninsula, land suitable
for low moderate housing development
is very hard to come by. Stanford
would be vulnerable to sharp criticism
(and justified criticism, we believe) if it
were to refuse to make available any
land at all for the broad enterprise of

housing development that must be
carried out in this area during the next
couple of decades.
"Stanford in the past played, and in
the future should continue to play, a
role of leadership in this area. Some
problems are so serious that they
require the University to act as well as
talk. A strong lead taken by Stanford
may impel other communities in the
region to pitch in.
Self Interest
"Adequate and attractive housing on
campus lands is likely to make staff
jobs at Stanford, and employment in
the industrial park, considerable more
attractive than they are now.
Self-interest can be conceived in a
broader sense, involving Stanford's
relation with the surrounding
community. Finally, Stanford's
national stature stands to gain
significantly if it can demonstrate its
ability to lead and innovate in a
sensitive area of contemporary life."
Real Estate Manager Boyd Smith
says of the report, "I agree with its
recommendation of 600 units, but I
think we have to look farther into the
problem. The effect of 600 to 2000
units is negligable in its effect on the
total low/moderate income housing
problem. "Because of the magnitude of
the problem, I think everyone has to
help. The solution must be started

nationally and in the bay area on a
mass, large scale. There is probably a
need for one quarter million housing
units in the Bay Area over the next few
years.
Housing Commitment
"I don't know what measure people
are using to say that Stanford is
responsible to house all the employees
on its lands. Our taxes are subsidizing a
number of residences in other areas.
The Industrial Park and shopping
center income to the university is two
million dollars a year, but they pay 10
million dollars in taxes to the
surrounding communities."
So far, Stanford has committed
itself to the development of about 200
units of low/moderate income housing
at a sight on Frenchman's Hill across
Peter Coutts Road from faculty
housing. The sight was ideal, according
to Smith, because middle and upper
income housing already existed in the
area, and because schools and shopping
facilities were close by.
Not Soon
The question of when Stanford will
develop more of its land with
low/moderate income housing is open
for debate. According to associate
provost Robert Rosensweig, "Because
of the financial questions involved it is


HOUSING SITES—The above map, reprinted from the Wright Committee Report on housing, shows sites considered suitable
for development of low and moderate income housing. Site B has already been scheduled for development of 200 units. Sites
G, L, and J are considered the best future possibilities by regional planner Larry Livingston, who is presently doing a land use
study for the University. Livingston suggests increasing site G from the 40 acres shown to an area of 140 acres.
