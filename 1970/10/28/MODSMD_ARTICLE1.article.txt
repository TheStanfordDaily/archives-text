# More Units?
## Housing Plans Unclear 
### BOB LITTERMAN Third In A Series 
The Wright Committee report,
published last May, recommended that,
"the University adopt plans for the
phased development of 600 to 2000
low/moderate income units."
This recommendation was based
upon four considerations facing the
University: (1) partial responsibility for
the severe housing shortage; (2)
ownership of the largest piece of
undeveloped land in the mid peninsula;
(3) leadership role in the area; and (4)
self-interest in developing good
relations with nearby communities.
The report said, "The committee
believes that when the University (or
any other institution, including a
municipality) contributes to creating a
severe social problem. The committee
does not share the view that the
University can meet that obligation
merely by offering ideas, expertise, and
moral encouragement to the
surrounding communities as they
attempt to grapple with the difficulties.
Suitable Land
"In the mid-Peninsula, land suitable
for low moderate housing development
is very hard to come by. Stanford
would be vulnerable to sharp criticism
(and justified criticism, we believe) if it
were to refuse to make available any
land at all for the broad enterprise of

housing development that must be
carried out in this area during the next
couple of decades.
"Stanford in the past played, and in
the future should continue to play, a
role of leadership in this area. Some
problems are so serious that they
require the University to act as well as
talk. A strong lead taken by Stanford
may impel other communities in the
region to pitch in.
Self Interest
"Adequate and attractive housing on
campus lands is likely to make staff
jobs at Stanford, and employment in
the industrial park, considerable more
attractive than they are now.
Self-interest can be conceived in a
broader sense, involving Stanford's
relation with the surrounding
community. Finally, Stanford's
national stature stands to gain
significantly if it can demonstrate its
ability to lead and innovate in a
sensitive area of contemporary life."
Real Estate Manager Boyd Smith
says of the report, "I agree with its
recommendation of 600 units, but I
think we have to look farther into the
problem. The effect of 600 to 2000
units is negligable in its effect on the
total low/moderate income housing
problem. "Because of the magnitude of
the problem, I think everyone has to
help. The solution must be started

nationally and in the bay area on a
mass, large scale. There is probably a
need for one quarter million housing
units in the Bay Area over the next few
years.
Housing Commitment
"I don't know what measure people
are using to say that Stanford is
responsible to house all the employees
on its lands. Our taxes are subsidizing a
number of residences in other areas.
The Industrial Park and shopping
center income to the university is two
million dollars a year, but they pay 10
million dollars in taxes to the
surrounding communities."
So far, Stanford has committed
itself to the development of about 200
units of low/moderate income housing
at a sight on Frenchman's Hill across
Peter Coutts Road from faculty
housing. The sight was ideal, according
to Smith, because middle and upper
income housing already existed in the
area, and because schools and shopping
facilities were close by.
Not Soon
The question of when Stanford will
develop more of its land with
low/moderate income housing is open
for debate. According to associate
provost Robert Rosensweig, "Because
of the financial questions involved it is


HOUSING SITES—The above map, reprinted from the Wright Committee Report on housing, shows sites considered suitable
for development of low and moderate income housing. Site B has already been scheduled for development of 200 units. Sites
G, L, and J are considered the best future possibilities by regional planner Larry Livingston, who is presently doing a land use
study for the University. Livingston suggests increasing site G from the 40 acres shown to an area of 140 acres.
not likely that we will build more at
any time soon."
The University also apparently
would liek to see if the first group of
200 units is successful. Rosensweig
noted, however, that it will take two
years before anybody moves into
houses in the development on
Frenchman's Hill, and several years
later before the relative success of the
project could be evaluated.
Thus, he feels that if Stanford is
going to continue to build such projects
it will not be able to wait for a
complete evaluation. "The truth is," he
said, "no one has really addressed
themselves to that problem."
Encouragement Or Tokenism
Larry Livingston, a regional planner
hired by Stanford, says,"I don't know
whether it (the 200 units) is
encouragement or tokenism. The board
of trustees has asked us to find sites for
at least 400 more units. But you must
be careful. We don't believe that
Stanford should build ghettos."
Livingston will probably recommend
to the trustees that in any further
residential development of University
lands between 2 0 and 5 0 percent of the
units be designed for low and moderate

income federal subsidy programs. He
told the Daily, "Even on the university
1 don't think you have a chance for a
balanced community if you build 5 0
percent or more subsidized housing."
Three sites presently being
considered by Livingston for residential
development are (1) the Webb ranch
area (area J on map); (2) the Guernsey
Farm (area L); and (3) Interdale (area
G). "We have no firm convictions at the
moment," says Livingston, "The areas
could have anywhere from 25 to 5 0
percent townhouses, and any amount
of that could be used by people of low
to moderate incomes."
Range of Possibilities
Livingston's plan is to present a
range of possibilities before the
trustees. Presently that range includes
between 625 and 1600 townhouse
units. However, he says, "We don't
have cash flow statistics yet and that
will certainly influence our thinking."
According to Livingston, "The range
we are thinking of is just about the
same as the Wright Committee
recommendations, but in all honesty
it's just an accident. My general plans
are in agreement with the Moulton
Committee's recommendation that the
University should provide 10 percent of
the housing need "

"the University adopt plans for the
phased development of 600 to 2000

undeveloped land in the mid peninsula;
(3) leadership role in the area; and (4)
self-interest in developing good
relations with nearby communities.
The report said, "The committee
believes that when the University (or
any other institution, including a
municipality) contributes to creating a
severe social problem. The committee
does not share the view that the
University can meet that obligation
merely by offering ideas, expertise, and
moral encouragement to the
surrounding communities as they
attempt to grapple with the difficulties.
Suitable Land
"In the mid-Peninsula, land suitable
for low moderate housing development
is very hard to come by. Stanford
would be vulnerable to sharp criticism
(and justified criticism, we believe) if it
were to refuse to make available any
land at all for the broad enterprise of

housing development that must be
carried out in this area during the next
couple of decades.
"Stanford in the past played, and in
the future should continue to play, a
role of leadership in this area. Some
problems are so serious that they
require the University to act as well as
talk. A strong lead taken by Stanford
may impel other communities in the
region to pitch in.
Self Interest
"Adequate and attractive housing on
campus lands is likely to make staff
jobs at Stanford, and employment in
the industrial park, considerable more
attractive than they are now.
Self-interest can be conceived in a
broader sense, involving Stanford's
relation with the surrounding
community. Finally, Stanford's
national stature stands to gain
significantly if it can demonstrate its
ability to lead and innovate in a
sensitive area of contemporary life."
Real Estate Manager Boyd Smith
says of the report, "I agree with its
recommendation of 600 units, but I
think we have to look farther into the
problem. The effect of 600 to 2000
units is negligable in its effect on the
total low/moderate income housing
problem. "Because of the magnitude of
the problem, I think everyone has to
help. The solution must be started

nationally and in the bay area on a
mass, large scale. There is probably a
need for one quarter million housing
units in the Bay Area over the next few
years.
Housing Commitment
"I don't know what measure people
are using to say that Stanford is
responsible to house all the employees
on its lands. Our taxes are subsidizing a
number of residences in other areas.
The Industrial Park and shopping
center income to the university is two
million dollars a year, but they pay 10
million dollars in taxes to the
surrounding communities."
So far, Stanford has committed
itself to the development of about 200
units of low/moderate income housing
at a sight on Frenchman's Hill across
Peter Coutts Road from faculty
housing. The sight was ideal, according
to Smith, because middle and upper
income housing already existed in the
area, and because schools and shopping
facilities were close by.
Not Soon
The question of when Stanford will
develop more of its land with
low/moderate income housing is open
for debate. According to associate
provost Robert Rosensweig, "Because
of the financial questions involved it is


HOUSING SITES—The above map, reprinted from the Wright Committee Report on housing, shows sites considered suitable
for development of low and moderate income housing. Site B has already been scheduled for development of 200 units. Sites
G, L, and J are considered the best future possibilities by regional planner Larry Livingston, who is presently doing a land use
study for the University. Livingston suggests increasing site G from the 40 acres shown to an area of 140 acres.
not likely that we will build more at
any time soon."
The University also apparently
would liek to see if the first group of
200 units is successful. Rosensweig
noted, however, that it will take two
years before anybody moves into
houses in the development on
Frenchman's Hill, and several years
later before the relative success of the
project could be evaluated.
Thus, he feels that if Stanford is
going to continue to build such projects
it will not be able to wait for a
complete evaluation. "The truth is," he
said, "no one has really addressed
themselves to that problem."
Encouragement Or Tokenism
Larry Livingston, a regional planner
hired by Stanford, says,"I don't know
whether it (the 200 units) is
encouragement or tokenism. The board
of trustees has asked us to find sites for
at least 400 more units. But you must
be careful. We don't believe that
Stanford should build ghettos."
Livingston will probably recommend
to the trustees that in any further
residential development of University
lands between 2 0 and 5 0 percent of the
units be designed for low and moderate

income federal subsidy programs. He
told the Daily, "Even on the university
1 don't think you have a chance for a
balanced community if you build 5 0
percent or more subsidized housing."
Three sites presently being
considered by Livingston for residential
development are (1) the Webb ranch
area (area J on map); (2) the Guernsey
Farm (area L); and (3) Interdale (area
G). "We have no firm convictions at the
moment," says Livingston, "The areas
could have anywhere from 25 to 5 0
percent townhouses, and any amount
of that could be used by people of low
to moderate incomes."
Range of Possibilities
Livingston's plan is to present a
range of possibilities before the
trustees. Presently that range includes
between 625 and 1600 townhouse
units. However, he says, "We don't
have cash flow statistics yet and that
will certainly influence our thinking."
According to Livingston, "The range
we are thinking of is just about the
same as the Wright Committee
recommendations, but in all honesty
it's just an accident. My general plans
are in agreement with the Moulton
Committee's recommendation that the
University should provide 10 percent of
the housing need "
The Wright Committee report,
published last May, recommended that,
"the University adopt plans for the
phased development of 600 to 2000
low/moderate income units."
This recommendation was based
upon four considerations facing the
University: (1) partial responsibility for
the severe housing shortage; (2)
ownership of the largest piece of
undeveloped land in the mid peninsula;
(3) leadership role in the area; and (4)
self-interest in developing good

merely by offering ideas, expertise, and
moral encouragement to the
surrounding communities as they
attempt to grapple with the difficulties.
Suitable Land
"In the mid-Peninsula, land suitable
for low moderate housing development
is very hard to come by. Stanford
would be vulnerable to sharp criticism
(and justified criticism, we believe) if it
were to refuse to make available any
land at all for the broad enterprise of

housing development that must be
carried out in this area during the next
couple of decades.
"Stanford in the past played, and in
the future should continue to play, a
role of leadership in this area. Some
problems are so serious that they
require the University to act as well as
talk. A strong lead taken by Stanford
may impel other communities in the
region to pitch in.
Self Interest
"Adequate and attractive housing on
campus lands is likely to make staff
jobs at Stanford, and employment in
the industrial park, considerable more
attractive than they are now.
Self-interest can be conceived in a
broader sense, involving Stanford's
relation with the surrounding
community. Finally, Stanford's
national stature stands to gain
significantly if it can demonstrate its
ability to lead and innovate in a
sensitive area of contemporary life."
Real Estate Manager Boyd Smith
says of the report, "I agree with its
recommendation of 600 units, but I
think we have to look farther into the
problem. The effect of 600 to 2000
units is negligable in its effect on the
total low/moderate income housing
problem. "Because of the magnitude of
the problem, I think everyone has to
help. The solution must be started

nationally and in the bay area on a
mass, large scale. There is probably a
need for one quarter million housing
units in the Bay Area over the next few
years.
Housing Commitment
"I don't know what measure people
are using to say that Stanford is
responsible to house all the employees
on its lands. Our taxes are subsidizing a
number of residences in other areas.
The Industrial Park and shopping
center income to the university is two
million dollars a year, but they pay 10
million dollars in taxes to the
surrounding communities."
So far, Stanford has committed
itself to the development of about 200
units of low/moderate income housing
at a sight on Frenchman's Hill across
Peter Coutts Road from faculty
housing. The sight was ideal, according
to Smith, because middle and upper
income housing already existed in the
area, and because schools and shopping
facilities were close by.
Not Soon
The question of when Stanford will
develop more of its land with
low/moderate income housing is open
for debate. According to associate
provost Robert Rosensweig, "Because
of the financial questions involved it is


HOUSING SITES—The above map, reprinted from the Wright Committee Report on housing, shows sites considered suitable
for development of low and moderate income housing. Site B has already been scheduled for development of 200 units. Sites
G, L, and J are considered the best future possibilities by regional planner Larry Livingston, who is presently doing a land use
study for the University. Livingston suggests increasing site G from the 40 acres shown to an area of 140 acres.
not likely that we will build more at
any time soon."
The University also apparently
would liek to see if the first group of
200 units is successful. Rosensweig
noted, however, that it will take two
years before anybody moves into
houses in the development on
Frenchman's Hill, and several years
later before the relative success of the
project could be evaluated.
Thus, he feels that if Stanford is
going to continue to build such projects
it will not be able to wait for a
complete evaluation. "The truth is," he
said, "no one has really addressed
themselves to that problem."
Encouragement Or Tokenism
Larry Livingston, a regional planner
hired by Stanford, says,"I don't know
whether it (the 200 units) is
encouragement or tokenism. The board
of trustees has asked us to find sites for
at least 400 more units. But you must
be careful. We don't believe that
Stanford should build ghettos."
Livingston will probably recommend
to the trustees that in any further
residential development of University
lands between 2 0 and 5 0 percent of the
units be designed for low and moderate

income federal subsidy programs. He
told the Daily, "Even on the university
1 don't think you have a chance for a
balanced community if you build 5 0
percent or more subsidized housing."
Three sites presently being
considered by Livingston for residential
development are (1) the Webb ranch
area (area J on map); (2) the Guernsey
Farm (area L); and (3) Interdale (area
G). "We have no firm convictions at the
moment," says Livingston, "The areas
could have anywhere from 25 to 5 0
percent townhouses, and any amount
of that could be used by people of low
to moderate incomes."
Range of Possibilities
Livingston's plan is to present a
range of possibilities before the
trustees. Presently that range includes
between 625 and 1600 townhouse
units. However, he says, "We don't
have cash flow statistics yet and that
will certainly influence our thinking."
According to Livingston, "The range
we are thinking of is just about the
same as the Wright Committee
recommendations, but in all honesty
it's just an accident. My general plans
are in agreement with the Moulton
Committee's recommendation that the
University should provide 10 percent of
the housing need "
The Wright Committee report,
published last May, recommended that,
"the University adopt plans for the
phased development of 600 to 2000
low/moderate income units."
This recommendation was based
upon four considerations facing the
University: (1) partial responsibility for
the severe housing shortage; (2)
ownership of the largest piece of
undeveloped land in the mid peninsula;
(3) leadership role in the area; and (4)
self-interest in developing good
relations with nearby communities.
The report said, "The committee
believes that when the University (or
any other institution, including a
municipality) contributes to creating a
severe social problem. The committee
does not share the view that the
University can meet that obligation
merely by offering ideas, expertise, and
