# UGLY Can Be Beautiful
## 
### JANET FIRESTEIN 
"If anyone wants me, I'll be at UGLY."
UGLY? What is that? To the entering
freshman, UGLY is how one looks in the
morning, but, to veterans of the academic wars,
it is an affectionate nickname for the Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
By definition, a library is a place where books
and other research materials are kept a the
purpose of borrowing. It is by nature q quiet
place and condusive to study; however, there is
something about UGLY that fosters an
atmosphere of fun and games.
Many strange things have been known to
happen in UGLY. For example, one can see a live
University Band enter a library and play for five
or ten minutes the night before an important
football game or watch young adults throw
super-balls and paper airplanes from the fourth
floor railing.
Where else can one sit in the language lab with
the tape on upside down? "I just sat there for a
half hour, listening to the Italian guy talk
backwards," confided one freshman.
The Meeting Place
Actually, the library has become more of a
meeting place than anything else. A student can
meet with any number of old and new
acquaintances in the stairwells, elevators, or
reading areas. The ensuing conversations take on
varied tones. There are everything from dinner
invitations, to discussions on the relative merits
of certain quarterbacks, to original comments
like "L.A. is a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't
want to live there."
The "soundproof" telephone booths add an
interesting dimension to library life as all four
..~ors involve themselves in a heated argument
■ ■*---nClvde and Nellie.

The elevators are a welcome part of UGLY,
judging by their heavy usage. This could indicate
something about the laziness of Stanford
students. After all, there are only 78 stairs from
the first to fourth floors. On the other hand, the
popularity of the elevators can be easily
understood if one realizes that they are not used
solely for travelling to the fourth floor, uiid that
kissing between floors is not uncommon.
When one is not wandering around aimlessly
or sneaking candy bars behind the shelves, some
studying does go on. The yellow markers may get
a real workout during an evening, or the scholar
can stare at a single page for several hours before
he packs up and flees. Meanwhile, in the
background the drinking fountain hums happily,
pages rustle, pens scratch, and voices whisper as
people quietly fall asleep over their books.
Freshman Problem
One major problem that freshmen find
insurmountable on their first venture in UGLY is
checking out a book. It is a very difficult
procedure when it becomes really necessary!
Those little yellow cards can get very
complicated. If that's not bad enough, many
students, when entering a quiet library (and
UGLY can be quiet sometimes), get very
self-conscious about squeaky shoes, heavy heels,
or similar problems, and get so wrapped up in
trying to keep their feet silent that they end up
tripping over them.
One girl tripped three times attempting to go
up the stairs. She should have stuck to the
elevator.
Status-seekers also find their way into the
library. Lugging large, heavy text books, they
flock to UGLY in the hopes that someone
important will see that they really do study. But
for those who can't pick up this habit, UGLY
still has its appeal.

SLEEPING BEAUTY—Studying is hard work, and her roommates
keep her up at night. The chair is soft and the atmosphere quiet. Many
students follow the example of this girl, and nap as well as study at
UGLY.

VACANT STARE—Though this girl does not seem to be having a lot
of fun in UGLY, she seems as unstudious as many of the library's
merry-makers.
