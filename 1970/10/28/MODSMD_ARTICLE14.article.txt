# Liszt: Alive, Well In London?
## 
### PEDRO RAMET 
Imagine your surprise if, one
night upon coming home after a
hard day's booking, you were
greeted by a tall bearded
individual sporting a naval
uniform of Imperial Russia who
claimed to be Rimsky-Korsakov.
Suppose further that he told you
that he had written a new place of
music ("The Flight of the
Wasp?") which he wanted you to
hear.
This, basically, is the story
behind the new Philips release of
Rosemary Brown's pianistic
endeavors, except in this case, the
tall individual in question is Franz
Liszt.
It all began (so she says) many
years ago when she was a child;
she had a vision of an elderly
gentleman with long white hair,
clad soberly in a black cassock. He
told her that he had been a
famous composer and added,
before evanescing, that he would
see her again. Remarkably
enough, though, when, a few
years ago, Liszt made good his
promise, he brought with him a
virtual constillation of musical
'greats', among them Bach,
Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin,
Debussy, Schubert, Brahms and
Rachmaninoff.
Debussy has apparently
become a very stylish hippy,
wears bell-bottoms and has taken
up painting. Chopin has become a
T.V. addict. Schubert has a less
than adequate singing voice. And
Liszt himself likes to accompany
Mrs. Brown shopping, although he
is amazed at the soaring costs of
food.
First In Series
The current Philips record
( PH S-9 0 0-25 6 ) represents,
moreover, only the first in a
projected series to be devoted to
this repertory. Still in the process
are a choral symphony (no. 10)
by Beethoven, a number of new
Hungarian Rhapsodies by Liszt,
and a finish to the enigmatic
"Unfinished Symphony".
It would be presumptuous in
the utmost to attempt a judgment
on the authenticity of what is
purportedly the finest team of
ghost-writers assembled in a long
time. But about the pieces
themselves: there are 16
selections, half of them performed
by Rosemary Brown, the other
half by Peter Katin. All of them

are short. Most if not all of them
are at least somewhat interesting
in themselves, completely aside
from the question of authorship.
At least one, "Danse
Exotique" by Debussy, can
become positively addictive.
Furthermore, it utilizes the same
intervalic relationships which
Debussy favored. The latest
Brahms waltz is also a very
attractive piece. Beethoven's
Bagatelle rumbles with furious
energy, while Schubert's Moment
Musicale is gentle and melodious.
Of the 16 selections, eight of
them are attributed to Liszt.

What is particularly surprising
to a skeptic like myself, however,
is that the Beethoven really
sounds like Beethoven; the
Chopin (two Impromptus and a
Ballade) sounds like Chopin; the
Debussy and the Brahms sound
like Debussy and Brahms.
Not The First
There have been revivals and
discoveries before. The Mahler
tenth symphony was a discovery,
as were the early Dvorak
symphonies. At one time, Fritz
Kreisler became notorious for his
'discoveries' of late works by late
composers. To this day, his violin

concerto is listed under Mozart,
and most people will insist
adamantly that "Humoresque" is
the work of Dvorak (when, in
actual fact, another of Kreisler's).
But Rosemary Brown is hardly
as accomplished a musician as
Kreisler. And furthermore, there
is the promise of much to come.
And the more material there is,
the easier it will become to deal
with the question of its
composition. Why, with time and
study we shall be able to resolve
entirely this question of life after
death and the opus posthumous.
Or will we?




A LITTLE HELP FROM HER FRlENDSâ€”Although Rosemary Brown may not know much about music,
she does claim to have excellent advisors, such as Liszt, above, and Beethoven, and this other fellow on
the right who doesn't look like much but sure can play the piano.
