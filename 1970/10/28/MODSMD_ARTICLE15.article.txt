An investigation of the
pumpkin reveals that you can use
them to make pumpkin pie, you
can eat the seeds, you can carve
them out, and if your talents are
distinctive enough you can most
likely turn one into a coach and
whisk Cinderella off to a ball
—pulled by six mice.
With Halloween rapidly
approaching and the Great
Pumpkin about to fill the
stockings of all the little children
around with fantastic gifts (he's
making a list, he's checking it
twice, gonna find out who's
naughty and nice???) a brief

journey into the history and
relevance of the pumpkin is in
order.
The well known gourdlike fruit
of a vine (Cucurbita pepo) has
figured prominently in the history
of man. It's earliest known use
was by the Rananga tribe of
southeastern Bongoland where the
flesh of the pumpkin was used as
mortar to build crude igloo-like
structures. The gourd later took
on a religious connotation when it
was used in the more modern
context of a jack-o-lantern in
conjunction with Allhallows-also
known as Hallowmas, All Saints
Day, and Halloween.

There are conflicting theories
on whether the demon-like
jack-o-lantern was carved to
represent evil spirits or to scare
them off. Many anthropologists
believe that the carving of the
pumpkin was akin to the
manufacture of icons but made
the materials and the craft tools
available to the masses for the
first time. In that sense, the
pumpkin is very much akin to the
printing press as far as bringing
culture and religion to the
common people and prompting
the discovery of the new world. It
has also been blamed for the

decline of morality in the Western
World and more recently for the
disrespect of youth for symbols.
Recent research has found that
the pumpkin contains no
dangerous or hallucinogenic drugs;
however scientists at the
University of Louisiana have
discovered that mice fed only
pumpkin pie died of self-induced
hyperphasia.
Freud briefly investigated the
significance of carving a pumpkin
and related it to the castration
anxiety. According to Webster's
New International Dictionary, the
pumpkin has "a nearly round
shape and deep yellow color. It
has large slightly lobed leaves and
yellow flowers with erect corolla
lobes." The symbology runs
rampant.
The most recent public figure
to delve into the pumpkin
mistique has been Charles Shul/.
with his creation of Charlie
Brown's pumpkin fantasies. Poor
Charlie waits each year in his
pumpkin patch, hoping theGreat
Pumpkin will bring him gifts and
inevitably keeping one of his
friends from their tricks and
treats. If Saturday night you find
a large orange object floating
across the horizon, please point
the way to Petaluma and make
Charlie happy.

the materials and the craft tools
available to the masses for the
first time. In that sense, the
pumpkin is very much akin to the
printing press as far as bringing
culture and religion to the
common people and prompting
the discovery of the new world. It
has also been blamed for the

decline of morality in the Western
World and more recently for the
disrespect of youth for symbols.
Recent research has found that
the pumpkin contains no
dangerous or hallucinogenic drugs;
however scientists at the
University of Louisiana have
discovered that mice fed only
pumpkin pie died of self-induced
hyperphasia.
Freud briefly investigated the
significance of carving a pumpkin
and related it to the castration
anxiety. According to Webster's
New International Dictionary, the
pumpkin has "a nearly round
shape and deep yellow color. It
has large slightly lobed leaves and
yellow flowers with erect corolla
lobes." The symbology runs
rampant.
The most recent public figure
to delve into the pumpkin
mistique has been Charles Shul/.
with his creation of Charlie
Brown's pumpkin fantasies. Poor
Charlie waits each year in his
pumpkin patch, hoping theGreat
Pumpkin will bring him gifts and
inevitably keeping one of his
friends from their tricks and
treats. If Saturday night you find
a large orange object floating
across the horizon, please point
the way to Petaluma and make
Charlie happy.

An investigation of the
pumpkin reveals that you can use
them to make pumpkin pie, you
can eat the seeds, you can carve
them out, and if your talents are
distinctive enough you can most
likely turn one into a coach and
whisk Cinderella off to a ball
—pulled by six mice.
With Halloween rapidly
approaching and the Great
Pumpkin about to fill the
stockings of all the little children
around with fantastic gifts (he's
making a list, he's checking it
twice, gonna find out who's
naughty and nice???) a brief

journey into the history and
relevance of the pumpkin is in
order.
The well known gourdlike fruit
of a vine (Cucurbita pepo) has
figured prominently in the history
of man. It's earliest known use
was by the Rananga tribe of
southeastern Bongoland where the
flesh of the pumpkin was used as
mortar to build crude igloo-like
structures. The gourd later took
on a religious connotation when it
was used in the more modern
context of a jack-o-lantern in
conjunction with Allhallows-also
known as Hallowmas, All Saints
Day, and Halloween.

There are conflicting theories
on whether the demon-like
jack-o-lantern was carved to
represent evil spirits or to scare
them off. Many anthropologists
believe that the carving of the
pumpkin was akin to the
manufacture of icons but made
the materials and the craft tools
available to the masses for the
first time. In that sense, the
pumpkin is very much akin to the
printing press as far as bringing
