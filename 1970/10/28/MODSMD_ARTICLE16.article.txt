# Runners Dump Bruins
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Arvid Kretz, Don Kardong, and
Robert Coe shattered UCLA's
course record in sweeping the top
three places to lead Stanford's
varsity cross country team to a
21-34 victory over a tough Bruin
team last Saturday in Los Angeles.
UCLA's top runner, Neil
Sybert, managed to stick with the
top three Indian runners for most
of the race, but could finish no
better than fourth. Duncan
Macdonald, primarily a middle
distance man, turned in a great
performance over the grueling 5 .7
mile course and missed the course
record by only one second in
finishing fifth.
Kretz came in with a time of
29:52 , bettering the old course
record of 30 :17 . Kardong and Coe
also obliterated the old mark by
finishing second and third with
times of 29:59 and 30:06.
Macdonald came on very strong at
the end of the race and finished
only three seconds behind Sybert.
Depth
Stanford's characteristic lack
of depth was again displayed in
the UCLA meet as four Bruins
finished in a cluster behind
Macdonald. Bernie Lahde, running
with painful leg injuries, finished
in tenth place to round out the
scoring for the Indians.
Rick Geisler and Brian
Mittelstaedt placed 1 3 th and 15 th
for the Cards and freshmen Peter
Fitzmaurice and Neil Bernstein
ended the race in 14th and 16th
positions.
At the halfway point in the
race, Coe, Kretz, and Kardong
were running out in front with
Sybert. Using teamwork and
psychology, the Indians
demoralized Sybert, who had no
help from any of his teammates.
Captain Don Kardong gave
credit for Stanford's win to
Duncan Macdonald, though.
"Duncan ran a fantastic race in
holding off those four UCLA

runners bunched behind him and
at the same time managed to
pressure Sybert."
Stanford was not expected to
defeat the Bruins by such a wide
margin and the UCLA coach even
expressed confidence before the
meet. "I feel that the top five
runners on this year's team are as
good as any top five I have had in
the past," claimed Coach Jim
Bush.
Even in defeat, the UCLA
coach would not fault his runners.
"All our boys improved their
times in this meet and one broke
our course record (Sybert). Yet,
we still were beaten in every way
possible."
Stanford turned in its finest

performance of the year in
trouncing a strong Bruin squad.
Each team member attributed the
win to the fine coaching of
Marshall Clark and the strong
team effort that they themselves
produced.
With wins over both USC and
UCLA, the cross country team
will be in a commanding position
at the Pac-8 meet in Spokane,
Washington on November 14.
Oregon is the perennial favorite
and should dominate the contest
this year, but the Indians have
shown that they have the strength
to seriously challenge the Ducks.
Before the season began, USC
and UCLA were given good
chances to take second and third

places in the Pae-8 behind Oregon.
Washington will have a strong
team and anything could happen
jn a meet the size of the Pac-8
championship, but Stanford now
has to be considered one of tne
favorites for the league crown.
The Indians will take a break
from Pac-8 competition this
weekend, and will run in the
Pacific AAU Championships this
Saturday in San Francisco.
The following week, Stanford
will wind up its dual meet season
when it races against Cal at
Berkeley. The Bears have been
convincingly beaten by UCLA,
though, and should not pose a
serious problem to Stanford's
runners.

THE LEADERS—Arvid Kretz, Duncan Mac Donald and Robert Coe, first, fifth and third place finishers in
Los Angeles Saturday against the Bruins, were three of four Stanford runners in the first five in the Tribe's
21 -34 win over UCLA. Don Kardong, who tied with Kretz for first the week before against San Jose State
and USC, finished second.
Arvid Kretz, Don Kardong, and
Robert Coe shattered UCLA's
course record in sweeping the top
three places to lead Stanford's
varsity cross country team to a
21-34 victory over a tough Bruin
team last Saturday in Los Angeles.
UCLA's top runner, Neil
Sybert, managed to stick with the
top three Indian runners for most
of the race, but could finish no
better than fourth. Duncan
Macdonald, primarily a middle
distance man, turned in a great
performance over the grueling 5 .7
mile course and missed the course
record by only one second in
finishing fifth.
Kretz came in with a time of
29:52 , bettering the old course
record of 30 :17 . Kardong and Coe
also obliterated the old mark by
finishing second and third with
times of 29:59 and 30:06.
Macdonald came on very strong at
the end of the race and finished
only three seconds behind Sybert.
Depth
Stanford's characteristic lack
of depth was again displayed in
the UCLA meet as four Bruins
finished in a cluster behind
Macdonald. Bernie Lahde, running
with painful leg injuries, finished
in tenth place to round out the
scoring for the Indians.
Rick Geisler and Brian
Mittelstaedt placed 1 3 th and 15 th
for the Cards and freshmen Peter
Fitzmaurice and Neil Bernstein
ended the race in 14th and 16th
positions.
At the halfway point in the
race, Coe, Kretz, and Kardong
were running out in front with
Sybert. Using teamwork and
psychology, the Indians
demoralized Sybert, who had no
help from any of his teammates.
Captain Don Kardong gave
credit for Stanford's win to
Duncan Macdonald, though.
"Duncan ran a fantastic race in
holding off those four UCLA

runners bunched behind him and
at the same time managed to
pressure Sybert."
Stanford was not expected to
defeat the Bruins by such a wide
margin and the UCLA coach even
expressed confidence before the
meet. "I feel that the top five
runners on this year's team are as
good as any top five I have had in
the past," claimed Coach Jim
Bush.
Even in defeat, the UCLA
coach would not fault his runners.
"All our boys improved their
times in this meet and one broke
our course record (Sybert). Yet,
we still were beaten in every way
possible."
Stanford turned in its finest

performance of the year in
trouncing a strong Bruin squad.
Each team member attributed the
win to the fine coaching of
Marshall Clark and the strong
team effort that they themselves
produced.
With wins over both USC and
UCLA, the cross country team
will be in a commanding position
at the Pac-8 meet in Spokane,
Washington on November 14.
Oregon is the perennial favorite
and should dominate the contest
this year, but the Indians have
