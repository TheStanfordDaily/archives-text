# Swimmers Open Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity women's
swim team opens its season
tomorrow against Chico State in
what Coach Marianna Fowler
predicts will be "a doozey of a
meet."
The 2 6-member Indian team
plunges into its first of four meets
at 4 p.m. bolstered with
enthusiasm and experience.
"One girl has cut down her
freestyle time by five seconds,"
Coach Fowler said.
"It'll be a good season,"
according to captain Clydia
Cuykendall. "We've lost several
strong swimmers, but we've
gained just as many. I'm looking
forward to it."
What she's looking forward to
are meets with San Jose State,
Santa Clara and Sacramento State,
all powerhouses in national
women's swimming.
Chico State, which brings a
16-woman contingent to the
women's pool tomorrow, placed
second behind San Jose State in
last week's Northern California
Women's Intercollegiate Council
Relays held at Humboldt.
Stanford was defending
co-champion with San Jose State,
but tight finances kept the Indians
from attempting to defend their
title.

Big meet for the team will be
the NCWIC championships Dec. 5
at the International Swim Center
in Santa Clara.
Stanford has 18 new swimmers
this year including several who
have been ranked nationally.
Returning 1969 varsity
swimmers include Sheila Zelinger,
Jill Spaulding, Kimberly
(Patterson) Baker, Jennie Lendl
and Cuykendall.
There is no admission charge to
the meet. Events scheduled are
25 , 50 and 100 yard freestyle,
backstroke, butterfly and
breaststroke; 100 and 200 yard
medley relays; 100 individual
medley; and 100 and 200
freestyle relays.
