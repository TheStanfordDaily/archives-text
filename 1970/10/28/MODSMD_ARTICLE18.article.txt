# Tribe Climbs To Sixth
## 
### 
Stanford's Pac-8-leading
football team advanced to sixth
place in both national polls
released yesterday, highest
once-beaten team in the country.
Last week the Indians were
eighth in both Associated and
United Press polls.
Stanford climbed past
unbeaten Air Force, which is
ranked seventh, and Auburn,
which fell to 12 th after its first
loss.
All five teams ahead of the
Tribe are unbeaten. The AP put
Texas first and Ohio State second
while the UPI switched those two
around. Both polls listed Notre
Dame, Nebraska, Michigan and
Stanford third, fourth, fifth and
sixth, respectively.
Other Pac-8 teams in the top
2 0 are Oregon, which came out
1 6th in the AP tally and tied with
Yale for 15 th in the UPI
calculations; and ICLA, which
was listed 19 th by the AP and
ignored by the UPI.
Despite being the only
undefeated team in conference
play, Stanford showed up second
in total offense, total defense,
passing offense and rushing
defense in statistics released by
the Pac-8.
Jim Still Leads
Jim Plunkett maintained his
domination of Pac-8 total offense
and passing totals with 1939 total
yards—an average of 277 per
game and 1 775 passing yards.

His .5 31 completion rate trails
Washington's Sonny Sixkiller who
leads with a .538 mark and USC's
Jimmy Jones who is second at
.537.
In other individual categories,
Stanford place kicker Steve
Horowitz moved into second
place in scoring with 41 points on
2 0 PATs and seven field goals.
Oregon's Bobby Moore leads the
league with 60 points.
Jackie Brown and Hillary
Shockley are in a three-way tie for
fifth in scoring with 3 6.
Brown has also advanced to
sixth in rushing with 510 yards.
Clarence Davis, USC, Dave
Schilling, OSU, and Bobby Moore,
Oregon, are in a close race for first
with 637, 634 and 633 yards,
respectively.
Randy Vataha is fourth in
Pac-8 pass receiving with 3 2
receptions for 561 yards and
Jackie Brown is 12th with 22
catches for 253 yards.
Eric Cross is tied for second in
punt returns with an average
return of 11.6 yards in 1 9 returns.
Beavers Second
In looking to Saturday's home
game with Oregon State, Stanford
fans might be interested to know
the Beavers are second in the
league in pass defense, giving up
only 177 yards per game in the
air.
The Beavers are also second in
rushing offense, lid primarily by

Schilling who is averaging 9 0.6
yards per game.
The Indians started preparation
for the Beavers with a light
workout Monday, a heavy drill
Tuesday and another full-speed
session set for today.
For the first time in a number
of weeks, Stanford's injured list is
down to one Demea Washington
still bothered by a hamstring pull
that kept him from suiting up for
UCLA. Coach John Rolston called
him "doubtful" for Saturday's
game.

with 637, 634 and 633 yards,
respectively.
Randy Vataha is fourth in
Pac-8 pass receiving with 3 2
receptions for 561 yards and
Jackie Brown is 12th with 22
catches for 253 yards.
Eric Cross is tied for second in
punt returns with an average

Beavers Second
In looking to Saturday's home
game with Oregon State, Stanford
fans might be interested to know
the Beavers are second in the
league in pass defense, giving up
only 177 yards per game in the
air.
The Beavers are also second in
rushing offense, lid primarily by

Schilling who is averaging 9 0.6
yards per game.
The Indians started preparation
for the Beavers with a light
workout Monday, a heavy drill
Tuesday and another full-speed
session set for today.
For the first time in a number
of weeks, Stanford's injured list is
down to one Demea Washington
still bothered by a hamstring pull
that kept him from suiting up for
UCLA. Coach John Rolston called
him "doubtful" for Saturday's
game.
Stanford's Pac-8-leading
football team advanced to sixth
place in both national polls
released yesterday, highest
once-beaten team in the country.
Last week the Indians were
eighth in both Associated and
United Press polls.
Stanford climbed past
unbeaten Air Force, which is
ranked seventh, and Auburn,
which fell to 12 th after its first
loss.
All five teams ahead of the
Tribe are unbeaten. The AP put
Texas first and Ohio State second
while the UPI switched those two
around. Both polls listed Notre
Dame, Nebraska, Michigan and
Stanford third, fourth, fifth and
sixth, respectively.
Other Pac-8 teams in the top
2 0 are Oregon, which came out
1 6th in the AP tally and tied with
Yale for 15 th in the UPI
calculations; and ICLA, which
was listed 19 th by the AP and
ignored by the UPI.
Despite being the only
undefeated team in conference
play, Stanford showed up second
in total offense, total defense,
passing offense and rushing
defense in statistics released by
the Pac-8.
