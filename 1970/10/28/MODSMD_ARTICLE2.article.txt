# President In San Jose Tomorrow; Demonstration Planned For Arrival
## 
### NICHOLAS DUNGAN 
President Nixon will speak in San
Jose tomorrow evening, for his
Republican colleagues George Murphy
and Ronald Reagan.
The President is on a whirlwind tour
of 10 states, trying at the last minute to
gain votes and Senate seats.
He will speak at Civic Auditorium,
which holds nearly 3000 people;
outside, demonstrators representing at
least three factions are expected.
Radio station KLIV in San Jose
reported last night that the San Jose
Police Department had denied a request
for a parade permit by the
demonstrators, but added that the
demonstrators planned to march
anyway. The Chief of Police, Ross
Donald, was not available for comment.
Violence and disruption are being
thoroughly discouraged by certain
groups of the demonstrators, but
unofficial sources have predicted

disorders, especially in light of the
permit denial.
'Riot'
Protester Jane Franklin, of the Bay
Area Revolutionary Union, told the
Daily yesterday, "a riot will begin at
5:30 at 7th and San Carlos Streets in
San Jose."
The San Jose Liberation Front, and
other radical groups from San Jose State
College anrt c*«-.fv,rd, will also be on
hand to aemonstrate against the
President.
Hard Hats
Representatives of "Middle
America"—hard hats, housewives,
building trades workers, auto workers,
and engineers—also plan to protest
against unemployment and inflation.
Stuart McLean's headquarters in
Sunnyvale has organized a "Cool-It
Squad," which will be present at the
demonstration, distributing leaflets and

trying to discourage demonstrators
from heckling or disrupting the
President's remarks.
"We will try to convince young
people that heckling and disruption are
only giving Mr. Nixon an excuse to
duck the critical issues . . . and allow
him to play the politics of fear,"
McLean said.

San Jose students plan to join
McLean workers in decrying disruption.
A spokesman from McLean
headquarters said that the
demonstration was expected to be
orderly and peaceful. The
demonstrators are determined not to be
used as stooges, as others have been
before, a McLean spokesman said.
The President's breakneck tour
brings him through 10 states in about half
as many days. He is campaigning in
Florida, Texas, Illinois, Minnesota,

Nebraska, and California. After he
leaves San Jose, he will head south and
speak on Friday night to a huge rally in
Anaheim. On Saturday he will tour
Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and
Utah.
All of the states in which Mr. Nixon
is appearing have Senate races, except
Nebraska, and all but Utah and Illinois
have gubernatorial races. Republican
optimism may be traced to the
knowledge that 25 of the 35 open
Senate seats are Democrat seats, and
some of the races are thought to be
very close.

All of the states in which Mr. Nixon
is appearing have Senate races, except
Nebraska, and all but Utah and Illinois
have gubernatorial races. Republican
optimism may be traced to the
knowledge that 25 of the 35 open
Senate seats are Democrat seats, and
some of the races are thought to be
very close.
President Nixon will speak in San
Jose tomorrow evening, for his
Republican colleagues George Murphy
and Ronald Reagan.
The President is on a whirlwind tour
of 10 states, trying at the last minute to
gain votes and Senate seats.
He will speak at Civic Auditorium,
which holds nearly 3000 people;
outside, demonstrators representing at
least three factions are expected.
Radio station KLIV in San Jose
reported last night that the San Jose
Police Department had denied a request
for a parade permit by the
demonstrators, but added that the
demonstrators planned to march
anyway. The Chief of Police, Ross
Donald, was not available for comment.
Violence and disruption are being
thoroughly discouraged by certain
groups of the demonstrators, but
unofficial sources have predicted

disorders, especially in light of the
permit denial.
'Riot'
Protester Jane Franklin, of the Bay
Area Revolutionary Union, told the
Daily yesterday, "a riot will begin at
5:30 at 7th and San Carlos Streets in
San Jose."
The San Jose Liberation Front, and
other radical groups from San Jose State
College anrt c*«-.fv,rd, will also be on
hand to aemonstrate against the
President.
Hard Hats
Representatives of "Middle
America"—hard hats, housewives,
building trades workers, auto workers,
and engineers—also plan to protest
against unemployment and inflation.
Stuart McLean's headquarters in
Sunnyvale has organized a "Cool-It
Squad," which will be present at the
demonstration, distributing leaflets and

trying to discourage demonstrators
from heckling or disrupting the
President's remarks.
"We will try to convince young
people that heckling and disruption are
only giving Mr. Nixon an excuse to
duck the critical issues . . . and allow
him to play the politics of fear,"
McLean said.

VACANT BEDS—Even though this mattress has an occupant, the University finds itself without enough students to fill its
sleeping facilities.
San Jose students plan to join
McLean workers in decrying disruption.
A spokesman from McLean
headquarters said that the
demonstration was expected to be
orderly and peaceful. The
demonstrators are determined not to be
used as stooges, as others have been
before, a McLean spokesman said.
The President's breakneck tour
brings him through 10 states in about half
as many days. He is campaigning in
Florida, Texas, Illinois, Minnesota,

Nebraska, and California. After he
leaves San Jose, he will head south and
speak on Friday night to a huge rally in
Anaheim. On Saturday he will tour
Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and
Utah.
