Abortion Rules Set
LOS ANGELES — California Court of Appeal has ruled
that unmarried pregnant girls under 21 and still under
parents' control must have parental consent for a
therapeutic abortion.
The court rules on a petition by Alan Charles, a lawyer
for the National Program on Health Problems of the Poor.
Charles said conflicting laws on parental consent are
causing increasing problems at hospitals that perform
abortions.
The petition was filed on behalf of a pregnant, indigent,
unmarried 20-year-old with one child.
A doctor at the Los Angeles County-University of
Southern California Medical Center certified the woman
for an abortion—permitted in cases of rape or incest or
where the mental or physical health of the mother may be
injured. But the hospital's abortion committee refused the
abortion because the woman lived with her mother and
didn't have her mother's permission.
Spokesmen for the hospital say they turn away about
six such women a week.
A Harbor General Hospital official filed an affidavit
with Charles' petition saying minors without consent are
turned away on the advice of the county counsel. But,
added Dr. John Marshall, chairman of the obstetrics and
gynecology department: "It is my opinion that many of
these girls have and will in the future turn to self-induced
or unprofessionally performed criminal abortion outside of
the hospital."
Indians Fight Feds
BURNEY, Calif. — Indians fought federal marshals and
Shasta County sheriff's deputies with pine clubs and
two-by-four Tuesday as the federal officers dismantled a
50-foot quonset hut the Indians had built on federal
property.
Shasta County Sheriff John Balma said 2 4 persons were
arrested, including two juveniles, Pit River Indian tribal
Chairman Mickey Gemmill and John Hurst, a reporter for
the Redding Record-Searchlight.
Balma said one Indian, Gordon Montgomery, was
injured and taken to Fall River Hospital by ambulance.
"He hit one of my deputies over the head with a pine club
and the officer in turn struck him," Balma said.
The Indians had rejected a demand by the federal
government that they evaculate a two-acre portion of
Shasta-Trinity National Forest near here. They vowed to
fight to preserve the quonset hut they had erected on it. The

tribe claims it owns the land, about 200 miles north of San
Francisco, and that it was taken illegally during the 18 49
Gold Rush.
Unemployment Grows
WASHINGTON — House Speaker John W. McCormack,
D-Mass., said Tuesday the governmen has added five major
labor markets to its list of areas with substantial
unemployment of 6 percent or more.
The Labor Department confirmed the report, but
denied McCormack's charge that the Nixon administration
had planned to hold up official announcement until after
the Nov. 3 elections.
The report adds Los Angeles-Long Beach, San Diego,
and the San Bernardino-Riverside-Ontario areas of
California, New Brunswick-Perth Amboy in New Jersey
and Lawrence-Haverhill, Mass., to the list. It also adds 13
smaller labor market areas.
The list of major areas of substantial unemployment
now totals 38 , highest in more than six years.
Oil Companies Lobby
SACRAMENTO — Four major oil companies have
contributed $100 ,00 0— more than half the total collected
so far—to the campaign to defeat a ballot measure to allow
the use of highway construction money to fight
auto-caused smog.
A statement filed Tuesday with Secretary of State H.P.
Sullivan by a group known as "Califomians Against the
Street and Road Tax Trap" showed contributions totaling
$167,210. It listed a total expenditure of $200,243.48
Four major oil companies—Texaco, Union, Shew and
Standard of California—were listed as giving a total of
$1 00,000 to the campaign against Prop. 18 .
Supporters of the constitutional amendment filed their
statement last week listing contributions totaling $6,45 7.
Assemblyman William Bagley, one of the leaders in the
drive, predicted at the time that opponents would spend
more than $1 million to defeat the measure.
If approved Nov. 3, the proposition would allow voters
in cities and counties to decide whether to use part of their
share of highway user taxes—now dedicated to highway
construction—for such things as mass transit systems and
clearing up smog problems caused bv automobiles.

Oil Companies Lobby
SACRAMENTO — Four major oil companies have
contributed $100 ,00 0— more than half the total collected
so far—to the campaign to defeat a ballot measure to allow
the use of highway construction money to fight
auto-caused smog.
A statement filed Tuesday with Secretary of State H.P.
Sullivan by a group known as "Califomians Against the
Street and Road Tax Trap" showed contributions totaling
$167,210. It listed a total expenditure of $200,243.48
Four major oil companies—Texaco, Union, Shew and
Standard of California—were listed as giving a total of
$1 00,000 to the campaign against Prop. 18 .
Supporters of the constitutional amendment filed their
statement last week listing contributions totaling $6,45 7.
Assemblyman William Bagley, one of the leaders in the
drive, predicted at the time that opponents would spend
more than $1 million to defeat the measure.
If approved Nov. 3, the proposition would allow voters
in cities and counties to decide whether to use part of their
share of highway user taxes—now dedicated to highway
construction—for such things as mass transit systems and
clearing up smog problems caused bv automobiles.
Abortion Rules Set
LOS ANGELES — California Court of Appeal has ruled
that unmarried pregnant girls under 21 and still under
parents' control must have parental consent for a
therapeutic abortion.
The court rules on a petition by Alan Charles, a lawyer
for the National Program on Health Problems of the Poor.
Charles said conflicting laws on parental consent are
causing increasing problems at hospitals that perform
abortions.
The petition was filed on behalf of a pregnant, indigent,
unmarried 20-year-old with one child.
A doctor at the Los Angeles County-University of
Southern California Medical Center certified the woman
for an abortion—permitted in cases of rape or incest or
where the mental or physical health of the mother may be
injured. But the hospital's abortion committee refused the
abortion because the woman lived with her mother and
didn't have her mother's permission.
Spokesmen for the hospital say they turn away about
six such women a week.
A Harbor General Hospital official filed an affidavit
with Charles' petition saying minors without consent are
turned away on the advice of the county counsel. But,
added Dr. John Marshall, chairman of the obstetrics and
gynecology department: "It is my opinion that many of
these girls have and will in the future turn to self-induced
or unprofessionally performed criminal abortion outside of
the hospital."
Indians Fight Feds
BURNEY, Calif. — Indians fought federal marshals and
Shasta County sheriff's deputies with pine clubs and
two-by-four Tuesday as the federal officers dismantled a
50-foot quonset hut the Indians had built on federal
property.
Shasta County Sheriff John Balma said 2 4 persons were
arrested, including two juveniles, Pit River Indian tribal
Chairman Mickey Gemmill and John Hurst, a reporter for
the Redding Record-Searchlight.
Balma said one Indian, Gordon Montgomery, was
injured and taken to Fall River Hospital by ambulance.
"He hit one of my deputies over the head with a pine club
and the officer in turn struck him," Balma said.
The Indians had rejected a demand by the federal
government that they evaculate a two-acre portion of
Shasta-Trinity National Forest near here. They vowed to
fight to preserve the quonset hut they had erected on it. The

tribe claims it owns the land, about 200 miles north of San
Francisco, and that it was taken illegally during the 18 49
Gold Rush.
