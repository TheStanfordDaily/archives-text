Today at 12:45, engineering
students may talk to Lockheed
representatives at the Placement
Center.
Considerable controversy has arisen
about Lockheed's policies, and a
demand has come from the New Left
Project that Lockheed leave Stanford
land.
Also at 12:45 today, New Left
Project representatives will picket and
distribute leaflets outside the
Placement Center; they are sponsoring
a speaker, an engineer, who will address
the rally.
At 2 :00 p.m., unemployed former
Lockheed engineers will demonstrate at
the Placement Center.
The main issues of controversy
about Lockheed stem from its Defense
Department contracts, and its firing of
more experienced engineers, while it
recruits students to be trained to take
their places. The NLP handbill
described Lockheed as "the nation's
number one defense contractor in six
out of the last 10 years, and deplored
Lockheed's laying off "37 percent of
its work force in Santa Clara County in
the last two years."
The handbill also criticized
Lockheed's "counterinsurgency work
in Southeast Asia," and demanded "an
end to Stanford's .. . teaching and
research in the technologies intrinsic to
modern warfare."
