# Campus Dorms Unfilled
## 
### DON LINDEMANN 
Almost 5 0 vacancies are scattered
throughout the undergraduate housing
system, despite the stiff competition
for living space last month.
But surplus housing is not the
reason, according to Larry Horton,
Assistant Dean of Students for
Residences. Rather, an ineffective
waiting list procedure has created the
paradoxical situation which Horton
termed "tragic."
He said that some students have held
claim to University housing while
looking for room elsewhere. Thus, they
leave a vacancy on campus when and if
they establish residence off campus.
"Students are harming other
students, and this should be clearly
understood," said Horton. At least one
prospective transfer student ended up
going to another school because of the
housing problem here. "I'm sure there
must be many, many more cases like
this," he said.
New procedures are expected to
streamline the waiting list procedure in
the future. Up to now, notices of
vacancies were sent to students one at a
time according to their positions on the
waiting list. This caused long delays in
cases where the first few students
turned down the offer.
Will Notice
The housing office now plans to
notify all students on the list whenever
a number of vacancies are expected, as
in winter quarter when there is a drain
to overseas campuses. The waiting list
will still be used to determine priorities,
but students will be responsible for
checking in at the housing office on
their own at the designated times.

The housing office expects to fill its
vacancies by winter quarter, averting
the loss of more than $20,000 in board
charges for the year. Room is available
for 28 men and 19 women, so there is
no effective waiting list now.
Nevertheless, said Horton, "If all the
students who wanted it (campus
housing) came to us, I'm sure we'd be
filled up."
High Cost
Many undergraduates have been
forced to accept expensive or
undesirable off-campus living
arrangements because of the initial fall
quarter shortage. When University
housing does become available, the
students are often established elsewhere
and "cannot pull up their stakes," said
Horton.
Thus, the vacancies expected to
develop in winter quarter may remain
unfilled, although the space would have
gone quickly in early fall.
The need for more undergraduate
housing was demonstrated by a survey
made last year by the "Committee for
New Undergraduate Living Ideas." Bill
Leland, Associate Dean of Students,
was chairman of the ad hoc committee.
Move On
Leland explained the survey results.
"Of 1 400 undergraduates living off
campus, about one half would move on
campus if the type of housing they
wanted was available," he said.
Leland's committee submitted its
findings and suggestions for new
housing in a preliminary report to the
President's office in November.
Frederick Glover, Executive Assistant

to the President, was critical of the
report.
"No official action was takne," he
said. "The plans were so elaborate that
they weren't at all feasible. In fact, I
can tell the President was
quite discouraged."
Four Miles
The housing committee plans to
submit a final report in the near future,
according to Leland. He indicated that
some students are living more than four
miles from campus, making
transportation inconvenient. He also
acknowledged that some may have
been forced to live in substandard
housing.
Dr. Albert Gelpi, Associate Professor
of English and a member of the
committee, questioned whether the
University can really be described as a
"resident campus" when so many are
unable to be housed on it.
Originally, Manzanita Trailer Park
was conceived as temporary housing, to
be replaced by a dormitory complex in
1 9 74. It was thought that the trailers,
with room for 468 undergraduates,
would pay for itself by that time.
However, use of the park has not
been up to expectations. According to
Horton, "They were assuming
year-round occupancy by a full
complement of people." A number of
the trailers have vacancies, and they are
not used in summer. Horton said he
knew of no plans to replace them by or
near the original deadline.
Some trailer occupants have
expressed discontent about the
sameness of the 117 units. There have
also been complaints about shoddy
workmanship and thin interior walls.

and "cannot pull up their stakes," said
Horton.
Thus, the vacancies expected to
develop in winter quarter may remain
unfilled, although the space would have
gone quickly in early fall.
The need for more undergraduate
housing was demonstrated by a survey
made last year by the "Committee for
New Undergraduate Living Ideas." Bill
Leland, Associate Dean of Students,
was chairman of the ad hoc committee.
Move On
Leland explained the survey results.
"Of 1 400 undergraduates living off
campus, about one half would move on
campus if the type of housing they
wanted was available," he said.
Leland's committee submitted its
findings and suggestions for new
housing in a preliminary report to the
President's office in November.
Frederick Glover, Executive Assistant

to the President, was critical of the
report.
"No official action was takne," he
said. "The plans were so elaborate that
they weren't at all feasible. In fact, I
can tell the President was
quite discouraged."
Four Miles
The housing committee plans to
submit a final report in the near future,
according to Leland. He indicated that
some students are living more than four
miles from campus, making
transportation inconvenient. He also
acknowledged that some may have
been forced to live in substandard
housing.
Dr. Albert Gelpi, Associate Professor
of English and a member of the
committee, questioned whether the
University can really be described as a
"resident campus" when so many are
unable to be housed on it.
Originally, Manzanita Trailer Park
was conceived as temporary housing, to
be replaced by a dormitory complex in
1 9 74. It was thought that the trailers,
with room for 468 undergraduates,
would pay for itself by that time.
However, use of the park has not
been up to expectations. According to
Horton, "They were assuming
year-round occupancy by a full
complement of people." A number of
the trailers have vacancies, and they are
not used in summer. Horton said he
knew of no plans to replace them by or
near the original deadline.
Some trailer occupants have
expressed discontent about the
sameness of the 117 units. There have
also been complaints about shoddy
workmanship and thin interior walls.
Almost 5 0 vacancies are scattered
throughout the undergraduate housing
system, despite the stiff competition
for living space last month.
But surplus housing is not the
reason, according to Larry Horton,
Assistant Dean of Students for
Residences. Rather, an ineffective
waiting list procedure has created the
paradoxical situation which Horton
termed "tragic."
He said that some students have held
claim to University housing while
looking for room elsewhere. Thus, they
leave a vacancy on campus when and if
they establish residence off campus.
"Students are harming other
students, and this should be clearly
understood," said Horton. At least one
prospective transfer student ended up
going to another school because of the
housing problem here. "I'm sure there
must be many, many more cases like
this," he said.
New procedures are expected to
streamline the waiting list procedure in
the future. Up to now, notices of
vacancies were sent to students one at a
time according to their positions on the
waiting list. This caused long delays in
cases where the first few students
turned down the offer.
Will Notice
The housing office now plans to
notify all students on the list whenever
a number of vacancies are expected, as
in winter quarter when there is a drain
to overseas campuses. The waiting list
will still be used to determine priorities,
but students will be responsible for
checking in at the housing office on
their own at the designated times.

The housing office expects to fill its
vacancies by winter quarter, averting
the loss of more than $20,000 in board
charges for the year. Room is available
for 28 men and 19 women, so there is
no effective waiting list now.
Nevertheless, said Horton, "If all the
students who wanted it (campus
housing) came to us, I'm sure we'd be
filled up."
High Cost
Many undergraduates have been
forced to accept expensive or
undesirable off-campus living
arrangements because of the initial fall
quarter shortage. When University
housing does become available, the
students are often established elsewhere
and "cannot pull up their stakes," said
Horton.
Thus, the vacancies expected to
develop in winter quarter may remain
unfilled, although the space would have
gone quickly in early fall.
