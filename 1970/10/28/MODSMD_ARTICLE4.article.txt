# Students Ignoring Fall Election Work
## 
### MIKE GRUNDY 
According to student campaign
coordinators only about 150 students,
less than two percent of the student
body are active in this year's elections.
Coordinator for the Stuart McLean
campaign, Bill .Jordan says, "A student
can do a lot for a candidate; we need
them desperately. Maybe they will feel
guilty about taking a vacation (this
weekend) instead of becoming
politically involved."
Tunney and Riles
Along with Stu McLean, students on
campus are supporting Wilson Riles for
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction and John Tunney, for U.S.
Senate. Approximately 20 students are
working for Ronald Reagan, Charles
Gubser, and Jess Unruh.
The student response at the
Stanford Community Forum has been
labelled "extremely disappointing" by
John Grube. Grube, a member of the
Student Committee for Involvement in
Politics (SCIP), said, "The attendance
at the Forum hosting Paul McCloskey
and Robert Gompers was very poor."

When asked the cause for the decline
of student response from last year,
John Grube said, "for the last five years
students have been relatively inactive
during the fall quarter, and this year
will probably be no exception. A
number of a political groups on campus
have sponsored many interesting
programs and have also experienced a
high level of student apathy."
Princeton Plan
"Serious student involvement
requires a personal commitment, and
not just an institutional program such
as the Princeton Plan," New concluded.
Bob Grant, a member of the Council
of Presidents and chairman of SCIP,
suggested that "students are
experiencing psychological
exhaustion." "It is the same all over the
country. It's not apathy nor alienation,
but something close to hopelessness
about being effective in the political
system," Grant said.
Grant, is still hopeful that students
will turn out on election day."It would
take only two hundred students to
make a big effect." Reflecting on the
low attendance at the Stanford

Community Forums, Grant said, "the
campus has been flat. There has been
little involvement in anything."
Crucial
Among the organizers and workers
in the campaigns, it is generally agreed
that student involvement will be crucial
in the results of next week's elections.
If five percent of the student body help
in any way, the effects will be
politically significant in the opinion of
many of the campaign organizers.
Whether students get rid of their
psychological hangover from last spring
remains to be seen. "There are many
possible explanations. Some students
are just burned out from last spring.
Others have lost all interest. This is
typical of student activity. They cannot
sustain interest."
Grube suggested other possible
explanations. "The success of the
football team has diverted the attention
of some students from other activities.
Also the large number of organizations
on campus forces the student to decide
which one he is interested in, and many
students find it easier not to choose at
all."

(Jrube warned that if this election
holiday turns out to be purely
recreational, the students' image will
suffer. "At a time when many people
are critically examining universities and
college students, lack of student
involvement this weekend will only cast
doubt on the credibility of college
students."
No Glamour
"Student involvement in politics this
weekend will be more demanding, more
difficult, and less glamorous that the
confrontation involvement of last
spring, but this weekend's results will
be more productive and enduring," He
noted.
Frank Newman, Associate Director
of University Relations, said, "No one
understands this year's high level of
student indifference in politics." "The
elections come at a time when everyone
is getting started again in school. The
sense of group dynamics and
community involvement that was
present last spring has disappeared.
There just isn't another "Cambodia" to
focus the community's interest."
