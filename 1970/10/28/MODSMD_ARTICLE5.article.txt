## Learning From History 
### 
James mcclelland

How wonderful it is to be on a
university campus where
enlightening commentary flows
freely in all directions. How
wonderful - and yet, at times, how
disconcerting. Take, for example,
the amiable and esteemed
professor of Human Biology, who
in a recent Daily interview was
kind enough to bestow upon us
the remark, "We don't seem to
learn much by history, do we?"
The profound incisiveness of
this statement struck me like a
thunderbolt .and plunged me into
the deepest despair. For how can
it be denied that historical
knowledge is of no value whatever
in solving the major problems of
today? Indeed, even in more
mundane matters its value is at
best questionable. For example,
all my knowledge of history was
of limited assistance last weekend
as I was trying to fix a flat tire on
my bicycle.
The agony of having chosen a
useless profession bore heavily on
my shoulders as I trudged off to
the history stacks in the library.
Imagine my astonishment when
upon my arrival 1 discovered all
the seats occupied by earnest
young revolutionaries, eagerly
devouring every history book
within reach. It was then that I
received my second revelation:
Some people do learn from
history! The revolutionaries in our
midst are perfect examples.
Consider, I ask you, the following
revolutionary propositions:
A. Violent acts are necessary to
expose the latent fascism in our
society, and render it explicit, for
all to see.

Mature reflection will reveal
not only the truth of that
statement, but also will establish
that only a careful student of
history could have formulated
such a breathtaking insight. For
don't historians record the great
success of revolutionary
violence in exposing, and rendering
explicit for all to see, the latent
fascism in Spain, Nazi Germany,
and present day Greece?
B. The fascist response of the
authorities will generate a new
revolutionary wave that will
sweep the reactionaries out of
power.
Again, only a student of
history can appreciate the true
profundity of this statement. For
he knows that Hitler's regime
lasted only twelve years,
Mussolini's a mere twenty-one.
And who would dare to predict
that the repressive regimes in
Spain and Greece will not be
overthrown within the next
hundred years — a mere instant of
time in the evolutionary process
of history.
C. The peoples of the Third
World will rise in unison against
their imperialist oppressors.
This inspired statement is
reminiscent of the prophetic
utterance made in 18 48 by two
famous students of history:
"National differences and
antagonisms between peoples are
daily more and more vanishing,
owing to the development of the
bourgeoisie . . . the supremacy of
the proletariat will cause them to
vanish still faster." Just as the
history of the past 125 years has

demonstrated beyond doubt the
brilliant validity of this statement
with regards to the First and
Second Worlds, so we can be sure
of witnessing in the next decades
a similar substitution of
harmonious cooperation for
national rivalries within the Third
World.
No, my esteemed professor of
Human Biology, 1 am relieved to
conclude that you are quite
wrong. Some people do learn
from history. And if historical
knowledge can facilitate in any
way the coming of the
Revolution, need there by any
further justification for its study?

Imagine my astonishment when
upon my arrival 1 discovered all
the seats occupied by earnest
young revolutionaries, eagerly
devouring every history book
within reach. It was then that I
received my second revelation:
Some people do learn from
history! The revolutionaries in our
midst are perfect examples.
Consider, I ask you, the following
revolutionary propositions:
A. Violent acts are necessary to
expose the latent fascism in our
society, and render it explicit, for
all to see.

Mature reflection will reveal
not only the truth of that
statement, but also will establish
that only a careful student of
history could have formulated
such a breathtaking insight. For
don't historians record the great
success of revolutionary
violence in exposing, and rendering
explicit for all to see, the latent
fascism in Spain, Nazi Germany,
and present day Greece?
B. The fascist response of the
authorities will generate a new
revolutionary wave that will
sweep the reactionaries out of
power.
Again, only a student of
history can appreciate the true
profundity of this statement. For
he knows that Hitler's regime
lasted only twelve years,
Mussolini's a mere twenty-one.
And who would dare to predict
that the repressive regimes in
Spain and Greece will not be
overthrown within the next
hundred years — a mere instant of
time in the evolutionary process
of history.
C. The peoples of the Third
World will rise in unison against
their imperialist oppressors.
This inspired statement is
reminiscent of the prophetic
utterance made in 18 48 by two
famous students of history:
"National differences and
antagonisms between peoples are
daily more and more vanishing,
owing to the development of the
bourgeoisie . . . the supremacy of
the proletariat will cause them to
vanish still faster." Just as the
history of the past 125 years has

demonstrated beyond doubt the
brilliant validity of this statement
with regards to the First and
Second Worlds, so we can be sure
of witnessing in the next decades
a similar substitution of
harmonious cooperation for
national rivalries within the Third
World.
No, my esteemed professor of
Human Biology, 1 am relieved to
conclude that you are quite
wrong. Some people do learn
from history. And if historical
knowledge can facilitate in any
way the coming of the
Revolution, need there by any
further justification for its study?

How wonderful it is to be on a
university campus where
enlightening commentary flows
freely in all directions. How
wonderful - and yet, at times, how
disconcerting. Take, for example,
the amiable and esteemed
professor of Human Biology, who
in a recent Daily interview was
kind enough to bestow upon us
the remark, "We don't seem to
learn much by history, do we?"
The profound incisiveness of
this statement struck me like a
thunderbolt .and plunged me into
the deepest despair. For how can
it be denied that historical
knowledge is of no value whatever
in solving the major problems of
today? Indeed, even in more
mundane matters its value is at
best questionable. For example,
all my knowledge of history was
of limited assistance last weekend
as I was trying to fix a flat tire on
my bicycle.
The agony of having chosen a
useless profession bore heavily on
my shoulders as I trudged off to
the history stacks in the library.
