# violence a diversion
## Radicals Misjudge Power 
### 
d.j.r. Bruckner

If there were no Weatherman, no guerrilla,
would government find it necessary to invent
some? In fact, these people may not be responsible
for all the bombings. It is easy for anyone to claim
credit in the name of someone else. But the
diversion of violence serves many purposes; one
wonders if the people or the radicals have any
notion of the necessity of irrelevance to modern
politics.
Revolutions properly are radical shifts in power
and the aggregations of power. There is a big one
going on in this society, but the crazies have
nothing to do with it.
- The automobile, the vehicle of personal
independence, allows the American to run all over
the continent at will. But it has bred worldwide
industries of almost uncontrollable power: auto,
construction, oil, for instance. Spending on
highways is fantastic, most of it federal; the
vehicle of personal independence has immensely
broadened thy power of central government and it
has almost wiped out local government as an
instrument of real political decisions.
- Former Nazi official Albert Speer says Adolf
Hitler used communications, mostly telephone and
radio, to wipe out the middle level of command,
to give central government direct authority over
individuals. Communications are much improved
since then. And, in an age of superweapons, a ruler
does not have to worry about the loyalties of as
many people as he once did; big weapons are easy
to employ and the people do not have to be
bothered quite so much.
- Radio and television bring the world home.
But they turn consumer research and advertising
into political movements. A man with, say, 30
million dollars at hand, can use them to be elected
president; and, once in office, he can use them to
overwhelm opposition and preach doctrine
unrestrained. On fast planes he can fly
bouncing his homebound messages off the heads
of foreign rulers. The entire electronic
communications system comes under control of
men he has the power to appoint.
Computers, still almost untried wonders, really
should be able to revolutionize daily life, to bring
in the age of creativity and abundance. They also
give government, and some huge businesses,
control over intelligence data of all types,
information about individuals, immediate,
unforgetful, untempered by any feeling.
—Basic research gives us all this wealth, and
education has the power of freedom. But, within a

couple of decades, the major funding of research
and education has shifted to one
source-Washington; the power of control is
immeasurable. Many technological developments
which change our lives forever are researched and
developed by government-funded technocrats who
are personally committed to their success.
-New technologies, travel systems and
monetary systems greatly increase the muscle of
organized crime. The administration refuses to
mention the Mafia now, but Mafiosi and their
allies can operate over political boundaries more
easily every day.
- Rapid development in bugging, wiretapping,
photographing and surveillance devices of other
types allows governments to conduct foreign
affairs mostly through intelligence operations.
They also give governments in-depth control of
citizens. This month Atty. Gen. John Mitchell
himself was boasting of the success his office has
had in bugging and tapping suspects (there is a
large group of people he claims the right to intrude
on whom he refuses to enumerate at all),
encouraging local police to use these devices and
sneering at "absolute civil libertarians." When
there was a dispute about the size of the crowds at
last year's Moratorium Day in Washington, the
Defense Department released an uncomfortably
clear aerial photograph of that crowd.
The government has tea-tasters at work. And
more. Increasingly, everything consumable by
man, and a lot of beasts—agricultural products,
food, drugs, drink—is controlled by government in
quantity, quality, manufacture, packaging, supply,
distribution.
Such megasystems are not vulnerable to a few
bombs. Weatherman is important to the
maintenance of power much in the way the
illusion of traditional party politics is, or
traditional patriotism; they distract, and do not
interefere with the power. Sometimes they allow
government to increase its power of surveillance,
control, arrest.
Manifestly the political system is not a control
mechanism over the real revolution in everyday
life. Whether it can be rebuilt into such a system
of control is the overriding problem of the times.
Technological change seems more palatable to
many than political change, however. Ironically,
Weatherman and his like are parts of the power
system.

control over intelligence data of all types,
information about individuals, immediate,
unforgetful, untempered by any feeling.
—Basic research gives us all this wealth, and
education has the power of freedom. But, within a

couple of decades, the major funding of research
and education has shifted to one
source-Washington; the power of control is
immeasurable. Many technological developments
which change our lives forever are researched and
developed by government-funded technocrats who
are personally committed to their success.
-New technologies, travel systems and
monetary systems greatly increase the muscle of
organized crime. The administration refuses to
mention the Mafia now, but Mafiosi and their
allies can operate over political boundaries more
easily every day.
- Rapid development in bugging, wiretapping,
photographing and surveillance devices of other
types allows governments to conduct foreign
affairs mostly through intelligence operations.
They also give governments in-depth control of
citizens. This month Atty. Gen. John Mitchell
himself was boasting of the success his office has
had in bugging and tapping suspects (there is a
large group of people he claims the right to intrude
on whom he refuses to enumerate at all),
encouraging local police to use these devices and
sneering at "absolute civil libertarians." When
there was a dispute about the size of the crowds at
last year's Moratorium Day in Washington, the
Defense Department released an uncomfortably
clear aerial photograph of that crowd.
The government has tea-tasters at work. And
more. Increasingly, everything consumable by
man, and a lot of beasts—agricultural products,
food, drugs, drink—is controlled by government in
quantity, quality, manufacture, packaging, supply,
distribution.
Such megasystems are not vulnerable to a few
bombs. Weatherman is important to the
maintenance of power much in the way the
illusion of traditional party politics is, or
traditional patriotism; they distract, and do not
interefere with the power. Sometimes they allow
government to increase its power of surveillance,
control, arrest.
Manifestly the political system is not a control
mechanism over the real revolution in everyday
life. Whether it can be rebuilt into such a system
of control is the overriding problem of the times.
Technological change seems more palatable to
many than political change, however. Ironically,
Weatherman and his like are parts of the power
system.
