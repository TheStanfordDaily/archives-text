The New Left Project invites
members of the Stanford and
mid-peninsula communities to
join us in a campaign to take
Stanford and local industry out of
war production and research and
development for war,
counterinsurgency, and the
maintenance of U.S. colonial
domination throughout the world.
We know that the University
engages in a large number of
programs for the Department of
Defense, including war research
and ROTC.
We know that Stanford, by
providing the brainpower
through training, consulting, and
research -for the local industrial
complex, is the heart of that
complex.
We know that, as presently
constituted, social sciences,
international programs, and

business studies are an integral
part of U.S. foreign policy.
We know that SRI and local
industry (Lockheed, H-P, Varian,
etc.) have played significant roles
in the development of technology
for modern wars of
counterinsurgency, as well as for
"strategic warfare" (Poseidon,
AMB, etc.).
We know that war production,
as well as research and
development, is carried out in this
area.
We know that SRI has helped
plan the U.S. corporate
domination (with Japan) of the
Pacific Basin.
We consider all these activities,
to the extent that they contribute
to war, Cold War,
counterinsurgency, and imperial
domination, to be crimes against
humanity.
As the first stage of our
campaign we will investigate the
precise nature of research,
development, training, and
production done in this area. We
ask people with knowledge of
such work to participate.

We will present our findings to
institutions and individuals. We
hope that many people engaged in
war work or related activities will
seek more creative ways of using
their skills. We recognize,
however, that the institutional
context (funding, etc.) limits the
extent to which "voluntary"
change will be successful. We are
prepared, therefore, to take
whatever action necessary to
redirect and reconstruct the
resources of our communities.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I was really pleased to see the
article on "Adjusting to Gay Life"
bv "a gay woman" in Monday's
Daily. Glad to see that the Daily
is liberated enough to print
material on Stanford gays, but
even more pleased to see that this
gay woman cared enough about
the problem to bring it to the
attention of Stanford gays and the
Stanford community in general.
Like my gay sister, 1 came out
at Stanford last year. Coming out
anywhere is a real hassle, but the
apparent lack of fraternity among
gays at Stanford makes it even
more so here.
Maybe it's time the gay

community at Stanford got itself
together in a GLF-Stanford or
whatever to give brothers and
sisters at Stanford help with
hassles, and perhaps to organize
gay functions like those on other
campuses.
I and other Stanford gays
would be interested in hearing
from Stanford gays who have
ideas about possible forms such an
organization might take. At this
point, we're entirely open to
suggestions, we'd just like to get
some response to the idea from
gays on campus.
If you are interested in getting
together with other Stanford gays
in some way other than the bars,
etc, let us hear from you in carp
of Box 9376 , Stanford.

part of U.S. foreign policy.
We know that SRI and local
industry (Lockheed, H-P, Varian,
etc.) have played significant roles
in the development of technology
for modern wars of
counterinsurgency, as well as for
"strategic warfare" (Poseidon,
AMB, etc.).
We know that war production,
as well as research and
development, is carried out in this
area.
We know that SRI has helped
plan the U.S. corporate
domination (with Japan) of the
Pacific Basin.
We consider all these activities,
to the extent that they contribute
to war, Cold War,
counterinsurgency, and imperial
domination, to be crimes against
humanity.
As the first stage of our
campaign we will investigate the
precise nature of research,
development, training, and
production done in this area. We
ask people with knowledge of
such work to participate.

We will present our findings to
institutions and individuals. We
hope that many people engaged in
war work or related activities will
seek more creative ways of using
their skills. We recognize,
however, that the institutional
context (funding, etc.) limits the
extent to which "voluntary"
change will be successful. We are
prepared, therefore, to take
whatever action necessary to
redirect and reconstruct the
resources of our communities.

I was really pleased to see the
article on "Adjusting to Gay Life"
bv "a gay woman" in Monday's
Daily. Glad to see that the Daily
is liberated enough to print
material on Stanford gays, but
even more pleased to see that this
gay woman cared enough about
the problem to bring it to the
attention of Stanford gays and the
Stanford community in general.
Like my gay sister, 1 came out
at Stanford last year. Coming out
anywhere is a real hassle, but the
apparent lack of fraternity among
gays at Stanford makes it even
more so here.
Maybe it's time the gay

community at Stanford got itself
together in a GLF-Stanford or
whatever to give brothers and
sisters at Stanford help with
hassles, and perhaps to organize
gay functions like those on other
campuses.
I and other Stanford gays
would be interested in hearing
from Stanford gays who have
ideas about possible forms such an
organization might take. At this
point, we're entirely open to
suggestions, we'd just like to get
some response to the idea from
gays on campus.
If you are interested in getting
together with other Stanford gays
in some way other than the bars,
etc, let us hear from you in carp
of Box 9376 , Stanford.

Stanford and local industry out of
war production and research and

engages in a large number of

and ROTC.
We know that Stanford, by
providing the brainpower
through training, consulting, and
research -for the local industrial
complex, is the heart of that
complex.
We know that, as presently
constituted, social sciences,
international programs, and
