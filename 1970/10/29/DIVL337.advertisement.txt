The most intensive study of
the black worker in America
ever undertaken.
I'he complete records of the historic Fair Employ
ment Practices Committee...now available on micro
film.
Created to prevent discrimination in essential World War
II defense industries, the FEPC interviewed approximately
14,000 minoritv-group workers. More than Ho% of them
black.
The result: dramatic, original source material that will
open new doors to the teaching and study of the black man's
role in U.S. industry.
In page after page, black men and women reveal their
personal experiences with discrimination and prejudice
both on the job and in their daily lives. They talk about their
wages and working conditions...their unions and labor
leaders...their ideals and aspirations...their problems and
frustrations.
The entire FEPC microfilm collection includes approx
imately 200 rolls of 35mm film, a separate hardcover index
and a guide.
For further information on this collection-and on out
standing newspapers, magazines and historic documents on
microfilm-write to Microfilming Corporation of Amer
ica, 21 Harristown Road, Glen Rock, New Jersey 07452
