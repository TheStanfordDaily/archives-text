# Bomb Advice Given By Fire Department
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Fire Chiefs Frank Jurian and Jack
Barr insist they don't run a bomb squad
for the Bay Area industries. But in the
past two or three years, the Stanford
Fire Department has provided
information on the nature of explosives
to key corporations.
Citing what he terms the "outside
element" as a "personal threat" to
industry, Jurian acknowledged that the
companies which seek the fire
department's instruction are "more
concerned with arson" than with the
daily hazards of industrial production.
Since 1967, Sylvania, Varian,
Fairchild, Syntex, Hewlett Packard,
and other Bay Area corporations have
attended a class conducted by Chief
Barr, who has had extensive experience
with aircraft weapons and small arms.
"I'm not an expert," says Barr. "All
the experts are dead." The classes,
which are conducted at the request of
one or more companies, are attended
mostly by security officers and safety
engineers.
"They ask us how they can get
people out of a building in a hurry in
the event of a fire bomb, and what sort
of material they should use to
extinguish the fire," Barr said. "Our job
is to tell them."
Although it originated in 1964 to
instruct various industries on how to
dispose of volatile chemicals, Jurian
said the "hazardous materials" course is
also "a self-defense type of thing."
"I think all industries are concerned
with the frequency of the explosions,"
Jurian said. "The Bank of America has
had its share of incinerator-tvpe fires,
and in the recent past, industry has
been faced with molotov cocktails."

Included in the instruction is a
briefing on the two-ton hazardous
materials trailer, a product of Barr's
design, which is built so that if
something explodes in it, the
explosive's contents tunnel straight up
rather than being scattered to the sides.
Jurian and Barr de-emphasize the
growing uneasiness resulting from an
increasing volume of bombings and
bomb threats.
"We've had four or five bomb
threats in the past few months, but
that's no more than usual. It's about
the normal amount," Jurian said.
In an effort to dramatize the
"normalcy," Jurian took pains to cite
an abortive attempt to place an
explosive device in the Big Game
bonfire six or seven years ago. But he
dismissed this and similar activities as
"pranks," and implied that a more
serious situation exists in the society
today.
"Just by reading the Daily, I can see
that some people are concerned about
the type of work SRI (Stanford
Research Institute) does.
"I don't know what
Hewlett-Packard does. But if they're
going to conduct the sort of work that
some people don't like, they're subject
to attack."
It's primarily the industries which
consider themselves subject to such an
attack from the "outside element" that
seek the aid of the fire department.
The large number of industrial
corporations that has sought help from
the department during the summer and
early fall causes Frank Jurian to say,
"Hell, let's face it. I think they're all
concerned about the outside element."

BOMB PROTECTIONâ€”Fire Chief Barr demonstrates a contraption used to
contain a bomb explosion so that the force of the explosion is directed upwards
rather than spraying sideways. Most people probably wouldn't stand that close if
a bomb were in it, just in case.
