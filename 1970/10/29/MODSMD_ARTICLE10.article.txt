Rally or Riot?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This morning you quoted me
as having told the Daily, "a riot
will begin at 5 :30 at 7th and San
Carlos Streets in San Jose." The
fact of the matter is that I called
the Daily and several other
newspapers and organizations and
told them that there is going to be
a rally at 5:30 Thursday at San
Jose State, 7 th and San Carlos.
You placed that misquote
directly under "unofficial sources
have predicted disorders . . Was
the misquote an honest
misunderstanding? If so, Bill
P'reivogel, who took the call, could
have asked, "Did you say riot?"
Or the writer of the article,
Nicholas Dungan, could have
called and asked what I said.
Or was the misquote a
deliberate attempt to split the left
as the article proceeds to do -with
the headings "Riot" and "Hard
Hats?" Using the radical left as a
threat against "Middle America"
is an old tactic- one that has been
used successfully from time to
time to divide the people. Does
the Daily staff really want to be in
that position? Or does the staff
choose to unite and defeat the
real enemy?

I received the phone call in
question. The first thing that I
heard was "Did you know there
was going to be a riot in San
Jose." I went to get a piece of
paper while Mrs. Franklin waited,
wrote down the quotation and
proceeded to ask her several more
questions. My recollection is that
she repeated the word "riot" one
or two more timcn.

Despite these recollections, I
thought Mrs. Franklin was sincere
yesterday when she protested to
me that she had been misquoted. I
think that it is probable that she
misstated or I misheard
yesterday's conversation. Both of
us are fallible, and I think there
may have been a misunderstand
ing.
One other reflectionâ€”l regret
that Mrs. Franklin saw fit to cast
the misunderstanding in a
conspiratorial light.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We live in a dream world at
Stanford. Accustomed to the role
of passive observers, we've lost
track of the fact that we can and
should be active participants in a
real life struggle between those
who want to keep your (yes it is)
government on its present path
and those who would set it right.
The struggle is in places like
Mountain View and West San
Jose, and the reality is that those
voters who will decide the
outcome don't really know which
candidate represents their view.
They know they want less
unemployment, lower interest
rates, out of Vietnam, lower
taxes, etc. The list is one everyone
agrees with.
The reality is that the
incumbents who've brought us all
these things are now successfully
selling themselves as just the
opposite, and the reality is that
the voter who doesn't keep track
of the incumbent's record doesn't
know what a liar he is. The reality
is that a few words from an

informed precinct worker can
show him who's who. And that
reality is that we humans need a
lot of workers over the next week
if we're to regain a human
government.
If working in the system isn't
your thing, rest assured that
Nixon appreciates your cop-out; if
you can't stomach looking middle
class decent to walk a precinct,
the defense and oil industries are
glad you can't; if you have more
important things to do, Murphy
and Gubser wish you would. And
downtrodden people in such
places as Harlem, Guatemala, and
Vietnam will continue to wonder
how you can be so callous.
