# Cronkite-Father Figure Of Network News
## 
### SALLY GEISLER 
Of earth-shattering importance,
the question is not; but a unique
psychological dependence has
been built around it. The matter
at hand is the 6:30 CBS news. Th
issue: Why do people continually
watch it?
The nightly pilgrimage to the
TV room has become an
institution in many dorms. An
estimated 90% of newsviewers v
campus not only watch Walt
Cronkite faithfully, but swear by
his evening deliverances. Each
tube-tender seems to harbor his
own ideas why Walter is the
all-around favorite commentator,
yet the fact remains—members of
the Stanford community
statistically ignore NBC's
Brinkley, and the ABC gang seems
to be beyond any hope of rating
at all on campus.
Father Figure
Apparently, people see Walter
as a father figure.
"Very seriously," one dispatch
devotee began, "I look at
Cronkite as the Great White
Father of the News."
After the initial groans and
comments, the discussion
developed.
"She might have something
actually," one news-lover
remarked. "He's the only guy
worth watching who's been on the
tube since I was a kid . . . you
know, Twentieth Century, CBS
specials, etc."
People seem to think that
Cronkite has a wise, philosophical
outlook towards the mess the
world seems to perpetuate.
"His moustache is cute,"
volunteered one coed. Others in
the room, feeling a little more
intellectually oriented observed,
"Walt has a masculine air about

him . . . kind of a relaxing,
soothing, voice ... he looks like
Captain Kangaroo ..."
Opinions varied, but the
general consensus was that
Cronkite is far more
straightforward and more
objective than comparable
newsmen. Yet he injects humor
and an optimistic tone into his
nightly news, which seems to
negate the neurosis of a
never-ending war. Furthermore,
"His tongue in-cheek reporting
seems to insinuate an attitude of
'Here is the news—believe it if you
can,' " remarked one member of
the Cronkite contingent. Of
course, these physical qualities are
essential to his popularity
platform, but included in this
plank is far more—the
psychological significance of a
stable strong-hold in a strategic
spot to supervise what is spread to
the American public.
News Interpreter
"He manages to keep his wits
about him," explained an avid
CBS news fan, "but he lets you
know with which issues he agrees
or disagrees." For instance, an RA
in Stern mentioned that Cronkite
was visably upset with the 1968
Chicago "riots", yet she respected
him far more for taking a stand
against Mayor Daly than some of
the other newscasters who merely
projected the problem to the
privileged public.
Besides the protective image
which Cronkite seems to share
with his audience, he has an
additional attraction on his
show—Eric Sevareid. Eric seems to
be some type of a hero/scapegoat,
depending upon the audience.

In one instance, the channel was
changed during a commercial,
prior to Sevareid's last minute
sum-up editorial. After a
momentary pandemonium the
room calmed down and the
Sevareid zealots settled back into
their corners.
Amazingly enough, Eric was
boo'd and cut down to a point
where no one could hear, yet all
involved seemed to enjoy
watching his popularity collapse.
However, most of the fans
maintained that Sevareid's superb
statistics and statements served
only to settle their
surmises . . . Walter is the hero of
the show.
Knows The Issues
"Walt does know the issues
with which he is dealing,"
expressed another adament
adherent. "I find his older,
authoritative attitude an addition
to a truly great half hour of fun
and relaxation," stated another
facetiously.
Although the basic arguments
differed, opinions did converge
into one aspect—Cronkite does
not inflict his views in a biased
manner upon the captive
audience. Specifically, he does not
offend people.
Furthermore, he teels the day's
episodes as well as he can, in as
open an atmosphere as possible.
This leads back to the idea that
viewers trust him. He explicitly
places an emphasis on personal
research, and appears to be
working straight to the point.
"Cronkite is human and he lets
you know that he cares." Such is
the feeling of the Cronkite
Clientele. And that's the way it is,
Thursday, October 2 9,1970.

with which he is dealing,"
expressed another adament
adherent. "I find his older,
authoritative attitude an addition
to a truly great half hour of fun
and relaxation," stated another
facetiously.
Although the basic arguments
differed, opinions did converge
into one aspect—Cronkite does
not inflict his views in a biased
manner upon the captive
audience. Specifically, he does not
offend people.
Furthermore, he teels the day's
episodes as well as he can, in as
open an atmosphere as possible.
This leads back to the idea that
viewers trust him. He explicitly
places an emphasis on personal
research, and appears to be
working straight to the point.
"Cronkite is human and he lets
you know that he cares." Such is
the feeling of the Cronkite
Clientele. And that's the way it is,
Thursday, October 2 9,1970.

THAT'S THE WAY IT IS —Dorm residents sprawl before WalU* Cronkite's steady gaze.
Of earth-shattering importance,
the question is not; but a unique
psychological dependence has
been built around it. The matter
at hand is the 6:30 CBS news. Th
issue: Why do people continually
watch it?
The nightly pilgrimage to the
TV room has become an
institution in many dorms. An
estimated 90% of newsviewers v
campus not only watch Walt
Cronkite faithfully, but swear by
his evening deliverances. Each
tube-tender seems to harbor his
own ideas why Walter is the
all-around favorite commentator,
yet the fact remains—members of
the Stanford community
statistically ignore NBC's
Brinkley, and the ABC gang seems
to be beyond any hope of rating
at all on campus.
Father Figure
Apparently, people see Walter
as a father figure.
"Very seriously," one dispatch
devotee began, "I look at
Cronkite as the Great White
Father of the News."
After the initial groans and
comments, the discussion
developed.
"She might have something
actually," one news-lover
remarked. "He's the only guy
worth watching who's been on the
tube since I was a kid . . . you
know, Twentieth Century, CBS
specials, etc."
People seem to think that
Cronkite has a wise, philosophical
outlook towards the mess the
world seems to perpetuate.
"His moustache is cute,"
volunteered one coed. Others in
the room, feeling a little more
intellectually oriented observed,
"Walt has a masculine air about

him . . . kind of a relaxing,
soothing, voice ... he looks like
Captain Kangaroo ..."
Opinions varied, but the
general consensus was that
Cronkite is far more
straightforward and more
objective than comparable
newsmen. Yet he injects humor
and an optimistic tone into his
nightly news, which seems to
negate the neurosis of a
never-ending war. Furthermore,
"His tongue in-cheek reporting
seems to insinuate an attitude of
'Here is the news—believe it if you
can,' " remarked one member of
the Cronkite contingent. Of
course, these physical qualities are
essential to his popularity
platform, but included in this
plank is far more—the
psychological significance of a
stable strong-hold in a strategic
spot to supervise what is spread to
the American public.
News Interpreter
"He manages to keep his wits
about him," explained an avid
CBS news fan, "but he lets you
know with which issues he agrees
or disagrees." For instance, an RA
in Stern mentioned that Cronkite
was visably upset with the 1968
Chicago "riots", yet she respected
him far more for taking a stand
against Mayor Daly than some of
the other newscasters who merely
projected the problem to the
privileged public.
Besides the protective image
which Cronkite seems to share
with his audience, he has an
additional attraction on his
show—Eric Sevareid. Eric seems to
be some type of a hero/scapegoat,
depending upon the audience.

In one instance, the channel was
changed during a commercial,
prior to Sevareid's last minute
sum-up editorial. After a
momentary pandemonium the
room calmed down and the
Sevareid zealots settled back into
their corners.
Amazingly enough, Eric was
boo'd and cut down to a point
where no one could hear, yet all
involved seemed to enjoy
watching his popularity collapse.
However, most of the fans
maintained that Sevareid's superb
statistics and statements served
only to settle their
surmises . . . Walter is the hero of
the show.

the other newscasters who merely
projected the problem to the
privileged public.
Besides the protective image
which Cronkite seems to share
with his audience, he has an
additional attraction on his
show—Eric Sevareid. Eric seems to
be some type of a hero/scapegoat,
depending upon the audience.

In one instance, the channel was
changed during a commercial,
prior to Sevareid's last minute
sum-up editorial. After a
momentary pandemonium the
room calmed down and the
Sevareid zealots settled back into
their corners.
Amazingly enough, Eric was
boo'd and cut down to a point
where no one could hear, yet all
involved seemed to enjoy
watching his popularity collapse.
However, most of the fans
maintained that Sevareid's superb
statistics and statements served
only to settle their
surmises . . . Walter is the hero of
the show.
Knows The Issues
"Walt does know the issues
with which he is dealing,"
expressed another adament
adherent. "I find his older,
authoritative attitude an addition
to a truly great half hour of fun
and relaxation," stated another
facetiously.
Although the basic arguments
differed, opinions did converge
into one aspect—Cronkite does
not inflict his views in a biased
manner upon the captive
audience. Specifically, he does not
offend people.
Furthermore, he teels the day's
episodes as well as he can, in as
open an atmosphere as possible.
This leads back to the idea that
viewers trust him. He explicitly
places an emphasis on personal
research, and appears to be
working straight to the point.
"Cronkite is human and he lets
you know that he cares." Such is
the feeling of the Cronkite
Clientele. And that's the way it is,

THAT'S THE WAY IT IS —Dorm residents sprawl before WalU* Cronkite's steady gaze.
Of earth-shattering importance,
the question is not; but a unique
psychological dependence has
been built around it. The matter
at hand is the 6:30 CBS news. Th
issue: Why do people continually
watch it?
The nightly pilgrimage to the
TV room has become an
institution in many dorms. An
estimated 90% of newsviewers v
campus not only watch Walt
Cronkite faithfully, but swear by
his evening deliverances. Each
tube-tender seems to harbor his
own ideas why Walter is the
all-around favorite commentator,
yet the fact remains—members of
the Stanford community
statistically ignore NBC's
Brinkley, and the ABC gang seems
to be beyond any hope of rating
at all on campus.
Father Figure
Apparently, people see Walter
as a father figure.
"Very seriously," one dispatch
devotee began, "I look at
Cronkite as the Great White
Father of the News."
After the initial groans and
comments, the discussion
developed.
"She might have something
actually," one news-lover
remarked. "He's the only guy
worth watching who's been on the
tube since I was a kid . . . you
know, Twentieth Century, CBS
specials, etc."
People seem to think that
Cronkite has a wise, philosophical
outlook towards the mess the
world seems to perpetuate.
"His moustache is cute,"
volunteered one coed. Others in
the room, feeling a little more
intellectually oriented observed,
"Walt has a masculine air about

him . . . kind of a relaxing,
soothing, voice ... he looks like
Captain Kangaroo ..."
Opinions varied, but the
general consensus was that
Cronkite is far more
straightforward and more
objective than comparable
newsmen. Yet he injects humor
and an optimistic tone into his
nightly news, which seems to
negate the neurosis of a
never-ending war. Furthermore,
"His tongue in-cheek reporting
seems to insinuate an attitude of
'Here is the news—believe it if you
can,' " remarked one member of
the Cronkite contingent. Of
course, these physical qualities are
essential to his popularity
platform, but included in this
plank is far more—the
psychological significance of a
stable strong-hold in a strategic
spot to supervise what is spread to
the American public.
News Interpreter
"He manages to keep his wits
about him," explained an avid
CBS news fan, "but he lets you
know with which issues he agrees
or disagrees." For instance, an RA
in Stern mentioned that Cronkite
was visably upset with the 1968
Chicago "riots", yet she respected
him far more for taking a stand
against Mayor Daly than some of
the other newscasters who merely
projected the problem to the
privileged public.
Besides the protective image
which Cronkite seems to share
with his audience, he has an
additional attraction on his
show—Eric Sevareid. Eric seems to
