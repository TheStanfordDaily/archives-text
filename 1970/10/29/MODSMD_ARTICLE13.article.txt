# Black Condition In South Africa Assailed
## 
### CHRIS KATZENBACH 
"South Africa is an independent state
for the white man, but a slave state for the
black man ... I think that this is the same
as in the United States," claimed 1.8
Tabata of the Unity Movement of South
Africa.
Tabata spoke in Jordan Hall Tuesday in
a program sponsored jointly by the Black
Students Union, the Organization of
African Students at Stanford, and the
Third World Students Union. During his
speech, discussed exploitation of the black
man in South Africa, and the Unity
Movement revolutionary organization.
While South Africa is the most highly
industrialized country in Africa, Tabata
explained, industry can not stand on its
own feet and must have foreign capital to
survive.
To obtain that capital, according to
Tabata, South Africa must exploit its
agriculture and mineral resources,
particularly uranium, diamonds, and gold.
The exploitation of these natural resources,
he said however, depends on the
availability of cheap black labor. "The
primary task of the government of South
Africa is to supply this labor to the mines."
Labor Shortage
There is, however, an extreme labor
shortageâ€”6o% of the workers in the mines
come from outside South Africa. Tabata

claims that the problem for the
government is how to force blacks into the
mines. While in the past the traditional
Afrikaner (Dutch) approach has been "to
tie the Kafir to the wagon wheel and give
him a strapping until he does what you
want him to do", the modern methods,
due to the English influence, is to arrange
things so that the African has no choice
but to work in the mines. "They have to
create reservoirs of labor. They must bring
out every able-bodied black man, every not
so able-bodied black man, and every
unable-bodied black man and drive him
into these reservoirs."
In ( X95 0, the South African government
passed the Group Areas Act. The Act made
all of South Africa a "White Group Area",
except for small, widely-scattered areas
reserved for blacks, a total of only 13% of
the land area of South Africa. It wasn't
possible for all the black people to live on
such a small amount of land, Tabata
pointed out. "The whole purpose of the
Act was to declare every black man a
foreigner in the land of his birth. Wherever
he is he has no right to be there, he must
have a permit to be there." He can only get
a permit if he works for a white man, or in
a company owned by white men.
Under the laws no black man can vote
or own property, even in the areas reserved
for him. "By law a black man is not a
worker, he is a 'work-seeker'. This means

he is not entitled to worker's rights; he
cannot join a union, he cannot strike." If a
black should strike, the police are called in,
he is arrested, and thrown in jail, Tabata
said. "In only one case are the police not
called. When the mine workers go on
strike, you don't call the police, you call
the army. They either go down into the
mines, or they go down six feet into a
grave. The mines must run 2 4 hours a
day."
Forced Labor
Because all blacks are "work-seekers",
Tabata explained, all black males must
register at the Labor Depot after age
fourteen. Because blacks can own no land,
whenever an area is in need of cheap labor,
whole villages can be ordered moved to the
new locations sometimes hundreds of miles
away.
Tabata described the human cost of
these policies. Half of the black children
born in South Africa die before the age of
five from malnutrition or diseases due to
malnutrition. "Every fifty seconds of every
hour of every day of every year one black
child dies of malnutrition and diseases
related to malnutrition." Under the pass
(permit) system men are thrown in jail for
trying to work without a pass, leaving
wives and children to starve. "Every three
to four minutes a man is being arrested for
not having his papers on him. Maybe he

left them at home, in the pocket of
another coat, it does not matter; he is put
in jail."
Tabata quoted a black African
describing the misery of life under
Apartheid: "Our wives stand over the
graves and their children move from the
womb into the grave." The forced work in
the mines reduces the average life span of
an African man to only forty years.
Armed Revolution
The Unity Movement as described by
Tabata is a federation of many groups
united to fight oppression. Tabata sees
armed revolution as the only solution and
the Unity Movement is attempting to arm
the people of South Africa. While
admitting that armed struggle will
inevitably mean "rivers of blood, he said,
"We must go through this blood to save
our nation."
. .Do I believe in violence? I come
from violence, I live with violence, violence
is rained on my head every day; what does
belief have to do with it?
"People hold all sorts of ideas about
how we can liberate ourselves. They say:
Svliy don't we settle it around a table?'
Very well, but can you get Verwoerd to
that table+ No ... not so long as he can
still shoot a black man like an animal he
won't go to that table. But the day when
that bullet is returned to him .. . then he
will think again about going to the table."
