# Football Anxieties, Traumas Soothed By First Aid Posts

### CHRIS PECK 
The excitement of Stanford football at times
exceeds the wildest expectations of Chuck Taylor
and John Ralston.
Every game, dozens of fans zealously go
whirling, falling and otherwise frolicking into the
emergency first aid station after the excitement of
a big play overcomes their equilibrium.
A quarter or two of a big game viewed from a
bed in the first aid room provides a whole new
insight into college football. The big minus about
this new vantage point is that no actual football is
seen. This deficiency however, does not diminish
the excitement of a game.
Rig moments in a game always appear in the
first aid room. The bigger the play, the more
numerous and unique the casualties that appear.
Take the Stanford -UCLA game for example. In
the first quarter, about thirty people came to the
booth to ask for aspirin. It was easy to deduce the
events on the field. Stanford was slowly moving
towards a touchdown, much to the chagrin of the
thirty worried fans.
Then, with Stanford on the one yard line, a big
moment came. Diving over the pile of players on
the field, a Stanford back fumbled. In the stands,
an ecstatic and enibriated UCLA fan jumped to his
feet only to fumble his new found balance and
take a back dive into the bleachers knocking his
drunken body cold. Immediately he was taken to
the first aid station so the fans there could get a
taste of the action.
In the third quarter of the same game, about
15 0 aspirin later, Dennis Dummit fired the
go-ahead touchdown pass. Pandemonium broke
loose on the UCLA side. Inside one female rooter
something else broke loose too. She was wheeled
into the emergency room. The excitement of the
preceeding play wasn't lost on anyone there either
as the woman was diaganosed as having aborted
her birth control coil.
There are some injuries during the course of a
game that are unique to the football stadium. One
of these maladies is the infamous "Trick Nicks."
Cards used in the halftime show turn into vicious
carriers of the "Nicks." The Nicks strike when
students hurl the cards, creating a sort of living

buzz saw nicking ears, eyes and necks.The big
variable affecting the first aid room from game to
game is the weather. On days when the sun shines
and the temperature zooms, the facilities are
overcrowded with sun-struck fans. Relatives and
friends tenderly drag loved ones to the shady beds
of the station. Usually the fainters pass up the
opportunity of viewing the game from this
interesting vantage point, but a few with high
blood pressure tend to think the combination of
high excitement and lessened heat is too tempting.
On cold days, the Fainters diminish and the
Overheaters appear. An Overheater is someone
who introduces large quantities of alcholic
beverage into his body as a defensive measure
against the cold.
The alcohol does reduce sensitivity to cold, but
at the same time sensitivity to balance is reduced
and ability to remain in an upright position is
hampered. Under such conditions, the first aid
station obliges the Overheater and offers its
comfortable beds as assistance.
A number of other exciting aspects of football
in the first aid station can be experienced only by
individual participation in this program.
Too many greasy burgers and flying rolls of
toilet paper (along with other hazards to body and
mind) make football stadium first aid a necessity.
Audience involvement which ends up in the first
aid station shows that what is usually thought of
as a spectator sport is really something in which
everyone participates.
