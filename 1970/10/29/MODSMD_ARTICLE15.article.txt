(By the way, these books are
for real)
If you've been in the Stanford
Bookstore recently, you probably
will not have noticed five tables
packed with books on sale. The
reason you probably missed the
five tables was that you were too
busy stealing Bic pens. However,
the tables do exist and all the

books on them sell for 35 cents or
3 for a dollar.
If anything's selling for 35
cents these days, there's got to be
something wrong with it. These
books are certainly no exception.
They have collected dust and
cluttered up the bookstore for the
past ten years because no one
would buy them, and one look at
the books is sufficient to explain
why. Yet it also raises a more
fundamental literary question,
"How does this garbage get
published?"
At any rate, I thought I'd
describe what five of the
worstsellers were like so you
won't waste your time browsing
through them like I did and you'll
have more time to steal Bic pens.
Eggbert: Advice to the
Love-born, is a series of totally

humorless cartoons in which a
human fetus Eggbert gives advice
to other unborn fetuses. In the
typical tastefulness of the book
one fetus writes in to Eggbert,
"Mom's warm all night, but I
shiver. How come?" To this
Eggbert wittily replies, "Dear
Iceberg, keep away from your
Dad's cold feet." The book is
written by Laf, which after
reading the book, appears to be
one of the most pretentious pen
names in the history of literature.
Fred and Abner Berson tell all
the secrets of a professional coin
dealer in their book, entitled,
believe it or not "Secrets of a
Professional Coin Dealer. What
they don't tell is why the secrets
have been kept secret this long,
namely because no one really
wanted to hear their secrets. But

this really didn't seem to bother
Fred or Abner, or for that matter
the publisher. Thus, a worstseller.
How to Catch and Hold a Man
is by Yvonne Antelle, and if she
follows her own advice, I'll wager
right now that Yvonne is single,
lonely, and not very wealthy from
this book. Whatever in the book
isn't totally stupid, any simpleton
could figure out on his own
without Yvonne's help, as, for
example when she says, "Dirty
teeth, hair, elbows, nails, ankles,
underarm odor, and period odors
all repulse."
The Lawrence Welk Story is
the story of how Lawrence Welk,
"unschooled in music and
showmanship, deeply moral and
religious, unsophisticated â€”
became America's greatest
bandleader," while still remaining
"unschooled in music and
showmanship,'' and

"unsophisticated " By the way, I
bought the last copy of this book,
and if anyone wants to read it, I'll
sell it to them for a dollar.
You would have thought that
after his first disaster, Laf would
have done something constructive
like commiting suicide. But no
such luck. Even more incredible is
that someone would publish
another book by this pathetic
man.
Yet, Eggbert and Eggberta was
published and unfortunately Laf
lost none of that talent which
made his first book such a loser.
In this book there are twins
making totally inane remarks
inside a mother's womb. I guess
Laf didn't want to break up the
winning combination of the
womb setting. All in all, this book
is equally as bad as Laf's first, and
all I can say is that I hope we have
had the last Laf.

opportunity to buy books on sale.
