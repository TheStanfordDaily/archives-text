# Prices, Unemployment Rise Again; Nixon Claims Inflation Checked
## 
### NICHOLAS DUNGAN GRECORY VAIL 
Rising prices, continued and
increasing unemployment, and a
generally unstable economy may
influence the outcome of Tuesday's
national elections, some authorities say.
However, President Nixon said
yesterday in Longview, Texas,
the Administration's fiscal policies are a
success, and "inflation has been
checked and will slow still further.
"After a difficult battle against big
spending," he said, "We see signs on
every hand that our economic strategy
is working."
Yet, according to Labor Department
statistics for September, five and
one-half percent of the labor force was
jobless. It was also announced
yesterday that unemployment has
substantially increased this month in a
large number of regions.
Inflation, which spiralled up .4
percent in September, has continued to
cut into the spending power of the
dollar bill. What cost $10.00 in 1959
now costs $13.66.
And while food prices went down in
October, industrial markups have risen.
Reaction Mixed
In the midst of worsening economic
indicators and heightened national
debate about the economy, the Daily
yesterday interviewed a University
economist, sociologist, and political
scientist about the economic and

political aspects of the recession. Their
reaction was mixed.
Professor Moses Abramovitz of the
Economics Department described the
Administration's economic policy as an
attempt to slow the growth of
expenditures and the rate of inflation.
By keeping the unemployment rate at
five and one-half percent, he said, the
price increases are expected to fall.
However, it is possible that inflation
will worsen before it improves, and that
it will increase in 1971, Abramovitz
explained.
Repercussions Possible
The Administration's policy is
fiscally sound, but in the attempt to
stimulate business, the Nixon
Administration may suffer disastrous
political repercussions because of its
actions, Abramovitz said.
Professor John Meyer of the
Sociology Department agreed with
Abramovitz about the possible political
daggers in store for the Administration
economic policies. Meyer said that the
Republican Party's historical lack of
concern for workers combined with the
current rising unemployment rate
mitigates against Republican political
gains in Tuesday's election.
Professor Raymone E. Wolfinger, of
the Political Science Department,
emphasized that the Administration is
not "keeping people unemployed, but
pursuing policies which have caused
unemployment."

Wolfinger explained that when the
economy is bad, blame is placed on the
administration in power, regardless of
party affiliation or actual
responsibility. The public reaction to a
bad economy is the same as to a war
abroad, such as Vietnam: the current
administration gets the brunt, although
it may actually be solving the problem.
Second, Wolfinger said, many people
who are not unemployed are not doing
well because of inflation and are aware
of the possibility of being laid
off—although they may not be directly
threatened.
Finally, some of the unemployed
will express their grievances by voting
against the Republicans. Fewer people
turn out to vote in a non-Presidential
year, but if the economy is sluggish, the
unemployed and economically
suffering are heard in larger numbers at
the polls, Wolfinger said.
Unemployment Fears
Unemployed persons do not act as a
cohesive sociological group. There is a

fear, said Meyer, and a lack of
confidence, that accompanies
unemployment.
Even an executive, Meyer said, can
have damaging questions about himself
when he loses his job. He feels that
"maybe I never will get a job again.
Maybe my being an executive was just
b.s. Maybe my family doesn't need me;
I'm not supporting them."
The Democrats, through their work
in the Depression and after the
Eisenhower recession of the late
1950'5, are known as the party on
labor's side—just as the Republicans are
known to foster peace and solve foreign
wars.
The political conclusions that can be
drawn are necessarily tenuous. But
people generally vote against what they
presently dislike, and the Republicans
cannot expect to gain many votes for
their economic policies, even
considering the President's
proclamation yesterday.
