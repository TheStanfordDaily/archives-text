# New Age Solution To Old Problem
## 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
If as the man says, we are what
we eat, most of us are in serious
trouble. What we eat is certainly
not designed to bring into
existence well-constructed human
beings.
We consume gallons of weird
chemicals in milk,
carbonated-syrup soft drinks, and
super-preserved fruit juices. Our
bread, far from being a staff of
life, is filled with "enriching"
substances and other strange
things, and vegetables and fruits
are coated with insecticides and
sprays and shot full of color.
For most people, an alternative
to industrialized food is not yet
possible. People who live in
Supermarket Land have virtually
no control over what they eat,
and those who are in the vicinity
of the average juice bar find it
difficult to acquire a taste for
tiger milk just because they know
it's healthful.
An interesting possibility has
arisen in Palo Alto, however, and
that is the newly opened New Age
Foodstore, located at 260
California Street. It has been open
for a little over a month now, and
the response from the Palo Alto
community, well over 15% more
business than the management
had expected, indicates that

higher prices will not deter the
shopper who is concerned about
maintaining a well-balanced
internal envirnment.
The internal environment of
the New Age store itself is highly
unusual. It fills up the interior of
what was once a Purity food
market, which makes it probably
the largest organic food store
around, but the average
supermarket ambiance is missing.
Instead of plastic floors, blaring
Muzak, and narrow, crowded
aisles, New Age is full of space,
with wooden floors, wooden
shelves set at interesting angles,
and a large flour mill as the most
prominent fixture.
Delicatessen
A large and bountiful
delicatessen occupies one wall of
the store. Here are a variety of
dishes made with organic foods,
including nut butters, breads,
salads, and the Sesameburger,
which is made from a variety of
seeds and grains and served on a
big wheat bun with lettuce and
tomatoes. Just like
Jack-in-the-Box, only different.
This kind of setting is the only
one which would seem
appropriate with the natural and
unpretentious products sold at
New age. Huge barrels hold dried

vegetables, grains of all sorts,
seeds, and flours. (All flour is
ground on the premises just in
time to keep up with the demand,
but not much sooner.) Immense
varieties of honey, biodegradable
soaps and detergents, vitamins,
books, fruits and vegetables, and
nearly all of the types of food
found in ordinary stores are all
here.
There are two principle
differences, however. One is the
obvious one—all these foods are
natural organic products which
have never been exposed to any
kind of chemical treatment in any
stage of their preparation.
Another is not apparent until you
hit the check-out line — nearly all
of them tend to cost more than
their non-organic counterparts.
Why High Costs?
The reason for this is not hard
to figure out. Growing and
packaging food outside the
standard mass channels is more
expensive to do and not as
profitable, so there are less people
doing it. What is surprising is that
the New Age Foodstore
management does not expect the
inequities to last much longer.

According to Fred Rohe, the
president of the New Age
Company, the store will be
competitive with other
supermarkets within twelve to
eighteen months. Already, the
higher volume sales made possible
by the Palo Alto store have
enabled New Age to utilize mass
buying techniques that have
driven down the price of produce
approximately 15% and bulk grain
25%.
Rohe feels that the people who
complain about the high prices at
this point, thinking that New Age
is making too high a profit, are
basing their judgements on false
assumptions.
"We're capitalists, but we're
not pigs. Last year, we lost $5 42,
and that should show that we're
not trying to rip anybody off, but
just about breaking even. Our aim
is to make about 2Vi% profit,
which is the industry average, and
it's what we need to keep our
business going."
Rohe stated the goal of the
New Age stores as "honest food at
honest prices." "What's important
about New Age is that we are here
to help improve the quality of life
on this planet."

New Age has been around helping
since 1965 , when Rohe opened
the first store in San Francisco.
Business was fairly slow during
the first year, but as more and
more young people became
involved in natural foods, it
picked up fairly rapidly, and the
firm solvency of the company led
to the expansion to Palo Alto this
year.
The growing interest in organic
foods which has taken place over
the past few years id due to
several factors—the increased
interest in both spirituality and
ecology plays a large part, and so
does the growing disenchantment
with what is traditionally offered
in the grocery store. The cereal
expose over the summer certainly
didn't hurt the cause, as
disillusioned corn-flakers realized.
The shoppers at New Age
reflect this diversity of
motivation. Along with
youngpeople and various kinds of
freaks, housewives and older
people as well all shop at the
store, in search of what they have
in common is a simple thing;
they're all something just a little
more healthful.

RABBIT JUlCE—Chilled carrot juice seems to be on the dinner menu
of this young lady. It's delicious served with a green salad and a few
tomatoes.

MORE FUN THAN A BARREL OF GRANOLA— New Age offers bulk grains in containers ranging in size
from little tiny paper bags to super-enormous paper bags, depending on how long you want to shovel. F
you have a large pick-up truck to fill, they can do that too.
