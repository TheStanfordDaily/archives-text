# An Explanation Of NYRE
## 
### 
Trying to explain what the
New York Rock Ensemble is all
about to a college audience is
tough. Tom Bacchetti in the
Public Events Office, who booked
them in for their concert this
Friday night (October 30, Mem.
Aud. 8:00 p.m.) brought them
back to Stanford for a couple of
reasons. First, they had proved
very popular during the 1969
Stanford Summer Festival and he
wanted to see if the audience
would respond in the same
manner.
Secondly, and more important,
there was a real sympathetic
feeling for the group as they are
trained musicians — a peculiar
hang-up Bacchetti admits to after
working around a university for a
long time. The fact that here were
four guys trained in classical
music (not quite accurate — three
in classical and one honest to
goodness hard rock musician),
playing some pretty heavy hard
rock was intriguing.
Bacchetti put it this way: "My
tastes in music are eclectic, but I
do tend to prefer 'professionals'
with some disciplined training. I
discovered a real problem last year
when trying to recruit a local
group to back-up Elly Stone in
the residency program we put
together. Tlie instrumentation
called for a good rock guitarist
who could read music. The charts
for Elly's concert are tough and
we needed to find someone who
could cut it.

We went to the San Francisco
local of the Musicians Union. We
all know that San Francisco is the
center of a lot of rock. What we
didn't know, but quickly found
out, was that Local no. 6 of the
Af of M had only five electric
guitarists on their roster that
could read music. We were lucky,
we got one of them.
"You can draw your own
conclusions from that, but what
bugs me about the lack of training
is the limited growth potential of
untrained musicians. Conversely, a
group like the New York Rock
Ensemble has limitless potential.
This is adequately demonstrated
by the evolutionary growth they
have experienced in the last two
years.
"When they last played here,
they performed a program
entitled "Rock / Bach" in which
they alternated between styles in
seperate numbers. It was a
beginning, but certainly not a
synthesis. They have approached
that problem and it would appear
from reports of earlier concerts
this year, they have licked it.
A reviewer for a mid-west
college paper describes them this
way. 'The secret of the NYRE is
that they have taken rock music
and found qualities in it that
parallel the Baroque. Strong
harmonic rhythm, a polarization
between soprano and bass lines,
and an insistent and repetitive use
of motivic material characterize
both Bach and rock. Drawing

upon these similarities, this group
is able to slide comfortably from
one idiom to the other, until the
listener is not sure where one
stops and the other takes over.' "
Unless you have heard the New
York Rock Ensemble before, you
probably have not heard anything
like it. You won't be
disappointed, either.
The personnel of the NYRE
are: Cliff Nivison, guitar (and also
occasionally doubles on drums);
Michael Kamen, organ, piano,
oboe — and has been known to
pick up drums, cello and violin
during concerts; Dorian
Rudnytsky, electric bass and cello
and other assorted instruments;
and Marty Fulterman, drums,
aboe, tamborine, etc. All the guys
sing at different times.
For anyone who wants to meet
the NYRE before the concert,
they will hold what the Office of
Public Events calls an "Audience
Briefing" before their concert.
They will rap with students for
about an hour and a half
beginning at 4:00 p.m. in the
lounge of Toyon Hall Friday. As
Michael Kamen puts it:
"The college concert relates
directly to a sexual by-product of
our culture known as the
'quickie': quite enjoyable, but it's
over too soon."
The NYRE want to change
that. Come meet tnem at Toyon.

Unless you have heard the New
York Rock Ensemble before, you
probably have not heard anything
like it. You won't be
disappointed, either.
The personnel of the NYRE
are: Cliff Nivison, guitar (and also
occasionally doubles on drums);
Michael Kamen, organ, piano,
oboe — and has been known to
pick up drums, cello and violin
during concerts; Dorian
Rudnytsky, electric bass and cello
and other assorted instruments;
and Marty Fulterman, drums,
aboe, tamborine, etc. All the guys
sing at different times.
For anyone who wants to meet
the NYRE before the concert,
they will hold what the Office of
Public Events calls an "Audience
Briefing" before their concert.
They will rap with students for
about an hour and a half
beginning at 4:00 p.m. in the
lounge of Toyon Hall Friday. As
Michael Kamen puts it:
"The college concert relates
directly to a sexual by-product of
our culture known as the
'quickie': quite enjoyable, but it's
over too soon."
The NYRE want to change
that. Come meet tnem at Toyon.

Trying to explain what the
New York Rock Ensemble is all
about to a college audience is
tough. Tom Bacchetti in the
Public Events Office, who booked
them in for their concert this
Friday night (October 30, Mem.
Aud. 8:00 p.m.) brought them
back to Stanford for a couple of
reasons. First, they had proved
very popular during the 1969
Stanford Summer Festival and he
wanted to see if the audience
would respond in the same
manner.
Secondly, and more important,
there was a real sympathetic
feeling for the group as they are
trained musicians — a peculiar
hang-up Bacchetti admits to after
working around a university for a
long time. The fact that here were
four guys trained in classical
music (not quite accurate — three
in classical and one honest to
goodness hard rock musician),
playing some pretty heavy hard
rock was intriguing.
Bacchetti put it this way: "My
tastes in music are eclectic, but I
do tend to prefer 'professionals'
with some disciplined training. I
discovered a real problem last year
when trying to recruit a local
group to back-up Elly Stone in
the residency program we put
together. Tlie instrumentation
called for a good rock guitarist
who could read music. The charts
for Elly's concert are tough and
we needed to find someone who
could cut it.

We went to the San Francisco
local of the Musicians Union. We
all know that San Francisco is the
center of a lot of rock. What we
didn't know, but quickly found
out, was that Local no. 6 of the
Af of M had only five electric
guitarists on their roster that
could read music. We were lucky,
we got one of them.
"You can draw your own
conclusions from that, but what
bugs me about the lack of training
is the limited growth potential of
untrained musicians. Conversely, a
group like the New York Rock
Ensemble has limitless potential.
This is adequately demonstrated
by the evolutionary growth they
have experienced in the last two
years.
"When they last played here,
they performed a program
entitled "Rock / Bach" in which
they alternated between styles in
seperate numbers. It was a
beginning, but certainly not a
synthesis. They have approached
that problem and it would appear
from reports of earlier concerts
this year, they have licked it.
A reviewer for a mid-west
college paper describes them this
way. 'The secret of the NYRE is
that they have taken rock music
and found qualities in it that
parallel the Baroque. Strong
harmonic rhythm, a polarization
between soprano and bass lines,
and an insistent and repetitive use
of motivic material characterize
both Bach and rock. Drawing

upon these similarities, this group
is able to slide comfortably from
one idiom to the other, until the
listener is not sure where one
stops and the other takes over.' "
