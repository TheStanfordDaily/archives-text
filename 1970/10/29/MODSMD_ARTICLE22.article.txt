# Bridge, Love, Tasting-Part 1

The following hand produced a
substantial swing of points (and a
fist) at a recent gathering of the
Stanford Bridge, Love & Tasting
League (BLT). The girls, sitting
East and South, found their male
playing partners uncomfortably
aggressive at the outset of the
bidding (and later bedding). But
the responsibility for the upset
hand (not to mention the upset
stomachs) clearly rested with the
ladies, whose failure accurately to
assess their partners' bids
prompted initial overcaution and
subsequent overextension.

Opening Lead: Ace of Hearts
Because of the holes in her
minor suits, South opened the
bidding with 1 D, rather than with
1 C, so that she would have a
cheaper rebid at the two-level if
partner proved to have a bust.
Too strong to pre-empt with his
7-card Spade suit, West modestly
overcalled with 1 S, planning to
indicate his power on the next
round.
North bid 1 No, a perfect
description of his hand: evenly
balanced, with a stopper (actually
TWO) in the suit of the
intervening bidder. East found
herself in a corner. Her partner's
apparent weak overcall, coupled
with the authoritative tone to
North's No Trump bid (North was

a Leo), convinced her that
North-South, already vulnerable
from the last hand's small slam,
would get the auction. Dismayed
at the defensive weakness of her
hand, but being a fatalist to the
core, East passed.
South proceeded to bid 2 C,
allowing her partner to choose
(cheaply) between her two suits
or- as she expected- to close out
the bidding at 2 No. (South saw
no game for EITHER side on this
deal.) Unhappy that East had not
bid, West contented himself with
a rebid of Spades.
North duly bid 2 No -though
he began to see game possibilities
for his side and hoped that the
bidding would continue. East,
meanwhile, sensed urgency in her
partner's bids (knee pressure was
one indication) and felt obligated
to show her 6-card Heart suit.
Hearing the 3 H bid, South
concluded that the better part of
valor was to pass. For West, the
choice seemed to be between a
raise of his partner's Hearts,
length and strength unknown, and
a rebid of Spades to show its
might. West reasoned, not
improperly, that East's Hearts
would embellish his own holding
and, his own Capricorn
determination undaunted anyway,
he bid 3 S.
Now North took stock. His
partner had copped out on game
by passing—yet South's bid of two
suits (by prior agreement)
indicated five cards in each; with
three cards of his own to
contribute to both, North saw a
nice "fit" at No Trump. Besides,
East's Heart bid, coupled with
West's failure to raise East in
Hearts, made North's Heart Jack a
likely "stopper" against a
defensive onslaught in that suit.
Finally, West's insistent
bidding virtually guaranteed both
the Ace and the Queen of
Spades—thus giving North two
definite stoppers in the Spade
Suit. Counting 5 tricks in his own
hand, North gambled on the
strength of South's minor suits
and bid 3 No. East cheerfully sat
back to await her partner's
double, which came promptly
after South, with rage in her eyes,
passed.
Only mildly disturbed by
West's double, but anxious lest

South's anger with him prompt a
dubious "save" in one of the
minors, North resolutely
countered with a redouble. East,
now eager to play defense with
her Hearts, was not about to be
"fooled" into sacrificing in Hearts
or Spades and passed. (She WAS
fooled, though in two separate
ways, as we shall see.)
Had South passed, North could
have proved the merit of his
reasoned bidding. Leading against
3 No, East would surely attack
Hearts; her Six would force
dummy's (South's) Ace. Writing
off any possibility of finessing for
the King, North leads a low D
from dummy. If West does not
take his K, North MUST finesse
the 10, to protect against a
holding of K 10 xx by West;
North then forces out West's K on
the second round by leading up to
dummy's Q. (This preserves a vital
entry, the Jack of D, into
EITHER North or dummy.)
West's best lead is the Heart Q.
East, however, cannot afford to
overtake it with the K in order to
continue the assault, since to do
so would promote both North's K
and Eight to winners. Unable to
continue Hearts himself, West
must shift to Spades, and his best
lead is the Ace, followed by the
Q. Back in the lead again, North
has a full count on West's hand:
two leads of Spades marked him
with 7 in that suit (East showed
out on the second round), and his
failure to continue Hearts
indicated only two. West's
Diamond holding is almost
certainly three.
(Though West COULD have
taken his K of Diamonds when
that suit was first led, his best
defense is to hold off, hoping to
block North's entry to set up
Diamonds; only if he held TWO
diamonds would he have been
tempted to grab his K on the first
lead of that suit.)
Accordingly, North knows
West has but two Clubs—one of
which MUST be the Ace, in view
of West's energetic bidding and
defensive adeptness. (North
likewise places East with three
clubs headed by the Q, East
MUST have the Q, for she would
never have bid Hearts at the three
level if the Heart K were her sole
honor.)

From here on, the game is a
lay-down. North leads a low Club
from his hand, playing dummy's
10. If West refuses the trick,
dummy's trey forces it out on the
next round. (If he takes the Ace
on the first lead. North later
finesses East's Queen with
dummy's Nine-spot.) North must
simply be careful to cash his own
good Spade (the Jack) before
crossing to dummy to gather in
the Clubs and Diamonds. Game
bid and made in No Trump!
But ... an enraged South
"saved" her partner from what
she saw as impending doom (4 0 0
points to E-W for the first setting
trick and 600 points for each
additional one), by bidding 4 C.
West sat back, unwilling to double
his opponents INTO game after he
had just doubled them OUT of
one. North, irked at his partner
but unwilling to settle short of
game, chose to support South's
first-bid suit and closed out the
bidding (so he hoped) at 5 D.
South had overextended
herself—and North tightened the
noose around the partnership's
neck.
Fortunately for South—or so it
seemed at the time— East, now
thoroughly confused and
frightened by finding yet another
North-South contract doubled
and redoubled, decided that SHE
had to "save" the contract by
"sacrificing" at 5 Hearts. (She
figured her partner, whose knee
she promptly felt again, could
further "save" at Spades if his
Hearts were poor.) But there the
contract ended—save for a spiteful
double by South, who, seeing two
sure tricks in her own hand,
resolved to capitalize on East's
overextension.
Unsure about her lead, South
decided to cash the Ace of
trumps—an extremely useful
maneuver under SOME
circumstances, in order to assess
the dummy before launching a
defensive onslaught. West lay
down his hand, took a swipe at
North (who was smirking at the
situation), and stomped off to the
kitchen to prepare the evening
meal.
(The exciting saga of BLT will
continue tomorrow, complete
with a description of the festive
meal.)
