# 'Ofay Watcher' Will Make You Nervous
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
If it's been a while since you
were physically shaken by a play,
1 suggest you take a trip to the
city to see "The Ofay Watcher,"
at the Encore Theater on Mason
Street, just down the block from
the Geary.
The Encore Theater resembles
nothing so much as a poorly lit
basement; in fact, that's what it
is: A cellar converted into a
theater. To get out, you must
climb a steep staircase and after
seeing "The Ofay Watcher," 1
found myself looking very
nervously at the people climbing
that staircase with me. In fact, I
am sure we all felt a lot better
when we were out of the
basement and into the clean, open
air of San Francisco: This is a play
that tends to make you very
nervous.
"The Ofay Watcher" is the first
effort of Frank Cucci, a New
York playwright, and for Opus I it
is very impressive. The plot
concerns a young man from the
Midwest who goes to New York
and there meets his first
"Negroes." Laden with the White
Man's guilt, he decides to do
something for the race problem in
the United States by eliminating
it.
He uses his knowledge of
biochemistry to develop a
concoction that inhibits the
production of melanin by the
body, causing the user to
gradually turn white. This, he is
sure, will be hailed as a Godsend

by American Blacks; in a few
weeks everyone in American will
be white, and there won't be any
more racial tensions.
But Bruce, as the young man is
called, needs someone to use as a
guinea pig. He knows the stuff is
safe, because he takes it himself;
but he needs a black man in order
to see any effects. He chooses a
Bowery bum named Rufus, whom
he finds sleeping on a park bench.
Rufus is not an ordinary bum, just
how extraordinary he is becomes
clear as the play progresses.
"The Ofay Watcher" is a play
that achieves its effect by
suddenly changing mood. It starts
out as a comedy; Bruce is an
incredibly naive white liberal,
Rufus is, shall we say, a
pragmatist, out to get what he can
from Bruce, be it cigarettes, a
bottle of wine, or new skin. It is a
rather absurd situation, and Mr.
Cucci has spiced the dialogue with
some very funny, albeit obvious,
jokes.
But someplace about halfway
through the third scene (the play
is a long one-act) the jokes start to
disappear, and threatening doubts
begin to take their place. You are
slowly convinced that all is not as
it seems, all is not right. By the
end of the play, nobody is
laughing.
It is easy to read more into this
play than is there. One is tempted
to think of it as an allegory, and 1
suspect that Mr. Cucci had
something allegorical in mind
when he wrote it. All of the
symbols are there: White guilt.

Black pride, the Bourgeois Negro,
etc. For example, when Rufus
the down-and-out Black meets
Daisy, Bruce's very chic, very
Establishment black girl friend,
the sparks fly, and Bruce and the
rest of us outsiders stand aside
while they have at it. Certainly
this is a commentary on modern
America, but if you try to go any
deeper, to read any more into it,
the play founders.
Basically, this is really a
contrived, mechanical play. That's
OK, because its a good, contrived,
mechanical play. Taken as a story,
and not much more, it's very
effective theater. When you try
analyzing the characters or the
situation too much, it begins to
fall apart. But for an evening in
the city, and no more, it is just
fine.
The cast of three was

dominated by Leonard Simon as
Rufus. He acted circles around
Jim Brady and Elaine Jackson as
Bruce and Daisy. While both Mr.
Brady and Miss Jackson had their
moments, Mr. Simon was
consistently on top of the script
and into the character.
Judith Burgess, lately of the
Stanford Repertory Theater,
directed. She had a lot of
problems to solve, including an
imperfect script and a rather
incredible theater. At first her
directing seemed a bit stiff, but as
the play progressed the directing
seemed to become more alive,
more exciting, as did the play
itself.
The run has been extended
through December 6, and it is
highly recommended to those of
you who don't mind being made a
little nervous.


BitIICF. AND RllFUS—Although Rufus seems to be more interestec
in his sandwich than a new and lily-white skin color, Ihe situatior
changes rapidly in Ihe "Ofav Watcher."

this is a commentary on modern
America, but if you try to go any
deeper, to read any more into it,
the play founders.
Basically, this is really a
contrived, mechanical play. That's
OK, because its a good, contrived,
mechanical play. Taken as a story,
and not much more, it's very
effective theater. When you try
analyzing the characters or the
situation too much, it begins to
fall apart. But for an evening in
the city, and no more, it is just
fine.
The cast of three was

dominated by Leonard Simon as
Rufus. He acted circles around
Jim Brady and Elaine Jackson as
Bruce and Daisy. While both Mr.
Brady and Miss Jackson had their
moments, Mr. Simon was
consistently on top of the script
and into the character.
Judith Burgess, lately of the
Stanford Repertory Theater,
directed. She had a lot of
problems to solve, including an
imperfect script and a rather
incredible theater. At first her
directing seemed a bit stiff, but as
the play progressed the directing
seemed to become more alive,
more exciting, as did the play
itself.
The run has been extended
through December 6, and it is
highly recommended to those of
you who don't mind being made a
little nervous.


BitIICF. AND RllFUS—Although Rufus seems to be more interestec
in his sandwich than a new and lily-white skin color, Ihe situatior
changes rapidly in Ihe "Ofav Watcher."
If it's been a while since you
were physically shaken by a play,
1 suggest you take a trip to the
city to see "The Ofay Watcher,"
at the Encore Theater on Mason
Street, just down the block from
the Geary.
The Encore Theater resembles
nothing so much as a poorly lit
basement; in fact, that's what it
is: A cellar converted into a
theater. To get out, you must
climb a steep staircase and after
seeing "The Ofay Watcher," 1
found myself looking very
nervously at the people climbing
that staircase with me. In fact, I
am sure we all felt a lot better
when we were out of the
basement and into the clean, open
air of San Francisco: This is a play
that tends to make you very
nervous.
"The Ofay Watcher" is the first
effort of Frank Cucci, a New
York playwright, and for Opus I it
is very impressive. The plot
concerns a young man from the
Midwest who goes to New York
and there meets his first
"Negroes." Laden with the White
Man's guilt, he decides to do
something for the race problem in
the United States by eliminating
it.
He uses his knowledge of
biochemistry to develop a
concoction that inhibits the
production of melanin by the
body, causing the user to
gradually turn white. This, he is
sure, will be hailed as a Godsend

by American Blacks; in a few
weeks everyone in American will
be white, and there won't be any
more racial tensions.
But Bruce, as the young man is
called, needs someone to use as a
guinea pig. He knows the stuff is
safe, because he takes it himself;
but he needs a black man in order
to see any effects. He chooses a
Bowery bum named Rufus, whom
he finds sleeping on a park bench.
Rufus is not an ordinary bum, just
how extraordinary he is becomes
clear as the play progresses.
"The Ofay Watcher" is a play
that achieves its effect by
suddenly changing mood. It starts
out as a comedy; Bruce is an
incredibly naive white liberal,
Rufus is, shall we say, a
pragmatist, out to get what he can
from Bruce, be it cigarettes, a
bottle of wine, or new skin. It is a
rather absurd situation, and Mr.
Cucci has spiced the dialogue with
some very funny, albeit obvious,
jokes.
But someplace about halfway
through the third scene (the play
is a long one-act) the jokes start to
disappear, and threatening doubts
begin to take their place. You are
slowly convinced that all is not as
it seems, all is not right. By the
end of the play, nobody is
laughing.
It is easy to read more into this
play than is there. One is tempted
to think of it as an allegory, and 1
suspect that Mr. Cucci had
something allegorical in mind
when he wrote it. All of the
symbols are there: White guilt.

Black pride, the Bourgeois Negro,
etc. For example, when Rufus
the down-and-out Black meets
Daisy, Bruce's very chic, very
Establishment black girl friend,
the sparks fly, and Bruce and the
rest of us outsiders stand aside
while they have at it. Certainly

to see any effects. He chooses a
Bowery bum named Rufus, whom
he finds sleeping on a park bench.
Rufus is not an ordinary bum, just
how extraordinary he is becomes
clear as the play progresses.
"The Ofay Watcher" is a play
that achieves its effect by
suddenly changing mood. It starts
out as a comedy; Bruce is an
incredibly naive white liberal,
Rufus is, shall we say, a
pragmatist, out to get what he can
from Bruce, be it cigarettes, a
bottle of wine, or new skin. It is a
rather absurd situation, and Mr.
Cucci has spiced the dialogue with
some very funny, albeit obvious,
jokes.
But someplace about halfway
through the third scene (the play
is a long one-act) the jokes start to
disappear, and threatening doubts
begin to take their place. You are
slowly convinced that all is not as
it seems, all is not right. By the
end of the play, nobody is
laughing.
It is easy to read more into this
play than is there. One is tempted
to think of it as an allegory, and 1
suspect that Mr. Cucci had
something allegorical in mind
when he wrote it. All of the
symbols are there: White guilt.

Black pride, the Bourgeois Negro,
etc. For example, when Rufus
the down-and-out Black meets
Daisy, Bruce's very chic, very
Establishment black girl friend,
the sparks fly, and Bruce and the
rest of us outsiders stand aside
while they have at it. Certainly
this is a commentary on modern
America, but if you try to go any
deeper, to read any more into it,
the play founders.
Basically, this is really a
contrived, mechanical play. That's
OK, because its a good, contrived,
mechanical play. Taken as a story,
and not much more, it's very
effective theater. When you try
analyzing the characters or the
situation too much, it begins to
fall apart. But for an evening in
the city, and no more, it is just
fine.
The cast of three was

dominated by Leonard Simon as
Rufus. He acted circles around
Jim Brady and Elaine Jackson as
Bruce and Daisy. While both Mr.
Brady and Miss Jackson had their
moments, Mr. Simon was
consistently on top of the script
and into the character.
Judith Burgess, lately of the
Stanford Repertory Theater,
directed. She had a lot of
problems to solve, including an
imperfect script and a rather
incredible theater. At first her
directing seemed a bit stiff, but as
the play progressed the directing
seemed to become more alive,
more exciting, as did the play
itself.
The run has been extended
through December 6, and it is
highly recommended to those of
you who don't mind being made a
little nervous.


BitIICF. AND RllFUS—Although Rufus seems to be more interestec
in his sandwich than a new and lily-white skin color, Ihe situatior
changes rapidly in Ihe "Ofav Watcher."
If it's been a while since you
were physically shaken by a play,
1 suggest you take a trip to the
city to see "The Ofay Watcher,"
at the Encore Theater on Mason
Street, just down the block from
the Geary.
The Encore Theater resembles
nothing so much as a poorly lit
basement; in fact, that's what it
is: A cellar converted into a
theater. To get out, you must
climb a steep staircase and after
seeing "The Ofay Watcher," 1
found myself looking very
nervously at the people climbing
that staircase with me. In fact, I
am sure we all felt a lot better
when we were out of the
basement and into the clean, open
air of San Francisco: This is a play
that tends to make you very
nervous.
"The Ofay Watcher" is the first
effort of Frank Cucci, a New
York playwright, and for Opus I it
is very impressive. The plot
concerns a young man from the
Midwest who goes to New York
and there meets his first
"Negroes." Laden with the White
Man's guilt, he decides to do
something for the race problem in
the United States by eliminating
it.
He uses his knowledge of
biochemistry to develop a
concoction that inhibits the
production of melanin by the
body, causing the user to
gradually turn white. This, he is
sure, will be hailed as a Godsend

by American Blacks; in a few
weeks everyone in American will
be white, and there won't be any
more racial tensions.
But Bruce, as the young man is
called, needs someone to use as a
guinea pig. He knows the stuff is
safe, because he takes it himself;
but he needs a black man in order
to see any effects. He chooses a
Bowery bum named Rufus, whom
he finds sleeping on a park bench.
