# Brubabes Edge Papooses
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
One short week after a
disastrous intra-squad game with
the varsity redshirts, there was
Coach Bill Moultrie's 1970 Frosh
football team, suddenly grown up,
battling to within a point of
upsetting a strong UCLA team last
Friday afternoon 20 -19.
The Papooses put all 19 of
their points on the scoreboard
before going into the dressing
room for the half, scoring first on
a 41 yard touchdown pass from
Mike Gilyerd to his former
teammate from Lincoln High
School in Dallas, Rufus Shaw.
Shaw snared five passes for 161
yards on the afternoon to lead all
Stanford receivers with a 32.2
yard average.
The Tribe came right back the
next time they had the ball,
driving 96 yards for the score as
Jim Ferguson rambled 17 yards
on a trap from his fullback spot
for the touchdown.
Ferguson averaged a healthy
six yards per carry picking up 7 2
yards in a dozen tries. He and
running mate John Winesberry
contributed 155 yards to the

Indians' 4 33 yard offensive
output. Stanford maintained an
89 yard bulge on a UCLA team
billed as one of their most
explosive in recent years.
Winesberry, an outstanding
prospect from Tulsa. Oklahoma,
accounted for the Papooses' third
touchdown when he took a swing
pass from quarterback Eric Test,
and went six yards for the score
behind a convoy of blockers.
"Our offensive line did a
superior job," commented Coach
Moultrie following the game,
"especially on pass protection.
They gave our quarterbacks room
to work."
Test and Gilyerd were
originally slated to alternate at
quarterback, but Test was forced
to go all the way after Gilyerd
twisted his ankle early in the
opening period.
Coach Moultrie praised his
defensive unit which was handed
the difficult assignment of
containing the Bruins' two
James — McAlister and
Upchurch—probably two of the
finest prep runners anywhere last
year.
"I just think we did a really

fine job," said Moultrie. He
singled out linebackers Gordon
Riegel, Jim Jordan and John
Snider as well as defensive backs
Max Goldstein and Randy Poltl as
having had particularly good
games.
Although UCLA came back in
the second half to secure the win,
Moultrie was "pretty pleased"
with his club's showing in its
opening game.
"We've got a lot of work to do
yet," he smiled, "we were a little
late getting started this year but
through a real concerted effort on
the part of the coaching staff and
hard work by the kids, we were

able to turn in a pretty good
showing." UCLA had played once
before their meeting with the
Tribe.
Although smaller in numbers,
this year's freshman team is
physically bigger and stronger
than last year's squad. "Not to
take anything away from last
season's team, I think that this
group of kids has a definite
physical edge. There's some great
potential here," said Moultrie.
The Papooses meet Cal Poly at
Stanford Stadium Friday
afternoon at 2 :00 p.m., looking
for their first win.

OUCH—Football, you know, is a tough game. Everybody hits everybody else hard. It can also be a rough game even when you're not hit by
anybody at all, as the contorted figure of UCLA safety Ron Carver indicates. Carver, at 5 feet 9 inches and 160 pounds isn't exactly one of
the bigger players either. While Carver and the Bruins have started to think about the 197 2 Rose Bowl, Stanford continues its quest for the
19 71 bowl by facing Oregon State Saturday.
