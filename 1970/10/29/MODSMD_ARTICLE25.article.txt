Stanford's club hockey team
drilled in two goals in overtime
Tuesday night to score its first
win of the year in an 8 -6 decision

Will McLivaine scored twice, once
on a rebound and once on a tip-in
to tie the score at the end of
regulation play.

second on an open net—to clinch
the win for Stanford.
The Tribe's record is now 1 -1.
The Hawks took a 3-0 lead
quickly but the Cards battled
back with two goals in 11 seconds
and added a third minutes later to

tie it up.
The first line of Paul Tittmann,
McLivaine and Leonard scored all
eight Stanford goals. Leonard and
Tittmann each made a hat
trick—three goals—and McLivaine
added the other two.

defense broke the puck out
efficiently and played aggressively
in the corners.
Next Monday the Indians play
California at Leg's Arena at
Fourth and Mission Streets in San
