## About Spirits 
### 
The following esoteric exercise was submitted by a member of
Stanford's cross country team who thinks it partially explains the
Tribe's success this season.
Captain Don Kardong stood huddled over his locker, nervously
fiddling with the combination. His running companion and teammate,
Arvid Kretz, waited for what Flash (as Don is known) would say
about their workout that afternoon.
"I think 1 feel the Spirit of Woodside, coming on," Don
announced.
"But we have to race on Saturday," Kretz warned.
"And we're gonna be tough," Flash replied.
Just who is the Spirit of Woodside, anyway? you might ask.
And with good reason, for it is the driving force behind all real
distance runners. However, even the seasoned veterans of the Stanford
cross country team falter at answering such a question. They're not
exactly sure why 14 miles of hilly asphalt holds such powers, either.
Could fun and fulfillment come from the masochistic act itself?
Coach Marshall Clark will say, "You're not taking the whole team
with you, are you Don?"
Robert Coe during the run: "There's too much cement."
Neil Bernstein: "Watch out for the carnivorous ice plant."
One thinks, though, that the seasoned veterans on the Stanford
team must know more than the tenderfoots and non-runners. One
presumes, too, that during the course of an hour and a half test of will
and endurance the cross country runners got to know each other
pretty well. Maybe even learning to live with personalities that don't
normally co-exist.
One set's when watching the Stanford team that they know how to
stick together. "It's more fun," says Kardong. "Who wants to run 1 4
miles of bad road by himself every Wednesday?" (Don averages 100
miles per week.)
Says Pete Fitzmauriee eight miles out: "I feel like something's
pounding on my legs."
"That's the great monster of Woodside," Don answers.
"You made thai up," Hick Oeisler jabs Don.
"1 made up the thing about thr Spirit of Woodside, too," Don
answers, "but it's just as real."
