## A 						Special Surprise 
### ROBERT MARKS 
Leave it to the Theta Delts.
They won their first two games of
the season by a combined score of
70 to 0. They crushed their
opponents with a strong passing
attack and tough defensive play.
They looked like a big, strong,
no-nonsense team. So, on their
first play of their game last
Monday against the Alpha Delts,
Quarterback Mike Waltop took
the ball and rolled to his left. A
simple end sweep, for sure. But
wait, for here was Walton handing
the ball to Paul Ormand, who was
streaking in the opposite
direction. Oh, those clever Delts,
starting the game with an
unexpected reverse.
But that's not all: Ormand held
the ball only long enough to give
it to Dave Chambers, who then
stopped and threw to left end
Harry White far downfield. White
gathered the ball in at the 10 and
romped into the endzone, thus
completing the first triple reverse
pass for a touchdown this year.
The Delts had little trouble
finishing off the bewildered Alpha
Delts, 27-0.
After the game, quarterback
Walton admitted that the play was
not of his own invention. "It
came from my high school
play book," he admitted. "I
noticed from their game films that
their right safety was coming up
quickly against the run, so it was
the only thing to do."
In other games Monday, the
Zetes, with Rob Towner scoring
three times, crushed the Dekes,
4 0-0; SAE topped Kappa Sigma,
25-0; Sigma Chi outscored Alpha
Sigma, 19-6; Biz II defeated
Nemesis, 9-0; and, Cedro beat
Arroyo in overtime, 12-6.
Tuesday was interception day,
as two teams used long runbacks
to spark their victories. Bill

Lippitt picked one off on his own
two yard line and ran 78 yards for
Madera's only score as they edged
Trancos, 7-6. Dan Tomlinson
gathered in his theft in his own
end zone and, behind a crushing
block by Palleson that took out 3
men, went all the way to lead his
Burbank team to an 18-6 win over
Soto. In other games Tuesday,
Durand blasted Gavilan, 25-6 , and
the zany Zaps flew to their second
win, 26-0 over Branner.

They looked like a big, strong,
no-nonsense team. So, on their
first play of their game last
Monday against the Alpha Delts,
Quarterback Mike Waltop took
the ball and rolled to his left. A
simple end sweep, for sure. But
wait, for here was Walton handing
the ball to Paul Ormand, who was
streaking in the opposite
direction. Oh, those clever Delts,
starting the game with an
unexpected reverse.
But that's not all: Ormand held
the ball only long enough to give
it to Dave Chambers, who then
stopped and threw to left end
Harry White far downfield. White
gathered the ball in at the 10 and
romped into the endzone, thus
completing the first triple reverse
pass for a touchdown this year.
The Delts had little trouble
finishing off the bewildered Alpha
Delts, 27-0.
After the game, quarterback
Walton admitted that the play was
not of his own invention. "It
came from my high school
play book," he admitted. "I
noticed from their game films that
their right safety was coming up
quickly against the run, so it was
the only thing to do."
In other games Monday, the
Zetes, with Rob Towner scoring
three times, crushed the Dekes,
4 0-0; SAE topped Kappa Sigma,
25-0; Sigma Chi outscored Alpha
Sigma, 19-6; Biz II defeated
Nemesis, 9-0; and, Cedro beat
Arroyo in overtime, 12-6.
Tuesday was interception day,
as two teams used long runbacks
to spark their victories. Bill

Lippitt picked one off on his own
two yard line and ran 78 yards for
Madera's only score as they edged
Trancos, 7-6. Dan Tomlinson
gathered in his theft in his own
end zone and, behind a crushing
block by Palleson that took out 3
men, went all the way to lead his
Burbank team to an 18-6 win over
Soto. In other games Tuesday,
Durand blasted Gavilan, 25-6 , and
the zany Zaps flew to their second
win, 26-0 over Branner.
Leave it to the Theta Delts.
They won their first two games of
the season by a combined score of
70 to 0. They crushed their
opponents with a strong passing
attack and tough defensive play.
