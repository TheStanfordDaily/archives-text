# Rose Bowl Tickets: Another Month Yet
## 
### 
Authentic students concerned
about buying Rose Bowl tickets
apparently need not
worry—yet- it. was learned
yesterday.
"If Stanford is in the bowl,
there will be tickets sold through
the Stanford athletic office," a
spokesman for the Pac-8 San
Francisco headquarters said
yesterday.
Tickets normally go on sale
during the second week of
December and students will
probably have to present
legitimate student body cards, he
said.
Tickets are not handled by the
league office but will come to the
university directly from the Hose

Bowl. The league official said he
assumed that roughly 10,000
student tickets would go on sale.
He wasn't positive about ticket
prices but said he thought student
tickets would be $4 each. Regular
price is $8 each, he said.
All this is assuming, of course,
that Stanford wins two of its
remaining three league games and
is the Pac-8 representative to the
Rose Bowl.
Should Stanford be declared
the bowl representative before the
California game- by beating
Oregon State and Washington the
Pac-8 official said the tickets
might be sent to the university by
the beginning of December.
The Daily will provide exact
details as soon as possible.
