# Peaceful Demonstrations Planned For Nixon Visit
## 
### 
President and Mrs. Nixon will arrive
in San Jose at 6:4 0 this evening with
Gov. Ronald Reagan and Sen. George
Murphy at the airport to greet them.
The group will proceed to a Republican
rally in the San Jose auditorium. Six
thousand persons are expected to
attend.
Nixon is currently on a 10-state
campaign swing in an effort to help
Republican candidates across the
country before Tuesday's elections.
The rally in the auditorium,
however, is not the only political
activity being planned for Nixon's
arrival.
Radical groups are planning a rally
for 5 :30 at 7 th and San Carlos Streets
in San Jose.
An article in yesterday's Daily
quoted radical Jane Franklin of the Bay
Area Revolutionary Union as saying
that "a riot will begin at 5:30 at 7 th
and San Carlos Streets in San Jose."
However Mrs. Franklin yesterday stated
that in her conversations with the
Daily, she had used the word "rally"
and not "riot" (see Letters to the
Editor).
Among the groups expected at the
radical rally are the San Jose Liberation

Front, the SDS, and the Revolutionary
Action Movement (RAM).
A number of labor unions will also
be on hand to greet Nixon with
picketing. Among them will be the
Painters Union, the Machinists Union,
the U.A.W. and several others. The
unions are also planning a soup kitchen
and apple-selling stand, 1930's style, in
order to dramatize the fact that
unemployment in Santa Clara County
is 2 percent above the national average.
Many engineers, unemployed
because of major layoffs in the
aerospace industry, are also expected to
be among those picketing.
Supporters of Congressional
candidate Stuart McLean will be
present in what McLean campaign
headquarters has called a "Cool-it
Squad." This squad will leaflet and try
to discourage any violence in the
demonstrating.
The rally in the San Jose auditorium
will begin at 6 p.m. with Nixon
scheduled to speak at 7.
At 7:45 Nixon is scheduled to
depart for San Clemente and he will
then appear at another rally for
Murphy in Anaheim on Friday.

Painters Union, the Machinists Union,
the U.A.W. and several others. The
unions are also planning a soup kitchen
and apple-selling stand, 1930's style, in
order to dramatize the fact that
unemployment in Santa Clara County
is 2 percent above the national average.
Many engineers, unemployed
because of major layoffs in the
aerospace industry, are also expected to
be among those picketing.
Supporters of Congressional
candidate Stuart McLean will be
present in what McLean campaign
headquarters has called a "Cool-it
Squad." This squad will leaflet and try
to discourage any violence in the
demonstrating.
The rally in the San Jose auditorium
will begin at 6 p.m. with Nixon
scheduled to speak at 7.
At 7:45 Nixon is scheduled to
depart for San Clemente and he will
then appear at another rally for
Murphy in Anaheim on Friday.
