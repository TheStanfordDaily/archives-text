Hanoi May Respond
WASHINGTON — Official U.S. sources say they have
received hints from third parties that North Vietnam is
seriously interested in private negotiations on President
Nixon's peace proposal for Indochina including a standstill
cease-fire.
The third parties were not identified but the American
officials said it is their belief that Hanoi has found the
cease-fire suggestion intriguing.
Noting that the dry season is now beginning in large
areas of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, the American
sources said there are three options from which Hanoi may
choose:
A major military effort involving high-risk operations.
All supplies for such an operation would have to be sent
over the Ho Chi Minh trail through southern Laos since the
Communist supply route by sea through Cambodia has
been closed.
—The opposite extreme-negotiating an Indochina peace
settlement at the Paris talks.
—Low-cost, protracted guerrilla warfare of the kind
advocated by Communist China's leader Mao Tse-Tung.
The American officials said that between the choice of
protracted war or negotiations, there is a significant
possibility that negotiations would be the Communist
choice.
Poison Warning Issued
BERKELEY — Mercury content in fish native to San
Francisco Bay and Sacramento River Delta waters is high
enough to cause mental retardation in unborn children, a
federal state environmental task force warned Wednesday.
Citing the deaths of hundreds of persons from nervous
system disorders stemming from similar fish poisonings in
Japan during the 195 o 's, Dr. Ephraim Kahn of the
California Health Department said no poisoning cases have
been reported here yet, "but we are concerned about the
possibility."
He said fish—especially striped bass and channel catfish
should be eaten no more than once a week by anyone, and
not at all by expectant mothers.
Mercury, Kahn said, is more toxic in unborn children as
it is attracted to the fetus when it enters the human body.
Jordan Government Changes
AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan formed a new government
last night under an anti-guerrilla prime minister.
The new Jordanian prime minister, Wasfi Tell, is a
veteran politician staunchly loyal to King Hussein and
strongly opposed to activities of Palestinian guerrillas. He
heads Jordan's third government in six weeks.

• I
Reports described him as an "extreme rightist" and a
"severe executer of internal policy."
Tell, who served in the British army after World War II
and last was prime minister in 1966, was known for his
opposition to the policies of Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser.
Abrams And My Lai
ATLANTA, Ga. — Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, commander
of U.S. Army forces in Vietnam, was charged yesterday by
a defendant in the My Lai case with violating the military
code by allowing the beating and torture of civilians at a
South Vietnamese village in 1 968.
Sgt. Esequiel Torres also charged the four-star general
with conealing a felony committed by troops in his
presence at the village of Chanh Luu.
Attorney Charles L. Weltner, a former Georgia
congressman, filed the charges on behalf of Torres in a
petition to Army Secretary Stanley R. Resor.
Nixon Aids Murphy
SAN JOSE — Democratic Senate candidate John
Tunney charged Wednesday that President Nixon plans to
announce a major aerospace contract award to a California
firm to give U.S. Sen. George Murphy, Tunney's
Republican opponent, a "political boost."
Tunney called "cynical and contrived" an anticipated
announcement that the contract to build an international
fighter plane will be granted one of three California firms
General Dynamics, Lockheed or Northrup.
And T\inney stuck by another aerospace prediction
made Wednesday, that the White House has "secretly
approved" plans to shut down after the Nov. 3 election the
Ames Space Research Center at Sunnyvale, putting 3,000
aerospace workers out of jobs. NASA denied closure plans
ex ist.
Tunney said he hoped that charge would pressure
Nixon—coming to California to campaign for Tunney's
opponent—to reconsider and keep open the Ames NASA
center at Sunnyvale.
"I stick by my sources," Tunney said, "The fact that
top officials who are political appointees deny it means
absolutely nothing to me."
As he entered the last days of the campaign Tunney
repeatedly lashed Murphy for resorting to newspaper ads
Tunny termed "political pornography."
While expressing hope Nixon's visits are unmarred by
incident Tunney predicted the president's coattails won't
rescue his 68-year-old foe.
"All the President's horses and all the President's men
can't put George Murphy's campaign together again," the
36-year-old Riverside Congressman told aerospace workers
at the Aerojet-General Corp.'s Sacramento plant.

The third parties were not identified but the American
officials said it is their belief that Hanoi has found the
cease-fire suggestion intriguing.
Noting that the dry season is now beginning in large
areas of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, the American
sources said there are three options from which Hanoi may
choose:
A major military effort involving high-risk operations.
All supplies for such an operation would have to be sent
over the Ho Chi Minh trail through southern Laos since the
Communist supply route by sea through Cambodia has
been closed.
—The opposite extreme-negotiating an Indochina peace
settlement at the Paris talks.
—Low-cost, protracted guerrilla warfare of the kind
advocated by Communist China's leader Mao Tse-Tung.
The American officials said that between the choice of
protracted war or negotiations, there is a significant
possibility that negotiations would be the Communist
choice.
Poison Warning Issued
BERKELEY — Mercury content in fish native to San
Francisco Bay and Sacramento River Delta waters is high
enough to cause mental retardation in unborn children, a
federal state environmental task force warned Wednesday.
Citing the deaths of hundreds of persons from nervous
system disorders stemming from similar fish poisonings in
Japan during the 195 o 's, Dr. Ephraim Kahn of the
California Health Department said no poisoning cases have
been reported here yet, "but we are concerned about the
possibility."
He said fish—especially striped bass and channel catfish
should be eaten no more than once a week by anyone, and
not at all by expectant mothers.
Mercury, Kahn said, is more toxic in unborn children as
it is attracted to the fetus when it enters the human body.
Jordan Government Changes
AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan formed a new government
last night under an anti-guerrilla prime minister.
The new Jordanian prime minister, Wasfi Tell, is a
veteran politician staunchly loyal to King Hussein and
strongly opposed to activities of Palestinian guerrillas. He
heads Jordan's third government in six weeks.

• I
Reports described him as an "extreme rightist" and a
"severe executer of internal policy."
Tell, who served in the British army after World War II
and last was prime minister in 1966, was known for his
opposition to the policies of Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser.
Abrams And My Lai
ATLANTA, Ga. — Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, commander
of U.S. Army forces in Vietnam, was charged yesterday by
a defendant in the My Lai case with violating the military
code by allowing the beating and torture of civilians at a
South Vietnamese village in 1 968.
Sgt. Esequiel Torres also charged the four-star general
with conealing a felony committed by troops in his
presence at the village of Chanh Luu.
Attorney Charles L. Weltner, a former Georgia
congressman, filed the charges on behalf of Torres in a
petition to Army Secretary Stanley R. Resor.
Nixon Aids Murphy
SAN JOSE — Democratic Senate candidate John
Tunney charged Wednesday that President Nixon plans to
announce a major aerospace contract award to a California
firm to give U.S. Sen. George Murphy, Tunney's
Republican opponent, a "political boost."
Tunney called "cynical and contrived" an anticipated
announcement that the contract to build an international
fighter plane will be granted one of three California firms
General Dynamics, Lockheed or Northrup.
And T\inney stuck by another aerospace prediction
made Wednesday, that the White House has "secretly
approved" plans to shut down after the Nov. 3 election the
Ames Space Research Center at Sunnyvale, putting 3,000
aerospace workers out of jobs. NASA denied closure plans
ex ist.
Tunney said he hoped that charge would pressure
Nixon—coming to California to campaign for Tunney's
opponent—to reconsider and keep open the Ames NASA
center at Sunnyvale.
"I stick by my sources," Tunney said, "The fact that
top officials who are political appointees deny it means
absolutely nothing to me."
As he entered the last days of the campaign Tunney
repeatedly lashed Murphy for resorting to newspaper ads
Tunny termed "political pornography."
While expressing hope Nixon's visits are unmarred by
incident Tunney predicted the president's coattails won't
rescue his 68-year-old foe.
"All the President's horses and all the President's men
can't put George Murphy's campaign together again," the
36-year-old Riverside Congressman told aerospace workers
at the Aerojet-General Corp.'s Sacramento plant.

choose:
A major military effort involving high-risk operations.
All supplies for such an operation would have to be sent
over the Ho Chi Minh trail through southern Laos since the
Communist supply route by sea through Cambodia has
been closed.
—The opposite extreme-negotiating an Indochina peace
settlement at the Paris talks.
—Low-cost, protracted guerrilla warfare of the kind
advocated by Communist China's leader Mao Tse-Tung.
The American officials said that between the choice of
protracted war or negotiations, there is a significant
possibility that negotiations would be the Communist
choice.
Poison Warning Issued
BERKELEY — Mercury content in fish native to San
Francisco Bay and Sacramento River Delta waters is high
enough to cause mental retardation in unborn children, a
federal state environmental task force warned Wednesday.
Citing the deaths of hundreds of persons from nervous
system disorders stemming from similar fish poisonings in
Japan during the 195 o 's, Dr. Ephraim Kahn of the
California Health Department said no poisoning cases have
been reported here yet, "but we are concerned about the
possibility."
He said fish—especially striped bass and channel catfish
should be eaten no more than once a week by anyone, and
not at all by expectant mothers.
Mercury, Kahn said, is more toxic in unborn children as
it is attracted to the fetus when it enters the human body.
Jordan Government Changes
AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan formed a new government
last night under an anti-guerrilla prime minister.
The new Jordanian prime minister, Wasfi Tell, is a
veteran politician staunchly loyal to King Hussein and
strongly opposed to activities of Palestinian guerrillas. He
heads Jordan's third government in six weeks.

• I
Reports described him as an "extreme rightist" and a
"severe executer of internal policy."
Tell, who served in the British army after World War II
and last was prime minister in 1966, was known for his
opposition to the policies of Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser.
Abrams And My Lai
ATLANTA, Ga. — Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, commander
of U.S. Army forces in Vietnam, was charged yesterday by
a defendant in the My Lai case with violating the military
code by allowing the beating and torture of civilians at a
South Vietnamese village in 1 968.
Sgt. Esequiel Torres also charged the four-star general
with conealing a felony committed by troops in his
presence at the village of Chanh Luu.
Attorney Charles L. Weltner, a former Georgia
congressman, filed the charges on behalf of Torres in a
petition to Army Secretary Stanley R. Resor.
Nixon Aids Murphy
SAN JOSE — Democratic Senate candidate John
Tunney charged Wednesday that President Nixon plans to
announce a major aerospace contract award to a California
firm to give U.S. Sen. George Murphy, Tunney's
Republican opponent, a "political boost."
Tunney called "cynical and contrived" an anticipated
announcement that the contract to build an international
fighter plane will be granted one of three California firms
General Dynamics, Lockheed or Northrup.
And T\inney stuck by another aerospace prediction
made Wednesday, that the White House has "secretly
approved" plans to shut down after the Nov. 3 election the
Ames Space Research Center at Sunnyvale, putting 3,000
aerospace workers out of jobs. NASA denied closure plans
ex ist.
Tunney said he hoped that charge would pressure
Nixon—coming to California to campaign for Tunney's
opponent—to reconsider and keep open the Ames NASA
center at Sunnyvale.
"I stick by my sources," Tunney said, "The fact that
top officials who are political appointees deny it means
absolutely nothing to me."
As he entered the last days of the campaign Tunney
repeatedly lashed Murphy for resorting to newspaper ads
Tunny termed "political pornography."
While expressing hope Nixon's visits are unmarred by
incident Tunney predicted the president's coattails won't
rescue his 68-year-old foe.
"All the President's horses and all the President's men
can't put George Murphy's campaign together again," the
36-year-old Riverside Congressman told aerospace workers
at the Aerojet-General Corp.'s Sacramento plant.
