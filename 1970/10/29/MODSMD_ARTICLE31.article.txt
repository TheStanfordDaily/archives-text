# Lockheed Draws Protest
## Recruiter Picketed 
### 
Two small groups of demonstrators
including New Left Students and
unemployed engineers gathered outside
the Placement Center to picket
Lockheed recruiting on campus
yesterday.
A dozen members of the New Left
Project (NLP) gathered outside the
building shortly after 1 p.m. to leaflet
and picket. Later a smaller number of
former Lockheed engineers arrived to
picket and talk to people in small
groups.
The engineers' demonstration,
sponsored by the Scientists and
Engineers for Social and Political
Action, was smaller than planned. The
engineers broke into small groups and
talked to passers-by until the late
afternoon.
One picket had worked for
Lockheed on campus, and said he "was
blackballed by the bastards" three
years ago. "They gave me a raise two
months before they fired me," he said.
Another former engineer, a member
of Professional Employment Search
Cooperative (PESC), carried a sign that
said, "Don't Become an Aero-Brasero."

One engineer who had worked for
Aerojet said that the purpose of the
demonstration was "to point out that
there are drawbacks in aerospace."
Another picket standing near him
admitted that carrying signs was not
his line of work. "My experience is in
the field of reliability engineering and
spacecraft, and electrical systems," he
said. He had been writing F-11l
manuals before he was laid off.
"Apparently, they decided that
since fewer planes were being made, the
manuals needed to be less complete, so
I was fired," he said.
"We want to bring word to students
about the disadvantages of working in
aerospace. After you've been in
aerospace, commercial firms won't hire
you," he added.
"We'd like to see the aerospace
companies going into things we feel are
more needed—such as transit systems
and pollution control. We have the
experienced people to do this work,
and they're not doing it."
Earlier in the afternoon, a crowd of
more than 100 listened to several NLP
speakers talk about Lockheed's

projects. One protestor, calling himself
"General Dynamics," claimed that the
interviewer had left campus because he
"was afraid to come back and face the
demonstrators."
Ralph W. Keller, director of the
Placement Center, told the Daily that
the Lockheed representative had been
called back to his office at 10 :45 for an
emergency, which Mr. Keller admitted
"didn't look so good." The recruiter
later returned at 1:20 to complete his
schedule.
By the time the second speaker,
Howard Franklin, began, 110 people
had gathered to listen. He is a member
of the Lockheed Project, formed during
the student strike last spring. The
Project has had three meetings inside
Lockheed, he said, and "is talking to
people about making their lives more
meaningful and relating their work to
their experience."
The third speaker was Bill Evers
from the NLP. He gave an illustrated
lecture on "The New Lockheed
Profile" and "Education at Lockheed,"
magazines that Lockheed uses in its
recruiting.

Ralph W. Keller, director of the
Placement Center, told the Daily that
the Lockheed representative had been
called back to his office at 10 :45 for an
emergency, which Mr. Keller admitted
"didn't look so good." The recruiter
later returned at 1:20 to complete his
schedule.
By the time the second speaker,
Howard Franklin, began, 110 people
had gathered to listen. He is a member
of the Lockheed Project, formed during
the student strike last spring. The
Project has had three meetings inside
Lockheed, he said, and "is talking to
people about making their lives more
meaningful and relating their work to
their experience."
The third speaker was Bill Evers
from the NLP. He gave an illustrated
lecture on "The New Lockheed
Profile" and "Education at Lockheed,"
magazines that Lockheed uses in its
recruiting.

GENERAL DYNAMICS-A uniformed "officer," calling himself General Dynamics and wearing cardboard ribbons and tinfoil
stars, addressed the crowd at a noon demonstration outside the Placement Center protesting Lockheed's recruiting on
campus. General Dynamics's speech was described by one observer as "verbal napalm."
Two small groups of demonstrators
including New Left Students and
unemployed engineers gathered outside
the Placement Center to picket
Lockheed recruiting on campus
yesterday.
A dozen members of the New Left
Project (NLP) gathered outside the
building shortly after 1 p.m. to leaflet
and picket. Later a smaller number of
former Lockheed engineers arrived to
picket and talk to people in small
groups.
The engineers' demonstration,
sponsored by the Scientists and
Engineers for Social and Political
Action, was smaller than planned. The
engineers broke into small groups and
talked to passers-by until the late
afternoon.
One picket had worked for
Lockheed on campus, and said he "was
blackballed by the bastards" three
years ago. "They gave me a raise two
months before they fired me," he said.
Another former engineer, a member
of Professional Employment Search
Cooperative (PESC), carried a sign that
said, "Don't Become an Aero-Brasero."

One engineer who had worked for
Aerojet said that the purpose of the
demonstration was "to point out that
there are drawbacks in aerospace."
Another picket standing near him
admitted that carrying signs was not
his line of work. "My experience is in
the field of reliability engineering and
spacecraft, and electrical systems," he
said. He had been writing F-11l
manuals before he was laid off.
"Apparently, they decided that
since fewer planes were being made, the
manuals needed to be less complete, so
I was fired," he said.
"We want to bring word to students
about the disadvantages of working in
aerospace. After you've been in
aerospace, commercial firms won't hire
you," he added.
"We'd like to see the aerospace
companies going into things we feel are
more needed—such as transit systems
and pollution control. We have the
experienced people to do this work,
and they're not doing it."
Earlier in the afternoon, a crowd of
more than 100 listened to several NLP
speakers talk about Lockheed's

projects. One protestor, calling himself
"General Dynamics," claimed that the
interviewer had left campus because he
"was afraid to come back and face the
demonstrators."
