# Varied Organizations Attack Area Housing Crisis
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Fourth In A Series
Many organizations are involved in
trying to help solve the mid-peninsula
housing problem. Some, such as the
League of Women Voters, are
primarily concerned with educational
and lobbying activities. Others, for
example the Urban Coalition, actually
build housing.
Recently, however, another tactic,
that of protest and confrontation, has
entered the picture. The Palo Alto
Tenants Union (PATU) has injected a
radical element into Peninsula housing
advocacy.
As far as making concrete progress,
the Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition has
probably been most successful. The
Coalition, under the direction of
Stanford Trustee Ira Hall, is currently
in charge of developing 200 units of
low and moderate income housing on
University lands, another 32 units in
Mountain View, and is co-sponsoring a
development of 60 units in Palo Alto.
Hall says that he is glad more people
are beginning to recognize the housing
shortage as a major problem. "We're
making a lot of progress," he says, "But
people can't live in progress, only in
houses. It's easy to talk in terms of
progress, but to all the concerned
groups I say you have to do something
concrete."
Housing Corporation
The Coalition is presently in the
process of creating a housing
corporation which can coordinate and
offer assistance to other groups which
may want to build housing. The
functions of the corporation will be
threefold. First it will have a
professional staff to help design
housing projects and take care of the
involved packaging necessary in making
a proposal before the Federal Housing
Authority.
Second the corporation will
establish a loan fund from which
money can be borrowed to pay for the
high initial costs of development.

Finally, a land bank will be set up to
buy land which can then be kept for
use in future projects.
The Coalition has raised nearly all
the money it needs for the housing
corporation and has already filed the
papers for incorporation. The
Coalition's biggest concern now is to
make its present projects successful and
thus show the community that
low-moderate income housing can be
built.
Palo Alto Tenants' Union
The Palo Alto Tenants' Union takes
a different perspective. It is trying to
stop evictions and destruction of
residential neighborhoods in Palo Alto.
According to President Jean Hobson,
"the Union was formed in June as a
neighborhood response to the large
number of evictions which came down
from Hare, Brewer and Kelly."
Throughout the summer the PATU
actively participated in City Council
meetings using a confrontation tactic
which met mixed results. According to
League of Women Voters member
Alice Smith, "The PATU was an
invaluable help this summer. They were
terrific." Another observer, Janet
Owens of the Mid-Peninsula Citizens
for Fair Housing, commented, "They
certainly were good at keeping things
hot . . . but you take a councilman like
Frank Gallagher; he just isn't going to
be positively influenced by people
using four letter words."
Although the PATU itself feels that
it was highly successful this summer, it
no longer attends the City Council
meetings. The reason, as explained in a
Tenants' Union booklet, is, "The city
political apparatus can no longer be
considered a court of higher appeal."
Period of Re-evaluation
Says Hobson, "The PATU is going
through a period of re-evaluation of our
policies and tactics. We feel that so far
we have done pretty well in getting a
lot of people involved, and what we're
trying to do now is to widen our base."
During registration this fall the

PATU established a "tent city" on
campus. The purpose was to educate
new students to the role the University
has played in causing the housing
problem in Palo Alto.
A PATU leaflet handed out on
campus said, "We have come to
Stanford to demand that the University
stop forcing us from our homes. Our
educational activities today are only
the beginning of our struggle."
Future activities of the union have
not yet been decided upon according to
Hobson. "We are still trying to decide
what tactics to use and how we can be
most effective."
Council of Communes
Part of the PATU has formed a
subgroup known as the Council of
Communes. The group has filed suit in
federal court to have declared
unconstitutional a zoning ordinance
which limits to four the number of
unrelated persons who may live in a
single family dwelling unit in an R-l
residential zone.
A Council leaflet states, "We feel
that decent housing standards can be
maintained by enforcement of other
laws that deal directly with health,
safety, well-being, public nuisances,
etc., and that can be applied equally to
traditional related families and
voluntary families."
An organization similar to the
PATU, the Mountain View Tenants'
Union, has been established in that city
to attempt to control rising rents. One
of the MVTU's first actions was to
picket the Park Imperial apartments
which it charged with "slumlord
management."
League of Women Voters
The Palo Alto League of Women
Voters has been particularly active in
conducting research and educating
people about the housing problem.
According to League member Sue
Mcpherson, "In the sense of housing
su pply, we are agitators, advocates of
low and moderate income housing."
One of the League's hopes is to

prepare people to welcome low and
moderate income housing into their
neighborhoods. Says member Smith,
"Few suburban communities have
addressed themselves as to how to
economically integrate their
community. It is a very tough question,
how to educate people to the point
where they want low and moderate
income housing."
Another important community
organization, especially in the area of
racial discrimination, is the
Mid-Peninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing. Over the past several years,
the MCFH has publicized the housing
shortage, checked complaints of
discrimination to obtain necessary
evidence, and supplied legal assistance
to victims of discrimination.

One of the MCFH's major programs
is a widespread auditing of apartments
in the mid-peninsula to check if they
are practicing discrimination or not.
The auditing procedure involves
sending two persons, a black and a
white, separately, to an apartment.
They both present the manager with
the same background, and the results
are compared.
For buildings where auditing
indicates no discrimination, MCFH
sends the manager a form letter which
is designed to notify him of the
auditing program, and urge his
continued support of open housing. In
cases where discrimination is
discovered, the owner of the building is
contacted and is urged to correct the
situation.

A program which this summer
uncovered 4 1 percent discrimination at
apartments in Mountain View led to
increased cooperation between the
MCKH and the apartment owners,
according to MCFH fair housing
director Marilyn Nybord. She
anticipates, however, that in other
mid-peninsula cities where the program
is being expanded legal recourse may be
necessary.
The organizations described above
are just a few of the very many which
are involved in the housing problem in
the area. A recent South Bay Regional
Housing Conference listed 80
sponsoring organizations including
diverse views ranging from La
Confederacion de la Raza Unida to the
Bank of America.
