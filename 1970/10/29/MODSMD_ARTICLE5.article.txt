## Bombings.. Which Way America? 
### 
Nicholas von hoffman
What would you do if your doorbell rang at 3 o'clock some
morning, and when you went to answer it there this person,
recognizable as an acquaintance or friend, standing there, looking at
you saying, "Hide me! I've just blown up a police station."
Very few of us will ever be unlucky enough to be put in that
position directly, but many, many of us are put in it conversationally.
All the time people are talking about the Revolution — no longer
about the Movement — all the time they're talking about the
bombings, Angela Davis, the shootings all the time they're soliciting us
to declare we approve of it even if we can't exactly make ourselves
join in.
There are a lot of pressures on many of us to assent.
There are so many whispered, admiring conversations about
righteous cats into heavy business, and no one argues about it. It's
taken for granted that it's okay.
The more difficult-to-resist pressure comes from within, from a
hatred of the kind of person who won't live what he believes.
New Consciousness
Charles A. Reich, in a very fine article called "The Greening of
America" (New Yorker, Sept. 26, 1970) says that people who think
this way partake of a new consciousness, one that "does not think
much of fighting for change from the comfort of personal security
and elegance. He feels if he is to be true to himself he must respond
with himself. If he is deeply committed he may take a job teaching in
a ghetto school, which offers neither prestige nor comfort but offers
the satisfaction of personal contact with ghetto children. He does not
assume that he can fight society while luxuriating in its benefits. He
must take risks — the risk of economic loss, of discomfort, of physical
injury, of a jail sentence. The liberal can be detached, cool,
intellectual, cynical; he fights with his head. (The new consciousness)
is more apt to feel visceral outrage at the ugliness of a freeway or the
misery of a slum."
This is the tug of the Weatherman myth; the supreme, unto-death
refusal to act and live powerlessly when individual impotence and
powerlessness is the most universally shared social perception. Reich
expresses it well, calling America one vast, terrifying anti-community.
He says, "We seem to be living in a society that no one created and
that no one wants. The feeling of powerlessness extends even to the
inhabitants of executive offices."
Tool of Resistance
The bomb, then, is thought of as the tool of resistance in a society
which can legally and constitutionally deprive you of food, shelter
and clothing unless you talk, dress and live in a manner suitable to the
interlocking, corporate units we all work for. But this said, is the
justification for the trashing, the bombing, shooting and the kidnaping
that the FBI thinks, with good reason, is to come?
The answer to that question is an unqualified No on all grounds. We
must examine the grounds and not give a vague, nodding approval to
these acts because they don't injure us personally, and it's all far away
and distant, and anyhow we don't personally know anyone who's into
high explosives. That's exactly how a lot of people hav? supported the
Vietnam disaster.
No Revolution
The tactical grounds for saying no are simple. These may be
revolutionary acts, but they're not acts in a revolution. There is not

now nor will there be in the foreseeable future an armed revolution in
the United States. The bombings will only incite a lot of calamitous
legislation which will be enforced with the panic and bad judgment
that springs from fear.
There are other and higher reasons for saying No. If we deny that
this government has the right to waltz into southeast Asia and
pronounce summary judgment on the people and property there,
where do any of us get the right to do it here? Does ardent belief in
certain principles issue any of us a permit to bomb and kill?
One of the more recent incidents was the bombing of a library at
Harvard. The bombers are purported to have said they did it because
the Nixon Administration uses the books there in carrying out foreign
policy. What kind of rubbish is this? We ought to be grateful the
Nixon Administration has taken to reading books, even Zap Komiks.
After the terrible experiences that have belonged to successive
generations of this century we should have learned the means always
shape the ends. Whatever end is accomplished by means of murder
and explosions will be inherently murderous.

Usually when people ask me about "the bombings," I think of
Laos or Vietnam. Nevertheless, the questions which have arisen about
Weatherman-style bombings within the U.S. are ones radicals should
be prepared to answer. Morally, I find acts of sabotage easy to justify.
The real question, however, is whether bombings—or kidnappings—can
help build a better society. Bombing, in itself, is no political strategy.
Combined with education, organization, and mass action, however, it
can help win our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Early in the Vietnam War, American leaders established the
principle of reciprocity. If the U.S. were to stop bombing the DRVN,
then the North Vietnamese would have to pull out of Southern
Vietnam. American leaders also announced the principle of "no
sanctuary," meaning that U.S. planes could bomb any guerrilla staging
or supply area.
