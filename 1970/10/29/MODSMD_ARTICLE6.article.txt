## Will Elephants Eat It? 
### 
The struggle for GOP control of the Senate in the 92 nd Congress
began early in 1 970 as Republican tacticians took aim at the seats of
liberal Democrats elected in 1958 and 1 964. The Democrats currently
hold 55 Senate seats, the Republicans 43, and nominally Democratic
independents (Dodd of Connecticut and Byrd of Virginia) the
remaining two. Byrd's seat my be crucial if the GOP gains six
Democratic seats and can induce the archconservative Virginian to
vote with them to organize the Senate; Republicans would hold a
51-50 party advantage with the vote of Vice-President Agnew.
Originally, the GOP threatened to gain more than six posts.
However, the Democrats have strengthened their position with the
voters, upset over the economic slump and the Nixon
Administration's spotty record. The Democrats should hold their
losses to one or two seats, and they may even score a net gain of one
to three.
Despite public apathy about this year's mid-term elections, the
Senate races provide an interesting cross-section of candidates, issues,
and ideologies. Vice-President Agnew's knee-in-the-groin style of
campaigning for GOP candidates has merely raised the fall's political
decibel level. The President has now hit the tiail, suggesting that the
Democrats are responsible for America's pornography and crime.
Nixon will be watching the returns on November 3, and he will
probably be chagrined if most of the Senate's perplexing "radic-libs"
win, despite his own energetic work on the hustings.
Connecticut's battle is three-sided, with Democrat Joe Duffey and
Republican Lowell Weicker leading incumbent Democrat Thomas
Dodd, who is running as an independent after his repudiation by the
Democrats. A minister and a long time dove on Vietnam, Duffey has
obtained enough labor support to hold a slim lead over Weicker.
Weicker, a well-heeled moderate, hardly resembles the Nixon-Agnew
wing of the GOP in philosophy or campaign method. Dodd's last term
in the Senate has been marred by corruption, excessive drinking, and
illness; the Senator should run third in this year's race, receiving the
votes of the Right for his rigidly hawkish views on foreign policy but
losing badly among all other groups.
New York feature the most controversial Senate campaign in the
nation this fall. Incumbent Charles Goodell (R) currently trails Rep.
Richard Ottinger (D) and Conservative James Buckley (a registered
Republican) in his bid for election to a first full term. White House
support for Buckley, brother of right-wing author William F. Buckley,
has cast doubts on the political futures of Goodell's fellow GOP
Administration critics in the Senate (Percy, Hatfield, Brooke, e t al.)
Like many liberal Democrats, Goodell earned the Agnew epithet
"radical-liberal" for his dovish Vietnam stance and his opposition to
Nixon's Southern judicial choices. Several weeks ago, the Senator's
chances at reelection were nil, but the Vice-President's crudeness in
attacking Goodell and the slowness of Ottinger's campaign have
increased his chances somewhat. Nevertheless, the polls now give the
edge to the chauvinistic Buckley, a Yale Club aristocrat who has
donned a hardhat and intoned about decency to cater to New York's
"Silent Majority". An antiwar, liberal split between Ottinger and
Goodell could elect Buckley; the win could go to either liberal able to
win back working-class votes by attacking millionaire Buckley's
anti-labor views. The New York contest is much too close to call.
Tennessee Republican Rep. Bill Brock, heir to a candy-making
fortune, is ambitiously trying to unseat three-term Senator Albert
Gore (D). Moderate Gore has incurred the Southern strategists' wrath
with his dovish Vietnam stand and his opposition to the Haynsworth
and Carswell Supreme Court nominations. His uphill campaign has
been a dynamic one, and he has an outside chance of winning because
of the widespread disaffection over Nixon's economic policies. Brock,
still a slight favorite, is a drab Chamber of Commerce
ultraconservative who opposed even Appalachia aid to impoverished
hastern Tennessee. His campaign, almost totally managed by the same
public relations firm that sold Richard Nixon in 1968, is the finest
that chocolate-covered millions can buy.
Ohio Republicans are hurt this fall by a loan scandal involving

torn rees

several members of the state ticket. Senatorial hopeful Robert Taft
(R) therefore faces a stiff challenge from Cleveland lawyer Howard
Metzenbaum, a liberal Democrat with strong anti-war leanings and a
close associate of retiring Senator Stephen Young (D). Metzenbaum is a
rugged, enthusiastic campaigner, and he has pulled ahead of the
colorless Taft. Last week, the desperate Taft's staff made a last-ditch
effort to stop Metzenbaum by leaking to the press a report
questioning the Democrat's patriotism. Despite a possible fear vote,
Metzenbaum seems likely to best Nixon rubber-stamp Taft.
Indiana's contest between Senator Vance Hartke (D) and Rep.
Richard Roudebush (R) is certainly 1 970's dirtiest race. Roudebush,a
conservative with Birehite leanings, has been the more reckless
candidate. He dubbed Hartke "the Senator from Hanoi" for his
anti-war leanings and hired hippies to strew Hartke literature over the
landscape, thereby discrediting the Senator. Hartke, has cultivated a
law-and-order image by voting for Nixon's crime bills. He needs to
veer somewhat to the right, because he trails Roudebush.
The Illinois campaign is only slightly less dirty. GOP Sen. Ralph
Smith has also used hippies to smear his opponent, Democratic State
Treasurer Adlai Stevenson 111. While, not an outstanding candidate,
Stevenson has unified Democratic support and a famous name.
Stevenson qualifies as a dovish moderate, but like Hartke he has
become tough on the law-and-order issue in response to Smith's and
Agnew's reckless charges that he was soft on crime. Senator Smith's
chances of keeping the seat once held by Everett Dirksen are
extremely slim.
Happy tube-watching on election night! Good election news for
Stanford will be bad news for the White House.
