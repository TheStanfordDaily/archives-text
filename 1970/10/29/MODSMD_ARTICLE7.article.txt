America's bombers agree. Bomb factories, schools of
counterinsurgency, and military outposts of occupation armies are
legitimate targets as long as the United States is dropping bombs on
the people of Southeast Asia and occupying de facto colonies at home
and abroad. The Weathermen believe that they are part of a
world-wide war on the oppressed against the oppressor. They answer
by attacking the people who control America. There is no sanctuary.
The simplest purpose of bombings is immediate damage. To this
point, however, few bombings have been very effective. None have
seriously hampered the war effort.
Future Bombings
The real force of bombing lies in what it portends for the future.
Current bombings seem to be "serving notice" that researchers, police,
and officials are not considered neutral by revolutionary movements.
This is not just a warning to possible targets. It identifies the
oppressors. It is important to notice that no revolutionary terrorism
has occurred in the U.S. No attacks have been made on the
population. Despite popular fears of Weatherman, we should
remember no one attending the USC— Stanford game really believed
that there would be an attempt to bomb the stadium.
Bombings—and jailbreaks especially—serve another purpose. They
prove that the American "dinosaur" is Hot all powerful. They inspire
people engaged in different forms of radical activity. Bombing grew
up in reaction to growing ineffectiveness and risk in other forms of
action. You can no longer block a napalm truck or end war research
by sitting down. Consequently, people whose struggles seem to
deadend when repression comes down feel good when someone else
does the job.
The liberal opponents of bombing or any militant activity say that
it will bring "reaction." To evaluate that very real possibility we must
divide reaction between those with power and the powerless.
The National Elite
The powerful—be they members of the national elite or merely
local functionaries-will use left-wing sabotage as an excuse for
repression. (Right-wing terrorism, in Mississippi or Palo Alto, has
never drawn such a response.) They will not be able to halt the
bombers, but they can eliminate the above-ground revolutionaries.
But the ruling class does not repress the left because it is violent.
Rather, it is because the Movement threatens to be effective.
Regardless of our tactics, the elite will try to smash us if we continue
to build a revolutionary movement.
Popular reaction is more important. Massive popular antagonism to
the left permits the growth of totalitarianism (corporate liberalism) in
this country. Large numbers of people do not understand why
bombings take place, or do not see "a new world (rising) from the
ashes of the old."
People's Power
Furthermore, left-wing revolution means the popular (democratic)
seizure of power by the "People." Large numbers of people must
engage in revolutionary action for there to be a revolution. A coup
d'etat, even with left-wing rhetoric, is not a revolution.
Weatherman writes off the prospect of building a mass
revolutionary movement in America—at least white America, but that
dos not mean that we must write off Weatherman. Weatherman
politics are incorrect, but that does not mean everything Weatherman
does must be rejected.
There is much to be done. The campus movement must develop a
clearer notion of where it is going. A sustaining radical life-style must
be developed for people who leave the campuses, and active centers of
radical activity must reach out to involved new constituencies,
explaining Movement activities and aiding in the rebuilding of a
working-class Left in America. These are the primary tasks of the
Revolutionary movement. Bombings, under proper conditions, can
contribute to that movement. Acts of sabotage, however, must not be
confused with "The Revolution" as a whole.
