## Waiting For Woodstock

"I came upon a child of God;
He was walking along the Road.
And I asked him, 'Where are you
going"?'
And this he told me;
'I'm going on down to Yasker's
farm,
I'm gonna join in a rock-n-roll
band.
I'm gonna camp out on the land.
I'm gonna try and get my soul
free.'
We are star-dust; million year-old
carbon.
We are gold and caught in the
Devil's bargain,
And we've got to get ourselves
back to the Garden."
"WOODSTOCK"
—Jorii Mitchell
Last July, a kid from
Pennsylvania sat on the side of a
mountain in Connecticut. His
sleeping bag still hung about his
shoulders, though it was past the
usual hour for lunch. He was
confused and dejected:
"I didn't get to Woodstock last
year, and I thought this might be
something like it. I mean, the
people are here, but the musicians
aren't coming and the promoters
got busted and nothing's
happening. It scares me that I
could spend a whole lifetime
waiting for Woodstock to happen
again."
With these words, he expressed
the feelings of many. Indeed,
hundreds sat on the hillside with
him, lured by promises of
Woodstock's second coming. And
thousands of others across the
nation looked on to see if they
would really get it together.
Since the concert on Yasker's
farm over a year ago, Woodstock
has become a legend and a symbol
to people of all viewpoints. Some
point to it as proof that man will
some day find peace and harmony
in a communal way of life. Others

condemn it as a degradation 01
Western culture and morality. But
nearly all agree that Woodstock
was an example of today's
counter-culture asserting itself in a
radical departure from the past.
Superficial Trip
It is with this latter assessment
that I will deal here. For
reasonable as it seems on the
surface, a deeper look reveals that
the "radical departure" of
Woodstock is more superficial
than profound. Admittedly the
elements of local color- the dress,
the music, and the language-were
truly contemporary, and unique
to this age. But as to the more
central question of what was
happening in people's heads and
why, the elements of continuity
are more striking than people
imagine.
For the quest of Woodstock is
one which has been very common
throughout American history.
"We are gold and caught in the
Devil's bargain. And we've got to
get ourselves back to the Garden."
They were seeking what countless
others have sought; a life of
guiltless simplicity and
harmony—a return to the
innocence before the Fall.
In format, the gathering at
Woodstock bore a strong
resemblence to the revival
meetings of the early 18 th and
19 th centuries. There were
people—or more accurately, a
people—to be a part of and to be
righteous with. There was a sense
of joyous struggle in meeting the
common trial. And there was
music- which came from the soul
and spoke to the spirit.
In its communal aspect, and its
sense of having arrived,
Woodstock finds predecessors in
the hundreds of religious and not
so religious Utopian ventures
which began early in our history

and continue in the present. All
are marked by a disillusionment
with the reality of their lives. All
seek satisfaction and a new
earthly tranquility through
renewed co-operation and love for
one's neighbor.
He Got 'Holy Rollers'
Certain practices of the
Utopian groups i'ind striking
parallels among those who today
await the second coming of
Woodstock. Many gave music a
central place in their lives, and
saw dancing as a type of spiritual
expression. The Shakers, for
example, derived their name from
their spontaneous writhings and
twitchings to music, which they
interpreted as messages from God.
So, too, with the "Holy Rollers"
of the present century. Both

carried communication by body
movement beyond the realm of
modern dance.
The terms "brother" and
"sister," so commonly used
today, were just as popular with
certain idealists of the last two
centuries. The Harmonists of
Indiana and Pennsylvania, the
Inspirationalists of lowa, and the
afore-mentioned Shakers, who
spread throughout the East and
Midwest, all referred to each other
in today's with-it lingo. Other
groups, who chanced not to use
today's terminology, nevertheless
thought in the same terms.
Lastly, but by no means
exhausting the range of directly
parallels, there is the matter of the
young man on the mountain in
Connecticut. In his pilgrimage to

nature, he manifests the instinct
of Western man to seek the New
Jerusalem in a region unspoiled by
sinful man and his corrupt
civilization. For Eden was a
garden, and when it is found
again, it will still be a garden.
In the particulars of his
situation, half draped, and in a
stupor of confused expectancy, he
seems not greatly unlike the
Millerites of the 18 40 's. Into the
mountains of western New York,
not so very far from Yasker's
farm, they journeyed in their
lacey white ascension robes.
There, on the mountaintops, even
in the upper branches of trees,
they waited expectantly for the
second coming of Christ.

example, derived their name from
their spontaneous writhings and
twitchings to music, which they
interpreted as messages from God.
So, too, with the "Holy Rollers"
of the present century. Both

carried communication by body
movement beyond the realm of
modern dance.
The terms "brother" and
"sister," so commonly used
today, were just as popular with
certain idealists of the last two
centuries. The Harmonists of
Indiana and Pennsylvania, the
Inspirationalists of lowa, and the
afore-mentioned Shakers, who
spread throughout the East and
Midwest, all referred to each other
in today's with-it lingo. Other
groups, who chanced not to use
today's terminology, nevertheless
thought in the same terms.
Lastly, but by no means
exhausting the range of directly
parallels, there is the matter of the
young man on the mountain in
Connecticut. In his pilgrimage to

nature, he manifests the instinct
of Western man to seek the New
Jerusalem in a region unspoiled by
sinful man and his corrupt
civilization. For Eden was a
garden, and when it is found
again, it will still be a garden.
In the particulars of his
situation, half draped, and in a
stupor of confused expectancy, he
seems not greatly unlike the
Millerites of the 18 40 's. Into the
mountains of western New York,
not so very far from Yasker's
farm, they journeyed in their
lacey white ascension robes.
There, on the mountaintops, even
in the upper branches of trees,
they waited expectantly for the
second coming of Christ.

"I came upon a child of God;
He was walking along the Road.
And I asked him, 'Where are you
going"?'
And this he told me;
'I'm going on down to Yasker's
farm,
I'm gonna join in a rock-n-roll
band.
I'm gonna camp out on the land.
I'm gonna try and get my soul
free.'
We are star-dust; million year-old

We are gold and caught in the

And we've got to get ourselves

"WOODSTOCK"
—Jorii Mitchell
Last July, a kid from
Pennsylvania sat on the side of a
mountain in Connecticut. His
sleeping bag still hung about his
shoulders, though it was past the
usual hour for lunch. He was
confused and dejected:
"I didn't get to Woodstock last
year, and I thought this might be
something like it. I mean, the
people are here, but the musicians
aren't coming and the promoters
got busted and nothing's
happening. It scares me that I
could spend a whole lifetime
waiting for Woodstock to happen
again."
With these words, he expressed
the feelings of many. Indeed,
hundreds sat on the hillside with
him, lured by promises of
Woodstock's second coming. And
thousands of others across the
nation looked on to see if they
would really get it together.
Since the concert on Yasker's
farm over a year ago, Woodstock
has become a legend and a symbol
to people of all viewpoints. Some
point to it as proof that man will
some day find peace and harmony
in a communal way of life. Others

condemn it as a degradation 01
Western culture and morality. But
nearly all agree that Woodstock
was an example of today's
counter-culture asserting itself in a
radical departure from the past.
Superficial Trip
It is with this latter assessment
that I will deal here. For
reasonable as it seems on the
surface, a deeper look reveals that
the "radical departure" of
Woodstock is more superficial
than profound. Admittedly the
elements of local color- the dress,
the music, and the language-were
truly contemporary, and unique
to this age. But as to the more
central question of what was
happening in people's heads and
why, the elements of continuity
are more striking than people
imagine.
For the quest of Woodstock is
one which has been very common
throughout American history.
"We are gold and caught in the
Devil's bargain. And we've got to
get ourselves back to the Garden."
They were seeking what countless
others have sought; a life of
guiltless simplicity and
harmony—a return to the
innocence before the Fall.
In format, the gathering at
Woodstock bore a strong
resemblence to the revival
meetings of the early 18 th and
19 th centuries. There were
people—or more accurately, a
people—to be a part of and to be
righteous with. There was a sense
of joyous struggle in meeting the
common trial. And there was
music- which came from the soul
and spoke to the spirit.
In its communal aspect, and its
sense of having arrived,
Woodstock finds predecessors in
the hundreds of religious and not
so religious Utopian ventures
which began early in our history

and continue in the present. All
are marked by a disillusionment
with the reality of their lives. All
seek satisfaction and a new
earthly tranquility through
renewed co-operation and love for
one's neighbor.

Woodstock is more superficial
than profound. Admittedly the
elements of local color- the dress,
the music, and the language-were
truly contemporary, and unique
to this age. But as to the more
central question of what was
happening in people's heads and
why, the elements of continuity
are more striking than people
imagine.
For the quest of Woodstock is
one which has been very common
throughout American history.
"We are gold and caught in the
Devil's bargain. And we've got to
get ourselves back to the Garden."
They were seeking what countless
others have sought; a life of
guiltless simplicity and
harmony—a return to the
innocence before the Fall.
In format, the gathering at
Woodstock bore a strong
resemblence to the revival
meetings of the early 18 th and
19 th centuries. There were
people—or more accurately, a
people—to be a part of and to be
righteous with. There was a sense
of joyous struggle in meeting the
common trial. And there was
music- which came from the soul
and spoke to the spirit.
In its communal aspect, and its
sense of having arrived,
Woodstock finds predecessors in
the hundreds of religious and not
so religious Utopian ventures
which began early in our history

and continue in the present. All
are marked by a disillusionment
with the reality of their lives. All
seek satisfaction and a new
earthly tranquility through
renewed co-operation and love for
one's neighbor.
He Got 'Holy Rollers'
Certain practices of the
Utopian groups i'ind striking
parallels among those who today
await the second coming of
Woodstock. Many gave music a
central place in their lives, and
saw dancing as a type of spiritual
expression. The Shakers, for
example, derived their name from
their spontaneous writhings and
twitchings to music, which they
interpreted as messages from God.
So, too, with the "Holy Rollers"
of the present century. Both

carried communication by body
movement beyond the realm of
modern dance.
The terms "brother" and
"sister," so commonly used
today, were just as popular with
certain idealists of the last two
centuries. The Harmonists of
Indiana and Pennsylvania, the
Inspirationalists of lowa, and the
afore-mentioned Shakers, who
spread throughout the East and
Midwest, all referred to each other
in today's with-it lingo. Other
groups, who chanced not to use
today's terminology, nevertheless
thought in the same terms.
Lastly, but by no means
exhausting the range of directly
parallels, there is the matter of the
young man on the mountain in
Connecticut. In his pilgrimage to

nature, he manifests the instinct
of Western man to seek the New
Jerusalem in a region unspoiled by
sinful man and his corrupt
civilization. For Eden was a
garden, and when it is found
again, it will still be a garden.
In the particulars of his
situation, half draped, and in a
stupor of confused expectancy, he
seems not greatly unlike the
Millerites of the 18 40 's. Into the
mountains of western New York,
not so very far from Yasker's
farm, they journeyed in their
lacey white ascension robes.
There, on the mountaintops, even
in the upper branches of trees,
they waited expectantly for the
second coming of Christ.

"I came upon a child of God;
He was walking along the Road.
And I asked him, 'Where are you
going"?'
And this he told me;
'I'm going on down to Yasker's
farm,
I'm gonna join in a rock-n-roll
band.
I'm gonna camp out on the land.
I'm gonna try and get my soul
free.'
We are star-dust; million year-old
carbon.
We are gold and caught in the
Devil's bargain,
And we've got to get ourselves
back to the Garden."
"WOODSTOCK"
—Jorii Mitchell
Last July, a kid from
Pennsylvania sat on the side of a
mountain in Connecticut. His
sleeping bag still hung about his
shoulders, though it was past the
usual hour for lunch. He was
confused and dejected:
"I didn't get to Woodstock last
year, and I thought this might be
something like it. I mean, the
people are here, but the musicians
aren't coming and the promoters
got busted and nothing's
happening. It scares me that I
could spend a whole lifetime
waiting for Woodstock to happen
again."
With these words, he expressed
the feelings of many. Indeed,
hundreds sat on the hillside with
him, lured by promises of
Woodstock's second coming. And
thousands of others across the
nation looked on to see if they
would really get it together.
Since the concert on Yasker's
farm over a year ago, Woodstock
has become a legend and a symbol
to people of all viewpoints. Some
point to it as proof that man will
some day find peace and harmony
in a communal way of life. Others

condemn it as a degradation 01
Western culture and morality. But
nearly all agree that Woodstock
was an example of today's
counter-culture asserting itself in a
radical departure from the past.

It is with this latter assessment
that I will deal here. For
