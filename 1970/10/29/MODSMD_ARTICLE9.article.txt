## Asian Mass Murder 
### 
katherine barkley

The latest U.S. anti-personnel
weapon being used in Indochina is
the "Cloth bomb." These small
explosives are wrapped in bright
red and yellow cloth-children
think they're toys. Bombers
spread them over the
"enemy-occupied" countryside of
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
When picked up, they explode
with enough force to blow off a
hand or part of a face, but not to
kill.
In this fashion, the Indochina
war goes on.
The fine print in Le Monde, a
French newspaper, reported on
October 21 that plans exist, which
seem likely to be implemented,
for massive intervention by the

South Vietnamese into southern
Laos. The plan won't work
without direct participation of
Americans, says a Le Monde
correspondent. Even if the
massive invasion doesn't happen,
American Special Forces will
certainly continue to make
clandestine raids into Laos.
Meanwhile, over southern
Laos, which has been bombed
steadily since 1 964 , American
planes are making about 1,000
bombing runs a day.
Inconceivable destruction of
South Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia continues through
massive bombing, artillery fire,
and herbicides. The Defense
Department is at a loss to explain
why the Army is still using a
herbicide in South Vietnam which
was banned a year ago because it
deforms human fetuses.
American-trained and supplied
mercenaries carry on where there
are no U.S. troops actively
involved. The genocide of the
rural population of Indochina
continues at a magnitude
unprecedented in history.
Nixon has conveniently come
up with a politically timely
"peace" proposal, which was
constructed to sound reasonable
to the American public, but in
effect is a totally unreasonable
call for surrender.
Technology at War
He will continue to withdraw
troops while at the same time
intensify the technological
warfare. He will follow the
"forced urbanization" strategy,
strengthening military control
over the mass of the population
which is being pushed into the
cities by the systematic bombing
of the rural areas.
Practically everyone at places
like Stanford and the
mid-peninsula has adopted some
kind of anti-war stand. Some say
that the President knows best how
to get the U.S. out. The only
problem is that nothing Nixon has
done (including advocating use of
nuclear weapons against the
Vietnamese in 1 953 ) gives any
hope that, he will ever get out, or
that he has any qualms about
destroying as much of the country
as possible before he leaves.
Other people are writing their
congressmen and backing "peace"
candidates. But so far, even after
the outcry last Spring, Congress is
unwilling to enact even the most
modest anti-war legislation. As for
voting in new doves into
Washington, few, it an**
candidates except

Scheer, have any more of a
genuine anti-war stand than those
already there.
Black and White
Our liberal education has
taught us that everything is
relative, that nothing is black or
white. Each to his own morality.
After all, that's what freedom is,
isn't it? Even though our
uneducated intuition says that the
genocide in Indochina is the most
heinous crime since the Nazi's,
our educated rationality tells us
that people should be free to
develop the weapons, free to drop
them, free to escape judgement or
punishment because it seemed
okay with the "majority."
But now the polls show the
'majority' to be clearly against the
war. What can we do? Rioting
isn't enough.
Communities are going to have
to get together, to understand the
criminality of American
involvement in the war, and to
refuse to contribute any money,
brainpower, or manpower for
genocidal/imperialist ends.
The Tribunals
The Berkeley community will
begin tonight a series of eight War
Crimes Tribunals. The purpose of
the Tribunals, modeled after
Bertrand Russell's 1 967 Tribunal
in Stockholm, will be to
determine which individuals and
institutions in their community
are responsible for war crimes, as
defined by the principles of
Nuremburg.
The first Tribunal of the series,
which will be held at the Pauley
Ballroom in the Student Union at
8 :00 tonight, is going to be
presented by Elaine Brown,
Robert Scheer, .Jan Austin, and
Andy Truskier. Three four people
were part of the American
delegation headed by Eldridge
Cleaver that just returned from a
three month visit to China, North
Korea, and North Vietnam. They
sat through days and days of
testimony from the peoples of
these nations on the atrocities and
brutality that they have suffered
under the Americans.
The first tribunal, complete
with displays of weapons and
pictures, will document as
completely as possible the nature
of the U.S. strategy in Asia. Go to
Berkeley to hear it if you can—it
will blow your mind out of any
complacency it might be tending
toward . . .

The fine print in Le Monde, a
French newspaper, reported on
October 21 that plans exist, which
seem likely to be implemented,
for massive intervention by the

South Vietnamese into southern
Laos. The plan won't work
without direct participation of
Americans, says a Le Monde
correspondent. Even if the
massive invasion doesn't happen,
American Special Forces will
certainly continue to make
clandestine raids into Laos.
Meanwhile, over southern
Laos, which has been bombed
steadily since 1 964 , American
planes are making about 1,000
bombing runs a day.
Inconceivable destruction of
South Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia continues through
massive bombing, artillery fire,
and herbicides. The Defense
Department is at a loss to explain
why the Army is still using a
herbicide in South Vietnam which
was banned a year ago because it
deforms human fetuses.
American-trained and supplied
mercenaries carry on where there
are no U.S. troops actively
involved. The genocide of the
rural population of Indochina
continues at a magnitude
unprecedented in history.
Nixon has conveniently come
up with a politically timely
"peace" proposal, which was
constructed to sound reasonable
to the American public, but in
effect is a totally unreasonable
call for surrender.
Technology at War
He will continue to withdraw
troops while at the same time
intensify the technological
warfare. He will follow the
"forced urbanization" strategy,
strengthening military control
over the mass of the population
which is being pushed into the
cities by the systematic bombing
of the rural areas.
Practically everyone at places
like Stanford and the
mid-peninsula has adopted some
kind of anti-war stand. Some say
that the President knows best how
to get the U.S. out. The only
problem is that nothing Nixon has
done (including advocating use of
nuclear weapons against the
Vietnamese in 1 953 ) gives any
hope that, he will ever get out, or
that he has any qualms about
destroying as much of the country
as possible before he leaves.
Other people are writing their
congressmen and backing "peace"
candidates. But so far, even after
the outcry last Spring, Congress is
unwilling to enact even the most
modest anti-war legislation. As for
voting in new doves into
Washington, few, it an**
candidates except

Scheer, have any more of a
genuine anti-war stand than those
already there.
Black and White
Our liberal education has
taught us that everything is
relative, that nothing is black or
white. Each to his own morality.
After all, that's what freedom is,
isn't it? Even though our
uneducated intuition says that the
genocide in Indochina is the most
heinous crime since the Nazi's,
our educated rationality tells us
that people should be free to
develop the weapons, free to drop
them, free to escape judgement or
punishment because it seemed
okay with the "majority."
But now the polls show the
'majority' to be clearly against the
war. What can we do? Rioting
isn't enough.
Communities are going to have
to get together, to understand the
criminality of American
involvement in the war, and to
refuse to contribute any money,
brainpower, or manpower for
genocidal/imperialist ends.
The Tribunals
The Berkeley community will
begin tonight a series of eight War
Crimes Tribunals. The purpose of
the Tribunals, modeled after
Bertrand Russell's 1 967 Tribunal
in Stockholm, will be to
determine which individuals and
institutions in their community
are responsible for war crimes, as
defined by the principles of
Nuremburg.
The first Tribunal of the series,
which will be held at the Pauley
Ballroom in the Student Union at
8 :00 tonight, is going to be
presented by Elaine Brown,
Robert Scheer, .Jan Austin, and
Andy Truskier. Three four people
were part of the American
delegation headed by Eldridge
Cleaver that just returned from a
three month visit to China, North
Korea, and North Vietnam. They
sat through days and days of
testimony from the peoples of
these nations on the atrocities and
brutality that they have suffered
under the Americans.
The first tribunal, complete
with displays of weapons and
pictures, will document as
completely as possible the nature
of the U.S. strategy in Asia. Go to
Berkeley to hear it if you can—it
will blow your mind out of any
complacency it might be tending
toward . . .

The latest U.S. anti-personnel
weapon being used in Indochina is
the "Cloth bomb." These small
explosives are wrapped in bright
red and yellow cloth-children
think they're toys. Bombers
spread them over the
"enemy-occupied" countryside of
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
When picked up, they explode
with enough force to blow off a
hand or part of a face, but not to
kill.

planes are making about 1,000
bombing runs a day.
Inconceivable destruction of
South Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia continues through
massive bombing, artillery fire,
and herbicides. The Defense
Department is at a loss to explain
why the Army is still using a
herbicide in South Vietnam which
was banned a year ago because it
deforms human fetuses.
American-trained and supplied
mercenaries carry on where there
are no U.S. troops actively
involved. The genocide of the
rural population of Indochina
continues at a magnitude
unprecedented in history.
Nixon has conveniently come
up with a politically timely
"peace" proposal, which was
constructed to sound reasonable
to the American public, but in
effect is a totally unreasonable
call for surrender.
Technology at War
He will continue to withdraw
troops while at the same time
intensify the technological
warfare. He will follow the
"forced urbanization" strategy,
strengthening military control
over the mass of the population
which is being pushed into the
cities by the systematic bombing
of the rural areas.
Practically everyone at places
like Stanford and the
mid-peninsula has adopted some
kind of anti-war stand. Some say
that the President knows best how
to get the U.S. out. The only
problem is that nothing Nixon has
done (including advocating use of
nuclear weapons against the
Vietnamese in 1 953 ) gives any
hope that, he will ever get out, or
that he has any qualms about
destroying as much of the country
as possible before he leaves.
Other people are writing their
congressmen and backing "peace"
candidates. But so far, even after
the outcry last Spring, Congress is
unwilling to enact even the most
modest anti-war legislation. As for
voting in new doves into
Washington, few, it an**
candidates except

Scheer, have any more of a
genuine anti-war stand than those
already there.
Black and White
Our liberal education has
taught us that everything is
relative, that nothing is black or
white. Each to his own morality.
After all, that's what freedom is,
isn't it? Even though our
uneducated intuition says that the
genocide in Indochina is the most
heinous crime since the Nazi's,
our educated rationality tells us
that people should be free to
develop the weapons, free to drop
them, free to escape judgement or
punishment because it seemed
okay with the "majority."
But now the polls show the
'majority' to be clearly against the
war. What can we do? Rioting
isn't enough.
Communities are going to have
to get together, to understand the
criminality of American
involvement in the war, and to
refuse to contribute any money,
brainpower, or manpower for
genocidal/imperialist ends.
The Tribunals
The Berkeley community will
begin tonight a series of eight War
Crimes Tribunals. The purpose of
the Tribunals, modeled after
Bertrand Russell's 1 967 Tribunal
in Stockholm, will be to
determine which individuals and
institutions in their community
are responsible for war crimes, as
defined by the principles of
Nuremburg.
The first Tribunal of the series,
which will be held at the Pauley
Ballroom in the Student Union at
8 :00 tonight, is going to be
presented by Elaine Brown,
Robert Scheer, .Jan Austin, and
Andy Truskier. Three four people
were part of the American
delegation headed by Eldridge
Cleaver that just returned from a
three month visit to China, North
Korea, and North Vietnam. They
sat through days and days of
testimony from the peoples of
these nations on the atrocities and
brutality that they have suffered
under the Americans.
The first tribunal, complete
with displays of weapons and
pictures, will document as
completely as possible the nature
of the U.S. strategy in Asia. Go to
Berkeley to hear it if you can—it
will blow your mind out of any
complacency it might be tending
toward . . .

The latest U.S. anti-personnel
weapon being used in Indochina is
the "Cloth bomb." These small
explosives are wrapped in bright
red and yellow cloth-children
think they're toys. Bombers
spread them over the
"enemy-occupied" countryside of
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
When picked up, they explode
with enough force to blow off a
hand or part of a face, but not to
kill.
In this fashion, the Indochina
war goes on.
The fine print in Le Monde, a
French newspaper, reported on
October 21 that plans exist, which
seem likely to be implemented,
for massive intervention by the

South Vietnamese into southern
Laos. The plan won't work
without direct participation of
Americans, says a Le Monde
correspondent. Even if the
massive invasion doesn't happen,
American Special Forces will
certainly continue to make
clandestine raids into Laos.
Meanwhile, over southern
Laos, which has been bombed

planes are making about 1,000
bombing runs a day.
