REMEMBER LAST APRIL?
The Strike? All that political activity?
The Nixon administration wasn't concerned. By the t le election day rolled around, they knew it would all
be water under the bridge.
Many at Stanford demanded a moratorium on classe before the election. The University responded by giv
ing students two days, next Monday and Tuesday.
It's no secret that most Stanford students are planninj a very long weekend. Why? Because they are turn
ed off on politics — i.e., they are apathetic. And sot c politicians can afford to ignore them, or even make
them the scapegoats of their campaigns.
Remember last April? Well, that's all water under th:? bridge. If you don't agree, come and help us get out
the Democratic vote.
