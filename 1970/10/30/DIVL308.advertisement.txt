SAN FRANCISCO'S ALL-TIME
GREATEST MUSICAL FOR THE
PRICE OF A MOVIE.
For the first time in theatrical history the entire
loge and balcony are general admission.
$3.50 Daily $4.50 Friday and Saturday
Hair has been many people's first theatrical experience.
And it's been some people's second, third, fourth and fifth
experience as well.
So to make things easier for those not adept at the box-office,
hard-ticket, seat-numbered, row-lettered routine, we're making
our entire loge and balcony into one big general admission
section. And we're pricing it like a movie.
Hair has the second longest run of any musical to play
in San Francisco.* And we're out to be number one.
So if you've seen Hair a first time, see it a second.
Your second can make us first.
* First place is still held by "Diamond Lil" starring Mae West.
New group discounts on reserved orchestra seats too.
For groups of 25 and over. Even if some are younger.
I have a whole group of people who want to see HAIR.
Please tell me what kind of extra discounts you can give us.
