HYPNOSIS is a state of focused attention, in which sub
conscious processes may be brought closer to the surface.
Self-hypnosis is a state of hypnosis which is induced by one
self, rather than by another person. With self-hypnosis a
person can learn to produce—on his own—all of the effects
that can be produced by an external hypnotist. Both hypnosis
and self-hypnosis involve learning to strongly focus attention
towards or away from specific parts of the environment. Any
skill which involves attention direction can be facilitated by
hypnotic training.
For example, you can increase your ability to concentrate
on reading, by focusing your attention completely on the ma
terial being read, and tuning out irrelevant stimulii. Or, you
can learn to relax quickly and as deeply as while asleep, by
becoming aware of tension points in your body, and relaxing
the muscles involved. You can reduce or eliminate pain by
selectively ignoring areas of discomfort and focusing all of
your attention on other stimulii.
You can enhance them emotionally and with all five senses,
in a vivid hypnotic dream. Hypnotic dreams are also useful
in enhancing creativity. Further, you can distort your subjective
perception of time, so that you can make pleasant events seem
to last longer, and unpleasant events seem to go by quickly.
You can also learn to produce altered states of consciousness.
This includes the ability to enhance mediation states and pro
produce states of amplified awareness.
HYPNOSIS WORKSHOP is a privately owned school of self
hypnosis. We offer a four-week course (seven hours instruction
total), teaching you how to hypnotize yourself, showing you
how to do the hypnotic phenomena mentioned above. The
course costs $30. There will be a free lecture-demonstration on
hypnosis and the uses of self-hypnosis at our office at 1010
Doyle Street in Menlo Park at 7:30 on Saturday, October 31.
Come to the lecture; meet the staff of Hypnosis Workshop. If
you find you are interested further, you may take our hypnotic
susceptibility test, and—if you like—register for the course.
Our phone is 322-2992.
