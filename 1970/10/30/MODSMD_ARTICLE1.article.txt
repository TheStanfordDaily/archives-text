# Militants Attack Nixon Motorcade
## President Unhurt After Rock And Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several Injured 
### LANG ATWOOD 
SAN JOSE — President Richard
Nixon escaped unharmed last night
after a large anti-war crowd attacked his
motorcade with rocks, eggs, bottles and
two-by-fours as he left a Republican
rally in the San Jose Civic Auditorium.
According to Arthur Godfrey, a
senior Secret Service agent, several
rocks hit the windows of the
Presidential limousine as it passed
through the demonstrators.
President Nixon issued a statement
late last night on the San Jose violence.
See box on this page.
The crowd, estimated at 2000
people, surrounded the parking lot
where the Presidential motorcade was
parked while Nixon spoke inside. When
the President emerged from the
building, surrounded by Secret Service
agents, the protesters began yelling
anti-war slogans and obsenities.
Nixon then stood on the hood of his
bullet-proof limousine for several
minutes giving his familiar
V-for-Victory sign while the crowd
jeered and the press took pictures.
According to the Associated Ptess, the
President's jaw seemed thrust forward
defiantly. Several eggs were thrown at
him but missed.
Demonstrators Clubbed
While the presidential party got into
their vehicles 40-5 0 riot police from
several departments charged the crowd
and opened a narrow path to the street.
Several demonstrators were clubbed by
police as they tried to flee. Almost
immediately, eight San Jose motorcycle
policemen gunned their machines into
the demonstrators massed in the street.
It appeared that several people who
could not get out of the way in time
were hit by the motorcycles. However,
they did not seem to be hurt.
When police and Secret Service cars
preceding the Presidential limousine
tried to exit the parking lot, the crowd
momentarily broke through the police
line and blocked the vehicles. This
caused a chain-reaction accident in the
motorcade. The cars continued on
immediately, however, through a hail
of rocks, eggs and bottles. The
President's car, with eight Secret
Servicemen on top of it, was splattered
with eggs and had several of its radio
antennas ripped off as the crowd tried
to stop it.
Once the President had safely left,
the crowd turned its attention to the
four press buses at the end of the
motorcade. They were stoned heavily
and several large boards from a nearby
construction site were thrown at them.
During the melee, at least two
demonstrators and one San Jose
policeman were injured. The police
officer was hit in the head with a rock
and hospitalized. One demonstrator
was struck across the mouth with a
pistol by a plainclothes police officer.
Four Persons Arrested
Four persons were arrested and
charged by police: Ronald Cosetti,
disturbing the peace; Randy
Prodanovich, disturbing the peace;
Gayle Justice, felony assult on a peace

officer; and Doyle Hartland, inciting to
riot and disturbing the peace.
About a dozen cars parked in the
parking lot had their roofs, hoods and
trunks caved in by protesters who were
standing on them and jumping up and
down. Several windshields were also
broken out and an attempt was made
to push cars into the exit lanes.
Earlier in the evening about 75 0
people attended a rally on the nearby
San Jose State College campus. They
listened to several speakers, all of
whom warned them to keep the protest
peaceful because, "the pigs are ready
for us tonight."
The first speaker, Robert Scheer,
Peace and Freedom party candidate for
U.S. Senator and editor of "Ramparts"
magazine, told the rally that although
he was a candidate there was no doubt
that the elections were rigged and a
hoax. He compared Nixon's call for
peace in Vietnam to Hitler saying he
would save the Jews in Germany.
Mary Lou Greenberg of the Bay
Area Revolutionary Union echoed
Scheer's attack on electoral politics.
She claimed that the ballot box was "a
capitalist concession that enables the
ruling class to hold down and control
the power of the people."
She concluded by saying, "Tonight
its a peaceful demonstration, tomorrow
it may be something else—in the end we
will win."
The crowd responded
enthusiastically and formed behind
four young women carrying torches
and a large red sing that said, "Stop
Nixonism" for the march to the
auditorium. The "x" in Nixon had been
replaced by a swastika.
Engineers Picket
The march proceded peacefully
down E. San Carlos Street to the
auditorium where about 5 0 Lockheed
engineers, their supporters, and 20
Tunney "Cool-it" squad members were
picketing.
The engineers carried signs reading:
"Don't Fight Inflation with our Jobs,"
"Jobs Not Welfare," and"I am an
Economic Game Plan Casulty — You
are Next."
After pausing in front of the
auditorium to chant at the assembled

bystanders, the marchers continued
around the block while a police
helicopter hovered overhead.
In the rear of the building a line of
police from San Jose, Milpitas, Palo
Alto and Santa Clara County guarded
the entrance. Some of the protestors
climbed on top of buses and began
taunting the officers.
'Free Bobby, Fry Nixon'
A short time later the marchers
formed a line on both sides of the
street that the motorcade was
scheduled to use. When Nixon appeared
waving to them they immediately
began shouting, "Free Bobby, Fry
Nixon" and some obsenities.
After the President went inside the
hall to address the rally, the march
returned to the front of the building
where several groups tried to break
down the unguarded, but locked doors.
At one point five demonstrators did
manage to enter the building but were
bodily thrown out by police inside.
A short while later, a lone police
officer appeared on a balcony above
the crowd. The people in the street
spotted him and began yelling. He
re-entered the building just as a bottle
thrown from the crowd crashed where
he had stood.
By this time the crowd seemed more
militant and the Tunney "Cool-it"
people could not calm them down.
Some of the demonstrators listened on
outside speakers to the President's
address, often interrupting it with
chants and obscenities. Other marchers
returned to the parking area and began
positioning themselves around the
police lines, which appeared to be
rather thin.
When the Presidential motorcade
attempted to leave the auditorium
parking lot it was attacked by almost
2000 people, throwing eggs, bottles,
rocks and boards. For a few moments it
appeared that the procession might be
stopped, seriously endangering the
President. Quick police intervention
enabled Nixon to escape unhurt.
The demonstration broke up
immediately after the motorcade left
and most of the people drifted back to
the San Jose State campus in small
groups.

SAN JOSE — President Richard
Nixon escaped unharmed last night
after a large anti-war crowd attacked his
motorcade with rocks, eggs, bottles and
two-by-fours as he left a Republican
rally in the San Jose Civic Auditorium.
According to Arthur Godfrey, a

rocks hit the windows of the

President Nixon issued a statement
late last night on the San Jose violence.

peace in Vietnam to Hitler saying he
would save the Jews in Germany.
Mary Lou Greenberg of the Bay
Area Revolutionary Union echoed
Scheer's attack on electoral politics.
She claimed that the ballot box was "a
capitalist concession that enables the
ruling class to hold down and control
the power of the people."
She concluded by saying, "Tonight
its a peaceful demonstration, tomorrow
it may be something else—in the end we
will win."
The crowd responded
enthusiastically and formed behind
four young women carrying torches
and a large red sing that said, "Stop
Nixonism" for the march to the
auditorium. The "x" in Nixon had been
replaced by a swastika.
Engineers Picket
The march proceded peacefully
down E. San Carlos Street to the
auditorium where about 5 0 Lockheed
engineers, their supporters, and 20
Tunney "Cool-it" squad members were
picketing.
The engineers carried signs reading:
"Don't Fight Inflation with our Jobs,"
"Jobs Not Welfare," and"I am an
Economic Game Plan Casulty — You
are Next."
After pausing in front of the
auditorium to chant at the assembled

bystanders, the marchers continued
around the block while a police
helicopter hovered overhead.
In the rear of the building a line of
police from San Jose, Milpitas, Palo
Alto and Santa Clara County guarded
the entrance. Some of the protestors
climbed on top of buses and began
taunting the officers.
'Free Bobby, Fry Nixon'
A short time later the marchers
formed a line on both sides of the
street that the motorcade was
scheduled to use. When Nixon appeared
waving to them they immediately
began shouting, "Free Bobby, Fry
Nixon" and some obsenities.
After the President went inside the
hall to address the rally, the march
returned to the front of the building
where several groups tried to break
down the unguarded, but locked doors.
At one point five demonstrators did
manage to enter the building but were
bodily thrown out by police inside.
A short while later, a lone police
officer appeared on a balcony above
the crowd. The people in the street
spotted him and began yelling. He
re-entered the building just as a bottle
thrown from the crowd crashed where
he had stood.
By this time the crowd seemed more
militant and the Tunney "Cool-it"
people could not calm them down.
Some of the demonstrators listened on
outside speakers to the President's
address, often interrupting it with
chants and obscenities. Other marchers
returned to the parking area and began
positioning themselves around the
police lines, which appeared to be
rather thin.
When the Presidential motorcade
attempted to leave the auditorium
parking lot it was attacked by almost
2000 people, throwing eggs, bottles,
rocks and boards. For a few moments it
appeared that the procession might be
stopped, seriously endangering the
President. Quick police intervention
enabled Nixon to escape unhurt.
The demonstration broke up
immediately after the motorcade left
and most of the people drifted back to
the San Jose State campus in small
groups.

SAN JOSE — President Richard
Nixon escaped unharmed last night
after a large anti-war crowd attacked his
motorcade with rocks, eggs, bottles and
two-by-fours as he left a Republican
rally in the San Jose Civic Auditorium.
According to Arthur Godfrey, a
senior Secret Service agent, several
rocks hit the windows of the
Presidential limousine as it passed
through the demonstrators.
President Nixon issued a statement
late last night on the San Jose violence.
See box on this page.
The crowd, estimated at 2000
people, surrounded the parking lot
where the Presidential motorcade was
parked while Nixon spoke inside. When
the President emerged from the
building, surrounded by Secret Service
agents, the protesters began yelling
anti-war slogans and obsenities.
Nixon then stood on the hood of his
bullet-proof limousine for several
minutes giving his familiar
V-for-Victory sign while the crowd
jeered and the press took pictures.
According to the Associated Ptess, the
President's jaw seemed thrust forward
defiantly. Several eggs were thrown at
him but missed.
Demonstrators Clubbed
While the presidential party got into
their vehicles 40-5 0 riot police from
several departments charged the crowd
and opened a narrow path to the street.
Several demonstrators were clubbed by
police as they tried to flee. Almost
immediately, eight San Jose motorcycle
policemen gunned their machines into
the demonstrators massed in the street.
It appeared that several people who
could not get out of the way in time
were hit by the motorcycles. However,
they did not seem to be hurt.
When police and Secret Service cars
preceding the Presidential limousine
tried to exit the parking lot, the crowd
momentarily broke through the police
line and blocked the vehicles. This
caused a chain-reaction accident in the
motorcade. The cars continued on
immediately, however, through a hail
of rocks, eggs and bottles. The
President's car, with eight Secret
Servicemen on top of it, was splattered
with eggs and had several of its radio
antennas ripped off as the crowd tried
to stop it.
Once the President had safely left,
the crowd turned its attention to the
four press buses at the end of the
motorcade. They were stoned heavily
and several large boards from a nearby
construction site were thrown at them.
During the melee, at least two
demonstrators and one San Jose
policeman were injured. The police
officer was hit in the head with a rock
and hospitalized. One demonstrator
was struck across the mouth with a
pistol by a plainclothes police officer.
Four Persons Arrested
Four persons were arrested and
charged by police: Ronald Cosetti,
disturbing the peace; Randy
Prodanovich, disturbing the peace;
Gayle Justice, felony assult on a peace

officer; and Doyle Hartland, inciting to
riot and disturbing the peace.
About a dozen cars parked in the
parking lot had their roofs, hoods and
trunks caved in by protesters who were
standing on them and jumping up and
down. Several windshields were also
broken out and an attempt was made
to push cars into the exit lanes.
Earlier in the evening about 75 0
people attended a rally on the nearby
San Jose State College campus. They
listened to several speakers, all of
whom warned them to keep the protest
peaceful because, "the pigs are ready
for us tonight."
The first speaker, Robert Scheer,
Peace and Freedom party candidate for
U.S. Senator and editor of "Ramparts"
magazine, told the rally that although
he was a candidate there was no doubt
that the elections were rigged and a
hoax. He compared Nixon's call for
peace in Vietnam to Hitler saying he
would save the Jews in Germany.

two-by-fours as he left a Republican
rally in the San Jose Civic Auditorium.
According to Arthur Godfrey, a
senior Secret Service agent, several
rocks hit the windows of the
Presidential limousine as it passed
through the demonstrators.
President Nixon issued a statement
late last night on the San Jose violence.
See box on this page.
The crowd, estimated at 2000
people, surrounded the parking lot
where the Presidential motorcade was
parked while Nixon spoke inside. When
the President emerged from the
building, surrounded by Secret Service
agents, the protesters began yelling
anti-war slogans and obsenities.
Nixon then stood on the hood of his
bullet-proof limousine for several
minutes giving his familiar
V-for-Victory sign while the crowd
jeered and the press took pictures.
According to the Associated Ptess, the
President's jaw seemed thrust forward
defiantly. Several eggs were thrown at
him but missed.
Demonstrators Clubbed
While the presidential party got into
their vehicles 40-5 0 riot police from
several departments charged the crowd
and opened a narrow path to the street.
Several demonstrators were clubbed by
police as they tried to flee. Almost
immediately, eight San Jose motorcycle
policemen gunned their machines into
the demonstrators massed in the street.
It appeared that several people who
could not get out of the way in time
were hit by the motorcycles. However,
they did not seem to be hurt.
When police and Secret Service cars
preceding the Presidential limousine
tried to exit the parking lot, the crowd
momentarily broke through the police
line and blocked the vehicles. This
caused a chain-reaction accident in the
motorcade. The cars continued on
immediately, however, through a hail
of rocks, eggs and bottles. The
President's car, with eight Secret
Servicemen on top of it, was splattered
with eggs and had several of its radio
antennas ripped off as the crowd tried
to stop it.
Once the President had safely left,
the crowd turned its attention to the
four press buses at the end of the
motorcade. They were stoned heavily
and several large boards from a nearby
construction site were thrown at them.
During the melee, at least two
demonstrators and one San Jose
policeman were injured. The police
officer was hit in the head with a rock
and hospitalized. One demonstrator
was struck across the mouth with a
pistol by a plainclothes police officer.
Four Persons Arrested
Four persons were arrested and
charged by police: Ronald Cosetti,
disturbing the peace; Randy
Prodanovich, disturbing the peace;
Gayle Justice, felony assult on a peace

officer; and Doyle Hartland, inciting to
riot and disturbing the peace.
About a dozen cars parked in the
parking lot had their roofs, hoods and
trunks caved in by protesters who were
standing on them and jumping up and
down. Several windshields were also
broken out and an attempt was made
to push cars into the exit lanes.
Earlier in the evening about 75 0
people attended a rally on the nearby
San Jose State College campus. They
listened to several speakers, all of
whom warned them to keep the protest
peaceful because, "the pigs are ready
for us tonight."
The first speaker, Robert Scheer,
Peace and Freedom party candidate for
U.S. Senator and editor of "Ramparts"
magazine, told the rally that although
he was a candidate there was no doubt
that the elections were rigged and a
hoax. He compared Nixon's call for
peace in Vietnam to Hitler saying he
would save the Jews in Germany.
Mary Lou Greenberg of the Bay
Area Revolutionary Union echoed
Scheer's attack on electoral politics.
She claimed that the ballot box was "a
capitalist concession that enables the
ruling class to hold down and control
the power of the people."
She concluded by saying, "Tonight
its a peaceful demonstration, tomorrow
it may be something else—in the end we
will win."
The crowd responded
enthusiastically and formed behind
four young women carrying torches
and a large red sing that said, "Stop
Nixonism" for the march to the
auditorium. The "x" in Nixon had been
replaced by a swastika.
Engineers Picket
The march proceded peacefully
down E. San Carlos Street to the
auditorium where about 5 0 Lockheed
engineers, their supporters, and 20
Tunney "Cool-it" squad members were
picketing.
The engineers carried signs reading:
"Don't Fight Inflation with our Jobs,"
"Jobs Not Welfare," and"I am an
Economic Game Plan Casulty — You
are Next."
After pausing in front of the
auditorium to chant at the assembled

bystanders, the marchers continued
around the block while a police
helicopter hovered overhead.
In the rear of the building a line of
police from San Jose, Milpitas, Palo
Alto and Santa Clara County guarded
the entrance. Some of the protestors
climbed on top of buses and began
taunting the officers.
'Free Bobby, Fry Nixon'
A short time later the marchers
formed a line on both sides of the
street that the motorcade was
scheduled to use. When Nixon appeared
waving to them they immediately
began shouting, "Free Bobby, Fry
Nixon" and some obsenities.
After the President went inside the
hall to address the rally, the march
returned to the front of the building
where several groups tried to break
down the unguarded, but locked doors.
At one point five demonstrators did
manage to enter the building but were
bodily thrown out by police inside.
A short while later, a lone police
officer appeared on a balcony above
the crowd. The people in the street
spotted him and began yelling. He
re-entered the building just as a bottle
thrown from the crowd crashed where
he had stood.
By this time the crowd seemed more
militant and the Tunney "Cool-it"
people could not calm them down.
Some of the demonstrators listened on
outside speakers to the President's
address, often interrupting it with
chants and obscenities. Other marchers
returned to the parking area and began
positioning themselves around the
police lines, which appeared to be
rather thin.
When the Presidential motorcade
attempted to leave the auditorium
parking lot it was attacked by almost
2000 people, throwing eggs, bottles,
rocks and boards. For a few moments it
appeared that the procession might be
stopped, seriously endangering the
President. Quick police intervention
enabled Nixon to escape unhurt.
The demonstration broke up
immediately after the motorcade left
and most of the people drifted back to
the San Jose State campus in small
groups.

SAN JOSE — President Richard
Nixon escaped unharmed last night
after a large anti-war crowd attacked his
motorcade with rocks, eggs, bottles and
two-by-fours as he left a Republican
rally in the San Jose Civic Auditorium.
According to Arthur Godfrey, a

President Nixon issued a statement

capitalist concession that enables the
ruling class to hold down and control
the power of the people."
She concluded by saying, "Tonight
its a peaceful demonstration, tomorrow
it may be something else—in the end we
will win."
The crowd responded
enthusiastically and formed behind
four young women carrying torches
and a large red sing that said, "Stop
Nixonism" for the march to the
auditorium. The "x" in Nixon had been
replaced by a swastika.
Engineers Picket
The march proceded peacefully
down E. San Carlos Street to the
auditorium where about 5 0 Lockheed
engineers, their supporters, and 20
Tunney "Cool-it" squad members were
picketing.
The engineers carried signs reading:
"Don't Fight Inflation with our Jobs,"
"Jobs Not Welfare," and"I am an
Economic Game Plan Casulty — You
are Next."
After pausing in front of the
auditorium to chant at the assembled

bystanders, the marchers continued
around the block while a police
helicopter hovered overhead.
In the rear of the building a line of
police from San Jose, Milpitas, Palo
Alto and Santa Clara County guarded
the entrance. Some of the protestors
climbed on top of buses and began
taunting the officers.
'Free Bobby, Fry Nixon'
A short time later the marchers
formed a line on both sides of the
street that the motorcade was
scheduled to use. When Nixon appeared
waving to them they immediately
began shouting, "Free Bobby, Fry
Nixon" and some obsenities.
After the President went inside the
hall to address the rally, the march
returned to the front of the building
where several groups tried to break
down the unguarded, but locked doors.
At one point five demonstrators did
manage to enter the building but were
bodily thrown out by police inside.
A short while later, a lone police
officer appeared on a balcony above
the crowd. The people in the street
spotted him and began yelling. He
re-entered the building just as a bottle
thrown from the crowd crashed where
he had stood.
By this time the crowd seemed more
militant and the Tunney "Cool-it"
people could not calm them down.
Some of the demonstrators listened on
outside speakers to the President's
address, often interrupting it with
chants and obscenities. Other marchers
returned to the parking area and began
positioning themselves around the
police lines, which appeared to be
rather thin.
When the Presidential motorcade
attempted to leave the auditorium
parking lot it was attacked by almost
2000 people, throwing eggs, bottles,
rocks and boards. For a few moments it
appeared that the procession might be
stopped, seriously endangering the
President. Quick police intervention
enabled Nixon to escape unhurt.
The demonstration broke up
immediately after the motorcade left
and most of the people drifted back to
the San Jose State campus in small
groups.

SAN JOSE — President Richard
Nixon escaped unharmed last night
after a large anti-war crowd attacked his
motorcade with rocks, eggs, bottles and
two-by-fours as he left a Republican
rally in the San Jose Civic Auditorium.
According to Arthur Godfrey, a
senior Secret Service agent, several
rocks hit the windows of the
Presidential limousine as it passed
through the demonstrators.
President Nixon issued a statement
late last night on the San Jose violence.
See box on this page.
The crowd, estimated at 2000
people, surrounded the parking lot
where the Presidential motorcade was
parked while Nixon spoke inside. When
the President emerged from the
building, surrounded by Secret Service
agents, the protesters began yelling
anti-war slogans and obsenities.
Nixon then stood on the hood of his
bullet-proof limousine for several
minutes giving his familiar
V-for-Victory sign while the crowd
jeered and the press took pictures.
According to the Associated Ptess, the
President's jaw seemed thrust forward
defiantly. Several eggs were thrown at
him but missed.
Demonstrators Clubbed
While the presidential party got into
their vehicles 40-5 0 riot police from
several departments charged the crowd
and opened a narrow path to the street.
Several demonstrators were clubbed by
police as they tried to flee. Almost
immediately, eight San Jose motorcycle
policemen gunned their machines into
the demonstrators massed in the street.
It appeared that several people who
could not get out of the way in time
were hit by the motorcycles. However,
they did not seem to be hurt.
When police and Secret Service cars
preceding the Presidential limousine
tried to exit the parking lot, the crowd
momentarily broke through the police
line and blocked the vehicles. This
caused a chain-reaction accident in the
motorcade. The cars continued on
immediately, however, through a hail
of rocks, eggs and bottles. The
President's car, with eight Secret
Servicemen on top of it, was splattered
with eggs and had several of its radio
antennas ripped off as the crowd tried
to stop it.
Once the President had safely left,
the crowd turned its attention to the
four press buses at the end of the
motorcade. They were stoned heavily
and several large boards from a nearby
construction site were thrown at them.
During the melee, at least two
demonstrators and one San Jose
policeman were injured. The police
officer was hit in the head with a rock
and hospitalized. One demonstrator
was struck across the mouth with a
pistol by a plainclothes police officer.
Four Persons Arrested
Four persons were arrested and
charged by police: Ronald Cosetti,
disturbing the peace; Randy
Prodanovich, disturbing the peace;
Gayle Justice, felony assult on a peace

officer; and Doyle Hartland, inciting to
riot and disturbing the peace.
About a dozen cars parked in the
parking lot had their roofs, hoods and
trunks caved in by protesters who were
standing on them and jumping up and
down. Several windshields were also
broken out and an attempt was made
to push cars into the exit lanes.
Earlier in the evening about 75 0
people attended a rally on the nearby
San Jose State College campus. They
listened to several speakers, all of
whom warned them to keep the protest
peaceful because, "the pigs are ready
for us tonight."
The first speaker, Robert Scheer,
Peace and Freedom party candidate for
U.S. Senator and editor of "Ramparts"
magazine, told the rally that although
he was a candidate there was no doubt
that the elections were rigged and a
hoax. He compared Nixon's call for
peace in Vietnam to Hitler saying he
would save the Jews in Germany.
Mary Lou Greenberg of the Bay
Area Revolutionary Union echoed
Scheer's attack on electoral politics.
She claimed that the ballot box was "a
capitalist concession that enables the
ruling class to hold down and control
the power of the people."
She concluded by saying, "Tonight
its a peaceful demonstration, tomorrow
it may be something else—in the end we
will win."
