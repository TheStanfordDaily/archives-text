## Will Doves Invade The House? 
### 
torn rees

Antiwar forces must make
significant gains in the 1970
Congressional elections if the
hawkish House of Representatives
is to favor measures limiting the
President's foreign policy power
during the next Congress. During
the 91st Congress, the House
failed to follow the Senate in its
frequent questioning of Nixon's
Vietnam and defense policies. The
Senate-passed Cooper-Church
Amendment Hopped in the House
on a nonrecorded vote, and the
ABM authorization cleared the
House by a 3-1 margin after
squeaking through the Senate by
one vote. Powerful Armed
Services Committee Chairman
Mendel Rivers (D-S.C.) has
consistently received House
approval for the fat defense
projects that he and the Pentagon
want.
Nevertheless, a growing
minority of Congressmen has
begun to question the military's
budget and the Asian war's
progress. In 1968, only
independent-minded progressives
like Phil Burton and Pete
McCloskey spoke out against the
war; now, most Northern
Democrats and many
moderate-to-liberal Republicans
have taken dovish stands. Further
desertion of the hawk's nest can
be anticipated as the war drags on;
dovish legislation that failed by
300 votes in 1968 andBs in 197 0
(as did Cooper-Church), could
stand a decent chance of passage
in 1971 and 1972. This possibility
will be greatly increased if antiwar
candidates show strongly at the
polls this November.
There are currently 15 very
close House races across the
country where doves (five
incumbents, 10 challengers) are
opposing Nixon-oriented hawks.
Most of the doves are young, all
are articulate on domestic as well
as foreign issues, and most of
them have the support of citizens'

group like the Movement for a
New Congress. While the odds
that all 15 candidates will win are
nearly nil, victories by 10 or more
would constitute a significant
rebuff to current Administration
policies.
The 15 races, with candidates
and districts:
Massachusetts 12th
District—Colorless Nixon
supporter Hastings Keith (R),
known in Washington for his
indecisiveness, faces a vigorous
challenge from McCarthy
Democrat Gerry Studds. In a
marginal district, a large plurality
for Senator Edward Kennedy may
lift Studds to victory.
New York, sth District—The
Republican New York legislature
redistricted this area to incumbent
Democrat Allard Lowenstein's
disadvantage, and his opponent,
Norman Lent, has attempted to
cast Lowenstein as a left-wing
extremist. The youthful, dovish
freshman Democrat is waging a
characteristically intense
campaign, but he is in serious
danger of losing his seat.
New Y o rk, 27 th
District—lncumbent Martin
McKneally (R), a former national
American Legion commander,
unseated one of the House's
charter doves, John G. Dow, in
1968. Dow may well turn the
tables on McKneally this fall,
especially after reports that
McKneally, a strong law-and-order
man, had allegedly paid no
income taxes from 1958 to 1967.
New York, 29 th District—ln
the tensest House battle in the
country, two incumbents, Daniel
Button (R) and Samuel S.
Stratton (D), square off after
reapportionment merged their
districts. Stratton, a high-ranking
Armed Services Committee
member, is one of the most
conservative Northern Democrats
and one of the most hawkish of
all members in the House. Button
is an antiwar liberal Republican a
la Pete McCloskey, and one of the

more distinguished, independent
Congressmen. A Stratton victory
would be simple disaster; the
House has too many Sam
Strattons and too few Dan
Buttons already.
New Jersey, Bth and 9th
Districts—lncumbent liberal
Robert Roe (D) was elected by a
razor-thin margin in a 1969
special election in the Eighth
District. This fall he faces a stiff
challenge by Nixon man Alfred
Fontanella. Leading dove Henry
Helstoski (D) has been barely
reelected twice in the heavily
Republican 9th District. This year
he is given a close edge over
Nixonite Henry Hoebel in this
suburban New York area.
Maryland, 5 th District-
Democrat Royal Hart, running on
a peace platform, stands a good
chance of defeating incumbent
Lawrence Hogan, a Nixon-Agnew
Republican, in the
middle-American suburbia of
Prince Georges County.
Virginia, 3rd District--A
Southern Republican moderate
(!), dovish law student Harvie
Wilkinson, is narrowly trailing
Bourbon incumbent David
Satterfield 3d in the Richmond
area. If GOP senatorial nominee
Ray Garland fares well in the area,
Wilkinson may retire the
ultra-conservative incumbent.
Virginia, 10 th District—Dyed
in-the-wool reactionary Rep. Joel
T. Broyhill (R) narrowly leads
Democrat dove Harold Miller.
Broyhill, who dislikes Blacks and
likes freeways, has used his
leverage on the House District of
Columbia committee to plan
expressways through Washington's
Black neighborhoods. The
capital's Virginia suburbs may
finally elect a modern man to the
House in 1970, after eighteen
years of Byrd Machine cog
Broyhill.
Ohio, 14 th District—ln urban
Akron, liberal Democrat John
Sieberling is running evenly with
Republican regular William Ayres.

Ayres, a ten-term veteran, is a
moderate conservative who is
reputed to be one of the more
ineffectual House members.
Indiana, 4th District—Rep. E.
Ross Aiair, ranking Republican
on the hawkish House Foreign
Affairs Committee, may lose to
former Rep. Edward Roush (D),
whom Adair defeated in 1968.
Roush is a moderate liberal and a
moderate dove in a prowar state;
he stands light years away from
the aging Adair on 1 97 0 's issues.
Kentucky, 3d District-State
Senator Romano Mazzoli (D), an
environmentalist and a dove, is
challenging incumbent William
Cowger (R). Environment groups
have called for the defeat of
Cowger and eleven other
Congressmen this fall because of
their anti-environment voting
records. Two of the 12, George
Fallon (D.Md.) and Byron Rogers
(D-Colo.) lost in party primaries,
and the conservative Cowger may
be the third casualty on the list,
which also names Ayres and
Adair.
Illinois, 23 rd District—The
paranoia level in the House will
rise sharply if Phyllis Schlafly (R)
unseats incumbent George Shipley
(D), a moderate and a recent
convert to the doves' ranks. Mrs.
Schlafly authored the cheap
Goldwater tract, A Choice Not an
Echo, 1964. In 1966, she
followed with Strike from Space,
with the basic message that the
Commies may come to get us in
flying saucers.
Wisconsin, Ist District—Rep.
Henry Schadberg (R), one of the
most conservative members of the
House, is evenly matched against
antiwar Democrat Les Aspin.
Schadeberg, the target of national
peace groups this fall, has never
enjoyed a large victory margin in
this district, where party strength
is almost even. Next to the
Stratton-Button race in New
York, this is the fall's closest
contest.
Colorado, Ist District—Demo-

crat Craig Barnes upset incumbent
Rogers in the September primary
by a 30-vote margin. A strong
dove, Barnes may lose Rogers'
conservative Democratic
support—and the election—to
Republican law-and-order man
James McKevitt. This Denver race
has been one of the nation's most
publicized 1 970 House contests,
with wide involvement of student
and antiwar groups.
Famous Doves
Of course, these fifteen
contests are not the only
dove-hawk confrontations in this
fall's Congressional races. In
several races, such
nationally-known doves as Ronald
Dellums of California, Robert
Drinan of Massachusetts, and
Bella Abzug of New York are
heavily favored to win. In
California, a large crop of
qualified antiwar challengers has
emerged; however, only one,
Democrat Gary Hart, opposing
Rep. Charles Teague in the 13th
District, has even an outside
chance at an upset. In another
longshot race, Andrew Young of
Atlanta might upset his right-wing
Republican opponent, Rep.
Fletcher Thompson, to become
the South's first Black
Congressman since
Reconstruction days.
The outcome of next week's
elections will indicate the nation's
attitude toward Nixon's policies;
as such, a dove surge in these
fifteen cliff-hanger races would
demonstrate some discontent over
the White House's handling of the
Vietnam. More importantly, the
antiwar strength in Congress
would increase, opening the
possibility of more successful
antiwar legislation in the 92 nd
Congress.

the tensest House battle in the
country, two incumbents, Daniel
Button (R) and Samuel S.
Stratton (D), square off after
reapportionment merged their
districts. Stratton, a high-ranking
Armed Services Committee
member, is one of the most
conservative Northern Democrats
and one of the most hawkish of
all members in the House. Button
is an antiwar liberal Republican a
la Pete McCloskey, and one of the

more distinguished, independent
Congressmen. A Stratton victory
would be simple disaster; the
House has too many Sam
Strattons and too few Dan
Buttons already.
New Jersey, Bth and 9th
Districts—lncumbent liberal
Robert Roe (D) was elected by a
razor-thin margin in a 1969
special election in the Eighth
District. This fall he faces a stiff
challenge by Nixon man Alfred
Fontanella. Leading dove Henry
Helstoski (D) has been barely
reelected twice in the heavily
Republican 9th District. This year
he is given a close edge over
Nixonite Henry Hoebel in this
suburban New York area.
Maryland, 5 th District-
Democrat Royal Hart, running on
a peace platform, stands a good
chance of defeating incumbent
Lawrence Hogan, a Nixon-Agnew
Republican, in the
middle-American suburbia of
Prince Georges County.
Virginia, 3rd District--A
Southern Republican moderate
(!), dovish law student Harvie
Wilkinson, is narrowly trailing
Bourbon incumbent David
Satterfield 3d in the Richmond
area. If GOP senatorial nominee
Ray Garland fares well in the area,
Wilkinson may retire the
ultra-conservative incumbent.
Virginia, 10 th District—Dyed
in-the-wool reactionary Rep. Joel
T. Broyhill (R) narrowly leads
Democrat dove Harold Miller.
Broyhill, who dislikes Blacks and
likes freeways, has used his
leverage on the House District of
Columbia committee to plan
expressways through Washington's
Black neighborhoods. The
capital's Virginia suburbs may
finally elect a modern man to the
House in 1970, after eighteen
years of Byrd Machine cog
Broyhill.
Ohio, 14 th District—ln urban
Akron, liberal Democrat John
Sieberling is running evenly with
Republican regular William Ayres.

Ayres, a ten-term veteran, is a
moderate conservative who is
reputed to be one of the more
ineffectual House members.
Indiana, 4th District—Rep. E.
Ross Aiair, ranking Republican
on the hawkish House Foreign
Affairs Committee, may lose to
former Rep. Edward Roush (D),
whom Adair defeated in 1968.
Roush is a moderate liberal and a
moderate dove in a prowar state;
he stands light years away from
the aging Adair on 1 97 0 's issues.
Kentucky, 3d District-State
Senator Romano Mazzoli (D), an
environmentalist and a dove, is
challenging incumbent William
Cowger (R). Environment groups
have called for the defeat of
Cowger and eleven other
Congressmen this fall because of
their anti-environment voting
records. Two of the 12, George
Fallon (D.Md.) and Byron Rogers
(D-Colo.) lost in party primaries,
and the conservative Cowger may
be the third casualty on the list,
which also names Ayres and
Adair.
Illinois, 23 rd District—The
paranoia level in the House will
rise sharply if Phyllis Schlafly (R)
unseats incumbent George Shipley
(D), a moderate and a recent
convert to the doves' ranks. Mrs.
Schlafly authored the cheap
Goldwater tract, A Choice Not an
Echo, 1964. In 1966, she
followed with Strike from Space,
with the basic message that the
Commies may come to get us in
flying saucers.
Wisconsin, Ist District—Rep.
Henry Schadberg (R), one of the
most conservative members of the
House, is evenly matched against
antiwar Democrat Les Aspin.
Schadeberg, the target of national
peace groups this fall, has never
enjoyed a large victory margin in
this district, where party strength
is almost even. Next to the
Stratton-Button race in New
York, this is the fall's closest
contest.
Colorado, Ist District—Demo-

crat Craig Barnes upset incumbent
Rogers in the September primary
by a 30-vote margin. A strong
dove, Barnes may lose Rogers'
conservative Democratic
support—and the election—to
Republican law-and-order man
James McKevitt. This Denver race
has been one of the nation's most
publicized 1 970 House contests,
with wide involvement of student
and antiwar groups.
Famous Doves
Of course, these fifteen
contests are not the only
dove-hawk confrontations in this
fall's Congressional races. In
several races, such
nationally-known doves as Ronald
Dellums of California, Robert
Drinan of Massachusetts, and
Bella Abzug of New York are
heavily favored to win. In
California, a large crop of
qualified antiwar challengers has
emerged; however, only one,
Democrat Gary Hart, opposing
Rep. Charles Teague in the 13th
District, has even an outside
chance at an upset. In another
longshot race, Andrew Young of
Atlanta might upset his right-wing
Republican opponent, Rep.
Fletcher Thompson, to become
the South's first Black
Congressman since
Reconstruction days.
The outcome of next week's
elections will indicate the nation's
attitude toward Nixon's policies;
as such, a dove surge in these
fifteen cliff-hanger races would
demonstrate some discontent over
the White House's handling of the
Vietnam. More importantly, the
antiwar strength in Congress
would increase, opening the
possibility of more successful
antiwar legislation in the 92 nd
Congress.

Antiwar forces must make
significant gains in the 1970
Congressional elections if the
hawkish House of Representatives
is to favor measures limiting the
President's foreign policy power
during the next Congress. During
the 91st Congress, the House
failed to follow the Senate in its
frequent questioning of Nixon's
Vietnam and defense policies. The
Senate-passed Cooper-Church
Amendment Hopped in the House
on a nonrecorded vote, and the
ABM authorization cleared the
House by a 3-1 margin after
squeaking through the Senate by
one vote. Powerful Armed
Services Committee Chairman
Mendel Rivers (D-S.C.) has
consistently received House
approval for the fat defense
projects that he and the Pentagon
want.
Nevertheless, a growing
minority of Congressmen has
begun to question the military's
budget and the Asian war's
progress. In 1968, only
independent-minded progressives
like Phil Burton and Pete
McCloskey spoke out against the
war; now, most Northern
Democrats and many
moderate-to-liberal Republicans
have taken dovish stands. Further
desertion of the hawk's nest can
be anticipated as the war drags on;
dovish legislation that failed by
300 votes in 1968 andBs in 197 0
(as did Cooper-Church), could
stand a decent chance of passage
in 1971 and 1972. This possibility
will be greatly increased if antiwar
candidates show strongly at the
polls this November.
There are currently 15 very
close House races across the
country where doves (five
incumbents, 10 challengers) are
opposing Nixon-oriented hawks.
Most of the doves are young, all
are articulate on domestic as well
as foreign issues, and most of
them have the support of citizens'

group like the Movement for a
New Congress. While the odds
that all 15 candidates will win are
nearly nil, victories by 10 or more
would constitute a significant
rebuff to current Administration
policies.
The 15 races, with candidates
and districts:
Massachusetts 12th
District—Colorless Nixon
supporter Hastings Keith (R),
known in Washington for his
indecisiveness, faces a vigorous
challenge from McCarthy
Democrat Gerry Studds. In a
marginal district, a large plurality
for Senator Edward Kennedy may
lift Studds to victory.
New York, sth District—The
Republican New York legislature
redistricted this area to incumbent
Democrat Allard Lowenstein's
disadvantage, and his opponent,
Norman Lent, has attempted to
cast Lowenstein as a left-wing
extremist. The youthful, dovish
freshman Democrat is waging a
characteristically intense
campaign, but he is in serious
danger of losing his seat.
New Y o rk, 27 th
District—lncumbent Martin
McKneally (R), a former national
American Legion commander,
unseated one of the House's
charter doves, John G. Dow, in
1968. Dow may well turn the
tables on McKneally this fall,
especially after reports that
McKneally, a strong law-and-order
man, had allegedly paid no
income taxes from 1958 to 1967.

be the third casualty on the list,
which also names Ayres and
Adair.
Illinois, 23 rd District—The
paranoia level in the House will
rise sharply if Phyllis Schlafly (R)
unseats incumbent George Shipley
(D), a moderate and a recent
convert to the doves' ranks. Mrs.
Schlafly authored the cheap
Goldwater tract, A Choice Not an
Echo, 1964. In 1966, she
followed with Strike from Space,
with the basic message that the
Commies may come to get us in
flying saucers.
Wisconsin, Ist District—Rep.
Henry Schadberg (R), one of the
most conservative members of the
House, is evenly matched against
antiwar Democrat Les Aspin.
Schadeberg, the target of national
peace groups this fall, has never
enjoyed a large victory margin in
this district, where party strength
is almost even. Next to the
Stratton-Button race in New
York, this is the fall's closest
contest.
Colorado, Ist District—Demo-

crat Craig Barnes upset incumbent
Rogers in the September primary
by a 30-vote margin. A strong
dove, Barnes may lose Rogers'
conservative Democratic
support—and the election—to
Republican law-and-order man
James McKevitt. This Denver race
has been one of the nation's most
publicized 1 970 House contests,
with wide involvement of student
and antiwar groups.
Famous Doves
Of course, these fifteen
contests are not the only
dove-hawk confrontations in this
fall's Congressional races. In
several races, such
nationally-known doves as Ronald
Dellums of California, Robert
Drinan of Massachusetts, and
Bella Abzug of New York are
heavily favored to win. In
California, a large crop of
qualified antiwar challengers has
emerged; however, only one,
Democrat Gary Hart, opposing
Rep. Charles Teague in the 13th
District, has even an outside
chance at an upset. In another
longshot race, Andrew Young of
Atlanta might upset his right-wing
Republican opponent, Rep.
Fletcher Thompson, to become
the South's first Black
Congressman since
Reconstruction days.
The outcome of next week's
elections will indicate the nation's
attitude toward Nixon's policies;
as such, a dove surge in these
fifteen cliff-hanger races would
demonstrate some discontent over
the White House's handling of the
Vietnam. More importantly, the
antiwar strength in Congress
would increase, opening the
possibility of more successful
antiwar legislation in the 92 nd
Congress.

Antiwar forces must make
significant gains in the 1970
Congressional elections if the
hawkish House of Representatives
is to favor measures limiting the
President's foreign policy power
during the next Congress. During
the 91st Congress, the House
failed to follow the Senate in its
frequent questioning of Nixon's
Vietnam and defense policies. The
Senate-passed Cooper-Church
Amendment Hopped in the House
on a nonrecorded vote, and the
ABM authorization cleared the
House by a 3-1 margin after
squeaking through the Senate by
one vote. Powerful Armed
Services Committee Chairman
Mendel Rivers (D-S.C.) has
consistently received House
approval for the fat defense
projects that he and the Pentagon
want.
Nevertheless, a growing
minority of Congressmen has
begun to question the military's
budget and the Asian war's
progress. In 1968, only
independent-minded progressives
like Phil Burton and Pete
McCloskey spoke out against the
war; now, most Northern
Democrats and many
moderate-to-liberal Republicans
have taken dovish stands. Further
desertion of the hawk's nest can
be anticipated as the war drags on;
dovish legislation that failed by
300 votes in 1968 andBs in 197 0
(as did Cooper-Church), could
stand a decent chance of passage
in 1971 and 1972. This possibility
will be greatly increased if antiwar
candidates show strongly at the
polls this November.
There are currently 15 very
close House races across the
country where doves (five
incumbents, 10 challengers) are
opposing Nixon-oriented hawks.
Most of the doves are young, all
are articulate on domestic as well
as foreign issues, and most of
them have the support of citizens'

group like the Movement for a
New Congress. While the odds
that all 15 candidates will win are
nearly nil, victories by 10 or more
would constitute a significant
rebuff to current Administration
policies.
The 15 races, with candidates
and districts:
Massachusetts 12th
District—Colorless Nixon
supporter Hastings Keith (R),
known in Washington for his
indecisiveness, faces a vigorous
challenge from McCarthy
Democrat Gerry Studds. In a
marginal district, a large plurality
for Senator Edward Kennedy may
lift Studds to victory.
New York, sth District—The
Republican New York legislature
redistricted this area to incumbent
Democrat Allard Lowenstein's
disadvantage, and his opponent,
Norman Lent, has attempted to
cast Lowenstein as a left-wing
extremist. The youthful, dovish
freshman Democrat is waging a
characteristically intense
campaign, but he is in serious
danger of losing his seat.
New Y o rk, 27 th
District—lncumbent Martin
McKneally (R), a former national
American Legion commander,
unseated one of the House's
charter doves, John G. Dow, in
1968. Dow may well turn the
tables on McKneally this fall,
especially after reports that
McKneally, a strong law-and-order
man, had allegedly paid no
income taxes from 1958 to 1967.
New York, 29 th District—ln
the tensest House battle in the
country, two incumbents, Daniel
Button (R) and Samuel S.
Stratton (D), square off after
reapportionment merged their
districts. Stratton, a high-ranking
Armed Services Committee
member, is one of the most
conservative Northern Democrats
and one of the most hawkish of
all members in the House. Button
is an antiwar liberal Republican a
la Pete McCloskey, and one of the

more distinguished, independent
Congressmen. A Stratton victory
would be simple disaster; the
House has too many Sam
Strattons and too few Dan
Buttons already.
New Jersey, Bth and 9th
Districts—lncumbent liberal
Robert Roe (D) was elected by a
razor-thin margin in a 1969
special election in the Eighth
District. This fall he faces a stiff
challenge by Nixon man Alfred
Fontanella. Leading dove Henry
Helstoski (D) has been barely
reelected twice in the heavily
Republican 9th District. This year
he is given a close edge over
Nixonite Henry Hoebel in this
suburban New York area.
Maryland, 5 th District-
Democrat Royal Hart, running on
a peace platform, stands a good
chance of defeating incumbent
Lawrence Hogan, a Nixon-Agnew
Republican, in the
middle-American suburbia of
Prince Georges County.
Virginia, 3rd District--A
Southern Republican moderate
(!), dovish law student Harvie
Wilkinson, is narrowly trailing
Bourbon incumbent David
Satterfield 3d in the Richmond
area. If GOP senatorial nominee
Ray Garland fares well in the area,
Wilkinson may retire the
ultra-conservative incumbent.
Virginia, 10 th District—Dyed
in-the-wool reactionary Rep. Joel
T. Broyhill (R) narrowly leads
Democrat dove Harold Miller.
Broyhill, who dislikes Blacks and
likes freeways, has used his
leverage on the House District of
Columbia committee to plan
expressways through Washington's
Black neighborhoods. The
capital's Virginia suburbs may
finally elect a modern man to the
House in 1970, after eighteen
years of Byrd Machine cog
Broyhill.
Ohio, 14 th District—ln urban
Akron, liberal Democrat John
Sieberling is running evenly with
Republican regular William Ayres.

Ayres, a ten-term veteran, is a
moderate conservative who is
reputed to be one of the more
ineffectual House members.
Indiana, 4th District—Rep. E.
Ross Aiair, ranking Republican
on the hawkish House Foreign
Affairs Committee, may lose to
former Rep. Edward Roush (D),
whom Adair defeated in 1968.
Roush is a moderate liberal and a
moderate dove in a prowar state;
he stands light years away from
the aging Adair on 1 97 0 's issues.
Kentucky, 3d District-State
Senator Romano Mazzoli (D), an
environmentalist and a dove, is
challenging incumbent William
Cowger (R). Environment groups
have called for the defeat of
Cowger and eleven other
Congressmen this fall because of
their anti-environment voting
records. Two of the 12, George
Fallon (D.Md.) and Byron Rogers
(D-Colo.) lost in party primaries,
and the conservative Cowger may
be the third casualty on the list,
which also names Ayres and
Adair.
Illinois, 23 rd District—The

House by a 3-1 margin after
squeaking through the Senate by
one vote. Powerful Armed
Services Committee Chairman
Mendel Rivers (D-S.C.) has
consistently received House
approval for the fat defense
projects that he and the Pentagon
want.
Nevertheless, a growing
minority of Congressmen has
begun to question the military's
budget and the Asian war's
progress. In 1968, only
independent-minded progressives
like Phil Burton and Pete
McCloskey spoke out against the
war; now, most Northern
Democrats and many
moderate-to-liberal Republicans
have taken dovish stands. Further
desertion of the hawk's nest can
be anticipated as the war drags on;
dovish legislation that failed by
300 votes in 1968 andBs in 197 0
(as did Cooper-Church), could
stand a decent chance of passage
in 1971 and 1972. This possibility
will be greatly increased if antiwar
candidates show strongly at the
polls this November.
There are currently 15 very
close House races across the
country where doves (five
incumbents, 10 challengers) are
opposing Nixon-oriented hawks.
Most of the doves are young, all
are articulate on domestic as well
as foreign issues, and most of
them have the support of citizens'

group like the Movement for a
New Congress. While the odds
that all 15 candidates will win are
nearly nil, victories by 10 or more
would constitute a significant
rebuff to current Administration
policies.
The 15 races, with candidates
and districts:
Massachusetts 12th
District—Colorless Nixon
supporter Hastings Keith (R),
known in Washington for his
indecisiveness, faces a vigorous
challenge from McCarthy
Democrat Gerry Studds. In a
marginal district, a large plurality
for Senator Edward Kennedy may
lift Studds to victory.
New York, sth District—The
Republican New York legislature
redistricted this area to incumbent
Democrat Allard Lowenstein's
disadvantage, and his opponent,
Norman Lent, has attempted to
cast Lowenstein as a left-wing
extremist. The youthful, dovish
freshman Democrat is waging a
characteristically intense
campaign, but he is in serious
danger of losing his seat.
New Y o rk, 27 th
District—lncumbent Martin
McKneally (R), a former national
American Legion commander,
unseated one of the House's
charter doves, John G. Dow, in
1968. Dow may well turn the
tables on McKneally this fall,
especially after reports that
McKneally, a strong law-and-order
man, had allegedly paid no
income taxes from 1958 to 1967.
New York, 29 th District—ln
the tensest House battle in the
country, two incumbents, Daniel
Button (R) and Samuel S.
Stratton (D), square off after
reapportionment merged their
districts. Stratton, a high-ranking
Armed Services Committee
member, is one of the most
conservative Northern Democrats
and one of the most hawkish of
all members in the House. Button
is an antiwar liberal Republican a
la Pete McCloskey, and one of the

more distinguished, independent
Congressmen. A Stratton victory
would be simple disaster; the
House has too many Sam
Strattons and too few Dan
Buttons already.
New Jersey, Bth and 9th
Districts—lncumbent liberal
Robert Roe (D) was elected by a
razor-thin margin in a 1969
special election in the Eighth
District. This fall he faces a stiff
challenge by Nixon man Alfred
Fontanella. Leading dove Henry
Helstoski (D) has been barely
reelected twice in the heavily
Republican 9th District. This year
he is given a close edge over
Nixonite Henry Hoebel in this
suburban New York area.
Maryland, 5 th District-
Democrat Royal Hart, running on
a peace platform, stands a good
chance of defeating incumbent
Lawrence Hogan, a Nixon-Agnew
Republican, in the
middle-American suburbia of
Prince Georges County.
Virginia, 3rd District--A
Southern Republican moderate
(!), dovish law student Harvie
Wilkinson, is narrowly trailing
Bourbon incumbent David
Satterfield 3d in the Richmond
area. If GOP senatorial nominee
Ray Garland fares well in the area,
Wilkinson may retire the
ultra-conservative incumbent.
Virginia, 10 th District—Dyed
in-the-wool reactionary Rep. Joel
T. Broyhill (R) narrowly leads
Democrat dove Harold Miller.
Broyhill, who dislikes Blacks and
likes freeways, has used his
leverage on the House District of
Columbia committee to plan
expressways through Washington's
Black neighborhoods. The
capital's Virginia suburbs may
finally elect a modern man to the
House in 1970, after eighteen
years of Byrd Machine cog
Broyhill.
Ohio, 14 th District—ln urban
Akron, liberal Democrat John
Sieberling is running evenly with
Republican regular William Ayres.

Ayres, a ten-term veteran, is a
moderate conservative who is
reputed to be one of the more
ineffectual House members.
Indiana, 4th District—Rep. E.
Ross Aiair, ranking Republican
on the hawkish House Foreign
Affairs Committee, may lose to
former Rep. Edward Roush (D),
whom Adair defeated in 1968.
Roush is a moderate liberal and a
moderate dove in a prowar state;
he stands light years away from
the aging Adair on 1 97 0 's issues.
Kentucky, 3d District-State
Senator Romano Mazzoli (D), an
environmentalist and a dove, is
challenging incumbent William
Cowger (R). Environment groups
have called for the defeat of
Cowger and eleven other
Congressmen this fall because of
their anti-environment voting
records. Two of the 12, George
Fallon (D.Md.) and Byron Rogers
(D-Colo.) lost in party primaries,
and the conservative Cowger may
be the third casualty on the list,
which also names Ayres and
Adair.
Illinois, 23 rd District—The
paranoia level in the House will
rise sharply if Phyllis Schlafly (R)
unseats incumbent George Shipley
(D), a moderate and a recent
convert to the doves' ranks. Mrs.
Schlafly authored the cheap
Goldwater tract, A Choice Not an
Echo, 1964. In 1966, she
followed with Strike from Space,
with the basic message that the
Commies may come to get us in
flying saucers.
Wisconsin, Ist District—Rep.
Henry Schadberg (R), one of the
most conservative members of the
House, is evenly matched against
antiwar Democrat Les Aspin.
Schadeberg, the target of national
peace groups this fall, has never
enjoyed a large victory margin in
this district, where party strength
is almost even. Next to the
Stratton-Button race in New
York, this is the fall's closest
contest.
Colorado, Ist District—Demo-

crat Craig Barnes upset incumbent
Rogers in the September primary
by a 30-vote margin. A strong
dove, Barnes may lose Rogers'
conservative Democratic
support—and the election—to
Republican law-and-order man
James McKevitt. This Denver race
has been one of the nation's most
publicized 1 970 House contests,
with wide involvement of student
and antiwar groups.
Famous Doves
Of course, these fifteen
contests are not the only
dove-hawk confrontations in this
fall's Congressional races. In
several races, such
nationally-known doves as Ronald
Dellums of California, Robert
Drinan of Massachusetts, and
Bella Abzug of New York are
heavily favored to win. In
California, a large crop of
qualified antiwar challengers has
emerged; however, only one,
Democrat Gary Hart, opposing
Rep. Charles Teague in the 13th
District, has even an outside
chance at an upset. In another
longshot race, Andrew Young of
Atlanta might upset his right-wing
Republican opponent, Rep.
Fletcher Thompson, to become
the South's first Black
Congressman since
Reconstruction days.
The outcome of next week's
elections will indicate the nation's
attitude toward Nixon's policies;
as such, a dove surge in these
fifteen cliff-hanger races would
demonstrate some discontent over
the White House's handling of the
Vietnam. More importantly, the
antiwar strength in Congress
would increase, opening the
possibility of more successful
antiwar legislation in the 92 nd
Congress.

Antiwar forces must make
significant gains in the 1970
Congressional elections if the
hawkish House of Representatives
is to favor measures limiting the
President's foreign policy power
during the next Congress. During
the 91st Congress, the House
failed to follow the Senate in its
frequent questioning of Nixon's
Vietnam and defense policies. The

House has too many Sam
Strattons and too few Dan
Buttons already.
New Jersey, Bth and 9th
Districts—lncumbent liberal
Robert Roe (D) was elected by a
razor-thin margin in a 1969
special election in the Eighth
District. This fall he faces a stiff
challenge by Nixon man Alfred
Fontanella. Leading dove Henry
Helstoski (D) has been barely
reelected twice in the heavily
Republican 9th District. This year
he is given a close edge over
Nixonite Henry Hoebel in this
suburban New York area.
Maryland, 5 th District-
Democrat Royal Hart, running on
a peace platform, stands a good
chance of defeating incumbent
Lawrence Hogan, a Nixon-Agnew
Republican, in the
middle-American suburbia of
Prince Georges County.
Virginia, 3rd District--A
Southern Republican moderate
(!), dovish law student Harvie
Wilkinson, is narrowly trailing
Bourbon incumbent David
Satterfield 3d in the Richmond
area. If GOP senatorial nominee
Ray Garland fares well in the area,
Wilkinson may retire the
ultra-conservative incumbent.
Virginia, 10 th District—Dyed
in-the-wool reactionary Rep. Joel
T. Broyhill (R) narrowly leads
Democrat dove Harold Miller.
Broyhill, who dislikes Blacks and
likes freeways, has used his
leverage on the House District of
Columbia committee to plan
expressways through Washington's
Black neighborhoods. The
capital's Virginia suburbs may
finally elect a modern man to the
House in 1970, after eighteen
years of Byrd Machine cog
Broyhill.
Ohio, 14 th District—ln urban
Akron, liberal Democrat John
Sieberling is running evenly with
Republican regular William Ayres.

Ayres, a ten-term veteran, is a
moderate conservative who is
reputed to be one of the more
ineffectual House members.
Indiana, 4th District—Rep. E.
Ross Aiair, ranking Republican
on the hawkish House Foreign
Affairs Committee, may lose to
former Rep. Edward Roush (D),
whom Adair defeated in 1968.
Roush is a moderate liberal and a
moderate dove in a prowar state;
he stands light years away from
the aging Adair on 1 97 0 's issues.
Kentucky, 3d District-State
Senator Romano Mazzoli (D), an
environmentalist and a dove, is
challenging incumbent William
Cowger (R). Environment groups
have called for the defeat of
Cowger and eleven other
Congressmen this fall because of
their anti-environment voting
records. Two of the 12, George
Fallon (D.Md.) and Byron Rogers
(D-Colo.) lost in party primaries,
and the conservative Cowger may
be the third casualty on the list,
which also names Ayres and
Adair.
Illinois, 23 rd District—The
paranoia level in the House will
rise sharply if Phyllis Schlafly (R)
unseats incumbent George Shipley
(D), a moderate and a recent
convert to the doves' ranks. Mrs.
Schlafly authored the cheap
Goldwater tract, A Choice Not an
Echo, 1964. In 1966, she
followed with Strike from Space,
with the basic message that the
Commies may come to get us in
flying saucers.
Wisconsin, Ist District—Rep.
Henry Schadberg (R), one of the
most conservative members of the
House, is evenly matched against
antiwar Democrat Les Aspin.
Schadeberg, the target of national
peace groups this fall, has never
enjoyed a large victory margin in
this district, where party strength
is almost even. Next to the
Stratton-Button race in New
York, this is the fall's closest
contest.
Colorado, Ist District—Demo-

crat Craig Barnes upset incumbent
Rogers in the September primary
by a 30-vote margin. A strong
dove, Barnes may lose Rogers'
conservative Democratic
support—and the election—to
Republican law-and-order man
James McKevitt. This Denver race
has been one of the nation's most
publicized 1 970 House contests,
with wide involvement of student
and antiwar groups.
Famous Doves
Of course, these fifteen
contests are not the only
dove-hawk confrontations in this
fall's Congressional races. In
several races, such
nationally-known doves as Ronald
Dellums of California, Robert
Drinan of Massachusetts, and
Bella Abzug of New York are
heavily favored to win. In
California, a large crop of
qualified antiwar challengers has
emerged; however, only one,
Democrat Gary Hart, opposing
Rep. Charles Teague in the 13th
District, has even an outside
chance at an upset. In another
longshot race, Andrew Young of
Atlanta might upset his right-wing
Republican opponent, Rep.
Fletcher Thompson, to become
the South's first Black
Congressman since
Reconstruction days.
The outcome of next week's
elections will indicate the nation's
attitude toward Nixon's policies;
as such, a dove surge in these
fifteen cliff-hanger races would
demonstrate some discontent over
the White House's handling of the
Vietnam. More importantly, the
antiwar strength in Congress
would increase, opening the
possibility of more successful
antiwar legislation in the 92 nd
Congress.

torn rees

Antiwar forces must make
significant gains in the 1970
Congressional elections if the
hawkish House of Representatives
is to favor measures limiting the
President's foreign policy power
during the next Congress. During
the 91st Congress, the House
failed to follow the Senate in its
frequent questioning of Nixon's
Vietnam and defense policies. The
Senate-passed Cooper-Church
Amendment Hopped in the House
on a nonrecorded vote, and the
ABM authorization cleared the
House by a 3-1 margin after
squeaking through the Senate by
one vote. Powerful Armed
Services Committee Chairman
Mendel Rivers (D-S.C.) has
consistently received House
approval for the fat defense
projects that he and the Pentagon
want.
Nevertheless, a growing
minority of Congressmen has
begun to question the military's
budget and the Asian war's
progress. In 1968, only
independent-minded progressives
like Phil Burton and Pete
McCloskey spoke out against the
war; now, most Northern
Democrats and many
moderate-to-liberal Republicans
have taken dovish stands. Further
desertion of the hawk's nest can
be anticipated as the war drags on;
dovish legislation that failed by
300 votes in 1968 andBs in 197 0
(as did Cooper-Church), could
stand a decent chance of passage
in 1971 and 1972. This possibility
will be greatly increased if antiwar
candidates show strongly at the
polls this November.
There are currently 15 very
close House races across the
country where doves (five
incumbents, 10 challengers) are
opposing Nixon-oriented hawks.
Most of the doves are young, all
are articulate on domestic as well
as foreign issues, and most of
them have the support of citizens'

group like the Movement for a
New Congress. While the odds
that all 15 candidates will win are
nearly nil, victories by 10 or more
would constitute a significant
rebuff to current Administration
policies.
The 15 races, with candidates
and districts:
Massachusetts 12th
District—Colorless Nixon
supporter Hastings Keith (R),
known in Washington for his
indecisiveness, faces a vigorous
challenge from McCarthy
Democrat Gerry Studds. In a
marginal district, a large plurality
for Senator Edward Kennedy may
lift Studds to victory.
New York, sth District—The
Republican New York legislature
redistricted this area to incumbent
Democrat Allard Lowenstein's
disadvantage, and his opponent,
Norman Lent, has attempted to
cast Lowenstein as a left-wing
extremist. The youthful, dovish
freshman Democrat is waging a
characteristically intense
campaign, but he is in serious
danger of losing his seat.
New Y o rk, 27 th
District—lncumbent Martin
McKneally (R), a former national
American Legion commander,
unseated one of the House's
charter doves, John G. Dow, in
1968. Dow may well turn the
tables on McKneally this fall,
especially after reports that
McKneally, a strong law-and-order
man, had allegedly paid no
income taxes from 1958 to 1967.
New York, 29 th District—ln
the tensest House battle in the
country, two incumbents, Daniel
Button (R) and Samuel S.
Stratton (D), square off after
reapportionment merged their
districts. Stratton, a high-ranking
Armed Services Committee
member, is one of the most
conservative Northern Democrats
and one of the most hawkish of
all members in the House. Button
is an antiwar liberal Republican a
la Pete McCloskey, and one of the

more distinguished, independent
Congressmen. A Stratton victory
would be simple disaster; the
House has too many Sam
Strattons and too few Dan
Buttons already.
