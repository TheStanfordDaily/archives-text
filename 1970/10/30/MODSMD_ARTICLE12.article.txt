## Terrorism--New Fight For Survival 
### 
Robert s. elegant

Unlike ferocious man, most
animals do not normally kill other
members of the same community.
Only when space and food
become critically short will a pack
of rats rend each other.
Many individuals then die to
preserve the community.
Lemmings are more civilized.
They commit suicide en masse.
Terrorism is a gruesome—and
ever spreading—phenomenon of
the modern world. It may serve
the same purpose as the rat packs'
internal strife and the lemmings'
rush to the sea—preventing the
race's overrunning its habitable
space and its food supplies. Most
of the historical means which
maintained the balance between
man and his environment have
been blocked by man's ingenuity.
War previously served an
essential biological end, preserving

the species by eliminating
excessive individuals. The
surplus—or unsupportable—per
sons war did not eliminate were
expunged by nature's ruthless
devices—pestilence, famine, flood
and drought.
Recklessness
More reckless and mindless
each passing day, terrorism may
be an unconscious attempt to
preserve the race by preventing
excessive numbers overwhelming
the habitat. Terrorism is
particularly effective in a
community of light-speed
communication, overspreading
mass media, interdependent
economies and interlocked
technologies.
The immediate causes of
terrorism are social, psychological,
and political. But the problem is,
ultimately, biological—sheer

survival. Individual humans are
destroying each other, ostensibly
to alter the social order. They
may be working for the ultimate
good of the race; they may be
effecting its destruction.
Ultimate End
Carried to the ultimate,
terrorism could destroy not only
existing societies, but the network
of tacit relationships and
understanding which makes
organized human life possible.
Such destruction is unlikely.
The gravest immediate danger
it invites is systematic repression,
arising from immediate measures
to cope with individual
kidnapings, murders, bombings
and hijackings. A new tyranny of
"protection" could appear
necessary. Axiomatically,
tyrannies become even more
repressive to maintain themselves

against ever-increasing resistance.
Terrorism is provoked by the
tensions, frustrations,
boredom—and opportunities—of
the new mass society, which may
well be evolving toward
destruction. The basic social
compact is denied when the
individual conscience becomes the
final arbiter of all things.
All Terrorists
Whether Palestinians, Stern
gang, Weatherman, "liberation"
fronts, or Chinese
"counter-revolutionaries," all
effective terrorists possess two
common traits. They know they
are perfectly good, while society
is totally evil.
Whether a terrorist is "right"
or "wrong" depends of course
upon the individual observer's
judgment. But indiscriminate
violence has already become a

virtue in itself. "Disorder is
good!" as chairman Mao Tse-tung
of the Chinese Communist Party
proclaimed. The inevitable final
reaction, displayed by Canada's
once-swinging Premier Pierre
Elliott Trudeau, is determination
to crush "insurrection" by martial
measures.
Terrorism is by no means a
new phenomenon or unique to
our age of anxiety. The anarchists
of the late 1800s developed the
mystique and techniques to a high
art. But the technological era has
raised terrorism to new heights.
Not only is the intricate social and
economic fabric exceedingly
vulnerable. Widespread reporting
of terrorist deeds positively invites
emulation.
Hundreds of millions still live
on the edge of subsistence in the
underdeveloped world, and tens
of thousands starve. But the chief
pressures that impel individuals to
ravage the community are not
hunger and deprivation. They are
frustration, boredom and
individual impotence.
If the tentative analysis is
correct, terrorism is a symptom of
the deep social malaise of the
20 th Century and a violent assault
on the society. Repression of
specific symptoms will in the long
run avail no more than will
creation of a systematically
repressive society.
One specific countermeasure is
obviously essential—a total
campaign to control population
expansion. Even more important
is what William James called "the
moral equivalent of war"—and,
perhaps, biological equivalent as
well.
