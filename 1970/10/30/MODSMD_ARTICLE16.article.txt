# Free U Gives Gun Laws Course For Radicals
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
As confrontations between
militant radicals and police
increase, arrests due to illegal
possession and use of firearms
have emerged as a major tactic in
police efforts to quell
revolutionary offensives.
In response, a Mid-Peninsula
Free University course entitled
"Gun Laws for Revolutionaries"
has been organized to discuss
problems of radicals with guns
and to propose some legal
precautions Black Panthers and
similar groups might follow to
escape the brunt of police action
concerning possession of firearms.
The Palo Alto Legal Defense
Committee conceived the course
as a primer for California and
national gun laws. In the past,
Legal Defense has provided bail
and legal counseling for people
arrested at Stanford during the
past two years.
Presentation of the "Gun
Laws" course represents a
departure from defensive tactics
into the realm of preventative
information for persons arrested
for political crimes. The Legal
Defense representative teaching
the "gun Laws" course, a
Stanford Law School graduate,
describes the course as one
"designed to keep people out of
jail and to explain to people how
to avoid getting into situations
where they can get busted."
Panthers Are Catalysts
In a pamphlet distributed at
Tuesday night session of the class,
the Black Panthers, and Huey
Newton more specifically, are
cited as the catalyst for present
gun laws. "As the spectre of Huey
P. Newton rises over the terrified
legislatures across the country,"
the pamphlet reads, "tighter gun
control laws have already and will
increasingly be passed."
Legal Defense examined
present gun laws and then
presented two courses of action
which Panthers and other similar
groups might examine as a means
of circumventing state and federal gun
control laws.
First, there is the possibility of
a Panther defending his possession
of a gun where it otherwise
would be illegal and grounds for
arrest by claiming "present
immediate danger" to either him
or his property.

Citing a federal statute which
provides that "it is lawful to carry
a loaded firearm, if otherwise
unlawful, where one reasonably
believes that the person or
property of himself or another is
in immediate danger and the
preservation of such person or
property requires carrying a
firearm," the Legal Defense
representative laid the legal
foundation for a claim of
self-defense that could be made
by a Panther.
Police As A Threat
The question of whether
Panthers are in immediate danger
from the police is the crux of the
Legal Defense proposal. The
legality of carrying a loaded
firearm is severely restricted by
both federal and state gun laws,
but this one clause does override
other statutes regardless of their
requirements.

"This has interesting but
ambiguous possibilities because it
has never been tested," the Free U
instructor said, "but it's a
question of political judgement
essentially, and we're only
speculating about its
possibilities."
Even a political verification of
such a self-defense argument
would be difficult to prove in the
case of the Panthers and police.
Perhaps the police do present an
immediate danger, but such an
argument could be conversely
made about the danger the
Panthers present to police,
thereby weakening considerable
the legal loophole.
A second approach open to
radicals was presented by a Free U
instructor who is a lifelong
member of the National Rifle
Association. A seemingly unlikely
coalition between the NRA and

radicals was proposed as another
legal means of assuring
revolutionaries the right of
bearing arms.
Strong lobbying by the NRA
has created special gun control
laws for NRA members who are in
the process of going to or
returning from a hunting or a
fishing trip. Theoretically, radicals
who payed the $12.5 0 annual
dues to the NRA would qualify
for the special treatment.
NRA Protection
If police stopped a carload of
Black Panthers and tried to arrest
those members with guns,
presentation of a NRA
Membership card and the address
of the local target range would
foil any attempts by police to
confiscate the weapons. "It might
be interesting," the Legal Defense
representative quipped, "if the
Panthers started carrying around
fishing nets" as proof of
participation in a fishing trip.
A more probable adaptation of
the NRA-radical coalition
concerns teaching and

demonstrating firearm usage.
Under the Civil Rights Act of
1968, "teaching or demonstrating
the use, application, or making of
any firearm, ... for use in Civil
disorder" is a felonious offense.
NRA instruction is generally
accepted as legitimate instruction
however, and could serve as a
cover for Panther training, the
Legal Defense representative
concluded.
In the pamphlet distributed at
the class meeting, a protective
suggestion is made to would-be
instructors of firearms classes.
"In classes on the use of firearms,
instructors should state before all
that it is his wish that none of the
info or training there imparted
will "in any way or degree
obstruct, delay or adversely affect
interstate commerce, or the
conduct or performance of any
federally protected function or
further civil disorder."
Gun Usage Course
Such a statement, said the
Legal Defense man, would have a
deterring effect on federal

investigators either in the class or
later on in the courtroom. "The
hope would be," he noted, "that
in terms of political judgement,
membership in an NRA group
would be considered legitimate by
the courts and the government."
A course in gun usage is in fact
being taught at the present time in
connection with the Free U. It's
leader, the same NRA member
mentioned above described the
cause as one, "primarily for
long-hairs afraid of no-knock
rules."
Fear of no-knock rules isn't the
only reason the Free U. gun

course is being taught. Nor does 1
explain motives, involved in a
course dealing with gun laws.
"There could only be one reason
for taking the Gun Law course," a
Stanford radical at the meeting
said, "If you're involved with guns
you've got to know what's going
to be happening around you when
you use them."
"Having a gun is a kind of
mind easer," smiled the NRA
radical, "it's nice to have the
peace of mind a firearm gives."
Whether that peace of mind is
universal among society is another
question.

past two years.
Presentation of the "Gun
Laws" course represents a
departure from defensive tactics
into the realm of preventative
information for persons arrested
for political crimes. The Legal
Defense representative teaching
the "gun Laws" course, a
Stanford Law School graduate,
describes the course as one
"designed to keep people out of
jail and to explain to people how
to avoid getting into situations
where they can get busted."
Panthers Are Catalysts
In a pamphlet distributed at
Tuesday night session of the class,
the Black Panthers, and Huey
Newton more specifically, are
cited as the catalyst for present
gun laws. "As the spectre of Huey
P. Newton rises over the terrified
legislatures across the country,"
the pamphlet reads, "tighter gun
control laws have already and will
increasingly be passed."
Legal Defense examined
present gun laws and then
presented two courses of action
which Panthers and other similar
groups might examine as a means
of circumventing state and federal gun
control laws.
First, there is the possibility of
a Panther defending his possession
of a gun where it otherwise
would be illegal and grounds for
arrest by claiming "present
immediate danger" to either him
or his property.

Citing a federal statute which
provides that "it is lawful to carry
a loaded firearm, if otherwise
unlawful, where one reasonably
believes that the person or
property of himself or another is
in immediate danger and the
preservation of such person or
property requires carrying a
firearm," the Legal Defense
representative laid the legal
foundation for a claim of
self-defense that could be made
by a Panther.
Police As A Threat
The question of whether
Panthers are in immediate danger
from the police is the crux of the
Legal Defense proposal. The
legality of carrying a loaded
firearm is severely restricted by
both federal and state gun laws,
but this one clause does override
other statutes regardless of their
requirements.

"This has interesting but
ambiguous possibilities because it
has never been tested," the Free U
instructor said, "but it's a
question of political judgement
essentially, and we're only
speculating about its
possibilities."
Even a political verification of
such a self-defense argument
would be difficult to prove in the
case of the Panthers and police.
Perhaps the police do present an
immediate danger, but such an
argument could be conversely
made about the danger the
Panthers present to police,
thereby weakening considerable
the legal loophole.
A second approach open to
radicals was presented by a Free U
instructor who is a lifelong
member of the National Rifle
Association. A seemingly unlikely
coalition between the NRA and

radicals was proposed as another
legal means of assuring
revolutionaries the right of
bearing arms.
Strong lobbying by the NRA
has created special gun control
laws for NRA members who are in
the process of going to or
returning from a hunting or a
fishing trip. Theoretically, radicals
who payed the $12.5 0 annual
dues to the NRA would qualify
for the special treatment.
NRA Protection
If police stopped a carload of
Black Panthers and tried to arrest
those members with guns,
presentation of a NRA
Membership card and the address
of the local target range would
foil any attempts by police to
confiscate the weapons. "It might
be interesting," the Legal Defense
representative quipped, "if the
Panthers started carrying around
fishing nets" as proof of
participation in a fishing trip.
A more probable adaptation of
the NRA-radical coalition
concerns teaching and

demonstrating firearm usage.
Under the Civil Rights Act of
1968, "teaching or demonstrating
the use, application, or making of
any firearm, ... for use in Civil
disorder" is a felonious offense.
NRA instruction is generally
accepted as legitimate instruction
however, and could serve as a
cover for Panther training, the
Legal Defense representative
concluded.
In the pamphlet distributed at
the class meeting, a protective
suggestion is made to would-be
instructors of firearms classes.
"In classes on the use of firearms,
instructors should state before all
that it is his wish that none of the
info or training there imparted
will "in any way or degree
obstruct, delay or adversely affect
interstate commerce, or the
conduct or performance of any
federally protected function or
further civil disorder."
Gun Usage Course
Such a statement, said the
Legal Defense man, would have a
deterring effect on federal

investigators either in the class or
later on in the courtroom. "The
hope would be," he noted, "that
in terms of political judgement,
membership in an NRA group
would be considered legitimate by
the courts and the government."
A course in gun usage is in fact
being taught at the present time in
connection with the Free U. It's
leader, the same NRA member
mentioned above described the
cause as one, "primarily for
long-hairs afraid of no-knock
rules."
Fear of no-knock rules isn't the
only reason the Free U. gun

course is being taught. Nor does 1
explain motives, involved in a
course dealing with gun laws.
"There could only be one reason
for taking the Gun Law course," a
Stanford radical at the meeting
said, "If you're involved with guns
you've got to know what's going
to be happening around you when
you use them."
"Having a gun is a kind of
mind easer," smiled the NRA
radical, "it's nice to have the
peace of mind a firearm gives."
Whether that peace of mind is
universal among society is another
question.


As confrontations between
militant radicals and police
increase, arrests due to illegal
possession and use of firearms
have emerged as a major tactic in
police efforts to quell
revolutionary offensives.
In response, a Mid-Peninsula
Free University course entitled
"Gun Laws for Revolutionaries"
has been organized to discuss
problems of radicals with guns
and to propose some legal
precautions Black Panthers and
similar groups might follow to
escape the brunt of police action
concerning possession of firearms.
The Palo Alto Legal Defense

as a primer for California and
national gun laws. In the past,
Legal Defense has provided bail

the pamphlet reads, "tighter gun
control laws have already and will
increasingly be passed."
Legal Defense examined
present gun laws and then
presented two courses of action
which Panthers and other similar
groups might examine as a means
of circumventing state and federal gun
control laws.
First, there is the possibility of
a Panther defending his possession
of a gun where it otherwise
would be illegal and grounds for
arrest by claiming "present
immediate danger" to either him
or his property.

Citing a federal statute which
provides that "it is lawful to carry
a loaded firearm, if otherwise
unlawful, where one reasonably
believes that the person or
property of himself or another is
in immediate danger and the
preservation of such person or
property requires carrying a
firearm," the Legal Defense
representative laid the legal
foundation for a claim of
self-defense that could be made
by a Panther.
Police As A Threat
The question of whether
Panthers are in immediate danger
from the police is the crux of the
Legal Defense proposal. The
legality of carrying a loaded
firearm is severely restricted by
both federal and state gun laws,
but this one clause does override
other statutes regardless of their
requirements.

"This has interesting but
ambiguous possibilities because it
has never been tested," the Free U
instructor said, "but it's a
question of political judgement
essentially, and we're only
speculating about its
possibilities."
Even a political verification of
such a self-defense argument
would be difficult to prove in the
case of the Panthers and police.
Perhaps the police do present an
immediate danger, but such an
argument could be conversely
made about the danger the
Panthers present to police,
thereby weakening considerable
the legal loophole.
A second approach open to
radicals was presented by a Free U
instructor who is a lifelong
member of the National Rifle
Association. A seemingly unlikely
coalition between the NRA and

radicals was proposed as another
legal means of assuring
revolutionaries the right of
bearing arms.
Strong lobbying by the NRA
has created special gun control
laws for NRA members who are in
the process of going to or
returning from a hunting or a
fishing trip. Theoretically, radicals
who payed the $12.5 0 annual
dues to the NRA would qualify
for the special treatment.
NRA Protection
If police stopped a carload of
Black Panthers and tried to arrest
those members with guns,
presentation of a NRA
Membership card and the address
of the local target range would
foil any attempts by police to
confiscate the weapons. "It might
be interesting," the Legal Defense
representative quipped, "if the
Panthers started carrying around
fishing nets" as proof of
participation in a fishing trip.
A more probable adaptation of
the NRA-radical coalition
concerns teaching and

demonstrating firearm usage.
Under the Civil Rights Act of
1968, "teaching or demonstrating
the use, application, or making of
any firearm, ... for use in Civil
disorder" is a felonious offense.
NRA instruction is generally
accepted as legitimate instruction
however, and could serve as a
cover for Panther training, the
Legal Defense representative
concluded.
In the pamphlet distributed at
the class meeting, a protective
suggestion is made to would-be
instructors of firearms classes.
"In classes on the use of firearms,
instructors should state before all
that it is his wish that none of the
info or training there imparted
will "in any way or degree
obstruct, delay or adversely affect
interstate commerce, or the
conduct or performance of any
federally protected function or
further civil disorder."
Gun Usage Course
Such a statement, said the
Legal Defense man, would have a
deterring effect on federal

investigators either in the class or
later on in the courtroom. "The
hope would be," he noted, "that
in terms of political judgement,
membership in an NRA group
would be considered legitimate by
the courts and the government."
A course in gun usage is in fact
being taught at the present time in
connection with the Free U. It's
leader, the same NRA member
mentioned above described the
cause as one, "primarily for
long-hairs afraid of no-knock
rules."
Fear of no-knock rules isn't the
only reason the Free U. gun

course is being taught. Nor does 1
explain motives, involved in a
course dealing with gun laws.
"There could only be one reason
for taking the Gun Law course," a
Stanford radical at the meeting
said, "If you're involved with guns
you've got to know what's going
to be happening around you when
you use them."
"Having a gun is a kind of
mind easer," smiled the NRA
radical, "it's nice to have the
peace of mind a firearm gives."
Whether that peace of mind is
universal among society is another
question.


As confrontations between
militant radicals and police
increase, arrests due to illegal
possession and use of firearms
have emerged as a major tactic in
police efforts to quell
revolutionary offensives.
In response, a Mid-Peninsula
Free University course entitled
"Gun Laws for Revolutionaries"
has been organized to discuss
problems of radicals with guns
and to propose some legal
precautions Black Panthers and
similar groups might follow to
escape the brunt of police action
concerning possession of firearms.
The Palo Alto Legal Defense
Committee conceived the course
as a primer for California and
national gun laws. In the past,
Legal Defense has provided bail
and legal counseling for people
arrested at Stanford during the
past two years.
Presentation of the "Gun
Laws" course represents a
departure from defensive tactics
into the realm of preventative
information for persons arrested
for political crimes. The Legal
Defense representative teaching
the "gun Laws" course, a
Stanford Law School graduate,
describes the course as one
"designed to keep people out of
jail and to explain to people how
to avoid getting into situations
where they can get busted."
Panthers Are Catalysts
In a pamphlet distributed at
Tuesday night session of the class,
the Black Panthers, and Huey
Newton more specifically, are
cited as the catalyst for present
gun laws. "As the spectre of Huey
P. Newton rises over the terrified
legislatures across the country,"
the pamphlet reads, "tighter gun
control laws have already and will
increasingly be passed."

present gun laws and then
presented two courses of action
