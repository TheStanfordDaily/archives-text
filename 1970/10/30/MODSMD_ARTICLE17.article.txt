# Gubser-McLean Race
## Unemployment Is Major Issue 
### 
Santa Clara County, economic
victim of the Vietnam War, will
decide Nov. 3 the fate of an
18-year incumbant congressman
challenged by an advocate of
"new politics."
Charles Gubser, a Republican,
was elected to the State
Legislature in 195 0 and to the
House of Representatives in 1 95 3.
He now faces a stiff Democratic
challenge by former Stanford
campus pastor Stuart McLean.
The 10th Congressional District,
with unemployment at seven and
one-half percent and with over
10,000 unemployed engineers has
been hard hit by President
Nixon's conversion to a
"peace-time economy". Urban
sprawl, heavy pollution and
massive concrete mazeways, now
combined with high
unemployment, have tarnished
both the land and the politics of
the once-pastoral Santa Clara
Valley.
The challenger McLean began
his political career at age 20 when
he attempted to lobby against the
draft in Washington. After
receiving his bachelor's degree
from Oberlin College in political
science, he attended Yale, and
eventually received a Ph.D. in
Ethics and. Politics from the
University of Chicago.
Support for Chavez
Joining Stanford's campus
ministry in 1 964, McLean quickly
became involved in political
action, supporting Cesar Chavez
and the United Farm Workers as
well as opposing the Vietnam War
in 1 967. McLean later sponsored
an East Palo Alto racial affairs
seminar which produced the well
received book Institutional
Racism. McLean now directs the
Study of Contemporary Values at
the Jesuit University of Santa
Clara.

On December 17, McLean, a
Democrat, held open hearings on
what is undoubtedly the biggest
issue of the campaign â€”
unemployment. The hearings
indicated that Santa Clara
County's heavy reliance on
aerospace and defense-related
electronics had, after a period of
prosperity, led the county to
economic disaster.
Thousands of willing white and
blue-collar workers who lost their
jobs as Lockheed, Fairchild, and

other big defense contractors
began to feel the pinch of defense
cutbacks. McLean lays the blame
for this condition squarely on the
shoulders of Rep. Gubser.
Gubser's lack of foresight,
contends McLean, has resulted in
overreliance on defense and
aerospace industries at a time
when the county should have
been preparing for the conversion
to a peacetime economy.
Many of McLean's proposals
deal with this economic crisis in
the 1 0 th District. He has called
for an end to the Nixon
administration's tight money and
high unemployment policies by
calling for a lowering of credit
rates as well as restoration of the
seven percent investment tax
credit. McLean has also called for

a mortage moratorium for
unemployed workers who face
loss of their homes before new
jobs can be found.
New Industry Needed
Calling for a redirection of the
10 th District's employment
priorities McLean has stated, "If
Santa Clara County is ever to
experience full employment again,
new forms of industry must be
developed. The skills, technology,
and management of this county
must be channeled into solving

undecided vote, may give
McLean victory.

the problems of pollution, mass
transportation, low cost housing,
and other pressing problems in
our society."
Such a program will require
massive government aid, both in
research and development of these
new technological industries, and
in providing financial aid to local
governments so that they may
purchase mass transport systems,
pollution control devices, and the
other expensive fruits of the new
technology.
On the deteriorating
environment McLean has called
for a hault to the construction of
the Southern Bay Crossing, the
Peripheral Canal, and the new San
Jose Jetport. The candidate has
pledged himself to a program of
stiffer fines for polluters as well as
an end to the collusion between
regulatory agencies which enforce
pollution control laws and the
business interests which often
control those agencies. Citing his
opponents poor voting record on
the environment, McLean
contends that Gub9er has the
"worst voting record of all Bay
Area congressmen on the
environment."
Rapid Withdrawal
McLean, continuing his long
standing opposition to the
Vietnam War has called for a more
rapid withdrawal of American
troops from Vietnam as well as
the formation of a coalition
government and provisions for
internationally supervised

elections. Speaking of Gubser
McLean has said, "I will be
replacing a 100 percent hawk
whose singleminded pursuit of
war contracts has only helped
perpetuate the Asian war, but
sacrificed our local economy to
it."
Citing his opponents voting
record, the McLean forces have
attempted to emphasize Gubser's
hawk-like stance. Claiming that
Gubser voted in 1968 to approve
the use of tactical nuclear
weapons in Vietnam and citing his
support of the President's politics,
as well as his support of the ABM,
McLean hopes to capitalize on
prevailing war-weary sentiment in
the district.
Gubser admits that
unemployment in the county as
well as the national economic
crisis is the major issue of the
campaign. Though some would
maintain that a single
congressman can not bare the
blame of a recession, Gubser
forces have admitted that this
single issue has eroded Gubser's
traditionally strong position.
Gubser has, by the judicious
use of pork barrel legislation,
brought to the district in years
past enormous government
research and defense contracts.
Much of the past prosperity of the
10 th District can be attributed to
Gubser's use of his Washington
influence in obtaining a seemingly
endless flow of such contracts.
Hawk to Dove
Gubser's position on the war
has swung from hawk io moderate
dove in the space of two years. A
long-time supporter of both
President Johnson's and Nixon's
position on the Indo-China
conflict, Gubser now calls for a
withdrawal of American troops "a
little bit faster than the
President's withdrawal schedule."
In recent months, Gubser has
attempted to disassociate himself
from his former war stand by
voting for the doomed House
version of the Cooper-Church
amendment to limit U.S.
involvement in Cambodia, voting
against the President's requested
extension of the ABM system.
Concerning the environment,
Gubser forces can point to a bill
submitted to the congress by
Gubser on the creation of an
Ecology Institute, which is to be
funded by an increase in the
automobile excise tax. The
institute would research
alternatives to the internal
combustion machine as well as
promote pollution control. The
bill, only recently submitted, has
not been acted upon by Congress.
Gubser has called for a
reinstatement of the tax-exempt
status of the Sierra Club, though
the environmental protection
group is still considered too
political by the Internal Revenue
Service to merit exemption status.
Gubser forces are relying upon
the Republican party
organization, which has never
been known to be aggressive in
turning out voters. Against this
weak effort the McLean
Democrats have assembled a
computer-assisted campaign,
which, in the words of one
Congressman,will "revolutionize"
politics. A detailed analysis of the
voting patterns and preferences of
each precinct, combined with a
large volunteer force on Nov. 3
could deal Gubser a heavy blow.
All of the McLean efforts may
be in vain however, for the vital
volunteer force has not
materialized. Bill Jordan, who
heads the Stanford McLean effort
recently told the Daily, "There is
no question we could win this
election if Stanford students get
out and work, but frankly I'm
disappointed with student
response. It's a disgrace."
