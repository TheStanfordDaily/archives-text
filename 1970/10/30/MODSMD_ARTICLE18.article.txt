# Nixon Fire

### 
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP)
A pajama-clad President Nixon
evacuated his oceanside villa here
Thursday night when a small fire
sent smoke billowing through the
residence.
Press Secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said early today that
damage was "very minor" but
that "there was extensive smoke
throughout the President's
residence."
Nixon spent the night in a
guest house on the property while
firemen used large fans to clear
the smoke from his home.
Ziegler said the blaze was
caused by heat conducted
downward from a fireplace in
Nixon's second floor study to
wood within the thick but hollow
wall of the dining room below.
The President's valet, Manolo
Sanchez, had built a fire in the
fireplace where Nixon worked for
a time before retiring. The
President had arrived at his home
shortly before 10 p.m. and the
fire was discovered at 11 :25 p.m.
by Fina Sanchez, the Nixon's
cook and wife of Manolo.
