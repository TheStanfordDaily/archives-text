# Witty, Sincere
## Gurley—Socialist Prof 
### WALLY THURSTON BILL FREIVOGEL 
The day before Big Game
several years ago, John Gurley
ambled out on stage in an
Economics I class: slowly,
meditatively. As the students
filled in, he charted several graphs
on the blackboard. When all the
boards were strangled with lines,
letters and jottings he quickly
began to mumble through a
complex explanation of
elementary economics; adding
new lines as he fumbled through
several abstract contradictions.
The amazed students scribbled
everything down as fast as they
could while understanding
nothing. "Now, are there are
questions?" he asked, suddenly
turning. Four hundred hands
blossomed. He stood silently,
scanning the audience with his
sincere eyes, not moving an inch.
Within a second the auditorium
blew up in a mixture of clapping,
hissing, whistling and screams.
The graph on the wall clearly
spelled: BEAT CAL. The class was
cancelled "in honor of the game."
John Gurley is an entertaining
man but not ostentatiously
entertaining. He can be funny, but
at the same time serious.
"He has a dry wit often putting
you on in a very deadpan way,"
one colleague explains.
Politics and Mao
But it is not Gurley's wit alone
that distinguishes him. His politics
are probably his most
controversial trait.
Gurley is a socialist who
respects Mao and the Chinese
government's accomplishments on
the mainland. But, as one student
says, the economics professor
"does not look like the typical
American Maoist."
In the words of a teaching
assistant who once worked for
him, Gurley is "humble, shy and
extremely well thought
out . . . Too well thought out to
be a Mao fan."
The truth is that John Gurley
is the same warm, concerned man
he was years ago in the
Depression, when he walked past
long soup lines in Sacramento on
his way to high school.
Father
His father was the City
Circulation Editor for several Bay
Area newspapers and that
encouraged the teen-aged Gurley
to follow the events of the
Depression.
Though not a particularly good
high school student, the tall, thin
native Californian attended junior
college, became an excellent
tennis player, and then got into
Stanford.
From his temporary office in
the new Hoover Library reading
room, he looks back on his early
Stanford days with light humor.
"I got into Stanford not because
of my grades, but because of my
tennis playing. But, that's one
way of doing it,"he chuckles.
It was the poverty of the
Depression years, however, and
not tennis that motivated him to
come here to school.
Years later in 1 965 after three
vears teaching at Princeton and

four years commuting between
the University of Maryland and
Brookings Institute, Gurley went
to Korea as an economic adviser
to the Agency for International
Development (AID). The extreme
poverty of the war-torn people
there evoked the same emotions
that Depression Sacramento had.
Gurley saw the harm another
war was doing to the
battle-scarred people in Southeast
Asia. At the same time he
observed the American military
buildup in Vietnam. Both of these
events started him thinking about
the political implications of the
U.S. economy. He felt that the
American behavior had been
unethical.
The day after he sent off his
report on the Korean situation,
Gurley drove down to his office
from his home here on Pine Hill,
picked up the phone and
cancelled his contract with AID.
Shortly thereafter, he resigned
from his position as an advisor to
the Secretary of the Treasury.
Arrested
Later, during the national
"resist the draft" week, he was
arrested at the Oakland Induction
Center for sitting in a doorway
and refusing to move. He is not
proud of serving a jail sentence,
but he admits that the 1 0 days he
spent in Santa Rita with 9 0 other
protesters were very fruitful. "The
guard left us alone," he recalls,
"We held seminars and had a good
time; played volley ball."
Paul Rupert of the Palo Alto
Peace Center says that the only
"criticism" he has of Gurley is
that "You are not always sure
where he is coming down
politically."
Rupert is right. It came as a
surprise for those who did not
know him well, when last summer
he decided to go to Indonesia as
an economic adviser for the Ford
Foundation funded Development
Advisory Service at Harvard

University. The DAS building was
bombed two weeks ago.
More Radical
"It's a more radical thing to
do" is the phrase he used to
explain his decision. He feels that
in order to change any system one
must keep up to date with it. He
also explains that a teacher must
study the developments of his
subject. Surprisingly, he doesn't
hesitate to add "That's just part
of the justification for doing what
I wanted to do anyway. It's fun to
get involved in real economic
problems."
The teacher Gurley is almost as
intriguing as the political Gurley.
In fact, most undergraduates first
hear of him when they are told
that he is the best Econ I
professor.
Speaking with an intonation
that literally underlines the
students' notes right in their note
books he moves his hands in front
of him to illustrate his ideas.
Thin Face
His thin, almost weary face; his
incisive nose and piercing eyes
look out on his pupils. When an
idea is especially important he
stands like a pointer, one foot
behind the other, one arm is
extended in front of him while
the other hangs close to his baggy
pants.
Students often say that what
impresses them most about his
style is that they feel as though
they are being treated as equals.
Gurley often gets upset when he
can't see the student's face in the
auditorium.
And, his style is very informal.
He has been known to answer
barking dogs while lecturing and
to run to the window when a fire
truck passes.
'Refreshing'
One T.A. called his classes
"refreshing"; not because of his
humor but because of his
approach to economics. He
teaches political economics rather
than technical economics.
Asian economic development
has not always been the focus of
Gurley's characteristically
methodical research. After leaving
Brookings years ag»> he returned
here where he became prominent
through the book "Money in a
Theory of Finance" which he
wrote in collaboration with
Professor Shaw. He also began
editing the American Economic
Review with the assistance of his
wife Yvet te.
One former student, now
critical of Gurley's analysis of
China says:"He knew his banking
and currency very well, but when
he gets into Asian studies he is
moved out side of his field."
Looking to the future, Gurley
sees the capitalist system coming
under arduous attack both on the
national and the international
level. He speculates that the
people of the U.S. will have the
power and desire to vote in a
socialist system within a decade or
two.
He is not sure that there will be
peaceful change, given the deep
roots of capitalism in this
country. But, he believes that
change will come and he is for it.

vears teaching at Princeton and

four years commuting between
the University of Maryland and
Brookings Institute, Gurley went
to Korea as an economic adviser
to the Agency for International
Development (AID). The extreme
poverty of the war-torn people
there evoked the same emotions
that Depression Sacramento had.
Gurley saw the harm another
war was doing to the
battle-scarred people in Southeast
Asia. At the same time he
observed the American military
buildup in Vietnam. Both of these
events started him thinking about
the political implications of the
U.S. economy. He felt that the
American behavior had been
unethical.
The day after he sent off his
report on the Korean situation,
Gurley drove down to his office
from his home here on Pine Hill,
picked up the phone and
cancelled his contract with AID.
Shortly thereafter, he resigned
from his position as an advisor to
the Secretary of the Treasury.
Arrested
Later, during the national
"resist the draft" week, he was
arrested at the Oakland Induction
Center for sitting in a doorway
and refusing to move. He is not
proud of serving a jail sentence,
but he admits that the 1 0 days he
spent in Santa Rita with 9 0 other
protesters were very fruitful. "The
guard left us alone," he recalls,
"We held seminars and had a good
time; played volley ball."
Paul Rupert of the Palo Alto
Peace Center says that the only
"criticism" he has of Gurley is
that "You are not always sure
where he is coming down
politically."
Rupert is right. It came as a
surprise for those who did not
know him well, when last summer
he decided to go to Indonesia as
an economic adviser for the Ford
Foundation funded Development
Advisory Service at Harvard

University. The DAS building was
bombed two weeks ago.
More Radical
"It's a more radical thing to
do" is the phrase he used to
explain his decision. He feels that
in order to change any system one
must keep up to date with it. He
also explains that a teacher must
study the developments of his
subject. Surprisingly, he doesn't
hesitate to add "That's just part
of the justification for doing what
I wanted to do anyway. It's fun to
get involved in real economic
problems."
The teacher Gurley is almost as
intriguing as the political Gurley.
In fact, most undergraduates first
hear of him when they are told
that he is the best Econ I
professor.
Speaking with an intonation
that literally underlines the
students' notes right in their note
books he moves his hands in front
of him to illustrate his ideas.
Thin Face
His thin, almost weary face; his
incisive nose and piercing eyes
look out on his pupils. When an
idea is especially important he
stands like a pointer, one foot
behind the other, one arm is
extended in front of him while
the other hangs close to his baggy
pants.
Students often say that what
impresses them most about his
style is that they feel as though
they are being treated as equals.
Gurley often gets upset when he
can't see the student's face in the
auditorium.
And, his style is very informal.
He has been known to answer
barking dogs while lecturing and
to run to the window when a fire
truck passes.
'Refreshing'
One T.A. called his classes
"refreshing"; not because of his
humor but because of his
approach to economics. He
teaches political economics rather
than technical economics.
Asian economic development
has not always been the focus of
Gurley's characteristically
methodical research. After leaving
Brookings years ag»> he returned
here where he became prominent
through the book "Money in a
Theory of Finance" which he
wrote in collaboration with
Professor Shaw. He also began
editing the American Economic
Review with the assistance of his
wife Yvet te.
One former student, now
critical of Gurley's analysis of
China says:"He knew his banking
and currency very well, but when
he gets into Asian studies he is
moved out side of his field."
Looking to the future, Gurley
sees the capitalist system coming
under arduous attack both on the
national and the international
level. He speculates that the
people of the U.S. will have the
power and desire to vote in a
socialist system within a decade or
two.
He is not sure that there will be
peaceful change, given the deep
roots of capitalism in this
country. But, he believes that
change will come and he is for it.


PROF. JOHN GURLEY
The day before Big Game
several years ago, John Gurley
ambled out on stage in an
Economics I class: slowly,
meditatively. As the students
filled in, he charted several graphs
on the blackboard. When all the
boards were strangled with lines,
letters and jottings he quickly
began to mumble through a
complex explanation of
elementary economics; adding
new lines as he fumbled through
several abstract contradictions.
The amazed students scribbled
everything down as fast as they
could while understanding
nothing. "Now, are there are
questions?" he asked, suddenly
turning. Four hundred hands
blossomed. He stood silently,
scanning the audience with his
sincere eyes, not moving an inch.
Within a second the auditorium
blew up in a mixture of clapping,
hissing, whistling and screams.
The graph on the wall clearly
spelled: BEAT CAL. The class was
cancelled "in honor of the game."
John Gurley is an entertaining
man but not ostentatiously
entertaining. He can be funny, but
at the same time serious.
"He has a dry wit often putting
you on in a very deadpan way,"
one colleague explains.
Politics and Mao
But it is not Gurley's wit alone
that distinguishes him. His politics
are probably his most
controversial trait.
Gurley is a socialist who
respects Mao and the Chinese
government's accomplishments on
the mainland. But, as one student
says, the economics professor
"does not look like the typical
American Maoist."
In the words of a teaching
assistant who once worked for
him, Gurley is "humble, shy and
extremely well thought
out . . . Too well thought out to
be a Mao fan."
The truth is that John Gurley
is the same warm, concerned man
he was years ago in the
Depression, when he walked past
long soup lines in Sacramento on
his way to high school.
Father
His father was the City
Circulation Editor for several Bay
Area newspapers and that
encouraged the teen-aged Gurley
to follow the events of the
Depression.
Though not a particularly good
high school student, the tall, thin
native Californian attended junior
college, became an excellent
tennis player, and then got into
Stanford.
From his temporary office in
the new Hoover Library reading
room, he looks back on his early
Stanford days with light humor.
"I got into Stanford not because
of my grades, but because of my
tennis playing. But, that's one
way of doing it,"he chuckles.
It was the poverty of the
Depression years, however, and
not tennis that motivated him to
come here to school.

look out on his pupils. When an
idea is especially important he
stands like a pointer, one foot
behind the other, one arm is
extended in front of him while
the other hangs close to his baggy
pants.
Students often say that what
impresses them most about his
style is that they feel as though
they are being treated as equals.
Gurley often gets upset when he
can't see the student's face in the
auditorium.
And, his style is very informal.
He has been known to answer
barking dogs while lecturing and
to run to the window when a fire
truck passes.
'Refreshing'
One T.A. called his classes
"refreshing"; not because of his
humor but because of his
approach to economics. He
teaches political economics rather
than technical economics.
Asian economic development
has not always been the focus of
Gurley's characteristically
methodical research. After leaving
Brookings years ag»> he returned
here where he became prominent
through the book "Money in a
Theory of Finance" which he
wrote in collaboration with
Professor Shaw. He also began
editing the American Economic
Review with the assistance of his
wife Yvet te.
One former student, now
critical of Gurley's analysis of
China says:"He knew his banking
and currency very well, but when
he gets into Asian studies he is
moved out side of his field."
Looking to the future, Gurley
sees the capitalist system coming
under arduous attack both on the
national and the international
level. He speculates that the
people of the U.S. will have the
power and desire to vote in a
socialist system within a decade or
two.
He is not sure that there will be
peaceful change, given the deep
roots of capitalism in this
country. But, he believes that
change will come and he is for it.


PROF. JOHN GURLEY
The day before Big Game
several years ago, John Gurley
ambled out on stage in an
Economics I class: slowly,
meditatively. As the students
filled in, he charted several graphs
on the blackboard. When all the
boards were strangled with lines,
letters and jottings he quickly
began to mumble through a
complex explanation of
elementary economics; adding
new lines as he fumbled through
several abstract contradictions.
The amazed students scribbled
everything down as fast as they
could while understanding
nothing. "Now, are there are
questions?" he asked, suddenly
turning. Four hundred hands
blossomed. He stood silently,
scanning the audience with his
sincere eyes, not moving an inch.
Within a second the auditorium
blew up in a mixture of clapping,
hissing, whistling and screams.
The graph on the wall clearly
spelled: BEAT CAL. The class was
cancelled "in honor of the game."
John Gurley is an entertaining
man but not ostentatiously
entertaining. He can be funny, but
at the same time serious.
"He has a dry wit often putting
you on in a very deadpan way,"
one colleague explains.
Politics and Mao
But it is not Gurley's wit alone
that distinguishes him. His politics
are probably his most
controversial trait.
Gurley is a socialist who
respects Mao and the Chinese
government's accomplishments on
the mainland. But, as one student
says, the economics professor
"does not look like the typical
American Maoist."
In the words of a teaching
assistant who once worked for
him, Gurley is "humble, shy and
extremely well thought
out . . . Too well thought out to
be a Mao fan."
The truth is that John Gurley
is the same warm, concerned man
he was years ago in the
Depression, when he walked past
long soup lines in Sacramento on
his way to high school.
Father
His father was the City
Circulation Editor for several Bay
Area newspapers and that
encouraged the teen-aged Gurley
to follow the events of the
Depression.
Though not a particularly good
high school student, the tall, thin
native Californian attended junior
college, became an excellent
tennis player, and then got into
Stanford.
From his temporary office in
the new Hoover Library reading
room, he looks back on his early
Stanford days with light humor.
"I got into Stanford not because
of my grades, but because of my
tennis playing. But, that's one
way of doing it,"he chuckles.
It was the poverty of the
Depression years, however, and
not tennis that motivated him to
come here to school.
Years later in 1 965 after three
vears teaching at Princeton and

four years commuting between
the University of Maryland and
Brookings Institute, Gurley went
to Korea as an economic adviser
to the Agency for International
Development (AID). The extreme
poverty of the war-torn people
there evoked the same emotions
that Depression Sacramento had.
Gurley saw the harm another
war was doing to the
battle-scarred people in Southeast
Asia. At the same time he
observed the American military
buildup in Vietnam. Both of these
events started him thinking about
the political implications of the
U.S. economy. He felt that the
American behavior had been
unethical.
The day after he sent off his
report on the Korean situation,
Gurley drove down to his office
from his home here on Pine Hill,
picked up the phone and
cancelled his contract with AID.
Shortly thereafter, he resigned
from his position as an advisor to
the Secretary of the Treasury.
Arrested
Later, during the national
"resist the draft" week, he was
arrested at the Oakland Induction
Center for sitting in a doorway
and refusing to move. He is not
proud of serving a jail sentence,
but he admits that the 1 0 days he
spent in Santa Rita with 9 0 other
protesters were very fruitful. "The
guard left us alone," he recalls,
"We held seminars and had a good
time; played volley ball."
Paul Rupert of the Palo Alto
Peace Center says that the only
"criticism" he has of Gurley is
that "You are not always sure
where he is coming down
politically."
Rupert is right. It came as a
surprise for those who did not
know him well, when last summer
he decided to go to Indonesia as
an economic adviser for the Ford
Foundation funded Development
Advisory Service at Harvard

University. The DAS building was
bombed two weeks ago.
More Radical
"It's a more radical thing to
do" is the phrase he used to
explain his decision. He feels that
in order to change any system one
must keep up to date with it. He
also explains that a teacher must
study the developments of his
subject. Surprisingly, he doesn't
hesitate to add "That's just part
of the justification for doing what
I wanted to do anyway. It's fun to
get involved in real economic
problems."
The teacher Gurley is almost as
intriguing as the political Gurley.
In fact, most undergraduates first
hear of him when they are told
that he is the best Econ I
professor.
Speaking with an intonation
that literally underlines the
students' notes right in their note
books he moves his hands in front
of him to illustrate his ideas.
Thin Face
His thin, almost weary face; his
incisive nose and piercing eyes
look out on his pupils. When an
idea is especially important he
stands like a pointer, one foot
behind the other, one arm is
extended in front of him while

cancelled "in honor of the game."
John Gurley is an entertaining
man but not ostentatiously
entertaining. He can be funny, but
at the same time serious.
"He has a dry wit often putting
you on in a very deadpan way,"
one colleague explains.
Politics and Mao
But it is not Gurley's wit alone
that distinguishes him. His politics
are probably his most
controversial trait.
Gurley is a socialist who
respects Mao and the Chinese
government's accomplishments on
the mainland. But, as one student
says, the economics professor
"does not look like the typical
American Maoist."
In the words of a teaching
assistant who once worked for
him, Gurley is "humble, shy and
extremely well thought
out . . . Too well thought out to
be a Mao fan."
The truth is that John Gurley
is the same warm, concerned man
he was years ago in the
Depression, when he walked past
long soup lines in Sacramento on
his way to high school.
Father
His father was the City
Circulation Editor for several Bay
Area newspapers and that
encouraged the teen-aged Gurley
to follow the events of the
Depression.
Though not a particularly good
high school student, the tall, thin
native Californian attended junior
college, became an excellent
tennis player, and then got into
Stanford.
From his temporary office in
the new Hoover Library reading
room, he looks back on his early
Stanford days with light humor.
"I got into Stanford not because
of my grades, but because of my
tennis playing. But, that's one
way of doing it,"he chuckles.
It was the poverty of the
Depression years, however, and
not tennis that motivated him to
come here to school.
Years later in 1 965 after three
vears teaching at Princeton and

four years commuting between
the University of Maryland and
Brookings Institute, Gurley went
to Korea as an economic adviser
to the Agency for International
Development (AID). The extreme
poverty of the war-torn people
there evoked the same emotions
that Depression Sacramento had.
Gurley saw the harm another
war was doing to the
battle-scarred people in Southeast
Asia. At the same time he
observed the American military
buildup in Vietnam. Both of these
events started him thinking about
the political implications of the
U.S. economy. He felt that the
American behavior had been
unethical.
The day after he sent off his
report on the Korean situation,
Gurley drove down to his office
from his home here on Pine Hill,
picked up the phone and
cancelled his contract with AID.
Shortly thereafter, he resigned
from his position as an advisor to
the Secretary of the Treasury.
Arrested
Later, during the national
"resist the draft" week, he was
arrested at the Oakland Induction
Center for sitting in a doorway
and refusing to move. He is not
proud of serving a jail sentence,
but he admits that the 1 0 days he
spent in Santa Rita with 9 0 other
protesters were very fruitful. "The
guard left us alone," he recalls,
"We held seminars and had a good
time; played volley ball."
Paul Rupert of the Palo Alto
Peace Center says that the only
"criticism" he has of Gurley is
that "You are not always sure
where he is coming down
politically."
Rupert is right. It came as a
surprise for those who did not
know him well, when last summer
he decided to go to Indonesia as
an economic adviser for the Ford
Foundation funded Development
Advisory Service at Harvard

University. The DAS building was
bombed two weeks ago.
More Radical
"It's a more radical thing to
do" is the phrase he used to
explain his decision. He feels that
in order to change any system one
must keep up to date with it. He
also explains that a teacher must
study the developments of his
subject. Surprisingly, he doesn't
hesitate to add "That's just part
of the justification for doing what
I wanted to do anyway. It's fun to
get involved in real economic
problems."
The teacher Gurley is almost as
intriguing as the political Gurley.
In fact, most undergraduates first
hear of him when they are told
that he is the best Econ I
professor.
Speaking with an intonation
that literally underlines the
students' notes right in their note
books he moves his hands in front
of him to illustrate his ideas.
Thin Face
His thin, almost weary face; his
incisive nose and piercing eyes
look out on his pupils. When an
idea is especially important he
stands like a pointer, one foot
behind the other, one arm is
extended in front of him while
the other hangs close to his baggy
pants.
Students often say that what
impresses them most about his
style is that they feel as though
they are being treated as equals.
Gurley often gets upset when he
can't see the student's face in the
auditorium.
And, his style is very informal.
He has been known to answer
barking dogs while lecturing and
to run to the window when a fire
truck passes.
'Refreshing'
One T.A. called his classes
"refreshing"; not because of his
humor but because of his
approach to economics. He
teaches political economics rather
than technical economics.
Asian economic development
has not always been the focus of
Gurley's characteristically
methodical research. After leaving
Brookings years ag»> he returned
here where he became prominent
through the book "Money in a
Theory of Finance" which he
wrote in collaboration with
Professor Shaw. He also began
editing the American Economic
Review with the assistance of his
wife Yvet te.
One former student, now
critical of Gurley's analysis of
China says:"He knew his banking
and currency very well, but when
he gets into Asian studies he is
moved out side of his field."
Looking to the future, Gurley
sees the capitalist system coming
under arduous attack both on the
national and the international
level. He speculates that the
people of the U.S. will have the
power and desire to vote in a
socialist system within a decade or
two.
He is not sure that there will be
peaceful change, given the deep
roots of capitalism in this
country. But, he believes that
change will come and he is for it.


PROF. JOHN GURLEY
The day before Big Game
several years ago, John Gurley
ambled out on stage in an
Economics I class: slowly,
meditatively. As the students
filled in, he charted several graphs
on the blackboard. When all the
boards were strangled with lines,
letters and jottings he quickly
began to mumble through a
complex explanation of
elementary economics; adding
new lines as he fumbled through
several abstract contradictions.
The amazed students scribbled
everything down as fast as they
could while understanding
nothing. "Now, are there are
questions?" he asked, suddenly
turning. Four hundred hands
blossomed. He stood silently,
scanning the audience with his
sincere eyes, not moving an inch.
Within a second the auditorium
blew up in a mixture of clapping,
hissing, whistling and screams.
The graph on the wall clearly
spelled: BEAT CAL. The class was
cancelled "in honor of the game."
