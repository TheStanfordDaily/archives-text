# Nixon's San Jose Address Calls For GOP Victories
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
SAN JOSE — President Nixon
brought his smooth, stern style here
last night to boost the faltering
campaign of Sen. George Murphy and
to drum up support for his own
programs before an enthusiastic crowd
of 5000.
The President defended his record
throughout the 20 minute speech and
called on voters to back his efforts to
end the war, curb unemployment, and
fight crime by electing Republican
candidates who "stand with the
President and not against him."
Nixon spoke to an overflow
audience of Republican supporters that
contained few hecklers. Outside the
San Jose Civic Auditorium an estimated
20 0 0 protesters picketed his
appearance.
The President completed a busy
four-state election tour by reiterating
his campaign theme of the last few
weeks by asking the audience for
support. "When I was elected two years
ago, I made some pledges . . . and I
have a responsibility to the people."
Vietnam Plans
He told the cheering crowd, "The
Vietnam War is being brought to an
end." He cited his troop reductions,
Vietnamization program, and peace
proposals as steps toward "ending a war
so that it will discourage others from
starting one."
The President declared, "The United
States has never in this century used its
powers to destroy freedom." He was
introduced by Sen. Murphy as "the
leader and the hope of the Free
World."
Nixon then turned to the sensitive
problem of unemployment in the huge
defense industries around San Jose
and other parts of California. He
suggested that the great potential in
these areas be turned elsewhere.

"The possibilities are endless," said
the President. He added, "California's
trained, skilled manpower are jobs that
can go from defense to peace." In a
statement released earlier in the day, he
said that his administration is
converting its defense spending "into
peacetime pursuits such as our efforts
to enhance the environment."
In the release, Nixon added, "Our
strategy for curbing inflation and
promoting stable growth is working."
Tunney Charges
In his speech he branded as "false"
charges made by Sen. Murphy's
challenger, Rep. John Tunney that the
Ames Laboratories in Sunnyvale would
be closed after the November elections
and its 3000 workers laid off.
Recent polls have shown Sen.
Murphy trailing Rep. Tunney by a
small margin, but Sen. Murphy is
hoping that Nixon's appearance and
Gov. Reagan's expected landslide
victory will help him overtake Tunney.

Nixon next attacked the sluggishness
of Congress in passing only one major
crime bill since he had taken office. He
said that "George Murphy will be an
all-year-around crime fighter."
Radical Few
Nixon lashed out at protesters while
assuring his audience that "those
radical few are not the true majority of
young Americans and they aren't going
to be the leaders of the future."
He added, "190 years of history tells
me that this country has a method for
peaceful change. And in a country that
provides a method for peaceful change,
there is no cause that justifies violence
or lawlessness."
He urged the crowd "to vote on
November 3. That's when the power is
to the people."
Earlier in his speech, Nixon joked
with the crowd about the problems he
has supporting football teams. "All I
can say when I'm in California is
Stanford is number one."

the President. He added, "California's
trained, skilled manpower are jobs that
can go from defense to peace." In a
statement released earlier in the day, he
said that his administration is
converting its defense spending "into
peacetime pursuits such as our efforts
to enhance the environment."
In the release, Nixon added, "Our
strategy for curbing inflation and
promoting stable growth is working."
Tunney Charges
In his speech he branded as "false"
charges made by Sen. Murphy's
challenger, Rep. John Tunney that the
Ames Laboratories in Sunnyvale would
be closed after the November elections
and its 3000 workers laid off.
Recent polls have shown Sen.
Murphy trailing Rep. Tunney by a
small margin, but Sen. Murphy is
hoping that Nixon's appearance and
Gov. Reagan's expected landslide
victory will help him overtake Tunney.

Nixon next attacked the sluggishness
of Congress in passing only one major
crime bill since he had taken office. He
said that "George Murphy will be an
all-year-around crime fighter."
Radical Few
Nixon lashed out at protesters while
assuring his audience that "those
radical few are not the true majority of
young Americans and they aren't going
to be the leaders of the future."
He added, "190 years of history tells
me that this country has a method for
peaceful change. And in a country that
provides a method for peaceful change,
there is no cause that justifies violence
or lawlessness."
He urged the crowd "to vote on
November 3. That's when the power is
to the people."
Earlier in his speech, Nixon joked
with the crowd about the problems he
has supporting football teams. "All I
can say when I'm in California is
Stanford is number one."
SAN JOSE — President Nixon
brought his smooth, stern style here
last night to boost the faltering
campaign of Sen. George Murphy and
to drum up support for his own
programs before an enthusiastic crowd
of 5000.
The President defended his record
throughout the 20 minute speech and
called on voters to back his efforts to
end the war, curb unemployment, and
fight crime by electing Republican
candidates who "stand with the
President and not against him."
Nixon spoke to an overflow
audience of Republican supporters that
contained few hecklers. Outside the
San Jose Civic Auditorium an estimated
20 0 0 protesters picketed his
appearance.
The President completed a busy
four-state election tour by reiterating
his campaign theme of the last few
weeks by asking the audience for
support. "When I was elected two years
ago, I made some pledges . . . and I
have a responsibility to the people."
Vietnam Plans
He told the cheering crowd, "The
Vietnam War is being brought to an
end." He cited his troop reductions,
Vietnamization program, and peace
proposals as steps toward "ending a war
so that it will discourage others from
starting one."
The President declared, "The United
States has never in this century used its
powers to destroy freedom." He was
introduced by Sen. Murphy as "the
leader and the hope of the Free
World."
Nixon then turned to the sensitive
problem of unemployment in the huge
defense industries around San Jose
and other parts of California. He
suggested that the great potential in
these areas be turned elsewhere.

"The possibilities are endless," said
the President. He added, "California's
trained, skilled manpower are jobs that
can go from defense to peace." In a
statement released earlier in the day, he
said that his administration is
converting its defense spending "into
peacetime pursuits such as our efforts
to enhance the environment."
