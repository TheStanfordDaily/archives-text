The Orson Welles mystery
movies were scheduled this
evening, but the Tresidder Series
film "TOUCH OF EVIL" has
been cancelled because the only
available print exists in mutilated
condition. Welles' "THE THIRD
MAN," the collaborative effort of
Carol Reed and Graham Greene,
will be shown at 7 :30 and 9 :30 in
Cubberley. In this outstanding
suspense thriller, Joseph Cotton
portrays the simple, shallow,
ineffectual American (remind you
of anyone?) in search of an old
friend in postwar Vienna. Orson
Welles, who also played producer,
is the evil, but witty, Harry Lime.
Alida Valli plays the girl and
'IVevor Howard represents the
military.
"PSYCH," the film that took
the fun out of showering with a
friend, will be shown this evening
at 7:30 and 9:30 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Hitchcock on
Hitchcock: "PSYCHO" is probably
one of the most cinematic films
I've made and there you get a
clear example of the use of film to
cause an audience to respond
emotionally . . . You have to
remember that "PSYCHO" is a film
made with quite a sense of
amusement on my part. To me it's
a fun picture.
"The processes through which
we take the audience, you see, it's
like taking them through the
haunted house at the fairground
or the roller coaster, you know.
After all it stands to reason that if
one were seriously doing the

"PSYCHO" story, it would be a
case history. You would never
present in in forms my mystery or
the juxtaposition of characters as
they were placed in the film. They
were all designed in a certain way
to create this audience emotion."
Halloween Night, Saturday
October 31, Special Events will
present a quadruple horror feature
in Dinkelspiel starting at 7. "THE
REVENGE OF FRANKEN
STEIN" with Peter Cushing, a
"ghastly frightmare in
supernatural technicolor with an
ingenious ending presaging more

horrendous adventures" is the
first feature at 7 p.m. "THE
FLY" with Vincent Price will
follow at 8:30. "TALES OF
TERROR," a trilogy of Edgar
Allan Poe tales starring Vincent
Price, Peter Lorre, and Basil
Rathbone will be shown at 10 and
"20 MILLION MILES TO
EARTH" with William Hopper in
the most challenging role will
begin at 11 :30.
"DAYBREAK," a 1939
French film by Marcel Came and
Jaques Prevert ("CHILDREN OF
PARADISE") will be shewn

Saturday evening at 7, 8, and 9 in
Tresidder Union.
The Sunday Flicks will present
Robert Culp and Natalie Wood
and Elliot Gould and Diane
Cannon in "808 AND CAROL
AND TED AND ALICE" at 7:30
this Sunday in Memorial
Auditorium. Let me warn you
that the film is not to be taken
seriously. It is a joke, and a funny
one at that. Gould gives his
second best performance to date
and Natalie Wood once again
proves that the Harvard
Lampoon's Worst Actress Award
is aptly named the Natalie Wood.


JUST ANOTHER PICK-UP?—Bela Lugosi cannot resist the charms of Miss Mina Seward, played by
bavishing reauty Helen Chandler in her finest and most difficult character role.

we take the audience, you see, it's
like taking them through the
haunted house at the fairground
or the roller coaster, you know.
After all it stands to reason that if
one were seriously doing the

"PSYCHO" story, it would be a
case history. You would never
present in in forms my mystery or
the juxtaposition of characters as
they were placed in the film. They
were all designed in a certain way
to create this audience emotion."
Halloween Night, Saturday
October 31, Special Events will
present a quadruple horror feature
in Dinkelspiel starting at 7. "THE
REVENGE OF FRANKEN
STEIN" with Peter Cushing, a
"ghastly frightmare in
supernatural technicolor with an
ingenious ending presaging more

horrendous adventures" is the
first feature at 7 p.m. "THE
FLY" with Vincent Price will
follow at 8:30. "TALES OF
TERROR," a trilogy of Edgar
Allan Poe tales starring Vincent
Price, Peter Lorre, and Basil
Rathbone will be shown at 10 and
"20 MILLION MILES TO
EARTH" with William Hopper in
the most challenging role will
begin at 11 :30.
"DAYBREAK," a 1939
French film by Marcel Came and
Jaques Prevert ("CHILDREN OF
PARADISE") will be shewn

Saturday evening at 7, 8, and 9 in
Tresidder Union.
The Sunday Flicks will present
Robert Culp and Natalie Wood
and Elliot Gould and Diane
Cannon in "808 AND CAROL
AND TED AND ALICE" at 7:30
this Sunday in Memorial
Auditorium. Let me warn you
that the film is not to be taken
seriously. It is a joke, and a funny
one at that. Gould gives his
second best performance to date
and Natalie Wood once again
proves that the Harvard
Lampoon's Worst Actress Award
is aptly named the Natalie Wood.


JUST ANOTHER PICK-UP?—Bela Lugosi cannot resist the charms of Miss Mina Seward, played by
bavishing reauty Helen Chandler in her finest and most difficult character role.
The Orson Welles mystery
movies were scheduled this
evening, but the Tresidder Series
film "TOUCH OF EVIL" has
been cancelled because the only
available print exists in mutilated
condition. Welles' "THE THIRD
MAN," the collaborative effort of
Carol Reed and Graham Greene,
will be shown at 7 :30 and 9 :30 in
Cubberley. In this outstanding
suspense thriller, Joseph Cotton
portrays the simple, shallow,
ineffectual American (remind you
of anyone?) in search of an old
friend in postwar Vienna. Orson
Welles, who also played producer,
is the evil, but witty, Harry Lime.
Alida Valli plays the girl and
'IVevor Howard represents the
military.
"PSYCH," the film that took
the fun out of showering with a
friend, will be shown this evening
at 7:30 and 9:30 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Hitchcock on
Hitchcock: "PSYCHO" is probably
one of the most cinematic films
I've made and there you get a
clear example of the use of film to
cause an audience to respond
emotionally . . . You have to
remember that "PSYCHO" is a film
made with quite a sense of
amusement on my part. To me it's
a fun picture.

we take the audience, you see, it's
