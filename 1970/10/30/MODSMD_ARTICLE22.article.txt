### STEVE HOGLUND 
(This article is being used with
the author's permission.)
West was able to serve a
finished meal by the time the
hand had been played out, thanks
to the preparations he had made
the night before. For each person,
he had purchased and de-boned a
full chicken breast, carefully
breaking the shoulder blade with
his hands and peeling the meat, in
one whole slice, from the bones.
(Wishbones and main breast bone
he kept, on which to serve the
cooked breasts.)
He had pounded each slab of
meat — with, in his case, an old
shoe lined with aluminum foil —
onto a board covered with flour.
That done, he carefully wrapped
the pounded flesh into a ball, each
one containing: one slab of butter
(not margarine); several score
flecks of salt and pepper; and
(unbeknownst to anyone else) a
healthy portion of hash. Where
necessary, he held the mass
together with two (2) toothpicks.
(This is not kosher.) The four
chick balls (sic) were flung into
the deep freeze overnight.
West had also prepared the rice
the day before. After browning
3/4 of a yellow onion (medium
size) in 3 tablespoons of butter,
he had briefly cooked in the glop
the following ingredients: saffron
(a teensy-weensy bit); celery salt
(moderately teensy); garlic salt
(according to taste); sesame seed
(it's kosher, so use LOTS); one
small tomato (for color more
than for seasoning); and a few
other exotic spices which he never
divulged.
Into this mix, he poured
long-grain brown rice (enough for

four hungry people) which he had
obtained from a Health Foods
Store on California Avenue (plug).
When the rice had turned browner
(10-20 minutes), he flicked off
the burner (gas is preferable to
electricity — take THAT PG&E!)
and refrigerated the gooey mess.
The Borsch was similarly
pre-cooked. Into salted and
peppered boiling water, West had
dropped diced (or minced, or
chopped, or hacked-up — West
was simply a stickler) vegetables,
namely: one head of RED
cabbage (very kosher); four (4)
large beets; 6 moderate-sized
onions; and several (8-11) thin,
young carrots. (He forgot to
include a portion of beef bouillon
equal in volume to the water, but
he recovered that gaffe at this
point. The liquid measure was
supposed to be enough to just
cover all the vegetables when
properly "settled" in the pot.)
Now, with his partner playing
what he thought was a doomed
contract, West was ready to
proceed with the final stage of the
meal. First, he took the rice from
the refrig, put it into a frying pan
on the stove, poured in a mix
(1/2, 1/2) of water and beef
consomme sufficient to cover the
contents of the pan (chicken
broth may be substitued for
consomme — but our naive West
was unable to get much juice from
the chick boobs); and cooked the
contents over a LOW flame, once
the liquid had begun to boil.
Assuming that it would take 15
minutes for the rice to absorb the
liquid as it (the rice) swelled, he
then placed a pot of cooking oil
(get the buttery kind) on the
stove, watching as it rose to a boil.
(In this case, the watched pot DID

boil, thereby disproving his old
wife's tale to the contrary.)
While he was waiting for BOTH
containers to seethe with heat, he
smashed up a head (or two) of bib
lettuce and put it into the freezer
to chill. Next he mixed salad oil
(the buttery kind again) with
vinegar (red wine vinegar is best),
in proportions known only to
him, seasoned the result with
specks from his variety of spices
(that's life), and chilled the mix.
Now it was time to deep-fry
the chick boobs, which he did
with the aid of a collander set
inside the oil-boiling pot. (A large
strainer would have done well,
also, though it would not be as
kosher.) Each qooq took 10
minutes to cook (perhaps 15,
depending on things), and he was
able to fit them all into the
collander so that they were
immersed fully in the oil.
Next he re-heated the Borsch.
Finally, he took the salad and oil
from the freezer and tossed the
lettuce leaves (not too far) as he
let the oil and vinegar — together
with two (2) fresh, uncooked
eggs, which he added for a
Roman-esque flair — drip into the
swirling leaves from a Viennese
wine-pourer he had hooked to the
ceiling. (For your own
wine-pourer, send 139 Austrian
Schilling, together with the words
from ANY pre-war "Familie"
cereal package, to: Frl. Use
Schmidt-Ingelheim, AlOlO Wein,
Seilerstatte 30, OSTERREICH.
Allow at least 7 1/4 months for
delivery.)
Just before he set everything
on the table, West poured 1 1 /2
cups dried Romano cheese flakes
(Parmesan is less kosher but will
suffice) and 1 /2 cup light white
wine (1 959 Liebfraumilch,
spatlese is best) into the rice and
stirred it all up with a bent fork.
A bottle of chilled Piesporter
Riesling (auslese, if possible),
1 959 vintage (1945 would be
better), was set in an ice bucket at
the head of "the table as the
Chinese dinner gong was sounded.
As West returned to the bridge
table, he found, to his great
surprise and delight, that his
partner had actually MADE 5
HEARTS, DOUBLED AND
REDOUBLED!!! Here's how she
did it:
The Play of the Hand at 5 Hearts

After cashing her Ace of
Trumps, South realized she could
not safely lead either minor suit,
so she reluctantly decided to lead
through dummy's Spades to her
partner's (known) strength. East,
however, cashed the Ace and
paused to take stock of the
situation. North's bid of 3 No,
and subsequent redouble,
suggested a Heart stopper.
Obviously, with only three Hearts
now outstanding, they must lie in
the North hand, she reasoned
(correctly).
South clearly had a singleton
Ace of Hand a doubleton spade.
(After all, she had bid two minors,
and her lead of the Nine of S
implied possession of a lower one
when North dropped the Eight
under dummy's Ace.) Concluding
that she could safely set up her
dummy's Spade suit without
fearing a ruff from South, East led
the Three, trumping North's Jack
with her Heart Four. Crossing
back to dummy's Diamond K
(whether South ducked now was
immaterial) East pried North's
remaining Spade (the K) and
trumped it with the Four of
Hearts.
This time crossing to dummy
with a trump (which revealed
South's current void), East led
another Spade. North was forced
to rough to prevent East from
sloughing (a Diamond), but East
swiftly over-roughed. Now
North's Jack was unprotected,
and East captured it with her
King. It only remained to enter
with the Club Ace to cash in the
two good Spades —on which East
deceptively sloughed a Diamond
and a Club. South, however, could
not be end-played and cashed the
last trick (either a Club or a
Diamond). But East had
triumphed.
So had West — with the Chick
Boobs. Unfortunately, North
found no splender in the grass and
excused himself to race for the
bathroom. His sickness abated,
and the effects of the hash and
the Piesporter established, both
couples embarked (or em-bedded)
on yet another "trip," which
concluded this weekly
convocation of the Stanford BLT.

(whether South ducked now was
immaterial) East pried North's
remaining Spade (the K) and
trumped it with the Four of
Hearts.
This time crossing to dummy
with a trump (which revealed
South's current void), East led
another Spade. North was forced
to rough to prevent East from
sloughing (a Diamond), but East
swiftly over-roughed. Now
North's Jack was unprotected,
and East captured it with her
King. It only remained to enter
with the Club Ace to cash in the
two good Spades —on which East
deceptively sloughed a Diamond
and a Club. South, however, could
not be end-played and cashed the
last trick (either a Club or a
Diamond). But East had
triumphed.
So had West — with the Chick
Boobs. Unfortunately, North
found no splender in the grass and
excused himself to race for the
bathroom. His sickness abated,
and the effects of the hash and
the Piesporter established, both
couples embarked (or em-bedded)
on yet another "trip," which
concluded this weekly
convocation of the Stanford BLT.
(Both part of the "Bridge,
Love And Tasting League, article
arc under copyright, 1970.)
(This article is being used with
the author's permission.)
West was able to serve a
finished meal by the time the
hand had been played out, thanks
to the preparations he had made
the night before. For each person,
he had purchased and de-boned a
full chicken breast, carefully
breaking the shoulder blade with
his hands and peeling the meat, in
one whole slice, from the bones.
(Wishbones and main breast bone
he kept, on which to serve the
cooked breasts.)
He had pounded each slab of
meat — with, in his case, an old
shoe lined with aluminum foil —
onto a board covered with flour.
That done, he carefully wrapped
the pounded flesh into a ball, each
one containing: one slab of butter
(not margarine); several score
flecks of salt and pepper; and
(unbeknownst to anyone else) a
healthy portion of hash. Where
necessary, he held the mass
together with two (2) toothpicks.
(This is not kosher.) The four
chick balls (sic) were flung into
the deep freeze overnight.
West had also prepared the rice
the day before. After browning
3/4 of a yellow onion (medium
size) in 3 tablespoons of butter,
he had briefly cooked in the glop
the following ingredients: saffron
(a teensy-weensy bit); celery salt
(moderately teensy); garlic salt
(according to taste); sesame seed
(it's kosher, so use LOTS); one
small tomato (for color more
than for seasoning); and a few
other exotic spices which he never
divulged.
Into this mix, he poured
long-grain brown rice (enough for

four hungry people) which he had
obtained from a Health Foods
Store on California Avenue (plug).
When the rice had turned browner
(10-20 minutes), he flicked off
the burner (gas is preferable to
electricity — take THAT PG&E!)
and refrigerated the gooey mess.
The Borsch was similarly
pre-cooked. Into salted and
peppered boiling water, West had
dropped diced (or minced, or
chopped, or hacked-up — West
was simply a stickler) vegetables,
namely: one head of RED
cabbage (very kosher); four (4)
large beets; 6 moderate-sized
onions; and several (8-11) thin,
young carrots. (He forgot to
include a portion of beef bouillon
equal in volume to the water, but
he recovered that gaffe at this
point. The liquid measure was
supposed to be enough to just
cover all the vegetables when
properly "settled" in the pot.)
Now, with his partner playing
what he thought was a doomed
contract, West was ready to
proceed with the final stage of the
meal. First, he took the rice from
the refrig, put it into a frying pan
on the stove, poured in a mix
(1/2, 1/2) of water and beef
consomme sufficient to cover the
contents of the pan (chicken
broth may be substitued for
consomme — but our naive West
was unable to get much juice from
the chick boobs); and cooked the
contents over a LOW flame, once
the liquid had begun to boil.
Assuming that it would take 15
minutes for the rice to absorb the
liquid as it (the rice) swelled, he
then placed a pot of cooking oil
(get the buttery kind) on the
stove, watching as it rose to a boil.
(In this case, the watched pot DID

boil, thereby disproving his old
wife's tale to the contrary.)
While he was waiting for BOTH
containers to seethe with heat, he
smashed up a head (or two) of bib
lettuce and put it into the freezer
to chill. Next he mixed salad oil
(the buttery kind again) with
vinegar (red wine vinegar is best),
in proportions known only to
him, seasoned the result with
specks from his variety of spices
(that's life), and chilled the mix.
Now it was time to deep-fry
the chick boobs, which he did
with the aid of a collander set
inside the oil-boiling pot. (A large
strainer would have done well,
also, though it would not be as
kosher.) Each qooq took 10
minutes to cook (perhaps 15,
depending on things), and he was
able to fit them all into the
collander so that they were
immersed fully in the oil.
Next he re-heated the Borsch.
Finally, he took the salad and oil
from the freezer and tossed the
lettuce leaves (not too far) as he
let the oil and vinegar — together
with two (2) fresh, uncooked
eggs, which he added for a
Roman-esque flair — drip into the
swirling leaves from a Viennese
wine-pourer he had hooked to the
ceiling. (For your own
wine-pourer, send 139 Austrian
Schilling, together with the words
from ANY pre-war "Familie"
cereal package, to: Frl. Use
Schmidt-Ingelheim, AlOlO Wein,
Seilerstatte 30, OSTERREICH.
Allow at least 7 1/4 months for
delivery.)
Just before he set everything
on the table, West poured 1 1 /2
cups dried Romano cheese flakes
(Parmesan is less kosher but will
suffice) and 1 /2 cup light white
wine (1 959 Liebfraumilch,
spatlese is best) into the rice and
stirred it all up with a bent fork.
A bottle of chilled Piesporter
Riesling (auslese, if possible),
1 959 vintage (1945 would be
better), was set in an ice bucket at
the head of "the table as the
Chinese dinner gong was sounded.
As West returned to the bridge
table, he found, to his great
surprise and delight, that his
partner had actually MADE 5
HEARTS, DOUBLED AND
REDOUBLED!!! Here's how she
did it:
The Play of the Hand at 5 Hearts

After cashing her Ace of
Trumps, South realized she could
not safely lead either minor suit,
so she reluctantly decided to lead
through dummy's Spades to her
partner's (known) strength. East,
however, cashed the Ace and
paused to take stock of the
situation. North's bid of 3 No,
and subsequent redouble,
suggested a Heart stopper.
Obviously, with only three Hearts
now outstanding, they must lie in
the North hand, she reasoned
(correctly).
South clearly had a singleton
Ace of Hand a doubleton spade.
(After all, she had bid two minors,
and her lead of the Nine of S
implied possession of a lower one
when North dropped the Eight
under dummy's Ace.) Concluding
that she could safely set up her
dummy's Spade suit without
fearing a ruff from South, East led
the Three, trumping North's Jack
with her Heart Four. Crossing
back to dummy's Diamond K
(whether South ducked now was

remaining Spade (the K) and
trumped it with the Four of

table, he found, to his great
surprise and delight, that his
partner had actually MADE 5
HEARTS, DOUBLED AND
REDOUBLED!!! Here's how she
did it:
The Play of the Hand at 5 Hearts

After cashing her Ace of
Trumps, South realized she could
not safely lead either minor suit,
so she reluctantly decided to lead
through dummy's Spades to her
partner's (known) strength. East,
however, cashed the Ace and
paused to take stock of the
situation. North's bid of 3 No,
and subsequent redouble,
suggested a Heart stopper.
Obviously, with only three Hearts
now outstanding, they must lie in
the North hand, she reasoned
(correctly).
South clearly had a singleton
Ace of Hand a doubleton spade.
(After all, she had bid two minors,
and her lead of the Nine of S
implied possession of a lower one
when North dropped the Eight
under dummy's Ace.) Concluding
that she could safely set up her
dummy's Spade suit without
fearing a ruff from South, East led
the Three, trumping North's Jack
with her Heart Four. Crossing
back to dummy's Diamond K
(whether South ducked now was
immaterial) East pried North's
remaining Spade (the K) and
trumped it with the Four of
Hearts.
This time crossing to dummy
with a trump (which revealed
South's current void), East led
another Spade. North was forced
to rough to prevent East from
sloughing (a Diamond), but East
swiftly over-roughed. Now
North's Jack was unprotected,
and East captured it with her
King. It only remained to enter
with the Club Ace to cash in the
two good Spades —on which East
deceptively sloughed a Diamond
and a Club. South, however, could
not be end-played and cashed the
last trick (either a Club or a
Diamond). But East had
triumphed.
So had West — with the Chick
Boobs. Unfortunately, North
found no splender in the grass and
excused himself to race for the
bathroom. His sickness abated,
and the effects of the hash and
the Piesporter established, both
couples embarked (or em-bedded)
on yet another "trip," which
concluded this weekly
convocation of the Stanford BLT.
(Both part of the "Bridge,
Love And Tasting League, article
arc under copyright, 1970.)
(This article is being used with
the author's permission.)
West was able to serve a
finished meal by the time the
hand had been played out, thanks
to the preparations he had made
the night before. For each person,
he had purchased and de-boned a
full chicken breast, carefully
breaking the shoulder blade with
his hands and peeling the meat, in
one whole slice, from the bones.
(Wishbones and main breast bone
he kept, on which to serve the
cooked breasts.)
He had pounded each slab of
meat — with, in his case, an old
shoe lined with aluminum foil —
onto a board covered with flour.
That done, he carefully wrapped
the pounded flesh into a ball, each
one containing: one slab of butter
(not margarine); several score
flecks of salt and pepper; and
(unbeknownst to anyone else) a
healthy portion of hash. Where
necessary, he held the mass
together with two (2) toothpicks.
(This is not kosher.) The four
chick balls (sic) were flung into
the deep freeze overnight.
West had also prepared the rice
the day before. After browning
3/4 of a yellow onion (medium
size) in 3 tablespoons of butter,
he had briefly cooked in the glop
the following ingredients: saffron
(a teensy-weensy bit); celery salt
(moderately teensy); garlic salt
(according to taste); sesame seed
(it's kosher, so use LOTS); one
small tomato (for color more
than for seasoning); and a few
other exotic spices which he never
divulged.
Into this mix, he poured
long-grain brown rice (enough for

four hungry people) which he had
obtained from a Health Foods
Store on California Avenue (plug).
When the rice had turned browner
(10-20 minutes), he flicked off
the burner (gas is preferable to
electricity — take THAT PG&E!)
and refrigerated the gooey mess.
The Borsch was similarly
pre-cooked. Into salted and
peppered boiling water, West had
dropped diced (or minced, or
chopped, or hacked-up — West
was simply a stickler) vegetables,
namely: one head of RED
cabbage (very kosher); four (4)
large beets; 6 moderate-sized
onions; and several (8-11) thin,
young carrots. (He forgot to
include a portion of beef bouillon
equal in volume to the water, but
he recovered that gaffe at this
point. The liquid measure was
supposed to be enough to just
cover all the vegetables when
properly "settled" in the pot.)
Now, with his partner playing
what he thought was a doomed
contract, West was ready to
proceed with the final stage of the
meal. First, he took the rice from
the refrig, put it into a frying pan
on the stove, poured in a mix
(1/2, 1/2) of water and beef
consomme sufficient to cover the
contents of the pan (chicken
broth may be substitued for
consomme — but our naive West
was unable to get much juice from
the chick boobs); and cooked the
contents over a LOW flame, once
the liquid had begun to boil.
Assuming that it would take 15
minutes for the rice to absorb the
liquid as it (the rice) swelled, he
then placed a pot of cooking oil
(get the buttery kind) on the
stove, watching as it rose to a boil.
(In this case, the watched pot DID

boil, thereby disproving his old
wife's tale to the contrary.)
While he was waiting for BOTH
containers to seethe with heat, he
smashed up a head (or two) of bib
lettuce and put it into the freezer
to chill. Next he mixed salad oil
(the buttery kind again) with
vinegar (red wine vinegar is best),
in proportions known only to
him, seasoned the result with
specks from his variety of spices
(that's life), and chilled the mix.
Now it was time to deep-fry
the chick boobs, which he did
with the aid of a collander set
inside the oil-boiling pot. (A large
strainer would have done well,
also, though it would not be as
kosher.) Each qooq took 10
minutes to cook (perhaps 15,
depending on things), and he was
able to fit them all into the
collander so that they were
immersed fully in the oil.
Next he re-heated the Borsch.
Finally, he took the salad and oil
from the freezer and tossed the
lettuce leaves (not too far) as he
let the oil and vinegar — together
with two (2) fresh, uncooked
eggs, which he added for a
Roman-esque flair — drip into the
swirling leaves from a Viennese
wine-pourer he had hooked to the
ceiling. (For your own
wine-pourer, send 139 Austrian
Schilling, together with the words
from ANY pre-war "Familie"
cereal package, to: Frl. Use
Schmidt-Ingelheim, AlOlO Wein,
Seilerstatte 30, OSTERREICH.
Allow at least 7 1/4 months for
delivery.)
Just before he set everything
on the table, West poured 1 1 /2
cups dried Romano cheese flakes
(Parmesan is less kosher but will
suffice) and 1 /2 cup light white
wine (1 959 Liebfraumilch,
spatlese is best) into the rice and
stirred it all up with a bent fork.
A bottle of chilled Piesporter
Riesling (auslese, if possible),
1 959 vintage (1945 would be
better), was set in an ice bucket at
the head of "the table as the
Chinese dinner gong was sounded.

let the oil and vinegar — together
with two (2) fresh, uncooked
eggs, which he added for a
Roman-esque flair — drip into the
swirling leaves from a Viennese
wine-pourer he had hooked to the
ceiling. (For your own

Just before he set everything

As West returned to the bridge
table, he found, to his great
surprise and delight, that his
partner had actually MADE 5
HEARTS, DOUBLED AND
REDOUBLED!!! Here's how she
did it:
The Play of the Hand at 5 Hearts

After cashing her Ace of
Trumps, South realized she could
not safely lead either minor suit,
so she reluctantly decided to lead
through dummy's Spades to her
partner's (known) strength. East,
however, cashed the Ace and
paused to take stock of the
situation. North's bid of 3 No,
and subsequent redouble,
suggested a Heart stopper.
Obviously, with only three Hearts
now outstanding, they must lie in
the North hand, she reasoned
(correctly).
South clearly had a singleton
Ace of Hand a doubleton spade.
(After all, she had bid two minors,
and her lead of the Nine of S
implied possession of a lower one
when North dropped the Eight
under dummy's Ace.) Concluding
that she could safely set up her
dummy's Spade suit without
fearing a ruff from South, East led
the Three, trumping North's Jack
with her Heart Four. Crossing
back to dummy's Diamond K
(whether South ducked now was
immaterial) East pried North's
remaining Spade (the K) and
trumped it with the Four of
Hearts.
This time crossing to dummy
with a trump (which revealed
South's current void), East led
another Spade. North was forced
to rough to prevent East from
sloughing (a Diamond), but East
swiftly over-roughed. Now
North's Jack was unprotected,
and East captured it with her
King. It only remained to enter
with the Club Ace to cash in the
two good Spades —on which East
deceptively sloughed a Diamond
and a Club. South, however, could
not be end-played and cashed the
last trick (either a Club or a
Diamond). But East had
triumphed.
So had West — with the Chick
Boobs. Unfortunately, North
found no splender in the grass and
excused himself to race for the
bathroom. His sickness abated,
and the effects of the hash and
the Piesporter established, both
couples embarked (or em-bedded)
on yet another "trip," which
concluded this weekly
convocation of the Stanford BLT.
(Both part of the "Bridge,
Love And Tasting League, article
arc under copyright, 1970.)
(This article is being used with
the author's permission.)
West was able to serve a
finished meal by the time the
hand had been played out, thanks
to the preparations he had made
the night before. For each person,
he had purchased and de-boned a
full chicken breast, carefully
breaking the shoulder blade with
his hands and peeling the meat, in
one whole slice, from the bones.
(Wishbones and main breast bone
he kept, on which to serve the
cooked breasts.)
He had pounded each slab of
meat — with, in his case, an old
shoe lined with aluminum foil —
onto a board covered with flour.
That done, he carefully wrapped
the pounded flesh into a ball, each
one containing: one slab of butter
(not margarine); several score
flecks of salt and pepper; and
(unbeknownst to anyone else) a
healthy portion of hash. Where
necessary, he held the mass
together with two (2) toothpicks.
(This is not kosher.) The four
chick balls (sic) were flung into
the deep freeze overnight.
West had also prepared the rice
the day before. After browning
3/4 of a yellow onion (medium
size) in 3 tablespoons of butter,
he had briefly cooked in the glop
the following ingredients: saffron
(a teensy-weensy bit); celery salt
(moderately teensy); garlic salt
(according to taste); sesame seed
(it's kosher, so use LOTS); one
small tomato (for color more
than for seasoning); and a few
other exotic spices which he never
divulged.
Into this mix, he poured
long-grain brown rice (enough for

four hungry people) which he had
obtained from a Health Foods
Store on California Avenue (plug).
When the rice had turned browner
(10-20 minutes), he flicked off
the burner (gas is preferable to
electricity — take THAT PG&E!)
and refrigerated the gooey mess.
The Borsch was similarly
pre-cooked. Into salted and
peppered boiling water, West had
dropped diced (or minced, or
chopped, or hacked-up — West
was simply a stickler) vegetables,
namely: one head of RED
cabbage (very kosher); four (4)
large beets; 6 moderate-sized
onions; and several (8-11) thin,
young carrots. (He forgot to
include a portion of beef bouillon
equal in volume to the water, but
he recovered that gaffe at this
point. The liquid measure was
supposed to be enough to just
cover all the vegetables when
properly "settled" in the pot.)
Now, with his partner playing
what he thought was a doomed
contract, West was ready to
proceed with the final stage of the
meal. First, he took the rice from
the refrig, put it into a frying pan
on the stove, poured in a mix
(1/2, 1/2) of water and beef
consomme sufficient to cover the
contents of the pan (chicken
broth may be substitued for
consomme — but our naive West
was unable to get much juice from
the chick boobs); and cooked the
contents over a LOW flame, once
the liquid had begun to boil.
Assuming that it would take 15
minutes for the rice to absorb the
liquid as it (the rice) swelled, he
then placed a pot of cooking oil
(get the buttery kind) on the
stove, watching as it rose to a boil.
(In this case, the watched pot DID

boil, thereby disproving his old
wife's tale to the contrary.)
While he was waiting for BOTH
containers to seethe with heat, he
smashed up a head (or two) of bib
lettuce and put it into the freezer
to chill. Next he mixed salad oil
(the buttery kind again) with
vinegar (red wine vinegar is best),
in proportions known only to
him, seasoned the result with
specks from his variety of spices
(that's life), and chilled the mix.
Now it was time to deep-fry
the chick boobs, which he did
with the aid of a collander set
inside the oil-boiling pot. (A large
strainer would have done well,
also, though it would not be as
kosher.) Each qooq took 10
minutes to cook (perhaps 15,
depending on things), and he was
able to fit them all into the
collander so that they were
immersed fully in the oil.
Next he re-heated the Borsch.
Finally, he took the salad and oil
from the freezer and tossed the
lettuce leaves (not too far) as he
let the oil and vinegar — together
with two (2) fresh, uncooked
eggs, which he added for a
Roman-esque flair — drip into the
swirling leaves from a Viennese
wine-pourer he had hooked to the
ceiling. (For your own
