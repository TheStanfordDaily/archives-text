# The 						Groove Tube: A Funky Funshow
## 
### NEIL ARNET 
Wow! The Groove Tube is
tremendous. With the shyness of
Hugh Hefner and the quietness of
Spiro Agenw the Groove Tube
comes on hilariously. It's fun and
worth seeing.
Kenneth Shapiro and Lane
Sarasohn have put together a
vibes tape of short, satirical bits;
have mounted four television
monitors for the audience to
watch; and have produced the
brilliant, closed-circuit Groove
Tube.
How to describe the Groove
Tube. Well, imagine chancing
upon an issue of Mad Magazine
for Adults Only. Then choose
about thirty of the cleverest,
sharpest articles and envision
them on a closed-circuit television
that doesn't have Big Brother as a
censor. And see yourself laughing,
for you will be laughing. Alfred E.
Newman did. So did Arthur.
Imagine a screen turning on
with a man's hand rubbing the
back of a blouseless girl as he
gropes about trying to unsnap the
back of her bra. Hear his panting
as he realizes there are three
snaps. Guess about the frustrating
end.
Or maybe you'd like to see
Koko the Klown doing request
readings during make-believe time.
Imagine Koko smoking a cigarette

and reading page 254 of Fanny
Hill. Follow Koko with the satire
of Jonathan Swift in take-offs of
Kraft Kitchen, the Ford LTD (the
car as big as your ego), and sports
specials (notably the Tijuana Sex
Games on K.T.V.D.). Hear
Manuel, a star competitor of the
late 5 o's describe the play by play
action of this year's Six Games.
And watch for those instant
replays, especially of the probe.
It's all Mad, humorous,
satirically wild, and a joy to
watch. The Groove Tube takes on
racism, homosexuality, Clorets,
and The Yellow Pages. And the
Groove Tube wins every time.
What's more, some of the bits
have no other purpose than
simply to be exceedingly clever
and humorous. And they succeed
to the fullest. One of the best of
these shorts is two faces moving,
twisting, pulsing to the time of
classical music.
I thoroughly enjoyed the
Groove Tube. The sequences are
almost all great. Besides, it shows
in the North Beach area of San
Francisco, and there are many
fine, reasonably priced restaurants
in the area, such as The
Savoy-Tivoli in front, of The
Groove Tube and the Old
Spaghetti Factory around the
corner. The Groove Tube is at
1 4 38 Grant Avenue. Fnjoy it.

Imagine a screen turning on
with a man's hand rubbing the
back of a blouseless girl as he
gropes about trying to unsnap the
back of her bra. Hear his panting
as he realizes there are three
snaps. Guess about the frustrating
end.
Or maybe you'd like to see
Koko the Klown doing request
readings during make-believe time.
Imagine Koko smoking a cigarette

and reading page 254 of Fanny
Hill. Follow Koko with the satire
of Jonathan Swift in take-offs of
Kraft Kitchen, the Ford LTD (the
car as big as your ego), and sports
specials (notably the Tijuana Sex
Games on K.T.V.D.). Hear
Manuel, a star competitor of the
late 5 o's describe the play by play
action of this year's Six Games.
And watch for those instant
replays, especially of the probe.
It's all Mad, humorous,
satirically wild, and a joy to
watch. The Groove Tube takes on
racism, homosexuality, Clorets,
and The Yellow Pages. And the
Groove Tube wins every time.
What's more, some of the bits
have no other purpose than
simply to be exceedingly clever
and humorous. And they succeed
to the fullest. One of the best of
these shorts is two faces moving,
twisting, pulsing to the time of
classical music.
I thoroughly enjoyed the
Groove Tube. The sequences are
almost all great. Besides, it shows
in the North Beach area of San
Francisco, and there are many
fine, reasonably priced restaurants
in the area, such as The
Savoy-Tivoli in front, of The
Groove Tube and the Old
Spaghetti Factory around the
corner. The Groove Tube is at
1 4 38 Grant Avenue. Fnjoy it.
Wow! The Groove Tube is
tremendous. With the shyness of
Hugh Hefner and the quietness of
Spiro Agenw the Groove Tube
comes on hilariously. It's fun and
worth seeing.
Kenneth Shapiro and Lane
Sarasohn have put together a
vibes tape of short, satirical bits;
have mounted four television
monitors for the audience to
watch; and have produced the
brilliant, closed-circuit Groove
Tube.
How to describe the Groove
Tube. Well, imagine chancing
upon an issue of Mad Magazine
for Adults Only. Then choose
about thirty of the cleverest,
sharpest articles and envision
them on a closed-circuit television
that doesn't have Big Brother as a
censor. And see yourself laughing,
for you will be laughing. Alfred E.
Newman did. So did Arthur.
