# Roughly 40,000?
## Should Be Tickets For AU SPORTS 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Barring unforseen
circumstances, "Every student
should be able to purchase a
ticket for the Rose Bowl." That
was the word yesterday from
Stanford Athletic Director Chuck
Taylor who attempted to clarify
the mysteries concerning tickets
to the Rose Bowl.
If Stanford is able to defeat
Oregon State and Washington over
the next two weekends, they will
finally capture that elusive bowl
bid which has eluded them for 18
years. Not since 1 95 2 have the
Indians started off the new year
with anything more than
hangovers and resolutions to
improve next fall.
Although every student can
safely assume he will be able to
get a ticket, the exact details of
distribution are still not yet
known.
Numbers Breakdown
According to Mas Colwell,
manager of the Tournament of
Roses, 55,000 will be allotted to
the Pacific-8. Approximately
20,000 go to the Big Ten, with
the rest left for the Tournament
of Roses people and some 4 000
for the general public, which have
already been sold.
Information published in
yesterday's Daily that Stanford
would get approximately 10,0 0 0
tickets was apparently incorrect.
But long before the 5 5 ,0 0 0
reach Stanford, at least 10,000
will probably be siphoned off by
the Pac-8 for the use of the press,
other schools and the brass.
Then theoretically those
remaining will come to Stanford.
But Taylor warns that the number

is nowhere near certain yet. And
even once the tickets get here, the
mechanics by which they will be
distributed are not yet known.
Taylor has been meeting with
members of the administration in
an effort to determine the
handling of the tickets. These
meetings will not actually
determine anything decisive until
another week has passed, since
Stanford is not in until at least
after next Saturday's game.
Stanford Distribution
Still no matter how many
reach Stanford, probably a
number around 4 0,000, there are
certain things which are almost
sure to occur. Four or five
thousand tickets will be
distributed internally among the
university, presumably to athletic
department administrative and
other personnel.
This would leave tickets in the
neighborhood of the mid-thirty
thousands. They would be sold
first to students, faculty and staff

and then to season ticket holders
and Buck Club members. This
would almost certainly finish off
what will be available.
Regardless of how many
tickets are available, it is almost a
certainty that none will be left for
the general public. Thus the best
bet for people off campus is to
hook up with one of the
innumerable package deals
available at local ticket agencies.
Package Deals
In the last week a number of
Stanford pennants have suddenly
appeared in the windows of many
travel agencies. For anywhere
upwards of $100 a person can get
involved in any number of deals
which include tickets, hotel

rooms, transportation, sightseeing,
box lunches . . .
All the numbers given in this
article are approximate since
nothing can be certain for at least
another ten days. But Taylor feels
certain that each student will be
able to count on getting a ticket.
In an attempt to assure this,
Taylor has even been meeting
with Overseas Campus Director
Robert Walker to work out
provisions for tickets for students
overseas.
If everything works out for the
best and the Tribe does defeat
OSU and Washington, Taylor is
certain that more exact figures
will soon be available. The Daily
will print exact information as
soon as possible, probably after
Nov. 10.

available at local ticket agencies.
Package Deals
In the last week a number of
Stanford pennants have suddenly
appeared in the windows of many
travel agencies. For anywhere
upwards of $100 a person can get
involved in any number of deals
which include tickets, hotel

rooms, transportation, sightseeing,
box lunches . . .
All the numbers given in this
article are approximate since
nothing can be certain for at least
another ten days. But Taylor feels
certain that each student will be
able to count on getting a ticket.
In an attempt to assure this,
Taylor has even been meeting
with Overseas Campus Director
Robert Walker to work out
provisions for tickets for students
overseas.
If everything works out for the
best and the Tribe does defeat
OSU and Washington, Taylor is
certain that more exact figures
will soon be available. The Daily
will print exact information as
soon as possible, probably after
Nov. 10.
Barring unforseen
circumstances, "Every student
should be able to purchase a
ticket for the Rose Bowl." That
was the word yesterday from
Stanford Athletic Director Chuck
Taylor who attempted to clarify
the mysteries concerning tickets
to the Rose Bowl.
If Stanford is able to defeat
Oregon State and Washington over
the next two weekends, they will
finally capture that elusive bowl
bid which has eluded them for 18
years. Not since 1 95 2 have the
Indians started off the new year
with anything more than
hangovers and resolutions to
improve next fall.
Although every student can
safely assume he will be able to
get a ticket, the exact details of
distribution are still not yet
known.
Numbers Breakdown
According to Mas Colwell,
manager of the Tournament of
Roses, 55,000 will be allotted to
the Pacific-8. Approximately
20,000 go to the Big Ten, with
the rest left for the Tournament
of Roses people and some 4 000
for the general public, which have
already been sold.
Information published in
yesterday's Daily that Stanford
would get approximately 10,0 0 0
tickets was apparently incorrect.
But long before the 5 5 ,0 0 0
reach Stanford, at least 10,000
will probably be siphoned off by
the Pac-8 for the use of the press,
other schools and the brass.
Then theoretically those
remaining will come to Stanford.
But Taylor warns that the number

is nowhere near certain yet. And
even once the tickets get here, the
mechanics by which they will be
distributed are not yet known.
Taylor has been meeting with
members of the administration in
an effort to determine the
handling of the tickets. These
meetings will not actually
determine anything decisive until
another week has passed, since
Stanford is not in until at least
after next Saturday's game.
Stanford Distribution
Still no matter how many
reach Stanford, probably a
number around 4 0,000, there are
certain things which are almost
sure to occur. Four or five
thousand tickets will be
distributed internally among the
university, presumably to athletic
department administrative and
other personnel.
This would leave tickets in the
neighborhood of the mid-thirty
thousands. They would be sold
first to students, faculty and staff

and then to season ticket holders
and Buck Club members. This
would almost certainly finish off
what will be available.
Regardless of how many
tickets are available, it is almost a
certainty that none will be left for
the general public. Thus the best
bet for people off campus is to
hook up with one of the
innumerable package deals
available at local ticket agencies.
