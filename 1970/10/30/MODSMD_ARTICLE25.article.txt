# Frosh Gridders Here Today Against Undefeated Cal Poly
## 
### 
Seeking their initial win of the
season the Stanford freshmen
football team opens the sports
weekend today with a 2 p.m.
game in the stadium against Cal
Poly at San Luis Obispo. For the
second week in a row, the
Papooses will be facing an
undefeated opponent.

Last Saturday the Indians lost
their season opener to the
undefeated UCLA Frosh, 20-19.
Cal Poly will come into the game
searching for their fourth victory
of the campaign. Previous wins
came over Cuesta College 14-0,
Santa Clara Frosh 35-13, and Cal
Lutheran JV'ssB-20.
Despite losing, the Cards
outgained UCLA 433 yards to
344. Leading the attack was
quarterback Eric Test who hit on
16 of 38 passes for 237 yards.
Still, Coach Bill Moultrie is
undecided between starting Test
or Mike Gilyard who was injured
in the Bruin game after throwing
one TD pass.
On the receiving end of that
TD pass was Gilyard's high school
teammate, Rufus Shaw, who
caught five passes for 161 yards.
Rounding out the backfield will
be high school All-American John
Winesberry and fullback Jim
Ferguson. The two combined for
155 yards last Friday.
Anchoring the defensive team
for the Indians are two brothers,
Mark and John Ferguson who are
the starting defensive tackles. The

two go at 6-5, 215. One of the
linebackers, John Snider, is the
brother of former Stanford
All-Ameriean Malcom Snider, now
a guard for the Atlanta Falcons.
The game today was scheduled
to fill the gap in Stanford's
schedule caused by the
cancellation of a game with San
Jose State. The Spartans for the
second year in a row failed to
field a frosh team due to lack of
interest. The only other home
appearance by the Frosh is next
Friday against USC.
