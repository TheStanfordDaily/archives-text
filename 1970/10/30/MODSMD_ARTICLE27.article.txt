# The 						Next Obstacle-Beavers
## 
### FRED LEESON 
The Rose Bowl is two wins away.
"We play the next two at home," Coach John
Ralston said after last Saturday's 9-7 win over
UCLA. "There's nothing like playing at home.
"It means we have an easy Friday—no
travelling and more time for preparation with less
pressure."
It's a break that could be important for the
Tribe since neither of the successive home
games—Oregon State tomorrow at 1:3 0 p.m. and
Washington Nov. 7 -figures to be a pushover,
unfortunately.
Oregon State, of course, hasn't exactly left
behind a battered trail vanquishing foes as their
3-4 overall and 0-3 conference records indicate.
But although Stanford annihilated the Beavers
33-0 last year in Corvallis and is favored by three
touchdowns to do the same tomorrow, it's never
safe to underestimate Dee Andros.
Pumpkin Routine
Andros is the rotund OSU coach who takes
both his football and his image of the Great
Pumpkin very seriously. He wraps his massive
physique under a brilliant orange jacket and
happens to be partial to orange socks and ties, too.
At one time he even had an old Oldsmobile
with big fins and all painted his favorite orange in
which he cruised rather conspicuously around the
Willamette Valley, promoting Oregon State
football along with his pumpkin trip.
And you're probably aware that Saturday is
Halloween.
Anyway, Andros—who replaced Tom Prothro
at Oregon State five years ago after Prothro left
for UCLA—might be called an emotional man, and
to what extent he'll have his players excited
mentally can never be predicted.
The last time Oregon State came to Stanford
they were underdogs, too. Final score: Oregon
State 29, Stanford 7 .
Those few who endured that rainy afternoon to
its end remember that Stanford didn't get its
touchdown until the final quarter when
then-sophomore Jim Plunkett fired a long pass to
Gene Washington down the right sidelines,
providing a small measure of glory for a team
down 2 9-0 at the time.

Last year Stanford could have won 5 0-0 easily
it it had wanted to, but the Beavers gave up
something like six fumbles—which they have not
done since, and can't be expected to do again.
Oregon State is primarily a running team whose
attack has suffered with the loss of first-team
quarterback Steve Endicott who broke his wrist
five weeks ago in the Beavers' victory over
Oklahoma.
With Endicott gone, Andros has been going
with Jim Kilmartin, a junior who was listed as
third quarterback when the season began.
Andros said during the week that "If we're
going to do well against Stanford we'll have to
throw the ball." Kilmartin so far has thrown 20
completions in 45 tries and has had eight
intercepted.
Watch The Option
But like Endicott, Kilmartin is adept at running
Oregon State's option play which the Beavers
usually run to perfection when they're winning.
Two years ago it was the option play and
fullback Bill Enyart who stunned the Tribe on that
rainy Saturday and this time around the Beavers
have another powerful fullback in Dave Schilling.
Schilling, at 6-3 and 221 , is not exceptionally
fast but he uses his size to advantage and is
currently the Pac-B's second rusher with 634
yards, just four behind league-leader Clarence
Davis at USC.
Schilling has a career total of 1 ,269 yards in 17
games.
Stanford should go into the game at nearly full
strength. Split end Demea Washington, who didn't
suit up last week, is still considered a questionable
performer for tomorrow due to hamstring
problems.
The Indians got slugged during the week with a
number of minor injuries during practice but
everybody but Washington should be ready.
Tight end Bob Moore and linebacker Jeff
Siemon missed some of the week's drills and
offensive tackle Steve Jubb has returned after a
slight concussion from last week's game.
Saturday's crowd is expected to appraoch
7 0,000 if the weather is good. If it isn't, expect
about 60 ,000 and hope history doesn't repeat.

PASSING GAME: Stanford's pass
defenders- like Charles McCloud
(21) and Jim Kauffman, above,
leaving the field after stopping
Dennis Dummit's last drive a week
ago- should get some sort of rest
tomorrow against Oregon State,
which the worst passing offense in
the Pac-8. Meanwhile, Jim
Plunkett- protected at right by
Hillary Shockley (38) and Larry
Jones (7 7) as he sets to throw
against UCLA—will be firing into
the league's second-best pass
defense. The Beavers have been
allowing just 177 yards per game
in the air. Stanford is favored over
the Beavers by 2 0 points which
may turn out to be too wide of a
spread. Oregon State seems to get
stronger towards the end of
seasons, and Coach Dee Andros,
now 3-4, will be anxious to avoid
his first losing season in five years
at OSU.
