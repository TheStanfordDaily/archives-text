# Middle America Says Nixon's The One
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
It was the Woodstock of Middle America,
and the whole "silent-majority-good-decent
people" culture had turned out to hear their
heroes tell them what they wanted to hear.
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George
Murphy had come to speak in San Jose.
Little old ladies were there, dressed as if
they were going to church on Sunday, except
for the Reagan-Reinecke buttons on their
lapels. Middle-aged men were there, puffing on
their cigars, and talking about work and the
most recent maintenance job on their cars.
Middle aged women were there, dressed as if
on their way to a PTA tea, occasionally picking
up their children, restless from the long stand
outside to get into the auditorium.
Finally young people were there, their hair
cut short, though with occasional long
sideburns, the acne barely visible on their faces,
and all looking as if they had played in the high
school band and been Boy Scouts.
No Disappointment
They had all come to hear the President of
the United States speak to them, reassure them,
tell them that they were the good people that
had made America great and that America was
great.
This is what they had come to hear, and
they were not to be disappointed.
Their Woodstock was not a music festival at
which Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin and some
good dope took their minds to places they had
never been before. No, their Woodstock was a
political rally at which Ronald Reagan and
Richard Nixon and a white middle classness
reassured them that they were part of the
greatest nation in the history of man, and that
they were good people.
As the mass of people outside was allowed
to enter the auditorium, it was greeted by a
strange mixture of cute high school "Murphy
girls" and stern-faced Secret Service agents.
Murphy's Girls
The girls wore short blue skirts, white
blouses with a blue Murphy banner across them
and broad smiles. They were the type of girls

that made cheerleaders and baton twirlers, the
type of girl you wanted to marry in eighth
grade.
"Why are you for Murphy?" I asked one.
"That's a good question," she replied
shrugging her shoulders.
I don't know," replied another, "I guess
because both my parents are Democrats." She
burst into giggles and put her white gloved hand
over her mouth and blushed.
Then you looked at the Secret Service men
interspersed among them, glaring at everyone
with suspicion. Suddenly you were brought out
of your dream world and you realized that
there was another side to America.
Republicanism
As the speeches began, patriotism,
Republicanism, quotes from Ben Franklin and
Abraham Lincoln were tossed around like
obscenities in an Andy Warhol flick.
Although the audience sounded enthusiastic,
you knew they were waiting for the final set for
which most of them had come. When Nixon
finally strode onto the stage the auditorium
exploded into cheers and you knew at once
they believed in him and he in them. There was
an empathy between the man on stage and the
audience that had seldom if ever been exceeded
in the best sets at the Fillmore.
They were his type of people and he was
their type of man, and you could feel the
understanding between President and people.
You had to feel it, even if you couldn't feel
part of it.
And he gave them what they wanted.
'Honorable Peace'
He talked about peace abroad, an
"honorable peace," a peace which will make it
possible that "those who shout obscene slogans
at home against the war will never be needed to
fight in another one."
He talked about peace at home, telling the
audience about the 158 percent rise in crime in
the past eight years, and of burned banks, and
anarchy, and that it had to end.
He talked about the 900 demonstrators

outside shouting obscenities, but that he had
faith in America, that he knew "the violent
radical few will not be the leaders of America's
future."
The crowd gave him a standing ovation. You
had to be impressed.
The most powerful man in the world had
understood them. The President of the United
States had told them they were right, that they
constituted what was good and decent in
America, and that they would not be defeated.
They felt reassured.
'He's the Greatest'
"He was beautiful!" exclaimed one Murphy
girl practically in tears.
"He was great!" screeched another.
"He's the greatest man in the whole world!"
sighed a third.
You wish you could have agreed with them.
You wish that you too could have believed
in him and been able to cheer for him.
Yet while he spoke of freedom, you looked
at the stern Secret Service man in each aisle.
Credibility
While he stated, "Our power has never been
used to destroy freedom or peace," you
thought of a great nationalist leader in
Vietnam, who incorporated the beginning of
our constitution into his country's own and
then witnessed his dream and country
destroyed by our power.
While he spoke of equality you asked
yourself "Why aren't there more black people
here?" and then you remembered that they
were outside in tattered overalls selling
newspapers.
Richard Nixon was impressive. You wanted
to be able to leap up at the end of his speech
with the Murphy girls and scream and yell,
sincerely believing the things were right in this
country. But you couldn't.

part of it.
And he gave them what they wanted.
'Honorable Peace'
He talked about peace abroad, an
"honorable peace," a peace which will make it
possible that "those who shout obscene slogans
at home against the war will never be needed to
fight in another one."
He talked about peace at home, telling the
audience about the 158 percent rise in crime in
the past eight years, and of burned banks, and
anarchy, and that it had to end.
He talked about the 900 demonstrators

outside shouting obscenities, but that he had
faith in America, that he knew "the violent
radical few will not be the leaders of America's
future."
The crowd gave him a standing ovation. You
had to be impressed.
The most powerful man in the world had
understood them. The President of the United
States had told them they were right, that they
constituted what was good and decent in
America, and that they would not be defeated.
They felt reassured.
'He's the Greatest'
"He was beautiful!" exclaimed one Murphy
girl practically in tears.
"He was great!" screeched another.
"He's the greatest man in the whole world!"
sighed a third.
You wish you could have agreed with them.
You wish that you too could have believed
in him and been able to cheer for him.
Yet while he spoke of freedom, you looked
at the stern Secret Service man in each aisle.
Credibility
While he stated, "Our power has never been
used to destroy freedom or peace," you
thought of a great nationalist leader in
Vietnam, who incorporated the beginning of
our constitution into his country's own and
then witnessed his dream and country
destroyed by our power.
While he spoke of equality you asked
yourself "Why aren't there more black people
here?" and then you remembered that they
were outside in tattered overalls selling
newspapers.
Richard Nixon was impressive. You wanted
to be able to leap up at the end of his speech
with the Murphy girls and scream and yell,
sincerely believing the things were right in this
country. But you couldn't.

NIXON ADDRESS â€” President Nixon spoke to a crowd of 5 000 Republicans last
night in the San Jose Civic Auditorium. He declared his support for California
GOP candidates and defended his domestic and international record.
It was the Woodstock of Middle America,
and the whole "silent-majority-good-decent
people" culture had turned out to hear their
heroes tell them what they wanted to hear.
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George
Murphy had come to speak in San Jose.
Little old ladies were there, dressed as if
they were going to church on Sunday, except
for the Reagan-Reinecke buttons on their
lapels. Middle-aged men were there, puffing on
their cigars, and talking about work and the
most recent maintenance job on their cars.
Middle aged women were there, dressed as if
on their way to a PTA tea, occasionally picking
up their children, restless from the long stand
outside to get into the auditorium.
Finally young people were there, their hair
cut short, though with occasional long
sideburns, the acne barely visible on their faces,
and all looking as if they had played in the high
school band and been Boy Scouts.
No Disappointment
They had all come to hear the President of
the United States speak to them, reassure them,
tell them that they were the good people that
had made America great and that America was
great.
This is what they had come to hear, and
they were not to be disappointed.
Their Woodstock was not a music festival at
which Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin and some
good dope took their minds to places they had
never been before. No, their Woodstock was a
political rally at which Ronald Reagan and
Richard Nixon and a white middle classness
reassured them that they were part of the
greatest nation in the history of man, and that
they were good people.
As the mass of people outside was allowed
to enter the auditorium, it was greeted by a
strange mixture of cute high school "Murphy
girls" and stern-faced Secret Service agents.
Murphy's Girls
The girls wore short blue skirts, white
blouses with a blue Murphy banner across them
and broad smiles. They were the type of girls

that made cheerleaders and baton twirlers, the
type of girl you wanted to marry in eighth
grade.
"Why are you for Murphy?" I asked one.
"That's a good question," she replied
shrugging her shoulders.
I don't know," replied another, "I guess
because both my parents are Democrats." She
burst into giggles and put her white gloved hand
over her mouth and blushed.
Then you looked at the Secret Service men
interspersed among them, glaring at everyone
with suspicion. Suddenly you were brought out
of your dream world and you realized that
there was another side to America.
Republicanism
As the speeches began, patriotism,
Republicanism, quotes from Ben Franklin and
Abraham Lincoln were tossed around like
obscenities in an Andy Warhol flick.
Although the audience sounded enthusiastic,
you knew they were waiting for the final set for
which most of them had come. When Nixon
finally strode onto the stage the auditorium
exploded into cheers and you knew at once
they believed in him and he in them. There was
an empathy between the man on stage and the
audience that had seldom if ever been exceeded
in the best sets at the Fillmore.
They were his type of people and he was
their type of man, and you could feel the
understanding between President and people.
You had to feel it, even if you couldn't feel
part of it.
And he gave them what they wanted.

up their children, restless from the long stand
outside to get into the auditorium.
Finally young people were there, their hair
cut short, though with occasional long
sideburns, the acne barely visible on their faces,
and all looking as if they had played in the high
school band and been Boy Scouts.
No Disappointment
They had all come to hear the President of
the United States speak to them, reassure them,
tell them that they were the good people that
had made America great and that America was
great.
This is what they had come to hear, and
they were not to be disappointed.
Their Woodstock was not a music festival at
which Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin and some
good dope took their minds to places they had
never been before. No, their Woodstock was a
political rally at which Ronald Reagan and
Richard Nixon and a white middle classness
reassured them that they were part of the
greatest nation in the history of man, and that
they were good people.
As the mass of people outside was allowed
to enter the auditorium, it was greeted by a
strange mixture of cute high school "Murphy
girls" and stern-faced Secret Service agents.
Murphy's Girls
The girls wore short blue skirts, white
blouses with a blue Murphy banner across them
and broad smiles. They were the type of girls

that made cheerleaders and baton twirlers, the
type of girl you wanted to marry in eighth
grade.
"Why are you for Murphy?" I asked one.
"That's a good question," she replied
shrugging her shoulders.
I don't know," replied another, "I guess
because both my parents are Democrats." She
burst into giggles and put her white gloved hand
over her mouth and blushed.
Then you looked at the Secret Service men
interspersed among them, glaring at everyone
with suspicion. Suddenly you were brought out
of your dream world and you realized that
there was another side to America.
Republicanism
As the speeches began, patriotism,
Republicanism, quotes from Ben Franklin and
Abraham Lincoln were tossed around like
obscenities in an Andy Warhol flick.
Although the audience sounded enthusiastic,
you knew they were waiting for the final set for
which most of them had come. When Nixon
finally strode onto the stage the auditorium
exploded into cheers and you knew at once
they believed in him and he in them. There was
an empathy between the man on stage and the
audience that had seldom if ever been exceeded
in the best sets at the Fillmore.
They were his type of people and he was
their type of man, and you could feel the
understanding between President and people.
You had to feel it, even if you couldn't feel
part of it.
And he gave them what they wanted.
'Honorable Peace'
He talked about peace abroad, an
"honorable peace," a peace which will make it
possible that "those who shout obscene slogans
at home against the war will never be needed to
fight in another one."
He talked about peace at home, telling the
audience about the 158 percent rise in crime in
the past eight years, and of burned banks, and
anarchy, and that it had to end.
He talked about the 900 demonstrators

outside shouting obscenities, but that he had
faith in America, that he knew "the violent
radical few will not be the leaders of America's
future."
The crowd gave him a standing ovation. You
had to be impressed.
The most powerful man in the world had
understood them. The President of the United
States had told them they were right, that they
constituted what was good and decent in
America, and that they would not be defeated.
They felt reassured.
'He's the Greatest'
"He was beautiful!" exclaimed one Murphy
girl practically in tears.
"He was great!" screeched another.
"He's the greatest man in the whole world!"
sighed a third.
You wish you could have agreed with them.
You wish that you too could have believed
in him and been able to cheer for him.
Yet while he spoke of freedom, you looked
at the stern Secret Service man in each aisle.
Credibility
While he stated, "Our power has never been
used to destroy freedom or peace," you
thought of a great nationalist leader in
Vietnam, who incorporated the beginning of
our constitution into his country's own and
then witnessed his dream and country
destroyed by our power.
While he spoke of equality you asked
yourself "Why aren't there more black people
here?" and then you remembered that they
were outside in tattered overalls selling
newspapers.
Richard Nixon was impressive. You wanted
to be able to leap up at the end of his speech
with the Murphy girls and scream and yell,
sincerely believing the things were right in this
country. But you couldn't.

NIXON ADDRESS â€” President Nixon spoke to a crowd of 5 000 Republicans last
night in the San Jose Civic Auditorium. He declared his support for California
GOP candidates and defended his domestic and international record.
It was the Woodstock of Middle America,
and the whole "silent-majority-good-decent
people" culture had turned out to hear their
heroes tell them what they wanted to hear.
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George
Murphy had come to speak in San Jose.
Little old ladies were there, dressed as if
they were going to church on Sunday, except
for the Reagan-Reinecke buttons on their
lapels. Middle-aged men were there, puffing on
their cigars, and talking about work and the
most recent maintenance job on their cars.
