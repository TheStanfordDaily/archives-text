President Nixon issued the following statement last night as he flew
from the San Jose rally to his home in San Clemente:
"The stoning at San Jose is an example of the viciousness of the lawless
elements in our society.
'This was no outburst by a single individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst in America.
"I have been careful to point out that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important that all Americans keep this perspective. But the time
has come to take the gloves off and speak to this kind of behavior in a
forthright way. Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly cannot exist
when people who peacefully attend rallies are attacked with flying rocks.
"I will discuss what America must do to end the wave of violence and
terrorism by the radical, antidemocratic element in our society."
