# 'Arena' To Charge Election Foul-Up
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Arena co-editor Chris Hocker today
accused ASSU Elections Commissioner
Chris Banks of "inexperience,
carelessness, or just plain
incompetence," and blamed him for
the election irregularities which forced
the postponement this month of the
ASSU Senate elections.
The accusation will appear next
week in the Arena.
When contacted late last night by
the Daily, Banks stated, "It is pretty
obvious to me that all his accusations
are absurd and completely false.
Clearly, carelessness, inexperience and
just plain incompetence cannot be
judged by one who has shown these
same qualities he charges me with.
"As to inexperience, the only way
to alleviate that is to elect the
incumbent elections commissioner.
Where the hell do you get prior
experience otherwise?
"As far as I'm concerned," Banks

declared, "Hocker's accusations are just
irresponsible slurs and Agnewisms.
That's all there is to it."
Allegation
Originally, the article suggested that
the Black Student Union (BSU) had
arranged the irregularities in an attempt
to improve the chances of BSU
candidates.
After a half-hour conversation with
Banks last night, however, Hocker
issued a statement which read: "I am
now convinced that the postponement
of the elections was not done with the
purpose to aid the political fortunes of
the BSU.
"However, I maintain that most of
the election irregularities that I have
pointed out could have been prevented
by Banks. I further maintain that
Banks' appointment was the result of a
political power play by certain
members of last year's ASSU Senate."
The Arena was slated for release
yesterday, but publication was delayed

after Mocker's co-editor, Buzz
Thompson, objected to "implications
that couldn't be proved—the Joe
McCarthy type of shit." When the
newspaper comes out, Thompson said,
the Hocker article will have been
radically revised.
Irregularities
After detailing the election's
irregularities—students voting outside
their constituencies, misspelled names
on the ballot, misplaced names, and
illegal electioneering near the polls—the
article (in its original form) declared,
"This catalogue of election
irregularities, clearly the fault of Banks
or his agents, can be chalked up to
inexperience, carelessness, or just plain
incompetence. It strains one's
credulity, however, to believe that all
those mistakes were made innocently,
especially in the* light of another piece
of information.
The "piece of information" referred
to is the disclosure by Hocker that the
HSU had planned to run a full-page

advertisement for its Senate slate in the
Daily on Wednesday, October 14, the
first day of elections.
Under circumstances which are
disputed, the ad did not appear in that
issue. Thus, according to the original
Arena article, "the BSU would have
benefited from a postponement of the
elections after Wednesday ... The
BSU-supported slate had no difficulty
in generating new momentum through
new forms of publicity, while other
slates and individuals were definitely
unprepared for the postponement of
the elections."
Doug McHenry, who wrote the ad,
reacted immediately to Mocker's
allegations. "That's completely
asinine," he told the Daily last night.
"What's so sad is that dogmatic people
don't talk to us directly—they make
accusations instead of talking to us man
to man, instead of being
honest. .. accusations mean nothing,
but they do have a bearing on public
opinion, and it's really sad."

Clearly, carelessness, inexperience and
just plain incompetence cannot be
judged by one who has shown these
same qualities he charges me with.
"As to inexperience, the only way
to alleviate that is to elect the
incumbent elections commissioner.
Where the hell do you get prior
experience otherwise?
"As far as I'm concerned," Banks

declared, "Hocker's accusations are just
irresponsible slurs and Agnewisms.
That's all there is to it."
Allegation
Originally, the article suggested that
the Black Student Union (BSU) had
arranged the irregularities in an attempt
to improve the chances of BSU
candidates.
After a half-hour conversation with
Banks last night, however, Hocker
issued a statement which read: "I am
now convinced that the postponement
of the elections was not done with the
purpose to aid the political fortunes of
the BSU.
"However, I maintain that most of
the election irregularities that I have
pointed out could have been prevented
by Banks. I further maintain that
Banks' appointment was the result of a
political power play by certain
members of last year's ASSU Senate."
The Arena was slated for release
yesterday, but publication was delayed

after Mocker's co-editor, Buzz
Thompson, objected to "implications
that couldn't be proved—the Joe
McCarthy type of shit." When the
newspaper comes out, Thompson said,
the Hocker article will have been
radically revised.
Irregularities
After detailing the election's
irregularities—students voting outside
their constituencies, misspelled names
on the ballot, misplaced names, and
illegal electioneering near the polls—the
article (in its original form) declared,
"This catalogue of election
irregularities, clearly the fault of Banks
or his agents, can be chalked up to
inexperience, carelessness, or just plain
incompetence. It strains one's
credulity, however, to believe that all
those mistakes were made innocently,
especially in the* light of another piece
of information.
The "piece of information" referred
to is the disclosure by Hocker that the
HSU had planned to run a full-page

advertisement for its Senate slate in the
Daily on Wednesday, October 14, the
first day of elections.
Under circumstances which are
disputed, the ad did not appear in that
issue. Thus, according to the original
Arena article, "the BSU would have
benefited from a postponement of the
elections after Wednesday ... The
BSU-supported slate had no difficulty
in generating new momentum through
new forms of publicity, while other
slates and individuals were definitely
unprepared for the postponement of
the elections."
Doug McHenry, who wrote the ad,
reacted immediately to Mocker's
allegations. "That's completely
asinine," he told the Daily last night.
"What's so sad is that dogmatic people
don't talk to us directly—they make
accusations instead of talking to us man
to man, instead of being
honest. .. accusations mean nothing,
but they do have a bearing on public
opinion, and it's really sad."
Arena co-editor Chris Hocker today
accused ASSU Elections Commissioner
Chris Banks of "inexperience,
carelessness, or just plain
incompetence," and blamed him for
the election irregularities which forced
the postponement this month of the
ASSU Senate elections.
The accusation will appear next
week in the Arena.
When contacted late last night by
the Daily, Banks stated, "It is pretty
obvious to me that all his accusations
are absurd and completely false.
Clearly, carelessness, inexperience and
just plain incompetence cannot be
judged by one who has shown these
same qualities he charges me with.
