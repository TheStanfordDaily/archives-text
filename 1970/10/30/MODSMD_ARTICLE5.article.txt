## Right To Vote=Political Myth 
###

It is an accepted American
political myth, propagated by
civics classes, that the electoral
system is a neutral institution
which achieves a concensus of
various group interests. The
electoral procedure has in itself
become a supreme value; the
alternatives, we are taught, are
always so heinous that this
procedure must be accepted at all
cost.
A more reasonable approach
would be to begin with certain
moral values such as justice,
freedom and equality. In a nation
where one percent of its citizens,
owning eighty percent of the
corporate stock, are in control of
an industrial system which
promotes foreign imperialism and
wage slavery at home, our values
are not presently being
implemented. This article will
look at how elections are won and
the power of elected officials and
ask — is there any possibility for
significant change within the
framework of the existing
electoral process?
The nature , of today's
campaigns is such that candidates
are sold like merchandise. The
main concern of the campaign
manager is how his goods are to
be packaged and sold to the
public. Of the $25,000,000 spent
on the 1 968 Nixon campaign,
forty percent was spent on
television alone. It should be
obvious from the effectiveness of
thirty second spot TV ads that
elections are a conflict of created
images rather than of ideas and
issues. Certainly those with the
finances to promote a selling
image through the mass media will
be at an overpowering advantage.
Furthermore, mass media are large
corporate institutions themselves
and are able to decide on which
advertising to accept as well as
controlling basic information flow
to the public.
Can those whose finances
control the campaigns be
interested in changes which will
challenge the basis for their
wealth? The $300,000,000 that
was spent on campaigns in 1968
came mainly from corporations
and a few wealthy individuals not
from thousands of small
contributors.
According to the Corrupt
Practices Act of 1925, it is illegal
for any corporation to make afiy
expenditure to assist a political
candidate. But in practice,
corporations are able to
circumvent this act by such
methods as providing services in
kind (use of equipment and
personnel) and giving their
executives bonuses with the
understanding that they will use
the money to make contributions
as individuals. No major U.S.
corporation has been convicted
under this act. Elections, then, are
controlled by the very institutions
they are supposed to regulate.
Liberal View
It is the view of the liberal that
since the individual has the right
to vote and to free speech in
persuading others to accept his
view, he should abide by the
results of the election regardless
of its consequences. But these
rights are like the right of every

individual to begin his own
corporation. The liberal ignores
the pervasive forces of corporate
capitalism which undermines the
meaning of these rights. The
procedural rights apply equally,
but they merely serve to reinforce
the existing inequality.
The second structural
limitation to elections is their
inherent inability to make
profound changes in control of
power. The liberal assumes that
our problems can be solved by
electing good men to office. But
even if a candidate is somehow
not beholden to the financial
interests which elected him, what
can he do? The executive
bureaucracies and corporate
lobbies control much of the
information flow to Congress, the
form that the debate will take,
and the enforcement of the laws.
A certain amount of
"responsible" dissent is allowed as
long as it is not threatening to
change the nature of the system.
In 1919, for example, the
Socialist Party of America had
elected candidates to Congress
and various state assemblies and
was on the verge of considerable
political success.
Radical Change Impossible
But the elected candidates
were denied their seats, immigrant
leaders were deported, many
party members were jailed, and
their newspapers denied mailing
priviledges. A similar ruling class
reaction is taking place ',oday
against the Black Panther Party.
Radical change will simply not be
allowed within the electoral
system.

Although the prospects of a
third party, such as the Peace and
Freedom Party, for promoting
change through "legitimate"
means is small, it has a certain
value in expressing symbolic
discontent and encouraging
participation only in election
time, tends to dilute radical
programs to attain a maximum
number of votes, creates reliance
on charismatic heroes, and
promotes thinking in terms of
issues defined by the two major
parties.
In view of these structural
roadblocks to achieving our values
within the electoral system, we
must find other directions for our
effort. Effective action can only
take place through direct
organizing of the people around
issues of concern to them. In
certain local cases this may done
through elections but in general,
we cannot use "legitimate"
methods as defined by the ruling
establishment. We must make our
own definitions.
Extra-Electoral Reform
In the past, the people were
able to use confrontation tactics
and civil disobedience as an
effective extra-electoral means to
reforms. Worker occupation of
factories in the 1930 *s was
instrumental in obtaining reform
in the labor laws such as those
implemented in the Wagner Act.
Martin Luther King style sit-ins
helped to bring about civil rights
legislation.
However, in every case it was
the power elite who were able to
finance long run studies to
determine the type of reform that

they wished to instigate. The
result was to co-opt the
discontent and preserve their well
functioning system. The Wagner
Act, for example, allowed reforms
sufficient to contain the radical
nature of the worker programs
without giving them what they
actually wanted — control of their
companies.
The organizational activity that
has been complied to appeal to
the established power bases must
now establish itself as an
independent source of power.
Confrontations have helped to
bring similarly situated people
together and to raise their
consciousness of the character of
the ruling class, the nature of their
oppression and the potential
power of their organized activity.
What is needed is to translate this
into organizations that are able to
impose effective sanctions. By not
operating within the limits
defined by the ruling class or
alligning themselves with ruling
class 'institutions, the
organizations can avoid the danger
of co-optation through small
reforms and are able to work on
problems which they decide are
important. Activity in election
time should be geared to show the
people how the right to vote does
not give the people control of the
institutions that presently rule
them.
