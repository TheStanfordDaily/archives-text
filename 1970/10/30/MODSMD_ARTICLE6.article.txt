Comrad!
Those students having
identification pictures taken are
advised to fully take advantage of
the inspection offer. Take care
especially to look inside for beam
splitters and auxilliary lenses
relaying an image into a subsidiary
internal box, perhaps 15 x 10 cm
on side, 3-4 cm. thick, removeably
mounted. This would be a 16 mm
film magazine, keeping a record of
every photo made, as well as a
microimage along the sound track
edge of alphanumeric data on the
card. This of course is not a
Poloroid film, not available at
once, requiring later development.
It is a standard attachment for
photographc apparatus of this
type, and keep checking, it could
be installed at any time once the
initial line and cry dies down.
Anton Ecthelion
University Lighting
Editor, THE DAILY:
The University has spent some
$260,000 to date on security
lighting systems for the obvious

protection of one and all in the
community. I for one applaud
such action, and had even
requested it upon several
occasions for years. However, the
further indistinct area has come to
my attention.
Another lighting venture
should be undertaken with some
celerity. I have sat through classes
in Cubberley Auditorium for
years. Traditionally large courses
have been housed there, and much
to my consternation without
sufficient lighting for either
note-taking or blackboard-seeing.
It would, therefore, seem to me
altogether appropriate that
Stanford could redirect a few of
those dollars going to illuminate
either the parking lots or the
outside lawn of Encina inward
onto our refulgent lecturers.
Do we need a petition on this
sort of common-sense request or
could we agree to have this done
as quickly as possible? This letter
was not Intended to cast a shadow
upon anyone in authority, but as
our Vice President might put it to
gain new sight into the latent
lambency of learning.
Stephen Otto

Sheriff's Race
Editor, The DAILY:
I was greatly interested by
your front-page story in Monday's
Daily entitled Election Politics
Yields to Apathy. 1 hope that my
total opposition to the "election
recess" does not disqualify me
from offering some observations
on the uses (if any) to which this
recess will be put. The Movement
for a New Congress (MNC) ought
not to be allowed to monopolize
the attention of those stUdents
who wish to participate in the
political process.
Peace in Vietnam is not the
only issue that faces voters next
Tuesday. Right here in Santa
Clara County there is a race which
matters more to this University
than any other of which I am
aware. The voters must choose a
new sheriff. Sam della Maggiore is
an exponent of Agnewism as it
affects society's relationship with
universities. His opponent, James
Geary, has demonstrated himself
by words and deeds alike to be a
man who thinks that the police
should never intervene on campus
until a duly authorized University

officer summons them.
I support James Geary as most
of my neighbors do. His campaign
needs all the help it can get during
the next few days. Remember
that charity begins at home.
Faithfully,
Herbert L. Packer

Do we need a petition on this
sort of common-sense request or

as quickly as possible? This letter

gain new sight into the latent
lambency of learning.

Sheriff's Race
Editor, The DAILY:
I was greatly interested by
your front-page story in Monday's
Daily entitled Election Politics
Yields to Apathy. 1 hope that my
total opposition to the "election
recess" does not disqualify me
from offering some observations
on the uses (if any) to which this
recess will be put. The Movement
for a New Congress (MNC) ought
not to be allowed to monopolize
the attention of those stUdents
who wish to participate in the
political process.
Peace in Vietnam is not the
only issue that faces voters next
Tuesday. Right here in Santa
Clara County there is a race which
matters more to this University
than any other of which I am
aware. The voters must choose a
new sheriff. Sam della Maggiore is
an exponent of Agnewism as it
affects society's relationship with
universities. His opponent, James
Geary, has demonstrated himself
by words and deeds alike to be a
man who thinks that the police
should never intervene on campus
until a duly authorized University

officer summons them.
I support James Geary as most
of my neighbors do. His campaign
needs all the help it can get during
the next few days. Remember
that charity begins at home.
Faithfully,
Herbert L. Packer
Professor of Law

Comrad!
Those students having
identification pictures taken are
advised to fully take advantage of
the inspection offer. Take care
especially to look inside for beam
splitters and auxilliary lenses
relaying an image into a subsidiary
internal box, perhaps 15 x 10 cm
on side, 3-4 cm. thick, removeably
mounted. This would be a 16 mm
film magazine, keeping a record of
every photo made, as well as a
microimage along the sound track
edge of alphanumeric data on the
card. This of course is not a
Poloroid film, not available at
once, requiring later development.
It is a standard attachment for
photographc apparatus of this
type, and keep checking, it could
be installed at any time once the
initial line and cry dies down.

University Lighting
Editor, THE DAILY:
The University has spent some
$260,000 to date on security
lighting systems for the obvious

protection of one and all in the
community. I for one applaud
such action, and had even
requested it upon several
occasions for years. However, the
further indistinct area has come to
my attention.
Another lighting venture
should be undertaken with some
celerity. I have sat through classes
in Cubberley Auditorium for
years. Traditionally large courses
have been housed there, and much
to my consternation without
sufficient lighting for either
note-taking or blackboard-seeing.
It would, therefore, seem to me
altogether appropriate that
Stanford could redirect a few of
those dollars going to illuminate
either the parking lots or the
outside lawn of Encina inward
onto our refulgent lecturers.
Do we need a petition on this
sort of common-sense request or
