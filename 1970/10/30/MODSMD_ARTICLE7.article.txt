## Ecology And Exploitation

The American public is now
almost totally apathetic with
regard to environmental problems.
Everybody has picked out a
scapegoat. A neighbor says that
pollution is caused by Big
Business failing to clean up its
mess. GM says it cannot provide
what isn't demanded, so that
consumers who want a clean
environment are going to have to
pay for it.
This merry-go-round illustrates
a dilemma in American thinking
that traces to our founding
fathers. Paul Ehrlich put it very
nicely the other night at the Full
Circle: the Constitution defines all
of the freedoms but none of the
duties. It was written by a group
of men defining what life could be
when you are hanging onto the
edge of a great unknown.

And now the Great Unknown
has been stolen from the natives,
crossed and recrossed, urbanized,
industrialized, strip mined, logged,
looted, paved over, raped beyond
recognition, and is now looking
like a cloud of smog over a
monstrous dump full of cesspools
and poisoned rivers. But we are a
gree people, and it's still up to
somebody else to clean up.
Technology's Answer
Technology now holds out the
rich carrot before the donkey
nose of the American public: we
can clean up everything, and we
will. Recycle your beer cans,
folks. Use unleaded gass and
biodegradable toilet paper.
Moreover, say the
technologists, we shall soon pull
up the whole world with out

science, for the underdeveloped
countries (UDC's) are soon going
to be at our level of affluence.
Buckminster Fuller, Prince of
Technologists, says within 10
years. Moreover, they will do a
better job of it, since they can
profit by our mistakes.
This, of course, is the most
polluted sop ever thrown by the
technocrats. What it signals is that
this country can and will continue
hell-bent on a suicidal course of
technological expansion,
industrial development, and
leaping GNP's. Until someone
really does clean up ... on us.
The fact is that American
affluence and technology exists
and can only exist in a
downtrodden world. When and if
the UDC's, we will be in big
trouble. Not just because we now

survive on their resources—our
own being near depletion. But
because there just aren't enough
goodies to go round.
World Development
Consider what world
development would require—let us
say for the whole planet to be
raised to our level of affluence.
Everybody would have to produce
as much as we produce, per
capita. Moreover, since we have
decades of development behind
us, they would have to produce
more, per capita, to arrive where
we are now.
Ehrlich has described what this
means in Population Resources,
Environment. To raise the 3.6
billion people on this planet to
our standard of living would entail
the extraction of 75 times as
much iron as is now extracted
annually throughout the world,
75 times as much zinc, 100 times
as much copper, 200 times as
much lead, and 25 0 times as much
tin. On the basis of the slippery
state of world resources at the
moment, Ehrlich concludes that
the UDC's ought to be redefined
as the Never-to-be-Developed
countries.
World industrialization is
clearly impossible. The
ecosystems cannot support our
standard for everyone. What is
apparent is that we are living at a
level of consumption that is
nothing short of obscene. We live
at a level impossible for everyone
by an insidious pattern of
exploitation—living off the fat of
the planet while a half billion
people are chronically
undernourished and 10 to 20
million deaths each year are the
direct result of malnutrition or
starvation!
Starvation
Yes, damn it—STARVATION
rips off up to one-third of all the

people every day, while we gobble
our double helpings, stuff
ourselves with cream pies and
buttertarts, drink half the world's
beer, and are so fat we can afford
to eat no-calorie pop and
non-nutritional bread.
Some day, of course the
exploited ones will wake up and
march. Somebody, some day
soon, is going to out-Mao even
Mao by saying what is completely
obvious: that the American- im
perial-capitalist-exploiter has to
die, be obliterated, bombed all the
way to hell—if the other 94h of
the world's people are ever going
to make it.
I'd like to think this is just a
scenario, or a bad dream.
Unfortunately, I think it will be a
fact very, very soon.
Into Oblivion
For, if I were one of the
exploited, with no share in the
goodies and no chance of ever
sharing them, hungry, sick,
underclothed and underprivileged,
scratching for survival in the face
of American affluence, turning
even more sick from American
poison — I would seriously
consider blowing it to oblivion.
Or, if I were a poor white or a
poor black, an Indian with only a
reservation in the desert, a
drop-out unable to buy into wall
street, looking down the century
at the deteriorating hopes of me
and my kind, watching the beauty
and the hope withering away in
America, the thought of blowing
it to bits mught just cross my
mind occasionally.
That might go a long way
towards explaining why, in fact,
things do occasionally get blown
up. But more and more these
days.

standard for everyone. What is
apparent is that we are living at a

nothing short of obscene. We live
at a level impossible for everyone
by an insidious pattern of
exploitation—living off the fat of
the planet while a half billion
people are chronically
undernourished and 10 to 20
million deaths each year are the
direct result of malnutrition or
starvation!
Starvation
Yes, damn it—STARVATION
rips off up to one-third of all the

people every day, while we gobble
our double helpings, stuff
ourselves with cream pies and
buttertarts, drink half the world's
beer, and are so fat we can afford
to eat no-calorie pop and
non-nutritional bread.
Some day, of course the
exploited ones will wake up and
march. Somebody, some day
soon, is going to out-Mao even
Mao by saying what is completely
obvious: that the American- im
perial-capitalist-exploiter has to
die, be obliterated, bombed all the
way to hell—if the other 94h of
the world's people are ever going
to make it.
I'd like to think this is just a
scenario, or a bad dream.
Unfortunately, I think it will be a
fact very, very soon.
Into Oblivion
For, if I were one of the
exploited, with no share in the
goodies and no chance of ever
sharing them, hungry, sick,
underclothed and underprivileged,
scratching for survival in the face
of American affluence, turning
even more sick from American
poison — I would seriously
consider blowing it to oblivion.
Or, if I were a poor white or a
poor black, an Indian with only a
reservation in the desert, a
drop-out unable to buy into wall
street, looking down the century
at the deteriorating hopes of me
and my kind, watching the beauty
and the hope withering away in
America, the thought of blowing
it to bits mught just cross my
mind occasionally.
That might go a long way
towards explaining why, in fact,
things do occasionally get blown
up. But more and more these
days.

The American public is now
almost totally apathetic with
regard to environmental problems.
Everybody has picked out a
scapegoat. A neighbor says that
pollution is caused by Big
Business failing to clean up its
mess. GM says it cannot provide
what isn't demanded, so that
consumers who want a clean
environment are going to have to
pay for it.
This merry-go-round illustrates
a dilemma in American thinking
that traces to our founding
fathers. Paul Ehrlich put it very
nicely the other night at the Full
Circle: the Constitution defines all
of the freedoms but none of the
duties. It was written by a group
of men defining what life could be
when you are hanging onto the
edge of a great unknown.

And now the Great Unknown
has been stolen from the natives,
crossed and recrossed, urbanized,
industrialized, strip mined, logged,
looted, paved over, raped beyond
recognition, and is now looking
like a cloud of smog over a
monstrous dump full of cesspools
and poisoned rivers. But we are a
gree people, and it's still up to
somebody else to clean up.
Technology's Answer
Technology now holds out the
rich carrot before the donkey
nose of the American public: we
can clean up everything, and we
will. Recycle your beer cans,
folks. Use unleaded gass and
biodegradable toilet paper.
Moreover, say the
technologists, we shall soon pull
up the whole world with out

science, for the underdeveloped
countries (UDC's) are soon going
to be at our level of affluence.
Buckminster Fuller, Prince of
Technologists, says within 10
years. Moreover, they will do a
better job of it, since they can
profit by our mistakes.
This, of course, is the most
polluted sop ever thrown by the
technocrats. What it signals is that
this country can and will continue
hell-bent on a suicidal course of
technological expansion,
industrial development, and
leaping GNP's. Until someone
really does clean up ... on us.
The fact is that American
affluence and technology exists
and can only exist in a
downtrodden world. When and if
the UDC's, we will be in big
trouble. Not just because we now

survive on their resources—our
own being near depletion. But
because there just aren't enough
goodies to go round.
World Development
Consider what world
development would require—let us
say for the whole planet to be
raised to our level of affluence.
Everybody would have to produce
as much as we produce, per
capita. Moreover, since we have
decades of development behind
us, they would have to produce
more, per capita, to arrive where
we are now.
Ehrlich has described what this
means in Population Resources,
Environment. To raise the 3.6
billion people on this planet to
our standard of living would entail
the extraction of 75 times as
much iron as is now extracted
annually throughout the world,
75 times as much zinc, 100 times
as much copper, 200 times as
much lead, and 25 0 times as much
tin. On the basis of the slippery
state of world resources at the
moment, Ehrlich concludes that
the UDC's ought to be redefined
as the Never-to-be-Developed
countries.
World industrialization is
clearly impossible. The
ecosystems cannot support our
standard for everyone. What is
apparent is that we are living at a
level of consumption that is
nothing short of obscene. We live
at a level impossible for everyone
by an insidious pattern of

nose of the American public: we
can clean up everything, and we
will. Recycle your beer cans,
folks. Use unleaded gass and
biodegradable toilet paper.
Moreover, say the
technologists, we shall soon pull
up the whole world with out

science, for the underdeveloped
countries (UDC's) are soon going
to be at our level of affluence.
Buckminster Fuller, Prince of
Technologists, says within 10
years. Moreover, they will do a
better job of it, since they can
profit by our mistakes.
This, of course, is the most
polluted sop ever thrown by the
technocrats. What it signals is that
this country can and will continue
hell-bent on a suicidal course of
technological expansion,
industrial development, and
leaping GNP's. Until someone
really does clean up ... on us.
The fact is that American
affluence and technology exists
and can only exist in a
downtrodden world. When and if
the UDC's, we will be in big
trouble. Not just because we now

survive on their resources—our
own being near depletion. But
because there just aren't enough
goodies to go round.
World Development
Consider what world
development would require—let us
say for the whole planet to be
raised to our level of affluence.
Everybody would have to produce
as much as we produce, per
capita. Moreover, since we have
decades of development behind
us, they would have to produce
more, per capita, to arrive where
we are now.
Ehrlich has described what this
means in Population Resources,
Environment. To raise the 3.6
billion people on this planet to
our standard of living would entail
the extraction of 75 times as
much iron as is now extracted
annually throughout the world,
75 times as much zinc, 100 times
as much copper, 200 times as
much lead, and 25 0 times as much
tin. On the basis of the slippery
state of world resources at the
moment, Ehrlich concludes that
the UDC's ought to be redefined
as the Never-to-be-Developed
countries.
World industrialization is
clearly impossible. The
ecosystems cannot support our
standard for everyone. What is
apparent is that we are living at a
level of consumption that is
nothing short of obscene. We live
at a level impossible for everyone
by an insidious pattern of
exploitation—living off the fat of
the planet while a half billion
people are chronically
undernourished and 10 to 20
million deaths each year are the
direct result of malnutrition or
starvation!
Starvation
Yes, damn it—STARVATION
rips off up to one-third of all the

people every day, while we gobble
our double helpings, stuff
ourselves with cream pies and
buttertarts, drink half the world's
beer, and are so fat we can afford
to eat no-calorie pop and
non-nutritional bread.
Some day, of course the
exploited ones will wake up and
march. Somebody, some day
soon, is going to out-Mao even
Mao by saying what is completely
obvious: that the American- im
perial-capitalist-exploiter has to
die, be obliterated, bombed all the
way to hell—if the other 94h of
the world's people are ever going
to make it.
I'd like to think this is just a
scenario, or a bad dream.
Unfortunately, I think it will be a
fact very, very soon.
Into Oblivion
For, if I were one of the
exploited, with no share in the
goodies and no chance of ever
sharing them, hungry, sick,
underclothed and underprivileged,
scratching for survival in the face
of American affluence, turning
even more sick from American
poison — I would seriously
consider blowing it to oblivion.
Or, if I were a poor white or a
poor black, an Indian with only a
reservation in the desert, a
drop-out unable to buy into wall
street, looking down the century
at the deteriorating hopes of me
and my kind, watching the beauty
and the hope withering away in
America, the thought of blowing
it to bits mught just cross my
mind occasionally.
That might go a long way
towards explaining why, in fact,
things do occasionally get blown
up. But more and more these
days.

The American public is now
almost totally apathetic with
regard to environmental problems.
Everybody has picked out a
scapegoat. A neighbor says that
pollution is caused by Big
Business failing to clean up its
mess. GM says it cannot provide
what isn't demanded, so that
consumers who want a clean
environment are going to have to
pay for it.
This merry-go-round illustrates
a dilemma in American thinking
that traces to our founding
fathers. Paul Ehrlich put it very
nicely the other night at the Full
Circle: the Constitution defines all
of the freedoms but none of the
duties. It was written by a group
of men defining what life could be
when you are hanging onto the
edge of a great unknown.

And now the Great Unknown
has been stolen from the natives,
crossed and recrossed, urbanized,
industrialized, strip mined, logged,
looted, paved over, raped beyond
recognition, and is now looking
like a cloud of smog over a
monstrous dump full of cesspools
and poisoned rivers. But we are a
gree people, and it's still up to
somebody else to clean up.
