## GM's Path Of Havoc 
###

The auto workers' strike against General Motors
is now in its 45 th day and has just passed a crucial
stage. Over the weekend, the UAW convened
membership meetings in Detroit and voted
"overwhelmingly" to increase the dues of working
members of the union to bolster their rapidly
depleting strike fund. Indications from all sources
willing to say, is that this is going to be a long,
hard strike.
When the UAW first targeted GM, its strike
fund was $120 million, largest in history.
Estimates now place it somewhere between $5 0
and $60 million, enough for about another four
weeks. The latest development is the union's plan
to mobilize campus support for the strikers,
primarily in the form of food collections. GM is
also looking for campus support in its own way
and the GM recruiter will be sniffing around the
campus tomorrow.
By directly controlling $27 billion worth of the
world's Gross National Product, (1M is the 18 th
largest country in the world and one of the largest
industrial corporations in history. As one of the
biggest beasts, of them all, its almost too easy to
attackâ€”you can hit from any direction: safety,
quality control, pollution, racism, profits, wages,
working conditions, and on and on.
A real challenge is to find an area in which GM
has not ruined, corrupted, polluted, deceived, or
destroyed. Although mainly a producer of
consumer goods, GM is the 10th largest defense
contractor. A bastion of the M-I complex pouring
out tank loaders, bomb parts, self-propelled
howitzers, artillery shell parts, cannons, torpedo
parts, and, of course, the notorious M-16 rifle.
Mind-blowers
Other, less obviously offensive aspects of the
GM operation are still mind-blowers. Seven years
ago, GM had excess profits so great it had
accumulated surplus liquid assets of $2.3 billion
and the Wall St. Journal chuckled that "GM was
saving up to buy the Federal government."
(Chuckle, chuckle). That much money could wipe
out the national housing crisis at a single blow and
still leave a nice chunk for air pollution. And these
were surplus assets.
On the matter of pollution, a Pacific Studies
Center report notes that GM claims to spend $20
million a year on pollution yet this is only 10
percent of their $250 million advertising budget
and represents only eight hours of sales. (GM
grosses $2.5 million an hour, every hour, 365 days
a year.)
"Tame GM"
In the area of comsumer protection and public
influence on GM, Ralph Nader's recent "Tame
GM" campaign was a positive first step. In terms
of gross receipts, GM is the fifth largest

government in the world, larger than West
Germany, Japan, or Canada. Asa result, it is more
than a monopoly. It is comparable to a foreign
government with unlimited political and economic
power.
The same men who run GM also run 14
financial different financial institutions (Chase
Manhatten Bank, etc.), 77 other corporate bodies
including U.S. Steel, Alcoa, Gulf, and Standard
Oil, and at least seven insurance companies (John
Hancock, Metropolitan). These men got and
maintain their power through the systematic
exploitation of workers and consumers and the
devastation of the environment, not only in the
U.S. but throughout the world.
Insurgent Movements
Finally, GM's racial policy at home matches its
foreign policy. The only African country with a
GM operation is South Africa and in 1 967 , then
Chairman Fred Donner said in the Detroit News
that "GM functions in its usual non-discriminatory
manner within the laws of the country." In the
last two years, strong insurgent movements have
grown within the UAW (League of Revolutionary
Black Workers in Detroit, and the Black Panther
Caucus in Fremont) whose programs include
stronger labor movement resistance to GMs racist
policies and exposing the methods by which GM
uses racism to divide and cripple any struggle
mounted against the corporate colossus.
The UAW is now engaged in such a struggle and
its effects are having and will continue to have
world-wide impact. The Stanford Labor Action
Group supports the auto workers in this strike.
