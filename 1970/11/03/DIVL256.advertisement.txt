A Study of Their Role in
College and University
Governance
by Karl J. McGrath
From a man who has spent
his career in seats of academic
power comes an enlightened
consideration of ways in which
students can be admitted to a
responsible share of that
power. Earl J. McGrath has
been university dean, pro
fessor, president, chancellor,
U.S. Commissioner of
Education under both Truman
and Eisenhower, consultant to
college presidents. His prac
tical suggestions may raise
academic eyebrows and
student spirits. Paper $2.45
