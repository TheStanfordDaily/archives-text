# In The Nation: Little Change Expected
## 
### ED KOHN 
Tens of millions of Americans are expected to go to
the polls today to vote in what has become one of the
most bitterly-contested and unusual off-year elections
in this nation's history.
Despite regional bitterness, born primarily of
invective and the unprecedented participation of the
President and the Vice President in local races, the
election is expected to produce no major upsets. The
President probably will not receive the majorities he so
strongly desires in the House and Senate, and he stands
to lose some strength in the governors' mansions.
Vice President Spiro Agnew visited over 30 states
campaigning for local and statewide candidates since
mid-September. And in an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping hard from coast to
coast for the past three weeks; he has been
campaigning so extensively that many observers have
speculated that he has temporarily given up the
day-to-day direction of the federal government.
Normally, the party in power loses between 30 and
40 House seats in an off-year election, and does not
gain substantial strength in the Senate, where slightly
more than one-third of the seats are up for election.
Earlier this year, however, President Nixon said his goal
for the Republican Party would be a gain of seven seats
in the Senate and about 30 seats in the House.
Most observers now predict that the President might
pick up a few seats in the House—no more than
five—but nothing like the dramatic show of force he
was looking for when he set his goals. And the
Republicans will not gain anywhere near seven seats in
the Senate; in fact, the President has revised his
estimate downward to two seats—and even that could
be an optimistic outlook.
Republican Money
Financially, the Republicans have enjoyed a
bountiful year; they have outspent the Democrats on a
nationwide basis about ten-to-one. Jess Unruh, the
Democratic candidate for the California governorship,
was so strapped for funds that he was unable to
purchase any television time for spot advertising, which
has become the backbone of many campaigns,
particularly on the East and West Coasts, until last
week. Incumbent governor Ronald Reagan, on the

other hand, began his campaign with a war-chest
estimated at $1.5 million.
Spiro Agnew is well on his way to becoming one of
the most spectacular and successful, fundraisers in the
history of either party. Since mid-September, he has
raised an estimated $3 5 million, bringing his total
fundraising value to over $5 million during the past six
months.
Issues have not played an overwhelming role in most
of the campaigns; rather, attention has been focused on
personalities and character quirks. The Republicans,
for the most part, have tried to attract support by

stressing "law and order." Both Nixon and Agnew have
used this theme extensively, Nixon talking about
domestic violence and Agnew attacking doves,
"radical-liberals" and leftists, and stressing that the
Democratic Party is now the party of the extreme
left-the "party of permissiveness." Republicans have
also utilized the volatile issue of drugs as well as the
leniency of the higher courts.
San Jose Incident
It is possible that the incident at San Jose Thursday
night will have a marked effect on the elections; it has
certainly provided ample fodder for the President's
campaign machinery and put the Democrats back on
the defensive. However, none of the polls released thus
far have been able to assess the impact of this
demonstration and the President's use of the publicity
surrounding it.
The Democrats have used the traditional issue of the
economy as the backbone of their campaign. They
have stressed the high rates of unemployment and
inflation and their effect on the working classes. The
Democrats seem to be successful in their efforts to
maintain close working ties with organized labor
despite President Nixon's attempt to woo support at a
Labor Day dinner and other official celebrations.
A few of the more interesting races, particularly in
the Senate and for the governorships:
In Connecticut, a three-way struggle continues

News Analysis

between Sen. Thomas Dodd (incumbent), Rev. Joe
Duffey, the national chairman of Americans for
Democratic Action, and Rep. Lowell Weicker Jr. No
one will call a winner.
Sen. Ed Muskie, in Maine, and Sen. Ted Kennedy, in
Massachusetts are well on their way to large victories;
both should win by at least 60 percent (landslide).
In Maryland, Vice President Agnew faces repeated
embarassment, as Gov. Marvin Mandel (D) is a shoo-in
for his first full term, and Sen. Joseph Tydings (D),
despite opposition from the National Rifle Association
and other large groups, should defeat J. Glenn Beall Jr.

Other congressional peace and "new priorities"
candidates are also finding fertile ground near the
nation's capital.
New York is the focus of attention for many East
Coast pollsters. At this point, Conservative Party
candidate James Buckley is leading, with Rep. Ottinger
and Sen. Goodell splitting the liberal vote. Nelson
Rockefeller is almost assured of a fourth term in office.
Hugh Scott (Senate minority leader), Harrison
Williams, John Pastore, and Robert Byrd are all safe
bets from their respective states.
THE MIDWEST
In Illinois, Adlai Stevenson 111 looks very strong,
despite Presidential campaigning for Ralph Smith, his
incumbent opponent.
The dirtiest race for a Senate seat is being fought in
Indiana, which is rated a toss-up between Sen. Vance
Hartke and Rep. Richard Roudebush. Roudebush has a
television spot purporting to show Hartke giving
American M-16 rifles to the Viet Cong (trading with
the enemy), while Hartke is questioning the number of
times that Roudebush has been married.
Hubert Humphrey is staging a successful political
comeback in Minnesota, where a landslide is predicted
over Clark McGregor.
Philip Hart, Roman Hruska ("mediocrity is no
vice"), William Proxmire and Stuart Symington are all
assured of returning to Washington in January.

In North Dakota, Quentin Burdick, one of the
liberals Nixon would most like to defeat, holds a slim
lead over Thomas Kleppe, while in Utah, another
Nixon target, Frank Moss, also seems to be holding up
despite heavy campaigning by the President and
members of his cabinet.
And in Ohio, the Senate race between Howard
Metzenbaum and Robert Taft Jr. is still a toss-up.
THE SOUTH
The President's "Southern Strategy" seems to be a
failure, as the following predictions indicate:
In Alabama, George Wallace, running for governor,
is looking for presidential momentum again. No doubt
he will find it.
Dale Bumpers, a moderate Democrat, should defeat
Winthrop Rockefeller for the Arkansas governorship.
The Democratic party seems to be rebuilding in
Arkansas.
In Florida, the Republicans thought a month ago
that they would win both the Senate seat and the
governor's mansion. Now, with the local party
machinery badly fractured, it looks like they will win
neither.
John Stennis and Harry Byrd Jr. are not likely to
lose.
And in the race around which the "Southern
Strategy" is based, Democrat Albert Gore is slowly
pulling away from Bill Brock 111, a hard-line Nixon
supporter in Tennessee. Still a close race, though.
THE WEST & SOUTHWEST
In Arizona Paul Fannin, an archconservative, will
have no problems in being reelected. Morris Udall, who
more or less led the House revolt against the
Democratic leadership, is also running a strong race.
Howard Cannon seems to have the upper edge over
William Raggio, a hand-picked Nixon man in Nevada.
Hiram Fong, Mike Mansfield, Joe Montoya, Henry
Jackson and Gale McGee all seem fairly safe in their
respective states.
And, at home in California, the question is not that
Ronald Reagan will be reelected as governor, but by
how much. John Tunney holds a slight edge over
George Murphy, but it's too close to call. Down on the
Farm, Charlie Gubser looks like he'll squeak by.

was looking for when he set his goals. And the
Republicans will not gain anywhere near seven seats in
the Senate; in fact, the President has revised his
estimate downward to two seats—and even that could
be an optimistic outlook.
Republican Money
Financially, the Republicans have enjoyed a
bountiful year; they have outspent the Democrats on a
nationwide basis about ten-to-one. Jess Unruh, the
Democratic candidate for the California governorship,
was so strapped for funds that he was unable to
purchase any television time for spot advertising, which
has become the backbone of many campaigns,
particularly on the East and West Coasts, until last
week. Incumbent governor Ronald Reagan, on the

other hand, began his campaign with a war-chest
estimated at $1.5 million.
Spiro Agnew is well on his way to becoming one of
the most spectacular and successful, fundraisers in the
history of either party. Since mid-September, he has
raised an estimated $3 5 million, bringing his total
fundraising value to over $5 million during the past six
months.
Issues have not played an overwhelming role in most
of the campaigns; rather, attention has been focused on
personalities and character quirks. The Republicans,
for the most part, have tried to attract support by

stressing "law and order." Both Nixon and Agnew have
used this theme extensively, Nixon talking about
domestic violence and Agnew attacking doves,
"radical-liberals" and leftists, and stressing that the
Democratic Party is now the party of the extreme
left-the "party of permissiveness." Republicans have
also utilized the volatile issue of drugs as well as the
leniency of the higher courts.
San Jose Incident
It is possible that the incident at San Jose Thursday
night will have a marked effect on the elections; it has
certainly provided ample fodder for the President's
campaign machinery and put the Democrats back on
the defensive. However, none of the polls released thus
far have been able to assess the impact of this
demonstration and the President's use of the publicity
surrounding it.
The Democrats have used the traditional issue of the
economy as the backbone of their campaign. They
have stressed the high rates of unemployment and
inflation and their effect on the working classes. The
Democrats seem to be successful in their efforts to
maintain close working ties with organized labor
despite President Nixon's attempt to woo support at a
Labor Day dinner and other official celebrations.
A few of the more interesting races, particularly in
the Senate and for the governorships:
In Connecticut, a three-way struggle continues

News Analysis

between Sen. Thomas Dodd (incumbent), Rev. Joe
Duffey, the national chairman of Americans for
Democratic Action, and Rep. Lowell Weicker Jr. No
one will call a winner.
Sen. Ed Muskie, in Maine, and Sen. Ted Kennedy, in
Massachusetts are well on their way to large victories;
both should win by at least 60 percent (landslide).
In Maryland, Vice President Agnew faces repeated
embarassment, as Gov. Marvin Mandel (D) is a shoo-in
for his first full term, and Sen. Joseph Tydings (D),
despite opposition from the National Rifle Association
and other large groups, should defeat J. Glenn Beall Jr.

Other congressional peace and "new priorities"
candidates are also finding fertile ground near the
nation's capital.
New York is the focus of attention for many East
Coast pollsters. At this point, Conservative Party
candidate James Buckley is leading, with Rep. Ottinger
and Sen. Goodell splitting the liberal vote. Nelson
Rockefeller is almost assured of a fourth term in office.
Hugh Scott (Senate minority leader), Harrison
Williams, John Pastore, and Robert Byrd are all safe
bets from their respective states.
THE MIDWEST
In Illinois, Adlai Stevenson 111 looks very strong,
despite Presidential campaigning for Ralph Smith, his
incumbent opponent.
The dirtiest race for a Senate seat is being fought in
Indiana, which is rated a toss-up between Sen. Vance
Hartke and Rep. Richard Roudebush. Roudebush has a
television spot purporting to show Hartke giving
American M-16 rifles to the Viet Cong (trading with
the enemy), while Hartke is questioning the number of
times that Roudebush has been married.
Hubert Humphrey is staging a successful political
comeback in Minnesota, where a landslide is predicted
over Clark McGregor.
Philip Hart, Roman Hruska ("mediocrity is no
vice"), William Proxmire and Stuart Symington are all
assured of returning to Washington in January.

In North Dakota, Quentin Burdick, one of the
liberals Nixon would most like to defeat, holds a slim
lead over Thomas Kleppe, while in Utah, another
Nixon target, Frank Moss, also seems to be holding up
despite heavy campaigning by the President and
members of his cabinet.
And in Ohio, the Senate race between Howard
Metzenbaum and Robert Taft Jr. is still a toss-up.
THE SOUTH
The President's "Southern Strategy" seems to be a
failure, as the following predictions indicate:
In Alabama, George Wallace, running for governor,
is looking for presidential momentum again. No doubt
he will find it.
Dale Bumpers, a moderate Democrat, should defeat
Winthrop Rockefeller for the Arkansas governorship.
The Democratic party seems to be rebuilding in
Arkansas.
In Florida, the Republicans thought a month ago
that they would win both the Senate seat and the
governor's mansion. Now, with the local party
machinery badly fractured, it looks like they will win
neither.
John Stennis and Harry Byrd Jr. are not likely to
lose.
And in the race around which the "Southern
Strategy" is based, Democrat Albert Gore is slowly
pulling away from Bill Brock 111, a hard-line Nixon
supporter in Tennessee. Still a close race, though.
THE WEST & SOUTHWEST
In Arizona Paul Fannin, an archconservative, will
have no problems in being reelected. Morris Udall, who
more or less led the House revolt against the
Democratic leadership, is also running a strong race.
Howard Cannon seems to have the upper edge over
William Raggio, a hand-picked Nixon man in Nevada.
Hiram Fong, Mike Mansfield, Joe Montoya, Henry
Jackson and Gale McGee all seem fairly safe in their
respective states.
And, at home in California, the question is not that
Ronald Reagan will be reelected as governor, but by
how much. John Tunney holds a slight edge over
George Murphy, but it's too close to call. Down on the
Farm, Charlie Gubser looks like he'll squeak by.
Tens of millions of Americans are expected to go to
the polls today to vote in what has become one of the
most bitterly-contested and unusual off-year elections
in this nation's history.
Despite regional bitterness, born primarily of
invective and the unprecedented participation of the
President and the Vice President in local races, the
election is expected to produce no major upsets. The
President probably will not receive the majorities he so
strongly desires in the House and Senate, and he stands
to lose some strength in the governors' mansions.
Vice President Spiro Agnew visited over 30 states
campaigning for local and statewide candidates since
mid-September. And in an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping hard from coast to
coast for the past three weeks; he has been
campaigning so extensively that many observers have
speculated that he has temporarily given up the
day-to-day direction of the federal government.
Normally, the party in power loses between 30 and
40 House seats in an off-year election, and does not
gain substantial strength in the Senate, where slightly
more than one-third of the seats are up for election.
Earlier this year, however, President Nixon said his goal
for the Republican Party would be a gain of seven seats
in the Senate and about 30 seats in the House.
Most observers now predict that the President might

Democratic Party is now the party of the extreme
left-the "party of permissiveness." Republicans have
also utilized the volatile issue of drugs as well as the
leniency of the higher courts.
San Jose Incident
It is possible that the incident at San Jose Thursday
night will have a marked effect on the elections; it has
certainly provided ample fodder for the President's
campaign machinery and put the Democrats back on
the defensive. However, none of the polls released thus
far have been able to assess the impact of this
demonstration and the President's use of the publicity
surrounding it.
The Democrats have used the traditional issue of the
economy as the backbone of their campaign. They
have stressed the high rates of unemployment and
inflation and their effect on the working classes. The
Democrats seem to be successful in their efforts to
maintain close working ties with organized labor
despite President Nixon's attempt to woo support at a
Labor Day dinner and other official celebrations.
A few of the more interesting races, particularly in
the Senate and for the governorships:
In Connecticut, a three-way struggle continues

News Analysis

between Sen. Thomas Dodd (incumbent), Rev. Joe
Duffey, the national chairman of Americans for
Democratic Action, and Rep. Lowell Weicker Jr. No
one will call a winner.
Sen. Ed Muskie, in Maine, and Sen. Ted Kennedy, in
Massachusetts are well on their way to large victories;
both should win by at least 60 percent (landslide).
In Maryland, Vice President Agnew faces repeated
embarassment, as Gov. Marvin Mandel (D) is a shoo-in
for his first full term, and Sen. Joseph Tydings (D),
despite opposition from the National Rifle Association
and other large groups, should defeat J. Glenn Beall Jr.

Other congressional peace and "new priorities"
candidates are also finding fertile ground near the
nation's capital.
New York is the focus of attention for many East
Coast pollsters. At this point, Conservative Party
candidate James Buckley is leading, with Rep. Ottinger
and Sen. Goodell splitting the liberal vote. Nelson
Rockefeller is almost assured of a fourth term in office.
Hugh Scott (Senate minority leader), Harrison
Williams, John Pastore, and Robert Byrd are all safe
bets from their respective states.
THE MIDWEST
In Illinois, Adlai Stevenson 111 looks very strong,
despite Presidential campaigning for Ralph Smith, his
incumbent opponent.
The dirtiest race for a Senate seat is being fought in
Indiana, which is rated a toss-up between Sen. Vance
Hartke and Rep. Richard Roudebush. Roudebush has a
television spot purporting to show Hartke giving
American M-16 rifles to the Viet Cong (trading with
the enemy), while Hartke is questioning the number of
times that Roudebush has been married.
Hubert Humphrey is staging a successful political
comeback in Minnesota, where a landslide is predicted
over Clark McGregor.
Philip Hart, Roman Hruska ("mediocrity is no
vice"), William Proxmire and Stuart Symington are all
assured of returning to Washington in January.

In North Dakota, Quentin Burdick, one of the
liberals Nixon would most like to defeat, holds a slim
lead over Thomas Kleppe, while in Utah, another
Nixon target, Frank Moss, also seems to be holding up
despite heavy campaigning by the President and
members of his cabinet.
And in Ohio, the Senate race between Howard
Metzenbaum and Robert Taft Jr. is still a toss-up.
THE SOUTH
The President's "Southern Strategy" seems to be a
failure, as the following predictions indicate:
In Alabama, George Wallace, running for governor,
is looking for presidential momentum again. No doubt
he will find it.
Dale Bumpers, a moderate Democrat, should defeat
Winthrop Rockefeller for the Arkansas governorship.
The Democratic party seems to be rebuilding in
Arkansas.
In Florida, the Republicans thought a month ago
that they would win both the Senate seat and the
governor's mansion. Now, with the local party
machinery badly fractured, it looks like they will win
neither.
John Stennis and Harry Byrd Jr. are not likely to
lose.
And in the race around which the "Southern
Strategy" is based, Democrat Albert Gore is slowly
pulling away from Bill Brock 111, a hard-line Nixon
supporter in Tennessee. Still a close race, though.
THE WEST & SOUTHWEST
In Arizona Paul Fannin, an archconservative, will
have no problems in being reelected. Morris Udall, who
more or less led the House revolt against the
Democratic leadership, is also running a strong race.
Howard Cannon seems to have the upper edge over
William Raggio, a hand-picked Nixon man in Nevada.
Hiram Fong, Mike Mansfield, Joe Montoya, Henry
Jackson and Gale McGee all seem fairly safe in their
respective states.
And, at home in California, the question is not that
Ronald Reagan will be reelected as governor, but by
how much. John Tunney holds a slight edge over
George Murphy, but it's too close to call. Down on the
Farm, Charlie Gubser looks like he'll squeak by.
Tens of millions of Americans are expected to go to
the polls today to vote in what has become one of the
most bitterly-contested and unusual off-year elections
in this nation's history.
Despite regional bitterness, born primarily of
invective and the unprecedented participation of the
President and the Vice President in local races, the
election is expected to produce no major upsets. The
President probably will not receive the majorities he so
strongly desires in the House and Senate, and he stands
to lose some strength in the governors' mansions.
Vice President Spiro Agnew visited over 30 states
campaigning for local and statewide candidates since
mid-September. And in an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping hard from coast to
coast for the past three weeks; he has been
campaigning so extensively that many observers have
speculated that he has temporarily given up the
day-to-day direction of the federal government.
Normally, the party in power loses between 30 and
40 House seats in an off-year election, and does not
gain substantial strength in the Senate, where slightly
more than one-third of the seats are up for election.
Earlier this year, however, President Nixon said his goal
for the Republican Party would be a gain of seven seats
in the Senate and about 30 seats in the House.
Most observers now predict that the President might
pick up a few seats in the House—no more than
five—but nothing like the dramatic show of force he
was looking for when he set his goals. And the
Republicans will not gain anywhere near seven seats in
the Senate; in fact, the President has revised his
estimate downward to two seats—and even that could
be an optimistic outlook.
Republican Money
Financially, the Republicans have enjoyed a
bountiful year; they have outspent the Democrats on a
nationwide basis about ten-to-one. Jess Unruh, the
Democratic candidate for the California governorship,
was so strapped for funds that he was unable to
purchase any television time for spot advertising, which
has become the backbone of many campaigns,
particularly on the East and West Coasts, until last
week. Incumbent governor Ronald Reagan, on the

other hand, began his campaign with a war-chest
estimated at $1.5 million.
Spiro Agnew is well on his way to becoming one of
the most spectacular and successful, fundraisers in the
history of either party. Since mid-September, he has
raised an estimated $3 5 million, bringing his total
fundraising value to over $5 million during the past six
months.
Issues have not played an overwhelming role in most
of the campaigns; rather, attention has been focused on
personalities and character quirks. The Republicans,
for the most part, have tried to attract support by

stressing "law and order." Both Nixon and Agnew have
used this theme extensively, Nixon talking about
domestic violence and Agnew attacking doves,
"radical-liberals" and leftists, and stressing that the
Democratic Party is now the party of the extreme
left-the "party of permissiveness." Republicans have
also utilized the volatile issue of drugs as well as the

In Maryland, Vice President Agnew faces repeated
embarassment, as Gov. Marvin Mandel (D) is a shoo-in
for his first full term, and Sen. Joseph Tydings (D),
despite opposition from the National Rifle Association
and other large groups, should defeat J. Glenn Beall Jr.

Other congressional peace and "new priorities"
candidates are also finding fertile ground near the
nation's capital.
New York is the focus of attention for many East
Coast pollsters. At this point, Conservative Party
candidate James Buckley is leading, with Rep. Ottinger
and Sen. Goodell splitting the liberal vote. Nelson
Rockefeller is almost assured of a fourth term in office.
Hugh Scott (Senate minority leader), Harrison
Williams, John Pastore, and Robert Byrd are all safe
bets from their respective states.
THE MIDWEST
In Illinois, Adlai Stevenson 111 looks very strong,
despite Presidential campaigning for Ralph Smith, his
incumbent opponent.
The dirtiest race for a Senate seat is being fought in
Indiana, which is rated a toss-up between Sen. Vance
Hartke and Rep. Richard Roudebush. Roudebush has a
television spot purporting to show Hartke giving
American M-16 rifles to the Viet Cong (trading with
the enemy), while Hartke is questioning the number of
times that Roudebush has been married.
Hubert Humphrey is staging a successful political
comeback in Minnesota, where a landslide is predicted
over Clark McGregor.
Philip Hart, Roman Hruska ("mediocrity is no
vice"), William Proxmire and Stuart Symington are all
assured of returning to Washington in January.

In North Dakota, Quentin Burdick, one of the
liberals Nixon would most like to defeat, holds a slim
lead over Thomas Kleppe, while in Utah, another
Nixon target, Frank Moss, also seems to be holding up
despite heavy campaigning by the President and
members of his cabinet.
And in Ohio, the Senate race between Howard
Metzenbaum and Robert Taft Jr. is still a toss-up.
THE SOUTH
The President's "Southern Strategy" seems to be a
failure, as the following predictions indicate:
In Alabama, George Wallace, running for governor,
is looking for presidential momentum again. No doubt
he will find it.
Dale Bumpers, a moderate Democrat, should defeat
Winthrop Rockefeller for the Arkansas governorship.
The Democratic party seems to be rebuilding in
Arkansas.
In Florida, the Republicans thought a month ago
that they would win both the Senate seat and the
governor's mansion. Now, with the local party
machinery badly fractured, it looks like they will win
neither.
John Stennis and Harry Byrd Jr. are not likely to
lose.
And in the race around which the "Southern
Strategy" is based, Democrat Albert Gore is slowly
pulling away from Bill Brock 111, a hard-line Nixon
supporter in Tennessee. Still a close race, though.
THE WEST & SOUTHWEST
In Arizona Paul Fannin, an archconservative, will
have no problems in being reelected. Morris Udall, who
more or less led the House revolt against the
Democratic leadership, is also running a strong race.
Howard Cannon seems to have the upper edge over
William Raggio, a hand-picked Nixon man in Nevada.
Hiram Fong, Mike Mansfield, Joe Montoya, Henry
Jackson and Gale McGee all seem fairly safe in their
respective states.
And, at home in California, the question is not that
Ronald Reagan will be reelected as governor, but by
how much. John Tunney holds a slight edge over
George Murphy, but it's too close to call. Down on the
Farm, Charlie Gubser looks like he'll squeak by.
Tens of millions of Americans are expected to go to
the polls today to vote in what has become one of the
most bitterly-contested and unusual off-year elections
in this nation's history.
Despite regional bitterness, born primarily of
invective and the unprecedented participation of the
President and the Vice President in local races, the
election is expected to produce no major upsets. The
President probably will not receive the majorities he so
strongly desires in the House and Senate, and he stands
to lose some strength in the governors' mansions.
Vice President Spiro Agnew visited over 30 states
campaigning for local and statewide candidates since
mid-September. And in an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping hard from coast to
coast for the past three weeks; he has been
campaigning so extensively that many observers have
speculated that he has temporarily given up the
day-to-day direction of the federal government.
Normally, the party in power loses between 30 and
40 House seats in an off-year election, and does not
gain substantial strength in the Senate, where slightly
more than one-third of the seats are up for election.
Earlier this year, however, President Nixon said his goal
for the Republican Party would be a gain of seven seats
in the Senate and about 30 seats in the House.
Most observers now predict that the President might
pick up a few seats in the House—no more than
five—but nothing like the dramatic show of force he
was looking for when he set his goals. And the
Republicans will not gain anywhere near seven seats in
the Senate; in fact, the President has revised his
estimate downward to two seats—and even that could
be an optimistic outlook.
Republican Money
Financially, the Republicans have enjoyed a
bountiful year; they have outspent the Democrats on a
nationwide basis about ten-to-one. Jess Unruh, the
Democratic candidate for the California governorship,
was so strapped for funds that he was unable to
purchase any television time for spot advertising, which
has become the backbone of many campaigns,
particularly on the East and West Coasts, until last
week. Incumbent governor Ronald Reagan, on the

other hand, began his campaign with a war-chest
estimated at $1.5 million.
Spiro Agnew is well on his way to becoming one of
the most spectacular and successful, fundraisers in the
history of either party. Since mid-September, he has
raised an estimated $3 5 million, bringing his total
fundraising value to over $5 million during the past six
months.
Issues have not played an overwhelming role in most
of the campaigns; rather, attention has been focused on
personalities and character quirks. The Republicans,
for the most part, have tried to attract support by

stressing "law and order." Both Nixon and Agnew have
used this theme extensively, Nixon talking about
domestic violence and Agnew attacking doves,
"radical-liberals" and leftists, and stressing that the
Democratic Party is now the party of the extreme
left-the "party of permissiveness." Republicans have
also utilized the volatile issue of drugs as well as the
leniency of the higher courts.
San Jose Incident
It is possible that the incident at San Jose Thursday
night will have a marked effect on the elections; it has
certainly provided ample fodder for the President's
campaign machinery and put the Democrats back on
the defensive. However, none of the polls released thus
far have been able to assess the impact of this
demonstration and the President's use of the publicity
surrounding it.
The Democrats have used the traditional issue of the
economy as the backbone of their campaign. They
have stressed the high rates of unemployment and
inflation and their effect on the working classes. The
Democrats seem to be successful in their efforts to
maintain close working ties with organized labor
despite President Nixon's attempt to woo support at a
Labor Day dinner and other official celebrations.
A few of the more interesting races, particularly in
the Senate and for the governorships:
In Connecticut, a three-way struggle continues

News Analysis

between Sen. Thomas Dodd (incumbent), Rev. Joe
Duffey, the national chairman of Americans for
Democratic Action, and Rep. Lowell Weicker Jr. No
one will call a winner.
Sen. Ed Muskie, in Maine, and Sen. Ted Kennedy, in
Massachusetts are well on their way to large victories;
both should win by at least 60 percent (landslide).
