# National Priorities Exclude Housing Problem

Given present national
priorities, there cannot • an
immediate solution the 1( ai
moderate incon housi
shortage. With the problem
becoming increasingly ite on a
nationwide basis, the Nixon
administration has slowed
subsidies and severely cut back
the Department of Housing ai
Urban Development (HUD).
Any attempt to build housing
for low and moderate income
groups in the Mid-Peninsula is
dependent upon federal subsidies.
According to the University's
manager of real estate, Boyd
Smith, low-cost housing built
without federal aid results in
projects like the Oak Creek
Apartments—which are definitely
not low or moderate income
housing.
Yet, according to the Santa
Clara County Planning
Department, "The Nixon
Administration has proposed to
solve the nation's housing
shortage by easing tight credit
conditions. Rather than relying
upon direct subsidies, all efforts
are directed to stimulate the
private housing industry. Interest
rates are to be forced down by
increasing the supply of mortgage
capital to the private sector.

"George Romney, secretary of
HUD said that his department's
budget for the next fiscal year had
been 'cut to the bone' and he was
glad of it. He said that he was
willing to forego needed
■xpenditures by his department
for the prospect that the overall
fight budget submitted by the
President would make more
capital available for building
housing in the private sector."
Subsidies Only Solution
Nixon's policy of shifting
emphasis away from federal
subsidies comes at a time when
not only are they more
desperately needed that ever
before, but when they are the
only solution which is at all
feasible.
Most of the small amount of
subsidized housing which has been
planned in the Mid-Peninsula will
be funded under Section 23 6 of
the 1969 Housing Act. This
program is designed for families
whose incomes are too high to
qualify for public housing, but
who are unable to afford
currently available housing.
Under this new type of
assistance, non-profit,
cooperative, or limited-dividend
sponsors receive FHA-insured
mortgage financing for as low as

one percent interest rate for a
term of up to 4 0 years.
Interest reduction payments
reduce rentals to a basic charge. A
resident pays either the basic
charge or 25 percent of his
income whichever is greater. The
incomes of occupants are
re-examined at least every two
years.
Insufficient Funds
Presently the federal housing
programs have many more
qualified applicants than there are
funds available to sponsor.
Although projects such as the 2 00
units planned for University lands
do get funded since they are high
priority, in effect what they do is
to use funds which would have
gone to build housing elsewhere.
Thus, local housing
developments, while important in
the area they serve, will not
contribute to the overall solution
until more funding is made
available. Meanwhile there does
not appear to be any prospect for
easing of the national shortage in
the near future.
Prospects in the Mid-Peninsula

without a major increase in
federal funding are bleak.
Many Obstacles
Some of the major obstacles in
the Mid-Peninsula are the lack of
cooperation among different
communities; the scarcity and
high cost of suitable land
throughout the area; the rising
costs of housing itself; the
residential zoning which prohibits
low-moderate income housing; the
demolition of houses for other
uses, the lack of federal money;
and the opposition of the general
public. In addition, neither local
nor county governments have
been willing to accept
responsibility for the problem.
According to Urban Coalition
director Ira Hall, another obstacle
is that each separate municipality
is primarily interested in
developing the best tax base
possible. A Coalition report points
out, "There is an active effort on
the part of many of the cities to
improve their tax position by
increasing the industrial and
commercial tax base, which are
net tax benefit land uses, while

keeping down residential uses for
families with children, especially
at higher densities than
single-family zoning."
"The fastest rising cost
component of housing, according
to a Santa Clara County report,
"is the price of land. In many
areas the price of a developed
single family lot has nearly
doubled since 1960. The high
prices in the Palo Alto-Mountain
View-Los Altos area represent the
scarcity of such lands .. . (how
ever) scarcity of supply is only
one factor. About 18 -20,000 acres
each year are 'vacant urban' lands
awaiting development."
Approach Needed
Says Charles Walker, a member
of the Palo Alto city managers
office, "I think the land is
available, it's just going to take
some imaginative approaches."
The cost of building housing is
also rising very rapidly. Combined
with the high interest rate this
factor has made private low-cost
housing almost impossible. The
federal Government is presently
involved in a project called

"Operation Breakthrough" which
it hopes will devise methods of
significantly reducing costs.
The 197 0 South Bay Regional
Housing Conference report notes,
"There was considerable
skepticism that technology itself
would result in sufficiently
substantial savings to represent
the solution to housing shortages.
It was reported that very few
technological advances in building
techniques had been proved
through 'Operation Breakthrough'
thuss far. . . Volume production
of housing through 'factory-built'
methods is not without
difficulties.
"Criticisms were also made
that factory building exploits
labor, particularly minority
groups, in terms of wages,
advancement potential, and in the
on-site work that needs to be
done with factory-built systems."
Each of these obstacles alone
would present difficulties to the
development of low and moderate
income housing. Taken together
they leave little hope that any
significant progress can be made
in the foreseeable future.
