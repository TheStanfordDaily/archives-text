# Academic Information
## Center Offers Comprehensive Services 
### PETER MEIC 
"If you have a question on
academic matters that we can't
answer, we'll find someone who
can . . That is the purpose of
the new Academic Information
Center (AIC) which is located on
the third floor of the Old Union.
The AIC provides students and
their advisors with information
designed to help the student
define and achieve his academic
and post-graduate goals. George
R. Hamrdla, director of the AIC
and a Stanford graduate, defines
"obtaining, displaying and
disseminating of academic
information" as the purpose of
the AIC. But during an interview,
Hamrdla expanded on that basic
premise. According to Hamrdla,
the center was established to serve
the student and his advisor. It is
totally academically oriented and
almost completely for
undergraduates, although graduate
students would find some of its
services helpful.
The AIC has such information
as requirements for graduation,
grading policies and procedures.
James Gibbs, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, is
especially enthusiastic about the
ASSU course descriptions which
can be found at the AIC. Under
the auspices of the ASSU, a
student committee has compiled
course descriptions for all courses

open to freshmen. By winter
quarter, descriptions for all
courses open to all undergraduates
will be available.
AIC also keeps lists of
recommended courses for
pre-professional study, advisors,
interdepartmental programs and
majors, extra-departmental
programs such as SWOPSI and
SCIRE, special programs for
minority students and study
programs at other institutions.
The AIC is in the process of
compiling a complete collection
of catalogs of all institutions of
higher learning, both
undergraduate and graduate, in
the US and Canada.
If you're thinking about grad
school, besides having all the
catalogs, the AIC will furnish
applications and information on
all graduate admissions tests such
as the GRE and MCAT. The
center can help any student with
any post-graduate academic plans.
Some academic counseling and
support are also available at the
AIC. Hamrdla explained that the
AIC will integrate the university's
student services so that a student
may arrange to take a series of
vocational tests, for example, and
discuss the results with a qualified
counselor.
If the AIC is not able to handle
a particular counseling problem,
they can refer a student to the
Student Counseling Service or if a

more serious psychiatric problem
exists, to Cowell Health Center.
The AIC grew out of the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES);
which recommended that the
advisor not be a mere dispenser of
information, but attempt to
establish a closer and more
meaningful relationship with his
advisee. The new freshman

advising system is the result. The
AIC was established to help the
advisor help his advisee as well as
to help individual students.
Part of the new Office of
Undergraduate Studies headed by
Dean Gibbs, the AIC is located
seperately in the Old Union to
make it more readily available to

discuss the results with a qualified
counselor.
If the AIC is not able to handle
a particular counseling problem,
they can refer a student to the
Student Counseling Service or if a

more serious psychiatric problem
exists, to Cowell Health Center.
The AIC grew out of the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES);
which recommended that the
advisor not be a mere dispenser of
information, but attempt to
establish a closer and more
meaningful relationship with his
advisee. The new freshman

advising system is the result. The
AIC was established to help the
advisor help his advisee as well as
to help individual students.
Part of the new Office of
Undergraduate Studies headed by
Dean Gibbs, the AIC is located
seperately in the Old Union to
make it more readily available to
students.
"If you have a question on
academic matters that we can't
answer, we'll find someone who
can . . That is the purpose of
the new Academic Information
Center (AIC) which is located on
the third floor of the Old Union.
The AIC provides students and
their advisors with information
designed to help the student
define and achieve his academic
and post-graduate goals. George
R. Hamrdla, director of the AIC
and a Stanford graduate, defines
"obtaining, displaying and
disseminating of academic
information" as the purpose of
the AIC. But during an interview,
Hamrdla expanded on that basic
premise. According to Hamrdla,
the center was established to serve
the student and his advisor. It is
totally academically oriented and
almost completely for
undergraduates, although graduate
students would find some of its
services helpful.
The AIC has such information
as requirements for graduation,
grading policies and procedures.
James Gibbs, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, is
especially enthusiastic about the
ASSU course descriptions which
can be found at the AIC. Under
the auspices of the ASSU, a
student committee has compiled
course descriptions for all courses

open to freshmen. By winter
quarter, descriptions for all
courses open to all undergraduates
will be available.
AIC also keeps lists of
recommended courses for
pre-professional study, advisors,
interdepartmental programs and
majors, extra-departmental
programs such as SWOPSI and
SCIRE, special programs for
minority students and study
programs at other institutions.
The AIC is in the process of
compiling a complete collection
of catalogs of all institutions of
higher learning, both
undergraduate and graduate, in
the US and Canada.
If you're thinking about grad
school, besides having all the
catalogs, the AIC will furnish
applications and information on
all graduate admissions tests such
as the GRE and MCAT. The
center can help any student with
any post-graduate academic plans.
Some academic counseling and
support are also available at the
AIC. Hamrdla explained that the
AIC will integrate the university's
student services so that a student
may arrange to take a series of
vocational tests, for example, and
discuss the results with a qualified
counselor.

they can refer a student to the
