# 'Tom Jones' Feasts Tomorrow
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
The definitive film on
gluttony, squalor, filth, and lust,
"TOM JONES" will be shown
tomorrow night in Cubberley at
7:30 and 9:45. John Osborne
adapted Henry Fielding's satiric
comment on the manners and
morals of 1 8 th century England
and Tony Richardson ("A TASTE
OF HONEY" and"THE
LINELINESS OF THE LONG
DISTANCE RUNNER") directed.
The classic scene in which Tom
(Albert Finney) and Mrs. Waters
(Joyce Redman) indulge in a
friendly game of chicken has been
the topic of numerous masters
theses and articles on the bird as a
symbol in 20 th century British
cinema.
The International Association
will present "BAD BOYS," a
Japanese film directed by Hani
Susumu Thursday evening in
Cubberley Auditorium.
"THE BIG SLEEP," a first-rate
detective thriller is scheduled to
be shown Thursday evening in
Bishop Auditorium in the

Business School. Humphrey
Bogart stars as private investigator
Philip Marlowe and the other
characters, according to Pauline
Kael, "are a collection of
sophisticated monsters-black
mailers, pornographers, apathetic
society girls (Lauren Bacall-Mrs.
Humphrey Bogart-and Martha
Vickers are a baffling pair of
spoiled sisters; the latter sucks her
thumb), drug addicts,
nymphomaniacs (a brunette
Dorothy Malone seduces the hero
in what must surely be record
time), and murders." Someone for
everyone.
Howard Hawks, America's
most under-rated director
("SCARFACE," "THE ROAD TO
GLORY," "RED RIVER," "RIO
BRAVO," "EL DORADO") made
"THE BIG SLEEP" in 1946 with
help from screenwriter William
Faulkner, who had to appeal to
the novel's author Raymond
Chandler for guidance in figuring
out the complicated plot. Director
Hawks had to admit that "neither
the author, the writer, nor myself
knew who killed whom."


CHARACTER STUDYâ€”Susannah York penetrates the role of the
18 th century doxy with an enthusiasm which is obvious in this scene
from "Tom Jones," playing Wednesday night in Cubberley.
