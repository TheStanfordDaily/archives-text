# NYRE Exciting And Diverse
## 
### NEIL ARNET DAVID GLASS 
Last Friday the New York
Rock Ensemble returned to
Stanford for what must be
described as an extremely
successful, exciting concert. For
those who had read the Daily
preview on Thursday the concert
format probably came as a bit of a
surprise, for certainly The New
York Rock Ensemble did not do a
combination of Bach and Rock.
But, of course, that isn't what
they do. And so, to both The New
York Rock Ensemble and those
who expected to hear a lot of
Bach, 1 apologize for the
inaccuracies of the preview.
Now, as for what The New
York Rock Ensemble does do.
Well, they do it all. They are not
Bach and also rock, or classical
and also rock. They are a group of
four tremendously competent
musicians, certainly the four best
musicians 1 have ever seen
combined in any rock group, who
play everything well.
"Everything" for them is a
synthesis of all their backgrounds
in different types of music and of
all their many instruments.
What distinguishes them as a
rock group is not the stylistic
factor; they still tend to borrow
fairly heavily from the best of
contemporary groups (for
example, Mike Kamen's organ
improvisations were often
reminiscent of The Doors' Ray
Manzarek). Their superiority may
rather be expressed as 1 ) flawless
musicianship, rooted in their
extensive musical backgrounds,

;.nd 2) total empathy and
awareness of each other.
In addition, they are
performers in the best sense,
maintaining at all times a rapport
with the audience. Mike Kamen,
the group's leader, is an
extraordinary all-around
performer. In addition to having
one of the best singing voices of
any rock vocalist—undoubtedly a
product of his musical
training—he also displayed
brilliant technique on the
electronic keyboard
(organ-piano-harpsichord) and on
the oboe—the latter a welcome, if
strange, addition to the rock
format.
Drummer Martin Fulterman
also doubles on the oboe, and bass
guitarist Dorian Rudnytsky is a
capable cellist. The fourth
member, Clif Nivison, is the only
one of the four with no classical
training, but is an outstanding
lead guitarist who took over the
percussion chores when the others
shifted to "classy" mode.
The group has abandoned their
former straight-Bach playing in
favor of incorporating the
Master's music into their own; one
of their songs utilizes the theme
of the Goldberg Variations, for
example. Yet there was no
gimmickry; Kamen is among the
first to use Baroque music in rock
without a self-conscious
phoniness.
The highlight of the program
was 'Anaconda,' a song from their
latest album; Fulterman, while no
Ginger Baker, tore off on a
blood-boiling drum improvisation
(regrettably missing from the

recorded version) that left one
limp. Other peaks were the
hauntingly lyrical 'Fields of Joy'
and an arrangement of Procol
Harum's "Whiter Shade of Pale"
that has to rank as one of the
most beautiful renditions of a
rock song of all time. With
Fulterman playing the Bach-like
opening melody on oboe, backed
by Kamen's expressive singing and
organ-playing, this performance
left any other I've ever heard far
behind.
I could conclude this article
here by reaffirming the talent and
diversity and professionalism of
The New York Rock Ensemble,
but to do so would be omitting a
large portion of the group's
performance; for The New York
Rock Ensemble strive to be more
than a two and a half hour
concert. As they have travelled in
California the last few weeks, „.iey
have been setting up informal
get-togethers with students to be
held a few hours before their
concert.
In the afternoon before
Friday's concert, the group met
students in the Branner Lounge.
They rapped about their style of
music, experiences they'd had in
their travels, and people they'd
encountered. Considering that
three of the members had
attended the Juilliard School of
Music (two having graduated) 1
was surprised to hear one of the
members tell a girl that if he could
do it again, he wouldn't go to
Juilliard. The statement contained
no bitterness, simply practicality.
It happens that this past
weekend also marked the fourth
anniversary of The New York

Rock Ensemble's playing
together; so Stanford students,
through the courtesy of Columbia
Records, also got to meet the
group after the concert to
celebrate the anniversary by
enjoying cheese fondue, hot cider,
cake and even conversation with
the Lymans.
All in all, this second visit of
The New York Rock Ensemble to
Stanford was a great one. The
group was impressive both on and
off the stage.

Ginger Baker, tore off on a
blood-boiling drum improvisation
(regrettably missing from the

recorded version) that left one
limp. Other peaks were the
hauntingly lyrical 'Fields of Joy'
and an arrangement of Procol
Harum's "Whiter Shade of Pale"
that has to rank as one of the
most beautiful renditions of a
rock song of all time. With
Fulterman playing the Bach-like
opening melody on oboe, backed
by Kamen's expressive singing and
organ-playing, this performance
left any other I've ever heard far
behind.
I could conclude this article
here by reaffirming the talent and
diversity and professionalism of
The New York Rock Ensemble,
but to do so would be omitting a
large portion of the group's
performance; for The New York
Rock Ensemble strive to be more
than a two and a half hour
concert. As they have travelled in
California the last few weeks, „.iey
have been setting up informal
get-togethers with students to be
held a few hours before their
concert.
In the afternoon before
Friday's concert, the group met
students in the Branner Lounge.
They rapped about their style of
music, experiences they'd had in
their travels, and people they'd
encountered. Considering that
three of the members had
attended the Juilliard School of
Music (two having graduated) 1
was surprised to hear one of the
members tell a girl that if he could
do it again, he wouldn't go to
Juilliard. The statement contained
no bitterness, simply practicality.
It happens that this past
weekend also marked the fourth
anniversary of The New York

Rock Ensemble's playing
together; so Stanford students,
through the courtesy of Columbia
Records, also got to meet the
group after the concert to
celebrate the anniversary by
enjoying cheese fondue, hot cider,
cake and even conversation with
the Lymans.
All in all, this second visit of
The New York Rock Ensemble to
Stanford was a great one. The
group was impressive both on and
off the stage.

Last Friday the New York
Rock Ensemble returned to
Stanford for what must be
described as an extremely
successful, exciting concert. For
those who had read the Daily
preview on Thursday the concert
format probably came as a bit of a
surprise, for certainly The New
York Rock Ensemble did not do a
combination of Bach and Rock.
But, of course, that isn't what
they do. And so, to both The New
York Rock Ensemble and those
who expected to hear a lot of
Bach, 1 apologize for the
inaccuracies of the preview.
Now, as for what The New
York Rock Ensemble does do.
Well, they do it all. They are not
Bach and also rock, or classical
and also rock. They are a group of
four tremendously competent
musicians, certainly the four best
musicians 1 have ever seen
combined in any rock group, who
play everything well.
"Everything" for them is a
synthesis of all their backgrounds
in different types of music and of
all their many instruments.
What distinguishes them as a
rock group is not the stylistic
factor; they still tend to borrow
fairly heavily from the best of
contemporary groups (for
example, Mike Kamen's organ
improvisations were often
reminiscent of The Doors' Ray
Manzarek). Their superiority may
rather be expressed as 1 ) flawless
musicianship, rooted in their
extensive musical backgrounds,

;.nd 2) total empathy and
awareness of each other.
In addition, they are
performers in the best sense,
maintaining at all times a rapport
with the audience. Mike Kamen,
the group's leader, is an
extraordinary all-around
performer. In addition to having
one of the best singing voices of
any rock vocalist—undoubtedly a
product of his musical
training—he also displayed
brilliant technique on the
electronic keyboard
(organ-piano-harpsichord) and on
the oboe—the latter a welcome, if
strange, addition to the rock
format.
Drummer Martin Fulterman
also doubles on the oboe, and bass
guitarist Dorian Rudnytsky is a
capable cellist. The fourth
member, Clif Nivison, is the only
one of the four with no classical
training, but is an outstanding
lead guitarist who took over the
percussion chores when the others
shifted to "classy" mode.
The group has abandoned their
former straight-Bach playing in
favor of incorporating the
Master's music into their own; one
of their songs utilizes the theme
of the Goldberg Variations, for
example. Yet there was no
gimmickry; Kamen is among the
first to use Baroque music in rock
without a self-conscious
phoniness.
The highlight of the program
was 'Anaconda,' a song from their
latest album; Fulterman, while no

Bach and also rock, or classical
and also rock. They are a group of
four tremendously competent
musicians, certainly the four best
musicians 1 have ever seen
combined in any rock group, who
play everything well.
"Everything" for them is a
synthesis of all their backgrounds
in different types of music and of
all their many instruments.
What distinguishes them as a
rock group is not the stylistic
factor; they still tend to borrow
fairly heavily from the best of
contemporary groups (for
example, Mike Kamen's organ
improvisations were often
reminiscent of The Doors' Ray
Manzarek). Their superiority may
rather be expressed as 1 ) flawless
musicianship, rooted in their
extensive musical backgrounds,

;.nd 2) total empathy and
awareness of each other.
In addition, they are
performers in the best sense,
maintaining at all times a rapport
with the audience. Mike Kamen,
the group's leader, is an
extraordinary all-around
performer. In addition to having
one of the best singing voices of
any rock vocalist—undoubtedly a
product of his musical
training—he also displayed
brilliant technique on the
electronic keyboard
(organ-piano-harpsichord) and on
the oboe—the latter a welcome, if
strange, addition to the rock
format.
Drummer Martin Fulterman
also doubles on the oboe, and bass
guitarist Dorian Rudnytsky is a
capable cellist. The fourth
member, Clif Nivison, is the only
one of the four with no classical
training, but is an outstanding
lead guitarist who took over the
percussion chores when the others
shifted to "classy" mode.
The group has abandoned their
former straight-Bach playing in
favor of incorporating the
Master's music into their own; one
of their songs utilizes the theme
of the Goldberg Variations, for
example. Yet there was no
gimmickry; Kamen is among the
first to use Baroque music in rock
without a self-conscious
phoniness.
The highlight of the program
was 'Anaconda,' a song from their
latest album; Fulterman, while no
Ginger Baker, tore off on a
blood-boiling drum improvisation
(regrettably missing from the

recorded version) that left one
limp. Other peaks were the
hauntingly lyrical 'Fields of Joy'
and an arrangement of Procol
Harum's "Whiter Shade of Pale"
that has to rank as one of the
most beautiful renditions of a
rock song of all time. With
Fulterman playing the Bach-like
opening melody on oboe, backed
by Kamen's expressive singing and
organ-playing, this performance
left any other I've ever heard far
behind.
I could conclude this article
here by reaffirming the talent and
diversity and professionalism of
The New York Rock Ensemble,
but to do so would be omitting a
large portion of the group's
performance; for The New York
Rock Ensemble strive to be more
than a two and a half hour
concert. As they have travelled in
California the last few weeks, „.iey
have been setting up informal
get-togethers with students to be
held a few hours before their
concert.
In the afternoon before
Friday's concert, the group met
students in the Branner Lounge.
They rapped about their style of
music, experiences they'd had in
their travels, and people they'd
encountered. Considering that
three of the members had
attended the Juilliard School of
Music (two having graduated) 1
was surprised to hear one of the
members tell a girl that if he could
do it again, he wouldn't go to
Juilliard. The statement contained
no bitterness, simply practicality.
It happens that this past
weekend also marked the fourth
anniversary of The New York

Rock Ensemble's playing
together; so Stanford students,
through the courtesy of Columbia
Records, also got to meet the
group after the concert to
celebrate the anniversary by
enjoying cheese fondue, hot cider,
cake and even conversation with
the Lymans.
All in all, this second visit of
The New York Rock Ensemble to
Stanford was a great one. The
group was impressive both on and
off the stage.
