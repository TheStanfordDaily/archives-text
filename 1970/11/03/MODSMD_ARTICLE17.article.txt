# The 						Tribe Wins A Sleeper
## 
### FRED LEESON 
It wasn't much of a football
game until the defense took over.
And after that, according to
the dinner-table diagnosticians, it
just got boring.
"1 don't think any of us were
happy with that first half," said
Coach John Ralston after it was
over. "In the second half the
offense still did not take that ball
straight down the field."
But if the 48-10 win over
Oregon State was sloppy -at
points, it was still a win, one of
two needed to get Stanford to the
Rose Bowl. A victory over
Washington next week would
wrap up the Pasadena jaunt for
the Indians.
After a sluggish first half, with
the Tribe leading 17-10,
Stanford's defense got serious and
obliterated the Beavers and set up
a feast of Stanford touchdowns.
Stanford gave the Beavers 10
points and 145 yards in a
lackluster first half. They got only
a few more yards in the second.
Go To It
"We just decided to play
football," Jody Graves said of the
second-half defensive effort. "You
gotta have poise to play good
football. Yes, we were up for it
and all that, but sometimes you
can jump around too much and
not be ready to hit."
A punt blocked by Larry
Butler set up one scoring pass
from Jim Plunkett to Bob Moore,
a 34-yard punt return by Eric
Cross set up another scoring pass
which Reggie Sanderson took on
the 12 and maneuvered in, and
Jim Kauffman ripped off a Jim
Kilmartin pass and ran it 4 6 yards
for another.
"It's funny," Butler explained
afterward, "last week I dreamed I
would block a punt in this game.
I've been coming pretty close to a
lot of them lately. But in the

dream I picked it up and ran for a
touchdown."
As it was, the ball thudded
against Butler's forearm and
bounced back to the Beaver 13.
Two rushes by Jim Kehl, who
had scored in the first half on a 1 3
yard run, moved the ball to the
nine where Plunkett rolled to his
right and hit Moore with his
second of three touchdown
passes.
His first one came early in the
first quarter when Jack Lasater
broke wide open down the
sidelines and Jim hit him on a 70
yard scoring play.
"Their guy on me jumped like
it was rotation," Lasater said,
"but nobody rotated. It had to be
a mistake on their part."
Another First
Plunkett, who became
football's first player to amass
over 7,000 yards in career total
offense, completed 13 of 26
passes for 2 70 yards and came
within inches of hitting a fourth
and fifth touchdown passes.
One, with Hillary Shockley
standing unprotected in the
endzone, was batted down by a
diving defender at the last second
and in another instance Lasater
was in the open a second time but
again the ball was deflected in a
desperation leap just before it got
to him.
Meanwhile Jim Kilmartin,
Oregon State quarterback,
completed nine of 2 0 passes and
had three intercepted and his
substitute, Mike Keck, threw five
incompletes and added another
interception.
Jack Schultz intercepted one
Kilmartin pass in the endzone late
in the second quarter, stopping a
Beaver drive which had started on
the Stanford 4 9 after an errant
Plunkett pass.
But the Tribe fumbled on the
first play after Schultz' catch (yes,

the ragged first half again) and the
Beavers kicked a field goal just
before the gun.
Kicker Steve Horowitz had his
second excellent game in a row,
scoring field goals of 2 4 and 3 4
yards and hitting all six extra
points.
He just misbfi third field goal
attempt from 4 5 yards which had
sufficient distance but flew a bit
wide.
Jim Merrill finished off
Stanford's scoring with a two-yard
plunge at the end of a 42-yard
drive quarterbacked by Jess

Freitas. He threw for 17 yards to
Bill Scott, fired incomplete once
to Scott in the endzone, threw to
him again in the endzone where
pass interference was called,
setting up Merrill's run.
Shockley led Stanford runners
with 4 9 yards, followed by Kehl
with 35, Merrill, 32, and
Sanderson, 23.
Stanford had Oregon State's
potent running game pretty well
defensed, allowing the Beavers
148 net yards on the ground.
Dave Schilling led the visitors with

63 yards and three others were in
the twenties.
Stanford had 37 0 total yards
to 223, with 143 met yards
rushing and 227 net yards passing.
Satre Leads
Phil Satre, who also picked off
a Kilmartin pass, led Stanford
defensive statistics with seven
tackles and six assisted tackles,
followed by Butler with four of
each, and Charles McCloud, Ben
Barnes, Pete Lazetich, Roger
Cowan and Efton Hall with three
tackles each.
