# Then What?
## If We Lose Twice?

Beat Washington. If we do,
we'll be in the Rose Bowl. If we
don't the Pac-8 representative will
remain very undecided.
After last weekend's upsets, no
fewer than five teams have a shot
at the championship. Stanford is
undefeated in league play and
behind them are four teams with
two losses apiece, Cal, UCLA,
Washington and Oregon.
Losing to Washington, we
would have to beat Cal and under
the circumstances, it wouldn't be
easy. Failing that we would be
one of two on four teams finishing
with two losses.
If Stanford and one other team
end up with two losses, the
winner of the regular season game
between them would go. If more
than two teams end up with two
losses, a point system would be
activated to choose the two top
teams.
Under the point system, a
conference win is worth four, a
non-conference win three, a

conference tie two, a
non-conference tie one and a half
points. Presumably no distinction
is made between non-conference
and conference losses.
Now once the top two teams
have been appointed, so to speak,
the winner of their game will go,
unless they tied, in which case the
team with the most points goes. If
the points are equal the team
which had not appeared in the
bowl for the longest period would
be selected.
Simple isn't it? About all that's
certain is that under no
circumstances can Oregon State,
Washington State or, believe it or

not, USC end up in Pasadena.
When and if the Pac-S
representative is determined they
can fairly well count on playing
Ohio State.
But if Ohio State were to lose
to Michigan, Northwestern and
Michigan State would still be in
the running. Since they appeared
last January, Michigan is ineligible
to return under Big Ten rules.
We shouldn't lose to
Washington. But we shouldn't
have lost to Purdue. In case we do
lose Saturday, Daily sports will
boggle your minds with a
rundown on more possibilities
next week.
