# Tough Lag Course Ready For Entries
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
It's all there, the throbbing
roar of finely tuned, precision
built machinery, beautiful blonde
pit pretties with stop watches
dangling demurely from their
necks and lap charts in hand,
international crowds lining the
steep banks, a champagne filled
trophy for the victor.
Le Mans? Monte * Carlo?
Watkins Glen?
No. Lake Lag.
The first and last race of the
Stanford Grand Prix circuit, the
annual Lagunita Seca Automotive
classic pits car and driver alone
against the clock in a race to
decide the driving championship
of Stanford University.
Out surveying conditions at the
somewhat sketchy oval
comprising Lagunita International
Speedway, this year's race
chairman, Jim Quillinan, said, "I
consider this race to be the truest
test of men and machinery
anywhere."

"It involves every driving skill I
know, and the course itself can
only be considered grueling. Both
car and driver must be prepared to
take a real pounding. Neither
Spa's Burneville Corner nor
Monza's Curva Grande can
compare with Lagunita's Big
Ditch."
Quillinan is expecting the
Willy's Jeep team to really
threaten the perennial favorite
dune buggies in this year's
November 15 duel.
The Phi Kap's Doug Muchmory
set a course record of 1 :31 in his
buggy last year, while the Delts'
Mike Carrigan turned in a clocking
of 1 :32 over the lakebed track.
In the open division, the
Stanford Band's milk truck had a
gutty showing to its credit as did
the Formula Zero entry from
Cro-Mem Motors.
Racing this year will be in
three unlimited, anything goes
divisionsâ€”Mens' and Womens'
Automotive and a special division
forr bikes, road or dirt.
Individual or team entries will
be gratefully accepted by
Quillinan at 3 27-9558 or Randy
Gaynor at 327-9461. They're
putting a keg on ice for the
winner.
