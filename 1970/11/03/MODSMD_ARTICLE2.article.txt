# California Campaigns To Be Decided Today
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
An estimated 6 ,600,000 Californians
will vote today in one of the most
hotly contested elections in recent
history.
At stake are the Governor's and Lt.
Governor's offices, one U.S. Senate
seat, the position of State Supt. of
Public Instruction, four other high
State offices, four State Board of
Equalization places, 38 seats in the
House of Representatives, 100 State
Senate and Assembly positions, 20

State propositions, and numerous
county and local offices and measures.
The vote is expected to be between
75 and 7 8 percent of all registered
voters. Both parties are mounting
massive get-out-the-vote drives, in many
areas using large numbers of students.
Bitter Campaign
The elections bring to a close a
bitter campaign of accusations and
name-calling, deceptive advertising, and
last-minute television pleas.

ALL SYSTEMS GO—Volunteers at the Student Committee for Involvement in
Politics plan last minute campaign efforts to get out the vote today.
Incumbent Governor Ronald Reagan
appears to hold a decisive lead over
Democratic Assemblyman Jess Unruh,
despite Unruh's contention that "the
tide has changed." Recent polls give
Reagan 49 percent of the vote to
Unruh's37 percent.
The Reagan bid has depended on the
Governor's appeal to conservative
voters of both parties. In a well-run,
lavishly financed campaign, Reagan has
attempted to capitalize on the backlash
against campus violence and incidents
such as the demonstrations at President
Nixon's San Jose appearance Thursday.
Tight Budget
Unruh, operating under a tight
budget, has concentrated on
dramatizing his characterization of
Reagan as a tool of Southern California
insurance and oil interests, at one point
taking newsmen on a "field trip" to the
home of financier Henry Salvatori,
Reagan's principal backer, who forcibly
evicted the Unruh party from the
premises.
In the U.S. Senatorial race,
Congressman John V. Tunney has
opened a sizable lead of some 7 percent
over his Republican opponent, Senator
George Murphy.
The aging (68) Murphy, a leader of
the conservative faction in the Senate,
is depending on the support of
President Nixon and Vice-President
Agnew, and on the coattails of
Governor Reagan. His campaign has
suffered due to his ill health and the
disclosure of his acceptance of fees
from Technicolor, Inc. for services
rendered as an "advisor."
Anarchy
In recent weeks, Murphy partisans
have attempted to characterize Tunney
and other liberals (including Senators
George McGovern and Edmund Muskie,
former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, and former Ambassador Sargent
Shriver) as "radicals," and the voter's
choice as "between Anarchy or Law
and Order."

Tunney, the 35-year-old son of
former heavyweight champion Gene
Tunney, is depending on his
Kennedy-style charisma, a
moderate-liberal viewpoint, and a voter
reaction against Murphy's campaign
tactics. Last week Tunney accused
Murphy's campaign management firm
of hiring hippies to wave Tunney signs
and jeer during Murphy rallies.
Although Tunney appears to hold
the advantage, the effects of President
Nixon's appearance in San Jose, the
voters' reactions to the disturbances
there, and the magnitude of the
expected Reagan victory make the
outcome highly uncertain.
Kiles-Rafferty
Perhaps the closest race in today's
balloting will be that between
incumbent Max Rafferty and Wilson
Riles for the "non-partisan" office of
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction. The arch-conservative
Rafferty, long an opponent of sex
education and the classroom use of
"smutty" books such as Eldridge
Cleaver's Soul on Ice, appears to have
lost his early lead.
Riles, on the other hand, began his
campaign as a relative unknown, but
has been shown in recent polls to be at
least as strong as Rafferty. Most experts
consider the contest too close to call.
In other state races, Republican
incumbent Ed Reinecke is favored over
State Senator Alfred Alquist for the Lt.
Governor's office; Treasurer Ivy Baker
Priest leads Democratic challenger
Milton Gordon; and Houston Fluornoy,
Republican, is expected to win the
office of Controller against Democrat
Ronald Cameron. In the campaign for
Secretary of State, Republican James
Flournoy has narrowed the lead
previously held by Democrat Edmund
G. Brown, Jr., but Brown is still
favored.
Gubser Favored
In the Tenth Congressional District,
Republican incumbent Charles S.
Gubser is still favored over Democratic
"peace candidate" Stuart McLean,

despite a large number of undecided
voters. McLean is hoping for a large
turnout of student workers, but his
chances may have been hurt by a strong
reaction against the demonstrations in
San Jose Thursday, where Gubser
appeared with President Nixon.
In the 14 th State Senate District,
Clark L. Bradley, the Republican
incumbent, is expected to successfully
defend his seat against the challenge of
Democrat John B. Rutherford. In the
22 nd Assembly District, Republican
Richard D. Hayden faces former
McCarthy campaign worker J. Ken
Croft.
In a heated campaign for Santa Clara
County Sheriff, Undersheriff James M.
Geary opposes Santa Clara County
Supervisor Sam P. Delia Maggiore.
Geary maintains that "we can meet the
challenge of crime ... through
technological advances." Delia
Maggiore favors restoring "our youth's
respect for law enforcement" through
"a concentrated information-education
program."
McCloskey Favored
In San Mateo County, Republican
Congressman Paul N. McCloskey Jr. is
defending his seat against Robert
Gomperts, the Democratic nominee,
and Jack Wilson, a conservative
Republican who is conducting a
write-in campaign. Republican
Assemblyman Carl A. Britschgi opposes
Democrat Arlen Gregorio for the State
Senate.
Among the 2 0 State propositions
submitted to the voters today, the most
significant are Proposition 1, the
"Clean Water Bond Law," which
provides for $250,000,000 in State
grants for pollution control facilities;
Proposition 5, which requires that
meetings of the Board of Regents of
the University of California be open to
the public; and Proposition 18, which
amends the State Constitution to allow
highway revenues to be used for
construction of mass transit, and
research and control of air pollution.
Polls will open at 7 a.m. and close at
8 p.m.
An estimated 6 ,600,000 Californians
will vote today in one of the most
hotly contested elections in recent
history.
At stake are the Governor's and Lt.
Governor's offices, one U.S. Senate
seat, the position of State Supt. of

Among the 2 0 State propositions
submitted to the voters today, the most
significant are Proposition 1, the
"Clean Water Bond Law," which
provides for $250,000,000 in State
grants for pollution control facilities;
Proposition 5, which requires that
meetings of the Board of Regents of
the University of California be open to
the public; and Proposition 18, which
amends the State Constitution to allow
highway revenues to be used for
construction of mass transit, and
research and control of air pollution.
Polls will open at 7 a.m. and close at
8 p.m.
An estimated 6 ,600,000 Californians
will vote today in one of the most
hotly contested elections in recent
history.
At stake are the Governor's and Lt.
Governor's offices, one U.S. Senate
seat, the position of State Supt. of
Public Instruction, four other high
State offices, four State Board of
Equalization places, 38 seats in the
House of Representatives, 100 State
Senate and Assembly positions, 20

State propositions, and numerous
county and local offices and measures.
The vote is expected to be between
75 and 7 8 percent of all registered
voters. Both parties are mounting
massive get-out-the-vote drives, in many
areas using large numbers of students.
Bitter Campaign
The elections bring to a close a
bitter campaign of accusations and
name-calling, deceptive advertising, and
last-minute television pleas.

ALL SYSTEMS GO—Volunteers at the Student Committee for Involvement in
Politics plan last minute campaign efforts to get out the vote today.
Incumbent Governor Ronald Reagan
appears to hold a decisive lead over
Democratic Assemblyman Jess Unruh,
despite Unruh's contention that "the
tide has changed." Recent polls give
Reagan 49 percent of the vote to
Unruh's37 percent.
The Reagan bid has depended on the
Governor's appeal to conservative
voters of both parties. In a well-run,
lavishly financed campaign, Reagan has
attempted to capitalize on the backlash
against campus violence and incidents
such as the demonstrations at President
Nixon's San Jose appearance Thursday.
Tight Budget
Unruh, operating under a tight
budget, has concentrated on
dramatizing his characterization of
Reagan as a tool of Southern California
insurance and oil interests, at one point
taking newsmen on a "field trip" to the
home of financier Henry Salvatori,
Reagan's principal backer, who forcibly
evicted the Unruh party from the
premises.
In the U.S. Senatorial race,
Congressman John V. Tunney has
opened a sizable lead of some 7 percent
over his Republican opponent, Senator
George Murphy.
The aging (68) Murphy, a leader of
the conservative faction in the Senate,
is depending on the support of
President Nixon and Vice-President
Agnew, and on the coattails of
Governor Reagan. His campaign has
suffered due to his ill health and the
disclosure of his acceptance of fees
from Technicolor, Inc. for services
rendered as an "advisor."
Anarchy
In recent weeks, Murphy partisans
have attempted to characterize Tunney
and other liberals (including Senators
George McGovern and Edmund Muskie,
former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, and former Ambassador Sargent
Shriver) as "radicals," and the voter's
choice as "between Anarchy or Law
and Order."

Tunney, the 35-year-old son of
former heavyweight champion Gene
Tunney, is depending on his
Kennedy-style charisma, a
moderate-liberal viewpoint, and a voter
reaction against Murphy's campaign
tactics. Last week Tunney accused
Murphy's campaign management firm
of hiring hippies to wave Tunney signs
and jeer during Murphy rallies.
Although Tunney appears to hold
the advantage, the effects of President
Nixon's appearance in San Jose, the
voters' reactions to the disturbances
there, and the magnitude of the
expected Reagan victory make the
outcome highly uncertain.
Kiles-Rafferty
Perhaps the closest race in today's
balloting will be that between
incumbent Max Rafferty and Wilson
Riles for the "non-partisan" office of
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction. The arch-conservative
Rafferty, long an opponent of sex
education and the classroom use of
"smutty" books such as Eldridge
Cleaver's Soul on Ice, appears to have
lost his early lead.
Riles, on the other hand, began his
campaign as a relative unknown, but
has been shown in recent polls to be at
least as strong as Rafferty. Most experts
consider the contest too close to call.
In other state races, Republican
incumbent Ed Reinecke is favored over
State Senator Alfred Alquist for the Lt.
Governor's office; Treasurer Ivy Baker
Priest leads Democratic challenger
Milton Gordon; and Houston Fluornoy,
Republican, is expected to win the
office of Controller against Democrat
Ronald Cameron. In the campaign for
Secretary of State, Republican James
Flournoy has narrowed the lead
previously held by Democrat Edmund
G. Brown, Jr., but Brown is still
favored.
Gubser Favored
In the Tenth Congressional District,
Republican incumbent Charles S.
Gubser is still favored over Democratic
"peace candidate" Stuart McLean,

despite a large number of undecided
voters. McLean is hoping for a large
turnout of student workers, but his
chances may have been hurt by a strong
reaction against the demonstrations in
San Jose Thursday, where Gubser
appeared with President Nixon.
In the 14 th State Senate District,
Clark L. Bradley, the Republican
incumbent, is expected to successfully
defend his seat against the challenge of
Democrat John B. Rutherford. In the
22 nd Assembly District, Republican
Richard D. Hayden faces former
McCarthy campaign worker J. Ken
Croft.
In a heated campaign for Santa Clara
County Sheriff, Undersheriff James M.
Geary opposes Santa Clara County
Supervisor Sam P. Delia Maggiore.
Geary maintains that "we can meet the
challenge of crime ... through
technological advances." Delia
Maggiore favors restoring "our youth's
respect for law enforcement" through
"a concentrated information-education
program."
McCloskey Favored
In San Mateo County, Republican
Congressman Paul N. McCloskey Jr. is
defending his seat against Robert
Gomperts, the Democratic nominee,
and Jack Wilson, a conservative
Republican who is conducting a
write-in campaign. Republican
Assemblyman Carl A. Britschgi opposes
Democrat Arlen Gregorio for the State
Senate.
Among the 2 0 State propositions

significant are Proposition 1, the
"Clean Water Bond Law," which

McCloskey Favored
In San Mateo County, Republican
Congressman Paul N. McCloskey Jr. is
defending his seat against Robert
Gomperts, the Democratic nominee,
and Jack Wilson, a conservative
Republican who is conducting a
write-in campaign. Republican
Assemblyman Carl A. Britschgi opposes
Democrat Arlen Gregorio for the State
Senate.
Among the 2 0 State propositions
submitted to the voters today, the most
significant are Proposition 1, the
"Clean Water Bond Law," which
provides for $250,000,000 in State
grants for pollution control facilities;
Proposition 5, which requires that
meetings of the Board of Regents of
the University of California be open to
the public; and Proposition 18, which
amends the State Constitution to allow
highway revenues to be used for
construction of mass transit, and
research and control of air pollution.
Polls will open at 7 a.m. and close at
8 p.m.
An estimated 6 ,600,000 Californians
will vote today in one of the most
hotly contested elections in recent
history.
At stake are the Governor's and Lt.
Governor's offices, one U.S. Senate
seat, the position of State Supt. of
Public Instruction, four other high
State offices, four State Board of
Equalization places, 38 seats in the
House of Representatives, 100 State
Senate and Assembly positions, 20

State propositions, and numerous
county and local offices and measures.
The vote is expected to be between
75 and 7 8 percent of all registered
voters. Both parties are mounting
massive get-out-the-vote drives, in many
areas using large numbers of students.
Bitter Campaign
The elections bring to a close a
bitter campaign of accusations and
name-calling, deceptive advertising, and
last-minute television pleas.

ALL SYSTEMS GO—Volunteers at the Student Committee for Involvement in
Politics plan last minute campaign efforts to get out the vote today.
Incumbent Governor Ronald Reagan
appears to hold a decisive lead over
Democratic Assemblyman Jess Unruh,
despite Unruh's contention that "the
tide has changed." Recent polls give
Reagan 49 percent of the vote to
Unruh's37 percent.
The Reagan bid has depended on the
Governor's appeal to conservative
voters of both parties. In a well-run,
lavishly financed campaign, Reagan has
attempted to capitalize on the backlash
against campus violence and incidents
such as the demonstrations at President
Nixon's San Jose appearance Thursday.
Tight Budget
Unruh, operating under a tight
budget, has concentrated on
dramatizing his characterization of
Reagan as a tool of Southern California
insurance and oil interests, at one point
taking newsmen on a "field trip" to the
home of financier Henry Salvatori,
Reagan's principal backer, who forcibly
evicted the Unruh party from the
premises.
In the U.S. Senatorial race,
Congressman John V. Tunney has
opened a sizable lead of some 7 percent
over his Republican opponent, Senator
George Murphy.
The aging (68) Murphy, a leader of
the conservative faction in the Senate,
is depending on the support of
President Nixon and Vice-President
Agnew, and on the coattails of
Governor Reagan. His campaign has
suffered due to his ill health and the
disclosure of his acceptance of fees
from Technicolor, Inc. for services
rendered as an "advisor."
Anarchy
In recent weeks, Murphy partisans
have attempted to characterize Tunney
and other liberals (including Senators
George McGovern and Edmund Muskie,
former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, and former Ambassador Sargent
Shriver) as "radicals," and the voter's
choice as "between Anarchy or Law
and Order."

Tunney, the 35-year-old son of
former heavyweight champion Gene
Tunney, is depending on his
Kennedy-style charisma, a
moderate-liberal viewpoint, and a voter
reaction against Murphy's campaign
tactics. Last week Tunney accused
Murphy's campaign management firm
of hiring hippies to wave Tunney signs
and jeer during Murphy rallies.
Although Tunney appears to hold
the advantage, the effects of President
Nixon's appearance in San Jose, the
voters' reactions to the disturbances
there, and the magnitude of the
expected Reagan victory make the
outcome highly uncertain.
Kiles-Rafferty
Perhaps the closest race in today's
balloting will be that between
incumbent Max Rafferty and Wilson
Riles for the "non-partisan" office of
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction. The arch-conservative
Rafferty, long an opponent of sex
education and the classroom use of
"smutty" books such as Eldridge
Cleaver's Soul on Ice, appears to have
lost his early lead.
Riles, on the other hand, began his
campaign as a relative unknown, but
has been shown in recent polls to be at
least as strong as Rafferty. Most experts
consider the contest too close to call.
In other state races, Republican
incumbent Ed Reinecke is favored over
State Senator Alfred Alquist for the Lt.
Governor's office; Treasurer Ivy Baker
Priest leads Democratic challenger
Milton Gordon; and Houston Fluornoy,
Republican, is expected to win the
office of Controller against Democrat
Ronald Cameron. In the campaign for
Secretary of State, Republican James
Flournoy has narrowed the lead
previously held by Democrat Edmund
G. Brown, Jr., but Brown is still
favored.
Gubser Favored
In the Tenth Congressional District,
Republican incumbent Charles S.
Gubser is still favored over Democratic
"peace candidate" Stuart McLean,

despite a large number of undecided
voters. McLean is hoping for a large
turnout of student workers, but his
chances may have been hurt by a strong
reaction against the demonstrations in
San Jose Thursday, where Gubser
appeared with President Nixon.
In the 14 th State Senate District,
Clark L. Bradley, the Republican
incumbent, is expected to successfully
defend his seat against the challenge of
Democrat John B. Rutherford. In the
22 nd Assembly District, Republican
Richard D. Hayden faces former
McCarthy campaign worker J. Ken
Croft.
In a heated campaign for Santa Clara
County Sheriff, Undersheriff James M.
Geary opposes Santa Clara County
Supervisor Sam P. Delia Maggiore.
Geary maintains that "we can meet the
challenge of crime ... through

Maggiore favors restoring "our youth's
