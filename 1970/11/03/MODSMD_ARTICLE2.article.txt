# California Campaigns To Be Decided Today
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
An estimated 6 ,600,000 Californians
will vote today in one of the most
hotly contested elections in recent
history.
At stake are the Governor's and Lt.
Governor's offices, one U.S. Senate
seat, the position of State Supt. of
Public Instruction, four other high
State offices, four State Board of
Equalization places, 38 seats in the
House of Representatives, 100 State
Senate and Assembly positions, 20

State propositions, and numerous
county and local offices and measures.
The vote is expected to be between
75 and 7 8 percent of all registered
voters. Both parties are mounting
massive get-out-the-vote drives, in many
areas using large numbers of students.
Bitter Campaign
The elections bring to a close a
bitter campaign of accusations and
name-calling, deceptive advertising, and
last-minute television pleas.
