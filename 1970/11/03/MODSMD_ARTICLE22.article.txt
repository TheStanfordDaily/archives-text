## Yell Leaders Sought Now 
### 
Those interested in running for
yell leader must pick up a petition
at the ASSU office this week. It
must be returned by 5 p.m.
Friday November 6. The
trial-by-fire tryouts will definitely
be held at the Washington game,
November 7. Current yell leaders
regret the bureaucracy, but beg
for clemency since they are slaves
of the system.

GETTING HIGH: Defensive guard Pete Lazetich flings himself over Beaver blockers in an effort to block an
Oregon State punt. Pete drew a lot of oohs and aahs on this one, but just missed the ball. Later, Larry
Butler did block one, setting up the Tribe for another in their flurry of second-half touchdowns. Others
rushing the kick are Benny Barnes (2 9) and Jody Graves (6 5).


OPEN FIELD—Jim Kehl, who ran
for 35 yards on five carries, bursts
into the open at right on one of
his two lengthy gains. He scored
once from the 13, and broke open
another time for 17 yards. At the
end, he was Stanford's number
rusher against Oregon State
behind Hillary Shockley. Another
crowd-pleasing runner was a dog
whose thing was chasing frisbees
tossed by the band leader. His
exact yardage totals, alas, were
not computed.

BELOW AVERAGE-Three Stanford defenders, Tom Sones (83), Phil Satre (5 2) and Bill Alexander (7 2)
join efforts in hauling down Oregon State's burly Dave Schilling (4 2). Schilling, who went into the game
trailing (JSC's Clarence Davis by a mere four yards for the Pac-8 rushing lead, was held to 63 yards in 16
carries Saturday, well below his average of 90 plus per game.
