Dance Hall Fire
SAINT LAURENT DU PONT, France (AP) - The dance
hall where 144 persons perished in a fire Sunday—most
of them youngsters stacked up in charred heaps by exits
they couldn't get out of—never got official fire
department permission to open for business, a
department inspector said Monday.
Maj. Jean Plantier, inspector in charge of fire safety
for the area, said: "No authorization to open the Cinq a
Sept dance hall to the public ever came from my office."
Officials reaffirmed that most of the emergency exits
leading from the dance hall had been locked. The main
entrance was covered by a floor-to-ceiling turnstile, like
a grill, that revolved only inward. The measures were
apparently taken to discourage gatecrashers.
It was thought that about 5 0 of the victims had been
watching a new rock group called The Storm from a
balcony overlooking the dance floor; their only way
down was two spiral staircases that allowed one person
to pass at a time.
Witnesses said the fire—possibly caused by a discarded
cigarette—consumed the interior within minutes,
spreading quickly through plastic decorations, pressed
cardboard furniture, and sound-proofing wallboards. By
regulation, they were supposed to be fireproof.

Faulty Video Tape
NEW YORK (AP) - A tape of segments of a speech by
President Nixon, supplied to the nation's television
networks by the Republican National Committee for
election eve broadcast, was so poor in quality that it
brought thousands of complaints from viewers around
the country.
Many callers said the networks were "sabotaging" the
President.
"We thought people would think that," said Richard
Salant, president of CBS News.
He said CBS had warned the Republicans in a series
of phone calls about the bad quality of the tape they
had submitted and added, "They chose to do that, and
nothing we could say would stop them."
Salant said that as a result CBS preceded its showings
with a warning to viewers that the audio was poor and
the tape was in black and white.
A CBS spokesman said that, to add to the trouble, a
leased cable failed during the broadcast and blacked out
the first four minutes of the tape to most of the
country. This included the network's disclaimer of
responsibility for the tape's quality.
