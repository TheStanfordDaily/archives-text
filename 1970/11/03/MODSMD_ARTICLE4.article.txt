# Democrats Charge Nixon Incited San Jose Incident Thursday Night
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Democrats and local labor leaders
charged President Nixon yesterday with
deliberately inciting the crowd outside
the San Jose Civic Auditorium
Thursday night and then exaggerating
accounts of the violence for political
purposes.
In addition, over the weekend, the
press and law enforcement officials
began to reassess and modify their
accounts of what actually happened
outside the auditorium during the
disturbance.
State Senator Alfred E. Alquist,
Democratic candidate for Lieutenant
Governor, issued a statement yesterday
asserting, "evidence is mounting" that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen." He called for a
grand jury investigation.
John F. Henning, executive
secretary of the California Labor
Council on Political Education,
AFL-CIO, charged "that President
Nixon personally aggravated and
provoked the San Jose students for
political purposes."
Henning also claimed that the
scenario was arranged to divert
attention from "California's record
high unemployment and runaway
inflation."
'Hoax'
Louis Bosco, president of the Santa
Clara Labor Council, leveled the
strongest attack on the Republicans. In
a news conference yesterday, he called
the disorder "a hoax" and "a
conspiracy at the highest level involving
the President, the Vice-President,
Senator Murphy and the Governor of
California."
Nixon termed the disturbance "a
stoning" late Thursday night and made
reference to it in campaign appearances
on behalf of Republican candidates in
Anaheim and Phoenix.
Governor Ronald Reagan expressed
contempt for the small band which
engaged in violence and denounced the
"ugly tactics" of the demonstrators and
their "intolerable behavior."
'Planned Attack'
Senator George Murphy called the
demonstration a "planned attack, led
by experts." He later stated that if the
crowd had been able to get at the
President's car, "Wt> (Nixon, Reagan
and Murphy) would've been torn apart
piece by piece."

San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore was widely quoted
immediately after the rally as sayin c ,
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history."
The Saturday Los Angeles Times
quoted him as saying, "How we got
him (the President) out of there 1 don't
know; it must have been a miracle."
The Associated Press reported that
Blackmore said yesterday that the
President was subject to verbal abuse
only and that only a small number of
missiles were thrown. This position is
supported by many newsmen who saw
very few objects thrown at the
motorcade.
Counteracting this are reports from
the Secret Service, White House deputy
press secretary Gerald L. Warren and
the President that rocks and eggs hit
the President's car.
The President also said that bricks
were thrown at the motorcade although
police and newsmen have found no
evidence that large missiles were
employed.
Nothing Struck
San Jose Police Captain Lewis Haller
told the Daily yesterday that he saw

eggs, a gearshift ball, car radio antennas
and windshield wipers thrown during
the disturbance. He did not see
anything strike the President's car.
Many observers felt that the
President could have been taken out
the front of the auditorium where there
were few demonstrators rather than
facing the large, hostile crowd in the
rear. The Secret Service was aware of
the situation in the rear, and reportedly
had informed the President.
Haller, who was in charge of the
police outside tho auditorium, told the
Daily yesterday that the Secret Service
would only allow the President to be
moved in his armored limousine which
was parked in the back. He said that
any attempt to move the car around to
the front would ha\e drawn the crowd
with it.
All officials agree that several of the
buses carrying members of the press
and official guests were subject to a
brief but furious attack by a group of
demonstrators as the buses left the
parking lot area. Numerous windows
were broken out by rocks and several
boards were thrown at the buses but
did little damage.
According to Santa Clara County

Sheriff's Deputy Don Tamm, Sheriff
Joseph Prelsnik was hit in the face with
a rock or dirt clod that was thrown
through an open window of his squad
car as it passed through the crowd with
the motorcade.
'Missiles Thrown'
Tamm said that he heard other things
hitting the car and that there were
dents in the vehicle when it reached the
airport. He said that missiles were being
thrown by the crowd but not in large
numbers.
A controversy has arisen as to
whether or not the security forces on
hand were adequate to control the
crowd. There were 428 police officers
assigned to various details to provide
general security for the President.
These officers were assigned to the
airport, the parking lot, the motorcade
route and the inside of the auditorium.
There were only 150 riot police
available for duty in the parking lot and
according to the Sheriff's department
they were all committed when the
motorcade left.
When asked why demonstrators
were allowed to ti._ - the parking lot,

Haller stated that the Secret Service did
not ask that the lot be kept clear. A
spokesman at the Sheriff's department
added that there were not enough men
in the area to secure the perimeter of
the parking lot and still have a
sufficient reserve force.
Although top police officials claim
that they had enough manpower to
provide adequate security, one San Jose
police sergeant indicated that prior
planning was based on a smaller
number of demonstrators. He said that
at a briefing before the rally police
officers were told to expect "a couple
of hundred" protesters.
The crowd at the rear of the
auditorium numbered between
1500-2000 persons, not all of whom
were actively involved in the protest.

Only a small number of people, as far
as can be determined, were engaged in
throwing missiles.
After the motorcade and the crowd
had left the area, Tom DeVries,
reporting for KQED-TV, walked
through the parking lot. He told the
Daily that there were very few missiles
of any type on theground in the parking
lot. This tends to indicate, DeVries
said, that there was no "hail of rocks,
bottles and bricks" as reported by some
of the news media.
Police spokesmen confirmed
yesterday that three police officers
suffered minor injuries when struck by
flying objects. A Secret Service agent
fell off the presidential limousine and
was almost run over by a following car.
When the car stopped to avoid the
officer, a minor chain-reaction accident
occurred. Another agent either fell or

was pulled off a car a few blocks away
from the parking lot. He was picked up
by a police unit.
Some demonstrators were Maced by
police, including one group of 10
persons that was standing near one of
the fire trucks and according to Dick
Stoval, an unemployed engineer who
was there, was doing nothing to
warrent a Macing. Other demonstrators
were reportedly clubbed and struck by
vehicles in this motorcade, however,
attempts to confirm this have been
unsuccessful.
Several reporters from major news
agencies have said over the weekend
that initial reports of the San Jose
disturbance were distorted and
exaggerated. President Nixon last night,
however, termed part of the San Jose
crowd a "band of violent thugs."

missiles were thrown. This position is
supported by many newsmen who saw
very few objects thrown at the
motorcade.
Counteracting this are reports from
the Secret Service, White House deputy
press secretary Gerald L. Warren and
the President that rocks and eggs hit
the President's car.
The President also said that bricks
were thrown at the motorcade although
police and newsmen have found no
evidence that large missiles were
employed.
Nothing Struck
San Jose Police Captain Lewis Haller
told the Daily yesterday that he saw

eggs, a gearshift ball, car radio antennas
and windshield wipers thrown during
the disturbance. He did not see
anything strike the President's car.
Many observers felt that the
President could have been taken out
the front of the auditorium where there
were few demonstrators rather than
facing the large, hostile crowd in the
rear. The Secret Service was aware of
the situation in the rear, and reportedly
had informed the President.
Haller, who was in charge of the
police outside tho auditorium, told the
Daily yesterday that the Secret Service
would only allow the President to be
moved in his armored limousine which
was parked in the back. He said that
any attempt to move the car around to
the front would ha\e drawn the crowd
with it.
All officials agree that several of the
buses carrying members of the press
and official guests were subject to a
brief but furious attack by a group of
demonstrators as the buses left the
parking lot area. Numerous windows
were broken out by rocks and several
boards were thrown at the buses but
did little damage.
According to Santa Clara County

Sheriff's Deputy Don Tamm, Sheriff
Joseph Prelsnik was hit in the face with
a rock or dirt clod that was thrown
through an open window of his squad
car as it passed through the crowd with
the motorcade.
'Missiles Thrown'
Tamm said that he heard other things
hitting the car and that there were
dents in the vehicle when it reached the
airport. He said that missiles were being
thrown by the crowd but not in large
numbers.
A controversy has arisen as to
whether or not the security forces on
hand were adequate to control the
crowd. There were 428 police officers
assigned to various details to provide
general security for the President.
These officers were assigned to the
airport, the parking lot, the motorcade
route and the inside of the auditorium.
There were only 150 riot police
available for duty in the parking lot and
according to the Sheriff's department
they were all committed when the
motorcade left.
When asked why demonstrators
were allowed to ti._ - the parking lot,

Haller stated that the Secret Service did
not ask that the lot be kept clear. A
spokesman at the Sheriff's department
added that there were not enough men
in the area to secure the perimeter of
the parking lot and still have a
sufficient reserve force.
Although top police officials claim
that they had enough manpower to
provide adequate security, one San Jose
police sergeant indicated that prior
planning was based on a smaller
number of demonstrators. He said that
at a briefing before the rally police
officers were told to expect "a couple
of hundred" protesters.
The crowd at the rear of the
auditorium numbered between
1500-2000 persons, not all of whom
were actively involved in the protest.

Only a small number of people, as far
as can be determined, were engaged in
throwing missiles.
After the motorcade and the crowd
had left the area, Tom DeVries,
reporting for KQED-TV, walked
through the parking lot. He told the
Daily that there were very few missiles
of any type on theground in the parking
lot. This tends to indicate, DeVries
said, that there was no "hail of rocks,
bottles and bricks" as reported by some
of the news media.
Police spokesmen confirmed
yesterday that three police officers
suffered minor injuries when struck by
flying objects. A Secret Service agent
fell off the presidential limousine and
was almost run over by a following car.
When the car stopped to avoid the
officer, a minor chain-reaction accident
occurred. Another agent either fell or

was pulled off a car a few blocks away
from the parking lot. He was picked up
by a police unit.
Some demonstrators were Maced by
police, including one group of 10
persons that was standing near one of
the fire trucks and according to Dick
Stoval, an unemployed engineer who
was there, was doing nothing to
warrent a Macing. Other demonstrators
were reportedly clubbed and struck by
vehicles in this motorcade, however,
attempts to confirm this have been
unsuccessful.
Several reporters from major news
agencies have said over the weekend
that initial reports of the San Jose
disturbance were distorted and
exaggerated. President Nixon last night,
however, termed part of the San Jose
crowd a "band of violent thugs."
Democrats and local labor leaders
charged President Nixon yesterday with
deliberately inciting the crowd outside
the San Jose Civic Auditorium
Thursday night and then exaggerating
accounts of the violence for political
purposes.
In addition, over the weekend, the
press and law enforcement officials
began to reassess and modify their
accounts of what actually happened
outside the auditorium during the
disturbance.
State Senator Alfred E. Alquist,
Democratic candidate for Lieutenant
Governor, issued a statement yesterday
asserting, "evidence is mounting" that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen." He called for a
grand jury investigation.
John F. Henning, executive
secretary of the California Labor
Council on Political Education,
AFL-CIO, charged "that President
Nixon personally aggravated and
provoked the San Jose students for
political purposes."
Henning also claimed that the
scenario was arranged to divert
attention from "California's record
high unemployment and runaway
inflation."
'Hoax'
Louis Bosco, president of the Santa
Clara Labor Council, leveled the
strongest attack on the Republicans. In
a news conference yesterday, he called
the disorder "a hoax" and "a
conspiracy at the highest level involving
the President, the Vice-President,
Senator Murphy and the Governor of
California."
Nixon termed the disturbance "a
stoning" late Thursday night and made
reference to it in campaign appearances
on behalf of Republican candidates in
Anaheim and Phoenix.
Governor Ronald Reagan expressed
contempt for the small band which
engaged in violence and denounced the
"ugly tactics" of the demonstrators and
their "intolerable behavior."
'Planned Attack'
Senator George Murphy called the
demonstration a "planned attack, led
by experts." He later stated that if the
crowd had been able to get at the
President's car, "Wt> (Nixon, Reagan
and Murphy) would've been torn apart
piece by piece."

San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore was widely quoted
immediately after the rally as sayin c ,
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history."
The Saturday Los Angeles Times
quoted him as saying, "How we got
him (the President) out of there 1 don't
know; it must have been a miracle."

There were only 150 riot police
available for duty in the parking lot and
according to the Sheriff's department
they were all committed when the
motorcade left.
When asked why demonstrators
were allowed to ti._ - the parking lot,

Haller stated that the Secret Service did
not ask that the lot be kept clear. A
spokesman at the Sheriff's department
added that there were not enough men
in the area to secure the perimeter of
the parking lot and still have a
sufficient reserve force.
Although top police officials claim
that they had enough manpower to
provide adequate security, one San Jose
police sergeant indicated that prior
planning was based on a smaller
number of demonstrators. He said that
at a briefing before the rally police
officers were told to expect "a couple
of hundred" protesters.
The crowd at the rear of the
auditorium numbered between
1500-2000 persons, not all of whom
were actively involved in the protest.

Only a small number of people, as far
as can be determined, were engaged in
throwing missiles.
After the motorcade and the crowd
had left the area, Tom DeVries,
reporting for KQED-TV, walked
through the parking lot. He told the
Daily that there were very few missiles
of any type on theground in the parking
lot. This tends to indicate, DeVries
said, that there was no "hail of rocks,
bottles and bricks" as reported by some
of the news media.
Police spokesmen confirmed
yesterday that three police officers
suffered minor injuries when struck by
flying objects. A Secret Service agent
fell off the presidential limousine and
was almost run over by a following car.
When the car stopped to avoid the
officer, a minor chain-reaction accident
occurred. Another agent either fell or

was pulled off a car a few blocks away
from the parking lot. He was picked up
by a police unit.
Some demonstrators were Maced by
police, including one group of 10
persons that was standing near one of
the fire trucks and according to Dick
Stoval, an unemployed engineer who
was there, was doing nothing to
warrent a Macing. Other demonstrators
were reportedly clubbed and struck by
vehicles in this motorcade, however,
attempts to confirm this have been
unsuccessful.
Several reporters from major news
agencies have said over the weekend
that initial reports of the San Jose
disturbance were distorted and
exaggerated. President Nixon last night,
however, termed part of the San Jose
crowd a "band of violent thugs."
Democrats and local labor leaders
charged President Nixon yesterday with
deliberately inciting the crowd outside
the San Jose Civic Auditorium
Thursday night and then exaggerating
accounts of the violence for political
purposes.
In addition, over the weekend, the
press and law enforcement officials
began to reassess and modify their
accounts of what actually happened
outside the auditorium during the
disturbance.
State Senator Alfred E. Alquist,
Democratic candidate for Lieutenant
Governor, issued a statement yesterday
asserting, "evidence is mounting" that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen." He called for a
grand jury investigation.
John F. Henning, executive
secretary of the California Labor
Council on Political Education,
AFL-CIO, charged "that President
Nixon personally aggravated and
provoked the San Jose students for
political purposes."
Henning also claimed that the
scenario was arranged to divert
attention from "California's record
high unemployment and runaway
inflation."
'Hoax'
Louis Bosco, president of the Santa
Clara Labor Council, leveled the
strongest attack on the Republicans. In
a news conference yesterday, he called
the disorder "a hoax" and "a
conspiracy at the highest level involving
the President, the Vice-President,
Senator Murphy and the Governor of
California."
Nixon termed the disturbance "a
stoning" late Thursday night and made
reference to it in campaign appearances
on behalf of Republican candidates in
Anaheim and Phoenix.
Governor Ronald Reagan expressed
contempt for the small band which
engaged in violence and denounced the
"ugly tactics" of the demonstrators and
their "intolerable behavior."
'Planned Attack'
Senator George Murphy called the
demonstration a "planned attack, led
by experts." He later stated that if the
crowd had been able to get at the
President's car, "Wt> (Nixon, Reagan
and Murphy) would've been torn apart
piece by piece."

San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore was widely quoted
immediately after the rally as sayin c ,
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history."
The Saturday Los Angeles Times
quoted him as saying, "How we got
him (the President) out of there 1 don't
know; it must have been a miracle."
The Associated Press reported that
Blackmore said yesterday that the
President was subject to verbal abuse
only and that only a small number of
missiles were thrown. This position is
supported by many newsmen who saw
very few objects thrown at the
motorcade.
Counteracting this are reports from
the Secret Service, White House deputy
press secretary Gerald L. Warren and
the President that rocks and eggs hit
the President's car.
The President also said that bricks
were thrown at the motorcade although
police and newsmen have found no
evidence that large missiles were
employed.
Nothing Struck
San Jose Police Captain Lewis Haller
told the Daily yesterday that he saw

eggs, a gearshift ball, car radio antennas
and windshield wipers thrown during
the disturbance. He did not see
anything strike the President's car.
Many observers felt that the
President could have been taken out
the front of the auditorium where there
were few demonstrators rather than
facing the large, hostile crowd in the
rear. The Secret Service was aware of
the situation in the rear, and reportedly
had informed the President.
Haller, who was in charge of the
police outside tho auditorium, told the
Daily yesterday that the Secret Service
would only allow the President to be
moved in his armored limousine which
was parked in the back. He said that
any attempt to move the car around to
the front would ha\e drawn the crowd
with it.
All officials agree that several of the
buses carrying members of the press
and official guests were subject to a
brief but furious attack by a group of
demonstrators as the buses left the
parking lot area. Numerous windows
were broken out by rocks and several
boards were thrown at the buses but
did little damage.
According to Santa Clara County

Sheriff's Deputy Don Tamm, Sheriff
Joseph Prelsnik was hit in the face with
a rock or dirt clod that was thrown
through an open window of his squad
car as it passed through the crowd with
the motorcade.
'Missiles Thrown'
Tamm said that he heard other things
hitting the car and that there were
dents in the vehicle when it reached the
airport. He said that missiles were being
thrown by the crowd but not in large
numbers.
A controversy has arisen as to
whether or not the security forces on
hand were adequate to control the
crowd. There were 428 police officers
assigned to various details to provide
general security for the President.
These officers were assigned to the
airport, the parking lot, the motorcade
route and the inside of the auditorium.
There were only 150 riot police
available for duty in the parking lot and
according to the Sheriff's department
they were all committed when the
motorcade left.

vehicles in this motorcade, however,
attempts to confirm this have been
unsuccessful.
Several reporters from major news
agencies have said over the weekend
that initial reports of the San Jose
disturbance were distorted and
exaggerated. President Nixon last night,
however, termed part of the San Jose
crowd a "band of violent thugs."
Democrats and local labor leaders
charged President Nixon yesterday with
deliberately inciting the crowd outside
the San Jose Civic Auditorium
Thursday night and then exaggerating
accounts of the violence for political
purposes.
In addition, over the weekend, the
press and law enforcement officials
began to reassess and modify their
accounts of what actually happened
outside the auditorium during the
disturbance.
State Senator Alfred E. Alquist,
Democratic candidate for Lieutenant
Governor, issued a statement yesterday
asserting, "evidence is mounting" that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen." He called for a
grand jury investigation.
John F. Henning, executive
secretary of the California Labor
Council on Political Education,
AFL-CIO, charged "that President
Nixon personally aggravated and
provoked the San Jose students for
political purposes."
Henning also claimed that the
scenario was arranged to divert
attention from "California's record
high unemployment and runaway
inflation."
'Hoax'
Louis Bosco, president of the Santa
Clara Labor Council, leveled the
strongest attack on the Republicans. In
a news conference yesterday, he called
the disorder "a hoax" and "a
conspiracy at the highest level involving
the President, the Vice-President,
Senator Murphy and the Governor of
California."
Nixon termed the disturbance "a
stoning" late Thursday night and made
reference to it in campaign appearances
on behalf of Republican candidates in
Anaheim and Phoenix.
Governor Ronald Reagan expressed
contempt for the small band which
engaged in violence and denounced the
"ugly tactics" of the demonstrators and
their "intolerable behavior."
'Planned Attack'
Senator George Murphy called the
demonstration a "planned attack, led
by experts." He later stated that if the
crowd had been able to get at the
President's car, "Wt> (Nixon, Reagan
and Murphy) would've been torn apart
piece by piece."

San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore was widely quoted
immediately after the rally as sayin c ,
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history."
The Saturday Los Angeles Times
quoted him as saying, "How we got
him (the President) out of there 1 don't
know; it must have been a miracle."
The Associated Press reported that
Blackmore said yesterday that the
President was subject to verbal abuse
only and that only a small number of
missiles were thrown. This position is
supported by many newsmen who saw
very few objects thrown at the
motorcade.
Counteracting this are reports from
the Secret Service, White House deputy
press secretary Gerald L. Warren and
the President that rocks and eggs hit
the President's car.
The President also said that bricks
were thrown at the motorcade although
police and newsmen have found no
evidence that large missiles were
employed.
Nothing Struck
San Jose Police Captain Lewis Haller
told the Daily yesterday that he saw

eggs, a gearshift ball, car radio antennas
and windshield wipers thrown during
the disturbance. He did not see
anything strike the President's car.
Many observers felt that the
President could have been taken out
the front of the auditorium where there
were few demonstrators rather than
facing the large, hostile crowd in the
rear. The Secret Service was aware of
the situation in the rear, and reportedly
had informed the President.
Haller, who was in charge of the
police outside tho auditorium, told the
Daily yesterday that the Secret Service
would only allow the President to be
moved in his armored limousine which
was parked in the back. He said that
any attempt to move the car around to
the front would ha\e drawn the crowd
with it.
All officials agree that several of the
buses carrying members of the press
and official guests were subject to a
brief but furious attack by a group of
demonstrators as the buses left the
parking lot area. Numerous windows
were broken out by rocks and several
boards were thrown at the buses but
did little damage.
According to Santa Clara County

Sheriff's Deputy Don Tamm, Sheriff
Joseph Prelsnik was hit in the face with
a rock or dirt clod that was thrown
through an open window of his squad
car as it passed through the crowd with
the motorcade.
'Missiles Thrown'
Tamm said that he heard other things
hitting the car and that there were
dents in the vehicle when it reached the
airport. He said that missiles were being
thrown by the crowd but not in large
numbers.
A controversy has arisen as to
whether or not the security forces on
hand were adequate to control the
crowd. There were 428 police officers
assigned to various details to provide
general security for the President.
These officers were assigned to the
airport, the parking lot, the motorcade
route and the inside of the auditorium.
There were only 150 riot police
available for duty in the parking lot and
according to the Sheriff's department
they were all committed when the
motorcade left.

Haller stated that the Secret Service did
not ask that the lot be kept clear. A
spokesman at the Sheriff's department
added that there were not enough men
in the area to secure the perimeter of
the parking lot and still have a
sufficient reserve force.
Although top police officials claim
that they had enough manpower to
provide adequate security, one San Jose
police sergeant indicated that prior
planning was based on a smaller
number of demonstrators. He said that
at a briefing before the rally police
officers were told to expect "a couple
of hundred" protesters.
The crowd at the rear of the
auditorium numbered between
1500-2000 persons, not all of whom
were actively involved in the protest.

Only a small number of people, as far
as can be determined, were engaged in
throwing missiles.
After the motorcade and the crowd
had left the area, Tom DeVries,
reporting for KQED-TV, walked
through the parking lot. He told the
Daily that there were very few missiles
of any type on theground in the parking
lot. This tends to indicate, DeVries
said, that there was no "hail of rocks,
bottles and bricks" as reported by some
of the news media.
Police spokesmen confirmed
yesterday that three police officers
suffered minor injuries when struck by
flying objects. A Secret Service agent
fell off the presidential limousine and
was almost run over by a following car.
When the car stopped to avoid the
officer, a minor chain-reaction accident
occurred. Another agent either fell or

was pulled off a car a few blocks away
from the parking lot. He was picked up
by a police unit.
Some demonstrators were Maced by
police, including one group of 10
persons that was standing near one of
the fire trucks and according to Dick
Stoval, an unemployed engineer who
was there, was doing nothing to
warrent a Macing. Other demonstrators
were reportedly clubbed and struck by
vehicles in this motorcade, however,
attempts to confirm this have been
unsuccessful.
