# reform or revolution?
## We Are Somewhere In Between 
### 
It's hard to be enthusiastic over this
fall's political offerings. The ballot is an
endless parade of the "lesser of two
evils" rationale familiar from the last
election. Public discussion bogs down into
a debate over unfair campaign tactics, law
and order stands, and media handling.
But for some the problem with the
election lies not with any issue or
candidate but with the entire context.
Does it matter who wins? Can any
candidate vote honestly all the time? Will
the war end soon, will civil liberties be
preserved, will our industries reach farther
and deeper for their markets and materials?
The list goes on and on, inviting even more
profound doubts.
In response though, it's difficult to form
any kind of alternative. Many of us float
on the edge of electoral politics, too
disgusted to join the Democrats but
unimpressed with anything offered by the

Left. Old politics are dressed up with
facile, Kennedyesque style. But the other
answer admits problems too. Apocalyptic
change may be necessary, but what king?
It's a murky, bottomless revolution, but we
have to face it because Washington has
failed so miserably.
Constantly we are begged to be patient,
to give peace a chance, to work hard and
expect gradual results. What revolutionaries
dream of will appear in time as the
dividends of McCarthy, Lowenstein, and
McLean accrue to us.
What kind of progress is this? It will
take decades to accomplish even the
smallest reform. Some are mirages: troops
are withdrawn, and in their place B-52's
carry out more massive raids over a larger
area in Asia. We ask for ecology (whatever
that means) and get F-310 and ad agency
outpourings.
The Left again presents itself with all its

infighting, bombings, and incredibly barren
rhetoric. The first reaction is to laugh.
"The spirit of the people is greater than the
man's technology." "All real friends unite
to defeat the real enemy." But behind it all
are the gnawing questions of present day
America: why so much wealth and still
such poverty? Why does this country try to
control the world? What are political
prisoners? Electoral politicians answer
these questions very poorly. Or more
likely, they dodge them since the polls tell
them few voters are interested in the
answers.
In the end, we are left alone. Neither
here nor there, it's hard to defend anything
but easy to attack. We feel irresponsible;
our search for a position goes on while
society festers and specious creeds flourish.
Vote, some say, and save another
generation of black schoolchildren from
incompetence of Murphy and Rafferty.

But are lightweights like Tunney and Riles
going to take us anywhere? Riles won't
even stand up for busing.
The others tell us that the movement is
all that's left. There's Mao to read with a
study group. Repression is revealed not
created, they claim. Accidental deaths are
regrettable but somehow necessary and
justifiable.
And so there's still nowhere to go. It's
not apathy, for there's an incredible
tension within us. It's not laziness—to look
at American society inspires a lot of things,
least of all inaction. So we drift on,
outraged and unsure, hurt and angry but
frustrated and helpless. We will form our
answers eventually like the rest of them,
but not it seems without a little
compromising and hedging.

The list goes on and on, inviting even more
profound doubts.
In response though, it's difficult to form
any kind of alternative. Many of us float
on the edge of electoral politics, too
disgusted to join the Democrats but
unimpressed with anything offered by the

Left. Old politics are dressed up with
facile, Kennedyesque style. But the other
answer admits problems too. Apocalyptic
change may be necessary, but what king?
It's a murky, bottomless revolution, but we
have to face it because Washington has
failed so miserably.
Constantly we are begged to be patient,
to give peace a chance, to work hard and
expect gradual results. What revolutionaries
dream of will appear in time as the
dividends of McCarthy, Lowenstein, and
McLean accrue to us.
What kind of progress is this? It will
take decades to accomplish even the
smallest reform. Some are mirages: troops
are withdrawn, and in their place B-52's
carry out more massive raids over a larger
area in Asia. We ask for ecology (whatever
that means) and get F-310 and ad agency
outpourings.
The Left again presents itself with all its

infighting, bombings, and incredibly barren
rhetoric. The first reaction is to laugh.
"The spirit of the people is greater than the
man's technology." "All real friends unite
to defeat the real enemy." But behind it all
are the gnawing questions of present day
America: why so much wealth and still
such poverty? Why does this country try to
control the world? What are political
prisoners? Electoral politicians answer
these questions very poorly. Or more
likely, they dodge them since the polls tell
them few voters are interested in the
answers.
In the end, we are left alone. Neither
here nor there, it's hard to defend anything
but easy to attack. We feel irresponsible;
our search for a position goes on while
society festers and specious creeds flourish.
Vote, some say, and save another
generation of black schoolchildren from
incompetence of Murphy and Rafferty.

But are lightweights like Tunney and Riles
going to take us anywhere? Riles won't
even stand up for busing.
The others tell us that the movement is
all that's left. There's Mao to read with a
study group. Repression is revealed not
created, they claim. Accidental deaths are
regrettable but somehow necessary and
justifiable.
And so there's still nowhere to go. It's
not apathy, for there's an incredible
tension within us. It's not laziness—to look
at American society inspires a lot of things,
least of all inaction. So we drift on,
outraged and unsure, hurt and angry but
frustrated and helpless. We will form our
answers eventually like the rest of them,
but not it seems without a little
compromising and hedging.

co-editor of the DAIL Y.)
It's hard to be enthusiastic over this
fall's political offerings. The ballot is an
endless parade of the "lesser of two
evils" rationale familiar from the last
election. Public discussion bogs down into
a debate over unfair campaign tactics, law
and order stands, and media handling.
But for some the problem with the
election lies not with any issue or
candidate but with the entire context.
Does it matter who wins? Can any
candidate vote honestly all the time? Will
the war end soon, will civil liberties be
preserved, will our industries reach farther
and deeper for their markets and materials?
The list goes on and on, inviting even more
profound doubts.
