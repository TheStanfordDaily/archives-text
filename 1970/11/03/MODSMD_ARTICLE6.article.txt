## An Unhappy But Necessary Course 
### bill freivogel margie wolf 
For some time now there has been a
large group of student political activists,
including ourselves, who have tried to
maintain a position somewhere between
that of electoral politics liberals on the one
hand, and violent revolutionaries on the
other.
When our more radical fellow-protesters
have turned to rock-throwing and
window-breaking, we have refrained from
criticizing their behavior and sought to
maintain a united front with them to
obtain common goals.
At the same time, many of us have
looked askance at those "coopted" by the
electoral system. Those who devoted their
time to McLean, Tunney or Unruh were
branded deridingly as "LIB-erals."

But as radicals have become
revolutionaries, and as the tactics of
protest have become more violent, we
radiclibs have found ourselves in the midst
of a crisis over tactics and strategy.
The old ideal of non-violent revolution
increasingly seems aa pipe dream. For the
time being, at least, protests and
demonstrations have become anathema to
most of America and have lost their use as
tools of persuasion.
Therefore, if persuasion is to work at
this time to change America, it will have to
be verbal and lawful. And if persuasion is
not to work the only road open is violent
revolution. But to choose violent
revolution is to choose the repugnant

elitiest notion that a few should command
the lives of many.
Unfortunately, the sensible course
facing us on election day-working through
the electoral system-seems particularly
unappetizing this year.
Nixon and Agnew continually appeal to
the basest political instincts in their request
that the "silent majority" elect them a
rubber stamp Congress. And, who can get
excited about voting for Kennedy-copiers
like John Tunney and Jess Unruh.
Everyone seems to be either some shade of
grey or worse.
Faced with this situation, students
unwilling to go the revolutionary route,

must decide whether to dirty their hands in
the muck or to find a glorious and pristine
repose by retreating above it. Those who
retreat may vent their frustrations in
cynicism and brand as "liberal cop-outs"
those who venture into electoral politics.
However, we cannot afford this
petualance. Retreat is an unjustifiable
luxury when so much needs to be done.
For the time being at least we must work
militantly through the system because that
is the most effective way for us to achieve
our ends.
