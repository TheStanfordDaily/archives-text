'Resident Campus'
Editor, THE DAILY:
In a story on campus
dormitories in the Daily I was
cited as questioning whether
Stanford could be considered a
resident campus when so many
students lived off-campus. What I
said, or at any rate meant to say,
was that at the beginning of its
meetings the committee to plan a

new dorm had to face the basic
question: Is Stanford or ought
Stanford to be a resident campus
or a non-resident campus like
Berkeley. I went on to say that
the committee was in agreement
that Stanford was basically a
resident community and ought to
remain so. In that spirit we
undertook to think out and work
out our "idea" for a new dorm.
I may not have made myself
sufficiently clear in the interview,

and I wanted to set the record
straight.

The headline article of the
October 30 issue of the Daily,
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade" was, in our opinion,
0

grossly exaggerated. Early in the
article, the crowd in the San Jose
parking lot was approximated at
2000 people (a fair estimate).
However, the second to last
paragraph stated "the Presidential
motorcade . . . was attacked by
almost 2000 people throwing
eggs, bottles, rocks, and boards,"
insinuating that nearly everyone
present was actively participating
in a physical attack upon the
President. We were there, and

from our view, although many
people were shouting slogans, very
few were actually throwing
anything.
Your article embodied the sort
of blatant bullshit that Spiro
spews upon the susceptible silent
majority. Such sensationalism in
reporting only serve to further
the unnecessary political
polarization that exists in the U.S.
today.

Reporter's comment: From past
experience I realize that it is
possible for widely differing
accounts of a single event to be
written by the press depending on
where the reporter was located,
what he was watching, etc. 1
admit that the paragraph
mentioned in the letter above
should not have been worded in
the manner it was. In fact, only a
part of the crowd engaged in
violent actions, not all 1500-2000
people as 1 implied.
I will stand by the main points
of my story, however, based on
what 1 saw and information from
other reporters, the Associated
Press and law enforcement
agencies.
I regret that Skerrett and
Rolston viewed my story as
"blatant bullshit" and
"sensationalism. " I feel as they do
that further polarization in the
U.S. should be avoided.

The headline article of the
October 30 issue of the Daily,
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade" was, in our opinion,
0

grossly exaggerated. Early in the
article, the crowd in the San Jose
parking lot was approximated at
2000 people (a fair estimate).
However, the second to last
paragraph stated "the Presidential
motorcade . . . was attacked by
almost 2000 people throwing
eggs, bottles, rocks, and boards,"
insinuating that nearly everyone
present was actively participating
in a physical attack upon the
President. We were there, and

from our view, although many
people were shouting slogans, very
few were actually throwing
anything.
Your article embodied the sort
of blatant bullshit that Spiro
spews upon the susceptible silent
majority. Such sensationalism in
reporting only serve to further
the unnecessary political
polarization that exists in the U.S.
today.

Reporter's comment: From past
experience I realize that it is
possible for widely differing
accounts of a single event to be
written by the press depending on
where the reporter was located,
what he was watching, etc. 1
admit that the paragraph
mentioned in the letter above
should not have been worded in
the manner it was. In fact, only a
part of the crowd engaged in
violent actions, not all 1500-2000
people as 1 implied.
I will stand by the main points
of my story, however, based on
what 1 saw and information from
other reporters, the Associated
Press and law enforcement
agencies.
I regret that Skerrett and
Rolston viewed my story as
"blatant bullshit" and
"sensationalism. " I feel as they do
that further polarization in the
U.S. should be avoided.

'Resident Campus'
Editor, THE DAILY:
In a story on campus
dormitories in the Daily I was
cited as questioning whether
Stanford could be considered a
resident campus when so many
students lived off-campus. What I
said, or at any rate meant to say,
was that at the beginning of its
meetings the committee to plan a

new dorm had to face the basic
question: Is Stanford or ought
Stanford to be a resident campus
or a non-resident campus like
Berkeley. I went on to say that
the committee was in agreement
that Stanford was basically a
resident community and ought to
remain so. In that spirit we
undertook to think out and work
out our "idea" for a new dorm.
I may not have made myself
sufficiently clear in the interview,

and I wanted to set the record
straight.
