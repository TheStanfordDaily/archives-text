# Reagan, Tunney, Riles Win: GOP Loses Legislature
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Decisive victories by John Tunney
and Wilson Riles tarnished Governor
Reagan's overwhelming reelection
yesterday.
The impact of the Governor's
500,000 vote plurality was further
diminished by the Democrats' capture
of control of both houses of the
California legislature. That gives them
the power to reapportion election
districts later this year.
With 8,936 of 21,700 precincts
reporting, the results were: Reagan
1 ,293 ,086, Unruh 1,100,111

(53%-45%); Tunney 1 ,310,857 ,
Murphy 1,052,226 (54 %-44 %); Riles
617 ,850 , Rafferty 486,410.
NBC predicted a Reagan victory at
8 :22 p.m., estimating 55 % of the total
vote for the Republican Governor. CBS
declared Reagan the victor at 9:00
p.m., and 10 minutes later predicted a
Tunney Senate victory.
In a hotly contested local race,
Congressman Charles Gubser won a
decisive victory over his democratic
opponent Stuart McLean, by a margin
of 61 % to 37 %, with 45 % of the votes
counted. And, with 38 % of the votes

counted, Berkeley City Councilman
Ronald Dellums held a slim lead over
Republican John Healy,
30 4 28 —2 9,4 3 9, for the Congressional
seat of Rep. Jeffrey Cohelan.
Congressman Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey of San Mateo County ran
up a wide winning margin—
1 4 0,0 3 4 -38,261-over Democrat
Robert Gomperts in complete
unofficial returns.
Reagan Appearance
Reagan's victory was never seriously
doubted, but Unruh refused to concede
defeat at midnight, amid shouts of
"right on" from Democratic campaign
workers.
Reagan appeared on television at
10:15 last night, but refused to
concede Murphy's defeat or claim
victory for himself. The Governor
doubted the possible influence on the
elections of the disturbances at
President Nixon's appearance at San
Jose Thursday night, but assailed those
who claimed that the incident was
exaggerated, saying that "a President of
the United States was in danger."
When asked about possible
Presidential ambitions for 1972 ,
Reagan replied, "I'll serve out a
four-year term in Sacramento. My term

is up in 1974. I haven't thought about
after that."
Tunney Victory
Senator-elect Tunney called his
victory over Nixon-supported George
Murphy "a real personal defeat for the
President." Tunney's victory was
attributed in part to his two-to-one
majority among voters under 35, his
75 % share of the Mexican-American
vote, and a reported 90 percent
majority among black voters. The

Riverside Congressman was also
considered particularly strong among
blue-collar workers and new California
residents.
Tunney attributed his victory to
Murphy's record, "the economic issue,"
the candidates' differing views on
Vietnam, and the public reaction to a
series of "really rotten ads" that
accused Tunney of standing on the side
of "Anarchy." "It was the dirtiest
campaign I've ever seen," Tunney
declared.
While jubilant Tunney supporters

Election Special

chanted, "Tunney, Tunney, Peace now,
Peace now," Senator Murphy refused
to concede defeat "until all the votes
are in and counted."
State Offices
In other statewide races, Lt.
Governor Ed Reinecke won an
overwhelming victory against
Democratic challenger Alfred Alquist;
Republican James Fluornoy defeated
Edmund G. Brown Jr. for the office of
Secretary of State in a mild upset;

Republican Houston Flournoy defeated
Democrat Ronald Cameron for the
Controller's seat; and incumbent
Treasurer Ivy Baker Priest easily
defeated Milton Gordon, a Democrat.
In the race between Charles O'Brien
and Evelle Younger for Attorney
General, O'Brien held a slim lead last
night with 30 % of the votes tabulated,
but the outcome was too close to
predict.
Statewide Congressional results were
not expected to alter the Democratic
control of the California delegation.

In the races for State Legislature
seats, the Republicans have lost control
of the State Senate and Assembly,
which they held by votes of 21-19 and
40-39.
Among the Democratic Senate gains
was the victory of Arlen Gregorio over
Carl Britschgi in San Mateo County by
a vote of approximately 9,500-8,900.
The upset appeared to throw the
Senate into a 20-20 deadlock, and the
Assembly swung into Democratic
control apparently by 41 -39.
Propositions Pass
In the 14 th State Senate District,
Republican incumbent Clark Bradley
defeated John B. Rutherford by over
1,000 votes, 7 4 00-6200.
Proposition 1, the "Clean Water
Bond scored an overwhelming
victory in early returns and will pass
with an 83% majority. Proposition 5,
requiring open meetings of the Board
of Regents of the University of
California, passed by an almost
two-to-one margin.
Proposition 18 , which called for the
use of highway revenues for mass
transit construction and air pollution
control, held a slim lead in early
returns.
