Allende Inaugurated
SANTIAGO, Chile — Salvador Allende, a
Marxist-Socialist, was inaugurated Tuesday
as president of Chile and told the people:
"We must work and produce more for Chile
and Chileans, and not for just a few."
Before a joint session of Congress,
hundreds of foreign diplomats and a
nationwide television audience, Allende
received the red, white and blue presidential
sash from his predecesor, Eduardo Frei.
Later throngs in the streets shouted out
vivas and chanted "A-llen-de, A-llen-de."
Allende, 62, who likes people to call him
"companero"—meaning companion—instead
of "your excellency," is the first
democratically elected Marxist chief of state
in the Americas. He will serve for six years as
president of this nation of 9 million people.
After promising to "safeguard and
protect the constitution and the laws of
Chile," Allende's first official act was to
supervise the swearing in of his Cabinet. Of
15 members, eight are Marxists. Of these,
three are Communists.
Los Siete Jury Out
SAN FRANCISCO — A jury deliberated for
the second day Tuesday in the trial of six
young Latin Americans charged with killing
a policeman and attempting to murder
another last year.
The six defendants were accused of
slaying Patrolman Joseph Brodnik and
wounding Patrolman Paul McGorman when
they were caught hiding burglarized
property.
Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mana
gave the jury possible conviction choices of
felony murder, lesser offenses such as
involuntary manslaughter or acquittal.
The defendants often have been called
"Los Siete de La Raza" and have been
supported at many San Francisco area
student rallies.

Indians Take Post
DAVIS — About 4 0 Indians and their
supporters took over an abandoned 640-acre
Army post west of here Tuesday and set up
a teepee.
A spokesman for the group said the
Indian occupation was to dramatize a claim
for the land and four buildings formerly
used as an Army communications center.
The Department of Health, Education
and Welfare's office of Surplus Property
Utilization in San Francisco had said
Saturday that the site was to be turned over
to the University of California's Davis
campus. The university planned to use the
land for experimental rice and range crops.
Buildings would house graduate teaching and
research in the National Center for Primate
Biology.
Indian students at UC Davis said they
hoped to create an Indian cultural center on
the acreage along with an
Indian-Mexican-American university
SALT Talks Resume
HELSINKI, Finland — U.S. and Soviet
envoys met in Helsinki today fos the first
serious talks of the third round of their
year-old strategic arms limitation talks, and
sources said the atmosphere was just as
business-like and cordial as before.
None of the issues over the Mideast, Cuba
or Berlin, which have increasingly chilled
U.S.-Soviet relations since the talks were
recessed in Vienna last August, were
mentioned in the 90-minute meeting in the
Soviet Embassy, an informed source said.
Fire Victims 9 Funeral
SAINT LAURENT DU PONT, Fiance -
Muffled sobs and piercing shrieks resounded
today through the gymnasium where funeral
services, led by leaders of four religious
faiths, were held for 142 of the victims of
the dance hall fire here.
Families of the victims massed around the

plain varnished coffins which were lined
around the simple altar marked by a cross
and four candles. No names had been placed
on 27 of the coffins and hope of identifying
the bodies of the burned and mutilated
victims was fast disappearing.
In addition to the 142 victims for which
services were held today, two others died
later in a hospital of burns bringing the
casualty total in Sunday's blaze to 14 4.
Breakdowns Common
WASHINGTON - The Public Health Service
has reported evidence suggesting nearly one
in five American adults has experienced a
nervous breakdown or felt one coming on.
In disclosing some findings it termed
surprising, the agency reported nearly 60
percent of the adult population is fidgety
and tense at times to the point of being
bothered.
The agency questioned 6,672 adults
representing the nation's 111-million
population of civilian, noninstitutional
persons between 18 and 79. Eighty-eight
percent were white; 10 percent black.
The survey found proportionately more
women than men reported nervous
breakdowns. Black women had a
significantly higher rate than white women.
Davis In Solitary
NEW YORK — The head of the Women's
House of Detention says black militant
Angela Davis is being held in solitary
confinement because, among other things,
some other prisoners do not share
"ideological beliefs."
Miss Davis, 26, is being held without bail
on a fugitive warrant from California, where
she is accused of murder and kidnapping for
furnishing the guns for a courtroom
shootout in which a judge was killed.
She was arrested Oct. 13 at a midtown
motel with wealthy black Chicagoan David
Poindexter, who was charged with harboring
a fugitive and is free in $10 0,0 0 0 bail.

Indians Take Post
DAVIS — About 4 0 Indians and their
supporters took over an abandoned 640-acre
Army post west of here Tuesday and set up
a teepee.
A spokesman for the group said the
Indian occupation was to dramatize a claim
for the land and four buildings formerly
used as an Army communications center.
The Department of Health, Education
and Welfare's office of Surplus Property
Utilization in San Francisco had said
Saturday that the site was to be turned over
to the University of California's Davis
campus. The university planned to use the
land for experimental rice and range crops.
Buildings would house graduate teaching and
research in the National Center for Primate
Biology.
Indian students at UC Davis said they
hoped to create an Indian cultural center on
the acreage along with an
Indian-Mexican-American university
SALT Talks Resume
HELSINKI, Finland — U.S. and Soviet
envoys met in Helsinki today fos the first
serious talks of the third round of their
year-old strategic arms limitation talks, and
sources said the atmosphere was just as
business-like and cordial as before.
None of the issues over the Mideast, Cuba
or Berlin, which have increasingly chilled
U.S.-Soviet relations since the talks were
recessed in Vienna last August, were
mentioned in the 90-minute meeting in the
Soviet Embassy, an informed source said.
Fire Victims 9 Funeral
SAINT LAURENT DU PONT, Fiance -
Muffled sobs and piercing shrieks resounded
today through the gymnasium where funeral
services, led by leaders of four religious
faiths, were held for 142 of the victims of
the dance hall fire here.
Families of the victims massed around the

plain varnished coffins which were lined
around the simple altar marked by a cross
and four candles. No names had been placed
on 27 of the coffins and hope of identifying
the bodies of the burned and mutilated
victims was fast disappearing.
In addition to the 142 victims for which
services were held today, two others died
later in a hospital of burns bringing the
casualty total in Sunday's blaze to 14 4.
Breakdowns Common
WASHINGTON - The Public Health Service
has reported evidence suggesting nearly one
in five American adults has experienced a
nervous breakdown or felt one coming on.
In disclosing some findings it termed
surprising, the agency reported nearly 60
percent of the adult population is fidgety
and tense at times to the point of being
bothered.
The agency questioned 6,672 adults
representing the nation's 111-million
population of civilian, noninstitutional
persons between 18 and 79. Eighty-eight
percent were white; 10 percent black.
The survey found proportionately more
women than men reported nervous
breakdowns. Black women had a
significantly higher rate than white women.
Davis In Solitary
NEW YORK — The head of the Women's
House of Detention says black militant
Angela Davis is being held in solitary
confinement because, among other things,
some other prisoners do not share
"ideological beliefs."
Miss Davis, 26, is being held without bail
on a fugitive warrant from California, where
she is accused of murder and kidnapping for
furnishing the guns for a courtroom
shootout in which a judge was killed.
She was arrested Oct. 13 at a midtown
motel with wealthy black Chicagoan David
Poindexter, who was charged with harboring
a fugitive and is free in $10 0,0 0 0 bail.
Allende Inaugurated
SANTIAGO, Chile — Salvador Allende, a
Marxist-Socialist, was inaugurated Tuesday
as president of Chile and told the people:
"We must work and produce more for Chile
and Chileans, and not for just a few."
Before a joint session of Congress,
hundreds of foreign diplomats and a
nationwide television audience, Allende
received the red, white and blue presidential
sash from his predecesor, Eduardo Frei.
Later throngs in the streets shouted out
vivas and chanted "A-llen-de, A-llen-de."
Allende, 62, who likes people to call him
"companero"—meaning companion—instead
of "your excellency," is the first
democratically elected Marxist chief of state
in the Americas. He will serve for six years as
president of this nation of 9 million people.
After promising to "safeguard and
protect the constitution and the laws of
Chile," Allende's first official act was to
supervise the swearing in of his Cabinet. Of
15 members, eight are Marxists. Of these,
three are Communists.
Los Siete Jury Out
SAN FRANCISCO — A jury deliberated for
the second day Tuesday in the trial of six
young Latin Americans charged with killing
a policeman and attempting to murder
another last year.
The six defendants were accused of
slaying Patrolman Joseph Brodnik and
wounding Patrolman Paul McGorman when
they were caught hiding burglarized
property.
Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mana
gave the jury possible conviction choices of
felony murder, lesser offenses such as
involuntary manslaughter or acquittal.
The defendants often have been called

Fire Victims 9 Funeral
SAINT LAURENT DU PONT, Fiance -
Muffled sobs and piercing shrieks resounded
today through the gymnasium where funeral
services, led by leaders of four religious
faiths, were held for 142 of the victims of
the dance hall fire here.
Families of the victims massed around the

plain varnished coffins which were lined
around the simple altar marked by a cross
and four candles. No names had been placed
on 27 of the coffins and hope of identifying
the bodies of the burned and mutilated
victims was fast disappearing.
In addition to the 142 victims for which
services were held today, two others died
later in a hospital of burns bringing the
casualty total in Sunday's blaze to 14 4.
Breakdowns Common
WASHINGTON - The Public Health Service
has reported evidence suggesting nearly one
in five American adults has experienced a
nervous breakdown or felt one coming on.
In disclosing some findings it termed
surprising, the agency reported nearly 60
percent of the adult population is fidgety
and tense at times to the point of being
bothered.
The agency questioned 6,672 adults
representing the nation's 111-million
population of civilian, noninstitutional
persons between 18 and 79. Eighty-eight
percent were white; 10 percent black.
The survey found proportionately more
women than men reported nervous
breakdowns. Black women had a
significantly higher rate than white women.
Davis In Solitary
NEW YORK — The head of the Women's
House of Detention says black militant
Angela Davis is being held in solitary
confinement because, among other things,
some other prisoners do not share
"ideological beliefs."
Miss Davis, 26, is being held without bail
on a fugitive warrant from California, where
she is accused of murder and kidnapping for
furnishing the guns for a courtroom
shootout in which a judge was killed.
She was arrested Oct. 13 at a midtown
motel with wealthy black Chicagoan David
Poindexter, who was charged with harboring
a fugitive and is free in $10 0,0 0 0 bail.
Allende Inaugurated
SANTIAGO, Chile — Salvador Allende, a
Marxist-Socialist, was inaugurated Tuesday
as president of Chile and told the people:
"We must work and produce more for Chile
and Chileans, and not for just a few."
Before a joint session of Congress,
hundreds of foreign diplomats and a
nationwide television audience, Allende
received the red, white and blue presidential
sash from his predecesor, Eduardo Frei.
Later throngs in the streets shouted out
vivas and chanted "A-llen-de, A-llen-de."
Allende, 62, who likes people to call him
"companero"—meaning companion—instead
of "your excellency," is the first
democratically elected Marxist chief of state
in the Americas. He will serve for six years as
president of this nation of 9 million people.
After promising to "safeguard and
protect the constitution and the laws of
Chile," Allende's first official act was to
supervise the swearing in of his Cabinet. Of
15 members, eight are Marxists. Of these,
three are Communists.
Los Siete Jury Out
SAN FRANCISCO — A jury deliberated for
the second day Tuesday in the trial of six
young Latin Americans charged with killing
a policeman and attempting to murder
another last year.
The six defendants were accused of
slaying Patrolman Joseph Brodnik and
wounding Patrolman Paul McGorman when
they were caught hiding burglarized
property.
Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mana
gave the jury possible conviction choices of
felony murder, lesser offenses such as
involuntary manslaughter or acquittal.
The defendants often have been called
"Los Siete de La Raza" and have been
supported at many San Francisco area
student rallies.

Indians Take Post
DAVIS — About 4 0 Indians and their
supporters took over an abandoned 640-acre
Army post west of here Tuesday and set up
a teepee.
A spokesman for the group said the
Indian occupation was to dramatize a claim
for the land and four buildings formerly
used as an Army communications center.
The Department of Health, Education
and Welfare's office of Surplus Property
Utilization in San Francisco had said
Saturday that the site was to be turned over
to the University of California's Davis
campus. The university planned to use the
land for experimental rice and range crops.
Buildings would house graduate teaching and
research in the National Center for Primate
Biology.
Indian students at UC Davis said they
hoped to create an Indian cultural center on
the acreage along with an
Indian-Mexican-American university
SALT Talks Resume
HELSINKI, Finland — U.S. and Soviet
envoys met in Helsinki today fos the first
serious talks of the third round of their
year-old strategic arms limitation talks, and
sources said the atmosphere was just as
business-like and cordial as before.
None of the issues over the Mideast, Cuba
or Berlin, which have increasingly chilled
U.S.-Soviet relations since the talks were
recessed in Vienna last August, were
mentioned in the 90-minute meeting in the
Soviet Embassy, an informed source said.
