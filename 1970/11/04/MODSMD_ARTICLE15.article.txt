# McLean's Volunteers Fall Short This Time
## 
### MIKE GRUNDY 
Few campaigns this fall depended as
heavily on student participation as
Stuart McLean's did; and the
Democratic challenger to incumbent
Charles Gubser was crushed yesterday.
Interviewed at the young liberals
campaign headquarters last night,
students who had been deeply involved
in the campaign expressed mixed
emotions. All were dismayed, some
were bitterâ€”yet a few remained
optimistic.
Bill Jordan, coordinator for the
McLean campaign, said, "The student
turnout was fair. Today's turnout was
effective, but we needed a lot more
people in the weeks before. If we get at
least 4 0 percent of the vote in this
campaign we'll have had a success."
On the reaction to McLean's defeat,
Jordan said, "The 35 people who have
worked all along for McLean are very
disappointed, but there were politically
mature enough to realize that the
defeat was very probable."
When asked how the McLean defeat
will affect student participation in
future campaigns Jordan noted, "Most
of the people who worked in campaigns
this week know that you have got to
keep at it."
Last Day Great
Cathy Cooper, student volunteer for
McLean said, "Student participation
was great the last day,' but it was
decidedly disappointing in the weeks
prior to that."
Speaking on student effectiveness,
Cooper said, "They were effective in
turning out the voters today, but there
were not enough voters to sway voters
in the weeks before elections. Students
are not different from the rest of the
population. Apathy is endemic in them
too, but the people who worked in this
campaign realize that if we don't win
this year, there's always next year,"
Cooper concluded.
Larry Diamond, manager of the
precinct operations for McLean,

commented, "Student participation for
the entire election was lousy. If the
Stanford students had turned out
anywhere near as much as they did in
the spring, we would have beaten
Charles Gubser."
Diamond added, "I hate to be bitter,
but poor turnout from colleges,
especially Stanford, was the single
greatest factor in our defeat."
When asked what the response of
student workers will be to the defeat of
McLean, Diamond said, "The reaction
will be one of grave disappointment
and bitterness towards the students
who did not help out."
Early Help Lacking
Chris Harte, campaign manager, said
of student response to the election,
"Today was fair, but it was miserable
for the rest of the campaign. The
effectiveness of today's canvassing was
dependent on the work done two
weeks before today and then there was
no one around to help," Hart said.
Commenting on today's student
response he added, "The people who
helped out in the last day or two either
don't understand that you can't
influence a political race in the last day,
or they are just easing their
consciousnesses."
"Students have an incredibly short
attention span," Harte said. "The
majority of students think they know a
lot about the electoral process, but in
fact they know less than the general
public," he added.
Just Talk
Commenting on last spring's events,
Harte said, "People complaining six
months ago did absolutely nothing.
There was a lot of loud talk about
changing the national leadership, but it
was just talk," Harte added. "Most
students now think that the system has
failed to respond, but they haven't
done anything to try it. It's very
pathetic," Hart noted.
