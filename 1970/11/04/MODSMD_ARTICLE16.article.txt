# SF Republican Rally: A View From Inside
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Over 500 precinct workers and local
Republican biggies met in San
Francisco last night to celebrate what
they felt would be a night of
(fverwhelming GOP victories in
California and across the nation.
The crowd was traditionally
republican. Many old people dressed
and talked as if it were 1950. There
were well-dressed young businessmen
and other young republicans with their
token sideburns and moustaches.
There were few representatives for
the Chicanos or the Blacks.
Confidence seemed so high that few
people bothered to watch election
returns on television. Many more
laughed and drank in the bar. Those
who did watch booed the Democrats
and Humphrey, trying to play down
these winners.
The California Club, site of the GOP
rally-club meeting, was covered with
pledges to the three R's— Reagan,
Rafferty and Reinecke. Plastic buttons
and cardboard posters told more of the
mood of the Republicans than simply
what was printed on the campaign
propaganda. All the baked beans,
chicken, and rolls in the place could
not make up for the significance of the
night's events. The GOP had not
emerged decisively victorious in
northern California.
Reagan and Reinecke were played
up big. But somehow it seemed like
looking at reels of an old football game

on film. The victory had never really
been in doubt. The Republicans were
trying to spotlight the obvious to hide
the other results of the election.
When the first conclusive results
came in about the defeat of George
Murphy, shock seemed to set in. Cries
of "Oh Jesus," and "What is America
coming to" alternated with frowns, and
gulps of double bourbon.
Riles seemed equally hard to
swallow. One backer of the Grand Old
Party blamed the Rafferty defeat on
"Chicanos who should go back to
Mexico and Blacks who should go back
to Africa."
By 10:30, most people had left,
those who stayed did not appear to be
happy. The people who remained
seemed more interested in discussion of
other things. They weie obviously sick
of the drunk MC who started every
spiel of optimism with the phrase "My
wonderful Republicans."
Some of the local candidates had
won and they were warmly received.
But the overall realization was that the
Republicans were taking a fairly typical
beating in San Francisco.
There was no way that the booze
and the local wins could overshadow a
night that wasn't so victorious. The
biggest cheer of the evening went up
for Jim Buckley's win in New York. It
seemed only appropriate in an area
where only the sure victories were won
and where most of the closes ones
seemed to have slipped away.

California and across the nation.
The crowd was traditionally
republican. Many old people dressed
and talked as if it were 1950. There
were well-dressed young businessmen
and other young republicans with their
token sideburns and moustaches.
There were few representatives for
the Chicanos or the Blacks.
Confidence seemed so high that few
people bothered to watch election
returns on television. Many more
laughed and drank in the bar. Those
who did watch booed the Democrats
and Humphrey, trying to play down
these winners.
The California Club, site of the GOP
rally-club meeting, was covered with
pledges to the three R's— Reagan,
Rafferty and Reinecke. Plastic buttons
and cardboard posters told more of the
mood of the Republicans than simply
what was printed on the campaign
propaganda. All the baked beans,
chicken, and rolls in the place could
not make up for the significance of the
night's events. The GOP had not
emerged decisively victorious in
northern California.
Reagan and Reinecke were played
up big. But somehow it seemed like
looking at reels of an old football game

on film. The victory had never really
been in doubt. The Republicans were
trying to spotlight the obvious to hide
the other results of the election.
When the first conclusive results
came in about the defeat of George
Murphy, shock seemed to set in. Cries
of "Oh Jesus," and "What is America
coming to" alternated with frowns, and
gulps of double bourbon.
Riles seemed equally hard to
swallow. One backer of the Grand Old
Party blamed the Rafferty defeat on
"Chicanos who should go back to
Mexico and Blacks who should go back
to Africa."
By 10:30, most people had left,
those who stayed did not appear to be
happy. The people who remained
seemed more interested in discussion of
other things. They weie obviously sick
of the drunk MC who started every
spiel of optimism with the phrase "My
wonderful Republicans."
Some of the local candidates had
won and they were warmly received.
But the overall realization was that the
Republicans were taking a fairly typical
beating in San Francisco.
There was no way that the booze
and the local wins could overshadow a
night that wasn't so victorious. The
biggest cheer of the evening went up
for Jim Buckley's win in New York. It
seemed only appropriate in an area
where only the sure victories were won
and where most of the closes ones
seemed to have slipped away.
Over 500 precinct workers and local
Republican biggies met in San
Francisco last night to celebrate what
they felt would be a night of
(fverwhelming GOP victories in
California and across the nation.
