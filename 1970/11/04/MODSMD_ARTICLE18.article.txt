# TV Watchers Turned Off
## Election Reveals Cynicism, Apathy 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Until election night, the
newly-established Non-Violent House
did not have a television. But last night,
no less than 15 people were crowded
into a bedroom, some staring intently
at a portable tube, others chewing
intently on brownies, but all listening
to the same thing: a guitar concert.
For those who desired to see them,
election results were periodically
superimposed on the neck of the guitar,
but, as had been the case during the
past two days, political participation
was not mandatory.
Eventually, someone turned the
channel to an up-to-the-minute
returns-and-projection station, and
nobody flinched. Nobody really cared.
"I'm pretty cynical now, after
spending a day in the rain campaigning
for Stuart McLean and coming home to
watch him get slaughtered," said Ed
Jackson, a sophomore resident of the
Non-Violent House.
Disastrous Consequences
"Even if politics is a joke," he
continued, "it has disastrous
consequences. I worked for McLean
because if he'd won, we might have
stopped killing Vietnamese faster."
Even in his abject cynicism, Ed
Jackson is an optimist compared to
most of those who viewed last night's
election returns.
A Roble coed, who was keeping
track of the returns because she wanted
to see if Wilson Riles would win his bid
for the State Superintendent of Public
Instruction, admitted that she was
"pretty apathetic."
Changing Apathy
"What would it take to bring me out
of my apathy?" she asked. "It'd take
politics to not be such a shitty business.
It'd take results that I don't see much

of now. It'd take a change in general
public opinion." It'd take a miracle.
Across the campus in Burbank, an
all-male subsidiary of Stern Hall, Henry
Kollenberg, a sophomore from Texas
got tired of studying. He joined about
13 others in the relatively quiet TV
room, and calmly watched the returns
flow in.
"There wasn't anybody I wanted to
campaign for," he began. "I was
interested in a couple of Texas races,
the Senate and the Governorship, but I
only care passingly. There just aren't
that many active people."
None Worthwhile
At the ATO House, senior geologist,
Mike Allen, was one of two people who
occupied a large television room. He
had done some work for McLean in the
primaries, and wanted to see how he
fared against his opponent, incumbent
Congressman Charles Gubser. He didn't
really care about the other races.
"I don't consider Unruh and Tunney
to be worthwhile. But I'm gratified that
Nixon's eating a lot of shit because a
lot of Senators he worked for are
getting screwed."
An exponent of political apathy,
Allen observed that he "came back to
school pissed off at politics." Since last
spring, he notices a marked decline in
political participation.
Football Distraction
"Football has probably cut into the
canvassing on Saturday afternoon," he
continued. "It detracts from political
activity."
It seems that one way to beat the
personal frustration of getting involved
in politics and still maintain a degree of
concern, is simply not to get personally
involved.
"I don't really give a damn who
wins," said Tom Goodhue of the
Non-Violent House. "But I am trying

to find out how voters are reacting to
peace candidates.
"Actually 1 care more about what
could be reflected about the people if
peace candidates won."
Goodhue, who had compiled a list
of "peace candidates," and was keeping
tabs on how they were doing, was not
always so detached from the system.
"Working for George Brown last
Spring (Brown ran against John Tunney
for the Democratic nomination to the
Senate) was like saying that I'd give the
electoral thing one more fling. Since
then, most of the work I've done has
been out of personal loyalty."
One student dryly observed that "it
appears to be a compassionate
democratic system indeed which incites
young people to cynicism and apathy
only once every two years."

"HAPPINESS IS A NEW GOVERNOR"-Well, maybe so, but Ronald Reagan
decided to stick around for another term. Better luck next time, Jess.
