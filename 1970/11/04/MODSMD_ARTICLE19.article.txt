# They Came For Victory To Gubser Celebration
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
They came to drink spiked punch,
chatter with old acquaintances, see the
man for whom they worked and
contributed, and occasionally glance at
the returns from nationwide contests
on the televisions around the room.
The sign said, "Re-elect Charlie
Gubser YOUR Congressman."
They wore "Red Hot Republican"
buttons as they sipped punch and
munched on salami and cheese.
They were white, well dressed, and
seemingly unworried, at least by the
returns of the Gubser race.
"How could a guy with a name like
Taft be losing."
"Go Buckley."
"Rafferty will pull up, just wait and
see."
They were for the most part middle
aged and established. A large number of
their blue and white "Hello" name tags
bore the title "Dr."
They were at a "Victory party" for
Congressman Charles Gubser and State
Representative Dick Hayden at the
Americana Hotel in Sunnyvale.
Americana it was.

"Why I've been a Republican all my
life and I won't change now," a 68 year
old engineer from San Jose
commented. "Gubser, Reagan, Murphy,
are the men we need."
Some fragmentary returns were
written on a chalkboard at the front of
the room. "I'm not worried," shouted
one supporter at the chalkboard writer,
"keep those totals coming."
Most of the crowd seemed oblivious
to the numbers on the board.
The Congressman entered with his
arm around an elderly woman
supporter. He sipped a glass of gin-laced
punch as he answered questions of
reporters and partisans.
"I think the press was fair, but
didn't exercise diligence in checking
out some of my opponent's press
releases. Some of his statements could
have been disproved by simple checking
up by the press, which they failed to
do."
"This wasn't my toughest race at
all," he said as he winked at a passing
familiar face, "'5B was the toughest,
what with the party split."
Bob Stewart, who said he was
unemployed and the holder of a Ph.D.
in physics asked the Congressman
about unemployment.
"People are unemployed because of
the tactics Mr. McLean advocated
months ago. The peace issue and the
total elimination of defense industry
which he wants will put people out of
work."
Stewart persisted. Gubser answered
several more questions, and then
drifted off to the "Hiya, Charlie" of a
supporter.
The punch flowed. Cheese and
salami disappeared. The candidate
mingled. The blackboard at the front
read the same numbers as it had an
hour ago.
"I can tell you though," said the
Congressman as he passed a group
glancing at a TV screen, "the
Republican Party will be a lot better
off if Rafferty gets beat."
"But Charlie, I disagree," cried a
woman nearby.
"That's okay if you disagree. Lots of
people disagree."
Gubser continued to drift. Punch
continued to flow. The people
continued to be unconcerned.

SAN JOSE MARCH—About 3 00 persons attended a rally and march in downtown
San Jose late yesterday afternoon to demonstrate support for striking GM workers
and protest the elections. There were no incidents or arrests.
They came to drink spiked punch,
chatter with old acquaintances, see the
man for whom they worked and
contributed, and occasionally glance at
the returns from nationwide contests
on the televisions around the room.
The sign said, "Re-elect Charlie
Gubser YOUR Congressman."
They wore "Red Hot Republican"
buttons as they sipped punch and
munched on salami and cheese.
They were white, well dressed, and
seemingly unworried, at least by the
returns of the Gubser race.
"How could a guy with a name like
Taft be losing."
"Go Buckley."
"Rafferty will pull up, just wait and
see."
They were for the most part middle
aged and established. A large number of
their blue and white "Hello" name tags
bore the title "Dr."
They were at a "Victory party" for
Congressman Charles Gubser and State
Representative Dick Hayden at the
Americana Hotel in Sunnyvale.
Americana it was.

"Why I've been a Republican all my
life and I won't change now," a 68 year
old engineer from San Jose
commented. "Gubser, Reagan, Murphy,
are the men we need."
Some fragmentary returns were
written on a chalkboard at the front of
the room. "I'm not worried," shouted
one supporter at the chalkboard writer,
"keep those totals coming."
Most of the crowd seemed oblivious
to the numbers on the board.
The Congressman entered with his
arm around an elderly woman
supporter. He sipped a glass of gin-laced
punch as he answered questions of
reporters and partisans.
"I think the press was fair, but
didn't exercise diligence in checking
out some of my opponent's press
releases. Some of his statements could
have been disproved by simple checking
up by the press, which they failed to
do."
"This wasn't my toughest race at
all," he said as he winked at a passing
familiar face, "'5B was the toughest,
what with the party split."
Bob Stewart, who said he was
unemployed and the holder of a Ph.D.
in physics asked the Congressman
about unemployment.
"People are unemployed because of
the tactics Mr. McLean advocated
months ago. The peace issue and the
total elimination of defense industry
which he wants will put people out of
work."
Stewart persisted. Gubser answered
several more questions, and then
drifted off to the "Hiya, Charlie" of a
supporter.
The punch flowed. Cheese and
salami disappeared. The candidate
mingled. The blackboard at the front
read the same numbers as it had an
hour ago.
"I can tell you though," said the
Congressman as he passed a group
glancing at a TV screen, "the
Republican Party will be a lot better
off if Rafferty gets beat."
"But Charlie, I disagree," cried a
woman nearby.
"That's okay if you disagree. Lots of
people disagree."
Gubser continued to drift. Punch
continued to flow. The people
continued to be unconcerned.
