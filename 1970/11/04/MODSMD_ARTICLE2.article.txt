# Moderate Gains For GOP; Demos Hold House, Senate
## 
### ED KOHN 
President Nixon and the Republican
Party achieved some stunning upsets in
yesterday's elections, but the
Democrats were able to maintain
control over both houses of Congress
and to roll up substantial gains in the
governors' mansions.
The two biggest GOP upsets were
the defeats of Sens. Albert Gore (see
related story) and Joseph Tydings. The
Gore election was seen by the
administration as the acid test for its
"Southern Strategy."
And, much to the obvious pleasure
of the White House, James L. Buckley,
a Conservative Party candidate for the
Senate seat now held by liberal
Republican Sen. Charles Goodell,
defeated Goodell and another liberal,
Democratic Rep. Richard Ottinger, in a
tight three-way race.
GOP Gains Two
Overall returns show that the
Republicans gained two seats—not the
seven the President was originally
hoping for—in the Senate. The
Democrats won 20 of the 35 seats up
for election, bringing their total to 5 2
and giving them an obvious majority.
In the House, the Democrats gained
at least four seats, increasing their
majority.
The Democrats took over
governorships now held by Republicans
in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida,
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico and
Wisconsin. Republicans claimed two
state houses now claimed by the
Democrats in Connecticut and
Tennessee.
The Democrats now control 30
governorships pending final results.
Turnout Average
Voter turnout was about average for
midterm elections as slightly more than
55 million people cast their ballots.
One of the heaviest turnouts was in
New York, where 8 0 percent of the
registered voters participated in the
election, possibly spurred by interest in
the Buckley-Goodell-Ottinger race.
Here are the results of some of the
more important contests:
—In New York, Nelson Rockefeller
was reelected to an unprecedented
fourth term, defeating Democrat
Arthur J. Goldberg. (See related story.)
—In Connecticut, Rep. Lowell
Weicker, a conservative Republican,
defeated Sen. Thomas Dodd and Rev.
Joseph Duffey, national chairman of
the Americans for Democratic Action.
Dodd ran as an independent after
failing to capture the Democratic
nomination; Duffey ran as a Democrat
aided by many students. A Republican
governor was also elected.
Tunney Downs Murphy
Democratic Rep. John V. Tunney
defeated Sen. George Murphy for the
California Senate seat, despite an
all-out effort by President Nixon, his
family and his advisors.
-Democrat Adlai Stevenson 111
captured a Republican-held Senate seat
in Illinois, defeating law-and-order
advocate Sen. Ralph Smith. (See
related story.)
Democratic Sen. Vance Hartke
• Ii d hy Republican Rep. Richard

Roudebush to win reelection. Hartke
had been selected as a major target by
administration campaigners. (See
related story.)
—Republican Congressman Robert
Taft Jr. apparently defeated Democrat
Howard M. Metzenbaum for a Senate
seat from Ohio. (See related story.)
—In the administration's two major
upsets, William E. Brock III defeated
Sen. Albert Gore, while J. Glenn Beall
Jr. defeated Sen. Joseph Tydings. The
National Rifle Association and other
large interests had also worked for
Tydings' defeat.
Kennedy, Muskie Victors
—Presidential aspirants Ted Kennedy
and Ed Muskie were both returned to
the Senate with margins of about 60
percent. (See related story.) Hubert
Humphrey was also elected to the
Senate, as he defeated Rep. Clark
McGregor in a Minnesota contest.
—Sens. Philip Hart and William
Proxmire, from the Midwest, were
reelected without much difficulty,
while Nebraska's Roman Hruska
apparently won by the slimmest of
margins.
—Democrats Quentin Burdick and
Frank Moss, both Nixon targets,
withstood strong Republican challenges
and were reelected.
—George Wallace demolished all
opposition to win reelection as
governor of Alabama; he attracted 78
percent of the vote.
—In Arkansas, Dale Bumpers, a
moderate Democrat, defeated
Republican Winthrop Rockefeller.
Democrats Capture Florida
—In Florida, despite extensive
campaigning by both the President and
the Vice President, Democrats captured
both the Senate seat and the
governorship.
—Howard Cannon, Hiram Fong, Joe
Montoya, Henry Jackson and Gale
McGee were all reelected to the Senate,
Cannon and McGee withstanding heavy
Presidential campaigning.
—And last, but certainly not least,
Charlie Gubser maintained his iron
clasp on Santa Clara County and
vicinity, winning a landslide victory
over Rev. Stuart McLean.
Gore Upset
In what the Nixon administration
regarded as the prime test of its
"Southern Strategy," Rep. William E.
Brock III upset Sen. Albert Gore, an
18-year veteran, by a margin of only
two percent.
Tennessee Republicans also captured
the governorship, as Winfield Dunn, a
political newcomer, defeated John J.
Hocker Jr., his Democratic opponent.
Dunn will be the first GOP governor in
more than 5 0 years.
Gore was a consistent critic of the
President's Vietnam policies and was
considered by the Vice President to be
the "chairman of the Southern wing of
the Eastern Liberal Establishment."
Gore saw himself as the number one
target of the administration's
campaigning, as Brock received heavy
support from both the President and
the Vice President.

The heir to a multi-million dollar
candy manufacturing fortune, Brock
campaigned extremely hard, stressing
his support for the President and his
policies.
Presidential Timber
George Wallace, American
Independent Party presidential
candidate in 1968 , was reelected
governor of Alabama with 78 percent
of the vote, thus reasserting himself as a
strong Southern political force. He
defeated several other candidates,
including a black dentist running on a
reform Democratic ticket.
Hubert H. Humphrey, 1968
Democratic Party nominees, defeated

Clark McGregor for the Minnesota
Senate seat by capturing 5 6 percent of
the vote, the same percentage he won
when he carried the state in the 1968
presidential election. Wendell Anderson
was elected governor of the state, riding
strongly on titular party head HHH's
coattails.
In Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy won
reelection to the Senate with 60
percent of the vote. Earlier, hehad said
he would need at least that much of a
margin to achieve a "moral victory." In
1964 , before Chappaquidick, Kennedy
was elected with nearly 7 4 percent of
the vote.
Ed Muskie, who had said he needed
65 percent of the vote to achieve his
"moral victory," fell short—he was

could no longer change.
reelected with about 61 percent of the
vote, some six percentage points fewer
than when Maine sent him to the
Senate in 1964.
Hartke Ekes Victory
One of the dirtiest campaigns in the
election has resulted in one of the
closest outcomes, as Democratic Sen.
Vance Hartke squeaked by Republican
Rep. Richard Roudebush to win
reelection. Hartke won with only 5 0.1
percent of the vote.
During the course of the campaign,
Roudebush, a staunch conservative,
accused Hartke, who generally votes as
a liberal, of giving (loaded) M-16 rifles
to Viet Cong soldiers. He reportedly
also hired "hippie-types" to litter
roadsides with Hartke literature.
Hartke retorted by claiming that
Roudebush has been married four
times, instead of twice, as Roudebush
has repeatedly said.
NY Moves Right
Conservatives triumphed in New
York last night as James Buckley, with
tacit Nixon administration support,
won a tight three-way Senate race and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, leaning to the
right of his former political stance, was
elected overwhelmingly to an
unprecedented fourth term.
Buckley, running on the
Conservative Party ticket, edged out
Sen. Charles Goodell, dubbed a
"radical-liberal" by Vice President
Agnew, and Democratic Rep. Richard
Ottinger, another liberal.
Rockefeller won a landslide victory
over former Supreme Court Justice and
United Nations Ambassador Arthur J.
(loMh«irrt •» tnnrrtimn lilvril Ur>mnrfit

Rockefeller received 5 4 percent of the
vote to Goldberg's 41 percent.
Rockefeller moved progressively to
the right as the campaign wore on. He
split publically with New York mayor
John V. Lindsay over many stances
taken by leading Republican Party
figures and had said privately that
Goodell could never win.
Late results showed Buckley won
with nearly 40 percent of the vote, as
Ottinger and Goodell neatly split the
liberal, anti-war vote in the nation's
second most populous state. Younger
brother of nationally-syndicated
columnist William F. Buckley Jr.,
Buckley received support from the Vice
President when he was fund raising
there some three weeks ago.
In The Family
Republican Robert Taft Jr.
apparently narrowly defeated
Democrat Howard M. Metzenbaum for
the Ohio Senate seat previously held by
Stephen M. Young Jr. Taft managed to
accumulate 51 percent of the vote.
Taft is a strong Nixon supporter. He
received White House help during the
campaign.
Metzenbaum, a political unknown,
ran a totally television-oriented primary
campaign to defeat astronaut-turned
politician John Glenn Jr. Before
becoming a Senatorial candidate, he
served as a campaign manager for
Young.
Another famous political name was
in the limelight last night as Adlai
Stevenson 111 defeated incumbent
Republican Sen. Ralph Smith in
Illinois. Smith ran a tough
law-and-order campaign, and had
attempted to Uig Stevenson as
"permissive." Like Taft, he received
<;(rnno snnnort from (he President.

President Nixon and the Republican
Party achieved some stunning upsets in
yesterday's elections, but the
Democrats were able to maintain
control over both houses of Congress
and to roll up substantial gains in the
governors' mansions.
The two biggest GOP upsets were
the defeats of Sens. Albert Gore (see
related story) and Joseph Tydings. The
Gore election was seen by the
administration as the acid test for its
"Southern Strategy."
And, much to the obvious pleasure
of the White House, James L. Buckley,
a Conservative Party candidate for the
Senate seat now held by liberal
Republican Sen. Charles Goodell,
defeated Goodell and another liberal,
Democratic Rep. Richard Ottinger, in a
tight three-way race.
GOP Gains Two
Overall returns show that the
Republicans gained two seats—not the
seven the President was originally
hoping for—in the Senate. The
Democrats won 20 of the 35 seats up
for election, bringing their total to 5 2
and giving them an obvious majority.
In the House, the Democrats gained
at least four seats, increasing their
majority.
The Democrats took over
governorships now held by Republicans
in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida,
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico and
Wisconsin. Republicans claimed two
state houses now claimed by the
Democrats in Connecticut and
Tennessee.
The Democrats now control 30
governorships pending final results.
Turnout Average
Voter turnout was about average for
midterm elections as slightly more than
55 million people cast their ballots.
One of the heaviest turnouts was in
New York, where 8 0 percent of the
registered voters participated in the
election, possibly spurred by interest in
the Buckley-Goodell-Ottinger race.
Here are the results of some of the
more important contests:
—In New York, Nelson Rockefeller
was reelected to an unprecedented
fourth term, defeating Democrat
Arthur J. Goldberg. (See related story.)
—In Connecticut, Rep. Lowell
Weicker, a conservative Republican,
defeated Sen. Thomas Dodd and Rev.
Joseph Duffey, national chairman of
the Americans for Democratic Action.

Gore Upset
In what the Nixon administration
regarded as the prime test of its
"Southern Strategy," Rep. William E.
Brock III upset Sen. Albert Gore, an
18-year veteran, by a margin of only
two percent.
Tennessee Republicans also captured
the governorship, as Winfield Dunn, a
political newcomer, defeated John J.
Hocker Jr., his Democratic opponent.
Dunn will be the first GOP governor in
more than 5 0 years.
Gore was a consistent critic of the
President's Vietnam policies and was
considered by the Vice President to be
the "chairman of the Southern wing of
the Eastern Liberal Establishment."
Gore saw himself as the number one
target of the administration's
campaigning, as Brock received heavy
support from both the President and
the Vice President.

The heir to a multi-million dollar
candy manufacturing fortune, Brock
campaigned extremely hard, stressing
his support for the President and his
policies.
Presidential Timber
George Wallace, American
Independent Party presidential
candidate in 1968 , was reelected
governor of Alabama with 78 percent
of the vote, thus reasserting himself as a
strong Southern political force. He
defeated several other candidates,
including a black dentist running on a
reform Democratic ticket.
Hubert H. Humphrey, 1968
Democratic Party nominees, defeated

Clark McGregor for the Minnesota
Senate seat by capturing 5 6 percent of
the vote, the same percentage he won
when he carried the state in the 1968
presidential election. Wendell Anderson
was elected governor of the state, riding
strongly on titular party head HHH's
coattails.
In Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy won
reelection to the Senate with 60
percent of the vote. Earlier, hehad said
he would need at least that much of a
margin to achieve a "moral victory." In
1964 , before Chappaquidick, Kennedy
was elected with nearly 7 4 percent of
the vote.
Ed Muskie, who had said he needed
65 percent of the vote to achieve his
"moral victory," fell short—he was

reelected with about 61 percent of the
vote, some six percentage points fewer
than when Maine sent him to the
Senate in 1964.
Hartke Ekes Victory
One of the dirtiest campaigns in the
election has resulted in one of the
closest outcomes, as Democratic Sen.
Vance Hartke squeaked by Republican
Rep. Richard Roudebush to win
reelection. Hartke won with only 5 0.1
percent of the vote.
During the course of the campaign,
Roudebush, a staunch conservative,
accused Hartke, who generally votes as
a liberal, of giving (loaded) M-16 rifles
to Viet Cong soldiers. He reportedly
also hired "hippie-types" to litter
roadsides with Hartke literature.
Hartke retorted by claiming that
Roudebush has been married four
times, instead of twice, as Roudebush
has repeatedly said.
NY Moves Right
Conservatives triumphed in New
York last night as James Buckley, with
tacit Nixon administration support,
won a tight three-way Senate race and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, leaning to the
right of his former political stance, was
elected overwhelmingly to an
unprecedented fourth term.
Buckley, running on the
Conservative Party ticket, edged out
Sen. Charles Goodell, dubbed a
"radical-liberal" by Vice President
Agnew, and Democratic Rep. Richard
Ottinger, another liberal.
Rockefeller won a landslide victory
over former Supreme Court Justice and
United Nations Ambassador Arthur J.
(loMh«irrt •» tnnrrtimn lilvril Ur>mnrfit

Rockefeller received 5 4 percent of the
vote to Goldberg's 41 percent.
Rockefeller moved progressively to
the right as the campaign wore on. He
split publically with New York mayor
John V. Lindsay over many stances
taken by leading Republican Party
figures and had said privately that
Goodell could never win.
Late results showed Buckley won
with nearly 40 percent of the vote, as
Ottinger and Goodell neatly split the
liberal, anti-war vote in the nation's
second most populous state. Younger
brother of nationally-syndicated
columnist William F. Buckley Jr.,
Buckley received support from the Vice
President when he was fund raising
there some three weeks ago.
In The Family
Republican Robert Taft Jr.
apparently narrowly defeated
Democrat Howard M. Metzenbaum for
the Ohio Senate seat previously held by
Stephen M. Young Jr. Taft managed to
accumulate 51 percent of the vote.
Taft is a strong Nixon supporter. He
received White House help during the
campaign.
Metzenbaum, a political unknown,
ran a totally television-oriented primary
campaign to defeat astronaut-turned
politician John Glenn Jr. Before
becoming a Senatorial candidate, he
served as a campaign manager for
Young.
Another famous political name was
in the limelight last night as Adlai
Stevenson 111 defeated incumbent
Republican Sen. Ralph Smith in
Illinois. Smith ran a tough
law-and-order campaign, and had
attempted to Uig Stevenson as
"permissive." Like Taft, he received
<;(rnno snnnort from (he President.
President Nixon and the Republican
Party achieved some stunning upsets in
yesterday's elections, but the
Democrats were able to maintain
control over both houses of Congress
and to roll up substantial gains in the
governors' mansions.
The two biggest GOP upsets were
the defeats of Sens. Albert Gore (see
related story) and Joseph Tydings. The
Gore election was seen by the
administration as the acid test for its
"Southern Strategy."
And, much to the obvious pleasure
of the White House, James L. Buckley,
a Conservative Party candidate for the
Senate seat now held by liberal
Republican Sen. Charles Goodell,
defeated Goodell and another liberal,
Democratic Rep. Richard Ottinger, in a
tight three-way race.
GOP Gains Two
Overall returns show that the
Republicans gained two seats—not the
seven the President was originally
hoping for—in the Senate. The
Democrats won 20 of the 35 seats up
for election, bringing their total to 5 2
and giving them an obvious majority.
In the House, the Democrats gained
at least four seats, increasing their
majority.
The Democrats took over
governorships now held by Republicans
in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida,
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico and
Wisconsin. Republicans claimed two
state houses now claimed by the
Democrats in Connecticut and
Tennessee.
The Democrats now control 30
governorships pending final results.
Turnout Average
Voter turnout was about average for
midterm elections as slightly more than
55 million people cast their ballots.
One of the heaviest turnouts was in
New York, where 8 0 percent of the
registered voters participated in the
election, possibly spurred by interest in
the Buckley-Goodell-Ottinger race.
Here are the results of some of the
more important contests:
—In New York, Nelson Rockefeller
was reelected to an unprecedented
fourth term, defeating Democrat
Arthur J. Goldberg. (See related story.)
—In Connecticut, Rep. Lowell
Weicker, a conservative Republican,
defeated Sen. Thomas Dodd and Rev.
Joseph Duffey, national chairman of
the Americans for Democratic Action.
Dodd ran as an independent after
failing to capture the Democratic
nomination; Duffey ran as a Democrat
aided by many students. A Republican
governor was also elected.

Presidential campaigning.

Gore Upset
In what the Nixon administration
regarded as the prime test of its
"Southern Strategy," Rep. William E.
Brock III upset Sen. Albert Gore, an
18-year veteran, by a margin of only
two percent.
Tennessee Republicans also captured
the governorship, as Winfield Dunn, a
political newcomer, defeated John J.
Hocker Jr., his Democratic opponent.
Dunn will be the first GOP governor in
more than 5 0 years.
Gore was a consistent critic of the
President's Vietnam policies and was
considered by the Vice President to be
the "chairman of the Southern wing of
the Eastern Liberal Establishment."
Gore saw himself as the number one
target of the administration's
campaigning, as Brock received heavy
support from both the President and
the Vice President.

The heir to a multi-million dollar
candy manufacturing fortune, Brock
campaigned extremely hard, stressing
his support for the President and his
policies.
Presidential Timber
George Wallace, American
Independent Party presidential
candidate in 1968 , was reelected
governor of Alabama with 78 percent
of the vote, thus reasserting himself as a
strong Southern political force. He
defeated several other candidates,
including a black dentist running on a
reform Democratic ticket.
Hubert H. Humphrey, 1968
Democratic Party nominees, defeated

Clark McGregor for the Minnesota
Senate seat by capturing 5 6 percent of
the vote, the same percentage he won
when he carried the state in the 1968
presidential election. Wendell Anderson
was elected governor of the state, riding
strongly on titular party head HHH's
coattails.
In Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy won
reelection to the Senate with 60
percent of the vote. Earlier, hehad said
he would need at least that much of a
margin to achieve a "moral victory." In
1964 , before Chappaquidick, Kennedy
was elected with nearly 7 4 percent of
the vote.
Ed Muskie, who had said he needed
65 percent of the vote to achieve his
"moral victory," fell short—he was

reelected with about 61 percent of the
vote, some six percentage points fewer
than when Maine sent him to the
Senate in 1964.
Hartke Ekes Victory
One of the dirtiest campaigns in the
election has resulted in one of the
closest outcomes, as Democratic Sen.
Vance Hartke squeaked by Republican
Rep. Richard Roudebush to win
reelection. Hartke won with only 5 0.1
percent of the vote.
During the course of the campaign,
Roudebush, a staunch conservative,
accused Hartke, who generally votes as
a liberal, of giving (loaded) M-16 rifles
to Viet Cong soldiers. He reportedly
also hired "hippie-types" to litter
roadsides with Hartke literature.
Hartke retorted by claiming that
Roudebush has been married four
times, instead of twice, as Roudebush
has repeatedly said.
NY Moves Right
Conservatives triumphed in New
York last night as James Buckley, with
tacit Nixon administration support,
won a tight three-way Senate race and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, leaning to the
right of his former political stance, was
elected overwhelmingly to an
unprecedented fourth term.
Buckley, running on the
Conservative Party ticket, edged out
Sen. Charles Goodell, dubbed a
"radical-liberal" by Vice President
Agnew, and Democratic Rep. Richard
Ottinger, another liberal.
Rockefeller won a landslide victory
over former Supreme Court Justice and
United Nations Ambassador Arthur J.
(loMh«irrt •» tnnrrtimn lilvril Ur>mnrfit

Rockefeller received 5 4 percent of the
vote to Goldberg's 41 percent.
Rockefeller moved progressively to
the right as the campaign wore on. He
split publically with New York mayor
John V. Lindsay over many stances
taken by leading Republican Party
figures and had said privately that
Goodell could never win.
Late results showed Buckley won
with nearly 40 percent of the vote, as
Ottinger and Goodell neatly split the
liberal, anti-war vote in the nation's
second most populous state. Younger
brother of nationally-syndicated
columnist William F. Buckley Jr.,
Buckley received support from the Vice
President when he was fund raising
there some three weeks ago.
In The Family
Republican Robert Taft Jr.
apparently narrowly defeated
Democrat Howard M. Metzenbaum for
the Ohio Senate seat previously held by
Stephen M. Young Jr. Taft managed to
accumulate 51 percent of the vote.
Taft is a strong Nixon supporter. He
received White House help during the
campaign.
Metzenbaum, a political unknown,
ran a totally television-oriented primary
campaign to defeat astronaut-turned
politician John Glenn Jr. Before
becoming a Senatorial candidate, he
served as a campaign manager for
Young.
Another famous political name was
in the limelight last night as Adlai
Stevenson 111 defeated incumbent
Republican Sen. Ralph Smith in
Illinois. Smith ran a tough
law-and-order campaign, and had
attempted to Uig Stevenson as
"permissive." Like Taft, he received

President Nixon and the Republican
Party achieved some stunning upsets in
yesterday's elections, but the
Democrats were able to maintain
control over both houses of Congress
and to roll up substantial gains in the
governors' mansions.
The two biggest GOP upsets were
the defeats of Sens. Albert Gore (see
related story) and Joseph Tydings. The
Gore election was seen by the
administration as the acid test for its
"Southern Strategy."
And, much to the obvious pleasure
of the White House, James L. Buckley,
a Conservative Party candidate for the
Senate seat now held by liberal
Republican Sen. Charles Goodell,
defeated Goodell and another liberal,
Democratic Rep. Richard Ottinger, in a
tight three-way race.
GOP Gains Two
Overall returns show that the
Republicans gained two seats—not the
seven the President was originally
hoping for—in the Senate. The
Democrats won 20 of the 35 seats up
for election, bringing their total to 5 2
and giving them an obvious majority.
In the House, the Democrats gained
at least four seats, increasing their
majority.
The Democrats took over
governorships now held by Republicans
in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida,
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico and
Wisconsin. Republicans claimed two
state houses now claimed by the
Democrats in Connecticut and
Tennessee.
The Democrats now control 30
governorships pending final results.
Turnout Average
Voter turnout was about average for
midterm elections as slightly more than
55 million people cast their ballots.
One of the heaviest turnouts was in
New York, where 8 0 percent of the
registered voters participated in the
election, possibly spurred by interest in
the Buckley-Goodell-Ottinger race.
Here are the results of some of the
more important contests:
—In New York, Nelson Rockefeller
was reelected to an unprecedented
fourth term, defeating Democrat
Arthur J. Goldberg. (See related story.)
—In Connecticut, Rep. Lowell
Weicker, a conservative Republican,
defeated Sen. Thomas Dodd and Rev.
Joseph Duffey, national chairman of
the Americans for Democratic Action.
Dodd ran as an independent after
failing to capture the Democratic
nomination; Duffey ran as a Democrat
aided by many students. A Republican
governor was also elected.
Tunney Downs Murphy
Democratic Rep. John V. Tunney
defeated Sen. George Murphy for the
California Senate seat, despite an
all-out effort by President Nixon, his
family and his advisors.
-Democrat Adlai Stevenson 111
captured a Republican-held Senate seat
in Illinois, defeating law-and-order
advocate Sen. Ralph Smith. (See

seat from Ohio. (See related story.)

upsets, William E. Brock III defeated
Sen. Albert Gore, while J. Glenn Beall
Jr. defeated Sen. Joseph Tydings. The
National Rifle Association and other
large interests had also worked for
Tydings' defeat.
Kennedy, Muskie Victors
—Presidential aspirants Ted Kennedy
and Ed Muskie were both returned to
the Senate with margins of about 60
percent. (See related story.) Hubert
Humphrey was also elected to the
Senate, as he defeated Rep. Clark
McGregor in a Minnesota contest.
—Sens. Philip Hart and William
Proxmire, from the Midwest, were
reelected without much difficulty,
while Nebraska's Roman Hruska
apparently won by the slimmest of
margins.
—Democrats Quentin Burdick and
Frank Moss, both Nixon targets,
withstood strong Republican challenges
and were reelected.
—George Wallace demolished all
opposition to win reelection as
governor of Alabama; he attracted 78
percent of the vote.
—In Arkansas, Dale Bumpers, a
moderate Democrat, defeated
Republican Winthrop Rockefeller.
Democrats Capture Florida
—In Florida, despite extensive
campaigning by both the President and
the Vice President, Democrats captured
both the Senate seat and the
governorship.
—Howard Cannon, Hiram Fong, Joe
Montoya, Henry Jackson and Gale
McGee were all reelected to the Senate,

reelected with about 61 percent of the
vote, some six percentage points fewer
than when Maine sent him to the
Senate in 1964.
Hartke Ekes Victory
One of the dirtiest campaigns in the
election has resulted in one of the
closest outcomes, as Democratic Sen.
Vance Hartke squeaked by Republican
Rep. Richard Roudebush to win
reelection. Hartke won with only 5 0.1
percent of the vote.
During the course of the campaign,
Roudebush, a staunch conservative,
accused Hartke, who generally votes as
a liberal, of giving (loaded) M-16 rifles
to Viet Cong soldiers. He reportedly
also hired "hippie-types" to litter
roadsides with Hartke literature.
Hartke retorted by claiming that
Roudebush has been married four
times, instead of twice, as Roudebush
has repeatedly said.
NY Moves Right
Conservatives triumphed in New
York last night as James Buckley, with
tacit Nixon administration support,
won a tight three-way Senate race and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, leaning to the
right of his former political stance, was
elected overwhelmingly to an
unprecedented fourth term.
Buckley, running on the
Conservative Party ticket, edged out
Sen. Charles Goodell, dubbed a
"radical-liberal" by Vice President
Agnew, and Democratic Rep. Richard
Ottinger, another liberal.
Rockefeller won a landslide victory
over former Supreme Court Justice and
United Nations Ambassador Arthur J.
(loMh«irrt •» tnnrrtimn lilvril Ur>mnrfit

Rockefeller received 5 4 percent of the
vote to Goldberg's 41 percent.
Rockefeller moved progressively to
the right as the campaign wore on. He
split publically with New York mayor
John V. Lindsay over many stances
taken by leading Republican Party
figures and had said privately that
Goodell could never win.
Late results showed Buckley won
with nearly 40 percent of the vote, as
Ottinger and Goodell neatly split the
liberal, anti-war vote in the nation's
second most populous state. Younger
brother of nationally-syndicated
columnist William F. Buckley Jr.,
Buckley received support from the Vice
President when he was fund raising
there some three weeks ago.
In The Family
Republican Robert Taft Jr.
apparently narrowly defeated
Democrat Howard M. Metzenbaum for
the Ohio Senate seat previously held by
Stephen M. Young Jr. Taft managed to
accumulate 51 percent of the vote.
Taft is a strong Nixon supporter. He
received White House help during the
campaign.
Metzenbaum, a political unknown,
ran a totally television-oriented primary
campaign to defeat astronaut-turned
politician John Glenn Jr. Before
becoming a Senatorial candidate, he
served as a campaign manager for
Young.
Another famous political name was
in the limelight last night as Adlai
Stevenson 111 defeated incumbent
Republican Sen. Ralph Smith in
Illinois. Smith ran a tough
law-and-order campaign, and had
attempted to Uig Stevenson as
"permissive." Like Taft, he received

President Nixon and the Republican
Party achieved some stunning upsets in
yesterday's elections, but the
Democrats were able to maintain
control over both houses of Congress
and to roll up substantial gains in the
governors' mansions.
The two biggest GOP upsets were
the defeats of Sens. Albert Gore (see
related story) and Joseph Tydings. The
Gore election was seen by the
administration as the acid test for its
"Southern Strategy."
And, much to the obvious pleasure
of the White House, James L. Buckley,
a Conservative Party candidate for the
Senate seat now held by liberal
Republican Sen. Charles Goodell,
defeated Goodell and another liberal,
Democratic Rep. Richard Ottinger, in a
tight three-way race.
GOP Gains Two
Overall returns show that the
Republicans gained two seats—not the
seven the President was originally
hoping for—in the Senate. The
Democrats won 20 of the 35 seats up
for election, bringing their total to 5 2
and giving them an obvious majority.
In the House, the Democrats gained
at least four seats, increasing their
majority.
The Democrats took over
governorships now held by Republicans
in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida,
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico and
Wisconsin. Republicans claimed two
state houses now claimed by the
Democrats in Connecticut and
Tennessee.
The Democrats now control 30
governorships pending final results.
Turnout Average
Voter turnout was about average for
midterm elections as slightly more than
55 million people cast their ballots.
One of the heaviest turnouts was in
New York, where 8 0 percent of the
registered voters participated in the
election, possibly spurred by interest in
the Buckley-Goodell-Ottinger race.
Here are the results of some of the
more important contests:
—In New York, Nelson Rockefeller
was reelected to an unprecedented
fourth term, defeating Democrat
Arthur J. Goldberg. (See related story.)
—In Connecticut, Rep. Lowell
Weicker, a conservative Republican,
defeated Sen. Thomas Dodd and Rev.
Joseph Duffey, national chairman of
the Americans for Democratic Action.
Dodd ran as an independent after
failing to capture the Democratic
nomination; Duffey ran as a Democrat
aided by many students. A Republican
governor was also elected.
Tunney Downs Murphy
Democratic Rep. John V. Tunney
defeated Sen. George Murphy for the
California Senate seat, despite an
all-out effort by President Nixon, his
family and his advisors.
-Democrat Adlai Stevenson 111
captured a Republican-held Senate seat
in Illinois, defeating law-and-order
advocate Sen. Ralph Smith. (See
related story.)
Democratic Sen. Vance Hartke
• Ii d hy Republican Rep. Richard

Roudebush to win reelection. Hartke
had been selected as a major target by
administration campaigners. (See
related story.)
—Republican Congressman Robert
Taft Jr. apparently defeated Democrat
Howard M. Metzenbaum for a Senate
seat from Ohio. (See related story.)
—In the administration's two major
upsets, William E. Brock III defeated
Sen. Albert Gore, while J. Glenn Beall
Jr. defeated Sen. Joseph Tydings. The
National Rifle Association and other
large interests had also worked for
Tydings' defeat.
Kennedy, Muskie Victors
—Presidential aspirants Ted Kennedy
and Ed Muskie were both returned to
the Senate with margins of about 60
percent. (See related story.) Hubert
Humphrey was also elected to the
Senate, as he defeated Rep. Clark
McGregor in a Minnesota contest.
—Sens. Philip Hart and William
Proxmire, from the Midwest, were
reelected without much difficulty,
while Nebraska's Roman Hruska
apparently won by the slimmest of
margins.
—Democrats Quentin Burdick and
Frank Moss, both Nixon targets,
withstood strong Republican challenges
and were reelected.
—George Wallace demolished all
opposition to win reelection as
governor of Alabama; he attracted 78
percent of the vote.
—In Arkansas, Dale Bumpers, a
moderate Democrat, defeated
Republican Winthrop Rockefeller.
Democrats Capture Florida
—In Florida, despite extensive
campaigning by both the President and
the Vice President, Democrats captured
both the Senate seat and the
governorship.
—Howard Cannon, Hiram Fong, Joe
Montoya, Henry Jackson and Gale
McGee were all reelected to the Senate,
Cannon and McGee withstanding heavy
Presidential campaigning.
—And last, but certainly not least,
Charlie Gubser maintained his iron
clasp on Santa Clara County and
vicinity, winning a landslide victory
over Rev. Stuart McLean.
Gore Upset
In what the Nixon administration
regarded as the prime test of its
"Southern Strategy," Rep. William E.
Brock III upset Sen. Albert Gore, an
18-year veteran, by a margin of only
two percent.
Tennessee Republicans also captured
the governorship, as Winfield Dunn, a
political newcomer, defeated John J.
Hocker Jr., his Democratic opponent.
Dunn will be the first GOP governor in
more than 5 0 years.
Gore was a consistent critic of the
President's Vietnam policies and was
considered by the Vice President to be
the "chairman of the Southern wing of
the Eastern Liberal Establishment."
Gore saw himself as the number one
target of the administration's
campaigning, as Brock received heavy
support from both the President and
the Vice President.

The heir to a multi-million dollar
candy manufacturing fortune, Brock
campaigned extremely hard, stressing
his support for the President and his
policies.
Presidential Timber
George Wallace, American
Independent Party presidential
candidate in 1968 , was reelected
governor of Alabama with 78 percent
of the vote, thus reasserting himself as a
strong Southern political force. He
defeated several other candidates,
including a black dentist running on a
reform Democratic ticket.
Hubert H. Humphrey, 1968
Democratic Party nominees, defeated

Clark McGregor for the Minnesota
Senate seat by capturing 5 6 percent of
the vote, the same percentage he won
when he carried the state in the 1968
presidential election. Wendell Anderson
was elected governor of the state, riding
strongly on titular party head HHH's
coattails.
In Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy won
reelection to the Senate with 60
percent of the vote. Earlier, hehad said
he would need at least that much of a
margin to achieve a "moral victory." In
1964 , before Chappaquidick, Kennedy
was elected with nearly 7 4 percent of
the vote.
Ed Muskie, who had said he needed
65 percent of the vote to achieve his
"moral victory," fell short—he was

Goodell could never win.
Late results showed Buckley won
with nearly 40 percent of the vote, as
Ottinger and Goodell neatly split the
liberal, anti-war vote in the nation's
second most populous state. Younger
brother of nationally-syndicated
columnist William F. Buckley Jr.,
Buckley received support from the Vice
President when he was fund raising
there some three weeks ago.
In The Family
Republican Robert Taft Jr.
apparently narrowly defeated
Democrat Howard M. Metzenbaum for
the Ohio Senate seat previously held by
Stephen M. Young Jr. Taft managed to
accumulate 51 percent of the vote.
Taft is a strong Nixon supporter. He
received White House help during the
campaign.
Metzenbaum, a political unknown,
ran a totally television-oriented primary
campaign to defeat astronaut-turned
politician John Glenn Jr. Before
becoming a Senatorial candidate, he
served as a campaign manager for
Young.
Another famous political name was
in the limelight last night as Adlai
Stevenson 111 defeated incumbent
Republican Sen. Ralph Smith in
Illinois. Smith ran a tough
law-and-order campaign, and had
attempted to Uig Stevenson as
"permissive." Like Taft, he received
<;(rnno snnnort from (he President.
President Nixon and the Republican
Party achieved some stunning upsets in
yesterday's elections, but the
Democrats were able to maintain
control over both houses of Congress
and to roll up substantial gains in the
governors' mansions.
The two biggest GOP upsets were
the defeats of Sens. Albert Gore (see
related story) and Joseph Tydings. The
Gore election was seen by the
administration as the acid test for its
"Southern Strategy."
And, much to the obvious pleasure
of the White House, James L. Buckley,
a Conservative Party candidate for the
Senate seat now held by liberal
Republican Sen. Charles Goodell,
defeated Goodell and another liberal,
Democratic Rep. Richard Ottinger, in a
tight three-way race.
GOP Gains Two
Overall returns show that the
Republicans gained two seats—not the
seven the President was originally
hoping for—in the Senate. The
Democrats won 20 of the 35 seats up
for election, bringing their total to 5 2
and giving them an obvious majority.
In the House, the Democrats gained
at least four seats, increasing their
majority.
The Democrats took over
governorships now held by Republicans
in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida,
Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico and
Wisconsin. Republicans claimed two
state houses now claimed by the
Democrats in Connecticut and
Tennessee.
The Democrats now control 30
governorships pending final results.
Turnout Average
Voter turnout was about average for
midterm elections as slightly more than
55 million people cast their ballots.
One of the heaviest turnouts was in
New York, where 8 0 percent of the
registered voters participated in the
election, possibly spurred by interest in
the Buckley-Goodell-Ottinger race.
Here are the results of some of the
more important contests:
—In New York, Nelson Rockefeller
was reelected to an unprecedented
fourth term, defeating Democrat
Arthur J. Goldberg. (See related story.)
—In Connecticut, Rep. Lowell
Weicker, a conservative Republican,
defeated Sen. Thomas Dodd and Rev.
Joseph Duffey, national chairman of
the Americans for Democratic Action.
Dodd ran as an independent after
failing to capture the Democratic
nomination; Duffey ran as a Democrat
aided by many students. A Republican
governor was also elected.
Tunney Downs Murphy
Democratic Rep. John V. Tunney
defeated Sen. George Murphy for the
California Senate seat, despite an
all-out effort by President Nixon, his
family and his advisors.
-Democrat Adlai Stevenson 111
captured a Republican-held Senate seat
in Illinois, defeating law-and-order
advocate Sen. Ralph Smith. (See
related story.)
Democratic Sen. Vance Hartke
• Ii d hy Republican Rep. Richard

Roudebush to win reelection. Hartke
had been selected as a major target by
administration campaigners. (See
related story.)
—Republican Congressman Robert
Taft Jr. apparently defeated Democrat
Howard M. Metzenbaum for a Senate
seat from Ohio. (See related story.)
—In the administration's two major
upsets, William E. Brock III defeated
Sen. Albert Gore, while J. Glenn Beall
Jr. defeated Sen. Joseph Tydings. The
National Rifle Association and other
large interests had also worked for
Tydings' defeat.
Kennedy, Muskie Victors
—Presidential aspirants Ted Kennedy
and Ed Muskie were both returned to
the Senate with margins of about 60
percent. (See related story.) Hubert
Humphrey was also elected to the
Senate, as he defeated Rep. Clark
McGregor in a Minnesota contest.
—Sens. Philip Hart and William
Proxmire, from the Midwest, were
reelected without much difficulty,
while Nebraska's Roman Hruska
apparently won by the slimmest of
margins.
—Democrats Quentin Burdick and
Frank Moss, both Nixon targets,
withstood strong Republican challenges
and were reelected.
—George Wallace demolished all
opposition to win reelection as
governor of Alabama; he attracted 78
percent of the vote.
—In Arkansas, Dale Bumpers, a
moderate Democrat, defeated
Republican Winthrop Rockefeller.
Democrats Capture Florida
—In Florida, despite extensive
campaigning by both the President and
the Vice President, Democrats captured
both the Senate seat and the
governorship.
—Howard Cannon, Hiram Fong, Joe
Montoya, Henry Jackson and Gale
McGee were all reelected to the Senate,
Cannon and McGee withstanding heavy
Presidential campaigning.
—And last, but certainly not least,
Charlie Gubser maintained his iron
clasp on Santa Clara County and
vicinity, winning a landslide victory
over Rev. Stuart McLean.
Gore Upset
In what the Nixon administration
regarded as the prime test of its
"Southern Strategy," Rep. William E.
Brock III upset Sen. Albert Gore, an
18-year veteran, by a margin of only
two percent.
Tennessee Republicans also captured
the governorship, as Winfield Dunn, a
political newcomer, defeated John J.
Hocker Jr., his Democratic opponent.
Dunn will be the first GOP governor in
more than 5 0 years.
Gore was a consistent critic of the
President's Vietnam policies and was
considered by the Vice President to be
the "chairman of the Southern wing of
the Eastern Liberal Establishment."
Gore saw himself as the number one
target of the administration's
campaigning, as Brock received heavy
support from both the President and
the Vice President.

The heir to a multi-million dollar
candy manufacturing fortune, Brock
campaigned extremely hard, stressing
his support for the President and his
policies.
Presidential Timber
George Wallace, American
Independent Party presidential
candidate in 1968 , was reelected
governor of Alabama with 78 percent
of the vote, thus reasserting himself as a
strong Southern political force. He
defeated several other candidates,
including a black dentist running on a
reform Democratic ticket.
Hubert H. Humphrey, 1968
Democratic Party nominees, defeated

Clark McGregor for the Minnesota
Senate seat by capturing 5 6 percent of
the vote, the same percentage he won
when he carried the state in the 1968
presidential election. Wendell Anderson
was elected governor of the state, riding
strongly on titular party head HHH's
coattails.
In Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy won
reelection to the Senate with 60
percent of the vote. Earlier, hehad said
he would need at least that much of a
margin to achieve a "moral victory." In
1964 , before Chappaquidick, Kennedy
was elected with nearly 7 4 percent of
the vote.
Ed Muskie, who had said he needed
65 percent of the vote to achieve his
"moral victory," fell short—he was

reelected with about 61 percent of the
vote, some six percentage points fewer
than when Maine sent him to the
Senate in 1964.
Hartke Ekes Victory
One of the dirtiest campaigns in the
election has resulted in one of the
closest outcomes, as Democratic Sen.
Vance Hartke squeaked by Republican
Rep. Richard Roudebush to win
reelection. Hartke won with only 5 0.1
percent of the vote.
During the course of the campaign,
Roudebush, a staunch conservative,
accused Hartke, who generally votes as
a liberal, of giving (loaded) M-16 rifles
to Viet Cong soldiers. He reportedly
also hired "hippie-types" to litter
roadsides with Hartke literature.
Hartke retorted by claiming that
Roudebush has been married four
times, instead of twice, as Roudebush
has repeatedly said.
NY Moves Right
Conservatives triumphed in New
York last night as James Buckley, with
tacit Nixon administration support,
won a tight three-way Senate race and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, leaning to the
right of his former political stance, was
elected overwhelmingly to an
unprecedented fourth term.
Buckley, running on the
Conservative Party ticket, edged out
Sen. Charles Goodell, dubbed a
"radical-liberal" by Vice President
Agnew, and Democratic Rep. Richard
Ottinger, another liberal.
Rockefeller won a landslide victory
over former Supreme Court Justice and
United Nations Ambassador Arthur J.
(loMh«irrt •» tnnrrtimn lilvril Ur>mnrfit

Rockefeller received 5 4 percent of the
vote to Goldberg's 41 percent.
Rockefeller moved progressively to
the right as the campaign wore on. He
split publically with New York mayor
John V. Lindsay over many stances
taken by leading Republican Party
figures and had said privately that
Goodell could never win.
Late results showed Buckley won
with nearly 40 percent of the vote, as
Ottinger and Goodell neatly split the
liberal, anti-war vote in the nation's
second most populous state. Younger
