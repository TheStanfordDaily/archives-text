# Slate Senate Upset
## Gubser, McCloskey Re-Elected 
### DON LINDEMANN 
Republican incumbents Pete
McCloskey and Charles Gubser won
re-election to Congress yesterday by
safe margins in local balloting that
returned most incumbents to office.
However, Democrats were able to
break the GOP control of the State
Senate through an upset victory that
will be of major importance in
reapportioning California election
districts.
The Republican victors included
State Senator Clark L. Bradley and
State Assemblyman Richard Hayden.
Democratic Congressman Don Edwards
and Assemblyman Ken Meade also were
ahead in early returns.
An important upset victory was
scored when Democrat Arlen Gregorio
edged out veteran State Assemblyman
Carl Britschgi. The State Senate,
formerly GOP-controlled, will now be
evenly divided between both parties.
In a heated campaign James M.
Geary scored a big win against Sam

Delia Maggiore in the race for Santa
Clara County Sherriff.
Gregorio and Britschgi
Gregorio, whose campaign stressed
his pro-conservation stance, edged
14 -year incumbent Republican Carl
Britschgi in the 12th State Senate
District. The talley was 95 ,3 75 to
89,07 6 , with 660 out of 684 precincts
reporting.
Britschgi, who was seeking the seat
vacated by Republican Richard Dolwig
who was retired, was rated poorly on
the ecology issue by a Southern
California conservation group. The
group placed him near the bottom on a
list of state legislators, saying he voted
"right" on only 17 percent of the
conservation bills.
At the moment the State Senate is
controlled by the GOP with a 21-19
margin. If the Republicans had
managed to maintain their edge, the
reapportionment of districts would
have been along GOP lines. Now with
the Senate in a 2 0-20 deadlock, these

plans are foiled. In the event of any tie
votes, Lt. Gov. Edward Reinecke will
have the decisive vote.
Sherriff's Race
Santa Clara Undersherriff James
Geary was leading early this morning
with 6 4 percent of the vote. He had
taken a moderate stand in the race
against County Supervisor Sam Delia
Maggiore, a proponent of tougher law
enforcement.
In the Tenth Congressional District,
incumbent Charles Gubser defeated
"peace candidate" Stuart McLean.
With 45 percent of the precincts
reporting, the vote was 61 percent in
favor of Gubser, for who returns for his
tenth Congressional term. McLean took
only 37 percent, despite help from
student workers. (See related stories on
page 6.)
Incumbent Clark L. Bradley
defeated Democrat John B. Rutherford
in the 14 th State Senate District. With
half the vote in, the tally was 39,945
for Bradley to Rutherford's 35,353.
Hayden and McCloskey
Hayden defeated Democrat J. Ken
Croft in the 2 2 nd Assembly District,
taking approximately 59 percent of the
vote. McCloskey won easily in the 11 th
Congressional District, piling up a
1 00,000-vote plurality and a 4 -1 margin
over his opponent, Democrat Robert
Gomperts.
Democrat Don Edwards also won
easily in the 9th Congressional District,
defeating his Republican opponent,
Mark Guerra by better than a
two-to-one margin.
Though most incumbents led,
16-year veteran Republican
Assemblyman Don Mulford (Rep.)
trailed Democrat Ken Meade in the
1 6th Assembly District in Berkeley.
With 4 7 percent of the vote in,
liberal Democrat Ronald Dellums led
Republican John E. llealy in the 7th
Congressional District. Dellums had
defeated moderate incumbent
Democrat Jeffrey Cohelan in an upset
primary. The black Berkeley city

councilman was attacked by vice
president Agnew during the campaigr
for his alleged "radical" stands.
In other elections to State
Assembly, Democrats John
Vasconcellos and Alister McAlister
were leading. Vasconcellos had 5 8
percent, while Republican opponent
Virginia Shaffer had 4 0 percent.
McAlister's lead was slimmer, with the
tally showing her ahead, 5 3 to 43
percent, over Republican Earle P.
Crandall.
In the race for Santa Clara Municipal
Judge, Court No. 3, John Schatz held a
slight lead over Renee Baum, 51 to 49
percent.
Reagan and Unruh
In the gubernatorial contest, Santa
Clara voters were almost evenly split
between incumbent Ronald Reagan and
Democrat Jess Unruh. With half the
precincts reporting, Reagan led 4 9 to
4 8 percent.
County voters gave Alfred Alquist a
5 0 to 4 7 percent margin over Ed
Reinecke in the race for Lieutenant
Governor. For Secretary of State,
Edmund Brown Jr. led withss percent
of the tally, a margin of 22 percent
over James Flournoy.
Tunney Ahead
As in the statewide balloting,
incumbent George Murphy was behind
John Tunney in his bid for re-election
to the U.S. Senate. Tunney had 92,937
votes to Murphy's 59 ,81 0, a margin of
59 to 38 percent.
Wilson Riles also had a substantial
lead over incumbent Max Rafferty for
the post of State Superintendent.
Results showed Riles with 99 ,243 and
Rafferty with 52,648 , a two-to-one
margin.
County voters ratified the
controversial State Measures 1 and 18,
dealing with water pollution and
vehicle taxes. The favorable votes were
78 and 5 7 percent. But they turned
down Measure 20 which deals with
recreation and appeared to be winning
state-wide. The vote was only 45
percent favorable.
