Friday's Daily described a
course on gun laws, one of seven
excellent courses on the law
offered through the Free
University by Legal Defense
volunteers and the lawyers who
work closely with them. Other
courses in the series include
seminars on dope laws, landlord
tenement law, labor law for
organizers, draft law survey and
doing your own divorce. Some of
these courses, as well as many
others listed in the Fall Quarter
Free University Catalog are still
open to anyone interested in

broadening his or her education
past the confines of the normal
university menu.
The Free U., which has been
operating in the Mid-Peninsula
area for more than 5 years now,
prides itself on the wide variety of
courses offered and the great
diversity of backgrounds and
ideologies of students and
teachers who meet under its
banner. From Inner Paths courses
on Yoga, massage, chanting and
seances and Encounter courses
such as Gestalt groups, growth
marathon, getting closer to others,
couples encounter, psychodrama
workshop through arts, crafts and
people's technology offerings on
3-D stereo, photography, haute
cuisine, how to unstop your drain,
practical sewing all the way to
courses on China, Cuba, America
in Crisis, Modern Day Racism,
Mao Rephrased and What is
Marxism-Leninism, no better
epithet describes the Free U
concept than a devotion to
diversity, a real attempt to serve
the needs of people by making it
possible for them to expand their
knowledge and experience in as
many areas as possible, expecially
those currently neglected by
establishment education.
The organization is governed
by its members through weekly
co-ordinating committee meetings
and monthly general membership
meetings at which major policy
decisions are made. Several full
time staff members (for example,
Coordinator John Dolly, Office
Manager, Bobbye Wolfe) are
supported on subsistence level
salaries from registration fees ($15
or what you can afford) which
also go to pay for catalogues,
posters, office rent, etc.
The Free You, (newsletter)
originally an art, literature and
political monthly magazine, was
converted to a weekly newspaper
after the political events of last
spring. Although Free You is
partially subsidized by the Free
University funds, and carries all
official Free U. announcements, it
is currently run independently by
the Newspaper Collective.
While it has been criticized at
times for being too heavily
weighted in favor of one radical
ideology, the Free You remains
the only "underground"
newspaper with any reasonable
circulation in the Mid-Peninsula
area and the only place where one
can find out what's happening
around Palo Alto (unless, of
course, you want to settle for the
Paly Times).
The Free University has always

been, and probably always will be,
a political institution.By its very
nature as a counter-university, it
posits a challenge to the
establishment to radically change
its educational system to meet the
needs and desires of students,
rather than the needs and desires
of the people who pay for, and
control, contemporary
educational institutions.
If you haven't yet taken or
given a Free U. course, get a
catalog (they're available at Full
Circle, 117 University Avenue,
P.A.) and take your pick. Most
courses are still open. And if you
want to see how its all got
together, and maybe join in the
process, come down on Thursday
nights, around dinner time, to
Full Circle. The co-ordinating
committee meets upstairs. After
the meeting, about 8 :30, the Free
U. political forum presents
informal discussions led by
speakers such as Fred Bennet,
Black Panther Party, Vic Lovell,
Psychodrama Workshop, Aaron
Mangeniello,Venceramos and
others.
