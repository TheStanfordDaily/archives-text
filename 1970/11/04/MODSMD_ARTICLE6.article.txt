Saigon (DNSl)—American soldiers frequently
operate inside the supposedly 'off limits' area of
the demilitarized zone, according to a ranger who
claims to have been on at least 2 5 missions'inside
the Z'.
The former member of a LRRP (Long Range
Reconnaisance Patrol) team said there are
frequently as many as ten LRRP teams at a time
operating between the southern boundary of the
DMZ and the Ben Hai river, the official dividing
line between North and South Viet Nam.
"Rangers usually go into the 'Z' in six man
teams," he explained, adding that his team usually
went in 'to set ambushes and collect body count.'
"Last summer," he said, "there was a real big
push for body count, for kills. We set ambushes all
the time."
Jet Bombers
Asked if helicopter gunships and jet bombers
ever strayed into the 'neutral demilitarized zone',
he replied, "we were always inserted and extracted
with the aid of cobra gunships. It is standard
practice for cobras to shoot up an area before we
go in, and often we needed cobra's and jets to
cover us when we were being extracted (coming
out)."
"In fact," he added, "my team once had to go
into a bunker complex, about three kilometers
inside the DMZ to rescue two pilots from a
downed cobra."
According to the source, a LRRP team was lost
around September 25 th when a UH-1 'Huey'
helicopter was shot down inside the DIVE. He said
that nine men were killed in the crash, four from
the crew and five of the six men in 'killer team
1-B'.
"The North Vietnamese have a lot of .51
caliber machine guns in the 'Z' now," he said,
"and LRRP's are taking higher casualties than last
summer."
Most of the LRRP teams operating in Viet Nam
are part of the 75 th ranger battalion, which has it
headquarters in Nha Trang (also home of the
special forces in Viet Nam). Units of the 75th
parent organization are spread throughout Viet
Nam and are responsible for a large part of the
long range reconnaisance for larger units. For
instance, "C" company of the 75th Ranger
battalion is located in the central highlands, at An
Khe while "L" company is assigned to the 101st
Airborne Division at Phu Bai, near Hue. "P"
company is located further north, at Quan Tri, just
12 miles south of the DMZ.
"P" company operates almost entirely inside
the DMZ," he said, but added that they are never
supposed to cross the Ben Hai river.
North Viet Nam
On at least one occasion, however, he said, an
American helicopter landed in North Viet Nam.
"Las December," he said, "a chopper from the
101st touched down briefly in North Viet Nam,
across the river. The pilot touched down for just a
moment, drew some fire, then flew back over to
insert his team. He wasn't supposed to do it and
was reprimanded later."

The main purpose of the LRRP's, he said is to
recon an area, locate enemy troops and report the
information to the rear. "Most LRRP's avoid
contact byt we were usually instructed to collect
body count. To set up ambushes."
"The worst time my team had, as far as losing
men," he said, "was at the hands of our own
men." Explaining, he said "last July we found a
regimental bunker complex a kilometer and a half
inside the DMZ. We had two teams working and
we uncovered a cache. We reported it and an EOD
team (explosive ordinance disposal) was sent in to
blow the cache and the bunkers. They goofed and
blew their charges too early, while some of the
LRRP's were still in the bunkers Two of our men
were killed and several others were injured."
CS Gas
Asked to explain methods of 'acquiring body
count', he said "last summer our commanding
officer received concentrated CS gas in large
containers. They were around four feet long and
weighed between 25 to 30 pounds each. After we
spotted a bunker complex inside the 'Z', the
choppers would come in and drop these boxes of
concentrated CS into the openings of bunkers and
tunnels. This would make them (North
Vietnamese soldiers) scramble out of their holes
like ants. Then the Cobra's (sleek, fast helicopter
gunships earring motor driven mini-guns and
automatic grenade and rocket launchers) would
come in and slaughter them. It was common
procedure to gas people and then shoot them
while they came out of their holes while I was in
the Z", he said, adding "and I guess it still it."
"Killing is sport up there," he said, "and that is
about all. Once, we directed a chopper toward two
North Vietnamese soldiers walking down a trail
about three kilometers inside the DMZ. We heard
the pilot say (over the radio) when he spotted
them, 'coming in for two kills.' After he shot them
he radioed back that he got them and asked if we
saw any more."
The former LRRP, who asked to ramain
anonymus for his safety, added that his unit was
one of the few in Viet Nam authorized to use
white phosphorous (a chemical which burns
through the skin, burns on oxygen and is almost
impossible to put out) grenades on people. "We
used them too," he added.
Although he hasn't been on a mission since this
past summer, he said that "P" company LRRP's
are still operating inside the DMZ and cited last
week's loss of 'Killer team 1-8' as example. He
added that teams from other companies of the
7 5 th Ranger Battalion often operate inside of Laos
and Cambodia.
Official military spokesmen deny that US
forces operate within the DMZ, Laos or Cambodia.
Spokesmen also disclaimed any knowledge of last
week's alleged downing of a Huey inside the DMZ
and the loss of the 'killer team 1 -8

special forces in Viet Nam). Units of the 75th
parent organization are spread throughout Viet
Nam and are responsible for a large part of the
long range reconnaisance for larger units. For
instance, "C" company of the 75th Ranger
battalion is located in the central highlands, at An
Khe while "L" company is assigned to the 101st
Airborne Division at Phu Bai, near Hue. "P"
company is located further north, at Quan Tri, just
12 miles south of the DMZ.
"P" company operates almost entirely inside
the DMZ," he said, but added that they are never
supposed to cross the Ben Hai river.
North Viet Nam
On at least one occasion, however, he said, an
American helicopter landed in North Viet Nam.
"Las December," he said, "a chopper from the
101st touched down briefly in North Viet Nam,
across the river. The pilot touched down for just a
moment, drew some fire, then flew back over to
insert his team. He wasn't supposed to do it and
was reprimanded later."

The main purpose of the LRRP's, he said is to
recon an area, locate enemy troops and report the
information to the rear. "Most LRRP's avoid
contact byt we were usually instructed to collect
body count. To set up ambushes."
"The worst time my team had, as far as losing
men," he said, "was at the hands of our own
men." Explaining, he said "last July we found a
regimental bunker complex a kilometer and a half
inside the DMZ. We had two teams working and
we uncovered a cache. We reported it and an EOD
team (explosive ordinance disposal) was sent in to
blow the cache and the bunkers. They goofed and
blew their charges too early, while some of the
LRRP's were still in the bunkers Two of our men
were killed and several others were injured."
CS Gas
Asked to explain methods of 'acquiring body
count', he said "last summer our commanding
officer received concentrated CS gas in large
containers. They were around four feet long and
weighed between 25 to 30 pounds each. After we
spotted a bunker complex inside the 'Z', the
choppers would come in and drop these boxes of
concentrated CS into the openings of bunkers and
tunnels. This would make them (North
Vietnamese soldiers) scramble out of their holes
like ants. Then the Cobra's (sleek, fast helicopter
gunships earring motor driven mini-guns and
automatic grenade and rocket launchers) would
come in and slaughter them. It was common
procedure to gas people and then shoot them
while they came out of their holes while I was in
the Z", he said, adding "and I guess it still it."
"Killing is sport up there," he said, "and that is
about all. Once, we directed a chopper toward two
North Vietnamese soldiers walking down a trail
about three kilometers inside the DMZ. We heard
the pilot say (over the radio) when he spotted
them, 'coming in for two kills.' After he shot them
he radioed back that he got them and asked if we
saw any more."
The former LRRP, who asked to ramain
anonymus for his safety, added that his unit was
one of the few in Viet Nam authorized to use
white phosphorous (a chemical which burns
through the skin, burns on oxygen and is almost
impossible to put out) grenades on people. "We
used them too," he added.
Although he hasn't been on a mission since this
past summer, he said that "P" company LRRP's
are still operating inside the DMZ and cited last
week's loss of 'Killer team 1-8' as example. He
added that teams from other companies of the
7 5 th Ranger Battalion often operate inside of Laos
and Cambodia.

forces operate within the DMZ, Laos or Cambodia.

Saigon (DNSl)—American soldiers frequently
operate inside the supposedly 'off limits' area of
the demilitarized zone, according to a ranger who
claims to have been on at least 2 5 missions'inside
the Z'.
The former member of a LRRP (Long Range
Reconnaisance Patrol) team said there are
frequently as many as ten LRRP teams at a time
operating between the southern boundary of the
DMZ and the Ben Hai river, the official dividing
line between North and South Viet Nam.
"Rangers usually go into the 'Z' in six man
teams," he explained, adding that his team usually
went in 'to set ambushes and collect body count.'
"Last summer," he said, "there was a real big
push for body count, for kills. We set ambushes all
the time."
Jet Bombers
Asked if helicopter gunships and jet bombers
ever strayed into the 'neutral demilitarized zone',
he replied, "we were always inserted and extracted
with the aid of cobra gunships. It is standard
practice for cobras to shoot up an area before we
go in, and often we needed cobra's and jets to
cover us when we were being extracted (coming
out)."
"In fact," he added, "my team once had to go
into a bunker complex, about three kilometers
inside the DMZ to rescue two pilots from a
downed cobra."
According to the source, a LRRP team was lost
around September 25 th when a UH-1 'Huey'
helicopter was shot down inside the DIVE. He said
that nine men were killed in the crash, four from
the crew and five of the six men in 'killer team
1-B'.
"The North Vietnamese have a lot of .51
caliber machine guns in the 'Z' now," he said,
"and LRRP's are taking higher casualties than last
summer."
Most of the LRRP teams operating in Viet Nam
are part of the 75 th ranger battalion, which has it

officer received concentrated CS gas in large
containers. They were around four feet long and
weighed between 25 to 30 pounds each. After we
spotted a bunker complex inside the 'Z', the
choppers would come in and drop these boxes of
concentrated CS into the openings of bunkers and
tunnels. This would make them (North
Vietnamese soldiers) scramble out of their holes
like ants. Then the Cobra's (sleek, fast helicopter
gunships earring motor driven mini-guns and
automatic grenade and rocket launchers) would
come in and slaughter them. It was common
procedure to gas people and then shoot them
while they came out of their holes while I was in
the Z", he said, adding "and I guess it still it."
"Killing is sport up there," he said, "and that is
about all. Once, we directed a chopper toward two
North Vietnamese soldiers walking down a trail
about three kilometers inside the DMZ. We heard
the pilot say (over the radio) when he spotted
them, 'coming in for two kills.' After he shot them
he radioed back that he got them and asked if we
saw any more."
The former LRRP, who asked to ramain
anonymus for his safety, added that his unit was
one of the few in Viet Nam authorized to use
white phosphorous (a chemical which burns
through the skin, burns on oxygen and is almost
impossible to put out) grenades on people. "We
used them too," he added.
Although he hasn't been on a mission since this
past summer, he said that "P" company LRRP's
are still operating inside the DMZ and cited last

added that teams from other companies of the
7 5 th Ranger Battalion often operate inside of Laos
and Cambodia.

Saigon (DNSl)—American soldiers frequently
operate inside the supposedly 'off limits' area of
the demilitarized zone, according to a ranger who
claims to have been on at least 2 5 missions'inside
the Z'.
The former member of a LRRP (Long Range
Reconnaisance Patrol) team said there are
frequently as many as ten LRRP teams at a time
operating between the southern boundary of the
DMZ and the Ben Hai river, the official dividing
line between North and South Viet Nam.
"Rangers usually go into the 'Z' in six man
teams," he explained, adding that his team usually
went in 'to set ambushes and collect body count.'
"Last summer," he said, "there was a real big
push for body count, for kills. We set ambushes all
the time."
Jet Bombers
Asked if helicopter gunships and jet bombers
ever strayed into the 'neutral demilitarized zone',
he replied, "we were always inserted and extracted
with the aid of cobra gunships. It is standard
practice for cobras to shoot up an area before we
go in, and often we needed cobra's and jets to
cover us when we were being extracted (coming
out)."
"In fact," he added, "my team once had to go
into a bunker complex, about three kilometers
inside the DMZ to rescue two pilots from a
downed cobra."
According to the source, a LRRP team was lost
around September 25 th when a UH-1 'Huey'
helicopter was shot down inside the DIVE. He said
that nine men were killed in the crash, four from
the crew and five of the six men in 'killer team
1-B'.
"The North Vietnamese have a lot of .51
caliber machine guns in the 'Z' now," he said,
"and LRRP's are taking higher casualties than last
summer."
Most of the LRRP teams operating in Viet Nam
are part of the 75 th ranger battalion, which has it
headquarters in Nha Trang (also home of the
special forces in Viet Nam). Units of the 75th
parent organization are spread throughout Viet
Nam and are responsible for a large part of the
long range reconnaisance for larger units. For
instance, "C" company of the 75th Ranger
battalion is located in the central highlands, at An
Khe while "L" company is assigned to the 101st
Airborne Division at Phu Bai, near Hue. "P"
company is located further north, at Quan Tri, just
12 miles south of the DMZ.
"P" company operates almost entirely inside
the DMZ," he said, but added that they are never
supposed to cross the Ben Hai river.
North Viet Nam
On at least one occasion, however, he said, an
American helicopter landed in North Viet Nam.
"Las December," he said, "a chopper from the
101st touched down briefly in North Viet Nam,
across the river. The pilot touched down for just a
moment, drew some fire, then flew back over to
insert his team. He wasn't supposed to do it and
was reprimanded later."

The main purpose of the LRRP's, he said is to
recon an area, locate enemy troops and report the
information to the rear. "Most LRRP's avoid
contact byt we were usually instructed to collect
body count. To set up ambushes."
"The worst time my team had, as far as losing
men," he said, "was at the hands of our own
men." Explaining, he said "last July we found a
regimental bunker complex a kilometer and a half
inside the DMZ. We had two teams working and
we uncovered a cache. We reported it and an EOD
team (explosive ordinance disposal) was sent in to
blow the cache and the bunkers. They goofed and
blew their charges too early, while some of the
LRRP's were still in the bunkers Two of our men
were killed and several others were injured."

Asked to explain methods of 'acquiring body
