6 Daily 9 Inaccurate
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article by Nicholas Dungan
and Gregory Vail on inflation and
unemployment (Thursday,
October 29) did not report my
views accurately. I did not say,
.. inflation may worsen before
it improves"—though that may
turn out to be the case. I said that
unemployment may worsen
before it improves. I did not say,
"The Administration's program is
fiscally sound," nor did I say, "in
the attempt to stimulate business,
the Nixon administration may
suffer disastrous political
repercussions ..." I said that by
failing to stimulate business more
vigorously and so by tolerating a
high rate of unemployment, the
Administration is accepting
serious political risks.

Garbage Squeeze
Editor, THE DAILY:
Friday, in Belliville, Illinois,

Vice President Spiro Agnew
referred to the hostilities directed
toward President Nixon in San
Jose Thursday night and said "It's
time to squeeze that kind of
garbage out of this society." I
agree, we do have some garbage to
squeeze out of this society, but it
certainly isn't the crowd of 3000
young people and workers, many
of them unemployed, who were in
San Jose Thursday night. Because
of a society based on the benefits
of imperialist wars, these people,
layed off from various defense
industries around San Jose, have
already been squeezed out of a
country ruled by the real garbage.
Lies, corruption, systematic
murder, genocide, and repression:
the face of the Amerikan
government gets clearer and
clearer as Nixon continues to
serve the real garbage of this
society-the corporation owners,
bankers, and big businessmen—the
kind of garbage that benefits from
the bombing of Vietnamese
peasants, the extermination of the
Black Panther Party, the murder
of students at Kent State and

Jackson State, and the attacks on
strikes and other struggles of
working people trying to squeeze
back into this society. The
politicians, the courts, and
especially the army and the police
are the weapons they use against
the cause of the people.
The black and brown people in
the crowd Thursday who Spiro
calls garbage have also been
squeezed out of this society—for
hundreds of years. Spiro is
shaking in his boots because these
people have finally be^n
overwhelmed enough with hatred
for their oppressors to say "Fuck
no we won't take anymore!" and
throw a few eggs. White people in
this country are beginning to
choose sides and, much to Sprio's
dismay, more and more are
choosing the side of the
oppressed the right side. Spiro
shakes all the more.
While Nixon and Reagan were
complaining so loudly about the
"violence" of a few rocks and eggs
thrown at a bulletproof limousine,
Nixon's Secret Service henchmen
were pistol-whipping people in the

crowd. What Nixon doesn't yet
realize is that the more he tries to
teach us that political power
grows out of the barrel of the gun,
the more people in this country
will unite, having learned their
lesson well, to show the pigs just
what that political power means
in the hands of the people. In the
future, no amount of armed SS
agents and Tactical Squads will be
able to protect the garbage in this
society from the people's
weapons—which will no longer be
rocks and eggs. The real garbage
will be squeezed out of Amerika,
and people throughout the "free"
world will begin to experience
what real freedom and dignity is
all about.

Patently Specious
TO THE PEOPLE:
Our corporate liberals have
been mouthing platitudes to the
effect that violence and trashing
are not the means for achieving
radical demands, that violence will

only bring on the repression, and
that only non-violent efforts will
achieve radical change.
This is a patently specious
argument.
If we utilize the McNamara
cost/benefit analysis of revolution
which was so clearly articulated
last spring, there is an identifiable
segment of our society that is far
more ripe for revolution, far more
willing to engage in
anti-establishment behavior than
any student body.
That group is our convict
population in the prisons.
What we must clearly do is
break into state and federal
prisons in order to radicalize and
organize the eons.
Don't be hoodwinked into
thinking your conviction is
repressive. It is a step toward the
revolution. Rejoice in the length
of your jail sentence. The longer
the time in stir, the more
revolutionaries you can liberate.
We have a great opportunity
before us. Promote the revolution.
Snitch on your friends.
