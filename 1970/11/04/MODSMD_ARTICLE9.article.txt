# Landslide For Apathy

There was one political race which made
the Reagan-Unruh battle look close. From
the beginning the great campus political
prognosticators, the Walter Lippmans of the
dining halls, the George Gallops of the Quad,
and the Joseph Alsops of the bull sessions in
your room had predicted a landslide victory,
and Tuesday's election in no way refuted
their claims.
While 75 percent of America's voters
produced a large turnout at the polls, the
autumnally apathetic great silent majority of
students turned out in large numbers at the
library and in their rooms yesterday to give
student non-involvement in this year's
political elections an impressive win.
Although a spokesman at the Student
Committee for Involvement in Politics (SCIP)
described the turnout of some 250-300
students for precinct canvassing as "very
impressive," cynics are probably right in
calling the two day moratorium on classes for
election work "Thanksgiving break number
I."
"I've got so much work that I was going to
do this weekend," and "What difference does
it make," were apparently among the key
issues in student apathy's overwhelming
victory.

Although for most students, the elections
were a topic of conversation and matter of
interest, the level of emotional involvement
in the campaign was extremely low,
considering that elections are supposed to be
the focal points of our political process.
"I can't really see getting too excited
about the elections when you look at the
candidates," commented one student. "No
matter who wins, things are going to pretty
much remain the same."
People were mainly busy getting back to
work after their long lethargic weekend.
"I've got 150 pages of biology to read by
tomorrow," complained one student.
"Did you hear that Stevenson was winning
in Illinois?" added another more politically
involved student, who checked his mailbox
and, finding it empty, plodded off to the
library with his books.
Certainly there were those who were
involvedâ€”the 300 who had walked the
Midpeninsula braving rain to turn out the
votes for their candidates.
"I think it's really important for students
to make their voices felt in this election," one
girl said. Vet she was part of a small minority.
Where was the sense of political
consciousness which had shut down the

University last spring and out of which had
grown the two-day election holiday?
"You can't expect Stanford students to be
too politically active in the fall," commented
one girl at SCIP headquarters.
Politics were out of season.
In the dorms after dinner, some people
gathered around to watch the results come in.
But there were no more than six people in
front of any T.V. set I saw.
In one dorm the T.V. broke. No one was
too annoyed. But there had been a general
uproar a couple of weeks before when it had
gone blank during the Rams-Vikings game.
Most students just sat there gazing silently
at Walter Cronkite or David Brinkley with an
occasional "Oh shit!" as wins were projected
for Buckley in New York or Taft in Ohio.
Some of them had their books. They were
just wasting time until they had to start their
work for classes.
"I just can't get too excited about the
elections," commented one student wearing a
"Strike" T-shirt.
Elections 1970?
Aside from the bumper stickers and
occasional posters, you had to look hard to
find any signs of them at Stanford.
People had other things to do.
