At last ... in one great book ... a delightful mixture of lore, myth
and anecdote never before assembled in a single volume.
For instance, do you know how many bottles of beer it would take to
float the battleship Missouri? Or what beer can do for orchids? You're
planning a party and you need to know how to tap a keg, and how
many glasses of beer you can get from a half-barrel . . . and how many
servings you should allow per male guest . . . and per female. Maybe
beer steins intrigue you, and you'd like to know more about them.
Search no longer. . . the answers are all here in Falstaff's Complete
Beer Book. And that's not nearly all. You'll chuckle at author Fred
Birmingham's light-hearted history of beer . . . and you'll join him in a
brewery tour with the brewmaster as your guide. There's even a glos
sary of little-known brewing terms . . . because everyone should know
what a "zwickel" is! And wait 'til you try "Hungerburgers" made with
beer!
The perfect gift for Dad ... or a fraternity brother... or even for
Uncle Charley. In fact, this deluxe paperback belongs on every book
shelf and backbar!
