# Both Sides Claim Victory In Election Post-Mortem
## 
### ED KOHN 
The Republican Party, for only the
fifth time since the turn of the century,
managed to reverse a mid-year election
trend and gain seats in the Senate.
But the Democrats, more in keeping
with tradition, have increased their
numerical lead in the House of
Representatives and have recaptured
the majority of governorships, giving
them the statehouse advantage for the
first time since 1964.
As is usually the case in
hotly-contested political campaigns,
both sides were claiming victory. In San
Clemente, President Nixon said the
elections "tremendously strengthened
our hand" in the Senate. He said the
net Republican gain of two seats gave
him a "working majority" toward his
goal of "a full generation of peace."
In Washington, Democratic National
Committee chairman Lawrence F.
O'Brien said he "would be hard put to

call this (election) anything but a
defeat" for the Republicans.
"We find the Democratic Party a
majority party in America,"he
continued.
Here are the new compositions of
the Senate, the House, and the
governorships:
—The Senate is still controlled by
the Democrats, 54 -44 (assuming a
Hartke victory in Indiana). In addition,
there is one independent, Harry F.
Byrd Jr., who usually votes with the
Democrats, and one Conservative Party
member, James L. Buckley, who sides
with the Republicans.
—The Democrats increased their
holdings by at least eight seats in the
House of Representatives, bringing
their total to more than 250 seats.
—In the statehouses, the Democrats
scored impressive gains as they picked
off 13 GOP governors; the Republicans
were able to dump only two
Democrats. The Democrats now
control 29 governorships. They also
control most of the statehouses in the
industrial states from Pennsylvania to
Minnesota, and they added several key
victories in the South and in the West,
providing an unexpectedly strong base
for the 1972 presidential elections.
The net gain of 11 governorships
gives them the same advantage that the
1958 gubernatorial victories gave the
Kennedy campaign in 1960. The same
pattern was repeated four years ago
before the election of President Nixon.
The President and his staff had
concentrated heavily on the Senate
during the campaigning, sensing that
most of the Congressional opposition
to his programs and policies was
originating there. The White House won
two upset victories—the defeats of
Sens. Albert Gore and Joseph Tydings
by more conservative, Nixon-supported

Congressmen. Both Gore and Tydings
are strong opponents of the President's
foreign policies.
The Buckley victory in New York
was also seen as a strong presidential
victory. Buckley, who is a strong
supporter of the President, had received
campaign help from both the President
and the Vice President. In addition,
Vice President Agnew attacked Sen.
Charles Goodell for his "radical-liberal"
tendencies, and Nixon refused to
endorse the incumbent Republican
Senator.
Other Senate doves, including Gale
McGee, Vance Hartke, Harrison
Williams, Quinton Burdick, Frank Moss
and Philip Hart, were able to withstand
the protracted presidential
campaigning.
Yet the three major questions
around which the elections revolved
remain unanswered:
—Did the President gain the
"working majority" he was seeking in
the Senate, while not losing any
strength in the traditionally
conservative House?
—Has "New Politics"—student
involvement in groups such as
Movement for a New Congress—had
any effect on the political system; and,
if so, has the system responded in any
way to the pressures that caused last
spring's explosions; or have the
students themselves killed "New
Politics" through inaction?
—What are the effects of the massive
Democratic gubernatorial sweep
through the eastern half of the nation
coupled with the Democratic
resurgence in the Deep South?
The new Congress will convene in
January, and some of the questions will
be answered then; others will have to
wait until the next Presidential
extravaganza exactly two years hence.

CANVASSING INSTRUCTIONS—These students worked precincts before Tuesday's elections, but most did not. The turnout
for political activities was small, and many felt the two-day election holiday was unwarranted.
