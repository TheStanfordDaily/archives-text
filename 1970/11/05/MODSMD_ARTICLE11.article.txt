# Lived Here In 1870's
## Frenchman's Sojourns Wrapped In Legends 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
He fled here, hounded by
government police for editing an
underground newspaper. He used
another man's name and passport
to enter the country. He received
large sums of money from an
unidentified source. And he
disappeared suddenly, reportedly
kidnapped by government agents.
The above scenario might
describe the leader of a nationalist
movement in Indochina. But these
are actually details skimmed from
the life and legend of one Peter
Coutts, who in the 18 70's owned
and lived on much of what is now
the Stanford campus.
Reminders of his seven year
sojourn are scattered across the
University land area. The two
oldest structures on campus,
Escondido cottage and Tower
House, were the home and library
of "the Frenchman." There are
Frenchman's Hill, Frenchman's
Road and Peter Coutts Road.
Most intriguing is the medieval
style tower which stands off Old
Page Mill Road.
Lookout Tower
The gossips held, after Coutt's
departure, that he built it as a
lookout to warn him of the
approach of enemies. However,
the brick edifice seems to have
been part of an intricate irrigation
system the Frenchman had built
for his 1 242 acre Ayrshire Farm.
A beautiful artificial lake, filled
by the University in 1 922, and
myriad underground tunnels made
up portions of the water project.
The Frenchman and his family
appeared here one autumn day in
18 74. He purchased 1 400 acres of
land and started a celebrated
horse and cattle farm. From the
impressive organization of his
farm, the number of his
employees and the size of his
payrolls, he was obviously
wealthy. But he spoke neither of
the source of his wealth nor of his
background.
Stories of his riches were
popular. He reportedly received a
$75 00 payroll weeklyâ€”s 000 silver
dollars from San Francisco on
Friday and 2500 gold dollars from
San Jose on Saturday. His young
son Arthur was notorious for
throwing dollar coins as far as he
could into the bushes, and then
paying each of his friends $2.00
not to go chase them.

Coutts planned to build a
mansion on what is now Pine Hill.
His temporary home was the
cottage which was built even
before his arrival. (The cottage
later became the home of David
Starr Jordan, first President of
Stanford, who named it
Escondite-hidden.) Coutts housed
his valuable collection of paintings
and old books in Tower House.
In 1880, Coutts received a visit
from the FYench counsel in San
Francisco. He appeared visibly
disturbed afterwards.
The Frenchman soon left his
home for several months. He
returned in 18 81, but left again
the following year, this time with
his family. He seemingly planned
to return, as he instructed his
foreman to care for the property
as usual during his absence. But
after some months, word came
that the entire farm had been sold
to Senator Leland Stanford.
The legends which cropped up
about Coutts were even more
spectacular than Ayrshire Farm
itself. The San Francisco
Examiner of March 27, 1917
reports that Stanford sophomore
R.K. Beiver was searching the
irrigation tunnels for two million
dollars in buried gold.
Beiver stated that the
Frenchman was an emissary of
Napoleon 111 to South America,
who had embezzled huge sums of
money and fled to California.
Kidnapped by French government
agents, he was returned to France
to stand trial for high treason.
Convicted, and awaiting
execution, he was visited in prison
by Senator Stanford. Coutts
revealed the location of much of
the buried treasure to the Senator.
Always keen for a bargain
(remember the transcontinental
railway?), Stanford recovered
some $3 ,0 00,000. Beivers was
digging for the rest.
No Treasure Found
How Beivers discovered all this
no one knows. What is known is
that all the young student ever
found was an antique musket,
which he donated to the
University.
The true story of the
Frenchman would appeal to many
modern Stanford radicals. He was
Jean Baptiste Paulin Caperon, the
editor of the anti-royalist

newspaper, La Liberte'. Because
of their opposition to the regime
of Napoleon 111, Caperon, Victor
Hugo and other writers had to flee
to Switzerland in 1 8 7 4 .
Hounded by secret police,
Caperon decided to come to

America. To facilitate passage to
this country, the Frenchman used
the name and passport of his
cousin, Viscount Peter Coutts.
Caperon probably expected to
remain in California for the rest of
his life. It is known that he dearly

loved the quiet valley that had
become his adopted home.
But the political atmosphere in
France changed, and in 1880 the
French counsel informed
"Coutts" that if he returned
immediately to France, he might
recover his lost property. Caperon
was successful in this endeavor,
and though he wished to stay at
Ayrshire Farm, he acceded to the

wishes of his wife and returned
permanently to Paris in 18 82.
Jean Baptiste Paulin Caperon,
alias Peter Coutts, alias the
Frenchman, led a peaceful
existence for the remainder of his
life, and died in 1889.

WATCH TOWER OR WATER TOWER?- Peter Coutis tower, built by
French political exile Jean Baptiste Paulin Caperon, was by legend, a
look-out post where the first owner of the Stanford farm could keep
an eye out for his enemies. Later versions of the story identify the
tower as part of an intricate irrigation system developed by the
Frenchman.
