# University Budget Cut By 3.5 Million As Costs Continue Upward Spiral
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
The Budget Adjustment
Program's (BAP) goal of cutting
$2.5 million from the operating
budget of the University in four
years is being revised upwards.
The new target will be
approximately $3.5 million
ending in the 1 974-75 budget
instead of the 1973-74 budget.
The 40 percent budget cutting
increase is due to the increased
cost of security, creation of new
administrative positions,

non-faculty salary raises, and
expenditure levels which were
forecast too low for division
operations.
Although the University is not
in a full scale financial crisis,
extensive groundwork for a new
$260 million fund raising effort
over five years is being
implemented. Gifts and
contributions now total $30
million a year and "we want a rate
of $50 million a year as soon as
possible," states Ken Cuthbertson,
vice-president for finance.

The basic problem of the
University is that income increases
at a rate of 6-7 percent a year
while expenses grow at double
that rate. BAP plans on reducing
that difference by selective
cutting and reductions in the base
operating budget.
Budget Deficit
The projected $1.5 million
deficit in next year's budget is
mainly met by the use of
unrestricted general funds. These
funds presently total $5 .6 million
and the minimal allowable reserve
is two million.
BAP, coordinated by the
Provost's office, a faculty-student
advisory committee, and the
Financial office, determines the
severity of consequences of cuts.
Across the board percentage
slashes were rejected. Ray
Bachetti of the Provost's office
termed that suggestion
"irresponsible and mindless."
In achieving a balanced budget
by 19 75, priority is placed on
retaining minority employment,
student aid, and the mix of tenure
and non-tenure faculty.
Reductions are looked at in the
same manner on the academic and
non-academic side, but cuts in
instruction are the least preferred.
According to Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, "BAP is forcing us to be
more critical and evaluate courses
more closely. During the past 2 5
years of Stanford's expansion,
courses were being taught badly
or out of habit and tradition.
There is a push to decide what
services contribute educationally
and which others are nice to have,
but can be done without."
Faculty Expansion Ceased
Faculty expansion has virtually
ceased. Stagnation is a great
danger if no new funds are found.
When Humanities and Sciences
loses a senior professor, Dean Al
Hastorrf replaces him with a
junior professor. It keeps young
people with new ideas coming in
and entails budgetary savings. This
principle is deviated from if a new
program needs an experienced
person.
The BAP committee presents
its recommendations to the

Provost and President, who use
them in preparing the budget
presented to the Trustees at the
January meeting. This year the
deans were asked to determine the
effects of one, three, or five
percent reductions. The major
work of determining what is
expendable is done within the
division. Main problems are
hammered out in discussions with
the deans.
Criteria used by the deans to
determine the importance of a
program are the quality of the
operation which entails an
estimate of faculty quality and
the sum impression of the
educational excitement, and its
interrelationship with other areas
of knowledge.
Intellectually stimulating
courses are boosted if they need
the money. Attention is not
focused solely on savings.
Money hasn't been available
for growth lately. Chairman of the
faculty-student committee,
Professor Simpson remarks, "the
posture of the government is most
uncertain. The research support
may be leveling off, more
alteration in the mix may occur as
more money is available for
human welfare." Federal support
of-the Medical School increased
from $2.5 million to $14 million
in the last ten years.
Next year, the operating
budget is going up to $60 million
and tuition to $2610. However,
Kent Peterson, manager of
analytical studies, says, "tuition is
not the way to solve the financial
woes. Income increases have to
come from elsewhere; we are
really dependent on fund raising.
Optimistically, alumni and friends
will see our plight and give."
The financial crisis has not yet
caused the questions of the
optimum size of the University
and the best means of instruction
to be asked. But, as Dean Hastorrf
remarks, "we should give up the
mythology of everything to
everyone and point towards an
increased level of cooperation
with Berkeley. We can make it
available to students in areas with
a small interrelationship with
other areas of knowledge."

expendable is done within the
division. Main problems are
hammered out in discussions with
the deans.
Criteria used by the deans to
determine the importance of a
program are the quality of the
operation which entails an
estimate of faculty quality and
the sum impression of the
educational excitement, and its
interrelationship with other areas
of knowledge.
Intellectually stimulating
courses are boosted if they need
the money. Attention is not
focused solely on savings.
Money hasn't been available
for growth lately. Chairman of the
faculty-student committee,
Professor Simpson remarks, "the
posture of the government is most
uncertain. The research support
may be leveling off, more
alteration in the mix may occur as
more money is available for
human welfare." Federal support
of-the Medical School increased
from $2.5 million to $14 million
in the last ten years.
Next year, the operating
budget is going up to $60 million
and tuition to $2610. However,
Kent Peterson, manager of
analytical studies, says, "tuition is
not the way to solve the financial
woes. Income increases have to
come from elsewhere; we are
really dependent on fund raising.
Optimistically, alumni and friends
will see our plight and give."
The financial crisis has not yet
caused the questions of the
optimum size of the University
and the best means of instruction
to be asked. But, as Dean Hastorrf
remarks, "we should give up the
mythology of everything to
everyone and point towards an
increased level of cooperation
with Berkeley. We can make it
available to students in areas with
a small interrelationship with
other areas of knowledge."
The Budget Adjustment
Program's (BAP) goal of cutting
$2.5 million from the operating
budget of the University in four
years is being revised upwards.
The new target will be
approximately $3.5 million
ending in the 1 974-75 budget
instead of the 1973-74 budget.
The 40 percent budget cutting
increase is due to the increased
cost of security, creation of new
administrative positions,

non-faculty salary raises, and
expenditure levels which were
forecast too low for division
operations.
Although the University is not
in a full scale financial crisis,
extensive groundwork for a new
$260 million fund raising effort
over five years is being
implemented. Gifts and
contributions now total $30
million a year and "we want a rate
of $50 million a year as soon as
possible," states Ken Cuthbertson,
vice-president for finance.

The basic problem of the
University is that income increases
at a rate of 6-7 percent a year
while expenses grow at double
that rate. BAP plans on reducing
that difference by selective
cutting and reductions in the base
operating budget.
Budget Deficit
The projected $1.5 million
deficit in next year's budget is
mainly met by the use of
unrestricted general funds. These
funds presently total $5 .6 million
and the minimal allowable reserve
is two million.
BAP, coordinated by the
Provost's office, a faculty-student
advisory committee, and the
Financial office, determines the
severity of consequences of cuts.
Across the board percentage
slashes were rejected. Ray
Bachetti of the Provost's office
termed that suggestion
"irresponsible and mindless."
In achieving a balanced budget
by 19 75, priority is placed on
retaining minority employment,
student aid, and the mix of tenure
and non-tenure faculty.
Reductions are looked at in the
same manner on the academic and
non-academic side, but cuts in
instruction are the least preferred.
According to Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, "BAP is forcing us to be
more critical and evaluate courses
more closely. During the past 2 5
years of Stanford's expansion,
courses were being taught badly
or out of habit and tradition.
There is a push to decide what
services contribute educationally
and which others are nice to have,
but can be done without."
Faculty Expansion Ceased
Faculty expansion has virtually
ceased. Stagnation is a great
danger if no new funds are found.
When Humanities and Sciences
loses a senior professor, Dean Al
Hastorrf replaces him with a
junior professor. It keeps young
people with new ideas coming in
and entails budgetary savings. This
principle is deviated from if a new
program needs an experienced
person.
The BAP committee presents
its recommendations to the

Provost and President, who use
them in preparing the budget
presented to the Trustees at the
January meeting. This year the
deans were asked to determine the
effects of one, three, or five
percent reductions. The major

advisory committee, and the
Financial office, determines the
severity of consequences of cuts.
Across the board percentage
slashes were rejected. Ray
Bachetti of the Provost's office
termed that suggestion
"irresponsible and mindless."
In achieving a balanced budget
by 19 75, priority is placed on
retaining minority employment,
student aid, and the mix of tenure
and non-tenure faculty.
Reductions are looked at in the
same manner on the academic and
non-academic side, but cuts in
instruction are the least preferred.
According to Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, "BAP is forcing us to be
more critical and evaluate courses
more closely. During the past 2 5
years of Stanford's expansion,
courses were being taught badly
or out of habit and tradition.
There is a push to decide what
services contribute educationally
and which others are nice to have,
but can be done without."
Faculty Expansion Ceased
Faculty expansion has virtually
ceased. Stagnation is a great
danger if no new funds are found.
When Humanities and Sciences
loses a senior professor, Dean Al
Hastorrf replaces him with a
junior professor. It keeps young
people with new ideas coming in
and entails budgetary savings. This
principle is deviated from if a new
program needs an experienced
person.
The BAP committee presents
its recommendations to the

Provost and President, who use
them in preparing the budget
presented to the Trustees at the
January meeting. This year the
deans were asked to determine the
effects of one, three, or five
percent reductions. The major
work of determining what is
expendable is done within the
division. Main problems are
hammered out in discussions with
the deans.
Criteria used by the deans to
determine the importance of a
program are the quality of the
operation which entails an
estimate of faculty quality and
the sum impression of the
educational excitement, and its
interrelationship with other areas
of knowledge.
Intellectually stimulating
courses are boosted if they need
the money. Attention is not
focused solely on savings.
Money hasn't been available
for growth lately. Chairman of the
faculty-student committee,
Professor Simpson remarks, "the
posture of the government is most
uncertain. The research support
may be leveling off, more
alteration in the mix may occur as
more money is available for
human welfare." Federal support
of-the Medical School increased
from $2.5 million to $14 million
in the last ten years.
Next year, the operating
budget is going up to $60 million
and tuition to $2610. However,
Kent Peterson, manager of
analytical studies, says, "tuition is
not the way to solve the financial
woes. Income increases have to
come from elsewhere; we are
really dependent on fund raising.
Optimistically, alumni and friends
will see our plight and give."
The financial crisis has not yet
caused the questions of the
optimum size of the University
and the best means of instruction
to be asked. But, as Dean Hastorrf
remarks, "we should give up the
mythology of everything to
everyone and point towards an
increased level of cooperation
with Berkeley. We can make it
available to students in areas with
a small interrelationship with
other areas of knowledge."
