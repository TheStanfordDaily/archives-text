# Tribe Defense Leads League
## 
### 
Stanford's football
defense—seeming to improve
almost each time out—has climbed
to the top of Pac-8 defensive
statistics.
The Indians are allowing an
average of 303 yards per game in
total defense, six fewer yards per
game than USC.
The Tribe is listed second
behind the Trojans in rushing
defense—giving up 128 yards—and
second to Washington in pass
defense—allowing an average of
1 75 yards.
Those fwo second-places added
together put them on top.
Stanford is also ranked second
in total offense, just two yards
behind USC's 45 3 yard average,
and is tied for first with Oregon in
passing offense with a 278
average.
The Indians' weakest category
is rushing offense where they are
fifth with a 174 mark. But Cai
and UCLA—fourth and third—are
just one and two yards ahead.
In individual Pac-8 statistics,
quarterback Jim Plunkett
maintains his season-long lead in
total offense, averaging 269.5
yards per game. Washington's
Sonny Sixkiller is second with
222.3.
Plunkett also leads the
conference in passing yardage
with a 2 48 .1 mark, ahead of
Sixkiller who trails with 230.3.
The Card phenom is also
negotiating his way to breaking
his own season total offense
record set last year of 2,78 6
yards. He has 2,15 6 with three
games to go.
In national numbers, Plunkett
is second in total offense,
averaging five fewer yards per
game than Auburn's Pat Sullivan
who leads with a 27 4.4 mark.
With 16.5 completions per game
Jim is seventh in national passing
which is led by Sixkiller with 19.0
passes per game.
The Cards are sixth nationally
in total offense, fourth in forward

passing offense and 11th in
scoring. Place kicker Steve
Horowitz has climbed to sixth
place in kick-scoring with 5 3
points, a 6.6 average per game.
Back in the league statistics,
Eric Cross is ranked first in punt
returns with a 13.3 average, three
yards ahead of his nearest
competitor.
Randy Vataha is tied for
fourth in pass receiving with 35
receptions, the same as Jeff
Kolberg, Bob Moore and Jim
Sweeney.
Jackie Brown is the league's
sixth best rusher with 499 yards
and a 62.4 average and Hillary
Shockley is ninth with 408 yards
and a 51.0 average.
Steve Horowtiz is second in
Pac-8 scoring with 53 points, 13
behind Oregon's Bob Moore.
In five league games Stanford
has out-scored its opponents 177
to 5 7 and in all games the club has
a 259 toll 4 advantage.

THE CRUNCH—Frosh running back John Winesberry is about to get caught in a two-man squeeze in
action during last week's 20-17 victory over Cal Poly at Stanford Stadium. Low point for the Tribe was
the loss of tight end Barry Cernoch who left for the season with a broken leg on a punt play. Tomorrow
the Cards play their third of four games, taking on the USC Trobabes, who perennially field a top-notch
squad. Game time is 2 p.m. Earlier the Card freshmen dropped a 20-19 thriller to the UCLA frosh.
