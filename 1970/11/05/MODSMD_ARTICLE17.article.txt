# Frosh Face USC Tomorrow
## 
### TOM QUINN 
USC's little Trojans, 42-21
victors over Cal, will be
prospective victims for the frosh
football team Friday at 2 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium. Coach Bill
Moultrie's gridders have gone
through one of their roughest
weeks in preparation for a contest
which Moultrie regards as a "must
win."
Moultrie noted that USC,
which always fields a good team,
will be featuring a high school
Ail-American from Serra
High—just down the road from
Stanford—Lynn Swann. Swann
plays both ways for the Trojans as
flanker on offense and deep back
on the defensive side.
"Southern California has good
personnel once again. They've

been a perennial winner and
consequently have attracted the
quality players, something which
we hope to change this year. They
have a large team and run a
balanced attack. Neither the
running game nor the passing
attack dominates the other,"
Moultrie added.
Better Yet
On the Stanford side, Moultrie
was quick to point out that the
Papooses will be better prepared
than they were in their 2 0-17 win
over Cal Poly last Friday.
However, the team took a beating
physically last week and some of
the players won't bein top shape
for the SC affair.
Quarterbacks Eric Test and
Mike Gilyard are both suffering
from gimpy ankles, thus placing
the starting job on s 'B", 1551b
Doug Collom.
Yet the big loss was tight
Barry Cernoch who broke his leg
in the Cal Poly game. He'll be out
for 6 to 8 weeks and won't play
again until the spring. Also
sidelined are Curt Brohard and
David Walker who are listed as
doubtful performers.
Ironically, the Cal Poly game,
though a 20-17 victory, was
regarded by Coach Moultrie as a
poorer game that the 20-19 loss to
UCLA.
"The team just didn't perform
as it could have. It just wasn't as
close knit as it could have been.
I'm not really satisfied with the
overall progress of the team
because we have the potential to
do better," Moultrie said.
Against Cal Poly, the Papooses

roared back after being down 9-0
four minutes into the third
quarter. James Ferguson, rated
Player of the Week by Coach
Moultrie, ran the kickoff back 90
yards for a TD which, coupled
with a successful PAT, brought
Stanford within two points.
However, the momentum
really changed hands after
Cernoch's leg was broken when
his punt was blocked. The
Papoose defense held deep in its
own territory and then recovered
a Cal Poly fumble on Cal's 35 in
the next series. Quickly, Test fired
a 35 yard touchdown strike to
Ferguson, enabling Stanford to
gain the lead for the first time,
13-9.
Winesberry Scores
At the beginning of the fourth
quarter, Ferguson again ignited a
drive with a great run off an inside
trap play. Test brought the ball to
Cal Poly's 35 on a 33 yard
scramble and then slipped a swing
pass to John Winesberry for a first
down on the 25. After pass
interference was ruled on Cal
Poly, Test hit Terry Pape in the
end zone from the three. The
successful extra point upped the
score 20-9, Stanford.
Cal Poly scored with 2:48
remaining in the game to bring
itself within three points.
In addition to Ferguson, coach

Moultrie singled out halfback
John Winesberry as having an
outstanding game. Winesberry
gained 89 yards rushing and had a
45 yard run called back on a
holding penalty. In the line,
Moultrie cited offensive tackle
Reuben Monmouth and defensive
tackle twins Mark and John
Ferguson. Monmouth was
exceptional at getting downfield
for the blocks on Winesberry's
end runs, a fact especially
noteworthy since Monmouth tips
the scales at 260 lbs. The
Ferguson twins anchored a
defensive line that held numerous
times deep inside its own
territory.
Loose Balls
In preparation for USC,
Moultrie has worked on cutting
down the fumbles and
interceptions which killed all of
Stanford's sustained efforts.
Moultrie labelled the problems as
"all a matter of execution which
should be remedied by improved
timing and mental alertness. The
defensive backfield difficulties
evident last Friday have been
worked on this week and
shouldn't happen against
Southern Cal.
"I wouldn't want a broken leg
a game to be the impetus to the
players to start knocking people
around," Coach Moultrie added.
