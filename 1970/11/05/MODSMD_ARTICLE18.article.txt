## WRA-Sports For The Ladies

By DEBBIE GILBERT
Besides being three capital
letters constituting an
abbreviation, The W.R.A.
(Women's Recreation Association)
is the organization on campus,
separate from the women's
physical education department, to

promote and provide recreational
activities for all women associated
with the university.
Along with sponsoring
intramurals, such as tennis in the
fall and basketball in the winter, it
is the W.R.A. that provides the
open pool hours as well as backing

the opening of the women's gym
nights for extra activities such as
dance and badminton. Any meets
to which Stanford is hostess are
financed by this organization. Its
purpose is to provide both
intramural and intercollegiate
activities for the women.
Every sport including folk and
contemporary dance has a
manager who proposes a tentative
budget for their activities. The
W.R.A. then decides on how
much it can allot to each, and
follows through each year with its
decision. The dorms themselves
may check out equipment for use
on any dorm facilities.
This year, the W.R.A.'s aim is
to provide the recreation and
facilities the women request. It
hopes to create more intramural
matches, all women or co-ed; keep
the gym open certain nights for
desired activities; and encourage
the women at Stanford to become
more interested in and particiate
in physical as well as mental
activities.
Any suggestions or requests are
welcome. There is a box provided
for these right inside the women's
gym.
