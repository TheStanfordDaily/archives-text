# Hockey Club Blasts Bears
## 
### 
A three-goal "hat trick"
performance by center Ed
Leonard led the Stanford ice
hockey club to a convincing 8-2
win over the University of
California Monday night in San
Francisco.
It was the first meeting of the
season between the rivals and it
left the Indians with a 3-0-1

record in the big-game-on-ice
series started last year.
Balance was the key to
Stanford's improved offensive
showing. Leonard's three goals
were assisted by sharp passing of
first-line wingers Paul Tittmann
and Will Mcllvaine.
Player-coach Pat Baldwin
added two goals and Bob Kadlec,
Dave McCaffrey and Rich Jaros

each scored one to complete the
scoring.
Stanford's defense showed
improvement around the sterling
goalie work of Rick Bragdon, but
a couple momentary lapses by his
teammates prevented him from
finishing a shutout which he had
until the final minutes of the third
period.
The Tribe now goes into a
three-week mid-quarter break
with a 2-1 record in Bay Area
Hockey League play. The team's
three remaining games will be
played at Belmont Iceland, the
next one scheduled for 9 p.m.
Nov. 2 4 against Berkeley.
