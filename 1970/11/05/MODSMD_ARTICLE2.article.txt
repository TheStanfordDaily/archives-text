# Little Political Action
## Two-Day Election Break Criticized 
### RALPH KOSTANT SCOTT THACHER 
Student political involvement did
not justify the two-day election break,
according to local campaign organizers.
Representatives of the Movement
for a New Congress (MNC), Student
Committee for Involvement in Politics
(SCIP), and student managers of the
Stuart McLean congressional campaign
say that the recess probably had little
effect on the level of student
participation or on the results of the
election.
Though pleased with the student
turnout at their headquarters in Palo
Alto, the MNC regional coordinators all
opposed the break. Art Bushkin noted
that most of the work done in a
campaign is completed by the last two
days prior to the election. "The voter
registration, canvassing, preparing of
packets all must be done in the weeks
before the election," he said.
About 150 people, most of them
Stanford students were processed
through the MNC office Tuesday.
These workers walked 50 precincts in
an effort to get traditionally apathetic
Democratic voters to the polls.
Democratic headquarters drew enough
volunteers to walk another 60
precincts.

Paul MacGregor, another MNC
coordinator, does not feel that this
unusual influx of precinct workers
justifies the break. "Almost all the
work done on Tuesday began after
2:00 p.m.," he pointed out. "There was
no need to dismiss an entire day of
classes to free students for political
action."
Some Gains Noted
But the former Stanford law student
and director of Toyon Hall did feel the
precinct coverage yielded dividends in
San Mateo County. The upset victory
of Arlen Gregorio in the State Senate
election may have resulted from the
abnormally large Democratic turnout.
The triumph of the thirty-nine year
old Gregorio broke the Republican
majority in the California State Senate.
Democrats also seized a majority in the
State Assembly. These phenomena will
greatly handicap Gov. Ronald Reagan
and may have national political
significance.
John Tunney could have beaten Sen.
George Murphy without statewide
student support, according to the MNC
coordinators, but his margin of victory
would not have been nearly so
comfortable.

A major disappointment to many
students was the landslide victory of
incumbent Congressman Charles
Gubser over Stuart McLean, an anti-war
Presbyterian clergyman. Workers in
McLean's campaign were embittered
over the poor turnout of Stanford
students during the weeks preceding
the election.
Sophomore Larry Diamond, who
managed precinct operations for
McLean, stated that only half of the
precincts in the 10 th Congressional
district were canvassed adequately. "I
lay the blame for this directly on
Stanford," Diamond said.
He pointed out the difficulty of
defeating an incumbent Congressman.
"It's impossible without a massive
door-to-door campaign, and we didn't
have enough manpower to do that. We
had 50 0 precinct workers. We needed
twice that many."
Diamond feels that the canvassing
does bring results. For example, in a
precinct covered by himself, five
households who supported George
Murphy voted for McLean, a Democrat.
Few Regular Workers
Only about 30 Stanford students
worked regularly throughout the

McLean campaign. Perhaps 150
volunteers appeared on Tuesday.
Both Diamond and campaign
manager Chris Harte doubted the long
weekend was of much value to
Stanford students or political
candidates. "It may have given some
people guilt feelings," Harte
commented. He feels a recess "doesn't
have much effect on elections," and
that just as many students would have
worked without the days off.
Both the MNC coordinators and the
McLean workers proposed the granting
of academic credit for political activity
as an alternative to an election break.
Diamond carries such a program this
quarter, and will receive 18 units of
credit in sociology and political science
when he completes his evaluation of his
political activities in December.
"Courses such as mine were available
to everyone. Lack of opportunity can't
be used as an excuse for
non-involvement," Diamond argues.
Young Republican President Don
Ayer estimates that only 25-30
students reported to SCIP to work for
GOP candidates. He claims that four to
five times as many worked in 1968. "I
would be completely against another
such weekend," he said of the election
break.
