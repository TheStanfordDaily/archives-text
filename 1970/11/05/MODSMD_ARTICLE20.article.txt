# PhD Candidates Find Jobs Scarce
## 
### CHRIS KATZENBACH 
If you're a graduate student
working towards a doctorate, or if
you're a recent Ph.D., you're
probably finding that the Ph.D.
isn't the magic carpet to
professional success that it once
seemed to be. In fact, you may be
finding it difficult to get any job
at all.
Part of the problem is the
number of Ph.D.'s on the market.
Professor Lewis B. Mayhew,
Education, recently completed a
survey of graduate programs
across the country. In 1968-69,
26,100 Ph.D.'s were conferred, an
increase of 9,500 degrees over the
number awarded in 1 96 4-65. If
the programs continue to grow at
the past rate, Mayhew estimates
that there will be 67,000
doctorates produced in 1980.
Ralph Keller, Director of the
Placement Service, feels that the
shortage of jobs is due mainly to
the transition from a
"war-oriented to a more
civilian-oriented economy." As
priorities change, the number of
jobs in one area may decline
without an immediate increase in
jobs in another area. For example,
Keller pointed to the aerospace
industry which has received much
of its money from the
Department of Defense. As
programs are completed, jobs will
decline. North American
Rockwell has essentially
completed its NASA contract for
the Apollo spacecraft, resulting in
loss of the jobs that were
involved.
Courses Dropped
Keller also noted that many
universities are dropping many of
their required courses (for
example English and Western
Civilization at Stanford).

the past, our students had ten or
twelve jobs offered to them, they
now have only three or four, and
not where they want them; not in
LaJolla, but in Aberdeen."
Similar opinions are given by
most faculty members. Professor
Sanford . Dornbusch, Sociology,
reports that there doesn't seem to
be a decline in the job offers for
Stanford graduates; there even
seems to be some increase in the
number of jobs offered over last
year. In the Psychology
department a faculty member
claimed "there hasn't been a
dramatic drop off in job openings
for Stanford; all our people have
been placed in jobs comparable to
other years. The situation in other
schools isn't so good. In the
University of Michigan and the
University of Illinois the situation
is really disastrous."

Formerly these programs provided Professor Jean Mayers,
employment for large numbers of vice-Chairman of the Department

communications systems, traffic
control, and others. The job
shortage now is only part of a
cycle, and it will improve in time,
according to Mayers. He
particularly looked for an increase
in the number of job
opportunities in programs to
combat pollution.
Professor Walter Meyerhof,
Physics, was somewhat more
pessimistic about the present
situation for physicists. He
reported that there was "between
one and two percent
i unemployment for physicists at
i this time." Most graduates want

• Ph.D.'s awarded since January,

i graduates are in post-doctoral
research-assistant positions.

Meyerhof said that more and
more new physicists were going
into post-doctoral programs,
which he described as a "holding
operation," "to delay hunting for
jobs for another two or three
years." The number of
post-doctoral positions has risen
by 50 percent nationally since
1968, according to a NASA
survey.
To help provide jobs for new
Ph.D.'s in physics, graduate
programs are being cut. Nationally
there has been a 30 percent
(i iback. The money that would
have been used to produce more
Ph.D.'s is now providing positions
as research assistants for the new
Ph.D. Hopefully, Meyerhof said,
federally-financed programs to
fight pollution will help provide
needed jobs.
While faculty and the
administration remain
"optimistic" on the employment
situation, many graduate students
have a somewhat different view.
Classified Market Large
Ken Lorell, an engineering
student, responded that, while
there were jobs, they were mostly
offered by large corporations,
with substantial DoD financing.
"If you don't want to work on
classified research, you're cutting
yourself out of a big part of the
market. If you don't want to get
involved with classified stuff,
there's almost nowhere to go."
Generally the smaller companies
don't interview at Stanford. It's
often difficult to find out if they
have any jobs available, and the
competition for these jobs is high.
"I don't know one guy who wants
to go down and get involved with
Lockheed; get involved with that
bullshit."
Mark Weiss, biophysics,
explained that the uncertainty
and failure of federal funding
makes it difficult to find out if a
job vacancy will actually be killed.
Thus, when one professor tells his
colleague at Stanford that a
vacancy has occurred on his
faculty, there is still uncertainty
about the job.
Just because there are jobs
doesn't mean that they are
desirable ones. Julie Howell,
anthropology, remarked that most
anthropologists are shying away
from anything that involves
government or corporate work as
a result of unpleasant experiences
in the past (notably research in
Thailand used for
counter-insurgency). This leaves
mostly academic positions, and
they are getting scarcer.

At the same time women have
an extremely difficult time
finding jobs. Most of the time
employers claim that women are
too "unreliable" for good
positions. Miss Howell pointed
out that, although the
anthropology department has a
large number of women students,
it has only one woman faculty
member, a lecturer. Likewise,
women tend to be forgotten when
jobs are heard of through the
"buddy system." When a
professor hears of a job, he almost
always recommends a man rather
than a woman for the position.
Women Excluded
Women tend to be excluded
from the elite institutions, or if
accepted, assigned to a low
rank—essentially forever. Howell
mentioned one case at Harvard
where a couple who have always
worked together are at opposite
ends of the department. The
actual number of women in
academic positions has been
declining over the last thirty
years.
There are other reasons not to
be so optimistic over the number
of jobs. Lockheed recently laid
off a large number of experienced
engineers, yet was at Stanford
hiring more engineers last
Wednesday. According to an
ex-Lockheed employee, it is
cheaper for the company to hire
new people than to train the old
employees in new methods, and it
involves less salary.

shortage now is only part of a
cycle, and it will improve in time,
according to Mayers. He
particularly looked for an increase
in the number of job
opportunities in programs to

Professor Walter Meyerhof,
Physics, was somewhat more
pessimistic about the present
situation for physicists. He
reported that there was "between

Meyerhof said that more and
more new physicists were going
into post-doctoral programs,
which he described as a "holding
operation," "to delay hunting for
jobs for another two or three
years." The number of
post-doctoral positions has risen
by 50 percent nationally since
1968, according to a NASA
survey.
To help provide jobs for new
Ph.D.'s in physics, graduate
programs are being cut. Nationally
there has been a 30 percent
(i iback. The money that would
have been used to produce more
Ph.D.'s is now providing positions

Ph.D. Hopefully, Meyerhof said,
federally-financed programs to
fight pollution will help provide
needed jobs.
While faculty and the
administration remain
"optimistic" on the employment
situation, many graduate students
have a somewhat different view.
Classified Market Large
Ken Lorell, an engineering
student, responded that, while
there were jobs, they were mostly
offered by large corporations,
with substantial DoD financing.
"If you don't want to work on
classified research, you're cutting
yourself out of a big part of the
market. If you don't want to get
involved with classified stuff,
there's almost nowhere to go."
Generally the smaller companies
don't interview at Stanford. It's
often difficult to find out if they
have any jobs available, and the
competition for these jobs is high.
"I don't know one guy who wants
to go down and get involved with
Lockheed; get involved with that
bullshit."
Mark Weiss, biophysics,
explained that the uncertainty
and failure of federal funding
makes it difficult to find out if a
job vacancy will actually be killed.
Thus, when one professor tells his
colleague at Stanford that a
vacancy has occurred on his
faculty, there is still uncertainty
about the job.
Just because there are jobs
doesn't mean that they are
desirable ones. Julie Howell,
anthropology, remarked that most
anthropologists are shying away
from anything that involves
government or corporate work as
a result of unpleasant experiences
in the past (notably research in
Thailand used for
counter-insurgency). This leaves
mostly academic positions, and
they are getting scarcer.

At the same time women have
an extremely difficult time
finding jobs. Most of the time
employers claim that women are
too "unreliable" for good
positions. Miss Howell pointed
out that, although the
anthropology department has a
large number of women students,
it has only one woman faculty
member, a lecturer. Likewise,
women tend to be forgotten when
jobs are heard of through the
"buddy system." When a
professor hears of a job, he almost
always recommends a man rather
than a woman for the position.
Women Excluded
Women tend to be excluded
from the elite institutions, or if
accepted, assigned to a low
rank—essentially forever. Howell
mentioned one case at Harvard
where a couple who have always
worked together are at opposite
ends of the department. The
actual number of women in
academic positions has been
declining over the last thirty
years.
There are other reasons not to
be so optimistic over the number
of jobs. Lockheed recently laid
off a large number of experienced
engineers, yet was at Stanford
hiring more engineers last
Wednesday. According to an
ex-Lockheed employee, it is
cheaper for the company to hire
new people than to train the old
employees in new methods, and it
involves less salary.
If you're a graduate student
working towards a doctorate, or if
you're a recent Ph.D., you're
probably finding that the Ph.D.
isn't the magic carpet to
professional success that it once
seemed to be. In fact, you may be
finding it difficult to get any job
at all.
Part of the problem is the
number of Ph.D.'s on the market.
Professor Lewis B. Mayhew,
Education, recently completed a
survey of graduate programs
across the country. In 1968-69,
26,100 Ph.D.'s were conferred, an
increase of 9,500 degrees over the
number awarded in 1 96 4-65. If
the programs continue to grow at
the past rate, Mayhew estimates
that there will be 67,000
doctorates produced in 1980.
Ralph Keller, Director of the
Placement Service, feels that the
shortage of jobs is due mainly to
the transition from a
"war-oriented to a more
civilian-oriented economy." As
priorities change, the number of
jobs in one area may decline
without an immediate increase in
jobs in another area. For example,
Keller pointed to the aerospace
industry which has received much
of its money from the

according to Mayers. He

Professor Walter Meyerhof,

pessimistic about the present
situation for physicists. He
reported that there was "between

Meyerhof said that more and
more new physicists were going
into post-doctoral programs,
which he described as a "holding
operation," "to delay hunting for
jobs for another two or three
years." The number of
post-doctoral positions has risen
by 50 percent nationally since
1968, according to a NASA
survey.
To help provide jobs for new
Ph.D.'s in physics, graduate
programs are being cut. Nationally
there has been a 30 percent
(i iback. The money that would
have been used to produce more
Ph.D.'s is now providing positions

Ph.D. Hopefully, Meyerhof said,
federally-financed programs to
fight pollution will help provide
needed jobs.
While faculty and the
administration remain
"optimistic" on the employment
situation, many graduate students
have a somewhat different view.
Classified Market Large
Ken Lorell, an engineering
student, responded that, while
there were jobs, they were mostly
offered by large corporations,
with substantial DoD financing.
"If you don't want to work on
classified research, you're cutting
yourself out of a big part of the
market. If you don't want to get
involved with classified stuff,
there's almost nowhere to go."
Generally the smaller companies
don't interview at Stanford. It's
often difficult to find out if they
have any jobs available, and the
competition for these jobs is high.
"I don't know one guy who wants
to go down and get involved with
Lockheed; get involved with that
bullshit."
Mark Weiss, biophysics,
explained that the uncertainty
and failure of federal funding
makes it difficult to find out if a
job vacancy will actually be killed.
Thus, when one professor tells his
colleague at Stanford that a
vacancy has occurred on his
faculty, there is still uncertainty
about the job.
Just because there are jobs
doesn't mean that they are
desirable ones. Julie Howell,
anthropology, remarked that most
anthropologists are shying away
from anything that involves
government or corporate work as
a result of unpleasant experiences
in the past (notably research in
Thailand used for
counter-insurgency). This leaves
mostly academic positions, and
they are getting scarcer.

At the same time women have
an extremely difficult time
finding jobs. Most of the time
employers claim that women are
too "unreliable" for good
positions. Miss Howell pointed
out that, although the
anthropology department has a
large number of women students,
it has only one woman faculty
member, a lecturer. Likewise,
women tend to be forgotten when
jobs are heard of through the
"buddy system." When a
professor hears of a job, he almost
always recommends a man rather
than a woman for the position.
Women Excluded
Women tend to be excluded
from the elite institutions, or if
accepted, assigned to a low
rank—essentially forever. Howell
mentioned one case at Harvard
where a couple who have always
worked together are at opposite
ends of the department. The
actual number of women in
academic positions has been
declining over the last thirty
years.
There are other reasons not to
be so optimistic over the number
of jobs. Lockheed recently laid
off a large number of experienced
engineers, yet was at Stanford
hiring more engineers last
Wednesday. According to an
ex-Lockheed employee, it is
cheaper for the company to hire
new people than to train the old
employees in new methods, and it
involves less salary.
If you're a graduate student
working towards a doctorate, or if
you're a recent Ph.D., you're
probably finding that the Ph.D.
isn't the magic carpet to
professional success that it once
seemed to be. In fact, you may be
finding it difficult to get any job
at all.
Part of the problem is the
number of Ph.D.'s on the market.
Professor Lewis B. Mayhew,
Education, recently completed a
survey of graduate programs
across the country. In 1968-69,
26,100 Ph.D.'s were conferred, an
increase of 9,500 degrees over the
number awarded in 1 96 4-65. If
the programs continue to grow at
the past rate, Mayhew estimates
that there will be 67,000
doctorates produced in 1980.
Ralph Keller, Director of the
Placement Service, feels that the
shortage of jobs is due mainly to
the transition from a
"war-oriented to a more
civilian-oriented economy." As
priorities change, the number of
jobs in one area may decline
without an immediate increase in
jobs in another area. For example,
Keller pointed to the aerospace
industry which has received much
of its money from the
Department of Defense. As
programs are completed, jobs will
decline. North American
Rockwell has essentially
completed its NASA contract for
the Apollo spacecraft, resulting in
loss of the jobs that were
involved.
Courses Dropped
Keller also noted that many
universities are dropping many of
their required courses (for
example English and Western
Civilization at Stanford).

twelve jobs offered to them, they

reports that there doesn't seem to

claimed "there hasn't been a

Meyerhof said that more and
more new physicists were going
into post-doctoral programs,
which he described as a "holding
operation," "to delay hunting for
jobs for another two or three
years." The number of
post-doctoral positions has risen
by 50 percent nationally since
1968, according to a NASA
survey.

fight pollution will help provide

While faculty and the
administration remain
"optimistic" on the employment
situation, many graduate students
have a somewhat different view.
Classified Market Large
Ken Lorell, an engineering
student, responded that, while
there were jobs, they were mostly
offered by large corporations,
with substantial DoD financing.
"If you don't want to work on
classified research, you're cutting
yourself out of a big part of the
market. If you don't want to get
involved with classified stuff,
there's almost nowhere to go."
Generally the smaller companies
don't interview at Stanford. It's
often difficult to find out if they
have any jobs available, and the
competition for these jobs is high.
"I don't know one guy who wants
to go down and get involved with
Lockheed; get involved with that
bullshit."
Mark Weiss, biophysics,
explained that the uncertainty
and failure of federal funding
makes it difficult to find out if a
job vacancy will actually be killed.
Thus, when one professor tells his
colleague at Stanford that a
vacancy has occurred on his
faculty, there is still uncertainty
about the job.
Just because there are jobs
doesn't mean that they are
desirable ones. Julie Howell,
anthropology, remarked that most
anthropologists are shying away
from anything that involves
government or corporate work as
a result of unpleasant experiences
in the past (notably research in
Thailand used for
counter-insurgency). This leaves
mostly academic positions, and
they are getting scarcer.

At the same time women have
an extremely difficult time
finding jobs. Most of the time
employers claim that women are
too "unreliable" for good
positions. Miss Howell pointed
out that, although the
anthropology department has a
large number of women students,
it has only one woman faculty
member, a lecturer. Likewise,
women tend to be forgotten when
jobs are heard of through the
"buddy system." When a
professor hears of a job, he almost
always recommends a man rather
than a woman for the position.
Women Excluded
Women tend to be excluded
from the elite institutions, or if
accepted, assigned to a low
rank—essentially forever. Howell
mentioned one case at Harvard
where a couple who have always
worked together are at opposite
ends of the department. The
actual number of women in
academic positions has been
declining over the last thirty
years.
There are other reasons not to
be so optimistic over the number
of jobs. Lockheed recently laid
off a large number of experienced
engineers, yet was at Stanford
hiring more engineers last
Wednesday. According to an
ex-Lockheed employee, it is
cheaper for the company to hire
new people than to train the old
employees in new methods, and it
involves less salary.
If you're a graduate student
working towards a doctorate, or if
you're a recent Ph.D., you're
probably finding that the Ph.D.
isn't the magic carpet to
professional success that it once
seemed to be. In fact, you may be
finding it difficult to get any job
at all.
Part of the problem is the
number of Ph.D.'s on the market.
Professor Lewis B. Mayhew,
Education, recently completed a
survey of graduate programs
across the country. In 1968-69,
26,100 Ph.D.'s were conferred, an
increase of 9,500 degrees over the
number awarded in 1 96 4-65. If
the programs continue to grow at
the past rate, Mayhew estimates
that there will be 67,000
doctorates produced in 1980.
Ralph Keller, Director of the
Placement Service, feels that the
shortage of jobs is due mainly to
the transition from a
"war-oriented to a more
civilian-oriented economy." As
priorities change, the number of
jobs in one area may decline
without an immediate increase in
jobs in another area. For example,
Keller pointed to the aerospace
industry which has received much
of its money from the
Department of Defense. As
programs are completed, jobs will
decline. North American
Rockwell has essentially
completed its NASA contract for
the Apollo spacecraft, resulting in
loss of the jobs that were
involved.
Courses Dropped
Keller also noted that many
universities are dropping many of
their required courses (for
example English and Western
Civilization at Stanford).

the past, our students had ten or
twelve jobs offered to them, they
now have only three or four, and
not where they want them; not in
LaJolla, but in Aberdeen."
Similar opinions are given by
most faculty members. Professor
Sanford . Dornbusch, Sociology,
reports that there doesn't seem to
be a decline in the job offers for
Stanford graduates; there even
seems to be some increase in the
number of jobs offered over last
year. In the Psychology
department a faculty member
claimed "there hasn't been a
dramatic drop off in job openings
for Stanford; all our people have
been placed in jobs comparable to
other years. The situation in other
schools isn't so good. In the
University of Michigan and the
University of Illinois the situation
is really disastrous."

Formerly these programs provided Professor Jean Mayers,
employment for large numbers of vice-Chairman of the Department

control, and others. The job
shortage now is only part of a
cycle, and it will improve in time,
according to Mayers. He
particularly looked for an increase
in the number of job
opportunities in programs to
combat pollution.
Professor Walter Meyerhof,
Physics, was somewhat more
pessimistic about the present
situation for physicists. He
reported that there was "between
one and two percent
