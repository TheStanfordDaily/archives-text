Murphy Retires Quietly
LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. George Murphy,
somewhat jelatedly conceding defeat in his bid for a
second six-year term, said Wednesday he has no plans
to personally congratulate his Democratic successor,
Rep. John V. Tunney of Riverside.
The 68-year-old Beverly Hills Republican, long
associated with the motion picture industry and GOP
fund-raising and campaign causes, smiled occasionally
but displayed little emotion at a news conference.
Asked if he planned to telephone Tunney,
3 6-year-old son of former heavyweight boxing
champion Gene Tunney, Murphy said: "I don't see any
necessity for that ... I have no particular desire to talk
to him personally."
The senator, dressed in a conservative, dark blue
suit, said he planned to telephone President Nixon to
thank him for his campaign help.
Future plans? "Oh, I plan to do a little golfing."
He said he anticipated no offers of a federal
appointive post although said he might be interested.
Berkeley Elects 'Radical 9
OAKLAND — Black Congressman-elect Ronald V.
Dellums said Wednesday, "I think the 7th
Congressional District has just elected a radical."
Dellums, a 34-year-old Berkeley city councilman,
returned a salute of clenched fist by young shouting
supporters as he appeared at a victory celebration at
the Leamington Hotel.
As the predominantly black group yelled, "Right
on, Ron," Dellums said that a new political coalition is
"going to change this country."
Dellums defeated John Healy, a 25-year-old Albany
finance company officer, Tuesday by an 88,737 to
63,819 vote.
In the primary, Dellums downed six-term
Democratic liberal Rep. Jeffrey Cohelan.
Dellums' district embraces Albany, Berkeley,
Emerville, Piedmont and part of Oakland and has a 40
percent black population. It is so heavily Democratic,
143,000 to 64,000 that Republicans had not
campaigned there seriously for years.

Agnew, however, called Dellums "an enthusiastic
supporter of the Black Panther party ... a man who
happily shared platforms with Black Panthers... a
man who says 'my politics are to bring walls down."
Dellums has said Black Panthers have "a legitimate
right to function in society."
Nixon Claims Victory
SAN CLEMENTE — Claiming victory in the off-year
balloting, President Nixon said today he feels he has
gained "a working majority" on key issues in both the
Senate and House—even though Democrats remain in
the majority in Congress.
Speaking to newsmen at the Western White House,
Nixon said he feels the election produced enough
ideological shifts so he will have a majority on defense
and foreign policy issues in the 1971 Congress.
The chief executive said he felt, 'The results of this
election will not go unnoticed abroad."
"I believe that our hand has been strengthened."
At the same time, Nixon acknowledged that top
Democrats have been making victory claims on the
basis of governorship races. He said such claims had
justification.
Earlier the President, who made a major investment
of time and energy in the 1970 campaign, ws as
described as well satisfied with the balloting outcome
for Senate and House seats.
Angela Out Of Solitary
NEW YORK — A federal judge ordered Wednesday an
end to solitary confinement for black militant Angela
Davis, who is lodged in the Women's House of
Detention in Greenwich Village.
Miss Davis, 26, a former university instructor
waiting extradition to California on charges of murder
and kidnap, was ordered to be "housed with the
general inmate population and afforded all privileges
enjoyed by them."
Judge Morris E. Lasker, in a 13 -page opinion, said
corrections officials had failed to prove that Miss Davis'
presence among other prisoners posed a threat to her
safety or that of other inmates.

She was arrested in New York Oct. 13 and is
fighting extradition on the charges. A hearing was
scheduled for Nov. 20.
Soledad Disturbances
SALINAS — Prisoners broke windows, set bedding fires
and plugged shower drains at the Soledad Correctional
Facility Wednesday morning, prison officials said.
The disturbance, in four wings of the prison's
central facility, came on the same day as the Monterey
County Superior Court arraignment of seven prisoners
charged with killing a prison guard last July 23.
Administrative assistant Ellsworth Ferguson said the
outbreak, which caused only minor damage, was ended
by locking about 1 ,000 prisoners in their cells.
Notices posted in all wings during the disturbance
said:
"Anyone who does not support the strike is
opposed to it, that is, counter-revolutionary. Anyone
who opposes it is an enemy and will be dealt with as
such."
Proposition 18 Beaten
LOS ANGELES — Controversial Prop. 18, which
would have provided gasoline tax money to fight smog
and build public transit systems, was defeated
Wednesday by a 47 ,000-vote margin.
Two other environment-pegged ballot
measures—bond issues totaling $310 million to clean
up the water and expand recreational sites—passed with
fat majorities.
18-Year Old Vote Beaten
WASHINGTON — Ten of 15 states that considered
lowering the voting age Tuesday voted against it. And
there were opposite majority views on liquid, gambling
and religion among states that voted on special
measures.
Vietnam was on the ballot in Massachusetts and the
voters supported President Nixon's planned withdrawal
of troops.
