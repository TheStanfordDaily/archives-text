# LSJUMB To Celebrate And Scrounge For Funds
## 
### 
Tomorrow all of Stanford will have
the opportunity to celebrate that great
old institution, the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (ILSJUMB). Friday has
been officially declared "Stanford Band
Day," according to officials in charge
of that sort of thing.
The festivities will be culminated by
a FREE concert in White Plaza Friday
night from 8:00-?, sponsored by the
ASSU Special Events Board. John
Ralston and his Rose Bowl Boys will be
there. The Stanford Dollies, Sam
McGowan and a cast of thousands will
also be on hand to liven things up.
Earlier in the day, as the bells of
Hoo Tow nostalgically chime the noon
hour, lunchers will have a chance to
give to the Band of their choice. An
authentic ILSJUMB hat will be passed,
and all contributions welcomed.

Band Manager Ken Peterson is
hoping for the $8,000 to $10,000
necessary to send the band to Colorado
for the Air Force game. But Ken is also
realistic. "We'll take what we get; if we
can't afford Colorado we'll use the
money for Pasadena, and whatever's
left will go to the Band Manager's
Retirement Fund."
Although this year has been better
than most, the Band is operating on a
pretty low budget. The concert serves
dual purposes by promoting moral
support for the important Washington
game as well as a financial boost for the
Band.
In the meantime, the Band is still
pushing rare Stanford Roses at the
remarkable low price of 50 cents
apiece, each blessed by Prince
Lightfoot.
Give generously: it may even be
tax-deductible.
