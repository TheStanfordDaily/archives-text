# Justice Official To Answer Student Questions Tonight
## 
### 
Benjamin Holman, director of
community relations services for the
U.S. Department of Justice, will give a
short talk and answer questions from a
student-faculty panel at 8:30 p.m.
tonight in room 214 of History Corner.
His appearance will be sponsored by
the Stanford Law Forum. It is part of a
nation-wide program announced last
month by U.S. Attorney Gen. John
Mitchell to send representatives to
various campuses "to answer questions
about the department's policies and

programs."
According to Law Forum President
James Paul and John Grube, assistant
dean of students, Holman also will
respond to written questions from the
audience, following the format
developed for Stanford-Community
Forum '7 0 talks this fall.
On Friday, Holman will participate
in a series of private discussions with
faculty and administration leaders,
minority student groups, and student
government and publications leaders.
