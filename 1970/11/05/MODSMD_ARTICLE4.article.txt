# SWOPSI Course Probes Police Roles
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"The policeman is your friend."
"Off the pigs."
Creating "cop-lovers" is not the purpose of
SWOPSI 124, entitled "Police: A Closer Look,"
according to its instructor, Greg Morris, a three year
veteran of the Mountain View force.
"I'm not trying to b.s. anybody up here," the
28-year-old patrolman says. He hopes to apply the
fabled Stanford genius to solving police problems,
while breaking down barriers that divide police and
students.
The course is a by-product of the spring riots,
which caught Morris, a 1 970 University graduate, in
the middle. "I went to classes in the morning and
came back at night in my flak suit to stand in front of
Encina," he recalls.
Successful Encounter
The obvious police-student polarization inspired a
successful encounter group involving 8 0 students and
4 0 area cops. The class is trying to organize another
encounter session to make up for what Morris
described as police department apathy.
"We want to get together with the patrolman on
the street, not the chiefs or the community relations
officer," Morris says.
To understand the policeman's job, students began
riding in patrol cars this weekend. The Palo Alto,
Mountain View, Menlo Park and Milpitas departments
are cooperating in the program.
The SWOPSI course is not connected with any
police department, and Morris is not paid for teaching
it. "I'm in it for what I can learn," he says.
He is also inspired by fears that lack of
communication and a right-wing reaction could lead to
a police state. "The police are America's only totally
armed minority," Morris warns.
Community Support Needed
In addition, Morris craves the support of the whole
community. "Cops work for everybody," he says, but
many people don't realize that.
Many of the 108 class members share the popular
hostility towards the "pigs," but the class is informal
and friendly. "We had a good first session and that
took a lot of the strain off," Morris says. The class

includes a dozen graduate students and a post-doctoral
fellow. There are, however, no blacks and few
chicanos.
Students are there because they sense that police
power is a critical issue. "With all the violence around
it's important," Marc Allyn says.
Pat Miller, another student, became interested in
the issue when she worked in the records department
of the Salt Lake County sheriff's department. "I saw a
lot of things 1 felt needed to be changed," she says.
Groups Sharpen Focus
She is working in a study group on police training
and recruitment. Other groups (there are eight of
them) focus on police vs courts, community relations,
and the role of the police.
If the research groups come up with concrete
proposals, Morris hopes to tap a $30 million Ford
Foundation fund for innovation in law enforcement.
Left to police chiefs and retired FBI men, the money
may go to "buy new fingerpaint brushes," Morris
fears. He hopes the students' minds are less "ossified."
Students are encouraged to take the initiative in the
class. Lanny Woo has been visiting local police
departments to chat with the officers. "I've had a
really good response," he says. "You get what you put
into the class."
The policeman has no present plans for how the
class will work. "My tactics just sort of happen," he
says. Wednesday night talks by local police chiefs, a
public defender and a district attorney are scheduled,
as well as visits to local prisons: Vacaville, San Quentin
and Folsom.
Judge Sidney Feinberg, Palo Alto municipal court
judge, spoke to the course last night.
A week ago, University of Santa Clara law professor
Howard C. Anawalt presented some interesting
observations on the police mentality to the class. For
instance, Anawalt said, "The officer isn't responsible
for what he's enforcing. Cops don't make the laws, it
is merely their job to enforce them."
He saw a cop's attitudes toward the First
Amendment, free speech, and government power
confrontations as essentially simple ones.
Simplistic Understanding
"The First Amendment is to allow people to raise
hell without getting themselves put in jail, to express

discontent with muscle behind it," said the professor.
"A cop can't really understand the meaning of those
political tools ... all the intricacies of law involving
the First Amendment."
"Most often his idea of justice is like that of Spiro
Agnew ... to keep things status quo. A cop gets the
idea that order is the thing to be achieved," he said.
Morris admits that "it is fashionable to hate the
pig," but some of his students are developing empathy
for the police.
"It's funny, but I've started to put myself in the
cop's shoes," Christine Gray says.
Power Abuse Questioned
Still, the class repeatedly brought up police abuse
of power in questions to Anawalt. Anawalt said a
policeman is partially responsible for the use of
violence as the American example of justice.
"A policeman should be on a one-to-one basis with
the man on the street," Anawalt said. "He should be
under identical pressure not to use violence."
"The police aren't as accountable for their actions
as they should be," he concluded.
"I don't want people to think that because I'm a
nice guy, all cops are nice guys," Morris insists, yet he
adds, "You've got to have somebody around to
enforce the law."
Not A Career Cop
Actually, Morris, a creative writing major here, is
not a career cop. The job pays his law school tuition at
University of Santa Clara. Politics and law attract him.
"1 want to change things, but I'm very integrated
within the system," Morris says.
The course will be offered winter quarter, but not
in spring, since Morris has his law exams then. He may
come to the campus in the spring to recruit police
officers.
The success of the course can not be judged yet,
but Morris has overcome his first obstacles. Students
agree that the cop-teacher is objective and honest.
They seem to like him a lot.
"He's not pushing anything at all," Pat Miller says.
"He wants people to get together, not to be separated
by roles.
"I don't know if that's possible."

IN THE MIDDLE—Gr«?g Morris, a Stanford graduate, speaks to the SWOPSI
course "Police: A Closer Look" as both police officer and student. Last spring, he
found himself with students in Law classes at the University of Santa Clara during
the day and against students as an officer during the nighttime disruptions.
