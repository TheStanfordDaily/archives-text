# More Housing From Where?
## 
### 
The shortage of low and moderate
income housing in the Mid-Peninsula
and throughout the nation will not be
solved until the federal government
assumes the responsibility to provide
for the needs of all its people, or is
forced to do so.
Faced with a worsening housing
crisis the Nixon Administration has so
far not only managed to ignore the
problem, but has actually severely cut
back funds to the Housing and Urban
Development department.
The many obstacles to the solution
of the housing shortage tall behind the
one central problem, the lack of
money. Low and moderate income
housing is not being built because
given present governmental priorities
there has simply not been enough
money to finance its construction.
The problem seems always to come
down to the high cost of land and
housing construction, or Ihe lack of
federal subsidies. At Stanford for
example, according to Associate
Provost Robert Rosensweig, "Because
of the financial questions involved, it
is not likely that we will build more

(low/moderate income housing) at
any time soon/*
Although any amount of housing
construction on university lands will
be insignificant in respect to the total
problem, we feel the University is
obligated to make a commitment at
least as large as the Wright committee
recommendation of 600 units. So far
only 200 units arc planned.
Meanwhile even though there
hasn't been money to build low and
moderate income housing in Palo
Alto, the State Highway Department
has had no trouble finding financial
support for its Willow Expressway
plan which would destroy units
of housing in the area.
Stanford and Palo Alto continue to
develop their land profitably for
industry and office buildings while
almost completely ignoring the
increased housing demands these
policies will create.
The local, county and state
governments have been totally
unwilling and often unable to accept
responsibility for the problem. Private

agencies, while occasionally trying to
alleviate the pressure, have not been in
a position to be able to significantly
affect the situation.
The responsibility is consistent!)
passed up tlie line, ending with the
federal government where it is being
ignored. The result is obvious in the
Mid-Peninsula—a severe shortage of
housing for those of low and
moderate incomes. Still the
government seems completely
unwilling to face this social problem
until forced to do so.
We applaud the efforts of the Palo
Alto Tenants" Union to organize the
local community. Apparently their
activities this summer have already
had some effect on the housing
policies of the Palo Alto City Council.
Unfortunately the Tenants' Union
has since then apparently decided that
working through the governmental
structure is counter-productive. The
problem arises, however, that without
governmental subsidies low/moderate
income housing will not get built.
