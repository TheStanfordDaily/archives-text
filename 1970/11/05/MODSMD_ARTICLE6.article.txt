## Freedom And Unfreedom 
### 
"Men are free when they are in a
living homeland, not when they
are straying and breaking away.
Men are free when they are
obeying some deep, inward voice
of religious belief... Not when
they are escaping to some wild
west. The most unfree souls go
west, and shout of freedom. Men
are freest when they are most
unconscious of freedom. The

shout is a rattling of chains,
always was."
—D.H. Lawrence
"Give me Liberty or give me
death!" "Freedom Now!" "Up
from under!" "Off the Pigs!"
"Don't hassle me!"
Americans don't like being told
what to do. We view with
distrustful frigidity any agency
which wields a power over our
lives. We like to see man changing
and hopefully improving his
sit ation, so we like large
aggregations of power; but we are
at once terribly suspicious that
this power will be used, either
directly or indirectly, to restrict
our freedom.
We have always been jealous of
our liberty. Words like "freedom"
and "tyranny" have become
national symbols evoking a
Pavlovian response. The pursuit of
autonomy for the individual has
been the essence of our national
experience.
Freedom has taken on almost
magical powers in our view, and
we hae passed that opinion on to
the rest of the world. We see it as
the essential quality for civilized
man. Without it, we can not live.
With it, we can not fail.
Today's "liberation"
movement is a clear expression of
just this view. The minorities of
the world—blacks, browns,
yellows, reds, women, workers,
and others—tend to place great
hopes in an impending liberation
from "oppression" by established
powers. They see freedom from
restrictions and subordination in
the same supernatural terms as so
many American's before them;
without it they can't live, with it
they can't fail.
State Of Mind
I do not here mean to
comment on the justice of any
group's practical goals, and am as
much opposed to arbitrary and
irrational discrimination as
anyone. However, I do mean very
strongly to condemn the state of
mind which has so far been the
center of discussion; a
preoccupation with the abstract
ideal of "freedom from" as the
one essential quality for successful
human life. For this liberation
mentality, which has been so
typically American, considers
only part of the problem of

don ayer

human discontent. Moreover, it is
the surest way to unfreedom.
The first factor which the
liberationist approach neglects is
that liberation is the state of mind
of feeling liberated, the feeling
that one's thoughts and behavior
are not constrained. There are
obviously many things which no
man can do, from sheer physical
inability if for no other reason.
Yet his unfreedom does not derive
alone from these incapacities. To
be truly unfree, he must possess
the desire to do what is denied
him. He must be discontented
with the limitations on his
situation.
The liberation mentality
provides this discontent by
defining restriction as evil, and the
autonomous capacity to take
action as good. By its maudlin
focus on the areas of
confinement, it feeds and
magnifies the dissatisfactions
inherent in human life. In this
sense, it is its own worst enemy.
Problem of Purpose
Further, it totally ignores the
more profound problem of
purpose; to be in the fanciful state
of perfect liberty is to be no
closer to understanding what one
is to do or why. It is like the
painter who has covered his
palette with every color
imaginable, and then finds himself
with nothing to say. The
unlimited selection of colors, like
the complete freedom of the
"successful" libertarian, presents a
problem of overchoice which
makes his lack of direction even
more acute.
To abstractly call for
liberation, moreover, is to
advocate a one-shot formula for
the problems of modern society.
The issue is not whether some
groups are treated badly; that is
conceded. It is rather that
liberation, as an end in itself, fails
to confront the vacancy which
many people feel in their lives;
and that preoccupation with it has
the ironic effect of making people
more unfree than ever. "Men are
freest when they are most
unconscious of freedom. The
shout is a rattling of chains,
always was."
