Editor, THE DAILY:
I was a full-time Stanford
employee until I was fired
unfairly and without due reason.
I'm Judy King and I drove the
catering truck for students, staff
and faculty run by Tresidder
Union.
I was told Tuesday, October 2 7
that I had until Nov. 6 th (a not
really two week trial) to increase
sales or be fired. I felt this was a
poor excuse and that the matter
was more of a personal nature,
but I still tried my best to bring

up sales. Because of the
underlying personal nature of the
problem (things like the way 1
dress and look) and a desire to
show client loyalty a friend and 1
drew up a two line petition saying
the undersigned felt I was doing
an efficient and effective job.
With over 200 signatures by
Friday October 30, I put the
petition in a sealed and addressed
envelope on my boss' desk. Since
my boss was not in it seems that
the higher ups got ahold of the
petition.

I was phoned Saturday
morning and fired. The direct
impetus for my firing seems to
have come from the petition
which those in charge viewed as a
hostile and dangerous act. The
sales reason couldn't have held
because 1 did bring up sales during
the rest of the week (I didn't even
get to finish the two week trial)
thanks in part to people who
bought more stuff feeling it would
help me keep my job.
What 1 would like questioned is
the arbitrary and dishonest nature
of Tresidder's actions against
myself.
