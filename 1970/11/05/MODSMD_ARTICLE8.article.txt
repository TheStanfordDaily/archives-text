## 'bridge the gap' Interdepartmental Assembly 
###

There were several efforts
made last year during the strike to
organize some kind of
interdepartmental organization.
On one occasion, 26 departments
sent representatives to a meeting
convened specifically for this
purpose. Unfortunately, the
meetings produced neither
decisive nor definitive proposals.
There were several stumbling
blocks: (1) What powers would
such an organization have vis-a-vis
the present political systems on
campus (Faculty and Student
Senates)? (2) How would the
representation to such an
assembly be determined? (3)
Would departmental
representatives be empowered to
make decisions for their
departments, or would they
simply voice the individual
department's opinions? (4) How
would undeclared majors and
freshmen be fitted into such a
scheme? The representatives did
agree on one point unanimously;
ie. , that the departmental
meetings had produced opinions,
and ultimately decisions and
actions in more representative a
fashion than any other system on
the campus.
As I stated in the previous
article, I believe that the
departments, insofar as they
represent the power base of the
university community, should be
used as the foundation of a new
organization on campus. I would
like to make specific suggestions
regarding the functions of such a
system.
A. Power of the IDA: The
departments would submit
proposals to the Faculty and
Student Senates dealing with
policies towards violence,
important curricular matters and
student relations with the
administration.
B. Representation: The

individual departments would
hold a general meeting of faculty,
graduate and undergraduate
students where representatives
would be elected from each of the
latter categories on a one-man,
one-vote basis. Representation in
the Assembly would be
proportional, with the larger
departments (such as History and
Psychology) having more
representatives than the smaller
departments (such as Classics).
C. Steering committee: The
elected representatives would then
in turn elect or appoint a steering
committee whose function would
be to submit an agenda to the
individual departments which
would be discussed at monthly
departmental meetings. More
important, the steering committee
would coordinate, quickly and
efficiently, the power of the
individual departments in times of
crisis.
D. Role of representatives: The
departmental representatives in
the Assembly would simply voice
the majority decision of their
respective departments in the IDA
meetings.
No Time to Lose
So much for the proposals and
hypotheses. If the consensus is
that there is no need for an
interdepartmental assembly, then
so be it. If, on the other hand,
there is a general willingness to
give it a try, there is no time to
lose, for the value of such an
organization would be most felt in
times of a crisis on campus, which
could be any time.
If we are going to have such an
organization this year, the next
two weeks must produce the
following:
1. Approval from the
administration
2. Approval from the
department chairmen
3. Arbitrary appointment of an

ad hoc committee by the
department chairmen to establish
definite guidelines for the IDA
and to provide a means of
representation for the undeclared
majors and freshmen. Otherwise
the IDA will suffer the same fate
as PACC and SCHAG.
There was a time last year
when the majority expressed itself
and did effectively decide the
course of events on campus. I am
of course referring to the
Cambodian strike, and the
phenomenon of departmental
meetings which was instrumental
in the subsequent effectiveness of
the strike.
As meetings of faculty and
students together were being held
in department after department,
as the votes taken by the
individual departments became
known, but more important, as
the departments worked in
conjunction in an attempt to
produce effective action, one
could really feel, for the first
time, that the "majority" was
directing things, that the real
power base in the university was
finally utilizing its long-neglected
potential.
The strike last year
"happened" because the majority
voted for it, not because the
minority demanded it; and it was,
to an extent, successful, because
the majority wanted it to be such,
not because the minority had
forced the university into a
dead-end street.
