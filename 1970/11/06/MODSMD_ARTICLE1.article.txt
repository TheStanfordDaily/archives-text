# Words Win Rhodes National Fame
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Silence has
not made Joseph Rhodes what he is. A
product of Pittsburgh, of the California
Institute of Technology, of Harvard,
and of John Ehrlichman, Joseph
Rhodes, Jr., is most of all a product of
words—Spiro Agnew's, and his own.
Although he first attained
recognition as Caltech student body
president, and gained national
prominence as the only student
member of Nixon's Commission on
Campus Unrest (recommended to the
post by Presidential adviser John
Ehrlichman), it was his initial remarks
about the Commission and the Vice
President's angry response which
catapulted him into national headlines.
His words have kept him there ever
since.
In a small cafe on Harvard Square
last Monday, the most-quoted student
in the nation gathered himself together
and levelled his guns at targets on all
sides of him- Nixon and Agnew,
ultra-conservatives and campus
revolutionaries.
"There are butchers on the right and
butchers on the left," Rhodes said,
with uncanny force and vehemence in
his voice. "If you kill innocent people,
you're a butcher. There is no excuse.for
butchers."
Nicknamed 'Old Life-and-Death' by
fellow members of the Scranton

Commission, Rhodes' preoccupation
with the sanctity of human life seeps
into every statement that he makes.
Human Life
"My sole criterion (on the
Commission) was human life," he
declared.
"I joined the Commission because a
friend told me 'You may save some
lives in the fall," said Rhodes, a Junior
Fellow at Harvard. He added that he
thought the Commission's report "had
saved a few lives.
"I thought a lot of people would
ignore it, and a lot would hail it as
honest and judicious.
"It was my responsibility to keep in
the Commissioners' minds the fact that
we weren't talking about games or
strategems, we were talking about
lives," he added.
The son of a black Pittsburgh
steelworker and a half-Chinese,
half-Filipino mother, Rhodes, at 22,
was the youngest member of the
Scranton Commission-and has proved
the most outspoken. His attacks on
Agnew and Nixon have continued
almost unabated since he first aroused
Agnew's ire by stating that he expected
the commission to investigate and see
whether the six student deaths of the
Spring could be linked to
Administration criticism of students.
Last Monday was no exception. On
his way to the cafe, as he talked about

Carlisle's love letters and the football
game he had just played, Rhodes made
a detour to the newsstands to see if his
latest barb- this one labelling the Ohio
State Grand Jury a "kangaroo
court"- had made the evening papers.
He bought a Boston Evening Globe
from the irascrible salesman ("If ya
gonna read it, buy it!"), walked into
the cafe, and ordered a Budweiser.
Then he settled back to talk.
Attack on Campaign Tactics
"I don't think a lot of people are
buying this campaign," he remarked.
"Working people are waking up to the
fact that the President is creating more
misery. He seems to prefer campaigning
to governing . . . he'd rather run" (than
take up the duties of his office).
"A lot of people are fed up with
tactical division and hate," he
continued. "I think we have to stop
assuming that the American people are
a vicious bunch. The politics of fear
will not pay off.
"After this campaign, I have lost all
faith in the President's integrity," he
concluded.
A question was interspersed—"What
about the Vice President's?"
"I never had any faith in the Vice
President's," Rhodes responded
quickly. "I used to think he was a joke.
Now he's a bad joke at best, and a
tragedy at worst.
"They (Nixon and Agnew) are both
opportunists of the worst kind," he
added.
But Rhodes did not confine his
attacks to high Administration officials.
His intensity and concentration
increased when the subject shifted from
Presidents to violent campus
revolutionaries.
"People who advocate violence can
do violence to themselves, if they like.
The willingness to die for your beliefs is
an honorable willingness.
'Don't Shame Your Commitment'
"But don't shame your commitment
to die with a commitment to kill," he
added, strong, almost rhetorical tones
coming into his voice.

"You can't terrorize people into
being more humane," he said.
Rhodes also called violent
revolutionaries "cackling fools," and
said "in bombers there is a certain
romantic racism." He charged that
"Bombers don't think of the
consequences of their actions for black
people." They are not there when the
police come knocking on doors in the
ghetto, trying to find who set their
bomb, he said.
"This country is not yet a police
state," he added. "It's been moving in
that direction, but not as rapidly as
some say.
"Students ought to wake up. They
don't suffer that much. Things in the
past have been terrible, and people have
had the courage to endure.
"Black students ought to realize
how fortunate they are. We've suffered
so little and we act as if we've suffered
so much," he continued.
'Future of Man'
"We're fighting for the future of
man on this planet. We have to sustain
each other." Rhodes went on to
describe the action of the Kent State
students after the Ohio Grand Jury had
handed down 2 5 indictments of young
people and professors. The jury
exonerated the National Guard for the
shootings last May 4 .
He explained that they had agreed
not to respond to this action with
violence, but to pull together and show
their feelings as a group, nonviolently.
"We should take our cue from the
Kent State students, and not be so
snobbish," he said.
"We will win in time. We're talking
about shifting a culture. It'll take a
generation." Increasing fervor crept
into his voice. "It's not a bad
payment-to hold on and believe."
Not all of Rhodes's words have gone
unheeded or unanswered. His first
well-publicized remark prompted
Agnew to call for his resignation from
the Commission. Now, a charge that
Mississippi is "a police state ruled by
terror," has come back to him with a

vengence. Three Mississippi policemen
have charged him with libel and
slander, and are suing him for $3
million.
No Path 'Most Effective'
When asked what he viewed as the
most effective path of action, Rhodes
responded, '"There's no such thing as
the 'most effective' path. I try to meet
my responsibilities with as much
humanity as I can.

"There's no guarantee we can make
it,"he continued. "There's a guarantee
we can try. The situation is worthy of
great risks."
Rhodes drew himself forward. His
hands almost trembled, and his face
took on the aspect of a revivalist
preacher. "I'm in this for the
duration," he said. "I will work with
whatever tools I can get my hands on.
"It's worth staying with it."
