# Recycling To Continue At Washington Game
## 
### 
The recycling project is
catching on at Stanford football
games.
While the Cards cleaned
Oregon off the field last Saturday,
enthusiastic rooters cleaned the
stands of 98 percent of all cans
brought or sold at the game!
This weekend anti-pollution
efforts will be re-doubled at the
Washington game which will reach
ten million people over network
television. TV cameras will be
making a special effort to follow
the progress of this stadium-wide
campaign by highlighting
volunteer activities.
Workers carrying gunny sacks
and wearing T-shirts and armbands
with the familiar recycle symbol
will be collecting cans in each aisle
during the game. Card stunts,
general PA announcements,

"ecology" cheers, posters and
banners will assure that football
fans will know of the project.
The success of similar efforts in
the past have raised the hopes of
SCG and Ecology Action
members, who organize the
projects. These people have been
joined by volunteers from A Phi
O, ZPG, and surrounding
communities.
The success of these efforts
goes beyond the value of scrap
metal collected. Last week 1.7
tons of bi-metal cans and 150
pounds of aluminum were
collected The actual value of
these 3 2,0 0 0 cans was a mere $32;
football game recycling is
profitable only in terms of
reaching people with the message
that "Something can be done
about pollutionâ€”now!"
