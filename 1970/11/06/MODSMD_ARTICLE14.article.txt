# Spaced-Out Odyssey To Show Here
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Marlon Brando's finest effort,
"ON THE WATERFRONT" will
be shown this evening at 7 :30 and
9:30 in Cubberley. Directed by
Elia Kazan ("A STREETCAR
NAMED DESIRE," "VIVA
ZAPATA," "EAST OF EDEN,"
"SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS,"
"THE ARRANGEMENT") and
starring, in addition to Brando,
Rod Steiger, Eva Marie Saint, and
Carl Maulden, "ON THE
WATERFRONT" could possibly
be one of the best American films
ever made.
Orson Welles' versios of
"OTHELLO" will be presented
tonight at 7 , 8 and 9 in Tresidder
Union. Orson summed it up when
he said, "My 'OTHELLO' is more
successful in the theatre than on
film."
"LION IN WINTER," or more
aptly, "WHO'S AFRAID OF
QUEEN ELEANOR?" will also be
shown this evening at 7 and 9 :30
in Memorial Auditorium. James
Goldman's story concerns
twenty-four hours in the life of
King Henry II (Peter O'Toole) and
Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine
(Ktherine, The Great, Hepburn)
who has spent the last ten years of
her life imprisoned in her
husband's castle thinking of clever
things to say to him upon her
release.

The entire royal family gathers
at the Castle of Chinon on
Christmas Day to engage in a
game of one upmanship. Eleanor
puts in her bid for Prince Richard
(Anthony Hopkins) for king while
Henry wants to crown nitwit Price
John (Nigel Terry) and Prince
Geoffrey (John Castle) is left to
scheme on his own. Henry's
mistress, Princess Alais (Jane
Marrow) and her brother
(Timothy Dalton) also partake of
the fun and games.
The only thing that saves the
film from becoming nothing more
than an epic situation comedy is
the performance of Katherine
Hepburn. It takes a great actress
to look at a camera and say '"What
family doesn't have its ups and
downs?" and keep a straight face.
The first film written and
directed by Jean Cocteau,
"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" is
scheduled to be shown Saturday
evening in Tresidder Union at 7 ,
8 , and 9.
"2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY,"
written by Arthur C. Clark and
directed by Stanley ("LOLITA,"
"DR. STRANGELOVE") Kubrick
can be experienced Saturday at
7:30 and 10:15 in Memorial
Auditorium. "2001 " took about
three years to make—six months
of preparation, four and a half

months of working with the
actors, and a year and a half of
shooting special effects costing
MGM Studios $10,500,000.
Kubrick's explanation of the
plot: "You begin with an artifact
left on earth four million years
ago by extraterrestrial explorers
who observed the behavior of the
man-apes of the time and decided
to influence their evolutionary
progression. Then you have a
second artifact buried on the
lunar surface and programmed to
signal word of man's first baby
steps into the universe—a kind of
cosmic burglar alarm. And finally
there's a third artifact placed in
orbit around Jupiter and waiting
for the time when man has
reached the outer rim of his own
solar system.
"When the surviving astronaut,
Bowman, ultimately reaches
Jupiter, this artifact sweeps him
into a force field or star gate that
hurls him on a journey through
inner and outer space and finally
transports him to another part of
the galaxy, where he's placed in a
human zoo approximating a
hospital terrestrial environment
drawn out of his own dreams and
imagination. In a timeless state,
his life passes from middle age to
senescence to death. He is reborn,
an enhanced being, a star child, an
angel, a superman, if you like, and
returns to earth prepared for the

next leap forward of man's
evolutionary destiny . . .
"The film becomes anything
the viewer sees in it. If the film
stirs the emotions and penetrates
the subconscious of the viewer, if
it stimulates, however inchoately,
his mythological and religious
yearnings and impulses, then it
has succeeded ... 1 didn't even
have to try for ambiguity; it was
inevitable."
If you've already seen "2001 "
ten times or if you're interested in

seeing a truly excellent film,
"SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN
ANCESTORS" will be shown
Saturday at 7 :30 and 9:30 in
Cubberley. This highly acclaimed
1967 Russian film can be
described as a mystical and
emotional experience and is
definitely worth seeing.
James Coburn will appear in
"OUR MAN FLINT," his first spy
spoof as the ingenious, intrepid,
insatiable Derek Flint, at the
Sunday Flicks, 7 :30 in Memorial
Auditorium.
