# The 						Real Will Rogers, U.S.A.
## 
### NEIL ARNET 
This Monday "Will Rogers'
U.5.A.," a one-man show starring
James Whitmore, opened for a
two-week engagement at the
Marines' Memorial Theatre in San
Francisco. By its very nature a
one-man show is difficult to bring
off. Yet James Whitmore not only
has brought the play off, but also
has made it a smashing success.
Mr. Whitmore begins the play
by coming onstage as himself and
reading a short passage from the
encyclopedia about Will Rogers.
Then, having explained that the
encyclopedia description
obviously isn't enough, he takes
off his coat and tie, pulls round
his neckerchief, places a cowboy
hat upon the back of his head,
and for the rest of the evening
becomes Will Rogers. And become
him he does. James Whitmore,
chewing gum, twirling a lariat, and
walking with "a bit of a slouch,"
was so good that I had the feeling
1 was watching the real Will
Rogers.
One of the many fine aspects
of the play is that Paul Shyre
adapted the play entirely from
Will Rogers' own words. The play
is done as if it were one of Rogers'
"lectures" in which he comes out
with no plan in mind and simply
begins with "I was born" and
proceeds from there.
He talks about the fact that
he's a Cherokee Indian and about

how all the treaties with the
Indians gave them land for as long
as there was "grass growing and
water flowing." Then there are
Rogers' schemes to stop war and
traffic problems, the description
of his tour of Europe in which he
met Mussolini, the Prince of
Wales, and George Bernard Shaw,
and, of course, his comments on
politicians.
I guess I hadn't realized how
funny Will Rogers was. Watching
James Whitmore's brilliant
re-creation of Will Rogers was
better than seeing a two hour
stand-up comedy act. And the
timing was uncanny. Obviously
Paul Shyre, who directed as well
as adapted this show, worked
closely with James Whitmore to
achieve the perfection of
head-scratching, pauses, laughter,
and the whole characterization of
Will Rogers.
But the play was still all
Whitmore's. His talent makes the
play, not Shyre's direction as
brilliant as it is. James Whitmore
enjoys himself on the stage, and
he's thoroughly relaxed.
Whitmore brings home the dry wit
and warm manner of Rogers.
There are moments of seriousness
too, such as when he tells about
his horse that died after having
been with him for nineteen years.
War and religion are also
serious topics, and Rogers'
comments ring surprisingly true

for 1970 Americans. Indeed, the
underlying success of the play,
after the acting of James
Whitmore, probably rests with the
fact that Will Rogers speaks to us
now with the same wisdom that
people were hearing until his
tragic death in 1935. It was in
August of that year that he and
his friend, Wylie Post, crashed
into the water while in flight to
Alaska.
Fortunately, in the theatrical
sense James Whitmore has
brought Will Rogers back to life.
His comments on Ziegfield and
W.C. Fields add to his vitality.
And his remarks about Calvin
Coolidge, from his dinner with the
President to his imitation of
Coolidge reading a speech to a
joint session of Congress, prove
priceless. The reading of the
Coolidge speech is one of the best
single pieces of theatre artistry
that I've seen. It's an extra bonus
for the audience.
One parting thought for those
theatre-goers who are students
like myself, or for anyone else
who didn't have the opportunity
to see Will Rogers while alive, this
play offers the chance to get the
feel for the warmth, wit, and
satire of a great humorist; Rogers'
words have as much meaning,
perhaps more, as they did when
he used them himself.
"Will Rogers' U.S.A." closes
November 14; so I suggest you
buy your tickets soon.
