# The 						Smell Of Huskies, Roses
## National Audience Will Turn On, Too 
### FRED LEESON 
Somebody took a piece of
chalk broadside and wrote
"Huskies" boldly on the
chalkboard in the stadium
clubhouse last week after
Stanford had downed Oregon
State 4 8-10.
Below was drawn a plant-like
image which—with a little
imagination—looked like a rose.
That's the situation at the
stadium tomorrow at 1 :2 0 p.m.: a
win or tie for Stanford would
assure the Indians the conference
championship and the Rose Bowl,
which they haven't seen in 19
years.
"We're playing for a
conference championship," Coach
John Ralston told his players.
"That's all we're thinking about.
From now on think nothing but
Washington, Washington."
And when you think of
Washington you think of Sonny
Sixkiller, the sophomore
quarterback leading the nation in
pass completions who went to
Seattle as a nobody who had been
passed over by scouts from
Oregon, where he had lived most
of his life.
Full Load
"We look at Wishington as a
good, solid team," Ralston said
Wednesday. "We're going to have
our hands full."
The Huskies bring a 4 -3 total
and a 2-2 Pac-8 record before a
national television audience and
an expected 7 0 ,000 tomorrow.
They also bring in the league's
leading pass defense which has
given up an average of 166 yards
per game in the air- which could
be an ominous sign for Stanford's
air-minded offense.
In seven games, Sixkiller has
thrown 252 passes, and completed
133 for 1612 yards and nine

touchdowns. His completion
percentage is .5 28.
Jim Plunkett has thrown two
less passes, completed one less,
has the same percentage and has
1 985 yards and 12 touchdowns in
eight games.
Don't be surprised if you see a
few passes thrown tomorrow.
The damp weather could be a
factor in the outcome, but it is
difficult to assess. Both teams pass
a lot; Stanford has better balance
and runs more. Does a wet field
hurt the pass or the run more?
Figure it for yourself.
The Indians, favored by the
oddsmakers to win by 17, should
be back at full strength. Demea
Washington, flanker; Jeff Siemon,
linebacker; and Steve Jubb,
tackle; didn't run at full "strength
in practice during the week but all
three will probably be ready for
some play, at least.
Good Practice
As for the workouts in the rain
and out of the rain, Ralston said
some were among the best of the
season.
Don't pay much attention to
the 17 point odds. Coach Jim
Owens brings in his most
explosive Washington team in a
number of years and last week the
Huskies fooled the oddsmakers
and upset Oregon 25-23 in
Seattle.
Top dogs for the
Huskies—aside from quarterback
Sixkiller are split end Jim Krieg
who, with 4 0 receptions, is the
Pac-B's number two receiver; and
Bo Cornell, a 6-1, 217 pound
running back who is fourth in
league scoring with seven
touchdowns and 4 2 points.
Another dangerous runner is
defensive back Cal Jones who runs
back punts for the Huskies and is
second best in the league at doing
it, behind Stanford's Eric Cross.

Providing that water doesn't
turn the game into some sort of
freak thing, it should be an
excellent game.
There will be two good
offenses facing two good defenses;
there's a Rose Bowl thrown in for
added joy should Stanford win.
And it's also the final home
game for quarterback Plunkett,
who would be delighted to close
out his fabled career at Stanford
Stadium by snatching a
conference title and Pasadena trip.

HEAVY- An Oregon State ball carrier, perhaps Dave Schilling, finds a pile of Stanford defenders,
including Tom Sones (8 3) and four others who aren't clearly identifiable. The Stanford defense will get
another rough test they've stood up to quite a few already- against Sonny Sixkiller and the rest of the
Huskies.

THE END: Stanford co-captains
Jim Plunkett (16) and Jack
Schultz (4 4) stand with officials
last week after the toss of the
coin. The two seniors will handle
that chore for the last time in
Stanford Stadium tomorrow at
1:2 0 p.m. Game time has been
moved ten minutes earlier because
ihe game will be telecast
nationally on ABC. Originally it
was to be a regional showing but
the Indians and Huskies upstaged
USC and Notre Dame.
