# The 						Playpen
## Now And Then 
### Fred Leeson 
It has been 1 9 years since Stanford has been so deeply involved in a
Rose Bowl race.
Nineteen years is probably beyond the conception (heh) of the
youngest students around here and it is probably beyond the memory
of the older ones, too.
But don't look back with condescension at autumn quarter, 1 952.
"Marijuana Patch Found On University Property "—a $6,000 plot
adjacent to the golf course. San Mateo Sheriff Earl VVhitmore said he
was "bent on wiping out the marijuana problem that has grown so
large in the past few years."
According to the same report, there was "some indication that the
sale of narcotics was being directed towards students along the
peninsula."
Violence was a major issue, too. Within three weeks, the initials
"SJS," "C" and "UCLA" were burned into the stadium turf. And
four lawless hooligans later set fire to wood that had been collected
for the Big Game bonfire.
Lease On Life
That was the year Varian Associates took a 9 9-year lease on 10
acres of land near Page Mill and El Camino to build an electronics
plant .. . "part of Stanford's long-range program to develop its
outlying properties in accord with the interests of the Palo Alto area,"
the reporter said.
Other headlines told the Red advances, and possibilities of a
ceasefire, and maybe even peace. In Korea.
Warren G. Wonka broke his leg in an automobile accident coming
back from a football game in Seattle, and made it into a United Press
wire story.
A 27-year-old Yurok Indian named Timm Williams wrote a letter
to the ASSU and volunteered to dress in a hand-made ceremonial
outfit and dance as Prince Lightfoot.
If You Find One
Stanford students could see home games free, except for Big Game
which cost $1.80. And they could watch a televised game against
Oregon . . ."if they can get to a television."
Sports news made the front page of the Daily three days out of
five, mingling with play reviews, and news of rallies and floats. There
was an eight-page sport section the day before the Big Game, which
became Stanford's only regular season loss, 2 0-7 .
Each week Stanfordians read about their "undefeated grid
team"--"hale and hearty" after the week's practice—ready "to lock
horns" with the next foe in the "big brown bowl."
A player never came from somewhere: he "hailed." He didn't just
look good: he "impressed."
But there were critics, too, even while Chuck Taylor's "know-how"
boys toppled one favorite after another. The Stanford Alumni Review
magazine slammed the Pacific Coast Conference for its
"semi-professional practices."
The Psychological
About the only thing one doesn't find in those days was the
preoccupation with the mental. Flash back to the present:
"Football is such a damn psychological game," said tackle Bill
Alexander last week after playing Oregon State.
"I hope we start a little faster next week. It's kind of hard to just
keep going and going, week after week. But I think we'll be up."
Many would find it enjoyable to see a Stanford team just keep
going and going. It has been awhile since one did it before.
