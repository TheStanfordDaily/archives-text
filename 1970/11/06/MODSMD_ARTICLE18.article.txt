## Cards vs. SC 
### HALL DAILY 
Tomorrow morning at 1U a.m.,
Stanford's water poloists play a
"must game" with second-place
USC.- Stanford lost to SC earlier
this season 6-5 at SC with four of
those six goals coming on penalty
shots.
With a 1-3 league record,
Stanford has to win against the
Trojans this weekend and against
Cal in two weeks to capture an
NCAA play-off berth. USC must
drop their contests with both Cal
and Stanford if the farm is to have
a chance at the NCAA's.
The Trojans already have
conference victories over both
northern teams. So, an SC win
here Saturday or any Trojan
triumph combined with a
Stanford defeat would assure
Troy of sole possession of second
place.
If the Indians fail to tie SC for
second in the conference, all
hopes for an NCAA invitation are
dashed.
Coach Jim Gaughran is hopeful
about the Cardinal poloists'
chances.
"We should've won down

south, but we have to win this
one. 1 think we have a good
chance," Gaughran said.
Leading the enthused Indians
will be goalie Peter Gadd who
allowed only two field shots to
score at SC.
On offense, sturdy Rick
Massimino will be a key figure.
But Coach Gaughran plans on
using all his starters to full
advantage.
"Our offensive scoring power is
based on Massimino and Mike
Davis. Without them, we're
weakened. Now we're working on
having other players pick up some
of the scoring load," Gaughran
commented.
Massimino leads the club in
scoring with 4 0 goals and a
phenomenal .563 scoring
percentage. Rick says many of his
goals come on penalty shots
which is the result of a team
effort.
Still Simpkins has 27 goals
with a .5 0 0 shooting clip. Davis
has pumped in 25 tallies at a .4 03
average. Rob Woolley is fourth in
team scoring with 16 scores and a
.4 33 scoring percentage.


TIMEOUT -Leading scorer Rick Massimino (23) and sophomore Dan
Powlison (2 9) take a break during a recent game. Both will return to
action tomorrow against USC.
