# Cross Country Team Runs Against Cal
## 
### 
Stanford's undefeated cross
country team takes a fling against
the weather and California
tomorrow morning somewhere
near Berkeley.
"Right now we're uncertain as
to where we will run," Coach
Marshall Clark said during the
week. Depending on the amount
of rain, the Tribe and Bears may
run at Layfaette Reservoir instead
of Cal's usiial course which
consists of hilly and probably
muddy fire trails.
A final decision was to be
determined this morning.
The Bears shouldn't give
Stanford, now 3-0 and winner of
an invitational meet, much
trouble.
"They've got one good runner
in Cliff West," Clark says.
"They've done well with what
they have, but they don't have as
much talent as some schools."
"The weather worries us more
than anything else. We don't need

any injuries right now."
Arvid Kretz, Don Kardong,
Robert Coe and Duncan
Macdonald are the Indians' big
four, with Bernie Lahde, Rich
Geisler and Brian Mittelstaedt
vying for the fifth spot.
And with the improvement of
a fifth man, the Tribe maintains
hopes, of sorts, of bumping off
Oregon for the league title Nov.
14 at Washington State.
In a northern division meet last
week, Oregon beat WSU 35-43.
Last year the Ducks won it with
17.
"That's encouraging to us,"
Clary says. "We like to think that
if everything goes right we have a
chance against them."
And though Oregon has
defending league champ Steve
Prefontaine back this yearâ€”he's
only a sophomore- the Ducks'
team strength might not be so
solid.

Clark figures this year
Prefontaine will win again and
that everybody else will stay back,
run his race without trying to
catch the Oregon flash, and make
it a tougher team contest.
Clark says a number of coaches
were interested in making

Stanford where the first league
race was run last year permanent
site of the affair. But Washington
State has it for one year, anyway,
and it's expensive for the northern
schools to have to come here
every time.
