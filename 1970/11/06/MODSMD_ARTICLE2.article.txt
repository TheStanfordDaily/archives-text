# Grand Jury To Meet On San Jose Violence
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
The Santa Clara County Grand Jury
announced yesterday that it will meet
Monday to determine whether or not a
major investigation is warranted into
the violence during President Nixon's
campaign appearance in San Jose last
Thursday.
In a related development, Rep. Paul
N. McCloskey, R-Portola Valley, said
Wednesday that he had received
unverified reports that "hired agents"
had been employed to protest at
Nixon's campaign appearances.
Ernest Renzel, grand jury forman,
said that the jury's criminal complaint
subcommittee is meeting with top San
Jose police officials to gather
information about the incident.
According to Renzel, there must be
evidence that a felony was committed
and some indication of who committed
it before the Grand Jury can proceed
with an investigation.
The subcommittee's findings will be
discussed Monday, and if warranted,
turned over to the district attorney's
office for further investigation.
State Senator Alfred Alquist, D-San
Jose, called for the Grand Jury probe
just before the elections. He was
defeated in a bid for the lieutenant
governorship in the election.

Alquist declared that "suspicious
circumstances" surrounding the
President's visit justified an
investigation to see if there was a
conspiracy against the President or a
failure to protect him adequately.
Rep. McCloskey said that it had
been reported to him, but not verified,
that Secret Service agents told San Jose
police that "hired agents" had been
employed to protest at some of the
President's campaign appearances but
that they wouldn't be needed in San
Jose.
He also said that "tickets" for the
rally in the San Jose Civic Auditorium
reportedly were distributed to college
students as far away as the College of
San Mateo.
McClosky said that if evidence
turned up to support these charges he
would demand a congressional
investigation.
"If any political party hires
protesters to demonstrate to get some
political gain from it, then I think a
bipartisan congressional injuiry is
justified," he said.
An investigation of the charges by
various newsmen has turned up no new
details, although KQED-TV reported
Thursday night that the source of the
charges is a San Jose police officer.
