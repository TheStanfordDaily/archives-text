# In The Mail: Band Comment
## 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Although the strategies of
playcalling may better be left to
the Stanford football staff, there
are some aspects of football
Saturday on which a seasoned fan
may have a right to comment:
A. At both the USC and OSU
games, a yell leader pulled out a
"bag of laughs" when the Trojan
and Beaver bands took the field.
For a few minutes, this may be in
good fun, but when this device is
used to drown out these slightly
more competent musicians,
cynicism has stepped in.
Of course, we are college
students and realize the "Tom
Foolery," but if one has noticed,
a lot of Stanford Junior Rooters
listen intently to those "neat"
Stanford yell leaders.
Ironically it was the Stanford
band itself which pointed towards
Stanford's hypocrisy towards
marching bands. One of their
numbers during the OSU game has
the lyrics: . . you've gota go
where you want to go, do what
you want to do . . ."—right on in
the spirit of the Age of Aquarius.
But in light of the actions of
some Stanford students, one has
to rewrite these lyrics:

".. . you've gota go where you
want to go as long as it's where
we're going, you've gota do what
you want to do as long as it's
what we're doing." Sort of smacks
of the hypocrisy Tricky Dicky

spoke of in Phoenix.
It appears that on January 1 ,
Stanford will be successfully
played up on TV as champions of
the west. On the field it may
prove true, but in the stands there

still is some housekeeping to be
reckoned with.
Thanks,

Editor, THE DAILY:
1 just wanted to drop a line to
commend the band performance
before the Stan ford-Oregon State
game. I went to see the football
game, which I enjoyed, but 1 did
think the band rendition of the
National Anthem was the most
impressive I have heard.
Three of us all fairly cynical
and blase sports people wiped
tears from our eyes after the
playing, and when this group cries
generally it means the bartender
has given last call.
I was very impressed by your
football team, the campus and the
student body, but that band hit
me harder than anything I heard
in years.
I hope you will pass this on to
the band members.

Editor, THE DAILY:
1 just wanted to drop a line to
commend the band performance
before the Stan ford-Oregon State
game. I went to see the football
game, which I enjoyed, but 1 did
think the band rendition of the
National Anthem was the most
impressive I have heard.
Three of us all fairly cynical
and blase sports people wiped
tears from our eyes after the
playing, and when this group cries
generally it means the bartender
has given last call.
I was very impressed by your
football team, the campus and the
student body, but that band hit
me harder than anything I heard
in years.
I hope you will pass this on to
the band members.
Sincerely,

Editor, THE DAILY:
Although the strategies of
playcalling may better be left to
the Stanford football staff, there
are some aspects of football
Saturday on which a seasoned fan
may have a right to comment:
A. At both the USC and OSU
games, a yell leader pulled out a
"bag of laughs" when the Trojan
and Beaver bands took the field.
For a few minutes, this may be in
good fun, but when this device is
used to drown out these slightly
more competent musicians,
cynicism has stepped in.
Of course, we are college
students and realize the "Tom
Foolery," but if one has noticed,
a lot of Stanford Junior Rooters
listen intently to those "neat"
Stanford yell leaders.
Ironically it was the Stanford
band itself which pointed towards
Stanford's hypocrisy towards
marching bands. One of their
numbers during the OSU game has
the lyrics: . . you've gota go
where you want to go, do what
you want to do . . ."—right on in
the spirit of the Age of Aquarius.
But in light of the actions of
some Stanford students, one has
to rewrite these lyrics:

".. . you've gota go where you
want to go as long as it's where
we're going, you've gota do what
you want to do as long as it's
what we're doing." Sort of smacks
of the hypocrisy Tricky Dicky

spoke of in Phoenix.
It appears that on January 1 ,
Stanford will be successfully
played up on TV as champions of
the west. On the field it may
prove true, but in the stands there

still is some housekeeping to be
reckoned with.
