Speed Destroys Arteries
LOS ANGELES - Eight doctors reported Thursday a
newly discovered, sometimes fatal disease among users
of dangerous drugs—especially Methamphetamine,
known to drug users as "speed" or "meth."
By conservative estimate, 10 percent of "speed"
users will get the disease, one of the doctors said.
"Deaths occurring in young people using a large
variety of drugs have often remained unexplained," the
report said.
The disease destroys arteries leading to major
organs—kidneys, stomach, small intestine, liver,
pancreas and other organs, the doctors said.
The doctors, who published their report in the New
England Journal of Medicine said they observed 14
patients with an average age of 2 5 who had used drugs
for periods of three months to five years.
They said four of them died of the disease, which
they call "necrotizing angiitis," meaning the death of
an organ from inflammation.
They said they were releasing their report because
of its "potential importance and broad implications,"
and to alert other doctors to the disease.
Their report said because so many drugs were used
among the patients, including heroin, hashish, LSD and
amphetamines, it was not determined which drug
specifically caused the disease.
But combination use of LSD and
methamphetamine, or heroin and methamphetamine,
was most common in the group. Doctors said
methamphetamine had been used in all but two cases.
"I think we can now be a little stronger than we
were in the report and say that methamphetamine
probably is the cause of necrotizing angiitis. We think
it most likely is."
"We also studied patients who used only heroin, and
they don't get the disease," he said. "We studied users
of barbiturates, and they don't get it.
"You might consider LSD—we have seen vascular
changes with LSD. And because of the widespread use
of marijuana, it also has to be suspect, but we have no
data."
NY Temple Bombed
HENRIETTA, N.Y. - An explosion damaged Temple
Beth Am in this suburb of Rochester early today. No
injuries were reported.
Police searched for a red Oldsmobile station wagon

reported near the synagogue when the explosion
occurred.
The extent of the damage was not immediately
known, but a radio report from a sheriff's cruiser said
the back of the building had been blown out.
Two synagogues and other buildings in Rochester
have been damaged by bombs in recent weeks.
Cease Fire Expires
The U.S.-sponsored Middle East cease-fire expired at
midnight yesterday--2 p.m. PST—but the guns
remained silent.
Israel, Egypt and Jordan all had agreed to extend
the original 90-day standdown.
Peace seemed as far away as ever, however, with
negotiations still in the deep freeze.
Israel declared it would continue the cease-fire but
repeated its refusal to return to U.N. peace talks unless
Egypt withdraws Soviet-made missiles that Israel insists
were installed in the canal zone after the standstill
began.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat refused to move
back the missiles, saying they were installed before the
cease-fire began, but he said his troops would continue
the truce for a short period. He said Egypt would not
observe another 90-day truce unless there is some
progress in the peace talks.
College Riots Waning?
WASHINGTON — College administrators and faculty
members differ sharply with students over the primary
cause of campus violence, but an overwhelming
majority believe university confrontations are waning,
the President's Commission on Campus Unrest
reported Thursday.
The most likely targets for violent disruptions this
year are schools enrolling over 10,000 with low
admission standards and Reserve Office Training Corps
units on campus, the commission's report added.
The assessments were contained in a poll of college
presidents, faculty senate chairman and student body
presidents. The poll was taken by the commission in
July.
Administrators and faculty members cited the
Vietnam war as the primary cause of violent and
sporadic outbursts. Significantly, students felt that lack
of communication was the primary factor.

As for future confrontations, 66 percent of the
students, 7 0 percent of the administrators and 7 6
percent of the faculty members believed violent
confrontations would decrease this year.
Recommendations included calls for the
government to end the Indochina war, realign domestic
priorities, and give greater recognition to student
concerns.
State authorities were asked to refrain from
interfering with college affairs and to grant more funds
to the universities. Greater communication was stressed
for local communities.
On the campus itself, administrators were urged to
establish better channels of communication with
students. Students were urged to work within the
system.
Natural High ?
SAN DIEGO - A mental health expert says efforts to
deal with the marijuana problem should begin with
recognition that it is normal for people to seek altered
states of consciousness.
"Deep down the human nervous system seeks
altered awareness," Dr. Andrew T. Weil said Thursday.
"I think we have to find ways to help people achieve
this in ways not harmful to themselves and others."
Most chronic marijuana users get "high" not
because the drug is intoxicating but because it unlocks
a path to emotional experience, he said in an interview.
"Marijuana is pharmacologically unimpressive,
probably less toxic than most drugs used in medicine,"
he asserted. "As a drug marijuana practically doesn't
do anything."
24 Americans Die
SAIGON — The U.S. Command said Thursday that 2 4
Americans were killed in action last week, the lowest
total in five years. Enemy losses were the lowest in
nearly four years, reflecting the drop in combat action
to South Vietnam.
The U.S. Command said 431 Americans were
wounded in action last week, an increase of 152 over
the week previous. Official figures showed Americans
killed in action in the war totaled 43,928 . The number
of wounded reached 291 ,4 55. The war's total of
Americans killed in accidents or from illness now is
8,753.
