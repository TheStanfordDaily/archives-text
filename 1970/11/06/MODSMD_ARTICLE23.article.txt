# War Crimes Charges Against Local Figures
## 
### 
A "War Crimes Commission," aimed
at awakening political activism on
campus, will begin Sunday night with a
session on "Genocide in Southeast
Asia."
Robert Scheer, Peace and Freedom
Party candidate for Senator in last
Tuesday's election, will lead the charges
of a U.S. slaughter of Asian peoples.
The forum, in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, 7 :30 p.m., is sponsored by
the New Left Project. It will initiate a
series of mock hearings to press
"criminal charges" against local figures
allegedly involved in supporting the
Indochina War, Defense Department
research, and overall U.S. foreign
policy.
Three speakers will describe their
first hand experiences in Asian and
Communist countries.
Scheer was editor of "Ramparts
Magazine" for five years. This summer
he visited North Vietnam, North Korea,
and Communist China in a tour led by

exiled Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver.
Another speaker, Andy Truskier, a
member of Berkeley's Red Family
collective, was also on that tour. The
third speaker, Earl Martin, observed
"forced urbanization" during three
years as a volunteer in South Vietnam.
Those attending the forum will be
encouraged to join investigations of
"war crimes" at Stanford and in
mid-Peninsula communities. Katherine
Barkley of the New Left Project said
such "crimes" may range from Defense
Department research to "domestic
genocide" of the Black Panthers.
Results of the investigations will be
presented at future War Crime
Commission meetings. Miss Barkley
says the New Left Project hopes to
build a movement for this year from
interest in the hearings.
A leaflet promoting the hearings
pledged to "take whatever action
necessary" to eliminate war-related
work on and off campus.
