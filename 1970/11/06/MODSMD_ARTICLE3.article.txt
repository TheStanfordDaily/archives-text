# Justice Department Officials Visit To Determine What Is Going On
## 
### 
Benjamin Holman, Assistant Attorney General in charge of
community relations services for the U.S. Department of
Justice visited campus yesterday meeting with minority groups
and administrators, and participating in a Law Forum last
night. The forum, including a panel of law students and two
other Justice Department officials, drew a quiet audience of
close to 100 students.
Holman's visit was part of a nation-wide program of the
Justice Department to send representatives to various
campuses in order, according to Holman, "to keep in touch
with what is going on."
The exchange, arranged by the Stanford Law Forum and
chaired by Law Professor Jack Friedenthal, centered on the
justice officials explaining administration policies.
Tokenism For Blacks
Holman, a black, said, "Integration has been mere tokenism
for most blacks. It is of little relevance in the ghetto. I'm more
concerned with community control and decentralization."'
Later when asked about a Berkeley ballot proposition to
separate the city into three separate districts with individual
police departments, he said, "I don't agree with that
proposition. I have some problems in complete

decentralization because I think from a realistic standpoint it
would not make for efficient law enforcement."
Another justice official, Pat Abraham, was asked why the
police were not indicted following the fatal shooting of Fred
Hampton in Chicago. Abraham said the justice department
could not prove the intent of the officers without testimony
from the Black Panthers who survived the attack.
Police Efficiency
She was then asked, "Does that mean that if the police had
been more efficient and killed them all, that you could not
prosecute?" Abraham responded that if they had all been
killed that "There would be no chance of federal indictment."
Abraham also was forced to defend her boss, Jerres
Leonard, a member of the all white Eagles club before coming
to the justice department. She was asked, "Isn't putting Mr.
Leonard as the head of civil rights division like asking Adolph
Eichman to lead a bar mitzvah?"
She answered that as a member of the Eagles club Leonard
had tried to work "within the system" to change the club's
policy. When he was appointed to the civil rights division of
the Justice Department he dropped out of the club, which
continues to maintain its exclusive admissions policies.
