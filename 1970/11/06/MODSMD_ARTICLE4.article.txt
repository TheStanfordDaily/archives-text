# Law School Professor Urges Legalization Of Grass
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
"There is a very strong element in
me that believes in the establishment,"
says Law Professor John Kaplan.
He comes down hard on radicals,
votes Republican, and has closely
cropped hair. A talk with the
41 -year-old lawyer might be similar to a
talk with a Middle American anywhere.
But Kaplan is more complex than any
stereotype. Singlehandedly, he leads a
crusade for the legalization of
marijuana, and theorizes that his efforts
will lead to legalization within seven
years.
John Kaplan's jump from Assistant
U.S. Attorney in San Francisco, a job
that he filled by busting marijuana
offenders, to his determined drive for
the legalization of marijuana is a
transformation that rivals Dr. Jekle and
Mr. Hyde.
In 1966, the California State
Legislature hired Kaplan to make a
thorough review of the California drug
laws. Kaplan knew nothing about
marijuana other than the information
he had collected in cases against drug
offenders in the U.S. attorney's office.
"I thought marijuana drove you crazy
and made you a criminal," he recalls.
Now, Kaplan confidently boasts, "It's a
completely one-sided matter. I've
picked the easiest issue in the world."
To many however, the issue is
neither one-sided nor easy to cope
with. Fears that pot leads to harder
drugs, concern over the police records

of children that are arrested for
possession, and confusion about the
reasons behind smoking grass in the
first place put marijuana high on the
list of major stumbling blocks between
generations.
Kaplan's book, Marijuana: The New
Prohibition makes a direct appeal to
establishment-oriented adults for the

legalization of marijuana. Kaplan argues
to middle America that present
marijuana laws, instead of helping in
the fight against dangerous drugs,
encourage the use of them; instead ot
upholding American values, flaunts
responsible lawmaking; and that the
total affect of the laws is more
damaging to American society than any

other issue except Vietnam.
"Anybody who wants this country
to go to seed," Kaplan noted, "also
wants the marijuana laws to stay just as
they are." This reverse order of the
connection between marijuana laws and
society hits a theme of patriotism and
respect that could conceivably take
marijuana out of the college dormitory

and into the house of Martha Mitchell.
Kaplan's crusade legitimizes the
efforts for legalization of grass in a way
that Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg
could never do. Respect for authority,
concern over the dangers of drug
addiction and Law and Order fit into
Kaplan's theory perfectly. "No matter
what your political valutas," says
Kaplan, "legalization of marijuana
advances them." Such an appeal may
very well convince the silent majority
that a few rabbit-eyed people are better
than a permanently damaged political
and social structure.
The primary factor in Kaplan's
decision to fight for legalization of
grass was the realization that the drug
was already an established part of the
society and laws that didn't recognize
that fact were threatening to destroy
the entire criminal code. "I'm not
introducing another evil," Kaplan
stated in an interview with KZSU, 4 T'm
merely recognizing, as all of us should,
that we've got it."
"In other words," he continued, "if
there were no such thing as marijuana,
and nobody were using It, it would be a
different question. But here the law is
widely flaunted. Marijuana is freely
available in all kinds of areas. The
question is not should we have
marijuana, but should be have it
illegally or legally. And in that respect,
it is far less damaging to society to have
it legally."
Kaplan constructs his

establishment-oriented argument for
legalization on the basis of costs to
society. "Don't get the idea that
nobody can be hurt by grass," he warns
in Establishment tones, "I cannot
escape the feeling that drug use, aside
from any harm it does, is somehow
wrong," he notes in his book. Still, he
says, "It's a weakness we have to
tolerate."
The costs of the present laws on
society are very high according to
Kaplan. "Marijuana laws cause grave
doubts about the integrity of the
political process in America, and I
think that they are in part responsible
for a great deal of present day
dissatisfaction."
An additional cost can be found on
the California police files, which
contain the names of 50,000 smokers
busted last year. 'These people know
the injustice of laws that put them
behind bars," Kaplan notes, "and I
estimate there are 2 0 million people
who have tried marijuana in the United
States todav.
The result of having a massive
number of technical criminals who
smoke pot is what Kaplan calls a
"non-repentant criminal."
"Being a criminal by legislative fire
somehow makes you less respectful of
the legislature that has passed the
laws," Kaplan contends, "and of the
police force that enforces them.
"When 1 grew up we were taught

that the police force was our friend,
that we ourselves had nothing to fear
from the police." With the widespread
use of grass however the situation has
changed. "Today, the marijuana user
knows that he does have something to
fear from the police. That has done a
great deal to damage police community
relations, especially with the young in
white, middle class society."
Widespread disrespect for police and
other forms of law enforcement during
prohibition Kaplan notes, is more than
coincidental to the widespread
disrespect of police today.
Kaplan hopes that through his book

and personal appearances he can
convince long-time opponents of
marijuana legalization to realize their
error. "It's going to take awhile for
people to realize that what they have
believed for the last 30 years to be true
about marijuana just isn't true," he
predicts, "but if I can convince people
that I'm honest, legalization is
inevitable."
"Until this issue of marijuana is
intelligently handled," Kaplan notes,
"progress in the far broader area of
drug abuse will be impossible. For this
reason, I want the book to reach as
many establishment parents as
possible."

me that believes in the establishment,"

first place put marijuana high on the
list of major stumbling blocks between
generations.
Kaplan's book, Marijuana: The New
Prohibition makes a direct appeal to
establishment-oriented adults for the

legalization of marijuana. Kaplan argues
to middle America that present
marijuana laws, instead of helping in
the fight against dangerous drugs,
encourage the use of them; instead ot
upholding American values, flaunts
responsible lawmaking; and that the
total affect of the laws is more
damaging to American society than any

other issue except Vietnam.
"Anybody who wants this country
to go to seed," Kaplan noted, "also
wants the marijuana laws to stay just as
they are." This reverse order of the
connection between marijuana laws and
society hits a theme of patriotism and
respect that could conceivably take
marijuana out of the college dormitory

and into the house of Martha Mitchell.
Kaplan's crusade legitimizes the
efforts for legalization of grass in a way
that Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg
could never do. Respect for authority,
concern over the dangers of drug
addiction and Law and Order fit into
Kaplan's theory perfectly. "No matter
what your political valutas," says
Kaplan, "legalization of marijuana
advances them." Such an appeal may
very well convince the silent majority
that a few rabbit-eyed people are better
than a permanently damaged political
and social structure.
The primary factor in Kaplan's
decision to fight for legalization of
grass was the realization that the drug
was already an established part of the
society and laws that didn't recognize
that fact were threatening to destroy
the entire criminal code. "I'm not
introducing another evil," Kaplan
stated in an interview with KZSU, 4 T'm
merely recognizing, as all of us should,
that we've got it."
"In other words," he continued, "if
there were no such thing as marijuana,
and nobody were using It, it would be a
different question. But here the law is
widely flaunted. Marijuana is freely
available in all kinds of areas. The
question is not should we have
marijuana, but should be have it
illegally or legally. And in that respect,
it is far less damaging to society to have
it legally."
Kaplan constructs his

establishment-oriented argument for
legalization on the basis of costs to
society. "Don't get the idea that
nobody can be hurt by grass," he warns
in Establishment tones, "I cannot
escape the feeling that drug use, aside
from any harm it does, is somehow
wrong," he notes in his book. Still, he
says, "It's a weakness we have to
tolerate."
The costs of the present laws on
society are very high according to
Kaplan. "Marijuana laws cause grave
doubts about the integrity of the
political process in America, and I
think that they are in part responsible
for a great deal of present day
dissatisfaction."
An additional cost can be found on
the California police files, which
contain the names of 50,000 smokers
busted last year. 'These people know
the injustice of laws that put them
behind bars," Kaplan notes, "and I
estimate there are 2 0 million people
who have tried marijuana in the United
States todav.
The result of having a massive
number of technical criminals who
smoke pot is what Kaplan calls a
"non-repentant criminal."
"Being a criminal by legislative fire
somehow makes you less respectful of
the legislature that has passed the
laws," Kaplan contends, "and of the
police force that enforces them.
"When 1 grew up we were taught

that the police force was our friend,
that we ourselves had nothing to fear
from the police." With the widespread
use of grass however the situation has
changed. "Today, the marijuana user
knows that he does have something to
fear from the police. That has done a
great deal to damage police community
relations, especially with the young in
white, middle class society."
Widespread disrespect for police and
other forms of law enforcement during
prohibition Kaplan notes, is more than
coincidental to the widespread
disrespect of police today.
Kaplan hopes that through his book

and personal appearances he can
convince long-time opponents of
marijuana legalization to realize their
error. "It's going to take awhile for
people to realize that what they have
believed for the last 30 years to be true
about marijuana just isn't true," he
predicts, "but if I can convince people
that I'm honest, legalization is
inevitable."
"Until this issue of marijuana is
intelligently handled," Kaplan notes,
"progress in the far broader area of
drug abuse will be impossible. For this
reason, I want the book to reach as
many establishment parents as
possible."
"There is a very strong element in
me that believes in the establishment,"
says Law Professor John Kaplan.
He comes down hard on radicals,
votes Republican, and has closely
cropped hair. A talk with the
41 -year-old lawyer might be similar to a
talk with a Middle American anywhere.
But Kaplan is more complex than any
stereotype. Singlehandedly, he leads a
crusade for the legalization of
marijuana, and theorizes that his efforts
will lead to legalization within seven
years.
John Kaplan's jump from Assistant
U.S. Attorney in San Francisco, a job
that he filled by busting marijuana
offenders, to his determined drive for
the legalization of marijuana is a
transformation that rivals Dr. Jekle and
Mr. Hyde.
In 1966, the California State
Legislature hired Kaplan to make a
thorough review of the California drug
laws. Kaplan knew nothing about
marijuana other than the information
he had collected in cases against drug
offenders in the U.S. attorney's office.
"I thought marijuana drove you crazy
and made you a criminal," he recalls.
Now, Kaplan confidently boasts, "It's a
completely one-sided matter. I've
picked the easiest issue in the world."
To many however, the issue is
neither one-sided nor easy to cope
with. Fears that pot leads to harder
drugs, concern over the police records

of children that are arrested for
possession, and confusion about the
reasons behind smoking grass in the
first place put marijuana high on the
list of major stumbling blocks between
generations.

that fact were threatening to destroy
the entire criminal code. "I'm not
introducing another evil," Kaplan
stated in an interview with KZSU, 4 T'm
merely recognizing, as all of us should,
that we've got it."
"In other words," he continued, "if
there were no such thing as marijuana,
and nobody were using It, it would be a
different question. But here the law is
widely flaunted. Marijuana is freely
available in all kinds of areas. The
question is not should we have
marijuana, but should be have it
illegally or legally. And in that respect,
it is far less damaging to society to have
it legally."
Kaplan constructs his

establishment-oriented argument for
legalization on the basis of costs to
society. "Don't get the idea that
nobody can be hurt by grass," he warns
in Establishment tones, "I cannot
escape the feeling that drug use, aside
from any harm it does, is somehow
wrong," he notes in his book. Still, he
says, "It's a weakness we have to
tolerate."
The costs of the present laws on
society are very high according to
Kaplan. "Marijuana laws cause grave
doubts about the integrity of the
political process in America, and I
think that they are in part responsible
for a great deal of present day
dissatisfaction."
An additional cost can be found on
the California police files, which
contain the names of 50,000 smokers
busted last year. 'These people know
the injustice of laws that put them
behind bars," Kaplan notes, "and I
estimate there are 2 0 million people
who have tried marijuana in the United
States todav.
The result of having a massive
number of technical criminals who
smoke pot is what Kaplan calls a
"non-repentant criminal."
"Being a criminal by legislative fire
somehow makes you less respectful of
the legislature that has passed the
laws," Kaplan contends, "and of the
police force that enforces them.
"When 1 grew up we were taught

that the police force was our friend,
that we ourselves had nothing to fear
from the police." With the widespread
use of grass however the situation has
changed. "Today, the marijuana user
knows that he does have something to
fear from the police. That has done a
great deal to damage police community
relations, especially with the young in
white, middle class society."
Widespread disrespect for police and
other forms of law enforcement during
prohibition Kaplan notes, is more than
coincidental to the widespread
disrespect of police today.
Kaplan hopes that through his book

and personal appearances he can
convince long-time opponents of
marijuana legalization to realize their
error. "It's going to take awhile for
people to realize that what they have
believed for the last 30 years to be true
about marijuana just isn't true," he
predicts, "but if I can convince people
that I'm honest, legalization is
inevitable."
"Until this issue of marijuana is
intelligently handled," Kaplan notes,
"progress in the far broader area of
drug abuse will be impossible. For this
reason, I want the book to reach as
many establishment parents as
possible."
"There is a very strong element in
me that believes in the establishment,"
says Law Professor John Kaplan.
He comes down hard on radicals,
votes Republican, and has closely
cropped hair. A talk with the
41 -year-old lawyer might be similar to a
talk with a Middle American anywhere.
But Kaplan is more complex than any
stereotype. Singlehandedly, he leads a
crusade for the legalization of
marijuana, and theorizes that his efforts
will lead to legalization within seven
years.
John Kaplan's jump from Assistant
U.S. Attorney in San Francisco, a job
that he filled by busting marijuana
offenders, to his determined drive for
the legalization of marijuana is a
transformation that rivals Dr. Jekle and
Mr. Hyde.
In 1966, the California State
Legislature hired Kaplan to make a
thorough review of the California drug
laws. Kaplan knew nothing about
marijuana other than the information
he had collected in cases against drug
offenders in the U.S. attorney's office.
"I thought marijuana drove you crazy
and made you a criminal," he recalls.
Now, Kaplan confidently boasts, "It's a
completely one-sided matter. I've
picked the easiest issue in the world."
To many however, the issue is
neither one-sided nor easy to cope
with. Fears that pot leads to harder
drugs, concern over the police records

of children that are arrested for
possession, and confusion about the
reasons behind smoking grass in the
first place put marijuana high on the
list of major stumbling blocks between
generations.
Kaplan's book, Marijuana: The New
Prohibition makes a direct appeal to
establishment-oriented adults for the

legalization of marijuana. Kaplan argues
to middle America that present
marijuana laws, instead of helping in
the fight against dangerous drugs,
encourage the use of them; instead ot
upholding American values, flaunts
responsible lawmaking; and that the
total affect of the laws is more
damaging to American society than any

other issue except Vietnam.
"Anybody who wants this country
to go to seed," Kaplan noted, "also
wants the marijuana laws to stay just as
they are." This reverse order of the
connection between marijuana laws and
society hits a theme of patriotism and
respect that could conceivably take
marijuana out of the college dormitory

and into the house of Martha Mitchell.
Kaplan's crusade legitimizes the
efforts for legalization of grass in a way
that Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg
could never do. Respect for authority,
concern over the dangers of drug
addiction and Law and Order fit into
Kaplan's theory perfectly. "No matter
what your political valutas," says
Kaplan, "legalization of marijuana
advances them." Such an appeal may
very well convince the silent majority
that a few rabbit-eyed people are better
than a permanently damaged political
and social structure.
The primary factor in Kaplan's
decision to fight for legalization of
grass was the realization that the drug
was already an established part of the
society and laws that didn't recognize
that fact were threatening to destroy
the entire criminal code. "I'm not
introducing another evil," Kaplan
stated in an interview with KZSU, 4 T'm
