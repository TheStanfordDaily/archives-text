## Left Brings Repression 
### 
max lerner

The hateful attack on President Nixon at San
Jose is another instance of the vicious passions and
the suicidal lemming-drive on the far left.
But 1 wish the President were in a better moral
position to condemn not only this monstrous
physical violence and divisiveness but verbal
divisiveness as well. His genuine distress and
anger- and he had plenty of reason for it- would
carry more weight if he and Vice President Agnew
had not, by their election strategy, exploited the
"radic-lib" theme against honest liberals and added
to the social passions of the nation.
One has to put the question of motive: Why did
the mob of hooligans move from antiwar
demonstration to a deliberate, violent attack on
the President with eggs, bricks, bottles-the
crudest mob violence aimed at any President in
our memory and the worst aimed at Mr. Nixon
since the episode in Caracus? Surely, they must
have known that the consequences would be
severe and that the large majority of Americans
would recoil from it in alarm and disgust.
Deliberate
Of course they knew it and did it deliberately,
willing the ends as well as the means. The
argument of many liberals, that this sort of
violence is "counterproductive," doesn't really
move the far-out left. That is exactly what they
intended it to be.
The one thing they cannot tolerate is the
thought that the elections will follow their course
and- whoever comes out ahead-end without
violence, that a number of Democratic and
Republican liberals would get elected, and thus the
students and blacks and unemployed could think
"the system" was working.
Hence, the calculated design to stir up passions,
weaken the liberals, make sure they go down to
defeat and thus radicalize the marginal groups for
whose revolutionary commitment they are aiming.
Modern History
Does this sound cynical? No more so that has
been true of any far-left movements in modern
history. The capitalist system, Lenin said, "won't
fall: It must be dropped."
As I pointed out at the time, before Hitler came
to power in Germany the Communists had laid
down the line that the Weimar Republic must be
toppled, however heavy the Fascist repression that

would follow, to radicalize the workers and allow
communism to inherit Germany.
I call it a suicidal lemming tactic because—aside
from helping to destroy the society it is
presumably meant to transform- it won't work for
the far left in America any more than it did in
Germany. For every person radicalized toward the
far left there will be three radicalized toward the
far right.
Nor will power end up in the hands of men like
Mr. Nixon (who is a liberal every other Wednesday
and Friday, when he is not playing the stern savior
of his country from the radic-libs), nor like Agnew
(who in ancient times was the man from the
center, in Maryland), nor like Reagon (who once
traversed the fellow traveler road of Popular Front
causes).
Fascists
No, power is more likely to end with real
Fascists. If fascism comes to America, Huey Long
once said, it will be called antifascism. Let me put
it somewhat differently: If fascism comes to
America, it will be in reaction to an idiot tactic by
a small group which calls itself antifascist and
which counts on exploiting the repression it is
anxious to bring on.
What makes it worse is the way the Nixon
election strategy has played into these hands for
the moment, by casting a cloud of suspicion and
guilt-by-association across the country. Reporters
on the Nixon trip have noted that small groups of
demonstrators were allowed into the rallies, and it
isn't a wild guess that the strategists counted on
the reaction of the audience to their epithets.
We forgot in our peril—and that applies to Mr.
Nixon, too—that more than an Administration's
political fortunes are put on the line when a
President gets too entangled in a party campaign
and that more than a man called Richard Nixon is
attacked when the President is assailed by a mob
with a hail of rocks. It is the Presidency as an
office that gets entangled and the Presidency as an
office that is assailed.
The office will survive the pride of the men
who fill it, as it has survived the rage of its enemies
who attack it. But the society will be healthier and
saner if we can keep the integrity of the office
intact.

would recoil from it in alarm and disgust.
Deliberate
Of course they knew it and did it deliberately,
willing the ends as well as the means. The
argument of many liberals, that this sort of
violence is "counterproductive," doesn't really
move the far-out left. That is exactly what they
intended it to be.
The one thing they cannot tolerate is the
thought that the elections will follow their course
and- whoever comes out ahead-end without
violence, that a number of Democratic and
Republican liberals would get elected, and thus the
students and blacks and unemployed could think
"the system" was working.
Hence, the calculated design to stir up passions,
weaken the liberals, make sure they go down to
defeat and thus radicalize the marginal groups for
whose revolutionary commitment they are aiming.
Modern History
Does this sound cynical? No more so that has
been true of any far-left movements in modern
history. The capitalist system, Lenin said, "won't
fall: It must be dropped."
As I pointed out at the time, before Hitler came
to power in Germany the Communists had laid
down the line that the Weimar Republic must be
toppled, however heavy the Fascist repression that

would follow, to radicalize the workers and allow
communism to inherit Germany.
I call it a suicidal lemming tactic because—aside
from helping to destroy the society it is
presumably meant to transform- it won't work for
the far left in America any more than it did in
Germany. For every person radicalized toward the
far left there will be three radicalized toward the
far right.
Nor will power end up in the hands of men like
Mr. Nixon (who is a liberal every other Wednesday
and Friday, when he is not playing the stern savior
of his country from the radic-libs), nor like Agnew
(who in ancient times was the man from the
center, in Maryland), nor like Reagon (who once
traversed the fellow traveler road of Popular Front
causes).
Fascists
No, power is more likely to end with real
Fascists. If fascism comes to America, Huey Long
once said, it will be called antifascism. Let me put
it somewhat differently: If fascism comes to
America, it will be in reaction to an idiot tactic by
a small group which calls itself antifascist and
which counts on exploiting the repression it is
anxious to bring on.
What makes it worse is the way the Nixon
election strategy has played into these hands for
the moment, by casting a cloud of suspicion and
guilt-by-association across the country. Reporters
on the Nixon trip have noted that small groups of
demonstrators were allowed into the rallies, and it
isn't a wild guess that the strategists counted on
the reaction of the audience to their epithets.
We forgot in our peril—and that applies to Mr.
Nixon, too—that more than an Administration's
political fortunes are put on the line when a
President gets too entangled in a party campaign
and that more than a man called Richard Nixon is
attacked when the President is assailed by a mob
with a hail of rocks. It is the Presidency as an
office that gets entangled and the Presidency as an
office that is assailed.
The office will survive the pride of the men
who fill it, as it has survived the rage of its enemies
who attack it. But the society will be healthier and
saner if we can keep the integrity of the office
intact.

SILENT MAJORITY- One Nixon rooter watches the goings-on at San
Jose.

The hateful attack on President Nixon at San
Jose is another instance of the vicious passions and
the suicidal lemming-drive on the far left.
But 1 wish the President were in a better moral
position to condemn not only this monstrous
physical violence and divisiveness but verbal
divisiveness as well. His genuine distress and
anger- and he had plenty of reason for it- would
carry more weight if he and Vice President Agnew
had not, by their election strategy, exploited the
"radic-lib" theme against honest liberals and added
to the social passions of the nation.
One has to put the question of motive: Why did
the mob of hooligans move from antiwar
demonstration to a deliberate, violent attack on
the President with eggs, bricks, bottles-the
crudest mob violence aimed at any President in
our memory and the worst aimed at Mr. Nixon
since the episode in Caracus? Surely, they must
have known that the consequences would be
severe and that the large majority of Americans
would recoil from it in alarm and disgust.
Deliberate
Of course they knew it and did it deliberately,
