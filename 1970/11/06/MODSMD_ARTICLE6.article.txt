Editor, THE DAILY:
I've been very pleased with the
great steps taken by the Daily in
liberating the sexually different
from the stigma of
non-recognition, but I fear that
another facet of liberation is being
unjustly ignored. I refer, of
course, to the great necrophiliac
minority on campus. Too many
latent necros are afraid to be
honest with themselves for fear of
harassment from friends, police,
and the local coroner.
It's about time the Stanford
necros got together to protest
prejudicial flicks like Dracula, and
unconsciously slurring expressions
like, "Enough to raise the dead."
We should get together to discuss
our mutual problems, the
unexperienced learning from the
initiates. Those of us who have
been at Stanford for a while can
explain the difficulties of breaking
into the dissecting rooms at the
Medical Center, and the need for
an Organized Necrophiliac Front
to elect officials that are
sympathetic to our point of view.
If you are a necro, and a recent
survey shows that you are, even if
you don't realize it, and you want
to meet others in places other

than the cemetaries, please let us
hear from you in care of the Dead
Letter office.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Not hard to recognize I'm back
at Stanford; Michelob bottles
thrown into the bushes so no one
will see them, Almond Joy
wrappers growing proliferously
along the sidewalks, ecology
posters dribbled down White Plaza
by feet who haven't the time to
stop and bend over. Sure had a
nice Ecology day last year, great
seminars on saving our
environment, all the heavy talk
about ways to solve our pollution
problems. Fantastic ideas from
our leaders of tomorrow, and we
all complacently wait for someone
else to pick up the garbage.
But then who wants to get
chocolate all over his fingers, and
what about all those nasty germs
dear old Mom always told you
about breeding in garbage? And
besides, who wants to walk
around with a pocket full of
garbage all day and smell up the
pockets of their newly-bleached
blue jeans? No reason to do it,

easier to let it be, and God bless
the maintenance man!
Randy Funkhouser
Student Apathy?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The contrast made repeatedly
between the fervor of last spring
and "student apathy" now is
seriously misleading. That fervor
was compounded of a sense of
betrayal when the war was again
escalated and a terrified
realization that no normal
political process seemed capable
of stopping the killing.
The spontaneous outcry forced
Congress to an unprecedented
act -to try to stop a full scale
foreign war by denial of funds; it
also forced the Administration to
back off from an open-ended
commitment to a posture which
could be verbally defended as an
operation "covering withdrawal."
This allayed some of the terror,
and allowed those who did not
favor radical change (or who
believed it "impossible") to
redirect this sudden burst of
energy into "normal" channels.
This was partly naive and partly
cynical. Most of the nomination
campaigns were already complete,
or inaccessible to redirection.
How many Congressmen elected
on November 2 owe their
selection to their stand on the
Cooper-Church or
McGovern-Hatfield amendments?
Disinterest in the election was not
"apathy" but recognition that this
election could not end the war.

latent necros are afraid to be
honest with themselves for fear of
harassment from friends, police,
and the local coroner.
It's about time the Stanford
necros got together to protest
prejudicial flicks like Dracula, and
unconsciously slurring expressions
like, "Enough to raise the dead."
We should get together to discuss
our mutual problems, the
unexperienced learning from the
initiates. Those of us who have
been at Stanford for a while can
explain the difficulties of breaking
into the dissecting rooms at the
Medical Center, and the need for
an Organized Necrophiliac Front
to elect officials that are
sympathetic to our point of view.
If you are a necro, and a recent
survey shows that you are, even if
you don't realize it, and you want
to meet others in places other

than the cemetaries, please let us
hear from you in care of the Dead
Letter office.

Not hard to recognize I'm back
at Stanford; Michelob bottles
thrown into the bushes so no one
will see them, Almond Joy
wrappers growing proliferously
along the sidewalks, ecology
posters dribbled down White Plaza
by feet who haven't the time to
stop and bend over. Sure had a
nice Ecology day last year, great
seminars on saving our
environment, all the heavy talk
about ways to solve our pollution
problems. Fantastic ideas from
our leaders of tomorrow, and we
all complacently wait for someone
else to pick up the garbage.
But then who wants to get
chocolate all over his fingers, and
what about all those nasty germs
dear old Mom always told you
about breeding in garbage? And
besides, who wants to walk
around with a pocket full of
garbage all day and smell up the
pockets of their newly-bleached
blue jeans? No reason to do it,

easier to let it be, and God bless
the maintenance man!

Student Apathy?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The contrast made repeatedly
between the fervor of last spring
and "student apathy" now is
seriously misleading. That fervor
was compounded of a sense of
betrayal when the war was again
escalated and a terrified
realization that no normal
political process seemed capable
of stopping the killing.
The spontaneous outcry forced
Congress to an unprecedented
act -to try to stop a full scale
foreign war by denial of funds; it
also forced the Administration to
back off from an open-ended
commitment to a posture which
could be verbally defended as an
operation "covering withdrawal."
This allayed some of the terror,
and allowed those who did not
favor radical change (or who
believed it "impossible") to
redirect this sudden burst of
energy into "normal" channels.
This was partly naive and partly
cynical. Most of the nomination
campaigns were already complete,
or inaccessible to redirection.
How many Congressmen elected
on November 2 owe their
selection to their stand on the
Cooper-Church or
McGovern-Hatfield amendments?
Disinterest in the election was not
"apathy" but recognition that this
election could not end the war.

I've been very pleased with the
great steps taken by the Daily in
liberating the sexually different
from the stigma of
non-recognition, but I fear that
another facet of liberation is being
unjustly ignored. I refer, of
course, to the great necrophiliac
minority on campus. Too many
