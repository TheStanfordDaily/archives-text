## New Approach For Bored Protesters 
### 
Bored with anti-war protest?
That's understandable. The
teach-ins and demonstrations have
been going on for years now. And
there's no end for the war in sight.
Nixon sits watching football
games when Americans hit the
streets, and then escalates the
genocide and makes phoney peace
proposals.
Even though you may be
bored, the war is not the same old
thing it was last year. And the
facts coming in the last six
months indicate that if you were
ever thinking about doing
something to get the U.S. out of
Southeast Asia, it better be now
before it's too late.
Nixon's strategy in Asia, billed
as The Nixon Doctrine, becomes
clearer every day. Troop
withdrawals are coupled with
massive intensification of the
bombing and technological
warfare. Japanese militarism is
being revived to share the future
burden of repressing Asian
insurgencies.
The kind of peace Nixon seeks
in Vietnam, he admitted frankly
last week, is the kind that will
"discourage" or "deter" future
wars of aggression against
U.S. -supported governments-a
Pax Americana for the Third
World. As he said last year
regarding the National Liberation
Front: "We have to demonstrate. .
. that confrontation with the
United States is costly and
unrewarding." In the words of
Jean Paul Sartre, "those whom
the United States wished to
intimidate and terrorize via the
Vietnamese people are the human
group in its entirety."
Falling Dominoes
The falling dominoes are
foremost on Nixon's mind.
Behind the wave of revolution in
the underdeveloped world lies the
indisputable success of socialism
in China, North Korea, and North
Vietnam. If America and free
enterprise are kicked out of
Indochina, where will it end? In
1965, in a letter to the New York
Times Nixon said: "Victory for
the Viet Cong. . . would mean
ultimately the destruction of
freedom of speech for all men for
all time not only in Asia but in
the United States as well."
Nixon can make a statement
like that because the American
public is almost totally ignorant
about Asian communism. We've
been told for the last 2 0 years
that billions of dollars and
millions of lives were being spent
to defend the world from a fate
worse than death—communism.

And while we chum around with
the "communists" in the Soviet
Union, we are waging the most
massive war in history against a
peasant movement for
communism in tiny Vietnam.
A revived anti-war movement
has to confront anti-communism
head on. One anti-war leader who
for several years has been writing
and speaking on anti-communism
and U.S. foreign policy is Robert
Scheer, former editor of Ramparts
and Peace and Freedom Party
candidate for U.S. Senator. Scheer
will be one of the speakers at the
first hearing of Stanford's War
Crimes Commission this Sunday
night, 7:30 at Dinkelspiel.
Asia And America
After spending three months
this summer in China, North
Korea, and North Vietnam,
Scheer is convinced that people
have more real freedom and
democracy in Asian communist
countries than in America.
Contrary to U.S. propaganda, no
one in these countries is starving
or living in squalor. North Korea,
which was totally leveled by the
Americans less than twenty years
ago, and China have been highly
successful in achieving their plans
for economic development.
The real threat to the U.S.
from Asian revolutions and Asian
communism is not directed at our
freedoms or to our national
security but rather to American
political and economic control of
Third World destiny. The threat

grows daily that U.S. corporations
will lose the privileged access to
raw materials, markets, and
profitable investments which they
acquired from the crumbling
European colonial empires. And if
Nixon was willing to advocate in
1954 the use of nuclear weapons
to maintain French colonialism in
Asia, one shudders to think of the
extent to which he will go to
maintain the American empire.
Boredom with the war is
possible if people fail to recognize
Vietnam as the most serious
international showdown of our

time. Nixon understands this. He's
counting on our ignorance,
apathy, or despair, hoping that we
won't recognize until it's all over
that Laos, Cambodia, and
Vietnam are being exterminated.
'Vote For Peace'
Unless we act now, the
annihilation which was put into
full gear last year, will have been
completed long before our next
chance to "vote for peace." We
are going to have to accept the
fact that liberal forms of protest,
McCarthy campaigns and
Moratoriums, simply are not going
to work. Demonstrating moral
outrage is good for our guilty
consciences, but will not stop the
destruction in Asia. We have
kindly asked the war machine to
stop the genocide. Instead it
escalates. We are going to have
to start thinking in tactical terms,
to understand how we can best
cripple it.
As individuals we are
powerless. Only as communities
we do have power. The
community must say that it can
no longer accept the hypocrisy,
the lies, and the violence of the
government. We can no longer
accept manipulation in the name
of goodwill, genocide in the name
of democracy, invasions and
bombing in the name of peace.
The War is being fought in the
name of the American people We
as a community of American
people have to say No—this is not
our name. Neither our name, nor
any resources from our
community must go toward the

coercion, manipulation,
intervention or destruction of
U.S. foreign policy. And as long as
it continues these polities, the
United States government must
not be allowed in our community.
We must begin to resist, together.
Crimes commission
The Stanford War Crimes
Commission that has been set up
this week by the New Left Project
is a call to the Stanford-Peninsula
community to join together to
investigate any and all activities in
this area—research, training, or
production—which are part of or

in complicity with the United
States' genocidal foreign policy.
The Commission thus far has
only set up the first hearing of its
investigation, presenting testimony
from Robert Scheer and Andy
Truskier. Much of their
testimony—GENOClDE IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND ASIAN
COMMUNISM—wiII be from
information gathered from their
tour of North Korea, North
Vietnam, and China. Earl Martin
will give a personal account of the
U.S. genocidal policy, based on 3
years of experience in a South
Vietnamese province.
Besides laying a background of

katherine barkley

what communism and
anti-communism in Southeast
Asia is about, we will also takk
about the role that universities are
playing in complicity with the
war, and how interested people
can get together to do
investigations and hold further
hearings on the war crimes being
perpetrated in our midst.
Please come. Let's blow our
minds out of any apathy and
boredom they might have been
falling into.

for several years has been writing
and speaking on anti-communism
and U.S. foreign policy is Robert
Scheer, former editor of Ramparts
and Peace and Freedom Party
candidate for U.S. Senator. Scheer
will be one of the speakers at the
first hearing of Stanford's War
Crimes Commission this Sunday
night, 7:30 at Dinkelspiel.
Asia And America
After spending three months
this summer in China, North
Korea, and North Vietnam,
Scheer is convinced that people
have more real freedom and
democracy in Asian communist
countries than in America.
Contrary to U.S. propaganda, no
one in these countries is starving
or living in squalor. North Korea,
which was totally leveled by the
Americans less than twenty years
ago, and China have been highly
successful in achieving their plans
for economic development.
The real threat to the U.S.
from Asian revolutions and Asian
communism is not directed at our
freedoms or to our national
security but rather to American
political and economic control of
Third World destiny. The threat

grows daily that U.S. corporations
will lose the privileged access to
raw materials, markets, and
profitable investments which they
acquired from the crumbling
European colonial empires. And if
Nixon was willing to advocate in
1954 the use of nuclear weapons
to maintain French colonialism in
Asia, one shudders to think of the
extent to which he will go to
maintain the American empire.
Boredom with the war is
possible if people fail to recognize
Vietnam as the most serious
international showdown of our

time. Nixon understands this. He's
counting on our ignorance,
apathy, or despair, hoping that we
won't recognize until it's all over
that Laos, Cambodia, and
Vietnam are being exterminated.
'Vote For Peace'
Unless we act now, the
annihilation which was put into
full gear last year, will have been
completed long before our next
chance to "vote for peace." We
are going to have to accept the
fact that liberal forms of protest,
McCarthy campaigns and
Moratoriums, simply are not going
to work. Demonstrating moral
outrage is good for our guilty
consciences, but will not stop the
destruction in Asia. We have
kindly asked the war machine to
stop the genocide. Instead it
escalates. We are going to have
to start thinking in tactical terms,
to understand how we can best
cripple it.
As individuals we are
powerless. Only as communities
we do have power. The
community must say that it can
no longer accept the hypocrisy,
the lies, and the violence of the
government. We can no longer
accept manipulation in the name
of goodwill, genocide in the name
of democracy, invasions and
bombing in the name of peace.
The War is being fought in the
name of the American people We
as a community of American
people have to say No—this is not
our name. Neither our name, nor
any resources from our
community must go toward the

coercion, manipulation,
intervention or destruction of
U.S. foreign policy. And as long as
it continues these polities, the
United States government must
not be allowed in our community.
We must begin to resist, together.
Crimes commission
The Stanford War Crimes
Commission that has been set up
this week by the New Left Project
is a call to the Stanford-Peninsula
community to join together to
investigate any and all activities in
this area—research, training, or
production—which are part of or

in complicity with the United
States' genocidal foreign policy.
The Commission thus far has
only set up the first hearing of its
investigation, presenting testimony
from Robert Scheer and Andy
Truskier. Much of their
testimony—GENOClDE IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND ASIAN
COMMUNISM—wiII be from
information gathered from their
tour of North Korea, North
Vietnam, and China. Earl Martin
will give a personal account of the
U.S. genocidal policy, based on 3
years of experience in a South
Vietnamese province.
Besides laying a background of

katherine barkley

what communism and
anti-communism in Southeast
Asia is about, we will also takk
about the role that universities are
playing in complicity with the
war, and how interested people
can get together to do
investigations and hold further
hearings on the war crimes being
perpetrated in our midst.
Please come. Let's blow our
minds out of any apathy and
boredom they might have been
falling into.
Katherine Barkley, member of
the New Left Project, is co-editor
of Two, Three. .. Many Vietnams,
available in December

Bored with anti-war protest?
That's understandable. The
teach-ins and demonstrations have
been going on for years now. And
there's no end for the war in sight.
Nixon sits watching football
games when Americans hit the
streets, and then escalates the
genocide and makes phoney peace
proposals.
Even though you may be
bored, the war is not the same old
thing it was last year. And the
facts coming in the last six
months indicate that if you were
ever thinking about doing
something to get the U.S. out of
Southeast Asia, it better be now
before it's too late.
Nixon's strategy in Asia, billed
as The Nixon Doctrine, becomes
clearer every day. Troop
withdrawals are coupled with
massive intensification of the
bombing and technological
warfare. Japanese militarism is
being revived to share the future
burden of repressing Asian
insurgencies.
The kind of peace Nixon seeks
in Vietnam, he admitted frankly
last week, is the kind that will
"discourage" or "deter" future
wars of aggression against
U.S. -supported governments-a
Pax Americana for the Third
World. As he said last year
regarding the National Liberation
Front: "We have to demonstrate. .
. that confrontation with the
United States is costly and
unrewarding." In the words of
Jean Paul Sartre, "those whom
the United States wished to
intimidate and terrorize via the
Vietnamese people are the human
group in its entirety."
Falling Dominoes
The falling dominoes are
foremost on Nixon's mind.
Behind the wave of revolution in
the underdeveloped world lies the
indisputable success of socialism
in China, North Korea, and North
Vietnam. If America and free
enterprise are kicked out of
Indochina, where will it end? In
1965, in a letter to the New York
Times Nixon said: "Victory for
the Viet Cong. . . would mean
ultimately the destruction of
freedom of speech for all men for
all time not only in Asia but in
the United States as well."
Nixon can make a statement
like that because the American
public is almost totally ignorant
about Asian communism. We've
been told for the last 2 0 years
that billions of dollars and
millions of lives were being spent
to defend the world from a fate
worse than death—communism.

And while we chum around with
the "communists" in the Soviet
Union, we are waging the most
massive war in history against a
peasant movement for
communism in tiny Vietnam.
A revived anti-war movement
has to confront anti-communism
head on. One anti-war leader who

accept manipulation in the name
of goodwill, genocide in the name
of democracy, invasions and
bombing in the name of peace.
The War is being fought in the
name of the American people We
as a community of American
people have to say No—this is not
our name. Neither our name, nor
any resources from our
community must go toward the

coercion, manipulation,
intervention or destruction of

it continues these polities, the

Crimes commission
The Stanford War Crimes
Commission that has been set up
this week by the New Left Project
is a call to the Stanford-Peninsula
community to join together to
investigate any and all activities in
this area—research, training, or
production—which are part of or

in complicity with the United
States' genocidal foreign policy.
The Commission thus far has
only set up the first hearing of its
investigation, presenting testimony
from Robert Scheer and Andy
Truskier. Much of their
testimony—GENOClDE IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND ASIAN
COMMUNISM—wiII be from
information gathered from their
tour of North Korea, North
Vietnam, and China. Earl Martin
will give a personal account of the
U.S. genocidal policy, based on 3
years of experience in a South
Vietnamese province.
Besides laying a background of

katherine barkley

what communism and
anti-communism in Southeast
Asia is about, we will also takk
about the role that universities are
playing in complicity with the
war, and how interested people
can get together to do
investigations and hold further
hearings on the war crimes being
perpetrated in our midst.
Please come. Let's blow our
minds out of any apathy and
boredom they might have been
falling into.
Katherine Barkley, member of
the New Left Project, is co-editor
of Two, Three. .. Many Vietnams,
available in December

Bored with anti-war protest?
That's understandable. The
teach-ins and demonstrations have
been going on for years now. And
there's no end for the war in sight.
Nixon sits watching football
games when Americans hit the
streets, and then escalates the
genocide and makes phoney peace
proposals.
Even though you may be
bored, the war is not the same old
thing it was last year. And the
facts coming in the last six
months indicate that if you were
ever thinking about doing
something to get the U.S. out of
Southeast Asia, it better be now
before it's too late.
Nixon's strategy in Asia, billed
as The Nixon Doctrine, becomes
clearer every day. Troop
withdrawals are coupled with
massive intensification of the
bombing and technological
warfare. Japanese militarism is
being revived to share the future
burden of repressing Asian
insurgencies.
The kind of peace Nixon seeks
in Vietnam, he admitted frankly
last week, is the kind that will
"discourage" or "deter" future
wars of aggression against
U.S. -supported governments-a
Pax Americana for the Third
World. As he said last year
regarding the National Liberation
Front: "We have to demonstrate. .
. that confrontation with the
United States is costly and
unrewarding." In the words of
Jean Paul Sartre, "those whom
the United States wished to
intimidate and terrorize via the
Vietnamese people are the human
group in its entirety."
Falling Dominoes
The falling dominoes are
foremost on Nixon's mind.
Behind the wave of revolution in
the underdeveloped world lies the
indisputable success of socialism
in China, North Korea, and North
Vietnam. If America and free
enterprise are kicked out of
Indochina, where will it end? In
1965, in a letter to the New York
Times Nixon said: "Victory for
the Viet Cong. . . would mean
ultimately the destruction of
freedom of speech for all men for
all time not only in Asia but in
the United States as well."
Nixon can make a statement
like that because the American
public is almost totally ignorant
about Asian communism. We've
been told for the last 2 0 years
that billions of dollars and
millions of lives were being spent
to defend the world from a fate
worse than death—communism.

And while we chum around with
the "communists" in the Soviet
Union, we are waging the most
massive war in history against a
peasant movement for
communism in tiny Vietnam.
A revived anti-war movement
has to confront anti-communism
head on. One anti-war leader who
for several years has been writing
and speaking on anti-communism
and U.S. foreign policy is Robert
Scheer, former editor of Ramparts
and Peace and Freedom Party
candidate for U.S. Senator. Scheer
will be one of the speakers at the
first hearing of Stanford's War
Crimes Commission this Sunday
night, 7:30 at Dinkelspiel.
Asia And America
After spending three months
this summer in China, North
Korea, and North Vietnam,
Scheer is convinced that people
have more real freedom and
democracy in Asian communist
countries than in America.
Contrary to U.S. propaganda, no
one in these countries is starving
or living in squalor. North Korea,
which was totally leveled by the
Americans less than twenty years
ago, and China have been highly
successful in achieving their plans
for economic development.
The real threat to the U.S.
from Asian revolutions and Asian
communism is not directed at our
freedoms or to our national
security but rather to American
political and economic control of
Third World destiny. The threat

grows daily that U.S. corporations
will lose the privileged access to
raw materials, markets, and
profitable investments which they
acquired from the crumbling
European colonial empires. And if
Nixon was willing to advocate in
1954 the use of nuclear weapons
to maintain French colonialism in
Asia, one shudders to think of the
extent to which he will go to
maintain the American empire.
Boredom with the war is
possible if people fail to recognize
Vietnam as the most serious
international showdown of our

time. Nixon understands this. He's
counting on our ignorance,
apathy, or despair, hoping that we
won't recognize until it's all over
that Laos, Cambodia, and
Vietnam are being exterminated.
'Vote For Peace'
Unless we act now, the
annihilation which was put into
full gear last year, will have been
completed long before our next
chance to "vote for peace." We
are going to have to accept the
fact that liberal forms of protest,
McCarthy campaigns and
Moratoriums, simply are not going
to work. Demonstrating moral
outrage is good for our guilty
consciences, but will not stop the
destruction in Asia. We have
kindly asked the war machine to
stop the genocide. Instead it
escalates. We are going to have
to start thinking in tactical terms,
to understand how we can best
cripple it.
As individuals we are
powerless. Only as communities
we do have power. The
community must say that it can
no longer accept the hypocrisy,
the lies, and the violence of the
government. We can no longer
accept manipulation in the name
of goodwill, genocide in the name
of democracy, invasions and
bombing in the name of peace.
The War is being fought in the

Nixon's strategy in Asia, billed
as The Nixon Doctrine, becomes
clearer every day. Troop
withdrawals are coupled with
massive intensification of the
bombing and technological
warfare. Japanese militarism is
being revived to share the future
burden of repressing Asian
insurgencies.
The kind of peace Nixon seeks
in Vietnam, he admitted frankly
last week, is the kind that will
"discourage" or "deter" future
wars of aggression against
U.S. -supported governments-a
Pax Americana for the Third
World. As he said last year
regarding the National Liberation
Front: "We have to demonstrate. .
. that confrontation with the
United States is costly and
unrewarding." In the words of
Jean Paul Sartre, "those whom
the United States wished to
intimidate and terrorize via the
Vietnamese people are the human
group in its entirety."
Falling Dominoes
The falling dominoes are
foremost on Nixon's mind.
Behind the wave of revolution in
the underdeveloped world lies the
indisputable success of socialism
in China, North Korea, and North
Vietnam. If America and free
enterprise are kicked out of
Indochina, where will it end? In
1965, in a letter to the New York
Times Nixon said: "Victory for
the Viet Cong. . . would mean
ultimately the destruction of
freedom of speech for all men for
all time not only in Asia but in
the United States as well."
Nixon can make a statement
like that because the American
public is almost totally ignorant
about Asian communism. We've
been told for the last 2 0 years
that billions of dollars and
millions of lives were being spent
to defend the world from a fate
worse than death—communism.

And while we chum around with
the "communists" in the Soviet
Union, we are waging the most
massive war in history against a
peasant movement for
communism in tiny Vietnam.
A revived anti-war movement
has to confront anti-communism
head on. One anti-war leader who
for several years has been writing
and speaking on anti-communism
and U.S. foreign policy is Robert
Scheer, former editor of Ramparts
and Peace and Freedom Party
candidate for U.S. Senator. Scheer
will be one of the speakers at the
first hearing of Stanford's War
Crimes Commission this Sunday
night, 7:30 at Dinkelspiel.
Asia And America
After spending three months
this summer in China, North
Korea, and North Vietnam,
Scheer is convinced that people
have more real freedom and
democracy in Asian communist
countries than in America.
Contrary to U.S. propaganda, no
one in these countries is starving
or living in squalor. North Korea,
which was totally leveled by the
Americans less than twenty years
ago, and China have been highly
successful in achieving their plans
for economic development.
The real threat to the U.S.
from Asian revolutions and Asian
communism is not directed at our
freedoms or to our national
security but rather to American
political and economic control of
Third World destiny. The threat

grows daily that U.S. corporations
will lose the privileged access to
raw materials, markets, and
profitable investments which they
acquired from the crumbling
European colonial empires. And if
Nixon was willing to advocate in
1954 the use of nuclear weapons
to maintain French colonialism in
Asia, one shudders to think of the
extent to which he will go to
maintain the American empire.
Boredom with the war is
possible if people fail to recognize
Vietnam as the most serious
international showdown of our

time. Nixon understands this. He's
counting on our ignorance,
apathy, or despair, hoping that we
won't recognize until it's all over
that Laos, Cambodia, and
Vietnam are being exterminated.
'Vote For Peace'
Unless we act now, the
annihilation which was put into
full gear last year, will have been
completed long before our next
chance to "vote for peace." We
are going to have to accept the
fact that liberal forms of protest,
McCarthy campaigns and
Moratoriums, simply are not going
to work. Demonstrating moral
outrage is good for our guilty
consciences, but will not stop the
destruction in Asia. We have
kindly asked the war machine to
stop the genocide. Instead it
escalates. We are going to have
to start thinking in tactical terms,
to understand how we can best
cripple it.
As individuals we are
powerless. Only as communities
we do have power. The
community must say that it can
no longer accept the hypocrisy,
the lies, and the violence of the
government. We can no longer
accept manipulation in the name
of goodwill, genocide in the name
of democracy, invasions and
bombing in the name of peace.
The War is being fought in the
name of the American people We
as a community of American
people have to say No—this is not
our name. Neither our name, nor
any resources from our
community must go toward the

coercion, manipulation,
intervention or destruction of
U.S. foreign policy. And as long as
it continues these polities, the
United States government must
not be allowed in our community.
We must begin to resist, together.
Crimes commission
The Stanford War Crimes
Commission that has been set up
this week by the New Left Project
is a call to the Stanford-Peninsula
community to join together to
investigate any and all activities in
this area—research, training, or
production—which are part of or

in complicity with the United
States' genocidal foreign policy.
The Commission thus far has
only set up the first hearing of its
investigation, presenting testimony
from Robert Scheer and Andy
Truskier. Much of their
testimony—GENOClDE IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND ASIAN
COMMUNISM—wiII be from
information gathered from their
tour of North Korea, North
Vietnam, and China. Earl Martin
will give a personal account of the
U.S. genocidal policy, based on 3
years of experience in a South
Vietnamese province.
Besides laying a background of

katherine barkley

what communism and
anti-communism in Southeast
Asia is about, we will also takk
about the role that universities are
playing in complicity with the
war, and how interested people
can get together to do
investigations and hold further
hearings on the war crimes being
perpetrated in our midst.
Please come. Let's blow our
minds out of any apathy and
boredom they might have been
falling into.

the New Left Project, is co-editor
