# Coffin To Give Sermon Here Sunday
## 
### 
The Reverend William Sloane
Coffin Jr., university chaplain and
pastor of the Church of Christ at
Yale University, will deliver the
sermon at the 11 a.m. public
worship at Memorial Church this
Sunday.
Dr. Coffin was an Army
intelligence officer and Central
Intelligence Agency officer during
the Korean War.
One of the first clergymen in
the late 1 950's to sponsor church
involvement in social and political
issues on a massive scale, the
Reverend Mr. Coffin has
continued to be one of the

foremost advocates and
practitioners of church leaders
taking an active stand on issues of
importance.
From his arrest in 1961 as a
"Freedom Rider" in Montgomery,
Alabama, to his trial with Dr.
Benhamin Spock and others on
anti-draft conspiracy charges in
1968, Coffin has remained active
in social causes. He became
chaplain at Yale after being forced
out of the same post at Williams
College because of his attack on
fraternity discrimination.
Dr. Coffin has been a frequent
visitor to Stanford.


William Sloane Coffin, Jr
