# Plunkett Plucks The Petals
## 
### 
Running on guts and dreams, Stanford's football
team out-slugged Washington, 29-22, Saturday and
won its first conference championship and Rose Bowl
bid in 19 years.
"I think it's going to take us awhile to realize what
happened," said Randy Vataha, who caught the
14-yard, fourth-quarter touchdown pass which
brought Stanford from behind, 2 2-21,
"Well, it's ours, I guess," said a tired Jim Plunkett
when he made it back to the dressing- room. .''l was
fired up and glad to win it." But *We real eNtioo
seemed to be with the students and alumm 4 not the
players.
Plunkett, dispelling rumors that he had a sore arm,
threw long and short, hard and soft, completed four
touchdown passes, had a fifth called back on a
penalty, and with his team down 2 2-21 in the fourth
quarter moved it 67 yards in less than two minutes
for the winning touchdown.
"We weren't gonna let it get away from us this
year," he said. "From the reaction I saw, I reajly
think it's worth it for the school, the alumni and the
students. Everybody, 112
"People around here were hungry for a big win,"
said defensive guard Pete Lazetich. "I knew we'd get
it. Everybody was playing Husky-ball .. . you know,
mushing and mushing. That Rose Bowl, I think that's
gonna be a hell of a thrill. We're looking forward to
those Big-10 boys again."
Coach John Ralston, who brought in his first Pac-8
championship team in his eight years at Stanford,
told his players, "I had a well-prepared speech for just
this occasion, but somewhere it got lost during that
fourth quarter.
"I'm damn proud of all of you. This is a great
bunch of guys who got it. We got what all of us

wanted, but now we have two more goals left. First,
we're going to finish as high as we can in the polls,
hopefully in the top five. And second, we're going to
get old Jim that Jjetatjjan '

One of the happiest players was Ben Barnes,
defensive halfback who Mocked a field goal attempt
and spent the afternoon chasing Sonny Sijckiller's
passes. "I guess everybody has a dream of wantwig to
play for a major college team and making of
the big bowls. Oh wow, if you'd told me a year ago
I'd be in a Rose Bowl game, I'd never have believed
it."
A year ago Bames was ptyjpg with Contra Costa
Junior College.
Fullback Hillary Shockley missed the second half
with stretched knee ligaments. "Here's the game of

the season and I'm limping on the sidelines. That's
the thing that hurt more than anything. But I guess
limping through a whole-half wouldn't have helped
much."
Typical of Stanford, the Tribe built a solid lead,
lost it, then had to scramble back.
"The squad has the ability," Ralston said. "I knew
Nve'd come back if we hung in there long enough "

was shocked but the team," said
br Depiea Washington.
/V tyouiht «t was just a matter of time," added
r'S.nM'r $)b Moore. "We had to make some
and I knew we would put it together."
"Iwas\very, very uptight," said Bill Alexander. "I
—knew we- could come back but then there's the
questiori really can. I could see everything
quiejly driftingUway."
" "WitrPlour minutes left, Plunkett dropped back on

a penalty. If
I "i'*Mlli wanted that one," Vataha said. "I didn't
want through another of those agonizing last
minutes again."
"We've been down a few times before and we've
bounced back," Plunkett said. "They were tough."
And so it went. The Pac-8 championship and the
Rose Bowl were finally Stanford's.
"Right now you're too caught up to enjoy it," Jim
Kauffman said. "For us it's still not really the thrill
it's going to be. To look back on it in five years when
maybe I'll run into somebody like old Laz over
there by coincidence and we'll say, 'Hey, we went to
the Rose Bowl, didn't we?"
"That's when it will be something."
