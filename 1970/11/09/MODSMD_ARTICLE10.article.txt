# Chavez Struggle
## MECHA Leads Lettuce Boycott 
### BOB HUPPE 
MECHA is trying to bring the Black Eagle to
Campus. Bird Watchers? No, MECHA is the
Mexican-American student union and the Black
Eagle is the symbol of the United Farm
Workers of California (UFWOC)and appears on
all boxes of produce picked by them.
For the past several weeks the MECHA
headed by freshman Jaime Enrique has been
coordinating efforts to remove all but UFWOC
picked lettuce from the dormitories, eating
clubs, fraternities, and Tresidder Memorial
Union. This is part of a nation wide lettuce
boycott headed by Cesar Chavez of the
UFWOC.
The present boycott has its roots in the
struggle between the UFWOC, the Teamsters
Union and the lettuce growers of the Salinas
Valley to unionize the lettuce field workers. In
July of this year, as the Delano grape strike
drew to a close, lettuce workers in the Salinas
Valley began to push for UFWOC union
representation.
On July 23 Chavez asked the Salinas growers
association to hold an election to determine
union representation. The same day the growers
indicated to the Teamsters Union that they
were interested in negotiating a contract. Five
days later the growers announced the signing of
a five year contract with Teamsters covering the
field workers.
No Worker Representation
Chavez branded the agreement "a sweetheart
contract" because it had been signed without

consulting the workers. In addition the pact
was significantly weaker than the proposed
UFWOC contract. The base wage in the
Teamsters contract was 15 cents lower than the
UFWOC proposed base. The Teamster pact also
contained a poorer health and welfare plan, and
no provisions for direct grievance procedures,
seniority or union hiring halls.
In order to dramatize their position the
UFWOC organized a number of marches and
local strikes in early August. By August 11,
pressure had grown so much that the Teamsters
agreed to release any growers who wished to be
released from their contracts. In return the
UFWOC called for a 10 day moratorium. This
was to allow the growers to bargain in good
faith with the UFWOC.
Two weeks later after the growers had made
no major overtures, the UFWOC began direct
picketing of growers fields. According to
UFWOC estimates two thirds of the lettuce
harvest in the Salinas Valley halted. This
broughtcries from the growers who claimed the
dispute was jurisdictional and the picketing
illegal. The UFWOC claimed it was no longer
jurisdictional since the Teamsters had agreed to
back out.
Some Change
In the early part of September the two
major producers of lettuce in the valley bowed
to pressure from the union and agreed to
negotiate with the UFWOC. The remainder of
the growers have remained reluctant to
negotiate.

The most crushing blow to the UFWOC
I movement came in mid-September when a
> permanent injunction was issued forbiding
112 further picketing at growers fields. Immediately
i Chavez called for a nationwide consumer
I boycott. He pointed out the only remaining
, route was to apply economic pressure to the
growers through the market. Opponents of the
, UFWOC have branded the consumer boycott an
illegal secondary boycott, however the UFWOC
say that they are not covered by the National
Labor Relations Act which outlaws secondary
boycotts. They have, therefore gone ahead with
organizing boycotts in various areas.
In the Palo Alto area the boycott has been
directed against two of the major chain stores
in the area, Lucky and Mayfair. Neither have
agreed to purchase only UFWOC lettuce. The
local UFWOC organizer, Kit Bricca, did,
however, score a major victory in October when
the COOP agreed to buy only UFWOC lettuce.
Political Obstacles
In an interview with the Daily Bricca
indicated the gains thus far in contracts are
encouraging, but not overwhelming. He stated
that many growers seem to be entrenching for a
long fight. In addition Bricca pointed out that
the political climate of the day makes it hard
for pickets to be successful. In fact he fears that
repressive measures may be instituted if any
major incidents occur on a boycott line.
Although nobody is willig to predict the
length of the current boycott, all indications
are that it will certainly run into next year.

say that they are not covered by the National
Labor Relations Act which outlaws secondary
boycotts. They have, therefore gone ahead with
organizing boycotts in various areas.
In the Palo Alto area the boycott has been
directed against two of the major chain stores
in the area, Lucky and Mayfair. Neither have
agreed to purchase only UFWOC lettuce. The
local UFWOC organizer, Kit Bricca, did,
however, score a major victory in October when
the COOP agreed to buy only UFWOC lettuce.
Political Obstacles
In an interview with the Daily Bricca
indicated the gains thus far in contracts are
encouraging, but not overwhelming. He stated
that many growers seem to be entrenching for a
long fight. In addition Bricca pointed out that
the political climate of the day makes it hard
for pickets to be successful. In fact he fears that
repressive measures may be instituted if any
major incidents occur on a boycott line.
Although nobody is willig to predict the
length of the current boycott, all indications
are that it will certainly run into next year.
MECHA is trying to bring the Black Eagle to
Campus. Bird Watchers? No, MECHA is the
Mexican-American student union and the Black
Eagle is the symbol of the United Farm
Workers of California (UFWOC)and appears on
all boxes of produce picked by them.
For the past several weeks the MECHA
headed by freshman Jaime Enrique has been
coordinating efforts to remove all but UFWOC
picked lettuce from the dormitories, eating
clubs, fraternities, and Tresidder Memorial
Union. This is part of a nation wide lettuce
boycott headed by Cesar Chavez of the
UFWOC.
The present boycott has its roots in the
struggle between the UFWOC, the Teamsters
Union and the lettuce growers of the Salinas
Valley to unionize the lettuce field workers. In
July of this year, as the Delano grape strike
drew to a close, lettuce workers in the Salinas
Valley began to push for UFWOC union
representation.
On July 23 Chavez asked the Salinas growers
association to hold an election to determine
union representation. The same day the growers
indicated to the Teamsters Union that they
were interested in negotiating a contract. Five
days later the growers announced the signing of
a five year contract with Teamsters covering the
field workers.
No Worker Representation
Chavez branded the agreement "a sweetheart
contract" because it had been signed without

consulting the workers. In addition the pact
was significantly weaker than the proposed
UFWOC contract. The base wage in the
Teamsters contract was 15 cents lower than the
UFWOC proposed base. The Teamster pact also
contained a poorer health and welfare plan, and
no provisions for direct grievance procedures,
seniority or union hiring halls.
In order to dramatize their position the
UFWOC organized a number of marches and
local strikes in early August. By August 11,
pressure had grown so much that the Teamsters
agreed to release any growers who wished to be
released from their contracts. In return the
UFWOC called for a 10 day moratorium. This
was to allow the growers to bargain in good
faith with the UFWOC.
Two weeks later after the growers had made
no major overtures, the UFWOC began direct
picketing of growers fields. According to
UFWOC estimates two thirds of the lettuce
harvest in the Salinas Valley halted. This
broughtcries from the growers who claimed the
dispute was jurisdictional and the picketing
illegal. The UFWOC claimed it was no longer
jurisdictional since the Teamsters had agreed to
back out.
Some Change
In the early part of September the two
major producers of lettuce in the valley bowed
to pressure from the union and agreed to
negotiate with the UFWOC. The remainder of
the growers have remained reluctant to
negotiate.

The most crushing blow to the UFWOC
I movement came in mid-September when a
> permanent injunction was issued forbiding
112 further picketing at growers fields. Immediately
i Chavez called for a nationwide consumer
I boycott. He pointed out the only remaining
, route was to apply economic pressure to the
growers through the market. Opponents of the
, UFWOC have branded the consumer boycott an
illegal secondary boycott, however the UFWOC
