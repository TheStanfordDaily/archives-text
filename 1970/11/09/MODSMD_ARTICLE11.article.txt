# Roxanne Dunbar Urges Organization Of Greater Mass Bases Of Women
## 
### CHRIS KATZENBACH 
"Women have to enter into
more concrete forms of struggle,"
Roxanne Dunbar told an audience
in Trancos lounge last Thursday
night. She urged that women
move beyond only informing
about and propagandizing around
Women's Liberation, and on to
actually organizing mass bases of
women.
Rozanne Dunbar has been one
of the leading figures in Women's
Liberation for many years. In the
last year she has begun to organize
women in the South, particularly
in New Orleans. She has just
returned from Cuba where she

was a member of the Third
Vinceremos Brigade. She talked
about her experiences in New
Orleans, what she had learned in
Cuba, and the direction of the
Women's Movement.
"My first idea in going to the
South was to organize a mass
group of women on a regional
basis." As she learned more about
the South, Dunbar decided that a
regional organization was not
possible as yet; base work of
organizing women was still greatly
needed. She therefore decided to
relocate in one area, and picked
New Orleans because there was
little of a women's movement
there at all.

Dunbar described New Orleans
as "a major center of
imperialism." New Orleans,
according to Dunbar, is the
second largest State Department
relocation area for Cuban exiles
who spread anti-communism
throughout the region, helped by
the C.I.A. "The C.I.A. gets to ail
the Cuban young people at some
point."
Also in New Orleans is a
government-sponsered center for
population and birth control.
Louisiana and New Orleans were
chosen because the area is "like a
colony". Dunbar said that the
center freely admits this.

Dunbar talked about the
position of women in Cuba. "In
1 960 it was made a top priority to
construct day care centers, and
build literacy and education to
enable women to get into
production." There are still
problems, but now only a
minority of women said (in a
survey) that they did not want to
work in production. There was
still a problem with
machismoâ€”ex treme male
chauvinism.- but that this was
declining. "Women who had never
been to a latin country before
were shocked, but I felt the
situation to be better than in
other countries." The major
problem for Cuba, according to
Dunbar is getting women into
production, "into the revolution".
Since she has been in Cuba,
and met people who had actually
fought in the revolution, she has
become more convinced of the
need for armed struggle in the
United States.
In New Orleans, after several
attempts at other means of
organizing, Dunbar said that "it
became clear that we had to
organize working women first".
Members of her group have gotten
jobs in small factories, in the
phone company, in schools and as
waitresses. "It's not very clear
how we're going to develop a
working women's organization as
yet, but that's what we're aiming
for."
"We saw the only way for
women to be tree was the
overthrow of the private property
system big business, that whole
system because women were a
part of private property." Dunbar
emphasized that Women's
Liberation involved defeating U.S.
imperialsim. "It's not just
America and a way of thinking,
it's a whole world. You can't
change this thing by changing
people's minds, you change their
material conditions."
