# A 						Lawyer's Look At Legalization
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Christmas and the legalization
of marijuana are celebrations
many students visualize with
anxious anticipation. And, if Law
Professor John Kaplan's recent
book, Marijuana: The New
Prohibition appears under enough
Establishment Christmas trees this
winter, chances are the ghost of
Christmas future will be smoking
a joint.
From the dedication page, an
establishment-soothing phrase
reading simply, "To Dad, for
everything," throughout the
minutely detailed, businessman's
approach to marijuana, Kaplan
appeals the concern over loss of
authority, Law and Order, and
increasing hostility between
young and old.
Kaplan makes no arguments
about the benefits of smoking
marijuana. Instead, he goes to
great lengths to discuss the costs
of illegally smoked marijuana
versus legalized grass.
The use of marijuana among
students and young people of all

kinds is so widespread, Kaplan
argues, that criminalization tor
possession of marijuana can no
longer be an effective tool in
dealing with the control of the
problem.
Student Use
On campus here, in the three
years between 1 966 and 1 969,
marijuana use tripled. In 1 966,2 1
per cent of the student body used
grass, and by 1968 the figure had
risen to 6 9 per cent. These figures
didn't reflect any special
permissiveness of the school,
Kaplan notes. "Stanford was not
an especially high drug using
school. It was right in the middle
of those schools tested."
Next, Kaplan's book tries to
describe the effects of marijuana
use for an average user. He writes,
"the ordinary effects of marijuana
as described here will be fairly
harmless."
Here is where the book is
perhaps the weakest in its
presentation. The insertion of a
joint instead of the thirty page
discussion of marijuana's
"ordinary effects" would help
establishment non-smokers
understand the effects better, but
short of that Kaplan has done an
adequate job.
Pot Effects
Everything from "thinking
more deeply" to "becoming
erotically aroused" are discussed

as effects of the drug. Hut Kaplan
concludes, "In measuring the
subjective effects of marijuana we
run into a host of problems...the
mechanism of marijuana's effect is
by no means clearly understood."
Kaplan's greatest efforts have
gone into the chapters dealing
with the possible harmful effects
of smoking marijuana. Citing the
three most common arguments
used against legalization, the book
deals the death blow to the
biggest and most commonly used
objections to the legalization of
grass.
"Historically," Kaplan writes,
"The most significant argument
for the prohibition of marijuana
has been that the drug causes its
users to commit violent crimes."
The Bureau of Narcotics has
fabricated every instance of
so-called marijuana crimes, Kaplan
states, and examples of such
fallacious cases provide some
fascinating reading in the chapter
entitled, "Marijuana and
Aggression."
One such case cited the case of
a man in Columbus, Ohio. "A
35-year-old man was sentenced to
the electric chair for robbery and
first degree murder of a hotel
clerk. His plea of not guilty was
based on insanity due to smoking
marijuana cigarettes and the fact
that he was under the influence of
marijuana when the crime was

committed." Since the man was
executed such a defense didn't
seem to be too effective, even in
1 936, but dope-crazed killers still
fill the minds of a sizable part of
today's non-smokers, Kaplan
concludes.
No less than six scientific
reports are discussed by Kaplan in
this chapter and he proves that in
fact, marijuana inhibits rather
than increases aggression. Kaplan
claims "the widespread use in our
society of drugs such as alcohol
and barbituates, which undeniably
do increase aggression, shows
further that the argument that
marijuana causes aggression is not
a supportable reason for the
criminalization of this drug."
The most widely-held fears
about marijuana, namely that it
leads to more harmful drugs, even
heroin, is the most impressive part
of Kaplan's book. Citing studies
of heroin addiction, studies of
hippie communes, and student use
of marijuana and heroin, Kaplan
writes, "there appears to be no
association between marijuana
and heroin throughout most of
our societyâ€”except among poor
urban Negroes and
Spanish-speaking Americans who
in fact make up the predominant
part of the heroin addiction."
Harder Stuff:
A more serious argument that
Kaplan discusses is the possible

relationship of how present
marijuana laws lead marijuana
smokers to harder drugs.
"The criminalization of
marijuana may precipitate use of
other drugs...by bringing the
marijuana user into contact with
drug sellers who tend to be more
involved in the drug culture and
to be a source for dangerous drugs
as well....the criminalization also
tends to discredit drug-education
efforts. Moreover, the
criminalization of marijuana
dilutes the threat of a criminal
sanction in the drug-use area."
After reading Kaplan's
exhaustively complete refutations
of the present marijuana laws and
social biases, one is amazed at the
effects a little bag of grass has on
the non-smoking population of
the United States.
No Longer Excusable
The widespread
misconceptions about marijuana
that any literate person has are no
longer excusable. Marijuana: The
New Prohibition proves all of
these to be either entirely false or
grossly exaggerated.
If the book is to be successful
as a first step in the legalization
battle, the non-smoking,
anti-marijuana faction of
American must read it. If you
know anybody who falls into that
category, Christmas spirit might
prompt you to buy the book.
