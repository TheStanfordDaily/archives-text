# The 						Committee Ain't So Good No More
## 
### NEIL ARNET 
Last Friday The Committee presented its first all-new show for the
current Committee company. The Committee, for those who may be
unfamiliar with the name, is an improvisational group which originally
opened April 12, 1 963. Basically, it was the vanguard of
improvisational theatre, after which copies were patterned in Boston,
Chicago and other large cities. Billed as a "satirical revue" The
Committee became a tremendous success, appearing frequently on
television and even making a movie of their show entitled, "An
Evening With The Committee." They were refreshing and alive.
Now, however, something is lacking in their performance, partially
freshness and partially biting satire. Indeed they do much less political
satire now than when they started. The Committee, as it is currently
organized, does a set 9:00 show composed of sketches which have
grown out of improvisations performed in 11:00 shows during
previous runs of their company.
The new show which is titled "Babylonian Follies" is only
sporadically funny. Some bits are extremely humorous, satirical, even
brilliant, while others should have been left out altogether. I think
that even a year ago this inconsistency in the level of the show wasn't
present in the work of The Committee.
"Babylonian Follies," well, that's a title that's supposed to suggest
extreme wealth, luxury, and most of all wickedness, which, in turn, of
course suggests the United States. The audience thus prepares itself
for an evening of satire about the people and things in this great
country. The entire company (seven) of The Committee comes on for
the first of eight scenes in the first act, and it's a funny bit. The switch
to the second scene comes quickly and Dan Barrows and Julie Payne
make this also into a humorous sketch. "Ah," the audience sighs in
relief, "The Committee is as good as ever."
Committee Illusions
And, all of a sudden, the illusion is broken with the third scene
called "Jesus on Broadway," a take-off of the "Jesus-fanatics" who
hang around the Condor (a famous topless-bottomless place located a

halt' block from The Committee Theatre). One problem was that the
idea of the scene just didn't make it. The other and larger problem
was that Gary Austin didn't impress me at all as the preacher who was
showing the way.
To compound problems the next scene has two of the "Condor
Girls" sing a song. I could have lived without hearing "Walkin'down
the Street." The remaining four scenes of Act One returned to a
better level of humor and satire. In particular, the last scene entitled
"Presenting the President" was very good. It featured Don Sturdy
(who is always good) and Jim Cranna in a bit somewhat reminiscent
of Bob Newhart telling Abe Lincoln how to write the Gettysburg
Address.
Unfortunately, the eight scenes of Act Two do not continue with
the high level at which Act One ended. I really feel only a few of the
bits are even worth remembering, whether it be for their satire or
originality. The opening scene with Don Sturdy and Ruth Silviera as
two people who haven't seen each other for fifteen year has several
funny lines. And the second scene does some good things with a
take-off of "As the World Turns." but the rest of the scenes ranged
from mediocre to poor, although, of course, there were occasionally
clever comments.
I was particularly irked by the return to the Condor. Gary Austin
seemed only to get worse as the preacherâ€”it was a bum part for him
to have to play. The singing girls in the background of the Condor
didn't get any better either. This scene too should be eliminated.
For those who would still like to see The Committee, I'd like to
pass along a suggestion. The Friday and Saturday night shows (two on
Friday and three on Saturday) are strictly the "set"shows with the
two acts of eight scenes eahc. Your best bet would be either to see the
9:00 show on one of the other nights and stay for the 11:00 show
which is all improvisational, or simply to view the 11 :00 show by
itself. The Committee was founded on improvisation, and, evidently,
it's still the best part of their show. The Committee is located at 62 2
Broadway, San Francisco.
