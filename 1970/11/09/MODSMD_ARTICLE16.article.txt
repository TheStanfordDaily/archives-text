# S.F. Opera Hits Depths And Heights
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The S.F. Opera is currently taking opera-goers alternately from the
depths of human degradation (with Strauss's "Salome") to the heights
of humane folly (with Mozart's "Cosi fan tutte"). And, as seems
typical for the company, it seems better able to attack human foibles
with zest than to isolate the human condition with tragic magnitude.
Thus, "Cosi" is an inmitigated success, and "Salome" left in its path a
wake of reservations and minor disgusts.
Strauss's grim one-act opera seemed like a monstrous bit of dcja
vu since the production was unveiled here only two years ago. Anja
Silja (in the title role) and five others returned from 1968. Silja's
return can only be explained by her almost unique ability (among
sopranos) to fill a pair of low-cut black tights with something
approaching erotic pleasure. Her voice, on the other hand, had a
tenuous and tremulous time of it in the higher range. In the end,
Silja's stage presence did not make up for what was vocally absent. To
paraphrase Shaw, the charms of beauty and refinement without
vocalism may be undeniable, but they pall.
Ragnar Ulfung made the coup of the evening as the gross,
flat-witted Herod. His bloodless, compressed tenor was expressive and
powerful, and his intelligent acting beggared everyone else on stage.
Herd Nienstedl made a non-impressive debut as Jochanaan, his voice
not having the rock-of-ages timbre which the voice of the Baptist
should display.
The supporting cast sang well, with Glade Peterson, as Salome's
distraught suitor, and Sona Cervena, as Herod's wife, standing out
with resonant voices.
Dramatic Moments
Conductor Bohumil Gregor led a more reticent and polished
orchestra than one expects for "Salome." His tempos and conception
utterly lacked excess, which in most operas would be to his credit.
Here, however, extravagance might have ignited many dramatic
moments which were otherwise damped by inept stage direction.
The slinky cliches of gesture which announce moral decay in neon
terms, the virtually total botch of the Narraboth side-plot, the
ultimately dull Dance of the Seven Veils (amateur night at a strip
joint), and numerous minutiae of silliness-all these sapped the opera's
power.
The most fitting recourse to describe Ebermann's achievement is
Oscar Wilde, whose play is the basis of the opera: "It is awfully hard
work doing nothing. However, 1 don't mind hard work where there is
no definite object of any kind." Many aspects of this "Salome" had
no apparent object.

The new staging of Mozart's "Cose fan tutte," so unlike "Salome,"
had a unity of coneption and execution rarely met in the Opera
HOuse. This "Cosi" is the kind of production that rewards the
connoisseur for many dreary evenings of merely mediocre singing or
bumble-brained staging, the kind of production that should ignite the
most stubbornly incombustible alien to opera.
First praise is due to what can fairly be called the genius of
Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's stage design and stage direction. In his eye for
style he is unerringly "true;" in his creativeness he exiles cliches
forever, or more delectably, ridicules them; in his musicality he
achieves a positive and vitalizing inter-penetration of visual and
musical style.
Space does not permit a catalogue aria numbering instances of
Ponnelle's witty innovation; suffice it to note that this "Cosi" has
some of the most successful scenic ideas, most sumptuous costumery,
and wittiest choral stage direction S. F. has seen in many years.
Top-Rate Mozart
"Cosi" also provided the most consistently top-rate Mozart to be
heard here in a long time. The cast was led by Margaret Price, who has
not yet failed to impress. Though Price's figure reminds one of Mama
Cass Eliot, her voice has all the vivacity and youthfulness to create a
pleasant Fiordiligi. As well, her voice possesses all the pre-requisites
for Mozartean excellence: unfailing purity of tone, agility within a
generous range, and the ability to think in--and create—phrases that
make musical sense.
Rosalind Elias, replacing ailing Teresa Berganza, made a belated
S.F. debut as Dorabella. Though Elias' vocal sun is beginning to set,
she sang judiciously and accurately. Under Ponnelle's direction
Graziella Scuitti's Despina took on a slightly slatternly cast. Sciutti
acted tha part to the limit (including a hilarious tongue-wagging trill),
and her incarnations as a quack and a notary were full of mirth.
The parts of the two haughty men were sung by two fine debut
artists: Ryland Davies' tenor has a nice Mozartean flavor which is
light, uncluttered, and supple. Though Alberto Rinaldi is Italian, he
does not have the usual thick, Italianate baritone--which to my taste
is to the better for Guglielmo's role.
Finally, there is Renato Capecchi's portrayal of the cynical
master-of-ceremonies Don Alfonso. Both dramatically and musically
Capecchi came across as the "brains" behind the opera's silly plot. His
comic finesse is by now almost legendary. If three other people are on
stage, the odds are about even he will steal the scene. He seems even
to stand still with animation.
John Pritchard's tempos remained in the middle of the road,
inclining now and then to err on the side of haste.

typical for the company, it seems better able to attack human foibles
with zest than to isolate the human condition with tragic magnitude.
Thus, "Cosi" is an inmitigated success, and "Salome" left in its path a
wake of reservations and minor disgusts.
Strauss's grim one-act opera seemed like a monstrous bit of dcja
vu since the production was unveiled here only two years ago. Anja
Silja (in the title role) and five others returned from 1968. Silja's
return can only be explained by her almost unique ability (among
sopranos) to fill a pair of low-cut black tights with something
approaching erotic pleasure. Her voice, on the other hand, had a
tenuous and tremulous time of it in the higher range. In the end,
Silja's stage presence did not make up for what was vocally absent. To
paraphrase Shaw, the charms of beauty and refinement without
vocalism may be undeniable, but they pall.
Ragnar Ulfung made the coup of the evening as the gross,
flat-witted Herod. His bloodless, compressed tenor was expressive and
powerful, and his intelligent acting beggared everyone else on stage.
Herd Nienstedl made a non-impressive debut as Jochanaan, his voice
not having the rock-of-ages timbre which the voice of the Baptist
should display.
The supporting cast sang well, with Glade Peterson, as Salome's
distraught suitor, and Sona Cervena, as Herod's wife, standing out
with resonant voices.
Dramatic Moments
Conductor Bohumil Gregor led a more reticent and polished
orchestra than one expects for "Salome." His tempos and conception
utterly lacked excess, which in most operas would be to his credit.
Here, however, extravagance might have ignited many dramatic
moments which were otherwise damped by inept stage direction.
The slinky cliches of gesture which announce moral decay in neon
terms, the virtually total botch of the Narraboth side-plot, the
ultimately dull Dance of the Seven Veils (amateur night at a strip
joint), and numerous minutiae of silliness-all these sapped the opera's
power.
The most fitting recourse to describe Ebermann's achievement is
Oscar Wilde, whose play is the basis of the opera: "It is awfully hard
work doing nothing. However, 1 don't mind hard work where there is
no definite object of any kind." Many aspects of this "Salome" had
no apparent object.

The new staging of Mozart's "Cose fan tutte," so unlike "Salome,"
had a unity of coneption and execution rarely met in the Opera
HOuse. This "Cosi" is the kind of production that rewards the
connoisseur for many dreary evenings of merely mediocre singing or
bumble-brained staging, the kind of production that should ignite the
most stubbornly incombustible alien to opera.
First praise is due to what can fairly be called the genius of
Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's stage design and stage direction. In his eye for
style he is unerringly "true;" in his creativeness he exiles cliches
forever, or more delectably, ridicules them; in his musicality he
achieves a positive and vitalizing inter-penetration of visual and
musical style.
Space does not permit a catalogue aria numbering instances of
Ponnelle's witty innovation; suffice it to note that this "Cosi" has
some of the most successful scenic ideas, most sumptuous costumery,
and wittiest choral stage direction S. F. has seen in many years.
Top-Rate Mozart
"Cosi" also provided the most consistently top-rate Mozart to be
heard here in a long time. The cast was led by Margaret Price, who has
not yet failed to impress. Though Price's figure reminds one of Mama
Cass Eliot, her voice has all the vivacity and youthfulness to create a
pleasant Fiordiligi. As well, her voice possesses all the pre-requisites
for Mozartean excellence: unfailing purity of tone, agility within a
generous range, and the ability to think in--and create—phrases that
make musical sense.
Rosalind Elias, replacing ailing Teresa Berganza, made a belated
S.F. debut as Dorabella. Though Elias' vocal sun is beginning to set,
she sang judiciously and accurately. Under Ponnelle's direction
Graziella Scuitti's Despina took on a slightly slatternly cast. Sciutti
acted tha part to the limit (including a hilarious tongue-wagging trill),
and her incarnations as a quack and a notary were full of mirth.
The parts of the two haughty men were sung by two fine debut
artists: Ryland Davies' tenor has a nice Mozartean flavor which is
light, uncluttered, and supple. Though Alberto Rinaldi is Italian, he
does not have the usual thick, Italianate baritone--which to my taste
is to the better for Guglielmo's role.
Finally, there is Renato Capecchi's portrayal of the cynical
master-of-ceremonies Don Alfonso. Both dramatically and musically
Capecchi came across as the "brains" behind the opera's silly plot. His
comic finesse is by now almost legendary. If three other people are on
stage, the odds are about even he will steal the scene. He seems even
to stand still with animation.
John Pritchard's tempos remained in the middle of the road,
inclining now and then to err on the side of haste.

Thus, "Cosi" is an inmitigated success, and "Salome" left in its path a
wake of reservations and minor disgusts.
Strauss's grim one-act opera seemed like a monstrous bit of dcja
vu since the production was unveiled here only two years ago. Anja
Silja (in the title role) and five others returned from 1968. Silja's
return can only be explained by her almost unique ability (among
sopranos) to fill a pair of low-cut black tights with something
approaching erotic pleasure. Her voice, on the other hand, had a
tenuous and tremulous time of it in the higher range. In the end,
Silja's stage presence did not make up for what was vocally absent. To
paraphrase Shaw, the charms of beauty and refinement without
vocalism may be undeniable, but they pall.
Ragnar Ulfung made the coup of the evening as the gross,
flat-witted Herod. His bloodless, compressed tenor was expressive and
powerful, and his intelligent acting beggared everyone else on stage.
Herd Nienstedl made a non-impressive debut as Jochanaan, his voice
not having the rock-of-ages timbre which the voice of the Baptist
should display.
The supporting cast sang well, with Glade Peterson, as Salome's
distraught suitor, and Sona Cervena, as Herod's wife, standing out
with resonant voices.
Dramatic Moments
Conductor Bohumil Gregor led a more reticent and polished
orchestra than one expects for "Salome." His tempos and conception
utterly lacked excess, which in most operas would be to his credit.
Here, however, extravagance might have ignited many dramatic
moments which were otherwise damped by inept stage direction.
The slinky cliches of gesture which announce moral decay in neon
terms, the virtually total botch of the Narraboth side-plot, the
ultimately dull Dance of the Seven Veils (amateur night at a strip
joint), and numerous minutiae of silliness-all these sapped the opera's
power.
The most fitting recourse to describe Ebermann's achievement is
Oscar Wilde, whose play is the basis of the opera: "It is awfully hard
work doing nothing. However, 1 don't mind hard work where there is
no definite object of any kind." Many aspects of this "Salome" had
no apparent object.

The new staging of Mozart's "Cose fan tutte," so unlike "Salome,"
had a unity of coneption and execution rarely met in the Opera
HOuse. This "Cosi" is the kind of production that rewards the
connoisseur for many dreary evenings of merely mediocre singing or
bumble-brained staging, the kind of production that should ignite the
most stubbornly incombustible alien to opera.
First praise is due to what can fairly be called the genius of
Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's stage design and stage direction. In his eye for
style he is unerringly "true;" in his creativeness he exiles cliches
forever, or more delectably, ridicules them; in his musicality he
achieves a positive and vitalizing inter-penetration of visual and
musical style.
Space does not permit a catalogue aria numbering instances of
Ponnelle's witty innovation; suffice it to note that this "Cosi" has
some of the most successful scenic ideas, most sumptuous costumery,
and wittiest choral stage direction S. F. has seen in many years.
Top-Rate Mozart
"Cosi" also provided the most consistently top-rate Mozart to be
heard here in a long time. The cast was led by Margaret Price, who has
not yet failed to impress. Though Price's figure reminds one of Mama
Cass Eliot, her voice has all the vivacity and youthfulness to create a
pleasant Fiordiligi. As well, her voice possesses all the pre-requisites
for Mozartean excellence: unfailing purity of tone, agility within a
generous range, and the ability to think in--and create—phrases that
make musical sense.
Rosalind Elias, replacing ailing Teresa Berganza, made a belated
S.F. debut as Dorabella. Though Elias' vocal sun is beginning to set,
she sang judiciously and accurately. Under Ponnelle's direction
Graziella Scuitti's Despina took on a slightly slatternly cast. Sciutti
acted tha part to the limit (including a hilarious tongue-wagging trill),
and her incarnations as a quack and a notary were full of mirth.
The parts of the two haughty men were sung by two fine debut
artists: Ryland Davies' tenor has a nice Mozartean flavor which is
light, uncluttered, and supple. Though Alberto Rinaldi is Italian, he
does not have the usual thick, Italianate baritone--which to my taste
is to the better for Guglielmo's role.
Finally, there is Renato Capecchi's portrayal of the cynical
master-of-ceremonies Don Alfonso. Both dramatically and musically
Capecchi came across as the "brains" behind the opera's silly plot. His
comic finesse is by now almost legendary. If three other people are on
stage, the odds are about even he will steal the scene. He seems even
to stand still with animation.
John Pritchard's tempos remained in the middle of the road,
inclining now and then to err on the side of haste.
The S.F. Opera is currently taking opera-goers alternately from the
depths of human degradation (with Strauss's "Salome") to the heights
of humane folly (with Mozart's "Cosi fan tutte"). And, as seems
typical for the company, it seems better able to attack human foibles
with zest than to isolate the human condition with tragic magnitude.
