# No Need For Excuses Now
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
John Ralston could finally sit
down and admit his team had
made it. It had taken twice as long
as he predicted when he came
here eight years ago, but who
really cared. After almost twenty
years of frustration and close
calls, Stanford had finally made it
to the Rose Bowl.
Ralston talked about the other
two of his three 1970 goals yet to
be achieved, a high national
ranking and a Heisman trophy for
his quarterback. But somehow
they seemed as if they could only
be anticlimaxes after having
reached the biggest goal, a Pac-8
championship.
Like any head coach, he
heaped laurels on everyone- the
team, the assistant coaches, the
athletic department, and on and
on. It was a predictable speech,
but don't think Ralston had much
time to work on it during the
game. Washington made sure of
that.
The Return
Chris Schenkle had barely
introduced the two teams to a
nationwide television audience
when flanker Jim Krieg took
Steve Horowitz's opening kickoff

on his five yard line and ended up
13 seconds later in the Stanford
end zone.
The left side of Stanford's kick
coverage had gotten sucked inside
and with a couple of good blocks
Krieg was able to turn the corner
and go all the way down the left
sideline. It wasn't a picture
perfect run, but the points were
on the board.
As if nothing had ever
happened, Jim Plunkett took his
Stanford offense straight down
the field three consecutive times
within 11 minutes. Perfectly
mixing a total of 17 plays,
Plunkett led his offense to 91
passing yards, 5 5 ground yards
and three touchdowns, caught by
Jackie Brown, Jack Lasater and
Bob Moore.
Some people probably thought
that they could relax with this 1 4
point lead. After the first TD,
Washington hadn't been able to
generate much offense and
Stanford's performance didn't
speak too well for their defense
either.
But any rosy thoughts people
had didn't last long. When the
Huskies got the ball again, starting
quarterback Greg Collins

remained on the bench. And yes,
the new quarterback was 11011
other than Sonny Sixkiller, the
Cherokee legend of the
Northwest.
Showing more confidence than
most sophomore quarterbacks in
front of a national TV audience,
Sixkiller quickly directed
Washington to their second TD.
He had to impress anyone
watching when he passed for the
touchdown on a fourth and goal
from the one yard line.
A Shift
A scoring onslaught seemed to
be developing but in a sudden
turnabout the defenses took
control. The ball changed hands
no fewer than fifteen times
through the rest of the second and
most of the third quarter without
any change in the 21-14 score.
Finally on the first play after a
blocked Washington field goal
attempt, Jackie Brown fumbled
and the Huskies took over on the
Stanford 14 yard line. Sixkiller
quickly ran for one yard and
passed for four, but he ended up
with another crucial 4 th down
and 5 at the Stanford nine.
He wanted to pass but was
forced out of the picket. Rolling
to the left he made a good cut

inside and went in for the
touchdown. A great diving catch
by Ace Bulger gave Washington a
two point conversion and a 22-21
lead, with less than two minutes
to go in the third period.
Time rolled on in the 4 th
quarter as a lot of Stanford fans
watched a bit nervously. But
Plunkett hadn't been stopped in
the clutch before this season and
he wasn't about to let it happen
now.
Starting from his own 33, he
took the Indians down the field in
six plays, ending the drive oil a 15
yard TD pass to Randy Vataha.
Plunkett passed to Brown for the
two point conversion and
Stanford led, 2 9-22.
In the later moments of the
game, Sixkiller got the ball down
to the Stanford 28, but the
defense stiffened, as it had all
year, when it was a crucial
situation. The Indians held on this
occasion and Washington's final
desperate drive in the last two
minutes.
Plunkett ended up the day
completing 2 2 of 36 passes for
268 yards and four touchdowns,
plus another scoring pass that was
called back. The 268 yards gave

him a career total of 7,082 yards
passing, another new NCAA mark.
Sixkiller hit on 18 of 41 for 158
yards and one touchdown.
Sixkiller was expectedly
disappointed in the loss, but
praised the Stanford defense.
"You hear a lot about their
offense and Plunkett, but you
have to give their defense credit,"
he said. "The Stanford (defensive)
secondary was not as tight as
Oregon's, but their rush was a
good as Michigan's—the best we've
faced this year."
Flu Bugs Him
Bedded by the flu during the
week, Sixkiller remarked he felt
weakened by his layoff. But it
wasn't apparent on the field.
Stanford's fine redshirting
quarterback, Don Bunce, called
Sixkiller "just great," but
everyone refused any comparison
between the sophomore Huskie
and the Jim Plunkett of two years
ago.
Ralston had praise for both
quarterbacks. He complemented
Sixkiller for his great scrambling
and his ability to recover
successfully on broken plays. But
the day and the season belonged
to Plunkett and his Indians.

picked off three Husky
passes—one each by Jack Schultz,
Charles McCloud and Ron
Kadziel. Sixkiller completed 18 of
41 passes while Jim Plunkett hit
2 2 of 36, including six of his first
seven.

John Ralston could finally sit
down and admit his team had
made it. It had taken twice as long
as he predicted when he came
here eight years ago, but who
really cared. After almost twenty
years of frustration and close
calls, Stanford had finally made it
to the Rose Bowl.
Ralston talked about the other
two of his three 1970 goals yet to
be achieved, a high national
ranking and a Heisman trophy for
his quarterback. But somehow
they seemed as if they could only
be anticlimaxes after having
reached the biggest goal, a Pac-8
championship.
Like any head coach, he
heaped laurels on everyone- the
team, the assistant coaches, the
athletic department, and on and
on. It was a predictable speech,
but don't think Ralston had much
time to work on it during the
game. Washington made sure of
that.
The Return
Chris Schenkle had barely
introduced the two teams to a
nationwide television audience
when flanker Jim Krieg took
Steve Horowitz's opening kickoff

on his five yard line and ended up
13 seconds later in the Stanford
end zone.
The left side of Stanford's kick
coverage had gotten sucked inside
and with a couple of good blocks
Krieg was able to turn the corner
and go all the way down the left
sideline. It wasn't a picture
perfect run, but the points were
on the board.
As if nothing had ever
happened, Jim Plunkett took his
Stanford offense straight down
the field three consecutive times
within 11 minutes. Perfectly
mixing a total of 17 plays,
Plunkett led his offense to 91
passing yards, 5 5 ground yards
and three touchdowns, caught by
Jackie Brown, Jack Lasater and
Bob Moore.
Some people probably thought
that they could relax with this 1 4
point lead. After the first TD,
Washington hadn't been able to
generate much offense and
Stanford's performance didn't
speak too well for their defense
either.
But any rosy thoughts people
had didn't last long. When the
Huskies got the ball again, starting
quarterback Greg Collins

remained on the bench. And yes,
the new quarterback was 11011
other than Sonny Sixkiller, the
Cherokee legend of the
Northwest.
Showing more confidence than
most sophomore quarterbacks in
front of a national TV audience,
Sixkiller quickly directed
Washington to their second TD.
He had to impress anyone
watching when he passed for the
touchdown on a fourth and goal
from the one yard line.
A Shift
A scoring onslaught seemed to
be developing but in a sudden
turnabout the defenses took
control. The ball changed hands
no fewer than fifteen times
through the rest of the second and
most of the third quarter without
any change in the 21-14 score.
Finally on the first play after a
blocked Washington field goal
attempt, Jackie Brown fumbled
and the Huskies took over on the
Stanford 14 yard line. Sixkiller
quickly ran for one yard and
passed for four, but he ended up
with another crucial 4 th down
and 5 at the Stanford nine.
He wanted to pass but was
forced out of the picket. Rolling
to the left he made a good cut

inside and went in for the
touchdown. A great diving catch
by Ace Bulger gave Washington a
two point conversion and a 22-21
lead, with less than two minutes
to go in the third period.
Time rolled on in the 4 th
quarter as a lot of Stanford fans
watched a bit nervously. But
Plunkett hadn't been stopped in
the clutch before this season and
he wasn't about to let it happen
now.
Starting from his own 33, he
took the Indians down the field in
six plays, ending the drive oil a 15
yard TD pass to Randy Vataha.
Plunkett passed to Brown for the
two point conversion and
Stanford led, 2 9-22.
In the later moments of the
game, Sixkiller got the ball down
to the Stanford 28, but the
defense stiffened, as it had all
year, when it was a crucial
situation. The Indians held on this
occasion and Washington's final
desperate drive in the last two
minutes.
Plunkett ended up the day
completing 2 2 of 36 passes for
268 yards and four touchdowns,
plus another scoring pass that was
called back. The 268 yards gave

him a career total of 7,082 yards
passing, another new NCAA mark.
Sixkiller hit on 18 of 41 for 158
yards and one touchdown.
Sixkiller was expectedly
disappointed in the loss, but
praised the Stanford defense.
"You hear a lot about their
offense and Plunkett, but you
have to give their defense credit,"
he said. "The Stanford (defensive)
secondary was not as tight as
Oregon's, but their rush was a
good as Michigan's—the best we've
faced this year."
Flu Bugs Him
Bedded by the flu during the
week, Sixkiller remarked he felt
weakened by his layoff. But it
wasn't apparent on the field.
Stanford's fine redshirting
quarterback, Don Bunce, called
Sixkiller "just great," but
everyone refused any comparison
between the sophomore Huskie
and the Jim Plunkett of two years
ago.
Ralston had praise for both
quarterbacks. He complemented
Sixkiller for his great scrambling
and his ability to recover
successfully on broken plays. But
the day and the season belonged
to Plunkett and his Indians.

between the sophomore Huskie
and the Jim Plunkett of two years
ago.
Ralston had praise for both
quarterbacks. He complemented
Sixkiller for his great scrambling
and his ability to recover
successfully on broken plays. But
the day and the season belonged
to Plunkett and his Indians.

picked off three Husky
passes—one each by Jack Schultz,
Charles McCloud and Ron
Kadziel. Sixkiller completed 18 of
41 passes while Jim Plunkett hit
2 2 of 36, including six of his first
seven.

John Ralston could finally sit
down and admit his team had
made it. It had taken twice as long
as he predicted when he came
here eight years ago, but who
really cared. After almost twenty
years of frustration and close
calls, Stanford had finally made it
to the Rose Bowl.
Ralston talked about the other
two of his three 1970 goals yet to
be achieved, a high national
ranking and a Heisman trophy for
his quarterback. But somehow
they seemed as if they could only
be anticlimaxes after having
reached the biggest goal, a Pac-8
championship.
Like any head coach, he
heaped laurels on everyone- the
team, the assistant coaches, the
athletic department, and on and
on. It was a predictable speech,
but don't think Ralston had much
time to work on it during the
game. Washington made sure of
that.
The Return
Chris Schenkle had barely
introduced the two teams to a
nationwide television audience
when flanker Jim Krieg took
Steve Horowitz's opening kickoff

on his five yard line and ended up
13 seconds later in the Stanford
end zone.
The left side of Stanford's kick
coverage had gotten sucked inside
and with a couple of good blocks
Krieg was able to turn the corner
and go all the way down the left
sideline. It wasn't a picture
perfect run, but the points were
on the board.
As if nothing had ever
happened, Jim Plunkett took his
Stanford offense straight down
the field three consecutive times
within 11 minutes. Perfectly
mixing a total of 17 plays,
Plunkett led his offense to 91
passing yards, 5 5 ground yards
and three touchdowns, caught by
Jackie Brown, Jack Lasater and
Bob Moore.
Some people probably thought
that they could relax with this 1 4
point lead. After the first TD,
Washington hadn't been able to
generate much offense and
Stanford's performance didn't
speak too well for their defense
either.
But any rosy thoughts people
had didn't last long. When the
Huskies got the ball again, starting
quarterback Greg Collins

remained on the bench. And yes,
the new quarterback was 11011
other than Sonny Sixkiller, the
Cherokee legend of the
Northwest.
Showing more confidence than
most sophomore quarterbacks in
front of a national TV audience,
Sixkiller quickly directed
Washington to their second TD.
He had to impress anyone
watching when he passed for the
touchdown on a fourth and goal
from the one yard line.
A Shift
A scoring onslaught seemed to
be developing but in a sudden
turnabout the defenses took
control. The ball changed hands
no fewer than fifteen times
through the rest of the second and
most of the third quarter without
any change in the 21-14 score.
Finally on the first play after a
blocked Washington field goal
attempt, Jackie Brown fumbled
and the Huskies took over on the
Stanford 14 yard line. Sixkiller
quickly ran for one yard and
passed for four, but he ended up
with another crucial 4 th down
and 5 at the Stanford nine.
He wanted to pass but was
forced out of the picket. Rolling
to the left he made a good cut

inside and went in for the
touchdown. A great diving catch
by Ace Bulger gave Washington a
two point conversion and a 22-21
lead, with less than two minutes
to go in the third period.
Time rolled on in the 4 th
quarter as a lot of Stanford fans
watched a bit nervously. But
Plunkett hadn't been stopped in
the clutch before this season and
he wasn't about to let it happen
now.
Starting from his own 33, he
took the Indians down the field in
six plays, ending the drive oil a 15
yard TD pass to Randy Vataha.
Plunkett passed to Brown for the
two point conversion and
Stanford led, 2 9-22.
In the later moments of the
game, Sixkiller got the ball down
to the Stanford 28, but the
defense stiffened, as it had all
year, when it was a crucial
situation. The Indians held on this
occasion and Washington's final
desperate drive in the last two
minutes.
Plunkett ended up the day
completing 2 2 of 36 passes for
268 yards and four touchdowns,
plus another scoring pass that was
called back. The 268 yards gave

him a career total of 7,082 yards
passing, another new NCAA mark.
Sixkiller hit on 18 of 41 for 158
yards and one touchdown.
Sixkiller was expectedly
disappointed in the loss, but
praised the Stanford defense.
"You hear a lot about their
offense and Plunkett, but you
have to give their defense credit,"
he said. "The Stanford (defensive)
secondary was not as tight as
Oregon's, but their rush was a
good as Michigan's—the best we've
faced this year."
Flu Bugs Him
Bedded by the flu during the
week, Sixkiller remarked he felt
weakened by his layoff. But it
wasn't apparent on the field.
Stanford's fine redshirting
quarterback, Don Bunce, called
Sixkiller "just great," but
everyone refused any comparison
between the sophomore Huskie
and the Jim Plunkett of two years
ago.
Ralston had praise for both
quarterbacks. He complemented
Sixkiller for his great scrambling
and his ability to recover
successfully on broken plays. But
