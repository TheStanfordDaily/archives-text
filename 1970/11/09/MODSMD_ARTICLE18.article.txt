## The 						End At Home 
### Fred Leeson 
With his head tilted back slightly and his
nostrils flexing to pull in more air, the quarterback
ran to the sidelines after the interception and
spoke calmly with the coach.
Moments later a trainer came to the bench,
lifted the front of the crimson jersey and
suspended a rectangular, plastic pad from the web
of gear already shrouding the shoulders. Behind,
the chant "Jim Plunkett, Jim Plunkett, Rose Bowl,
Rose Bowl," roared down from the stands.
Jim Plunkett's last game at Stanford had started
magnificently. Six of seven passes were complete,
three for touchdowns. The roses were near.
But now something was wrong. Plunkett tested
the pad on his chest and went back. Four of five
passes in two series skidded on the damp grass
uncaught. The Indians couldn't move the football.
Then Sonny Sixkiller was on the Stanford nine.
"Watch the bootleg, watch the bootleg," John
Ralston yelled to his defense from the sidelines.
Sixkiller scored on a bootleg.
Washington 22, Stanford, 21. Ralston
continued pacing among the scattered cardboard
boxes and the litter of partially-chewed orange
sections.
The sore-chested quarterback went out again.
Stanford's fortunes seemed synchronized with the
increasingly overcast skies. Another interception.
Randy Vataha came up to plunkett, put one foot
on the green, park-like bench and started a
one-sided discussion about pass patterns.
With nine minutes left Stanford had the ball
again. Plunkett was back, this time firing with his
customary acumen. A swing pass to Vataha for 17.
Then Eric Cross' double reverse for 18, another
bulls-eye pass to Bob Moore for 1 7 .

From the Washington 14, Vataha ran a simple
curl pattern to the end zone and Plunkett drilled
in his fourth touchdown pass of the game.
Back on the sidelines, a player hit him playfully
on the chest in congratulations. Plunkett lurched
visibly.
"It's just a thing on my sternum," he said later.
"I had it last year. Somebody got me in the first
half and it came back again. It's not really an
injury, but it is kind of tender, though."
When it was over, he reflected on his last game
at home, the Rose Bowl and the Pac-8 title. "It's a
nice way to end it, I tell you." He went through
his usual post-game routine: compliments for his
teammates and positive comments about the
opposition.
He agreed it was one of the bigger games of his
life, repeated again he was glad he had come back
this year and hadn't turned professional,and said
he would be proud to hold the new national
passing record as long as it was his.
Then he had somebody help him remove that
pad, which had become tangled as he tried to
unfasten it.
His routine, though, wasn't exactly the same.
As the swarm of kids whose surging bodies and
chants of "We want Plunkett, we want Plunkett,"
made the walls of the stadium shack reverberate,
Plunkett slipped out the back way, climbed up the
bank and exited through the practice fields, not
taking the road to the dressing room and not
signing autographs patiently all the way as he had
always done before, win or lose.
Maybe he was tired and maybe he had some
aches. Or maybe he jusl wanted a few minutes to
himself after the lasl one at home.
