Nixon Shot At In San Jose?
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. FBI agents here and in
Washington are pressing an inquiry into an u " ver ' t,e °
report that a shot may have been fired at President
Nixon before his limousine was stoned Oct. 29 in ban
Jose, Calif. , ,
The FBI is focusing on a brief time span during
which Nixon emerged from the hall, stood on the
hood of his car and waved "V" signs with his fingers at
the demonstrators.
Questions asked by FBI men seemed to suggest
they suspect that if a shot was fired at Nixon, e
weapon may have been equipped with a silencer or
was of relatively low caliber and was fired from a
distance. . t
In San Jose, the foreman of the Santa Clara County
grand jury, which is conducting a preliminary
investigation of the violence, said he had not been
advised of the FBI probe and knew nothing about the
possibility of a shot being fired.
The FBI in Washington said earlier that it had been
investigating the attack on the presidential motorcade
for several days, but refused to go into any details.
Arabs Form Confederation
CAIRO, Egypt — The leaders of Egypt, Sudan and
Libya ended their summit meeting late Sunday with a
plan for eventual confederation of their states
embracing the northeast corner of the African
continent.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Sudan s leader
Jaafar el Numairi and Libyan strongman Muammar
Kadafi announced they had agreed on steps toward
political, economic and military links between their
nations.
The three-sided nature of all these commissions
indicated there would be no surrender of sovereignty
to any central organ —at least not for the present.
Muskie Seeks Candidacy
WASHINGTON — Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine,
said Sunday that "in a tentative, limited way" he has

started to sound out Democratic leaders as to the
chances of their supporting him as the party's 197 2
presidential candidate.
Muskie declined to name the persons he has
contacted and said it has been "too limited" a list.
"To reveal it would misrepresent the nature of my
interests and my drive in this connection," he said.
"We do have an organization but it must be
expanded to meet the needs of the future, he said.
"It is far from imposing in size and numbers at this
point. Nevertheless, we are taking the first steps that
could lead to the next."
Asked if he thought Nixon could be defeated in
1 972 , Muskie replied: "Any President is beatable."
Wichita Crash Investigated
WASHINGTON — The National Transportation Safety
Board said Sunday the plane crash that killed 31
persons, including 14 Wichita State University footbal
players, apparently was not caused by mechanical
failure.
"Further analysis of this testimony and other
related evidence is required before conclusions can be
draws," the board said.
"The board is now examining in detail the evidence
relating to the performance capabilities of the aircraft,
the flight planning by the pilots, particularly at
departure from Denver and the control, or lack
thereof, exercised by various organizations pertaining
to safety of the operations."
McGovern Hits Campus FBI
WASHINGTON — Citing his own survey of police
cheifs, student leaders and college administrators, Sen.
George McGovern has urged that FBI agents be barred
from campus investigations unless invited by local
authorities.
As to whether FBI agents should be used at
all —under any conditions on campus, some 81 ptr
cent of the police chiefs said yes, but only 4 3 per cent
of the college presidents and 8 per cent of the student
leaders agreed.

grand jury, which is conducting a preliminary
investigation of the violence, said he had not been
advised of the FBI probe and knew nothing about the
possibility of a shot being fired.

investigating the attack on the presidential motorcade
for several days, but refused to go into any details.
Arabs Form Confederation
CAIRO, Egypt — The leaders of Egypt, Sudan and
Libya ended their summit meeting late Sunday with a
plan for eventual confederation of their states
embracing the northeast corner of the African
continent.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Sudan s leader
Jaafar el Numairi and Libyan strongman Muammar
Kadafi announced they had agreed on steps toward
political, economic and military links between their
nations.
The three-sided nature of all these commissions
indicated there would be no surrender of sovereignty
to any central organ —at least not for the present.
Muskie Seeks Candidacy
WASHINGTON — Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine,
said Sunday that "in a tentative, limited way" he has

started to sound out Democratic leaders as to the
chances of their supporting him as the party's 197 2
presidential candidate.
Muskie declined to name the persons he has
contacted and said it has been "too limited" a list.
"To reveal it would misrepresent the nature of my
interests and my drive in this connection," he said.
"We do have an organization but it must be
expanded to meet the needs of the future, he said.
"It is far from imposing in size and numbers at this
point. Nevertheless, we are taking the first steps that
could lead to the next."
Asked if he thought Nixon could be defeated in
1 972 , Muskie replied: "Any President is beatable."

draws," the board said.
"The board is now examining in detail the evidence
relating to the performance capabilities of the aircraft,
the flight planning by the pilots, particularly at
departure from Denver and the control, or lack
thereof, exercised by various organizations pertaining
to safety of the operations."

Nixon Shot At In San Jose?
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. FBI agents here and in
Washington are pressing an inquiry into an u " ver ' t,e °
report that a shot may have been fired at President
Nixon before his limousine was stoned Oct. 29 in ban
Jose, Calif. , ,
The FBI is focusing on a brief time span during
which Nixon emerged from the hall, stood on the
hood of his car and waved "V" signs with his fingers at
the demonstrators.
Questions asked by FBI men seemed to suggest
they suspect that if a shot was fired at Nixon, e
weapon may have been equipped with a silencer or
was of relatively low caliber and was fired from a
distance. . t
In San Jose, the foreman of the Santa Clara County
grand jury, which is conducting a preliminary
